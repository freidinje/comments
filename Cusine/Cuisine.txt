These are all really gross too
Well I think its safe to say the title of this video is a lie
Wow so tasty desserts. One who Like these desserts hit the like button below my comment
Asosome and very easy thank you for sharing this video ??????????????
These recipes are from the yotube channel the scran line
If they show us all that common process which we all do and known the video will be I think more than 30 minutes
wow
Super ??????
Çok güzel??????
??????:+?????? Yeah...Only 10 minutes.....
In the first one you need to bake brownie for 30 minutes tho! So incredibly stupid!
Hmm, I think perhaps you don’t know how time works. On the very first recipe, you have to bake something and then freeze it. Unless you’re using liquid nitrogen or magic, things that size don’t go from burning hot to frozen in 10 minutes.
Super mind blowing so much??????????????????
Nice ?? but it is so difficult ????
zoom cam love fore ca ed red milj cas play sav to naar ver kroe wa lug voli ni

Ten minutes? Sez who? There's a lot of know-how, not to mention special equipment, on display here. It's entertaining, but not realistic for a lot of us (or healthy for any of us). File under fantasy.
I hate sounds background
Desserts you can make in 10 minutes. For the first dessert: bake for 30 mins

I little to creamy I’m going add heavy cream
BwB is P2W
This is what I love about Babish, he shows you his mistakes. Im a chef, want to know how I learned the most? lol of course its from informative senior chefs, but next to that, it was fucking things up until they got better and better. I can now make fancy dishes while im drunk and not make any mistakes. Hard work, determination. Cooking isn't easy it takes time to learn all the little things that help you learn to breathe in between dishes.
Make fried chicken from ‘The Help’
4:08 little bit too creamy, so i'm going to make it less creamy with HEAVY CREAM... how ironic
This channel is why I've gone to a cooking school where u work at a restaurant. This channel inspired me to pass the tradition of yt cooking from babby's mother to him to anyone with a cooking channel
Do the monster hunter feast!
Compare your content to your earlier content. Disappointed.
Another brilliant ep! Appreciate you sharing insights into your 'mistakes' - very reassuring to practicing bakers that it's all a case of trial and error.
I’ve never heard someone say “soften” that way before
make a dish out from one studio ghibli movie
solution to frosting being too creamy: add cream
I know someone probably already pitched this idea to you if you haven’t already thought of it yourself, but you should open up your own restaurant that has some of these most iconic movies recipes on the menu.
It's really really really informative to show your mistakes. We learn about the chemistry of cooking in the process, and we learn that small tweaks and changes lead to major differences. I learned a lot from this episode. Thanks!
Can you please do a thanksgiving video? I love your recipes and their the best and easiest to follow and I need ideas for thanksgiving dinner, thank you!
Ain't there two kinda one with ICING and other with cream cheese icing I I could have sworn there was one I don't like crema cheese

Nooooooo why the cream cheese ugh ??
A Steven Universe episode would be cool
I'm interested in your take on Ham's infamous s'mores from The Sandlot. Pretty basic stuff but I'd love to see your twist on it, creating your own graham crackers or adding a fun twist like using Reeses instead of Hersheys chocolate.

All y'all think Youtube is actually able to fully fund these creators' lifestyles but that just isn't true. You want the content? Pay for it. Can't afford it? Try saving your money and learn to budget. Don't want to pay for it? Shut your mouth and be glad you get to see BWB's content as it is.
Could you make a episode over Chico's Tacos. Dont be an heretic, make them the way they are supposed to be (government cheese).

Ok I think that he shouldn't make the pay 2 watch videos because i think way less will see them making them not worth it and if he posted them all here then maybe ads and sponsors will work out + i don't know what the patreon rewards are but i think i'd say the ones that pay get to choose the theme of the dish being made( if it's already this way correct me)

I thought it was binging whatever that was when I have seen your vids recommended in my feed, not bingeing. This is the first vid of yours I have watched.
the lemon ruins the whole thing.
I prefer Swedish cinnamon rolls
What was the rule of thumb for content support? Oh yea, don't paywall your normal content. Hiding episodes behind a paywall is a BS move. I get youtube is being a dick to its creators, but taking what you normally give us and hiding parts of it isn't okay. If you're going to make a paid exclusive, that's fine and more power to you, but it certainly shouldn't be what you're normally giving us as it stands. And before anyone chimes in "But it's EXTRA!" No it isnt. Home made hot pockets could very well have been next weeks episode. This blocked off content could easily be released on normal schedule. The fact that this normal content is being hidden from those who don't want to pay him or can't pay him directly is a paywall and it is NOT extra. Extra would be having an exclusive thing unique to the support, as in a new show or behind the scenes or whatever. But episodes that normally would be released to everyone now being hidden is not cool. On top of that, some of us already pay for Youtube Red, which is basically like already paying for the content of the creators we watch. Yet we are still being fucked over.
The recipe on your website has a few typos. I.e. the 1 teaspoon of salt vs. the half that you mentioned here in the video. Also, it'd be really great if you could write out the amounts for each ingredient in ml or mg, instead of ounces. Those are common measurements used almost everywhere. Ounces are primarily used in the US. Great video though!
Uuuuuuhm people? Are you really "disappointed" that someone who spents time making high quality videos said "IF YOU WANT you can sponsor me with 4.99/month for EXTRA content"????? he never said he is making his videos sponsors only, he said if you want to give him a few bucks for the free entertainment/education he is offering, you can do it with out going to another site
Sweet rolls from Skyrim?
Babish you should try to recreate the giant pancakes from the film Uncle Buck. Like if you agree

Look at all those Sayoris
Could ya make the gateau from skins
It makes me sad the people here who are complaining about missing out on a small bit of extra content because it’s not FREE. He’s been doing it on his patreon for a while. It’s literally his job, he needs to get paid. I feel like people don’t appreciate the effort that goes into content, since they expect it all for free nowadays. You can’t walk into a restaurant and demand to be served but you don’t want to pay for your food. You can’t refuse to pay the price for a movie ticket because the actors already got paid, but expect to be let into the theatre. It’s not the end of the world if you can’t get all the content you want, when you want it, and at the price you want. I couldn’t care less how much money he makes, you should support people for their content, not until they’re “doing well for themselves”. The great thing about this channel is that the normal videos are super entertaining on their own!
Hooooottt pockets
Back when I worked at a convenient store chain's kitchen, we used to make some of the largest cinnamon rolls. They came frozen in a box, so they weren't as good. Some days we'd only put 4 to a sheet pan, let them thaw over night in the refrigerator case as prep for morning, I had no clue what they did with them as i was never trained or worked mornings, but somehow they'd fill the entire sheet during baking. 6 to 8 was our typical amount per sheet, but 4 was when we got really huge rolls. Don't know what was in those rolls to make them grow that much, but having giant rolls made more profit.
take the swedish version. This just looks fucking bad.
Make The Robin Scherbatsky cocktail from How I Met Your Mother!!!
Now I'm hungry... Again. Thanks....

Banish, can you do a drunk voice over. Like drunk history.
I love ya, Babby. Guys, chill out on the payment topic. If you give even 25 cents one time on Patreon, you are contributing like a hundred times more than the standard ad-watching viewer according to Hello Internet. If you haven't given even that much, you have no leg on which to hop in your rage. Also, market forces yadda yadda. We oughtta respect his right to try stuff, even if it sounds dumb and overpriced. His deal.
Why do I hate this guy so much? Hmm. ??

Oh man, I learn so much from this channel about cooking and baking and stuff, but as someone who already bakes cinniman buns a LOT this was the first episode I loved but also was going "Aaaaaaa!!! Stop messing up those tasy buns!!" through the whole episode xD. I saw those mistakes coming before you even explained them. What I love though is you leave the mistakes in so other people can learn from them too! Cinniman buns done well are heavenly. Bad buns are dry, chewy, and heavy. The good ones I could eat by the dozen...
Make Scooby Snacks
make a discord.
That ad was fire asf
I wish I could help support you. You’re probably the first person who really got me into cooking. Now it’s a passion of mine to learn. One day I will be able to be a patreon. I’ve been trying to get a job as a prep cook to get into the industry.
kitchenaid is expensive as hell.
I don't think I've ever heard someone pronounce the t in "soften."
DO A ALMOND PALMER FROM BIG MOUTH LMAO
I like how people are getting butt hurt about having member exclusive content like he hasn't already been doing that on patreon, like many successful YouTuber's who still continue to upload on a regular basis. He literally said it's the same content as his Patreon supporters, just through YouTube. Y'all need to chill tf out and let Babish do Babish. You aren't his mom and if it bothers you that much then don't watch anymore.
Well damn my favorite channel wants me to pay him for membership content only. I can't afford that. Love ya but you sold out.
Yo can you do the triple gooberberry sunrise
Thank you for keeping the mistakes in!
i made these once for class and we put margarine on the inside before we sprinkled on the cinnamon/brown sugar and were buttery from the inside.

Yo gon get diabetes
Kinda sucks when people pay for YouTube red and still don’t get the fun stuff that a “channel member” does
”gotten to know your rolling pin”
I've been a fan for awhile, but I'm unfamiliar with your history Babish? Did this start as a hobby or is their some education behind this?
running out of ideas...
You tellin me you couldn’t find no clips of cinnamon rolls being made
You over cooked them
I'm surprised you didn't use makara cinnamon, since you used Cinnabon as your inspiration for this video. They actually have a proprietary blend of cinnamon that they use in their rolls. For shame! Haha just kidding ??
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..."
Chum. Bucket. Food.
"As God intended" lmao
What kind of conditioner do you use?
Between the serial plastic wasting sponsorship from Blue Apron and the members only episodes, I feel like you're going down a really bad path.

Jim Gaffigan's awesome. One of my favorite comedians, glad he got a feature.
Should’ve just made it a Basic with Babish.
gotten to know your rolling pin BABBIE NOOO
Man, y’all sure bitch a lot even though you get free content from the dude.

I need to try this out myself mouthwater
BABEY! HEY BABEY!!! PLEASEEEE SHAAAAREEEEEEE ????
Please do the Black spaghetti from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure
Mmmmm... my favorite Cinnamon roll...Loved ur recipe Babish
”?????????? ?????? ????????”
anyone knows whats the wrap he uses to covert the bowl?
Would love it if you did an Invader Zim episode!
He should make the dumplings from kung fu panda
Should've made the giant roll that Homer Simpson eats at Cinnabon
apple strudel from sound of music, dude
this gave me both an erection and diabetes.
You should do lobster thermidor, from the Lego Batman movie
"Binging"? As opposed to what? Google?
Hey Babish just had this idea. I bought a frozen dinner at the supermarket because I was too lazy to cook today and the picture on the box looks a million times better compared to how this came out. Ever thought of trying these frozen meals and then remaking in a super gourmet way like you do with other meals you’ve prepared? Anyways just a thought, love you channel ????
4:12 When your cream is too creamy so you add cream to make it less creamy while making it more creamy
At this point you're just making food videos then looking for that food in a movie so you have an excuse
What kind of plastic wrap is that?
You gotta do orange sweet rolls on basics now
You should make the sandwich that Peter orders in spiderman homecoming, that would be pretty cool not gonna lie
Make the double pepperoni pizza from the spider Man dlc
Yall didn't know that they're rolled, and that's why they're called cinnamon rolls????
Should have done another batch with puff pastry
What temperature do you bake them at? I’m going to try 375 Fahrenheit
The closest to a real life Sayori
What do I do if I don't have a kitchen aid? :(
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" lmao took me a second. good... job.
This is the link for the good place menu
Would it be possible to do an episode over horchata it would be amazing!
I don’t like it, it makes me hungry
I don't even like cinnamon roll's but watching this makes me want some!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." ;)
Good - it's important to learn from mistakes. It took me 4 tries to get your Inglorious Bastards strudel down to a science. Now it's a fam favourite. Never stop binging, Babish
You should make sweet rolls from Skyrim next time!
Stoned pb&j from Bo Burnham if you’re doing comedians now
I really like that you left the mistakes in. It thought me a lot about what can go wrong and how to fix it.
Wilson Fisk’s omelette
Benson's Grilled Cheese Deluxe from Regular Show!!!!
Unsubscribe Babish... you did some good videos but you're seriously overestimating your worth now.
Jim Gaffigan, noice
how is gaffigan as popular as he is milktoast crap
i like the way u oiled that rolling pin lol
I can never get my head around the american version of cinnamonbuns/rolls,,, im too attached emotionally to the 'swedish' version, the cream on top seems too much in my eyes and makes it look rather unappetizing. But to be fair,i havent tries it with frosting so i guess the flavors evens out!
Have you done the sandvich from team fortress 2? If you haven't done it could you please do it
I love that you put your mistakes because someone making the recipe at home may be doing them without knowing what went wrong
So do I sit in those or eat them?
This is a very childish request but I need to see a binge episode of Jackson and Oliver’s “Cheese Jerky” from Hannah Montana
If you start doing premieres then....
Now that the fallout vault tec cookbook is out. You think you’re gonna try some of those recipes and do your own take on it in the future maybe?
feels frosting is too creamy solution is to add cream Sometimes cooking doesn't make sense.
2nd way better I wanna make that
It would fit better to cinnamon rolls form Cinnabo in Better Call Saul.
He’s so funny I went to his show in Milwaukee
2:16 Did you ask for permission?
The cream cheese/butter is too creamy so lets add some cream to make it less creamy...
What if I want to add chocolate and caramel sauce
You should make Chidi's peep chilli from The Good Place
I'm glad you did keep the footage. It shows us that mistakes aren't terrible and career ending. You learned from it, and passed it on.
The true from scratch challenge, make your own flour, sugar, butter etc.
I'm really sad that Youtube is pushing some of its best creators into having to create premium accounts to help them out monetarily, instead of supporting them and staying true to what made this such a great platform in the first place. I can't blame anyone who is doing so - it makes so much sense, but I think that it's because Youtube is failing as a medium, rather than because this is where 'progress' is. Andrew - you deserve to reap from the content you create, because it is so well made and you can feel the time, effort and talent that goes in to every video you make. Keep it up :)
Thanks for sharing. I just made some last week by hand instead of using a mixer (i.e. wooden spoon handle to mix and hands to need), and I think they were the best I had ever made. I'm kinda swearing off using a dough hook for a bit to see if it makes a difference. But I've been working a couple days a week in a donut shop, so my kneading skills (and strength) have dramatically improved also. I did make the same first mistake, I crowded the pan and had to cut them instead of pulling them apart. But since I waited until they were thoroughly cooled, I got away with it. And I used more of a glaze than an icing so even cooled the icing got into all of the nooks and crannies. I appreciate your showing the first bit because mine looked exactly the same way. I like the 1/2 inch spacing that you did, that seemed just about perfect. I also used, as some noted, the paste method. But, I have never really liked the amount of filling left in the roll, it seems most of it runs out onto the bottom and forms that great crust on the bottom. It's tasty, just not where I want it as I like to unroll the roll to eat it and that makes the middle bite the best. I also used regular sugar, so it needed the butter. I think I'll try your filling and icing the next time and see what a difference it makes. I thought about cream cheese icing, but it didn't seem appealing at the time. Now that I've seen yours, I've changed my mind! Isn't that what sharing all of these great recipes is all about anyway?? Cooking is just one big experiment and always striving to improve.
Can you make Beef Stew from BenchWarmers?
You divide the community with the memberships and the exclusive contant..
that's a lot of nap to go through
I'm still a fan, but I feel like the show has changed. Regular episodes are starting to feel more like Basics with Babish. I liked it back when recipes had a little more creativity, complexity, or even just entertainment value. This episode was just basic cinnamon rolls. ?? Maybe it's time to expand the behind the scenes team. I know you can do better!
In sweden you put a mix of cinnamon, white sugar and butter on the dough which makes it so much more tasty
Couldn’t land a Better Call Saul clip, huh?
Babish needs a paddle for his mixer that has a scraper/spatula on it. Someone get him it for xmas.
Make something from Chuka Ichiban! please.
Much better without frosting and butter in the roll. Americans seem to have a psycosis of covering already good stuff with frosting or cheese
Where are the pickles man
do piss or bear shit from Man vs Wild
Try to make the 99 cheeses pizza from TMNT that would be foookin awesome
I still think he should do the ramen from naruto ?????
I love how your "mistakes" are barely mistakes.
you should make some food from undertale. like glamburgers and steak in the shape of metaton's face, legendary heros.
My favorite dessert
Man now I want cinnamon rolls
I fucking love the mistake parts, because I absolutely do shit like that when I try your recipes unless you specifically say "don't ____, it'll fuck it all up" lol
Can you make a Lembas Bread from Lord of the Rings, please? That would be awsome! :D
OMG He is Human Total Fuck Up on this one Babish.....lol
“So we can pull them apart, as God intended.” -Babish My favorite quote so far.
Please make Big Smoke's order from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas whenever you get the chance.
It would be cool if he could make something from Steven universe
You forgot to spread butter on the dough before adding the sugar and cinnamon mix, that was mistake number one. Usually you mix the sugar and cinnamon into the butter to make a paste and spread that, makes for moister cinnamon rolls. Also it should be pearl sugar on top, not frosting...
yo should make a keto diet video, like how to make a good proper meal
Definitely giving this a go for Christmas
In Norway we make them in a different way, we bake them all separately -not touching at all
It’s either yeast or be yeasted .
its hard not to feel warm when watching this video
Make Naruto Shippuden Ramen Please :) New Subscriber Here :)
3:54 that is the manliest way to sieve something hahaha, I shake my little girl wrist from side to side like the little pussy ho I am but babish cannot relate.
I find the lack of eggs and cardamom disappointing.
Can you do a simple rick from rick and morty????
Sploosh!!! do Zero's Sploosh from the movie Holes please??!!!!!
DO SPLOOSH FROM HOLES!!!
Yes dadish
Soup dumplings from crazy rich Asians!
5:16 - Babby pronounced the t in soften. Bold move.
Jim Gaffigan and you didnt make a HOT POCKET?
Hey Andrew - Love your videos. Would you consider using reusable, beeswax wrap instead of plastic wrap? My wife and I are foodies, and we cook a lot. We're trying to cut down on the plastic that we use, and we've found the beeswax wraps to be the perfect replacement. Give them a shot. You might like them!
Good morning, tippity top cheffers, let's get this roll!
I loved your focus on learning from mistakes! Thanks for sharing that footage, those tips are good to know
To be honest, when I think cinnabun, I think of the famous Louis CK bit. But we don't talk about him anymore...
"Synonym rolls, just like how Grammar used to make."
The next time that you make this, try brushing melted butter on the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mixture. It is delicious!
Can you make synonym rolls?
I have never ever seen or even heard of a cinnamon roll recipe that didn't add copious amounts of melted butter to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Is that even allowed?
Yesss cinnamon rolls. They are a Christmas morning tradition at my house, but really I'm always ready for one. Will give yours a try this year :)
oh yes daddy ( ?° ?? ?°) 2:16
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Oh My...
From now on, I will ALWAYS BOTH literally and philosophically wash my hands BEFORE AND AFTER cooking. Ah, I am learning so much here
You also forgot to add butter onto the dough with the cinnamon sugar mix
I think this should be a basics with babish
please do Triple Gooberberry Sunrise from The Spongebob Squarepants Movie.
Shoulda used Better Call Saul as your inspiration
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" ohhh myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Youtube agolrithims are getting creepy. I was eating a cinnamon roll and thinking of looking up a recipe.
So frustrated that you dont butter the dough before the cinnamon and sugar.
If something is too creamy, just add more cream! :D
Add vanilla to the frostingggggg
Well if you making stuff frome stand up shows You need to make the chocolate cake milkshake from gabriel stand up show
Since you’re not adverse to making Japanese food please make some food from Shokugeki no Soma aka Food Wars! Fake food has never looked so good!
My nigga where is the butter inside of the cinnamon rolls before you actually roll them?
Babish mentioned that he uses vinegar to clean his giant wooden worksurface. I am interested in that! Does someone know the right concentration for wood / kitchen? I would really like to know what concentration is the right one...
I udnerstand early access to your content if we pay, but some of us have been subs since day 1 and followed u on twitch once you started that up. So holding back videos COMPLETELY that would be monetized anyway is very disheartening babish. Dont be a sell out, remember where u came from.
basics with babish fried chicken.??
Hey Babish, Better Call Saul would've made a better excuse to make Cinnamon Rolls.
You are so cool
Again, a really great recipe! You were the inspiration to start my own YouTube channel! thanks for that :) greetings from the Netherlands!
Why didn't you just use Better Call Saul as an excuse instead?
Try to make swedish cinnamon buns or as we say in Sweden Kanelbulle.
All these people in the comments feeling entitled to free content smh
@5:19 he pronounced the T in "soften" and i cringed a little. but he is forgiven, for he is Babish
Please do some foods from the Witcher videogames next!
I really appreciate you showing the mistakes as everyone will probably make the same mistakes. Tutorial videos don't do this often enough, they quite regularly cut out mistakes to reduce length.
Chill that roll before you slice it. They'll cook more even
I hope I'm not asking for too much but I was wondering if you could outline the kitchenware and gadgets that you use, like where you got them from and what we should look for
should not have watched this without an immediate plan to go and get cinnamon rolls
Please give the Naco like you had done for this video.
They taste better if you mix the cinnamon and sugar mixture with butter and them spread it! Thats how we do it in sweden anyways
Add more cream to make this less creamy. mind explodes
why the hell would ya drown the poor buns? holy dang
Pretty soon YouTube will be just like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. Gotta pay for a subscription to watch anything.
Make wilson fisks omelete from daredevil
being swedish this saddens me. i have never seen buns made this way. Why do you americans make everything so big. And why do you cover it in cum ?
Tacos on a stick from icarly
DO THE RAMEN FROM NARUTO
It would be awesome to see you do the foods that Dr House made when he hopped off the Vicodin and got addicted to cooking instead
who cooks with a watch on ? dude...
I have just made cinnamon rolls
do pokemon malasadas next! :D
this isnt pornhub??
I’ve been a loyal fan since you only had a couple of thousand subscribers and I’ve gotta say, I feel like the quality of your videos have gone down a bit, they seem a bit rushed, and I used to love how you’d pick recipes that you could improve by using your own cooking talent as well as following the recipe as the film/ programme stated. Saying that, I wouldn’t pay $5 for the content now, I think your channel is great but it’s lost some of the sparkle it had at the beginning.
I'm very, VERY glad this isn't Louis CK's version.
As a Dane. I find this frosting a total HERESY!!
Getting to know your rolling pin
Thumbnail made me hungry. So I came here.
Really? Not from Walter Mitty? Ahh
but why didn't you add butter with the sugar-cinnamon mix :(
Making something less creamy by adding cream? America explain!!!
I love how you left all the mistakes in . The most important part of the video where I learned the most. Love this channel :D ! Thanks Babish
you forgot the butter in the rolls! Babish i'm heart broken.
YouTube won’t let me get the paid subscription
What is the cover called that he puts on the bowl at 1:59
do... do americans not put a layer of butter before the cinnamonsugar?????????????????????????????????
Who watches Babish, but never tries the recipes? ??
Very enjoyable!!
'if you ask me a little bit too creamy' Proceeds to add cream
For all the people who didn't listen, he's making ADDITIONAL CONTENT for members. You feel so entitled to say you're dissapointed. He literally not taking anything from you.
If youtubers with 2M suscribers can buy lamborghinis, you can at 3.3, not charge fucking 5$ on SpEcIaLs EpIsOdEs. ?????
Too pure for this cruel world
you say the ingredient you're adding and by the time you're done saying it, on screen, you've already finished adding the next ingredient you haven't even mentioned yet. please please stop dong this. you didn't used to do it in your first videos.
you are the best
I understand that you need money for this really nice show but I won’t stick around if I miss a ton of stuff because I don’t pay
Better Call Saul?? Cinnabon?? Missed opportunity..
You ever consider doing the wake-up juice from Back to the Future 3?
too creamy? add cream :D
Disgusting. And not the food, but the membership. Sad and disappointing.
There's no graceful way to oil a rolling pin.
gosh your voice is the bomb i love it im in love ! Just for this voice im making cinnamon rolls
It is so good to see tiny spatula getting some love this week. I don't think it's tiny heart could take any more neglect
what klingfilm are you using? is it reusable? (looks like)
WASTELAND OMLETTE (for Thanksgiving)
Glass bowl; nice touch.
Here’s a tip If you mix icing sugar, cinnamon and a drop of water it makes a paste that you can spread and it makes it more even and tasty but they do look delicious ??.

Plz make pho Babish!
Finally a proper cinnamon bun. Brioche is not a bun guys, I don't care how much cinnamon you put on or little as it seams at all these uppity joints.
Andrew listen to your subscribers who can't afford exclusive content. at the very least can you make it early release or something? i can't afford patreon.
Oh no! how dare he ask me to pledge $5 (optionally) for a little extra! How will my entitlement to free content go on? Gimme free content reeeeeeee!
It’s too creamy...... L E T ‘ S A D D C R E A M
N U T T
You could have used Better Call Saul as well. As they also have Cinabunn in it :P
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns?
I like how people are complaining about a paywall when BWB literally said at the end of the video that the exclusive "paywall" content is the same exclusive content that his patreon has been getting for years now and just because you have the option of doing or not doing the same thing through a different platform, in this case youtube. Now is when you start to complain.
I miss the days of youtube being free content where people were happy with just ad revenue. Now its patreon youtube subs and some even going to twitch. Your currently making 10 grand a month off your patreon alone, is that really not enough? Add on money you get from youtube ad revenue and sponsorships.
Louis CK’s Cinnabun joke is much better
Please make Kitty Foreman’s brownies from season 8 of That 70s Show that were so moist you could eat them with out milk, thanks.
Do you hire for jobs related to your Corp.
Does anyone else feel Babish's torso judging them?
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." LMAO also, I'm a tad bit confused what I need to do to watch that homemade hot pocket video. will it ever be on youtube?
I'm only 14, I don't even have a job ugh I love your videos so much and I really really really wish I could support!! Like I said, I'm only 14 tho I'm sad you decided to make that decision but I mean it sucks because I think the majority of your fans are kids possibly, or at the most, teens that are in college and can't afford to even get lunch sometimes But you're already receiving a ton of negative feedback which I think nobody's being mean about it and screaming "fuck you babish" or anything which is super good bc they're being tame and simply saying "I'm disappointed" But it's your channel And it's your decision Possibly to even just pay rent So I'll support your decision, in an nonmonetary sense bc I'm broke Either way, thanks for the videos!
Gonna make two batches of cinnamon rolls after watching this. Just so I can learn from the mistakes too ??
Those jokes were dead
hey look, it's a Twit...wait no, Youtube subscription
Jesus Christ, I usually check the comments on Babish's videos because they tend to be decent people having nice conversations, but holy shit everyone is going mental over A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION! Like, just accept it and move on, no one had a problem with the fact he's had a Patreon forever, which does literally the same thing. ???????? ????'?? ?????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???? ?????????? ?????? ??????. Youtube FINALLY does something that makes it easier to be a Youtuber nowadays without the demonetization bot shitting down their throats (and no, I don't think for a second that Babish gets demonetized) and everyone acts like it's the end of the world, chill out, it literally never has to effect you if you don't want it to.
Broooooo he should low key setup a contest and who ever wins, he flys them out to NY(i think that's where he lives) they spend a whole day with him and they are part of a video plus they pick a video of his channel of a dish he has made and they take part in making it
I think you meant literally washed and philosophically didn’t wash your hands
Hey a tip for next time you make these: get non-flavored dental floss and get a good amount. Then put it under the roll halfway and bring the 2 ends up in a crisscross to get a clean even cut. You get more control of your size with that.
You could have just used Schitt’s Creek. As an excuse lol
Can you make brownies?
REEEEE LEAK THT HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS
I know it's been a while since crunchyroll sponsored you, but please give us from food wars A) The Soma vs Joichiro Breakfast Challenge B) The Takumi vs Mimasaka Semifreddo battle and/or c) Soma's risotto stuffed quail

Exclusive episodes just for people that pay? Not cool.
Mistake number one wasn’t forgetting butter under your sugar/cinnamon mixture???
I had a cinnamon roll yesterday at school
My heart stopped just watching this
$5 is less than one half of one lunch out. Get a grip, people. I spend more than this each week on soda
Your god maybe
Make the sundae from that one episode of Spongebob
You should make a video about Gokus epic meals!
Well, after my upcoming contribution to our Halloween Potluck, I know what I'll be bringing to the office NEXT! =D
And now I'm fat. :p /Ok, ok, 'fatter,' dammit, shut up. //totes worth it.
I don’t understand how the standup was funny at all...
Let me thin out my cream cheese, butter and sugar frosting, with heavy cream...
Does anyone else feel accomplished when they see binging with babish using the same utensil as you have at home? Well I sure do
How about the dumplings from “BAO”?
Or it could have rather been the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from better call saul.. :/
“Screwed up royally” lolllll
Now lets do Louis CK’s cinnabons
Nice buns!
why oil not flour? also why bread flour not AP Flour?
IT'S NOT ORANGE! OUTRAGEOUS!
Id like to get to know your rolling pin daddy babby
Jim Gaffigan is a real Queer cock sucker.
Yess such a great breakfast for such a great stand up show lmao
So is the Tu-tur-key-key your Thanksgiving special for this year?
I half expected him to just do the bad batch and call it a video. Nice to see he's picking the quality back up.
Men are u ever coming to argentina?
why are people so angry about the 5 dollar thing? nothing changes for you. i dont sub to his patreon but im not here whining like WOW YOU'RE MAKING US PAY FOR BEHIND THE SCENES?? his regular content will still be free (with ads ofc). like let him live. we all need money to survive and we can all do with it as we please. its not like he's genuinely forcing it on you. god damn.
You know Babby, I could've really used a Hot Pocket tutorial ??...
You shouldn't knead on medium speed. Its 2 for kneading. You definitely shouldn't knead on medium on camera. Pretty sure you just voided your warranty.
I hate Jim so much lol
Jim Gaffigan is a terrible comedian
Make taco on a stick from icarly
Who thinks he should do a series were he makes the biggest foods from restaurants taking the normal ones and make them huge
You didn’t butter the inside! Cinnamon and sugar, and melted butter, roll it up and butter even more! The more butter the better!
It's too creamy I think I'll add HEAVY CREME to thin it out
Okay I lovya babish but cream cheese icing? Why man. Why
90 of your dishes go into the "clean plate club" is had lost its prestigious label.
Can you make Chidi's Chilli from The Good Place ?
$5 a month for one single channel? I love this channel but that's ridiculous, especially since you're paywalling some of your videos.
A question, is it cinnamon rolls, ir cinnamon buns? Or are they different baked goods?
Better Call Saul would have been a good reference as well.
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ??
I have a question: What size eggs do you use?
I love that Babs always owns his mistakes. It makes beginner cooks a lot less intimidated to know that everyone makes these kinds of screw-ups.
Anyone else catch the innuendo he made while greasing the rolling pin?
For some reason I thought the cream was salt and I almost cried
I don’t see the membership option.
Babish would probably crucify me. I forget to add bacon, cheese, salt and pepper before flipping my omelette over every time.
Do food from Studio Ghibli films!
Crème de la crème à la Edgar !
So how much do we have to donate to patreon to have you cook a meal for us? ??
There are no mistakes in art.
Glad to see I’m not the only one sad I don’t get to see that exclusive homemade hot pockets episode. It’s not a matter of not wanting to support you, rather an inconvenience to your fans that we would all have to pay $5 to see a new recipe. I understand you want to be compensated for your work, but this idea leaves a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
2:16 ( ?° ?? ?°)
Can you please make Pokepuffs?
Bruh next time spread the butter across the dough then add the sugar spice mixture fam.
That was awesome! Thank you so much for including the "what not to do section." I honestly learn more from those honest mistakes!
Dude Why do I feel the need to see you in an episode of Bob's Burgers?
anyone else unroll the cinnamon roll then lick the frosting off your finger only to realise you haven't washed your hands but you don't wanna wash them cause then you loose 50% of the frosting so you keep licking it off your fingers anyway?
You ran out of ideas from movies and TV shows huh...
4:09 MAKE LESS CREAMY BY ADDING MORE CREAM
There are too many swedes on the internet to propagate these lies of their cinnamon rolls being better -- they are almost always dry, have weird added spices that throw off the flavor of the cinnamon, and they sprinkle freaking rocks of sugar on top. Get out of here with that shit.
Could you do some dish from the Hundred Foot Journey?
With you voice Babbish, you need to narrate a documentary or something. It's so soothing.
Thank you Babish ,you are the Jesus of cooking
Love Jim Gaffigan
White comedians are so cringy lol
BABISH!
You should make Minnie’s chocolate pie from The Help or Ed’s sauce from GoodBurger
Easily eat all 12 of them
Not a fan on exclusive episodes behind a paywall.
I’m having so much unnecessary anxiety your videos are probably the only thing that calm me down .??
"once you gotten to know your rolling pin"
why are you putting content behind a paywall? sigh... that's kinda sad
If I wasn’t burnt out on Cinnamon rolls I would make these for breakfast... Screw it, they look too good to not make them.
Never clicked on a video so fast
Who the fuck puts cream cheese a on cinnamon roll?
My family visits Cinnabon regularly and my young kids love to watch the workers make cinnamon rolls. One thing they do differently is adding softened butter to the dough after it's been rolled out and then adding a cinnamon-heavy mixture on top of that. If you're going for the Cinnabon level of roll that Gaffigan is talking about, you gotta add butter to the dough and vanilla to the frosting.
Make more videos God damnit
I tried to pass this video because I knew I would get hungry but it looked too good... now I’m hungry
You mean sweet roll
Make a sandwich from Scooby-Doo
My wife makes cinnamon rolls that are indistinguishable from Cinnabon...main difference is she butters the inside of the roll as well
yeah dude. i mean, i know u gotta pay ur bills and shit; but ive been following u since u had 100k followers. Last couple episodes were all about that blue apron shit, and again, i dig that. but, if thats the way you going with this channel, i appreciate all the videos uve posted and i wish u good luck
do the Kimchi Gumbo from the movie "Searching"
>says the frosting is too creamy >adds cream
sorry babish but i need to report this for pornography
I think I'll stick with my kanelbullar.
Please do Peeps in the Chili Pot from last week's episode of the Good Place...clean plate club member for sure.
The best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made are the Alton Brown Good Eats book recipe, but I’ve gotta try these
This is too creamy... adds cream Now I understand the use here, but the name makes it sound counterintuitive
You should try making swedish cinnamon rolls. :)
I am so obsessed with cinnamon rolls rn too omg ??
If we're letting stand-up comics in, can you do orange chicken from Jo Koy's set?
Those cinnamon rolls looked so good it brought tear to my eye. (I know, pathetic, but cinnamon rolls are amazing. Anyone who says different has issues)
I'm too broke for memberships aaaaaah. I feel bad that I can't support you through Patreon already. Ahhh college sucks.
I’ll be unsubbing, I don’t support paywalls
the amount of people crying over content they didn't even know they were missing is amazing. you didn't have it, you didn't lose it, yet you're still crying about it.. he isn't changing to sub-only for fucks sake, he just uploads a few videos for patreons and sub-only.. its not the end of the world, you won't see less videos of him..
I feel like my grandma could teach you a thing or 2 but it’s good you did okay, love the vids keep it up??
You should make chocolate covered meatballs from that one episode of american dad just to give you a challenge.
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin,...." Shouldn't we have taken it out for dinner & a movie first...?
Want to make your cinnamon rolls extra sticky and yummy? Pour a cup of heavy cream over the rolls before baking as normal. I transcended the human plane after tasting it.
First of all, I am an absolutely straight man. Now this is what I have to say, dude you are an absolutely beautiful man with those cinnamon rolls no I think the cinnamon rolls are beautiful.
too creamy... adds heavy cream.
If you ever come to Texas, go to Lulu's in San Antonio. They make a GIANT 3 lbs cinnamon roll. It is delicious and absolutely almost impossible to finish.
Synnonym roll like grammar used to make
You forgot butter with your cinnamon and sugar mixuture
This guy is a greedy sellout
Saul Goodman would be proud of you
DONE! I wish I had thought to take PICTURES! But the moment I saw this video go up I knew I had to try it! The rolls hadn't finished cooling before they were all gone! Clean plate club for sure! This is an amazing recipe and I can't wait to make them again! Thank you for all your hard work!
Put them in a box & send to me plz as is, I don't care! I am the barb kelner of cinnamon rolls! lol
It's 4 am and i'm competely wasted, watching this helps me ti survive this night
Love jim
Why don’t you add butter with the cinnamon sugar?.... won’t omitting the butter result in a dryer cinnamon bun?
What is it called cinnamon bun, cinnamon role or cinnamon swirl? Or did they do that to screw with us
Too creamy? Add cream.
Can you make the good burger sauce from good burger
Louis C.Ks standup on Cinnabun is hilarious
Babish has Big Dick Energy pass it on
I'm sad that I can't eat these since I'm allergic to cinnamon. I always walk past cinnamon rolls in the store and they are so temping.
I really just think you wanted to make more cinnamon rolls...and I'm ok with that because? I'd do the same
it was only a matter of time before your success warranted a paywall. congratulations are in order.
Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin ??
People seem to not understand this one simple fact: It's literally the exact same thing the patreon supporters were getting in the first place. You aren't getting fully pay walled for his normal content. So why shit on Andrew for making adding just a little bit more to his income? If you have the extra money, cool... If not you'll still be getting ALL the normal content.
This looks soooooooo good
This episode makes me feel sleepy.
What is better for you fees wise, youtube membership or patreon? I will do whatever charges you the least fee percentage.
Only one way to remove paid sites on a ad driven website.  Unsubscribed
the Broodwich please
You + Jim Gaffigan = Good Video
$4.95 a month? Pathetic rubbish.
That frosting is vomit inducing.
Woah woah wooooaaah, you're putting whole episodes behind the paywall now? No, come on man, you know better.
Great now make me some.
Can you make spaghetti tacos from iCarly
Frosting is too creamy, add heavy cream to thin it out
jim gaffigan inspired episode and you dont go with hot pockets?
What cling wrap do you use? It doesn’t look plastic...
Cinnamon rolls? You mean Lin Manuel Miranda
Great video keep it up
WAIT did babish just make a mistake? ???????
I shouldn't have laughed that hard on some of the things you've said on this particular episode. oh well.
You forgot the bacon
Boo, locking content behind paywall. For shame.
Gain 10lbs by just watching the video..how..HOW!!!
bro u kinda look like my 8th grade science teacher
Your collection of tiny kitchen utensils has gotten me intrigued beyond belief. Tiny wHisk isn't alone anymore.
Let this man make money on something he works hard on. This literally doesn't take anything away from you, it's extra content. Welcome to capitalism.
secretly wishing I was the rolling pin . . .
I was looking for one of these.
I love Jim Gaffigan
Momma always butters the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mix
This morning I saw this video and I craved cinnamon rolls and I’m home alone on fall break and I don’t have enough money for postmates so I decide I’ll walk to the store which is about a mile away. So I look and look but I don’t find and money. All I found was a 1964 50 cent coin... ??!!! All silver coins (accept nickles) before 1965 were made of 90% silver! And I know there is a gold and silver shop near my house that I can walk to (about 0.5 miles away) so I take the coin and sell it for $6 then I go to the store and get the cinnamon rolls but my sister texts me to get her Starbucks from my Starbucks account but my phone is at 1% so I barely make it and then walk 1 mile home. Worth it.
when he was like wow it doubled in sized
I love you even more Babish for the Jim Gaffigan refrence????.
I wanna punch the person who came up with the the name for "Cream Cheese" It sounds like the most disgusting thing ever I mean who would combine cheese and cream
You should write these down
I like how the comments are filled with peoples “you know what I think” ‘s, and others complaining about paying to support. Real classy. Keep up the good work man, and make some food from Zelda. ??
Soff-ten?
I like mine made with half cake flour, half AP flour so they’re very tender, and I use a brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter mixture to fill. I skip the frosting because I’m already eating a cake filled with sugar and butter. It’s just too much for me.
the entitlement coming from people who consume content for free is a whole lot lmao, you don't have to pay nor will your normal vids get affected by the choice
$4.95 a month is absurd! You better post a new killer recipe about every few hours to justify that. And how about posting the recipes in the comments to save some time. That way we can go out and earn some money to pay for ridiculous YouTube subscriptions! Get real.
If you cut them with a thread they retain a more round shape. My mom would freak out if she saw you cut them with a knife.
BITCH WTF HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS TAKE MY MONEY BINGINGWITHBABISH
You should make bread pudding next
The stand up wasn't funny at all
This video made my stomach growl so much! I would love love love to see you recreate the fluffleberry cake from the Trolls series on Netflix! Your content is so visually appealing!
Would you like that with some hot jizz?
bless. you.
jim gaffigans the best.
Don’t you wish they served this for breakfast at school?
Louis CK had a good bit abt cinnabuns ??
Try putting softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and marshmallows inside your cinnamon rolls! And instead of that frosting use powdered sugar, milk, oil, and almond flavoring. It’s really really good, I promise!
2:15 ( ?° ?? ?°)
"We can pull them apart as God intended" ... I love you Babish
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" hahaha
Babish oiling that rolling pin????
I mean, so long as he continues to release his regularly scheduled videos, I don't really care about the member stuff.
Anyone whining about him offering extra content to people who are willing to pay for it is a pathetic loser.
Babish in 4K is amazing
you should "make" an app like Tasty or Fit Men Cook with recipes with in app purchase for new seasonal recipes
Filthy Frank's Hair Cake.
Can you do a cooking mama recipe?? If you haven't done it already.
There is no god.
ohmygod seeing people complain about how Andrew is utilizing the YT membership is making me so angry. Y'ALL FORGET THAT THIS IS HIS JOB!!
Duuude Finallyy You did cinnabon rolls!
1. Watches video of delicious looking homemade cinnamon rolls 2. Drives to to store and buys cinnamon rolls in a tube
Shoutout: To the Kousher Salt For making this channel possible
Make the Ethiopian food from the Simpson's
I like how Babish decreased the 'creaminess' of the frosting by adding cream lol
If you’re making food from a comedy act, you can do food from anime. Make bell peppers and beef from Cowboy Bebop
What did you cover the dough with when you first rested it?
Mooncakes please
Think of it this way. If he can't make a living off youtube then he'll have to get a 9-5 job and cut back on videos. No one wants that right?
Make Kingpin’s omelette.
I already have an absolutely perfect recipe for cinnamon rolls that I found years ago.
To all those complaining about the pay wall , you're not losing anything. Those people are just paying for something extra. It's fair.
Daddy babish back at it again blessing me with your skills ?? (no homo)
Make dc mumbo sauce
Weirdly enough, 2 of the 3 mistakes were also done by Andrew in Tasty's Eating your Feed... and it was also a Cinnamon Roll... o_o
Babish I'm moving into an apartment to be closer to college at the end of this year and I swear to God you are going to get me through that with your recipes
2:18 He says once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin Right as he is stroking the wood u see what I’m saying
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" tell us how you really feel Andrew.
What yeast do you use ? And what kind of sifter did you use in this video ?
I don't understand why everyone is so up in arms about him having paid extra content. He already has a patreon that gets extra content when you pay, so why not having the exact same thing here? It's not like he's not doing his regular content anymore. You give extra, you get extra. It's literally EXTRA for a reason.
He messed up on purpose so that he had an excuse to make more cinnamon rolls.
Omg I just drooled Input Homer Simpson Drooling hear....................... I wish I had a Stan mixer with attatchnents. Now I want Cinnamon rolls Yummmmmmmmmmmmm
Wow did not need to see Babish lubricating his rod...
This dough should be sticky Oil up the rolling pin because the dough is sticky
I've made probably like 600lbs of bread or more, and I gotta say, I've never had an issue with yeast+salt, you should do a mythbusters style myth busting episode of cooking beliefs vs reality. Like how some people put oil in their pasta water to make it not stick etc.
FUCK This Really I bet you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon rolls (Edit) Just read the description make something tomorrow (Edit2) This is Just a Joke (edit3) make bubbas shrimp part 2
I looooove your videos! They make cooking look like so much fun. I would love to see you do the MLT from The Princess Bride! Also, some of Amy’s creations from Brooklyn 99 like the baking soda mashed potatoes ??
I don’t understand what the big deal is about Andy’s decision. You have the option to pay for extra content. Extra. It’s not like he’s suddenly making his whole channel inaccessible unless there’s payment. I think it’s completely fair. You can choose to not pay and still see his normal videos as per usual.
I'll be making vegan cinnamon rolls tomorrow I'm so excited
Make anything from the cartoon show chowder
bell peppers and beef (cowboy bebop) ?
I just want God intended fluffy bread..
Folks complaining about a “paywall” should understand it's only for extra content. Regularly scheduled Babby will continue for free (ad-supported)
1 (and biggest one) mistake: give a fuck about visuals and texture. Man Like my Mother always says:" it should Not Look Like Hiroshima, but Bit broken is ok." Banking never goes like you would expect it. So chill. Your First try was good too. Next time do karnellbular (real cinnamonbuns). They are much better than that what you call cinnamonbuns
DUDE!!!! I just saw you on Buzzfeed's Worth It!! Crazy, out-of-nowhere cameo! That was so cool! Small world!
Babish likes Jim Gaffigan holy shit my life is complete
So two things. 1). Can you do like a basics episode, but for college students? Like how to make good food with only a stove, oven, and hand tools, maybe a crockpot. Because I'm in college right now and would love to make some of your recipes, but I dont have access to a stand mixer, or an electric hand mixer, or any real "fancy" tools. I just think it would be really cool. 2). I am not a fan of the membership for "normal" videos. I can understand if it was for like the behind the scenes and Q&A videos that I know you do on patreon, but not for this. I'm a college student, I can barely afford groceries and gas right now, I can't afford to pay for videos, as much as I want to see them. I love your content, but I dont think this is the right thing to do. No matter what happens I'm still going to keep watching whatever I can.
Make the food from The Green Mile
You can get sponsored by audible and do book foods One suggestion I have is the foods from Rutabaga: the adventure chef
This makes me so sticky.
Babish I don't want to be that guy but you're already pulling down a healthy six figure salary each year purely off the Patreon revenue you already have plus whatever you get off of ads and sponsorships. I'm not so sure that exclusive videos are the best way to take the channel, $5 a month might not seem like much but it adds up and the entirety of Netflix is only $8 a month, I don't think that's really a good price point for one single channel that gets maybe an extra episode or two per month in comparison.
Babish: puts dough in a bowl to rise for the millionth time Me: "Holy shit it so big now"
Everything candy from Jimmy Neutron ????????
What if you flour your surface/rolling pin instead of oiling it. Does that work just as well?
Charge a dollar and you’ll make more money. Less people will be “disappointed” and more people will be comfortable with spending a dollar vs 5. Enough to outweigh how much you would make charging 5, I believe. I’m thinking about it like this. Netflix costs $7.99 for way more content so it seems very disproportionate to people. Doesn’t 1 seem so much further away from 8 then 5? Enough so for people to be enticed enough to care and think they’re getting a better deal out of it.
Wow. Ok. A pay-wall for "exclusive episodes". This is a sad day. Didn't think you were the kind of creator to do us like that Babs. Gonna have to drop a downvote on this episode, first one ever but trying to cash out on supporters who have been supporting you since the beginning, people who have bought your cookbook, watched your ads, clicked your links, and upvoted every episode... This is kinda gross.
Best cooking show out there.
Clicked so fast because I thought Jim Gaffigan was guest staring. Good job Babs, ya got me! Great recipe too!
Guys if you don’t want to support him just don’t. He wants to make something special for those who have the ability to give him extra support and it’s okay!! Let him live
I don't know why I hate cinnamon rolls. Everything about them is right. But my body just says "this is too fucking sweet and the filling does not work with the dough." home made or not, I kind of hate them But I'll kill the shit out of a tray of those gross orange frosted Pillsbury rolls.
damn but i wanna know how to make hotpockets
this is a bit of a stretch
I don't know where Jim is getting his Cinnabon from, but every cinnamon roll I've seen from them is about the size of a head of garlic.
“*rubs oil over rolling pin suggestively* once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” ??????
I add extra brown sugar to avoid the frosting and crowd to keep slightly moist dough. People love them.
for all those saying "Eww paywall eww" Shut your bitch ass up. Nigga got to eat, and with all the bull shit youtubes going through dont be suprised.
really..so I'm never going to see how you make hot pockets?
Make the doughnut breakfast sandwich from the same stand up please!
I love this channel so much, but that "join" button makes you look like a piece of shit. It makes me think of someone like Jake Paul.
you could have made this a better call saul episode and ya blew it! :P
It could also be from better call saul
DAAAAMN i want it now
do chug jug from fordnide
Gonna take a wild guess and say the opening scene was Andrew's 2nd favorite Cinnamon Roll related bit. Can you guess the first? Hint: Louis CK
Yes. Love the change in format. Don't be afraid to express yourself just because you've accumulated a lot of subscribers now, people like your personal creativity as well
Ah, Jim Gaffigan. My favorite comedian. By the way, the special that clip was from is called Beyond the Pale, and it's on Netflix if you want to give it a listen.
HOLY FUCK THAT LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING JESUS GOD I WANT IT NOW!!!!
what watch are you wearing?
People consider standup comedy funny? That's fucking retarded.
Including mistakes was a nice touch! Nice to see you jazz up the formula.
HEY GURL HEY ??
this is a version of art, in video format, it is entirely fine for him to charge for extra videos. It takes time and effort to film and edit, if he feels the need for added compensation I'm glad he felt comfortable enough to do so. No one's forcing you to pay, the fuck is this attitude of 'i get so many videos for free how dare you not give me everything'
For everyone that is pissed off that he has an exclusive membership for extra content, if you don't want to pay, you get a video a week. If you would pay 5 bucks a month you get extra. Literally if you want more you have to pay, just like everything in life.
why is this in my recommended
Fuck jim gaffiagan
So why not use 2 baking pans? And why pans over sheets?
Hey Mr. Babish. I have a recommendation for one of your videos! You should make Mrs. Beans famous nutmeg ginger apple snaps from fantastic Mr. Fox.
dam, you literally made my friend shed a tear with that pan removal.
Once you got to know you’re rolling pin ????
I love Jim Gaffigan! He's great ??
2:17 Andrew, I - don’t even know what to say
You should do the number 9 menu idea in Regular show
I just saw Jim Gaffigan Nashville
So just cinammon rolls? Putting Jim in the title seems pointless.
I am so glad that you use lemon in your recipe! It really brightens up the flavor!
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
This guys whole channel is a fuckin joke just takes click bait names for things people like and oh I’m making that
Exclusive episodes, woohoo.... One more youtuber falls to the dark side... I get that you need money, i get that you want to give something back to people who support you, but content paywalls are the dark side of this kind of content... Other channels managed to get better ways to do that...
I used to work at Cinnabon, good try, but not even close.
Good excuse
Lmao “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” I can’t????
Cook with Gordon Ramsay dude!
will the membership exclusives eventually become videos you put on your channel free?
Well, you pronounced the T in 'soften', so I'm afraid that's it for me. Good luck in all your future endeavors.
Don't call it "mistakes," call it what it is; "Research and development." It always pays off doing a test run 1st whenever you're doing new things in the kitchen.
"cream in the cream cheese until creamy, but this was too creamy so i added cream"
Well he's offering a service. Paying for that service makes sense.
Anyone else say “Oh fuck” @5:20
I love this channel just finished binge-watching every video
"once you get to know your rolling pin"
Capitalizing??
Make Rick and Morty food
Is the buttermilk measured in fluid ounces?
its scientifically proven salt will not damage yeast. its a culinary school myth
I want to mention I think the babish sponsor isn't as bad as people are saying. We're not losing the videos on Tuesday and Thursday because this is implemented, it's just an option you have to pay for more content in a week. I think it's understandable that $5 could seem steep some people myself included but I don't think it's totally outlandish when people are super down to subscribe to channels on Twitch all the time just for emotes and no additional content. I'm not into the idea of a highly requested episode being behind a paywall, so I hope the sponsored episodes are ones that Andrew specifically thought to create.
Whats the generic reason a person would oil their work service vs flouring it?
Man you’ve gotten lazy. You used to have original and unique recipes and variations but now you just made a generic cinnamon roll literally anybody could make. On top of this you introduce paid content? Your subs are going to plummet
How you gonna make cinnamon rolls and not make chili after
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
Ha! "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Ha!
Make a Mr.Robot or Tim Burton special please? And either make something from We Bare Bears
Could you subsitute all purpose flour instead of bread flour?
Too creamy he says while adding more cream
WHY DIDNT YOU USE THE CINABON SCENES FROM BETTER CALL SAUL!!!!!!!!! IM MAD
Why'd ya have to tease me like this? Evil!
did you actually just pronounce the "t" in soften as in "soft-en" ?!
This Look So Good ??
Can you pleeeaaaase do the mini muffins ????
You should do Katsudon from Yuri!!! on Ice or San Xian noodles from Flavors of Youth
If you make mistakes in your recipes, I really think you should leave the footage in. You could show the audience first hand what it should and shouldn't look like. The mistakes you make I guarantee 99% of society will make too.
The darkening injures him in the left thigh
What is that cover called that he puts over the bowls?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS JIM GAFFIGAN IS AMAZING
Those mistakes were really just blessings in disguise. Would still eat.
Do a real kanelbulle!
Cummie rolls ??????
I mean to be fair call me a fat fuck but I would wish the cinnamon rolls were bigger
the fact you’re making ‘exclusive’ content has really made me want to stop watching your channel which is a shame because i love everything you post, but you’re starting to get too greedy.
• At the start of the video: [sees Jim Gaffigan] . . . ? ??? ?????~??s ? • Watching the end slate: [gaaaasp!] ? HOMEMADE HOT POCKE~ETS! ?
Cream cheese frosting + Cinnamon rolls = ??
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish, because it's not related to movies or TV?
We have all intentionally fucked up cinnamon rolls before babish. It's like a culinary right of passage.
Do Ed's Sauce from Good Burger!!!
Snazzy wrist watch, Babby???? If you're running out of ideas, a House MD Special would be awesome
when will we get bubba's shrimp part 2 bab
I love Jim Gaffigan and I Binge watch Babish all the fairly often
Can you make food from fantastic mr Fox
So... he’s asking us to pay $4 a month to watch “extra” stuff even when he already earns a ton of money? Come on Andrew.
2:16 “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” please tell me I’m not the only one with a dirty mind ????
I really don’t understand why everyone is so upset about the membership exclusive videos; it’s the exact same concept as what Babish is doing on Patreon. This is also his job now and it’s ridiculous to expect him to keep churning out content without payment. I get that he has sponsors and stuff but I’m sure these videos get expensive and people need to eat and pay rent too. Nobody is obligated to pay for a membership, it’s just a way to support content creators you like.
Too creamy. Add some cream.
I love Jim gaffigan
I have only eaten cinnamon rolls like twice in my life but whenever i see them in a cooking video i crave them so much. Its 01:08 AM, HELP
I don't even cook that often but I cant get enough of you're content. It must be that angelic voice you have ??
Need more Baking with Babish™ in my life
Babby, I really enjoyed the mistakes, on shorter videos (if the mistakes happen again) please repeat! Especially as it's a benefit to us lower level cooks AND it's pretty funny and humanising, nobodies perfect!
Waaaaaaaat no worstishiresgshshhjtehurehurhier sauce
Is that a rolling pin in your apron or are you just happy to see me?
You should make the "Captain Crunch casserole" from Futurama
Microwave wings from regular show pls
The day has finally come!!!! :)
Can you make Borscht?! please
you must be really struggling there having adds, sponsored videos plus asking for donations...WOW!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Have you made spaghetti tacos from icarly, because if not I think you should
Let me just break out my wheelbarrow
Infinity War foods - 'Metaphysical Ham on Rye' Reuben Sandwich, 'Stark Raving Hazelnut' ice cream, 'Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge ice cream, Deep Fried Edinburgh Kebab, Zarg Nuts
Dilutes creamy mixture with cream
hey great videos! it would be cool to see you make kringle like the kind you can find in Racine, WI
Shouldve done it “from breaking bad” lol
Good to know even the mighty babish makes mistakes. And still eats them ??
Lemon zest should be mandatory.
Gut busters Malcolm in the middle
Didn't Louis CK do a similar bit? Or are we just acting like he's dead to everyone now...
Ohhh THATS why they're called Cinnamon rolls
Make Asuna's Ragu stew from SAO!
REALLY!!!!!!! THE ONE ITEM I WAS WAITING FOR AND NOT PRESSURING YOU ABOUT, WE HAVE TO PAY TO SEE?!?!?! HOT POCKETS, FML
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish? Great video though.
My Grandma always makes her frosting too sweet but love the rolls
Also Louis CKs stuff
Don't get greedy
Babish, make the foods from Everybody Loves Raymond.
I'm with the majority here, don't sell out and get greedy trying to make more money at the expense of the people that love your chanel. It's a good way to lose subscribers in my opinion.
Since when does anyone need an excuse to make cinnamon rolls? There’s never a bad reason to make delicious cinnamon rolls??
Wish he used someone funnier to make cinnamon rolls ??
???? ????
haaahha paaaaahhckaaat
Ehh i like the video but Jim gaffigan isnt funny
Sonic the hedgehog chilli dogs
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." ( ?° ?? ?°) Also, premium content behind a paywall is bad in many definitions of the word. If you're putting it behind a paywall, make it limited. A month waiting period or something along those lines so EVERYONE gets the content, but you're still making it very much a "support me and see it early" kinda thing. Most folks are okay with something like this.
Please do the food from Haven
You should do the mud pie and salad from Drop Dead Fred, both movie accurate and edible versions
rubs oil sensually over rolling pin "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." I lost it Lmfao
argh its torture :T i wanna see that homemade hot pocket episode :V
Could have easily done cinnamon rolls from better call Saul, where they make them like 6 times
You forgot to spread the dough with 18 pounds of butter per square inch
Please do the foods from Once Upon A Time in America!!!
I really, really hate cooking. But I really, super love watching you cook. Keep up the awesome work. Such a great channel.
i like pizza
godly
?????? "as god intended"?????? 5:25 sec
Good on you for the honest mistakes. I've been consistently impressed with you as a YouTuber and I hope you keep producing content. Great Stuff Babish!
Has Jim Gaffigan ever actually been funny about anything? He's almost on the same level as Springfields "What's up with that?"
Make orange marmalade from Paddington!
when i was a girl scout, every single year for christmas we got together for a gift exchange and to make cinnamon rolls. i was a scout for about 10 or so years (i mean, once a scout, always a scout, but you get the picture) and it was what i always looked forward to most. these cinnamon rolls were absolutely melt in your mouth. we barely gave them time to cool and they just dissolved, so sugary sweet it was like heaven. it's been nearly 10 years since i last had one of those suckers and think about them more often than i probably should. i ran into my troop leader a few weeks ago, and asked her for the recipe and she said maybe we can all get together again for a reunion - and of course, cinnamon rolls. my little heart can hardly wait.
Why are you destroying a wonderful Scandinavian pastry by drowning it in cake icing? It's also way too thick, lacks cardamom and has almost no cinnamon in it.
“I’m using this as an excuse” Just say u wanted some cinnamon rolls
Do we have to use egg
You should do dorm style foods
I absolutely LOOOVE Cinnabons!!!!! Too bad I can't buy them where I live :(
Maybe you should make apple cake
In the movie Gamer the kid asked for a sandwich with every "butter" the could find: peanut butter, almond butter, ect. It would make for good content I think
Please make Foods from Seinfeld part 2
Rat Burger, Demolition Man
Just did some research and found that Luis ck. took the joke, not the other way around.
No cardamom? These are heathen cinnamon rolls.
388,943rd view
I have to pay to see all the episodes now? Can't say I blame you, but I'm really not happy ether.
Foods from the Marvel Netflix shows would be a good one. So Wilson Fisks breakfast from Daredevil, some whiskey based cocktails inspired by Jessica Jones and some of the asian cuisine in Iron Fist. Cant think of anything for Luke Cage atm but its been a while since I watched it.
Slowly spreads oil on rolling pin "so once you have gotten to know your rolling pin"
Damn these look delicious. I learned to make cinnamon rolls from my nanna (she wasn't actually my grandma but she was as good as), and she always put down a thicc layer of butter on the rolled out dough before all the cinnamon-sugar; so, if you're looking for an extra dose of decadence, give it a shot!
As God intended ??????
Loved the extra footage of learning from your mistakes. Would love to see more stuff ups and fixes in the future
Or from Better Call Saul.....
Please do the most expensive mc1035 from archer
In Maya Rudolph hormone monster voice make whatever you want daddy, I won’t judge
Do the krusty burgers from the Simpson’s or well known as skinners “steamed hams”
Could have used the Homer Simpson clip of him wrapped up like a big toasty cinnamon bun.
2:17
Make a time lapse of bread rising
better call saul could have worked.
Better call Saul Pimento sandwich???
I'm glad you found an excuse to make cinnamon rolls!
You HAVE to butter the sheet of dough before putting the cinnamon and sugar on and rolling! It’s the most important step :( idk how people eat dry ass rolls
You should’ve put bacon grease on the table
Oh nice youtube is becoming a patreon/twitch copy, how wonderful.
they're beautiful
Today in my foods class while cooking I said “let those flavors get to know each other” and my teacher gave me extra credit for being clever??????
You should make 1 of the meals that the Palico make in Monster Hunter World or all of them
For better cuts for cinnamon roles use butchers twine or unflavored floss, tie it around and gently squeeze to make better cuts
Those rolls would of came out 100x times better if you 1 Before you sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar you brush on Crisco (Shorting) and 2. add a little bit of vanilla in frosting, anyone trying this trust me just covering the dough with shorting before the sprinkle will make a night and day difference
Do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil.
“Once you’ve got to know your rolling pin” then rubs it up and down ??
hmm too creamy..... ADD MORE CREAM!!!
”Getting to know your rolling pin”
"it's too creamy so I'll add cream" Idk why this made me laugh
5:19 "as we extradite..." did you mean EXTRICATE?? ; )
Regular show, Microwave wings
But what makes bread bread is the shape of it that let's you cut it into a slice?
And what resulted was a truly delicious cinnamon roll
If you guys wonder how he knows that the dough is 14 inches. He uses my dong as measurement.
I feel like this could have totally been a Better Call Saul reference.
Should do animal shaped chicken tenders
Looks so good!
you nailed it the 2nd time around, looks amazing. But mistakes are just as delicious!
what is the specific plastic wrap that you use?
Star baker! Love it, could you use custard?
In the bakery i used to work in i was the cinnamon roll guy, made about 10 dozen a day. We never frosted ours, i would put maple syrup and pecans on the bottom which became the top when flipped over to get them out, 7 in a 12 inch tray and thats how we sold them.
Someone please .. i beg you.. comment the ingredients in gramm/kilogramm etc..
First I finally buy your cookbook and then you upload? Best. Day. Ever.
Beef jerky from the Simpsons!
Hi Babish, don't know if you'll ever read this or even care, but in my location we don't have access to channel memberships and it's really depressing that I'm missing an upload because of it!
Babish they are releasing a fallout 76 cook book and was wondering if you’d make some recipes from it
I want to see the Monkfish Turkey from Malcolm in the Middle. Probably impossible.
Want a better flavour profile for the cinnamon rolls? Add a splash of vanilla and lemon extract to the frosting, and use only brown sugar in the cinnamon/sugar mix. I used to work at Cinnabon, and these were things we did there. Otherwise, everything is on point!
I can smell them lol
Make the cheesecake from friends
Bro why do u want so much fucking money from your fans you already have a Patreon for no reason, it’s not to fund your content you already make enough money to buy everything you need for your videos. Stop selling out and looking for every single oppurtunity to make more money and instead let YouTube be what it was meant to be in the first place which is a space for unique, creative content that is free for users.
Seems too creamy... adds cream. — ya boy Babish, 2018
I put a stick of melted butter on the cinnamon sugar mixture, before I roll it, it makes the rolls gooier, more like Cinnabon.
It's really interesting because the swedish recepie is kinda different but also the same. The dough is the same, but we also sread it with butter and then add the cinnamon and sugar. We cut it and then place them individually in a muffinpaper on a bakingsheet and put them in the oven. You could also switch the cinnamon for either vanilla and almonds or cardamon and sugar. Also we don't really put icing on them, that's weird.
Did rolling pin even buy you dinner? Monster
Anyone else think of Skyrim’s sweet rolls?
4:08 Too creamy? Add cream
OMG HE SHOULD DO THE “TO THE MAX” SANDWICH FROM WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
Please do Paddingtons orange jam
Hmmmmmm...... Too creamy....... Needs cream.
This guy is such a low key savage
So they are basically Chelsea Buns, just without the dried fruit and instead of a basic stock syrup glaze, a cream cheese frosting? Meh.
We can support him on patreon, now we can pay money in the channel also, and in addition to that watch videos that are sponsored and affect the content of the videos. We can buy his books and shop for things from his website. Are we done merchandising or not quite yet? I was a fan very early, but it has become concerning.
Sorry Babish but you missed a key ingredient You needed to spread a whole stick of butter on the flattened dough before you covered it in sugar. Trust me, I worked at Cinnabon for a couple of years.
Who else likes ikea cinnamon buns?
Thank you I've been craving cinnamon rolls
5:19 Jesus fucking Christ I just want to dive in there and build a shelter and have a family and kids and a happy life forever. Thank you
Too creamy - adds more cream
babish kinda reaching these days
Try going for the Swedish original: Butter the spread dough before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar mix, and instead of frosting sprinkle with granulated sugar. Also, crowd them even less - don't let them touch at all.
make foods from trailer park boys, to celebrate legalisation in canada
I've never not laughed harder than at that opening scene.
The frosting is a little TOO creamy, so let's add some cream. ??
That’s sweet that you learned from your mistakes, thank you!! Also, can you make a video on tempering chocolate? I’m trying to make some decorations for a birthday. Any help is appreciated! ??

Ill take all of them thanks
Have you made any vegan/vegetarian dishes before? I think that’d be pretty cool to see.
Am I the only millennial who knows who this amazing man whom we call Jim is?
Try Swedish cinnamon rolls, it's very similar but add cardamom in the dough (instead of lemon zest), mix the sugar and a lot of cinnamon with butter and spread that instead of sprinkle it on the dough. Brush them with egg instead of butter and sprinkle sugar nibs on them (no frosting). ??
thank you america for making it impossible to recreate any of your recipes. seriously who measures things in ounces?
When i saw the cinnamon rolls, i thought they were from Better Call Saul. Let's just say that so you don't have to make a video on them again
Please make the cup of joe from the polar express

HOT TAKE!!!! I LOVE THE CLEAR BOWL!!!.... Being able to see what is happening in the bowl really give me a better idea of what im looking for!! Not sure if you just got the bowl or I just noticed it but well done my friend!!
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" lmao
the fact that you put in your mistakes makes me think you dont actually make many in the other videos. I sometimes add too much milk to my bowl of cereal
Let me guess someone stole your cinnamon roll?
Do this more often. Show us your process and how many times it took you cooking the same meal to get it right.
How about secret life of Walter Mitty? There's cinnabon there
This looks awesome. I just can't get the logistics right on when I should start this in time for breakfast. Way early one morning? Or let it ferment overnight?
Would love to see you do a Collaboration with Mike Chen from Strictly Dumpling on different Chinese Food, since you both live in NYC ??

Make food from Red Dwarf!
I wanna see exclusive episodes!!! But I'm broke af!
My mom made the best cinnamon rolls. I really miss my mom. ??
You need to butter the inside before adding the spice mix, it helps the sugars caramelize and be extra gooey. Soak large golden raisins in a dark spicy rum, the longer the better, we usually go at least a year. Include those in the middle too, they become pockets of caramelized rum.
"Too creamy. Lets add cream" lol
Can you make a hot pocket out of cinnamon rolls? audible gasp Death pocket
DIDN'T sit in it, not legit
“ but if you ask me, a little too creamy” adds heavy cream
Your solo vids sound way happier than your sponsored ones btw
Thought it was cheese in the Thumpnail
This is so wierd. This is not at all how we do them in Sweden.
too creamy, let me just add some cream
Another great vid dude! Really enjoy your channel!
Could you do a Naruto episode please.
Brisket please (young Sheldon works)
Oh No! Andrew, I get the Monetization, of course, have the adverts pay you. I get the Patreon, let your loyal followers create your salary, all while absolutely having access to your episodes earlier than everyone else. BUT PLEASE don't start creating content on YouTube that I can only see if I pay a monthly subscription for your channel. 4.99 is a lot for just one channel when ALL of netflix is 7.99. I can't afford it as much as I think you deserve it. Why sell out on this when you've already been able to profit off of Monetization, Patreon, and the Blue Apron Sponsorship? I won't stop loving your show! I'm just a little disappointed.
Funny enough I was like I really want some Cinnamon rolls and here this is....I'm being tempted
Cinibun from the secret life of Walter Mitty
I used to manage a cinnabon when I was younger those things are the most unhealthy things ever but God are they delicious

“An excuse to make cinnamon rolls”? That offends me my good sir, there is no such thing as an excuse to make cinnamon buns, you make it because you want sweet, doughy, gooey delicious goodness
Could you brush the rolls with egg wash before baking instead of just butter?
So far your the only one giving special content like episodes to your members thats just mean to us with lesser money to not see your great cooking. That hurts since as far as i see your my only sub on youtube whos doing it like this.
"A little bit too creamy" "Gonna thin this out with some cream"
try them with sourdough starter!
Hey you should do a Wok special showing/celebrating the diversity of what can be cooked in wok as well as the special flavors and styles only a wok can produce! I guess that would be more of a basics with babish episode

You could have called this Cinnabuns from Daddy’s Home ^^the breakfast scene
Could you do garlic bread from Scott pilgrim vs the world
I've never been a patreon before but Babish makes me want to.
I had a dream where this was called binging with barrack and it was great
Honestly those ‘wrongly’ made cinnamon buns weren’t all that bad. I’d enjoyably consume them ??
Gotta unsubscribe, sorry Babish. I don't like that I have to watch ads, sponsorship messages and now I miss episodes if I don't pay extra. Best of luck to you.
"it's a little bit too creamy" .. **adds more cream**
I would love to Join your channel or support you on Patreon, but I am sadly poor. Any chance of releasing the "exclusive" content at a later time, like say six months after Patreon/Youtube subscribers get access? I try to support the channel with my Twitch Prime every month, I figure it's the least I can do, because you're one of my favorite content creators on YouTube. I say "one of" because you and FoodBusker are the only two channels I watch religiously (and god help me if you two ever get together for a collab)
How bout the Ed sauce from Good Burger

Can you make a really big cinnamon roll like a giant single lol
Please make Bill Gannon's barbecue sauce from Dragnet!
To make Cinnabon style you needed to roll that dough out to 14x28. Paper thin. That is how you get so many layers like they do.
This is the first time I've seen (or can remember) Babish advertise himself. More power to you, it's much deserved.
i'm pretty sure someone probably said this but I think the ultimate challenge for Babish to make is the edible strings from Mouse Trap.
Hey Babish! Love your stuff, got me in the Kitchen! Any chance you could make space food or have a space theme from Apollo 13, the Martian, etc? Would be awesome!
A little too creamy LETS ADD SOME CREAME

No mistakes, just happy accidents.

How is that a little known fact. It's the most obvious thing ever. You can see that it has been rolled just by looking at it.
I really like the idea of leaving mistakes in. People like me (who don't do baking very much) would love to see things that can go wrong, because I probably would've done the same things.

So I know someone with a dairy allergy (like anaphylactic shock serious if they have butter/milk/cheese), how would this work with margarine for the rolls and instead of a cream cheese icing making meringue and glazing it over about midway through cooking?
As a Halloween special or something..It would be awesome if you made some of the outrageous meals described in American Psycho.. ??
fuck mE UPPPPPP
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
WHY FROSTING ON THE CINNAMONBUN??!!
They look a little dry compared to cinnabon, don't they?
dangerous path that extra stuff, Babish. So long as you don't neglect to make a vid when you usually would for your regular subscribers I don't see any harm though.
Quit pronouncing the T in soften. You sound retarded.
Another thing you should have done is put butter inside lf them helps them unroll and they are just so much tastier
make something from food wars please god

Finally! Someone else uses a serated knife to cut cinnamon rolls! I like the idea of oiling the work surface and the rolling pin! I'll definitely give that a try when I make my caramel pecan cinnamon rolls next! Thanks for the video ????
When you were oiling the rolling pin, I could hear Cocktail Chemistry making his classic, "Shaking the shaker in a non suggestive manner" joke.
Hey um do the ribs from Norbit at the wedding scene
Is using the mixer essential or can i do this by hand???
sorry, a swed cant accept the way you guys make a cinnamon bun
Liked before watching because cinnaman roll
You need to spread soft butter before cinnamon and sugar! At least thats what we do in Finland, the home of cinnamon rolls ;) you can never have too much butter or sugar
Mmmmh kanelsnegl ??
I thought your first mistake was rolling the dough with cinnamon and sugar. Usually when I see cinnamon rolls made, it's more of a cinnamon paste rather than just the cinnamon sugar. But hey, it's your recipe.
Hey guys! Ever cook the pre-made Pillsbury cinnamon rolls? Hack: Use a muffin sheet if you want them individually cooked to perfection.

I need more Babish in my life??
I don't want you to do this. Don't make bonus episodes just for people that pay. You're not gonna make enough from this. It'll effect your upload time and your community. Trust me. It's not a good idea, you have enough money from Patreon and YouTube.
Sweet role from Skyrim next
Was that clip supposed to be funny at the beginning?
"Screwed up royally" = rolls were uneven and didnt frost fast enough
i like to think that this is an episode on better call saul
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!
Not from better call saul?
You can honestly just use powderd suggar and water for the frosting Tastes better in my opinion
@binging with babishyou should make cinnabon delights from taco bell
Mixture too creamy ? No problem, just add more cream !
You know, this idea of "I'll show you where I messed up so you don't repeat my mistakes" thing was a great touch. Shows you're not infallible and helps us avoid those same mistakes at the same time.
oh now you’ve done it
On what number should you set the mixer to

"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." X'D i died.
2:17 lmao
You actually made 4 mistakes. For true soft and circular rolls use was free or very light waxed floss to cut the roll. Try it. My mom uses this technique when she makes cinnamon rolls and it will up your presentation by four levels guaranteed.
Great Job Babish!!!! They look fantastic! I challenge you to make them gluten free, my wife has celiac and can't eat your standard buns!!!
RIP - can you do a bonus recipe for an alternative frosting that has no cream cheese? Vanilla or another variant would be dope.
Aaw, I would’ve liked to see homemade hot pockets.
Can u put that intro song in again!!!
First mistake is just how we used to make ours growing up. Nostalgic.exe
Hey Babs! I love your videos. You should consider doing the food platter shown in Monster Hunter World. I'd love to see that feast come to life!
So now google/youtube doesn't pay you and we directly have to? This has become a lot worse than TV Cable subscription. I could get 2 channels for that price with 24 hr entertainment.
Better Call Saul Cinnabons
Okay, here a little bit of feedback: 1. I love that you put in the mistakes you made, it really shows a little bit more behind the thought process and entices you to experiment yourself. Maybe you can make a future episode, which shows the process of coming up with a recipe. 2. I kind of dislike the idea of the exclusive babish episodes. I myself am a patreon, so this doesn't apply to me, but I feel like the great and active members of the community get kicked out a little bit, if they can't afford to support monetarily. My feeling is, that this is a bit different from additional videos like Behind the Scenes or QnA. I dunno, I really would have liked to have all the content for everybody, I don't mind paying for people who can't. That's the end of my feedback, hope you're doing great =D EDIT: Wow, so many people take this to heart, really cool to see a relaxed and respectful discussion. To you Andrew, don't think I am mad, I don't think of you as a greedy person or something like that, it is only my own feeling of leaving some people behind. I can totally understand, that increasing the patreon incentive is a smart thing to do and probably YouTube requires some exclusive stuff, to be able to enable channel memberships. So whether you decide to stay at what you said, special episode for patreons and channel members, you decide to release them for everybody or you decide to release them to the public after 2 weeks or so, I stand behind you because I know that you are just a guy who is passionate for cooking and that is why I subscribed to you.
good video babbi!
louis ck's cinnabon bit was better but i get you can't use that
I've been watching your channel for a long time. I pay for some single serving content, but I think asking for 5 dollars a month to get exclusive episodes is crossing a line. I enjoy your videos, and watch ads. I'm slightly disappointed in this decision. Thanks for making great videos Babish.
The entire point of YouTube is that it’s free
Babish, what's makes cooking fun? Just wondering
When life gives you lemons, fuck up cinammon roles with it. Lel just an opinion
Mmm cinnamon bun my favorite after chocolate cake but before tres leches cake ????????????
Americans put cheese on everything... surprised it's not deep fried after baking.
As GOD intended lmaoo
babish is basic babish is binging
i think that was THE single most unfunny comedy routine i have ever seen.
For Cinnabon you need to use indonesian korintje cinnamon

“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ????
I like when they grow into each other. it makes it more chewey than crispy.
I think my family are the only people who use dental floss to cut our cinnamon rolls...it baffles me, it's way better than a knife.
@babish you should of used a cinnamon sugar butter instead of sprinkling sugar cinnamon. It helps by adding more moisture to the rolls.
Im seeing all these new uploads but i still havent seen a proper naco video yet. Hmmm.
hmmm, a little too creamy. Better add some cream.
2:17 i see what you did there babby
Not as good as kanelbullar
Watching this at 12:45 AM. SO JEALOUS ????
How about making some of the mediocre-1970s English dishes from Fawlty Towers??
you should of used a clip from better call saul when he is working at the cinnabon
I know its cinnamon bun, but I miss going to the mall as a kid and watching people make pretzels.
You could have used Better Call Saul as your excuse. They even have a montage of him making the actual Cinnabons.

I feel like you used to make more effort sourcing the best ingredients and making it very gourmet. Now you just make basic recipes with ordinary ingredients.
Excuse you, did you just pronounce the "t" in soften?
but...wait...WHERE. IS. THE. BUTTER???? Arent' they supposed to be slathered with butter before dusting with cinnamon (AND SUGAR!)? That's how we do it in Sweden at least.
What's the difference between oiling a work surface and flouring it
The day has come!!! Thanks Babish!!!
Swedish cinnamon buns are the best. way easier to make and way tastier. (not as sweet as this version) but to each their own. :)
Started my diet yesterday Babish releases this video SHIT
Anyone else think he made these mistakes on purpose in order to make a more in depth video? Also was having trouble sleeping last night so decided to get to know my rolling pin, slept like a baby after that.
I love when you include your mistakes because I guarantee I'd make them
2:20 why do you want it to not stick to nothing? surely you want it to stick to nothing or not stick to anything? basacly you want it to stick to everything so why add the oil?
what if i dont have one of those fancy dough machines
For some reason cream cheese frosting make me feel sick unless I think of it for carrot cake
Wonder if consciously excluded to add in the Louis ck cinnabon bit
I've never requested a dish before, but know I know what I want. Do the pineapple upside down cake from the Penguins of Madagascar cartoon series.??
4:10 says frosting is too creamy adds cream
was that stand up meant to be funny?
watching this while eating chick fil a.... heaven

No no no! You should butter the bun dough before sprinkling on the sugar and cinnamon! It not only helps to keep the cinnamon-sugar inside the rolled up dough, but makes the bun itself taste so much better! All and all there’s too little butter in this recipe. Adding butter will help the dough rise and makes it taste way better!
Could've used skyrim....
Can’t wait to make these
Babish YES! Please do more stand up related dishes.
Babish is cashing in. Good for you
How about a short series on homemade versions of Chinese takeout? Like crab rangoon, orange chicken, lo mein, etc.
Oh for christsake. 4.95 a month to watch you cook? I better get a frigging cinnamon roll sent to my house each month then
Who else would joyfully eat that "mistake batch"?
Good call not using Louis CK's stand up for cinnamon rolls.
Could you stop using retarded measures like ounces for the rest of the world please?
Theres a REALLY good Cinnabon clone recipe floating around. It is my favorite one. THe cinnamon filling is more of a shmear though so its nice and gooey when warm.
I'm gonna gesture toward these cinnamon sticks.
swedish cinnamonbuns are better
Nice to see some mistakes! Thanks for keeping them in.
Mistakes happen, and are always enjoyable. Thanks for sharing. Some orange zest in the frosting is also a good thing. Works for Rice Krispie treats too.

God I love Jim Gaffigan, great to see some love for one of my favourite comedians
Ahhhhh!!! That looks so good!!!!
I haven't tried this recipe yet, but my mom does a few things a little differently so I thought I'll leave this here in case anyone wants to try it out: 1.) Butter the inside of your dough with melted butter before applying the sugar mixture. Don't use to much though or I guess they might come out greasy. 2.) Brush the top of your buns with eggwash or simply a beaten yolk instead of butter. 3.) I prefer powdered sugar on the buns instead of frosting them. The frosting is just too heavy and sweet for my taste. You could also try glazing them with a mix of powdered sugar and lemon juice, that's a popular option here in Germany. I don't have any measures, but just keep adding powdered sugar to your lemon juice and whisking it until you like the taste and have a smooth glaze. If you want more lemon flavor put some zest in aswell. And for some other variations you can put dried fruits or cocoa in the dough and use different fillings. Chopped nuts mixed with some sugar are great, or my personal favorite: a mix of poppy seeds, some milk and sugar.
What is the wrap on the bowls?

fuck you and your membership you greedy pig, yo already have advert friendly content and a patreon. YOU HAVE 3 MILLION SUBS seriously this membership thing is stupid and over-priced. I'm not spending 5 dollars every month for exclusive tiny pics of your face your douchebag. you have time for extra videos? why not give back extra content to your regular fan base? oh wait no you could charge hella money for that so noooo you have a drug problem or something? why do you need a patreon, channel memberships, and a massive income from your regular programming? how much money can a pig have?
Didn’t even watch the video, just came to say that cinnamon rolls are my favorite food

I love cinnamon buns. However, I would really really recommend adding heavy cream instead of butter brushed to the top before baking. It makes them extremely soft and more similar to that mall place that is known for selling buns.
For a swedish take on the classic cinnamon roll: mix cinnamon and sugar with room temperatured butter, spread out evenly before rolling up the dough. make's the roll much more moist and tasty. Don't line up in a deep dish, put them spaced out on lined baking tray. Wipe down with melted butter och one beaten egg, cover in decor sugar (is that what it's called?) Don't wait until cooled down from the oven, consume way to many, feel stuffed but know that it's worth it.
Plz make food
hey how about making the Nobby Buns and the Brownie topping recipes from the end credits of the film , Hot Shots?
"Too creamy" then proceeds to add heavy cream
Question, am I the only one that thought the mistake was NOT putting a layer of butter on the dough before the cinnamon sugar mix? Or is that a southern thing? I mean I come from a long line of southern big mammas, and heaven forbid you not put butter in that dough!

well done. i'm glad you caught your mistakes and fixed them. i was definitely cringing when i saw you making those mistakes... i find, you don't really need to thin out the cream cheese icing if you ice right away after the buns come out of the oven... the residual heat immediately softens and melts the cream cheese icing...

I really appreciate you putting your failed attempt in this video as a method for teaching!

Thanks for keeping it real and reminding us that cooking can be trial and error :)

I work at a cinnabon, those buns are between the size of a mini and a classic size, we actually cut and frost them right when they come out of the oven (which you frosted but didn't cut them), we have a metal spatula that is serrated on one side so when we cut them we aren't pinching them, plus we are told that when we roll them that the swirl must have at least wrap around 5-6 times, and we don't use oil when rolling the dough we use flour, idk if you want any of this info, I know from the standup he specifically said cinnabon, but those cinnamon rolls look 100000% better than the ones we make at work and I'm gonna use that recipe sometime

Cutting the dough with a knife misshaped the buns! Cut them by wrapping them with twine and pulling the ends quickly
Please always do it like this when you screw up. But yeah, 5 bucks a month ain't happening. You're cool but you're not as useful as Spotify.
Maybe you should do some more food wars, the last one was amazing
Listen Bab, I love ya and your recipes, but you need to put butter inside of the cinnamon rolls. You can’t just sprinkle some loose cinnamon sugar onto the dough! You need either lather that dough in some butter (melted or soft works) and then sprinkle OR mix the soft butter right into the cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon paste.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that good ole Babby completely screwed up the Naco
So who actually prefers a cinnamon bun over a stickey bun?
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin.” ??????
Why do you not give a fuck about the audience using real units?

A time lapse of the dough growing would a be cool for future episodes
Now a premium membership does sound nice. I'm happy to see you're doing great man.

Hey babish, this might seem like a dull idea but it's been something I've wanted since 2005 and they discontinued the product in the UK but is there any chance you can see about making turkey twizzlers? they were a favourite during my childhood and if there is a way to recreate them I'd love to try it.
You should try the Cherry Glazed Rack of Lamb from "How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days"!
I am so freaking happy you did an episode on cinnamon rolls!!! Since they are my all time favourite food! You know you could have also picked Better call Saul since he's a manager in a Cinnabon.
Please try to collab with Alton Brown! You guys are my two favorite food people!
Can you try to find a dish from dragon ball z for thanks giving
You should make Chidi's Peeps and Chilli from The Good Place
Uh mistake number 1 was not putting butter before rolling. Wtf
Here is where you messed up. You have to add small pads of butter evenly distributed along with the cinnamon sugar mixture then roll it up and proceed as normal. As the rolls cook the butter melts and mixes with the cinnamon and sugar and creates a candy caramel coating that flows to the bottom of the buns and makes them Elevate to a whole new level.
and im back as a subscriber no cheesy commercial :D this is the banging with babish i love to watch <3
Please do food from skyrim or fallout. Sweet rolls and sugar bombs :P
I get you want to make a living out of youtube and i still will watch all of your vids and i still love your channel but making me miss out on hot pockets God damn
Please do the feast from "Fantastic Mr. Fox" or another Wes Anderson movie
Make the cheesesteaks from Creed!!!
or go buy one at cinnabon
As a swede these buns/rolls dissapoint me, but its Babish so its okay.
Mistake number two was still followed, try making them on a sheet without them touching. Also you should make monkey bread (any flavor) I think with help it’d join the clean plate club
So you made finnish bostoninkakku minus the frosting
If you could make the turtle or dragon bread from the 17th episode of Yakitate Japan that would be impressive.
Watching this makes me hungry for cinnamon rolls. Also, apparently, my cat loves to watch your videos and loves your voice o.O
Slightly disappointed that it wasn't bean bagchair sized. 8/10
Way to little cinnamon in that mixture might as well call it brown sugar roll! Swedish cinnamon buns are way better ??
This is not how me make them in Sweden ??
I have watched your ENTIRE channel in like 3 days. You are incredible ????????

Babby you made content exclusive with a pay wall. That defeats the point of YouTube come on now. It's okay though because you make an effort to put out public videos frequently so it's no Biggie. Please don't make all your content behind a paywall in the future though
You should do Chicken Pinciotti from That 70’s Show.
I thought with cinnamon rolls you're supposed to cut them with an unflavored floss or string since a knife would make the dough in the spirals stick together

Nitpicking with Babish.
These Memberships really do me in... if every channel does them and you want to see this extra content, you will spend a fortune when you pay 5 $ a month for each channel you like and want to be able to see this stuff. I really don‘t understand this anymore - YT was for free and now we have Premium Memberships that also costs monthly... that all just ain‘t fun anymore in my book. Love BwB but I feel like paying for cable TV these days here on YT.
@Binging With Babish, if you were to spread making these starting night before, could you do first proof overnight in fridge, then simply roll, cut, and final proof in morning?

The good place chidi Do his chilly it is in one of the 1st 3 episodes on season 3 it is on netflix
We used to put the in aluminum muffin tins at work, paint them with butter, then wrap and freeze. Then as we needed them we could pop out a tin, chuck it in the proofer, and then bake them off for the best cinnamon bun french toast you could ever imagine!
Absolutely loved seeing the mistakes on this. They taught me so much and I am sure not thinks less your skill and the entertainment of your videos. Great job and thank you so much.
Man, I have had cinnamon buns on my mind. There is this place I go that makes cinnamon twists and I can’t figure out how they make the twist.
im gay
Babish is on a roll
I don't like American cinnamon buns. Frosting should not be there it just overpowers everything else and just makes it taste like sugar. I like the swedish ones
Too creamy? Add cream!
My god its magnificent

Can you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil?
bab ish
I used to work a Cinnabon. Not a perfect recreation but still looks good. You missed the crucial step of buttering the dough before spreading the cinnamon and sugar mixture. I guess the melted butter step kind of replaces that. Rolling away from you looks awkward, we we're all trained to roll toward us.
Is that reusable plastic wrap?
4:10 cooking just makes so much sence the stuff is too creamy so what do you do add cream genious also really cinnamon rolls ( imade them with my mum following this video :ok hand:)

Make some dishes from naruto like the ramen
I hate to tell you Babish, but you used the wrong recipe this time. The only cinnamon bun recipe worthy of being present amongst a table of gods is the cinnabon clone recipe on google. It is fluffy and moist and springy in ways the human mouth does not fully appreciate until you bite into one of these bad boys. Its also the first recipe I actually changed and didn't completely destroy. It calls for 600g strong bread flour but if you use 400g only and another 200g of fine sponge cake flour the dough is even more bubbly and delectable. You definitely need to try this.
I could go for some of those Hooooot Pooockeeeeets.

Am I missing out? I've never seen a glass bowl on a stand mixer.
americans always ruin things
This looks great, but i thought the point was to attempt to make The Cinnabon? The ones you made are tiny. A true Cinnabon should be huge! It should make you question your life's decisions. A true Cinnabon is what the great comedian and pervert Louis C.K. called a "fat fuck treat". The ones you made look far too healthy. Perhaps change the title of the video to "Healthier Cinnamon Rolls"
I made some cinnamon rolls a while back for a project and made the EXACT same mistakes you did. Thanks for this video!
Dang, I thought this was gonna be the size of a bean bag chair
Lol, Andrew apologising for screwing up the first batch like we wouldn't definitely go in on them anyway
Nice video as always! Could you do some foods from Tom and Jerry? For instance, the Bouillabaise in Jerry and the Goldfish.
The cinnamon rolls look delicious but what I really want to know is where I can get that sweet watch.
I guess every YouTube account has to change at some point. Sad to see this one do the same. Now we got to play for certain videos? You turned into one of those girls on tinder that has a premium Snapchat...
Make the pancakes John Candy made in Uncle Buck
What about the jimmy neutron purple flurp?
This channel members thing seems like abit of a YouTube after thought to compete with or At least merge patreon features. I follow four people who have it now and honestly $15 a month for YouTube videos and a sticker or two seems expensive.
Please the good place episode!
I wish i can grab those cinnamon rolls from my phone
I think Louis C.K. described Cinabunns much better, but I guess he's a non-grata still.
Babish has so many cute, random and downright hilarious quotes I'd wear on shirts Everything burrito: it's not the amount of meat, it's how you treat the meat Any video that includes Worcestershire sauce: a hilarious attempt in pronunciation This video: After you Physically and Philosophically wash your hands!

It always fascinates me how different American cinnamon rolls are from Swedish ones. I just don't get it. There are few things as good as a good, proper cinnamon bun, but to then make them all giant and baked together into a slab and slathered in painfully sweet frosting? Probably the biggest food related culture shock I've ever experienced tbh ??
Wow I don't have anything to make this
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” lol
Thats a nice wrist watch. +10 points
Hot Take: You could have picked a better comedian and a better show by making the Cinnabons from Better Call Saul. Bob Odenkirk is a national treasure.
'a little too creamy' Adds heavy cream
Yum yum Cinnabon ??
Spaghetti Tacos from ICarly. GO!
bro butter on frosting?? thats a no for me
Could have just done a basics on pastries instead of reaching like this
Get to know your rolling pin ( ?° ?? ?°)
That's not at all what I picture when I think cinnamon rolls/buns
Louis C.K. did a great take on that too in his standup. Since I watched it I cannot force myself to eat another one of those.
I've never seen someone make the filling with dry cinnamon and sugar, I've always done it and seen it by mixing the two powders with softened or melted butter. I'mma try the dry mix next time! Also! I might join just for the hot pockets episode!!

Two way that Andrew gets to excuse himself to make a thing: 1) Make a Basics episode out of it. 2) Use the smallest mention of it to make an episode.

Do you have a video breaking down the accessories you have on your mixer that I missed? From what I can tell, you're using a lot of the basics, but as I just got my wife a stand mixer recently, we've been tackling some of your dough recipes and would love some advice/tips on good things to have for it all.

Your excuse should have been Better Call Saul
That tiny spatula though
Do the napolitan pasta from Girls und Panzer
I love synonym rolls ??
It looked perfect.... Until you said “cream cheese frosting” :’(
Make some one piece dishes
A bit too creamy adds cream
""special episodes for $5 a month" finally a premium program I'm willing to subscribe to
Wayyyy better than the ones I had at school.
But does anyone know how they make it so gooey!
i was really hoping that this youtube membership thing wouldn't start the trend of creators having exclusive videos to those people who pay for it. but i guess it was only a matter of time before stupid shit like that happened.
Can you please narrate audio books?
that drip of icing made my morning
channel membership...
Bibadi bobadi Bacon!!!
I am now so hungry I want to eat the world. NEED cinnamon rolls!
Make Halloween caramel apples
2:16 "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." I see what you did there, lol.
Dude, you should just make a Jim Gaffigan special.
wow yummy
wait wait wait, let me get this straight. You said the icing was "too creamy" and to thin it you added cream. dafuq!!!!!
"sofTen"
Can you post recipes in metric for the rest of the world?
Omg ... so delicious
Can you make Burple Nurples from Chowder?
You should make Chief Wiggum’s chili with the ‘merciless pepper of Quetzalacatenango’
I like how you admit to mistakes and then show how to correct them.
My buns are toasty from just watching this
Cover me with icing babish
You should have made it from better call saul
Emojis Babish? Emojis? Really?
I understand Youtube is going downhill and you need to do different things to get more revenue, but the day content goes behind a paywall is the day i shed a little tear.
Cinnamon buns is my kind of treat
Impressive, but can you make the ET Malt from the movie Paul?
Could you make pickle rick!!!!!!
What brand is that watch you’re wearing?
Do I have to use instant yeast? All I have on hand is pizza yeast.
alright guys lets be real how much ass do you think babish gets
Hey, this might be abit to ask for, and I don't think you'll read all the comments, but I'm finding these really hard to follow. And by this I mean all recipes because I'm Gluten Free. Celiac makes cooking really hard and I would love it if you could make some dough or break or cake that was gluten free. Thanks for the hours of delicious looking entertainment ??
I like to think of these from the Louis CK stand up (love gaffigan too) Gimme the jizz syrup!! ??
It'd be really cool if you did the spaghetti al nero di seppia from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency!
How do you philosophy wash your hands?
Use mineral oil! It helps with the sticky dough and its flavorless.
Jim Gaffigan is hilarious
I miss the times when I can still eat cinnamon rolls ??
Since the cinnamon bun originates from Sweden/Denmark, you should try the Scandinavian recipe! It's super simple, almost the same as you did. Add some ground cardamom to the cinnamon mixture (maybe half around 33/67 with cardamom/cinnamon). Then slice them a bit thinner, about 3/4 of the thickness you did. Then they need to be baked completely separated from each other, so they turn out as individual beautiful cinnamon buns. And final step: ABSOLUTELY NO FROSTING! That is blasphemy. But instead, before baking: brush them with some beaten egg and sprinkle on some pearl sugar/nib sugar and then bake. Voila, authentic Swedish cinnamon buns :)
Ok I think this stretching the theme of the show a bit. I think babish just really wanted to make cinnamon rolls
Hello, everyone, my grandmother and I put our hearts into making food videos. We joke around as well ;D The videos are really good! We would appreciate, if you check them! :)
@2:17 nice
Looks good but cannot measure up to a woman I know, she is from the south so maybe that’s why lol. Whenever she takes in orders it’s a minimum or 17 preorders. But yes I can see why they made it too the clean plate club, too many people don’t bake them right and they end up dry and crusty, yuck!
I'm drooling over my work desk??
In Sweden we actually have a thing where we overcrowded the cinnamon rolls on purpose to create kind of a cake and it's delicious. We also mix the sugar and cinnamon with butter.
Them buns are money, honey. Now, can we do dishes from say... i dunno....Teletubbies?
Hey I get that movies and tv shows and stuff are great inspiration for recipes...but haven't you ever wanted to know what a Sweet Roll from Skyrim tastes like?
I really appreciate showing the "failed" batch. Showing that everyone makes mistakes and cooking isn't a one-and-done deal helps build confidence in budding chefs.
You have to try a Franzbrötchen from Germany! it is the best cinamon rolle/bread you will ever try! :D
Absolutely love your channel. Happy being the free subscriber though.
those are some nice buns you have there
My icing is too creamy so I'm going to add... cream!
Oh you a freak freak Babish with them sexy cinnarolls ??
Who's just here to watch and not actually make these ????
Please do a ‘Chowder’ special
thank you
I don't even care, i will eat anything babish makes. I would marry this man.
Maybe do something KETO friendly? I really love all your episodes, I just can't eat them lol
I'm just glad you didn't sit on them without pants on.
You can just make a basics vid we dont care as long as we get a video
Paid channel membership. So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.
A lot of the time I see how you do things in proximity to how I stuff things up in the kitchen and this made me feel a lot better, thank you
Hoooooooooot pockeeeet
Lucky Bastard Roommates! "Hey Babbs, I think you can do better. Reshoot."
This thumbnail made my pants stiff and my stomach growl. ??
Watching this episode mad the following line pop into my head: "Let me guess, someone stole your Sweetroll...."
Can we get a trailer park boys episode
Add some lemon juice to your cream cheese icing it makes it way better
"gotten to know your rolling pin" ????
Can you do something from My Little Pony? Like a Cherrychanga, or Chimicherry, or ChimiCherryChanga!!!
TurBriskaFil from The Big Bang Theory
What brand of Cling Film does he use? that shit sticks to everything!
Rather Membershits than Blue Aproprobullshit
A special based on the food of the animated Miyazaki films would be pretty amazing!
Your first try, wansnt a mistake, in fact I think Its great for a group of People if served in slices, like a cake
Early
Could you maybe write down the recipe?i'd like to try those cinemon rolls but it is really annoying to look it up in the video:(
Omg, is that Tiny Whisk's long lost cousin Tiny Spatula? ... I just realised those would be dope rapper names.
Ive been waiting for this video for far too long.
The depth of field is WAAAY too narrow, I really like the look but it feels really weird when you are blurred aswell, i think just keeping the background in bokeh would look much better
no hot pockets?
Should've done Cinnamon Rolls from Better Call Saul ??
synonym rolls
Emoji story ??????????????????????????????????????????????
I was hoping they were from Better Call Saul
haha Louis CK also had a Cinnabun bit.
the wheat allergy inside me is crying
We want the intro back!
This is hilarious. I just woke up and popped open a store bought cinnamon roll can and then I saw this when I scrolled through my youtube feed.
Do an Apicicus recipe!
What happens when you run out of food to make off tv shows?
Random suggestion, do the bento box that kills the scientist from the movie Isle Of Dogs (anybody who has watched the movie knows what i mean)
Hey Babish, so my wife is allergic to eggs. What would be a good generic replacement ? I always get so sad when any desert recipe you make contains eggs ! Thanks in advance.
There needs to be a M*A*S*H episode. Can do Adam's Ribs, Spam Parmesan, Water Buffalo steak, and wash it all down with Swamp-style gin.
Yasss papi
BABS! What kind of watch it that?!
i mean you couldve used a scene with no context that just shows a cinnamon roll and i think we would have been fine with the vid
4:09 "Too creamy" proceeds to add more cream
Cream cheese?! CREAM CHEESE!!! SUMMON DAVID SEYMOUR.
Too Creamy??? Adds Cream
I wish you didn't make episodes membership exclusive :/
Louie CK's bit was funnier
Hey my man babish, i suffer from cronic insomnia and so for about three years i've been watchin your show instead of looking at the ceiling and despairing . You've been a massive help over the years. Any chance in one of your vids you could say "chris says hi elise." its your channel, you do you, but it'd trip my gf out and so i'd really dig it. Do you like black dynamite?
This guy is so unfunny "Hey I'm a fat dad who naps a lot" So hilarious -_-
I’m pretty sure you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon buns Ok i just checked the description and i was right
I prefer danish pastry
Could have used the clip from better call Saul!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." Yeah, Babish.. I caught that.
How do you wash dishes with sticky dough tho
Home brewing with Babish???
Could you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Netflix's Daredevil??
liked the mistakes in the vid.
Kinda sad, that you would make some videos exclusive for the members. Wouldnt it work quite well if you let the members watch the videos way earlier than your normal subscribers and then make them available to everyone a month or so later ?
I love fresh, out of the oven, sweet, sticky Cinnamon Buns that has sugar glazed all over it
FINALLY
Thank you. Now I want but don't wanna make.
If I tell you.. can you make the biriyani from Cheeni Kum? It's a bollywood movie btw..
Did you just pronounce the "t" in soften? 5:16 hehe "cooooooool whhhheeep"
Sorry babish. YSAC uploaded but I'm back
Please Make "TurTurkeyKey" from How I met Your Mother for your thanksgiving special
You should do a series of videos on school lunches. We used to have these Italian dunkers that you could probably perfect.
Better Call Saul
So, boys'n'gals, sit and enjoy a story of cinnamon roll (CR) heaven. Li'l old me, barely 23 years of age was taking a vacation in the states, driving up from Frisco to Seattle with my family. (I'm originally from Germany and have only heard of CR pureness at that point.) We stop at the tiniest private-owned gas station, go inside to pay for the gas. The owner's that big, beardy, tattooed dude who'd pass as an actor in Sons of Anarchy any day. He's got the usual assortment of snacks, hot dogs and this tray of cinnamon buns. I'm curious (and still hungry) and buy one of those. I go outside, take a bite, stop, take another bite and then turn around on my heels to buy two more of those for the others. Not only were they delicious, but the guy was very nice and happy too as I told them that they were awesome - he made them himself (or his wife did, something like that). We chatted for a while, I bought more of them for my family and then we drove off. I forgot his name and I'll probably never find that heavenly place again but thank you, unknown dude, for the best cinnamon rolls in my entire life. Keep doing gods work.
Wow. Jim Gaffigan’s Comedy is good for something I guess....
Will definitely be trying this next week
You mean your not going to to reap the rewards of ad revenue by making the failed attempt a second video?
From Fallout 3 ?!
I looked up to you man!
'this is too creamy, so im going to add cream' ???????????
.... why am I in class I need to go and get stuff for this lol
'Thinks cream cheese mixture is too creamy' 'adds heavy cream to make it less creamy'
Sam I wanna synonym roll
Hot cross buns
Damn i want babby to glaze me
Babs, ya need to make one of the meals from Spirited Away! Cause daaaamn that would be amazing.
As a Swede it hurts every part of my body watching this version of cinnamon roll
Help me heal my broken leg faster
Plzz do brisket from young sheldon
U should have used the footage of Louis C.K. talking about cinnamon buns
God, making cinnamon rolls based on a cinnamon roll lover's description... I'm down
"Channel Membership is only available to..." Aaaa Babish I wanna joiiiin ?? also I've been craving cinnamon roll for months so this is like premonition to me
Was that comedian suppose to be funny?
Should have made the cinnamon roll from van wilder
Just had my first cinnamon roll today. They dont sell it here. Then yesterday just found a bakery that sells some.

Homemade hot pockets?? Just looks like a pasty from Greggs ????
Until creamy
Well Sunday night I really wanted to make cinnamon rolls.. now pops a new video from you on cinnamon rolls! I guess it's mandatory now ??
Dammit, & I just ate breakfast. Also, are we gonna get Shrimp Part 2 & are we gonna get some dishes from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
You should try to make and eat an Every Pizza Place Salad from Family Guy.
"A little too creamy..." Adds cream
Suggestion: lunches from "The Breakfast Club"!
Is that a daydate?
"Thin it a little with heavy cream." ??
Can you make Tsukune's Shantai Curry from Rosario Vampire?
I just can’t do CREAM CHEESE frosting on Cinnamon Roll, it feels like I’m trying to add a flavor that has no business being in a Cinnamon Roll. If it’s not a vanilla frosting from scratch, it’s just not worth it.
Do the lentil soup recipe hidden in Baby I’m Amazed at the end of Simpsons episode featuring Paul McCartney.
Wait how do I philosophically wash my hands
louis ck cinnabom bit was wayyyyyyy better.
Have you made soft pretzels??? MAKE AUNTIE ANNE'S SOFT PRETZELS!!!????????

That clip at the beginning wasn’t even remotely funny.
Babs.....i literally screamed an orgasmic "YES!" when i seen the pull apart. Bravo good sir??????
Yeah, this is reminiscent of when I first made cinnamon rolls. Except I burned mine in the oven thinking they weren’t done enough. And I made them on a baking sheet rather than a pan.
Can you please make power puff girls?
please do the gum drop pizza from Aladdin!
"It's a little creamy so we're gonna add some cream to even that out."
As if you needed an excuse to make cinnamon rolls.
Cinnamon Jizz
Coulda gone with better call saul as your reference
i like bread
As a swede this makes me very uncomfortable. This is not how we do it. What is this? Dry yeast?Where's the butter on the inside?! THE FUCK IS A CREAM CHEESE FROSTING?! (admittedly this is probably an American cinnamonroll, which of course would be different than the Swedish one. I'm not even sure they're originally Swedish, but I'm gonna pretend that they are until someone tells me otherwise.)

Why do you keep using the unit ounces when referring to solids? My understanding is that ounce is a unit for liquids not solids, so saying ounce of butter just makes things for confusing for the international fan

I never thoguht i would face palm myaelf while watching your vids but this time you had it coming with all of those rookie mistakes in the beginning
JOJO!!!
You should do a seres called blunders with babyish
Over here, we bake the buns on a large sheet, so they don't stick together. And we sprinkle the buns with pearl sugar or chopped nuts before baking, not tonnes of fat sugary frosting.
You should make the Paunch Burger dinner for breakfast burger combo. (Looks like an oversized triple bacon thickburger from Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr, a monstrous helping of chili cheese fries, and a regular size(128 oz) chocolate milkshake.
Let me Cinnamon your Rolls kids

Mr Babish how about of Benson's chili from regular show
On next episode from Hannibal
Ive never been so excited for a BwB. I love cinnamon rolls but its impossible to find good ones, let alone make them (for me at least)
Cream cheese frosting > all other kinds. Almost every cinnamon roll I have had has that terrible powdered sugar and a little water for icing, no where near as good.
Hey I just wanted to say thank you.. for bringing back my love of cooking. I'm proud to say that I am now back in the kitchen becaus I find it fun again. And not just to survive
This was THE Christmas breakfast for my family for many many years. I miss those days
”Once you’ve gotten to knowing your rolling pin...”
If you weren't such a coward, you could've made this into an episode on replicating Cinnabon's recipe.
5:25 Now THESE are what I call precious cinnamon rolls!
I wish he made more of a glaze instead of a frosting
I love making cinnamon buns all the time. Now the guy who first inspired me to cook has made them, I love it. Also the way he makes it is completely different to the way I do. I am so going to try it out and see how they compare.
Hot nut on a bread snake.
jim gaffigan is (in my opinion) one of the most underrated comedians out there. he is so funny in such a unique way and every time i watch his comedy specials i laugh until i cry basically. maybe next time you can try making a ? hooottt pocketttt ? :)
“This seems too creamy, let me add some heavy cream”
Can you make hot pockets next?
Hey Babish. I'm a long-time subscriber of your channel from Korea and I've noticed that you haven't done anything from my country. So, i was wondering if you would make an episode about the dumplings from "Old Boy"(the original one, of course). Thanks!
Cream cheese too creamy --> add cream ??
I feel old because this could have been from Mitch Hedberg's stand up.
Cool
Would you rather buns of steel or buns of cinnamon?
Jim Gaffigan lives in NYC. You could have had him on the show. You can make Hot Pockets with him.

Cinnamon rolls are precious and delicious. Like...sweet doughy gold. You NEED to drown it in icing though. If you don’t, you’re not eating it right.
Too creamy, let's add some more cream.
Home made hot pockets? Remove from box, throw directly in toilet. How hard is that?

I decide to make cinnamon scroll for the first time on Monday. They didn’t rise much were also quite hard on the outside and I also didn’t have enough icing sugar to make the glacé. But they still tasted okay

You are running out of ideas bud
THANK YOU for not deleting the failed footage, it helps new cooks more than you think!
The only mistake with first attempt was to cut it. It was nice cinnamon-rolls-cake...
I would suggest more cold rise on these. The best cinnamon rolls have a lot in common with beer than bread. I enjoy Alton Brown's recipe, but I think Betty Crocker cookbook and several others have this method as well which is far superior in my book to these quick rolls
Can you make Mom’s Spaghetti from 8 Mile?

babish!! can you make something from the movie The Hundred Foot Journey??? it's a movie about food, I know, but there are so many cool things in it.
A little bit too creamy - I'm going to thin this out with heavy cream? WTF?

How the hell didn't you use Better Call Saul for this. HOW????!!
You should just make "Kanelsnegle" they are very similar, but not quiiiite the same. (A danish "Cinnamon roll")
Hey babish love the vid. I do have a neat little accompaniment to your cinnamon gooey roll of yummness. My wife makes the best cinnamon rolls...I dont care who here argues it. My wife is the Angelina Jolie...of the cinnamon roll-y. Anyways chef John joke aside. She uses maple syrup to sweeten the batter and coffee in the cream cheese frosting. I have never wanted to cry just thinking about them...now I need her to go make me some.
d'egg
Make Cucumber Sandwiches and/or Peppermint Iced Tea from Hilda!
I feel like mistake number 1 was not using a butter and cinnamon sugar mixture. Creating a paste, or buttering the dough and sprinkling with the cinnamon sugar.
Make Stupendous Stew from Super Mario Odyssey!
How does this dude not get fat
If you want more cinnabun style buns whip your butter and sugar and cinnamon together as a paste and then spread it super thin and sprinkle with more cinnamon
Do a fallout special: sweet rolls, iguana bits(?), Sunset sasparilla, sugar bombs etc
Make the 3 course meal chewing gum from Willy Wonka! And then make the lemonade that makes you float. :D

Babish is a beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too pure
Danes here are shook

Jim gaffigan is one of the best comedians. I love his show and I respect how much of a gentleman he truly is when his wife got terrible sick and he took care of her. That is relationship goals.
Hey governor cheerio
Never watch BWB while hungry, never watch BWB while hungry, NEVER WATCH BWB WHILE HUNGRY
Nice to know everyone screws up sometimes. Muffin trays work great for baking cinnamon rolls.
Still waiting on cherry pie from Twin Peaks...
It's too creamy... add cream.
These look horrible !
I prefer Louis CK’s version of Cinnabon....)
Watched "This is not what I expected" the other day. Lots of good looking food, in what I can only describe as a Chinese screw ball comedy
Babish, I'm trying to renovate my kitchen, and I was hoping to install a good solid work surface for cutting, kneading, just generally working on stuff before cooking properly--but all the kitchen outlets I've been to keep telling me that such a thing isn't worth doing and that I should always use a cutting board/surface protector? Could you tell me how you do it/what it is, or is it just a case of "whatever, don't care, I'm going to be getting a lot of use out of this and if it gets ruined, I'll replace it?"
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns? Love the fail footage to show us how the recipe is developed; we've been trying that ourselves.
Going home and trying to make these now
Indeed God never intended for cinnamon rolls to be cut??
??
You could of said it was from the Secret life of Walter Mitty
Do anime now
This could've been from Better Call Saul.
I really like this format! I love it when people include their mistakes and this recipe sounds delicious.
This is why I prefer baking caramel rolls, you pour the caramel in the baking pan first and then flip the whole thing over once baked. Simple easy and efficient
I wish every episode was 30 minutes long
You know what? I'll take it because I want to make cinnamon rolls too.
Andrew!! I think it would be amazing if you did a react video to some of the videos on You Suck At Cooking's channel!! His videos are pretty funny and random, with some cooking thrown in. ????
Mistakes or not to be honest they looked fantastic either way kinda like that very home made look and texture
Hey Babi, try the argentine dish 'milanesas con puré' from the argentine movie 'El Angel'
"Sweet Bread A La Gusteau (good and bad version)" from Ratitouille
so can i point out we were a few episodes into season 2. then this episode is season 1.
Lost opportunity to gesture towards a giant bowl of sugary cinnamon roll goo. Could you please do your own take on the Fiesta Burrito with Chili and Eggs that Dan Aykroyd makes for Robert Stack in the food truck scene from Caddyshack 2?

Oh man the way you worked that rolling pin turned me on a little Also you should do a LoTR themed episode with rabbit stew, lembas bread, and a huge second breakfast full of all hobbit foods.
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
I make cinnamon rolls all the time but I can never get the frosting right. Thank you for the recipe. I’m gonna try it!
My friend. My family makes dozens of large cinnamon rolls every Christmas as gifts. Do yourself a favor, before adding the Cinnamon Sugar, do a thin coating of room temperature butter to the dough. Trust me, it's butter... I mean... better!
You should make the ink spaghetti from Jojo’s bizarre adventure
Can he just he picked up by Netflix or something major? He fucking deserves it! Imagine him and Alton Brown cooking together!
You don't need any excuses to make cinnamon rolls.
improvement! using a glass bowl to be able to see the process!
I think Cream Cheese frosting on cinnamon rolls is blegh, but i’d still eat urs babs. Also you should do food from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
Hey Babish, will you post the homemade hot pockets on YouTube as well? Doesn't seem fair for us guys who can't afford to spend 5 dollars a month
"Getting to know your rolling pin" bit got me haha
Is that a new apron?
A bit too much frosting for my taste
What's the stuff being used to cover the rolls while they proof?
hoooooot pocket.
Oh hey Babi got himself a new shallow dof bokehlicious lens!
I prefer Louie's description but Jim's is good too
I'm just saying Babish Food Wars is a treasure trove of content for you. Also they did an episode with bear meat which would be super interesting to see you cook.
“I screwed up royally” still makes a great cinnamon roll that’s like an A- instead of an A+
I need these now
U should recreate Walnut Date Loaf from Captain America Civil War
Make "sandwiches" from How I Met Your Mother
I like your new watch Andrew.

Could you make some dishes from jojo's bizarre adventure like Ink spaghetti or anything Tonio makes?
"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."
Paul Walker’s tuna no crust plssss
"The icing was too creamy, so I thinned it out with some heavy cream." Is this an oxymoron or just irony?
awwww lol love this channel so much
( DRAMATIC MUSIC KICKS IN ) THE TIME HAS COME MY FELLOW CINNAMON BUN(or rolls) LOVERS
I’m watching this while walking to my 0 period
Mistake #4: sugar and cinnamon are to be mixed with room temp butter and then spread on the dough not sprinkled. Plus a good helping of roughly ground cardamom in the dough gives an extra aromatic touch.
Haha, you should have made a Cinnabon the size of a Beanbag chair ??
I used to work at Cinnabon and we would only put 6 buns in the pan you first used and we put them in diagonally. Also they made a HUGE deal about frosting while hot but not over frosting lol. "we sell Cinnabon, not cupcakes"
Ah the scraping the bottom of the barrel portion of babish. The best ones!
I want Babish to pour cream cheese frosting on me.
"It's too creamy, so I'm going to add cream."
i literally made cinnamon rolls last night
Is this what Americans consider "comedy"?
thank you for showing your mistakes, when you follow a recipe it usually doesn’t tell you the things that you’ve shown in this video.
American cinnamon rolls are disgusting. Looks like someone came all over them.
I thought he was talking about what is colloquially called Monkey Bread or Sticky Buns. I love making money bread.
I mean.... What else can I say besides it was a 10/10 video
Too creamy? No problem, just add cream! :^)
Cinnamon rolls without chili? I knew you city-folk were odd, but I didn't think you were barbarians.
I loved seeing the revisions here - cinnamon rolls have been one of my favourite things to bake since the time a friend taught me how. I'm looking to try a cardamom version from Sweden next! As ever, I will beg and plead and promise unto half my kingdom for an episode on the No-Face Feast from Spirited Away. Please feed your gluttonous children, Mr. Babby :')
Those hot pockets are calling me
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
Good burger from well good burger
People say that kitchen aid appliances are the best, now they must be as they're clearly Babish approved!
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin ??" Damn Babby, buy it dinner first....or maybe....make dinner with it first?
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
I was half-expecting Babish to sit on a bun as per Gaffigan’s joke.
Can't wait to make these! Delicious
I just started going back to the gym. I did not need this.
Like 0.3 sec after I saw the vid post yell THE TIME HAS COME

Unrelated Mr Babish, what kind of watch is that?
"STOP! YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW. PAY THE COURT A FINE OR SERVE YOUR SENTENCE! YOUR GOODS ARE NOW FOREFIT!"
I don’t know if I could bake this, but according to Keegan Micheal Key,... I’ve got this.
I get so much rolls from cinnamon rolls

You should have used the scene from the Mark Walberg Will Ferrell movie. I think it was called Daddy's home. It's good because Will pretty much implies that they can't be made in a regular kitchen.

spooky...
0:33 - I tried this recipe with butter from a happy cow and the bread exploded during cooking. Make sure the cow is very angry.
0:26 If you want it cursed why would you draw a pentagram on it????
Having trouble finding ghost pee ??
To be honest, it was sooo satisfying when he zoomed in and slowly twirled and pulled the toothpick out of the bread
Just how grandma made it
Why didn't you let the eggs have a moment?
Reference to the pumpkin pie video :D Also what's up with his dogs? .-. I mean, I'm not gonna say much because I respect his love for dogs, but HOW???? (Also clap clap best content of the year award good job YSAC)
I couldn't find any of the ingredients.

For some reason I couldn’t find the ingredients? XD ??

how did you teach your cat to play catch?
I live California what is a win winter?
Hibernation fort <3 I'm in the other hemisphere, the lonely Southern Hemisphere (we're a bit quiet down here if you compare the populations of each hemisphere). Spring is here, and I kind of want to build my own Spring Hibernation Fort because the hayfever is so bad. Right now I have a regular (strong but non-drowsy) antihistamine tablet I take regularly, a nasal antihistamine AND a saline nose spray (I have the squirty bottle to do proper saline rinses but don't do it too often because I'm too lazy to boil water and wait for it to be the perfect lukewarm temperature before it goes cold). But my sinuses still hurt and my eyeballs are still irritated.
YOU ARE BRILLIANT
Good morning let’s get this bread
I like dogs
#45 on trending boys

Hmmmm………….. Dude you need to make a video at least like every hour..... Thanks.....
Why am I just now finding this channel!
I forgot how much of a genius you are
aaah sit on it and spin... to mix well. most pumpkin pie fillings and breads have butternut or sweeter squash in them - maybe 1/5th pumpkin to allow for advertising laws <— haha
Meh
This is never boring haha
Did you know the star of David is a symbol of Israel and also the balance between man and woman by the ??( the chalice represented the woman) and the ??( the blade represented the man) which together formed the pentacle or six sided star
Time is real, it was proven by Einstein and is taken into consideration for GPS and satellites. This has been your daily fact from your local nerd who gets triggered when people say time is an illusion
But raw eggs arent disgusting.. Ok they are.. a little bit to me

So when can I buy the YSAC limited edition double LP vinyl?
I made this and it is fantastic! !! Seriously ..my husband and daughter ate almost an entire loaf within an hour.
2:34 that was oddly seductive
"You can make a sacred wand out of anything just so long as it's sacred, which means that it was made by God, which is all things, so it's not that difficult." This is actually... pretty damn accurate, really. That's pretty much exactly how that works.
Yes
Fucking love this channel.
At least you don't live in South Dakota.
I really love the effort you put into all your videos. You're really entertaining (and i love your voice) please keep up the amazing videos

I'm sorry, but where are the eggs? There are supposed to be more eggs. Like, alot of eggs. Please redo video .

Wait....this isn't that binging with Babush guy right?
Where has this channel been all my life... I do suck at cooking.

works better if you summon a demon from a pentagram of pumpkin pie spice to share your lonely, terrible winter with!
Not a big fan of pumpkin bread
Had to watch this through the gaps of my fingers.
I miss Lemon Demon
Damm i have everything but the ghost where do i get one

HowToBasic's odd younger brother

My dog died and I've been really depressed to bake anything since he was always my doggo test taster. But your video gives me hope to get back to it.
Bread is bread because of the active yeast reacting to the sugars of the wheat, therefore causing it to rise and create a light and airy texture when biting into it.
He got the ??.??

How do you not have more subs?
I tried this and got pumpkin cake
This is hilarious!
"3/2 Cups of all purpose flower, including the purpose of making pumpkin bread" I haven't laughed that hard about a cooking video. Also funniest thing was when he said "congratulation you get one piece of candy corn, you already have it"
He's a dog sitter he has a lot of dogs each video
You never disappoint.. ????
Well it to late for seasonal fall pumpkin bread. It snowed here today.

(((Mediums/Witches are an abomination to God. The reality is that people are not talking to their dead relatives but to DEMONS!!! Which is an abomination in God's sight to consult with witches and to contact the DEAD!!!))) …….. When we go against God’s will and we think we are talking to our dead relatives that have passed on and this is not the case. This is called Necromancy. (Necromancy): The suppose practice of communicating with the dead, which states in Deuteronomy 18:12 it is an abomination unto the Lord. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. (Mark 12:27). As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27). Demonic spirits love to disguise themselves as our loved ones. The demons love to appear as little children. People are either taken to the pit by Demons or taken by Gods Holy angels right after we pass on. Its either we love Jesus and repent of our sins and follow his commandments, (John 14:21), or we don't and find ourselves in Hell one day, because of our free will our father has given us. Definition of: {Familiar Spirit}: A Demon supposedly attending and obeying a witch, often said to assume the form of an animal. (The Lord said to Moses): Do not turn to Mediums that have familiar spirits or Wizards to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God. (Leviticus 19:31). I will set my face against the person who turns to mediums/Spiritualists who have familiar spirits and wizards. To go whoring after them by following them. (Leviticus 20:6). A man or women who is a medium and has a Familiar spirit and is among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:27). Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritualist/Wizard or who consults the dead/ Familiar Spirits. Anyone who does these things is an Abomination to the Lord. And because of these Abomination practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the Lord your God. (Deuteronomy 18:10-13). Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums who consult familiar spirits, and households Gods, the idols and all the other Abomination things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. (2 Kings 23:24). He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums with familiar spirits. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, provoking him to anger. (2 Chronicles 33:6). When men tell you to consult mediums with familiar spirits, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? (Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?) (Isaiah 8:19). You shall be brought down, you shall speak out of the ground; you speech shall be low, out of the dust; your voice shall be like the medium’s, out of the ground; and your speech shall whisper out of the dust. (Isaiah 29:4). (Voice…like a medium’s refers to the forbidden, deceptive “voices” for which the medium supposedly served as a channel). Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. (Divination). This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved." She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her. When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place to face authorities. (Acts 16:16-19). He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination and consulted familiar spirits and Wizards/mediums. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, provoking him to anger. (2 Kings 21:6). The spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come though hypocritical liars, who conscience have been seared as with a hot iron. (1 Timothy 4:1-2). I used to watch television shows on mediums, but now I know what the bible says about people like these. We need to pray for them that they stop being a mouth piece for Satan and his demons. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the father is not in him (1 John 2:15). We need to get this information out and stop defiling ourselves and pray for people who consult with familiar spirits and come back to the Lord Almighty and seek the truth from him. Praise Jesus (Yeshua) Who is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and the Alpha and the Omega. Amen!
long live pimbloktu
1:58 Um, excuse me good sir. Did you just call me disgusting?
I was glad until you added candy corn
Some rare ingredients
This was great! I was especially surprised by the quality of the song at the end. It seems a step above most songs you've done in the past. Would you say you put more effort into this one? Also can you try to say 'fuck off' in more of your videos? I find it helps to elucidate some of the mystyrious sentiments I share with most co-workers and some members of my extended family. Thank you kindly.
That’s one spoopy pumpkin bread
What an handsome boy 4:29
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime, doubly so.
What is the name/artist of the song at the end of the video? ??

Why does your sheep act like a dog?
Oh my ghoul! So glad I ran into your channel. You're ridiculously entertaining and yes, I'm planning on making that pumpkin bread.
I fully concur with your feelings on snow.

The callback to the pumpkin pie episode made me so giddy.

See yall in a month
Keep up the videos Imaginary Ambition
What kind of camera do you use?
Can I use butter from a happy cow instead?
The fall of Fall.
Okay but the candy corn thing is actually really similar to an old Halloween/harvest festival tradition where they'd stick random things in food and baked goods and the thing you got would predict the events of the coming year
That is a very good doggo.
is there a link for that song ?? it's legit good I want to hear it more
That song was clearly not written by someone who lives in the south. Cause summer sucks.
I love you
yess. good pumpkin bread. good dog.
Beautiful.
Im a small youtuber and I would appreciate any type of support ???
I’ve been enlightened
This was hilarious! You got my sub!
Good energy, up dog.
I can't believe you can cook, edit video, make music and most importantly, have winter pillow fort too
I love pumpkin bread
Yessssssa
pumpkin bread more like pumpkin shit
I can always count on you for a smile.
How you make me laugh stop plz

2:36 does anybody else think that's oddly satisfying??
I actually believed him for a while. I'm so glad I found this channel
?????????? the funniest stuff all of that place
Yo that hibernation fort looks cozy as fuck.
I was a little confused about the light but as soon as you put the smiley face bucket on it I got it. It made for a well need laugh. Thank you
nice song
You are like a very refined HowToBasic.
You suck at YouTube
Guys my walnuts are pretty tough, anyone know a good way to scare it?
Spööky

Lovin’ the fort????

Everything you make is absolute gold. Oh your foods great too.
Beet song is still my favorite song made by him???? ITS AWESOME
This is a good channel????????????????
has he made the broodwich and if can someone link me it
I saw the thumbnail and thought it was hash lmfao
You forgot to mention that the all purpose flour contains the most cursed substance of all: gluten
Very spoopy
What happens if I harvested it within 31 days of a full moon???
Ive been waiting for this all my life
Let’s get this bread
Do you have a band if so please link it. I love your style of music
There needs to be more wang jangling.
Mm that taste... Revolting
Brooo brooooooo, you should make music.
Why dont you have your own vevo channel
It holloween! So everything looks and sounds haunted!
That doge!
I make a CURSED recipe from the DARK WEB (GONE WRONG!)
Hamilton is that you
Low-key the outro songs are bomb
Eventually this comment, along with this sad lonely dinosaur, will be lost in all of the thousands of comments for this video
This is Tim ?? 1 Like = 1 Friend
We all know I suck at cooking, I don't need to be reminded.
Let’s get this bread
Thought the slices of bread was weed ??
“With carrot handle” ?? ?? ??
Those are pecans
Thank you, very cool!
HEY! WHERE DID YOU PUT THE TRUE WANG JANGERLER?!
I love your videos and think they're hilarious! However I'd like to show them to my kids but you throw in a word or two of profanity in almost every video, so that really keeps it from being fully kid friendly. I recognize the need to have it a little edgy but I think it wouldn't take much to make it family-friendly too.
I lost my everliving SHIT when he said "wangjangle"
3:55 I thought he censors his videos?
That's one soggy doggy
Such an accurate video. Thanks ????
Congrats on trending
Why does it it look like a soft brick ??
Thanks for the music. That's my comment. Short..!
Do you live in heaven?
Or...you could just go buy a loaf for like 4 dollars. I buy it from the Amish, it tastes like crack cocaine. I don't want to cook it myself cause I suck at it.
Can we get a banana bread recipie please Edit: or garlic bread, that works to
1:04 The way he shook the stick got me dead ??
I’m allergic to walnuts. What do I do now?
Yoooo ur on trending!
U are my favorite YouTube channel in the world. U put so much effort into all of ur vids. U always make me so happy when I watch ur vids and u inspired me to try and become a chef and I hope I can cook with u one day. Keep up the good work!!!!??????????????????????????????????????
Banana bread is the best
Those pecans were like "not today satan"??
Hello I have a problem with this recipe I can't make it spooky enough :(
The eggs didn't say goodbye to each other but the dog was a good actor. 420/666 stars
Yay!! I hope you make more videos soon.
I didn't have any pans so I ended up pouring it all down the sink. oops.
Does he foster dogs? That would be awsome if he did
summer is trash tho
That was a good song at the end
For some reason this is the one this that I know I’m doing right in life, watching this nonsensical video.
This IS it Chief!
WHY DID I NOT GET A POST NOTIFICATION?!
salt cant be haunted
>log in >see new ysac video >instantly click on it >fuck yes
chuffed
0:18 in case you don’t understand, there’s a full moon every 30 days
What's your dog's name?
noice
Can I replace the pumpkin with bananas
The canned pumpkin is not actually pumpkin but a type of squash called field pumpkin
I came here from trending and I am really interested
Terrific funny!
Finally
Please go on The Official Podcast and defend your hot song writing skills.
Ive been waiting for this video for ever and i feel so happy because its here. this makes me wanna cry because of how much i love this channel. i just want to talk to this guy and tell him how many times he has made me happy for a human to be alive.
YSAC, you never disappoint! What would it take to get a compilation of original songs from all your vids?....A greatest hits album even...? Also, if we can't have Blotto back what about an Egg Cops follow up....? Who's with me?
Weow wat a spoop
This all because USAC built a fort and wanted to show it off
Well... thanks for telling me I suck at cooking lmao. I can cook ramen
I just found my new fav channel!!
lol good stuff
0:12 feelsbadman !
i got genuinely really fucking sad during that song wtf
The scariest part of this video... is the lack of the intro... Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
I appreciate the dog montage
Trending ??
0.55 why is there a satanic star
I love warm pumpkin bread with butter
groom your dog.
CURLY DOG OMG <3
how to make holy water step one.. boil the hell out of it
i don't know if I should take him seriously, but dang this is a good channel
Number twelve on trending, deserves one, keep up the amazing videos, you are amazing
Someone has to say it.... your a watered down version of howtobasic.
The song reminds me of They Might be Giants. Good job.
My favorite song so far.
My favorite song so far.
@1:38 when dad cooks because mom is out of town
First time ever seeing his videos...this is what I've been missing????????
Lol
That outro song beat the corn on the cob one without a doubt its 100% my favorite one
My mom's pumpkin bread recipe is better than this one (and has less Halloween jokes).
Is that pimblockto on the keys?
ugh this is so disgusting I'm unsubbing ugh
Wow, thats a lot of sugar
That's some dooty bread
Your channel is so funny!
I decided to make this and it was actually really good
I swear this is How To Basic when sober.
didn’t you think your used homemade spice. also it’s still 85 out where i’m at doesn’t even feel like fall??
Pumpkin bread that doesn't have mini chocolate chips is invalid
Thanks for the great video! I’m actually going to try out this recipe.. looks good
0:37 tf2 Halloween Cosmetics just a ton of haunted stuff
Yummy yum yum bread
The song though...yaasss
his dog should be in youtube rewind
i'm crying tears at the sad lamp thing
I wanna eat that
has anyone listened to his tips seriously?
I’m slightly disappointed that you didn’t bless the ingredients with that sacred harvest dildo you have. Your bread has not been properly blessed
Where do you get all these dogs, you lucky monkey skunker?
When your salt is haunted you know you're fucked
When he blessed the ingredients I choked
WHERE DOES HE LIVE
Time to be spoopy
How do I know if my ingredients are haunted? ????????
Who took your wangjangler
I saw a banner that said "binging with Babish viewers watch this." I'm a subscriber already! how about "YSAC viewers watch this" on BWB vids??
Luv u
Thank you for taking me on this journey
Please do ASMR
Finally an upload I can watch without getting bored
The hardest part of this video is me keeping my toxic personality away from it.
I only have butter from an angry goat. Will that work?
Put some lemon kush in the bread
white girls approach over the horizon
Dude this song at the end had such good production, it's no worse than those of some of my favourite bands. Seriously if you put this on spotify as a full version, I'll add it to my favourites playlist.
You are one sick individual that should never be cured. Keep jangling your wangle, my man.
So many fans to make you on trending! I’m a subscriber from about 100,000! Keep up the quality vidoes

Come for the food, stay for the witty humor, and return for the dog.
Just in time, my cursed brown sugar was about to expire! Thank goodness I have this recipe now
You're on Trending yeyeyeyeyeyeye
There’s a face reveal at 3:40!!
Oh my
He's a lil silly in the head it's awesome eating the batter
I followed the instructions perfectly and the pumpkin bread killed my dead aunt's sister, what now?
the video is good if you mute it and skip towards the end
Why he had to be satanic and draw a star for ??
what is it with haunted stuff amirite
I suck vagina
lets get this bread!!
keep your toxic personality away from it for an hour
What's a electric mixer Do you mean electric wanjangler
I just wanted to leave a rare comment and say that the ending song on this video was legitimately really good. I actually checked the description for a download link. YSAC, you should consider collecting a few of your best songs and making an online album that people could listen to or donate to download.
Please be in my band
Dude I swear this looks exactly like Maine
He’s a doggo confirmed. Jk, I love your doggo btw.
I'm proud I found you before you were so popular
That doggo at the end was everything i needed to feel happy today, thank you.
Ey boy grammar mistake in your description. Its not it's. Sorry
Wanna have an unfufilling realtionship that only relies on friday night dinners for us to have any kind of attraction and kindness to each other simply because the food is sub par and because it's sub par I let you hold my hand for a soild minuet until I put you back on the couch because it wasn't good enough for you to earn your once a month laying like a plank on opposite sides of our king size bed?
Came for the bread, stayed for the doggo
It's kind of like HowToBasic's mature disapponted father
If you go into hibernation, does that mean that we won't get any videos until spring?
Drilling the candy corn into the bread. ??
Cats are better. I rest my case.
Cute dog bro
Its amazing how he records this all with his mouth
What kind of dog is that? You know in the end when the music roles? I just wondered.
jealous of your dog's wet curls
greatest YouTube cooking channel by a long shot. I am sorry Babish!
Almost as good as binging with babish
Amazing lol
* flashbacks to pumpkin pie video *
mad cow would have been better :)
I don't trust people that downvote your videos.. What kind of person do you have to be to downvote this video?
l e t i t r i s e
I missed you ??????
i honestly love your doggo so much
So I get that this is a cooking channel, but can you seriously make an album of these songs and sell it and take my money pls
Please bring back pimblockto!!!
How do I get these so called “possessed chickens?”
how many dogs does this guy have???? there’s a new god damn dog in every video
I am thoroughly spooped
I, too, require a happy lamp for the spoopy season.
Is this not a full babish rip?
You're finally on trending!! Congratulations! I never did find out what happened to plimokto or the eggs
How did I not see this in my subscriptions
your songs are fun
3:56 ooooo he used the fuck word
When's the album coming out?
LGTPB stands for Let's get this pumpkin bread
Loved the perfect edit timing on the song at the end with the dog catching the ball @ 3:58 & 4:04. Personally, I loved older themes like the robot and phrases about pepper, but I am glad you do not rely on the same thing in every video. Artists explore the new and provide insight . . . keep up your art, it is very fine.
I’m telling you, it’s a different dog every time.
The dog is awesome
Is the end of the video taped at lake superior
Oh so thats why the eggs keep spinning no matter what i do to stop them and as well as getting scared every time i eat walnuts
Yay you got on trending!!
That jumpscare got me so bad
This is so much like HowToBasic... I LOVE IT!
Spooky scary pumpkin bread
Undo on 4 hundo
s p o o k y b r e a d
thank you for existing.
This was so funny I forgot the instructions ????
what if i cant find the haunted parts of the ingredients
Its like I'm watching how to basic but but calm version ??
bonus lesson: spooked walnuts are pecans.
How about corn breas
delicious finally some good fuc-
Where does this madman live it's so fucking beautiful.
Your dog is adorable!
Je klinkt echt als een engels iemand ik klink gwn als een dronken mongool gg
s p o o k y t i m e
Woah, my mom just made this for breakfast!
Fuluufy cat u have
if I make the pumpkin bread and slather it in whipcream does it become pumpkin pie? Also, can I buy the song at the end from anywhere? seriously. Those are some good sounds.
What's the point of baking if you're not eating the raw batter ?????
Cool af
Lol I don't mind raw eggs. I bake one loaf then eat the other raw.
Is it a new dog in every video or am I just crazy? Also why are they always so serene?
I wonder what one of their videos would be like if they made something from Food Wars. xD
I love your songs
Brown sugar is a good idea, the recipe I use has white sugar and requires more of it.
Hey everybody I’m a kid friendly youtuber that makes my own very cool movies, I am making a really cool movie series called The Spezi Realm and you can see the Trailer for it on my channel subscribe to my channel so you can get notifications when the episodes will come out!
Finally a wangjangle!!!!!!!!!
I can't find haunted sugar anywhere
I've been subscribed to you since your like 5th video maybe, and this end song is my favorite. Really great job man. You always put so much effort into your videos and at 4+ years I thought you've earned a pat on the back of some kind from a guy you don't know lol Keep up the great work!! ??
This is the S P O O K police. You're under arrest for being too S P O O K Y
You suck at making videos. Yeah, you totally suck. Kidding. Haha great content as always!
That dog porn at the end. My bulldog jiffed twice. Thnx.
We are simply not worthy of your content
This honestly has to be the best outro song yet.
Why are you trying to be a Binging with Babish fake lol have some originality
Salt can't be haunted because it drives ghosts away, but you can use cursed salt instead.
Your not uploading as much. Are you ok?
Just made Pumpkin Bread French Toast the other day.
I love the end <3
The celery wand made me choke on my soda hahahahahahhaha
You should upload more
I want to see your face.
Fortnite content nobody cares about YouTube: I sleep YouSuckAtCooking makes a new, amazing video YouTube: REAL SHIT
Yo that fort honestly looks cozy af.
its*
I think people underlook the songs he puts in at the end of his videos. The fact that he writes one for each video is pretty impressive
i thought the thumbnail was some dank hash, this aint bad tho
Is this babish?
This is fantastic. You put out great quality videos that are a lot of fun to watch!
lets get this bread.
I've been getting a lot of bread lately, not money just my card intake is unreal
October: let's get this pumpkin bread November: let's get this corn bread December: let's get this Holy bread
wheres pimblockto
This is too much info dammit, I'm really pissed off..??
Not only did I learn something, but I had fun and a good laugh . 9.3/10. Deduction for not enough skeletons in your video. It’s only spooktober once, take advantage while you can.
I never knew what love was until I found this channel
i'm pretty sure the kitchen appliance, when referring to it as something that can finish your pastries or your bread, should be spelt "undough"
whats with all these heartfelt comments
where the F U C K do you live where it is always that fucking pretty outside? or, at least, where is that stolen footage from?
You have a very soothing voice lmfao
I am so glad about the fact that we share this kind of humor
Finally my possessed chicken is of use
I come here for the witty cooking lesson, I stay for the sweet jams at the end. <3
Lmao ?? this was great ??
it was truly horrifying carrying around hot bread in the hands till it cooled off.
This channel is completely underrated! One of the best YouTube channels ever! I'm making the pumpkin bread right now .... collecting all my evil ingredients.
Forget making this, where can i buy it
How to make weed brownies
???? this was very entertaining lol glad I didn’t change the video lol love your monotone voice lmao and your sassy whit

NSFW @2:34!
Ok, this is epic

To what extent should I spook my nuts?

Those lyrics are impressive.
Those are definitely pecans.
Can you make some merch?

I love it when he ends the video with a doggo
Thank you.
Did you raid a haunted house's spice cabinet?
THis Was So Great! Check out my Restaurant Youtube Channel! We are doing amazing things. I may have to make this! Great stuff!!
Why am I laughing at how you poured the salt in at 0:42 lol
You are a treasure.
I wish your songs were on spotify

I hope he makes a whole thanksgiving meal for his next video.
Does ysac have a twitch channel
I'm disappointed ????
Your so random and I love it Your dog is so cute btw
This is my new favourite YouTube channel
Your dog has noodle hair.
This is actually the third recipe i tried. Am I weird?
Thanks dad, very cool!
The pup is gorgeous. What's his name?
who else came here for pumpkin bread?
If you don't have two pans just pour the other half of the batter down the drain - YSAC 2018
"How can i have the loaf if its still back in the undo" bwaahahahahahah. My kids are gonna love this one. Thanks for another sick video man - your dog looks like a frikken legend
Can you do weed brownies next please

How to make pepper pepper pepper.

Fantastic. Bravo
It’s HALLOWEEENNNNNNENNENENN
To be honest I’m always super excited for the puppy endings
Love it, but why do most people seem to not like winter? (I’m referring to the song at the end) I can’t stand the heat. I live in the south and we get 7 months of HOT weather and I don’t always work indoors. I always enjoy winter.
4:19 turn on subtitle
Snudhhsniushinshjbs ITS 6 on trending!
Thought the thumbnail was some loud
What kind of dog is that?
Your dog has Ramen Hair
????? ???? ????? ?????
Pro tip: Don't actually try to ride out the whole season in your hibernation chamber. It's much safer to come out intermittently through the months to restock on leftover candy, gingerbread and nanaimo bars. Happy hibernating!
Creativity is worth rewarded by likes!
But is meatloaf therefore not just beef bread?
This vid was too spooky
I fucking love pumpkin bread, and I hate the pumpkin everything that comes with fall. You live in a very beautiful place. ?
Winter>Summer forever
Hi i am from thailand please follow my channel

Plot twist,all the white ingredients were cocaine.
Wow. I AM SHOOKETH.

It has to be binging with babish
This was awesome. Good job
I want to see an episode where your mom makes one of her recipes
My salt isnt haunted, will it still work?
Okay this guy is actually funny
These videos are amazing! the sacred wands are genius.
I hate to break it to you buddy but no tool ever will replace Pimblokto.....
#6 on trending what
So much effort in one video
The scariest thing is that people disliked this video
dog dog dog dog dgo
Cordless kinetic screwdriver ????
Booooooooooooooo
(Also chocolate chips make this super good btw)
I hope you realise that you are now required to do cinematic dog outro for every future video
Where’s the Wangjangler?
What is the end song XD i need it
Can we get a mixtape of all the songs played at the end of the video????
Be sure to do a thorough tick check after your Autimnal stroll in the woods!
Is that jerktonium? hahah anyone remember that from spongebob
How many dogs do you have??
wow, your "pour it down the sink" life hack just saved me so much space in my fridge, i had at least 50 pounds of unused batter in there. thanks!
I prefer to bake my pumpkin bread in a pumpkin.
I got scared together with the wallnuts
I truly appreciate the feeling of solidarity for those of us with seasonal depression ???
I will watch these for as long as you keep making em
The new HowToBasics
Yes
i thought this was a real recipe...
I'm definitely going to subscribe on this, very educational
To be hones though, that fort is what I want to sleep in every night
i like
I thought that was shit in the thumbnail
White people
Wow your dog is serving LOOKS omg
Blessed the food and I lost it
#7 on trending baby let's go!!!!!

pumpkim bread/cake is really good
lets cancel the job interview, sit tf down and watch the latest video of You Suck At Cooking.
This video made me so happy
I don't have any spooky ingredients. Will regular ingredients work or will it just make regular, un-spooked pumpkin bread?
#7 on trending
i love your videos but pumpkin bread does not sound appetizing.. americans have weird tastes-
Is this supposed to be funny?
Am i able to substitute the haunted salt for cursed salt?
Seasonal depression moods
Holy yeet,#7 on trending.Congrats!
Ever made sushi?
So bloody toxic!!
I think you summed it up perfectly
Good boi do a fetch, get wets Many foods made Yes
as an australian i hate summer ((me saying i was australian is very relevant and in fact gives me the authority to speak out my opinions m))
Shouldn't you measure by weight and not volume when baking?
I love all your videos and im jelous of you ! I SUCK AT BEING HAPPY I TOTALLY DO!!
I'm tired of seeing videos from this horrible channel on the trending page. I don't know who had to suck what on who to get these on the trending page but please stop.
Where can I find the lyrics to the song at the end? Lol Edit: you need to put that shit on Spotify my guy
I’m honestly here because the thumbnail looked like weed
Can you release an album?
*cough* SOMEONE clearly lives in Canada. ?? I feel your pain re: the shortness of summer, bro. Kickass but sadly accurate song!
I made pumpkin bread the day before this video was made and it turned out not great. I'm so dissapointed that I didnt wait another day, and now i have 2 loafs of mediocre pumpkin bread. Do you know how it feels to have to dissapoint your friends and family with mediocre pumpkin bread?
LET'S GET THIS (pumpkin) BREAD!!
Its a good fucking day when you see a new YSAC video in your feed! BLESS!
Did you just insult my cooking.
rad
hello i've missed this :')))
Do you make the music video first and then the cooking part? I feel like you could make legitimate music if you tried harder.
The thumbnail looks like a beautifull piece of hashish, lol
Friends, did you know that by remembering the Works of Jesus Christ, which reveals His character, ensures us of His love? In the Book of Psalms, David proclaimed his deep yearning for God as he hid from his enemies in the desert (Psalms 63:1). Remembering his personal encounters with The Lord's limitless power and satisfying love led him to praise (vv.2-5). Through his most difficult nights, David could still rejoice in his dependable Father's love and care (vv.6-8). During our darkest times, when we feel as if God is not there for us, we need reminders of who God is and how He demonstrated His love. Reflecting on our personal experiences with Him, as well as His actions recorded in scripture, can affirm the countless ways our good Abba Father loves us. Start your endless relationship with our Creator by first acknowledging you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross. His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. You will be rewarded greatly and forever changed! Precious one, please find comfort in praying the following prayer with me.... Dear Lord Jesus, thank you for demonstrating Your endless love to Your people, in our lives and through the words You preserve in Scripture. We give You all the honor and glory and we thank you! Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.??????
Where the HECK am I gonna get 3 haunted baking ingredients?
ok i might suck at cooking but that's better than eating pumpkin bread
I was waiting for Pimblokto to appear all oiled up and healthy
That bread looks dry as Fuck;)
Such rich content. I appreciate the time you put into these amazing videos. You dont feel the need to mass produce bullshit. Just quality content every time. It's always worth the wait.

One of your best songs at the end
If you even eat or cook pumpkin bread you suck at cooking.
Dog footage is BACK!!!! Hype
We're have u been
Its the little quotes that count??
Hello, Humans. Terrance walks through his nightmares, with a machete. This machete allows him to kill many demons and monsters alike. Such nightmares, become ten times worse, everytime Terrance sleeps. What should be rest and peace, is nothing but anger and suffering. The anger and the machete become one. One that crushes demons and stands up to the flames of darkness. The darkness almost consumes Terrance. The machete brings about scary power. Once Terrance unleashes the full power of the machete, the nightmare ends and he wakes up, on the floor covered in his own blood. Terrance has enough scars to last 100 life times. TERRANCE OUT
Awwwwww, that winter hibernation fort looks amazing.
Your funny songs are getting longer. I like it. You are my favorite Youtuber right now I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
I've heard that cans of pumpkin actually isn't pumpkin. It's squash. So you just made squash bread. And if you use those cans for Thanksgiving and Christmas for pie, you've made squash pie. Oh, the joy.
Thank you for the awesome footage of your dog playing on the beach! Your dog has the best hair ever.
but can it be a halloween decoration?
what kind of dog is that?
Finally someone who gets the hibernation fort.
2:05. "If you don't have two pans, just pour the other half of the batter down the sink." I'm so glad I wasn't drinking my beer when you said that.
Let's get this pumpkin bread
Hehehe enjoyable sense of humor.
Good Content

“Sneak one piece of candy corn in the loaf and when you and your friends are eating it, say ‘whoever gets a piece of candy corn wins a prize and the prize is..a piece of candy corn. Congratulations you already got it.’ “

It’s so aweful it’s amazing
Let's get that bread
Raw eggs are my favorite though.

So good. One question, how many dogs do you own? I’ve seen at least like 10 different dogs in your outro and I can never tell if there yours or your friends that you just use for the vid
Welcome back, daddy. Master daddy.
I'm disappointed in the cooking to jokes ratio in this one. What is this, potatoes?
This channel is EVERYTHING.

Makes me miss Umblotto.
Hi-key want to buy the outtro song. You do not suck at songwriting my dude.

spoopy
I love these videos man I almost choked on my wonton when he said possessed chicken smh
I, like the pumpkin pie spice, am haunted by the fact you’ve followed your mother into the easy way out.
I can’t find any haunted salt :(
I’d really like to spend a day with the guy that makes these videos. Like what a personality: cooking, singing, humor, dogs
Try pumpkin bread with yogurt (I like nonfat Greek yogurt). You’re welcome.
The songs are back!!! I’ve missed them.
How do I know if the cow is angry?
spook
3:18 I was homeless for 7 year's and three of the seven were spent in a hobbit hole.... Even though it's been 5 year's since then I still miss it a little... Say's while is in a bed watching TV show doing Christmas gift stuff and playing on a phone 8n a house made for people and not animals...
Honestly this was some click bate like to some Howtobasic vid.
That toothpick insertion was very sensual to me
You know it’s October so say haunted Like a hunted pencil

What state does he live in
The song at the end is amazing
This is probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube
The music has gotten rather good.
I know I suck at cooking. No need to remind me. ??
I literally have been waiting for this for a month, T H A N K
i dont appreciate this blatant winter hate
Have you guys ever wondered if he is the one that actually sucks at cooking ?
That looks good with cuban espresso
You should be on food network
that actually tastes revolting
I laughed so hard at the sad lamp so relatable
why were the dog images vibrating? also who made the guitar noises
be back in 11 months
Omg no way! I actually made this today in culinary and miserably failed.
Hi love your videos keep on keeping on
Ondos on 3 fundo wtf happened to ondos on 4 hundo
YSAC teach me how to cook up some happiness
Your videos always hit too 10 trending when they first come out, and you only upload once a month YouTube algorithm pls explain.
These videos inspire me... But then I realize I can’t cook
Next video can you do a face review when your cooking something
Y Yo You You s You su Hah, go suck a Wang jangle =)
The sad lamp instantly reminded me of the glaring light of the dead of winter
Since we are aproching the 100th episode I wonder what he will do.
See you in a month.
Holy crap that candy corn was definitely having sex with that bread! This is x-rated!
I watch your videos, not just for the cooking and comedy, but also the beautiful Canadian scenery
Wait what was this video about I was too scared
Quality content
Is it a vegan pumpkin?
Damn, that song hit me straight in the heart. Winter can indeed fuck off.
I made one of those hibernation forts. But I find it really hard to breath if I closed all the light source out. I tried opening it a bit but the light just keeps getting in. Anyone have any solutions? so that it is breathable?
what if i just toast an entire pumpkin, is that just a raw loaf of pumpkin bread
When my mother makes her pumpkin bread then that’s when fall starts
How's that hibernation fort going for you?
I blessed it a third time just in case, and now I'm breaking quantum physics of my third being. Cooking at godly sucking levels
2:32 suck that, Socrates
Great song at the end brother!
and you got my sub.
HALLOWEEN
Finally
Okay so are you just posting one a month now, cause I honestly need more ysac in my life, man
A toast to bread, for without bread there would be no toast!
You! Sir! You you you you!! It’s alway been you mr. dog !

Gotta pump the kins before you make the bread tho

Congratulations on trending!
OMG i just found your channel and i love you! I'm dying of laughter and your voice is so relaxing. I also like your intro and your ending. Totally subscribing! Keep up the good work!!
Oh thAnk U Sweety. That made my day. Another dOg???? He had a great time.ahh. usually Poodle dawg r not big on water. His he's Labra doo? Or perhaps a Golden naught? A piece of candy corn is no prize. A bucket would be no prize. A boatload would be a curse. Ha!
Those are pecans
How’d I not know about this channel?!
I love this channel. I’m so glad these videos are getting more popular; they are so funny and creative.

Great episode as always, but man, right at the end it really struck me just how good your music is. Am I crazy, and has it gotten even better?
instructions unclear, my house is now haunted with three ghosts and one demon
yes
1:04 ??????
You sound like you want to move to Arizona, join us winter doesn't exit here.
Seriously though, I've been trying to find a purpose for all this haunted baking soda I've had in my cupboard. So glad I have a use for it now, THANKS!
More a pumpkin cake hmm? Not dough but batter?
Will you ever do a face reveal? Also, I am undoubtedly going to make this
2:24 You forgot to tell them to buy gold
"move to a nice warm state of denial" I love this channel

I genuinely love your stuff so fucking much, you are my favorite youtuber
i love this channel
Why this dude so damn talented. Love the outro songs
Your video is the highlight of my week, probably even life
my day got a lot better
If I eat this I would pass out from shear fear and deliciousness
“If you’re not afraid of raw eggs.” Nice reference
Ok guys so just if we believe enough we’ll just be ok or bad at cooking just believe
Where do i find the ghost urine?
I want to hear music you make other than for this channel. Do you have a bandcamp?
the scene at 2:35 was too intimate for me ??
make garlic bread you hipster
How did you come up with the concept for you suck at cooking? You've been round for a long time and still relevant.
Finally a new video
But what if my all purpose flour doesn’t want to be purposefull
Day 2 of subscribing: Finally the last epi- A NEW EPISODE?! Bye homeworks
Festive!

i love this channel
Ugh I’m so sad. I need my happy lamp
My pp hard

I love your dog
I'd honestly love to sleep in a hibernation fort.
Let’s get this pumpkin bread
At around 0:40-ish I realized it's almost Halloween! EDIT: Dude wtf, why do you need half a ton of sugar for BREAD? oO
OMFudgingG he's back
Dude, pumpkin nut bread is made from pumpkin nuts, from a pumpkin tree, not with pumpkin and walnut. That's a cheap knock off! Banana nut bread is also made from banana nuts from banana nut trees.
Seriously, those lyrics and that flow.... Please release an album. Or pursue a music career in some semi-serious capacity, anyways.
Damn that guy makes me question my sexuality
Will you do apple pie?
Y'all: Who buys pumpkin pie spice instead of just making your own? YSAC: MY MOMMY SO SHUT THE FUCK UP
Sacred Wang Jangler
let's get this pumpkin bread??
Screeeeeech XD I live for your videos :3 ????
Hi
Those were... really damn good lyrics! Who even are you today? :D
Now that song in the end was beautiful, really, do you have your music on Spotify, or a second channel? Would love to hear more.
That pumpkin bread is u n b a l a n c e d
Garlic bread, banana bread, and pumpkin bread.the holly trinity
I wasn't ready for that toothpick insertion...nnnghhhh!
Dude these vids are awesome!
Do you have to use these exact ingredients? Because I can’t find any ghosts who are willing to make this.
OHH ITS HALLOWEEN SOON
thanks for an awesome video full of smiles because of you
Damn, no full moon.
loved this ep!!
Winter > summer
Doggo
ok now it’s 100% he lives in rural southwestern Ontario
19 more till 100!
I always eat batter, sometimes it tastes better thank the actual cooked cake, or dessert in general. If I manage to find some cursed brown sugar, I'll try to make this pumpkin bread only to eat its batter.
You still suck at cooking after 81 episodes
I fucked a goat once.
Pumpkin bread is great for making grilled cheese sandwiches. The trick is making sure to use fresh cottage cheese.
Wait so if the eggs come from a possessed chicken, do we not let them say goodbye to each other?
Yo not to mean but when are my eggs
YES
It's been a while since you've been making videos...can you do a video reveal?????? Please!!!!!
I always look forward to these. Thank you!
Im sure you’re hot af Or cute af
and it doesn't make you a better person.
This was on my recommendations
This is the only channel with consistent quality content
Ok but the blanket fort looks comfy as hell
Your songs sound like early Weezer records.
Good morning everybody let’s get this bread
YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS NEW VIDEO
Most entertaining AND informative channel on Youtube.
These post cooking songs are getting more and more professional... If you pull a joji on us, just keep up the theme of being occasionally about food or cooking in some bizarre and surpringly rhythmic way (like you always do)
What's wrong with raw eggs?
But... but I care about what makes bread, bread
Where do you keep getting all these dogs
Thank you. I needed this today
Sp00ky
Cheered me up after the unfortunate events at the Chippenham v Maidenhead game
I want that mother fucking winter hibernation fort
This man lives in another universe where everything feels right
This video somehow just made me so happy :’) I love how he always inspires me and somehow even brings nostalgia up.
youtube says you have 2 new videos, yet there is only 1. Did you upload and then remove version 1 of this video or something? was just wondering what caused the YT error and figured it may be good for you to know as well. PS I like the way you wangjangle. Very rebellious. Personally I'm more conservative so I live in a tin can.
Do you have 50 different dogs?
1:05 killed me a little
I spooked my walnuts too much and now they're hiding in the back of the pantry and won't come out.
I appreciate that we both hate living on an axis
The song at the end was extra tasty!
Where’s Pimblokto?
The wild ysac has returned once again for its once in a couple year uploads, the people rejoice as it goes back into hibernation for another decade...
what did the pumpkin say to the pumpkin carver cut it out
I think he’s a dog walker!
Awesome Doggie!
Fruit cake is next
Wangjangled?
This is what I needed today
That winter hibernation fort is my dream
You know what guys I think I'm finally good at cooking
I fucking love pumpkin break I make it every year thank you
ew.
I complained last video about not having any ending music. And then this one comes out with a pretty long and pretty awesome song. :)
Finally a new video
oh my beautiful. and it looks absolutely delicious. i really appreciate people like you who take so much time to make videos for other people’s enjoyment. im nod of those people.
Great video! Can’t wait for next years upload
Missed you man
You forgot to tell us to bless the ingredients in the description recipe thanks now my mums possessed by an angry cow
Your dog is so cute!
Says the one who tried pumkin in touster
His music is actually great
What happens if I use a sad lamp?
Thank you.
The recipies a bit different, but me and my mom make pumpkin muffins simillar to this.
Is no one else gonna talk about how awesome that song at the end was? SO GOOOD!!
Gordon Ramsay can't beat him
THE COOKING LORD HAS RETURNED
I usually come here to hear the him sing. It's great. or did someone else sing at the end?
Can't wait for you're next tuesday-ish vid

Happy to hear that the wang jangle finally made a return.
H I B E R N A T I O N F O R T
what the fuck is this ?
I like the song at the end
When are you gonna drop an album?
are the dogs different every time?
HOW MANY DOGS DO YOU HAVE
What makes bread bread is the fact that 5 symbols have been organized in a way to communicate to people that what it's referring to has been recognized as bread.
cmon ysac, no one will ever be as good as your mom!
Can I get a Spotify link for that song it was actually amazing
Good morning chefs let's get this bread
The DOGGO
Finally
I like your sheep, he is good at fetch.
You know, YSAC, some of your videos of your dog are better than your recipes. (I buy my pumpkin bread at the local bakery!)

Pumpkin

That blanket fort looks comfy af

DAD?
My mom makes pumpkin banana bread its ??
Is the bread supposed to turn to a dog?
Am i the only one who gets emotional while watchin these series?
1000th
You actually confused me on what makes bread bread. Im so lost now.
I swear, this dude needs a Oscar!!
Wouldn’t recommend screwin’ the candy corn...high potential of genetically modifying it.
Uploaded at the same time Babish did, coincidence? I think not
For Tennessee it’s winter
Your dog is looking like my bathrobe
When does the You Suck at Cooking album come out?
When he said time is an illusion I really him to say that helps things make sense
i love it, thank you
I’ve wanted to try some of your excellent tutorials but I don’t know if it’s legal to wang jangle or capture coconuts. It doesn’t seem to be illegal where you cook. Do you know any relative areas where this may be legal?
This is one of the best ones by far??
PS great pooch
Why the fuck don't you have a music label?
My fuckin ghost doesnt want to haunt my flour anymore he's such a grouch
I didn’t get a notification
This music is amazing. Do you have a soundcloud or anything? I'd love to download a full version of this song.
This is so clever. A friend sent me this and I'm digging it. Will sub. XO
Where do you get all these dogs and beautiful scenery from?!
Why did my Fran send me this link to watch a man make a gold bar and play with a wet sponge
Holy heck, thank you. I didnt follow instructions clearly so got my dick stuck in the pumpkin
I have waited so long, and it was so worth it!
just what i needed
Can you tell me how you made that hybernation fort
Shit,Its my favorite type of bread
Where do you get all these doggos?
I've been missing the doggies
i missed the songs at the end
Glob bless you, sir wangjangler
I think the joke of harvesting a pumpkin within 30 days of a full moon is being grossly underappreciated.
I thank the Halloween Spirits for your videos!
Alright you got me at haunted salt. Totally not possible.
Reference from episode 68
I MISSED YOUUUU
Fucking amazing! They’re all good, but it’s been a while since you produced a genuine masterpiece like this one. Made my Halloween, which has gotta be the point, right?
i love that the songs at the end of your videos always sound like Weezer if they didn’t try to be cool
If you like summer because its hot then move to florida, every day is 100 degrees outside
AW FRIG YISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
I saw a dog. I'm a happy pumpkin.
35 pumpkins disliked this video
Yes you uploaded again! Thank you for the amazing videos!
Dude I miss these vids wish they’re were more of them. Great video man keep up the good work.
Finally I have been waiting for a new video I already watched all of them
Wow great vid see you next year!????
What kind of dog?
I love it
3:27 ??
You should put your songs on sound cloud
Inb4trending
So, now I can make a mean loaf of pumpkin bread but I still pretty much suck at cooking...
when's the EP comin out
Ended up with pumpkins growing out of oven, Instructions unclear
Send the ingredients to the pope for extra blessing
put the song on itunes
I could smell wet dog all the way from here
Nice song.
You silly twat. Salt can't be haunted. It is one of the main items that are used to fight ghosts.
Let’s get this bread
ok but that song at the end was a Mood™ thank you
Wait... this is a Halloween video!??
Yes give
I scared the batter too much and now its crying. Thanks for nothing, you monster!
OMG
I can’t wait to do this! I love your videos YSAC!
There’s a different dog every time
Finally
okay, this is epic
You always have different dogs in your videos. How many do you have?
That song is my life dude. I relate so hard.
“Now you wanna sneak one piece of candy corn into each loaf.” phone dies
What a jam
Why is it called bread when it's actually cake?
3:18 I remember when I used to make those when I was young. Those were the good day until I went to high school and got almost no free time left
Should I feel insulted that he is singing a intro about that a suck at cooking idk??????
Face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel
Can I be your slave?
Wow I've now been watching this channel for 3 years... It's great to see this channel grow to size it is now
That is NOT a dog
i NEED a winter hibernation fort
YESSSS.
If you released an album, The YSAC Soundtrack, I'd buy like, at least a dollop of it.
This was my early christmas gift, i am obsessed with your series
Good thing I have all the ingredients in my dungeon where I do my sacrifices
you dirty little pervert. were you scrubbing your onion??!
I live in Florida. What is this winter that you speak of?
For all the comedy (or whatever you're doing) in the videos; you do make some genuinely excellent food.
his voice sounds like tina from bobs burgers
Perfect
You drilled in the candy corn LMFAO
Best song of the series
With all these funky ingredients, I can't help but wonder what affect this bread with have on you once you eat it????
With two cups of sugar, think this deserves the title of cake. Don't sell those spooky ingredients short. Shame on you.
How many dogs do you have or do you rent them for your videos? I swear it's a different dog every time.
You put so much quality into this it's honestly amazing.
i have every single ingredient the only thing i dont have is a bowl
my father is back luvvvvg love lov
how long do i have to wait for news from pimplokto.....
If you can't curse your own brown sugar, storebought is fine.
not the funniest one :/
Guess what Read More I don't really suck at cooking
Wait. Are you english?
Oi oi oi where’s the egg saga. THE STORY MUST CONTINUE
Every time one of these episodes goes up, a little bit of me prays furiously for the return of the Egg story Arc. :'(
Lmao! The song
What beautiful location are you living in? It looks like paradise!
your good boye adds more quality to your videos
?
when is the album coming up? :P
Yay You uploaded a video!
That song was actually pretty good
i saw this and screamed
Huh... Today is a full moon. Looks like I'm going pumpkin hunting
This was posted at 3 am
Fuck yeah
0:48 scared the life outa me
make the canned pumpkin stuff with real pumpkins pls. there is no magical canned pumpkin in finland
I remember when you had around 60k crazy how far you've grown
Iam so pleased that you are still making video's!
You are my fav youtube channel by far
BUT WHERES PIMBLOKTO
Cute dog!
It aint spooky if there aint bones in it -69 or 420
This episode was just ok.
I've bred pumpkin bread before, but I've never tried baking it. Hmmm
Is the song going to be on the album?
Pupper
lets get this bread
This isn't trending yet?
you down play the life long horrific suffering of the cow and how most people do not have genetics to not be sick from the sugar in it alone let alone the protein with gets digested in 4th stomach of cow , didn't know you have a 4th stomach .
That was a really nice song at the end, good video
Can I borrow your drill?
Make more video pls
Is it normal to feel like you're falling in love while watching this video?
The sun is refracted somehow in the song... looks like a mushroom cloud sent to make eternal winter
Of course he’s a dog person
Glad to see someone who remembers to spook the walnuts.
Song slaps.
That was too scary can you please warn us next time when you make a scary video
Wow, how convenient! I guess I was waiting for this
my winter hibernation fort broke and I'm going to die of hypothermia or frostbite if I don't find a new one by December. send help.
Pumpkin bread is the best buttered and wrapped in wax paper. Being a little squished from being in a paper bag for a few hours makes it that much more nostalgic.
We miss Pimblokto! Just repair him
How many not cats do ya have
Littlrely my life
this gave me spook
wassup white boi
Nice
The song at the end was excellent!
God damn it, 20 seconds in and I'm in tears already.
11 months of winter? DO you live in Winnipeg? :3
I'm dying one hundo
Quick question guys!!!!!!! How do I know if my spices are haunted???? where did you get yours?????
Winter = the bestest.
I MADE IT FOR ONCE
Hey its how to basic that talks.
What about the wangjangler-3000
Master of cooking has returned
Finally a halloween themed vid lol
You got a rise out of me with this one..
Your drill sucks ass.
I can't wait to see more new content
You taught me something new, thanks! I always thought baking soda was the same thing as baking powder. Never saw a recipe that included the former, though.
Okay but i actually love you???
You need to post more my man
Dude nice dog! Congrats
YAY finally after a month! ???
"Winter can come for a month and then fuck off." a whole californian mood.
That's a damn nice fort.
I think I hurt my self-hitting the like button! Slow down kids, the video is not going anywhere.
These videos you make are so good, and the food looks so delicious :) And your editing is really nice One question, are you in college ?
xD I love how he's always making fun of shit but had the thoughtful realization to mention that people shouldn't eat raw eggs ;P
Holy shit, your outro song was especially good this time!
How do you know so many dogs?
i’ve been blessed this season
This would be perfect for stapling onto a tree.
This is scary
3:15 Möth joined in room
Who are the 23 "people" who down voted this?
Get it it’s all for Halloween
Salt can't be haunted. Everything else can, but salt, nah.
New YouTube update looks weird
How dare you call me disgusting for eating raw eggs. Maybe i can only eat raw eggs because thats all i have
Noice
These videos are becoming more and more insane! And I don't mean good, I mean actually mad.
I suck at cooking yea I totally suck
I didn't have any haunted spices, so I took the ones that I had and placed them near my computer speakers. I then played a compilation from YouTube of Hillary Clinton's old hag laughter, and that spooked them right up.
58k views 5.8k likes 5.8k/58k×100%=10% 10% of the people that watched this video liked this video I wasted a full 3 minute writing this comment and its getting late and tomorrow i have a math test and i have not studied one bit, i think i will fail the test
At like 5 million subs u should do a face reveal/not face reveal but q&a with ur dog(s).
Instructions unclear accidentally summoned the Pumpkin devil.
Is Pimblockto coming back btw?
Where can I get the orange harvest wand
This is cooking. This is comedy. This is music. This is ART.
I can’t believe you resuscitated congrats
I am literally on a school field trip watching this and all my friends are looking at me.
Never Clicked off buzz feed so quick......
What if I only have possessed baking soda, and not haunted baking soda?
50spoopy100me
i don’t like pumpkin
Report 4 too spooky
I only have a cup and a half of cursed brown sugar. Can I substitute the other cup for cursed regular sugar?
You Suck at Disappointing Me!
That was the best ending song he has ever done! Its so good!!!
this song a bop tho
yuuu suk at kookeeng yeh u totali suk!!!
The song at the end of this one was just fantastic! Love your videos!!
Epic dog footage.
Within 30 days of a full moon? Pretty easy I guess then
Bring back binblocto!!!
I have always liked your ending songs but like This one gotta be my favorite Its so chill
I'm sad. We need more episodes!
the dog bit was epic
succ bread
S P O O K Y B R E A D
I thought in the beginning you would cut the pumking and a slice of a bread would come out. :(
Placed it on the hanger. It fell off and onto my feet where it got busted open. I still suck.
Great episode, I really enjoyed the music afterwards
It’s weird how good at cooking he is
I quited babish's video to watch yours
Lets get that bread

"cordless kinetic screw driver" lol!
I hope you make a song with Bill Wurtz one day
Pumpkin bread sounds awful bet it smells of fart lol
Good dog
Amazing! YSAC rules.
Love the song ??

That was so so pretty
You are incredible! I subscribed for your sense of humour

Hi, I love your vids, but WHERE IS PIMBLOCKTO PLEASE I MISS HIM SO MUCH
Damn, I really wanted to see the dog shaking off the water
What's your sweet poochie girl's name? (and lineage)
Where are the Eggisodes
Ysac album needs to happen. Tunes so lit??.
Always impressed!
I want a piece I love pumpkin bread
Get your dog groomed, unless that's a Kurt Cobain costume you've got on him. Great episode
This cooking show isn't that great if still, after watching 81 episodes, I suck at cooking just as much as before
I caught my pumpkin during the bloodmoon 25 days ago . Will the recipe still work
is this a pie? I made pumpkin bread before and I've never put sugar and butter in it... but I'm from Poland so maybe my idea of bread is different
I love u ysac
Thank you for the great video honey??
This time, maybe I'll learn something.
Love u
That scared stick logic would drive many Christians
Where does he live?
every tuesdayish D:<
Yes, I do suck at cooking.
Whats with the Pentegram
Three teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice? You mean 1 tablespoon? What a fool.
I appreciate the amount of effort you put into your videos
hello people that are looking at the comments while watching the video
What happened to the onion?!
What happened to the onion?!
I prefer banana bread
1:44 Why didn't you let your eggs say goodbye? I know they're probably possessed but possessed eggs should still have the right to say goodbye.
i happy now
I wanna make a winter hibernation fort now :(
Fun fact: in french “magic wand” is actually “baguette magique” so that’s a super legit harvest wand
I suck at cooking, yeah, I totally suck... But how did he know?
Ok but the real question is, is pimblokto alive?
My doggo has the same ball
i love you
2:52 Now that's heresy. You need jesus.
Is Pimblokto still rotting in a closet somewhere?
You need to cut your dog's nails, dude.
So...can I have Ur dog?
Man I miss this channel Edit: the dog is good, pure
Oh guys I never looked at the description but its amazimg XD
30 days after a full moon. So.... whenever?
You better stop wishing for winter to go away. We are all about to know what that will be like permanently.
Man that fort is fuckin sick. Can we have a fort tour as your next video?
spice pumpkin
It’s going to be a good day!! Even though I apparently suck at cooking
The effort you put into these videos is amazing. It really inspires me to do nothing because I will never make anything this great.
Where the f do you live dude it looks like North American paradise
Yes
2:34 that shot made me feel uncomfortable
Just move to south america. Or Hawaii. Or anywhere south.
I actually really dug that song.
Why does 2:35 look so sensual?
I thoroughly enjoyed this video.
Plz put the song on Spotify
Lets get this bread
when are you dropping that YSAC mixtape ?
when you post is always the highlight of my day, I wait sometime many months to see you post and I love it, I found your channel around episode 20, and has been my favorite series I have ever seen. Just a quick thank you for posting such great content!
Because you make 1 video every year that’s why you get less views
Really average white girly
Omg i fucking love your vids... I live for them????????
Your eggs... you just dumped them in there without letting them say goodbye.. You monster... Wait.. Halloween special. Is that your costume?
Where can I buy those sacred harvest wands?
Hi
Wait what? How did that pumpkin goo changed into pumpkin bread? Man this is spooky..
Crap! I used the milk from a Mad Cow, instead of an Angry Cow... Feeling a strong urge to go on a rampage now. Cheers!
Spoopy.
Hello random person scrolling through the comments
??????
Guess I have to go pumpkin hunting now
Bruh, that black pipe was ABS not PVC.
2:34 ????
would it be good to use chocolate chips or no also is the something im missing like a show or website or no
Screw this, I'm just gonna drink a glass of raw eggs.
Still not over that pumpkin-pie spice trauma, I see...
Cordless kinetic drill lmaooo..!!
Tasty
Please do more and don't take so long in between
This is literally my favorite channel on YouTube
ty, i needed this!

I was waiting to see why you made a fort on your Instagram
Where do you even get all these diffrent dogs from? Are you a pet sitter on the weekends??
back in my day we used to do the PEPPER PEPPER PEPPER
ugoleh dog
When are you taking this show on the road? I'd totally by a ticket or two! I wouldn't go, but I would buy a couple of tickets.
Pumpkin bread is alive. We're all dead.
YSAC my local grocery store doesn't stock spooky ingredients nor power tools. Any other suggestions on how to summon Sata.. I mean uh make your spooky pumpkin bread?
Spoopy foods
yo that blanket fort looks comfy af
Time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so
One of the best channels on YouTube hands down.
you suck at cooking, more like you suck at uploading more than once a month
10/10
These videos just keep getting better. Thank you Dr. Chef Hands for these blessings.
Sweet puppers. Bread too.
you better put that song on your soundcloud, or else...
OMG YOURE BACK
Reuben, can you find my comment?
I am not sure if I can find those ingredients ??
Another vid of YSAC making a mess, as always. Looks like you got to get out the "Ready And Go 1999+2" to clean this mess up.
New pup? Or new to you? Either way, they are wonderful! Love the song, it's EXACTLY how I feel about winter months. ??
Face reveal video question mark
Great recipe! but i tend to add a pinch of razorblades for a bit more of a blood tasting loaf.
Damnit, I’m late. Well, still loved the video. The celery orange thing looked like a plunger.
Does showing with a EGG means that he is HOW TO BASIC ? Maybe he is?
Please show your face, I will tattoo it on my bun
Aesthetic dog footage??
liked before watching, you're welcome
Your dog is even haunted
spooky
how do u have access to so many dogs
(Maybe a face reveal in a year or something?!?!?!)
This is actually a cake; no resting, batter instead of dough, waaaay sweet
It looks like afghan hash
As a aspiring pastry chef i approve of this
??????????????
Noice jams!
no one says "oops" better than you honestly
Your dog has a better life than me
yo did you steal my dog cause my dog looks like exactly like your bread dude wtf
The end song was jammin though
Yayyyyy! Tysm dude!!!
spooky
"Captured within 30 days of a full moon"
I hate this video but I thumbed it up because: reverse psychology ????
I haven't washed my ysac since last Halloween
Man I sure miss dogs, wish they didn’t go extinct
He wont like this comment.
the dog montage at the end......... so cute
I squeaked when he topples the ingredients with that blessed orange thingy
Can i use this spooky bread to feed my duck?
This made me want to make some pumpkin bread and transwangdoodle it into a poodle and play catch.
Do potato soup please!!!!!
I need that song at the end
2,000,000 subscribers face reveal
Please release the ending song as a stand alone.
Raw flour will give you salmonella before raw egg does.

Megalovania starts playing ITS SPOOKY TIME

Thanks now my house is haunted with seasonal seasoning ghosts
Piano fingers
Where is your intro
We missed u fam welcome back and do more videos fr
Btw what's the odds of you trying to land a Pineapple 360° Inverted cake/pie?
I think ysac could start a religion
That montage of your dog was so darn cute
When you try to think of something funny to say so that he responds\_(• •)_/
Your dog is a literal ball of fluff i want him
At last ur back bro????
did the doggo try the bread??
After the hibernation make a new year food or something
This reminds of someone making a possessed salad...
Bitchin video! As usual! But that song at the end was jammin! Somewhere I can purchase that beautifully orchestrated piece of heavenly majestic music?
I said I would dress up as your upload schedule for Halloween last year, my friends haven’t seen me since.
If I don't have a ghost, can I pass the water through myself if I'm dead inside?
You comedy is so pure just as this pumpkin bread
3:57 demonetized, parents disappointed, god is angry, have a good day
Just a man, his dog, and some pumpkin bread....yes....
What a great day
bro do you live in narnia?
I always come for the food .... But stay for the Jam
uuuUuuuUUUuuuu spoooOooOOoooOoopy
Why did he use a liquid measuring cup for the brown sugar then a dry cup for the flour? I'll never understand why people don't know they are different
Angry cow butter,??????????
You just made my day a whole lot better

You Suck at Singing. :-/

Welp, time to start a YSAC binge once again.

Boop
Wait, I wasn't supposed to slice it up and put it in a toaster? My life has been a lie...
Came for the bread. Stayed for the dog. ??

I'm Earlyiiissshhh??? :D GIMME ALL THE PUMPKIN PLS
ok but if it tastes like cake why is it called bread??
Diss track on god when??
That outro song was really good. Maybe the best yet.
Who the fuck disliked 7 times
Would a wooden spoon be a valid harvest wand for blessing purposes? Or am I doing this all wrong.. my pumpkin goop seems lacking
Defintely BC.. right? Great video. Have a nice day.????
Where do you live? The shots with the dogs and the water are always so pretty
Ah, the baguette. The French sacred harvest wand.
YOU SUCK AT SINGING YEAH YOU TOTALLY SUCK

Happy Tuesday. Let’s get this bread.
All I have is mad cow, will that work?
Every video you make gets funnier
I liked the song at the end.
I think I look forward to your videos more than any other channel. So damn funny.
Phillip starting to look pretty dead at this point.....call TMZ
Spooky food
All kitchen joking aside, raw flour is not safe to eat.
03:18 Damn thats my childhood..
I found the candy corn
Here before trending
but the cow is not angry what should i do :(
Roses are red, chickens go cluck you suck at cooking yeah you totally suck
The scariest thing is I’m still suck at cooking and it’s almost the end of the year, And also I still eat batter with raw eggs on it. No worries, it got blessed so it won’t be so disgusting.
YES YES YES! Thank you! <3
Thumbs up if you enjoy the jingles at the end of all his videos
GOD IS ALIVE
0:31 I don’t know man, that seems like the most complicated ingredient
This video feels like you were in a hurry to make it. More than normal.
Jeezus... YOU KIIL A PUMPKIN!!
YSAC has some deep lore. We need to conduct a study on YSAC time traveling, cuz this is getting out of hand
Pepper pepper pepper
Trumpkin bread.
Thank you.
I wonder if fans from farther south watch this episode and wonder why half of the episode is being passive aggressive toward winter. I'm from Minnesota, so instead of enjoying fall I whinge and yell at the sky for taking away my 16 hour days and turning them into 8 hour days. The sun sets before I can get home from work in mid Winter. I should get a SAD lamp too, thanks for reminding me.
Another hilarious video!!!
0:28 Can I use Diet Ghost?
YAY JUST IN TIME, I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP
oh no the white girls are coming
Next Video Coming 2019
Damn, I was hoping to be better than his mom
I hope you upload more videos man because it helps me to be happy and forget what is happening in this cruel, cruel world
Omg ?????? this was so funny
Oh wait shit I'm early
I thought your channel dead
Why do so many annoying hipsters subscribe to this channel???
lets get this ???read
H A U N T E D
I can beat your mom in a cooking 1v1
sooo.... just gotta wait another month or so until a new video then
So, if you made a scary pumpkin bread using some frightened ingredients, does that mean that when I'm scared of people it makes me ready to spook some people on Halloween?
I've been blessed with pumpkin bread this morning. Thank you wangjangle gods.
great vid bro keep up the good work
That baguette looks like it was violated....??
I’m sorry but that toothpick scene was WAYYY too sexual for me. ??
So I have low haunted seasoning will that still work?
Yassssss
Getting Car Seat Headrest vibes from the song. Keep it up ????
I showed my step son your channel one day and he got hooked. Every time he comes over he wants to see a new video! post more please? Already watched all you have out there
I’m am the 303rd comment
James I love you. Wanna live a mutually abusive relationship together until nothing in life matters anymore?
ily
Finally men! soo good to see another new video! love ya
this channel is what you'd get if Exurb1a and binging with Babish had a kid. i love it.
Pumpkin bread comes out the same color it went in. Fact.
hope you have a good day. thanks for the recipe and the laughs
Pumpkin spice season is almost over. The two months of Xmas are almost upon us.
Omg i have the same hand mixer (/???)/
Ahh ysac. You don’t post often, but when you do you know it’s gonna be good.
OUH MY GOD YOURE FINALLY BACK
Omg, it looks good. I'm starvingggg.
Pupper footage made my day.
Damn it! The cow wasn't angry enough. I was so confident in my ability to piss everyone off and I have failed. Well, I give up.... I'm kidding. I hate to lose. I'm bringing in the big guns (my friend. He can piss of anyone. First he makes you laugh. Then he's lying on the floor covered in blood. Oops) The funny thing is: I was halfway through a sad video, mourning the loss of my favourite character before I noticed this video and came to cheer myself up before going back into mourning
What is this? Hogwarts?
I'm having trouble going for that autumnal forest walk. Any advice?
I NEED MOAR VIDS COOKING! I'm just kidding it takes so long because you pour your heart and soul into these videos. I'll wait :)

“You suck at cooking ya you totally SUCK”
Good morning. Have an excellent day why dontchya.
Yay! Another YouTuber from the great state of Texas!
On one hand I literally cannot believe that anyone who once lived in Washington would ever voluntarily return to place like Texas, and on the other hand is literally impossible for anyone who’s not a millionaire to have a kitchen that large anywhere near Seattle
The attachment you had on the kitchen aid originally would have been best to beat the cream cheese. What you added was a whisk which is intended for more liquidy substances like eggs.
For your next review you should take a look at Volcanic Panic. It is such a weird edutainment game, although it is kind of fun.
"Bobby I tell ya h'what that is some good yum yum. You don't even need any propane accessories to make it!"
"Texas desserts" He didn't even make Frito Pie. For shame.
BOP IT!!
Great video as usual, but I'm really starting to want something other than food videos. Just my opinion though
You should do a video on Pajama Sam 4: Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff! Its actually real
What in Sam hell did I just watch
i mean... thats not really how you fold but it worked out in the end! but please if you ever do bake something in a future brutalfoods please learn how to fold properly, it could mess up the dish and make it flat if you dont fold it right ;;
Don’t pretend to be a redneck it’s weird
No Ian folding is when you take a big spoon or rubber spatula and gently scoop the bottom onto the top of itself and you repeatedly until it’s all mixed this is done so that it doesn’t loose it’s fluff and it’s less dense you don’t need a mixer
Most underrated YouTuber. Your level of quality is very rare...steak.
I live in Texas. I'm glad your in my state! : )
I thought it was illegal to be gay while riding a bull in Texas. The bull is libel. Bull letting dummy on his back for dumb bullshit vids ... to the farm .
i love your vids omg make life amusing and entertaining again
I'm glad to be in texas
Not. Enough. Y'alls. If you want to represent Texas cuisin properly you can NOT skimp on the Y'ALLS !
Thats what I like to call A Plop
Fu*k u make more televoid..end that sh*t but not fast atleast add 2 to 4 episode
has Ian finally transformed his channel into a cooking channel ?
try takis
You really need to do one of these with your friends, it would be funny to just see you and Austin both competitively cooking your own respective dish
love your fridge, just popsicles huh?
The editing in these videos is top notch. Hoping the next video is either a game review or another Yugioh product
I made the Texas Yum-Yum! The only change I'd make is the store-bought crust; I got two smaller graham cracker crusts, which were perfect for the same amount of filling, but the taste of the crusts themselves was a little lackluster. I'm going with two crusts of the same size next time, but I'll make them myself for better flavor. Even with the generic crusts, though, it was pretty tasty. My friends had seconds (and thirds!), and my dad gave me formal permission to make it for family dinners in the future.
More like Brutalmousse, am I right?
i love me some brutal foods! x3 MMMM-mmmm! (seriously though. great show. im very entertained)
look teaster
The most befuddling thing about this video is how after a certain point the line between Ian’s cowboy accent and his actual Texan accent fades into obscurity
The hell happened to the game reviews?
"Mm them suckers tasty!" Brutal Moose
Should I be worried Ian is keeping 30 men in his freezer?
I like how Plops can make both cow and horse noises. What a versatile fellow.
I don’t want to get to the age where I worry about breaking a tooth on a sweet
Not a fan of pudding but that cowboy bark looks very tasty.
You should check out binging with babish his basics series has some good tips
Tip: use a rubber spatula to push the confectioner's sugar off the side of the bowl a couple of times during mixing (like, turn it off, scrape down, turn it back on. Don't scrape while it's running). Anyway, this pie looks so good. Looks better than the allrecipes picture IMO. Honestly I'd just skip the vanilla pudding. Just the chocolate pudding and the whipped cream mixture would be delicious.
No, no more food shit, I’m gonna lose my fucking mind ?????
For whipped cream you are supposed to go slow to fast when mixing
Not gonna lie I actually thought that kitchen was green screened for some reason. Then he opened the fridge and I thought “oh shit, it’s actually real”
My wife claims she can make anything better than you. (We are fans btw)
Is it just me or does Ian’s legs look shorter?
You know, you might like "Super Seducer" - it's a game filled with FMV! It's basically like a "choose your own adventure" kind of thing. You get good choices and bad ones, it's pretty hilarious!
Look up folding on YouTube
I have zero idea who else has been able to give you any tips but here's mine to add to the pile: - You can do the same thing you did with the Werther's with the peanuts, almonds, pretzels, and Oreos. A heavy rolling pin will work much better then a hammer though since it's wider and you'll be able to, once everything is a decent size, roll the pin over all your pieces to help break them down into smaller pieces. - To help some the confectioner sugar problem, turn off the mixer once in a while and scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Depending on how much sugar you're using, you could only need to do it once since confectioner sugar pretty much melts instantly when in contact with any wet ingredient. Spatula's are pretty much your very best friend when it comes to getting anything out of a bowl.
Question, do you have to be riding a bull while making these desserts or is that part optional?
i grew up in texas and i ain't never heard of none of this
this looks like one of jenna marbles' old kitchens
Holy shit I cant stop laughing at the Farmers Only page. " Preferred body type: Living or recently deceased"
Folding means to move from the outer edge to the centre while mixing, usually with a rubber spatula. Also that is one sexy kitchen.
Nice kitchen dude! I guess it's true what they say about Texas.
every time ian pulls out the whisk something in the back of my mind just goes “god dammit”
1:36 stealthy myst joke! nice nice
Rattlesnake on another rattlesnake
Ian, your editing is so beautiful; love it, man.
Watching you manhandle that KitchenAid hurt my soul
You should typically fold anything with whipped egg whites with a rubber spatula, so you don't deflate the egg white's stiff peaks.
I was having a bland day till I saw this Brutal Moose video
do you do weird movements on purpose to edit later, or do you just notice them and add weird edits?
Still waitimg for Plops fanart to show up
I love your channel so much since you started doing these videos
Howdy from Dallas! Love you Ian <3
Remember to watch your sugar intake. Its so bad for you in many ways but if you become diabetic you're fucked.
on this episode of "ian learns how to use a mixer"
Your videos always feel like slightly terrifying fever dreams
The fucking sound effects. Bring the whole thing together.
The echo is terrible
Don’t let PETA see this.
Whenever i react to your videos i find other peoples demons come out of me and i catch it and tell them all to go home and let my soul breathe
His Kool Aid tho
Damn Ian, your hair makes you look like the MOST majestic cowboy.
stay amazing
I appreciate your work.
Where do you live again? Because your local store sounds super crappy.
32:30 Plops plopped.
Remember when Ian used to review video games
This is so f÷%×ing stupid

I'm gonna miss the cramped kitchen All hail the open wide one
My buddy. My pal. My man. I’m gluten free and they’re very different. But now I feel you should do a weird gluten free food episode :p
What was the intro music?
Ooooh a new brutalfoods kitchen? So big and fancy!
15:11 I feel like there was a missed opportunity to do an echo effect on the word somewhere and have a kind of "lost in space" thing. xD Other that the editing is amazing as always. Love your stuff!
Big yeehaw energy
SPAH'S SAPPIN' MAH TASTY TREATS ! YeeY !
i love brutalfoods more than anything else!!!! AMAZING!!!!
19:09 to 19:20 had me laughing so hard
Don't you mean Tasty Stupid Treats?
My beautiful moosy boy! ??

This guy reminds me of a pinterest post gone bad... except he seems proud of his fails.
its cooking cowboy jesus
Boooowls
i feel like you're secretly a DJ, you sample yourself more than Skrillex.
recipes are not direct directions instead you sure use it as a guide so that the thing your making goes well . so maybe next time making this you should think maybe you should put less of (this) or more of (that). for example the pudding you put in the first recipe but you could not listen as watching you messing up is kinda entertaining.
you should get yourself a meat tenderizer for the kitchen. It's just a mallet with spikes on one side, but it's got more surface area on the heads so it doesn't damage the food (or the table for that matter)
10:15 more like phoned it in xD
I recently discoverd this channel, and I gotta say: It cracks me up. The gamevideos but especially the Brutalfoods stuff. I love the editing work. So much thought and detail, fun, cheesy soundeffects and even self-mockery. It's hilarious and awesome. You've got yourself a new sub, sir.
That's an awesome kitchen. I'd wager you're either around the Frisco area or the Mid-Cities?
Brutalfoods suggestion: Plz review the frozen microwave white castle cheeseburgers and hamburgers
As a baker I'm like screaming at the screen. When you are mixing ingredients you need to stop the mixing and scrape the sides in then continue mixing. You also folded it wrong. Also it's easy when everything is room temperature when baking well at least for me Personally I would have chilled each layer to make it spread better
Mmm, that oversized fridge blocking the door triggers meeee
#stopyeehawbullabuse
If there weren't these random bits of editing in there, Ian's vids would not be the same.
After watching a few of your videos I know now why so many americans are that „mega fat“-kind. How many calories does that thing have and how many grams of sugar? I‘m fat but just watching this I feel like I would get an instant sugar shock xD
Agh! Ian nooo. You do not fold things in using a stand mixer. You remove the bowl, take a silicone spatula and fold everything in by hand. See this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZcebw9XZo With the bark: you mentioned a really hard time eating it. The chocolate needs to be a bit thinner, and less toppings next time, which makes it easier to eat. Hope this helped.
Try making something with Vienna Sausages ??
Idk why but this got me in a Christmas-y mood
Any chance we could see a Brutalfoods and Cheftronic crossover episode some day ? That would be hilarious.
i feel like the reason i like your videos so much is that we are kindred spirits brothers in pun, united by japes good video ian 10/10 i hope plops is treating u well
PRO SOUTHERN BAKING TIP TIME!!! Cream cheese beats way easier if it's room temp. Next time you use it, leave it out for an hour or two before you use it. It'll combine better and be less chunky. Welcome back to yeehaw territory, buckaroo.
I was left with the satisfactory taste of these foods, my mouth then said Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
15:03 so when your an old man you'll go to a sadistic jail that pits you against other inmates in endurace competitions because you stole a bag of werthers?
You've yee'd my last haw, partnet.
Hey Ian how was eating at Whataburger again
oh...OH...ohhhh
Glad to see that the "plop" sound effect makes a return.
That's just a theory... A FOOD THEORY!!
Ian, I love you but I honestly never realized how much of a giant pussy you are... I hate sounding like a dick but you're a gentle little flower are ya? ??
"Beat it until it's soft" - Brutalmoose
That edit at 20:43.... Damn that was slick
THAT was, but this isn't.
good video love the editing its pretty good keep it up on those sound effects dude
I see you over there at ohio
Get a kitchen hammer
Watching you cook is just so.... mesmerizing. Like you're so bad at it but you're trying and it's adorable but it bugs me too and it's just so fascinating
Your editing is the best and funniest!!
#Smallmonds
Happy brutalween
The Take 5 bar is so underrated.
Lol I love how your microwave says "your food is ready"
Your eyes are saying "Why did I do this?"
Mr. Ian, it has come to my attention you failed basic english. You see, when the instructions said to FOLD in the whipped cream in, you used the MIXING machine. In order to FOLD in whipped cream, you need a spatula and literally FOLD the cream into the mix. Overall 3/10 would recommend
Holy shit, man I'm from Oklahoma.
fold in is basically gently stir it by taking the stuff on the bottom and fold it over to the top with like a spatula i recommend looking up a video
Hi Ian! It’s not your fault the Kitchenaid Mini didn’t scrape the bottom of the bowl. It has to be adjusted the first time you use it, with a coin in the screw on the side. You just turn it, try it out, turn a little more, until you can hear the paddle scrape softly on the side of the bowl. Looking forward to more Brutalfoods and hope Texas is treating you well! Love from Germany
West Virginia
Hi Ian, long time fan, an idea for a future episode of Brutalfoods, Chocolate Cola Muffins! I make them all the time and them suckers tasty ?? my wife, nephew and myself love you and your food videos keep up the great work, Jonathon, Amanda & Jake ??????
Oooh, I like your fancy turn table!
It's pretty cool knowing one of my favorite YouTubers also lives in Texas though I live in Lubbock it's still cool
New kitchen is really good but i missed old kitchen :(
30:20 "isorrowproductions here with another game of Hearts of Iron IV, diabetes only"
Guys, I think he really enjoywd that "Texas Yum Yum"
Yay~ More brutalfoods :D How to fold, translated into texan (accent: stereotypical) [because aren't I so witty] 1) Carefully scoop yer light stuff on top of yer heavy shit. 2) Wit yer mighteh spatuler, hold yer wedge blade at a ninteh degree angle per-pen-dic-u-lar to dat giant ass bowl of yers. 3) Slowly drop yer spatuler til it hits rock bott'm. 4) Rotate yer bowl thirty-three degrees (or a smidgen, just not a rooting tootin rotation, save that for rodeo partner), while spatuler still in the fillin'. 5) Once yer done rotatin' that tarnation, scrap the spatuler on the opposite side of the bowl til bottoms up. 6) Bring the spatuler back to where you started, but don't you tread on that mixin's durin' so, son, and repeat that darn tootin' process 'til the lord sayeth otherwise cowboy. Normally folding doesn't matter unless you need the fluffiness is integral to the structure of the dish (like souffles, or those weird jesus cookies my mother made that one easter to teach us the resurrection before I decided me and her god weren't friends any more, etc), so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Also, you might not want to call out to ramsay he might die seeing you chop with a knife (you could just do a pulse or two in a blender/food processor if you have one)
I just made buttercream frosting in an electric mixer before watching this, so the struggles you were facing with it were hilarious anf relateable. My stuff always gets stuck to the sides, too.
I absolutely love this video, I've watched it at least 5 times in the last 48 hours, love your videos brutalmoose!! :)
I must say, watching your videos is like escaping the bullcrap of the rest of the world??
It makes me so sad that he didnt even mix the ingeidients knowing well enough that thw mixer didnt do a good job on the sides of thw bowl lol
ian how could you betray me like this,,, gluten free pretzels are more dense, sweeter, and crunchier. the superior pretzel. everyone ive ever talked to prefers gluten free pretzels to regular. slanderous cowman
The beginning is an accurate representation of how we do things in Texas.
Ian, just wanted to let you know that you are my absolute favorite Youtuber. You are the only person I ever get excited about when I see you have a new video up. Keep on keepin on, son.
Thats not really how you fold cream, try wikihow, they know everything.
9:09 your wish can come true if you get the spoon that you had at 4:15 to clean the sides
im making the fuck out of texas yum yum sometime very soon lMAO looks like you're in a house now!!! congrazzi!!!
do you have any thoughts on continuing telivoid? it got left of a cliffhanger.....................
Dark chocolate is one of my favorites! ... 70% is the best :P
It was painful to watch you miss the salt, that recipe needs it. So of course it was not as good :(
Normally, I'd approve of a big kitchen. But when Ian's not fumbling around in what's essentially a back alley with a sink, I feel like we're missing a certain... something. An extra layer of unneeded difficulty that we need.
Not mixing the two, bummer
brutalmoose You still haven’t covered the award winning pc game The Sims 2
Folding it in is to like put it on a spatula thingie and just fold it in. the whole point is to avoid mixing as to not destroy all the air bubbles and keep it light
i'm so glad i'm subscribed to you bro! keep on the great work :)
Boi that is NOT how you fold it in. Use a rubber spatualy to LITERALY fold it over and over gently. Take a quick look at a binging w babish vid.
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: Softened means you let it warm to room temperature Using a stand mixer you have to pause a few times to scrape down the bowl to make sure everything is evenly mixed Folding is where you put a fluffy ingredient over a dense one. You push your mixing tool into the middle and scoop across the bottom toward one edge, up the side and back toward the center of the top. Then you turn the bowl a small amount and repeat until everything is mixed in.
Texass
Ian! To fold something in means to incorporate slowly with the help of a scraper in such a motion that you lose as little air as possible, it's kind of a circular motion, you'd have to look it up, it's hard to describe. It is done with very light preparations like meringue, or creams. It is done by hand. Sincerely, a gastronomy student. Good luck next time you fold something!
"not sure if it's gonna make it through the crust" literally holding a device made for crust (etc.) cutting Oh, protip: when slicing a pie, to avoid making a mess of the first piece, cut out the pieces next to the one you want, so the first retains shape on exit.
Ian I Love You But Your Kitchen Has So Much Echo
“I’ll shower you in coconut cream pie”
btw, when you measure out something like confectioners sugar or flour, you are supposed to use a sifter and sift into the measuring up, otherwise you're using way too much as it'll be packed into the cup.
you thought gluten-free pretzels were the same as normal pretzels? my dude, how did you live to adulthood being this clueless? and you were surprised by the hard chocolate after keeping it in the freezer for half an hour? and you couldn't foresee the need to press the toppings on the chocolate down to make them stick? and you didnt realise that if you filled up the pie crust with chocolate pudding, nothing else would fit? some of these aren't even cooking errors, they're like navigating the world properly-errors, like pouring a glass full of milk and continuing to pour. i guess i shouldnt complain since thats what i watch for. also "folding" something means that you take a spatula and fold the new ingredient into the mixture by, you know, lifting it up and folding it over itself. like... the meaning of the word 'folding'? oh and "beating" means mixing fast, which is also implied in the name. you are a clown of a person. love u.
Also less chocolate. Speaking from experience
considering you used 2 bags of chocolate morsels, I would do 1 dark and 1 milk.
Nice
at 4:46 turns into ana Kryczbowtv's mushroomland series.
That Texas yum yum reminds me of something I used to make when I was a kid called black bottom pie or something. It was almost exactly the same except for one extra layer at the bottom that was lightly melted chocolate chips. I've gone off chocolate as I've gotten older but I remember really liking it.
darn, never ran into any youtubers in washington, although i ran into the completionist in LAX
Another bark you can do: Milk chocolate bark with crushed candy canes. It's a nice Christmas treat. Oreo truffles are good also. Mum taught me these. (Metric measurements, so bear with me) 300 grams Oreos. 250 grams softened cream cheese. One standard block of chocolate. (I use Cadbury milk chocolate.) Method: -Crush Oreos fine. (In the bag works for the crushing process) -Combine with softened cream cheese. (Make sure it's soft!) -Melt chocolate bar. (You can break into squares and melt in the microwave. Thirty second increments, make sure to use a fork to stir and make sure it's free of lumps.) -Make golf ball sized (Or smaller, but not too small) balls out of the combined cream cheese and Oreo mixture. -Coat them with melted chocolate. -Place onto a tray lined with baking paper. -Chill in fridge for at least two hours and then devour! It's like a ball of Oreo cheesecake covered in chocolate.
Increase mixer speed to high with the whisk attachment to fling everything out into the bowl (instead of sticking to the whisk)
Couple tips from a culinary student, a thread.... To start, when your chopping maybe spread a damp paper towel under tout cutting board, to stop it from sliding around so much. your technique needs work, but not the worst, i would just try to keep the knife down on the board and rock it with the tip always staying on the board.
I love the cooking/tasting videos!! They’re great and I hope you do more!!
In the UK we have a pasty called "yumyums" and they're really sweet and usually covered in sugar
idk what i was expecting with ian cooking but wow that made me physically recoil at almost every step. you’re doing great, keep up the good work
10:37 you made The Stuff god help us all
The pudding looks really good and I'm so happy he came in on that bull in stay the costume for the rest of the video too funny ??
I don’t love chocolate pudding. It’s disgusting.
If you heated the choclate in the oven on the paper you wouldnt need to use a bowl
19:25 chocolate rain
folks, I was literally thinking "partner, y'didnt even dress fer the occasion. points taken off." but points're bein added. this cowboy is mighty happy
Come on Ian.... you just didn't want salt, we can understand
My boyfriend and I were drinking and watching your video. Then we saw your "folding" technique and decided we needed more alcohol.
You remind me of Blake from Workaholics
For the peanuts. Just throw the amount you need in a plastic zip bag, get a cutting board, put an at least once folded dish cloth between the table and the cutting board, put the closed zip bag onto the board and then..... HAMMER DEEZ NUTS DOWN. I recommend getting a wooden meat tenderizer hammer, since they are quite wide and also useful for things like tenderizing meat if you don't crush peanuts.
Is no one gonna tell him that isn't folding...?
Take 5 is good tho
you should do a gluten free taste test of original foods compared to there gluten free counter partners
Why would you leave Washington???
I love how much fun you have shooting and editing your videos and they're so creative and interesting because of it. I think you're the youtuber I get most excited for when your notification pops up saying you uploaded. You could literally just make a video where you microwaved your leftovers and I would watch it. Please keep making awesome stuff!
where i live howdy is a very kind and warm welcome
as a joke you should cook some beef on a future episode and this is plops and then so him with a rips sign, then a sad montage, and then cook the beef as if it was him your costume, who agrees leave a comment on thumbs up, if like this idea!
That clock is really doing the work back there. Might want to start paying it for keeping track of time so well.
The Texas Yum Yum reminds me of a dessert my friend makes. It’s graham cracker crust, cherry pie filling, whipped topping, and I think there’s 1 more ingredient I’m forgetting. It’s pure sugar and tastes really good.
for the pudding one you should let it freeze some more till its almost sold, really tasty that way
P L O P S I S D I S P L E A S E D W I T H Y O U R O F F E R I N G
Is this like the third kitchen you've been in on this series?
get a haircut
Ian, this is how you fold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L44FtTXTxWk Great vids man, I'm always excited to see a new vid from you :)
The Bop-It noises when you were taking off the mixer killed me
0 out of 10, you didnt even fold it
i am instantly offended
0/10 for folding. thats mixing not folding
Faster than a rattlesnake on a second rattlesnake.
Your editing always makes me happy
Plops needs to be a recurring character.

Who edits his videos? They do an amazing job lol
where's the game reviewing?
I think the channel name should be You Suck at Cooking
You're an idiot...in the best way possible!
I find your lack of kitchen aid knowledge disturbing.
hope you have settled in your home
If you want to make the bark again, just use a broken up Heath bar for the toffee, though maybe crush it up as fine as you did the Werthers so it doesn't break your teeth. Also, a crushed up Butterfinger bar would have been amazing. Glad to see you're learning some great techniques. :)
This video made my day.
Instead of werther's, use crumbled up heath bars.
Aw man can’t wait for the episode where Moosey cooks Plops Steaks
Only you and Gordon Ramsey can making cooking look fun.
We definitely talk like that here
Browsing through cooking videos(stoned of course, weed just became legal here), but man these are awesome to watch sober or not, you’ve really figured out how to captivate an audience and keep them entertained, instead of just talking and showing us how to cook, you add in these little extra bits to the video that make it more exciting to watch, I can say I’ve never once laughed my ass off at a channel about cooking! definitely subscribing, keep making these awesome videos!
love from Dallas ???

Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
Texas seems like such a wonderful place. I have a friend from Sherman and he talks about it sometimes.
What part Texas u in sun
I'll say it again, these are so great.
Damn, child, guittard chocolate?! Dems some fancy eats. ??
I'm German and the way you pronounced Werther´s hurt my ears pretty badly xD | I liked the video though ! (Also pretzels sounds fckng weird to me haha)
6:57 when I load up PornHub for the 6th time that day
This was in my recommendations for some reason, and I clicked on it expecting to see a pro in the kitchen, and instead I just watched a video of what it looks like when I try to follow a recipe ??
When I saw you substituting werther's HARD candy for toffee, I said outloud nooo. You don't want to put something that hard on stuff you need to chew. Give that at a party and all your guests will crack a tooth. LOL.
I like how Americans call, throwing boxes of processed food together…. a 'recipe'
When things get stuck on the mixer, put it at a higher speed. It will separate and attach to the bowl like it should.
I... I don't know whether this lack of knowledge is scripted or not, but either way, I absolutely love it. The funniest thing to watch. But also the saddest because it insinuates that Ian has barely baked anything before-- (p.s. ian, if you honestly don't know... invest in a rubber spatula thingy to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl.... pls)
plop
Ian your editing gets me every time. when you squashed that guy with a bowl and then his ghost flew up i lost it
i love this show so much! please never look up cooking tips or how to do things, your stumbling through is the best part!
Sea salt on dark chocolate is amazing, would have probably helped your bark. Plop

Why do you have backup pretzels? We barely even have normal pretzels.
I miss the tiny kitchen
Just looking at the layers that was WAY to much milk. Was the cup and a half from the pudding box or from their recipe?
>texas desserts >no texas sheet cake Understandable tbh. I never had it until I was adult, despite living in Texas my entire life. It seems like a more rural thing, since the only times I've had one I didn't just buy from H-E-B were when visiting my grandaunt's family on the farm. But damn is it amazing. It's sweet and moist, but kind of subtle. Make sure to make one with brown sugar icing.
Great video, i'd advice to thin out your chocolate and even it out more, you had some really thicc chocolate, so no wonder it's overpowering.
Smallmonds.
This editing is amazing, sort of reminds me of Tim and Eric
Can I borrow some of your glorious hair good sir?
I never realized he's from Texas, I guess he does a good job of hiding the accent when he's doing videos.

Wow. Don’t know how I found you dude but I’m glad I did! Great content! I’m from Dallas,Tx too!
Back in Texas, huh? Does that mean more collars with PBG?
The editing is on point.
You may want to get an electric wisk for the puddin', and a drink blender for the nuts and oreos. As for the Werther's you want to melt them down 1st like with chocolate then pour it thin on parchment paper thin it out let it set then take a mallet to it to break it down. Then if finer pieces are needed you can put the crushed thin Werther's chunks into the blender.
Why did u get it
You in the country now boy !
America.
I never thought you lived In Texas the Place I live
Is that really how you think Texans talk? I'm offended quite frankly. Your standards are waaaay too high
Now that you're back in Texas, you gotta stop saying "you guys" and start saying "y'all" again.
invite me over and ill cook with you :^)
Welcome back to the greatest state in the union!
Welcome back ian. ?? Looking forward to more future videos.

What kind of grocery store does this man go to
The thing you should've done while making the layers for the "Texas Yum Yum" is that you should've put the pie in the freezer/fridge for each layer. (Also if my English is horrible I'm sorry it's late)
I have officially changed my Horse's name to Plops on Red Dead 2
cooking tips from a cook in training every time you use a cut put a damp cloth under the board makes it more stable, and it makes to easier to chop. when chopping use the tip as a pivot and cut with the heel hand on the back of nife apply downward forces then rotate by 5 to 10 degrees and down again until you reach the maximum you can and go do the same in the other derecshen as fast as you can , ps aly warcks as good as sharp the knife is. try a cloth bag or a rag tied shut then brack the candy in it less loss of smashed goods.
You didn't correctly fold it in
Already been commented, but damn that's a nice new kitchen.
when using a stand mixer youre supposed to scrape the ingredients off the side of the bowl every so often so everything gets incorporated properly to fold ingredients, you take something like a spatula and mix by gently placing the spatula to the bottom of the bowl and fold the ingredients at the bottom of the bowl over the ingredients at the top of the bowl (hence the term "folding"- im bad at explaining things so try googling it if u still dont know how, or try watching like. rosanna pansino or smth) toffee and caramel are slightly different, in that caramel is often just caramalized sugar (which is just heated sugar with a little water added) while toffee is sugar and butter (sometimes with a flavouring) you could have very easily made your own toffee had you so desired however, in the end, none of this matters as long as you like how the final product came out, but just for future reference ig :0c
Why isn’t this a show on the food network channel
I was definitely wondering why you had gluten free pretzels. They do taste different, but I actually like them better. They taste fancier to me, but also less strong on the pretzel flavor. But I also haven't had the real thing in years, for reasons you may suspect.
Damn you always upload such quality content with great editing. Keep it up!
Your food makes me horny
Whenever cutting nuts you should roll the knife
fuck you ian
This is some top-notch video editing and composition. Watching these is always incredible.
you should rename this video "ian vs the kitchen aid"
Damn what shitty store are you going to where they don't have heath bars and all pretzals are gluten free
plops made a big oopsie but he still a thiccy
sniffffff, GOOD
How did you escape the televoid

More of this crap please less of the other crap thank you.
This is very spooky! just in time for Halloween!!!! ??!
You have the same model mixer as me! Nice. Those boys are good.
I like Brutal Foods because it's like watching those people from infomercials trying to cook.
It was so yum they had to put 2 to really sell how yum it is
Pro tip: don't follow instructions.
A cup of sugar... holyshit. 4tbs already kinda sweet with that size
Lost it already at "seeking a: cowpoke"

Pudding pies are great, but I loOOoOoOoove Icebox cake. Just a layer of graham cracker, a nice heaping layer of pudding, more graham cracker, more pudding, then cool whip on the top. Simple, but sooooooo... yumyum. XD Pudding in general is just amazing.
You were definitely in the gluten free section lol, pretzels are just another baked good. Also, Schär gluten free pretzels are as good as normal pretzels, if you want gluten free ones I recommend those.

33 Minutes of Red Dead Redemption 2 Gameplay
18:24 You... NAILED IT!
Great, now I’m craving every single thing in the video. Had to laugh at the “folding” segment, folding is done by hand, not with a machine, the machine just mixes it. You get a large bowl, put your cream cheese stuff in, then with a spatula you scoop some topping up, lay it on top of the cream cheese, then flip that part over. Keep adding topping and flipping over the section you laid it on. If it doesn’t seem very even try scooping up a section of cream cheese/topping and flipping it over on top of another section until it seems fairly uniform. The idea is you want layers of different things to accentuate the different flavors and textures, not a uniform paste.
We don't take too kindly to folk like you 'round these parts.
We'Re GoNnA cOoK yOu On A fUtUrE ePiSoDe
See ya later partner.
When you grabbed the mixing piece with four fingers I just thought to myself: you fucking savage.
Who the hell dislikes a video with this much time put into it? Even if they didn't like it they could still appreciate the effort. :/ ian gang out ??.
If the mixer doesn't get the sides very well you got to scrape the contents of the bowl back into the center with a spoon or rubber spatula.
30 men in the freezer
THIS NEEDS TO BE A NETFLIX SHOW!!
My gran from makes a version of the chocolate bark. Much fewer ingredients though. I never realized it was a texas thing.
I don't like chocolate pudding.
Salt supposedly reduces bitterness, so maybe the dark chocolate would be less overpowering with that extra bit of salt. Suuuper jealous of your kitchen btw.

You're a Texan? You were really giving me Canadian vibes
This video receives 2 Plop points for its two uses of the sound bite "Plop"
i just realized why i love your editing so much. its very Bill Wurtz -esq. and i mean that as the biggest compliment.
I had a feeling he was going to over do the candy smashing
dawg. I love this shit. at first, i was very resentful because i enjoyed game reviews more. but this is a great evolution of content
Love the Halloween costume
I miss the pc game reviews but this shit is still great
Your editing is amazing ian
Love the Bop-It reference hidden in there
moose? in my city? you bet im bout to catch him on the streets. gonna give him a TV dinner.
At what point did you realize that your channel was destined for cooking videos?
You should invest in a food processor, it helps speed up the process when it comes to chopping, plus less hammers needed. I love your videos and watching you grow and learn more about cooking while enjoying yourself. Also, I love your editing so much, your style is so unique and fresh. I appreciate you so much, for every bit of content you do!
lol you got gluten free pretzels edit: yes they are different PS your grocery store sucks
I swear your editing is some of the most entertaining, creative and wacky stuff I've ever seen. 11/10 hats off good sir.
Hey! My mom has celiacs disease, and you should avoid Gluteno honestly. The quality of their foods (particularly crackers) is not very good. I've found far more delicious gluten free alternatives than their brand ??
so, idk how it happened, but this became a meme food review channel, and i'm okay with this.

As a native Texan, I approve this message Y'all. Also welcome to Texas, Ian. Enjoy your stay?
Ian when are you getting a brutalmoose fursuit
Please make more videos about video games and movies
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great
The clock never changes its time. This all took place in one single moment.
Isnt Texas yumyum just Mississippi mud pie?
Ian you could've just broken the candy with a rolling pin without breaking the bag and having to leave the room!
0:37 I think that’s the river in downtown San Antonio
Watching Ian cook is both adorable and frustrating at the same time! It’s like watching a stubborn child try to figure something out by themselves. On one hand, you wanna say, “D’aw! Keep it up buddy! You’ll get it!” But on the other hand it’s like, “omfg just let me show you how to do this ya little brat! I love you but I have things to do before I turn 90!”
Have you heard of Oreo Pudding Pie? It's goood...
He doesn't live in the Texan south, he doesn't know what REAL Texan cuisine is
btw to get the sides u gotta turn of the mixer, scrape down the sides, n start again. ALWAYS SCRAPE DOWN THE STUFF ON THE SIDES CUZ MIXERS DON'T GET IT! U also could've microwaved the frozen whipped topping for like 10 to 30 seconds to make it a bit softer to spread.
To fold something in, you add it to the mixture, used a spatula to dig to the bottom of the bowl and pretend that you're folding an omelet over. Do that a few more times until it's mixed. Also, with a mixer, be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl every now and then!
im from Texas im pretty sure the accent that people do is exaggerated but i say y'all alot i say y'all too much actually
I live in texas and i never seen some of this shit wtf
Wait are you in dallas?? Fan meetup pleeeeaaase
Is this Red Dead Redemption 2?
Texas Yum Yum, I've had it before, as my sister lived several years in Texas, and would make it when she came home for Christmas. Good stuff.
Chorp plop bowl make more food videos this one was great
Red Dead 2 is looking pretty good
Are you really gonna scroll past this without saying Howdy?
Man, never stop making videos.
Red dead redemption 2 looks amazing
Hola coming from Dallas
Dude... just scrape down the sides with the spatula. I love your videos but damn do they make me happy my school made everyone take 2 terms of Home Ec lol. Also made us take 2 of Wood Shop, then you chose the rest. I appreciate the balance. You shouldn't measure the ingredients with the wrapper on XD
#SprinkleBae
Hi ian! im also an amateur chef! im pretty sure you were doing well with chopping those nuts at around 16:26, also, when you used the flat of the knife to crush some of them, that is also something you can do! just not for hard things like nuts. more so for garlic imho. try using a meat tenderizer (any hard object) against the nuts when they're in a couple plastic bags instead, next time. Edit: oh lmao, you did that with the werther's
Rolling pin does a better job.
Crushed Heath Bar is a nice substitute for crushed toffee bits.
when you're crushing buts you should use the side of the blade-
Use a rubber spatula to scrape the inside of the mixing bowl and to fold in the whipped cream.
Love this
So you probably figured this out by now, but you were using the whisking head at first on your electrical mixer. That's no good for thicker ingredients like cream cheese. Also, minor note, when the recipie calls to "fold in" something, you're supposed to make a flipping motion and repeatedly "flip" the base mixture over the ingredient you're adding. I know it might seem unimportant (it wasn't for this recipie) but if you're baking something and the batter isn't mixed propretly, the product may deflate or not bake correctly. This looked great by the way. Totally making that Cowboy Bark. Thanks for showcasing these recipies.
I question anyone so confounded by simple pudding. And there's no way you can go from a tiny apartment to that tricked out kitchen. Somebody moved back in with the family. No shame just saying.
I think the kitchen is so biiiig that now there’s a multiple Ian’s coming out of nowhere
"Preferred body type: Living or recently deceased"
You remind me of Kurtis Conner in the best way possible.
Ok, but Ian is fr hot.
Try it with tapioca
next time, add the salt straight to the chocolate for the base to cut through the richness just a little, and maybe marble some peanut butter/dolce delece in as well. i also wouldn't add oreos as it makes the texture too hard, but add more pretzels definately. also, maybe some freshly cooked, blitzed bacon--just be sure to drain any grease. (i know it sounds weird, but honestly with the nuts, pretzels, salt, etc. already there it would actually work surprisingly well. just don't use milk chocolate for your base if you ever try it.) PS next time you chop nuts, just use a blitzer/food precessor. no muss, no fuss is the Texan way.
Ian: lemme put extra chocolate Ian later on: chocolate is overpowering Never change
Oh yes!!! Yes!!!!!
this video was really stinkin' good
I didn't scowl on my yum yum and it tased a lot worse
noooo you moved out of seattle? i was hoping to someday bump into you
Watching you fuck up the Mixer brought pain to my soul.
When baking, I have learned that you fold things in by using a rubber spatula and gently scoop it all together in a way where it will stay fluffy.
4:46 was that the ted-ed opening?
is Ian a stoner?
Ian, you use a spatula to fold something in.
We'll need some MILUK
Please don't cut nuts like that ever again. :( It's dangerous. The baking aisle at your local grocery store should have pre-chopped nuts in small bags for you to buy. Or you could do the bag technique, but use a rolling pin to roll over them to crush them.
your clock doesnt work did you know
"Fold it in" Proceeds to put it in the mixer.
Nice kitchen, you should try some gluten free recipes!!!!!
are those real plugs in his ears or?
i made choclate bark before with white and milk choclate and m and m
3:21 its cannon that all episodes of https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC18ju52OET36bdewLRHzPdQ (brutalmoose) takes place in a cartin of milk dimension, i need to visit it some time. and is being viewing buy a moose god making pie that is also booth inside and out side the milk cartin dimension 8:47 NOW WHO(you should check out Dr.who if you thought this was a good comment) WANTS TO FOLLOW ME TO VICTORY! TO ONE DIMENSION IN A RANDOM CARTIN OF MILK DIMENSION.
Just some tips: DISCLAIMER: I am not a chef, I just really like to cook 1. While mixing, if you scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spoon or a spatula, it will incorporate everything that is stuck to the sides. 2. Folding is a technique in which you incorporate something fluffy and aerated into your mixture, in your case the cool whip, without beating out all of the air. You simply put your mixing utensil, it can be a spoon, spatula, or even a whisk, into your bowl, and while holding it, rotate your bowl a bit, giving it a little mix, and then gently fold the mixture over itself. Repeat until it is evenly mixed. If the way I described it is a bit unconventional, I'm sorry. 3. The thinner you spread out your chocolate, the thinner the layer of chocolate in your bark will be, and try to get it as even as possible so that you don't get bites that are overwhelmingly chocolate (not that it's a bad thing, but you want to be able to taste the actual toppings as well) but you did your best given you only had a tiny baking sheet and tiny freezer. 4. Gluten-Free baked goods (breads, cookies etc.) are often made with rice flour, because it contains no gluten, which is the stuff that binds baked goods together, so they're not just crumbly pieces of cooked dough, and is also what makes bread chewy. Replacing the regular flour with rice flour, and also the subsequent absence of gluten is why your pretzels might've felt and tasted a bit off. A good replacement if you have celliac or any sort of gluten sensitivity, but if you can, just eat the normal pretzels.
but really who tf has the time to critique him on folding? just let him LIVE
New Brutalfoods episode: 11/10 Folding in ability: 1/10 I love your kitchen shenanigans, Ian, even when you make me cringe by taking the correct mixer attachment off and putting the wrong one on! Keep up the good work!

Welcome back to Texas Ian
here we have a review from Texasyumyum, titled "Don't let the devil consume your bum bum"
Welcome back to Texas, if you're even old enough to drink go for classic Texas Tea. Mix of 5 alcohols, citrus flavors, and a splash of coke. https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/classic-texas-tea-2273736 <3 It's fairly popular in the West Texas college towns I grew up in.
Are you ever going to continue tellevoid?
i like these types of videos and i think you should keep making them, but i would really like it if you brought back the gaming videos because i really liked them and miss them
Pudding pie is my favorite dessert for the hollidays
None of that is from HEB how is this texan
Aye whats the song at 13:32 during sprinkle time? I am desperately searching for it!
Today on brutal foods - I moved back in with my folks and used their kitchen to film
Ok, I'm italian, so excuse my curioisty and please understand my ignorance... in the U.S. you drink so much milk as it seems? for example in my country it's very very difficult to find someone who drinks milk during lunch or dinner. Most of the people, except children, drink milk only on brekfast (if they drink it at all).
how much did that thing cost you :D
TOFFEE?! JUST GET HEATH, HEATHEN.
Ian moved to Texas? time to just perpetually live at a kroger until i find him
When did this become a cooking channel?(Although as a cooking channel it is kinda like a actual cooking version of you suck at cooking.)
STOP USING YOUR FINGERS FOR STUFF
when using the mixer you should have a spatula to get the powder on the side of the bowl
I love the THICC portions
The new kitchen looks amazing and I'm sure there's lots of room for more craziness, but I miss the tiny kitchen and seeing all of it from one camera angle.
Damn dude. Is that what YouTube money gets you Kitchen Wise? (Spoiler Alert: I doubt it)
im in houston for christmas you should have a meet up id love to see you <3
don't be afraid to put full blast on the mixer
I swear my friends kitchen looks exactly like that.
you didnt fold it in... but the topping doesnt look so airy it needs to be folded in or anything so i wouldve done exactly what you did.
Has a sound person or anyone else commented yet about the ringing sound? at first I thought your voice was hitting something's resonant frequency but then you can hear it on its own at 24:31-24:40. Is it a fan in the background that gets noise-cancelled properly but only if everything stays quiet? That'll never do! I mean unless it comes out in post.
I’m Minnesotan and I often say y’all
30 men in your fridge wait what
I hope your parents watch your videos
Not one “darn tootin’” in the entire video. I’m disappointed, Ian.
Ian, I love your content but your lack of cooking/baking abilities made me frustrated. Still love these videos ????
Plops looks a bit thin... feed the damn thing, Cowboy Ian!
Puts more chocolate than the recipe asks for... Companions about that he can only taste the chocate.
Wtf I never even got to meet you while you were here in Seattle
Ian, you seem... shorter. It must be that Texas has stronger gravity. I suppose everything is bigger in Texas (except Ian).
...is this the old smosh house
These videos are some of the only videos that make me laugh super hard. The editing is the best I've ever seen it's hilarious!
Welcome back to Texas Ian, I missed you. I really wanted to Cowboy Bark to be something special! But that Texas Yum Yum looks mighty fine too. The crust still seems a bit small though...
So did he move in with his parents or is this his own place in Texas? Not judging, just curious.
the dang sound effects at the beginning tripped me up so bad that i genuinely was cringing at how much mud you must've been getting on that kitchen floor, i've never felt so stupid in my life. like...i knew there wasn't really a horse/bull/cow beneath you but my brain really played me
Wtf did you move AGAIN???
When a recipe tells you to fold something into something, evidently what you're doing is making the batter light and fluffy by incorporating air into the mix. Gluten is a substance present in cereal grains, especially wheat, that is responsible for the elastic texture of dough. A mixture of two proteins, it causes illness in people with celiac disease.
god I cant watch this fool cook things. hes just like egoraptor.
Okay I can't stand it....Ian...to fold an ingredient in you need to flip everything together starting from the bottom of the bowl. you need to do this manually. It pretty much is just stirring slightly differently, but its done to incorporate air into the mix - source my mom and all the years I've been cooking
I wonder if Austin is insulted by that introduction
Editing was top notch this video.
Can confirm
is this red dead 2?
Stick!!! The werthers!! In!! A food processor!!!! Asfkgll
Hits "crust" umm smells good
I don't know why but the AOL door opening sound with the open fridge had me in stitches.
So you're going to wear that every time you cook right?
Yum. Yum.
Fold in means take a spatula and then put the whipped topping into the mixture, slowly take the mixture and kinda flop it on top and repeat, kinda like folding sheets
1. Scrap the sides of the mixer with a spatula 2. Fold stuff in by gently "folding" the substance into itself
That hair!!!   <3   For recipe #2, put the peanuts in a bag and hit them with a hammer also
must not comment! i fix these several times a year they aint this hard to make. also place chocolate on baking tray then heat in oven save the spreading
I agree with you Brutalmoose, when you read out the ingredients for the Cowboy ?? Bark I was like “Ugh dark chocolate.” Lol great video as always!
This is easily the best channel on youtube the production value here is unbelievable
I always like how clueless Ian is in all his food videos
ive been going thru a rough time lately and this video really cheered me up... as always your editing is on point and seeing u just acting natural and fun is so refreshing, thank you so much for posting, youre amazing
My mum mentioned that the clock doesn't change from 1:50 the entire video and now I can't see anything but that.
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
It’s Incredibly Hard For me to Take Him Seriously With His Long Hair,Hat,&,Inflatable Bull Costume
It's only been a minute or two but I gotta say: I love your choice of font.
I was watching the food channel a few days ago and honestly, i really want to see Ian cover Cookie salad... because legit its the strangest thing I've ever seen. You serve it warm and its like a pudding? plus you eat it during the main course of the meal.
Your channel and editing reminds me of Cow Chop and Idubbz with some dashes of Eric andre
You should have used an ERGHHHHHHHHHHHH sized sheet.
I hate pudding and Jello. Didn't even like it as a kid. Come at me, losers.
"To yee, or not to yee..." "that is the haw"
If you have a food processor, it makes chopping (read chorping) easier. I'm pretty sure there's a pulse option, so that it doesn't just become a fine powder
As a Texan I can confirm we cook all of our meals while riding various animals through our kitchen
Who I feeding this poor boy? He doesn't understand any food
In the use of a Kitchen Aide mixer: 1). Scrape the sides of the bowl fairly regularly using a spatula ("Scooper Thing") that way it mixes evenly. 2). The whip, which you first started out using, was the right tool for softening cream cheese. You had the right idea to push the cheese out and mix again, but it's easier with a spatula. 3). You can go as fast as you want with a hard or semi-solid ingredient like cream cheese, but when mixing powder and liquid it's best to start on a low setting like 2 or 3 until it's mixed in, this prevents you from getting a face full of powder. 4). The beater (second head you attached) is the correct head to use for folding in ingredients. It's best used on a mid setting, don't put anything in while it's running. Folding in performance 6/10. 5) Always scrape your mixer heads with a spatula before removing them from the mixer. That way nothing goes to waste and you don't have stuff dripping everywhere while you move it to the sink. Doing great, keep it up!
When you're mixing with an electric mixer, pause it half way through and use a spoon to mix the outside parts that didn't get mixed, then resume the electric mixer.
The kitchen is too big Just like Texas
brutalfoods makes me want to be a master chef you should be the host of hell`s kitchen Ian
I want to see a cowboy Ian movie
When I first read it I thought it said Desert recipe reviews hahaha that's a bit culturally insensitive and geographically inaccurate.
My brain is going to explode from the editing.
lit subscribing because i love your use of chromakey. (also texas)
Looking Good, Cowboy ??
Ian's finds out about gulten free pretzels in the worst possible way
>Takes off beater >"Since it says to beat it, I guess I'll use this." >Puts on whisk Ian nooooooo
@ 10:49- Plop levels have reached an all-time high. Also, sounds like he's going to the bathroom :/. Otherwise, this is a fun video to watch! :D
for some reason i now what to see ian wear that get up at a cowboy action shooting contest
I don't understand what the "Folding" accomplished, just toss it in there and let it continue mixing.
Toffee bits are in the baking section next to the chocolate chips. They are the best!
Your reaction to the gluten free pretzels was great ??
I love your mom's kitchen
"I think I just add it in with it going slow?" I mean, no, that's not what folding in means, but also it'll work so who cares
Texas rocks! Brutalfoods rocks! I'm not from Texas but I know that state rocks. Thanks dude, please do some more "poppin cookin" and frozen dinner videos.
Best hair
This was dogshit.
I just wrote my exam and know I failed it even tho I put a lot of effort in it. This gave me joy
24:28 look to the right
OK ok oh my God ok you have to scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula YOURSELF the mixer can't do it for you.... And folding is using a rubber spatula to gently scoop under the batter or whatever it is and literally fold it over itself until mixed. Usually it keeps air in things of you need air in your batter and to gently incorporate things without fuckin up your shit.
not scraping the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula...REEEEEEEE
Ian confused in the grocery store would be a great video and also too relataable.
Penis
I just noticed it was a 30 minute video but that’s ok
"I love Werther`s" I see... 'click unsuscribe'
When you sniffed the crust I was ready for the Freddy fish 2 “oooooooh” voice clip
I love love when you put a video out I don't want you to me lie cuz your videos are like gourmet food you got to wait for the right time to eat it and the time is now Can you could read the phone book and I would watch it cuz your so damn entertaining is that series Televoid! Ever coming back? Keep up the good work every time I see one of your videos you make my day make me so happy and I feel so happy you can make my worst days feel like the brightest
I love the editing
I can hear dentists crying in the distance
Someone get this man a rubber spatula
I just moved to texas within the last few months too. Are you doing a fan meetup any time in the future?
I had subtitles on when the video began so when I saw [galloping] I immediately clicked like. lol
Pulling out the ingredients for the first recipe just gave me flashbacks to my friends who likes baking complaining to me that everytime she wants to bake something new and tries to google the recipe it comes up with a US recipe full of premade ingredients that you can't buy anywhere else. Haha.
23:16 communism
The editing is still top notch.
Why do you look photo shopped in your own kitchen lmao Guess its the lighting idk
I already loved you exploring food in these videos but your editing makes it even more fascinating and fun, never change ??
jokes aside that is actually proper knife technique
Not living on the coast really reduces housing costs.
You’d think it’s a Johnny Test episode with all the sound effects and whip cracks ??
Red dead redemption 2 looks sick
Ian you missed the opportunity to do a Halloween treats video!
To fold, first only fold by hand. To fold, use a rubber spatula and mix in batches using a slow figure 8 motion.
10 out of 10 as always mutalbroose
i could practically smell the chocolate...i gotta make me some of that yum yum
man, the new red dead redemption game sure does look strange.
The editing cracks me up so much
Yeah, I stealing Plops for Red Dead 2 horse name. Thanks, Ian!
folding in means exactly what it sais. You need to get some flat spatula, put your ingrendients together and then fold it, take a spatula, put it in the thing, take a spoonfull of thing and turn it upside down. fold it like you fold paper.
You added to much Chocolate to the bark
i dont like "chocolate pudding". I mean I like chocolate pudding but what you made is a CACAO pudding and its disgusting.
4:52 M-O-U-T-H-F-E-E-L IAN
WHAT THE FUCK WHY HAS IT BEEN 50 FUCKING YEARS SINCE YOUR LAST PC GAME REVIEW I AM RELLY PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW AND IF THE NEXT VIDEO ITS NOT A GAME REVIEW I AM UNSUBSCRIBING
Boy howdy, I wish I had 30 men in my freezer
Ian has anyone ever told u that u are some sort of half-horse half-human hybrid?
I wanna make a vid to show you how to be more efficient and use proper techniques, but your terribleness is so endearing and funny.
E
"that looks correct"
this is amazing
I lost it when the ghost came out and then got slapped
The cookie sheet size description killed me ???? where can I buy the Ian sized version
rip tiny grandpa
Ian next episode you should eAt A TrAY of tUbiFeX WORmS
Go vegan you lovely moose!! Ps our hair is almost the same length
Run the mixer faster and it'll fling the cream cheese out as it goes, the paddle will struggle with the topping and sugar. I feel like the yum yum was enough for two pies. I'm a shitty "from the can spray stuff" whipped cream guy. I hate the frozen stuff. You needed a half sheet pan. That was a quarter sheet. When you use parchment paper, lay it down with the curled side down so it stays put, if your need extra stickiness, a quick Spray of nonstick between the pan and paper does the trick. Get a meat mallet for bag pounding. Also you can mince garlic by peeling the garlic, putting it under plastic wrap on a cutting board and hit it with the meat mallet. Lets you move a bunch of garlic super fast
Most cooking videos you watch somebody who knows how to cook trying to teach the unlearned masses. Brutalmoose shows us someone learning how to cook. Also I love I got a Red Dead Redemption ad while Ian was grinning manically as he smashed Wether Originals.
This channel has gone through such a ridiculous change and I've loved every bit of it.
Your horse is so we’ll be haved :)
This intro is probably the best thing I've ever seen.
"Its not quite as good as the picture, but this is my first time" That could go many ways
Pretty accurate to an actual Texan
this editing is SO GOOD
dude i love the edits you do for all your hand gestures, they always crack me up
I'd kill for one of those Kitchen Aid mixers...but I'd need both money and counter space...
First time seeing cream cheese?
Cream cheese is an abomination almost as bad as mayonnaise. Were it not for that, I would TOTALLY be into the Texas Yum Yum. *fist shake* GOD DAMN YOU CREAM CHEESE FOR RUINING YUMMY DESSERTS!!!!! DX (Also that is the EXACT OPPOSITE of "folding in" when it comes to baking.)
That hair is gettin longer than a horse in the middle of winter (no idea what that actually means)
How do I subscribe twice
It would be nice if TexasMoose would appear as a minor reoccurring character from time to time
add cream to the chocolate next time, it makes it less brittle. and you fucked up on the folding again. Use a rubber spatula and just fold it in by hand. Self explanatory
as a texan, i fucking love this video.
w h a t i n t a r n a t i o n
You should do some Halloween themed foods!
Sad I never ran into Ian in Seattle
Oh, Ians into some freaky shit, huh?
You didn't fold....but I applaude the effort
Aww man! Ian, you're so dedicated! You moved back to Texas just to make this video in time for Red Dead Redemption 2! Hope Rockstar rewards you good for this! ??
4:52 talk about a tasty lick Ian knows how to eat mmm~ ( ?° ?? ?°)
wow ian, this Read Dead Redemption 2 Review is great!
Top shelf editing, nicely done and excellent work on making this fantastic video, also all the foods in the video look mighty tasty <3
I turned on notifications and got nothing thanks YouTube now I ate my burger like a normal person.
Wow, red dead redemption 2 looks great 0:24
15:00 I want a Werther's
Ian keeps moving into places with bigger kitchens. It's going to become such a big problem that eventually, his whole house will just be the kitchen
yum yum
I don't blame you moving from WA especially seattle. Rent is outrageous.
As someone who has been around those kitchen aid mixers her whole life (my mom makes cakes at home), i sorta...hurt...watching you struggle with it, but I was laughing like crazy so it was okay. (Also when stuff sticks to the side, use a spatula to scrape it off and fold it in while the machine is turned off)
I loved this. Good video :-D
all videos from now on need an ian wipe
so, is this the halloween video?
Other Ian at 24:32 makes me nervous
You have to fold in the cheese, David. Fold. In. The. Cheese. David
Dude, you need a slap chop!
I was honestly concerned you were going to put your finger in the mixer while it was running
The Texas Secret: Hammers and Holes
you need a rubber spatula for melted chocolate ian, its too sticky for anything else
Love the kitchen, but There is a lot of reverb. I wonder if there's anything you could do for it. It's not that bad, but it's really easy to notice.
I'm actually in love with all these videos you do, and they always make my day so much brighter. Thank you so much for your beautiful editing skills and your humor and your wonderful skills in the kitchen, and keep up the amazing work!
Why do you look so much like Sohinki from Smosh Games?!?
If you’ve never had it and you’re from Texas, it’s probably not a “Texas treat”. Not to mention it should also include incest since it’s Texas.
It's nearly midnight and I want to run to the store and grab the ingredients for Texas Yum Yum why must you do this to me Ian
Fantastic video, but I think you coulda slapped Plops a little less, he was trying the best he could.
The lighting and kitchen looks so gorgeous that I thought the whole thing was a green screen XD
What i got from this video: The south will rise again.
You're editing has given me a second life thank you. Great video.
proud to be a texan with ian
Should have just mixed the cream cheese in a bowl with a wooden spoon
Your sound effects and editing is so extra I love it! That level of detail is top notch.
Ian just got back from Ram Ranch
Do this for every states and their stereotypes please!
19:15 made me cry, I love your videos so much! can't wait for the next one!
For future reference, you can use a spatula (that scooper thingy) to scrape down the sides while it's mixing, just don't like, stick it into the blades.
I swear you house is the same exact design as my friends house
Sometimes I wonder how human males even survive....I guess that's why so many of them are desperate to have a girlfriend/wife
yeehaw? More like yeenaw ?????
Kitchen looks good Ian
PLOP
Red Dead looks so good
Your audience demands a glutten free review episode
Take 5 bars are fantastic.
watching this with closed captions on is pretty great [Chill, boppy music as Ian desperately struggles]
I love this video so much! I laughed a lot. I enjoy your editing style. It really made my day better.
One of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time. Keep it up Ian!
you should have used Werther's Soft Caramels instead.
Does this video ever fucking end? I feel like ive been watching Ian slap his horse for hours now.
Ian! Why'd you change your icon? I loved that weary moose.
Looks like this guy has way too much fun editing ????
puts in extra dark chocolate there's too much dark chocolate
i fucking love these cooking videos
i love this channel so much
I am 100 percent Texan but I hate ALL of America. Especially bull riding cowboys! Lol jk.
Ian I love how you don't know what you're doing but you cook anyway. It's great for people who don't know how to cook to see that, because anyone can cook, you just need to be like you and just try it, even if it doesn't end up perfect the first time
Dude the PC release of RDR2 looks so damn good. Likely going to buy!
Holy crap! Your kitchen layout is the same as my dad's! Now I have the same attachment to this video as you do to Texas Yum-Yum!
Pause at 2:01 Howdy, they call him Texas Ian. He is anything you need, And I mean anything. Even love...
Welcome back to Texas!
I can no longer discern reality from cream cheese.
Did anybody else scream when he rode in on the bull ???????????? I can’t with those freakin slap noises
Southern / Midwestern potluck food is not remotely good for you but it does tend to be incredibly tasty. If overly sweet.
Loved the use of the green screen at the beginning, Cowboy Ian. Kudos!
Thank you for sprinkles
I hadnt watched this channel in a while and i came back and saw this and holy shit i couldnt stop laughing these are actually hilarious great job man.
This is the craziest review of Red Dead 2 yet
Ian I love you and I've been watching for a long time but I see some of these videos and question if you've ever eaten food before.
We really don't deserve Ian but I'm glad he's with us in this ol cowboy place called Earth.
You know it’s going to be good if he has that great value!
Folding is what it sounds like. You take a rubber spatula, and fold the mix over whatever you're trying to fold in.
...was that a cherry mondo lmao
Plop
The funny thing is that there’s really only Latinos/Latinas where I live in Texas (Fort Bliss)
"Texas yum yum" is called "sex in a pan" where I'm from
Been playing a lot of Red Dead 2, I see.
whos kitchen is that
Texan here and WTF is Texas yum yum??? Loved my whole life here and haven't heard of Texas Yum Yum lmao
The editing is perfection! ??
The peanuts, and other brittle ingredients can be put in a ziplock sandwich bag and hit with a rolling pin
Brutalmoose! that is a bull not a horse! I do not think you can ride a bull like that around lol (I could be wrong thought lol )
Heath bars are toffee, they have em at checkout. Most grocery stores have toffee bits in the baking section next to the chocolate chips. Werthers are hard candies, not toffee. They will not eat the same
this made my day, even if I am a day late.
nice kitchen
I'm definitely going to try the Texas Yum Yum.
I'm subbed and bel rung, but I can't find this is my sub box.
WHY THE FUCK DO I SEE ANYTHING BUT THE ALMIGHTY HEB BRAND PRODUCTS!!!
PLOP
12:01 Every year, millions of plops gets abused each day by their owners, you can help stop it today
P l o p
You are a master of dry humor!!
WHY DO YOU FREEZE THE WHIPPED CREAM!? YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE!
I really love the idea of Brutal Foods, Ian keep it up man, you're awesome!
Thank you, Ian.
Probably wouldn't hurt to invest in a potato masher.
19:09
THATS NO CUP! THATS ONE OF THEM FANCY SPOONS MY WIFE GOT
This is seriously the best editing I've ever seen.
i can't believe you stayed in costume
Folding in ingredients you make a cavity in the center of the bowl of other ingredients, put the ingredient you need to fold in in the center, then scrape the edges into the center and mix it from there
I loved watching “Touch the Food: The Episode” and especially loved that “Full Strength Strongman” Metal song cameo!
I love the lighting in the new room
yo take 5 is bae
You are the best YouTuber.
We Washingtonians lost an awesome fucking moose. We'll miss you buddy, but we won't miss a video!
i fucking swear, my grandparents have almost the exact same kitchen/(at least from what i saw) house layout
make a video on the glutino pretzels
Do another video on lego land 6
I want Binging with Babish to collab with Ian
welcome back to texas, you da best!
Where is the next sex game review
what's the number cause I'm pretty sure this is now the third kitchen
your videos are an art form
Hee yaw
I hope he went to HEB for all these ingredients :)
I'm disappointed you used Great Value instead of Hill Country Fair. 0/5; not Texan enough.
Ian not knowing how to use a mixer is gay culture.
"did I correctly fold it in this time?" No. Folding is done by hand. It's literally an action where you fold one ingredient over the top of the other.
Plop
You mean african american chocolate? Gosh Ian be more sensitive heccin Texan (Lmao love these vids alot!)
The day everything goes right in a BrutalFoods video is the day I unsubscribe.
Remember when this channel made video game reviews and had a rivalry with Caddicurus
I really love your sense of humor and editing style! (also "plops is displeased with your offering" should be a new reaction image)
The farting ziploc bag made me laugh so hard I had to pause, this is peak editing.
18:24 Okay tutorial heads!
The brutal foods kitchen reminds me of one of my classmates kitchens from elementary school in Texas lol
Ian buddy I love your egg tea towel! It's freakin adorbz
I might actually enjoy cooking if I had someone fun like you to cook with, haha. I hope Texas is treating you well so far! Nice digs!
As a Texan, I didn't know that's called a Yum Yum..? I make pudding pies every thanksgiving. Though I add a bit of cool whip to the pudding. Always a hit ?? /obligatory YEEHAW!
1:37 sign: stoop
My culture isn’t your DESERT dweeb Texan gamers rise
Could have named this video Brutalmoose do Texas
Did you eat my snack pack??
21:31 WHY MUST YOU REMIND ME OF MY TORMENT!
This video didn't show up in my subscription box.
WELCOME BACK IAN!!!! BOIIII HOWDY!
@brutalmoose you can hit the 2 on the microwave for an automatic 2 minutes brah
Ian do you have a no Google policy so many questions could be answered by that but I suppose it would be less entertaining so keep up your confused bumbling
I could watch you poorly cook kindergarten level food all day Ian.
Can you please do a whole video on "those things"?
Every time, I think to myself, how can watching someone cook for half an hour possibly be entertaining? Every time, I am wrong.
No, Ian. You did not fold it in correctly. You get an A for effort though. I love you ??
As a Texan I highly enjoyed this video ?? I said to myself" Hey, that looks like a Texas kitchen!" and then you said you had moved back to Texas XD
This was half an hour?! It felt like 10 minutes!
what's the episode where he talks about bugs bunny! and what was up?
I want the recipe for that pie. Though I also wonder if theres a sugar free version? I want to make one for my brother but hes diabetic ;-;
thank you for another great vid, please stop using great value. of you use normal quality ingredients you food will taste better
Oh man this video killed me ?? love ya Ian!
It's strange that Ian, as far as I know, lives alone but buys a whole gallon of milk.
Who’s you’re editor I love all of the dumb transitions and sound effects
Also, are you drinking from a Kool-Aid Bottle?
I would probably freeze the Texas Yum Yum solid as a i don't like the texture of any kind of pudding (SORRY IAN it feels like mayo in my mouth :/). I actually want to try the stuff in this video; it all looks very tasty! Specially the Bark stuff. That has a lot of potential for customization (remove the peanuts and oreos and add caramel popcorn UGH YES).
ian !! i am also a dallas gal who moved to washington but recently moved back! maybe i'll see you and plops around sometime
You were up here in Washington and didn’t even make me a treat? Not cool man
10:13 No. No you did not. Lol Probably wasn’t a big deal for this particular recipe, though. It’s super important if you make something with egg whites, though.
This opening is amazing and your house also looks amazing!
how much texas yum yum you want uh 3? so texas yum yum yum yum yum yum
Glad to see you’re all moved in!
Man, I'd never heard of Texas Yum Yum before, but now I need to eat it!
Did you actually move to Texas? A lot of the newer houses look like that and you passed a lot of places meet where I live, ps I’m also Texan. FortWorth, Dallas, and I’m thinking maybe Denton? Idk, I’m just but a humble and simple Texan child with a beard and fingers as soft as babies but cheeks...
3:55 the look of pure disgust
My gran used to make Texas Yum Yum every christmas, it's AWESOME. It was just called puddin' pie, though. Oh, small town Texas...
I live in Texas and it’s just like Red Dead Redemption 2
Future tip: When using the mixer, use centrifugal force to get the goopy shit out (cream cheese, butter, etc.) by turning it to 10 and letting everything fall off in the bowl. (Also, I've been baking for years and can't fold shit to save my life)
Watching these videos is always a pleasure, Ian. Your editing is honestly the best. Period
man you really do love your whipped topping
I missed this yesterday and I felt bad. Need my fixin' of some BrutalFoods.
Are you salty that the 2nd recipe isn't salty enough?
As usual: dat editing tho
can you do another yugioh video?
0/10 folding
kitchen is only a little bigger than the last one
20:42 that was actually a pretty cool transition
im texan this is offensive
I give your folding a 0/10. You did it completely wrong.
ur supposed to scrape the sides every so often with an electric mixer :(
Never made pudding I just eat the snack packs
You're an idiot
Plops...the best thing I’ve seen all week! Also, if you want your pudding to thicken, try cornstarch!
"Brutalfoods - I'm just doing mah best." - Make that T-Shirt. Do it
For future reference: use the side of the hammer instead of the head. You’re less likely to break the bag. You could also use a rolling pin or a wooden mallet so you don’t break the bag
IAN you mus SIFT your CONFECTIONERS SUGAR before MEASURING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Glad to see I'm not the only one who's confused by kitchen appliances
As a fellow Texan, I approve.
Can you make a Halloween Special for BrutalFoods?
So...I think as a Houstonian I am required to say... Fuck Dallas.
Thats a damnnice kitchen, by tarnation.
You literally look like you're standing... That's the worst costume... The illusion is lost....
Have you ever cooked before.
Go to the candy aisle and look for toffee bars
i had some leftover french silk pie in the fridge so as u can imagine, ive eaten it all while watching this
I have an identical shirt
DOTCH GULCH
sub to brutalmoose for his game reviews years ago. stay for cooking show.
Ian: I don’t want to cut myself! Also Ian: cuts open the chocolate in the most unsafe way possible
Red Dead Redemption II looks so realistic
NOOOOOO I LOVED THE OLD BRUTAL FOODS KITCHEN r.i.p will never forget
That’s a bull not a horse. I don’t understand.
I want Ian to wear Plorps in a future episode as he taste tests a bunch of steaks.
Best cooking show on youtube
As someone coming from the country that invented cake. America. Why.
This was so entertaining.
I love the feeling when you see a random stock photo on a Brutalfoods and are just waiting to see what will happen to it.
I cant eat pudding anymore being lactose
Smolmonds©
Damn, new kicthen again? Where are you gettin' this money?
That molten chocolate... Looks so good and tasty Damn Ian, now i need this in my life
Ian's new legs are as soulless as Plop's eyes
0:09 UGH Wish that was me
With things like peanuts or other kinds of nuts it helps to put them in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to break them apart
WHAT THE HECK A BIG KITCHEN? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
That Yum Yum looks great. I might try it out myself but use strawberry instead of chocolate pudding cause i dont like chocolate pudding XD great video as always!!! Glad to know the move is done. Kitchen looks great
Bruh you need a flat kitchen hammer, and need to hammer up all of em ingredients yall
This should be on tv
pro tip Ian! if you don't know where to find certain toppings for deserts, you can go to an ice cream or yogurt shop and just buy the toppings off them! (ie: toffee bits)
Pajama sam thank you very much
This is DEFINITELY the right way to announce a move to your viewers.
god i love these
you need puddin just ask team four star
A horse is a steed. A bull is a steer.
notice me senpie
Could have Crushed the Pretzels, Oreos, and Wurthers all together and just mixed and applied to chocolate.
i heard microwaving chocolate is bad. it burns away the sweetness. i would have put that plastic bowl in a pot of boiling water.
Oh precious Ian, how sweet you are - how bad at "folding in ingredients" you are. This actually wasn't terrible, but to truly fold in an ingredient, you'll want to use a rubber spatula to very slowly and gently mix the ingredient in a bowl, scraping up from the bottom of the bowl as you go. Essentially, "folding" is a technique used specifically with light, airy ingredients that you don't want to knock the air out of. So basically it's just mixing as gently as possible, to keep the mixture light and airy! While using a stand mixer wasn't the best idea for this, putting it on the slowest setting was the best option for your chosen technique. <3
Red Dead Redemption 3 Reveal Trailer
Howdy. When folding in dry or liquid ingredients into the other, use a rubber spatula & make figure 8s (like a ballerina in a rodeo). The purpose is to incorporate air into the mix, which adds volume (like in yer mama's perm). Whisking will just beat the air out of it (like beatin' the devil out the sinners).
why did I laugh when you said snack packs
Plops is displeased with your offering!!
Can we make it a new rule that it isn’t a true Brutalfoods video without at least one “plop”?
Farewell, Original Brutal Kitchen. You shall be missed dearly by newcomers and veterans alike.
He should do an Instant Ramen brutalfoods, good video btw.
18:22 is that manly muscles?
IAN JUST GOOGLE HOW TO FOLD STUFF IN BC ITS NOT THE SAME AS MIXING AND YOURE LOSING ANY AIR THAT IT HAD
Mother kept yelling about you using a mixer instead of a hand mixer. Apparently the first accessory you put on it was actually the right one.
Those sound effects from Bop It were an ingenious addition. I don't know how you notice those sorts of opportunities!
That close up of Ian taking a gulp of mailk fucking killed me
"it's very hard" Whaaat, frozen chocolate is hard?!

Eating the two sugariest desserts ive seen in all my life, hes also drinking koolaid. Ian, are you diabetic?
Why is this a food channel now, i do not get it?
I sighed when he came in on the bull
So I thought I would just give you some tips and tricks for using a stand mixer. First of all you were using the right attachment to mix the cream cheese you just need to turn it on a lot higher. Usually around the 6th or 7th setting is where I put it and what you're attempting to do is just beat air into the cream cheese making it "lighter". And it's sticking to the side of the bowl is no problem you just scrape down the bowl. The attachment you put on is for folding in ingredients and mixing them ever so slightly. It's for stuff you don't want to build a lot of gluten in like a crepe. The other attachment is the dough hook and that's for kneading dough so you can bake bread. You're doing a really good job by the way as well. They are a difficult unit to understand sometimes and you seem to grasp the concept pretty quickly. Other than the fact of not plugging it in but I do that all the time so no judgment there.
Real cowboys don’t ride horses, they ride C O W S
I feel like I got called out when he said Ramsay(my last name)
You are SO bad at cooking hahaha.
That "cheesecake" has got to be the most unhealthy dessert I've ever seen lol. The amount of sugar that must be in that! Just looking at it is giving me diabetes.
You living in Texas honestly makes me enjoy living out here a lot more even though we will most likely never actually meet.
Did you enlarge your head? I dunno why but your face looks too big for your body...
And I quote, "I'm going to add more chocolate which can't be that bad just more chocolate" I added too much chocolate ??
You made a Werther's dust shaker... That's kinda amazing.
I just got a Toyota ad in spanish on this video, I have adblock on.
Can you play and find the game kid pix 3D on your channel plz
It appeared to me that youns and ole plop were swimmin' down the river walk in San Antonio if I'm not mistaken. Welcome home cowboy!
Ian! Couple tips for your mixer * the highest setting is for beating stuff - it also helps when something thick like cream cheese is stuck on the inside of the whisk * ALWAYS lock the top down, the last think you want is it opening up
Don't worry Ian. in a few months you'll be Ain'tin and Y'allin like you never left.
He started and stopped cooking all of that at 2:51 in the [MORNING/AFTERNOON]. That's why they likely call him Quickdraw Ian.

Take 5 is the greatest candy bar of all times
The sound effects are great??
Don’t Fuck With Texas
When using a stand mixer, you need to scrape down the bowl with a spatula to properly mix everything.
Dang it, Youtube! Why do you always give me alerts when Youtubers I'm not subscribed to upload, if you're not even alerting me when great Youtubers like Brutalmoose upload!
I like this video so far but I think you need to reposition the camera a bit. We can't see much on the main camera.
Wait I have real pretzels....Best quote ever
The first recipe is just "sex in a pan" under a different name
Don't think I didn't catch the Myst joke you sly moose ;)
this vid wuz very funny u never disappoint me and I'm excited 4 the next vid
Ian. Listen to me. Buy a coffee grinder. Nuts, oreos, pretzels and chocolate chips. Anything small can be processed in the grinder. You will now thank me for this life-changing pro tip.
I would watch this on Food Network.
I was wondering why you weren't using the Kitchen-aid stand mixer you had on the back counter. It was amusing watching you try and use it. It's something I use on almost a daily basis so to see someone struggle with it is entertaining.
Being someone who's actually from Tx, this is painful.
Everything is perfection as always, Ian. Really enjoyed all of the editing bits, and of course your humor, as always. :) You're seriously one of the best people on this site-I can't get enough of your videos! Hopefully the move went okay and that you're enjoying Texas again. :) Best wishes! Thanks for all the hard work, as always.
I see we have gone full circle with the long hair -> short hair -> long hair thing
Let Little Ian host the show
19:23
October's rolled around, you know what that means... It's Texas Mocking time.
Next time you try to knife a legume, consider a meat tenderizer or a generic kitchen mallet.
You should leave both cream cheese and whipped cream out for a bit to soften before using it next time.
Fuck this I want to watch a man cook microwave dinners in the tiniest space possible dammit! I can't relate to this at all! Love you Ian <3
Has anyone told him that's not a horse?
So weird seeing stock footage of my city on a YT video!
I love watching Ian develop as a cook
You left Seattle?! Sad. I remember when I ran into you at the Fry's in Renton. Good times.
Not even 10 seconds into the video and I'm already laughing. Was not expecting this outfit, my mistake.

CHOCOLATE RAIN
Welcome back to Texas
Ian has the funniest editting in all youtube! Love your work, man!
Fantastic video Ian! Your editing is both totally original and utterly entertaining.
Waiting for the day Ian gets on the tending list
Hell yes I've been waiting for this
0:03 Me walking into school after playing red dead redemption all weekend.
Thank you for your content as always, Ian!
Word of advice: read the entire recipe through before beginning with the first step, so you don't get surprised part way through. It may even help to rewrite the recipe, to divide up those multi-steps. Also, for chopped nuts, or for crushed grahams or cookies, put the measured amount into a heavy duty plastic bag. Use a meat tenderizer hammer to gently pound them into pieces.
Why was step two beat your wife? Thats weird what website did you get your recipe from?
Rides a bull, adds a horse noise for it... I don't know if it was intentionnal, but it was funny.
Ian do you edit your videos yourself? if so you do a great job on it
U forgot to put the pudding in the microwave and add the colour changing sparkles
One of the only brutal foods I would actually eat lol. Just so you know that "electric mixer" you used is actually generally called a "stand mixer" in recipes and an electric mixer is a hand-held device with two whisks sticking out of a motor to make them spin. I think they work the same though chefs might be mad about that, the only difference is you have to scrape down the sides of a stand mixer so that confectioner sugar would have mixed in better.

This guy reminds me of sheldon from big bang no idea why
I'm sick of the 15 second ads everywhere man
Thank God someone else recognizes the greatness of Take 5
Ian you did have pudding remember... ....the kid cuisine warm pudding
no real texan would use gluten free pretzels!!!! save those fer the liberals!!!!!
Those fucking Bob-It sound effects! Too funny Man too funny.
I love brutalfoods but I hate Texas. Goddamn cowbos always trying to eat my beans.
Still not folding right lol
God, oreos on top of chocolate, pretzels, crushed toffees and nuts? Whoever came up with that recipe didn't know when to stop. And I would have been pretty sparing with the salt anyway.
I love the way you edit man
No see the pudding tastes amazing because the last pudding you had was that warm Kid Cuisine magic shit.
you just recently oved into the condo in Seattle and now Tx .??????
Given I help my mother bake, I found myself going "Scrape the sides! what are you doing!?!" a lot during this video. And I literally said "No, no NO!!! that's not what folding is!". Overall very entertaining video.
why'd ya move home?
Cool cool
With her very first paycheck, my mother went to the store and bought an entire tub of 'whipped topping' and ate it in her car. She can no longer eat, or even smell, 'whipped topping.'
Moosey where do u shop. Try walmart next time.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
Did Ian unhook his clock just so we wouldn't be able to tell how long it took to make these? It's 2:10 the entire time. Haha.
Definitely do an episode on all sorts of gluten-free foods. That would be kind of amazing.
I never thought I'd see Werther's Orignals on this channel. Hmm, not had any for ages. Maybe I should pick some up...
Typically when 'folding' something into mixture one of the techniques use is to take a spatula and make 90 degree turns with it in the bowl. Its done like this os stuff that has air in it like whipped creams or toppings dont lose the air in them during the mixing process. So think almost wrapping the two mixes around each other until they are one rather then just stirring them together.
p l o p
I can’t see I’ve seen folding done in an electric mixer, usually it’s literally entry folding with a silicone spatula. Also, room temperature is super important for incorporating things, especially for ingredients that are supposed to be lighten and airy like whipped cream. Your doing great though! I love watching the process
Is it just me or does Ian move a lot?
As an ex-Wallyworld dairy/frozen stocker, all of this Great Value stuff made me scream in shear horror. Truly an October fright.
Well, shit, welcome back to texas. Winter's here, so that's a thing. Have fun!
Yet another kitchen? You move a lot man, but them all upgrades tho.
If you ever need toffee bits again, you can break up a Heath bar and use that. My grandma has a awesome recipe for Toffee Bit Triangles that uses Heath bars.
That's one way of starting a video.
Plop
The editing in these videos never ceases to make me laugh.
Your editing is so good dude, and in an unsaturated environment like this it makes the content super intriguing.
23:47 30 men in the freezer :o Oh no
This is your magnum opus.
Welcome home dude.
You're using a Kitchen Aid for that? That's overkill lol
We don’t deserve Ian
All Ian has in the freezer is Otter Pops.
20:42 my favorite part!
21:43 Gluten free Brutal Food video confirmed?
Man Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great! You convinced me to buy it
also, as someone who has hammered down dog food for our hissing cockroaches at work, here are a couple of tips: - put the ziploc bag in another ziploc bag - make sure to get as much air out as possible the plastic bag will still rip and tear, but getting the air out first will make it rip less, and having the other bag will make it less of a mess. :-)
When mixing with an electric mixer, you have to use a spatula to push in the batter stuck to the sides of the bowel.
I love the audio editing, just makes every second enjoyable
0:37 i’m pretty sure that’s downtown where i live lmao
I can finally understand what in the tarnation this feller is sayin now that he's speakin proper-like. Welcome back ta Texas!
ahhh the kitchen is sooo big now he has even more room to cook??
Hits like before even watching the whole thing
glad you're back Ian
When you mix in a mixer you are supposed to scrape the sides off every now and again, it helps everything mix :)
Heck yessss! I’ve been obsessed over the older Brutal Foods vids recently, and I’m STOKED to have some new Ian brain candy. Nicely done.
what about the peanut on a food prosesor?
You are my favorite food reviewer.
How Ian makes it seem like too many cooks with one person is beyond me...
plop
I would love to see you review gluten free things. Also I do think the salt would have helped a lot with the bark, it helps to take away from the bitterness of the dark chocolate. Lastly, if ever you make bark again, try tapping the pan after putting the chocolate in while it's still hot, this will even out the ratio of the chocolate and kind of smooth it out.
For future reference, Heath candy bars are 99% toffee.
Chocolate raaaaain
This moment when you see all brutalfoods and that not even twice xD
We want to see more brutalfood :3 please :D
Fingerlickin' good.
This video was pretty yum yum
I need to try that Texas yum yum recipe! In the UK we don't have the Jello puddings so I may have to try it with Angel Delight which is a sort of pudding mix XD
With electric mixers like that, you're supposed to scrape the sides while it's working. And folding is something you do manually. You take your silicon spatula and slowly flip the product into itself, gently. It is quite literally folding.
Ian's steed looks suspiciously like a bull.... What type of bull are you pulling pretending plops is a horse?
This is the best western of our generation.
Please play West of Loathing, Ian! It’s so good, and so western!
Your parents have a very nice kitchen.
0:40 Katamari DamacIAN!
Next time you need stuff like toffee bits, try the baking aisle instead of the candy aisle :)
I'm pretty positive you're supposed to use a rolling pin, not a hammer
Brutalfoods is one of, if not, my favorite YouTube shows, keep it up Ian
you know kinda miss the the old game reviews but this is worth the trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP4vbktd-PM The furst 38 seconds explains and shows what folding something in is
I watch brutalmoose for the plot
Hey Ian, is Televoid coming back?
THIS INTRO IS RACIST!
you should probably invest in a portable electric mixer
omg. gordon ramsey is spinning in his grave.
Ian is certainly doing a great job of integrating back into that weird Texan culture ;)
Best ending ever.
Any day Ian uploads is a good day
So happy you're back! ^-^
Someone send this to Gordon Ramsey so he can learn some tips
You should get the Fallout: Vault Dweller Official Cookbook and make some things in there. Nuka Cola is a must since it's a staple in the game series
I'm so happy you finally get to eat nice yummy cold pudding and not the gross warmed up crap from the TV dinners!
A good way to fold something in is to take a rubber spatula and make a figure 8 with your mix. The idea is to keep it fluffy and full of air.
Dude your humor is great always makes me laugh keep that stuff up
Toffee bits= hard caramel What the fuck, HEATH bars mang.
the best treats for the best state
As a Texan I can confirm that them suckers look tasty.
I really shouldn't be watching Ian's videos when I'm doing something that'll get ruined if I laugh.
when you're taking out the mixer hand at 10:42 and you say "push it" and "twist it"..... are those the fucking sound effects from a Bop-it
ian, if you want to chop something like peanuts without risking your fingers, you can place your free hand over the far end of the blade where nothing is hanging near the edge, and then just rock it from that point back and forth over what you're chopping? it's hard to explain but basically your passive hand holds the far end of the knife down while your dominant hand rocks the blade up and down, and turns it left and right slightly to chop along what you're working on :D
You love the salt, eh? Sounds like someone ought to play them some fightan grames. :3
the fun thing about you being in texas is that could mean i live 20 minute away from you or 5 hours and that's beautiful. also i wanna make you pollo a la plancha sometime my dude! cook for a rad guy.
he used the wrong mixer head! it' s for dough!!
This is my favourite gaming channel
I just wanna thank you for the editing I know it can't be easy but it always brings me joy seeing your silly edits on your videos and I don't know if you really get how much we appreciate it and how much we appreciate you Ian, we love you and hope you have a fang-tastic Halloween ????????
PS: The bit where you were unwrapping the Werther's at maximum speed while maintaining your narration bit at normal, just cemented you as the best video editor who ever lived.
Me: Why do people scream at the tv at sports games? They can't hear you... Also me: OMG DON'T USE THE WHISK ATTACHMENT! NOOO! YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE DOWN THE SIDES AS YOU GO!!
So happy your move went well. When it comes to folding, i always take a little bit and use a wooden spoon to mix in the ingredients. So happy you are back. Cant wait for some more Brutalfoods.
As a Texas, I approve of this video.
Who would've thought sweet Ian was a cowboy all along.
With every episode I’m more and more convinced that Ian doesn’t live in our reality. Every store he goes to has no normal ingredients, he’s unfamiliar with some really basic foods and cooking techniques, he has nothing in his fridge but freezies.
Ian pls scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula when using any mixer. Certified chef (me) says ur folding technique was not really "folding" but for whipped topping it was ok. Folding means to gently mix with a rubber spatula, usually scraping from under then "folding" over the top. For this, your method worked fine, but for something more delicate than whipped topping (like real whipped cream for example) actual folding should be used.
Best editing in the west.
The Jebediah Ramsay cooking show
i dont like chocolate pudding. i dont like chocolate milk or hot chocolate either.
Ten seconds into the video and I was like "wow. The new Red Dead Redemption looks great"
If you’re melting chocolate use the double boiler method, put a pot with water on the stove then clip on a second thing, kinda like a deep frier but with water and put the chocolate in the smaller bowl inside the big bowl
love that plop sound
RIP old Brutalfoods kitchen [*]
B-oooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwl
My husband and I always watch your videos together and I think we wants me to make both of these things now haha.
Gluten free pretzels are exactly the same, the only difference is that they don't get all grossly gummy as you chew them :p
why did i wheeze when you gave plops the texas yum yum
Dude, I've had a phenomenally shitty day and this really helped cheer me up- thanks
the editing is just - :-*
"Are gluten free pretzels different?" How has this man made it more than 20 years on this earth.
This channel made the terrifyingly seamless transition into a food channel and I both love and am intimidated by the fact
Ian you've never had pudding pie before? That's all my family made during holidays
You are the only other person I've ever heard use the word "Larapin" aside from my Step-Mom.
I’m sure some other people have mentioned this, but to keep parchment paper on your tray, put butter on the try to help keep the paper stuck to the tray! Best of luck, Ian!
What an enjoyable fever dream this is
The bark probably needed to be spread thinner so it wasn't quite as chocolate heavy.
17:24 Improvising with those Wethers really shows how you've made GIANT STEPS in your cooking ability.
Should've used Heath bars for a toffee substitute. Since it's just toffee with chocolate on it.
How long we growing this hair Ian?
I can't even hate the intro
Your new kitchen is really beautiful.
The legend himself is back
so are we not gonna talk about the 30 men in my freezer part?
1:50, it will always be 1:50...
Yeah, the gluten free stuff is just terrible, also anyone saying it's 'unhealthy' the only reason they sell it is because of Gluten Allergies. It's like going peanut free because its harmful to some people, that's the logic behind that food fad basically. Just be careful, these item usually cost more for little reason.
MORE PLEASE
That's... definitely not what folding looks like.
I loved this video it was great..Hope to see a thanksgiving and or christmas themed cooking video
Mmmmm, them's suckers tasty
Oh man, that bark would've been so much better with tempered chocolate!
Weeerters
yee (and i can not stress this enough) haw
Texas foods. But no HEB groceries! I've been let down .
'I'm just doing my best' Well your best wasn't good enough, dude. You fail at cooking.
can someone please tell me the song title???
Neat thanks for the Type 2.
Why don't you just Google what you don't know how to do? I mean to be fair it would be a more boring video that way but ya know
[0/11] " NO BLUE BELL !!"
Your kitchens continue to increase in size
I enjoy american desserts which are just other desserts and snacks stacked on top of each other.
Who needs Red Dead Redemption when you have this?
I love your editing!
Chef Ian, can you try to make a raindrop cake? You’ll probably fail, but it’s really fun to watch people attempt it. And I believe in your ability to produce a good failure of a raindrop cake.
I love all the editing in this series. It makes the video much funnier without relying too heavily on what's "in", as the kids are saying these days.
I'm very sad that you left us in washington but your 10/10 content makes up for it
Sorry Ian, I won't tell you how you folded or how you did. I leave all my baking knowledge outside when I watch a Brutalfoods. That way, it's just goofy, silly Moose being endearing. Instead of me being a pedantic arsehole complaining about baking etiquette in a comedy video.
Honestly I prefer the tiny poverty kitchens. It's more relatable to me, Ian, you bourgeoisie scum.
I love u ian??? nice place too!
so, folding is done by hand by using a rubber spatula and gently "folding" whatever ingredient into the others to avoid mixing and stirring, I'd suggest watching a video on it, and with the stand mixer, use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides to avoid that issue with your sugar.
Do you think someday, Ian will have received enough youtube comments and help to be a human level cook?
Is the cowboy music from roller coaster tycoon 3? It sounds so familiar
The only yum yums I know are twisted donoughts.
I had deja Vu at 14:52 I just remember seeing Ian in a cowboy costume and talking about toffee bits. It really freaked me out.
thanks Ian. your paddle attachment is weird get a new one if it didnt come with one, it should look like yours but with a more in the middle . my teen and hubby love you as a mom i find your cooking insane. ThankQ
that costume is incredible
Ian shares my love for Take5 ??
You should've done a thinner layer of chocolate for the bark thing and the Texas yum yum looks really good
God damn that kitchen is hella nice
did you grocery shop at a staples????
Can you try making what’s called a Jello Cake? It’s super good and moist and I want to prove to my friends it’s a real thing lol
Your kitchen is gorgeous! I cannot wait to see more videos filmed in here, looks like you have a lot of room for shenanigans. And more Plops.
When smashing things in a bag a rolling pin is better.
Thank you for sprinkles
3 seconds in I'm in love
I live in Texas and I’m not even joking when I say this, when I saw the kitchen and the placement of everything I thought it was my kitchen. I was like “what the fuck..?”
As a general rule of thumb : use all room temp ingredients it’s easier 4 them to incorporate n work with :) if your cream cheese and whipped topping was room temp it’d make beating a breeze!
I don't know about you, but that was definitely some food
I’d love for BrutalMoose to mix his video game and food content and play games like my childhood favorite Disney Kitchen (I don’t remember if that’s the name for sure) or other food related games.
For the Yum Yum, I'd try an Oreo crust and way less chocolate, that might also be a good time. As for the Bark, I'd actually melt Hershey bars as opposed to milk chocolate chips and then go from there. Great video!
Hot damn! You moved back to Texas? Guess Texas couldn't leave you at all. Either way, welcome back to Texas!
This jerk ass rode this poor tiny horse the whole video. Without giving him a break! Unsubcribble
Wow i just made a chocolate pudding pie last nite and have never made one before! Great vid!
It just dawned on me that there are people out there who've never backed or used backing equipment
Lmao the chocolate sprinkles look like ants on the pudding pie wowie
Boy howdy didnt sid from Hey Arnold! Say that? I checked...yeah he did.
This is like Ian's 3rd kitchen on this show? Very mobile master chef.
I am consistently in awe of the fact that Ian owns a stand mixer
For cowboy bark you should have used heath bar
Wrap the bag in a towel before you do the smashy smashy my friend. It will help with the bag tearing problem.
I missed your cooking videos!! Got back from work and i saw this bad boy and clicked faster than you can say chorped. My fiance got an aneurysm from watching you cook lmao 10/10 would make recipe!!! Thanks Ian keep it up!!
Instead of a hammer you can use a heavy rolling pin and a chopping board to break things up in a bag like that
<3
Who needs read dead redemption 2 when Ian, the texan is here to solve our western Bordem!
Toffee bits are usually found in the baking aisle or in a bulk food store
I was about to talk shit about you but then you said you were from Texas just like me so yee haw
How hard did you have to struggle to not say that the Texas Yum Yum was yum yum for your tum tum?
As you move into your expensive new apartment, I hope you don’t suddenly become unfunny like Ethan and Hila.
That Texas Yum Yum looked really good. I may have to make it.
Ian wtf ??
I think its funny that most youtubers seem to get more polished and clean-looking as they get bigger, but Ian has become more scruffy as he got more successful. Love ya Ian, glad to be a long-time subscriber. Me me, I'm a Brutalmoose boy
I love how this video game channel just turned into a cooking channel
I was sold on this video in the first 5 seconds.
Folding in is literally using a spatula to 'fold' in the ingredient... So bring a fold up from the side of the bowl and into the middle. Basically, do it very gently and without adding a lot of air into the batter.
Also, only use the whisk (metal head) when it says whisk, haga
Here's a tip, Ian... In recipes, works like 'mix' 'beat' 'combine' etc. all have actual speeds on a mixer... If you look up the user guide for that mixer, it'll include what speed each word means!
Welcome back to Texas, Ian!
Ian, I was stressed through this video. But I about lost it when you cut into the yum yum and used the scooper backwards.
Your next video should have something to do with Steak now XD or Hamburg.
As someone who has to eat gluten free food I loved your response to the gluten free pretzels.. You should do a gf episode :) it's all gross
Cooking tip: when using most stand mixers things will get stuck on the side/ on the attachments. Stopping the mixer and using a silicone spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl into the middle will help get it all mixed.
yeeha
Who edits these videos they are amazing
Wow, the new Red Dead Redemption spin-off franchise is looking great!
this isnt ian's new house, he just broke in, hence his unfamiliarity with the mixers and then his loss to the location of the salt
WAYYYY too long since your last video. Nice looking place though. Get your shit together moose and upload more videos!
Your editing always makes me laugh! You are honestly so talented. Thanks for making stuff that we can enjoy too!
is your clock in the back ground working??????
I had to watch this on 2x speed cause I was short on time and it’s the ideal way to watch this tbh
I'm hyper for the cooking plops episode!
Always sift confectioners sugar so you don't get clumps
Ian has reached god tier editing levels
on the one hand, I found myself talking at you through the screen (which of course I know it's pointless, it's a Monday) but on the other hand, I enjoy watching you learn with us. Keep up the good work and always be learning Ian!
now I'm no recipe expert, but the pictures you showed of the texas yum yum from the recipe don't look like they have any vanilla pudding on them, which might explain why you had way too much for the crust. like, looking at their picture, all I see is the chocolate pudding layer, the cream cheese/whipped cream layer, and the whipped cream layer. am I crazy? did they add the vanilla pudding layer to the recipe but not actually make that one for the picture?
Wow never been so proud to be a Texan
Please review games again.
Oh boy! I love this :D More Texas foods!!! ^_^
Great video as always
In case the brutal murderer in the Food Lab isn't a look you want to maintain for future food crushing bits... You might want to place the baggie on a cutting board to protect the nice Brutal Kitchen from the remains of your enemies!
When is Televoid coming back?
Where's televoid you left us on a cliffhanger
Does anyone know why he moved?
Yo y’all is the best word ever Like being from Texas I say y’all every chance I get
No offense to Ian, but does no one in my generation know how to use kitchen tools?
the real reason i subscribed to brutalmoose
Are you sure thats pudding?
every time ian cooks in a video i get so nervous about his knife skills and general cooking technique I want to physically reach through the screen and help
Shoulda had a plop for the cream cheese drop
Oh come on, how hard is it to mash Graham crackers and melt butter for the crust?
Folding is important in making airy, fluffy desserts because you're mixing ingredients without beating out the air you put it by whipping/wisking it.
If I didn't find stereotypes hilarious, I might have been insulted by this XD P.S. welcome back to Texas!! Yeehaw!!
I love your editing style
when Ian came out in this costume I thought it was gonna be a review of Red Dead Redemption 2
Ian moved back in with his parents didn't he
MMM THEM SUCKERS TASTY
"No baking required" is usually a pretty good indicator of some terrible Southern grocery store dessert casserole.
My culture is not your fucking costume
You did not 'fold in' correctly.
The saga of the never-knowing-what-to-do-with-my-hands-while-talking continues
not sure if I'm imagining it or not, but I think I hear a little bit of an accent slipping back into his voice
Mmmm! Them sucker's tasty!
I should be writing an essay for college but instead i'm watchin this. Good job me
Great video. Sound design was on point as usual!
Thanks for the birthday upload Ian :)
Love your new home and kitchen! I really enjoyed the episode!
Mr. Moose please don't keep your whipped topping in the freezer, it belongs in the fridge
I'm from Texas love your video
You can never have too many sprinkles
Your editing so freaking amazing and very entertaining on its own.
Fuck you. I want pretzels and can't eat bread. How dare you point out the fact that I'll never be able to eat real food again.
BOY you really showed up out here with the guittard chocolate and kitchen aid stand mixer, that patreon must be going well for you huh
What is your po box so I can send you some damn kitchen supplies stupid wooden spoon havin ass.
Wade Winston Wilson AKA Deadpool Merc with the Mouth: Mmmm dang howdy ya'll Cowboy Ian along with Plops the Bull knows how to cook the best rooting tooting food in the whole Wild West Texas faster than a rodeo of Rattlesnakes partners. YEE-HAW RIDE EM YOUTUBE VIEWERS AWAY YIPPEE-KI-YAY MOTHER (CENSORED)!!! Oh and don't forget to like this comment and give Mr Ian the brutalmoose the love he deserves. Jesus those chocolate pretzels are making me thirsty!
Your clock is broken
Welcome back to Texas Ian! We missed you
While watching this, I imagined myself as an old Texan, and I think, if an actual old Texan watched this, he'd be pretty OK with it. Ian has no idea what he's doing in a kitchen, old men have no idea whatt they're doing in a kitchen, it'd all work out.!
How hard was it to film in that costume?
Wow i love these food videos
You don’t have to be lonely at farmersonly.com............... I’m a city boi -_-
I love these video so much
please PLEASE if you end up streaming the new red dead you have to do so dressed in this cowboy outfit it's very important
damn...plops is a big boi
The chewy soft werthers would've worked better then the hard candy ones
God dammit, you moved from Washington before I ever got to meet you. Oh well.
after watching so many cooking tutorials by perfect pinteresting pros its very refreshing to see such realistic uncertainty and mess like this is what would actually happen if i tried to cook
I like the Red Dead Redemption 2 theme. Love knowing everything is planned that far out
bowl
those are some mighty fine sustenances partner
I absolutely 1000% love this but I can't explain why
You know, you could have just bought the regular sized pretzels and broke them into smaller bits instead of buying the GLUTEN FREE SHITTY MINI PRETZELS.
MMMMMMM!!!!!! Them sucker's TASTY!
BEING TELEVIODS BACK!? Please...
Texas is best state, just sayin.
Where do you find the music? It's always so relaxing and catchy, it completes these (already fantastic) videos!
Oh god I was so concerned you were going to try and take the graham cracker crust out of the tin XD
I would say that now i could maybe see you in public but you probably never leave your house.
Oh my GOD WHEN YOU FED PLOPS THE YUM YUM IM YELLING
Brutalfoods always leaves me wanting to cook too.
Thank you for the effort you put into editing these!! When you were putting on that last layer of whipped topping on the yum yum I started literally laughing out loud ??????
I think yum yum is southern in general! My family is from Mississippi and we make it for every holiday gathering. For toppings instead of sprinkles we use cherries, nuts, and shreds of chocolate
Is this a cooking or gaming channel?
I like the new crib but i kinda miss the old one tbh
Will we be seeing you at Pax South?
Is there ever a point in time where we as a collective community should ask if Ian is ok?
Graphic design is my passion
In future, keep in mind that if you're Ok with the extra chocolate which is added to your recipe, you can use a chopped Heath bar to replace toffee bits in place of Caramels, as the filling in a Heath bar is toffee. But if you like Caramels instead, more power to you:)
Your texan is on point!! ... Almost as if you were from ... Texas ...
>takes off correct mixer attachment >adds whisk >returns correct attachment
House tour plz
These are some next level sound effects.
I really wanna try that Texas yum yum but I would have to get substitutes for so much of that stuff I'm not sure it'd be worth it
What in tarnation?! You live in Dallas!? Well spank my monkey sir.
I didn't know Red Dead Redemption 2 was this realistic.
I love your new kitchen.
This didn't show up in my subbox, god dammit youtube. That feel when Ian uses the whisk again lol
Where have you been daddy
Heath bars are toffee and they sell them in bits most of the time!
I just love every episode you ever make. Keep up the great work, man!! "Well, I'm a Texas Yum Yum boy! ..In a Texas Yum Yum world."
Me when i play RDR2
Plops looks like he wants to die
Who else realized he didn't break up the Oreos and was just waiting for him to realize it himself
You can only "fold in" by hand
I never heard of "Texas Yum Yum", but then I realized that's it's better known as a slush cake. And didn't you just move into a new place last year? And you already moved again?
i 2 hav ther t mend en meye freser
3:14 yeah wild like the wild wild west yee-haw y'all better like texas yum yum or you aint a real texan lile what in tarnation
Just wanted to leave a quick tip about your work of the kitchen aid mixer; while mixing you will want to turn off power to it and scrape the sides of the bowl periodically.
DALLAS? MORE LIKE GAYASS - This ad was paid for by the city of Houston
26:23 I love that moment of pure happiness
Delightful music choices
You were in Washington this whole time!? I'm from Washington too
please com to brasil !!!!! ????????
Ian is kinda bad at power tool saftey...
Ian when you put the whisk on the mixer, i cried.
This video makes me want to die and become immortal all at the same time. It’s like the time I walked into a bathroom at an airport in San Francisco and locked eyes with a woman through the mirror. She was doing her makeup as water fell from the ceiling all over the bathroom. It was the strangest experience of my life before I watched this video.
Welcome to Brutalfoods: where the measurements are made up and the instructions don't matter.
This is good.
god it truly is a good day when Ian uploads another brutal foods video <3 That editing always kills me! ??
Mmm, them suckers tasty! YEEHAWW
yeah i would love to try the YumYum as for the britle, yeah you need a thinner chocolate base, also maybe crush all the ingredients in the same bag
I knew from the beginning when Ian came in with a fake horse I was in for a good time
I hope my ex doesn’t know Ian exists... she would kidnap him and keep him as a pet.
Sometimes Ian will do something and i just wanna scream
Always a great day when i see an upload from this guy!
Brutalfoods vs Binging with Babish! I would love to see that video!
This vid made me hungry
Man, RDR2 looks crazy realistic.
I'm a yum yum Boy in a yum yum world
the glutino chocolate covered pretzels are amazing eat them
Folding.............. Kinda?
Well I know for a fact that H-E-B has all organic toffee bits for all your baking needs! help they have a gun to my head
Holy fuck.... I thought I was watching another 'after prison' show! Until...........dzzam zooo!
That pie is 100% fine. Because everything is bigger and better in Texas
Say what you want about Ian's kitchen skills, but you can't say he isn't trying his best!
0:09 he slapp the ass
Awesome video
a bit of advice, PREP PREP PREP! if you prepped better, you wouldnt have forgotten any of the steps. you want to have everything you want to use there, ready.
Should we tell him he's riding a bull, not a horse?
WTF @ 19:08
I can totally envision this on my minds tongue.
Thanks for having captions, Moose!
I don’t skip a single ad for a brutal moose video. The work he puts into his hilarious edits and amazing content deserves every penny ??????
I love watching this even though it hurts to watch the struggle of basic kitchen terms and what utensils to use.?? Don’t stop doing these I enjoy watching and seeing you actually getting better because you have definitely progressed! Thanks Ian for the entertainment!
Call Nicole‘s on the man man
I remember when you left Texas, after the "explores the airport" video. They grow up so fast ??
i was literally binging brutalfoods the other day omg
The fact my last name is Sprinkle, I feel personally attacked about embracing my inner sprinkle. lol
24:41 ????????
the red dead redemption 2 culinary dlc looks good
0:08 “Red dead redemption II (2018)”
"Prefered body type: living or recently deceased..." um.. Ian, you okay?
Oh my God, Ian. You have no idea how happy seeing this video in my sub box after a looooong hard day at work has made me. ????
I've watched you for a long time off and on... but these videos made me sub and I wish you'd make an editing tutorial, cuz you're amazing!
I normally find gluten free pretzels to be crunchier and better iunno
I legit saw this when I woke up, said I would save this for when after I did all my project work, and here I am. Gotta save the best for last!
For toffee substitute, if you don’t want to make your own, buy some heath bars and cut back a little on the chocolate in your recipe.
i got an ad for diabetes on the side of this video lmao
am texan can confirm this is actually how we dress and act. cept my bulls name aint plops, i call him pissback. on an unrelated side note i also have a bladder control problem.
That is one snazzy new kitchen
The key to success with those mixers is regularly using a rubber spatula to make sure the ingredients get fully incorporated. Folding 5/10
17:35 is absolutely jarring holy shit.
I live in Texas and these are amazing! Nice for you to do a video for the Lone Star State!
Feel really bad for you texas is full of inbred morons..Texas, the Alabama of Texas..
Your hair is so fucking beautiful, it's distracting.
To crush or "chop up" any nut, use a small paper back, put the nuts inside and fold it up, grab a table spoon and whack the bag with the back of the spoon like you're using a fly swatter on a counter, depending on how hard and how long you hit will control how fine you crush it. (Worked in a chinese restaurant for 5 years as a kitchen hand) Good to see you at it again, I missed your videos, love your cheesy editing, can't wait for more :D
Maybe don't hammer a plastic bag of werthers into your dirty garage and then shake said bag over the food you'll be eating. ...otherwise, great video as always
That was amazing. 10/10. You sir, are a video editing legend. Glad you had a safe move!
Fffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk I could have met you in Seattle
omg they made giddy up from fortnite into a real thing hahaha omg lol ????????
Pudding pies are amazing! Super easy to make and tasty. The problem with bark of any kind, though, is that it's really just hard, melted chocolate covered in stuff. What I like to do is get different colored candy melts, melt those down and mix 'em on wax paper to make a colorful bark base, then just cover the whole thing with sprinkles. Doesn't change the fact that it's still just hard chocolate covered in stuff, but it does look cool. Get some red, green and white candy melts, toss in a few drops of peppermint extract, throw on top some dark chocolate mint pieces, makes for a fun Christmas bark.
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks weird...
This video is a yum yum.
What were you snorting, crack?!
Living in Texas sounds horrid.
"Ages: Channelwood Preferred" Ian you satisfy my need for Myst references and I love you for it.
Good
Texas is great
Can you review more frozen food
My mom's been making that Texas Yum Yum pie for years. Don't sleep on it. It's legit amazing. Only thing that makes it better is using an Oreo crust instead of graham crackers.
30 men are in my freezer too
Looks like Internet Gamer Jesus decided to bring us a taste of the Alamo today.
i'm looking for the gluten free snack reviews
I LOVE YOU!!! PLANT A BABY INSIDE ME!
yum yum
Alton Brown you are not, brutalmoose, Alton Brown you are not
Ian, where did you get the cool horse from? I want to be a family friendly Texan cowboy food reviewer like you
As a Texan, I approve this message
Funny and fun as always ??
So dumb it is hilarious!
Nooo he left seattleee
0:00 when you've been playing Red Dead Redemption II all day and forgot to plan a video to record.
That's such a big kitchen! You could wear so many costumes in there!
Ian SMASH
I feel like he gets a new kitchen every episode
after years of dealing with people in multiplayer games and on the internet, I've grown a taste for the salt myself.
I feel like this becomes more and more like an actual cooking show every episode
This didnt show up in my subscriptions but was in my recommended videos?! Youtube wth?
Why do Americans drink milk with dessert, so strange!
new red dead redemption lookin good.
OMFG I USED TO LIVE IN DALLAS
You just blessed my birthday and I’m from Texas WOW <3
I can't handle the fucking sound effects in this one. They got me fucked up
Brutal, folding something in, in this case would be putting whipped cream in the middle of that bowl and scooping the cream cheese onto it and flattening it. It's folding something you have onto the ingredient over and over and combining it that way. Just thought you would like to know.
Ian sure does move a lot. He should change the name of his channel to brutalMOVES.
I don"t kkow if anyones said it but, the hard candy would of worked if you had melted and thinned it a bit and used it like a soft caramel.
I like how he turned off the clock in the background so we can't tell when he makes cuts.
So if you want to get the stuff on the sides, you have to stop the mixer, take the bowl out and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and get it into the mix. I'm not sure "how to fold properly" but I thought it was taking a bit of and mixing it in by... not quite mixing, but like.... a single mix. Like folding laundry. If that makes sense. You could probably do the same thing to the nuts as you did with the caramels, but with a rolling pin instead of a hammer.
Toffee bits should be in the same place you’d find baking chocolate in a grocery store- in the baking aisle just FYI
the legend never dies
Honey honey give me the yum yum.
19:25 Holy cow that is an amazing chocolate rain reference, I nearly missed it it was so subtle!
OH god, I live in Houston and I have a kitchen that looks exactly like that XDDD it feels so weird
YES BRUTALMOOOOOOOSE UPLOAD
Brutalfoods = Ian learns to cook with advice from his viewers. love the new vid, Ian! <3
This hurt my soul watching this but also made me laugh! Ha ha ha! That folding technique could use some... work but the editing is primo! ??
I love these videos, they're funny but also chill and slow pace. Also, here's a little tip if you ever use the KitchenAid mixer again. Pretty much with any mixer, if you find the food is getting stuck inside the wisk, or whatever mixing part you're using, turn the speed up as far as you can and centrifugal force will throw it out.
23:47 30 men in my freezer And now back to "Cooking with Jeffrey Dahmer"
Ian need to stop shopping at shitty health food stores.
I'd be interested in seeing a "Cowboy Bark, take two" with you giving it another shot with some tweaks to it to suit your tastes. Also, my Kitchen-Aid mixer is that exact same model and color as yours. I really don't get enough use out of it, so perhaps I should try making that Texas Yum Yum since no-bake ice-box cakes/pies are so simple to make.
What I'm most curious about is how any of this is "Texan" or anything "cowboy." That pudding pie seems pretty generic, and I learned a version of that bark in a Christmas dessert. Not complaining, really, but methinks the smell of arbitrary marketable adjectives is hanging in the air
Love the cooking videos and the plop sould effect. Keep it up!
Welcome back to Texas, made it just in time for the fair!
That’s the best fucking intro ever. Riding that bull should be how every video starts.
Ian... as a fellow long haired dude, your hair is fucking beautiful. Also your editing is fan-goddamn-tastic. I guess I have a bit of a mancrush on you. Keep on rockin in the free world.
Ughh it never fits...
As a born and raised Texan, I feel pretty left out since I've never even heard of these. ?? Also welcome back to Texas, it still sucks here. ????
The new Red Dead Redemption is looking good! Im amazed by this indepth gameplay!
Thought Beto was going to be in this.
That Yum Yum looked Yum Yum and now I want pudding....
My culinary school-trained boyfriend is providing expert commentary to Ian’s cooking....I’m enjoying it too much to tell him to stop ??
I laughed in the first 45 seconds
them suckers tasty. yee haw.
Ian I love your cooking videos, theyre amazing. I had already thumbed your video at the start, but the moment you said "Take 5 candybar is the best candybar" I immediately went to thumb it up again, only to realize I already had.
oh yeah, it's that time of the evening, sit down after a good ol' game session with a snack and a brutalmoose video, this series is one of my favourites on youtube!
this guy tries too hard to be iDubbbz
I like Texas. Yummy food
I audibly gasped when I heard the instrumental for "Manly Muscles" come on outta nowhere
You gotta scrape the sides of the bowl yourself my dude.
we have the same microwave
wow read dead redemption 2 looks great
Is that the sound of the coconuts from Monty Python and the Holy Grail?
As a represnitve of the great state of Texas i deme the opening a accurate reprsentation of are State
I like how he took a tip about breaking up food in a bag and used it for the Werther's but didn't think to use it for the nuts. Also, why are there 30 men in your freezer?
Red dead redemption 2 looks good.
...why are your pretzels in a ziplock bag?
Brutalmoose is the only terrible cook I love watching lol
The Texas Yum Yum really reminds me of dirt pudding. It’s basically vanilla pudding with oreo pieces in it, with the rest of the ingredients of course. I’m sure the Texas Yum Yum is just as yummy as dirt pudding! :)
Also, health toffee bits should be with the chocolate chips.
The clock didn't move...
The editing reminds me of a segment from 90s-2000s PBS kids EDIT: Its like the editor on Sesame Street dropped acid one day and just let it work itself out
Where are the bugs.
I love that brand of chocolate you used for the second recipie! It's so good. :)
now that you're back in dallas you're obligated to review the western freddi fish game
Guys... I think I have the same refrigerator as Ian.
I always use a hmuuuh-by-bluuuh size baking sheet when I cook. Also, watching Ian struggle with an electric mixer was the highlight of my Sunday.
Honestly so surprised you didnt burn your chocolate.
That kitchen is bigger than my flat room :D Can't wait to move next month.
A Texan making fun of Texas? I’m down. Also folding in is basically slowly mixing sideways.
Brutalfoods TUNA NOODLE when?
I was just thinking, “hm where’s brutal moose at?” Here he is!
You fail once again on the folding
Oreo's are overrated
Ooh! Please do a video on gluten-free replacement products! I’m allergic to wheat, and kinda have to eat it, even if it tastes like cardboard. The graham crackers are good, tho.
Mmm them sucker's tasty!
cookin with feces
I'm sad you moved! (I'm from Washington too) but your new kitchen looks AMAZING and roomy and you look happy to be back in Texas so I'm happy for you! I enjoy your content, thanks for what you do! <3
What I really enjoy about Brutalfoods is that having Ian trying these recipes for the first time, and overall not being someone who's kitchen savvy, he gets really excited about doing it right. It's heartwarming tbh
ewww why do you keep your tangerines in the fridge?
Hey what's up guys welcome back to Binging with Brutalmoose.
youtube back at it again, not showing me your uploads for the past four months. Time for a binge!
I'm sorry I'm commenting during watching the video, but you could just use the broad side of the knife to crush the peanuts
texas yim yum
Ian! Your clock isn't working!
Nine seconds in and I'm already ten times happier than I was before. You a good dude my dude.
As a texan I can relate to a emotional degree to the intro
Folding it in literally means using a spatula and folding the ingredients.
And as Cowboy Ian and Plops rode off into the sunset, they realized that their friendship was the greatest yum yum in all of Texas.
Welcome back to Texas! Living around Houston atm
someone should tweet gordon ramsey this
ian you need to scrape down the sides of the bowl yourself omg. -a baker
Get yourself some silicone spatulas boi! You can use them to scrape stuff from the sides of bowls, and to poke stuff that gets caught up in whisks. It'll save you from a LOT of electric-mixer related headaches. And you can also use the big ones to fold! (folding btw is when you scoop up mix, then gently flip it over on top. It's super literal. Like folding a blanket in half... kinda)
'Folding in' performance 1/10. Google it next time lol.
I am from Texas
grabs cream cheese covered whisk like a savage lol!
Real talk, I was hoping the freezer door wouldn't be able to close with the tray in it
sometimes gluten free pretzels are good and theyre a lot crunchier
Welcome back to Texas pardner! Yeehaw!
the sound effects must have taken up 90% of video production.
Ps, to fold in, would be by hand, not using the electric mixer, but rather folding it in with a spatula or spoon, like a very light mix so to speak
That kitchen is HUGE!
The goddamn sprinkle graphics cgchfj
Hey there cowboy, I reckon you probably got a heaping helping of moose hair in your recipes... delicious.
That Texas Yum Yum looks like a variation on my mom's Chocolate Delight, only instead of sprinkles, she uses chocolate chips. Considering we lived in Texas for a while, it all makes sense. Another great entertaining video, Ian! If there's some kind of Televoid!-like lore, I wonder if that second Ian with the hammer will come into play later ??
10:40 loved that subtle reference!
ian... use a rubber spatula.......
I cant stop staring at your kitchen. I swear, did you move down the street from me?
No matter where you live Ian, you will always be one of my favorite YouTube creators. Thank you for making such great content.
Nuts + ziploc + hammer = win
Well they do say things in Texas are bigger wink wink and you certainly did have some big delicious calories there ?? I can't say I like the bark, because I've had different types of chocolate bark, not a fan. But, I do love me some puddin, my favorite dessert at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Or really anytime. Lol plops wasn't feeling any of it though. Hah hah
i challenge you to cook without a microwave
From my 10 year-old cousin to my 85 year-old grandma, 25 year-old neckbeard and 60 year-old paterfamilias alike, and everyone in between -- my whole family loves your videos, Ian!
This is the 3rd brutalfoods kitchen
This is a great show. Because not only are you learning to cook by watching it, the one doing the teaching is learning along side you.
Does anyone else wanna see Ian do a cooking colab with Alton Brown? I do.
18:22 "brutalfoods meth lab"
Man Martha Stewart got nothing on ian
Red Dead Redemption 2 takes a weird turn at the end
That is %100 a Texas kitchen
Ian cooks so fast time stops. (*watch the clock on the wall)
Isn't there actually an MST3k episode where the girl unplugs the mixer to get a guy's attention? LOL She was all squishy and had "The Reds", as I recall. :D
how to properly use a kitchenaid ; for the love of god please make sure ur mixer is locked when you're mixing or you WILL eventually end up with a mess also,.,. to get the sides get the mixer attachment with a rubber side scraper
Gordon Ramsey, step aside, we have a new king in the kitchen.
Those little blackouts for your commercial breaks are really clever
I prefer milk chocolate. Dark chocolate is strong and bitter.
I used to be a fan of Ian, but then he went on a totally uncalled for almond-bashing tirade and now I'm going to have to unsub. I always knew Ian was in the pocket of Big Cashew.
Thank you for your Sprinkles
I'm sad as hell and this is what is getting me through the pain
1:35 preferred body type
8 seconds in and I can tell this is going to be a good one!
also I'm a little sad that you moved back to texas, I never did get to run into you in the wild and awkwardly wonder whether or not I actually ran into brutalmoose
i would be fine if brutalmoose just became a food review channel.
What exactly is 'pudding' in this context? Surely pudding is any kind of desert?
the first time you galloped over to your fridge i about shit myself
Texas Treats! makes rando recipes found on internet though I'ma guess Texas Yum Yum is pretty indicative of the kinda desserts you'd make for parties in Texas.
Yeehaw thank you for the delicious and plentiful bounty pard'ner
You should make a Cordon Bleu at some point. I think you'd quite like it.
You live in texas and you didn't get your stuff from HEB? :/
I remember when moose actually made good content
I work at Spirit Halloween as assistant manager, here in Tx!.. I hope you used a coupon for the inflatable costume, if not go back with it and exchange it for a new one and get around $7 off with 20% off, Before the 31st. Make sure to go for our 50% off store wide sale. November 1st!
Please watch with captions
You putting that plastic bowl into the microwave in order to melt the chocolate made me shrivel up.
Damn, that is a nice kitchen.
i've been waiting for this for so long
You should have done real Texas toast lol
I await the day Ian makes a very difficult mousse recipe.
ok 1.) im so glad you have a larger workspace now!!! 2.) yeehaw baby...
Wish I could be real life cooking buddies with Ian
Ram ranch
20:43 WOAH DUDE
Watch ian fumble with a mixer for 10 minutes
Someone needs to make a fan theory video all about Ian’s various personalities.
I did the version of the Texas yum yum but the base was oreo's and it was so good!
NEW BRUTALMOOSE WHAAAAA I LOVE YOU IAN IM GAY FOR YOU IAN LOL TOUCH ME inside
Return of the plop
why does ian have so many ice pops in his freezer?!!
Ian once again proves he is the king of editing
Mmm! Them suckers tasty! 00:29
You should do a Halloween treats episode if you can (I understand this kind of stuff takes a lot of time.)
Damn Ian get that youtube money look at that kitchen ????
I absolutely love you Ian, so goddamn much. But holy crap the cringe on your cooking skills has got me conflicted ?? like, let me come help you big daddi, I can't take it.
Are you high Brutal Moose
Darn it, Ian, I LEFT Dallas to go to Washington!! I still love you, though.
the subtitles makes it a more complete experience
Could just make toffee.
Do savory foods next but something unusual like rattlesnake or something classic like chili
I'm a little bit scared of hammer Ian.
just looking at the chocolate cake thing gave me type 2 diabetes
Why didn’t I get notified of this ?!? ?? what if I missed iit
Why you didn't said chorped instead of chopped?
Your videos have such a good feel and homely vibe. Feels like I’m cooking with my mother in my childhood kitchen. 10/10 would feast
15:11 OwO
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great!
Somebody call peta his steed needs help
1:37 that's a good Age :)
The first Brutalfoods to actually be brutal. Sad about my almond friends, but cowboy Ian is teaching me all I need to know.
I’m guessing the traffic for Farmers Only is skyrocketing after this video.
Remember when he called it CHORPING instead of chopping?? ????????
Did you move again?
American pudding looks weird. What is it? Where i live pudding is like a cake
Plops sure is rude not to eat your Texas Yum Yum.
you should try making some of the state fair recipes
1 out of 10 on folding, you do it manually using a spatula
Did I just hear larapin on a brutalmoose video? holyshit...dying languanges on my youtube? it's more likely than you think!
I'd eat the fuck out of it.
He lives only 3 or so hours away from me! Awesome!
Another awesome video thanks Ian.
the water bottle fuckin killed me
I want to see Ian do a show like this but trying to style his hair I bet he’d come up with some crazy styles
Man, the ending to the new Red Dead is insane.
I don't think any notification makes me happier than these
"Just a little peice" Grabs the whole thing ??
Ian, please use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl and push it towards the blender. Thank you!! Love you!!
Fuck yeah for Take 5
19:10
Bro I love your videos ??
Red Dead Redemption 2's Graphics look great
Got to admit, the mental image of how that Texas Yum Yum would taste made me think it'd be too sweet. But now I really want to try it.
This is what you get for beating RDR2
Someone give this man a cooking show on a major network.
Welcome back to the Lone Star State, brother. Have a great time in Dallas.
"Surprisingly okay" is how most people describe me. 22:26
You fold with your hands you godless heathen
Sweet boy, I love watching you try your best... ; w ;
the new kitchen looks so great!!!! i hope texas is treating you well :)
Hella funny love your videos, great moves, keep it up, proud of you
Wait hold up, you in texas? WHAT TOWN?
A tip from someone who has experience using that exact brand of mixer: it's a good idea to EITHER have a small spatula on hand to push unmixed particulates back into the area of the bowl where they'll get picked up by the whisk/mixer attachment OR stop it on occasion and use a spoon/spatula to push the unmixed particulates deeper into the bowl. Do the former if your recipe requires constant mixing, which some recipes do. For this kind of recipe either method would work.
for some reason his kitchen looks super familiar.
OMFG WHAT IF YOU MADE THE FIRST RECIPE WITH CHOCOLATE PUDDING AND USED PEANUTBUTTER INSTEAD OF CREAMCHEESE?????????????????????????????
Dunno why this episode is feeling like a nice warm blanket right now...
Ian how much money is it going to take to make this and the yugioh card openings a weekly thing because God, I need more brutalmoose
Hey Ian I got a halloween bark recipe for you to try. Melt white chocolate, then mix in candy corn and pretzel pieces, spread and chill.
Damn that Dead Red Redemption DLC is looking nice
I have never seen this guy before. This is my first video. Is this all actually real? Has he never seen a cooking show before? OMG WHY IS THE S FROM SEEN ON A DIFFERENT LINE????
Man red dead redemption 2 is looking fantastic
Ian! Taste test gluten-free food next!!
That chocolate one would be better if you just mixed the toppings into the chocolate when it was melty and then letting it harden again... though if you do it that way you would be better off sprinkling salt on AFTER it's spread out rather than mixing it into the chocolate.
I'm def makin texas yum yum
That black cup sure seems like more than one Cup. And each time it calls for only 1 1/2 cups of milk, that pitcher seems to be WAY more than 1 1/2 cups.
It amazes me how incompetent an adult can be in both his own kitchen and the grocery store. Godspeed, Ian, Godspeed.
Please do a Beef Wellington with Plops.
Ian has found his true calling with brutalfoods.
I think I get more excited for a Brutal Food video than any other video in my subscription box. It was like when a new JonTron would come out at the height of his popularity. Also - getting some serious Town with No Name vibes from your aesthetic, Ian.
Ian's videos legitimately are a cure for situational depression. I immediately felt better about my love life despite it having nothing to do with anything in here.
As a Texan, I can confirm that the intro is 100% fully accurate and now flawed in any way.
What the hell is larfin' anyhow?
Over 30 minutes of quality ian time
THEM SUCKERS TASTY
Now introducing kitchen number 168352946826483729646
gotta love the plop reference
As always Ian, your editing equally frightens and intrigues me
#foldingfail
I appreciate the bopit noises you mixed in when you took the mixer head off
??
When folding something in, you use a rubber spatula with the ingredients in the bowl, and go under them all, flip one side onto the other, repeat. You are folding the ingredients together as you would fold a piece of paper. Nice Video ( :
Christ cowboy Ian running down the riverwalk absolutely killed me
man... your editing is so creative
Noooo why would you leave Washington it's the best state
Howdy ian
I love your editing.
BACK TO YEEHAW COUNTRY
I crack up every time I hear the whip noise when you slap your steed lol
Don't worry with the mixer... I don't think anyone that's seen a single one of these videos is going to follow your example when it comes to cooking
It wouldnt be brutalfoods if you had the right portions
Did you check for toffee in the baking aisle? It's one of those things you'd think you would find in the candy aisle, but I usually see bags of toffee bits in the same spot as the chocolate chips.
I wanna be a cowwwboyyy babyyyy
I love brutal foods so much man, I look forward to watching it whenever a new episode pops up. Ian, you are a comedic genius and I hope you continue to upload these more frequently. I hope you read this! <3
Do you not have a food processor in texas? you could've chopped those nuts with a food processor in like 1 minute instead of using a chef's knife.
Ian kills once again. RIP old guy. RIP chocolate.
I don't think I can top all the howdy and y'all jokes in this video. Ye sure did a.. hankering... job... something.
Red read redemption 2 gameplay at 0:34
I'm sorry dude, but I can't watch any of your Brutal Foods videos without eating!!! runs off to prepare lunch
This video truly is the yee to my haw
Lmao he’s such a disaster in the kitchen
Stand mixer tip Yes stand mixers are notorious for not mixing stuff on the sides well. In the future I would recommend stopping the mixing for a second, using a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume mixing. Repeat as necessary.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!!!
You should try banana cream pie. Similar to the first recipe but replace the chocolate with ripe bananas and remove the cream cheese
Welcome back to Texas fellow UNT alumni!
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a lot different than the reviews lead me to believe
Does ian Brokeback himself?
"I want a Werthers."
Plop ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
When is Ian going to get around to making a Tuna Noodle?
What a lovely new kitchen!
ian thats a bull not a horse
I had to click off porn so fast that I had to listen to that garbage while I watched this mastapiece
I could not have possibly asked for a better intro
Ian affecting the Texas drawl is funny, but it does remind me of the way I usually speak Swedish with a neutral non-regional dialect (the 'common tongue', if you will) but just naturally affect a strong local dialect whenever I'm talking to my older grandparents. It's funny how a more interconnected world affects the way you talk to different people.
Is Cowboy Ian a canon character?
My God,so many calories.... :D
"I don't wanna talk about it, I'm just gonna eat it." Best thing you can say about food.
Hell yeah brother.
Ian's fascination with basic culinary ideas is endearing.
0:30, this needs to become a MEME!
My Memaw use to make what you call, "Texas Yum Yum." We just called it Pudding Pie. It fairness, yours looks good for someone who hasn't been making it for a while. You definitely need to work on rationing your layers, but it still looks good. As far as the "Cowboy Bark," I have my doubts about it without salt. Even with salt on the pretzels, peanuts, and almonds, it needs salt to take the edge off of the immense sweet.
From one Ian to another, thank you for an amzing and silly video. I love your editing! you made my day!
BRUTALFOODS FOOD LAB THEME PLAYS M-Manly Muscles???
I sorely missed you, Brutal. Also, as a born and raised "Yankee", I always had access to pudding pie. I question the validity of its Texan origins. haha
You sure like saying yum yum
You might dont know this but Brutalmoose was Araki's inspiration for Gyro Zeppeli in Part 7.
"Mmm them suckers tasty" ian oct 28 2018
Ian, you are back in Texas and you couldn't even show support of your own state's economy by buying H-E-B brand? Why don't you just emigrate to Canada if you're not even going to try?
The whisk attachment is always best for cream cheese. Edit: I make a lot of cheese cake. Brutalmoose used cream cheese fresh from the fridge, which I never do. I always warm the cream cheese first either on the counter for an hour or so or just in the microwave.
i think the texas air has gotten to you...
I come for the food I stay for the editing
i dont know if i like sprinkle time
Sunday just got a whole lot better!
I dont think Plops is real...
Hey Patrick, what am I?
Bruhj
That's a sweet ass kitchen!
I love how this channel is slowly becoming a food channel.
I'm gonna try making the Texas Yum Yum pudding pie.
As someone who bakes a lot, I'll give you the short version of folding: You put the ingredient you want to fold in on top of the rest of the mixture. You use a spatula to fold the mixture over the new ingredient, pressing down just a little bit. Then you fold it over itself again, and again, until the ingredient is just barely combined. The point of the whipped cream is to make the mixture fluffier, what with all the air in whipped cream. If you just mix it in, you destroy all the tiny air bubbles in the whipped cream and you don't get the fluffiness. Folding preserves most of the air bubbles and spreads them throughout the whole mixture.
IAN, HELP! Can I ake this if I currently reside in Massachusetts or is it strictly for cowboys?
This is the Halloween episode? I’m not mad just curious lol
YOU LIVE IN TEXAS NOW, HOWDY FAM
0:58 the flight. genius.
Ian, i have to say, your videos are so good :D Wish u got more wievs :/ Editing is just on a different level! Not sure its a higher level, but surely a different one :D
YEE (and I cannot stress this enough) HAW
Are you in Dallas? I feel like I made fun of you behind your back at a concert before I started following your videos
Congratulations on your move to Texas. You'll be better in no time. In other words you're not getting better.
i'm a little sad that ian isn't in seattle anymore. oh well
Hell yea welcome back to texas bro!! Im gonna make the yum yum pie for sure next time double back the candy and wrap a towel around that so if u drop any none is wasted
Wow, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks really immersive.
PLOP
You’re definitely my number 1 favorite creator. Your personality, the editing ... it’s all too perfect lol!
We gotta get this man some silicone spatulas.
fry some wood
Ian took a bite of that Texas Yum Yum and now it's in his Tum Tum.
Mixing pro tip: Scrape things off of the sides and attachment periodically so that it all gets beaten together!
howdy partner, I too like the salt
fry some wood and eat it while you review it
I first subbed cause I liked your Lego Island videos but now I'm here for the really novice cooking videos and I'm not disappointed in the slightest.
Fold things in by hand. You basically take a spatula, add whatever you are folding in slowly, and sort of gently scrape and fold over the mixture very gently. I'm pretty sure a mixer can't get the job done, the aim is to keep it fluffy or prevent gluten from forming, depending on the recipe. Also, stand mixers don't scrape the sides, you have to do that yourself with a spatula. On another note, did your parents not cook or something? A lot of this is pretty basic stuff.
Alright, alright, alright, The Brutalmoose has returned! Great video dude, your editing is so damn creative and clever!
Wow. The new Red dead looks great
Zero folding happened.
What a handsome cowboy.
Yo i also live in dallas.
It's like watching your drunk friend trying to flirt with a beautiful woman. It's somehow painful to watch, but it is still too entertaining to look away ^^
Yeehaw
Thanks for brightening my day with this new video, Ian!
You could've tried heath bars for the toffee element. Also pudding pies are a favorite of my dad's- my mom used to make pistachio flavored ones for him all the time
Why did we switch places? I LIVED IN TEXAS FOR 26 YEARS (Houston and Dallas) AND JUST MOVED AWAY LAST YEAR AHHHHH
Drinkin a Mondo there, eh?
You moved FROM Washington TO Texas? That's the wrong order.
You should probably lift the mixer's head to make putting the ingredients into the bowl easier.
I feel like I just joined a sprinkles cult
Welcome back to texas :)
Amazed you were able to cook while maintaining your balance on that steed of yours for as long as you did! Very proud of you, Ian.
would eat whipped topping with yellow cake any day
as a legit Texan I am in TEARS. bless your heart
Why Ranger Ian, you’re lookin’ mighty handsome in that cowboy getup o’ yours... making me wanna a-hoot-an-a-holler!
Your editing is so fun and makes me laugh every video! XD as a fellow Texan, I can appreciate the humor in all this and now I need me some Tx yum yum!
Digging the new brutal kitchen, Ian.
Who needs E3 when you can have T3
Anyone noticed the clock doesn't work? ^^
Before now, I didn't realize how distinct Texas kitchens looked. Like I swear I've been in that exact kitchen in several different people's houses. Anyways, welcome back and I can't wait for more Brutal Foods to take place in this very Texan kitchen.
oh boy. new moose.
That "Farmer's Only" joke had me rollin'! I know I'm gonna be randomly laughing about that all week
This editing always amazes me. Love this channel!
OMG I love how simple he is, I can relate to him so much! Never change! I love you the way you are. Your videos make my day <3
Did you borrow your sisters mixer? Or are you just into the gayest color, sea foam green?
Oh my god, this video is golden
It's refreshing to see food videos that are not only comfortable with but even celebratory of shitty processed grocery shop food
The Texas Yum Yum my mother-in-law makes omits the vanilla pudding, and just does the three layers (chocolate, whip/sugar/cream cheese, and whip). Fits much better into the pie crust.
You have good taste in jazz. Also, 17:20 sounds like some Brutalmoose original midi creations? If so, you have talent, my friend
Yo. For real. You make kitchen videos interesting enough to see all of it. I really like how you edit all to make that possible. Congratulations from a Spaniard fan.
Well ya see. I love these videos.
Hey America? What's whipped topping?
Someone's been playing Red Dead Redemption 2
Ian's broke and moved back home. No self-respecting man has magnetic knick-knacks and such on their fridge
Damn Ian, Washington is gonna miss you :c
God's not dead. He's right here, riding a fake bull.
I think you should make every video with plops the bull for now on. I will not be satisfied unless I see plops.
For pudding dishes like the Yum Yum, freezing them as opposing to just refrigerating them makes them easier to serve
god i would die for your new kitchen, it's gorgeous.
Man, 34 minutes but felt like it was over tooo sooon :( That's a rare talent, I usually bookmark 30min+ youtube videos to never watch them later.
You could have used a crushed up Heath candy bar for the toffee bits.
Is it me or is there some sort of high pitch sound in the background from time to time?
I feel that the oreo on the bark was unnecessary
Red Dead Redemption 2 secret level
Man, the amount of effort that goes into the editing is astonishing. It's a great contrast to the laziness in filming/acting. You care so much and at the same time, you couldn't care less. You are a gift to the world.
Great video as always! I really wanna try that first recipe.
As someone who is Gluten Free from having Gluten Intolerance, I can assume that yes Ian you were probably in the Gluten Free Isle, nearly every supermarket has one of those now. Also, Glutino makes some pretty good chocolate covered pretzels but I won't argue on the plain ones, they are kinda not great.
Please do a gluten free video
the texas yum yum kinda reminds me of mississippi mud pie
Hey your kitchen has the same layout as my parents, except there is no island. Safe to assume the house has the same layout and I can say stalkery things without having to work for it.
There's something about Ian in that hat that makes me say "yeehaw!" if you know what I mean. ;)
Plop
I hope we get some Void for spooky halloween!
You didn’t get this stuff at HEB????? And you call yourself a Texan
Huh, a cowboy related Brutalmoose video? Wonder what this could be related to? :p Fantastic video as always my dude!
You didn’t get this stuff at HEB????? And you call yourself a Texan
YEEEE-HAW.
its not a brutalfoods episode if im not crying the entire way through.... it really is brutal...
You should use your spatula the push the side stuff back into the area that is getting mixed
This intro scene solidifies Ian as the greatest food youtuber
I am strangely disappointed the clock in the kitchen is not real.
32:33 guess thats why they call him plops
Yes, Ian, pretzels Are made with flour. That means they have gluten. Pretzels are usually in the potato chip aisle in my experience, but rarely they're with the crackers or on their own endcap.
I love it. The new kitchen, the intro, everything!
Next week's video: Ian gets ants
Upload more videos
Its like ?? but sweet
rubber spatulas are a thing of god, amazing
I'm lovin' the new kitchen??
Great vid but I’d recommend to lapel mic in the future
I love your "it's probably fine" approach to cooking. XD
Yee (And I cannot stress this enough) Haw
Why does the clock always tell the same hour?
Ian's editing just gets better and better ??????
Ian, for cutting nuts and other small hard foods you should use a food processor. it's much faster and you have a lower chance of cutting yourself. also don't use a hardware hammer to crush foods, use a small wooden mallet. the mallet wont break the bag and is available at most stores. also for removing chocolate from a bowl like that use a rubber or silicone spatula, it's easier to scrape it off the sides since it's flexible.
Yee Haw
Caramel....CARAMEL?! IT'S BUTTERSCOTCH YOU UNCULTURED SWINE!!!
As a fellow Texas resident, the only dessert we have is another beer (or Dr. Pepper for the young'ins).
yee haw
I think you 'chill' things in the freezer my man
??????…
Nice new kitchen, Ian. Now you don't have to squeeze yourself between a counter and an oven xD
Who you callin pin head
plop
new kitchen looks great! I hope your happy to be back in Texas. I loved the video and can't wait to see the next!!!!!!!!!
yeehaw
How many times has Ian gotten food stuck in whisks and whisk-like attachments? AND IT'S A DIFFERENT WHISK EVERY TIME HAND WHISK TINY WHISK ELECTRIC MIXER WHISK ATTACHMENT
Ians outfit made me think of something. Ya'll ever heard of Ram Ranch?
Not gunna lie, I yehawed when I saw the River Walk.
Nobodys bothered by the feedback?
Man, that Texas Yum Yum looks pretty dang yum!
For some reason I thought that red drink, in the bottom right corner while you were cleaning, was cleaning fluid and I was MORTIFIED when you took a swig of it before I realised lmao
The sound effects are so good this episode. The old man ghost broke me.
that's a really nice kitchen. i need to get into the being a moose on youtube business
Plop
What's so great about dumb ol' Texas?
As a professional baker, this was... difficult to watch. Hilarious, but difficult. I audibly gasped a couple times. A+ content.
To avoid spilling when smashing stuff like Werthers, fold over a dishcloth over the ingredients, instead of using a plastic bag ;)
Ian buddy I love you and you're hilarious and great but holy crap Pretzels are made OUT of Gluten.
You kidding me!?!?! BrutalFoods on my birthday???? Man I already loved you can I like double love you or something cause this is insane, man.
Reminds me of the Jell-O Oreo pies that I make, or the Edward's Hershey Creme Pies! Anyone else ever had those? OMFG! They are orgasmic. I had to choose one night between Hershey Pie, and dick...Guess what Saia chose? Lmiao. The pie was strong in me that night, friends. Lmiao. Great as always, Ian. ??????
I could watch hundreds of these videos.
Ian, a wave like motion is good with a knife. Don’t really lift the whole blade up, lift it up to around the hilt, and continually bring down the blade and bring it up again.
MMMMMMM THEM SUCKERS TASTY!!!!! LOL
Werthers are amazing, they are the best thing since sliced bread
I'm assuming that will also he your Halloween costume?
I want to see you fly out to california to be taught by Rosanna Pansino. She'll teach you all you need to know about baking.
I thought nothing could top your Tiny Food intro, but you editing yourself riding your bull into a canal really takes the cake! LOL.
Always glad to see PLOP make a return.
Heath bars could have worked instead of werthers
3:54 that boy aint right
Yes, I always love this series! It makes my day. I love how you've transitioned away from your former content really well.
I don't like change
Don't mix with texas
Brutal foods is literally the only reason I'm subscribed
21:45 DO IT we want a video on that
10:15 Lol nope ?? Good effort tho ??
And using the mixer, it helps a lot if you pause the mixer and scrape down the sides with a spatula every now and then!!
I'm so happy for this dork. I've been following him since his Polar Express and Iron Soul reviews and such and it makes me so proud that he can afford filming equipment and a nice kitchen like this. He's not the best at understanding cooking instructions but that only makes him more charming.
kool aid bursts and fun pops. your moms the best
Hey so when you measure out powdered ingredients (sugar, flour, etc) you gotta spoon it into your measuring cup because otherwise it gets packed in and you're not measuring correctly. Except for brown sugar, you spoon that in and pack it in with the spoon.
Yaaas! Ian is using guittard chocolate chips, the only chocolate chips worth eating!
small tip for you! if youre trying to cut up nuts/pretzels or the like, instead of cutting them use the bottom of a sheet pan or sauté pan and set it on top of them and push down, crushes them nicely
A. You're supposed to scrape down the sides of the bowl. B. Folding is when you lightly mix ingredients by stirring (by hand) as if you were folding the mixture into itself. This is done with whipped cream and marangs, mirangs, merains? Whipped egg whites! to prevent the bubbles from being deflated.
it's pudding cheese cake and whipped cream whats not to like, other than the diabeties??
You've got a metabolism like whoa..
Y'all're forgetting that Ian is originally from Texas
19:20. So, this was a Halloween video all along!
My mom and I were binge watching brutal foods all night and then this pops up. Thanks, Ian!
Pretty cool that you could train your steer to only walk on its front legs.
Man, this Halloween special really was spooky! I’m all spooked! Look at me, being all spooked from that extra special spooky brutalfoods episode! Woo! Spook.
The mixer part physically hurt me
ian ffs look up a youtube video of how to fold whipped cream into batter. smh
You want to scrape down the sides of the mixer with the rubber spatula when working with it. Otherwise, you tend to get unmixed stuff on the edges
THE EDITING IS SUPERB
Hands down, best YouTubed out there. ?? love from Houston.
I watched this episode in the bath
Food is one of the few things Texas still has to be proud of.
nilla sounds like the white version of nigga
12:03 Yes? This is peta
I do hope you don't dress up like that for every video, having to twist yourself like that work, is kinda... uncomfortable even to watch.
Red Dead Refrigerator
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH brutalfoods. i have my own series based off yours. it'll never be as funny as yours sadly.,
Love the video, and I love your content but the editing is a bit obnoxious at least to me
love the editing as always. esp the chocolate chip bags screaming, always funny when screams get cut off
Toffee bits = Heath Bar broken up.
Watching Ian effortlessly gallop Plops across the San Antonio River Walk was the highlight of my day and I made 40 bucks a few hours ago, so you know this is golden
SO YOU REALLY JUST GON SCROLL PAST WITHOUT SAYIN' HOWDY...
Love you and these videos and their editing, Moose <3
How to tell if Ian likes a dessert Does he drink milk ?
Lovin' the new set! And the dark 'lab' area is also pretty great, like you took the werther's to get interrogated and tortured. I love the second Ian that shows up with the hammer for a moment! I would say less chocolate on the bark altogether, but in the first place, I probably wouldn't eat that, because I have a real problem with hard, crunchy things like brittle and stuff, although if it was soft enough, I'd try it. Yeah, though I'd probably pick of the oreos to eat on their own. Looking forward to the other creations you make in this kitchen, gonna be awesome!
Youtube didn't notify me :/
You're so wierd and I love it.
Ian, honey, I absolutely adore your videos and they just make my week!.... however, no, that is absolutely not how you fold. Try using a spatula more when you’re mixing. You can scrap down your sides with it, and fold the ingredients in with it. Otherwise, flawless!
Brutal fooooooods
I know several people who left Texas to jump on the herb train in CO and WA, every one of them have moved back to Texas. Texas is the best!
Great video, Ian. I have a weird question, what kind of microwave you have? I'm looking for a new microwave to get for my family for Christmas.
Just started the video and wow Red Dead Redemption 2 looks marvelous.
Wow the sequel to the hateful eight is so good!!!
Ian needs a new battery for his clock.
3:30 - Is... is this just because american pudding is different from ours or did you need to cook some of the needed milk and mix it and just didn't...? o_0 EDIT: It seems to have worked just fine. =D
the editing on this video is my favorite you've ever done by far
Another quality video from http://www.youtube.com/brutalmoose
If anyone ever decides to tweet one of these videos to Gordon Ramsay or something like that, let me know how that goes.
Wow do Texans actually eat sweets without a kilo of lard and meat? :O
Gluten free review soon?
The sorrows of young Werther’s...
Who else at like 18:25 just thought: MANLY MUSCLES!
I had no idea you were from Texas. You should do some more traditional Texas style cooking Edit: Y'all dun did gud cowboy!
I hate pudding, but that Texas Yum Yum looked... yum, yum.
Your extra texany-ness gave me HEB ads.
Don't you hurt that poor mixer
Folding 0/10. You gotta put the cool whip in the middle, then use the spatula to pull some cream cheese over it. Be careful not to pop too many bubbles in the cool whip. Thats the point of folding and not mixing.
Not gonna lie Texas really be like that sometimes everything is right except the weather
Y O U R O F F E R I N G D I S P L E A S E S P L O P S
The chocolate bark breaking in half was actually exactly right, chocolate bark is slammed on the tray to break it up into uneven pieces!
BRO that's probably the best video you've done so far and the call back to the water bottle being in the shot had me deader than a rattle snake on top of a 2nd rattle snake
welcome back to texas, where land is cheap and you can get several acres for the same price as a small apartment in california.
can u just watch like one episode of binging with babish
the video editing is 10/10, love it ian, keep up the good job. wow.
So a tip for next time with the mixer- Use the rubber spatula to scrape ingredients down the side of the bowl so they mix in better. You can do so without turning it off, or you can turn it off and do it all at once
Welcome back texas, or as we call it "Hell."
Cowboy Ian, sounds like a character that would be in Red Dead Redemption 2 who would chase you down while riding a bull.
I had a really bad day but this cheered me up immediately! ^^ Thanks
Ian can I visit you?
Are you high?
YOU have to scrape the sides Ian. You should also be scraping off the mixer attachment.
my family calls texas yum yum "Mississippi mud pie" and it's so good it has a subtitle: (better than sex) we also add pecans to a homemade graham cracker crust and we also usually make it in a casserole dish so you can see the layers
love the new kitchen ian!! lots of space for lots of brutalfoods
Today on brutal foods: candycrush
24:13 Nothing says "Either I'm flat broke or I filmed this a few days after moving" than a freezer with nothing but freezy pops in it.
LMAOOOOOO i cant believe this is what your content has come too. sad to say you played all the shitty learning games for the pc. hence the death of your content
never fails to entertain
THE CLOCK IS BROKEN
As an Ohioan, I gotta say you done Texas proud, pardner y'all.
The longer his hair is the closer we are to the next televoid episode
This Channel is a GEM ??
Stopped the video right after he talked about the pretzels, went to get a bag of Werther's toffees and WTF IS THIS COINCIDENCE?
Gluten free episode please!
Folding skill: 0/10 Folding uses a spatula, and you stir it up, making sure to get stuff from the bottom and pull it to the top
plop.
Yesss! I've been waiting on another Brutal Foods from you!!! My day has just been made :)
Steed? I think that’s a steer
And this is why you scrape the sides of the bowl with your rubber spatula, so you don't get streaks of flour or sugar in your batter or frosting. Also always be sure to get your ingredients to room temperature before using them unless otherwise state in a recipe. Things will incorporate easier if they are at room temperature.
Ian is slowly evolving into a better chef day by day. The keyword being slowly.
6:00 lol I had the same problem recently. Did u also borrow your mom's kitchen aid?
Giving Chef Ramsey a run for his money
When is the next game review coming out?
I love those sounds!
In the baking aisle, there should be a bag of toffee bits.
10 seconds in and im laughing my ass off. i love your channel
Welcome home pardner (I live near Houston so it's cool to see Ian back in Texas)
It dawned on me that he did all that work while wearing that ridiculous outfit. How did it not get in the way?
next video is just about the gluten-free version of things
9:50 Well you tried
Hey Moosey. Just thought I'd give a tip. Regardless of the terrible knife skills, try putting slightly wet paper towel, or a moist hand towel under your cutting board. That'll keep it from slipping. Also, I would totally watch a video of you doing a knife skills tutorial.
To fold - In a single action, run the spatula or spoon around the side, then along the base, of the bowl. Now fold the mixture over onto itself. Rotate the bowl 90°. Repeat until just combined.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is looking pretty good.
something oddly therapeutic about these types of videos
you can break the bark by covering the top with another baking sheet and shaking the two together. Peanut Brittle Method
I dont know if it's all that Texas sun or Moose making good dessert food but he looks so happy. Washington will miss you. Hope to see more videos soon.
I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch someoone who is terrible at something do the thing.
Mmm them suckers tasty
>Have an incredibly nice mixer anyone who cooks would want. >Never used it til now. I feel like I should tell you about food wishes but your unseasoned approach also makes your videos extra wonderful and sincere so I am at an impasse.
my boy.... you're supposed to scrape down the sides of the bowl while it's mixing so everything gets properly incorporated. My Boy.
The cowboy hat has revealed to me the Texas in your face and now I can't unsee it.
Welcome back to Texas!
Yeah for me its Milk Chocolate or GTFO. Funny video.
Also I have no problem with the channel if it turns in the furture into a cooking channel. Just a fun thought.
Ian's sound effect folder is probably bigger than my steam library
18:52 now Ian looks like that guy from Rednex. Please sing cotton eye Joe for us.
R u just slapping ur own ass in that costume?
Ian, you sadly need to rewiew the rest of the hungry man things. I think... but you don't have to if you don't have the stomach for it.
I was on edge the whole video, i was worried your steed will pop ????
Texas Yum Yum is the dumbest name I’ve ever heard for that particular desert For future note: Beat = paddle. Whisk = whisk. Use the paddle for pretty much anything that doesn’t ask you to whisk. As for folding, it’s done manually with a spatula, a slow process of mixing, not stirring.
Next episode: Plops burgers
yee yee ian
You needed the smaller boxes of pudding for the YumYum, and you stop halfway through mixing things to scrape the sides of the bowl for better incorporation. I'd also definitely suggest thawing your whipped topping completely before using it. Still, that recipe sounds delicious and I'd personally try it with other pudding flavors like chocolate and pistachio or vanilla and butterscotch. You could even use different crusts, like 'Nilla Wafer or Oreo cookie crust.
You supposed to fold not mix further. If you will mix whipped cream more it gonna turn to butter
Use a food processor for the nuts. It's quick and you won't hurt yourself.
Should've put the peanuts in a bag and smashed them up by tossing the bag at a wall/floor. Sometimes the best way to do something is also the most primitive way.
There's something special in the way Ian edits these videos where I feel if most other people were to try something similar, it'd come off as obnoxious or annoying, but I think because of Ian's relatively chill tone of voice it ends up mixing together just right
Can you like bring a real cook. To judge you. I would like that. I would watch that.
New kitchen again I see
Ian, when you smash something up in a bag, if you put a thick dish towel over it that helps with the bag breaking issue.
I- I don’t like pudding...
The plop made a comeback!
Man, words can't express how much I appreciate the effort in editing you put in.
The whisk attachment is for egg whites for meringues
When I think Texas dessert I think orange salad.
TEXAS Y ' ALL
Rejoice, a new brutalfoods!!!
I’ve never seen someone fold stuff in with a kitchen aid before usually it’s done by hand
Methinks the Brutalfoods Food Lab(TM) could use a food processor.
Your uploads are worth the wait.
Wtf I accidentally disliked it oh God Sorry about that! I loved it and fixed my mistake!
Ur from texas, you should know literally all pie is atleast 3 inches higher than the crust
I love your food videos! They make my day!!! Youre certainly my favorite food review/cooking channel.
Texas girl approved ??
The amount of sugar here is more than I eat in a year. Sickening. Another, if you please, chef Ian.
Instead of the hard candy I think toffee like Heath would be better.
Wrong attachment ! Nooooooòo!!!
Watching your videos is like the YouTube equivalent of playing The Sims 1. Specifically The Sims 1, not the others. Y'know what I mean?
The Texas Cheesecake massacre would go on to be one of the most BrutalFood crimes in American history.
I'm not certain if it's the same for something like the sugar you have, but typically folding is done by hand, not with an electric mixed. The simplest way I can explain it is just to take batter from the bottom and bring it to the top while slowly adding whatever you're folding in as you go until whatever you're folding in is distributed evenly. Might be different for something like sugar, but that's how it's done for when folding things like chocolate chips or berries into cake and the like.
O m l u didn't even fold it
One of the things I would have done differently with the bark is patting down the toppings into the chocolate so they'd have a better grip. IDK if you did that off-camera or not, and I'm not completely convinced it would have helped keep the oreos attached, but it might have.
The sprinkles part saved my soul
I am the only one that wants so badly that egg kitchen cloth?
Nothing in his freezer except popsicles
SOO GOOD, WE ARE HUNGRY FOR MORE IAN!
the red dead 2 role play is off the roof
5:56 ITS CALLED AN AGITATOR!!!! its an aggitator, damn it.
I love your content and it always makes me smile but for some reason this episode had me dying of laughter
I love you
12:01 I'm calling peta
Being subscribed to Ian over the ears has been nothing less than an extended fever dream I never want to end.
As a Texan, I honestly feel so attacked right now
Brutalmoose is the exact kind of content I click like on before even watching the video ??????
man, always fun to watch these videos, especially with all the fun editing, good job ian.
Bring back city boy Ian
Small chopping tip, if you wanna dice alot of small things like the almonds, hold the knife sideways on your cutting board, put one hand on top of the middle of the knife slightly to the tip. Then use your other hand to bring the blade up and down, sort of like a lever to chop it finely.
Has Brutal Moose lost his mind after some sort of mental breakdown? What the HELL has happened to you man?
I know this is off topic, but I need you and Chadtronic to review Kill Joy 2 ASAP. There couldn’t be a better Halloween special.
Woah there cowboy ian, that horse is so well behaved in your kitchen
Electric mixers don't scrape the sides. You have to have a spatula on hand to scrape the sides down when stuff gets stuck. You also have to scrape down the beater occasionally. Also the whisk was the correct one to use. You're doing great though! :D
Folding in is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Say you were mixing chocolate chips into the dough... once you add chocolate chips to the bowl of dough then you use your mixing spoon to pull dough from the bottom of the bowl over the chocolate chips and keep repeating until it's evenly mixed. It works better than straight up mixing which might result lumps. Also depending on what your mixing you don't want to overmix (a lot of more complicated recipes can "break" which makes it go flat when you want something fluffy). Think of folding as basically a gentle way of mixing.
Looks like Ian took a train back to The Town With No Name.
You did not correctly fold in however you did pretty good with the kitchen aid navigation. Next time use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides once or twice and then you can use the same spatula for folding. Folding is a light turning method to incorporate whipped stuff. The kitchen aid works too aggressively, even at low speeds, and ruins whipped cream (and I’m guessing whipped topping too ).
I just wanna see how many people i can offend by saying YO FUCK TEXAS
You had me at Cowboy Ian.
Ian, you have graced me today with another video. I thank you.
Y U M
Don't recommend watching this while hungover
12:03 well, you realize that now you gotta cook with bull beef in a future episode
Get along little moosey!!
In the future, when you're adding ingredients to the bowl, you can lift the top of the blender out of the way, so you're not just smearing Whipped Topping all over your mixer.
MANLY MUSCLES!!!
no one'smentioned this yet but WHY THE HORSE NOISES WHEN THAT'S CLEARLY A BULL? ian pls
Everything's bigger in Texas™! Including that kitchen o' yours. Git 'er done, Moose!
Your sound effects crack me up, I love these videos Keep up the good work, Ian ??
I know its a subtle thing, but I love how you place your midrolls in thought out places in the videos. It just makes the whole thing more enjoyable
Love your cooking videos, your humour is so damn good I could watch you cook literally anything even, Human FLESH (demonic laughter)
Yum yum
The editing in this video is so unique and interesting! I love it. Ian has really stepped up his game.
SHOUT-OUT FROM THE DALLAS, TEXAS METROPLEX!!!! NO WONDER WE THINK AND LIKE THINGS SO SIMILARLY, WE'RE FROM THE SAME PLACE!!!!! TEXAS FOOD IS TO DIE FOR AT IT'S BEST, HUGE FAN, ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED YOUTUBERS. LOVE FROM NORTH TEXAS, IAN!!! ???????????????????????
I'll never get over that AIM door sound
Damn I’ll actually make the first recipe at least.
bro I love your editing so much it's so surreal and hilarious ahahahhaaha
I'm sorry, Ian, but are you ever going to do another Televoid episode, or game review?
Poor Ian realizing he wasted some of the yum yum broke my heart!
I haven't got to this missions yet in Red Dead 2.
To fold in something you take it and sort of flip the spoon in whatever you're folding it into, this is to avoid ingredients splashing and to help well mixing ingredients of different densities, so in other words, it's completely unnecessary in many cases and people had no reason to get mad at you because in the end it effected literally nothing.
You don't know how long I've been waiting for a new Ep. ; D
binging with brutalmoose
If it weren't for you I wouldn't have known of gluten free pretzels and if they were different from normal pretzels Thanks Ian
All dem dislikes are from good for nothin city slickers
Howdy my nigga
Not done with the video but THE WERTHERS IS A MISTAKE DONT DO IT
Everything that contains flour has gluten normally. Anything that doensn't, doesn't. Gluten is a protein the wheat plant makes that links up with itsself and gives bread products their structure.
After mixing with the mixer, it's best to take a rubber spatula and scrape the sides/bottom of your mixing bowl, as well as scrape off the mixing tool you used. While a mixer is faster than hand stirring it sometimes leaves clumps where the mixer doesn't quite reach. Plus using a spatula to scrape will save you from having to use your fingers, and therefore less messy Edit: oh! Also you can find regular baking caramel in the baking department too, just an extra thought!
These are my absolute favorite videos on youtube, literally the only ones that make me laugh out loud.
33:47 loved the subtle "plop" there
Hey Ian, great video, but I've got a couple tips! - Good call on having a towel to wipe your hands on but if you're going to taste things with your hand, you should use your pinky to minimize cross-contamination and keep things a little cleaner. Your pointer finger generally touches more and is less sanitary. Usually, if only you're eating it you're safe though, as long as you start by washing your hands - You need to scrape down the sides of our mixing bowl with a spatula, that's why all the powdered sugar wasn't mixed in - Folding is a gentle mixing method that usually involves mixing using a spatula. You usually do this if one of the things you're mixing is some kind of foam or otherwise whipped and you're trying to preserve that Your technique has really improved since the start of the series though, awesome job!!
"pretty stinkin' yum"
I love the intro
I would let daddy Ian ride me
While I prefer dark chocolate myself, I do see how milk chocolate would've worked better. The milk in milk chocolate actually makes the chocolate softer and melt faster. The salt could've balanced the taste too. I hope you find that darned salt in the next video! And also...it's so good to see you back, Ian! Been watching your older videos in the past couple of weeks because I missed you that much lmao
Man, I've gotta send in some Pennsylvania German recipes sometime. A few of them are pretty bonkers.
Congrats! You just hooked me to your channel!
MANLY MUSCLES!!!
Yay more brutal foods! Texas Ian really rocks that hat.
San Antonio c,:
Person with celiac here. If you ever try gluten free stuff, be warned that it's basically the same but mushier and drier.
Yay Brutalmoose! I've been waiting for this!
Does Ian live in Texas now?
This is a gross appropriation of my culture
Ah man i love these food episodes
in a stand mixer ya gotta scrape down the sides when mixing things to get it all incorporated
It's so nice to see you back. I've missed your awesome videos.
Its just a guess but some store layouts can be confusing. Real pretzels are usually in the chips aisle, while gluten free gets its own section somewhere else.
howdy folks
To fold something in, use a rubber spatula or similar object (not a regular spatula though) and scrape down to the bottom of whatever container you’re using, then try to literally fold the mixture in on itself. Continue until combined. And that reaction to gluten free pretzels was all too real. I feel your pain.
For the nuts I would of put them in a bag and crush them with a Meat Tenderizer like my mom use to do with her fudge when she put nuts in it.
My entire life is just waiting for another Brutalmoose video.
plop
When shit gets stuck on the side of your mixing bowl you got to scrape it all to the middle
Ian, I only found your channel a week ago and you're already one of my favorites. Your food videos are some of the best original content on youtube and I'm absolutely salivating for more!
Red Dead 3 looks great!
i swear, ian is the only youtuber whose videos get better and better throughout the years
Omg that intro, I think I died
Ian, I fucking love these videos man. Keep up the amazing work
Folding in, so far as my experience goes, is using a spatula to scoop the base over what you are adding in. Better not to use the full cup all at once. For chopping nuts, just use a food processor. Hit pulse a few times, and you'll be set. Also much safer. If you ever need toffee bits again, in the baking aisle, you should be able to find Heath bar bits. Or just buy a couple Heath bars and smash them up (the bag method will work fine, so long as you don't let them melt.)
idea for a spinoff of brutal food "learning kitchen concepts with ian"
This is one rootin' tootin' video.
I love the editing in your videos! It always makes me laugh
Not even five minutes in and I think this is my favorite brutal foods so far
Y'all should review one of the Kraft Mac and Cheese frozen dinners and maybe some of the box varieties of Mac and Cheese.
I would love to watch you make one of my vegan cookie recipes. You'd probably get some good humor out of my butter and egg replacer.
plop
You americans with ur weird giant milk jugs Milk is supposed to be in bags u weirdos
So much counter space. I want.
This feels oddly racist against Texans. #Cowboylivesmatter
Yo Ian, please do a meetup now that you're in Texas! ??
I missed your videos man, hope you do a Halloween episode! Although this was pretty spooky....
So here's a cooking tip that doesn't really apply to this particular video, but it may be helpful to know for the future so I thought I'd comment on it anyway. My inner chef panicked for a moment when I saw you using chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate. It took me a minute to remember chips are fine for a recipe like this, where the chocolate is by itself. But if you ever have to mix melted chocolate with something like milk or cream, don't use chips! They have added ingredients to help keep their shape, so they don't properly mix into the liquid. Globs of chocolate separate out, and the whole thing never becomes smooth. So there's my very tangential cooking tip for you
If that’s not whole milk you’re not a real Texan.
Omg, yes!
Riding a Bull inside your house?! I've not seen such bravery
Mixer tip: The whisk part of the mixer is best when you’re trying to thicken something Like if you’re beating egg whites or making whipped cream. If your just mixing use the other one, I’m not sure what it’s called
Another Brutal Moose Classic! Great work! Keep it up!
Impressive how your horse is constantly doing a handstand
"I just made chocolate pudding, and then I ate it." I'd watch it ????
Ian. Seriously. This might be your best video yet! Yee-Haw!!
Dear Ian: When you use a kitchenaid, you have to scrape the stuff off the sides with a spatula so it falls into the bottom of the bowl and everything mixes right. To "Fold" means to gently fold the ingredients together using a spatula. demonstrated here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7P78MrqArk We do it so the fluffiness of the ingredients is not compromised. Your nut-chopping technique is fine! Keep your free hand on the back of the blade and rock back and forth. A more precise way of melting chocolate (so you don't accidentally burn it) is to use the double boiler method demonstrated here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsBLZxZUGQ (you don't have to chop the chocolate first if it is already in chips) Keep your eye out for gluten-free shit. It's everywhere now, especially in the baking section, and most of the products do not hold up to the real deal. Nice self rotating dish thing! Sincerely, Someone who bakes a lot
Watching these is both hilarious and frustrating. That's an artform.
Sprinkle time was a life changing experience. Thank you Ian.
yeehaw
IT LIVES!
you had way too much fun making this video, haha!
ram ranch intensifies
Congrants on thee new place! :D
Yim yum
Hey Ian great video! That pie came out tight. Usually when I make pudding pies the pieces fall apart I do have some suggestions Whenever you work with cream cheese, thaw it out before hand (maybe an hour beforehand) You were also right you should have scraped down the confectioner's sugar while it was stirring (if you don't feel safe, stop the mixer then scrape)
Almonds are very good for you. Best way to eat them IMO is buy the M&Ms white bag.
Dadgum chief you're spoilin' us with 30 minutes of intensified Texan cuisine goodness
Love your channel! Beaumont native over here, partner!
Why dont you make more game rewiews?
“Preferred body type: living or recently deceased” Same, man. Same.
HES BACKKKKKKK
Sometimes I think you're serial killer till I realize I look the same way when I use tools, I love your edits and sounds effects really be having me dead ??????????
Liked the video just for the almond pun
Film theory: Ian is actually a good in his own universe, in which he can change a scenery a bunch of time and multiple of him exist, also his only way of entertainment is through a universal communication device to upload stuff on YouTube (of course I don't take this seriously, I'm joking)
You gotta do more Texas treats - may I recommend Bayou Goo Pie, kolaches, and Texas sheet cake?
bake something will'ya
Love the smooth jazz
Moose liking all these comments makes me think he was high while doing it.
That new kitchen looks better than my future
This is as American as it gets..I wanna go to America.
LOVE THE FUCKIN BOP IT SOUND EFFECTS AT 10:38
I can totally picture Plops getting bored while you're making the desserts, wanting to liven things up.
No you're supposed to buy the nuts already sliced xD
why did you move back to Texas? didn't you move like only a few months ago?
When my grandchildren ask me what did i use to watch im going to show them this
you're parent's house is nice !
I appreciate Ian embracing my culture and it's people.
Can't finish. GJ.
Get off your high horse, Ian! Seriosly though, I adore your videos. Thank you, they're real treasure
YOUR EDITING MAKES YOUR VIDEOS VERY ENGAGING
Well if people yelling @ you for not folding it correctly weren't telling you how, then they're in the wrong
Man all your videos crack me up so hard
why are you putting pretzels and salt on chocolate? whats happening in america? why do i get more scared of texas everytime i learn something new about it
More brutalfoods? Sign me up.
I wasn't really hungry, and only took a short break from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. But the Moose uploaded something, so here I am, pizza in hand, feet on the table. God, I love these videos. :-)
I think i would have just mixed everything into the melted chocolate instead of sprinkling it on top
For future nut reference, its better to stick them in a bag like you did the werthers and just hit them
a new brutalfoods, actually made my weekend
That’s one nice kitchen you got here cowboy
Get a slapchop.
So now that you're back home and still cook like a disaster, I feel like you should do a #brutalfoods episode with your mom or something.
Man's hair its amazing
Welcome back to Texas, Ian! .....yeehaw?
This is like one of the few things that has ever made me feel proud to be from texas i love u ian
I hope you enjoy making these videos as much as my friends and I enjoy watching them. Keep up the great work!
I gasp every time I see a new video
Sad that you have to leave your fellow YouTubers behind in Washington but welcome back to Texas!
Congrats on the move... if it's what you wanted. We're moving to Texas in a couple months ourselves.
There's something I made a few years ago for my birthday called "Man Bars" that turned out really good if you want to try another dessert recipe in the future. It's basically little cookies made of graham cracker, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, vanilla, salt, powdered sugar and either walnuts or pecans. When I made them, I subbed in peanuts because I don't really enjoy pecans or walnuts that much and it worked out really well.
Hey Moose! If you ever need to crush something, using a rolling pin or a meat tenderizer works well instead of a hammer :)
That's some tasty desserts y'all!
Folding in performance: Kinda?
Pretty sure Vincent Smith would be down for your version of the cowboy bark. After all he was sent to prison for stealing a bag of werthers.
Parchment paper should be the size of your baking pan, unless the recipe calls for it to go over
Do you create your own sound effects or do you have a huge library you got somewhere?
18:21 MANLY MUSCLES!
stoop kid never leaves his stoop
I’m from texas and this entire video is 100% accurate
Did little Ian run away. Plops for the win.
Who else thinks he looks like the llama deafault skin from fortnite season 6
Dislike for “smallmonds”
I've never tried a Take 5 bar until today. Ian is right about it being the best.
Legend has it that no tourist made it out alive crossing texas from one end to the other. All perished from clogged arteries from the good food
Good to see you back Moose! Yeehaw indeed and verily.
This series always worries me. I mean... he's never seen cream cheese?!?
beat the cream cheese. grab a base ball bat and beat that cream cheese like it owes you money
Why are you guessing how folding in works? Why not just look it up if you don't understand?
??????????
Why are you guessing how folding in works? Why not just look it up if you don't understand?
Your transitions are fucking awesome. You still edit your own stuff?
MORE BRUTAL FOODS YES
Our god has returned
I really wanted a halloween special but ian is using a costume so im happy,love you ian
Damn I moosed your editing
Welcome back to Texas! - From Houston
I feel that fridge thing, we had to put our leftover pizza on a plate bc the boxes were too big lol
this video made me say yeehaw
I wanna taste that YumYum. ( ?° ?? ?°)
I love red dead redemption 2
0:29 PUT IT ON A SHIRT!!
In regards to large chunks of toppings like Oreo not sticking, something else you can do that I've done with similar stuff, is to make up a little bit extra of the chocolate base and save it for after you've topped it, and kind of put light lines or swirls of the chocolate over the top, so when it sets it holds everything down a bit. I think for the second recipe my preferences would be to use milk chocolate too, I like chocolate but not big into bitter dark chocolate.
Oh man, I wanted to sleep but brutalmoose posted so I guess I won't
Please don't cut into the bags like you did with the chocolate chips. It's very easy to slip and stab yourself. For your health.
When there's untapped potential on the sides of the bowl, use a spatula to scrap down the sides, as you want to incorporate all the ingredients.
Love the spooky bits! They make this a semi Halloween video. XD
Jesus 3 brutalkitchen's in 2 years
Hope you enjoyed the evergreen state, please come back soon ?
I had one goal in life...to randomly be in Seattle doin' shenanigans...I'd see Ian and scream HEY MOOOOOSE! and run away into the night. You've deprived me of my stupid dream, man. Not cool.
Damn, I'm gonna miss that tiny kitchen
HE LIVES!!!
My culture is not a costume. We cows are very offended by it.
why tf am I critiquing your cooking ? I don't cook I only watch binging with babibi
MMM THEM SUCKERS TASTEY
This series should just be called "Ian has a hard time with whisks"
I love brutalfoods episodes
Fellur folding in something is putting the 2 ingredients in a bowl and then with a spatula scraping the bottom and "folding" it on top
Oreo were introduced March 6, 1912; 106 years ago and are a discount version Hydrox cookies which were made years before.
the editing in this video. like always, is fucking insane and i love it
2,300+ likes vs 13 dislikes
I've never been offended by Texas Stereotypes, but I've always been mildly annoyed because I'll go to tell someone Texas isn't like that but then 6 people on Horses just go past my house blocking the entire road and I know they're right.
-"in the worst case scenario we got too much chocolate and who doesn't love that?" -"the chocolate overpowers everything else" man I love brutalfoods
Whoa, that's a nice kitchen
Damn fine pie there.
Real Title of the episode: "Ian learns how to use a Kitchen Aid." :D
I love your editing so much
Wow. Apparently it's impossible for me to watch a BrutalFoods video without giving it a like before the end... ! Ian, your editing... It's is amazingly silly ! I love it ! The "plop" at 4:27 caught me off guard. Now let's continue watching.
There's never anything good on Sundays BrutalMoose: Howdy! I can fix that
Really enjoyed this quick look at Red Dead Redemption 2, looks promising
As a fellow Texan, I can confirm a rattlesnake on a second rattlesnake is rather fast.
I'm from Texas, too. The Mexican side. So less "yee-haw" and more "gimme your money ese before I fuck you up homes"
Congratulations on moving back to TX, Ian! I have family in the East of the state and have been thinking more and more of moving out there, ironically from WA!
Your editing is also just golden such a treaT
is your clock broken or did you freeze time to make this video?
Ah yes. The best god damn state in the country
I’m from Louisiana and I can’t comprehend why someone would choose to live in Texas. I prefer to believe Ian just did it for the lolz
24:30 - 24:45 alone deserves a Thumbs Up. :)
YAS!!!!!!!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN.
Never change, Ian.
Hello Ian, How about reviewing more frozen foods? Love, Me
Amazing video as always! ?
frozen pot pie reviews? banquet vs marie c’s?
that echo tho
Excellent Video! I am always excited when you"plop" out a new one. Keep on going making such good content, loving it!
I’m soooooo hard right now.
Welcome back to Tejas we missed ya’ll. Seeing you move about the kitchen with your trusty steed had me rolling. That looked mighty finely tasty and was a hoot to see you create. As always I love y’all videos. I certainly embraced my inner sprinkle. I didn’t know y’all had 30 men in the freezer, sounds pretty chilly.
Hope i see plops more in this channel
I'm only 10 minutes in but I have to stop and say Ian please get a spatula and use it instead of your fingers hhhhhhhh
Why do so many southern kitchens look like this?
I like how everyone is a professional chef apparently.
LOL! That intro, totally worth the wait for your new video :)
A brutalfoods episode! thumbing up regardless Vincent Smith will try to steal that bag of Werther's.
How are those freezer men doing?
How are you even alive you should have starved to death years ago
I don't know about you guys, but BrutalMoose is the only youtuber that really feels like your friend above everything else.
Red dead redemption 2 looks fantastic
Ian really has one of the best editing styleson YouTube
You know, I never thought I would see a man on a cow smashing Werther's Orginal in a garage with a hammer while hard rock plays. This is why Brutal Moose is the greatest, and why I'm scared of him
When using a electronic mixer, stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl so everything gets incorporated properly
Is the channel going to be called Texasmoose now?
23:50 peak comedy is not knowing if that's a typo or not.
I can feel the Texas flow thru my mouth and exit through my narrow urethra
IM CRYING
I live in Sweden and I have never heard of Whipped Topping. WTF is that?
Yee, and I cannot stress this enough, /HAW/!
Plop.
You need to make tuna noodles (my favourite) next time !
Moose Moving Up In Worlds
Chocolate pudding pies and chocolate covered pretzels are my favorite sweets so this vid made me hungry af. I agree that Milk chocolate would be better for the bark. nothing beats milk chocolate, pretzels and seasalt with a dash of caramel <3 I might try making some of that bark with my nephew, load him up on chocolate just before his mom picks him up. Great vid as always.
THE LEGEND IS BACKKK
I fucking love the little audio edits. It's very Ed, Edd n' Eddy.
Tha'ss gonna be some mighty tender beef by the time Ian is done beatin' the heck out've it :o I never heard of a Texas Yum Yum, buh... well, sure looks tasty :o
I'm so happy rn
A new house?! ??
Ian, I love you and I love your channel... But when did the channel become just about food? ??
in brazilian portuguese "anjo" literally means angel, but in recent years a repurposing has been happening where the meaning of it can be used as "a sweet person, so fun and adorable, someone so nice you just can't help but smile and laugh when you are in their presence" just to sumarize, when i watch ian's videos i just wanna scream "anjoooooooo" into the screen.
So I think the bark might have been more than 'eh' if you'd melted your caramel down into a salted caramel sauce and poured that over the top. That way there'd be less of a chance of breaking your tooth and dispersion of the caramel flavor with some salt which would help cut the dark chocolate taste. Also! Yes to hitting things in bags, though you can try the smooth end of a meat tenderizer so you don't rip the bag.
oh boy howdy this is a real TEXAN BOY THATS FOR SURE
absolutely wonderful content as always and that cowboy bark (yeehaw) looked delicious
I can't believe you did Texas desserts and the internet just completely failed you by not suggesting Texas Brownies, the single best chocolate-based dessert on the planet.
plop
Watching Ian mess around with that expensive piece of cooking equipment was a painful experience. Treat your kitchen aid with respect!!!
Brutalfoods may be my favorite thing on the Internet
I really enjoy those videos? It really make your editing/humour shine
this reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIR68SbPg-U
The world needs some "Plop" t-shirts
> Being on a diet > Watching Ian make desserts What coulf poffibly go fronf stuffing oreos in her mouth
When’s Ian getting his own TV show?
Red Dead Redemption 2 graphics looking good
I love these brutalfoods episodes IAN! But, what the hell happened to the televoid series man? You Can't just leave it like that. I mean, you can because it's your channel but, it would suck, lol! So yeah, dont leave it hanging like that, just yet Ian.
Ian's legs have gotten a lot shorter since the last time I saw him. Must be from all of the sitting he does during editing.
I love your channel and I love the food series you’re doing right now but ngl, you shouldn’t be allowed in the kitchen other than to do the basics.
The texas yum yum recipe calls for puddin', but can I substitute pudding instead?
19:25 ??Chocolate Rain??
wot in tasty texas tarnation is this? also, watching you try and operate an electric mixer was painful lol
this was more fun and informative than pornhub on sunday YEE HAW!
I thought you were going to call your steed PBG and am almost sad you hadn't.
Ian doesn't have an accent for someone that grew up in Texas
at the end there i was really expecting ian to say "and thats why they call him plops"
Ian dude, I you needed to split those pudding portions in half to make it look nice in the crust. You had enough to make two of the Texas YumYums. I'd still eat it tho. Chocolate pudding is my jam. Also, get yourself a decent SlapChop or something like that. That way you can chop up things like nuts and veggies without removing a finger. XD
Ian! Cowboy Ian? Thank you for the video! It kept me company while I built Ikea shelves. It also made me want food. Good job! Also, when you fed Plops the Texas Yum-yum at the end, did it result in a cowpie on the floor? Ahh, the challenges of being artificially fused to a steer.
You should try peppermint bark it’s really good
Such a highlight of my day seeing a new video from you, Ian. Now I'm hankerin' for some pudding.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty
Oh my god billy joe bob he’s back in town’
I have the sneaking suspicion that the Brutalfoods Kitchen Lab...may not be a kitchen lab...but a garage..
P L O P
Plop it! Mix it! Spread it! Chop it! Crush it! Melt it! Pour it! Top it! Freeze it! Spin it! Cut it! Eat it! Milk it!
The whole reason you can mostly only taste the dark chocolate, is because the salt helps cute through that strong, bittersweet dark chocolate.
Ian, I just wanted to say that I truly look forward to these food-centric videos more than almost any other content on YouTube. In fact, my subscription box is full of comedic food channels! I hope you realize how much fun and unique these are and I hope you never stop! Thanks again!
Man, this has me hyped for Red Dead Redemption
I love and appreciate the quality of your videos. Thank you. :)
Red dead redemption 2 looks good.
Ian using the mixer is some of the funniest shit. He has no fucking idea what hes doing
I know what I’m making at the next rodeo.
Oh :(
Hello Ian, you never seize to amaze me! You could literally read the back of a cereal box and you'd find a way to make it entertaining. Keep doing what you love and wish you the best, man. Probably your only fan from Saudi, Cheers. P.S. Sorry in advance if there are any grammatical errors. English is my second language.
Welcome to Texas! Shop at HEB
Tik tok made me lose faith in humanity Jesus where are you
Ian should make Surreal Memes tbh, his editing sometimes feels like one
When adding confectioner sugar or more powered type ingredients, sifting them helps with not ending up with chunks.It's looks great though :d
The Manly Muscles song was one of the best callbacks of all time. Thank you, sir.
These videos always brighten up my day, thank you.
The new red dead redemption 2 gameplay looks sick
T H E M S U C K E R S T A S T Y !
yeah, gluten free stuff is basically made without wheat flour (your standard white flour), and processed somewhere wheat flour isn't used either. usually a blend of different flours are used to compensate, and it tastes... weird sometimes. most gluten free bread tastes like moist cardboard. it's very sad. doubly sad that i have to be gluten free since i have celiac. but i've learned to cope. i'm sorry you had to experience the gluten free food taste sensation by surprise.
i have lived in texas my whole life and i can confirm everyone says y'all just about every other sentence
I was on my way to sleep but then saw this video. Sleep can definitely wait! (we have the same rice cooker, btw)
I am not going to get use to the new kitchen yet ya'll (I live in Ohio not Texas).
The way powdered sugar works, you have to use a spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup, because if you just scoop it regularly it packs together and you get too much. Unless the recipe specifies, it's better to spoon it in rather than scooping directly with the measuring cup.
I see someone is excited about the new red dead game.
My favorite chocolate bark is rocky road. Milk chocolate, marshmallows and almonds. Really tasty.
this is getting me in the mood for christmas, oddly enough
Why is there a huge bag of freezie pops in your freezer?
welcome to texas rupert the bear he is the bear with a lotta hair
It's like every time I turn around you're in a new kitchen. Kitchen World Tours.
Texas Mentioned, Swell with TEXAS
This just made my weekend. Great work Ian.
Dear Ian To fold something into something else, put both in the same bowl, grab a spatula or rubber scraper and scoop, lift, flip, drop, repeat. It's meant to gently mix two things together
Oh man, that Texas Yum Yum looks amazing. I might just have to give that a go.m myself.
The music sounds very much like it's from the early Spyro games, lol
How did cowboys make the bark back when there where no Oreo's?
18:32 is such a mood
Another brutalfoods is honestly christmas
lmfao I was dying when the plane traveled across the world just to get to the other side of the country
My dad’s old house looked just like this
Oh wow, never knew you're from Texas. Reminds me I have a character from Texas in my story I might never actually start. lol 19:14 - How did I guess he'd get smashed? lol (I didn't guess he'd become a ghost though)
Question: Am I only allowed to make and eat these tasty Texas treats in the titillating territory of Texas?
This dude feelin the red dead 2 fever
Totally accurate to Texas
Those "Bop It!" noises.
Try the second dessert with only peppermint/candy canes and salted crackers.
Don't get how you're not more popular on YouTube. You have Such a unique editing style and humour
I just fucking lost it at 25:39 how DARE I'm sOBBING
I love Brutalfoods so much! Between the editing and the laid back presentation and chill music, it just makes for quality entertainment.
So weird to see you actually prepared with all the ingredients and tools you need to complete something. I can't say I like it...
10:52 Me when I see that Ian uploaded a new vid
Everything’s bigger in Texas, including the kitchens
Dude what the hell, how can someone be this good at making videos. Top tier content my man
make sure you scrape the bowl, so you get all the ingredients mixed in next time also its easier to just put the whipped topping in a pipping bag easier to design and cover,
Pro: the editing and comedy of Brutalfoods is phenomenal! Con: so MESSY!!
And I thought Red Dead Redemption 2 would be my favorite piece of western-themed entertainment this weekend.
I'm like man that cleaner looks like a squeeze it. Then he proceeds to drink it.
I missed you Ian, I'm only a minute and a half in and it's already worth the wait
yeehaw pardner im the comment man wid de stereotypical texan accen’ an southern spellin! i aint so creative wid these comments, but i sure do try pardner!
Ian. When folding something into something else, typically you do it by hand. What you did is more like incorperating. Folding is literally like, folding. But you still did a decent job for the most part. Folding creates a more light and airy texture when done right. You might notice that your pudding pie is a bit dense. That's the difference. Incorperating is something you do when you fully want something mixed in. And Ian, finally... Your knife skills still scare the shit out of me, lol.
diabetes.
This video is a Texas treat
10:39 "push it.. twist it.." BOP IT
P L O P
I may be late but I don't care!!! Love your vids Ian! Keep em coming
Does your family ever watch your videos and question your sanity? ??
ian.....i reckon that horse yer riding looks suspiciously like a bull....juss sayin, pardner.
Best RDR2 gameplay yet
What does ian use on his hair it always has such volume
Red Dead RedemptIAN
Red dead redemption 2 looks great!
Plops is the goodest boi
Dude finally I love these videos ian pro chef tip put a moist towel or paper towel under your cutting board so it doesnt move when you cut... on it. Also tried making your chocolate Mason jar penut butter balls came out bomb !
Can't get enough of these cooking videos, keep it up Ian! I'd love to see you try some foreign recipes as well (Like "brigadeiro" and "coxinha" from Brazil).
Food Network better be paying attention to our boy Ian
15:33 As an architecture graduate, I am appreciative of Ian's measuring system and can confirm that we also use it in the field
I wish Brutalmoose could go back reviewing bad pc games or video games.
Ol' Texas Tanner strikes again
I remember when this guy used to do mainly game reviews. Now, he's the only cooking YouTuber I'm subscribed to.
Honner the texas flag, i pledge allegiance to thee,texas,one state under god one and indivisible Edit: HOLY CRAP I realized that texas.one is a real website so I just fixed this
yes.
Cowboy jesus
chocolate sprinkles aka shiny rat turds
finally a relatable youtube chef. i also spent an unreasonably long amount of time trying to get the mixer attachment off when i first used a kitchenaid
Ian's hair is so fabulous, I'm really jealous.
Texturally, pudding is repulsive to me ??
another masterpiece!! Congrats on the new kitchen! I know you are a proud Texan, so this was a great video for you to do :)
I had no clue you were from Texas That's awesome! I love my state. Now I highly recommend checking out hobby lobby for more science kits. They'll definitely have some!
And the Texas Yum Yum has been entered into the Clean Plate Club.
Y'all is pretty Southern, and ain't is too. However, they both have nothing on the majesty of y'ain't.
God I love these videos so much Great editing, great humor, great long video time, great hair
You can never predict Ian. I was fully expecting some Halloween what not but instead we have a video about pies! Still great content
My wife cried when you "folded"
Hey, I have the same paddle thing! Next time I cook up something, I’ll feel like I’m on BrutalFoods in my own home!
As a texan, I approve of this video. ??
Cowboy Ian is best Ian
next time you need toffee bits and can't find any, just break up a few heath bars! might only work if what you're making already has chocolate in it but they're MUCH easier to work with than hard candy imo
This new red dead redemption is looking damn fine
PLOP
fuck y'all
You should have made fried chicken since you are in the south
Next time you need toffee, look for Heath bars. They're toffee and you can break them up
Cool. 5 ads on one video!
I simply adore these episodes.
Your hair is so long and majestic. Glad to see you are still alive though.
"yee haw" -Ian hecox 2018
I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but I think your clock needs batteries
Ian: time for me to break up the Carmel, "gets a hammer" Me: why the f*** would you use that, just use a rolling pin lol.
BrutalMoose: Oh baby Me: a triple
Clicked on this video so hard, I might have injured my finger...
l still love to think how the channel starting out was doing game reviews like caddy and now we out here makin' food, I'm really enjoying these videos and hope to see more in the future
I'm just a hotdog....yeehaw.
Am I the only person who noticed the clock behind him was 1:50 throughout the video :D
chorp
You did the folding correctly, I don't know what everyone else is talking about. The only thing you messed up on was breaking your pretzles and Oreos. You are suppose to use a frying pan.
This is my girlfriend and I's favorite show to watch together. We're gonna try making the pie!
I'd give this video 5 yum yums out of 5
Yes
Just in time for Red Dead Redemption 2
Every added blip of funny audio you edit in makes your vids 1000x better. Keep it up, E.
Your moms kitchen is pretty nice.
your hair looks so nice, beautiful, and luscious
DAMN now that's a sexy cowboy
The best way to spend a fall Sunday. Thanks for another fun food video Moose!
I think I would gag with the Texas Yum Yum. Too much whip cream.
I FOUND SQUIRREL IN THE WATER WITH A HELMET,I WILL COOK IT AND MAKE IT A SNACK
Ian your amazing at piano!
"I need a scooper thing" PROCEEDS TO USE SPATULA
This is embarrassing, but the whole time I kept getting worried he'd lose his balance and fall off the bull...
Damn, I want me some Texas Yum Yum
I got an HEB ad for their brand of ice cream. Doesn't get anymore Texan than that.
My happy place is the brutalfoods kitchen where it literally rains chocolate and it's always sprinkle time.
i was just thinking about brutalfoods the other night, glad to know i hold a psychic influence over you
THE BOY'S BACK IN TOWN
Ian, for chopping up peanuts or any kinds of almonds, just get a machine for doing that. I'm in Europe so I have no idea what they're called out in the states but this will save you a lot of time and fingers!
That is a Texas sized bag of powdered sugar.
hey im in texas do you wanna swing by grapevine and buy my insane clown posse cds
Hi! I saw some other people mention scraping down the mixing bowl to get everything mixed; but idk if anyone has mentioned that you can scrape down the bowl with the soft silicone spatula you have, it scrapes everything down and is more easy to get excess off of instead of a spoon. You sort of make a stabbing motion around the inside wall. You can also use a soft silicon spatula to stab things out of whisks instead of fingers. It's really helpful when making cookie dough/other dough to make sure everything gets incorporated. Your lazy susan thing is really cool, very glam :^)
Is it wrong to think when Ian made his entrance: “hmmmm, Ian’s awfully adept at spanking that steed. I wish I could g...” Ehhhh, you get the idea. Glad to have ya back Moosey! :)
I'm originally from Washington but have lived in Texas for twenty years. Seriously, go back to Washington.
Just subscribed and was sad that you havnt uploaded in a while, then you upload. Nice
Nice! You aren't dead. Thought you quit YT
When you realize brutalmoose was spanking himself. ._o
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks pretty good
One word.... DIABETIS
Yee (and I can not stress this enough) H A W !
Is Take 5 better than Crunc?
well, bless your heart
Please do all your videos in the future dressed like that. Thanks.
Cowboy Ian is the hero the SouthWest deserves.
You FOOL, you escaped Texas, why did you return?!
The editing is always amazing, I'm sure it must take a while to do, but it will never be unappreciated
The sprinkling was too intense for my soul.
The echoey kitchen really makes me feel like I'm in the old wild west ?? Hooray for the return of BrutalFoods and of Plop!
More brutalfoods
I’m Texan and I’m not too disappointed
The new kitchen looks a lot better on camera.
I think you did well!! Although I'm also a kitchen amateur so I have no idea what I'm doing as well :")
Puddin' without cookin'? Madness!
Good to see you're back Ian!
I missed you, Ian
When you say move back to Texas, did you buy a house or move in with your parents? That looks like your mom's kitchen.
As a fellow Texan, I'd like to give y'all a hearty yee-haw for another good video
Why do you even have this show when you clearly don't know how to cook?
Love the hair
As a Texan residing in the lovely state for nearly 2 decades I can confirm these dishes are indeed heccin Texan
One protip i have for your future chocolate melting endeavours: a double boiler To create a double boiler you add water to a saucepan, put it on a hob, and bring it to a gentle simmer. Then you put a heat-safe bowl on top and melt the chocolate in the bowl. It’s a little slower but also the chocolate has just about 0 risk of burning, and it’s easier to control if you need the chocolate at a specific temperature. Double boilers are also good for other more gentle heat-based tasks, like melting butter, mixing up some hollandaise sauce, making custards, etc.
Careful about feeding Plops. You don't want him making cow pies in the kitchen
YEEEEEEEEE HAW
I hope to see Plops return to us soon, bringing treats and recipes from across the globe...
I totally thought you were going to say I'll be dressing and talking like this from now on
My girlfriend doesn't like chocolate at all, so she would hate chocolate pudding XD
Love it! That Texas Yum Yum sure looks yum yum!
read dead 2 and a cowboy ian is making this the best weekend ever
So would you say that Cowboy Ian is a real BUCKAROO?
Thank you for the great captions!
One of the best parts of these videos is the cooking tips from the comment section
Sadly with that kitchen aid you do have to swipe the sides once in a while to help it mix everything. I think there's a part for the machine that does reach the sides though
the subtitles are funny, yet not goofy.
You’re an editing god
I lived in texas and and just moved to washington the irony
A half hour of brutalmoose to start the day? Hell yeah!
Jesus of Dallas, I love your editing!
Those bare Ian feet tho
Man the new gameplay for red dead redemption 2 looks great
I don't know anything about cooking, but this is probably my favourite series on YouTube.
The Netflix Adaptation of C.O.W-Boys Of Moo Mesa is heading in an unusual direction.
This is so trippy ?? i thought the background looked like a green screen
3 words. Yippee kay yee!
Ian you probably moved back to Texas the cheap McMansion sized houses
This editing is so great
Loving these edits so much :,D
I got way too excited when Ian rode in looking like the hippest cowboy
Why is there a Gluten free section?
Pretzels and Oreos? Yuck!
You know your eating some good desserts when you need some milk to wash it down with
I love the new cooking mechanics in Red Dead Redemption 2
So about the kitchen aid, if stuff gets stuck on the sides, just pause it, scrape it back from the sides and turn it on again, also, when microwaving chocolate or other melting thingies, its ok to do the 1 to 3 minutes, but every 30 seconds take it out and move it a bit with a spoon or alike, so the chocolates that are in the middle get moving and the ones on top/bottom/sides dont burn because of heat and pass that bad flavour to the rest of the mix
I expect more Cowboy Ian in the future
you might want to put your hair back in a ponytail while you cook or else hair might fall in your dish
Scrape the sides!
Is this that Red Dead Redemtion 2 everyone's talking about? Where do I buy??
Do you run a new kitchen factory, ian?
Plays Red Dead Redemption 2 for 5 minutes (*intro start*)
As a Texan resident I can confirm this is the only thing we ever eat
Honestly half of the fun in these videos is watching ian learn how to cook.
Not gonna lie I’m a big fan of Brutal Bull (your bull riding Texas persona) really hoping that costume gets some mileage!
A half hour, dessert themed, Brutalfoods on my birthday!? You're the best!
Finally a new video!
Looks tasty as hears Mariana sauce in the background oh god...
Would it canoblastic for Ian to eat moose?
That "Confectioners sugar" was Powdered not Confectioners.
I wonder what goes through Ian's head when he edits these videos...
I'm pretty sure "Folding" is meant to introduce as much air as possible into the frosting, making it much fluffier. To fold in an ingredient, instead of just mixing, pour your ingredient on top of the mixture, and just use a rubber bowl scraper and just scoop from the bottom and literally fold it over the new ingredient over and over. Hope this helps! Love the content man keep it up, def one of my fav creators!
Awesome new kitchen Ian!!
You mentioned Texas so I need to ask if you like Bowling for Soup
That's a cute dog.
Helpful tip! When using a stand up mixer use your rubber spatula to push the stuff that sticks to the side of the bowl back to where it can be mixed in with the rest of your mixture!
Another good vid, Ian! For what it's worth, I think when the bark called for toffee bits they probably meant something like a chorped up Heath bar.
To get material off the side in that kind of mixer you need to use a spatula to scrape things off the side intermittently while it mixes.
So I turned on the closed captioning today and didn't realize how they weren't automatically captioned. The closed captioning actually made the video even better and I totally recommend you guys give it a try if you haven't. Besides that, great video! <3
Having a kitchen aid mixer for you seems like an art student buying copic markers or something. Tools are great, but a lot of technique to learn. Love the brutal food videos.
Brilliant!
the greatest youtuber of all time is back! instant like
Real men eat pudding on a knife
Hey Moose, I recently bought this off brand slap chop for like $15 and its a lot better at breaking things up things like the toffee, since when I break up harder ingredients, the bag falls apart with it. Thought I'd share, and always good to see ya!
If I still lived in Dallas I'd be helping you out bro! Culinary degree here, give ya some pointers and such :)
You love salt, eh? :P Have you heard of NerdECrafter? XD
i have the CC on and at 3:26 that is like the farthest thing from gruff western music lol :p
I'm still watching but I keep thinking your bullfriend is going to knock something over.
Hey so is it canon that there is more than one Ian?
I want puddin' now.
Here's how to crush your nuts, for future reference; spread your nuts across a cutting board, take a small pot, and press the bottom side down on your nuts. Those nuts will be well crushed, guaranteed.
My oh my have mercy on me for givin' such a delight on the Lord's Day
I love the editing on these.
Use a cloth next time instead of a plastic bag, no risk of breaking :)
I audibly gasped when I got the notification
18:22 MANLY MUSCLES!
You actually need to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula so everything is properly mixed. Also, to fold something in, you put some of what you want to incorporate, take a spatula, scrape against the bottom and/or side of the bowl, and literally fold it into itself to gently mix everything in. Folding is good because it introduces more air, making it lighter.
Brutalfoods Food Lab sure looks like an ideal place to hide a body...
Omg I missed Ian's videos so much
I LOVE the salt
One hell of a kitchen upgrade, Ian! Congrats!
Wow, that’s literally the exact right technique to chop nuts that you displayed.
God I really love the cooking in the new red dead game
IAN YOUR KITCHEN IS ENORMOUS
That is the correct folding method if you are using an electric mixer. Otherwise, you could fold it in by hand using a rubber spatula to stir the whipped topping in. Also, if you scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, the cream cheese won't stick to the side like that.
Ian: Remember to use a microwave safe bowl. Me, hesitant to believe that bowl he’s using is microwave safe:
In this episode: Ian moves back to Texas, shortens a few feet, and obtains a flying bull.
Hey good job with tempering that chocolate it’s hard to get a good finish when your messing with the chocolate while it’s still hot like you do with bark. Love the videos Ian
I don’t live in Texas but I live in Alberta also known as Canada’s Texas so close enough right
I say we sub title this episode: Ian Rides Again. Also now I really want to watch you play Nancy Drew Secret of Shadow Ranch.
Wow an ad luckily I'm watching it on a ps4 haha
This red dead redemption 2 gameplay looks amazing
I had a feeling it was gonna be a good Sunday!
you thought all pretzels were glutton free?! ..... dude.... pretzels are bread.... you know.... wheat
i like the new house
Based on the thumbnail I was expecting this to be a video from "Tasty"... Boy was I taken off guard by the cowboy Ian...
Put nuts in a bag, smash them with a mallet or rolling pin. Think I might make both of these ....
Howdy! your editing is amazing!
You finally uploaded
my only complaint is that he didn't dip the bark in to the texas yum yum
13:00 with that music I thought you were in Mung Daal's kitchen
These videos and black tar heroine are the only things that get me through the day
?? Yehaw! ?? These two larfin desserts left me going “Mmm! Them sucker’s tasty!” ??
* cries in hank hill *
My baby sis and I are dying from your confusion with the Kitchenaid. You look like me and my confusion with children in general.
Those are Pathetic Recipes A FRITO PIE, that's a Man's Recipe
Your gonna need to fix the audio in the kitchen. Try putting some sound damping pads behind and around the camera/microphone
Living in Texas, I honestly hate the stigma placed on it of everyone being super country.??
I missed you so much
Oh no, he stole some poor confectioner's sugar again!
Plops is best stead.
That moment of Ian holding the plug was priceless. Also, Heath bars are toffee. Get Heath.
his accent gets more texan over the video. oh no
welcome back to Texas my friend
Folding is a technique where you attempt to not burst bubbles in delicate things like whipped cream and custards. You use a spatula to scrape the bottom and "fold" it over the second ingredient so that it won't lose it's volume and fluffy texture. But you're right, I agree it's funnier if you don't know that.
Scrotch
Well, yeehaw! I reckon those treats look pretty delectable, I tell you h'what.
People: Cowboys can't be sexy! Me: Shows them cowboy Ian.. Me: I bet y'all feeling pretty stupid now!
Wow, Red Dead 2 looks even better than I imagined.
YESSSS MORE BRUTAL FOODS!
Ian, I know you have a destructive side after seeing the Werther's massacre. It hurts me to see you try to cut bark instead of just smashing it
I love the commitment to the costume bit.
Mmmm, them suckers tasty!
The editing just makes everything perfect
Omg blame it on his roots, Ian showed up in boots and came back to Texas. Bluebell, Whataburger, and HEB missed you, bro. ??
Yeah... What's So Great About Dumb Old Texas?
ENGINEER
“Mmm! them sucker’s tasty!”
"You're doing amazing sweetie" - me and my sister losing our minds at your cooking antics.
5:40 It's not that hard. 5:52 Oh...
You're ment to whisk it mate, but good try.
Ian is an unlockable character in red dead
17:24 jazz pianist ian with his hit "i have not seen such bravery"
I was so happy to wake up to this. Ian cooking is like me, clueless with good intentions
Greetings from Brazil! Seeing cowboy Ian is a shining light of hope in this dark times. Maybe I'll even try making some "YumYum... Yums".
With things that get sharp when you break them, you can also cover them with a kitchen towel to keep them from going everywhere.
Here's a helpful bit of advice: when lining your baking sheet, take a stick of butter and rub the pan down with it before you put the paper on it - this will keep the parchment paper (I prefer wax paper) from popping out as it did.
CHORP CHORP YALL
12:05 Hint at making types of Buffalo Wing Sauce?
Even though I lived in Texas my whole and I'm Hispanic, I cannot relate to these treats Yum Yum
I think this is my new favorite BrutalFoods video.
Put the peanuts in a bag or bowl and smash 'em. Just a thought. Great music and sound effects btw! =)
I always find mixing cream cheese with my kitchen aid much easier when the block of cream cheese is cut into smaller pieces. Same goes with other things like blocks of butter, it just makes mixing easy and efficient. Great video as always by the way!
Every time you do anything I'm just worried you're going to blow something up
S N A C K P A C K S is my cb radio handle
I will literally never get tired of the "plop" sound clip
as someone who knows how to bake/cook there is a lot of "omg no" moments in this video but still pretty good nice job ian
Your house is so nice!!
Who else loves brutalfoods?
OH MY A BRUTALMOOSE VIDEO, THATS NEWS !
Man they actually look good.
ian, why is your clock not working :(
For the chopping, your hand placement was good but you need to roll the knife from end to end of the blade edge over the nuts instead of bringing it down on them. :) Edit - Also, you should chill the Texas yum yum to get the pudding and other layers to be more solid when you cut and serve.
I can't decide if a KitchenAid stand mixer is 1.) wasted on Ian, or is 2.) the only mixer capable of standing up to his abuse.
I'm under the impression this video was fun to make. lol
Ian "we're getting some stray confectioners sugar in here..." me: crying you're supposed to scrape the sides xD
We don’t deserve the amount of effort you put into these but we sure appreciate it!
Finally another brutalmoose videooooooooooo! I've been fucking waiting forever! Yesssssssssss#
I giggled as the "plop" caught me off guard.
How dare yee make funs of our home land
if u love old stuff so much then do a recipe from the first cookbook ever written by Apicicus
For the duration of this entire video, my thought process was "gee, I'm hungry. But I need to finish the video before I get lunch. Gee, I'm hungry."
your gorgeous hair has been distracting me the entire video. seriously what magic do you use in order for it to be so fluffy and shiny?
Ian makes such awkward cowboy. I love it!??
I love the theme
Boy howdy, I just hit some black gold, Texas tea.
Ian? not in an apartment kitchen? who IS this IMPOSTOR?
Yo take five is the BEST! Also please make Plops a series regular
Nice Red Dead Redemption 2 review
This video just made me want chocolate.
You actually wanted the paddle for the cream cheese step Paddle for beating, whisk for whipping.
2.57, looks like a bag of coke.
Ian criminally underuses his rubber spatula
its a bull, not a horse just saying.....
Your editing gets better and better with every video Ian. The music, the transitions, the splicing, the sound fx, the lighting, all that hard work you put into these videos SHOWS. Excellent job!
0/10 folding, it wasnt folding. Folding is basicly barely-mixing stuff in so its kinda combined but without much force used
hype as fuck for this ep
At mid intro: let's get married.
30 MEN IN MY FREEZER
Texxxxxas yeeeeees
Cruel Deer is back!!
Finally! A new Brutalmoose for me!
For a minute there I thought you'd had to move back in with your parents. And then you opened the fridge door at 2:22. I stand corrected.
Next brutal foods do super Texan beef recipes or tex mex.... But beef... RIP PLOPS
To fold a mixture, take a spatula or wooden spoon and slide it to the bottom of the mixing bowl. Try to scoop one end of the mixture over the other, like you're folding it in half. Repeat until your mixture is well incorporated.
Aw, no Killjoy 2 review for Halloween? Also, 2/10 folding in score- illegal use of mixer. Would be 0 but I appreciate the effort.
plop intensifies
One day Ian will run out of characters to play Oh who am I kidding?
Ian, remember I loved you before you had money
Read Dead Redemption 2 DLC gameplay (REAL) (COOKING) (GONE SEXUAL)
You live in Dallas? I live in Houston.
You get an F for Folding.
@16:28 Shoulda used a food processor Ian, woulda made it much easier
Texas Yum Yum sounds like a “special” massage.
Yeah, cool whip and cream cheese is basically the filling for a cheesecake, totally should have used thawed cool whip.
In the middle of a water fast and deputy moose came in to torture me.
Jesus Christ, Ian. This is amazing. ??
man, i'm a bad texan for neither having heard of or tasted texas yum yum in my 24 years of life
Moose, here's some good tips for knowing what type of attachment to use for your stand mixer!!: -The Whip attachment is best things that are more of a liquid consistency or for when you need to add air into something when it's mixing, such as with whipped cream. A lot of batters use the whip attachment. -The paddle is good for things that are thicker, such as frostings, or as you have here, softening things like cream cheese, butter, etc. Basically, if something would be REALLY REALLY difficult and annoying to get out of the holes on the whip attachment, go with the paddle. -The hook (which idk if you have) is for doughs, though some less dense doughs can be made using a paddle.
I wonder what kind of bottle that he always has is called.....
You folded wrong. Check one of 15000 videos or wiki How's. Basically, scrape around the outside of the bowl and do a kind 9f figure 8
the stars and stripes are big and bright
I fully expect you to have diabetes by the end of this
screams in triggered baker Cries in YEEHAWWWW
this has made my day, thank you ian :)
I've not seen such bravery
10 seconds in and this video is already outstanding. That first recipe looked so good! I think I'll try it sometime! I cant say this enough, I absolutely love your editing! :D
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks amazing
YES NEW BRUTALFOODS THANK YOU GOD
Is that footage of Dallas, Texas I see?
i am from thailand
Plops is displeased with your offering! ??
YEEEEEEEHAAAAAAWWW
Wow Ian... Didn't know you were from Texas... So am I... Ian from Texas...
you mixed it not folded it but sure. you do u papi moose
tell plops i'd die for him
answering ian's question and some tips - Scrape the sides of the mixers bowl with a spatula, so it all mixes homogeneously - You did not fold correctly, but i don't think it mattered for the recipe - Instead of cutting peanuts with a knife, crush them with a mortar and pestle, or put them inside a zip-lock bag and crush them with a hammer
I love you and hella missed you bud where you been?
0:33 Red Dead Redemption 2 early leaked footage (colorized)
What are you used to cream cheese to look like? In a container?
M8 if you want to fold something you gotta actually fold in with a spoon
NEW VIDEO!
ian i believe folding is usually meant to be done manually, perhaps with a rubber spatula
you can just use like a spatula or spoon or something to scrape down the sides every now and then to ensure maximum mixage.
You were in Washington this whole time
Can you pin this for miniscule reasons?
This editing brings me great joy. I love your work so much, Ian <3
You have to fold things in by hand with a spatula. It literally means fold the mixture over itself until it is just combined. Over mixing ruins the texture.
Man, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks amazing
dear god ian stop mixing things with a whisk you don't know what you're doing
Critical-ingredient-free is a crime.
Ian, with the mixer, you should've left the whisk head on and used a spatula like the one you used for the chocolate pudding to push out the cream cheese. Along with that, you should've pushed everything on the sides to the bottom so they could be incorportated. Also, folding in means you would take a spatula, put the whipped topping in, and gently fold the sides on top of the of the whipped topping. When you make a machine do it like you did, you're taking the air out of the mixture instead of letting the air be retained.
Everything’s bigger in Texas...even the kitchens!
With the mixer you're supposed to take a floppy spatula and push the sides down as it's mixing! :)
I had texas yum yum when i was in girl scouts many years ago, and it was amazing. I fell in love. I never found it anywhere else UNTIL NOW
Still effed up the folding part
It seems no one is saying it, that’s not folding
#peoplegettingreallymadatfood
'beat the cream cheese' Ian: ???whisk???
KKona Clap
It's the heart-attack tart
Thank you. Its good to focus on something else when stuff is going on in life. Keep it up Ian
SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOF TOPS
I'm not gonna lie, I initially did not like the format change. But now I want this on the Food Network
You did not fold in correctly, good guess though.
hell yes the moose is back!
“30 men in my freezer.” Umm... Ian...? Are you trying to confess something to us? lol
When using a stand mixer, ocassionally turn it off and use a spoon to scrape the sides down into the center.
Back in texas we call ice cream frozen cow juice
Y’all
Crushing the old man with the bowl really got me lmao
30 minute video 15 of it is spent fiddling with the mixer. UPDATE: The last 15 is spent in the Missing Sea Salt Chronicles
Wow! These graphics for Red Dead Redemption 2 are amazingly realistic!
CALL MOM FOR HELP
Ian, use a hair tie next time. You don't want your hair in your food.
Man... I envy that kitchen aid. Dems expensive
Guess who’s back, back again! Ian’s back, tell a friend!
[TRIUMPHANT WESTERN MUSIC]
Dang, Brutalfoods Kitchen 3.0 is MASSIVE, happy for ya Ian!
don't mess with Texas! I love this tho Bc I'm from Texas bahah
So excited that you're back ????
Ian, your videos are honestly amazing. Love watching them!
I hate chocolate pudding!!
yee (and I can not stress this enough) H A W
OH GAWD I WANNA BRAID IAN'S HAIR ??
New kitchen hype! I'll forever miss the old kitchen, but I'm interested in what this new kitchen will bring to the table.
Real cowboys only wear white socks
As someone that owns and uses a kitchen aid mixer literally every day, his struggle is painful to watch.
Who in the god damn tarnation disliked this video?
OMG I've been binging all your brutal food vids this week and there is a NEW ONE EYYY!
I live for your edits, Ian.
I like vertically split fridges more than horizontally split fridges
This is the only food related stuff that i follow on youtube.
Instead of a hammer, you can use a wooden spoon to beat the shit out of it instead ??
So if kitchen were Pokemon would this be the final form?
Good Texas fun...lmao
Is it bad that I forgot this channel existed?
How many times this mother fucker gonna move house?
Gotta say that’s the biggest thing of milk I’ve ever seen What in tarnation
Like if y'all from Texas
Why are you doing childrens programs, all of a sudden? Why has your focus shifted to "Bad Sesame Street"? Who IS your focus group? Tweens? Why are you making yourself look more stupid than you are? And why the fuck, are you trying out "ready made meals", when there is already 400+ people doing that? What happened to the games? Have you stopped playing? Did you find that making videos of games, was too boring? I am clearly not in your agegroup with these videos. Say goodbye, to your mature audience, and make sure you welcome the new ones. You know, those 12 year olds, that think you do something funny. It is not often you see a you-tuber, trying to switch out, his whole fan base for something younger... Oh, wait hang on, you see this all the time... Congratulations! You are now an extended after school service provider.. You must be proud, disowning your whole fanbase, in order for a new, more younger one... Hats off. You are just another asshole, trying to look after his "assets", without realising that you spit on your patreons and trusty followers. Great job. You are doing good. And you wonder why your channel is in decline? Why would a retro gamer, want to subscribe to a food channel of a retro gamer? Are you sick? Having a fever? Think Mcfly, think!
wowowowowoweeeee thanks
yeehaw! howdy?! (translation for all y'all city slickers: hello! how do you fare?)
Howdy boah
Last time i watch brutalmoose is in 1785
I went from listening to southern gothic to watching this.
Are you back in mom's house?
Is his horse plops a reference to Bob's Burgers or to himself?
I want Ian to tackle bread making
Yes. At last. Howdy-do.
I miss the can of Pringles on the fridge :(
Shout out to my boy Plops
I'll eat you for dessert IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
My mom thinks you are hilarious.
Nooooo I did not wake early enough to comment first!
I'm not clever enough to think of a funny joke referencing the video but BOOOOOOOOOWL
I really love these videos, keep up the awesome work Ian! ...and only because you asked, no, no that is not how you fold ingredients... also "heath bars" would have been a good toffee substitute.
I like the daily wear, Ian, but what are you going to be for Halloween?
You live in Dallas the most shat on city in Texas
red dead redemption 2 looks really good
Bless you Ian, keep doing what you do
Texas pies are TALL lol like they defy gravity so this is pretty correct actually
I trust one (1) man and that man is cowboy Ian and his trusty steed
The cycle is complete. Since January of 2013, I have waited for the return. We have seen whispers of it, but time after time, haircut after haircut, we have been japed and jostled. But no more. For we have finally done it. We have finally achieved... FULL LONG HAIR IAN ONCE MORE!
Keep Austin Weird, Ian!
W h y
Wait... Ian's from Texas???
PLOPS. I'M SCREAMING.
Look out Babish! Ian is going after your views >:3c
Good to hear a Texan is back home. Fort Worth represent.
The perfect thing to watch instead of starting my homework
You don't use the mixer to fold, folding is done to make sure the air that is incorporated into whipped cream and suvh isn't pushed out. You fold by literally folding the cream/egg whites into the mixture with your spatula.
I get genuinely excited when I see a notification for a new video from Ian
Thank god notifications for this channel still work
So glad it’s a 33 minutes video about pudding pops god bless you Ian god bless you
I’m supposed to be studying for a test tomorrow, but here I am.
Thank you Cowboy Ian. Very cool!
Yes more recipies!
Needs more ramen
As, a proper southern boy, who loves to cook, this entire video is offensive + all the puns included.
Yum yum!
This is so wack that you posted a food review video, I just subscribed to you last night because I found your lunchables review! Keep up them fine 'ol videos boy! Yeeeee-haw!
Woo Texas peeps, Where y’all at? Houston over here!
When the intro started I was thinking "now that's a Texas-sized kitchen" And then Ian said "I moved back to Texas" lol
Red dead 2 looks amazing
Tasty Texas Treats to Try This Thanksgiving That happens to land on a Thursday
i really like this change of videos
what a great birthday present. love ya texas ian
Change your channel name to BrutalBison
Why does Cowboy Ian have Dwarfism?
Literally having to restrain myself from not laughing so hard I die, this is gonna be fun
He's back, just as the prodigies said.
When they say folding they meant that you place the whipped topping on top of the confectionary sugar and cream cheese mix. Then with a spatula you fold the confectionary sugar and cream cheese mix over the whipped topping. This process is done so you can keep the fluffly lightness that the whip topping has, aswell as help the mixture hold its shape. Fokding would make the mixture almost spongey like. Although with this recipe I don't think it really matters. Anyways I love your videos! Tysm for making them ?? Also good luck in any other cooking/baking endeavors
Yesss a new vid
I like how this has just become a cooking channel now
Really good pacing in this show! New characters every video. Wonder how Ian is doing.
I ain't from Texas but this episode seems genuine
https://www.taste.com.au/baking/articles/how-to-fold-ingredients/bfczqmgw
I need smell-o-vision now for this video
You live in Texas and don’t shop at HEB?, this is a Disgrace for the Lone Star State
When folding you should have your rubber spatula and just lift and place until it's homogeneous. When you use the mixer your starting to over work your ingredients and changing the texture. But all that said it doesn't really matter so great job.
How did you know I was just binge watching the cooking videos and realised that no new videos were uploaded?
Yesterday we had Chad and Hammy and now we have Ian This is great
Is it me or does Ian look like Shawn Michaels
I love this halloween video.
Where did Little Ian go
i miss video games
Ian! im gonna Cum!
Ian you basically did the opposite of folding.
33 minutes and 52 seconds of my favorite series. #blessed
you and Brandi TV are the only wholesome youtube channels in existence. This video is amazing
Congratulations on the move, commiserations on the continued failure of your folding technique.
Also appropriate because Red Dead 2 is Finally Here!!! GG Ian
THE PERFECT HALLOWEEN VIDEO!!!!!!
Wow, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks really good!
I found myself hoping for a new BrutalFoods episode yesterday. Rewatched the Ramen episode.
yay. texas represent
It's been 1 month >:C
Yeehaw y'all
Welcome back to Texas! Glad to have ya here.
Probably the most diverse channel on YouTube at this point
Represent that State of Texas, BABY!! ????
I’m not sure if that was correct folding but you know what? I don’t think it mattered, frankly.
Half hour Brutal Foods. LETS DO THIS
I bet Ian a year and a half ago thought that this whole Brutalfoods thing was a funny one-off meme. Look at it now, it pretty much changed his whole channel and brought in so many new people; myself included
I've always wanted to go to Texas
It's BrutalFoods time once again ????
Just this morning I was wondering when there would be another brutal video. Right on time for dinner, too.
welcome back to hell
4:27 plop! ??
I got so excited when I saw this in my subscription feed! I love your videos! :)
Ian you make such great content. Please keep being awesome, and welcome back to Texas!!
Ian. I know you gettin those views, but you gotta stop with the brutal foods. I’m getting bored.
As the one in my house who uses the kitchen aid mixer the most, the part where you were trying to figure it out was both funny and painful (painful becuase i could be like "psst, Ian, push it up and then twist it"and such)??
oh boi
Scrape edges with Spatula then mix with machine again....easy :)
Hey first yee then haww
Grrrr Texas..... But this was pretty good
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
Why does this new kitchen look like the old kitchen but from a different angle
Cowboy Ian is my favourite character from Red Dead Redemption 2.
Fantastic! This pie looks like a better then sex cake also know as a sin cake. These are super Yum! Wishing you an amazing day dear friend x)
Best halloween ever, a new episode of brutalfoods and plenty of cakes to bake.
LOOK AT THAT KITCHEN
Oh yes! brutalmoose!
Yay! A moosical!
Yeehaw indeed
vote for beto ian
Ian must've sensed I was having a shit day, cuz a brutalfoods episode is just what I need lol By the way, just some friendly advice on how to fold things in from a fellow cook, use the rubber spatula to kind of lift the mixture up and cover the whipped topping with it, keep lifting and covering until it's mixed in :)
P L O P
I can’t decide whether I love or resent your content but either way I’m enjoying myself.
Hmm! Them Sucker's Tasty!
I love you Ian, I was just saying I wish you'd upload and you do
yee haw
I'm uh... I'm gonna pre, dude.
perfection
Think all that weird food has stumped your growth there buddy.
Everything is bigger in Texas
cowboy ian has some short legs
Trusty steed? I think you meant trusty steer. Regardless, it's always a treat to see more BrutalFoods, y'all...
yee haw
blessed
Texas yim yum
I have to unsub. Moose was once all about quality game and then movie reviews, and now he's just doing food stuff and less scripted reviews in general.
As a Texan I approve of this
Thanks dad
It’s so crazy to me when I find out that certain youtubers are from Texas cuz like.... I’m from Texas, I’m in Texas. That’s wild. Yeehaw indeed.
Good stuff
cowboy ian is gorgeous
So when are you actually going to change the channel's name to "brutalfoods"?
The perfect video for a Sunday morning in Alberta, which I’ve been told is the Texas of Canada
The hair is out of control lmao
as someone from Texas... ouch. you don't have to put so much emphasis on the howdy and y'all cmon Ian also ain't is just a word, no need to over do it
Red Dead 2 looks great.
I love you, Brutalmoose! ??????????????????
I’m low key hungry now and my parents have not shopped for groceries in weeks.
Wait, this isn't a rdr2 review?
Return of the PLOP!
Yeehaw, a new BrutalFoods! And a tasty, uhhhh, root-tootin' episode it is! EDIT: ~? S P R I N K L E T I M E ?~
YES
Man, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks so realistic.
Looking forward to a great video, BrutalMoose
Today on Brutalmoose: Ian makes pie til the cows come home.
Welcome back to Texas! Yee....haw?

OMG THIS NOTIF MADE ME CRY I LOVE THIS CHANNEL, THIS EDITING IS MY LIFE, NOTICE ME, SENPAI!
Good job on the new apartment Ian. I'm sure Tiny Ian paid some of the rent
Half an hour of video, four advertisement-blocks, I am satisfied.
The new place looks great! Hope you like it there Ian! Edit: Those look soooooo good
You better be cooking these with propane!
Brutal gets his video ideas from a random hat drawing
Mm them suckers tasty ??
Oh, freakin’ yeehaw brother
You don't have to be lonely, at farmersonly.com
Texan viewers, where y'all at?
They always say yeehaw but never ask haw yee
Fuck yeah! Just what I needed today a BrutalMoose vidyo!
Ye haw
There he is.
...O_O... dear God no..... 1:34
Bless you, Ian. These reviews/cooking demonstrations mixed with your comedy give me life ?? Please keep doing you, ‘partner’. Yee-haw!
TexasMoose
Who's watching this in 2016?
RDR2 looking good ngl
Oh heck yeah!!! BRUTALFOODS <3 Omgosh stop abusing that poor mixer. T.T Edit- You can save time with chopping peanuts and almonds by putting them between a couple of layers of paper towel and using a heavy skillet to crush them. :)
Yes! Another one! I’m so excited!
Ah Texas the America of mexico
You know this started as a pretty boring Sunday but Ian's video just made it better.
Texas. Full of Texassholes. Texas; stupid, poor, sick, Texas sucks dick.
I was literally just rewatching Brutal Foods, love ya Ian.
yeehaw bitch
Amazing
Brutalmoose can you be the yee to my haw?
imma texan, y'all
Oh Gosh the choice between you and the Eagles.....Imma pick you.
Witty & Interesting Social Commentary Regarding Texas
Howdy howdy
HELL YES AN UPLOAD BOYS
He got a new apartment. That's so awesome. Good job Ian.
Yeeh haw another round house kicken' video from my best pal cowboy Ian! Yal best be ready....
Smelly dog
You know the episode will be incredible after such intro.
I love you
im gonna Cum!
Brutalmoose’s channel is going through a midlife crisis. It doesn’t know what it wants to be lol
I just entered the video and Cowboy Ian already scares me
Hello lloooloooowefverfvetgherdcwdg
Whoever says cowboys aren’t sexy, I bet you feel stupid right now.
That was an odd intro...
10 seconds in and it's already going strong
17 seconds in and I'm already laughing my ass off
I came here at 18 views lol
“Mmm! Them suckers tasty!!” There you go moose man
Yeah, sure why not?
As a Texan, these better be marginally Texas-themed. Only marginally.
What a wonderful start to my morning
As soon as Cowboy Ian galloped in, I knew this was gonna be good.
Mmm... Desert.
What a fantastic treat for this gloomy sunday!
Good shit, daddy-o. This was straight up cash money
YESSS DAY=MADE
I wish I was that bull
Now for a greatly edited video for us to watch
Who are you and why I subbed you
dude i live for your videos
Hey I’m here and it’s 16 views and unlisted! Yo I’m early for once!!
Y E E H A W
Yessss he’s back!
Neigh.
Yay new brutalmoose!
Third
Early gang
Unlisted squad
Yesssss!!!! Finally!
thank god
Farst
Lets go brutal moose this is my favorite channel
She sounds like she has a cold or menstral cramps. I love the idea but don’t overwork your stars.
I want to try that ice cream
Is it me or does she give off a Kerry Washington vibe
Did Vikings have ice cream?
She sounds a bit like louise from bobs burgers
The most amazing thing about this is how the video ended up No.11 Trending. This girl seems pretty clueless and barely follows the recipes. Every other comment seems to love the video and the presenter so I guess I'm just a grouch, IDK?!
what music/song is this?
It said to boyle, boil, it.
That was the most beautiful ice cream maker Ive ever seen. Your voice, you beautiful face and hair. Wow!!
IM SUBBING TO WHOEVER LIKES THIS AND SUBSCRIBES TO ME????????????
Says they’re following a 350 year old recipe and immediately disregards the recipe...??
Man I don't think I've watched a tasty video this calm
Man Kiano's pretty ??
"This is definitely . . . a flavor." Great line!
Lol she added WAY too much of that orange “aromatherapy” ??
Taste test at 5:07
Wow the 2018 version of making ice cream
Sweetheart, 350 years ago you would have been a slave, not eating ice cream
We were watching the titanic during this
I like her! Keep using her!
i t i s a f l a v o r
i wonder howmany recepies from the past are lost and rediscovered in kitchen
I absolutely LOVE your voice!
SHE'S PRETTY!!
They still make this where I'm from
The title is nonsense.
You guys should do more of these. I love historical cooking stuff.
U so cute be mine if u can ??????
Well, ??
Unintentional ASMR
i think it's sad and pathetic how lazy america has gotten over the past 5 generations including myself, in today's generation we call people to up to deliver are food and i'm not saying there's something wrong with that but if your calling romeo's pizza, chicken wings, papa john's pizza, pizza hut, or calling people up to deliver your grunola candy bars and potato chips pumpkin pie chicken fry don't you try to lie because i can see it in your eye then roger we have a problem
Wouldn’t be melted by then?
You do realize that using a 350 year old recipe doesn't make your final product 350 years old, right?
I just clicked cause she is hot
Ice cream recipe she added a ton more of spices per her liking? Doesnt make sense or hold true to the original recipe.
There’s a third recipe which calls for ambergris!
so they have ice already in the 17th century?
My dads getting me McDonald’s rn
MMMMMM I know something looks creamy and it's not the ice cream. You sexy lady.
New favorite tasty producer???
She looks like the Scandal actress ??
Ok the ice crem is good but.. no ones is gonna mention how FINE AND CUTE IS MATT ?????? like helloooo ???
Lol... Not true the story is fake
What people haven't been around that long.
Amazing recipe and more healthy .
3:15 her reaction is awesome??
She is hella damn fine.
Just because I am too lazy to try it myself, you guys should try making very old candy recipes. Example: Molasses candy from around the Civil War :)
Bogus. You didn't actually follow that recipe..
I only clicked for the beautiful black woman stayed for the surprisingly interesting video.
Yay more kianooooo!!
Next video:We tried making quality content.
I thought the ice cream was 350 years old
she added a lot of orange flower water so it went down hill from there so be cautious with the flavors you use
who else thought the ice cream was 350 years old but then read the title and was like oh ??
Roses are red, violets are blue, this is on trending, wtf YouTube!
She is adorable!! I could watch her try food for hours..
She pretty much changed the recipe right off the bat ?????
1:30 this is how you know this is a Tasty video
?????????????????????????
Lol that 3 hours felt like 350 years of work
Love your videos! My fiancé and I also make videos!
T H E B R O A R M Y N E E D S Y O U ! Enlist by subscribing to PewDiePie! Help us win against the tyranny of T-series!
Yes! More vintage and old recipes videos pls!!! Really curious about how food in the past tasted like.
Man, there is something about her...
It was supposed to be mixed occasionally. That helps with even cooling.
I want to try this but then I’m scared that I’m going to mess up my kitchen...
Malk
Click bait kinda
Kinao. goddamn.lord help me
Her skin is so beautiful it’s glowing ??
dies of polio
I have a question though...How did they get ice if there's no refrigeration?
Please stick with people who could follow recipes, as well as cook.. ????????????
?? you’re not following the recipe.. you’re making your own with her ingredients. so much for following the recipe, maybe that’s why didn’t turn out. maybe that’s why the title says (tried to) but she didn’t try! at all.. you just ran with it because why?? yes we all know..

Get a life stop thinking ppl are idiots..... Those ingredients ... Give me a break....lucky they had freezers lol. When did they had vanilla. Haha cmon. Get a life....don't pretend u can cook !!!!
What a beautiful host??
You sound like a dumb bitch
Each like I will add an ice cream ??
I actually like making food from scratch and enjoyed this video and history...
Who else felt that in their ear 4:13
Did anyone crave ice cream after this.
I’m so stupid. I actually thought the ice cream was really 350 years old... slaps neck
You see that Brit.. My Blade Of Mace was better than your cream of orange poop.
10 mill subs and i dont even know of it
Who thought the title said "350 year old lady trys ice cream"
Where she found ice from? 350 years ago **no freezers**
Time and money equals interesting video experiment maybe I'll try it??????
Directions unclear, Anal bleeding won't stop.
Where did they get the recipe from ?
“It’s nasty” lol
?? ?? ???? ?? ??a? ??? ?a? a ?a?? fa¢???
Kiano fine asl. ??
I love Kiano's voice.
If they didn't have a fridge how did they make the ice for ice cream to 'chill'
I thought the ingredients were three hundred and fifty years old
Yum
Omg
Kiano rocks! Natural, funny and accessible. 5:36-5:48 was a pretty funny reaction.
i could listen to her talk all day long, her voice is so calming ?
Love it
You sir or ma'am just earned yourself a new subscriber
I really like Kiano and I really love the idea of trying old recipes. Would love more!
I LOVE HER
Does it piss anyone off how she said 17th century so about 1650 then yhe producer said 16th so 1550 and then in the title its 350 2000-300= 1700 1700-50 1650? So it it 1650 or 1550 or are the editor's stupid
Another quarter cup will never hurt. ... In most situations
Stretchy ice cream next!
How could you name it a 350-years-old ice cream when you just need 6 minutes and 34 seconds to serve it? jk
her personality is so calm and non-buzzfeed i am Shocked
No refrigerator... but has Ice?
I was misleaded by the title
Make 350 year old whiskey or wine and Ill be impressed..
Slave labor also degraded over the years.
You didn't follow the recipe.
Wow
I love me some BlAcK ChOcoLatE
is she coping Inda?
I'm tempted about that blade of mace ice cream wow looks tasty
When she said that there is no refrigerator was used I was a little confused when she also said ice. I thought when you make ice you use a refrigirator
Tries to make ice cream from old recipe. Immediately changes recipe with first ingredient

she sounds like scarlett johanson
More old recipes please. This is so fascinating.
Orange flower water tastes good in small quantities and if you take it more it tastes like soap...... It should be carefully handled
It would have been less icy if you churned a few times during the hours it was freezing. Just mix it up so that it freezes more evenly and with smaller crystals for a smoother texture. I've made ice cream without a machine, just with two mixing bowls, salt, ice, a whisk, and a freezer. I know people like ice cream in the summer, but if you had only primitive means it would be very easy to make ice cream outdoors during winter in a very cold place. If I lived in the arctic I would definitely try it and it might be better than a cheap ice cream machine if the temperature is low enough. At -40° you probably just need to whisk the chilled ice cream base in a bowl for a few minutes at the most and you have excellent really smooth and creamy ice cream, not icy at all. Then you warm up indoors and when you're warm and toasty you fetch the ice cream just outside (or in the freezer) and enjoy it.
Yum ??
Am I the only one who thinks she’s sexy
Lmao. "It is differently a flavor".
SHE. SO. CUTE
If there is no refrigerator, how can they make ice??
"We tried to make a 350 year old ice cream recipe" wouldn't it be better to phrase it more like for example "we tried to make ice cream using a 350 year old recipe" or "we tried to make 350 year old ice cream" ?
Why did you put “attempted” and “tried” because you wouldn’t have a video if you didn’t accomplish it
no one died in the west during the production of this ice cream......
so mr burns is older than 350 years.....sides maybe being satan LOL
The whole time she kept gradually adding more and more orange flower water I was yelling 'Nooo dont do it you will regret it!' That stuff is deceptively strong the longer its in something the flavor will penetrate. That shit needs to be used sparingly.
Entertaining I enjoyed this...
Can't help fallin in love with Kiano
Lightweight
Subscribe to Pewdiepie, guys let's do it!
There was white sugar in 1600’s ?
Her great great great great aunts probably prepared that ice cream for countless generation of white people....still using niggas to prepare it. What’s a shame. It’s ok my cousins are still Beheading each other back home
Ooohhh?? I'm pretty sure Patrick Star wants this IICEE CREEAAMMM!! ??????
it's true? ice cream recipi are 350 year old.
Wait if there were no refrigerators back then, how would they even have ice ??
A 350-year-old recipe and a 350-year-old ice-cream (which is what the thumbnail showed) are two different things.
Where did people from 1650 get ice from hahaha
Please make a mordern version of both of these ice creams! Kiano you're so cute!
THANK GOD FOR ICE CREAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMM!!!! :D
Not sure who this lady is, but if she doesn't know orange blossom extract she can't be much of a cook. It is very common in Middle Eastern cusine and also in Western confectionery. It is true the recipes of those days were not too precise for our present standards, but when the recipe does give instructions (as in the ammount of mace blade) she "knows better". Very annoying video.
She cute
So how did they make ice in the 1600's ?
The real oldest ice cream is when our ancestors spilled milk cream and sugar into ice on the floor
Do an old Cake recipe next
Why you are so cute!
no, its not what the taste like.. u already changed it in the early of the video
i love her voice its so calm??
HowToBasic's Classic Recipe Gone Wrong
The 1660s IS THE 17TH CENTURY no * needed.
I didn't know ice cream was even available back then! This is wild ??
More of her please!
I see people making recipes and opening beverages from the past, but why noone does the same for the future? I want you to make stake a-la Mars and open a wine bottle from 2630
Another way to make a 350 y.o ice cream: Step:1 make ice cream Step:2 leave it for 350 years boom 350 y.o ice cream
Please attempt other old recipes so fun
Bitch didn’t even follow the recipe fully
I would try to get some orange flavoring or extract instead of the orange flower water.
"It is definitely...a flavor..."
Ok. Did you know that making ice creams in the old days have no measuring they just. Boom bam boom just PUT ALL OF IT.
pretty black woman always helps with food porn lol! :D
I'm here from trending videos on YouTube
Ha! Never knew it's called 'mace'. It tastes super good when being sweetened. Spicy almost chili, plus crunchy.
I think the orange flower water recipe would taste good if she followed the right measurements for the recipe..
Where did they get the ice from? 350 years ago
????????????
she burned the spoon
You didn’t make the recipe.
the years make no sense
This looks so amazing and so much fun. Curious about how it taste
#13 on trending! Congrats!
Are you guys going to continue making old recipe's video?
You are very beautiful
You put too much orange flower water
I can't say that this would hold up to modern standards. WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE POURED A MOTHER FUCKING SHIT TON OF THE ORANGE WATER
I'm wondering how they made ice back then.
If there were no freezers back in the 17th Century, how do they make Ice for the ice creams? Do they export them from Antarctica
I love the way this producer explains everything and makes such good educated guesses and is good at problem solving. I want to make this mace ice cream, but with almond or soy milk!
Hate to say it.. But due to breeding and genetics and general improvements to agriculture. Chances are this taste nothing like it did back then. Kind of like how chickens back then were drastically different. That said it's cool you found such an old recipe.
Fun fact: Salt does not lower waters freezing point, it changes the chemical from H2O to H2O with NaCl or saltwater which is what has a lower freezing point, not lowering the freezing point of water
X for doubt
Okay so you learn something new every day. I was sure ice cream, wasn't a thing until the like 30s or something. How did they even make ice in the 1600s is what I want to know.
who else thought the ice cream was 350 years.... just me okay
It’s probably because you used so much of that orange rose water. As the saying goes, “A little goes a long way.”
how the hell did she find this recipe?
i like her
if they didn’t have refrigerators in the 1600s how did they make ice, from snow?
She has a little bit of that Miley Cyrus raspiness in her voice.
They should’ve waited 6 more tears to make this video
She sounds exactly like IVANKA TRUMP...same voice.
The nut meg
I read this wrong and thought she ate 350 year old ice cream
No se si el helado está rico pero...que hermosa por dios!!!!
Check me out https://youtu.be/tcMAvxbsJ3M
I'm so stupid - I almost thought the ice cream was literally 350 years old;;;
She looks tasty.
Check it out! Prep! https://youtu.be/Q7yMo9Qfaig
I love her ??
mmmmm tasty 'cough cough'
I would love to read recipes from way back in the day with the beautiful hand written notes. I love all those pretty food blogs but there is just something special about someone writing recipes and scribbling things out after they revise it. ??
Marry me

I want to see jayden play fortnite btw great vid
*Recipe calls for 1 blade of mace. Woman uses 4 instead. * Don't tell me you're following a recipe when you're not!!!!
(Scratching my head) she said less is more with adding sugar but went in on the orange water smh ????? duh ?? it’s going to taste nasty.
This is excellent! I could watch endless videos with Kiano making recipes!!!
Who do you know how a bar of soap taste like ???
Wow..... We Can't Believe It That Old Recipes Ice Cream Was Back To Era 2010's Even Not Too Popular
To truly recreate it you would have had to use raw milk straight out the cow no processing but it was so cool video
Salt raises waters freezing point. It doesn’t lower it...
My finger was really close to the like button so I clicked it
Orange flower water ice cream should be called bar of soap ice cream
Whoever that invented the ice cream... is a KING. Here to express my love for ice cream: - My username. - I did a speech on ice cream in 8th grade English. - I eat ice cream cake every year on my birthday. - There's always a box of ice cream in the fridge. - Every time we play Kahoot (online game), my username would be IceCream777. I love you King Tang of Shang (creator of ice cream)
Awesome
"it feels cold but it's just sitting there" what does she think happens in a freezer??
Please try doing more old recipes!
If there was no refigerators back then, HOW DID THEY GET ICE?
8
Kiano omg ??
Kiano is so cute
5:39 OwO
Was there any ice cream 350 year ago
You should make the ice move or shake your bucket ,thats make the ice cream fast freeze, thats how my country make traditional ice cream , you should put a lot of salt and shake it. Believe me
Shes cute... People in tasty always this cute?
So there were no refrigerators back then right...so where did they source their ice...from glaciers?
So I first thought the I itself was 150 years old and then I realized they meant the recipe
Voice doesn't match her body
Make this a series!!
A taste of Vanilla extract alone is more delicious than a taste of cheap tequila.
I love butterscotch nd chocobar one of my favorite ice cream
"its definitely......... a flavor" LMAO
I want more videos made by this beautiful melanin women
I'm 300,769th!
I love violet blueberry flavored ice cream and rose strawberry ?? floral is an acquired taste ?? but then so is perfume
Interesting...I like the way you made commentary about the ice cream as you were making it!
OMG I DID THIS IN 3rd IM IN 4th NOW I MADE A RECIPE FROM THE 17th CENTERURAY!!!111
How do they make ice in the 1660s?
So beautiful ??
Mace is to me what makes pound cake taste like pound cake. My mom's recipe uses ground mace and vanilla. Yum
This is just a copy of ‘How to cook that’
Am I the only one who thought this said "We Tried 350-Year-Old Ice Cream"?
Ice cream are not innovated since 350 years ago,so fuck off beach
This should be a series,old recipes
if 1600's peoples watch this, they would be like "THATS NOT HOW YOU MAKE THATTT"
What’s the point if you’re not even going to follow the correct recipe?
Kiano is so chill
why does she remind me of dojo cat
I feel like it really isn’t trying the recipe since she added more blade of mace then what you should add.
Nice
i love her
She cute
you did not even follow the recipe from the very start.
Did they have freezers back then? Cos how would they make the ice?
i love love love kiano! more please <3
Why isn't Rie in this video?????? This is bullshit.
This was so cool! I would love to see more videos of recreating old recipes!
Sweet
We did this is intermediate when I was little, but we had a bag with ice and salt and we put the ice cream mixture in a smaller bag then we sealed the bag and put that bag in the ice bag shook the ice bag and around 10 minutes later we had ice cream
Why did she use plastic spoons at the end. No need really
You completely changed the amount of flavoring in the recipe so, no, you didn't make the recipe. Probably best to say that judgment should be reserved for the original.
In 1660s, how did they obtain ice? Was this made in winter season?
Kiano is so smart!
This was northish right? Cause how did they had the ice?
Is she new? I love her already!
When I saw the title of this video I thought to my self "Well it would be expired"
I REALLY like her!! Please more videos with her, this is a refreshing tasty video :)
you added way too much orange flower water.
WHAT A DISGRACE I JUST GOT CLICKED BAITED SHE PUT 3 BLADE EXCEPT 1
Hope you guys find more antique recipes!
People are totally eating perfume ice cream (rose, lavender)
she’s so pretty omg
I love how calm Kiano is I need a video explaining her tips and tricks to attaining that composure??
Does anyone else watch these when you're hungry, because you're too lazy to actually get up and eat?
You guys should try rose water instead! ????
Nasty ??????

ICE CREAM RECIPE OLD AS WAKONDA
I love you so much Omg aaaaaaaaa
Orange flower is delicious
You can put it in but you can’t take it out. -kiano You are very wise Kiano
OMG i love her, we need more
Nice click bait, fucking reported
She’s so well spoken. I love it
Wait ?? If there is no refrigerators how is there ice ??
She acts like she’s never made homemade ice cream before. ??
that holy moly at the beginning sounded like "chuj mój", which in polish means "my dick" that was the first thing that came to my mind i'm so sorry kiano
i love this
This was a great change of pace. The straightforward, deferential, sincere delivery was so refreshing and made for a very pleasant, even soothing viewing experience. Great job, Kiano! (Btw, your skin is da bomb! Absolutely gorgeous girl!) I've gotten so used to content makers being cheeky, sarcastic, and flippant when trying or introducing history or old material. That''s not to say that this approach can't be effective, but it is only so when the content creators are (or at least appear to be) very knowledgeable and intelligent about the subject. Unfortunately, very few content creators (for some reason) take the time or effort to do this. Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara are some of the few examples I can think of who can pull this off. Probably because deep down inside Shane is a respectful person and takes it seriously. Only throwing in jokes when it seems appropriate (and never out of ignorance). Which is why they achieved a great amount of success while still remaining at Buzzfeed.
Looks pretty good for a 350 years old ice cream
the lady who created ice-cream is a geniuss!!!
Please make more "eating your feed"
That’s what she said
Lol I love this I love ice cream too!!
I thought this said we tried to eat icecream from 350 years ago not make it sooo.... This is nice ??
I would love to see more Kiano vids!!
if theres no refrigeration back then, how'd they make the ice?
?????? ??? .. ????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? " ???? ??? "
Orange blossom water is delicious! It's used everywhere in Arabic pastries
I have a question. How did they get ice in that time. I may just be dumb.
She took WAY TOO MUCH of the Orange water. You don't have to go to culinary school to know that you use spices and flavours very carefully.
try making stretchy ice cream!
I hit the e-e red botton
I love her voice it's so relaxing lol
She's annoying. ??
I love her voice
Orange flower is very strong and not pleasant on its own
She’s cool
Orange flower water is to be added without caution lol, it tastes good when you put "a lot" It's like sugar..?? I mean you don't treat it like vanilla extract .. you can be free
How dis they do ice ??
Sooooo she made ice cream??
Wait a minute... How did they get ice 350 years ago if they didn't have freezers?
Well you just ruined a good old recipe, by doing it in the wrong way of making manual ice cream..
This is useless if you didn't know the exact measurements. They're not the 'replica' of anything.
For some reason I thought you guys were going to try 350-year-old ice cream ??????
0:20 1660 is the 17th century tho?
They changed the recipe and the steps quite a bit
Kiano's voice is making me sleepy I love her.
Thanks!You are sweet! Can you write recipe?
Did she put the ice bucket into a freezer or room temperature ?
I love how calmed yet interesting you are
How did they get ice cubes if there wasn't a freezer then
They had plastic wrapper 350 years ago?
Ice cream be like :"I never freeze" 4:32
Clickbait, the ice cream itself isn't 350 years old
Nothing beats my 2,000 year old boiled rice recipe. Everyone should try it!
she added a quarter cup wtf
Water evaporates, so you don't put orange flower water in when the rest of the mix is hot. You put it in at the last second. Look up any middle eastern/Mediterranean/south Asian recipe for desert that uses it. Same goes for Blades of Mace. I like Tasty's concept, I really do, but y'all need to do your research if you wanna do these videos.
Pretty girl. I like that hairstyle and your lipgloss.
Where is rie?
I like the producer's presentation <3 ! Such a nice and chill lady ! Really liked watching this, as for making it haha... Dunno...takes too long.
Really love the video effects along with the speeches lol
I I l I lo I lov I love I love t I love ta I love tas I love tast I love tasty I love tasty s I love tasty so I love tasty so f I love tasty so fl I love tasty so fli I love tasty so flip I love tasty so flipp I love tasty so flippi I love tasty so flippin I love tasty so flipping I love tasty so flippin
Till nowadays Ice cream in the Middle East has those flavours+ pistachios + melted Arabian gum, and it's called: Bouza, sold traditionally in shops and street vans.
But where did they got the ice from???
They didnt have mechanical stoves or wraping paper or anything you used so I dont think it taste the same
C'mon Tasty, what's with that clickbait thumbnail (not title). You guys are better than that
I’m eating ice cream rn
writes down recipe goes to church 350 year old recipe!
Kiano vs rie
Wow...using a oldy goldy recipe to prepare ice cream is absolutely stunning!!
She has great camera presence.
Remy Ma raps ??& cooks ????
If there was no fridges back then, how did they made ice for ice cream? ?? IM CONFUSION
Did people have electricity 350 years ago?
Love Kiano and her videos??
Amm I'm a kid and I have a question how could they make ice cream back then if they did not have refrigerators to make ice unless they were from the artic and again Shiping it would not work it would melt but love the video
More of this kind of video please :) She is just so amazing!!
Kiano is the cutest she’s just so adorable
In the 1600s how the hell was there ice present if there weren't refrigerators .... that seems made up
But how did they make the ice if they had no refrigeration!?!?
How did the Lady get ice if there was no freezer 350 years ago? Did they make ice cream in winter?
We tried using a 350 year ice cream recipe
dang! I wonder how that recipe is still here (considering it went through 350 years...)
We did this when I was grade 4
Did anyone else think it was cheese ??
I love watching Kiano
Wait, how did they make ice 350 years ago? Why couldn't they make ice cream in the same way...
Her voice is so soothing
kiano is so chill and lovely omg
KIANO IS SO CUTE OMG
May be instead of plastic wrap on the top, go for aluminum foil and a shallower dish so that the top foil is in contact with the custard
she is so well-spoken i love it
You should provide the citation to the manuscript where you found these recipes.
Who would have this much cream at hand
bro i love her personality :b
Her skepticism tells me she's not familiar with old fashioned ice cream churns that use ice and rock salt to freeze the ice cream mixture. My mother grew up with a hand crank model, which is why she bought an motorized model for when I was growing up. Good times! Granted, you're not likely to get a hard set on your ice cream without a modern freezer, but you can get something firmer than a soft serve consistency.
Nice voice.
Lol an add for tasty came on right before this
You should make stretchy ice cream!
350 year old recipe? Sheesh. Back in the good old days where they had to do everything the hard way. I can't even imagine.
Try to make s t r e t c h y ice cream
IF THERE WAS NO REFRIGERATOR IN 17 th CENTURY THEN FROM WHERE DID ICE COME ???. .....Illuminati background music.........
You poured way too much Orange Flower Water to your cream! That is why it tasted so bad.
I just want to reach through the screen and eat it
????????????
dOn'T fOrGeT tHe OlIvEs!
the idiot didn’t even follow the recipe
I am sorry to ask the wrong question in wrong suitation can you please tell me you foundation shade please?
More historical recipes please, Tasty! (Also maybe consult with a food historian?)
It reminds me of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.
Such a soothing and calm voice ! This video was relaxing and entertaining
Can you make strechy ice cream that would be cool if u did
Where did they get the ice though?
WAIT SO PEOPLE HAS TO EAT ICE CREAM WHEN IT WAS COLD 350 YEARS AGO??? it couldn't be a refreshing summer treat because of the lack of refrigeration... I'm shook
lol i didnt notice i was eating a mcflurry while watching this video????
Damn she is so chill !
An ice cream recipe from the 17th century... Yes please! This is amazing.
Kiano is cooool so great that the first recipe I see her do is ... ice cream !!! :D
Watch my channel video ?? https://youtu.be/l0X2NetU7r0 (Making Slime With Funny Balloons Most Satisfying Slime Video)
I thought we used to use snow and vanilla and mix it together to make ice cream
Your honestly so fucking stupid you didn’t even follow the recipe dumb hoe no wonder it tasted like ass smh maybe if you weren’t barred out on Xanax it would’ve worked
it is just amazing
I thought you aged ice cream for 350 years lol
If you don't have fridge in that era, how do you manage to get ice(unless you get it from the nature)??
This chick is straight ?? ?? ??
I am very hungry for ice cream Now
I'm sorry but I'm triggered by the quality of the video
She's so cute
Tons of things like this on James Townson YouTube channel. They had someone making parmesan ice cream. And of course the 1700's fried chicken episode.
They must have had a lot of trouble storing the ice cream 350 years ago.
Different people got different tastes
That ice cream would be expired, I think.
Of cause it does not taste good. She used way to much Orange flower water. She also added more than twice the amount of Blade of mace as the recipe said. She did not whip it, And no ice cream is not ready after 2 hours on ice. It need a lot more time and you need to steer it from time to time, so it does not crystallize. Did she know nothing at all about making ice before she began? What she made is a basic old fashioned ice cream as it is still made today by many. Myself included. She just did it wrong from point a to z Ice cream maker/machine is not necessary when made right
Kiano has the most beautiful skin I've ever seen
Where did they get the ice?
Wait.. If she said 350 years ago dont have refrigerator to freeze the Ice cream, then where the heck 350 years ago people get the ice from???
She has a cute face.
How did they have ice without refrigeration 350 years ago?
Ok, so we got our recipe. Now lets just go ahead and throw that away. Im gonna do it so that it wont represent the original recipe. So what did ice cream taste like then? I have no idea, this is just a bowl of random ingrediant amounts. Probably should have done more research.
That's an amazing idea. Make more of these videos.
If 350 years ago there were no freezers how they made ice ?
i think you should put salt on top of the ice to speed up the project
more kiano pls
That's right stick it to the slave masters ghost!!!! We eating ur recipe now ????
Doesn’t she look like remy ma???
I have a doubt....if they had no refrigerators then...how did they make ice to chill the ice cream??
Would like to see more videos of making stuff from really old recipes.
what is the difference between milk and cream?
She is so beautiful :)
Damn it, Kiano is always looking gorgeous!! I wish I could marry her!
wow.. i literally thought for a second that the icecream itself was 350 years old... I'm so dumb...????????
I like her coz she doesn't give fak about anything
Please use this girl more often in Tasty videos, she's lovely!
good video .......YESSS.??????????????????
Don’t call it following a recipe if you don’t actually follow the recipe
Lol
I made ice cream the old fashioned way before...we churned it by hand... took me almost an hour. Even at 9 yrs old I was like not worth my time lol
i love her so much
did they have plastic wrap even in the 1600 ??
Where did you find ice in 17th century
Where did you find ice?
Immediately clicked when I saw Kiano! Your videos are always so creative, but also super soothing haha (To the editors or whomever, is there anyway the ending of the video could not be blocked by two big Watch More boxes? It ruins the end of the video, every time.)
sentren centry 0:24
Haha I’d just go to the market and buy some ?? ??
This sort of thing makes me embarrassed to be a millennial. It's not amazing that it "holds up so well", because this is a common way to make ice-cream--people were using essentially this method to make ice-cream at home just a few decades ago. She used four times the amount of mace in the first recipe and 15 times the amount of orange water in the second recipe, and then remarks that it's too strong! It's a little sad that they don't know the flavour changes as the mixture cools, but it's sadder that they judge the original recipe based on the results of their borked version.
It should be noted that we are used to stronger flavors and artificial flavors, so they'd probably use less of the ingredients to taste the flavor...
Wait if people didn't have refrigerator back in the days how did they obtain their ice???
Lololololo
But how the ice got iced
She said they didnt have a fridge
I hate it wen idk what to comment !
Damn Kiano you are sexy as hell ??????
I make Bread & Butter Pudding every now and then and sometimes add either a bit of orange flower water or Cointreau. For both a little goes a long way as they develop after a few hours.
96th comment (this is stupid)
How was ice made without freezers
Did you just add salt to lower the temperature? That's not how thermodynamics work. Sigh.
Step 1: make ice cream Step 2: wait 350 years Step 3: eat
actually.....salt increases the freezing point
Best and most calm video from tasty I’ve ever seen
The thumbnail makes it seem like the ice cream's 350 years old...
I like her
Orange blossom water is popular in north africa, I love it!
Heh hee most certainly ice cream machine or least a freezer nowadays is needed. :D
She looks like Doja Cat so much omg
Tasty never stop copying others
Christmas time has Cinnamon ice cream that’s almost to die for. SO GOOD. The “blade of mace” ice cream reminds me of that a little bit.
Funny...my name is keanu. Pronounced like (kee-ahh-new)
Hi Guyyyyyyssses I Love This Channel So Much???????? I’m Subbing Everyone In The Next 30 Minutes?????? If You Like This Post?? Comment Done? So I Know To Sub Your Channel?? And Sub Back I’m Doing Everyone....GO??
Fun fact, 350 years ago, people get their ice from ice merchants, who gets their ice from ice miners who lives in colder areas closer to the poles. So people were using ice that was taken from lakes and rivers, brought in by a ship, sold in big blocks and stored in an ice shed. Having ice in their drink and eating ice cold desserts is a sign of wealth, because ice was a rare item.
She reminds me of a black version of the girl from last man on earth
The most calm video ever
When you little sister got a birthday cake but no ice cream. ????
Who else thought they were gonna eat a 350 year old ice cream
I hope you do more videos like that, you are very charismatic :) I wanna try this recipe
330TH COMMENT ~Rox
No refrigeration, but plastic wrap is fine.
MAKE STRETCHY ICE CREAM.
She's a real cutie would love to see more of her and listening to her sweet voice. The ice cream looks good too.
Her skin tone??
If back in the day they didn’t have refrigerators and used ice, then how did they make the ice??
Kiano is just so pretty omg
Kiano ??your voice is like alluring me in drugs, you are making me sleepy... <3 <3 <3
I would have appreciated it if you would have religiously followed the original recipe rather than modify the ingredients; so basically you made a new recipe and no longer the 350 year old recipe.
This is the kind of video i like
How did they freeze things 350 years ago?
Probably the calmest person on Tasty :/ (well and Rie!)
i thought they were gonna age the ice cream for 350 yrs.............im so smart!!!! ;)
It's not good, because you kept adding the flavor, more and more!
I think a better title would be: Trying Out A 350-Year-Old Ice Cream Recipe
Very nice
Wow, y'all waited 350 years to eat this?
Heyyyy Kiano??
Matt!
ok but like where did they get the ice from back then?!?!?!?!?
How did they get ice in the summer and how did they keep it like what if she made a lot and she only made it for her (accidentally)
Is it an American recipe? Then bravo for realism.
I like this series. I hope you do more old recipes!
how did they make ice back then?
I think if she didn’t put too much orange flower water it would’ve just been a hint of it
Yum??
Millions of people will watch this, only a few hundred will make it and a few dozen will get it right.
She kinda remind me of Miley Cyrus??
Where would they get ice in the 1600s? Unless it’s winter time I guess.
But did she really follow the recipe? It seems like she was doing a lot of it to taste but what did the recipe say about the flower water?
Tell me this doesn’t sound like Selena Gomez
Let me guess its booza Edit: ok nvm
if im early do i get a heart?
Omg
People of the old era were really interesting. Both flavors speak for it.
My outer edge has melted solid. What!?!?
But my inside is completely liquid. (Wink)
Please do it again.
I am early
I like her ??
kiano and rie are the most iconic chefs
i love this woman
There's just so many things in this videos. How the hell have you never made ice cream using this method before? Second, you seriously didn't realize how deep the container was and question why it didn't freeze in the first place? They didn't have that big of a container in 1600's. She did such little research and its so half assed.
This video is so misleading .......
Hi, what does a treat of the time means?
blade of mace that just sound like a op MMORPG weapon that you can obtain through hard grinding
so....you have the recipe but then just do what you want. like whats the point??????????
Love ice cream!! BTW can u plz tell me with what can i replace almond flour for making macarons?!
WE WANT MORE OF KIANO!!!!!! I love Kiano! She so pretty and I love her personality and her voice. ??
OMG MY HURGY
If I had a 1 time use time machine I would go back to Lady Ann Fanshawe in 1660 and tell her her recipe was featured on youtube on Tasty!!!
Can we take a second to admire how beautiful kiano is ?
girl....you're beautiful, and i'm smitten by your chill vibe :)
I love orange flower water so much. It’s still used a lot in middle eastern dessert.
The woman would have go to the north pole to fetch ice cause 350 years old ago there were no refrigerators ??
I wonder who has a bucket that big at home
i bought tasty products from walmart. just loved it. thanks
jesus, add water to the ice...
Ann Fanshawe was an English memoirist and cookery author. Born at 25 March 1625, St Olave Hart Street, City of London, United Kingdom and died at 20 January 1680, Ware, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, married to Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet (1644). Daughter of John Harrison, this lady was a talent at her time! She wanted this to be a modern trend of the 1700s but look what ice cream is now. After all, this what you can do is.. mix the blade of mace and orange flower water and BOOM!! I mean like no one really used to read her books THAT MUCH. but wait till 200 years and BOOOOOOOOM! SOMEONE SAYS OK I READ IT ITS A PIECE OF HISTORY.
So ice cream is frozen sugar milk?
from where did they get the ice 350y ago?
This is so relaxing to watch yea? OK I think so.
These sound like hipster ice cream flavors
You have a Buch of subscribers, mind giving me a few pointers?
if you are a fan of cooking,desserts abd you love to watch cooking videos and enjoy it,i’v uploaded lovely stuff that you can see and like ??Have a great greatly day ??
Kiano needs to be in more videos!
Ice cream, Ice Cream, Who wants some ice cream? :D
I was hoping for a 350 year-old ice cream
WHEW....I've never been this early
Wow I thought salt melted ice.!
Every-time I watch a tasty video with Kiano in it, I can't stop staring at her! She's so BEAUTIFUL! She has gorgeous eyes and lips! (Not in a creepy way) Also, she's so calm..like she could be synonymous with serenity :)
Kiano, like piano.. She's cute..
woah this video was so chill haha
Where’s the 350 year old??? Clickbait
350 years ago..??????.. lires..
I have the same soap feeling with the orange flower water. I honestly hate the flavor but it’s used in multiple desserts over here in the Middle East.
She did a decent job, but needed to know that flavors get stronger to the taste as liquids cool or freeze since it takes time to develop. This is why it's best to add less flavor...what seems not flavorful when hot will taste better at room temperature or cold.
She is so cute
Species were expensive but they aren’t now
350 yeezy?
"Icy" cream
350 years old? It should’ve rotted years ago!
I thought the thumbnail was Michelle Obama before I wore my glasses
I LOVE ??
Do u guys have tasty Malaysia? I would like to join, im from malaysia??
Eww a Black Woman Next time Someone White Or Asia

Why ?
At first I thought it meant that this specific icecream was made 350 years ago...
Kiano, your voice makes me so happy!
Thank you Lady Anne?
Here before 100k views
How about mixing the mace and the orangeflower water in the next batch?
Ice cream recipe from the mid 1660's !~~  This is just amazing !!!
holy shit i thought it said trying to make a 350 year old into an icecream, LMFAO. thats enough internet for one day.
Name gang
I have 350 year old icecream stuck to the roof of my freezer. Never cleaned or defrosted so it must be that old.
That looks Tasty
You do know that the 17th century is the 1600s, right?
I’m going to take a break from eating ice cream. It’s getting too cold outside ??????
Something different
the mid 1660's is still in the 17th century, no need to correct it.

Ooooh, if someone describes ice cream as "nasty," I think I'll pass. :) I prefer butter pecan. ;) This was very interesting though! I hadn't a clue ice cream was even a thing 350 years ago.
Looks nice??
I am so confused on how they can make ice cream like that back then but i cant even make ice cream in a bag now
??????????????????????
cool
Thanks 4 sharing! Exciting 2 me to learn that ice cream was enjoyed so many hundreds of years ago!
Kiano looks especially pretty in this video! Loveee ????
So happy to see another video from Kiano! We need you on the channel more.
I like ice cream. How is that recipe 350 years old

Hi
HELLO ALL - Two quick things: 1) There seems to be some YouTube error meaning some people are seeing this video listed as 'private' when clicking - either refresh or open in another window and it should be fine! 2) John is perfectly fine everyone, the poor divil had a sports injury right before the shoot - he's all better now. :)
Would love to see you guys try the "Hot Ones" style wing challenge. Could be entertaining!
When lor said fck a duck I propelled my tea halfway across the room my love for that beautiful girl has grown exponentially, her sense of humor is as gorgeous as she is ,love to one and all from Tennessee Note to the guys when you're going to eat spicy food have a container of sour cream or a glass of milk they cut into the effects of the capsaicin in the pepper and limit its Ill effects on your digestion!
You call down the thunder? Well Hell comes with it! and it's name is Carolina Reaper
The redhead with the glasses is gorgeous move me to Ireland righr now lol
I love watching people eat hot foods ... and suffer afterward.
They should try jerky from the store called all things jerky
I love Carolina reaper jerky ??????
That one lad been scrappin! Hope you like the Jerky lad! Gotta like jerky!
Wtf happened to John?
Should have an "aftermath" video for when the reaper exits!
If you thought that beef jerky was hot, you should try some of the super hot sauces. A good one would be Blair's ultra death sauce.
get some Last Dab on here for the children. Let them experience it.
5:40 "I'm the spicy boy, I'm the one who jerks." I see we have a Game Grumps fan :D
There's that taste that makes you think it's ok! Lmao!!!!
The Carolina reaper is just too hot to enjoy. Stick with the medium spicy jerky
Great news the reaper has been replaced by a hotter pepper, from the same guy that made the reaper. While only about 20% hotter, you'll probably be able to tell. Unless you die!   Just what the world needed, a pepper that tastes like brimstone!
John! What happened to your face?! I don't want to be stereotypical...but....
I eat Carolina reaper every day, I really like it, all my family love it and is really funny when a friennd comes and eats some our food jajaja
Why did the Irishman wear three condoms?? To be sure,to be sure ,to be sure
Thank you so much for this. Their reaction after eating the Carolina Reaper made me laugh so much I cried. I haven't laughed like that in a long time and I really needed it. God bless you all.
Time to try some South African biltong... much better than this beef jerky stuff. You get it from beef, deer, kudu and others... also in the spicy variant.
Lolol the burp
Yo! What happened to my boys nose man I love this guy on the try channel send me to the person that Hurt you and in the name of the Irish fellow man I will hunt him down
Ahh fuk a duck love it
"It was goin really well Jeff. It was going really well. But I just think we should see other people. Because now when I think of you, my anus will Contract......" "ALRIGHT JEFF!!! "
You cannot blame Jeff for the Carolina Reaper one. You have to blame your friend on the channel for asking for the SPICIEST jerky. He is the one you should be blaming.
What happened to poor John Sharpson's nose....
5:08 that’s what she said
WE in Texas love that California reaper shit
6:03 sexy
I LOVE Lolsy Bryne she is so cute and funny.
Are I'm dreaming or they just love something from america?
"It's really hard to..." What you mean you have to JERK ya head and hand to eat the JERKY... Well fuck me y'all, are you forreal??? :D
"Fook a dook!"
Drinking the water is cheating!
holy shit John!! what happened to your face.... (er... well.. I mean your nose?)
Fun stuff-we make our own with ground meats (chicken, lamb, beef, and yep sometimes duck) and different flavors and spices.
How about one with South African food? We gave something similar to jerky called biltong. Not sweet like jerky but savoury. Much better than jerky.
"I'm the spicy boy, I'm the one who jerks!." This has to be a Game Grumps reference to: "I"m the video game boy, I'm the one who wins!."
What happened to dudes nose? And when is Laura gonna let me take her on a date?
The guy in the Tetris shirt deserves an award for wearing a Tetris shirt. I fuckin love that game
ROTBL (B is bed) no shit I was in tears laughing so hard. Sorry guys but that shit is funny right there.
niamh is one I would a night with. ffs
This is awesome. Not what you all went through but hear me out. I LOVE.....jerky in almost all it's flavors. I'm not a fan of that super spicy stuff. I love the Irish ladies, though unfortunately I have had little contact. You're hilarious. The accent is cute, sexy, fun, etc. Your attitudes are great. You put a lot of American men to shame. Keep up the great work!
Did she say fuq a duck?
So is the crew back? Or is this old material?... Because I've really missed them!!
Guinea pigs for Carolina Reaper... I'm not dead, but you might be.
I see you sliding Grump reference, Colin. Now tell me, was it worth the pain? XD
Hhahahahah yess I’m from the state where the Carolina reaper is from
You guys should really try the USA military MRE's!!! Some are good and some are HORRIBLE!!! Love you guys
You have to use gloves working with Carolina Reaper :-)
Here in the US that's still mild lol
got to say Americans love there heat and a good challenge
I want Colin and Lolsy's T-shirts!!!
Wow. The girl with the cats shirt gets better looking every episode. Your so hot!!!!
Dude what the hell your nose/face?? Who did that to you tell me I’ll kick their A$$.... seriously NOOOOOOOOOO!
6:14 make this top comment XD
"I'm the spicy boy; I'm the one who jerks." Was that a veiled Game Grumps reference?
Don't fear the reaper.
I see that the Irish millennial’s are just as stupid as our American millennial’s.
Try Southern american biscuits!! With gravy, with jelly, with butter and honey etc
Get Well Soon, John.
I really want to try that last one. I'm the type of crazy motherfucker those were meant for.
More emphasis on the brunettes huge tits please
Can you belive I just noticed my bishes from facts opened a new channel?!!? I AM THE HAPPIEST HOE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!! I love yall! Seriously!
how about ALL of the Try guys & gals do the ONE CHIP CHALLENGE!. ??
When that girl at the start said its time to jerk off i almost nut.. is that normal?
Take meat, slice it real thin, stick it in a food dehydrator, package it and enjoy. It isn’t hard to make your own. And before you dry it, put whatever you want on it as far as seasonings go. Great for hiking, backpacking, fishing, camping, when you need extra protein.
This is getting to be annoying. Not all americans like hot, spicy food. I am irritated at being portrayed as a classless chili muncher just because I happen to be an american. Get real, folks. There are way of having lots of flavor in your food besides adding too much chili.
kick that bitch with the fake red hair and cat shirt. she always acts like an immature 13 year old twat.
OMG, I need to move to Ireland!!!! I love these people!!!!!
Bláithín is fucking adorable.
The Woman in the glasses is finer than a new set of snow tires...
Hey blond are you sweeting on the riper :P
"I'm the spicy boy, i'm the one who jerks" Is that a game grumps reference?
HAHHAHAHAHAHA Burn that anus MwaHAHAHAHAHAha!!
I love how everyone just paused before the Carolina Reaper. :O
Ur poor arse holes died....may they r.i.p
Try pepper extracts including the end hot sauce
I grew up eating steak in a bag beef jerky. It was the best tasting jerky I have ever had. Full of flavor till the last chew. Now you won't be able to find this in any store. For it was home made with love. And sadly the man who made it died this year. But I will forever be unable to eat that tasteless stuff they sell at the store. His was the best. He once had these two brothers who keep saying that his xstra extra hot wasn't hot enough. So he keep trying to up the heat while still keeping a great flavor. Finally these men said it was hot enough. But by then he had to were a hazmat suit with the full setup to bag the jerky and clean the equipment. After a few years he quit making that flavor due to the fact that he lives in Texas and it's vary hot in a hazmat suit. He got too old for such things. It was his hobby and we all supported him. It also was high quality ingredients and expensive. The funny thing about it was his costumer base where all dirt poor. But one free sample was all it took and you where pulling out your wallet.

Have them try Jack links beef jerky
I'm amazed that you folks are eating this stuff. I could never ever. And the best counter for hot spices, is milk chocolate.
5:42 "...cuz I'm the one who jerks...and yeah I...just put the whole thing in my mouth like an idiot..." Fkn classic! And this is why I subbed initially. You never know wtf is gonna come out of their mouths at ANY moment. Gotta love the Irish. (?°?°)?? ??? ? ?(°?° ?)
I love watching the Irish try vids those guys sop funny. Keep em coming.
Niamth tumbleton is absolutely gorgeous
mad points for the "Cool Runnings" song
Love the Game Grumps reference, haha!!!!
"I'm the one who jerks!" And then her looking kowingly at the camera.
LOLSY WHERE DID U GET THAT SHIRT OH MY GOD I LOVE THAT VIDEO
What is wrong with Tetris boy? He never makes sense!
I am sometimes surprised the Try crew never ask about the price of food. Store bought jerky in the USA is fucking expensive.
Éadaoin’s laugh at the beginning! ??
Hoover it lol ??????
IF you think the burn is bad wait for the "After Burn" to kick in. LOL
I think they should Try Hot Ones Last Dab sauce
What heck happened to John!?
sponsored by Jeff lol good stuff
For 50 years I have be on a quest to find authentic home made root beer, not that crap they throw dry ice into on Halloween, and authentic beef jerky. My grandfather made the best. He would cut 1/4 inch strips of beef 8" long, roll it in box full of pepper with no other flavorings, throw in on a clothes line or barbwire fence and let it dry naturally for a couple of week. NOW THAT, was jerky to die for.
4:25 LMAO??????
What the hell happened to Johnathan's nose?!
Come on y'all are weak.....weak....weak.....weak
Just found you guys, and love it. Part Irish on my dad's side and see where my sense of humor comes from!??????
Did that woman say her rectum reacted to hot spicy beef?
You really need to come here and go to buffalo wild wings.. Its  tasty hot..
If Blaithin wants an American husband, I volunteer. That girl is gorgeous!
Eadaoin looks like Miley Cyrus in that preview thumbnail
Lol ??
Wait!!!!! ...... ‘Hates Everything’ four eyed ginger chick actually liked something??!! Hell has frozen over.....
I love Reaper jerky. Chase the heat ;).
Nice snatch!
3:02 COOL RUNNINGS!!! ??
How they think jerky is made me facepalm so fucking hard.
?? best one yet
John's catch and Bla's reaction made my day.
They actually deliver internationally :O! shipping cost is $28 but totally worth it????
Fucking hell John, feel better you crazy goof!
So excited about eating spicy jerky then they drop the Carolina reaper on them and asses tighten, and everybody runs home to momma! "Cummon! Show a little backbone!"... BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!
try biltong!!!! and Drywors!!!!
1:42 should have been your thumb nail
Now did you get in a fight lad or were you so knackered you fell down and fucked up your nose
Oh fuck a duck.....I so love you.....that was so funny
Eadaoin is such a beaut
These ladies and their sexual innuendos.
Please do a drinking game with random Absinthe brands.
Everyone wearing shirts with words are on the right side.
1:42 That gal could suck-start a leaf blower !
Other than the novelty of "hottest pepper" I don't see the appeal of eating anything with Carolina Reaper written on it. Hot food is one thing, but so hot you can't even taste what the original dish was is another.
Has anyone noticed that more then half the cast teeth are piss yellow???
So John was Headbutting Rufus eh ......................... ;-p
John, John, viciously hitting something with your face is a metaphor, man...
Who would buy the Reaper flavor? The word you're looking for is Masochist.
some of the first jerky wasnt even done. it was still floppy. the guy with the screwed up face pulled one out and it flopped. jerky isnt supposed to be floppy
Goes to the jerky factory just to see Niamh and Lolsy chain smoking and vacuuming sides of beef.
5:45 Was that a Game Grumps reference?
Wait a second! At least three women continue to call me over because every time they think of me their anus contracts...
... Hoover my steak [pantomime] anytime!
“Im the spicy boy. Im the one who jerks.” Game Grumps reference. ??
With a certain leather clad man ??
what happened to that one guy's nose?? get in a bit of a tussle? :P
3:02 was that Cool Runnings lol?
"Now I know why dragons are so angry...." haha...nice job.
John has a piece of jerky on his nose...
How about you guys try playing Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle? We all LOVE it!
Use Peanut butter if it's too hot.
LOL and the Reaper is mild
Great video!
It taste like burning... lol good stuff.
NEXT TIME ON TRY CHANNEL Z!!! We find out the truth behind the bandage! All scars have their tale!
Sooo.... We really don't talk about fight club?... Cmoooon broooo... FUCK THE JERKY!!! Out with it! How'd you get poked hard enough to get stitches!?!?!?
Irish people try playing Dungeons & Dragons?????
how does this taste?!
Hahaha who nutted John?
The dark haired girl is HOT!! I want to marry her!??
I'd love to see Irish people react to American Gods. Mad Sweeney specifically.
What happened to homeboys nose?
Anyone suffering from depression just needs to go to Ireland and hang wit da locals.
Reaper Jerky will give a whole new meaning to the Annie Song "Tomorrow" ..
For some perspective https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSeBSXmc9rU
Having an old fashioned "jerk" off lol
The part about your body pushing everything out is true. Especially if you eat a Carolina Reaper or a Ghost Pepper on an empty stomach. Your body goes into full on purge mode and wants to shit and puke everything out of your body. DO NOT ever eat one of those peppers on an empty stomach.
Irish people react to the Irish pug songs!
I laughed so hard that I woke up my wife. Can I please be your token NDN?
So Jerky is cow bacon?
Carolina reaper jerky is delicious
Belching just makes Carolina Reaper even worse.
Beef jerky is good in any situation.
The hottest beef jerky I've ever eaten is Katie's XXX Scorpion pepper. It's hotter than any Carolina Reaper pepper jerky I've had even. You should look up their Super Spicy Beef Jerky Variety Pack
Would have been cooler to say he got into an alcohol fueled bar fight. Just saying. Sounds more Irish.
This is a personal challenge cuz I've done it before it's a product called Pure cap. Make buffalo wings and put three drops of it in the sauce before you mix it and let them eat it.
The women are gorgeous, but you all are awesome.
I can't stop staring at Johnny's nose...
What happened to your nose?
Jeff trying to kill these people
Irish People React to Tenacious D.
I'm the spicy boy! I'm the one who jerks! Game Grumps reference for those wondering.
Please God!... Give me an Irish Girl.
Bláithín, I still find myself attracted to your feminine charms! I know you hate when men notice you... but I can't help it!
I cannot believe that Carolina Reaper is an ingredient in a food product. The stuff is dangerous.
Did Bla' have to kick the shit out of Sharuf to make him eat jerky?? Easy woman!!
whats up with John s face?
Holy shit, it must suck alcohol fetus syndrome cock in merry old Ireland. No beef jerky? Bullshit. What a retarded channel. It should be attractive person meets Irish people. That would be great.
Today I learned not to take a rip while watching Try videos.
Carolina Reaper will ruin your tastebuds for life! Love you guys!!
"I am the boy who jerks" pfffffffffttt!
Did y'all have fun jerking off? ??
Eadaoin.... You're clearly a very filthy girl, based on your sense of humor, so what do ya say you let me whisper sweet nothings into your butthole?
You should do another America chips but use the brand Herrs instead of Utz chips
Funny funny funny and ladies smoking hot
The fuck happened to your face, dude
Czech alcohol already. The original Pilsner (Pilsner Urquell), Tuzemák (wannabe "Rum"), Budweiser Budvar, Žufánek Absinthe, Slivovice (Plum brandy), Becherovka...
Irish people eating Carolina Reaper (-flavored beef jerky) and all turning red like beets. What could be better?
Loving that carolina reaper jerky!
He's the spicy boy whom jerks
"I'm the one who jerks"
Fuck you, your channel sucks.
I love the girl with the spectacles
Disturbing how all three pairings linked the Carolina Reaper jerky to some sort of violation of their anuses/bottoms. Funny, but disturbing.
Let’s try next time Irish people try toothpaste ???????.
The blonde Irish lady reminds me of my sister no barrier and making allot of immature comments.
Looks like you just put a dick in your mouth
Aww John! I feel so bad! #prayersforjohn
Jesus! what a slash! Warrior.
Christ Irish folks are sexy lol
They did pretty good, but my brother and I ate a whole Carolina reaper each! I bet that would’ve tore them up! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5glJlIVG0
"I'm the boy who jerks." and her look ??????
I'm assuming the guy with the bust up nose is a boxer and that he wasn't mobbed on the way to this show?
an irish with braces and a broke nose... all seems normal here
The woman with glasses is so beautiful??
Ordering a bag of the Carolina Reaper now.
I just watch for the chick with glasses. Idgaf she captivating.
A Carolina Reaper. That's what you eat to start the day. Screw the caffeine. No one sleeps when their taste buds and throats are on fire.
Years ago, in the US, we had a truck commercial with a frontier family making their way west in what was originally a covered wagon. But, in the fashion of the commercial, the wagon had been replaced with a truck. The wife was in the passenger seat and extended a piece of meat to the husband, who was driving. "Jerky?" He replied, "Actually, no. It's a real smooth ride."
The bad thing about über-spicy foods is, they burn going in one end, and burn coming out the other end. I guess Blue Oyster Cult was wrong, when they said, "Don't Fear The Reaper".
"My rectum is reacting" LOL
Irish people watch and react to Daniel Sloss's 'Jigsaw' concept
love this channel, love you guys, make me laugh all day long. but there at the end when Laura started talking bout the the after effects of that "Reaper" pepper,,, i lost it LMAO. I guess it could be called the Skirt Dropper jerky? LOL but serious. you ladies and gents are great!!! keep it up!!!!!
Johnny bullshit is like "where is the beer!!??" Niamh is so pretty.????
reaper jerk --- do NOT touch anything "sensitive" until you have washed your hands atleast 4 times!
"Awh fook a dook" LOL :)
What the hell happened to his face? Did he get in a bar brawl?
Irish PEOPLE? Just say Irish. I realize it won't be Irish Turtles. God I hate PC culture.
You should react to one of your videos but with auto-generated subtitles! YouTube doesn’t really understand the Irish accent so it’s extremely entertaining!
where I'm from, jerky is called Biltong
So,The former FACTS channel changed their name to TRY? Nice! Welcome Back,everyone!
"hoover" is one of the best verbs, ever.
binging your last two videos makes my mouth watering... LOL
Feck off you Irish coonts.
Well you did ask for spicy! Ask and you shall receive!! :)
Irish broads are gross.
the women on this one are charming and attractive
Someone needs to make a "Best of burps" video ft Laura aka Lolsy. ??
Eadaoin is hot.
How does Eadaoin pronounce her name?
When you have a carolina reaper wank its important to NOT wank with the same hand as you touched the reaper with.
Licking cows and retracting rectums...Just another normal day on The TRY Channel...
You all need to try these... Specially the chocolate that listed first. There's a challenge to see how many tiny squares you can eat.... But you can only eat 1 every minute https://www.vat19.com/category/Spicy-Stuff
No one in America eats Carolina Reaper anything that except super hot pepper fanatics.
Yo , John , who is leather-clad -man ?
When I've got a long drive (like 5 hours or more), spicy beef jerky and Coke is my "go to" driving snack.
Lol. ????????
Is jesus in this video poor guy.
John, what happened to your face? Heal that up fast, y'hear?
“I’m the spicy boy, I’m the one who jerks.” Haha dying
Unfortunately “American” beef jerky is hot garbage. Gotta get that New Mexican beef ?? Jerky. It’s thee best
Lolsy burps ars so cute : )
Hilarious ??
damn who beat that dudes ass?
Fuck a duck. well played
2:40 is a Game Grumps reference. Nicely done.
For those new to beef jerky. It's not meant to be hot. It's meant to be good and tasty. Something you can take with you on a hike to give you energy.
I thought for sure poor John was going to cry when he saw the Carolina Reaper.... can't blame him though
O M G.. That burp what the cutest burp ever. She totally had me at burp. <3
Previously, on Bates Motel...
Pause at 0:29, that Black raven haired Irish girl looks like Jennifer Connelly to us United States borns. Pure Raven headed Irish Black beauty.
Do the Irish born lads and lassies have not USA American products? Is this really a t'ing ? In 2018?
jerky is smocked not just dried otherwise youd get a very bland taste not so good
@0:32 Who else isn't surprised the Irishman has recently been in a fistfight?
who hurt you JBS?
How about a mega mix video of all of Laura’s burps?
the shorter version of "jerk jerky" is jerk(1 + y)
If it wasnt so expensive to send you guys something, Id love for you to try mexican american candies. Those pack a punch. There are so many things id love for you to try
I always love Lolsy’s burps... so hot ;)
Line of the video: lolsy: fuck a duck
Gotta love Laura and her "Cool Runnings" reference!
Did a football hooligan marry his Aunt or something?! What happened to his nose?
I just finished watching all your videos! ?? I was really sad when FACTS ended since I won’t be able to watch you guys again but now all is sorted. Very well! ??
Eadoin is sexy as hell
Do Mexican candy
IRISH PEOPLE ROCK ! And they learned to speak English very well. ??
I hope someone put a few toilet rolls in the fridge before this one...
I had some ghost pepper Beef Jerky , That was friggin hot !!!
Okay guys ... I noticed that none of the people from the spiciest wings video were in this one. I have no doubt they would have walked out when they saw Carolina Reaper on that package. I wouldn't blame the either ... That stuff really is dangerous.
"No wonder dragons are so angry." Hahaha!! You won the best line of the show!
Eadaoin. Is gorgeous
I made some spicy Jerky at home using "Shit the Bed" and "Satan's Blood" hot sauces. It was great eating it, but not so great when your ass feels like a flamethrower afterwards.
Ah, my people
Btw this isnt rarely good jerky. You can buy jerky like this anywhere in the South western US.
Is that a blonde, Irish James Mcavoy?
@lolsybyrne wins for best timing of a burp...
Irish People Try :Woomtree Hot Capsaicin Sauce
Carolina Reaper is great! I have powder to add to my chili. And tacos. And lasagna. And anything I think it would go well with.
What the Hell happened to John Sharpson's nose? ??????
That quote should live on!!! I'm the one who jerks and I put two in my mouth.... Thank you for that gem!
Lolsy's belch was fucking SPECTACULAR 6:03
Be careful what you ask for Eadaoin you just might get it! LOL great video.
It's official... I am an awful human being... I saw John and immediately thought "Why'd he get into a bar fight?!"
Hehe, who on TRY's up for Samyang x2 Super Spicy Instant Noodle challenge? (reputed world's spiciest instant noodle) Warning: diet not guaranteed
thank u tryreland
"I'm the spicy boy! I'm the one that jerks." He watches Game Grumps! hahaha
Try Nashville Hot Chicken!!!
The blonde is hot shes my fav
Great video guys just keep the gay guys and we're good! Awesome video Try Channel!
God I love all of these crazy Irish and the lassies are so lovely to look at it!
A Very interesting format...I also do Food Challenges & Irish.
"Im the one who jerks" XD HAHAHAHHA
ahahahahah, the episode was going so well....aaaaaand it took a nose dive towards the end ??
Don't mind watching you eat hot and hotter stuff but for god's sake have a beer handy instead of milk! Alcohol lifts the pepper oils off your tongue and washes it downstream.
??????
Irish people learn to drive an 18 wheeler.
I watched this salivating, because I love hot, spicy stuff. Should've had my dinner first. Also as soon as the Carolina Reaper was shown on the screen with the smoke alarm and flames, I started laughing. The after Carolina Reaper reactions had me crying I was laughing so much.
I bet john got his ass beat by the leather jacket man hitting on his girl
That Cool Runnings reference though! Lolsy, have my children!
Hot peppers help us heal. John's hurling hurt should be fine next time. Get better, John!
Missed out on "You can't fix stupid" jerky from Lincoln Ne. Wish I would have known would have sent some.
Hot and spicy are two different things. Carolina Reaper is just godly hot lol
Bláithín, I'm the one who would buying and eating lots of it, but it costs too much to buy. So I make my own. With a dehydrator, or over a fire, not with a Hover.
Imma have to hit up Jeff's website. I love jerky. I love spicy.
It was nice to see Balithin enjoying the food for a change ??
You know what these guys should try next? the Mother Of All Bars!
You guy... Never satisfied. First you ask for hotter. Then you complain about how hot it is.
I forget that Colin is a Game Grumps fan, lol
Guessing that no one in the shoot spoke to Áine, Paul or Nicole, and that Dónal tricked John or something...
6:03??
John looks like he got glassed by some chav
2:57 just a moment of appreciation for John and that awesome catch that flowed seamlessly into a presentation. your skill has been recognized! or sheer luck lol
Did Leather Jacket Guy punch Johnny Bullshit in the face for real this time? What happened?
Loved everyone's reaction to the reaper lmao have you guys thought about being on Hot Ones?
COOL RUNNINGS REFERENCE FOR THE WIN!
Should have them try the last dab pepper x from hot ones.
Lolsy just crying with her tongue stuck out is where I lost it.
"It's not even food, it's just pain." John, truer words have never been spoken.
Who punched John in the face?
Colin: Send us some spicy beef jerky, the spiciest of the spiciest. Jeff Richards: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
I'm so addicted to these videos!! I've watched dozens and dozens and dozens...most of these folks seem pretty cool. Couple I am less fond of. That Laura/Lolsy is lovely and somehow makes burps cute. I think that she is my favourite even without the cute burps and red hair, I think I'd like her best as an actual person. Keep it up Try Channel!
Lolsy is the best. So funny.
Well, you said you wanted to sweat. Was that reaper hot enough for you?
Bravo Jeff.
I fouked up
WTF happened to John's nose!!!!! :O
I have no idea why but the fact that the try channel throws the things at them is way more amusing to me than it should be
Vegans be warned. Awesomeness is about to ensue!
No matter where in the world you're from, real beef jerky is amazing.
Omg Niamh ??????
5:41 Was that a Game Grumps reference?! XD
Ice cream all round!!!
How about you guys make your own jerky.
Lolsy's burp was so haught
o my goodness i could not stop laughing thanks
Jesus what happened to John's face?? That looks seriously painful!
Can you fuck nuts bring Harker back?
One of the best vids yet! However, I just can't get to the ending because @ 6:03, she has me dying! I will try to make it there eventually.
I so laughed at their pain. I was crying from all my laughing.
THIS WAS YOUR BEST ONE YET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some people can only take a little heat, some can take a lot. For people who can only take a little, or a medium heat, the bad burn is in the mouth and throat. For people like me, who can take major heat levels, it isn't the pain in the thoat, or mouth, but the next day...
Looks like someone was in a bar fight the night before the shoot...
OMG I spt my dew on the screen when LOLSY belched HAHAHAHHAHAHA
"ALRIGHT JEFF!"
Is this true is this Shannan when she was a child? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhip2cFGLM
Niamh has the cutest smile, every time I've seen her on facts/try, she puts a smile on my face. As old as I am, that's hard to do. Thank you
you guys should do irish people watch insatiable i would love to hear bláithín roast it
Irish people watch Khabib start a melee after UFC fight against Mcgregor. Also, react to the Irish fans getting knocked out left and right by Russian fans.
What happened to Johns nose
You're supposed to have a beer with the reaper and in smaller bites. Then finish it off with your favorite shot. I prefer the "Irish car bomb" with the spicy stuff.
A helpful hint for the Irish lads and lasses: a cup of hot black coffee works best to quell the heat after eating spicy food. No joke. I've never tried it with hot tea, sorry.
What happened to Johnny Bullshit? I thought those leatherjacketguy punches were fake?
Try the spicy ramen challenge or the hottest chip one! That would be so fun to watch!
I like your channel except the fucking bullshit anti gun ad in the beginning. Piss poor and stupid they should just stop it. !!! Nothing about that is real.for fucks sake.
Jon...You aren't suppose to catch the ball with your face!! You're too cute for that!
F a duck LOL!!!!! As an American who visited Ireland let's just say I miss Saint James gate. ROFLMAO
I’m so happy companies are recognizing you! I’m here for all the successful
Ahhh god, I love you people so much Between this, the Disgusting Shots, and the Krispy Kreme, you have made my week So Much Better. Thanks to you all, for sacrificing your digestive tracts to all of us out here in Internet Land!
That's the 1st time I've heard Lolsy swear...usually it's "holy guacamole" apparently Carolina Reaper brings out "F a duck." ..she's still the cutest!!
Includin yar ass.
Jamaican "beef jerky"? probably an alley cat.,don't eat anything from Jamaica.
Irish women.
Her burping is the cutest thing for some reason
They said it wasn’t spice enough so he gave them what they wanted Spivey enough
Lolsy, please call me up if you ever do the cow licking thing. Sounds gross but I'm curious nevertheless. Can't I start by putting hot sauce on my cat and then lick her. Never mind, I'm talking bollocks and I might be slightly pissed... if not fully drunk. Sláinte!
Ok , Which one of you punched Johnny Bullshit in the nose?.... He stole leather jacket Guys cabbage again didnt he
Does it make me a bad person that i enjoy their suffering so much? Now make Dermot eat 4 gallons of peanut butter.
What happened to your nose mate?
God I love Eadaoin!
So they give us just a tease of Kellie but she’s not part of the shot and no one mentions Sharpson’s busted face?
What? Not even one explanation about what happened to Mr Sharpsons nose?
That game grumps reference at 5:42
You want some spice and heat? Give the HOT ONES Challenge with Sean Evans a TRY!
I bought one called Ring of Fire a while back. I realized what ring would be on fire when it worked it's way out a day later.
@6:03 Impressive
Irish people catch fire.
Hahahahahaha Arin would be so proud of Colin's "I'm the spice boy, I'm the one who jerks" comments haha
OMG, I have a deep pain in my heart that John's cute and darling face is injured.
"My rectum is reacting!" lmfao!
Do the one chip
5:32 "Dracaris!" lol!!!
Sure now that can't be a good idea to stick two bits of that carolina reaper one in your mouth, that's asking for trouble!
that was a fun video to watch. It was all going fine until the last one. Then complete chaos.
MC Spicy Boy
Irish people try getting a tan.
5:42 did Colin just make a Game Grumps reference I-
His nose disgusts me.
My rectum is reacting ?????????? EPIC
My grandfather said "If your ass was not burning after you shit it was not hot enough of".
"When I think of you my anus will contract " Should be on a Tshirt ! Much love ?????
"Im the spicy boy, I'm the one who jerks"!!..????????
"Who's buying this ?!?' Probably people with wicked head colds & sinus problems.
surprised you went the carolina reaper route considering the last go round
Best episode!
They are going to erupt out their anuses with such force as to leave them more stretched out than a schoolboy in prison.
They're so cute when they're suffering. Poor Laura and John were turning weird colors though.
laughs in evil American
I love jerky and spicy things, but I tend to stop at anything past the Ghost Pepper.
I am the one who jerks.
lol my sphincter winced in sympathy.... The carolina reaper once tried to kill me as well!
You got Jeff's attention, nobody saw that coming. You brave slightly mental, lovely people.
Unfortunately guys, Carolina reaper burns twice........when you eat it, and I think you know the second burn. Good luck and God's speed! One bit of advice, if you use a handicap stall, those hand holds are excellent to hold on to when the Reaper exits!
Laura was pretty funny in this!
Was John saying it got stuck in his braces? If so I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL the braces not the Carolina reaper thing
It's cow "tipping" Lolsy. Not cow "lipping".
5:41 was that a Game Grumps "video game boy" reference?
“Dracarys!” Haha
Love that React videos can include company quality assurance.
If there's any time for a beer it's now.. with that delicious jerky
Laura is bae
John, lean further over when you're hurling, so that when the seat falls it hits you in the back of the head, not the face.
#contractedanus
Thanks Jeff!
Yep, Lolsy became Mel Giedroyc at 6:03. Definitely caught me by surprise, laughing my bollocks off!
Someone’s skin is getting better ??
Looks like someone got in a fight at a pub. I'm SMH Ireland....
Looks like John was at the McGregor fight
Does Shannon just not work here anymore?????????????????????????????????
John, you're the most precious human being who ever lived.
Wise words " put the sauce on the cow and lick it off" ??????
"I'd be happier if you put the marinade on a cow, and i could lick the cow. I wouldn't have to chew as much." ??????
I live in South Carolina. We literally grow them here. It’s named after death and you fools put it in your mouths! We live with the plant and only a few of us are foolish or crazy enough to eat it or anything it touches
Has someone sent them biltong yet?
Oh shit! John is there something u wanna tell us, does the Leather Jacket Guy beat u w/ the hammer again..lol
some one got a head stuck on em ????
Ok, someone out there must be producing Carolina Reaper flavored Surströmming for the try channel.
My rectum is reacting to it ??????????
Hey, at least nobody had to wear toxic containment gloves to handle the food this time!
I hope he won the fight. He looks like he ran into a brick wall.
What happened to B.S. Johnny's' face?
the nose
Good to see John still not talking about Fight Club. Good job John...
Laura's steak hoovering sound effects = 10/10
John ,dude are you ok? What happened? Good to see the Irish again, i love all the videos, especially the absinthe taste test ! I laugh my ass ogf every time I see it.
6:03 I used to have a motorbike that sounded like that when it was running out of fuel.
+The Try Channel okay, I'm giving up. I tried to mail alcohol; it's illegal. I tried to send other stuffs; I had to fill out 20 pages of government paperwork in triplicate. I give up! Seriously. Who can I make a check out to?
This one was so cool .
:D
I never knew until this moment that 'The TRY Channel' filmed all the participants together in the same room at the same time.At the 30 second point in the video, one group was talking to another group. I just assumed that they brought them in two at a time and then spliced the resulting film scenes together as they tested whatever they were going to test for that particular shoot. But if you look early in the video, one of the group of two is speaking off-camera to another group of two. That's interesting!
FUCK UH DUCK
There are people that eat things so spicy it hurts them just to prove they can do it.  If there are people that'll buy it, someone will sell it.
Try Peruvian food!!!
wth happened to John Sharpson?
I FORMALLY REQUEST A TRY CHANNEL/FIRST WE FEAST MASHUP TO TRY HOT SAUCES. You're welcome just send my check in the mail.
Mayyn, none of these punks are OG. John has let the Sharpson team down.
who the hell beat the hell out of my dude? or no means no bro
Well someone got headbutted
Don't fear the Reaper
I like the Reaper jerky, BUT that is because I've been eating spicy food for so many years that I have a tolerance built up. For people who don't have that tolerance, it can be pretty overwhelming. For me the reaper is one of the best tasting peppers I've had in years. I still find myself surprised at how good of a pepper it is when so many hybrids are bitter and terrible.
More Lolsy and Niamh! The chemistry!
Why does this channel only feature Irish men trying food? It's so misogynistic.
How funny my rectum is reacting to it lmao great quote
3:12 Jeff's Jerk Jerky Not as good as Kirk Berkley's Turkey Jerky from Corner Gas.
What happened to the mans nose?!?!
Ryan Cullen fistfights a monkey.
BURPS FIRE
Best way to get a girl to drop her skirt and get her anus to "do things"? Just give em some carolina reaper. Not Carolina Raper. Thats something TOTALLY different.
So, the jerky I eat is more like meat chips. Homemade stuff wrapped in paper. Once you try that you don't typically go back to bagged stuff.
Since i saw Tumbleton on a drunk vid, and i noticed she does have the legs and the booty...she is my favorite...
Yay! Spicy jerky is bae.
"now whenever I think of you my anus will contract" "Alright, Jeff!" LOL
Eadaoin: "It's not the kick we were looking for. I want to start having the sweats here." Me: (wincing) Ooooh! She's gonna regret saying that!
Bring on Satan's toe...they want hot, give it to them.
You guys have to try American chewing Tabasco or snuff!!!!????
Lol's to lolsy on the sweet Thai jerky
John's subtly and unintentionally cosplaying Hawke from Dragon Age II, lol
Gettin jerkey with it ??
Saw Blaithin in Primark tonight.....nice to then see this in my inbox & 'nice to know' about her bloody rectum & contracting anus! Was good vid ??
I love anything Carolina Reaper related... couldn't wait to see your guys' reactions. Everyone's asses were involved in some way with that jerky hahaha!
Glad somebody thought to have dairy on hand for the Carolina Reaper jerky.
"I'm the spicy boy, I'm the one who jerks" -Colin Love the Game Grumps reference lol
sfter the last one Lolsy's Hair and face matched!!!
Who busted up Sharpson's face?
Never in the history of forevers have I ever seen a White person not bust out with a horrible fake accent the nanosecond they read "Jamaica" #bigfacts
Looks like Leather Jacket Guy finally landed a punch on John. lol..or was the culprit Levi???
Did my man fight a khabib fan last weekend?
Tastes like burning. I like jerky on the tougher side.
Hottest curries next !!!
Love it , hope the guy with the stitches is ok love you guys . From ohio
what has happened to my darling Jon
The Spanish have an expression "Caca Fuego". That is what you can expect after eating Carolina Reaper jerky.
Just harvested a lot of Carolina Reapers yesterday. Good timing ??
Good job JEFF ????????
Wtf was she doing eating in the bath? Although I've literally drank alcohol in the shower before haha
All the best in this one Wit, pain, passion, and another belch take from Lolsyb
Lol..."no wonder dragons are so angry"
Laura- "Oh fuck a duck!" When the reaper bag came out ?????? you're becoming one of my favorites ??
I wish I knew their names but what's his face looks like he got in a bar fight (or would they call it a pub fight?) xD Hopefully it doesn't hurt too much
One of the best vids so far as the Try channel.
Praising!
He did ask for some really spicy jerky.
Irish men try make up, you guys should so do that video! Please.
There's something really charming about an Irish woman's burp, I must admit
Looks like Jon was talkin’ when he should’ve been listenin’...
I love you guys!!!
Try Biltong. South African Jerky, much better.
Thanks for another fine video - I rate it 2.5 million Scoville Heat Units!
WTF Happened to John?
wait, what happened to John?
“ I am the spicy boy, I’m the one who jerks”, did you just make a Game Grumps reference?
I want to try carolina reaper jerky...but they dont sell it here. That looked amazing...ly hot!
I'm a man, but I'd totally lose to Lolsy in a burp contest. Period.
Rectum? Damn near killed ‘em
It’s a miracle they didn’t burst into flames by eating the last one. I will forever love this channel. You guys are awesome.
I want to send you some stuff from Barbados. Tell me how.
Got to get me a Irish woman!
He watches game grump.
Thumbs are almost invisible with the speed i press the try channel videos, cunts catch with the Jamaican jerk deserves applause
They are saying John had a Hurling accident, I think that's a cover, Leather Jacket Guy gave him a thrashing. c'mon. come clean.
"hurling accident" ;)
The fuck happened to johns nose.
I can see why dragon's are so angry. Loved it.
Yoo wat happend to dudes face lol
You ate Carolina Reaper Jerky...on purpose? That stuff is chewable fire!
why did levi and leather beat up on johnny bullshit
I don't normally comment, but when i do, i can just say i love you.
Hi to everyone at the Try Channel, I've been a subscriber to your YouTube channel for about 6 months now. I really enjoy watching your videos. I have 2 chronic lower back pain conditions, Lumbar Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Disc Disease and Osteoarthritis in both of my knees and in my hips. I can't sleep most nights because of my chronic pain so I binge watch your videos. Binge watching your videos helps me get through the sleepless nights and helps me forget about my pain. Thank you for making your videos, I really appreciate it.
My swearing vocabulary has greatly increased since watching the channel. You English speaking Europeans sure do know how to make some amazing swear combinations
"I'm the Spicy Boy! I'm The One Who Jerks!" Glad to see Colin is a Game Grumps fan!
Watching you kids suffer is SOOO entertaining, for some reason!
This was amazing!
This is my favorite video in a while. From Lolsy's burp at 6:00 to the end of the video, I couldn't breathe from laughing!
Looks like someone got khabib'd ????
Colin did ask for it. That hot spicy meat. He just shoved it in his mouth. It made him gasp for air. He then had white stuff on his tongue to take away the pain of the seed.
I was looking thru the comments as I had a hell of a time trying to view this video. You tube was saying I needed to sign in , video was private but I’d been on You Tube all afternoon without issue. Even rewatched Wednesday episode & viewed perfectly. My instructions stated to sign into goggle & put in a code. Disclaimer said if don’t feel comfortable having information used cancel which I did. I was able 10 minutes later able to sign in thru google with typical email & password. Very odd! Once I finally got to view the video, it was good for a laugh & get rid of frustration of trying to watch it. Enjoy your weekend!
Colin isn't old enough to know or remember Tetris!
The redheaded lass that had her tits almost falling out whilst eating pies can jerk my meat any day! I would fly out to Ireland to let her!!!!
My boyfriend is the one who eats the Carolina reaper. Jerky, Asian food, etc. The spicier the better for him. #FlammingButthole
Well he did ask for the heat. He got what he wanted.
Irish people watch John Mulaney?
"Now every time I think of you, my anus will contract" - Best Video Quote Winner
You should do "Irish people try american casseroles." Tater tot casserole, tuna casserole, tamale pie, chicken casserole, baked mac and cheese with ham casserole, etc
4:17 He suddenly got flashbacks of that one episode
Thank you thank you for the taste tests. This is why we are moving up in the subs!!!!  Nadia said John was in a hurling accident. Sorry not sure what that is. Is it where you move that heavy puck like thing on the ice ???? Thank you for answering
What’s that saying again? Be careful what you ask for, because you just might get it....
Her making the jerk off motion was everything! ??????????????
Bláithín at 5:58 is the most gif-able moment in the video. "Jeff, whenever I think of you my anus will contract." Cheers Bláithín!!! And everyone, so many sexual innuendos; even more than I expected!!! You make me so proud.??????
Looks like John was so excited for the jerky he put his face into a door...
Yay necklace girl!
ÉADAOIN did ya sweat? ??
Yay, Jeff! Treat 'em right! Red hot medium hot colored me confused, but y'all will be red in a minute.
Watch Demolition Ranch, Off The Ranch, and Zebra Corner.
Il give bandaid the sweats. By golly miss molly
I don't envy y'all one bit! ?? As always, great video, lads! ??
Polished off that entire tub of ice cream trying to cool my lil tongue down after that Carolina Reaper jerky ????
Put some cold jerky on yer schnoz
Johnny WTF happen to you lad?
I loooves me some jerkey!! Also, how bout my catch at 2:56 right?? ????
Notice that nobody who made the “Irish people eat the worlds hottest wings” for Facts made a return for this. Seeing Nicole O’Connor’s face go all red was pretty awful.
Colin ?? "I'm the spicy boy" I'm the one who jerks " And I put the whole thing in my mouth". I'm dead I'm laughing so hard?????? Poor John I could see the fear in your eyes at the reaper.????
6:12 ??????????????
I think the girls took the heat better than the guys
Now i want to try the spicy jerk
What happen to Johns face? Geezus Dude
Carolina Reaper is only bad if you wanna eat it raw,it's perfect in curry
Carolina Reaper Jerky?? Oh hell yeah, that sounds good. Except when you have braces, tongue piercings or any other type of open wounds. lol
I gotta try that. I hope Jeff sells on Amazon.
the black packaging means you guys are officially Jeff’s guinea pigs! ??
OMG, John, what happened to that gorgeous face of yours?????
Irish people watch power
Why was this pirvate?
Nodines jerky is awesome
I wonder if you'd be okay if you ate a Carolina reaper piece of jerky, immediately followed by a Krispy Kreme donut? Maybe try that? Or don't, because F the reaper.
"Previously on Try" please do more of this, it's hilarious!
Please stop subjecting these nice Irish people to our worst stuff and give them the good things from around the US.
Was that a game grumps reference?? “I’m the spicy boy I’m the one who jerks” lmfao
John's poor face was from hurling, but Laura's face took the spicy hit on today's vid I think.
Put a link guys! I will happily pay for like four of those bags
And here I was thinking America had nothing left to offer.... Spicy Jerky will save us.
Niamh ?????
I'm going to have to send some of our West Michigan jerky... Many flavors and types of animals
Love watching you guys try some hot things, but you really need to try some of our hot sauces and then we'll see..
Finally unset private mode. Yay! Blaithin was a bit over the top today, wow! I like it.
Sounds like Niamh said “UDDER flavors”! Ha, ha! Beef! Udders! (I know what you’re thinking: “How ‘dairy’ make bad puns!”)
John! What the hell man?
Is there a link where I can get some of this jerky?
Eaodin is awesome.
I’d hate to see what the other guy looks like! Jk jk hope it heals up quickly darlin!
Éadaoin got what the FUCK she asked for. xD
What happened to Johns nose?
Johnny B.S what happened, who did this to you, Éadaoin?!
You're really pumping the vids out lads, loving it
I would have bet the rent money that Bláithín would have cracked the first meat/jerk joke but alas I was proven wrong!
Do you expect to just sit here and pretend there’s nothing wrong with John’s face?
Irish People watch Classic Doctor Who (1963-1989, 1996)!
Awh poor John with his hurling accident, so glad you're all healed up now! ?????? you poor people being forced to eat more Carolina reaper products! ?? On another note, for those of you interested there's an official fan group on fb where you can interact with other fans and the TRY crew themselves! As well as being kept up to date on any new announcements and fan meet ups when the TRYers visit your location! Just look up "the official TRY channel fans," read the rules,  answer the questions and you'll be approved! ??
Ask for the spice... get the spice!!! #JeffOurHero
"I'm the Spicy Boy. I'm the one who jerks." Spot the Game Grumps fan. https://youtu.be/UkVMNRm7LGA
Nothing Is Hotter Than Johnathon's Mother!!??
Top video, guys. What happened to John??
Do the Paqui one Chip challenge if you haven't already.
john kid, you ok? but seriously though, its not cool for someone to look that hot even with a stitch on their nose, seriously you not human >.> love ya
wtf happened to yer face man? Hope ya heal up soon.
? Private
You ok, John?
Damm what happen to Jonny bullshit? His face is looking rough
Irish People React to Community!
Why is this video private???
It's always time to jerk off!
Where do grandpa get all this food to cook for so many? Must be a rich grandpa ????.
His Smile is Priceless!
An explosion of color, flavor and love??????
I LIKE SMILY FACE OFF CHILDREN AND UR COOKING GRANDPA I RESPACT U ALWAYS
Can't believe this video has so many dislikes! But whatever,,,,as long as I like it!
There's a special place in hell for people who dislike grandpa's videos
Why do they eat rice with their hands? Why do they eat on the floor?
super
JESUS CHRIST save JESUS CHRIST KING ??of kings

I think of adding some chicken or eggs would be perfect ??
how i love this grandpa ????
I wish I had this rice right now with sum salmon
Grandpa IS NOT cooking or stirring here SORRY TO SAY. He is just adding ingredients into the pot which are probably measured out and given to him by someone else. Check the stirring and wrist technique of the person who IS actually doing the cooking and also has an orangish red lakhri (string) on his wrist compared to grandpas NON stirring wrist technique.. . Grandpa nor his grandson are wearing lakhris here .That cast iron spatula cannot be used by grandpa too heavy for him he would of burned the rice at bottom of the pan. Just saying otherwise nice rice who ever cooked them
Huge lover from Indonesia grandpa is the best ????????
Man... All tgis granpa videos make me hungry.

Stop encouraging handouts. This is not acceptable. Have those kids help you out with cooking or around your farm. Let them know hard work gets you to where you need to go. No wonder your country is so backwards.
May god bless his soul ??I love watching him cook for those children??????..team grandpa

There’s this video going around about grandpa and his team and how they’re scammers because they use less money for the food and they keep the rest of the money for themselves. Y’all ever seen it? I support grandpa and I just want everyone to be aware of this.
May this guy live a 1000 years.

Melhor canal do youtube! O que melhor usa seus fins lucrativos ??
those kids are lovely. God bless grandpa and his family
I don't understand how young palates can tolerate such (to me) ferociously spicy food - the usual appreciative smiles seemed noticeably absent this time. That said, I have taken much inspiration from Grandpa to try new food and ask more questions at the local Indian food outlet. Purpose served.
??? ????? ??????
Job
Good
red chilis, green chili sauce, red chili sauce and Szechwan sauce. Don’t you think it’s too much spicy for these kids?
Siapa Dari INDONESIA !!!
piles mubarak
I really appreciate and respect what this grandpa is doing but the only problem is that you put a lot of spicy and chili ingredients into your food which is bad for the children's health that you are feeding.
I like it when he says ‘oil’ as ‘I’ll’
E Ardida tamvêm kkkkk
Ai que comida bunita devi estar muito gostisa kkkkkk
Yuum yummy ??????
Give the Grandfather a Sharp Knife and Glasses. I ASK YOU TO
Amazing
You did it again Grandpa. Looks delicious! You and your crew do a super job.
it uses too much bitter sauce and spices, how is it being renewed.
Can't describe how much I'm loving this grandpa and all the efforts he made for the orphans ?? Love from Belgium ??
Rice KO wosh Nahi Karna padta

So good
Harley is a damn national treasure!!
Big doinks KIDDDD
Maybe the pain was so overwhelming that someone was rushed to a hospital so maybe they didn't think of money and recording their shame
You should have topped the burger with Carolina reaper cheddar.
You guys are nuts
Sorce
That slap ya moma the best seasoning out I swear I could put that in anything
Bro that bleach quote !!! Doppeee
But. Does ramsay approve??
Anyone else notice they used American instead of PEPPER jack cheese
Next time, we eat napalm and a match made out of bacon!
I can handle so much spice with my mouth but my butt hole, oh hell no
"I came from the dark realm to hadle the spice" little further we seen all of them fucked up. Nice training! Id get back to the one who trained you
That bird at the till didnt give 2 shits about what you was doing lmao
Make it as hot as you want and I’m fine... but please stop using extract... it has no taste, no flavor (other than just metallic tasting), and adds nothing but heat. Rather than doing that, why not just add more jalapeño, more Habanero Peppers, more Ghost Chili, more Carolina Reaper, more Pepper X, and more of any kind to increase the heat AND keep the flavor. You can make it unbearably spicy while actually tasting good and not metallic-like, it is possible. And if you’re lazy, just go to a specialty shop with hot sauce and get some pre-made purées, sauces, marinades, etc. Just make sure the ingredients list things like “Carolina reapers” and NOT “extract of some chemical” Why would anyone want to take the flavor out of the heat source? The idea is for it to be spicy enough that you might not want to take another bite, but tastes so great that you can’t help but go in for more even though your tongue is burning ????
There toilet is gonna be on fire
guy in camo i so want your pink sperm lol god i love him he's my spirit animal
Despite the heat the burger looks so delicious
Drooooooooooooooooooooool!!! ????
You show the head captain’s bankai,because of that i subscribe to you
3:48 don't scare us like that
Wait he watches/watched Bleach?
Lmfao instead of putting sesame seeds like a BITCH I'm dead
Was your culinary qwetht worth it 7 million thscoville
My memes are more spicy
Smokin big doinks out here
They've switched to a new unit of measurement.
I like how we made a Zelda reference that's funny because that game is such a piece of f**** s*** that it's funny
are you from greec?
Carolina reaper + Dragon's breath
that bleach reference tho, subed right away.
Bleach reference? Spicy food? Subbed.
Muscles glasses
I subscribed because of the bleach reference ??
Brahhhhh, this looks soo good i fucking love spice and this makes my mouth hole water ??
Yama is 15mil
Should have used hot pepper/ ghost pepper cheese
That’s the principal out of video game high school
Boy ive been training for this SH(quack) my whole life! That had me dying!
The spiciest ekstrack is 13 m schovil
This channel is dead
Lmfao that Bleach reference
plain greek yoghurt is best for the burn and safe to shove into any and all orifices if needed lol
U guyZ R an Sum Feggits
Stay with the duck-quack guys! Works better than the real thing! :O)
Just fuckin eat it and shut up
Hes gonna regret being born cause of this xD
You wear the gloves yet you shove it in your furry hole face
Watching someone eat spicy food is kinda pointless without an aftermath video.
Ain't no Big Mac if it ain't from McD... Jus' sayin'.
bleach... goddamn normies. make a burger hotter then Seikon no qwaser. ( ?° ?? ?°)
It’ll take your fuckin life!
That shit looks dryer than Oprah Whinfrey.
toilets were hurt in the making of this video
DUDE!!! YOU GUYS COULD DIE!!!!
?????????? You absolutely nailed that Legend of Zelda reference!! The Hero of Time doesn't have enough Heart(s) to slay one of these Big Macs! ??
Should've used this cheese with it: http://www.vepocheese.com/en/products/cheese/cheese-with-sambal/11
B*tch boys ... wtf? How was it ?.... I jus saw that dude talking shit and running to the ice cream ... b*tch move dude ... show us when you guys cry ...
OMG Bleach reference foryou normies!!! wowowowowowow thats awesome well done
Iets 300000 scoville because iets mixed without tuingereedschap
Awsome video guys
But didnt use spicy cheese
Welp,Good luck for the toilet
Kiss me on the lips. Alrighty
Good effort ???? but the nuff would have finished that burger and had a 5min after burn with no relief ????
Make the cheese spicy.
That bleach reference hit my harder then chris brown hit rhianna I was so shook
Oh the dragon shits that come after burns just as badly coming out haha
Spicy cheese?
Big OL DOINKS
When I want a hot burger I just mix my ghost pepper powder and my scorpion pepper powder into the meat. It looks normal but is anything but normal. I have had friends raid my fridge not knowing what I had done. They instantly regretted not asking permission. Lol.
Spiceaayyy
Yessssssss!!! When you make the spicy stuff, I'll give it a try. Scotch Bonnet is usually as hot as I go but I'm in for anything. Spicy Mac N Cheese on a Quarter Pounder followed by airsoft is my diet.
2 month late happy birthday Harley
Why do you guys not use pepper jack cheese instead of that crappy craft which isn't spicy at all
What about the cheese does that have pepper in it
Love all the anime and video game references Harley makes. That's why I stay, not for the food but for the people.
I love it how he took a bit out of the pepper and the other guy like nope put it back lol
Yamamoto would eat that without sweat. But still feel sorry for you guys in the next John meeting. ??
how on earth do so many people subscribe to this chanel?
The fact that you watch Bleach is awesome
Thats' the first time I've seen them make regular sized meals.
“Fuck your self, eh? I’m soary.” We love Canadians.
I understand the point of this, but really couldn’t you have just done up the patty itself and still had the same effect on your mouth without making every inch of the thing insanely spicy?
wtf is this weak ass crew he is with now??
Cheese was normal. You could have used pepperjack. lol hats off to you for still being alive after that.
lololol
Cheese wasn’t spicy tho
man up dont cry like a bitchez
love that reference from bleach though it's genryusai shigekuni yamamoto.
That guy has lost quite a bit of weight and his English is sharper. Very nice.
7m scoville ain't shit! A ghost carries 850,000 scoville points over 1 mill ( Shu ) MAKE SOMETHING ACTUALLY HOT YOU PUSSY'S!
its Satans vomit kid you not bro
where the hell is Sean Evans in this production? lol
Another hot sauce video great, now we have 2000&1 to choose from and the climax a burning mouth
Really sucks this channel is pretty much dead??
Hey this is my first time seeing ur video wht is y'all thinking that is a lots of spicy good luck y'all insides r going to be on ??. Mo power to u.
Proud of my boi harley pulling that bleach refrence
Should a used habenaro jack cheese
Kiss me on the lips... alrighty lmao!!
I really wish I knew what that piano instrumental was at 1:50
Should've gotten pepper jack cheese
these burgers do not look good
Going to drop a like for that bleach reference.
The cheese wasn't spicy... guess you're gonna have to redo it.
What an analogy. Zelda - A Link to the Past. I just fell in love.
2:36 You guys uploaded this the day after my birthday!

Eating too much GAY BACON! MAKING YOU GIRLS KISS NOW!! Go back to manly food bros!

Epic Waste of my time.

Wow that is going to be one hot ** after that
What happened to the women, the pizzazz, the excitement?
RIP OLD YAMA
No peperjack cheese
Bearded twats
Harley caught me off guard with the Bleach reference
Aizen & Ywach disliked
Fake
This channel is dead face it.
Holy shit a Bleach reference. Sick!
Why ain't y'all use Pepper Jack Cheese instead of wEAk cheddAR???
To mix the death liquid better, make the mayo from scratch. Put eggs in a blender [you have to make it proportional, so it depends on how much you want]. Put a tiny drop of liquid death in there, per egg. Then close, open that little hole most blenders have at the top, and run the blender while /slowly/ adding oil. I recommend a flavorless oil. Add salt and pepper when it's done. If you're not sure, check out Gordon Ramsay's video on mayo. It's about as perfect as it gets. Best part of doing it this way is that the result should be more stable. Also, for big mac sauce, you shouldn't just make spicy mayo. Mix 3 parts mayo to 2 parts ketchup [make one of these a spicy variant for your goal], and also add onions, relish, white vinegar. Blend all that. That's the closest I imagine you'll get. Mac sauce is basically adulterated fry sauce. To replace the lettuce, maybe consider spicy kimchi. You can make that yourself, replacing the pepper ingredient with something like a ghost pepper flake. I bet you can get spicy pickles, too.
Knock off harley. Lame as shit
I liked this for the Bleach reference alone ??
More pepper doesn't make ensure more heat..the body goes in shock...cannot register. It's no good...it is just pain
Y you no use pepperjack? Amateur hour over here
Left a like just for the bleach reference ??????????
These hot sauce vids are really great
A drippin that devil saaaauuuuuceee
These dudes suck. I miss the old epic meal time
Yo.... He just used like..Almost a "1/4" of that Source extract...
You didn't even show the real result, real spice doesn't kick in until about 5 - 10 minutes after.
7:00 video actually happens ;)
Looks uglier with less hair
Where's muscles glasses ?
Dude.. 6:12.. How can you NOT put Monterey Jack Cheese with Ghost Peppers and Habaneros?
Yall trippin
how much food did you make and how much food did you eat? you guys suck, nothing personal. all you do is clickbait, clickbait clickbait. waste food waste food and puss out every show? Finish a challenge, any challenge. Stop being clickbait big mouth no show.
How's your asshole buddy
... The cheese wasn't spicy ...
why no spicy cheese?
Love your Prometheus shirt! Entertaining video also!
That bleach reference made me nostalgic :')
Gay alert
That is not 7.1m scoville 0.0, look at the concentration of the sauce vs the patty, it might be 5 m maybe..., but definitely not 7.1m. OR maybe you can actually do 7.1m scoville ;D by just tasting the sauce.
unbearable and fake ass bitches lmao
Bleach Reference is amazing
a Burger to vaporize even Ryujin Jakka itself
you guys are insane
Sean Evans doesn't listen, but maybe you will. Do. not. throw. up. after eating spicy food...unless you like the feeling of being pepper-sprayed from behind your eyes, and there's no mitigation for that. You guys appear to believe that tired old myth about your butts burning after eating spicy food then defecating. If that was reality, it means that your entire gastrointestinal system has failed. The heat in your stomach is perception, not reality, as your stomach actually has no sensory receptors. Apparently something sweet will mitigate the heat.(Ha. See what I did there. Still, it's true.) Finally, the perceived heat does not compound. No matter how much of the 7.1 million Scoville sauce you add, it stays at 7.1 million.
Cooking on a propane grill....? Fail.
Who else could smell the spice through the screen?
Only liked the vid for the bleach reference Wish they showed a lot more! Bring back the old crew
BANKAI!!!
I'm VERY disappointed you used pussy cheese instead of pepperjack
Man I miss the bacon N beer battered entree’s EMT !!!
Uh does dexter Morgan your double
HAVE THE LA BEAST ON YOUR SHOW AND GIVE HIM SPICEY SHIT!!
Bitch is sexist, you should use the gender neutral term Th-itch :P
You guys really need to extend these episodes. Especially your pot brownie one. The BEST part is watching you all after the fact.
Hahaha bleach
Anyone need me
Haven’t watched this but liking anyways this looks good
you know you're canadian when mans goes to sobeys (you know when youre from toronto when you say mans)
wtf that video ended abruptly. EMT isn't the same these days
this is bankai big mac
HOW ARE YOU NOT GOING TO USE PEPPER JACK CHEESE
Brilliant idea to replace the sesame seeds with jally seeds!
That bankai reference you sir are a legend
Had to like once you mentioned Captian Yamamoto
The cheese wasn't spicy.
Was it testrd by the science people to be proven 7m?
Ahhh... the bleach reference
You guys rock!
why aren't the aftermath reactions longer?
That shit was spicy as fuck ??????
They should've used pepper jack cheese... lol
And then they croaked, end of story
You used regular cheese instead of pepper jack? What happened to replacing every ingredient to make it spicy?
Maybe your quest shouldn't involve cashing in on the spicy food trend. How fucked is it that Harley appears on Hot Ones and now you guys are making spicy food videos with clickbait scoville titles. You guys know the scoville scale is bullshit right? Your channel has completely disintegrated, what a shame.
The cheese wasn't spicy
PepperjackMAC
Damn hotter than a bankai that burns his enemies and can bring them back to life as zombies? Damn that’s hot
"Someone's going to the hospital today." Likes video.
"It's hot eh" "I'm sorry man" True Canadian speech right there.
Why is this 99% build up?? PEOPLE WANNA SEE THE HURT
Boo ducks go sharks
y'all forgot the pepper Jack cheese??
RIP
So this is why i stopped watching this channel...
Bleach and Yu Gi Oh reference they already in 2020
the yamamoto captain of the 13 gote got me undescribable... and the shadow realm?
disappointing overhyped misleading waste of time.
Looks good
How is this Epic Meal Time? The video quality is shit and they went straight extract. "Look at me! I'm going to make something spicy by adding pure spicy to a crappy recipe" What happened? Where did the love go?
Must be in Canada, u can tell that cause there ain't no WHITE People.. ultimate fail Canada...
Yea for sure show the aftermath!!! Wtf no one wants to see a 9 min clip of making a fucking burger
agree with @ LoL Coffeemelt , I watch alot of pepperhead videos and really the most important parts of the actual eating the heat, describing the taste, experiencing the heat, possibly giving into the milk or champing it out with some sharp rapid breathing, theres none of that here in this video. So essentially people are just skipping every 30 seconds just to get to 15 seconds of actual entertainment only to be cut off from the substance of all your hard work gentlemen.
whats to say they didnt make a burger without all that spice and just ate that one on camera i highly doubt they ate the actual burger they made in the video
he should replace the cheddar cheese with spicy montary jack
Did you just Yamamoto?!
You lost me at the weeaboo stuff
You’re ass’s ain’t ever forgiving you guys
pepper jack cheese cmon
Where's muscles?
Yo these jokes are shit.
Next time buy milk lolly's first lol and make the buns thinner so can eat faster????????
Pffff ha ha watched bleach all eps. 2 times,. So Freaking Awesome,. Just like Epic????
He hears better now lol
R.I.P Butthole
What a bunch of losers!!!
Harley is a fucken beast DID YOU SEE THE EPIC BITES COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE ??
It's not that hot
The whole purpose of a video about eating spicy foods is to show the aftermath ??
Don't fuck with the source. Procedes to fuck with the source.
Epic!
Really surprised this has 7mil subs most of which must have come from the original crew. This sucks balls.
Its not a big mac unless you get it from fucking mcdonalds.WTF
Bleach reference ftw
Did you really kiss? Grizzly much?
Make 7 mil Scoville lube
sick bleach reference
next try caroline ripper
I mean hell, I'd eat it... Sounds pretty good actually.
I want to kill myself LOL
He forgot the pepper jack cheese
You do cut up stuff micky d’s just a few things

Give the rest of the food to the poor pls
Didn't even have spicy cheese, smh gtfo epic meal, fake spicers
Can't believe this shitty diaper still exist
The Sauce Boss can spit Bleach, but can he drink it?
im sad you didnt use spicy cheese. pepper jack at least
I didn't get any references because my laptop is broken has no sound and I haven't seen bleach yet
I’m trying to watch this lame fucking video but I can’t lmao
Lol thought these guys were a thing of the past
bites pepper is it hot enough? No put it back. ??????
Those buns look awful
Korea difficult
"let's take one of the best burgers ever and ruin it!" Good job guys!
Why do you guys end the videos 30 seconds after you eat the spicy food???? We're here for the aftermath, not to watch you guys chop up peppers!!!!!!
SG YAMAMOTO FOREVER!!!!!! RYUJINJAKA
Harley is on a Coke ????
I want this burger
Wait till you get use to the heat and really enjoy the taste
Everyone mentioning bleach reference, what about young king dave smoking some big doinks in amish heaven?
That actually looked good
lol it doesn't get hotter than 7.1 mil
Horrible Lisps
Pink sparm thats not normal
big doinks all day out in amish
Dont play with peppers then pick your nose
No chilli cheese? Let down
These guys are fuggin corny
Could have done some ghost pepper cheese or something
I’m disappointed they didn’t use pepper jack cheese
RIP Yamamoto :(
Hahaha pink sperm! You guys are awesome! ,????????????????????
Just over reacting
Nice job , now you know the feeling of a volcano when shot out of under the earth ??
Does making everything hot give you more views? Do some neeewwww stuffff already
Cameraman is getting all old and shaky or is it someone's girlfriend or mom
That bleach reference only the real recognize
Welcome to the Shadow Realm.
I love how this channel has stuck to its roots after all these years, but has upgraded its culinary game to people who can appreciate how to cook. Not suggesting you actually make these items, but is is great seeing as in relative to their early videos, these are close in proximity to actual proportions. It gives creative cooks a fun way to try cooking, but at a more normal level. People who love to cook, I'm sure you know what I'm trying to say here. Love your never more "sophisticated" menus lol. ?? BUT,we needed way more after shots in this video after all that buildup. Other that, great video.
.........The Cheese Wasn't Spicy
Videos that end too soon ?
That other dude with a bear Is a wannabe Harvey
This channel is still going?!
Pussy where is the pepper jack cheese
Looks like over cooked shit to me. Fuck me ... You can't even cook a burger?
Dyed beards looks so fucking weird
Why is the camera all overt the place? Jiggle, wiggle...christ. Horrible to watch. Watch your content back guys!
This whole spicy shit content is boring AF already. Just let the cow die.....
No pepper jack cheese/habanero jack........
just put a blow torch in your mouth and press the switch
for a Mexican this is nothing b*itch ??
THE AFTERMATH FOOLS.......
Beardo is homo 100
No bacon
Welcomee backkk
im so glad yall threw a bleach reference in here
Not a big mac... Wake up light up bang love Sosa go back to the astral realm
McWarning
You guys even infused the buns themselves with that stuff, way to take it to the extreme. From someone who loves spicy food, you guys are awesome.
So yall gonna act like bro eye dont look like he got hit with a sack of nickles.
Who r these guys what happened to epic meal time people
The cheese should have been a cheddar with habanero!
Cringe intro....
Thats not roosh v is it?
Extracts are CGI where real are Real. Gone With the Wind or Avatar. Both have merits, but real Spicelords know what is best.
...can you even consider this to be a big mac when you change everything? Like the bun is a good idea, the meat is fine as well, spicy cheese? Yes sir. Spicy mac sauce? If you want this editable probably not but for the video, sure. But thats it, keep the lettuce. Onions, and pickles. Maybe infuse spice into them but you gotta keep them in
Show finish burger or it did'nt happen!
I'm pretty sure there all stoners ..... dab it
I like that Bleach reference??????
Is it spicy enough No put it back
You know the worst part is that Americans use wipes to clean their butthole I once ate the spiciest pepper soup, and spent literally the whole day sitting on the water fountain splash thing that cleans the butthole whatever its name is
spot the hijab man canada is pathetic
My sperm was pink for 2 days LUL xD
Forgot to use habanero cheese
Well did he fucking die
that hot sauce is $150 wtf
you have not made the cheese hot. fail.
That bleach name drop though
I've had the source. It's hard to describe how hot it is in words. It made my whole face numb for hours.
Yo, we need more Bleach man
Use cooking oil to wash your hands of the pepper oil then wash the cooking oil/pepper oil off your hands with dawn
Why does dude have black eye? Lol
stop calling burgers you make yourself "big macs" you're not fucking mcds.
dude I fucking hate how hard that piece of shit w the lisp tries to be funny! bro not only are you not fucking funny but your voice is fucking annoying!, I was so glad to see u w a black eye TBFH
????????????????
Forgot these guys were still going
Spiciest Big Mac ????
I just noticed they didn't use peper jack cheese, but they have that pussy cheese
Tell spicy so much
The reaction needs to be longer
Oh EMT how how I miss you these new vids are just.....a lot blander then the OG ones. The passion isn't the same...hard to watch. get these bland ass millennials off and bring back the crew!!
The whole video is them prepping to eat the burgers. As soon as they take a bite the video ends? What gives?
What you used cheddar cheese i thought everything was spicy you should have used a good pepper jack.
I love your new videos more I just miss muscles glasses
They gonna have jet pack asses
Had to pause the video at the Bleach shout out I never expected from you guys. God damn. Could you get any better? (Also happy birthday. Hope you had fun on the toilet.)
Why does everyone in this video have a major lisp?
Krammer is a racist
that bleach reference tho
My mouth and throat hurts just by watching this video; that Big Mac is 7 times spicier than a ghost pepper!
what big mac. has cheese. i dont think ive ever had cheese on one
LA beast would just eat this like it's nothing
how many times are you going to make the same video? once something gets that hot, the reaction is always the same, and you've done what, like 50 of these now? Jesus H Christ, move on guys.
can someone tell me whats up with amirs eye?
All I have to say is WHY ??
???????????????
Thumbs down.. I can see that none of the burgers were completed.
So how's genryusai doin?? You meet him right??
nah this is nothing for mexican
overfed mofo ??
Who is this knockoff Harley?
These Guys shldve dental dams b4 eating this
7:41 how come the buns went from looking homemade to perfectly round. im guess they didnt show a reaction because it was faked
I'm with LoL coffeemate. Where's the aftermath takes man!!
Fake and gay
where the fucking pepper jack cheese?
Is that makeup in Ameers beard? ( ?° ?? ?°)
Just a drop will do.
AMIR IS FARLESS SERIOUS SINCE HE MET HIS WOMAN...COOL AMIR!!!
NO HE DID NOT SENRYUS BONKIA AS A REFFERANCE!!!
You guys don't over do it. You fucking MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION DO IT!
I wonder how many ulcers you guys got
Anime reference tho
The worst part is when you have to take a shit the next day ??????
You didnt execute the mustard and ketchup cool down method properly. Call Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels for details
how did you not use pepper jack?
Plutonium number 9 Burger. Do it like a man
Captain of squad 1 but ok
Best reference @ 2:50 ?? #BleachLove
Why not habanero pepper jack cheese?
What camera do you guys use?
Shout outs to the Gotei 13!! Love it!
That Bearded man snapping?????
didn't make the cheese pepperjack. you missed a spice opportunity
You sexy beasts...Keep burnin"
Is nobody picking up the fact that 7 million scoville units is a lie? It's fake hot sauce, google it. Click bait cunts.
You messed up, you supposed to put Jack Pepper Cheese
I miss the old crew. ??
I came across the source around 7 years ago. Bought a bottle of it and still have some left
Harley hates his stomach.
Holy shit that random ass bleach reference lmao. Right back to 2008
make a video with mike tyson ahaha
Hot water works the BEST
Harley is still hilarious...even with zero views. Maybe the lack of views is due to ligma??
275k views in 3 days with over 7 million subs.....Holy shit, what happened???
Dia org ni nak mati ke?
try to hard to be funny
Wait Harley watches bleach?!?! Is it possible to subscribe 5 more times?
you could've atleast melted the cheese
N e x t l e v e l W E E B s h i t
It's a burger. Not a big Mac
The aftermath is that they shit demons
Skip The Bullshit 7:00
Is this the guy from VGHS? Lol
Ohhhh boy “kiss me on the lips” aaaaaaalrighty

So you guys decided on the crackhead cameraman look to the video at the start? get a fucking stabilizer idiots
Anyone notice the guys black eye
Can someone fucking please help bring me back

harley should be an amazing commentator for esports or regular sports :D
I miss muscles glasses
pongan subtitulos en español
Overreacting??
Video starts at 0:00
Video starts at 0:00
"Every component of the burger is spicy " except for the bitch cheese you used...even pepper jack would have entered the slightest realm of spicy.
Liked for the bleach reference XD
I swear they did this before
Best Epic Meal Time Ever
Yamamoto Genryuusai will be proud of your big mac...
Amir got punched in the face? hahaha
Ok, so who forgot to wash their hands before going to the bathroom?
Remember when epic meal time was good?
Jesus....
Any new comers to this channel have noooo clue how good it used to be. Pounding beverages w muscle glasses and making family get together sized food. Miss the old school material. They’ve done very well though. Not knocking Harley. I’d be stupid not to trade my job for his.
The real question is, do you build up a tolerance when eating normal, spicy food, due to all the extremely spicy things you crazy MFs have consumed over the years?
U pussies didn't finish them
LIKED FOR BLEACH REFERENCE!
Good luck when it comes out
Brian ambs challenge
Happy birthday Harley!
What you know about bleach doe
the best beverage to control spiceness is Ades light Apple flavor
Fuckin casuals
I thought the meat would explode in the barbecue cause of the spices??????????
3:53 WTF where are the real men these days! We all know Harvey sold out and now likes it in the ass! I always knew Harvey was a faggot!
The intro was cringy as fuck, but the rest was alright.
Muscles Glasses must return
There still making money from these rehashed vids... clever basterds
I want that Kramer/eraserhead shirt
Who the hell are these guys? What happened to the original guys?
FAKE
Ass more wrecked than a gay porn star in a prison shower
BLEACH GANG WHOLE LOTTA BANKAI SHIT????????
more of eating it you bitches
I didn’t see spicy cheese!!
At this level of heat, I don't know if it's make a difference, but when you have something spicy and you're mouth's burning, it feels a lot better if you breathe in through your mouth and breathe out through your nose. Rather than just breathing through your mouth.
The bleach reference though
F**k i Miss sobeys !
The bleach REF was sick. Nice
Who’s the noob
Hey where can i get a superman batman mario shirt?
They missed the perfect opportunity to use pepper jack cheese
Knowing that Harley watches Bleach makes me happy.
You should to sign some documents , before to eating this BURGER LOL !
should have used spicy cheese too ;)
Those buns looked undercooked
BLEACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This channel isn’t funny anymore without Harley it’s just really awkward to watch with a guy who probably isn’t allowed around kids .
Should've used paper jack cheese
Bleach reference my day is made thank you for the first squad OG captian reference ????????????????
WTFFF making a Bleach reference?! God damn it I’m subscribing.
Get Mad Dog 357 Plutonium or pure capsaicin IMO. The Source is hot but it's not on the level, also shout out to Smokin' Ed Curry! Find yourself some fresh Reaper Peppers for onions... scotch bonnets are soft. That being said I do enjoy your spicy vids! *like
But you didn't finish it what a waste
Wow..... he is really phoning it in nowadays. Cant even be arsed to go shopping
Now you have to redo the whole video because you didn’t use pepper jack cheese
BAN KAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
harvey, you should be the next actor in cinema from 2020 to 2030, replacing dwayne johnson
The genryu comment made me more of a fan forever. Y'all aren't just jocks. You are my brothers.
cuts hot pepper for hottest burger but takes out the seeds, which is the heat...
B I G D O I N K S I N A M I S H
The cheese was changed also? Jajajajajajajajajajajaja
Lemon juice stops the burn of chilli
What??? Wait no no no no no... EVERYTHING IS WRONG THIS VIDEO IS WRONG! Where the bacon strips at?
Does amire(misspelled) have a black eye?
For the love of god guys please use gloves when you’re handling this kind of heat ????
It's all about those "pain points."
Wow) The murderous burger)
It was funny few years ago. Now its just patethic.
happy bday
Y’all running out of ideas
Shoutout to Harvey for the bleach reference
You could of used kimchi for a lettuce substitute
the guy with the lisp is so annoying and not funny. he thinks hes funny but he made this show boring . no wonder u guys are losing viewers and subscribers . boot the lisp boy
This account is dead months ago... for a account that has 7m subscriber, hundred thousand views indicates that this account is dead.
Yall werent supposed to put lines of it in though. You did it for the meat mix and the sauce. Probably used a quarter bottle and now its rest in peace to your rectum.
My anus hurts just by watching you eating these monsters big mac
See why didnt u get any Mexicans or indians to tell you this was a bad idea
This spartan vlog really suprise me . . Nc internet
It's EXTREMELY weird to see Harley now that I have fully watched Video Game High School. Calhoun rules!
Bleach reference lol, i love that show
Matt Stonie fucked yall hahahahaha I mean hahhahahaha
The bleach reference made my fucking night
I paused the video when bleach was mentioned just so I called comment bleach is AWESOME
guys what the background music at 1:42
what is the backround music at the ending?
honestly he should set something up with vice
Happy birthday Harley.
Im sorry bros, but you must need a mexican guy to try to test spicy food, werever you cook
You guys should get the cast of Letterkenny on the show now that it’s getting more popular.
"spicy big mac" gets more clicks than "spicy hamburger". u not fooling anyone lol
Guys it's time to just die with honor. It's hard seeing you guys scrape by with roughly only half a million views in average now. Just do the right thing and nobably retire.
Bleach
Love the bleach reference
Those aren’t Big Macs. You used real meat!
I hate the new guys, bring back muscles. This feels so fake.
Show used to be much better.
Matt stonie try talk shit, and he failed. What a gimp
Forget about what that does to your mouth then asshole. What the fuck does that do to your internals. And blowing loads?! Talk about hot burning love.
such a waste of food for literally nothing
Yo y the fuxk u didn't show the burn action that's the best park where they are in pain and suffering??????
Why isn't the cheese spicy? Could've gotten habanero pepper cheddar
this shit is not epic anymore
Gay
Scoville levels don't add you idiots!
I noticed some sauce got into the beards. That's gonna be interesting.
Since the video first began, I couldn't stop laughing
who the fuck are these dudes?
This channel is f***ing dead
Should have used pepper jack cheese...
WTF it's not even the real guys, wtf is this hustle s*it?
"(7 million scoville)" you used like such a little dip of it for all 4 big burgers and act like its super crazy. PUSSYS
fuckin rights
Prince Atari with a beard for the win!
No spicy cheese tho
The grocery store they went to looks like Sobeys @ Main/Danforth in Toronto
What the hell? You guys are still making shitty videos? I thought you all died after ur heads got huge and exploded because of that terrible TV show that only ur moms watched. I’m going to watch til the end and I won’t be surprised if it sucks
a little bit triggered that they say that the actual burger is over 7 million scoville, cause scoville unites represent the concetration of capsaicin in somthing, meaning that if you mix it with somthing else, it drops. so the burger itself is probably much lower than 7 mill
Fuck yeah bro Love the Bleach reference!!!
I JUST TOOK A TINIEST BITCH BITE IT FUCKKKKKKKKKK FUCKING FUCKS UR TONGUE LIKE A LITTLE MANS MAN BITCHES. (Spits it at camera) U HAVE NO CHANCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Jokes.
Weres the last dab ??
I LOVE THE BLEACH REFERENCE
you forgot the pepperjack cheese
Even the cheese was spicy?
Lol
you should add pepper jack cheese
I’m surprised you never used Mexicana Cheese Slices instead of regular cheese.
big mac and dropping bleach knowledge holy moly love these guys
yakno this channels only alive for fun but ill watch any1 eat a 7 mil scoville big mac.
Y'all used to be funny now you fags are eating nothing but hot food and acting like canadian internet douchebags your not epic meal time anymore

Worst part is the hot bread, I'd hate that shit in the most intense manner possible
Damn, guy at the end there without gloves too
Did anybody else realize there was no bacon?
02:50 actually im very impressed
It's fucking hilarious that I know EXACTLY where they filmed this (Danforth Village represent!!) Hell I can see my apartment building in the background at: 2:46
That is how big a Mac Big should be.
I feelbad for their toilet
Man...one dance with death was enough for me. Worst toilet experience ever.

“We’re changing every SINGLE ingredient” as the put on the unchanged cheese. Lol love you guys
Kramer is a racist and the video was shit, you showed barely anything
He uses gloves to put the hot sauce into the patty/mix of spices but he doesnt use gloves to put the meat onto the grill. Big mistake? lmao
Lol I fux with this??
This is like, dumb smart. Idk how that works but I love this shit.
Just put hot water and it gose away!! Stupid white people
This has more bird noises than a hunting channel ??
Legit forgot about these guys. Can't believe they're still trying to milk the channel

Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack quack
You guys get a like from me for that bleach reference also that burger like good as fuck
Did anyone else get the hungry jacks ad before the video started
7million scoville bigmac, 7 million subscribers

You guys are desperate eh
How far from the light you have strayed.
They've hijacked your show, Harley. You've failed us... all is doom.
Am I the only one that can't deal with buddys lisp? Ive watched so many of their videos and I still cant get over it
You could of used jalepinio pepper jack cheese
No me and him got the same brithday
So how long did u spend in the washroom
He pulled that bleach reference out his ass lol
You want the source to mix well... mix it with your wet ingredients before adding it to the dry for the bun...
Hello

"Kiss me on the lips." "Alrighty." Lmao
How'd you guys manage to make the mac sauce? I'm never able to quite nail it
Lol
Fuck that my nig. That's retarded hot. I took a bite of a cayenne pepper today and got the hiccups for 2 minutes
Does Amir have a black eye? Lefty? What happened yo?
You forgot the cheese
Ratings, ratings for the Bleach reference.
BANKAI!
I was first to put the comment about the source quite some time ago when they went onto the spice YouTube channel where and tried several hot sauces upto 1 million scolvilles now I will the first to suggest the spicer hot sauce of plutonium made by mad dog which is 9 million Scoville
I was so proud of my self when I beat link to the past ?? I was like 10 or so
This shit is scary
Those views are low asf.. Dead Channel much ?
Y'all didn't use pepper jack cheese...just sayin'
why didnt you show the kiss tho bro?
Kiss me on the lips
The bleach ref blew my mind.
Fire in the hole! ??
I used to watch this channel everyday but now it's shit the channel was good when josh was around but now that josh is gone this channel has went from really good to dog shit. I'm unsubscribing this channel is about to die. And Matt stonie just beat you at the KFC whole menu he just put the last screw on the coffin
R.I.P Genryusai Yamamoto
someone in canada didn't get the momo about Kramer
I like how all the peppers are pointless when you break out "The Source".
MY ONLY QUESTION IS WHERE THE FUCK IS MUSCLES AND GLASSES????
This episode is brought to you by "Cashmere" Toilet Paper
Well that was anticlimactic
Skinny stauches!!! Should be the new name , in ode to muscles glasses! You’re welcome.
Alrighty lmaooooo
I actually want to try this

Bankai! Love the bleach reference <3
What’s up with the shaky camera hands

How ya ganna put the dude with the hardest lisp ever in front of the camera... ITS SPITHY
gay
Y’all need to fire Amir
I LOVE GREASE
Can you learn to the the letter "s" correctly? Your shitty half fucked retard "s" makes me a little angry that you take yourself seriously. It's pronounced "eh-s" not "ethhhhh"
Where’s muscle glasses
Happy Birthday!
DAMN HARLEY DROPPING BLEACH KNOWLEDGE
where was the pepper jack cheese ?
Someone got their hands on a transition pack ??????
This channel needs more Harley....not the try hard gang.
That looks delicious ?? but, I wouldn't dare.
I need a montage of Ymir acknowledging the camera with arab music in the background
harley's burning ring of fire, it went down down down and the flames went higher, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
Usually Gavin McInnis is focused on political stuff. Good to see him eating burgers.
Harley once again going "Jack Bauer" on his prostate.
Bacon????????????!!!!
Shouldve went with pepper jack cheese
Happy Birthday yesterday Harley!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
Your videos just keep getting more boring and staged with over acting like in this vid when he tasted the mac sauce. I have watched you guys from the beginning and it just went to shit when MG's left. You PUSSIES need to watch this video (especially the flamer who tasted the mac sauce) and get back to your roots, rather having 5 min of shit on an 7 min video. Only Haley got through just half of his burger and others barely touched. ALL you should have sat down like men and finished everything there. Time to un-sub after all these years. Bye EMT https://youtu.be/q0i9pZnq29Y
Where you been drunk man,m haha you have been MIA in KOTD..
Rip doinks, yungkingdave is dead
Didn’t use pepper jack cheese? Maybe because it’s not the Big Mac cheese but STILL
Do a Bacon King like this!
And happy birthday harley, hope youre not too hungover on that Jack mc_Dagnals
where is the kramer shirt from? my girlfriend needs the eraserhead/seinfeld mashup
@4:44 The beginning of HARLey losing his sauce boss name......
Scotch bonnets are not that hot
Big Mac Sauce = Mayo, Mustard, Relish, Vinegar, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and Paprika. Try it. Fuck French Dressing.
Gross guy is groooosssss
R.I.P. YKD
some old school epic meal time hellll yeahhhh
Reduce all creation to ash, Ryujin Jakka
Those spicy Big Macs Look like they would make your body hurt for a very long time insane heat wow what a spicy YouTube video nice very nice guys
Gotta get some aftermath in there man we need to see more of you guys!!
Happy birthday Harley hope your ass is fine I’m sorry bro
A bleach reference???? Hell freaking yeah.
Your knowledge of Bleach is respectable.???
Damn I love spicy foods and would love to try this
Y'all it's 2018, get some reusable grocery bags pls
7:37 you are welcome
Spicy KFC
I want more bleach episodes.
Says changing every part of it to make it more spicy...puts regular American cheese on...smh
Id call it the BBC cuz ur inside r gonna get rekt
If this show has taught me one thing it's you don't hitler in an airport.
Shout out to 'KRAMER a character by Larry David' t-shirt!
No spicy cheese? smh....lol
'Spicy'
Some bleach love again? I always knew that EMT still had it!
I honestly forgot this channel was a thing
why didnt you use pepper jack cheese?
Petition to get Dan and Adam to act out their favorite scene from Grease.
Kiss me on the lips
This is not cool. Food should be yummy, not painful.
after enough of these spicy videos.. you would think they would learn that there is NO heat in seeds.. SMH one of the stupidest myths out there
2:11 are you saying that every time you touch it... you get... this feeling?
So the best is yet to come and right then you end the episode. It's like showing an intro and the intro is the end - fucking smart!
im casual shit
Did ya die thoe
RIP old man Yama.
weebs
Squad 1 gang weebs unite
emt is dead
Big Like! for the Bleach references.
I need to try this at home fr fr
So this is what a dead channel looks like
Shaguk!

Happy birthday Harley!!
B I G D O I N K
EMT never disappoints with the CONTENT!!
66k in 12 hours. You guys fell off. Should’ve saved some of your YouTube money instead of spending it all on food that you don’t finish.
Damn, you guys hate your toilets!
Well it looks like you might want to go home early today hahahaha amir is effin funny
Omfg so sand don't get a reward for that acting at the store line??? I died laughing
Why tf did they leave the chesse uncooked
I cant think of something more dumb than making a huge deal about how spicey something is then showing how spicy u made it then not showing the results
omg the bleach reference was amazing <3 love seeing you guys eat spicy food haha
You should collab with Shaun Evans again and cook with the Pepper X that would be amazing :)
Uuuuu loved the bleach reference
"Alrighty....."

You guys are nuts! You couldn't pay me enough money to even eat that spicy Burger there's no way!

Happy Birthday to the Boss!!! Love those gamer/lore moments Harley lays down.

2:54 lol pure awesomeness. ??Bleach
I see their moving off of bacon and onto hot shot... Very original.
EPIC SAUCE BOSS! WHAT DO YOU COMAND!
Let's see some Pure Evil capsaicin drops at 13 million SHU on the next vid. It's the next logical(?) step.
So that's why I keep finding peppers with bites in them!
A Bleach reference, huh? Your waifu must be Orihime, seeing as she does the same things with food you do :3
Happy birthday!!
BINGO....EPIC MEAL TIME SHOPPING BAGS, faces and all, couple versions, cheers!

Im curious: in so many “spicy challenges” about the only ingredient they never pour on is the “pure spice extract”, is it eating The Source in large amounts will legit send you to the morgue?
Shout out to Bleach!
The Bleach reference made this video for me
Old epic meal time was better where they made crazy stuff.
The only og that is left is ameer. I won’t be surprised if he was next the leave.
Change the epic to spicy in your channel name. The meals are no longer epic
Yamamoto <3
???????. ????
"Gimmie a kiss on the lips, alrighty" lmfao gold!
that's what i'm fuckin talkin about !!!
Shoutout to bankai.
Harley like spicy.
I loved the Kevin Connolly cameo
Wait, no spicy cheese? Not even pepper jack?
Always makes my morning, another great episode guys!
Why does this video start in the vegetation section? Epic Meal Time has hit a new low.
So fucking upset no peper jack cheese? You boys to pussy?
Why was the lettuce not replaced with Kimchi...
bacon kings.... sauce boss... and now turning into the spice your ass needs ice
Bleach reference!!!
U try too hard to be funny but u aren’t

Is that a Kramer as Eraserhead shirt?
Happy Birthday, Harley
I’m so glad you guys didn’t let this channel die when it started losing heat. Not as much heat as in that Big Mac though!
Good episode...but gotta call'em out on more or less recycling an old episode (Feb 12 2018 - World's Spiciest Burger (Valentine's Day Episode) - Epic Meal Time). Only real difference it's a big mac build.
Harley you made a bleach reference so now you are in my book of youtubers who will be godsend to meet along with markiplier, jackseptieye, and the game grumps bottom of the top 5 or 6 is Freddie wong for creating vghs which you were in like a boss
Hot ones ain’t got shit on the boys??????
Thanks for another great vid
Dead channel tbh
7m subs -7m scoville
Looks dry as fuck!??
Acually lime and dishsoap help with the pain
That bankai tho ??????
What the fuck, where is Harley. Why was he not buying the ingredients, this is bs... Youtube died when epicmealtime lost its fuego flava
Spicy everything and then regular cheese... HOW DARE YOU!
that's my Sobeys!
Shoutout to Harley for the Bleach reference! This is the Zanka No Tachi Big Mac!
ur gonna fuckin die
So good to see you guys coming back with new ideas
He need some milk ????

Happy birthday
The meat is heeling his eye fast (as it's so compact with nutrients)
So strange to see Harley not drunk xd

You should make another extremely hot burger and have L.A. Beast eat it for a crossover video.
Happy birthday Harley !!! <3
The spicy shit is over done! Go back to your roots of giant obsurd food!!!!! Oh, I almost forgot, Amir loves B====D
I love the Bleach reference.. Gotta say.. I'm a Kisuke guy myself
Says every ingredient is replaced with spicy, puts regular cheddar cheese on burger.
It's not that bad... French kisses ice cream for relief.
Where's Santos?
You'd be shittin blood after eating the whole burger ??
Your shits must be the worst after something like that
Lmao shout-out CPT.Yamamoto. A Legend???

Hello
Sauce boss saved the video
"kiss me on the lips." "alrighty" lol *sadly cries inside." the most beautiful bromance I've ever seen
Yo that Bleach Reference caught me so off guard !! Amazing video as usual boys <3
My mouth hurts just by watching
Did you sign a waiver before you ate it?
Did realize y'all were bleach fans, did y'all see the live action film yet?
- Kiss me on the lips. - Alrighty. Straight up killed me.
I also like bleach
Why don’t y’all use the hot ones pepper x hot sauce
Bro them dark circles under your eyes.
Booogie Woogie !
its time for a new outtro my dude
I am 80% sire i an down that burger in under 1 minute
For that bleach reference you earned that like boy
I would love for Harley to squat over me and explode the aftermath from his charred hairy bunghole all over my face.
Yoooo, that Bleach shout out!!
Damn this channel used to be the shit back in the day
Why would you mess with this??? It would be so miserable eating this
I promise to watch every episode for the rest of my life if u shout out my left boob
Hot Ones is quaking.
anyone else notice the marvel and dc figures in the cupboards in the background such as spiderman one over from the oven. Cool :)

Shouldn't they have replaced the cheese with Pepper Jack?
How long did it take gross guy to recover????????
Do you feel the PainTrain?
Happy birthday Harley .. smoking one for you souse bouse
I loved the ending with the heavy panting
I live in California so I haven't seen plastic bags like that in a while, now i gotta pay 10 cents if i want a bag, and the worst part is I remember voting for this to happen. Wtf was I thinking?!?!?
Yo cashmere toilet paper lol
Homemade edible pepper spray. That'll be awesome.
I saw boring cheese..
Dying channel BTW.
When adding scovilles, dont you find a mean, not just adding them together?
I want one
could have used jalapeno cheddar tho
With no hesitation Amer says Alllrighty. Hilarious!
Oh shit they shop at my sobeys. Im schleeeeeeep boi.
Do you still have a stomach after eating so much spicy food? I'm concerned about your health.
How can I do this
Juste pour la référence à bleach j'adore !!
You guys alive?
3 men were sent to the ICU for extreme burns to bring us this episode
Those buns are ass
Harley gives Prince Walla an apology kiss for giving him a blackeye
Hey Harley and the rest Of The crew could you do an Irish themed pizza on Tuesday 14 of August to celebrate my little brothers sweet 16th birthday. It would be awsome
No Pepper Jack Cheese?
Dude, Harley with the random Bleach AND Legend of Zelda knowledge. Heyo! I see you! I hope the Dark World Big Mac didn't kill anyone.
they must take hour long shits that go from trying to do something important to instantly almost shitting themselves
EMT is riding product placement pretty hard and long and fast all night

'Changing up every single ingredient'..... except the cheese. Haha

When your channel is dead you gotta eat food that could physically hurt you or worse. But now you said bankai and brought up the bleach reference you deserve your millions of views you guys use to get.

harming yourself for views, a major way to suceed on YouTube
you make this shit look so bad and sure it is but i watch people do this and they handle it a hell of a lot better than your pussy asses. you guys are weak making your 5-10 minute fucking videos... grow some fucking balls and eat something like this on camera with out edits you fucking pussy bitches.

These are some good samaritan boys at the grocery store! Also happy birthday Harley!
“...it turned my sperm pink for two days.” lol....next time you should find a vineyard that grows cubed grapes like those inedible watermelons, except edible and pointy delicious. Do a show on it. I’ll help, I got a grape tree. And little glass boxes, lots of them. Bring on the pane meats bring on the the plain. The rain in plain falls mainly on the grape, meter fuckers!
Nice bleach reference boi
Was he the principal on vghs
Happy belated Harvey! Mine past a week ago today coincidentally
first....wait
That was entertaining. Thanks for punishing yourselves. And ditch the Kramer shirt guy.
Weird, I was just thinking about that old dude from bleach
Harley has officially been bitten by the spice she is a cruel mistress
EMT is GOAT status
WHITE PEOPLE ARE CRAZY
Liked just for the Captain Commander reference.
Rip Yamamoto
So much fuzz about eating the spicy hamburger and you show only like one minute you're eating. Skip the video I would say!
6:09 'We are changing up every ingredient in here!' That looks like normal cheese sir. I feel lied to.
Wtf nobody Evan ate any?
Oh shit it's my birthday today too
I HATE, HAAAATE how you guys don't show the aftermath of these 'heat' related videos. You would get so many more views! C'mon EMT!
Where's muscles glasses
happy crow sound birthday Harley

https://open.spotify.com/user/gzkaatt/playlist/0ntMnoZfmmRhEm2jLDhjyk?si=Hx8nVtVySU6WgnGfQL7g8g
That bleach reference though!!
I'm disappointed...They didn't make the slice of cheese spicy
Where's muscle glasses????
I call BS! that cheese slice looked like regular american! :P
Pouring The Source!?! Man you are crazy!!
Yeah I burned myself twice with stupid jalapeños!!! Even after washing my hands 3 times I wear gloves too now haha my dick was on fire
vous êtes des grands malades ! you are so crazy !! omg !!!
I just looked it up and I had no idea The Source costs a fucking hundred dollars. I expected it to be kinda pricey, but Jesus. Also I want that god damn burger.
this was at main and danforth
You boys are so well behaved in the grocery store Cheers to you!
I see you with that Bleach reference
getting sick of the clown, wheres the red head? or dont you boys like girls?

Seriously these always come out at midnight when I'm getting stoned and drunk
I said God damn
Great video! Would you eat a porg with szechuan sauce? ??
Bleach reference i love it
Should have used jalapeno flavored cheese
Need bonus footage!!!!
Eating it isn't even the hard part.
Omg you guys are still around.. MUSCLE GLASSES!!
7:55 who the fuckin FUCK is this wanker?!? Gross guys new boyfriend?!?
Holy fuck id never expect them to reference bleach
I'd eat that. But I have pure extract crystals so the source ain't shit.
Looked fucking delicious but also very gay.
Why Sauceboss... why...? Oh yeah, cause it's EPIC!
Gonna like just for old man yama

A Big Mac that burns any of the calories it originally had.. brilliant!

If you think it’s bad now wait till you have to use the Bathroom ?? LOL ??
Wouldnt even do this for Donald Trumps whole bank account
Cacaw motherfucker early gang
Never get too lost in the sauce
I truly feel bad for you guys. You along with other OG youtubers have followed into the new 2018 trash content trends and now you're struggling to get out (or you're not even trying?). OG's can't just copy what's "HOT", you need to be original AND new again. Even though it works for these newer youtubers that gain millions a month.. that content is still trash. But it's the only thing kids nowadays will find on their feeds. Older people, your OG subscribers, just move on... how many years can they repeat watching the same thing? People have reason to complain. It means they want change. I respect that you still make videos but what's the point if you're just doing it for the money and not the entertainment of your subscribers?
Your pain and suffering on camera bring me great joy.
BANKAI
Uh? Anime reference in this channel? That was unexpected.
Nice video
This channel went to shit when muscles glasses left. These dudes aren’t good actors.
Feel the burn
Mamma Mia that's a spicy burger
HEY EPIC MEAL BOYSSSSSSS
Nice
Much love for old man Yama!
Sponsored by mcdonalds
8th!
what do you do when the big mac attacks you?
About to be so many comments no one will notice that I like traps
So spicy it might blind you
Epic Meal Time needs more epic videos like this. Not 100lb burgers
The bleach reference had my sides in orbit.
30 views and the 13th comment Julian was here !!
Shaboop!!!
I love spicy food??????
Dang
Yeet o my bonito
Big Mac is my go to burger. Why am I still awake it's 5am ??
First
Gang Gang
THATS HOT ASF
Epic
Hot... Literally
Nut
4th
first!
ligma Edit: I was first lick my taint
Steph it’s okay (I’m gonna get attacked for this) I’ve never even seen lalaland
Woot congrats on the 500k getting up there.... ??
On the 14 can you say happy birthday Emma because that is when my birthday is ??
Kid mukbangs are kinda weird
I think it's because she changed the future.
Wow. Typical. She goes for big white dicks instead of small Asian dicks.
Yummy share some
The only people I think of when she talks about small kids doing Mukbangs is the little girl from “The candoo’s” or maybe even Aubrey London
Steph taking forever to get to the story reminds me of jknews trailing off and Tiffany introduces the story hella late into the video then the video ends.. anyway I LOVE YOU STEPH HOPE TO SEE YOU MORE ON JKNEWS
please do more with asmr
“wait there’s cheese inside” “um it is a mozzarella stick” DEADDDD????
I miss blockbuster!!!!
i hate lalaland too lmao
She has pregnancy brain Yall ??????
I agree with the kid mukbang think
You should watch The Candoos, they put two year old Beatrix in front of the camera.
what’s the movie name bih
Stephanie you need to watch Game of Thrones! You will be shook.
I feel so happy whenever I watch Steph eat and her energetic personality it makes me feel good????
This reminds me of the Truman Show. Maybe she was recorded since she was born and it could be possible that people watch her tapes/life like how people watched the Truman Show on TV. Since she disrupted that, she ends up going crazy and in jail?
Omg you are wearing Zara kids top bitchhh
or maybe you’re just asian ..??
stephanie soo is cancelled
BISSSSSS I COMMENTED HOW TO DO IT LAST TIME AND NOW STEPHIANCÈ TOLD YOU ***** TYPE SOMETHING ***** BOLD
Where is the story from
Kids ASMR are not good to watch... sorry is it only me?
Omg which place did u get this from? It looks so good!!!!
whats the name of the movie can anybody find ittt
I deadass think this is the best channel:)I love you and your stories.
You are theeeee best story teller! ???? I love it!
STEPHANIEE WHAT IS THE MOVIE
What's the movie? I'm dieing
You need some chopstick holding lessons from your boyfriend
yeets
“i’ll have him practice the downward dog.......” it’s also a sex position ??
I hate Lala land too ??
Stephanie, your not the only one who didn't like la la land, but for different reasons
PERIODT
the ending to this video is so cute hahah
Did anyone hear her friend say oh my god on the low as she Yelled?
Wow your Korean pronounciation is perfect
Please start listing where you get your food.
*I freaking love your videos
illuminati confirmed hahaha
PLEASE! I WANNA KNOW THE NAME OF THE MOVIE
You should do more mukbangs without your fiance. Seems like your fiance is there to help you with the food. You don't eat much.
Hell yeah I remember Blockbuster bisss!
Kid mukbangs are so cuteee but u do u boo
Me too, i hate LA-LA LAND !! ?
Movie title pls! ??
what restaurant did she buy this from? i want to try this when i’m back in ktown ??
Somebody tell me the movies name
Until then
I would rather when how I die...so I can live positively and happily
I think it's because she altered her destiny, that's why she got that ending. That's the reason why human can't and shouldn't know their future ahead of time, I think. And yes, I will return the dvd right away. I won't fight destiny lol.
Where did you get this food?! Craving it soo bad I live in LA ??????????
I didn’t like La La Land either ??
We all really want to know the name of the movie it would be great if you could tell us all lol
What’s the movie called ?!?
biss what’s the movie’s name D:
What I learn from all these stephi’s mukbang vids is that stephiance is able to counteract stephi’s craziness so well and that’s why I ship them so hard ?????? LOVE U GUYS!
Which place in ktown?
What movie is that
this story is so good than lalaland LOL jk
Where is it from?
So Loki?...hehe
OH YEAH AND what’s the title of the that story called??????
You’re a good story teller that I was getting so paranoid that someone was watching me that I had to turn my back to the wall of my bedroom????????????
I love her personality
Xx
I really wanna know the story behind your husband always hiding his face ... ps in New here in case you have already explained it lol
Omg, my favourite lines. “She’s got bags under her eyes and their not designer.” “Oooo you theifing ass b****” And “all I got from this was...don’t skip episodes!” ??????????????
whats the place called?
JSJJDNDEJDJDBDBDBDN WHAT'S THIS MOVIE CALLED PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW??WHAT IT AHHHHH WE'VE GOT ANOTHER FAN GIRL/BOY but really I need this movie

This story felt like a black mirror episode ??
I really want her to make got7 marks recipe it always looks so good
I'm with you bisss and your unpopular opinion on movies, I getchuuu
The ramen packs are 2 servings. The cup is 1 serving. i was confused too until i looked haha.
Lmao, Captain America is actually going to die.... ??????????
hi (edit: thx to stephanie’s fiancé for teaching me how to comment in bold!!)
Omg!!! It looks DELICIOUS GIRLFRIEND!!! You should definitely invite me over ??????????
OMG THAT STORY BLEW MY MIND.....you tell it soooooo good. I think if I had the choice i would watch the first couple tapes and maybe just maybe watch the first future tape. but after that i won?t because then it would change my view on life and the experiences with it so yah. lol GREAT VIDEO BTW IM SOOO SUBSCRIBING !!!
Blockbuster was the shit, I miss is :(
The guy in your yoga class may have been practicing lions breath
I remember always trynna sneak into the 18+ area in Blockbuster because a friend told me there was games and candy inside
THIS IS PERTINENT TO THE STORY
Cancelled
going into blockbuster was paradise ?? having an endless selection or movies and games
Conspiracy theory idea, Dude who survived Las Vegas shooting died in the California bar shooting. Fate?
yess bisss blockbuster was my hobby. hahah I used to spent hours there but it was funn I guess now you spent hours in your bed waiting to see which Netflix series or movie you'll watch. But that's boring. hahaha I didn't like Lalaland either I have tried watching it several times and I have fallen sleep.
I freaking love banana milk. Being on JK must be fueling distractions from the main topic lol. You belong there
You’re such a good storyteller. I’ll be getting ready for work listening to your channel lol I love it!
also, i hated la la land. it was the worst.
Subscribe and watch my recent and I’ll do the exact same to you!! ??
CAN YOU PLEASE TEACH THIS WHITE GIRL HOW TO USE FUCKING CHOPSTICKS?!?!?!? :'( :'( (lol)
PPUUURRRRRFECT~~~~~~~

you need more subscribers people should know about Stephanie Soo
Yaaasss BISSHHH
Stephanie you're a great actor love my comment please ??
But what about Mama Mia??
N.E LETS EAT
Lala land was soooo boring
?????? ??????? yes I know blockbuster ??
I don't like la la land either. The visuals are great but I don't like musicals either. Like I love frozen and animated things like that but I agree that it's so cringe when they just go back to talking after they just burst out singing.
I would stop from dvd nr1 cuz I would be so creeped out!! Am too careful
FUCK
THE
i agree with you lalaland rant ?? love the soundtrack but not the movie
Omg i also hate Lala land I hated the ending ugh
who else find her annoying ??
I can't take it anymore!! Every comercial that plays on your videos is a tai lopez 17minute one!!! I dont know if I love you enough to watch and not skip them biss :D
Ya I think blockbuster and redbox are the same thing it always in front of like Walgreens also love u steph
So is blockbuster like Redbox
Bissssss What’s the name of the movie?? Somebody help!!

Don't EVER skip episodes!
#Stephanie soo where did you buy your water bottle??
please omg can someone tell me the name of the movie she was talkin abt
what’s the movie called tho?
I hate lala land too
This is more of a talkshow than a mukhang. Shes done more talk than eat.
This is a test for commenting in bold Edit 1: This doesn't work Edit 2: Oh nevermind I just came back from a YouTube tutorial on this
OMG I THOUGHT IM THE ONLY ONE THAT HATES LA LA LAND
DONT MISS ANY EPISODES
Good story.xx :-)
Nothing good ever comes with messing with that bc then you want things to happen that way so bad or you work towards it not happening so bad it happens bc you already know it’s gonna happen it’s messing with bad karma that’s why you live every second as it comes
1000000000% agree about kid mukbangs
yess I finally learned how to comment in bold HAHAHA thank you!!
My dream is to eat with you tbh
wow
Only true fans use the word biss, lol myself included
I enjoy the videos but I really can’t take your chopstick skills lol ?? it bothers me so much. Idk why
I would've never even watched those movies ??
lala land sucks
The company releasing those tapes would be for profit prisons ??
Lmfao the perfect rectangle
Is this video making you Hungry? 0.0
have you guys ever wanted to right a comment but didn't know what to say so you just didn't say anything
Was this a real story?
I do like cup ramen lmao!
Can you mention where exactly you get these dishes so a sis can go and buy some for herself??
I love the little noise Stephanie makes when she stuffs her face, and it’s really good ????
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE MOVIEEEEE
Blockbuster??
What is the movie called?? I'm going crazy looking for it :(
i think the lady died because she got too curious and obsessed about watching the tapes, because she was so obsessed about watching #9, THAT led her to her doom. If she just let it go and shrug not being able to watching #9 she would've been fine and wouldn't end up going to jail. Like they always say; "curiosity killed the cat".
the fire breathing dragon guy from yoga bit made me nearly spit out my milk tea all over my keyboard
What movie is this I’m so interested !!! Love your videos steph !!!
Tanggang!!??????
35:55 VW anyone? No? Haha sorry
I think number 9 was the current time for the women and that she was living through number 9, so mabye it was rented because she's in it
I ended up making dukbokki and pork belly for dinner just because I watched your video from yesterday and this one. Satisfied! :)
?? hi
Honestly, you’re the only mukbang channel I watch ??
I HAVENT EVEN SEEN LA LA LAND BISSH ??
Love how your fiancee is so open to eating with you with anything.
Am I the only person going crazy because I can’t find the film she’s talking about???
Bruuhhhh I just realized that you don’t even need music to make your videos exciting because your personality is so entertaining lol
Girl where in k town ?? ????????
Does anyone know what the film is? Thank you’ also love you biss, your stories and mukbangs are my favorite ??
I don’t like cup ramen because of the taste of the cup lol
testing
Can we seeee stephiance when u hit 500k:):):)

Been googling the name of the movie T_T Can't find it. Help!
Where do you get this at!! I live in cali and i really want to try this!

Fan mukbanger
I’m crying... when you rolled your eyes so hard to your fiancé at the end. LITERALLY ME when my boyfriend doesn’t agree with me ...??
She could have just asked them to hold it,
Elon musk stepped down
I tasted it before and It was so spicy lol
But what is the movie tho?
I also wen to Yupdduk LA but girl the mild for me was way too spicy and I actually do spicy.
I really want to try some!!! But I don’t know anywhere near where I live where I can buy some.????
I KNOW WHAT BANANA MILK SONG YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. and honestly the story kinda spooked me but that's also bc I'm a scaredy cat asdfgh.
i love the lights in the background stephanie! ??
that looks really freaking good. i mostly wanna try the fried veggies ??
I'm not on board with kid Mukbangs because they're so awkward to watch. Also, there are some channels where you can clearly see which child is their parent's favorite. It makes me feel so bad. Especially when they're all together and one kid just sits there silently because the other is the center of attention. ??
Kid asmr is a bit iffy but mukbang is just eating
omg this creeped me tf out
biss the lights are so beautifuuul im tellin you biss you are so good at this
Actually I did not like it too. I could not watch it till the end.
Omg where did you get the poor tuna rice bowl? That’s everything I want now.
You should travel to korea and have a food tour
When I'm reading a book. I always read the last page. I have to know if it ends happy before I actually read it.
please what is the name of this movie???
bold strikethrough underscore
Loving the twinkles in the back ground Biss! Xoxo
No think because she changed her future, destiny self corrected itself and put her in a no future scenario!
Am i the only one thats says the intro with her ?????? i love you bishhh
I'm convinced that mr mango butt is really marshmellow that's why we cant kno him
Queen of slut nation
Omg Steph you're so close to 500k????
Are those raw tuna or like canned tuna?
shrek the musical is an undefeated musical
I hate lalaland too you're not alone
I love this!
i’ve been wanting to try rice cakes but there are no places to get it around where i live :( and i live an hour away from LA so no one will go with me that far lol
I've always wanted to know 2 things from her: 1. Whats her lip product?! The color is so pretty also it stays on the lip forever istg 2. Whats that pink donut thingy at the back seriously tell me?!!!
How is she not at 1 million subscribers yet all you bisses need to subscribe
Funniest yoga story! ?????? I would have died laughing ??????
That was a crazy story omg ??
???? ???? ?? ?? ????
I study in a film academy and trust me la la land is real shit
Without watching the video go to 12:28 ?????????????? I'M GONNA DIE ????
Next March design “THIS IS PERTINENT TO THE STORY” ????
I love that the milk says low fat milk meanwhile this biss is eating pure carbs ??????
ive never watched lalaland ??
This was a creepy story ugh! Glad BlockBuster is closed lol I used luv that place, they had a lot of weird video's.
Stephanie you’re so dramatic when telling a story .. I love it ????????????????
I would not want to know at all when or how I die. Butttttttttt gun to head I'd choose how bc knowing when I die would give me a heart attack bc then it's like I'm just waiting for the day. If i know how then at least I can dodge the paranoia of it. I would be upset if i knew when i was gna die and it was like within a year or something.
LMAO I hated la la Land too. ??
I also hate when they start prancing around singing!????
This looks so good! Which restaurant is this from?
Bisssssss! You gotta film a Persian food mukbang!!
Lol, i never comment but I have to this time. Anybody realize that Stephiance had 1st egg then he asked Steph if she wanted the 2nd egg, Steph said it was still steaming so “can you put it outside” then continue with her story. Stephinace end up picking up the 2-half of the 2nd egg. ?????? i just think that is so cute!!!! :))))))
She always laughs at his broken English lol You're gonna born
Imagine if Stephanie’s fiancée turned out to be dong from keemi
What do you put in your counter to make it sparkle like that?
YES!!!! I love when steph speaks Korean!!! ????
I didn't like La La Land either, it was boring af. Most overrated movie of the past decade tbh
Is it weird that am 17 and I used to go blockbuster like all the time lol??????
By the way Capitan America can die in the next movie, because Chris didnt sign the contract
wait omg i'm the same tho i cannot go watch a movie at the theatre if i hate the ending kjabsdfkjbagkbja
bisss, what is the film?
Takes me almost an entire day to finish your video when you upload ??
Yeah lala land sucked
this was such a good storytime bissss
And im sitting here eating a hit pocket???? it’s still kinda fire tho??
HOW IS SHE SO THIN JAKCKSSK skfkskakak
hi
I think this all happened because she watched the tapes and couldn't let go :-|
??? ?? ??? ??????!!!???
i used to go to blockbuster ALL the time and i’d never actually rent anything i’d just walk around looking at all the DVDs
What’s better,that guy who eats with you or food?
Hi I love your videos! There I comment in bold ;)
I just noticed the pretty lights on your right background I love them ??
BISH OMG!!!! I hate La La Land too!! I love you even more ????
She was gonna end that way or another. She did not altered the future or what, it was her future to skip the episodes. It was her future to do all that so that the video can come true. Love your video, sm.
The whole situation would have been solved if Chloe had told the people working at the Blockbuster to call her when the ninth DVD comes in and put it on hold for her, without ever watching the later DVDs
Gorilla sound and rectangle mouth ?????????? man im crackin up like siiiit
Girl you need to refer to another successful person other than Elon Musk??????
????LMFAOOOOO ”Don’t skip episodes”
Hey Stephanie! I have recently just started watching you and I can’t stop!! Your stories are always so interesting and your food always looks so great!! I’m glad I found your channel!!! Keep up your amazing work!!! Thank you <3
What's this movie?
I think everyone’s destiny is death and I would know rather know when I die that how I die
like disssss
Steph... What date is your birthday date this month?
You are sooo underrated???
PLEASE DO A UNDER COVER FAN PAGE ??
either she would hv to deal with her fiance walking out on her if not a bigger problem came her way....it only got worse
I didn't like LaLa Land either. It was so dang slow haha.
gurl same! i thought la la land was mediocre. i went to see it with a friend whom i thought was enjoying it but as it turned out he hated it more than i did lmao we could’ve just seen another movie then
Peed myself laughing at the yoga story
Your videos always manage to put a smile on my face even when I'm the crankiest. I'm currently busy with my finals... so i may or may not have been watching your videos EVERYDAY now... ??
YES, I WILL MARRY YOU
I'mma trigger some people.... Our BISS is CANCELLED ????
The way you are describing the man's breathing it seems like he was doing "dragon breathing." We teach kids to do it to get out excess energy and to "breathe out bad emotions."
I dislike kid mukbangs/Asmr channels, I hate them so much honestly, they’re too young and it’s dangerous on the internet. I honestly think you shouldn’t be able to post videos if you’re under 15.
I miss blockbuster
I think some kid mukbangs are cute but I kind of feel like a perv watching some little kid that's not mine
please do your fiance's face reveal!
I have a feeling I know who Steph doesn’t Stan. That particular mukbang family ??????
but how come the girls that she overheard in the bus that also watched it didnt die????!!?!! so many questionsssss
Tbh I think more of the people watching kids mukbangs more than the kid doing it.
When she started telling the yoga story about the guy making noises when he breathed out, THIS is all I could thing about ... https://youtu.be/HsvyjePPFRs
Tbh I didn't like La La Land either :/
I hate musicals too. And I hated La La Land. ??
12:53 creepiness
I'm actually not a fan of little children mukbangs... not even because of the parent and business relationship but because adults can consent to eating such large amounts of food and accept the consequences but its so unhealthy for children to do so... In other news... THOSE RICE CAKES LOOK BOMB AF
Can I Call You Stephie
STEPHANIE
steph: I am a full blown korean mukbanger stephiancé: but you are a- korean mukbanger nervous laugh
"Anytime o drink it with white People" bisj you mean Americans. Stop acting like all white people speak only English. I swear, Americans are all about that casual racism...
I HATE kid mukbangs.
I have the same opinion on musicals ??
that don't you leave me moment almost killed me ??????
after hearing stephiance speak chinese im suddenly curious about how stephs intros would sound in chinese xDD
PleaSssseeeeeeeeeeeee keep ur distance drom the camera like this foreve
Oh my god I haven't watched mommytang in a while
"don't skip episodes." I felt that
that banana flavor in the milk comes from isoamyl acetate. i just did the experiment to make that last week lol
im pretty sure i know which one you dont like, it must be Mak, that red head girl, i find her extremely uncomfortable, i feel like alot of her subscribers are pedos and it creeps me out
i believe in destiny so yaaa all ways takes you to that last point or if your destiny is to be in that place you will be either youre a murderer or a police officer for example?
A mukbang video with David So and just speaking Korean to each other would be awesome ??
IM SO PISSED IM NOT EATING THAT RIGHT NOW
lmao theres so many ppl in the comments asking what the movie is ugh i wanna know too
this is pertinent to the story that should be a T-shirt ????
I think it’s because she altered it
did she just spoiler me black panthers death
"Gorilla Noises" ????
when she said the milk reminds her of a song, I thought she would sing Power Up by RedVelvet.........
LOVE YOU
i remember blockbuster... my mom used to work there and once brought me home a hello kitty vhs movie, and i loved that movie so much i hid that shit in my bed LOL
I fucking hated Lala land it was SO BORING! I usually stick a film out to the end, but I had to turn it off lol.
BISHH WE NEED MORE RICECAKE MUKBANG
I thought I was the only one who didn't like La La Land!
Right after infinity wars ended, I checked IMDb to see who was listed in the cast for the next movie. Everyone is back. Worst. Kept. Secret. Ever ??
Bisss I was born in 2002 and I remember those vhs players
I absolutely agree with you about kids mukbangs, those videos really piss me off. They simply are not capable to give an informed consent because they don't know what it really means to them and the possible outcomes. They are not doing it for money, I highly doubt that they do it for pleasure, they're just doing what their parents ask them to do. Those parents really need to think twice before putting their young kids on social media, especially mukbangs, it's feeding into pedophile culture.
i missed stephiance!!
"Don't skip the episode" omg so true Stephiance. once i skip even only one episode of every dramas i watched, im just gonna stop. i don't even finish them until i get to watch the episode im supposed to watch ??
I love you queeeeen ??
Gosh the cheese looks so good!
Is that a movie she talked about? And if yes does someone know it’s name ?
Lala land sucks honestly
I dont know have you seen yummybitesTV, not just having they kids (teen) to do mukbang regularly, but it really bother me when I saw they try to get their 7yr artistic kid to do mukbang... not cool
what is the movies name?
sameeee...i'm not a fan of Lalaland!!!
The whole time I was just staring at Stephanie's big ass chopsticks. ????
For my sanity can someone give me the name of the movie she was describing??
WHERE DO YOU FIND SUCH GOOD STORIES STEPH?!?!
I’ve noticed that Stephanie doesn’t know how to hold chopsticks properly
how is stephanie talking with all of that yummy food in front of her.... is she crazy? my mouth is watering.
I love your videos Steph! but the crime and horror stories are almost in every video, maybe sharing some different stories? ??
Great start, sis??????????
I Hate lalaland xDxDxD
I need those lights on your counter , it’s so mesmerizing
Omggg what’s the movies name? I want to watch it
I like the lights on the counter
Kids mukbangs is good for kids... Cause a lot of kids don't like to eat or don't want to because a lot of reasons... Not good ones. And i think when kids see other kids eat it makes them wanna eat
Cancelled
too much talking tsssss
500k all the way soon???
i don’t like it when humans are singing HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I haven't watch the greatest showman
Don't worry I don't like la la land and high school musical
Im 15 btw love your video's though you always have me dying in laughter
Steph should do a mukbang entirely in Korean and add subtitles for us bisses who don't understand. Just a kdrama and kpoplover speaking ??
what.. Chloe in Japan? I'm scared :(
Did anyone realise she changed the thumbnail
Can anyone link the story to me about the woman
I agree with your hubby if she would have waited for nine and not skipped then she would have been okay but since she skipped it she fucked her life up.
*what I commented this hearing stephiance said on how to type in bold and it does not work. I am too dumb for internet
Is this from YuppDuk ? I think that’s what it’s called
I so agry with you on lala land... I couldn't go through the half of it... I even thought about giving it a second chance but I just don't like "musical" (unless it's a thriller)... Maybe it's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it
Thought she was going to sing 'Power Up' by Red Velvet
bitch are you those kind of people who watch the endings first and skip all the plots and suspense? CANCELLED UNSTAN ssksjdksjds
lol that movie you were talking about reminds me of the Truman show
The tapes altered her future. The missing episode was on purpose and thus her end was inevitable. That's my thought. Honestly though, I thought she was in jail cuz she killed the boyfriend or something.
I hate Lalaland too, it's so boring. But I love High School Musical still.
I hate Harry Potter
Love yah steph!!
I didn't like la la land either... dont understand the hype
I’m dying to try this dish !! ?? but I live in South Africa and can’t seem to find anything similar. I even tried to make my own from one of your videos but don’t think i got it right because of the ingredients ?? But a bisss makes me hungry x
hey, I recently saw a spicy challenge called the Culley's hottest ramen challenge, it is supposed to be the spiciest in the world. they said it was hotter than the 2x. maybe check out the videos to see if that is something that you would try???
Hi Stephanie, I've never really commented before, but just wanted to say thank you for everything you post on both of your channels. Your videos are the best part of my day, I turn them on when I need to smile or just to feel less alone. You're always there. Keep making great videos, and making people smile. Love ya bisss ??
oh mai watching ur vids everyday has actually made me a happier person!!!
Soooo trueee about the musicals!! hahaha
Your intro lol ??????
I think the number nine DVD with her waiting outside the store for the DVD to come to the store but since she never saw it she didn’t understand in the moment that she was living out DVD number nine
LMAOOOOOOO THE GUY BREATHING OUT LIKE THAT HAS ME DEAD
I THOUGHT I was the only one who hated lalaland holy shit , and the thing is I LOVE musicals but Lalaland was the most boring musical/movie I’ve EVER SEEN I NOW FEEL MORE CONNECTED TO U BISSSS
She said ..umm I'm busy right now and looked like..ummm TF!! ????
Bis you need to cook more then mukbang I miss those
I also didn't like la la land!! Definitely unpopular opinion
lmaoo am i the only one that notices steph switching her chopsticks
like if you want me to email her a story of my mother's plus my 2 brothers and i life, she had passed when I was 16 tho so this is just memories of what ive been told plus grandmas memorization 0n it but it's how me and my 3 brothers all have weird father stories oldest who father had died and been adopted never met, one who had died and who got murdered while my brother was their and finally one who was a physco abusive stalking kidnapping father.
You're so pretty and funny ? new subscriber here!
The story is from japanese ???????? xD
Since you like xiaolongbao so much. Here is how to make a giant dumpling! https://youtu.be/dA2MzbrXcAQ
Him: Does your mom tell you not to play with your food? LMFAOO I ALMOST DIED AT THAT QUESTION LOL ??
I have so much love for you guys. Wish I could fly my ass over there and eat with you. Completely agree with you about kids doing mukbang. Lost my mind laughing about the yoga guy! ??????
"The bigs black blox." ~quote by Stephanie Soo, describing a vhs player (2k18) @ 13:59 like what is english ??????
What's the movie though?
Stephanie Soo is that BISS ???? for the best mukbangs with BOMB ASS storytimes
Steph's goal in life is to get the perfect cheese-pull! LOL
<3
You're right about the ramen. Cup ramen is only 1 serving. The packages are usually 2 servings worth.
You should try Turkisch food! Its SO GOODD!!??
Was it just me that was staring at that one mozzarella stick that looked like a pimple?
Where can I buy myself this dish?!?
Omg mommy tang I miss her. I never knew what happened to her.
You made me laugh with the yoga story
@40:38 Stephanie - "Well you know me, I gotta make this boy's dreams come through" LMAOOO????
Stephanie is my favourite mukbanger of all time ?
This story was so interesting ??????
I dnt like it either!!!
I dnt like it either!!!
I heard u said potato milk I think????
id just watch the last DVD episode to know the ending then leave the rest of the episodes out and just watch how my life progresses to get to that final episode
Yoga in America is incredibly Americanized lol Most classes make people think yoga is an exercise, but its not. Flexibility and strength is just a benefit of doing yoga, its meant for you to access a deeper part of the self.
PLS STOP SAYING BANANA SO MANY TIMES HAHAHAHAHAH, I cannot help it but think about Power Up, Red velvet's song and sing it myself... It's 6:35 in the morning, my mom is going to kill me HAHAHAHAHAH
Omgosh bisss this looks damn yummy!! Great video!! Much love ?????
She shouldn't have followed that lady clearly that will land you in jail. He's right don't watch the ending without seeing everything else.
TESTING
I don't like lala land too....
I know which kid mukbanger you hate lol bc I’ve seen her and i think exactly the same thing
Stephanie is me while trying to tell a story ?? I tell like 6 unrelated stories before I actually tell the one that I'm suppose to tell ???????
IVE NEVER SEEN STEPHANIE SO CLOSE TO THE CAMERA WITH HER FOOD LOL BISSSS YASSSSS FLAWLESSS!! <333
???????? Stephanie's reaction to the man who was breathing like a gorilla in yoga had me weak ??
I don’t like la la land either!
Breathe in through the nose, breathe out through the mouth Stephanie: AHHHRRRRRR
*just trying to type in bold
whats the name of the show/movie
What movie is that?
The yoga guy sounds like a vaccum cleaner ????
YAAAAS BIIIIIIISSSSSSSS this was the video I needed. I am taking those lil rice cakes outta my freezer as soon as I get home from this trip and spicing them right up!
Love u????????
Banana milk sounds so bomb and I love your videos ??
Does anyone know the name of this movie?
yo i feel the same about the kid mukbangs, it makes me feel weird
She was living episode 9
you should totally do a mukbang in korean!
the zoom-ins BISS IM DEAD ??
I agree.did not lke lala land i miss blockbuster and rogers videos love all ur videos and stories
WOAHHHHHH BISSSSSHHHH! New lights in the back?! Didn’t even notice it til 20 mins in, but hella cute??
What movie is dis?????
I would’ve watched the next tape before confronting the boyfriend to see if it gets better first before changing everything tbh
Bissss!!! can you please start listing in the description what restaurant(s) you get that good good from? bc I live in LA and I want some too ?????
I feel the same about children mukbangs and never watch them. I don't feel comfortable with children overeating especially :S
Today I saw Stephiance in my dream but now I can’t recall his face ??
The little kid mukbangs are cringey AF. I’m a mother of two little girls who are 4 and almost 3 and I would NEVER exploit them like that. Don’t get me wrong some kids just have IT* That star factor; born to entertain or whatever but idk. I just feel like it’s more the parent forcing them, taking advantage of the child’s innocence and liking of YouTube.
Steph where is this from in ktown??????
ripped the front of the container off to get the shot _
I hate kids doing mukbangs or asmr. I think it's too weird specially since the internet is a weird place and everyone who thinks it's okay is just blind. Like have you seen the cop asmr lifewithmak made? That shit is so wrong, I would never allow that sort of stuff with my kids in it be out there if I were a parent
Anyone knw the movie title
“Captain America is gonna live” Ugh probably not and it’s fucking depressing T^T
YAAASSSS BISS. Currently eating samyang carbo fire noodles, rice cakes, w/cheese watching this video.
She should have rewatched tape 8
that "oi" when she dropped the ddeok in the beginning LOL
Omfg I went to a hot yoga session one time and there was a guy who literally did the same exact thing as your yoga guy LOL I’m still shook afff
Please do the Chiong Sisters and Paco Larranaga story in the Philippines
Omg when you mentioned Mommy Tang I got so sad since she hasn't posted a video in like 2 years
Bisss you look on fleek
Giiirrrlll! I love musicals/Broadway and I hated La La Land hahaha it was too hyped tbh so you good we all can be cancelled! Lol jk
Stephanie you should do a video topic on the comfort women back in World War 2!
I usually dislike coming of age movies too, except for John Hughes movies
I DIDN'T KNOW BLACK PANTHER DIED
The kid channels are for kids to watch lol my niece is not allowed to watch adults because you never know what an adult is gonna say
pertinent.. drink upppp :D
Blockbuster was amazing! Do you remember Hollywood Studios? Same concept if you have never heard of it. They're all closed down; it made me so sad! :(
Could u start putting where u get the food lol?
I feel a Kpop Superstar coming from you, the Mukbang/ Story telling/ drama/ superstar.... THAT IS SO UNIQUE, JUST LIKE YOU....
Stephiance's voice at the end is ??
HEYY BISSSS ?? you should do a cook with Stephanie
Idk if any one else does this but my family slices bananas and put them literally in milk and sugar. That's how I imagine that taste like. Sounds delicious!!!!
I love the ending you guys are so cute
Am I the only one who wonders of her fiance gets turned on realizing how much food she can fit in jer mouth!!???
Guys it is not a good idea to watch when ur fussing starving????????
I think it was fate all along. because why would she just one-day stubble upon her own life story. Obviously, she was meant to find it and watch. Why else would the 9th video be missing? It was not was supposed to be found if jail was her fate. ??
“Cheese mozzarella sticks” bis really lol
I like the way she say banana ??
you're my nightly get in bed and watch you ritual.. that sounds creepy but i like it like dat.. hahahaha <3 bissssss i love ya.. you gotta say banana milk like a korean "panana..." lol
Don't worry, i couldnt even finish lala land and fell asleep throughout the movie. I don't get the hype with that movie and i heard the most popular song from the movie and it sucked..haha
I miss blockbusters! Ahhhhh...miss those days lol <3
haha I didn’t know to comment in bold either
The food looks so good ?? Also I agree with the kid mukbang thing ?? Love you Steph! ?? ??
Stephanie, you're so good at story telling
I love how Stephiance said “You’re cancelled” ????
Where do you get banana milk?!????!
I'm so jealous of all of the delicious food you get to eat!!!
Where did you get this??!! I need to know?!?
What does your fiancé mean with “vhs is before my time”? Dude I’m almost 20 and I still have my favorite cartoons in vhs tapes...
I hate la la land too
no veggie no rolled LOL
Love your videos hugs
Cow would only be holy if jesus was a cow????
Stephhhhh pleaseeeee, I really am going to ask again. If you can please list the restaurant where you get thee dishes from. Pleeaasseeeee lmao ??
Y'all got me laughing throughout this whole mukbang the ending tho "Can I live my daydream life?"??
How old is Mrmangobutt??????
I always feel a little weirded out whenever I see little kids doing mukbang lol
so stephiance lasted doing the whole dun dun mukbang wooh intro for like, 1 episode :(
Ive been craving spicy rice cakes ??
Am I the only one who used to slipping the movies in those metal slots? When I was a little kid I would love doing that for my mom. Another fun fact I was scared of those Joker posters, and I remember my brother used to tease me about it.. XD
You look like a zombie eating intestines bis
this is fr my new favorite video from stephanie “aAHhHhHh” ??????????? LOL had me dying not even half way into the video
So what's the movie called?
TRUE LOVE IS WHEN HE GIVES YOU THE EGG ???
Omg you're so cute! I love youuu also hahahah ur obsession with cheese is life
Love ya bissss????
The intro steph ?? ?? ?? Luv u ?? ?
I bet my story of my life would be a time lapse of me sitting in front of my computer ??
Dat some crazy story yo. You know what I talking
*Hi *i *love *you *videos
???????
Stephanie make a podcastttttttttttttttt
i kinda really like how you start off with a story time that you were involved in then a conspiracy
2:00-2:06 I can't stop replaying??
Lol anybody else felt like she was dissing Veronia Wang when she said wannabe Korean mukbangers or just me?
Yes!! I love this!! Looks so good!! Your a queen!!
Did
What the fffffff
I love your videos! You're just so chill and outgoing, but were exactly do you get your stories from? They're so interesting always leave me thinking.... Please let me know thanks in advance ????
If i live in Houston, where can i get Korean food??? Watching you makes me want to try spicy rice cakes sooo bad
Been watching you for a few weeks now and love your videos. Love the stories and I literally look forward to watching your videos at the end of the day. You make me crave korean food so bad. I don’t get to eat it as much since I don’t live near my mom anymore ??
is the story true story?
She’s asian but she can’t use her chopsticks right????
Maybe thats how yoga is.... AHHHHH
WAIT WHAT!!!
What brand of banana milk are you drinking?
????????????????????????
I love you Stephanie, but there is 2.5 servings in a ramen package and the cup noodles are supposed to be one serving. ;)
I understand what you are saying about the kids mukbangs. I just think it’s weird to put kids to eat on camera? Like you said they don’t know what’s going on. But if some parents get profit out of it they don’t mind exploiting they’re children to creeps on the internet. Anyways I love you bisssss
I love how you act like you're not a real Korean mukbanger?? you are though
who else wants to know what movie this is ??
anyone know the name of the movie she's talking about?
What movie is this ?
Omg she is iPhone she skips number 9 lol

Stephiance! You do you boo! Do your “dun dunnn “ “ woo!” HEHE dont change for anyone else ! ???? i love you both , always??
I loved thiiiissss ??
I used to love going to Blockbuster! ???
Isn't it cause that worker guy's action told her it was the 9th dvd? Or it was the 9th episode to whatever that murdered lady got and She just wasn't specific in when she asked if that lady just rented it out? But I mean if she was waiting there for days after returning hers, wouldn't the employees know what she wanted and be able to give a clear answer if that was the DVD she was waiting for? That part threw me off!
omg im hungry, those rice cakes look amazing! ??????
I dare you to love this comment
Finally someone who dislikes la la land
Bisss i don't wanna know how i die or when i die????
Mommytang is Coming Backkkkk! ??
Lala land SUCKED. I really didn’t enjoy it either.
AAHH I NEED TO KNOW WHAT MOVIE THIS IS
I wanna watch that movie so bad now wtf
Like I love NE Let's Eat and her kids cause they seem to actually enjoy eating and talking in front of a camera. While like channels that have toddlers or babies eat normal adult food, it concerns me since I'm a nutrition major and like the little toddlers or kids should not be eating spicy ramen and high carb foods that have such strong flavors, since they're growing they should be introduced to neutral healthy foods. Since they're so young and it can develop into bad eating habits for when they become older. Like at times you can tell the parents are kinda forcing them to try trendy foods, but it's really harmful to the kid's diet
Biss please
ooohhh a bis got faNCY LIGHTS
YOU SHULD DO A MEGA MUKBAG 2x THE AMOUNT YOU NORMALLY EAT
Block buster and family video we’re my life as a child
YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MUKBANG I LOVE YOUUUUU??
I definitely think she altered her future when she broke up with her boyfriend.
Why didn’t she just rent all of them at the same time like boom ya gotta catch em all
I got these weird sweet potato infused rice cakes with mozzarella cheese inside...I feel like i should make them now...
I don't like kid asmr is just weird even at 13
Come for the Mukbang, stay for the Conspiracy
* Your videos are literally in my night time routine????
I wish I could do a mukbang with her and remember when your scared ?? just breathe like a gorilla
Omg I hate musicals so much! Everyone always gives me crap about hating musicals but I find them so boring.
wait why didnt she rewatch dvd 8 since she altered her future that tape would have been different
Nice!! I never knew how to do this!! ??
Where can I watch the movie you are talking about? I am so interested to watch the movie:D
I just want to know, WAS SHE WATCHING THIS SERIES WHEN BLOCKBUSTERS ALLOWED YOU TO HOLD DVD'S!!?! CAUSE THEN BISS WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST HOLD IT THEN WAIT TO GET THE PHONE CALL THAT ITS BACK IN!!?!
That’s why there’s no more blockbuster. The doctor shut them down before madness descended upon us all.
I mean... how can you say it’s the best spicy rice cakes and not share where you got it from! haha I’m drooling
I always love your intros becuz my parents always look at me like I’m crazy when they hear your intros
I was thinking the same about the films than stephfiance!
Lol I hope that we both hate the same girl mukbanger ??????
Ugh I'm salivating ??????
I have made it my goal in life to try cheesy rice cakes.
If it were possible to know the future, I wouldn't want to know
As soon as she said “she’s too young to consent” I already knew who she was talking about
I don’t like la la land either.... I also don’t like the greatest showmen??
Where did you get all of this? Like what store bc this looks hella bombbbb
I had such a bad day at school with a teacher today but seeing ur upload makes me happy
yaaassss LUV U STEPHANIEEEEE!!
you're cancelled jkk i love you steph <3
Why... am I ALWAYS LATEEEEE
Yummy!!!!!!
Where did you get those bomb looking tteokbokki? My ass is about to drive to K-town and devour them!!!
i guess her ending is in the jail.if she not change her future she might kill her fiance or that pregnant women. thats my opinion. lol. btw love your videos stephanie. i wantch it every time i want to eat.????????
okay i didn't like La La Land either BUT i FREAKING LOVED The Greatest Showman!
I love your story time steph
I hate kid mukbangers, specially when they're too young to know what they're doing because there are some weird people out there...
I live in La too, I WANNA MEET YOUU
You know jeffree star omgggg

You are so funny I love you ??????????
Lol I absolutely loved this
Muita fome !

I love your vids but is it just me or does she always has a story from japan china or a place like that?
I don't care for Lala Land either, but love the actors and actresses
I literally watch you everyday! You get me thru the week ??

I love your channel it's the best thing I discovered in a while! ????
All he got out of it is don't skip episodes. Lol!!!
hah
omg you watch mommytang too?!
I wish we were irl friends, we would have soooooo many food dates!!! ??
i hate kids mukbang and asmr omg...
This is pertinent to the story!!!
Kinda reminds me of Soumatou Kabushiki Gaisha
Stick too this shistar steph you tell good scary stories
Haha I know why she went to jail !!
ME TOO SIS * Gets Cancelled*
“Don’t you ever leave me”??????
Where’d you buy this? I’ve been looking for a place in la to buy it!
Where did you buy that tteokbokki???
Would you consider having Mango and Tiger do a mukbang? I like dogs mukbang. Only if they agree obviously.
K, Stephiance has ASMR worthy voice, it's like deep and sounds manly. I also really love his Chinese. :)
What movie is this
I really wanna be friends with stephanie so i can get good food :p
Who else thought steph was gonna sing ba banana ba ba banananana from red velvet power up?
i love you sooooo much
I feel so close
I think she changed her fate when she broke up with him.
damn that ICONIC performance in the beginning of the video.. grammy worthy
How does Stephanie eat the messiest food ever and not get her makeup dirty or her clothes. But I’m over here eating a damn chicken nugget and after one bite I have grease all over my face and my shirt ??
bisssss, u always eating good. aspiring to be like u.
A bisss be so classy
Omggggg! I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling so much, but I didn’t like La La Land at all! I found it so boring and I still don’t understand the hype behind it.
?
I hate lala land and musicals too! My best friend made me watch lala land and during it she was like "it's sooo good, right?!" I was like..."NO ??" lolol.
hey
I am new subscriber, and love how often you post. ????????????
I can never find good Korean food bc I live in a fricking VILLAGE in OHIO, I need to move
aw i never got the notif for this??
Good morning from the PH!!!
I hate lalaland SO MUCH
My sister and I say “biss” all the time cus of you lol and Stephiance did the “dun dun...woo” lol we were spoiled yesterday with him saying the whole thing
Oh my... I heard yupdduk is 5000 calories...
Unless you’re also a kid watching a kid do a mukbang I don’t really see why you’d want to watch a kid doing a mukbang in the first place.
Omg yammmmm ??????
Girl u need to give me the address where u get ur food cuz I love me some rice cake and I’m coming to LA soon so please tell me where u getting these food! Love u!
Please tell me where did u get the lights on your counter. I've been looking for light like these

I want stephiance in my tteokbokki Ahahaha (fully clothed for a handshake)
Biiiiiiiissss yeeeeess omg!!??
Steph always makes me sooo hungry omg
One day I will get to try this!!
I was just thinking about fried veggies
9:49 - 9:54 BISSS ????
I want to eat that. Also, LMFAOOO YOU'RE SO FUNNY STEPH. :'))
U know the food is good when stefiance can’t stop his chopsticks from getting the food every 3 seconds
BANANA MILK MY LOVE AHHH
I heard “??” from my favorite mukbanger’s channel ,so nice??
Bissssss I really want to try this ????????
YOUR CANCELED But yet again I never saw La La Land so...??????
Chloe was definitely going to jail one way or the other. If her man ran off with his side hoe. Maybe she would’ve went to jail doing something to them instead. I don’t want to know how I die or when. But I’d rather know when I’ll die. But what if you live your life knowing you’ll die on this day and you die doing something you would never do but did because you knew you were going to die that day? Like knowing all this is what got you killed? You feel me? Lol
I rather know when I die
You should do Jamaican foods ??
It happened because she changed the future ??
I’m hungry tbh .... I want pineapple BUT I LOVE UR STORY TIMES!!!!!!
I feel like some people enjoy mukbang in a sexual kind of way and a child mukbang makes me worried for the child’s life. I’m a parent and I wouldn’t allow it
I’m late ... but I made it haha
Notif on! ??
I just moved from Korean town to the valley and I miss hMart so much ??
Stephiance' is right. Never ever skip an episode.
HAHAHA BISSS WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT RECTANGLE MOUTH YOGA GUY I DIED OMG HAHAHAHA
i it sooo rare for me to notice stephanie starts a sentence and not finish it.. “ that sound is tiger ?? itching himself and hitting the...” i don’t know why but i dying for some strange out of this world crazy ??
Ahh I missed you ty for posting????
Don't worry steph I also hate Lalaland... a couple minutes in I got bored already. I love the actors I just dont like the storyline. It was a DRAG.
That moment “dum dum” and you hear the fiancé’s voice and you know it will be a great video ????
Hii I'm a big fan
Is it just me or do they say so good SO MUCH still ly
I love Stephanie Soo BISSSSS?? love from N.C.
I literally want to sit and eat with you every day! I always watch your videos when I’m eating! ??????
I hate lalala land
Ooo I’m craving Korean rice cakes!!!??

Does anyone know what the story/movie about the girl who rents the DVD’s about her life is called?? Really interested in seeing/reading it
Oh shitttttttt yaaaaaaaaz

OH MY FREAKING GOSH!!!! WE LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!! We get so into your stories we start talking about how we feel about them in our own mukbangs! Such a great YouTuber!!!

34:18 you can hear someone stomach
Just got out of college and I see this, I’m happy
Kid mukbangs are cringey

The chipmunks voice suits her so much! And her adorable face ????????
I have a question WHY CANT I FIND ANOTHER MUKBANGER JUST AS EPIC AS YOU?!? Like your seriously the best mukbanger ever??
*het
The home of procrastination itself biss
Just wanted to take a second to recommend a case to look into... it’s the case of Lisanne Froon and Kris Kremers. It's such a bizarre and interesting unsolved case! ?? I very rarely comment on videos but I'm so intrigued by this case and just really curious on what you think about ??
Your my favorite mukbang biss
???? sound goes to a 100 from 10 then its 20 then a 80 then a 20 then a 120... My ears ???? #earphone user??. ????????I'm still here ily!

Hi love where did you get the food in Ktown? Would be nice if you could include the location of where you get your food in the description like Thien. Thanks again !
I love you Stephanie?????? also I was watching one of your mukbangs in class AND I WAS SO SCARED SOMEONE WAS GONNA SEE MY PHONE SCREEN OF YOU JUST SLURPING ON SOME NOODLES ??

Bisssss I love YOUUU!!!????
Biissshhh next time squeeze a little bit of lemon juice to the tuna rice and oh my worddd it’s truly life changing!!

Stephanie wat happened to the Halloween mukbang????
ahhh OMg craving rice cakes now!!
Yoo I have been commenting on every video and I never get likes?? Bish can you please like my comment it would make my day??
Hello Stephanie, I watch your channel all the time and I never comment. But today I have to... First of all I love your channel and I enjoy your story time. Now there's one thing that you talked about that I totally totally agree with and I've been waiting for someone to say something about it. The Young mukbangers...I have seen kids under the age of 8 and I'm like really...to me it's sad and bad parenting! Especially once they start getting up in subscribers and the checks start rolling in I don't think that it is no longer what the kid wants to do is just oh we can make a living off this let's go. And I agree with you if they're 13 or 14 and under ish I just don't watch it I don't think that they fully understand what they're doing.
Yesss you’re the best! I always watch your videos while eating lunch, I love what you do! ??????
Did you make it because it looks like it
I think kid mukbangs are inappropriate
I love how you literally ripped off some of the container so we can see ??????
can I have some of that? im salivating T^T
??!!!! ?????? been craaaaaving!! omg I'm good with spicy but even the mildest spicy level had me dyiiiing. Still so good tho ??????
You two have that ACCENT so cute??????
Today is the day that marks my birthday
Yesss!!??
Ooo this biss here is close to half a million
OMG I DID NOT KNOW YOU CAN WRITE IN BOLD WOWWWWWW
YESS love you stepphh????
STEPHIANCÉ HAS TO SHOW HIS FACE FOR 500K SUBS BISS!
How do u do the bold letters????????im dumb srry
Eating with the candoos are a mukbang channel that i personally think they put their kids in infront of the camera for the $$$$$
Can u do a prank on ur fiancé I can’t be with u anymore prank????
pineapple is finally gone lol
I feel like it would be so fun if you did a mukbang in Korean!
SO CLOSE UP TODAY
I love the pretty, blinking lights on the counter in the background!!!
Trying to bold rn
Uhhh I die for ur story’s????
HELL YES ID MARRY YOU

Rice cakes are sooooo goood
Did you get original or mild spicy level from yupdduck
MY FAVV
??Love you!!! continue!!??
I didn't get la la land
Your mukbang is giving me life today , literally almost choked laughing so hard when you told the story about the guy who was in your yoga class
Woah..just realised I’m older than both you and stephiance when he said that vhs was before his time. I remember watching vhs tapes together with the big laserdiscs during my childhood
You should use vegan cheese instead
I swear if stephiance doesn't look like what I imagined him to be, I would feel lost.
Look forward to this everyday
Im soooooo happy I've been wanting u to do this since forever!!!!
So you’re telling me that people are literally watching the video only to not like Steph?? Why watch if you don’t like her? So salty ?? love you guys ??
Dun dun _ woo! Betting its gonna be _ Mukbang woo! next vid

When LalaLand came out, I think it was Samuel L Jackson. He walked out at the beginning of it and said he didn’t like it and apparently it was only the start where they’re singing out in the road. I never watched it because of him ?????????? I trust him lmao Ps. You’re not cancelled ??
This is legit the most Korean mukbanger that it could get ????
Gotta get a daily dose of Stephane bish, Korean mukbanger who?
Love your ramen or korean mukbangs so much!

2:04 i thought she picked the ginger instead lol
I’m gonna make that spicy fried chicken
I'm an Indian and for my spicy means you should feel it on the ass the time you take shit after eating it. And to be honest the first recipe was spicy and the rest I have tried even though I added more of the spicy stuff seemed sweet and sometimes sour.
"THE SZECHUAN SAUCE MORTY." 1.42

Come on...this should hve been more spicy...????
Hey guys I know putting on FF your videos is your thing but...seriously. I broke my keyboard hitting on "space" to pause your videos. We need to read the instructions for more than a fraction of a second. There's something wrong with the speed. The human brains cannot take that fast. Probably I have to give up on this channel...
It's not too spicy . I really love spicy.????
Esto no Enchila WEE!!!!
I want second part of it. sooo addicted!

i really like spicy food, and seeing all these recipes makes me want to make them myself
i looooove spicy food!
The first recipe of chicken is better with honey instead of oil for the out sauce. I know its supposed to be Nashville Chicken but what can I say I like my honey and I like my sweet and spicy.
Those ribs was weak
Me and my friends eat hot sauce without anything at launch when there is hot sauce
Ooh i lobe the mask

How to get that seasoning she puts at the last of the Nashville chicken recipe
Mmm some amy, SPICYY

How come I’m not in this video and how come spicy gang isn’t Jk
Why is everybody replying to comments with I wanna suck you off? Tf
you literally fried some meat, then added chillies to it. Wow! I'm Indian and I know there is way more to chilli to that...
I'm watching this while eating????

Looks like not one single white person in the comment section, they can’t even handle salt & pepper
This fishes are hot but definitely not spicy... I use more spices in my dosa than these...

???????!
4:51 daddy
4:09 why can’t y’all season the meat properly
Bruh the only thing that even seemed remotely spicy was that Nashville hot chicken
I wonder how eggs, breadcrumbs and flour make chicken so crispy SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN!!
WOW!!!very nice!
Tasty, I'm trying to take you seriously, but all this sugar you're adding...
Hot and Spicy?
My mouth is getting so wet right now.
l love spicy food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
for the first one use spicy Doritos instead of flour
Ya know for a second there I thought that Some of these wouldn’t have animal body parts
0:05 wtf are you trying to scare me?that was just creepy!oh this green face,but it’s ok because those great recipes
I hated it!!
Spices ????????????????????????
Hey the flour and buttermilk barely stayed attached to my chicken(1st recipe). Have any tips for me to avoid this next time. Ps. Still tasted good
hot annrrr' spisy meat, hehhheeaa bwoaiy

This is LIT ??????
The bread is so unnecessary!?!
Kudos!
I have a chilli addiction! Chilli flakes are like crack to me ????????!
Mask reference ??
gr8 video
??
these recipes are so yummy they make me hungry
#fuckyes
I'm a little disappointed that with 6 recipes they couldn't make just one vegetarian. I understand most of their audience eats meat but when it's a compilation video like this one it's a little disheartening to see that they couldn't bother to do one recipe without meat.
First recipe is the most disappointing thing I've EVER cooked, only the chicken was flavoured the rest was bland and weird tasting because of the plain flour coating. Horrible. That's not Nashville Hot Chicken.
wowwwwwwwwwwww soo yummy ????????
"6 hot and spicy recipes for non-vegetarians" should've been the title.
That s ass blastin'hot
ooooooh spicy food my favourite!
spicyhttps://youtu.be/w15QdTUjMdc my recepi
alright but is this hot cheetos spicy or actually spicy bc my mom eats habaneros as a snack
Habanero lime wings is where it’s at tbh.
For me this is just regular food?????? still looks good though
It seems to be very tasty I wanna try
NEVER EVER heat Honey. As per Ayurveda - the ancient science of medicine and aprescribed way of life in India, as soon as you heat Honey, it turns to POISON. Ayurveda says it should not be added to even warm water like many people do in the mornings. Honey should be eaten only raw.
Can't you just make a video on some eaay recipes. what is the benefit of wasting times watching these videos when I can't cook none of them.If you can't do that,then just shut the f**k up!!!
I think it was a bad idea to watch this when on a diet
I am gonna add more spices.
I am salivating rn
I've been to Nashville twice and I've never got to try the hot chicken. Next time I will try it.
Damn
watching all of this videos while my parents are on vacation in Mexico isn't a good idea ???? bitch i'm so hungry
Wow, this looks so delicious!
Diarhea
Why dont put some more pepper on the flour instead
Good ideas. However the last recipe was so undercooked. You need the onions to brown further and also ensure that the gravy is acc gravy not water! Let it thicken!
????
SZECHUAN SAUSE!!!! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB
There's nothing vegetarian on this??
I wish I had a chef from tasty channel ????????
Oh yeah!!! Spicy food !!!!
Once you go spice your never go nice (with seasoning that is)
All these recipes are just mild. I eat the fire noodles as a snack ??
Just because it’s red doesn’t mean it’s spicy .
So all of them are chicken??? Really
Lol a lot of white people gonna die from eatin this food and then tasty is gonna get like 1000 lawsuits against em lol
"Hot" n' "Spicay"
the oh yes makes me feel awkward
None of these are spicy, you didn’t add the KFC 11 herbs and spices or the special spice.
Do Sweet and Spicy next!
I live in Nashville but never tried the hot chicken??
these 4 recepies are spicy eh?!....do not americanise the context of a dish being spicy too

The 3rd recipes sauce looks like something you would mix at a sleep over and dare your friends to drink
You call that La Zi Ji? Needs more Chili's than chicken and you know it
ey guys remember, just cause your mouth can handle spicy food, doesn't mean your stomach can
white people are crying just watching this
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo spicy hummmmm
How to attract Indian viewers: this video title ??????
At 2:55... either their hands are really big or that bowl is just really small
Oken!
wings don't need that long in an oven... you fucking doughnut. also it irks me that they didn't dice up the finger
0:05 wtf
This made me salivate
Thank you Mexico for the chillies ????
what even is this? there's more to the hot and spicy life than marinating chicken... and other meats... Where's the Indian curries at? where's the stuffed jalapeños at? where's the chilli paneer at? there's loads of vegetarian things that you could've included as well...
Don't get me wrong, i love chicken as much as the next guy, but why does everyone single one of these have to be chicken...?
Ohhhh.....yesssssss.....????
my fav tasty video, no cheese overload and rlly nice background music
your every dish includes non-veg ??
'6 hot & spicy recipes' adds sugar
The second dish is called ???? or la zi ji ding and it is one of my favorite dishes in the world ( ´?`)
that feeling when u outspiced all your friends is a bless
i like spicy food
This is great and everything, looks too delicious! However, I could NOT stop thinking about whoever is making these recipes and hoping they don’t wear contacts. Because after all of those spices and hot sauces they’ll have to THROUGHLY wash their hands, MULTIPLE times so they don’t burn their eyeballs! ?? WHY IN THE WORLD AM I THINKING ABOUT THIS?!?! ????????????????????
Tasty dishes ate very tasty
Oh yes
I love chicken too, but is there anything veggie? Meat and poultry isn't exactly cheap these days
If you put one of these hot recipes in the fridge..will it be hot or cold?
all i eat is meat and spicy stuff perfect
The starting tho....????
Make a sweet and sour
1:43 SZECHUAN
This video is sexist and racist. At the end, you use a WHITE MAN to say "oh yes". Why not a black woman? FUCK TASTY
cant you do some vegetarian recipie
does anyone find it annoying that the title comes after the food is made? i wanna know what they are making before the recipe starts
The music sounds like a mix of Voodoo child and Cant stop. Still good for me
Yum
Not satisfied with the recipes this time surprisingly
I guess only meat can be spicy ??
Hi, hope you have a great day ahead! I am just a regular teenager who has recently started a cooking channel. Tasty's really great but I hope you give my channel a chance. Thank you!
I'm sweting already by watching this video. Must try this!
All the recipes aren't even spicy
What slow cooker do they use in their videos? Where can I buy this one?
This is too damn 0:04 And I LOVE THIS!!!
Can you make something in veg
This video was really lacking in spice except maybe the chicken
White bread??? Oh come on... just... no... forget about the slice there...
??????
This!!!!!!
I like your recipe but I don't like your music
Indian food is so much spicy than international recipes ........... The food we eat every day is more spicy than these recipes ..... Who agrees ?????
Tasty saw all the comments about not putting any seasoning and gave us this video LOL
I love mango-habanero combination
When you're the only one who realizes that none of these food in the video are spicy :D
Danky
Vegan recipes please...!??
Any spicy food lover here??!
Chicken tacos we call that tinga
big thanks from india
I love spicy food????
That bread looks gud
Written recipes?
Why do I have a feeling that someone deep in the comments are screaming about Szecuhuan sauce???
Dai ..... Indian paneer butter masala
Looks good but I don’t like spicy food but it looks good
Does anyone else watch tasty just because you’re hungry and the food looks sooooooooooooooooooo good
This is literally my most favourite video of Tasty ... I love spicy you see!
4:08 so for 3 pounds of chicken you put a sprinkle of salt and a speck of pepper? That’s tough
Beautiful chicken
When I see one of they're videos I try so hard not to break my diet
Wow I got $2351on my paypal from this tool without paying anything: freepplmon.club/?Rn1SMq
I always eat with something that's hot that I could find in my fridge!
.... y'all gone stop disrespecting Nashville with that fake ass Nashville hot shit ?????????
The fried chicken and spicy tomato coconut milk chicken looks amazing
Way too much chicken, try using shrimp or fish filets
AWSOME
all these look hella good but i know my white ass cant handle shit ??
Spicy food is good for tummy
That is not Nashville hot chicken.
J
Can’t wait to make one or more of these
why am i watching this i hate spicy food
Vegan hot and spicy next
The video is in fire??
Do more Asian food videos!
Nice
some of this stuff would not even be spicy at all
Garlic powder and onion powder? Americans will go to great lengths to avoid using fresh Ingredients
they put the chicken on an a rack to let the oil drip off then put it on bread to soak up the oil that's non existent.
I fucking hate pickles. Like someone actually invented that shit cuz he couldn't taste anything else.
Spicy food is the best thing to ever exist
? j'adore ??
Hijosu madre!!!! Another great bunch of recipes.
They look so tasty but if I try to make them, they will end up looking like something a cat threw up (-_-;)
Thats nice but were are the hot recipes?
Dude I live in Dubai and it's legit 3:48am and I am still awake to watch your vid man keep up the good job and that chicken is looking as fire
120th comment
Yummy ??
really want to try those spicy mango wings, i know if i tried to make it it would be a disaster.
spicy food is delicious! i've been having hot sauce since i was 4 :')
????? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ??????!
The first one tho ??????????
So what in this video was supposed to be "hot and spicy", I missed it. Cayenne pepper is not hot, just bitter, try cooking something with Habanero peppers in it.
I don't watch this show anymore, but this reminds me of Sanjay and Craig ??
The music could easily be a Red Hot Chili Peppers song
Me fasima todo sus platos
This video is hot
????????
Tongue rape!
Is Nashville hot chicken usually served on white bread??
I love tasty
this would make my asshole cry........with joy <3
I love spicy
That music is giving me life
I love spicy food... but I am still waiting on the tasty video that makes me say, "I'm gonna cook that!"
I love spicy ??
for many asians out there, this is kind of spicy and sweet because of mangoes,brown sugar, sugar and honey
The peanuts ruined it.
Hot chicken is the thing that I definitely would pick :))
Yum ?? Thank you for the spicy recipes.
0:05 huh?
When you’re Indian ?? ...But a vegetarian ??
Look it up
Dish number one looks like it is from hot chicken takeover
Wow.. that spicy chicken recipe reminds me of this hot and spicy girl I used to date :)
Perfect! Been wanting spicy food all day.
As soon as I saw "Hot & Spicy", I immediately clicked on in ???? But not as soon as the notification notified me... ????
Delicious
Tasty
My spicy ass is so needy right now just ??????????
Mamma mia... povero fegato??
Hot and spicy like Spring Break
Is it me or everytime i try one of these recipes either the measurements are way off or the cooking times are way off?
SO TASTY. If tasty was a person, and if I could marry him....
Yummy food

What is buffalo sauce??
I hate buffalos
This is so cool like a Blizzard.Because of Buffalo
I love the way they have to put savoury in the title as if I we where going to drizzle on some buffalo sauce on some cinnamon rolls. Wait... I probably would??
I love buffalo sauce anything with that I’ll eat except stuff I don’t like.
385
the music made me enjoy watching great and delicious food making
No buffalo were harmed in this video
I have a question: For the buffalo chicken sandwiches, are you cooking that chicken for 4 hours? Just curious.
Blue cheese is disgusting
I love buffalo but for some reason hate bbq
Omg I love this video can you guys make more
Buffalo sauce is literally the most incredible sauce on earth. Fight me. Also if you use ranch instead of bleu cheese for buffalo wings I hate you, it's insulting. It's the equivalent of covering an entire hot dog in ketchup.
Lol there's no buffalo still I'm a buffalo lover
This video is my spirit animal
Ok but the title confuses me... "savory" buffalo dishes but like, there aren't sweet buffalo dishes right?
???
so what brand of buffalo sauce? or are you gonna show us how to make it ..?
real tears strolled down when you put blue cheese on the tatertots
I'm I the only one that noticed the ending was weird like the cut of the clip idk
Where my Buffalo lovers at?
My leg is cut off. Can't enjoy cooking any more. Just....
I think in england people eat buffalo chicken with cheese
Buffalo is very hot and it is interesting me.
Please do some Indian and bengali food recipies.
Buffalo.. a piece of history ??
After buffalo mozzarella sticks i couldnt see the ingredients, zoomed way too much
The link for "Get the recipes" is unauthorized
DELICIOUSSSSS!!!!!!!
in all my years I never would have thought I'd see a black person put a pinch of salt on anything we don't even measure our seasonings
Z
I’m gonna say it...... Cream cheese, sour cream or blue cheese belong NOWHERE near buffalo chicken EDIT: OR RANCH
Definitely gotta make 4:08 ????
??
I love that calamari
Was that two hours or two minutes to cook the meat balls????
Directions unclear: Used real buffalo
Where are the buffaloes?
THAT IS A DUMPLING WRAPPER AT 5:03! How dare they! They aren't even wrapping them like wontons, nor are they putting it in soup, that is a dumpling through and through!
Y'all forgot the ingredients half way through...?
tasty i have to say i love the food it looks amazing but you guys cant edit for fucking shit can you?
I choked on my chicken curry
What buffalo sauce and hot sauce do you use in this video?
4:15 i cant see the
i am from buffalo....and i approve this message
Great food tutorial but I was confused by the title: very misleading, I was wondering if the video got mixed up as I couldn’t see any buffaloes
The 167 dislikes probably just missed the like button.
Outstanding!
Anyone else HATE blue cheese dressing??
am i the only one who thinks the "oh yes" at the end sounds like ashton kutcher in that 70s show
Hey, Tasty are we just suppose to guess the ingredients at 4:08 for Buffalo Chicken Sliders? lol please fix it
spicy
Deff going to be trying those buffalo meatballs
Could I put the chicken on low heat for 8 hours?
I never had buffalo food before :(
I love buffalos! YIP YIP
This is not fair....... I thought it was buffalo meat preparations...... But it was chicken......??????
I like buffalo...........meat
This is for me.
so much butter and cream and chicken and sauce and fat and *barfing sounds
they use way too much cheese
Please make the food microoven atlest some people have no oven i hope you will upload microoven recipes n easy :')
I have a horrible joke/pun/idk: did the shredded cheese go to the gym? because you know, it’s shredded? pls don’t sue me I’m only 12
1:55 WHAT THE HELL IS EVAPORATED MILK
Yak, am going to vomit
Not exactly a fan of Buffalo sauce, but I like the ideas you came up with in this video ^^
That calamari one is barely a buffalo recipe. Its just taking some fried calamari and dumking it into buffalo sauce.
???????? I’m too fat but I don’t care. I just don’t wanna have a heart attack
NO BUFFALOS WERE HARMED DURING THE VID
Wtf is there cream cheese on all of them
Could the wings be baked instead of fried also? Also how do we make the actual sauce?:P
I have just stumbled upon your channel. OMG you guys are awesome. Very easy to follow directions and very tasty recipes. Thanks from a busy guy
And can anyone tell me what is buffalo sauce?
I liked this video before I watched it
If I weren't so lazy, I would definitely try all of these ??
Great video!!
Actually, the term is Native Americans.
buffalo chicken wings was the first real food ever tried as a baby so I'm told. To this day anything Buffalo is my favorite hands down. Love this video????????????????
MAKE NO CALORIES SNACKS CHEESE CHALLENGE NEXT
My gosh, if it was me, I would be crying tears of joy eating that!
Fuck yeah I love buffalo
buffalo sauce = butter+hot sauce. u welcome ho
Red has never been more attractive
Wow

If you love a buffalo why would you eat it
8 savory recipes for buffalo lovers...........*cream cheese is seen more than buffalo sauce in video*
Love your cooking so much
Do something on Indian cuisine....
good non of that vegan shit
I thought most of it was fine except for all the breaded chicken...blech real wings don't need breading, that's a southern US thing. Oh, and anyone who knows anything about wings? Ranch is gross unless it's on greens but even then it's gross (again, ranch is mainly a southern US thing). Blue cheese is the preferred dipping sauce of the north. Nice ideas for parties and some family dinners though.
No Buffaloes were harmed during the creation of this video
UMMM IT WAS IN ZOOM TASTY
Am I weird for hating ranch with a burning passion?
I don’t like spicy foods why am I here?
The music is jamming lol kinda hype me up super uplifting ????
Hey Americans what is this buffalo sauce? im from germany and never heard from it :(
Not judging but isn't it better to season before dressing the chicken in flour
I wish they had recipes for cookies and cream lovers cough not that I like cookies and cream cough or anything
Why is cream cheese in every video
I'm amazed no one came up with the calamari one before.
The best hot sauce to use is Frank's. It will give you the closes to real buffalo chicken wings.
Doctor: you have 7 minutes left to live. Me:
Why american always have to deeping everything in ranch?
That last recipe looked absolutely disgusting
Do totchos in 4 ways
buffalo chicken recipes are so darn good
Who else came here to see if they using actual buffalo meat

Buffalo lovers? How about people from buffalo!
What kind of buffalo sauce do you use????
Tasty ur killing my plan on a 7 day vegan challenge
Buffalo makes me go dirrhea but it’s cool to watch anyways

4:07 is it just me or are the ingredients subtitles gone??
I absolutely love it when you dont put measurements -.-
can you move on to the full screen
Do recipes for BBQ lovers!!
The buffalo chicken sliders is zoomed in when i was watching it
I cannot understand what people's obsession is with putting cheese on meat. The thought alone disturbs me. Then again, I'm not allowed to have it because of my religion. But I'm happy about that. I'm gagging watching them put crap ton of cheese with the chicken.
Does buffalo sauce really from buffalo?
???
Savoury*
Way too zoomed in
The best recipes I’ve seen yet for my holiday Menu! Thanks, these recipes will be useful to me.
Tasty went off on this video! I'm hungry now!
Me at 3:35, " They are definitely going to freeze it, cut it up, then fry it." Tasty proceeds to do what I predicted. Me "I knew it..."
Why do you batter the wings??? Buffalo does not do that
I love your channel, I have your app, however there is a channel re-uploading your videos and taking the subs you should of had from the great work you guys have put in. The channel name: iDEAS
Calamari in buffalo Sauce... im out thats too much to handle

It's great

It looks like they don't add enough buffalo sauce ??
scrumptiously salty
still wasting good food...
my little brother just came up to me and asked "don't those wings look like bloody poop?" ????
Bad editing on the sliders recipe.
I live in Buffalo. That's it, no cool back story. But hey, all we usually have is the wings so cut me some slack ???? lol
I really thought this recipes are for buffalo meat as main ingredient.
Yeyeyeye strait outof 716
Somebody take her black card away
Why is this so satisfying?
love this video! these dishes are needed in my belly :)
*waits for Cruelty FREE Gains and his bots to start spamming crap in the comments section*
do they have unlimited supply of cheese?! ?????? cuz almost all of their recipes have cheese in it.
They should have used buffalo mozzarella cheese
The text gets cut off around the 4 minute mark
I think searing the meatballs first would just make it look better than sorta semi-boiled meatballs but that's just me and my weird squeamish self
When you're promised buffalo meat and the closest you get is beef.
anyone actually from buffalo or is it just me??
my sister got really frustrated about how many bowls you guys have used in this video and She yelled "stop cooking or use just less bowls" ??????

0:07 Gotta love tasty... only they can find a way to mix cream cheese and hot sauce

(X:XX) was satisfying -Aww, the baby hands! -Eww, the baby hands! -(Insert other recipe creator) did a better version of this... -The music sucks -I like the music -(Lenny face, whatever copy and paste symbol you can find) _Food porn -I did the recipe and it sucked -I did the recipe and I loved it -It looks like... -Positive comments So guys! How did you like my going back into the history of this comment section?

Hello

Here
Hi
Im going to veganize this. Omg ?? i miss it
Love how all of your bowls and spoons are wood! No plastic! Awesome
Your videos are great... and you are tooooooo cute!!!??
Why wasn’t I born Filipino/a? Good food and good looks
You're cute! ??
Can I leave out that annatto powder? ?? I hate the bright red on the packaged tocino as well ??
Spoon and fork represent!
Delicious. I love this recipe. Thank you Jen for the recipe.
SATURDAY MORNINGS = ALWAYS LIT IN A FILIPINO HOUSEHOLD!! I LOVE that smell of garlic fried rice on a Saturday morning. That's when I know.... the eggs are fried, the tocino is out, my parents like to serve anchovies(dilis) alongside... breakfast is served!
Love the video. Will defntely do this.
tocino! love that fatty bits for sure it's like pork cocaine!!!
Wow lovely presentation loving it you makin sooooo hungry lol craving for one!!!
More of Jen's cooking! I want moooore!
3 days?!?! Huhuhu
Question, don't kill me for this. Is Philippines Hispanic/Latino and Asian, cause I see a lot of Spanish words?
Also, try putting the fried rice back in the pan where the tocino is cooked then mix it so the marinate will not go to waste. You're welcome????
Girl! Why are you cracking me up at 5:54am. I think I love you. Peace.
Such a cutie. U got a man?
Can you use pork belly?
We kinda steam/boil our tocino in little water and wait for it to fully evaporate then time for frying, that's how we cook our tocino homemade or store-bought, no matter what the packaging says.
AWESOME!! ??????????
sarap
I can't find annatto powder anywhere near me, is there a good substitute for it?
i s t a a a h p
No wonder there are so many overweight Filipino girls...
Only here for Jen
????????
TFW you really know its gonna be so good 5:46
I wonder if I could make a vegan version of this out of soy curls or seitan? Brotha trynna keep his cholesterol down, but wanna eat some tocino :(
Apparent she likes to eat.
This was posted on my birthday lmfaoo
I luv your personality
dont call this filipino bacon. not at all related to bacon
I LOVE TOCINO!!! EVERYTIME WE HAVE THAT IN THE HOUSE EVERY MORNING I'M EXCITED #PROUDFILIPINO
Jessica Soho is that you?
I hate fried eggs so can I try it with broccoli or something else instead, what other side could I have other than the egg?
These funny ass "gourmets" thinking that the crispy portion of an egg has no place in a "gourmet" meal. lolz
Wait. Hold up.. GARLIC rice! GARLIC RICE!! Where has that been all my life? YUM!
I don't even wanna know the recipe I'm watch coz she's so cute ????
so gooooooodd! i like your vids jen! make a separate channel please
Thanks for this! No more going back to packaged neon tocino!
I know cooking and food are exciting in their own, but watching Jen makes it extremely (if not more) exciting!!!
Omg I went to the Philippines & all I ate was Tocino
I wish the sinangag was a little browner. We sometimes fry the rice in the oil that was used for the tocino to get some of that flavor in there.
Love is love food is food -JEN 2018
Hahhahaha this bad ass bitch in town , love herrer
*clips hand*: “I’ve got yo back” yassss girlllll
She’s one of those people that I would want to befriend the second I meet her. She’s so cute and adorable ????
I like you!,... made me laugh.
New subbie. I love how you list the ingredients, yessss honey!!
With that much "ulam", I could eat 4 more of that garlic rice dome. YUM!!!
This girl can cook!
People should know by now that we have a sweet tooth here and I recommend not to eat that sweet ass spaghetti.
3:35 cringed
How long does this last in the fridge if i wanna store it
My favorite recipe so far! I know it’s authentic because this is exactly how my grandma makes it ??
JEN RULES!!! I WATCH JUST FOR HER!!
BACON!!! Need I say more...
She remind me of Mo'Nique
dis gon be leeet
You look like Ryzza Mae a girl actress in Philippines
My goodness, this looks absolutely amazing! I can’t wait to try it!!!
This is not bacon at all, THIS IS FILIPINO HAM.
i love you already ;-)
There are only two things I crave when I'm stressed and or sad.. rice and fucking tocino ????????
Can you make the OG leche flan please!??
My new crush ???????? love humorous women??
Im gonna try this at home. Thanks girl!
why do i love her so much btw
the 89 dislikes are from chefs who throw away eggs with crispy edges
Is that red powder only for color? Can I make this without that?
And spicy vinegar omg. Thanks no more store bought for me
I love this Video but... TOCINO is not Filipino BACON.
My childhood.
That glass at the beginning is from ikea
I love her personality. Such a vibrant person. Def subscribing to her channel.
You are such a joy to watch! Subbed. ?
Dam! Tocino! ????????????
Whats her real youtube channel?
Will be trying this recipe for sure i love how it's not complicated at all and u basically have all the ingredients available.
When took the egg and put it on top of the rice. Haha, pinoy na pinoy!
I love the chef. She made me feel that food is nothing to fear of. #treatyourself
You dont eat with your hands?
Is it only me or do you guys think that Tocino is NOT! A kind of bacon -_- Tho i like Tocino sooooo much... maybe thats why i was so shocked hahahahaha
I love it, but that’s away too much for breakfast for me
“Love is love, food is food” ??????
Almost 1Million!
Holy crap, that’s amazing!
PABORITO KO YAN
In my family, we usually cut the tocino slices into smaller bits right before cooking them, that way you get more of that crispy caramelized bits! yum!!
You're just adorable and this looks delicious!
I never heard tocino described as filipino bacon before. Interesting
This host is off the hook. Now, I want to watch her other videos. Good job!
Tocino is not Filipino Bacon!
So good! My favorite tocino ??
Kinda burnt but still poppin' ??
I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????
Shes so funny it makes the video so much more homely ??
Dat diabetes.
there’s no vegetable on her plate :(
Go girl!
Looks great!
Tried this exact recipe and it’s salty rather than sweet. So I suggest to add only 1 tbsp of salt cuz the soy sauce is already salty & add more brown sugar.
Ang sarap filipino ako ??
Legit all natural marinade! I'm going to make some for this weekend.
I love watching you cook. Its so ??
You're awesome ???
that sunny attitude <3
Did you cook the egg before the rice becuase the eggs can be served with this dish cold or it was just the order you cooked for filming?
Sana makatikim ako ng luto nila Jen at Erwan someday!! Parang ang sarap sarap!!!! ??????
Mmmm, Filipino bacon! Hellmuthaflippin y... 3 days :( ..... ok. that breakfast looks real good!
Jen is really such an attractive person. I'm really glad i just found this channel and met her. <3
YASSSSSSSS JEN I LOVE YOU ???
ooooooo that was sooo wow. I wanna try this
Great recipe.
Padagdagan po ng bawang next time.????????
You're like a breath of sunshine?? Ang ganda mo!
She be like "Don't label food. Love is love. Food is food." Yes basically my life right here
You sound so therapeutic Jen :)
Tocino is pork shoulder not pork belly so it isn't bacon
tocino is not even close to bacon. theure totally different. please be accurate
Jen you're amazing I love you!! ??
This made me subscribed
looks so yummy
Can I use real bacon? I would love to try this!!!!
we cook tocino with water then wait until the water evaporates and then the fat will melt then caramelize the tocino then we put rice to it
I've been ruined by pre-made, refrigerator-section, corn syrup tocino and have therefore hated it for a long time. Now this is what I'm talking about. I knew tocino wasn't always a gross hunk of pink mystery meat, and that a real version must exist.??
Dyang ??
im dying huhuhu i personally love tocino with a bit of spicy vinegar!!! <3
Delish ????????
Move over pop tarts?????? love ittt
Marination... favorite new word!
My wife and I LOVE tocino. She usually cooks it in a lot of fat, but I like how you cook it with none. Is your tocino that tender because you use pineapple juice? I use apple, because I don't like how pineapple makes meat mushy, especially after 3-5 days. P.S. We also cook the eggs last, so they stay warm, and the tocino first. The tocino can rest in a warm oven while everything else is cooked.
I LOVE HER
subscribed because of jen i love the way she cooks yas go gurl!!! ????
I like the recipe because the process tocino have SALITRE
Ito ay soooooobrang masarap! <3
Nagutom ako ??
The way you embrace foods makes me love u so much
You are fun to watch. More videos!!!!
I love that you cook Filipino food and emphasize that it is Filipino.
Tocino is love. Tocino is life.
I love your cooking and I love your gestures ahaha
I just tried my tocino this morning.. It's delicious! Kind of like longganisa . . .
Your videos are so good and so is your food.keep it up??
Such a nice personality and easy to follow recipe! I am going to try this soon and hope I can find the red powder ingredient at my local H-Mart. That fried rice sounds delicious! =3
good job!
yummy
im watching thiis in the middle of the night and im STARVINGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the expressions that you make are so funny XD. It's looked so good, my stomach was making noises throughout the whole video.
If you freeze the meat should you let it thaw, or just put it straight on the pan?
??
I tried this recipe and it was successful. The hubby's fam loved it. FYI they are not Filipino. Thank you for the recipe!
Ayy this is a good Tocino. I didn't use any coloring, so mine looks a bit boring, but the taste is so amazing. Thanks!
I love you and love your videos. I have been watching quite a few before hitting the subscribe button. Sorry. But, your recipes are easy to follow and very yummy! Love.love.love. just subscribed.
Tocino is tocino baco is bacon.. it's different the one is sweet the bacon is salty
You represent the Filipinos so well! You're vibrant, funny, and your recipes area so spot on!
Wow, I see you know how to eat good, putting one thing on top of another and mixing it, that's how I roll, too, and a nice pile of that wonderful tocino. That looks so good!
Do you have to add the red powder
Is the annatto powder a must? If so, is there a substitute for it?
I fucking love her
This brought a tear ?? to my eye... keep up the good eats!!
What are your thoughts on using pork belly?
Love it love it you put a smile on my face. First time I see your video.
Is there any substitution for annatto powder since there's no annatto powder in my area
I LOVE YOU you are my new YouTube best friend ????
I love mine with salted tomatoes
Yesss I'm Filipino! Kamusta kayo???
yummmmmmm
That look good
I feel like Filipino cuisine and I have a connection but there isn't a Filipino restaurant in my town ???? I can't wait to go to The Philippines, I even watch shows and soap operas. I just love the country ??
Hmmmm, I miss my lola's cooking. Idk when can I visit back in PH.
What is the actual recipe with the actual measurements for each ingredient? I want to make sure that it isn’t too much salty or whatever.
I love you Jen
Where have you been my entire life???
Do you need the annoto powder? If so where could you find it?
Tocino , Tapas and Longanisa the holy trinity of filipino breakfast meats ^^
Yummmmmmm ????????????????
TOC SI LOG!!!!!
My grandma would make this for me every few weekends! She's back home in the Philippines, and I miss her so much. :( I'm going to make this and cry
This makes me sad...Im allergic to pineapple and it looks good ?
Omfg that looks freakin killer I want for breakfast lunch and dinner
My dad has a recipe of tocino which tastes so good to be real.
that looks soooooo delish!!
YASSSS TOCINO ??????
Jen please come spend the night with me & make me some bacon ?? ????
You are promoting animal cruelty and participating in it. A very bad karma will come to you, health problems and much worse gonna happen to you
She reminds me of Leslie Jones from Ghostbusters
Guys she is very u healthy - it's not cute or funny
i love tocino !
Yumm! Love the funky background music! What's the title?
Whenever my mom cooks this, my favorite part is the blackened pieces!!!
Talk about an F.O. (Food Orgasm)
Yeah it's not a burnt egg, we just want it crispehhhh! Lol
I'm lovin Jen ahah
Oh my Ga This looks amazing
I'm Fillipino and I'm so proud of this but I cook it different
"Don't label love, food is food" I love this ????????
Omg im so glad i food this recipe! Im moving to a place where I can't find Filipino food. Thank You! This is one of my favorites.
I LOVE YOU!
I like her. Badass but still funny. Also Tocino for life!
I love Jen she is so fun to watch cook and actually researches things
Hello (: did you cut the pork yourself or did you buy it that way? I've never seen it sliced like that on the shelves in the grocery stores where I am, but I would LOVE to try this recipe and anything that makes it easier would be great!!!

The fancy way
IVE GOT YOUR BACK- ooo honey slay meee
Love it yummy ...where buy wood of spoon n folk?
if she once of my sister, i will hug her everyday and bagging her to cook for me everyday ??
To all my pinoys- I thought pushing the food into the spoon with the fork is normal- apparently, my non-Filipino friends do it...
tocino means bacon in Spanish too c:
Oh my god!!! You made me crave for tocino!!!!
Garlic rice yaaaaz!
Tocino is anything but bacon. Its pork cured with sugar. More like a heavily glazed and pan fried Christmas ham. Tagalog often gets lost in translation due to lack of awareness that a much more similar food or recipe actually exist.
Jen is so adorable! ??????
Masarap!
Her reaction was amazing lmfao, definitely trying this!! :)
I'm going to make this for my husband for his birthday. He loves bacon!
sorry but nothing replaces bacon.
Move over pop tarts! lol
"Staaaaaaaap JUST staaaaaap" Staaaaap= stop Just so you know
Where did you get that dress? Love it!!
"Da pancy way"
I wish I was Filipino ??
woah, tocino literally means bacon in Spanish!!
we filipinos all make it the same way....pancy??
i love the way you do it and your presentation.....like it goodjob im hungry now.. lol??
SARAP!!! (yummy)
Can you make tap si log please!
That looks hella good.
I remember tocilog but tapsilog is my favorite ??
You can also cook the tocino first then cook the fried rice on the oil you used from cooking the tocino.
Oh yas girl! Food id food ???
Can I atsuete powder instead of nato powder?? Or is that the same??
When you took a bite of your tocilog, I got soooo jealous!! Tocino is my favorite breakfast meat, and I can't wait to try your recipe. Thank you!
Made this today. Turned out perfect. Was just as delicious as the store bought packaged stuff, if not better. Plus was not that weird neon red color and ya know what's going into it. Thanks Jen.
What I don't understand is how people can give a cooking video a thumbs down? Who doesn't like Jen??? I enjoy her presentations each time I see her, not to mention she's my favourite on Tastemade. You keep doing your thing Jen! Oh & your set is great!
I tried this recipe and its SOOOOOOOOOOSOOSSOSOO GOOD OMG thank you ate jen <3
You are awesome!
Tocino is my life blood
Miss Jen can you give me the exact measurements of your Tocino Mixture....huhuhu...I'm already tired of buying tocino in the grocery, we know that their selling tocino products with preservatives so it could last long....huhuhu
GURL....yes
this is so fucking good
U so fucking beautiful
Because of this yummy recipe you gain a subscriber in me.
Does she have her own channel? love her instantly
i love you!!!! #nohomo
I like how she made the tocino color natural. The packaged tocino ones look like someone picked meat and painted bright red on it ??
damnnn looks good
3:30 literally made my life
Its not "Filipino" bacon. Its "Spanish" bacon. Thats a fact...
Definitely my proudest fap.
You are too fab, thank you for this recipe!
Same with my Mom's recipe sans the annatto powder. Very traditional, not like those dishes who pretends to filipino food.
Love your sass. Don't mind them party poopers can't please em all. You do you gorl. /Shout-out from the motherland
Love this chick and her style! So gorgeous!!
Uuuuggh why did I watch this at almost 5 in the morninnngggg...... I misssss Filipino food so much
looks good!! I think it's forgetting one thing, slice tomato's. The way my mom serves it ??.
i cried watching her eat that ??
"don't let anybody tell you that it's burnt" i started crying tears of joy; my pinoy heart just needed to heart that ???? salamat for this tosilog!!! ??????
Jen you're so funny, I like your personality, it makes this video even more of a joy to watch!
I love this with spiced suka!!
tocino is food crack
I love Jen!
love ur videos...huge fan
"Don't label food." Amen Jen ??
"Saturday mornings, I knew it was gonna be LIT" KILLED ME ??????
Hungry RN. Ohhh lawd Jesus tocino!!!!
Hi Jen, just wanted to know I can make this with Chicken as well?
Love watching you! You are so funny and your recipes look amazing! Definitely going to try this one!
one of my favorite filipino food !TOCINO! ??????
I'm a Filipino and I'm proud to have this dish??????ayyee
unf that plate looked so sexy
at least a day old. mapapanis ang kanin. hehe
can I do this with chicken?
Jen is honestly my favorite ??????
needs some atsara. my favorate pairing with tocino though is tuyo or daing or salted egg/tomato salsa. the salty and sweet combination is perfect. with atsara you get the sour too. ugh now I miss this so much.
your making my mouth drool! ??
Love your personality ????
I think shes cute
i love u hahahaha ghaddd I'm so hungry ryt now
love her she is great
I LOVE that attitude!
I feel like she needs her own youtube channel! She's so fun to watch! :DDD
OMG! I love your channel
tastewise i would say tapa /tapsilog is closer to bacon but I'm thankful to learn about cooking tocino from scratch.
finally a decent filipino recipe video??? also girl u gotta make a daing video too
can you use other meat than pork?
I want you to cook for me all the time it is so sexy!
you're cool :) I like the character. its not boring and worth watching :)
Bigla kong nagutom ahaha
yum!
I ? you!! ??
Tocino is not Filipino bacon. There is no Filipino bacon. I don't think we even smoke meats. But, whatever.
I thought you were the bacon from the thumbnail.
she made me feel like I've been truly missing out on life. I'm up in the a.m. now trying to find some place that makes this. I don't have 3 days.
Love is Love, Food is my life 250 worth of food every 3 days
Waid you did add salt on the egg right???
I always cook this in the opposite order. Tocino first, then the sinangag (garlic fried rice) and egg last. That way, the tocino doesn't burn my tongue. The sinangag absorbs the leftover juices and the runny egg yolk is nice and warm. ????????????
I am soooo happy I found you!!! You have a wonderful personality that is highly enjoyable to watch! I'm half Filipino and enjoy cooking, but sadly I don't have any recipes of my moms favorite dishes (nor can I say them ??), however, I will make this very soon!! Salamat! ????
Just call it as it is, Tocino.
R-E-S-P-E-K!! lol. I'll be making a pork butt run this weekend because of you. Oh, and by the way, you have TV Chef level personality. You need a show!
Great recipe but I myself would use butter or margarine with the sinangag or garlic rice. Also, adding a little vinegar to the marinade would tenderize the meat more and give it a little tang
HELLO JEN I LOVE YOUR RECIPE TUTORIAL I HAVE SUBSCRBED TO YOU I DO LOVE FILIPINO FOOD MY NEPHEW GIRLFRIEND IS FILIPINO SHE GORGEOUS I LOVE HER AND I DO LOVE FILIPINO FOOD SENDING YOU A HUGE WARM SMILE ALWAYS YUMMY OH OH RECIPE LOL HEHE XOXO PLEASE DO SEND ME YOUR NOTIFICATIONS IF I DON'T COMMENT KNOW THAT I LOVE THEM ALL FROM ME TO YOU JEN ALWAYS BULA VINAKA FROM "THERESE"XOXO "THE PRINCESS OF FIJI " XOXO "TAVUYA VILLAGE FIJI ISLANDS XOXO "GOOGLE SEARCH YOU WILL SEE MY VILLAGE""THANKYOU"XOXO
Hello! Very good your channel… And your video too!! Congratulations! It deserves every success! Your culture and language enchant me! When you have time, visit my channel !! Please!! Thanks! Success! Hugs. DG Tudo
you're the best food person I've ever seen on YouTube! love how you arent condescending but also say a lot of helpful things. great vid!
Awesome ?? I will definitely make this breakfast soon! Thanks for sharing. Yummy ??.????
Hey Jen! I'm gonna try this! Loved how the tocino got caramelized after searing?? And yes...the crispy edges on the eggs are the best part. Quick tidbit to all the followers: If you don't eat pork, you can also substitute the protein w/ boneless & skinless chicken thighs. It'll be moist and flavorful????
Oh my goodness you are so adorable ??????
Using your spoon as a knife, the Filipino way
Omg!!! You're so cute and funny! I love tocino!
You're ma fave jen
It took me just less than a minute to subscribe at your channel! Delicious recipe! I am going to do this! Thank you!
I was skeptical about this video at first. But damn. Between her and Akis I feel like I could open a damn restaurant
I love you for this! It's hard to find good tocino in here! ??
My family cooks the tocino first and we use the drippings to make the fried rice. We fight over the rice ??
Jen do you have your own channel? I'd like to subscribe to it as well! Keep slaying gurl~
liiiiiitttt
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a great looking recipe and brilliant hostess!
favorite filipino breakfast of all time.
oh... this girl is so beautiful, fun n cute. subbing to her channel now! n making this shit ASAP
Subscribed! Thank you for being so adorable and awesome!!! <3
Tocino is great but it can be overwhelmingly very sweet. Sometimes the texture can be turn off for me it can be like eating chewy candied meat. I prefer longanisa for a breakfast meat.
yasss ate Jen repping the Philippines
I hate you so much no Wonder i can never lose weight!! I really have to try this
This the best episode no one can tell me otherwise
hehehe...love it
Love your personality!
i love you Jen! so nice to see filipino foods on your channel
First time watching! I was drooling ?? before you started cooking ?? ??
Girl you're awesome, keep up the quality content!
thank you for the delicious recipe!
Tocino!!! One of the best dishes to eat for lunch in the Philippines!!
Subscribed! Good job making it to 859K subscription. I suppose you're a Filipino Channel. That's why I feel proud for you. Can you guys make vegetarian stuffs? Vegetarian here. ---From Lipa, Batangas
accidentally watched this video and now i know the recipe for tocino! thank you!! now i'll sub!
No tocino is not bacon, liempo is, anatomically and culinary, please don't call tocino as bacon it is not proper
OMG. It's just my first time watching her and I love her already. Love the attitude girl.???
I fell in love with you the moment I saw your humor! ???
Yo guys, if you decide to make this a second time (yes, you have to make it at least twice lol) cook the garlic rice after the tocino on the same pan. The remaining tocino juices mixed in the rice is just ??????
This dumbass people I'm the comment section who's making the "Filipino bacon" label a big thing are the worst. You guys needs to grow up (or go back to school maybe). She's calling it a "Filipino bacon" because it is a Filipino substitute for bacon...or the closest breakfast food to bacon. duh
i just wanna follow Jen!
Great job Ate Jen! ??????
"you want them to stay another night?...." instantly fell in love with you... subscribed!
you're so cute! this recipe is very simple, and I love how natural and accessible the ingredients are. I'm gonna try this soon!
im ready for breakfast now
this looks so good! thanks for introducing me to something new
nakaka gutom!
so pretty?? loved it
TOCINO IS NOT BACON YOU FIL-AMS!!!!!!! NOBODY USES FOOD COLORING FOR TOCINO!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS STUPID PRETENTIOUS BULLSHIT!!!!!
Chill guys, tocino as filipino bacon is just an analogy. C'mon!
I heart u jen
Never trust a skinny chef...
filipino bacon? LOL! Don't make things up!
I would die for tocino ??
Yeah right Jen, don't label food. Tocino is Ticino not filipino bacon.
???????? great vid. ??
Filipino bacon? I'm Filipino and I never thought of Tocino as bacon. lol
I love me some Tocino and some Jen. Not just too cute, but THREE cute!
Damn. Just damn ????????
Jen is sooooooo funny and I'm absolutely in love with her personality!!! ??
This girl knows how to make her american boyfriend impressed..
yas! will do this next... been craving filipino food
you know your fil enough when you eat this with vinegar on those tocinos and banana ketchup on those eggs.
LOVE her already!! I wanna have tocino now tho haha
100% legit...! TOCILOG...! ????
Heyyyyyy, when Jen makes it and eats it, I know it's delicious ????

I don't care anymore about those tocinos cos I know they'll be great anyways, but yow, where did you get those wooden utensils? I wanna have one. hahaha
marination? that's a new one.

Hei, I really like the recipe. However I was wondering if the pineapple juice could be replaced by another kind as I am allergic to pineapple :(
Yummy ??

Omg that looks sooo good!
Sarap! 1 new sub here, thank you for showcasing one of our best weapon hak hak :)
because I am Filipino. And because of that Tocino ( my Fav)... I will su bscribe ;)... Nice Humor too...
a true filipino breakfast is nothing without rice. yum.
love her sass
MY MOUTH IS WATERING
Love ya Chef Jen!! I can't wait to try out your receipes! So excited!
I am happy to see filipino recipe here in tastemade thank you for sharing it to others ?? tocino really taste good also pair it with vinegar so good!
Ah, I hope you make tapsilog as well, Jen! I prefer these savory breakfast foods instead of cereal. This tocino recipe is pretty dope; I always just buy them ready to cook. :D
Looks great, needed some greenery on there though. Maybe cilantro or chives...
My favorite thing my mom used to cook!!!
I love your video! I want to try this recipe. Thank you for this video. ?? i like your humor as well ??????
Omg, first off, your personality is fantastic and you are adorbs. Secondly, I must have this food in my belly. Thank you for sharing! <3
She does unnecessary talking, I think. Trying too hard to be funny.
I think your Tocino looks and tastes way better than the pre-made ones that we buy haha. :D
this is good Times for real
oh my goooood, just looking at that food got me fucked ??????
2:43 Love is Love..... food is food AMEN GURL AMEN
Hi Jen! I hope you make tapsilog, porkchopsilog and liemposilog too!
wait, is Jen filipino?
GO SISIG NAMAN NEXT GURL
I'm glad you didn't make this recipe a lie :D (cough looking at you red velvet cake / tandoori/tikka chicken)
I love you so much jen!! Such a big fan ??
do I really need the anato powder? would it taste different without it? thanks!
Not bacon, more like ham. Kapampangans even promote their local brand with the caption "tastes like ham".
Plz do a mini pancakes video in tiny kitchen. It would make my day :)
FYI: Tocino has no Pepper.. :D Pineapple Juice or Chunks is the best flavoring for tocino
I'm vegetarian, but still going to try the fried rice :)...And Jen? You are gorgeous!
That face says it all. pure foodie bliss.
To-si-log Tocino Sinangag(garlic fried rice) Itlog(egg) That's the meaning of it. ??
Could you just come hang out with my husband and I in Saginaw, MI. You could stay with us? And teach us different dishes to make! Please.... :^] Also, you look GORGEOUS.
Jenn, the other Jenn here! I can't eat eggs, so is there something else I could use instead? I see so many recipes with an egg on top. Ideas please? Thank you Love! Jenn ?? (the other less talented one, lol)
This reminds me so much of my mothers cooking. Great video, thanks
when Jen says she's got my back, i believe it!
Tocino is one of the specialties of Pampanga, the Culinary Capital of Philippines. I am from Pampanga and, trust me, we got this. We do.
Filipino garlic rice is divine. When I first had it I almost cried.
naaawww I love your cooking!
"Jen my life really sucks.." THEN JUST EAT IT.
...Jen....how do I find your channel?
that wooden spoon and fork tho
tocino is life....I love to eat tocino with ketchup or vinegar...
Thanks Jen for making this vid! Can you make a video on pork sisig? I've tried it once in the Philippines and another time in Brooklyn, but the best one in my opinion is Mama Fina's in NJ and they use only pork belly. I think that dish is another great version of Filipino bacon.
Excited just cause it's Jen ??
love your romancing with Filipino dishes!
You are again, more filipino than me Jen!
HILARIOUS, I was craving this and telling my mom how I wish we had some. BTW Jen, there's a Tocino Spam now. :)
Perfection on a plate, yum!
Jen is love, Jen is life.
yasss jennnnn yasss<3
I only like tastemade because of Jen ??
team jen!??
She has a great personality
i love filipino breakfast! always gotta have some vinegar to dip the sweet tocino / longanisa in. definitely wanna try this out. i've only ever had the processed kind.
Definitely gonna make this!! Love me some tocino <3
This was MESMERIZING!
I never heard of this, but believe me I'm gonna have to try it out and thanks for sharing!????????????
what about to use paprika instead of that red colouring ? is that good idea ?
masarap
Tocisilog I'm happy for you... but Tapsilog is life!!
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
I wish I could smell this!! I'll have to try it!
belly
soooo good! Filipinos love their meat SWEET!
How bout tapsilog?? : )
Hell yeah! Tosilog! Definitely a favorite.
dude!.. that looks so bomb
longanesa>tocino all day
Ive always eaten the packaged kind ??
fried rice is good to cook in d same pan where u used to cook tocino..
Forget the tocino, I almost drowned in her eyes!
Jen, your filipino recipes are my favorite! I bet a vegetarian version of this with tofu could work, obviously wouldn't have the flavor from the pork though.
I love this giiiirl haha her laugh ??
mmmmm ??
lol was offended when in Masterchef they were throwing out the eggs with crispy edges. Those crispy edges are my fave!
I fell in love with Jen. Food recipe presentation all of it my taste buds and the kitchen calling for some cooking make me love it even more.
holy ish... my mum literally cooked that this morning ??
F*** Yea Tocino!
Yes! Tocino. Love tosilog! Glad to see Filipino food featured on this channel with my favorite funny adorable chef Jen! She even represented with the fork and spoon! ??????
Jen where do you shop for your outfits?? love your clothes girl!! ??
Tocino is life! ??
people need to try this.. I swear it is amazing. ??
Tocino is my FAVE.
Your amazin

I love them and this series is da best
i love rich brian even more because he listened to tyler, the creator
New to these, but I fuckin love em! Lol
When joji cooks, its like pink guy possesses his fucking body.
They should make a hair cake
Octopus is delicious.
Imagine Rich Brian on a Filthy Frank video.

partyisntover/campfire/bimmer
hahaha that j cole i fuck with, pay him to not show up
Damn this series made me realize how much I wanna meet these guys. Really fuckin chill dudes
Last time joji made these, chin chin came out of nowhere looking for sacrifices
When Joji is hungover af and doesn't wanna do anything XD
Holy shit he still has hair this was pre-recorded a long time ago XD
those guys have to fucking expand their motherfuckin vocabulary and not use the word "like" million times in every goddamn sentence. this shit is pissing me off
Hell yeah! Takoyaki is the shit. By far my favorite food I had on my Japanese exchange trip (other than Korean bbq tbh)
Can Joji please let Papa Franku finish the lore. The amount of chromosomes blasting off without purpose in the omniverses is unacceptable!
This is the best episode so far
4:50 does anybody understand this
Do rendang please..
briaaaannn you supposed to fill it to the brim, flip it half cooked then add another batter. that's why you end up with half circle
Bromance Level 100000000000000000000000000000*
Brian go to prom with me :’))) hahaha I have the fattest crush on u ;-; >.<
As much as I love these guys and enjoy the concept of the show, I'm not really looking forward to the rest this since it feels scripted a little and awkward tones
10:18 - 10:22 Darth Vader?
Dat belly button inside jokes ??
Your dick... wait no your belly button??
Filthy
these dudes are fucking disgusting to even look at, much more so when they are eating, and then they have the personality of dishwater with an IQ of 3 split between the two.
that im dumb at 7:05 is me
i wish joji and rich brian will look at me the way rich brian looks at joji <3 4:44
is no one going to mention the filthy frank voice that joji uses on the second introduction
I proud of rich brian and joji is best
4:51 they called chief, yall know what he said...
they're so bro-y its kinda lame. they just act so lax and indifferent about everything. its boring to listen to them talk about stuff.
Can I kick it at the Feast Mansion with Joji and Brian?
Why would you say welcome to the feast mansion 4 times?
had to rewind to see if joji actually had shades on the whole time
In the hospital she gon’ be screaming my name In grave she gon’ be screamin my name In the wheelchair she gon’ be my name
thicc joji is the best thing ever
on the dick
I rather watch joji rap abt making takoyaki ( filthy frank)
You guys need Red Dick on there to show you how to make that toilet sriracha shrimp boy, that sriracha shrimp, that sriracha shrimp boy.
My name is chef To Joji
(eats hair cake) Gives the burger one a thumbs down
i still luv u papa franku
I saw an NPR article that I’m pretty sure stole the idea to conserve meat by eating insects
Will it takoyaki? Let’s talk about that
First time I’ve seen joji not throwing food while wearing a pink suit
Frank...... :"
9:26 Filty Frank tries to come back
Tired of reading filthy frank comments on every video, let him do what he wants.
Love theeeeeeeem
They are both so cute!!!
“Throw money at problems”
lmao they're the cutest stoner best friends <3
it makes me sad that every time joji jokes around and realizes he's channeling one of his characters like pink guy or frank he kinda just falls back and tries to act normal ):
That Joji Guy seems funny, he should make a channel
I thought He quit YouTube
That octopus about as dead as both they music careers
Joji is literally me when it comes to cooking
I dont care about your satanic, illuminati, ritual, human feast mansion.
that girl is crazy. does she just have a jacket on? ive seen he likes of her before. she really just doesnt learn.
oh no hes trying to say some cheese
oh. here we go. the fat ash is up in der
Everytime Joji says "welcome to the feast mansion" in the 'Pink Guy' voice i cry a little bit ;(
Jojis made takoyaki before...
I knew they were gonna make this
This is so much better than when they have chefs around
Don't eat dragon flies coz dragon flies bite Indonesian kids Belly button ... , I'm telling you guys ..., don't , or you'll wet your bed ???????????????? Oh btw Brian could You try to cook Kue Cubit or lemper ?!?
I love watching them
Wouldn't it be fun if they cooked a CAKE like in the good old days ?
You should summon Red Dick
Joji is either high hung over or drunk
Kasih capung biar lu ga ngompol
“Throw money at problems” - joji 2018
count how many times rich brian says like
No ravioli?
Damn first Max, now Joji. Everyone's gaining weight lol.
I'm starting to think this party is never actually going to happen
10:15-10:25 me and my last brain cell in the kitchen at 3 am high af eating pizza rolls
takoyaki god! I cant help but wish joji would do some of the old funny culinary stuff. Even if its just a random thing once or twice a year. Something for the long time fans of your more comedy oriented content would be so cool.
i wish someone looked at me the way that brian looked at joji 4:44 - 5:03
Motherfucker, you've made a music video with cooking Takoyaki. You can cook it
someone might be a little bit LIT in this.
Pretty sure joji is high in this episode lol
I love Joji ?.?
Wtf does he mean by letting a dragonfly bite your dick?
who even diss person.
Can they just make out already?
no C A L C I U M when growing up
The next one is just another warhol spinoff. They eat cheeseburgers.
3:36
I just realize that he's really into sunglasses. He almost wear it on every interview ?? Or maybe he's just want to hide his big eyes bcs some people keep mock him ??
Joji is hillarious
I need more episodes of this fuck
ok best series on youtube hands down
4:03 Fly floating in water? Mmmmm ^_^
lay the effin dragonfly on your belly button! not on your "little brother"! and its not an effin myth BRIAN... what are you talking about...
3:58 joji was not amused lmao
Is he still friends with Idubzz or maxmoefoe?
can i habe a hamburger pls?
Guy Fieri = the best meme cook
Two Asian people introducing Asian food in fluent English is the next generation
I feel bad for that no calcium grownup old lady :(
What is the song played at the end ???
Its kinda easy man really
Who is joji and what have he done to filthy Frank?
i swear to god if joji doesnt have at least one episode without the sunnies i will-
I swear I've seen joji cooking octopus balls back in his Frank days, and what's all this shit about not enjoying cooking he used to right raps about cooking and perform them while cooking, I guess people change but I'm having a hard time coming to grips
Where's the rap?
no joke. i laugh when joji say octopus ball.
Rich Brian is really annoying to see, he mimics and looks for acceptance at every moment.
9:20 dat laugh xDddd
The way brian tells story about indonesia ???? look like he’s so proud being Indonesian ?????? People need to stop assuming that he’s forget about indo ???? #proud
Joji: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnE98Wk2lM

Welcome to the rice fields mothafu- wait

Semangat trs bang
Rat Chef
10:10 why the fuck did it sound like they were trying to have sex with their parents across the hall trying to sleep????
Good try, guys! Hrmmm, takoyaki might be a new item on my list to try and make.
Pink guy knows how to cook takoyaki He had this video "Pink guy cooks takoyaki and raps" So why hire a cater if you have the expert in hand?
First of all they are so damn precious both of them and second of all I learned to throw money at problems ??
The duo we don't deserve
Brian can cook
Damn the nutella ones and burger looked pretty good and im vegetarian ahha
they should make cake, I feel like joji has some exprience with that
underwhelming show no cap
Make the nutrients for me Joji .
Good to know Frank is still cooking, what a rat of a chef
Just let it bite ur dick XD
RIP papa franku
LMFAO THEM BREATHING IN BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
i love when joji laughs i’m so happy yay
This shit is hard to watch being a huge filthy frank fan really sad I feel like this is super awkward and forced It’s what he wants tho I guess
I would like to write the subtitles for this, can i?
of course joji got bored, bryan need to watch filthyfrank's cooking video
Best episode so far. Easy.

Rich brian is actually really good at cooking. His attention to detail. Joji is like nah balls to the wall.
Ball$
i don't know like dragonfly
Is it rats?
Joji cooks bombass teriyaki chicken lmao
From belly button to a dick, that's a big small difference! I'm just saying.
Welcome TO THE RICE FIELDS MOTHERFUCKER
I see takoyaki, I click
This is really pissing me off when most of the people here are complaining about how Joji has become. People change if you haven’t obviously noticed. He quit his channel for a year or so now grow up and get over it. If you miss the guy that much then just re-watch his fuckin’ old videos.
“Imma keep it real w ya chief That ain’t it”
4:50 ahhhh frank is back
Now that you guys officially made GMM 2 (Rhett and Link 3), Joji should be on GMM right this instance or else!
Wtf! I thought this was suppose to be a cooking show? What is this some sort of a Rhett and Link 3 now?!?!?
Whats the outro song?
8:29 RAT CHEF!
Imagine being jumped by joji and rich brian and all of a sudden you hear them say "take that niggas tastebuds"
so cool man
Joji , are you know smell of jengkol ?? ?
Wait , ur hair
Ok.....so....does joji have hair or???? Bc I’m in confusion
I’m keep it real wit u chief DIS AINT IT
Why they always got super soakers in the fuckin intro
Im from indonesia and i've never heard of the dragonfly biting your dick thing
Jojis voice is so deep how can he make his voice so high fir so long in the filthy frank channel
Frank where have you been
Food and Joji in the same title? What could go wrong
First you pour the battery, then include the invertebrae, leave it for a couple minutes, spin it like bayblades.
joji doesnt even hang with idubbbz or anything for views anymore, i hate that he only does music now.
You got it all wrong, where’s the dead rats?
Why is George soooo bad at cooking?!? I always though he could do shit like that. ??
Careful Joji, with that facial hair coming in, Filthy Frank is trying to tunnel his way back out of your soul to make a come back
i would trust joji with my broken heart but not with my kitchen
8:28 takes me back to flavor town
Please upload frank!!
Dude, like like like
Indonesia Food Pls
Best cooking show in the history of cooking show. Period

Some wise words I once heard from a guy in pink; That's why I'm making all these octopus balls Cuz yall need to grow your own Come and tickle my tentacles and tell me that I'm weak I got ink and some balls I said balls like fucking twice but I gotta emphasise on my testicle size I meant tentacle size whoops First you pour the batter then include the invertebrate Leave it for a couple minutes spin it like beyblades Then you eat some fresh balls Then you eat some fresh balls Then you eat some fresh balls homie Then you eat some fresh balls homie
Even tho Brian's looked better we all know who has the real cooking skills ????
9:25 HE'S FIGHTING IT

Holy shit, is Sean a peacelord? Is this how Franku is paying off his chromosome debt?!
Is that Joji's favorite pants?
1:26 LYF HAX Oooh YEARH
Franskspect
Best episode by far
ANYONE SEE THOSE INDOMIES
The flashbacks should’ve been to rat chef and hair cake
Is no one going to talk about Brian's mistake about dragonfly myth?
We’ve come full circle with the octopus balls
Feel like Joji just fucks it all up just for jokes ??

If I say this verse is fuckin' wack then I'd be lying, I'm goin' platinum, but you're mama shoulda gone latex, I'm crying Cuz you're tryin' way to fuckin' hard to be what I am, So give it a break and sit the fuck down. Now it's pink in the flesh and I ain't talkin' 'bout vaginas, if you wanna sniff a line o' cocainer up in this diner and pop a molly or stupid shit, Reflect on usin' it, but use it again to make sure you're not used to it.
jOJi HaS hAiR??!?
10:22 pink guy tries to come out
RAT CHEF WILL BE PROUD
I was laying in bed trying to get her to sleep and i was watching this. She of course had to watch too and she said she really liked this and was upset when i told her there was only like 4 videos of this haha.
Fake frank on the thumbnail
I am not sure if this is a generational thing, but I do not understand this content. The guests appear to have a lot of patience and produce some great food. I am not here to spread hate, but this is not the content for me...
every video he is in frank tries to come out hopefully one day he can make videos again
i was waiting for a hair cake with idubbz and maxmoefoe
Are they smacked?????cuz i am & they gotta be the way they acting??
What does octopus taste like I want to try it but looks nasty
* muchdank has entered the chat *
Still making a living out of dead animals I see
I’m so fkn in love with Joji wtf
I never want this show to endddd
it's funny how joji just fucks up all the food and Brian is just like, this is easy i'm great at this lol
Crazy Rich Funny Asians :)

Now first we feast is all about joji
"Throw money at problems" -Joji I aint got any money though

This video makes me want to chew water .
We need Joji’s dumplings

1:23 also trying to let out his inner frank
Ravioli in the pocket-oli!!!
Brian looks like a sophomore in college, how old is he?

My favourite gay couple on the platform back at it again
watching this 4am in the morning makes me hungry, or does it

I know I’m not the only that’s happy seeing Papa Frank make these videos.

The 4th installment in the human cake seriea
This video reminds me of this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnE98Wk2lM

1:10
Akward
KANGEN BRIAN ADA DI INDOOOOO!!!!
My dude is lucky joji didnt shave his head into the food and eat it.
Just throwing this out there but it would totally watch a cop show with them. Their Chemistry is just that good.
I just got my vr headset, but I did the whole porn thing. I'm tryna watch this like I'm there. How I do dat
"cooking is not fun" the filthyfrankshow clearly gave him ptsd cooking all that fucked up shit lmao
Joji is chaotic evil when it comes to cooking
Omfg I can't wait for them to come to Denver I wish it was next week already ??????
I centered the mellow over the gram, heated it too long now it melted over my hand. Fuck it. I bite it. I burnt it but I like it. Camping with my niggas it’s so fucking exciting
That is franku sama!!!
BEST SERIES
I only know Tako-yaki from onepiece
Panas anjir jangan di makan langsung
He still got a littke frank in him.
10:15 We can see franku and pink guy trying to escape Joji's Body
Come on papa franku you lived in japan and can’t make takoyaki
Ooof I was trying so hard to not burst out laughing (in class when we are reading) when joji said " what if we took his seance of tast"
Needs more shock collars.
Just wanna let you know I stopped the video from playing and will not watch it BECAUSE you didnt include max and idubbbz
I love em sooooo muuuchchxhxhcc
That cheeseburger is bothering me so much. I don't know why.
That 0 calcium gesture killed me hahahahahhahaha
that straight shade at j cole with the withdraw right after lmaoooooo
I just love seeing famous people try to cook. Some of them seem entirely incompetent.
1:24 ricefield intensifies
You Just take an dragonfly and let it just bite your fucking dick Rich Brian 2018
1:24 can someone ask joji to go even higher like “Ayyy welcum to the feast mansion b0ss”
LMAO why is he always acting like he never done shit before.. he ate Pewdiepies ass hair baked in a cake he made with his friends.. nigga better stop fakin shit??????
cmon now joji. you've done this before
That's why I'm making all these octopus balls Cuz yall need to grow your own Come and tickle my tentacles and tell me that I'm weak I got ink and some balls I said balls like fucking twice but I gotta emphasise on my testicle size I meant tentacle size whoops First you pour the batter then include the invertebrate Leave it for a couple minutes spin it like Beyblades Then you eat some fresh balls Then you eat some fresh balls Then you eat some fresh balls homie Then you eat some fresh balls homie If you know this I love u
Wait didn't Joji get a buzz? Wtf?
Can you add subtitles please ??
I still miss you so fucking much
1:24 I smell some filth
all this time i thought kewpie is read as cue-pie not cue-pee. wtf joji
how high were they when filming this XD
This is the modern day epic meal time.
Does Joji only own one chain?
damn, filthy frank looks wierd in this omniverse.
Indonesia mana suaranya........
eh so indonesian
Kalo ngompol mulu tuh di gigit capung udelnya biar berenti
These guys are high as fuck
I would love to be an 88rising assistant! Hmu!!!
4:40
Joji is only famous bc of filthy Frank and is his music is mediocre at best and will take him nowhere don't @ me.
MORE JOJI AND RICH BRIAN
Isi in subtitle indonesia dong
Joji is cute af
5:49 Is that a reference to Rat Chef? "Frank, what is this?" ????
greetings from your homeland Rich Brian!
i missed joji
Could we get a “like” counted please?
This entire video is hilarious, the zero calcium joke, the cheeseburger takoyaki, the breathing to cool down the food, and everything in between.
LIKE
MAZUI!!!
Tentacle Hentai
joji, just call him. the guy with a pink suit. nah, jk. i like u as a guy who made 2 legends in a life.
I NEED MORE EPISODES! PLS MORE JOJI AND RICH <3
2:05 pink guy flashbacks
I love these!!!
Iya bang iya....
Do you want my mom's recipes joji?
The sad thing is that you can see filthy frank breaking through during this episode.
16TN likes.. Is that to reflect the amount of times the word "like" is said in the video?
" WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELD MFUCKER !!! "
Why not cook the rats?
Still the same boio
Please change the show. This could be great. But a rented mansion isn’t a great concept.
Luv this series
Anyone remember pink guy make takoyaki and rap??
@10:20 this was me last night ahahaha
The legend.
so this is wear filthyfrank went....
You guys need to get Eminem on here
I can still feel filthy frank in joji when he says ball or calcium
Should have let joji make some cigarette Ash infused rice balls
If i said this episode was whack then i'd be lying
but. his hair?
Joji??
wait is papabless gonna be here?
Never have takoyaki for breakfast
Happy birthday R.B. U truly are a RAP GOD. duh
Papa franku
WELCOME TO THE FEAST MANSION ??
“Octopus balls” Dig my grave cuz i died
im waiting for the toilet sriracha shrimp episode
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
I miss hair cake
I wish I could go to a party like that I would smoke everyone up there
This is what we need.
They cooked it too long on one side that probably why is was not looking too hot
no hair in it, 0/10
1:33 im already hungry af looking at that burger. GG BOIS
apalah dayaku nonton ini tapi makannya indomie wkwkwkwk
WHERE IS RED DICK !!!?
Makes me want to make octopus takoyaki muffins, so I don't have to worry about vibrating them. QP/Eel glaze on top. Fuck that octopus looks amazing. mmmmmm
that ain’t it
The real reason that Joji is wearing sunglasses in this video is because it’s actually the Fake Frank as the real Filthy Frank is filming a new video. It all makes sense now!
an invite chef just cuts their chemistry changes the mood they have to be like little more respectful
they should make an episode where they speak in their mother tongue and have subtitles
12:00 on a half assed cooking video... worth nothing????
Joji obviously wants to leave Filthy Frank in the past, but people still comment shit like "Oh, he's still got a little Pink Guy in him" and shit like that. It's pretty annoying tbh, he doesn't want to be associated with that anymore, so just leave it out.
We need russian subs
Magic soundeffect ? Brian saying "Oh shit lol" saying is a true combo.
this was boring af and lame
they ate each others balls no homo
Mans ate a hair cake I don’t think a lot of things could be that disgusting to him
I stg these two are the cutest ydkucbifhnvffjbffh
It is clear as day that Joji is where the peace lords banished Franku
wait wheres the dead rats?
Pink guy is the best cook in the omniverse.
Oof
10:18 close your fuckin eyes, listen, and picture something in your mind
9:54 Me showing my parents my failure in life
Di udel pak di taro nya bukan di t*t*t ??????????
This video is fake. Stop supporting this garbage . This is the real one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnE98Wk2lM
Love seeing Joji doing what he loves, Brian's a pretty cool guy as well
Isn't his hair short now
JOJI getting chubby hahah
Everytime joji takes a bite im Expecting him to let out an: "OoooooOOOOOooooooOooooOoOOoOOOOhhhhhhhHHHH"
In the Indonesian version kick a dick is called (STATER)
sunat makanya biar ga dijijilin capung ke titit
More Joji And Rich Brian please
From my place boys let dragon flies bite their bellybuttons in order to swim Thats just dumb lol
Joji pretending he doesn't know how to make takoyaki is major troll pewdiepie voice "epic style"
I didn’t notice either ?????? that he had sun glasses on LOL ??
9:40 give me da sauccce bousss
Hey... Pinkguy.., is that you..??
when rich brian said "cooking is fun" I was expecting a flashback of joji in a pink suit cooking ramen while rapping...
this is old..
man this just looks like 2 friends goofing off... where is my show so i can do that lol
Hairy cake
From hairy cake to Fairy cake
What mistake they have. 1. After you put the topping,add another batter. 2. Dont let it cook all the way,flip it then let it cook all the way. 3. Let is cool pls. You will take your taste but for hour.
Just gonna leave this here, for old times sake. 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnE98Wk2lM'
Do Ravioli next video
Joji is getting jealous of Rich Brian’s cooking.
Brian the type of dude to call curb stomping a street food
Should have got pink guy to cook sum dumplings
Joji you’re halfassing all of the cooking and wonder why yours turns out shitty.
Whats the backround music at 10:32 ?
'that aint it' with the cutest laugh by joji is the best thing ive heard in a while
Wait... i thought he just got a new haircut?
looked fire
1:09
Had me at octopus ?
STOP MAEKING STUPID PEEPOLES FAMIS
Could've gotten pink guy in to do it, that guy can cook octopus balls. Got video proof ??
Hm... makin me hungry
this series just makes me miss papa franku more
Inner pinkguy came out when he sprayed that batter
Mmm sucking on takoyaki balls
1:09 who is that girl??
i think joji need wife
Have you seen chef?
Please make siracha shrimp
FILTHY FRANK IS ALIVE
These dudes are like Drake and Josh??
Where does Joji get his accent from?
They are so high lol
It was the only reasonable way to end this. Let's throw money at the problem, they've learned the American Way.
joji cant take the filthyfrank ptsd no longer
10:12 is the peak of the show.
Joji's food is always messy, I wonder why...
Welcome to the filth mansion
7:24 Don't apologize for your true feelings Joji. You're right.
I kept seeing the name "Joji" in videos.. Finally clicked on one.. Realized Joji is FilthyFrank.. WTF lol
not dick bryan,. it on your belly,.
these two should really start there own cooking channel.
Lmao that shade to jcole was hilarious
wow quality content
Okay. Joji. Actually start tryin man.
why does joji look like netflix daredevil
If J. Cole shows up I’d misplace my shit
So good !! Keep just Joji and Brian, and let em cook themselves, they just have to train a lil bit and I’ll be lit !!
If I said this verse was fucking whack then I'd be lying You said you're going platinum but your momma should have gone latex I'm crying
"Throw some money on your problems"
Dont stop this series PLEASE
3:53 I didn't know brian actually know that myth lmaooo
Where can I get joji’s t-shirt its fire ??
Takoyaki looks pretty damn good... I've tried Octopus sashimi, and loved it...
"you get a dragon fly and let it bite your dick" Oh fuck I chocked on my BLT ??
take this show on the road! At least in different areas in LA
Gibe de takoyaki b0ss
From human cake to this
I just get 10 pound just by watching this video
This is the best episode yet. By faaar
how come joji's hair grew so fast?!
Awesome vid.
this is my favorite series on youtube.
Did Pink Guy was in the intro
You guys should make some vegan lasagna
Clicking into the video made me think filthy frank was back??
Pleaseu givva me da takoyaki baus
I think Brian is my only fav Indonesian rapper
Feeling some Filthy Frank vibes in this video...
Joji needs to stop wearing his sunglasses indoors
I think we know Sean's favorite guests
This is what filthy frank has come to
This was by far the funniest one so far
They must be protected at all costs
??
dude eat the burger
Frank's coming back inventibly. Joji can't resist
Just summon pink guy and make him make some dumplings already.....
Subbed for Joji and Brian ??
Joji when you coming to vegas???
These have been really great. Guests or without! You guys put out awesome content!
Does anyone else find this series cringy?
How did he not notice the sun glasses? they're on every episode
I supported you everytime. I will support you as always. Love from Turkey! ??
I came for the Franku I got the Franku minus the voice
A chicken pot pie one would be dope.
Why TF does Joji look like hes never slept for a second his entire life?
"Throw money at problems." -Joji #quotesforlife
This show is fucking golden
Insert your bitching/complaints of people who reference FilthyFrank here
I wish they had Japanese restaurants here in my town. Yummy.
1.30 pink guyyy
What the fuck Is this? Iuuggg human cake its better
Haircake

Okay for the last 'welcome to the feast mansion' is that franku
I Can Smell The Sweet Scent Of Animal Cruelty Even From Here
88rising is really rising.

CAPUNG DI TITIT
Essa porra deve ser mto boa Pqp
Ore wa.....
9:17 I'm howling
i’m sorry but seeing joji and takoyaki together again makes me happy
Ratatouille Flashbacks
fuck j cole
First your pour the batter, then include the invertebrate. Leave it for a couple minutes; spin it like bayblades. Then you eat some fresh balls
The song about Smores by tyler is the partyisn'tover/campfire/bimmer specifically campfire really good song 10/10.
Lmao wtf I thought joji knew what he was doing with takoyaki
Oh hell yeah rich brian knows my homie tyler broo
11:08 WuT TraCk iT IS omg that's so perfect
DIDNT FILTHY FRANK DO THIS
For some reason. I just don't trust Joji @ all. I think he would serve you cat food & crackers as an appetizer truthfully.... He would say it's some kind of SPECIAL EXOTIC FOOD IN HIS HOME COUNTRY OR SOME CRAP LIKE THAT!! Don't y'all agree with me.
chigga bring too much indonesia in his mouth
What? No vomit cake?
Hair cake.
YOU BOTH AND THIS SHITTY INDUSTRY ARE CUNTS
Joji saying ‘let your nuts hang’ gives me life
Joji and Rich brian perfect duo!! Hit me up if you wanna be a trio boys!!
Idk if it's just me but I really enjoyed it with just joji and brian
pink guy cooks takoyaki and rap
This is literally will it takoyaki with Asian Rhett and link aka joji and Brian ????
$uicideboy$ for Hot Ones!
Gimme de takoyaki boss
Now I’m fuckin hungry
That aint it cheif
10:18 That smile, that damned smile..
ITS FILTHY FRANK MOTHER FUCKER, ITS FILTHY FRANK BITCH!! Let's get some pussy tonight....!
Are they brothers? Is Joji "Joji Brian" or just Joji?
Wow his hair grew (sarcasm)
2:06 when chin chin takes almost all the chromosomes you have
* exhales*
They should call Red Dick to teach em cook..
hell ya
all of the episodes so far have been awkward, but this one was especially awkward.
brian talking about guy fieri made me remember when joji dressed up as guy fieri in multiple videos lmaoo
Brian is like 10 years younger than Joji but he is like a wise sage in comparison (joji ur still cool it’s ok)
1:58 I am glad too see nothing has changed from you hahaha
Looks amazing! Would be great munchie food to haha. Thanks guys, much love and respect.
Why not have Red Dick (not in character) on for an episode?
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS :D
From time to time, we can see glimpses of papa franku and I’m living for it
#pressfforfranku
Jojis sense of humor is ICONIC
10/10 Acting Skills
Ravioli ravioli what’s in the pocketoli
Can i habe your posey pls
When Brian talk about that dragonfly things thats true and i'm not argue about that in our nation
7:46 WTF why is Rich explaining to Joji how to make the balls.. like, Joji made a SONG about octopus balls in the past as Pink Guy.. This is sum bs..

I'm not, I'm DUMB <3
"Are you considering the camera angle and stuff? I'm not. I'm.... dumb." lol joji
If I said this verse was fuckin Wack then I’d be lying
Okay why the fuck couldn’t the whole season be like this?

????
Why is joji so attractive?
These two knobs again? Still can’t believe FWF gave them a show. So much cringe.
Look it this face joji he pink guy??
tmw you're Japanese but you Indonesian friend is better at cooking Japanese food than you.
Please let there be an edit of 10:12-10:29 of just their breathing. A 10 minute video of that sweet sweet ASMR
brian is more gentle than i thought and it makes him cuter
"Throw money at problems."
Filthy frank was a michelin star chef
that ain't it cheif
ughh everything you guys make or taste, looks so good. And I'm just sitting here getting hives thinking about my seafood allergy. D: Why does life continue to fuck me, while I'm voluntarily celibate.
I've seen better acting in pornos.
LMFAAAO

This nigga made rat quesadilla, rat noodle soup, and fucking baby rat churros and served it to a midget and dipped
If I said this verse was fucking wack then I'd be lying You said you're going platinum but your momma shoulda gone latex,I'm crying
The true takoyaki experience is nearly incinerating your mouth when you eat the first one hahaha
Take a shot everytime they say "like" youll die of alcohol poisoning
All that laughing?? Im definitely dropping a like
"That ain't it" -joji.
Trap dumpling

4:51
Had to be Asians eating anything that walks.
watching thos helped me remember one of my fav childhood films from the early 90's(although it came out '89) Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland
Joji, the ultimate ex boyfriend material
Frank would’ve made rats
9:18 lmfaooo that awkward evil idea you have with your bff and makes you laugh
Why are two morons that have never been in a kitchen doing a cooking bit?
Imagine One Punch Man, but instead it was Guy Fieri. That’s my dream anime.
How high are these dudes
someone should inform Rich Ferengi that money fixes teeth lol
This better be more than 10 eps and there better be a season 2
i just camed by pants
Have found my reason to live.
They will never see this but I love youuuu this show is great
why octopus... lol
This is the type of stuff you click off from Pornhub for.
These are pretty good to watch while waiting for more Hot Ones videos.
Can Joji not move for like ONE second
Imma keep it real with u chief... T H I S A I N T IT
First you pour the batter then include the invertebrate, leave it for a couple minutes spin it like beyblades
Joji is my favorite person. No beef on Brian, he's cool.
Chopped > Guy's Grocery Games
This channel has been taken over by Joji and Rich, which I'm okay with
Isnt this what Tobi ate while with Deidara
Lmao, that toy gun is from the dollar store. (I believe)
I've been listening to so much joji ever since these videos started coming out
Joji acting like we aint see him make Takoyaki for music videos b4 boi please
Yo, fuck guests. I want to watch these meme gods fuck around ALLDAY
I mean if he can cook rat and rice balls he can cook anything
Who is that guy with the striped shirt he looks like Joji
I think joji cook this himself otgerwise theywould shoutout the cook
Before JOJI got a hair cut
Joji cooking like pink guy
THIS IS FRIGGEN CRAZY....BRIAN HAS THE SAME BIRTHDAY AS MOI MOM nd...JOJIS BIRTHDAY IS THREE DAYS AWAY FROM MOI BIRTHDAY????
What does chigga say at 4:51
I miss Frank.
Insert move on from filthyfrank comment
I'ma keep it real with you chief, (chokes) this ain't it.
Papa Franku Cooking Show !
88rising ??????
We miss you Frank
Can we not be forced to experience these morons again? I guess you need to be a millennial to not want to punch them both in the face.
Why is Joji always wearing glasses?
10:25 ???
If I watch this I’ll be cheating on action Bronson he’s my artist / chef idol and this is not nearly as entertaining
I swear rich brian's favorite word is shit
Tims potato chips for the win ! Kettle second best
I feel like Brian tries to be good but Joji just doesn't give a fuck ??
Ima keep it real with you chief
Im enjoying this feast mansion cause baby joji is here uwu
all i can think of is pink guying cooking
Like if joji and Brian should drop a collab album
My Indonesian ass was about to scold the heck out of Brian when he talked about the 'myth' and said you let the dragonfly bite your d. Thank god he corrected it.
oH WAIT NOT YOUR DICK YOUR BELLY BUTTON
Let ya nuts hang
He used to be Rich CHIGGA ?!?!?
No rats, no ravioli. No likes
I know its bad, but I'm here just to see FF references
Your hair
Lol
Im soo hungry
THAT AIN'T IT CHIEF
Wait a minute, haven't Joji done this before?
We stan a money saving shistar
Of course Joji can make Takoyaki.
Takoyaki really should be as popular as like a hotdog street vendor, it is in japan and it is honestly like one of the worlds best street foods ????
The best of rat chef
Hhahah
Let ya nuts H A N G
Whenever I see Takoyaki I’m reminded of the Pink Guy song
In case any of u guys were wondering what Tyler, The Creator song Rich Brian was talking about its Campfire/Partyisntover/Bimmer
Do not like these guys at all
This is the first time I've seen Brian without a guess shirt on one of these
This was my favorite episode so far of this show. I like them by themselves
I'LL TAKE YOU FLAVORTOWN
yo just came across this series and i hope it never ends! i love me some joji! rich brian and joji mesh so well! keep this shit coming!
I love how awkward this show is. Its great
Nice
Pero joji no se habia cortado todo el pelo? Xd
frank is doing some filthy shit
i've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
HOW TF do you mix up dick and belly button
Bobby Flay def look like the typa dude who's into taekwondo
Nice
This is the closest we’ll get to Filthy Frank

i love how joji looks like a model in the thumbnail
0:35 BRO WTF! You made a CAREER out of making cooking fun!
Failed Kamikaze pilots can't cook
Joji is so funny he should just start podcasts
"That aint it" Laughing "That aint it" Laughing and clapping "That aint it" Almost crying fuckin killed me
Is joji nose crooked?
Hate to be this commenter but getting mad pink guy/Frank vibes from this
"S1 - E4" When this is over there better be a season 2 in the future!
There's a part of them just straight breathing keep it up franku
"Nobody is going to want to eat this shit" yup
I appreciate Joji's no fucks given cooking style.
Should’ve brought Mr.Negi gen 3
Should’ve brought Mr.Negi gen 3
Can you tell George to at least start making JojiVlogs again?
Papa frankuuuuuu
They must be on something. Why are they laughing so much?
Sean Evens is a goat
He should get red dick to cook for them
A chef losing his sense of taste is the ultimate irony and that actually happened to one the top in the world. Grant Achatz of Alinea in Chicago lost his taste to mouth cancer. Fortunately he got it back.
Gotta pay J Cole not to go ????
When your dick is so small you confuse it with your belly button.
I love it. It’s like the teacher just left the classroom so they can just screw around
"You down for that?" "I'm down, yeah." "You don't look down." "I-I'm down." "Alright :D" I love these two.
Omfg I’m so happy I’m moving back to Japan this year. I missed having Takoyaki at festivals and stuff.
Omfg they are so funny together ???? I couldn’t stop laughing ??
Will! It! Taboyaki?!
4:41
This is obnoxious ass hell. Sick of this hip hop food hipster scene.
Lol
These guys deserve their own show
These dudes are the most fucking hilarious people. (Right, this is papa franku)
I swear if he shouts I’m cookin all the dumplings
PINK GUY RAPS AND COOKS TAKOYAKI

The interaction at 4:45 is killin me
Yo I want to watch the takoyaki master at work.
7:24 lmao the shade
Love those balls man they look good
"wait not your dick your belly button" -Rich Brian, 2018
Takoyaki Rap was some fire bars from Franku back in the day
No Thanks!
I love watching you both cook. I waited for more videos. Yosh!
Welcome to the rice fields motherfucka
these 2 are fuckin' idiots
5:47 favorite part??
Woahhhhh, where this come from????????
we need a hair cake reunion
everytime the “We’ll be right back” part shows up, it fucking kills me
Joji was a good hair cake maker
7:04 “I’m re- r- r-, dumb”
Just what mY literally just saw them in concert yesterday ass needed ????
How is hair grow back???????????????????????????????????
Joji is fucking daddy.
Red dick laughing at their cooking skills probably
rapping while making squid balls
Pink Guy cooks Takoyaki and raps
clicked on this hoping it was octopus balls lol
This ain’t it chief, not the cheeseburgers
“Cooking is not fun” -man who made a large amount of his fame rapping about cooking.
I could watch these two all day.
That delay until they realise how hot the takoyaki is
Brian needs to stop playing. We all know that boy can cook
anyone gonna tell me the names of the hot Asian chicks in the cutscenes like 1:28
this is my favorite episode
Cooking with joji channel.
“she’s some old lady... she had like zero calcium growing up.. *laughing*”
why can't joji stop moving lol
Favorite new series on YouTube
Is it just me or does anyone hear the beginning beat to the soon-to-be-published Wanted U by Joji?
You guys cant just end this show this is my life now and if it leaves cuz they aren't celebrating in the mansion anymore ima bea upset????
Joji out here jugglin everything he touches
I think George said “Welcome To The Feast Mansión” in that way as a joke and now since they use it in every episode it haunts him.
i need more dammit
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA MAKE SOME HAIR CAKE?
but can they make a sociopath?
No offense, but Rich Brian kinda looks like he has down syndrome.
That ain't it cheif
Rich Brian looking like Meredith from The Office...
Rich Brian says "like" waaaay too much.
bro joji is so fucking fonnut holy shit
the way joji was so careless with the batter gave me so much anxiety
BRING BACK JOJIVLOGS
Joji and Rich Brian have VERY good charisma together and very funny, I really liked this episode a lot.
No hate to the chefs but it’s way better with just joji and Brian
Joji wants to hire a caterer because he legit sucks at cooking hahahah.
Franku YOU HABR DA HENTAI (tentacle) BALLS
come and tickle my tentacles and tell me that I'm weak i got ink and some balls
Lol my aunt won Joji’s favorite cooking show
Yo Joji, tell Pink Guy I miss him ????
This is the greatest friendship of all time.
Feijoada
Feijoada
Pão de queijo
Pão de queijo
Those Bonito flakes are huge ! The stuff we get from our local asian market looks like fish food : [
I think Joji should cook for the party like he cooked as Pink Guy. Who doesn't like rice balls or fried noodles?
had to replay 1:09 a few time to check if that chick wearing anything down there lol.
Bri, kok ragu mau ngomong Indonesia? Lagi nelen kali ya..
Bri, kok ragu mau ngomong Indonesia? Lagi nelen kali ya..
JOJI COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
For sure the best episode so far
Balls? Balls? Can I have some Takoyaki please?
for anybody wondering, brian is talking about the song "campfire" by tyler at 6:20
U should have asked pink guy for advice
let them cool!? fuck that shit!
O c t o p u s b a l l
I like how Pink Guy knew how to cook but Joji doesn't
Why do we still eat such intelligent animals? This is like eating a dolphin or a monkey its fucked up
JoJi still has hair
ALL KINDS OF BALLS??
This is such a stupid series
I love how there is just a pink guy in the intro
I love this show
Oh shit i though that was only in dragon ball
ITS FILTHY FRANK MOTHAFUCKA!
Joji looks like if chlamydia was a person.
88 truly is double happiness
RICH BRIAN AND TYLER THE CREATOR NEED TO COLLAB NOW
Enough of this bullshit, just have the party already.
anything that has Joji in it I would definitely watch it over and ouhvvverrrr again!
Brian’s food is how I want my life to be, Joji’s food is how my life actually is
Oh man I love Bonito, Kero Kero Bonito
Francis of the filth
I feel like I just got humble flexed on
Want to make this at home so bad
Can you release some recipes please
Joji having that Pink Guy PTSD, he's so done with all this cooking shit xD
the only way to eat takoyaki is when it's so hot that you burn your mouth off: right out of the pan
This might be the worst food show on Youtube but my oh my are these two hilarious.
Is that a filthy frank
??????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??? ?????????????
i'm thirsty for Joji ????????
I never comment, but I will now because nothing would make me happier than a shitty cooking show with just these two beautiful boys
rip all the kids that let a dragonfly bite their dick
the two of these guys together is amazing
4:09 let ya nuts hang
I like cooking shows but this is this best and the funniest cook show ever
From what I've heard, Guy Fieri is an asshole in real life.
"Cooking is not fun" Jojivlogs 2018
Just don't even try lol
How about a Test Drive with our boi joji?
Frank has become Joji who is a fuckboy with a meme page, am sad
Joji should make a youtube channel dedicated to his mini outbursts of his alter ego
Hoi
How have I not noticed the Indomie in the background
Try make Rendang
Were these filmed before he made his music because he still has his hair in this.
Remember that time Joji cooked with Hair and Joey Salads urine?
Thank you for the free series!
The start was just bullying Joji lul
How many times are you people gonna keep bringing up pink guy and filthy frank?
And here I've gotten over Papa Franku But thank you YouTube for the the feels tho.
We Thai's eat insects. Deadass, shit's hella nice.
Rich Brian: Welcome to the Feast Mansion Joji: WeLcOmE tO thE fEAst MaNsIOn
i swear to god joji's laugh makes my day every time
Do a microwave bread episode
what the fuck is this show man, lmao
so we just goin forget papa franku doing rat chef?
What, no rats?
Frank...plz come back
Finally!!
Who’s Joji?
Rich chigga cooking skill is so good..
I remember Papa Franku rapping while making Takoyaki ;c
I was honestly hoping the chef today would be red dick
Rip frankuuu
that was 10/10
Why does joji resemble Filthy Frank? And why does Brian resemble Rich Chigga?
I love takoyaki!!!
9:26 "He's coming out!!! I must resist!!!"
Absolutely love this series!
Stop talking about franku, he clearly wants to move on.
You can see his filthy frank cooking instincts kicking in
It would be so nice to see hints of Frank every now and then so I know this is the same fucking person but he's so underwhelmingly composed and filtered, really need some of that cynical anti pc shit before I get sick of this boring vanilla sellout. I feel like I regret wishing he showed his real side and his music coz he completely gave up on the og shit and that just feels disheartening because as a fan, I miss the shit that got me hooked in the first place, no offense to his real persona, but he's too NORMAL for the screen, and honestly, not that entertaining anymore. I wanna think he's faking it and shit but I'm slowly starting to feel like this is who he always has been and filthy frank was just a medium that he doesn't respect anymore which to me as a fan is disappointing. I don't wanna say this but when he was unfiltered, he seemed more "real"??? I have so many mixed feelings, I just wished we'd still have access to his raw side, I would still respect him as a music artist, maybe even more. Having a real musician have his own show would be so nice and he could be true to his fans and be different than other rappers but well, when in Rome. I hope somehow this reaches him and I hope he does something about it before people like me stop following him for not staying connected to his roots. I just feel like Filthy Frank, his opinions, and the general community that it manifested was just a class above and meant a lot more to me than this sad chigga music. I just wanna see hints of the shit that started all this coz I'm not fukin with what seems to be going on with his career.
Safari man tried to come out at 5:48
8:31 wow. I got the deja vu
“PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS”
cooking with filthy frank?
“we gotta pay him NOT to show up” LMAOOOO i fw J. Cole tho
Get Pink Guy in here so he can cook up a storm.
noob
Okay, we like these dudes but seriously, can yall stop uploading their vids/advertisement? They aren't that interesting when they're cooking, upload some content we actually subbed for.
800th comment!
I hope this doesn't mean the end of Feast Mansion
Joji can’t cook without vomit. He’s out of his natural habitat
I love this show, because of the hints of filthy frank and the pleasing aftertaste of no dead rodents and friendship
Boney toe-flakes?
now THIS is some good fucking content
Joji wtf
Brian the type of dude to eat street food and use the curb as a plate
Joji has to be not trying on purpose there is no way i refuse
Papa frank, your children miss you
I always end up watching these on the toilet
everytime joji laughs but gpa is raised
Hey bOss
When they were breathing super hard it felt like a much dank video lmaoo
4:48 That smile, that damn smile...
Brian’s like the older brother figure in this relationship even though Joji is older I love it lmao
Rich Brian seems to know what he's doing!
This is about some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen, and I've seen some shit.
Joji doesn't give a shit about anything anymore lol
Joji wants to eat bugs, Brian apparently wants em to blow him
Fuck you joji...get out of the kitchen you disrespectful cancer sac
Who are these people?
welcUm to the fEAst MAnsion
Rich Brian and Joji are such good friends :D
3:33 the moment when Brian is done with Joji's thought and is like, "you're dumb"
this is filthy frank lore
CALL IN RED DICK MAN C’MON
3:54 how do you mix up dick and belly button?
Bring back Joji Vlogs ya cunt
After all the welcomes to the feast mansion i really expected a "welcome to the ricefield motherfuckers"...
So in all those Pink Guy cooking music videos, did Joji have someone else cook for him bts?
ive watched all the first we feasts with them too much
Is it me or Brian just innocently forgot to turn off the stove? ??
This is the best episode yet
The outro is my favorite part of these videos, song fits percectly
Lol they communicate like spergs
Their cooking looks delicious.
Does Joji not like his eyes? Always high?
LMFAOOO i love
i didn’t want this video to end
Hamburger ethnic food is always bad, hamburger takoyaki, hamburger pizza, hamburger pelmeni; It's all bad.
They should make a cake ;)
amazing content here pls keep it up
Jojis takoyaki looks like something I would shit out and Brian's takoyaki looks like my gf shit.
Get pink guy on this show (:
JOJI COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
This’s lowkey a GMM will it episode

Does vomit cake count as a Japanese street food

didnt this nibba cut his hair
I have the same shirt as Joji
we all know what happened last time he made "street food"... fresh from the streets
not down with these 2 at all sorry but i feel like these episodes are for kids
09:26 - 09:30 When Filthy Frank is trying to come out but Joji is resisting.
Joji looks like he stinks
"I'm dumb" -Joji
Anyone else wish that the caterer was just pink guy?
Did they pre record this
does it bother anyone else that brian says welcome to the feastmansiom twice?
I love how Brian tries so hard to perfect his, while joji is just being joji ??
Its filthyfranks motherfxcker..its filthyfranks bitch..!!!
this show sucks ...
LOL how many years did it take this guy to realize his outie belly button wasn't his dick?
i love joji but this was so boring...
Holy shit at my town we got a different type of story with the dragonflies, if one bites you(at any part of your body) people said your sick was gonna fall off ????
Seems like jojo is a one friend atmosphere type of guy.
Anyone else watching this while still having no idea who/what 88 rising is?
Take “a” out of the title
Welcome To The Feast Mansion
Men, i dont really like show like this, but its sooooooo fucking funny
PaPa Frank 'u' still alive ??
That Filthy Frank coming out at 8:36
Did anybody see the cringe Fine Bros video about Joji where the company refused to say Filthy Frank. they said “he previously had a very strong following on YouTube.” But didn’t say the name of the channel once and refused to leave a link in the bio.
This is amazing
3:49 oh
damn brian the song at the end is fucking FIRE
Why is joji pretending he can't cook shit, I mean he was dressed up as guy fieri but was a rat chef
I wanna let a dragonfly bite my dick
8:36
Am I the only one who was anxious about Brian not turning off the stove the entire time they were eating?
i was pretty confused when brian said 'bite your fuckin dick'. i was like did i did it wrong?
2:12 my father taught me to never trust a man who wears sunglasses indoors
i want to hangout with the guys for a day
Where the subtitles
90% of the comments are about filthy frank
This feels like a much dank episode.....
Joji should make an appearance as Papa Franku for the finale of this thing. Just as a final send off to Franku for the fans
It needs some hair and blood sacrifice for cooking to be fun
“Pink Guy cooks takoyaki and DOESNT rap” lmao
Before watching: sees title finally something joji can be good at....right? But, knowning joji will find a way to mess up. Lol.
Can we have a cooking video of Joji only speaking in Japanese please, thanks.
that joji guy should get his own channel fr
Joji got polio confirmed
joji's laugh is like my salvation dude
Love the new episode of drake and josh
Damn i want eel sauce, so good
Ey b0ss can I habe takoyaki pls? ............b..bb..bbb0ss... b0ss I habe a cancer ....... b0ss
Drinking game: Anytime someone comments something Filthy Frank related in videos with Joji!
joji almost dropped the retarded at 7:05 YIKES
Feels like Joji and Brian could be some serious environmentalists. Brian with the shrimps last episode and joji with the insects.
Im so glad this exists
Well now we know what Rich Brian does with dragonflies
Do you guys know Chef?

9:25 pink guy trying to escape
read conservative tree house website for real news. the Honduras migrant caravan is like Europe migrant crisis. NGOs are terrorists. paul ryan is closet dem=want kill medicare, dems kill medicare by overcrowded system with illegals,but give themselves subsides/exemptions.
Rich Brian the name change is just odd to say dosent work
FUCK THE RULESSSSS RULESSSSS RULESSSSSS UUUU UUUU
That's Filthy Frank motherfucker.
99% JoJi comments = Filthy Frank fans. The other 1% dont know who Filthy Frank is.
These two are the most boring characters ever. BRING BACK PAPA FRANKU
When are we gonna get red dick the culinary genius on to cook
"Balls on ma face"
This is comment 667
Rat chief 2?
Cringefest 2018. Tik Tok here they come.
GODDAMMIT WE STILL HAVE CLONE FRANK WHY IS THE REAL FRANK STILL HELD BY CHIN CHIN
My two favorite bois making takoyaki lol
I bet Joji's next song will be about how depressed he is because he can't cook
So no more pink guy but we get this shit, really?
Close your eyes and listen 10:11
The eye contact while they were eating kills me. He's like getting to look joji in the eye like 1ft away with a mouth full of food lol
Who am I? Who am I? Yup yup, it's Pink Guy!
man, joji didnt remember his past tho 0:36
8:22 LET ME TAKE YOU TO FLAVORTOWN
Brian, you 11pm-thumb for that marshmallow, my mind flashing eating "gorengan" with "kolak". Oh man. ??
ALL I NEEDED WAS A STICK GRAB THE MARSHMALLOWS MOTHERFUCKERS GETTING LYNCHED AND BURNED
when brian said about dragonfly thing, i tought it was hilarious if HE actually did that when he was a child. because it's not should bite on a dick. but belly button.
gordon ramsay hot ones
what's Joji's hairstyle called, i wanna copy it.
Dragon fly's don't bite.
That ain't it, chief. 4:53
"Will it Takoyaki!? Lets talk about that." queue up good mythical morning theme song.
That J. Cole shot was smooth lmao
Just the visual of Guy Fieri going Super Sayan man please make it real
8:40 rat chef flashbacks
Go watch Joji- Test Drive lets get our papa to #1 on Trending.
Best episode yet for sure. This is the formula right here, just let these two goof around and cook their own food and let the fact that their actually friends carry the show
Would've loved to chill with these guys when I was college. Now I'm a grumpy older millennial and I feel like I'm watching school boys act a fool.
remember when joji did takoyaki and rapped
Cooking show: Do not cook this, pay someone to do it.
this shit is fucking hilarious, liked this one even more than the others ones
Are we gonna ignore the bottles of Los Calientes Sean must have been there lol
Welcome to the Joji and Rich Brian channel lol
Whats that moving thing at 1:51 ?
Where can I get that dope First We Feast Piece they have in the kitchen?

joji laughing and giggling is the holy elixir I never I needed ??
Indonesian food pls
Please let me take Rich Brian home and feed him.
So, after several videos of George cooking on the filthy Frank channel you guys make it seem like he's a complete retard on the kitchen? That really wasn't necessary
joji channeling his inner filthyfrank
This is so different from Filthy Frank lol
The pancake version of it is called æbleskiver in denmark and is a x-mas dessert
Welcome to the feast mansion
This show is some of the cringiest shit I've seen on youtube
Brian, goreng tahu bulat aja
Octopus balls
also nostalgic memories of PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
Filthy Frank and Rich Chigga present: WILL IT TAKOYAKI?!
No way George is Australian
What are you GAY?
Papa Franku please!
Why not have binging with babish on for an episode?
is that joji the aloof youtuber who thinks he's a rapper?
Filthy frank
Love these guys. But real talk The fatter guy will always know how to cook better. Deductive reasoning through taste buds ??
“Imma keep it real witchu chief This ain’t it” ????
From eating pube cakes
This is literally the best fucking show ever
This is amazing
When Joji said that thing about J. Cole ??
they seem so baked XDDDD
I wonder if Joji fucks up on purpose, because it's way too much man, nobody is that clumsy hahahaha! It's cute, tho!
Calamari on steroids.
MuchDank do your work
Unsubbed! Because apparently this is just Jojis channel now ??
At 10:18 pink guy soul came out from joji
It was boring
j. cole has left the chat
"Just let a dragonfly bite ur dick; wait ur belly button not ur dick"
wheres sean?
10:13 audio homoerotic asmr
5:49 "it's a family recipe"
Could and do make this easy at home, on a old wood-burner from 1809 :D
It's my birthday, pin this comment.
I think I'm falling in love with George??
I have octopuscalciumsis
I’m taking you to flavor town.
EY BAUUUUUS
taco-yaki sounds good
For being the world's greatest chef, Joji is pretty ass at cooking.
1:10 who is she?
Love Joji's jazz hands
z e r o c a l c i u m
"It's gonna be fine..." shoots drum, locks eyes?? 00:57
Trick I learned eating takoyaki, bite a little bit out of the top so you can blow into it to cool it down, avoids the 3rd degree burns to the inside of the mouth
Please go back to skit comedy...
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKnE98Wk2lM&t=0s&list=PL9SK5uDMlIIK-ODXSwi7vQppDbQmojA51&index=21
Filthy Frank really shined in this episode!
So Joji went from being the Great Papa Franku to this pleb shit ? Sad story
joji don't pretend like you never made takoyaki before lmao
Filthy Frank's spirit was trying to come out with that "gouge his eyes out" comment
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
I need more of these
They need to get red dick to cook, he makes a mean sirache shrimp
Who the fook are these guys! Haha
kudos to the storyline tho
I swear these get better and better each episode
The age old question: Will it takoyaki? ????
I'm halfway through the video and I'm wondering if this is a cooking show or an eating show.
Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t the octopus balls cooked on filthy frank with Pink Guy rapping in the back.
I swear, the faces he makes. Reminds me of, FilthyFrank vibes.
Could we het howtobasic in one of these videos.
Bruh
Fucking name a better duo, I'll wait.
Where's the beat bruh "Pink Guy cooks Takoyaki and Raps"
Frank style episode on fleek rate 10 debos of 10
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
Tickle my tenticles joji
1:30 if you want to skip the shite and watch the actual video, lol.
Early ??
This is cool except the scripted segments. Who came up with that idea?
from 10:11 to 10:28 is real content lol
The sweet version of takoyaki looks similar to aebleskiver except it's usually dipped into a strawberry sauce instead of having the sauce drizzled on top
i dont know man, the one who talk is indeed joji but the cooking part is definetly franku
I love it soo fucking much
7:25 HOLY SHIT LOL
Franku has got cooking experience
Joji picking the best bites!
Joji is just another Frank character. In a few years when he reaches the absolute height of his music career and starts winning awards he’s gonna hop on stage and ask the crowd for their chromosomes.
1:23 that voice sound familiar to me ... Its still in him
Is it the last one?
I love these
please make rice balls
Joji is right. It won't be long before meat isn't economically viable and we start eating more bugs. In America we probably flip out on the idea, like we straight up...LOSE OUR SHIT. In Asian countries and Europe, it's more common. Once again, they are ahead of the curve. Personally, I've had fried crickets, that tasted like bacon and cheddar. I also tried them without flavoring. Not bad. Tasted like..sunflower seeds. It was very mellow. I'm eager to eat more bugs! Don't worry, no one is going to kiss you! ??????
Now you really need guy fieri on here
Don't worry joji I still piss the bed too
THIS AIN'T IT CHIEF
JOJI COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
What the hell is going on in this world.
filth... i mean joji actually prefers baking over cooking
Joji: "I'm done cooking. Let's stop this shit" Brian: "Wait... let's do it though. I'm good at this.."
Still waiting on a hair cake recipe
Full on i would pay to watch this if it was on Netflix
happy seeing joji happy
i wonder if anyone else has uttered the words "oh wait! no, not your dick, your belly button"
10:10 are they sucking for each other?
it's almost the same as us in Denmark calling "æbleskiver" (apple slices) which is just the dough eaten with jams and powdered sugar
gblg anjing rich brian salah ngomong WKWKWKWKW, ngakakk
4:53 me @ life
This channel has became joji and rich brian’s special culinary channel and I don’t even want to complain
i couldnt sleep bc i kept crying but then i remembered feast mansion comes out on wednesdays and i could rest
Joji is better at baking cakes.
Anyone else at school?
8:31 is that Chef Rat?
I feel like Brian asked who was gonna clean up the kitchen cuz he's a responsible boi
I'm mad about the fact that takoyaki has nothing to do with taco cos I keep having taco in mind the entire video and now I'm craving for it
I didn't watch this video. I came here to say I hate these two idiots, and I won't watch anything that features them. Neither has talent; neither is funny; neither is interesting. These two are examples of what happens when people who do stupid shit get famous. I want these two not to be famous any more.
"Don't even try it, just throw money at it" The realest cooking show on YouTube.
I think Joji got tired of cleaning kitchens.
When is he gonna make dumplings like the good ol days
This is the perfect episode. So fire ??
Can't we just move on? Yeah nah, not yet
Get Tyler, the creator on the show
"you know how when you were younger, you used to wet the bed and shit?" Joji: "i still do"
Please pink guy for guest next episode
Zero calcium gang
Am I the only one who noticed that they're saying the word "Like" way too much? xD
Ey boss!
these kinda piss me off bc theyre old and jojis hair is short so its just like watch prerecorded shit
autistic chopstick skills
Joji just can’t be not filthy >:}
God, I love this so much, 2 of my favorite artists of all time collaborating with one of my favorite YouTube channels of all time. Lowkey Like a dream come true
Brian always talks with his mouth full. It honestly makes me uncomfortable.
U aint rich brian u cant run from who u are
How fast does his hair grow???
Im not gonna lie but im loving this series ?
Drinking game idea, do a shot everytime rich brian says "like"
Made the same mistake of eating my first takoyaki basically right out of the pan lol
PAPA FRANKUUUUU
3:56 wtf does brian say here?
pink guy
PAPA FRANKU
"Let your nuts hang" Joji -october 2018
Dragonfly myth never dies
“HAMBURGER PLES”
"You wanna press the button jodi" he didnt even know his name lol

Right cheek looks thick.. and i dont mean while he's eatin' - hope he's ok.

I'm too old for this shit..
Joji sold out
joji's cracks are showing. any more fame and he might just go back and talk to pink guy lol
Crassic* Japanese street food
Press F to pay your respects to Franku
This is the best episode ??
whens the joji ashmit collab
Brian, give 'em the sate padang!
11 minutes feel like only 5 mnt :")
filthy cooking
This isn't the greatest cooking show of all time it is only a tribute
more enjoyable just the two of them
insert pink guy reference here
Soo.. this party already hapened...?
Brian is the expectation and Joji is the reality xD
goji looks like some kinda franku goblin
So, indo street food next?
10:15 close your eyes
Bapak brian,itu capung gigit udel bukan tytyd :(
Joji ans rich brian is the 2 gods.
The intro song is "light" by Pill Low and Hamster.
But did he Jojo carry ketchup in his mouth
takoyaki god
But did he put ravioli in his chest pocket
I’d eat Joji’s balls, u kno, the takoyaki ball HAH
these guys.. pure cringe... me no like :p
They could just call Red Dick, last I remember dude was a Gourmet chef.
Yep I am right, whatever these two are doing it still entertaining ??
Filthy come home filthy, max misses you anything for views misses you, even idubz misses you (Cut to idubz dancing )
G to the A to the R to the B to the A to the G to the E!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT DOES IT SPELL? FEAST MANSION!!!!
White niggas when they try guacamole: 10:18
Its Joji Frank motherfucker!!!
rat chef
Awk
my favorite series rn
Just 1 nyassss is enough to my year perfect.
The intro though! The best takoyaki I've ever had was at a food stand run by a little old lady who looked liked she never had any calcium growing up lol
>Make a shitty show >Invite cringy people over >Have Joji because he makes everything funny >profit
There are so many takoyaki in asia
I dont like these two.
Bring the old bastard out
ICE POSEIDON MADE YOU!
Rich chigga kinda has a lil xan mouth
I bet 5 dollars joji can actually cook
best cookingshow? tell that to the guys from @EpicMealTime
But why
Orewa takoyaki-ga daisuke nanda-yo
Imagine Gordon Ramsay teaching them to cook something
THE PIZZA FLOAT
rich brian and joji catering cheat show, love it
They're like the main foundation of 88rising ?? i love them so much
I made it a minute in. What is this crap?
i paused the porn i was watching to this lol
Joji actually already made a video about this
Joji will never escape Pink guy swear haha. Papa Franku.
is that joji? HEY BRING BACK JOJIVLOG!
Is this joji vlogs?
there's 4 voices saying "Welcome to the feast mansion" and for the first 4 episodes It has been with Joji and Rich Brian. so when will Rich Chigga and Filthy Frank appear since I swear I definitely hear their voice?
9:20 Bro don’t suppress it Joji!! Let that demon out (or chin chin will force it out)!!
Ok.FWF Got a good hook with jojo especially right before quitting but yeah this is the span zoid of Joji but just more limits and hold backs, can see how he handles not going back in character lol. Love no matter what. :)
Joji is just jealous he doesn't know how to microwave #bread
Brian and George are such a power couple
New drinking game- Every time Brian says LIKE... chug it
Brian just better at cultural puberty
Abridged instructions: First you pour the batter, then include the invertebrae, leave it for a couple minutes, spin it like Beyblades, then you eat some fresh balls. Then you eat some fresh balls. Then you eat some fresh balls, homie.
Joji getting chubby
Haha I have that same shirt Joji’s wearing lol
Get some new peeps to do this segment. Shit is getting annoying.
Hoping fior yakitori!
THIS AINT IT CHIEF
Bruh my boy Brian its not dick, its belly button hahahaha
PINK GUY COOKS TAKOYAKI AND RAPS
Yea Brian is the better cook
Joji's goin full normie
Is this fake Joji?
god these videos make me miss filthy frank so much :/
Let ya nuts hang
Isn't joji going to rap while cooking takoyaki-- oh,.... right
"Imma keep it real with you chief" ????LOL
These videos suck they just remind me i won't see any more filthy frank and instead get boring joji and brian. I would trade a million joji and brians for one franku
"let your nuts hang"
I was literally just catching up on Rich Brian's video
Daddy franku
joji not fitting in
The guy in the yellow looks like Asian lil xan
JOJI SHOULD BE RAPPING WHILE MAKING GYOZA
Joji makes Takoyaki on Filthy Frank but then he comes here and he's suddenly incapable of even filling the batter correctly? Hmmmmm
this is the worst series thats been on this channel....
lol we all know the pain of burning your whole mouth while eating hot takoyaki
Next episode: ravioli
Joji, are you being intentionally terrible for the sake of the show, you silly bastard?
Name a perfect duo... ill wait
Finally, Jojivlogs
GMM: Will It Takoyaki?
Joji should bring Mr.Negi Generation 3 to help
YO THAT SALES WOMAN IMPRESSION!!! HHAHAAHWTFOMFG
I wait for new episode just because i wanna hear joji says "Welcome to the feast mansion" in papa franku style
What kind of sick historical revisionism is this???!?!
B0SS, can I have a takoyaki please ?? Jojis laugh gives me life
From vomit to hair to human to takaoki
briann ????
Kicking him in the balls could potentially take away his ability to reproduce. Which is worse? No vision, or no kids.
Make a green sushi basically sushi covered on wasabi
I figured joji would be better at making takoyaki
Hey bous, can i habe pizza?
Them being themselves in anything is already good
I've never had a cooking show make me laugh so hard.
11:02 "throw money at problems" lmao. Thats kind of true hahahahaha
"haha, look joji did a filthy frank reference" comments incoming
Pertamax !
THAT AINT IT
Question can i make it without rhe octopus???
Joji needs to introduce Rich Brian to Ian, Max and Warren and they can all contribute to one hell of a cake video ;))
That intro song tho????????
Where's the subtitle?
Bobby Flay would girll yo ass
Joji stop pretending like u ain't ever rapped and made takoyaki at the same time before
Filthy prank..
"we got to pay him not to show up" bhahahahaha
3:49 ooh?!?!???
Wow, where did that come from?
We need an entire series of just the contrast between Joji and Brian's cooking styles, plus a supercut of Joji flinching at various things. But I love how you can totally tell Brian was raised by restaurateurs.
I’m just chillin making takoyaki balls erryday
Zero calcium grown up lady????
bad video
I prefer him as himself. I want to see more Joji.
3:03 why are the flakes moving
Make a damn filthy fank cameo like the whole internet would love to see. Especially in these pc times #weneedthefilth
4:09 MuchDank Please just do your Thing ??
An iconoclastic view into the culinary world of S P I C Y B O I S
close your eyes at 10:10
Depressed man cooks takoyaki and didn't rap
1:44 octopus balls hold up
was there still octopus in the desert takoyaki
88rising nambah onee
Takoyaki Takoyaki What's in your Pocketyaki?
I thought Joji was pretending to be terrible at cooking when he was Filthy Frank, but holy f*ck he's just naturally clumsy.
It's all flavor town again
New drinking game! Take a shot every time you hear "like". Good bye liver.
THIS AINT IT CHIEF
How awkward was it to film the skit in the beginning?
FYI Brian parents have a cafe in Jakarta so no wonder he's good with cooking
I just realized that Joji is 7 years older than Brian...
Rich Brian, the artist formerly known as Rich Chigga
i can relax
S/o to those of us who didn't even realise that YouTube went down.
When you think about it, it's pretty fucked that they're cooking Octopusses. They're really smart creatures.
Love this show
Ily!!!! ??????
8:28 Take me to FLAVORTOWN throwback feels :'((((
This is like Asian Beavis & Butt-head
Why is joji always hovering??????????
Chef
Rich Brian is the same age right now that I was when I first heard Partyisntover/Camfire/Bimmer by Tyler the Creator, the song he said he listened to as 'a little kid' I feel ancient
damn i thought the other eps were good with guests. shit is waaay better with just them
remember the days where joji made videos in his small shitty room? so weird to see this in comparison
Watching this so much and now “History” is my new jam.
God damn he uses the word like as a verbal crutch.
papa frank please come back
I want to go to the rice field boss
wwhere the chef at/
When Bryan said let it by your dick, I was like "nooooooo, that's not it!" but then I think again, they should really put it on the dick than just on the belly button
Best cooking show of 2018. I died at 10:25, please give us more Joji and Brian food content
show me dat stick boi
I'm so used to seeing Joji wear glasses as Filthy Frank that I didn't even notice until Brian pointed it out
Joji almost started to make frank voices but caught himself because he refuses to show that side of himself again...real shame
You guys should try making meme food Starting with hair cake
Joji and Brian are recurring characters in First We Feast. And I love i5
lolololol everytime I see joji it reminds me of filthy Frank lolololololol
3:42 am glad that i'm not the only person do that when i was a kid ????
easily their best episode yet. hilarious
Pretty sure joji knows how to cook a takoyaki
2:20 when grandpa comes round for thanksgiving
IM TAKIN YOU TO FLAVOR TOWN
i love it how awkward it is and how everybody acknowledges it but proceeds anyway
4:09 "Let ya nuts hang." -Joji, 2018
“Oh, wait not your dick.. your bellybutton”
Yo why is your house haunted with reappearing food?
9:17 That's... That's pretty dark
Is this Good Mythical Morning Feast...?
what is that song at 3:59 ?
LOVED SEEING YOU AND THE REST OF 88 IN ATL LAST NIGHT!
Throw money at problems
If i was JOJI I'll make a rat broth soup and some delicious hair cake
If you don’t burn your tongue eating takoyaki, you’re eating it wrong
I never realised how funny Joji when he's just being normal. Like this is his actual personality lolll
The best show ever made
Get Pink Guy in there his octopus ball game is fire
"We gotta pay him not to show up." lmao

Have you had sunglasses the whole time?
I never clicked on a First We Feast video so fast
filthy frank fans are so toxic lmao... YEEEESE!
How is Joji this bad at making Japanese food lol
Not hating or anything but I don't think you guys should make Filfthy Frank references in Joji new work since he doesn't seem to be really proud of his past works, let the man be who he want to be, let Joji be Joji :))
I'M A MURDERER
B I G N U T
When the world needed Franku most he vanished
I LOVE jojis sunglasses

That fat girls fake American accent was just so wannabe American. Jeez be original.
Impractical jokers owns this store
“easy to mess up” I get dollar tree cheese and bread and it’s bomb to me
Your giving away murray’s secret
I imagine Jasmin or Jake sneezed while walking around their caves. Right after they leave, a team in full hazmat and flamethrowers go in to decon the infected.
Lol
The narration is horrible and the self-video taking is too shaky.
its a shame because this is interesting but your voice ruins it
So they use real cheese. Thanks?
Stoned reporter
different narration pls
She has an annoying voice- not working.
The girl is ugly
Im pretty sure thats not how you wash your hands lol aren’t you supposed to scrub in between your fingers and wrist?
Pomade
can this chick talk any lazier
My last name is Gabbard to wow thought I would never see another far from where I live
"Now Murrary's is literally a cheese kingdom." Go back to school
Get a gimble to stable your camera
Fire everyone
Fire the voice over chick fuckin annoying
my cat just died today and I am crying right now?????????
I’m allergic to penicillin :’/
This video is to cheesy
“They also get washed with water regularly, to keep them drying out and cracking” WHY CANT PEOPLE SPEAK?? Keep them FROM drying out and cracking, this girl probably has a degree in journalism and communication, yet she is incompetent at even the most basic writing.
The way she says cheese is so cringe
Jake looks like the whitest to ever live
In the Netherlands we call it a “tosti”
Im expecting to get some information about the cheese sandwhich, but instead they talking about jesus?!
I’m not going to pay $9 for a grilled cheese
Buzzfeed video and presentation quality is so much better than this. Did you guys record this on a cellphone ?
Boring indian host
The amount of cancer this guy sells. Dairy is cancer stop eating that shit
This is Bob: ('v') Thats All You Need To Know.
Penecylin isnt actually safe for all people. Like me, I can't have that or I could possibly die
I literally know 15 year olds who can produce a better "video" than this within a day. Hire goddamn video/audio people, they're everywhere and hungry. This is sad.
I just feel that grilled cheese is something u make at home so why pay for at a store
Woooow I wish to smell all kind of those cheese
Gosh her voice is soo annoying
This is like saying your chick has the best puss* ,but if your bragging I guess I'll try it ??????
Most annoying voice ever
i wanna know who messes up grilled cheese
that's Cheesy
I want one now
I've watched so much of Mark Wiens I missed the face when you ate
Jasmin's shallow and uninspired commentary was in painful contrast to the exciting content and excellent production quality. WTF insider?
Who else licked their lips at 2:50
They could NOT have picked a more emotionless voiceover
it's literally NOT a cheese kingdom.
But of them suck.
Do cheese expired.....
WTF eatable things written by colour pen ??
This narrator sucks
Despite the very refined choice of cheeses, one can notice that the same level of care was not applied when choosing what type bread would make the best grilled cheese. Of course, "wonderbread"-like come as the natural choice, but in fact it's too dense to adequately form a crunchy crust while melting the cheese within. And that leads to the 2nd mistake, that's to press the sandwich while grilling it. By doing it, one presses out the air bubbles within the slice of bread, effectively losing the light texture the bread has, which plays a big part in discerning the flavors. The ideal grilled cheese would comprise a crunchy crust, thin but fluffy slice of white bread and slightly melted cheese (melted enough that is becomes creamy, but not too stringy). In order to achieve this, I would suggest using bread light as possible, one's favorite cheese mix (mine is gouda and requeijão), and, most importantly, grilling each side at a time with plenty of butter over LOW heat. By doing this, I assure your grilled cheese will get all 3 textures maximized to its best.
Wow the narrator gave me a fuckin headache. Someone get her fired
This ass grill cheese is better with potato bread
Cancer on a plate
But is it Gordon Ramsay good?
0:18 murrays grilled chesse is the best in nyc looks up best grilled cheese in nyc Murrays Grilled Cheese dosent show up
You need a good cameraman, at least. Srssly..
Good topic terrible performance from the narreators
Get another narrator
how did i went from perpetual energy to grilled cheese..
It always seems like Americans invent things which are like super normal here in Europe. "The cheese is aged for a year in a room which mimics a cave"!!! We have been doing this for hundreds of years in Europe????
these peeps crave the content more than the cheese
The narrator needs to get fired ASAP
Wtf is this..a high school video? Next.
Jasime you are so cute, I want you
Narrated for kids
Why is the NY Chedder orange? That can't be natural? Never seen orange cheese before....
She REALLY ANNOYS me.
Why did I assume it was Bill Murray?
They chose the most untalented and generic people to narrate this episode.
Mustard sauce in your grill cheese is so good. I like using tasty cheese with brie add mustard and tomato chutney. Yum
Narrator sounds like she's doing her job while on the toilet
Ancient cheesemakers also used to urinate on the cheese, it acted as a preservative and a flavor enhancer...
Wow. A 6minute video about a guy ( an executive chef LOL ) taking the philosophical side about putting some cheese between two slices of breed. “ it’s the butter amount, also the bread, and the cheese too”. Get a grip dude, please.
Narrator’s voice sounds like a voice over before the sex scene
Biggest mistake by having that Indian host
Consider using a stabiliser
I just ate a grilled cheese an hour ago and then I saw this on my Recommended YouTube page. I think I'm being watched! (I'm taking off my shorts)
Anyone else find the insider girl (the blonde) kind of irritating?? Idk why lol.
Jesus its cheese
I don't mean to be rude but the voice over sounds like a pornstar
My first thought when I heard the name Murray was about impractical jokers. don't know why XD
title: Murray's cheese payed us the most
dudeeee change the video's speed to 1.25 it sounds better and normal now
it's as if im hearing her read the script. please dont get mad, we're telling u this so u can improve :)
Please look at the lense, not the screen on the camera
these guys have to be the most boring and annoying people that could’ve done this
Can't I make this at home? Minus the hype..
gets hungry
Long Island? Percy Jackson fans, let's pack our bags abd go there
Cheesus ??
When I eat cheese I poop a lot
Why is America so obsessed with grilled cheese? Like. I love it, but.. It’s fried bread and cheese, it’s really not that special.
How do you mess up grilled cheese?
“Cave master”
What’s with everyone making fun of the narrators voice Some people have different voices plz stop judging the narrator’s voice
“My wife She make a cheese from her tit” -Borat
I've been there. It's fine.
wow he makes a sandwich in a sandwich maker ! legends hahahaha dude i buttered my sandwichs since i was a boy. comon that is clearly an easy home made lazy sandwich NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL.
Disliked because of the narrator
I mean superrrrrrr cruuuunchy
Garbage
the best grilled cheese is the one you make after waking up with a hangover
This video is intolerable because of the voice over
Producer Jasmins attitude is soo annoying
no my mom does
want eat!!<3
Now I want some grilled cheese at almost 11 pm. Dank it.
4:50 beefcake made me thirsty
I want to own this cheese factory xD
the narrator sound like she's sleepy
imagine the smell.
Chopsticks for my lips? 2:50
May I have a decillion slices please? Each with extra cheese thank you.
I just realized this is the same narrator in the video"Putting a steak in a log of butter"
I crave cheese
Only cheese I like is mozzarella
1:20 holy shakey cam
Yeah, whoever narrated this is slow and has no emotion besides boredom.
God she's cringy...
Holy mother of god's grandfather i need to have grilled cheese right now wtf that looks so good wtf
Is it just me or did i hear her say "jesus is used to be aged"
That's so boring though. Just bread and cheese.
What a terribly produced video... the whole experience was awkward, the narration was cringy and the lines were rehearsed. They literally offered nothing of substantial commentary. “I’m picky about my cheese, I like it to be creamy, I like to be able to... taste things.” No shit?
Narration was trash, sounded like she was reading a children’s book to a class of 2nd graders.
My mom makes insane grilled cheese...
5:24 “I’m picky about my cheese...I want it to taste things” ???????
Good topic, but absolutely terrible quality. Go watch a BA video or something. This is so subpar.
gets bread gets cheese cuts cheese puts cheese on the bread grills kicks throws eggs makes a mess throws cola How to basic.
The narrator speaks with "Valley Girl" accents, completely took the enthusiasm out of this video.
Wonder what it smells in that cheese cave
But where is my tomato soup ? ????
Ahh shit a video about a food place. I bet that 2 loaf and a few slices of melted cheese = 6.99.
Why does she sound like one of my voices on my gps.
Does the narrator have down syndrome?
They picked two of the most annoying two people to do this
the person narrating sounds as if they recorded with an earphone microphone.
Horrible narrator
Yes because searching "best grilled cheese in ny" on google definitely tells me its the "best"
Watching it at 1.5x because I can't
Stop looking at the screen and look at the camera lens
This is cheese heaven.
Yummylicious.
I'd rather rob a cheese cave than a bank honestly.
Gouda cheese nr1
When did it become okay to film on your Iphone. I won't ever take anyone seriously doing that
this is truly one of the worst videos i’ve seen in a while
I f8kn h8 moldy cheese. They taste gross. Brie cheese i can tolerate
I’m glad this video isn’t 3 minutes of the Asian girl cheese pulling and making funny faces.
Cheezers from regular show makes the best actually
why are these videos always so damn awkward and uncomfortable
I hate cheese but this looks sooooo good! XD
Why is the production and narration high school project level?
The narrator sounds like shes talking with her teeth clenched together.
So much hate for the narrator, I really liked it!
At 1:47 you incorrectly said that the cheese culture is covered with mold cultures like penicillin. That is incorrect. The mold you are speaking of is actually called Penicillium, that produces secondary metabolites like Penicillin. #fakefactsinsidershame
Who’s man is this narrator.
On bleecher street? How STRANGE. They must have a cheese DOCTOR.
Those cheese cave must be smelly ????
To the narrator, you need more practice
My friend steven makes the best cheese this video is fake
They secretly put crack in the cheese
they're so boring.
All the food insiders reporters are sooo FAT!!!
please use another narrator next time please
chopstick for lips? What does that suppose to mean...
She has to try to not talk so slow
the girl narrating sounds like a dumbass, and the script is bad. "they get washed with water regularly to keep them drying out"
Who made the song in the latter half of the video?
Grilled cheese chef?????
Cave master
The voice overs remind me of my middle school/high school video projects lol
The thing I like most about it is that it does not come off as pretentious, it does not use a gimmick or putting something different just for the sake of it. Because most fancy shops in cosmo cities do that and it just comes off as low attention grabbing tactics. But I don't know the price of it so I could be wrong.
cheese washing must be a great conversation starter. Where do you work? Oh I work in a cheese cave and I wash their cheese ‘-‘
Sub me.
This person’s voice is horrible. You need get someone else
I'm hungry now
Nice
Timestamp: 0:29 to 0:32 Annotation: You got that right
why do I always end up here at 2am lmao IM HUNGRY AF
Cheesus, it's like 20 pounds on a bread
I see heart attack
Schwiizer do?????
I want to show other dairy places the Murrays only cheese because it's not fair on them if only Murray has it.
voice is so annoying oml
The narrator sounds lazy
Got me fucked up if you think imma pay for a grilled cheese when I can cook it at home ?? if you can’t make one I’m sorry but you can’t go wrong.
I am talking about SUPER CRUNCHY
The place where no vegan goes
Stop abusing “literally” this store IS NOT LITERALLY A CHEESE KINGDOM. morons
Joey Tribbiabi would be proud
I'm lactose intolerant...
1:45 serendipity? Army?
Jasmin seems to be a non-native.
Do they make profits??
"Oh hey, what do you work as ?" "Oh im a CAVE MASTER "
I’m glad that there are no rats in the cheese storage
I love the part where they talked about cheese.
I'm hungry now.
’cave master’
What an annoying voice ??
yaaaaaaas girl
Mayonnaise is great ad well if you don't have butter ??
Insider is like Buzzfeed but lile 100 times better
Jake looks like a fat pete davidson
Just like curing flower in a jar :) dark, cold... Flavor.
I want this so bad
The whole video could have been explained in 30 seconds
Looks like paid advertisement with a low budget to me
prob costs like $20 after taxes
I can only eat my grrrred cheese with a thin layer of miracle whip or mayo or even spicy brown mustard on the inside, otherwise it’s just melted cheese on bread and dry af.
Lmao the narrator can stop. She is so annoying
C A L O R I E S
The music got me in some kinda feelin
Your hot jasmin do more food videos plz.
Watch at 1.25 speed :P
Get a professional narrator. This sounds like a high school project, it's embarrassing compared to Eater, Zagat and BuzzFeed.
0:27 I'm sorry but thats a lie, I've fucked up royally before and that sandwich still tasted amazing
Ace hotel NYC grill cheese!!
My panini press makes a better Grilled Cheese
I can't find a menu with prices but I feel like they would sell a grilled cheese for like $20...if so, nope
The narrator has no emotion in her voice and facial expression. It's really hard to watch....
"Best"?? that's BS
Super C R O N C H Y ????
Of course it's in NYC
It’s not grilled cheese without tomato soup, it’s just toast and cheese without it.
"What makes their grilled cheese the best?" Simple product and Marketing
What idiot messes up grilled cheese. If you can't make this or eggs than you don't belong in a kitchen
Okay....I'll have to go make my own now ....
I need a grilled cheese in my life.
1:53 this mold saved lives someone give that mold a nobel prize
Grilled cheese is idiot proof , seriously just use good cheese and not shit cheese duh !!! Not even going to watch this, useless !!!!
Yummy
One of those grilled cheese sandwiches is probably 1000 calories hahaha
LOL, his title is 'Cave Master', hahahah. I am laughing so hard. Badass.
Is it just me, or does the narrator seem dumb af? Like she has no clue what she’s talking about but
Holy cheese Son of a biscuit who didn't tell me about this!
lol @ Americans going to a restaurant to eat cheese toast
Americans find out what real cheese is ??????
this narrator is horrific ?? couldn’t finish the video lmao
INSIDER, can you do a video on Ice Cream Rolls?
brb my mom does better
Can kids eat it?
it’s the best in NYC. But can you find the best grilled cheese in the world ?
The narrator bores me
OMG It looks so tasty Well, i was talking about my lunch ????
Could any one please buy me Fortnite save the world
Who else is hungry like me?
Her voice is the most sickening voice they could’ve used
its looks good and professional
I feel hungry.
Cheesy!!!!!!!
When it says A google search my google assistant pop up
The artificial cave is a joke!! XD the air itself in the cave can drastically change the taste. This guy is just ageing cheese in a fridge.... And calling it a cave. If you want real cave mature cheddar look up, Cheddar Gorge UK you can order online. Damn... I like cheese
Narrator's voice sounds like a lazy college student. ??
I like my grilled cheese buttery and cheese
You call this a Tosti. Mwa seen better. NEDERLANDSE TOSTIE FANS VERZAMELENNNN
the vid is shaky af i now have an effing headache
No idea, I rather make my own, who the f pay for that crap
Looks and sounds divine ????
music ID @ 6:18 PLZ!
Osm cheese and nice
1:20 do they really have to be that obvious on reading the script next to the camera :/
Why does that look so gooooood!
I want one now please *rubs screen *
I don't mean to be offensive, but the voice-overs were super underwhelming and drab.
Dear friend, being a servant of hospitality is pleasing to Jesus Christ. Jesus ministry on Earth was a ministry of humble service. There is nothing pretentious about Jesus. He didn't expect special treatment. He did not chase after Fame. In fact on more than one occasion, Jesus told others to remain quiet about what they had seen Him do or hear Him say. What we learn from Jesus by His example is the importance of putting the needs of others ahead of our own. In the book of Philippians 2 : 3-4 it states, "In humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interest but each of you to the interest of others." Our life is not about the pursuit of comfort and recognition. On the contrary, in pursuing God's purposes, our life is second. This is one characteristic about Jesus that we can and should imitate. We are never more like Jesus than when we are serving others. The greatest act of love and humility occurred when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ freely suffered and gave His life for all of mankind. That through His death, burial and resurrection, all whom believe in Him may be saved from their sins. Begin your life of selfless humility by receiving the very One whom exhibits the true essence of humility. The Creator of the universe, the Alpha and the Omega, the Great I Am...Jesus Christ. Please find strength and comfort in praying the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, in our desire to be more hospitable, create in us a heart that aims to serve others in your name. May we discover that true greatness is not in fame or position but in Humble service. This we pray in Your mighty name, Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior. Amen! ??????
Vegan grilledCheese
Oh please. I make better ones.
Good idea. The script needs a little work. The rest will come with time and practice
It sucks being lactose intolerant...??????
John Deacon would be proud. Like if you get my reference. I probably won’t get many likes ?????
Any small or big Youtubers want to support each other?????
My heaven
Why am I attracted to Jasmin
"we took a trip to these caves to learn more on how they do it" ( ?° ?? ?°)
I saw the cheese
A google search proves they hold the title for the best cheese sandwich... what???
Why is everything in NYC?
The narrator (Jasmin?) sounds like she had to wake up super early on the day of the recording while recovering from hungover.
I HATE MELTED CHEESE. IM SORRY, BUT I DO,
Well it was a bad idea to watch this at 2:00 in the morning...
Why is it always New York or California that have these places? You never see someone out here in maryland doing shit like this.
2:29 - 2:40 a portrait of mutual hatred ??
Please wash your hands properly
my grandma makes the best grilled cheese in her house
Cool vid but PLEASE stop using the word "literally" inappropriately.
There’s no way it’s better then my mommas
The narrator sounds like a momo. Who hires these schmucks?!
Ok but why buy a grilled cheese when you can make it at home? Also a grilles cheese is not easy to mess up. That's a bunch of bs lol
It's probably like $10 for one grilled cheese, outrageous.
What’s so hard about making a grilled cheese?
Covered in penicillin. Not the icky kind of mold that's bad for you, so it's safe....LIES!!! I'm allergic to penicillin!! She's trying to kill me =-=
Now I’m hungry for grilled cheese
2:46 does she mean to keep them FROM drying out and cracking?
Can you guys please do a video on Studio C. They are a HILARIOUS comedy group ?????? Seriously... you need to do a video on them
When she said it’s totally safe it sounds so sarcastic
The employee in the cave is so over it.
Too bad I’m allergic to penicillin....
Lies Our mom's make the best grilled cheese sandwiches
"It's so simple, yet so easy to mess up. So how do they do it?" I assume the rest is how they make terrible grilled cheese sandwiches. And that's not how to pronounce Gouda. They should know better. (It's pronounced like how'da)
Ew
Voice over is so bad
Whenever I make grilled cheese, it BURNS
"NYC this NYC That" Tbh they need a new topic to talk about
It's 4am and I'm hungry..
This looks delicious
I can make a grilled cheese sandwich for free instead of having someone make it for me and paying for it
Any other lactose in tolerant people out there :’’) yep *suffers
GIMMMMMEEE THIS
America is fat asf
I torture myself by watching these vids lol

Introducing the new Grilled Cheese diet. Eat 3 grilled cheese sandwiches a day (and nothing else) and lose 10lbs a month!
When auto translate mentions “Jesus” instead of “Cheeses”
Fast for 4 days in a row lose weight, then take one bite of the grilled cheese sandwich here and gained it all back! That's how you balance out the universe.
What is that dude talking about if your ever going to New York don’t got to Time Square it fuckin sucks
Grilled cheese good grilled cheese
Looks so good and chewy
A spa for cheese. No wonder it's the best.
For some reason I can only have a cheese toastie with ham
Hey INSIDER, the video content is good, but both hosts suck cheese, no pun intended.
I hate that girl's fake accent
yeah... her voice kinda bothered me
Cheese ain’t even THAT good tbh
the cheese looks so satisfying at 0:07
All i can Say is its better than the $250 one Lol ????????
the narrator is so damn annoying
That’s an opinion ??
Liked the video AS SOON as Grey's Anatomy was mentioned! Carry on.....
Idk why but that woman's voice just makes me wanna punch her fsr, its just sounds so annoying, is it just me?
Yum !!!!!!!!!
Garbage, I wouldn’t feed it to my dog
Deli cheese
Shitty company use to promote their product, tastes like shit
Im hungryyyyyy!!!
Grilled cheese sandwish is never my favorite .... i like my sandwish with meat in it. Rarely eat bread with only cheese.
My mom did it better
I'm so early ayyyyyyye
This Indian chick isn’t right to present ,
I'm going to have two for lunch. Though I do not have Gourmet Cheeses or expensive bread, my Grilled Cheese is crunch on the top because i put shredded Parmigiano Regiano on the side that covers that sandwich.
What if they sneezed in there? lol
I would never pay for someone to make me a grilled cheese
I like how the don't add anything super special so it doesn't overpower the chese.
I'm sorry, but the narrators voice really annoys me like c'mon talk faster, geesus.
My mom used to work at a Murray's in Kentucky at a Kroger store...

"That Be 25 Dollars"
well, i have the best grilled cheese my apartment has to offer.
I don’t like cheese ???? I don’t know why I’m watching it
Usually I click on these videos and think it’s ridiculous how pretentious these NYC restaurants are, but this actually looks incredible. So far, the best grilled cheese I’ve ever had was one I made myself, after my friends and I hosted a fancy dinner party and made a glorious cheese fondue. We saved what was left over and I decided to make a grilled cheese with it. It was the most delicious, creamy, melty grilled cheese ever.
Look Gromit! Cheese!
You post this at 6AM sure Insider I’ll just drop everything and go get a damn grilled cheese ??
vegans has left the chat
oh holy cheese
Barney Stinson must be proud when you said " we got suited up"

I love grilled cheese sandwiches and this video is making me really hungry
1:48 I'm afraid you have Penicillium, the fungi used in cheese mixed up with Penicillin, the antibiotic... Good video anyways!
2:02 "cave master" what a fun job title. I'd love to introduce myself like that
Yummy
Indian version is called "butter toast" And its 10 Rs only.

GRILLED TO PERFECTION
Again with the fake accent .stop it?. ....??,"totally safe"??
Sorry never heard of it

"Murray's cheese cave" sounds like something on the dark side of pornhub ??

Great Video ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Remove this red hair person

5th
Yassssssssess
Hi
earlyyy
Second
2 ILY
First
They would have to pay me to eat that fatty mess!
This is a poorly explained video. The reason why kobe is so freaken expensive bc of how they raise the cow. The cow lives and eats like kings, and experience very minimal moving, marbling the meat with fat, making the steak much much more juicy and rich. In fact kobe is SO rich you shouldn't eat so much of it, hence the smaller portions. I'm sure that these restaurants have other dishes and courses to help fill you along the way, and not just beef. For once, I am disappointed in Insider for such a lacking video.
CANIBALISSIM! YOU GUYS ATE KOBE BRIANT!!!
Click-bait video with misleading title.
If it's really so good, what kind of idiot would put wasabe on it?
The steak costs more than cocaine. 110,000 dollars for a kilo of the steak. Time to smuggle some wagyu cows.
That small ass bite. Who are you trying to fool.
can i have the whole slab please
Kobe!
why does it look like waygu tho
K O B E
There’s a place near my house that has Kobe burgers but so expensive ??
KOEBAE! KOEBAE
I’d rather eat the girl out
Supply vs demand.
Is wagyu beef the same?
Wtf i a heccin kobe beef
"a piece"
screw that tiny little steak, I'm having the plate!
I can get a big beef cut for a lower price
I'd rather go to Japan to have a full course meal that includes A5 Wagyu at around the same price for just that cube
"heres why its so exclusive" "the restaurant recieves pieces that are 5-6 pounds they cut it into chunks"
Boi just kill a cow and eat it Sorry veggies and vegans
Y beef i ? it D:
When every bite cost you 84$.....
My mom would be able to make it if she had the beef :(
I've had it at the Encore hotel in Vegas
i still dont see why its so special store wise, yes its the only store to sells kobe beef but taste wise? tell us something about it. a little wasabi and seasongs, anyone could do that
Would it be rude to ask for A1 Its a joke please dont roast the hell out of me
tbh you rather go to japan for this and served it much better than this
May it be expensive or cheap, it will all fall on how you prepare it. I learned that on Molecular Gastronomists....from Shokugeki no Souma. Whole 3 fkn seasons! ??
when she ate it. it was so sexual
When you kill someone with a greadnade "Kobe!"
That title is very ominous
I’m ain’t paying shit for that
if u eat that your arteries are gonna be mad. look at it its full of fat
bullshit food
Don’t drop it
Um you know earth is gonna die and why are you killing animals then
My penis is more expensive
I'm 32 comment. WHERE IS EVERYBODY
84$ i rather eat a pizza than that small size food
WTF WHY SOOO SMALL BETTER IM BUYING BURGER IN MCDONALD BETTER THAN THOSE SHIT
Yeah i had this before its good but just taste like beef fat compared to dry age which has more beefy flavor with a reasonable and affordable price
Lmao one bite 20 bucks.
It’s not that exclusive because like diamonds, the limited availability is supplier controlled. Make it seem rare and unattainable , people will believe it’s expensive and spend more than they should.
normal beef is as yummy and fulfilling
Perhaps matsuzaka beef but it so damn expensive!!! ???????? Milionnare worth it!??
Must be an expensive cow... Poor baby
Utterly uninformative.
84 dollars go to Osaka japan they sell those 100gram is like 13dollar
Wooooo expensive , still buy numerous slabs of it
what happend to this video 11 thousand views 74 likes why as this video not been touched?
80$ for a piece of small steak no honey
My kidney is more expensive
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE COMMENTS?
My virginity is more expensive.
Two likes XD dont know why im laughing but this is insider right? Its like people have never heard of this channel before
But why is the meat itself expensive
Basic ass tips
That's what we in Australia call a BBQ, NOT a grill.
way off on the beef temps
oh man, this BBQ grill looks amazing, i usually get to use different utensils to cook a perfect bbq. i find a very good website where you can get as many as you want.. https://www.outsetinc.com/collections
https://www.facebook.com/BurgerimMiami/photos/a.411802012600547.1073741830.315843142196435/452860518494696/?type=3
Yeah baby Awesome !!!
Great... except the carbon remark. That made me laugh...
And you will remember all this with ??
Definitely American.
wow after purchasing barbecue grill...i found this e book...wow what a delicious recipes...,,, do try these recipies.. to know more click below link.... im damn sure you will not regret https://bit.ly/2rTH7TA
I've always been a big fan of Webers,>>>t.co/Al2rAFl5tP   and this one is no different. With a one-gallon can of charcoal it held almost 500° for almost two hours, and stayed well above 350° for at least that long afterward. VERY nice, and we love the color.
Anyone know what make of BBQ this is?
Was going good till the last tip.. oh and Carbon is not a carcinogen. We are carbon based life forms,we should be dead without grilling..
I soaked my timber in whiskey overnight ...... not a good idea. Nearly lost my eyebrows in the process of lighting it up.

When it becomes summer, I'm gonna grill everything ??
This was great, been searching for "making a barbecue" for a while now, and I think this has helped. You ever tried - Ariafan Barbecue Babassu - (do a google search ) ? Ive heard some unbelievable things about it and my work buddy got great results with it.
Many thanks, been searching for "cook charcoal bbq" for a while now, and I think this has helped. You ever tried - Ariafan Barbecue Babassu - (search on google ) ? Ive heard some great things about it and my buddy got amazing success with it.
Fuck yeah

Grilling. Steaks is. Interesting.
Charring CREATES carbon a CARCINOGEN. Holidaykitchen June 25 2009.
this is moronic.
4:21 That looks pretty charred to me.
Hahahaha vedgies on the grill? what a joke
Wire brushes are very dangerous to use.
@4:53 . Always cut steak against the grain and on a bias
Sorry, all of your meat is burned! My chikens will be very happy!
Carryover heat! Carryover!
Searing doesn't "seal" in juices... That is a myth.
Don't use a wire brush unless you want to send yourself or loved ones to the hospital for emergency surgery... ugh.
So mush wrong. "Searing holds in the juices" Also you should use a temp probe to get grill temp not your hand! And NEVER soak chips! And resting of meat has been de-bunked too.
So many myths in this video.
Makes my mouth water
First rule of grilling. Never use gas or charcoal, always use natural chunk.
Holy shit I tried this today, with Korean beef, chicken kabobs, salmon fillet and of course Veggies!! After we were done, my family needed a forklift to move my body from the patio to the house
tmas
Can someone tell me the average cooking time of raw chickens into a "SMOKELESS" grill?
Should say "tips for newbs". also, cowboys did not cook on stainless steel gas grills. Even for newbs, if they think they'll be grilling fairly regularly, a digital probe-style thermometer is a much better choice than an instant read. By the time you think you should check the meat, it could be overdone, and there's no going back. Get a thermo with multiple probes so you can track different meats, or meat and bbq temp.
IF THE FOOD LOOKS GOOD, EAT IT!
This video refers to the element Carbon, as a carcinogen. That is insane. Carbon is a fundamental building block of life. It is not a carcinogen. That is Jenny McCarthy levels of crazy. "My friend Paul breathes oxygen. Paul got cancer. Therefore, oxygen is a carcinogen." <-- wrong
I've found my own method. I sear both sides of the chicken leg on the grill for a few minutes then I place my chicken on the top rack where the backer burner is essentially allowing the heat to finish them off. it takes around 35-40 minutes but I've found for me and my family that my chicken always turns out amazingly. very juicy and tender. try it. gotta keep the lid closed. checking them every 10 minutes flipping them if need be.
searing doesnt seal in juices
0:13: you can't have more burnt than that!
I see so many things wrong in this video. Black meat causes cancer, and NEVER EVER grill your meat above open flames. Wait until your coals are red glowing but covered with white ash.
Can anyone answer me this? Do you cover the grill when your meat is almost done or during the beginning of grilling?
@4.17 - 'Charring creates carbon, a carcinogen.' What a load of crap. There is nothing carcinogenic about carbon. Get your facts straight before you spread your drivel across YouTube.
Wonderful video, liked, thanks for sharing, happy day to you!
140 for medium rare....not hardly. 125 to 130 tops.
Holy shit I tried this today, with Korean beef, chicken kabobs, salmon fillet and of course Veggies!! After we were done, my family needed a forklift to move my body from the patio to the house.
such a great tips!
GRILLED! NOT FRIED, GRILLED
Good tips, good refresher. I'm going to share this on my blog this weekend now that winter is over and the weather is more conducive to starting outside and grilling. http://notobsessedwithfood.blogspot.com
Excelentes concejos!
Gourmet vegan grilling: http://www.peta.org/living/food/10-best-vegan-bbq-recipes/?utm_campaign=090215%20Living%20E-News&utm_source=PETA%20E-Mail&utm_medium=Living%20E-News
Great video for beginners. ...but saying carbon is a carcinogen (4:15)?
I think everyone should know how to grill correctly. Who doesn't enjoy a mouth watering slab of grilled meat?
anyone know any good channels for cooking, shows a wide variety of different foods, and very good tips? Thanks!
Carbon is not a carcinogen, as stated in tip number 2. High temperature cooking of meats, such as grilling, will produce chemicals such as heterocyclic amines, benzopyrenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Wikipedia). These are the carcinogens to avoid, but the meat need not be charred black to produce them. So save grilling for special occasions (like weekends!), and eat your fruits and veggies. We will all die sometime, but for some of us, you're not really living if you don't grill once on awhile!
Great tips and resources.
Good basic tips...but you gotta be a little slow if you didnt already know most of this.
not to be a stickler, but this isn't bbq, it's grilling, bbq is smoking.
I smell fish taco...
cook for less time genius
I love bbq mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :)))
I'll bring the beer..
It's grill, not girl.
dont poke holes in the steak and dont over cook it
rule # 1 = Don't use a gas grill. Also, let steaks sit for an hour or two which negates rule 9 here for steaks only. - Me, born and raised in Texas.
every time i girl my stake it's drys up,even when it's marinated with sauce, any tips!
dont let the fire hit the meat, since the fire is burning from that stuff u put on the brickets (dont know the word in english), wont be very healthy ^^
I had a nice slab of steak for dinner tonight. Yummm... It was so good that I'm actually thinking about it now 4 hours later. :p
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm now i wanna eat a steak
Damn straight.
tip #1 use charcoal
i sat and ate a massive bag of bacon tasties while watching this...
# 3 - Up to a point, the more frequently you flip the meat, the juicier it will be. Flipping the meat, whether beef, poultry, or fish, every 30 - 60 seconds over high heat will give you the best results. Heat drives juices in the opposite direction so that they come up out of the top side of the meat. If you see a steak's juices pooling on the top of the steak, you've gone too long without flipping the meat and have lost a lot of its juices.
# 7 - If you use mesquite charcoal instead of briquettes, don't wait half an hour before putting the meat on. Mesquite charcoal burns hotter and faster than briquettes, so put the meat on ten to fifteen minutes after the charcoal catches fire, whether it's covered with ash or not. # 4 - Soaking wood chips in water just makes your food taste like wet wood. Place the chips, or better yet wood chunks, up against the coals on the outer edges where they'll smolder instead of burn.
write on youtube poulet mankal and u will see the video of the best chiken
How does this channel have less than 1k subs!? I really liked the feel of the video. Very helpful as well, as today I am potentially not burning wings today!
sad life, you probably don't even eat the chicken correctly?
You shouldn't cut the tips off, or all the moisture inside the main part of the wing escapes
I'm a stickler for a clean grill & chemical free burn.
You use lighter fluid fuck that it ruins the flavor
Hi, I save the tips of the wing and later cook them for when I need chicken broth. ??????
S
I don't care how you cook it or how you cut it. Just give me some wings!!
Wow, clean that grill once in a while, buddy! It looks gross from close range.
The neck, the feet and the inners are not yuck at all, mister. Feet, neck, liver, heart and gizzard we would fight for as kids when my mom used to make chicken soup. You guys just need to through away some preconceived notions if you want to be taken seriously as a real meat lover.
Wooow!!! Thank you very much for teaching us some tips for cooking in the bbq????????????????????looking delicious. Appreciate it!!????????
So wasteful throwing the tip. The skin and fat is so tasty on the tip. And there is meat. Awful awful waste
You are the grand champ ????
Underappreciated channel, thanks for the tips!
Clean your grill, man. Start ever just with clean grill.
Do you sell those shirts
What I did was flatten my charcoal right before the very top layer greyd, and it created a perfect temperature so that the wings wouldn’t burn
You lost me at cutting the wing tip! That’s my favorite part actually,and you can definitely eat all the crunchy skin on the little bones. Amazing! Try it
I guess it's a case of "one man's meat is another man's poison" but there's some serious abuse of the word inedible here. Many countries in South-East Asia enjoy and offer "Chicken knuckles" Deep fried and spiced chicken cartilage and skin as a bar snack. Having said that I really like and appreciate the tutorial. Subbed.
Quite frankly, if this is your method of trimming, you're doing it really dumb. Don't buy the full wing, just buy the precut wingettes. Nothing wrong with that if that's what you like (and the wingette probably is the best part of the wing anyway).
OK, so I'm very much opposed to cutting the wing tip...but I can tolerate that...but why are you cutting off that delicious excess skin on the wingette? p.s. "Get rid of the wing tip because we can't eat it, so why cook it?" Uhh, that little bit of skin on the wing tip is fucking delicious...you absolutely can eat it (no, not the whole thing, but that tip is my favorite piece to get what I can from).
You see all this meat on the chicken wing? You can’t eat it, so lets get rid of it!
So what’s that like 30 minutes on each side?
Your wrong !!!!!! Look up the keel!!!!
don't give lecture ,u stupid,just come to the point
What. no money shot? And dude, that grill is looking kind of disgusting, you should take more pride in your tools. Can't really comment about how the wings turned out since we didn't get a look at them. But an hour? Seriously?
Did he just say the best part if the wing is "inedible"???!!! ??????
Couldn't make it past two minutes need to stick to the oven Ol buddy
Michelob Ultra isn’t real beer, but the wings look good...
U need to do a weekly live summer show, where people can grill along with You while we crush a few bottles of suds.
Foolish white man... the wing tip is NOT inedible... I'm thinking about stopping the video now. Lol
Lighter fluid? Wtf
Great video, love the channel. I personally like to leave them whole, the tip makes for a crunchy treat if you put the work in. They are the lobster legs of chicken wings, not much meat but what’s there is worth chewing for!
Sorry dude, didn't work for me. Charcoal lighter fluid? FIRST big mistake, who even uses that anymore? Secondly, an hour for wings? NO WAY were those wings not completely dried out and over cooked.
Great video but an AWESOME backyard view! New subscriber now and thank you for posting!
I see the chicken in the logo!! I cook on a Weber and have a thermometer that I put in there. What temp should I have it at? Thanks in advance!
Not sure if I agree with your assertion that wrong tips are inedible. Lots of tasty weird stuff in there. Also, skin tastes delicious: no need to cut those wing flaps. Just challenging you to be a little more adventurous I guess.
i dont like you for some reason
The wing tip is not inedible!
I've never tried cooking the wings like this but they turned out SO GOOD!  My kids couldn't get enough and barely left any for me, lol!  I thought the JoJo rub was a great addition to the wings and YES, they were really crispy....thx for the vid!!!
Holy cow...er chicken! I tried the rub and the technique and I don’t think I want to make them any other way! I was totally skeptic that it would mimic frying but it was spot on. For a little extra crispiness I finished them over the hot coals and I was in wing heaven! Thank you very much for this video! ??
Dude chicken Gizzards Hearts & livers are great! wtfyta?
That little cape is good crust. Good video though.
a close up on the wings after its cooked would be nice
Thanks for the tips. Trying it right now. You’ll hear back from me if it doesn’t work out....lol
Wing tips are delicious!
I have a tiny (as in I bring to beach and tailgates) Weber kettle that I use often. But also cook wings on my Weber gas grill. When I cook them on the gas grill, I put all three zones on high. I fill up a little metal box with hickory wood chips and place on the back burner. After 5 to 10 minutes the chips start barely smoking, I then turn the front 2 burners on low/med-low. I let those cool while the chips get really smoking, 10 minutes or so. I then cook my wings on the front 2 zones. They come out great...
Trying this technique today.
Get ride of that little 'cape'? WTF dude? That is blasphemy!
I love wings cooked slow on the grill... also drinking beer while I wait! lol Great Video... new Sub!
Great logo
Actually normally I fry mine first... Then sauce and grill... I'm in the dirty South of Louisiana now though lol.. But yeah we buffalonians know our wings
All those little nubs and flaps.. Have the best flavors when they crisped up..jeez.. Breaks my heart to see the best parts cut out.. I'm born and raised in Buffalo... So I'm pretty up on the wings lol
Just in time for tomorrows SB party. Thanks I subscribed to your channel (gotta keep youtube happy) please return the flavor. (sorry for the pun) BTW, get a chimney and lose the Lighter Fluid
saying yuck to chicken feet and throwing away all that just made me not wanna watch... u dnt deserve tht tshirt
Lighter fluid? Really? Dude... you're better than that! Food looks great though!
Nice video ! Looks delicious
@2:50 he does a sassy move so naturally
amateur. lighter fluid, rub put on chicken unevenly, charcoal not ashed over and placed in the middle.
dudes got an youtube channel but has a busted ass grill without a thermometer.
They were not crispy.
Buddy, never use lighter fluid on your charcoal. Do you want your meat to taste like kerosene?
noooo you keep them whole dont cut off the wingtip, it adds character when they are seved, and the very end tip is so crispy and nice
Looked good. Would've tasted better (to me) without the lighter fluid. Personal preference. Looking forward to my first cook on my new Weber Performer deluxe this weekend. Happy Labor Day!
Its the flat, not the drumett?
Great video... you should change your intro to be in color
toss a block of hickory on those coals for some smoke flavor and this is a perfect technique.
Im using gas grill (char grill tru infrared) what temp and time should i be cooking this bad boys? thanks for your time!
a strong thumbs up, and the wings were good... but not quite a replacement for fried... similar with baked wings, slow cooked, etc... the best i've had/made is hot fat fry... i will continue to practice with the techniques you shared, and grilling has some obvious benefits... my critique is that grilling is too dry- and i equally critique fried wings that are greasy... i've tried your technique with your blend, straight s&p, lemon pepper, bbq sauce glaze, frank's glaze, a little more time, a little less time... pre-baking or slow cooker + grill comes to my mind as a middle ground solution... too much dry heat and a long time on the grill leaves the skin dry, not crispy
Cant eat the wing tip? Wtf? Dude...that the best part of the wing. Foh...
Great technique you used i actually do the same thing but i wished you would have used another set of tongs to flip your chicken after the first usage because there is still bacteria on them. Maybe you did but i think it's important to do so or talk about it because there are a lot of inexperienced grillers out there and they need to know about how to deal with chicken because they do carry plenty of bacteria. But other than that great job!
... he didn't test them to PROVE that they are crispy.
Yumm!! God Bless!! :D
Dude.... Save all that stuff you are cutting off..... it is edible.
Good video. Like the JoJo rub too
"...for you..the people" (LOL)
Why are you cutting off so much? You are losing from the beginning! Just butcher a WOG!!
seems trustworthy with the use of lighter fluid....
You know bout THAT!!!
Fires up his doobie man you smell that ?? smells gooood. We're gonna be eating good tonight Martha. ????
I am a 54 year old black woman in Lexington Mo. And I need you to know that this is food porn!!!and the narrator's voice is heaven!!!!
Works better with precooked bacon
I have thought about putting chorizo inside the peppers.
finally someone using real cheese no of that cream shit stuff..??????????
Gonna Smoke Me a Fatty!!!
Through the miracle of time,, I got in the way back machine and damned if this channel wasn't as good then as it is now! Carry on !
Thanks Merle Haggard!
Know this is an old video, but it is always "goood ". Happy new year!
The "white meat" is called the placenta.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WTF! THERE IS NO WHITE MEAT IN JALEPENOS......YOU ALSO PUT THE JALEPENO POPERS ON THE WRONG SIDE
THERE IS NO WHITE MEAT IN JALEPENOS
Smoke a fucken joint dogg!!!
'white meat' u mean the 'core'???
thanks for the recipe sir, I will attempt to make these this month.
it looks really good!! not of that betty crocker stuff... ( lol.)
Yo can tell these guys are a bunch of drunks and without youtube they would stay drunk
I really appreciated the " no cream cheese" remark. you got me there. I think I'm going to incorporate chorizo in the filling . thanks for the idea!
the cream cheese is the best
Realized this is when you switched from barbecue Web
Part of this video with your voice and that music reminded me of the outlaws prayer by Johnny Paycheck
I have learnt something I thought it was the seeds that was the heat thank you so much when you say sharp cheese does that mean a strong cheese here in the UK will try these love them
Damn good eatin'
Poppers are my favorite thing about Alabama haha
been wanting to try my own concoction of jalepenos, cream cheese and uncooked salmon wrapped in bacon, and today was that day. for as long as it took (almost 2 hours in the oven, at 400 degrees--might have been shorter had i flipped the suckers over sooner!--had assumed that they would fully cook on both sides--oops), i was pretty shocked that the salmon showed no trace of having dried out. was very hesitant about this recipe, as i could not find any other that used anything but smoked salmon. i have to give myself an a+ on the results, which i would only do if the food was magnificent. my three tips: flip the poppers over when the bacon looks cooked on one side (otherwise, time and energy are being wasted), make sure to give the jalepenos plenty of time to thoroughly cook, plus let the poppers cool down in the fridge completely, then heat them back up before eating, as they were very disappointing straight out of the oven. man, what an awesome recipe! could easily be done on the grill, but i was in no mood to cook outside in the middle of the day as i had steaks to grill up later on.
yep yep looks good I think I try they with my smoked ribs tonight I just got a mess of jalapeños this week so it's on thanks.
I hate cream cheese. Thank you for this recipe!! The only change I would make is to burn the bacon a bit more to make it crispy.
Makes left-over pizza look like shit.
Érdekes számomra !!! Gusztusos ! Köszönöm...
I would like these but would want a good cold beer before eating them
Tried this and stuck the dull end of the spoon thru my wife and stepped on the cat then fell into the boss who was waiting with a plate...so much for the promotion.  He in turn toppled over into the pool where the children were playing and this caused the littlest one to cry.  The next door neighbor jumped out of his chair trying to help the child and tripped over the family dog......I forgot were I was going with this story as I got drunk when I was BBQing
Really 9 mins for this!!! STOP taking so we can start eating already LOL
This is the only recipe I've found that doesn't use cream cheese! Looks fantastic
I wear latex exam gloves when i make these.  I learned the hard way that the oil from the peppers linger and may linger on the hand and find its way into, well.....places guys scratch
FYI, the "white meat" is the placenta.
"None of that cream cheese here. That's Betty Crocker stuff." I love that!
Tasty. I need to try the grilled version, what do you think of my recipe?
Taste 100x better with Carolina Reaper Peppers.
ok man this sounded a bit fucked up...lol
mouth watering right now. this is tonights dinners ty for sharing
Do you have a video on what kind of pit you're using?
why you guys cook a lot of bacon can you try beef or chicken....because i can't eat bacon
Im always looking for hot new jalapeno recipes im sure ill be giving this one a try.Thanks partner....
I want to grow pepper that hot but not as  hot as jalapeno ?
I like the adding back of the "white meat" capsaicin gland. Genius! Never did that part before
bacon wasn't done nor crisp....but,  i still love these guys.....
I am from San Diego originally  so I know peppers well...but now I live in the Philippines...we can get Jalapenos (which are med hot and dissipate the heat on the tongue rather quickly) the Jalapeno variety here are long and thin...not good for stuffing...so when I find the right pepper I will post it here...we can get chili relleno here on some local Mexican restaurants (which are mostly a joke) ...not nearly as good as this looks or as made at home
hala-peeener
I'm going to try these for the Super Bowl tomorrow. I'm going to add prosciutto and mozzarella cheese to change up the recipe.
I love the idea and the recipe.  The announcer's voice is great too!  The video is too slow and needs more editing though.  I almost fell asleep at the 4 minute mark. ;-)  Work on the script to speed up and get to the details.  Again, great information though!
Theyre way vetter with pineapple chunks in the cream cheese!
Def making these poppers as appetizers during the holidays.. Looks divine!
gonna try those next time ;-) looks guuud (y)
Sounds a tad like Vegemite in human form. Gastly yeast paste. Shiver. Lets pretend those are halloween monsters.
we call 'em Vegematics. They're politically motivated, veggie killers..!
Who the hell can dislike this? Some hardcore veganists maybe? Maybe I should become a humanist.
Just slice the edge of that jalapeñis so we can get in there........... No thanks.
I like his voice .... He sounds like he could sell anything,
my comment was about meat that isn't pork but I personally love chorizo.
35 still live at mommies house!
Go ahead get that white meat, ohh yeahhhh, that white meat baby. WHITE MEAT LOL
Mr teen Titan do you even realize where you are? Lid holder???? We hang lids on out rifles around here pal.
shrimp..? Sounds guuud..! -BBQ Pit Boys
yummmmmmmmmmmmmm
Love you guys channel
This guy can cook anything. I love it! :)
on this model for sure. We don't use it because it restricts full access to the grate and vid cameras.
This is a good video. I was just wondering if you know that your grill has a lid holder on the side of the dome. A lot of people put their lids on the ground but every Weber at least has a hook to hold the lid up. I just wanted to let you know if you didn't already.
Will try this in the summer
too funny
I normaly half mine, then stuff em with a pastry bag strip of cream cheese, then some chopped low & slow smoked bacon & chedder. Do em indirrect & they're awesome. I recently found a catch of 3 inch plus pppers and yeah I shelled out for a grill stand, it'll be like a chapaign glass of flavor & pain :)
Jalapeno peppers.. call the fire department ;)
doin some tonight for dinner along side some t-bones and sirloins for the family. i may wanna go take the white meat out of the jalapenos cuz i only took the seeds out of them when i prepped them and my grandmother might have a heart attack from the heat.
enjoyed it brother, that is next on the agenda... good video. Wait a minute .... are your Wolf Man Jack.... really enjoyed the vide.
mmm
That's nice Brother... Excellent! Definitely gonna make me some just like that :).
Wow!! Thats Good!
I made this last night. Very good! Romano cheese makes all the difference! Lots of heat! Thanks!
the best
time to go to jack in the box, for some what may call, a "jalapeno popper"
The background blues music....The narrating....The food.....The bacon...The "MaaaaaaaaaAAAAN"....The presentation...And the mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMHHHHHHHHHH maaaaaaAAAAN at the end..............................MAaan.....
Man that looks so good I can smell from here!!
Its best to cook them on the spot. You'll get the crunch of the pepper and the crisp of the bacon. reheating only makes the pepper and bacon become soft
I WANT JALAPENO POPPERS NAO!!!
I think the dislikes are because of the shit kickin audio......pretty stupid....the video and the recipe are great though.......really...stupid audio....
What's with the dislikes? Well produced good chow and easy recipie. I would rather drink an old Milwaukee with the crew than meet a movie star totally genuine guys.
drooling
I made these, added a bit of cilantro (because it was sitting there), garlic powder and salt/pepper and I used a whole slice of bacon but it was so thin that I needed it. Absolutely wonderful.
Looks great! It's hard to get that darn cream cheese in them-I like that real cheese! Now all you need is an ice cold beer!
Are those poppers something you could cook up in advance and then reheat on a gas grill later?
Are you hungry or? what?
I can eat about 10 of these at once. love them.
All I hear is "hella penis". Goddammit.
Nice, I usually fill my poppers with smoked string cheese. Wrapped in bacon, then wipe some BBQ sauce on them. That's how we do it in Wisconsin son.
@MetalEdge56 Actually, capsaicin is the chemical (which is an irritant to animals) found in peppers that create the burning sensation in your mouth. The white meat is generally referred to as the "membrane".
btw that white meat in jalapenos are called capsaicin
I was chewing gum and accidentally swallowed it cause i imagined i was eating this... >:(
what is the vent set to on the bottom?
lmfao @ that knife. you act manly:)
can rub some pancake or a little maple syrup on bacon slices--seems to serve same purpose as a toothpick adhering bacon to jalapenos. Just a little or will burn even on indirect. And while I love cheese cake, any sharp cheese is MUCH better for these. Thanks again, Pit Boys!
Where exactly is the house of sausage?
I don't think the heats in the white meat, usually that's the mildest part.
@phychmasher lol! Good call!
4:52. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Thank you. I HATE cream cheese!!
I sell my soul, if I could just reach out into the screen and grab that plate right now!!!
I just got my 1st big ole grill & having the time of my life grillin anything that in my way! When I fire her up, the dogs go runnin & hide! lol. Can't wait to start doin the chile grillin thing! Great video bro!
The "brothers" looking; "White meat, where?"
Man you guys rock, BEST grilling vids on the web!!! Don't stop!!!
Right at 1:30 "white meat is where all the heat is". Oops, I have been throwing away all the insides and wondered why mine weren't so spicy. So tonight I included a bit of the white meat and cheese to stuff ... yowsa that's hot stuff!
HALLUHPEENYUSSES!
1:08 jalapenis.
love me some halluhpeenyus
man we made some last night!!!!!! and man i tell u what im fixing to make some more today!!!!!!
Just made some with a cheese mix, minced onion and jalapeno wrapped with turkey bacon. I didn't include the core into the stuffing. Awesome!
Am hungry already!!!

@insanepiggy It seems to have last been polished up sometime around the American Civil War...
@rohandyy Come on down to the USA

@insanepiggy Just google "old hickory" knives
I love how you taste test every one of your dishes. Makes my mouth water...
!Let me... MMMMMMMM!" Even no apology this time ;D
I just got the hungries dun flung upon me!
looooooool funny and nice
Forget other countries, The United States has the best food anywhere.
oh man i am so hungry!!!!!!
@DavisKoziol some other fatty meat should do, possibly lamb, or possibly fatty beef sliced thin (with the fat and maybe some salt) should suit you requirements.
@jarenko Nothing he obviously prefers cheese with flavor. cream cheese has texture but its only flavor is slightly salty.
@salvamg89 Think he fix things with it? lol
mmmmm MMMM ill eat these bad boys when ever i wont screw my health hahah jk
@insanepiggy its a Old Hickory 10"? carbon steel butchers knife
i bet when this guy has letters in his mailbox, he open them with his machete
done the chilli, now i'm off to do this. looks amazing!
"None of that cream cheese, here we use real cheese." Hell yeah.
hellapinias
I prefer cream cheese
good video, good naration, and good eats
is this the dude from the Burger King commercial?
AKA Atomic Buffalo Turds. I made these for Super Bowl. Everybody who was brave enough to eat 'em loved 'em.
AWESOME video, you guys make grilling look so easy.
"MAN!"
lol BBQ pit boys cream cheese is wimpy!
that looks bloody lovely
too much work just eat the Jalapeno and be done with it. I agree with the voice comment you could be a narrator. Ok they do look good. You win my mouth is watering.
wow im impressed
Thanks for the awesome recipe! I love the twist by wrapping in bacon - so great!!
about to make this one :D
@slipmuc u tellin me im a wuss.... i was just trying to help people but u go ahead and keep burning yourself... as for the rest of us we like having safety ^^
I like the way he talks ! simply awesome recipe.
Goooooooooood.
too bad im allergic to to hot peppers U.U
hahahahahaha i know this guy is nuts
olololol
@leelovealiza oh come on... whuss... did that by mistake, ain't plesent but no worries.... thoug dealin' with habaneros or such can be dangerous...
Had to come back to this vid to 5 star and fav. Made these and they are goood!
He didn't mention that you should wear some cooking gloves when dealing with peppers. Cause you could seriously burn your hands if you got cuts, burn your eyes if you rub it or when you go use the bathroom. You know what I mean....LOL
thes are awsome fof every night!
These are awesome for game nights. :)
you smell that, smells good mmmmmmmmmmmmmhm
once again guys another hit. KEEP UP THE GUUD WORK
I made these and they are so good,thanks for the tips!!!
Yummmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
he should do voiceovers for movies. man that smells guuuuuuud.
12? Not even close. On your bell - bird scale a good fresh jalapeno might make it up to a 2. The Thai chiles have a Scoville rating 10 - 20 times higher than jalapenos.
i like how you sound...its so sexy
made these for breakfast and took some to my neighbors. we all loved em. just watchin ya make em made me hungry already.
"Your should spelled".........And You Say HE is a FAIL????...Fuckin' loser!
looks very good... and im hungry already...
Wow! I was thinking about jalapeno poppers that are breaded, but that bacon looks WAAAAY more delicious on them jalapenos! 5*'s BBQ pit boys!
"Your talking about a Liquid here." Your should spelled "You're" and liquid shouldn't have a capitalized "L". FAIL.
man...that looks guuh
bomb.
oooooooooooh man! i love you dudes!
its the same knif in all the video's?? lol man get a new one :)
Gracias Sean por tu clase de inglés. Y a los BBQ PIT BOYS, you guys RULES!

I've made them with the cream cheese and love them, just like this...this looks so good on the grill
i would no neighbors will get anything of that plate, only the sausage with the tooth picks lol
LMFAO
Do you leave the seeds in the bowl for the mix??Thnx in advance.
You make me want to give up being a vegan. Thank God I can adapt most of this to tofu (I live in China, don't ask). But thanks and keep up the awesome work!
i LOVE your catchfrase... can you smell that,,, it smells GOOODD... that makes mee sooo hungryy one question can u eat all of that alone?
No cream cheese here, thats a Betty Crocker thing HAHA your the best pitboys
I'm not a Jalapeno fan, but this video made me crave some!
mmmm, looks good! gonna try these with capsicums too for the kids! yet another great vid bbq pit boys!
I assumed that the bacon would have stuck to the grill more but, I guess not. Love your videos man !
:/ just your average Joe sixipack
wow, another great recipe! I have one similar: banana peppers stuffed w/ chorizo n chihuahua cheese wrapped in bacon. Thx bbqPitBoys for posting one great recipe after another. I've really learned a ton watching your show. I applaud your effort and can't thank you guys enough! Keep up the awesome work! --'que'in in Chicago-- GO BEARS!!!
slurp! i agree with the wimpy cream cheese XD
Never mind the boys ! The gurls can do this tooooooo!!!! Lip smacking !
can i hire u to cater my family reunion? lol
now that´s my kind of snack :P thx for the vid BBQ pit boys ^^
great job....thank you sir
I tried these last night along with some grilled burgers. Great stuff! I'm going to leave more of the Jalapeno pepper white meat in them next time. Can't go wrong with all that heat! Thanks for the inspiration!
My mouth is watering! Thanks for the recipe.
thanks for this great recipe. I love them charcoal weber grills !
"UHHHHHHHH-HMMMMM......Mannn!" (8:49)
well i wasn't trying to be sarcastic this dude just cam out of no where and was talking about steel and stuff like if know about steel
how ??? just because i think his knife looks nasty ???
Very nice! KtC
daaaaaaaaaaaam my mouth was watering and i couldn't even smell it or taste it.
uuuM ok
old hickory carbon steel....nuf said, boy!
really how is that a good knife
That's a good knife.
i'm not a chef but that knife looks really old and nasty
heat rating 12
Am not familiar with jalapeños... If bell peppers have a heat rating of 1 & Thai bird chillies are 10, how hot are jalapeños?
thats such a better way to cut the jalapeno, i was just cutting them in half...this way seems alot easier
no i cant smell that but i wish i can...and eat it too.
I have a question Mister BBQ, well you seen to know alot of recipes on the grill but i was wondering if it exist of course a breakfast recipe on the coals? Beside eggs and bacon in a pan, i can't see other stuffs than that.
well people that tend to be either gay or jewish do so .............
Now I know what to do with the bumper crop of jalapenos in our garden. Why are you not fat as a house anyway? LOL. We want a turkey vid!
feelin' real bad for ya, ganoosh, but that's OK! Ya gotta do what ya gotta do -BBQ Pit Boys
oh! this is a very good idea! that looks really good! Thanks BBQ Pit Boys :-)
Buenos dias. I have actually made these bad boys. They will get ya!! HAHA

y la carnita asada? >:v
a great video... lets follow each other so that we can connected.
Not too bad, but leave this for the pit boys... haha
Okay i gotta admit that was a really cool apron and a grillers dream!!
Yeah, that beer chicken came out raw as hell. I had to finish it in the oven for another 40 minutes. We got our grill to stay at 400-425 degrees (we couldn't get it down to 350) and we even cooked it for 40 minutes...flip...add bbq sauce...and cooked for 30 more minutes instead of the 10-15 they suggested and it still came out raw as hell. This is the second time a buzzfeed recipe sucked balls. Never again, yall. lol
it’s amazing
The food looks delicious ????
Is it me, or does grilled corn taste bad?
But I don’t have a grill RIP
so coool!
Hai disonorato l italia la mia patria meriti di bruciare
That music makes me sleepy
So delicious ?? I like it
For a minute there with the pizza I thought it said check for boneless lmao
???
No cheese on apron? Am disappointed...
Lol the heaviest apron ever
why why would you put all that stuff on your corn w h y
that pizza looked like it came straight outta the sims
A DIY!?!? HUHHHHHHHH????????
Can you guys do one video without the stupid white side bars? I feel like I'm watching on my 2008 square PC monitor
the biggest mood is the chicken sitting on the grill I just feel it on so many levels
Well, in Sweden where I live it's forbidden to set up a fire (including grills) because of the lack of rain. So I guess I won't be able to do any of these. :(
I am ready.
Set the beer can in boiling water for a few mins before violating the chicken with it, then add them to the grill
5:19 Nigga it's called an elota
Use a blowtorch to finish off the pizza as well, then add the basil.
Blowtorch the inside of the burgerbowls, chill, then do what you just did
Is it me or does the pizza look like a pizza gummy?
i love tastys recipes so much
And I'm just here sitting like "I wish I could cook" ????????
Why am i watching this, and i dont even own a grill.
I LOVE IT??
I LOVE IT??
Why are white people making this? What's with the pork? All I see are racist Nazis who support Trump.
I just ate and this made me hungry again lol
tasy
if you are wearing that apron at a BBQ not only is the food being grilled but you best believe your friends are going to grill you on how dumb you look
i thought she would place the apron in the griller...lol
Ultimate summer grill starter pack
For the pizza I recommend looking for bones, we always want that uuuuuhhhhhh, BONELESS pizza
Grilling chicken with a beer can inside is actually dangerous to your health. You know that, right?
One thing I learned after years of watching tasty videos: Americans put bbq sauce everywhere and cinnamon in every pastries. ??
I loved the ultimate grilling apron
When you live in Sweden so the fire and grilling ban is currently in action..... ;-;
I know this seems weird, but my family here in the UAE only grill in winter because you will die if you go outdoors in summer, we only go out for watermarks mostly, and it is much much cooler in the winter.
Very tasty.. Thank you so much for cheering this wonderful video
IMO grilled corn doesn't need toppings. (Mayo? Ew.) The one with the honey and herbs is the only one that looked appealing.
Not to be negative or anything but you’re a little late summer ends in like a week.????
Could u make a vegetarian edition? I‘ve been struggling to find some good recipes.
Please do Buffalo wings and ribs that fall of the bone ??
Pizza from steven universe
Honestly, this video would be worth watching JUST for the grilled pizza. It blew my mind that you can do that!

Ok to bad whole Sweden is burning so we can’t grill here. I’m still watching this tho
Ok tasty with the hacks ????
Weber gas grill grates are upside down. Should be flat side up.

In Sweden it isillegal to grill

How am I supposed to eat an apron?

Pizza, Needs more cheese
The pizza on the thumbnail looks like playdoh
Someone else who lives in Sweden and can't try these because of how hot it is rn and they've freaking banned grilling for the rest of the summer? Were are we going ughh. Hope they change their minds because it was raining a lot today.
Dave Seymour where are u
I know I’m not the only New Yorker watching this thinking how thick that pizza was and how nasty it would be for that reason.
No grilled corn with bukk ake?
They must’ve had a feast
WTF DID I JUST WATCH

Those looks so good but only down side is that i'm hungry now
Who else takes the whole butter stick and uses it to butter the corns instead of melting butter, its so satisfying to see he butter melt on contact with the hot corn.

4:41 “that grill will be perfectly toasted”
This is not purfect anywhere!!!!
Omg ! Doing cheese burgers and only 1 slizz of cheeze!!!!
cross contamination?
Some reason I can't hear my grill screaming.
What next, how to use a toilet? What in the hell is this world coming to?
how long do you cook the burgers? how do you know when to flip them? how did you know they were "perfect?" let's see the inside. totally useless tutorial
Awesome job tks fior keeping us manly !!
Use Cowboy brand charcoal, you will never go back to Kings ford!
Don't make a meat loaf.
Guys a dick. Why do Americans swear the you NEED grill marks? If it marks happen then let it happen but don’t focus on the grill marks. And I seen burgers stuffed with other ingredients and no it’s not a meatloaf. Only Americans eat meatloafs.
Trash burger advice lol
QUICK QUESTION!! I saw you posted the Temperature at 800 in the beginning with lid close when you threw the burgers on. After That you waited 3 to 4 minutes. My Question is during that 3 to 4 minutes is please show up the temp of the grill with the lid closed during those 3 to 4 minutes so we can see if we need to adjust the temperature down a bit from 800. If you do in fact need to turn it down what was the temperature during those first 3 to 4 minutes when you had the lid closed and the burger still cooking on the original side before you flipped it. THANK YOU!!!!
Damn is that a grill or an undersized coffin?
meatloaf ????????
How dare you stop making videos
It's been 5 years... did you ever take those other two burgers off the grill?!
Freddie Mercury eating burgers eh?
The big missing piece of information to me is how he knew the internal temperature was 150 vs 135 without piercing or using a probe?
?????
0 tips how to recognize that the meat is cooked. You don't check for pink you just kind of wing it. It's like the hoes just got a free burger and made a video to to say thanks for the guy. But the tips weren't even great cooking is science. This felt like whole lot of cocky prick bullshit . in polite terms anyone can shit a burger like that on the grill
You like salt like I do.. Instead of lubricating the grill with expensive olive oil, I like to spray my burgers with non-stick spray before I put them on. Healthier? No. But it also works very well. Keep grilling like a man. Thumbs up.
You only add olive oil on just one side of burger?
Was that a onion?
Pro tip: use a Hasty Bake!
This man is on the money.  Best burgers I ever made.  Thanks!
No nonsense, nothing fancy just a great grilled burger.
every time i grill patties, It tastes fking raw in the inside.. the whole thing just messed up..
freddy mercury is alive and well
Hmmmm...I can’t help but wonder why we didn’t get to see the inside of the burger after it was plated. Aaaaaaand, it’s always a must to protect the bottom bun from the hot burger so it doesn’t get soggy. Sorry....not impressed!
Looks like the type of burger Ron Swanson would make.
For the perfect flip use this: https://www.amazon.com/Yukon-Glory-YG-40066-Premium-Stainless/dp/B07GBHNGWM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1534188812&sr=8-1&keywords=yg-40066
Perfect grrrrilllerr
4:40 he said "that grill will be perfectly toasted" am i the only one that caught that?
Me personally: 1.)Get the best quality beef possible from local butcher. 2) I double grind the meat at home. 3.)Crack open bottle beer. 4.) Keep a sharp eye on my slick cat, that has ideas. 5.) Place food applicable gloves on hands to form burger patties. 6.) Form burger patties. 7. ) Cover burger patties with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and leave out on kitchen table for about an hour to come to just room temperature(This allows for cold meat to relax/rest, and if done right your burger patties won't curl or shrink as much). 8.)Preheat gas grill for at least 5 minutes. If using charcoal, follow directions on whatever kind you have. 9.) I brush (Clarified Butter on both sides of burger patties, and only season both sides with the best salt and pepper you normally use. 10.) Grill burger patties according to how done people prefer them. Obviously I'm a 'purist'. I also use and brush on clarified butter on the buns sometimes , then toast/grill lightly. Olive oil IMHO doesn't give your meat the best flavor compared to clarified butter. Side note: All my condiments etc., are already prepared and in refrigerator before burgers were started. The End...enjoy!
Thanks.  Great burgers!!!!!
Cheese is to melted!
I don't care if it's burgers or steak. If you cook it one split second longer than medium rare, you might as well eat your shoe because at that point your shoe will be more tender.
Man, how a simple video about grilling hamburgers makes people wanting to kill each other! How about some tolerance, guys.
80/20 burgers are greasy and tend to flare up and shrink too much. Poor choice for people that need burger tutorials to cook a burger.
you act like your so accurate with cooking times but you just leave them on the grill when doing the buns with time indicator .. one side gets 1 or 2 minutes longer than the other and u don't say shit !
Was that the same plate u put the raw patties on? Cross contamination!!!
How long do you keep it on the grill for each side?
Dude this works ! Works well! Be assured listen to this guy for some food so good get u laid! Like and subscribed... this guy is AWESOME !!!
So how much longer on the other side after you flip them???
I can dig it
I don't think a grill cover is needed.
Glares at my mom for putting onion soup mix in burgers for years as a kid Never, ever again!!
Different strokes. If I farted around with the cheese & buns when this guy does, the burger is grey all the way thru - tough & dry.
that is not cheese it`s a man made slice of chemicals,
Guy at the end - lose the 1970's pornstache.
Cue the guy at the end with the dry flavorless burger in his mouth. We all make burgers like this that's why we came yet you make the same thing. Your burgers were pillows too, everything but the outside is flavorless and no way it's not dry. Just pass the potato salad and beans so I can make mouthfuls edible.. whatever
Would recommend adding oil to the bread, and instead of the inside facing down flip it up so the outside of the burger looks and tastes crunchy. Would also recommend adding a bit of butter to the burgers.
Why does he look like bob from bobs burgers? ??
Ah, Superintendent Chalmers! Welcome! I hope you're prepared for an unforgettable luncheon!

Boil your burgers
Pigcasso hahahaha I love it
Bruv you are shit at this
Chef Ramsey is rolling his eyes now...
is this commedy?
What you said is so correct about making the perfect burgers and I love making them along with grilling steaks, but hate making hot dogs.
Look at that Pedostasche!
very nice, but where is the onions and tomatoes and lettuce?
Spot on! Yeah buddy! ??
I watched a news item a few years ago now about the dangers of closing the lid when grilling burgers. Apparently with the lid closed the juices and fat that drips down onto the flames or charcoal will sit there waiting for the extra burst of air that arrives as soon as you open the lid. They even showed a demonstration by the Fire department which was quite alarming. This poor guy on the news report was having a family bar-b-cue with burgers, sausages, and chicken, when he opened the lid the whole thing, burst into flames resulting in severe burns to his face and arms. His bar-b-cue was not faulty according to Fire department, you just got to be careful when using one. Enjoy your bar-b-cues people but be careful ok.
I ate a salad then I watched this video... Damnit
Those look like some damn good burgers!!!!!
Haha that's a meatloaf right on
I think he made just copy of some other guys or good chef , any way looks good !?? ?? ?? ??
If you think having pure meat in your burger without adding anything except salt just eat a piece of steak .Pleskavicas are way better than your burger and they are filled with bread crumbs eggs and other stuff.
What do you oil the grill with
Don't let your meat loaf!
FUCK YOU BRET
What kinda cheese do u use?
This is more or less how I have learned to grill burgers through trial and error. He doesn't mention anything about flare-ups or grill flame levels. I use a Weber propane grill. They seem prone to less flare ups. I preheat the grill on high for 5-10 minutes. There is no need to oil the Weber cast iron grates. Once the grill is preheated, I use the grill brush to ensure the grill is clean, turn flame to low, and grill 5 to 6 minutes per side with the lid down. This results in a juicy but well-done burger. Prior to grilling, I like to sprinkle seasoning on them. Salt and pepper is fine, but McCormick has a lot of different blends you can try to mix it up. Another key is to get good hamburger rolls and skip the cheapies. Cheap rolls are fine if you are grilling for a kid's birthday party, but for grown-ups you should step it up a notch.
Always season burgers AFTER you've cooked them. Very surprised so many people get this wrong!
You know the drill...
Worchester sauce, Little bit of garlic salt, pepper and a hit of orange zest. Let is rest for about an hour for a nice quick marinade. Cook to liking. Place white american cheese with half slice of ham before burgers are ready to exit the grill
900 degrees lol
Creepy ass mustache
We need more AoM on the YouTubes. This is great content, and so would the podcasts.
It might be a good idea to move that grill away from the house!
Cney meli ya
Are the burgers over HEAT or indirect
What did he oil the grill with?
Lol!on a gas grill thats cute!
says dont season burgers.....then begins to season his burgers!!! what an IDIOT!!!
stop saying Grill marks, cant eat a grill mark dude!
Yeah go cook a meatloaf
And at 4:43 I think you meant to say the buns will be perfectly toasted, not the grill??.
4:16 “The cheese is going to be perfectly melted.” Dog comes around corner Dog: “ Did you say cheese?!”

yep, the perfect burger is 2 fucking LBS.
I used a gas grill when I was working. Now being retired I only use my Weber Smokey Joe and kingsford hickory charcoal.. I love it.
Hamburgerth
I think Gordon Ramsey would differ
80/20 is for people who don't know how to grill. 85/15 is for people who know how to control the heat and want to get the most taste out of the meat. You want to taste beef.. not fat.
Thank you sir!
My home made burgers always turn into meatballs. I'll try you indentation trick.
look at that!! would ya look at that !? just look at that!!
You need a real mans grill. So you can cook with wood. Ok princess.
Thanks for the common sense video..lol
Great tips and advice here. Thanks for posting!!
4:10 you slam the lid and the dog comes running "Are they ready?!! No? ok i'll be back"
Awesome!
Is that real cheese or chemically altered plastique?
Do you keep the grill on high heat all the way through grilling the Burger
gas grills suck huge ass
NEVER poke the middle! That makes a tough overcooked spot. Its just a silly fad. If you know how to grill you can make a perfect burger without pressing the middle. Also, round those edges. Broken edges overcook. Place the burger on a super hot grill, after one minute, rotate it 90 degrees. After another minute, flip it. On its' final minute rotate 90 degrees again. Never press on a cooking patty.
Shit burger
Watch Gordon Ramsay maming burger!!!!
Processed cheese slices? Ewww. Use real cheese.
Good video.....
First tip. Use a real grill. Not that gas shit.
In my opinion, if you need to watch a how to video on making and grilling burgers you are definitely not manly.
Stupid question- Do you season both sides of the burger or is one enough? Thanks!
Can you use cooking spray on the grill?
My last 3 gas grills never got very hot at all. It's charcoal for me!
WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS BURGER?!!! NOTHING.
Less is more!! This method is highly recommended. Add some rabbit food and some helmans, bomb digity!!
1:34 Well, Chef Ramsay disagrees.
olive oil? you can but no need, and I add a bit of garlic, a matter of personal taste, and the salt and pepper will adhere to the meat, the fat will work as an excellent adhesive. only thing I won't do is grilling burger on a gas grill, the whole magic is doing it on charcoal...
Manly and ART don’t go together.
Very simple and basic. To the point with excellent advice. Not a ton of extra or advanced BS to complicate things. Love this.
Season both sides of the fucking burger. When you put the burgers on the grill, put the seasoned side down on the grill so you can season the other side of it too, pro tip.
How long do you have to grill each side to have a medium-well burger?
One of my "pet peeves" cross contamination all over the handle of my grill and probably everywhere else!
That was WAY too much salt.
Garbage.... we have no clue what the inside looked like
What type of a grill is this?
Alot of men acting like girls in the comments......saying " oh he touch the meat and then the salt" or " thats cross contamination" or "the grill is outside and bugs might get on the food" ??????...Cry me a river guys. Its a backyard not a five star restaurant. Calm down girlie boys. Hate to see guys with a marshmallow on a STICK over a campfire.
Fuck now I wanna fire up the grill
“perfectly toasted grill”
Next up, how to boil water.
And you call them steamed hams, despite the fact that they are obviously grilled?
A hamburger made from beef?
Oh boy. Took his advice and when you say “piping hot” it was piping hot all right... my whole grill was on fire on the inside cause of fat from burgers. It melted my thermostat and browned my stainless. The burgers were charcoal. Idk if it was a flair up or what but this did not work for me. Any suggestions?
With charcoal do I do direct heat or what? DO I even do a hot and cold side lol? PLease help me!
Who grills 4 burger patties, but yet prepares 2 sets of buns?! ????
Freddie Mercury ?
art of manliness "uses a propane grill" wtf is this shit?
no pickles, lettuce, tomatoe or sauces? wtf is this.
Just like I do it sweet now I know my wife is wrong thank you
You need more seasoning then salt and peper
What do you put in the meat??
FINALLY!!!..Someone else who butters and toasts the buns....It’s madness that people don’t do this!LOL
Very nice !!
he is working the meat way to much
Don't claim to be manly when ur using a fucking propane grill lol
For some reason I wanna slap this guy
Gotta try them on a griddle on top of a weber grill. Keeps them nice and juicy!!!
Y the fuck is this in my reccomended videos. I eat 2 burgers a day. I don't need the added cancer from watching this
Mine never look this good
Does it has to be olive oil? can you use any other oil.
A BIG TIP guys by watching this video (or any other delicious looking food cooking video)..... Don't watch it when you're hungry??
I’m a mans lady (tomboy) and Base most of my actions off of this
I almost forgot... To the guy who made this video I recommend the meat head bbq book.... A lot of the things you preach in this video have been proven to be myths....
Will your burger be "good"?? Probably but this is not the way to grill a perfect burger.... Everyone commenting... This is just one guys opinion... He's not a fuckin expert... Let him give you some tips and you can continue on your 6 hours YouTube binge
@4:16 the dog knows the burgers are almost done but then realizes you’re still filming so it vacates the shot.
ONIONS !!! ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!ONIONS !!!
Sure burgers not meatloaf but I do like a BIT of finely chopped onion in there.
I feel like this guy beats off to pictures of grill marks...
Meat is not fresh...
Burgers look very good. I put mine in the freezer just before going to the grill. It seems to help keep them together better. I am going to try the olive oil.
The well doesn't always work
Thanks for the video, what is that you oil the grill with?
Amen!
All of these techniques are from Chef Bobby Flay
What make is that grill?
Learned nothing. Cook it all the way thru? Do I need xray vision? How long per side?
Watched w/my daughter. The well in the center. I learned. Everything else i'm on par, if I had never grilled like my daughter. I would definitely be stoked if some one led me to this video. I also second the motion, cheese on burger before meat exits grille. & toast those buns!... [18°f went sledding all day. When you want a burger you want a burger. In the Heat or the Cold. why not? Still eats the same. God bless thanks for sharing.
MR BEN BOWLING
Panko goes in meatloaf not breadcrumbs
needs onion crums
Maybe I like meatloaf...
The most important point - grind your own burger! I use sirloin (from Kroger's "Manager Special" at 1/2 cost) and us an old 1960 grinder. I do use 1/2 t of a self-made rub with each piece of meat ground (no meatloaf). As the video says, don't squeeze the meat too tightly. Use common sense.
Is this Bubble's long lost brother teaching me how to cook a burger? I'm flustered at the moment.
was going so well until the processed crap was put on the burger why do americans always say `this is how to properly make burgers` then screw it all up with plastic cheese
Your great sir ! ???? thanks a lot for you advised. I’m ready to grill my hamburgers and stake
You have to laugh at you Americans,looking at the comments below it did not take long to turn this nice video on how to make a burger into a slanging match,made me chuckle ..
Slam that lid like a mayn
Tried this on my grill and only a minute or two on high turned the bottom to black hockey pucks. High my ass
I'm really looking for the grill settings
Again with the "grill marks". Your going to eat that dang thing. Who cares about gill marks.
Wish you do one for charcoal grill
My memre,God rest her soul,did good on everything except burgers. They came out like hockey pucks.
it should literally be against the law and punishable by firing squad to do any cooking show for any kind of meat and not show the actual finished portratyal of the meat sensationalized in the vid...................
Didn’t know freedy mercury wud be a presenter after queen
Everyone says the same stuff on these burger videos. Thumbs down cause I already heard all this on a different channel
Nice
Loved this video
My 5y old son is doing a better Burger then this shit tbh!
I was into this video until fucking cheese is brought up. I REALLY hate melted cheese on my burgers.
UNWATCHABLE: not drinking a ice cold beer while grilling
Crappiest burger Ive ever seen to be honest!
This "master" just toasted 2 buns and grilled 4 burgers lol
Nice getting raw mest juices on evrything u touched lol..
Next episode: The Art of Seasoning Both Sides
....olive oil.. look at those smoke and flames when turning the burger.. isnt that oil bad with that temperatur?
who is the Freddie Mercury looking nigga at the end?  LOL
The only mistake here is using bitch ass American cheese. Cheddar is the way to go!
lol at all these dainty nancyboys in here talking about chives and onions and eggs.. Fuck all that. I'm eating the burger because i want to fucking taste the beef! If I wanted onions i'd eat a fucking salad. All that extra bullshit, rabbit food and drowning the beef in sauces is so you can mask the fact that you don't actually like the flavor of beef. Because you're a fag.
overcooked
I always make home made burgers very similar to how u did yours, but i've never tried bbq-ing them untill today and they just melted through the grill, i was gutted, why did this happen, any tips would be much appreciated, thanks
Instructions unclear, I cooked the grill with the burger
Did he just put "American" in a perfectly good burger? That better have been cheddar
What's he using to oil the grill?
No cheese pleez!
butter the buns <---- critical
sukanegggeeerrrrdiiiikkkk
I don't eat meatloafs so I have no idea what he means by not seasoning the meat. I hate burgers without seasoning. The rest of the video is ok. But I think to be a perfect humberger you need seasoning otherwise is just a piece of grounded beef.
what size is the grinding meat on grinder 6 mm or 4 mm
You have to be pretty pathetic if you don't know how to grill.
Uh but McDonald's and burger kings flavor their burgers with onions and other stuff? Even Gordon Ramsay puts onions in. I guess I have been eating meatloaf burgers from fast foods? But they taste like normal burgers?? So I guess I'm still gonna put onions in to make it taste better. I don't think that people have to make it traditionally, just do anything to make it taste like a great burger. I guess it will be a meatloaf burger for other people.
Make sure you take the plastic off the cheese, very important!
"cheese"
I hate burgers ??
I didnt now Clark Gable like burgers.
I hate frozen burgers. The ones you made looking amazing.
Lmao every video he do the damn dog lurking in the background
One big mistake Karl; You need to grill those burgers on charcoal with a shallow grill lid on the grill.
I mix chillies and garlic into mine. olive oil on the burgers? I don't see the need.
You know he's white when he just use salt and pepper lmao
Why did Freddie Mercury show up in the beggining
I would assume Gordon Ramsay thinks of this guy as a donkey or an idiot sandwich because he insulted using garlic and other flavors on a burger
funny how after you mention" were cooking burgers here" then you bath the patties in olive oil....
i didbt know about the 20/80 ratio. thanks for the tip
This guys cross contamination skills are impeccable, my god man don't you know how to wash your hands before touching everything after touching raw meat
Did that start at 800 degrees? Mercy.
was this informative or is the aduince intended for allians first time on earth.
Awesome video, I'm going to try this recipe for my next video. It looks awesome.
I would think the center would be pink. He only cooked for for what, 6 minutes
Omg that dog at 4:15
Good video, now all you need to do is add some food handling tips, so no one gets sick from handling the beef.
Fantastic vid
Mistakes were made. You're supposed to put the burger season side down first so that you're seasoning it raw not cooked because it won't stay
Read it. Watch it. Do it. Thank you sir!
Good info but for the love of God, FOCUS!
"now I'm going to dig in to this burger"..... stop recording for a second i think in gonna be sick lol
what degrees?
Is it manly to speak with your mouth full?
dosent add anything to it? how not to grill a burger. Gordon Ramsay would rip him apart
Not sure I agree with cooking them all the way through. In most of Texas it's more common to grill any burger medium rare unless asked otherwise regardless of the source of the meat. Great video, thanks for the grilling tips!
Great info thanks!!!
Lol. Good video and good info. But ! I smoke my burgers. About an hour. Remember patience !!!!! well done and super juicy. If u want to cook in a hurry use a mf ing microwave. Good barbq takes a long time
The video was great until he said well done
Should you Salt and pepper both sides or not
well, American food, burned too much comparing to Chinese food. Do not get me wrong, I understand it is a really well cooked burger, since I have been around long enough, just has a general comment.
How much time does it stay on after you flip it?
4:15 hungry dog
Awesome dude! Gonna follow your techniques next time I grill some burgers.
love burgrrs
5:31 dude wanted that burger so bad opened his mouth even before biting the burger
ALWAYS SEASON THE MEAT FIRST!!!
If you can't grill a burger, just shoot yourself. You'll do us all a favor.
This is a plain salt pepper burger.
Are you married?
Every time I cook burgers the grease catches fire and I need to keep moving them
4:16 " ohhh not ready yet? ok i'll come back later"
Thanks for the tips man! I will test them this weekend!
Damn, this guy has never had a "meatloaf" burger!! I hate burgers with only salt and pepper, no flavor!!! I'd take a meatloaf burger any day. pff
everything but how long to cook on each side---the most important thing
No screaming hot grill so you don't have to press the center with your thumb, no olive oil because it will burn and the amount of salt and pepper put in there should of been divided in half and put on both sides of the burger. And do not close the lid until you melt the cheese. ....try this folks along with the other tips from the video and I guarantee a great burger and bun that isn't burnt. Oh and charcoal or wood, and it doesn't hurt to have a cold beer by ya.
Is it me or that is just too much salt?
FUCK! My mouth got juicy watching this video. 'Pause'
lol thank you burger instructor you're right
first time i done burgers they where burnt black but still good well for biscuits
Great vid! Thanks for the tips
I just made it like this and it was amasing
Super film! Pozdrawiam!
This guy ripped off Bobby Flay's video "Perfect Burger Recipe with Bobby Flay". Its almost word for word.
My kids said your video made me make the best burgers they ever had! Thanks.
If you're looking for the definitive burger-grilling tutorial, you have found it. No further looking required. Seriously, I've been cooking burgers following this same formula ever since I first saw this video a few years ago, and I've never had a dry, bland burger since. Genuinely good advice.
hank hill?
Instructions unclear. got my dick stuck on the grill
Great Job!
Lol shit Freddie Mercury lol
I watch your video over and over,. While I'm grilling .. Using an old Weber grill.. Short term memory .. Thank you tor helping me
just made this exact burger! the whole family is satisfied!!! thanks art of manliness!!!
yikes @ 5:20 that brick wall looks worst than your grill... WTF is with that square cheese too
flipping once doesn't matter
watch me poor this fat all over this patty.. ....that's already 20% fat. Professional rookies.
Manly huh?? He's using a fucking propane gas grill.. Get the hell outta here!!!
just a quick quisten, what do you use of/for oile on the grill, and what is it yous to put it on with? regards Anders, Denmark
But if you're gonna use an oil, use a neutral flavored oil with a high smoking point...
So he's concerned about food safety  but uses the same plate he had the raw burger meat on.
Meh. Zero special about this.
I did not know you only put salt and pepper on one side of the burger IV always seasoned both side! Was I wrong?
thanks. I'm a cook but barely starting on the grill which is hella hard for me
I'm confused on how I ended up on this video but I'M HUNGRY AS FUCK! ????
This is what you call a real burger not that McDonald's garbage
This is worthless! He didn't even tell us what to look for to know it is time to flip them! When the juices start to seep through on top, that's when you flip. Why is he closing the lid as they cook?? He is steaming them!
Thumbs up if your a women trying to learn how to grill and this helped a ton??
hi. which spartula did he take? esp which size?
Maravilhoso..Congratulations......
How to make a flavorless white People burger lmao
Looks amazing!
Haha at 4:15 the dog see the camera rolling and is like "Oh shit he's recording!!"
i love to over work the hamburger. Mmmm Mmmm Good
I thought that olive oil was Johnnie Walker
I'm trying to forget about chef Ramsey but I just heard olive oil so I'm watching all of his videos again
What cheese is that
I HATE grilling burgers. Flare ups drive me crazy.
U need a big green egg
What are you using to oil the grill.
im hungry
I'm watching this because my mom wants me to cook my own food ??
Whenever he's about to say something new, he starts with "again, "
Guy at the end looks like a Reno 911 cop.
no sauce?
The best artists have a touch of madness to them. This is one of those people. Thank you!!!
'MERICA!
looks good tho
if you want the diamond shaped grill marks, before you flip them rotate them 90 degrees. it makes them look pretty
freshly ground is also better
it will tastes better if you dont. you get more juiciness in every bite if you dont. i promise it tastes better
he flattend it. you dont do that
We're your burgers red inside
Epic LISP
Nice dog.
How many minutes do you keep the burgers in the grill after you flip it, including the time with the cheese on top? It seems like you keep it there for more than 3-4 minutes.
Olive oil on a burger? No thanks.
about 5 out 10..
I mix onions, garlic, salt and pepper with the ground beef. Call them meatloaf if you wish, they still taste better than your "burgers"
is that an onion you're using before putting the patties
I don't like melted cheese, can't taste it when its melted
I'll never understand the fascination with grill marks...
My BIGGEST pet pev is people who use cheap ass American processed cheese!!! Booo!! Spend the extra cash and have the cheese cut from the block. It doesn't cost that much more and the taste is way better.
good how-to video!!
Will 93% work on an electronic grill?
good video
I followed these instructions and my burgers were super rare, 3-4 minutes isn't long enough
People think if you cook a burger medium to well-done it will be dry and unflavored but those people dont know how to cook burgers truly well-done.. I just melt butter on the pan and sprinkle pepper and salt over the butter evenly and then slap the patty down and cook it for 3-4 mins on one side on medium heat. I then flip it over and immediately start basting the burger with the fat'n'buttery juices that collected on the pan from the burger for 4-6mins depending on how chubby the burger is. (This is where the magic happens) Then i cut the burger in half and turn them on their sides to start searing the middle of the burger to get the yummy caramelization on the inside. Finally I slap the 2 burger halfs on the pre-toasted bun and pour the remainder of juices from the pan onto the burger along with provolone cheese, romaine and a little ketchup and you got yourself a juicy well done burger bursting with flavor!
I thought you're supposed to let the burger rest for a minute before putting it on the bun ...
Eew no bread crumbs or eggs yup thats a meatloaf
This guy is a jackass. You absolutely want to flip it (at least) 3 times. Not only does it give you pretty grill marks, it ensure even cooking. Also, fuck anyone advocating cooking a well done burger. There is a special place in hell for people who like their meat well done.
Nothing in the video and nothing in the comments about bacon... you're just a bunch of girly men.
That looks amazing, but my burgers did not look like that. They looked like hokey pucks ????????
fellas if you are on a gas grill them you might as well cook them on your stove because that's all a gas grill is an outdoor stove,do your self a favor and switch to charcoal,starting and tending to a fire is the real art to manliness
About to grill my first burger, thanks for this video and tips. Aaaaaaaaaa!
https://youtu.be/-G-RqFZLiRs
you had me until you put American cheese on it. now I don't know if I can trust anything at al you say about anything. I put pepperjack and smoked swiss. American cheese is  abomination.
if you want a "perfect" burger, use gorden ramsay's recipe.
I really don't understand why people are obsessed about getting grill marks, you're going to eat the damn thing why should it matter lol
The purpose of breadcrumbs/egg isn't for flavour, it's for when the meat is lower quality. If you don't use egg or crumbs, the meat will often fall right apart into the grill.
im new to the grill, all the tips are awesome. turned out great. thank you
whenever we cook burgers on the grill; the grease drips down and causes major flame up. How do I prevent this?
Do you season both sides ?
Great tutorial and tips in this video, thanks :)
Really bro, fucking olive oil? Piss off.
Great stuff. Camera is never focused on the subject, but I got what I came for ;)
Awesome guys I followed your burger and steak instructions and they came out perfect .
Aight Bobby flay
Awesome video
everyone's always claiming how to make perfect burgers, they can't all be perfect!
how the fuck some homo's gonna talk about manly wtf smh
Do I have to slam the grill cover close too so I can grill like a man?
Not the olive oil again.
This guy is cheap. You cut the cheese off the block, like a real chef would do. Ask any pitmaster. Dont use that process stuff. And yes, I may only be eleven, but I have a grill. Also, if you add some extra seasonings, its fine. It all depends on what flavor you want.
a few quick comments (just my opinion): 1. the perfect burger is made on a charcoal grill. ask anyone who considers themselves a real pitmaster 2. there is no rhyme or reason to the "flip only once" method 3. burgers should be made to order. they are much juicier cooked medium and below and it is perfectly safe (i prefer medium). 4. i mix roasted garlic and onion into my burger along with dry spices and a tablespoon or 2 or homemade bbq sauce. many people have told me they are the best burgers they've ever had. you should put whatever you want in your burgers.
Lol you're touching everything with raw meat hands fucking idiot
getting on the grill today,getting meat ready.
Cool! Finally someone promoting a well-done burger!
There are fucking flies on your cutting board...gross dude.
Overuse of the word "again".
Freddy Mercury called he wants his body back.
Why 80/20 Hamburger, we usually get 90% lean. Is there a reason to get fattier meat?
You cant be manly and have other men make your burgers wtf
Clear instructions. Thank you! One question: should the burger be seasoned from one side or from both sides?
pretty good paddys.. But the cheese and bread on that thing is horrible. FAAAR from perfect.
Come on man Gas
One of the best ways I have found to stop burgers from puffing up in the middle is to press down on the burger with a plate after making it to give it a flat surface.
It's a propane grill lol
I can't wait to try this and the steaks, thanks team!!!!!
Aren't manly men big, you are kind wimpy.
American food
Just did the best burgers ever…..great tips…thank you!
Hello 80s Freddie Mercury
Not many people have a grill that can get up to 800° like in the video. How long did that grill take to warm up?
I liked nd subscribed not just cuz ima burgeroligist cuz I have a cool mustache too lol
"if you want a meatloaf, cook a meatloaf.... we're cooking BURGERS!!!"
i t s r e a l l y f u n n y hey thete, library peace % ...
That's a meat loaf lmao
great, you know what I gonna do tonight ;)
Having the first cookout of the year this weekend and wanted to make sure I have everything down. Yall's videos will help alot for me not to make the same BS mistakes others make. Thanks for the tips!
can you use the lava rock when you are grilling burgers?  how many times can you re-use the lava rock before it becomes unusable?
that is one Badass vid Mann. thought I was the bomb at making burgers, but now I'm gonna master them. can't wait!!!
Goddamn I'm hungry now. Looks fantastic.
If I want to cook a burger like that, do I need to keep slamming my grill closed too?
perfect
No actual information here just blah blah. Title of video is how to, he didn't mention the little dimple in the middle of the burger to keep it from plumping. This comment told you more about how to girll than this whole video unless you're retarded and have never cooked before in your life.
Anything with a grill mark is good
Too bad he ruined a good burger with plastic cheese.
He's ready for the burger @4:15
They'd be a hell of a lot better if you didn't use trash cheese on them. Use some real cheddar for fucks sake! Not that disgusting, cheap, oil-based "cheese product".
Dang that look good!
you just copied what bobby flay said.
Until next time its so dry lol
what do u mean oil the grill i am new
Couple of mistakes here: 1) It's best to salt the burgers at the last moment possible, so that the salt doesn't pull out moisture from the burger 2) FLIP the burger every 20 to 30 seconds. You will have less overcooked meat around the edges and more evenly cooked meat in the center. 3) Olive oil on a burger? No thanks, there is plenty of fat that will create a nice tasty char naturally
U R so stupid , the reason V 1 a football is round ?? 2 that is not a grill , the grill is next to the oven 3 a girl can also barbecue 4 you are not Jamie Oliver / DJBBQ
yummy
Is this a joke?
You tried to sound manly and then couldn't get that olive oil open hahaha wtf
I love the videos and you've just made me very very hungry. The only thing I'd point you should recommend is to use a meat thermometer. My good friend is a doctor at the local hospital and he sees at least two/three cases of people infected with E Coli. For ground beef, cook it to 160º F. I personally use the Chef Remi Cooking Thermometer which is perfect for grilling. Look forward in watching more cooking videos from you guys!
As always much appreciated information. Keep up the great work. Will 'Spider' Watson. Jeremiah 29:11
109 vegetarians gave this a Thumbs Down...
i miss america, i worked there as a student from europe in the summer of 2014 and damn i miss those burgers...:(
Amazing
Um you literally copied Bobby flay word for word
Thank you! Very helpful video and worked great on my new gas grill! For the first time, I grilled with confidence. :)
Nice video, but you should NEVER pepper meats before grilling. Pepper burns at 270 degrees and will impart a bitter taste into the meat.
why do u toast the buns
bobby flay copycat
I don't know if this is fucked up, but when I use my big green egg I add a tiny bit of my Marinade and vegetable oil to the bottom of the grill to give it some kick I add some to the burgers themselves. I'm only 13 I wanna know if that's bad.
What I like to do is just hit my wife repeatedly until she makes me a fucking burger
how do you know if the burger is cooked enough on one side before flipping
thanks for video I'm grilling right now
amazing work sir
hey are these degrees in Celsius or Fahrenheit
i have the weber genesis grill, how long should i cook the burger for on each side?
why does he put it straight on the grill my fam usually puts aluminum foil on it then put the meat on that ... that's kind of gross to just put it straight on the grill
Hi, what should be the temperature before I start grilling the burger? I have a WeberGrill.
Awesome! I'll try it tomorrow.  My mouth is watered! Thanks for the tips.
"Don't flip em too often now you don't wanna lose the juices. Yeah...yeah, coming along nicely. Those are cooking just fine. Scoop that one up and put it back down in the exact same spot."
Good tips
What kills me about all these grilling videos is, everyone who is presenting the video touches their raw meat, then touches everything else like their seasonings without washing their hands first. I am no germaphobe, but that is disgusting.
What is it with you fuckin' Americans and your salt?!
This works really well with veggie burgers too!
Great vid guys.
Love a Smokey Charcoal grilled burger! Gas is good but charcoal better. Ground Chuck 80/20 is best - need that fat for a juicy burger. I mix in some finely diced yellow onion, small amount of Liquid Smoke, little bit of Cumin, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Form the burgers, indent if desired and freeze 20 minutes before putting on the grill. Each burger should be about 1/3 to 1/2 pound after prepared. Get the coals hot, leave a spot for a can of Mesquite wood chips later. After the coals settle down to a glow put the can of wood chips in the middle. Wipe the top with some Olive Oil and let burn off a few minutes. Put the burgers on for about four minutes on each side (Hibatchi  grill). Toast some large buns and add cheese if desired, the last seconds before serving.
only thing is use tony's instead of salt and pepper
There is a lot of good tips n tricks in this video. Using ground chuck (80/20) is spot on.  No smashing the burger is also a good tip.  I think adjusting a burger after 2 minutes or so to get diamond shape grill marks can be with done great results. Doesn't make it taste better, but looks nicer!!!! Putting the indent in the center to prevent the fluff up is good idea that I heard of 20 years ago. Nothing new to me.  I have made a seasoned burger, using an onion soup mix, eggs and worchestire sauce. It was a very decent burger and was not meatloaf.  A simple salt/pepper seasoning is great too. But nothing wrong with additional seasoning either. If I am wanting onions on my burger, either chopped or sliced, I like to put them on top of the burger, adding the cheese and like he says, cover for a bit to melt the cheese. This keeps the onions on the burger, so that I can get the nutritional benefits of all the onion I am putting on it. There might not be much in romantic benefits that night, but at least we had a terrific burger meal !!!!
What does he use to oil the grill?
Don't you refrigerate the meat?
Dude, nicely done, brief video that said everything that needed to be said.  It worked.  Thanks.
So what's the temp. to put it on while grilling? I did this exact same thing, but left it on high for about 3,4 min. And it liked to have burned my grill down!!!thanks
coool thqnk
That's a handsome mustache.  Nice video.  thank you.
Looks like John Reep grilling and the Mexican from Napoleon  Dynamite.
Yesss, because of this video I am grilling burgers tonight!!!
Grill my ass. Thats not a grill. Its just gas stove in garden. Use live fire from live wood. Leave gas stoves in kitchen for our ladies to cook. Greetings from Europe where men cook on live fire, ladies on gas stoves.
"If you want a meat loaf cook a meat loaf were cooking burgers here today" I like this guy
Are you puertorrican
my only question is how do i keep the burgers from falling apart on the grill without using breadcrumbs and egg?
I absolutely love burgers... And the best burgers I've ever cooked, I used salt and pepper... That said, there's no problem with a meatloaf - ish burger. Take the art to the next level and I like to marinade my meatloaf burgers about 30 minutes prior! Most of the time I just like salt and pepper but other times I like flavored burgers.
a excelent video, keep in that way !!
I heard you should always refrigerate the burgers at least 20 minutes after forming into patties. And you always add the seasoning to the patties when you are immediately going to grill them.
Grill how long on each side?
Cool
Say what you will about adding nothing to the meat, but a little bit of Worcestershire mixed in before grilling, and it always tastes better! Don't believe it, do a side-by-side blind taste test ;-)
Hey! I just stick my burgers o the inside of the chimney flue and...wallaaaaah!!
Thanks for the tips. Was just told today that I cooked the best hamburger ever tasted. Felt great. Thank you!
Archer and his buddy.. good god, i love these burgers!
lol if you want a meatloaf cooka meatloaf lol
Because every time u open the grill ur losing heat in the grill
Why not just put the buns on the grill at the same time u put the cheese on they both take about 30 seconds to perfection any way
Best burgers IMO right off the fire pit. Put a few blocks up make a lil open chimney start a lil camp fire get sum coals going take a grills metal grill plate and stick it over the fire pit. Let heat up season thrown burgers on and u can season with smoke also with different types of wood fresher wood keeps it moist and smoky coals keep it hot. Cooks fast stays juicy and smokes the entire time with real wood. You can't have a bad burger. Even if you forget a burger by accident it still tastes a amazing over cooked literally premium jerky flavor with a juicy seasoned inside OMG they don't always make it to the bun haha
Using a gas BBQ is hardly the pinnacle of the 'Art of Manliness'
What olive oil? Light, standard, or extra virgin? They have different flavors and smoking points. What oil was used to oil the grill? Standard olive oil burns easily at a moderate temperature. Also, season one side only or both sides? Was the burger meat cold or at room temperature before it went on the grill? How long did you wait till you flipped the burger? This video would be alot more helpful with complete set of information.
HAHAHAHAHA you oughta you pack of fuckwits.....lol
You instructions are not that good. I got my dick stuck in the propane nozzle.
oh Lawd
Coping in n out
Yummy yummy..its making me hungry now..
I can't stop watching burger videos and really want a damn burger.. ugh..
Olive oil?!  Fail!
brb going to grill a burger :$
Wheres the tomatoe and onion?????
@Art of Manliness how much does it takes to cook each side in a charcoal grill?
What king of cheese is that
Way too quote bobby flay word for word
I like this method. The only thing I'd disagree with is the cheese. It looks a little over done. Maybe put it on at the same time as the buns, then they'd be perfect.
Wow He said everything bobby flay said in an interview and exactly the same too. Wonder who copied who... hmm Thanks for the tips though. they were great.
This guy don't know what he's doing. Doing burgers on a gas grill??? LOL. He must be from New York. And he still ended up with over cooked UFO burgers. He probably cooks steaks in a pan too.
I don't need all the extra stuff like BBQ sauce or whatever. Sometimes the perfect burger just has cheese and some ketchup just like the good ol' days.
Oh now, Mr. Kurt Hest, there's nothing wrong with a burger every now and then, we don't all eat celery and carrots every day like you do....
Awesome.. Perfect Burgers!!!
What temperature should I use on an indoor grill?
This is great! I wondered what I was doing wrong because my burgers have been coming out like "Hockey Pucks." I think the issue was that I used too much flame and just not the correct timing. Thanks for the video!
So if I don't smash it down how do I know if my burger is done? Also how long do you typically keep it on the each side when grilling?
Stop putting olive oil on everything people! Please.
It needs lattus :)
Nice lisp bro!
Yummy!  Raw meat hands all over the pepper and olive oil.  This is how I do my hamburgers and they are very tasty.
Karl sounds like John Gruden
Please clean your grill grates before they spread EBOLA!
Your awesome,thank you. The steaks I grilled were awsome
Reuses the same plate, cross contamination fool
I always toss the buns on at the same time as the cheese, then again I like my buns a little more toasty than this guy.
I've eaten burgers rare all the time, even raw, and I've never gotten sick from them. No need for people to get so stressed out about rare meat. I think it's crazy when people want to forget they're eating an animal.
How long did he cook it for?
can you give me an estimate of how many times per side approximately? Great vid by the way
HAMBRRRRGRRRS!
Great tips! Thanks so much!
You're digging in.... but where's mine ?!?!?!?  ME  SO  HUNGRY ! ! !
thank you for your manly burgers!
Thanks for the vid, but I was left uninformed... Cooking times vary with the thickness of the burger. You didn't mention what the ideal thickness should be, and your suggested cooking time was vague. You said, "3 - 4 minutes" on the first side... If you're cooking on a grill that's been heated to 700 degrees, a minute of cook time will make a huge difference! Also, you didn't say what the cook time should be once you flip the burger. However, the technique of making a dimple in the burger was great! Never thought to do that. Again, thanks for the vid. If you have a chance, would love to see another vid that fills in the blanks when it comes to specifics - burger thickness, grill temp, and cooking times for each side.
big mistake in putting those bunns on the grill dry ,,forget about buttering them,i put them on the burgers as there still cooking and after i flipped them the first time that way the bunns soak up the fatty juices then i grill em and get nice marks with no charring,the flavour is of that tallow and char on those bunns with the meat is extra flush lovely
CHARCOAL!!!!!
Perfect Burger, but the worst cheese in the world...
Olive oil on a burger?Where did he learn that crap, Jamie Oliver?This is not how you do a burger.Pepper will burn and leave a digusting taste to it.You should add that after finish grilling the patties.
This was an AWESOME video!! My grill was warming up today 6/15/14, my girlfriend's father was walking in the door on Father's Day and I needed to get those burgers cooked just right! I have gotten lucky and also botched plenty of meals grilling in the past by just winging it and hoping for the best. But this time I was not leaving it to chance. I jotted down notes from this 6 minute video and immediately followed them to a "T"- Real HOT grill/Burgers w/dent in the middle/Cheese 30-40 seconds/Buns buttered and grilled 15-30 seconds- all absolutely PERFECT!!!!!
flipping once is important, not multiple times, only that keeps it juice
Flipping one time is another myth (google is your friend). Flipping it multiple times is actually better.
So i flip it 4 mins.. How long do i let it sit there. To cook through the buger?
Thx 4 the awsome tips dude! its burger time!
Thx 4 the awsome tips dude! its burger time!
Sausage burgers are highly underrated. I recommend everyone try them. They're pretty fun and super easy to cook.
love it  "thats a meatloaf"  we are cooking burgers here today :)
4:38 - Glad the grill will be perfectly toasted! What about the buns? ;o)
For those who disagree with the tip to only flip the meat once: if you're cooking it in a pan or one a griddle, then the number of flips isn't important; but if you're cooking it on a grill, flipping back and forth will cause confused, overlapping, weak grill marks. It's about appearance more than anything else.
OHHH Boys !!!!    I´m from Brazil, and I just can not make american burgers like that.  I just can not make it taste the same as yours.  I think its the ingredients, I don´t know !!!  But congratulatios for the videos !!!  Best to you all, Eduardo Avallone.'.
DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS GUYS ATTITUDE...HE NEEDS A GOOD SLAP
20% fat in a burger? And tons of cheese? Wow, I wonder why obesity is running wild in the US. Oh you should also put even more salt on those burgers, so your blood pressure gets even higher.
do i keep them on direct or indirect heat?
do i keep them on direct or indirect heat?
Art of manliness and he doesnt have a beard lol bye
Actually, scientifically flipping once is perfect if you want to maximise the amount of overcooked meat. Flipping often makes for a more even cooked burger that is closer to medium rare than charcoal. The flip once idea is just a bunch of unfounded hot air.
4:40 the grill wont be toasted, the buns will be silly
do you guy have  the art of grilling: how to grill chicken that would be great
It's not caramelization when it comes to meat, the proper term is the Maillard reaction...
Why is everyone pretentious when giving grilling tips, there's multiple ways to make good food, and common sense tips like dont squish the meat....and spark up some charcoal like a man since we're being pretentious lol
I disagree with his idea of not seasoning the meat.  Definitely worth the time to add seasoning to the beef as you are making your patties.  It's not making a "meatloaf". It's adding flavor.
How to grill a hamburger: don't. For one, hamburgers ought to be made on a pan. For second, using a grill to make a hamburger is a waste of time and resources. Make steaks or better, go to a Mexican carniceria and get some carne asada to grill.
All those tips you should've mentioned not touching cooked food with bare hands. Clean or not. Also, here's a tip for you... not everyone likes their food barely seasoned, so the meat loaf comment was unnecessary.
4 minutes each side.. this shit is way overcooked
Merican.
Anyone know what kind of cheese he's using?
I am sooo showing my dad this. His burgers suck!!!
You lose 7 man points for use of the word "yummy". 8-( You can gain back 4 points (sorry, still must lose the other 3 due to the original offense) by reposting and substituting the word "larrupin!" 8-)
I like to put my cheese on when the burger is taken off the grill, so the cheese has a little "body" to it. But the main ingredient is the one he's not using...CHARCOAL!
I like trus
says "the key to burgers is to flip them one time" yet gives no reasoning for this. not only is it not "key" but it's completely wrong. flipping often makes them cook more evenly and they get done in 2/3 the time!
I did the method described in the video but my burgers were red on the inside and over seasoned. I will try to let each side of the burger cook for 5 to 6 minutes next time. What should I do about the seasoning? I seasoned both sides with a sprinkle of salt and a dabble of olive oil.
What about the meat loaf? I came here for the meat loaf...
Hell yeah 3:56 throw some cheese on those bitches!
SHIT!! this looks yummy, man i'm gonna make me some burgers rite now
One day
I think it's kosher salt.
He have the first side 3-4 min, then flipped to the other side for another 3-4. Dip a clean rag in the same type of oil you apply to the burger when seasoning.
I'm a total noob in grilling. How do you know when to flip the burger? Also, what was that oil he used on the grill before putting the burgers on?
Yum!
Cross contamination! Lol
What kinda salt is that? It doesn't look like your normal sized table salt.
I tried this today, outside of the burger looked great, trouble was that the inside was still pretty red. likely because I'm not used to cooking burgers so fast. I usually kept the grill at about 200F and they always turn out medium-well and very juicy for me, so I'll probably stick to that, though the seasoning was awesome and the olive oil made a huge difference in taste. Suggestion for future grilling videos: chicken, fish, and ribs (marinades, rubs, etc)
I second this
jerky! how to??
Nice!!
Any advice on when to flip and when it's done? That's the hard part. Is it timing or temp or firmness?
Want any meat with that salt?
This is a great series. Really good information.
Are you going to do one on chicken?
Great video, well done!!
I want one of these burgers now.
very helpful videos. ive always wanted to learn how to prepare the meat under ground
Damn now I want a fresh flame grilled burger. Better not be watching this on an empty stomach!
Should one fry the bacon seperately before making the burgers or is it possible to grill the strips at the same time? Great video BTW.
Essential 4th of July know-how.
What's up with the fly hanging out on your cutting board?
Nah, you have got to add stuff to burger meat, otherwise it's just a puck of cow.
Very awesome. Thanks for that :)
You can call that food if you want to, but you can't call that cheese.
I will never understand why people eat yellow plastic with their meat.
Download file EpicMealTime
I wish I could download food
good stuff
I love this channel! Hope it get more and more popular!
Now we need to know how to grill some squirrel.
Awesome series!
Ack dude, a egg in a burger kicks arse.
Delicious
Well this was pretty fun to try! (apart from the egg, but maybe i'll beat it next time for an omelette)..... If you'd like to try a normal cooked breakfast, try here's a recipe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyQi__utmgU&vl=en More MVK tries on this playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgzxe7jJ6oA&list=PLfItiEY3o1msmCdkx49hQcmgh39L02lf5
Please do a slow cooker quiche
Seems we shop at the same argos ??
My suggestion would be to put the bacon in the empty space instead of a cup. Plus I would put the cup for the egg in but not the egg and half way through cooking I would turn the sausages down the bacon and then add your egg.
Jar tongs would work well for taking those out of the crock pot.
In the slow cooker you should try making sausage casoroll , spagball and chillier con carne all amazing stuff what you can make.
Spider-Man PS4 is a very good game
Softsages
I like Roast Beef with carrots potatoes and gravy in crock pots as well as meatballs. I don't recommend doing breakfast in them. Chili is okay in a crock pot. If you haven't tried those in your crock pot, that's the way to go if you want something in a few hours. I think you can probably do BBQ pulled pork for BBQ sandwiches in a Crock Pot too.
Your wife is beautiful very lucky man
8 months pregnant, and this channel is my current favourite pass time
Remember.... That grilled cheese was cause 120v doesn't do well on UK sockets. Not cause you left it on for too long ??
please dont baptise children in a crockpot barry.
This looks like dinner. Breakfast doesn't include beans. Those are for dinner or barbecue
Lo
I can't decide if you're 15 or 55...
I’ve never recognised a place in a YouTube video before, me and my partner have watched you for years mainly for your giant recreating videos turns out you’re really local to me so it’s nice to know I can get all the ingredients I’ve been worried I can’t get in my local shops! And maybe you’re the reason I can never buy chocolate for cooking ??
Can you make clotted cream in a slow cooker?
As an American I find it so funny that you thought a crock pot was something Western but it's literally just a slow cooker LMAO (side note I love your guys's lingo or names for things like hob for the stove????)
The way he said Barry can you please do crock pot recipes ??
Better start this when you go to bed if you want breakfast.
Nice try, but be honest: If you can't dip your sausage in the egg yolk, then it hasn't really worked has it? The mushrooms would have been improved by adding a tablespoon of water and a nob of butter/margarine at the start; (this also produces great microwaved mushrooms too!) I'm concerned that you used the correct kind of clingfilm. With certain types, they're not meant for cooking, because the plasticizers in them can become carcinogenic when hot.. (but then if that's a price you're willing to pay to have beans and tomatoes with your breakfast!.....)
was so shocked when i seen him in my local argos woah wtf
Crock-Pot are awesome. If you don't feel like bringing out a lot of pots and pans to cook. Plus easy clean up if you use a liner.
make the really cool slow cooked fritata
I like watching these to learn the do's and don't's. I've done french toast casserole in a crock pot, and apple crisp as well. Now I know I can do sausage and mushrooms as well.
I make food in a slow cooker all the time, my favorite is soups and dishes with chicken, roasts or brisket. I would recommend a little exploring on the web for recipes ( I did) , I even made pizza in my crock pot! lol
I am not in the slightest bit surprised the egg was terrible XD
Do u really think something you buy from argos would have a us plug??
You can cook this whole breakfast at a time when you want it quicker than loading up this cooker
You’re hilarious! Love this so much ??
Your Daughter is so British. That's so noice".
Okay sure, you could... or you could make a cooked breakfast in 15 minutes (at most) in a frying pan.
Barry kills me “you can baptize children in this thing.” XD
Would it not be better to bain marie the beans ETC in their tins than having the rammikins?
barry!!! i had to stop the video at the "mushroom" pun hahahaha .. ok back to the video!
Is that Worle?
Was it worth wait as it doesn't take long to cook a breakfast
Barry with a five o-clock shadow is kinda cute. Grow out that mustache!
Why dident he cook it the night before? Lol
Tomatoes in traditional English breakfast? They don’t grow there :(
Obviously it's going to be an UK plug socket you bell, you bought it from Argos!!
Make pierogis please?
CHEATING..... You needed to have slow toasted toast !!!
Why don't people just learn to cook?
Tried to fob your daughter off with a mushroom she knew better to go for the sausages. So glad to have found this channel its really good and am enjoying it all so far. Keep up the great work
Great idea! So many possibilities and experiments!
Omg was that Argos in Blackburn?
Hahaha her face when you asked if she wants to try the egg
Love the mushroom, much room joke. You're such a fun guy.
You could put it on a higer setting
The final result was sooo amazing! Great job, Barry! :D
Lol I can baptize children in this thing ... Well I'm an atheist ... I can cook all the babies I want ????????
By the time you've pissed about the night before getting all the ingredients ready in separate, covered compartments, you've spent almost the time you would have done cooking it fresh in the morning...with more crocks to wash. Sounds like a ploy to sell slow cookers to me.
Are You dutch? Your titel and Description is in Dutch?
i got that refrence
Tory
try a salad.
"I love, I am absolutely addicted to Fried mushrooms. I once ate a bowl of them" I'm absolutely addicted to beer, I had a pint once.
Mate could you just cook the breakfast without talking
I get a sneaking suspicion I purchased my slow cooker from the same Argos you purchased yours. Grabbed a few ingredients from Sainsbury's at the same time.
So I have done this before I am American so its more American tho I do the mushrooms I put a little butter in with them the eggs you have put it in a bowl of water to keep the heat down and prevent scorching or put it in towads the I do hashbrowns in place of the beans and tomatoes and I cheated and used frozen hashbrowns just added the onions and I put directly on the bottom of the crock and then put the bacon on top if them all you have to do is at the end of cooking I pulled the bacon off the browns and added cheese
Great Mr Majeika reference. Still use that reference myself describe unruly tufts of hair.
Why? Using a slow cooker for breakfast is idiotic.
That was a great trial. I would be inclined to add a little water to the bottom of the slow cooker dish before adding all the stuff, then everything would steam and cook more evenly. This method was never going to produce a good fried egg but since an omelette only takes two minutes to make - about the same time your toaster and kettle takes - then I would cook them separately at the end. Great video, thanks!
Cling film carcinogenic, when heated ( like all plastics) - avoid contact with food
I've seen you through Ashens channel a bunch of times. Then I watched the rotten Herring video and got onto this channel. When I saw where you went to buy the slow cooker I was tickled pink! I also live in sunny old Heston Blumenthal! Honestly, I'm so entertained!
did you get this idea from This Morning?
- the egg and bacon I will demolish this in 60 seconds without trying ??
Bit of butter in the mushrooms
Looks like a wether spoons breakfast
Dumb.
Your daughter has got great manners, good to see. Keep on dadding bro.
lol worth watching for your wife's reaction, I think it's a no
“Do you want a egg :D” “No thank you o-o” xD
Barry, sometimes you are such a dad xD
Pretty sure crockpot is like Kleenex not what it is, just a common brand
Your a brave man.
I’d rather walk down the cafe ,cheaper and no washing up
I'm late with watching this video, but my god @3:49 that editing LOL I nearly busted my gut
Beautiful family!
Should have put the bacon on top the mushrooms...
Excellent video. Thank you for it. I once knew a family back in the 1980's whose only meal together was breakfast, so they would set a whole dinner (or breakfast casseroles) up in 2 Crock Pots before bed time, and would have the family meal of dinner (or breakfast casserole) in the morning.
They are small bowls, not ramekins!
Where are the hash browns
I would have put butter on the mushrooms to stop they drying out
An actual decent ad? Jesus I’ve been blessed
Well played lad feed it the kids first to make sure its safe
Just get up 5 minutes earlier to cook your breakfast... lazy
wow..wish swedish kid was that well behaving
Word to the wise, if you attempt something like this again, instead of putting the egg in with the rest of it, put the egg a bit later, also, add grease the outside of the bowl(so a bit of butter or margarine) to prevent it from sticking. My mother also adds the tiniest drop of water when she cooks an egg in the microwave, which helps it from drying out.
I can only imagine the comment gold Gordon Ramsey would have on this breakfast.
A slowly baptised child.
What is better than one slow cooker? Two slow cookers
I don't get the point. You could fry this stuff in about 10 minutes.
Looks like dog food.
“Wanna try an egg?” Looks at egg “No thank you...*
Just lazy idea
Try slow cooking a curry
Your child is very polite.
Try smoking bacon!
why not put a baby monitor overseeing your kitchen so you can leave your electronics overnight? (also make sure to check the voltages lol). if anything should happen, at least you'll get to see it. plus it should make for additional amusing footage!
Man your girl is so cute and polite. Honestly she gave me a huge smile. You both look so a like, very similar eyes. Just after she tried the bacon, you look like a huge kids :) Esp at 8:37, really want to make myself a full English. You are one lucky guy.
Needs hashbrowns.
T H E S I M U L A T I O N I S B R O K E N
Should've slapped butter on those mushrooms Barry!
6:51 us man at our finest as there is a kitchen towel we should of used
I love a good ol' English cooked breakfast.... ?????????? + ? ??????
10:26 first world problems
Nice Argos in Weston super mare ;)
Eggs always go a funny colour if you season with salt and pepper before they are cooked.
Barry, Mate ...you NEED to try an electric pressure cooker! picked one up on sale for £15 changed my life! like a reverse slow cooker ! beef stew in 25 mins!!
I’d have put a bit of butter in with those mushrooms.
That first slowcooker is a definite wedding present.....
Wow. That bacon looks like it's ALL MEAT! I want it!
Ready by tea?... maybe
You need to sort out the way you hold your utensils, very working class
Damn you acknowledge the video games isle.
Dude your head looks massive
Ewww cross contamination, raw meat and beans... yukky yukky
Slow cooking and making breakfast :D two totttally different things . . : D
Try mixing the bacon and shrooms together.
Black pudding man
2:06 And then you can sell your slowcooked baptized children with a side of big oil for dipping to bankers and CEOs all over the world! You know that's what they have for breakfast anyway it just hasn't been streamlined so you'll be like ReptiloiDonalds
Breakfast is for gays
Y
try steaming some sausages it will blow your mind, they dont look cooked but oboy are they ever.
You look like a slimmer, younger Ricky Gervais
Combover game is strong.
Congratulations to the original person who invented this; someone has finally has come up with a way to replicate the British Airways Business class full english breakfast at home.....
5 bowls and 1 pot to clean and cling film to dispose of versus 1 frying pan.
Did you return the Croc pot back within 30 days
Why do all British people love Pugs? Their deformed dogs that have serious health problems, They shouldn't exist
8:15. You're daughter is adorable. The food, not so much.
well you can make awesome apple butter in that, you should learn to can. you could have jars of stuff on hand. im in love with Det. BARNABY i cant get enough, of midsomer murders, you brits have some great shows.
Purchased from the laminated book of dreams, it has to be good
No black pudding? You heathen...
Your first one is the same as the one we've got!
What is the point of using a slow cooker if you are going to separate the items? Millenials never cease to amaze me, no wonder this country is fucked.
I thought the point of a slow cooker was to dump everything into the same space to make stews etc. that's how I've always used mine.
Omg Mr Majeika
British ???? plug.
"there wouldn't be mushroom for other ingredients" Hahahahah - what a fun-gi
If you put a Tiny bit of bacon on top of the mushrooms you Will like That
you can use (certain) plastic bags as compartments, so you can fit more in the slow cooker, you can also bake bread in a slow cooker.
Most important thing to note, a Rice Cooker is superior to a crock pot, while managing the same results. It has the ability to get hotter, so you only wait a maximum of 2 hours for essentially the same experience. Longer(4 hours) only when you want whole meat cuts to get soft and fall-apart-like. The best part, you can set timers on rice cookers, and after the timer runs out they will go down to their "warm' setting, which keeps things just above the temperature you would want to eat them at.
Plastic wrap while cooking? Yuck! Use aluminum (aluminium) foil!
The idea with a crock pot is for you to combine items that would go well together and allow the flavors to mingle. I would have gone straight in with the sausage and the beans, then 6 hours in(or about 45 minutes before you are ready to eat), use the sausages to wall off a clean area where you would add butter and the mushrooms. Lastly push it all to one side leaving only butter and juice from the mushrooms to cook the egg while the rest continues to slow cook. Tomatoes and slow cookers on the other hand... tomatoes get sour/bitter when they are overcooked beyond just heating them up. I would not recommend heating them until the very end. Most likely the best way to go about it would be to push the lot to one side again, and warm the tomatoes up for 5-10 minutes next to the egg. At the end you can scoop the beans first, then the sausage and bacon, then the mushrooms and the eggs, and last the tomatoes. Esentailly going from one side to the other in layers, which are subdivided by the less messy ingredients.
That egg ??
I tought you where making a fresh full english in the slowcooker
this is my mums recipe..you done most of it right..but not all of it ??
You should of put the egg the last 15 minutes and add little bit water in the egg bowl at the end of a fully hot crock pot LOL!
Looks like crapDonald's egg
Before you hate.. This popped up as a recommendation. What a brain dead low I.Q. Load of drivel. LOL!
Why are mushrooms so popular in a breakfast fry up ??????
I had a slow cooker great but unfortunately I broke mine even thou the pot it could stand heat up to 300 an be used in the oven but it exploded on the hob even thou the hob was on 3 so beware that can happen oh an the lid melted in the oven aswell ????????
awww your daughter is such a cutie
...You have the pepper in the white shaker and salt in the black one. You are doing this just to mess with us, right?
I do a slow-cooked pulled pork in mine. Shoulder or leg, shoulder is nicer. First I rub in spices then leave it in the fridge for AT LEAST 24 hours. Then you brown it off in a very hot pan and stick it in the slow cooker with some stock and a chopped onion. Now leave it for again, at least 24 hours. It will fall off the bone (if there is one). shred it with a couple of forks and serve in a crusty bun with slaw and a home made BBQ sauce.
I wouldn't worry too much about leaving a slow cooker on, as long as it's not 120v plugged directly into a 240v outlet. For 120v appliances use a 240v to 120v step down transformer, not an adaptor, the adaptors are for things that have a built in switching power supply and will overload things like heating elements.
That egg looks like something Ashens would eat...
Idea what food can you cook in an/a coffee maker? Hashtag: SinglePot
Like your fridge ??
Why do British people like beans for breakfast
Why does a chef/cook have such a small slow-cooker? My mum's newer slow cooker (rather than her 70s(?) one) doesn't seem to cook very slowly - so I worry about when/if I get my own.
Where's the hash brown and black pudding? ??
Conclusion: If you heat food, it cooks.
The disappointment in your voice when you said you were going to have breakfast at 5pm made me quite sad
Doesn´t want to leave the slow cooker on at night while at home ... leaves the house to walk the dog ...
Slow cooking breakfast beats the point of a breakfast
Should have put a bit of butter with the mushrooms
7hrs? There goes your electric bills ????
U should put some cup of water in it so it won't be dried..
No light? Too bad a letdown..
7hrs for breakfast?? Just might just cook it ????
"English plug socket" Well. You brought it in an English Shop. In England. Of course It'd be an English socket..
I often get adverts for toothpaste and mouthwash before your videos, which may be representative of what I might have to use a lot more of than normal after eating some of these bizarre concoctions. This one, however, actually looks really nice.
You should remake that horrible tinned poundland breakfast that Stuart had on his channel and do a taste comparison.
utterly sobbing at "ah! oh-ha hee ha.... BEANS."
Personally I think that you cooked it totally the wrong way. Who would put containers into a slow cooker? Well you would of course. Personally I would have put everything together into the main bowl and allowed it to cook. The tomato juice would have made everything moist anyway. Yet this is making me want to try this now, I might break out my slow cooker. Give it a go for my tea and have an all day breakfast, rather than just a breakfast.
Out of all the ways to cook bacon, a crock pot would be the last thing i'd want to use.
What size slow cooker did you get? In liters.
If you had set the slow cooker on 2 it would have cut the cooking time in half to 3.5-4 hours instead of 7
2.42 - you missed one, you should have said "There would not have BEAN mushroom"
Slow cookers are best for stews / casseroles / curries etc especially with tough meat. They can be awesome for that because everything is more or less chucked in at the same time, minimizing effort and the duration tenderizes the meat. There isn't much point doing anything else in them. The comparison to a hotel is apt because using a slow cooker this way is comparable to crappy hotel buffet breakfast.
Beans touching egg ?????
So happy about the Mr. Majieka reference. Adored those books as a kid.
Would probably be better if you put the baconstrips flat between two sheets of aluminium foil at the bottom, and then put the other stuff on top of that.
2:41 That is exactly what my chef from Preston said. what is wrong with you both!!!
Ooh, that egg though...:-(
Hmm....slow cooked.....pasta?
That is the absolute weirdest way to use a Crock Pot I've ever seen, but further proof that no matter what you put in one, it always comes out okay
Hey where’s the cute little cartoon at the start???? I love that please keep using it!
Here in the US we do not have anything like an Argos.
I don't want to tell you how to do a Full English, but I would have put the mushrooms in with the bacon maybe?
Seems like a waste of time it takes 30 minutes in a frying pan.
Aw your daughter is precious
You should do a baked potato recipe for a slow cooker!
Can't believe you bought a second slow cooker when you could have got a 6l instant pot instead and use the slow cooker function on that + so much more.
nice
Barry you NEED to coop with ashens again!!!!
Thanks for the clip. Was gonna do it but after watching don’t think I’ll bother. Also, bravo, the missus is a 10. You’re punching massively above your weight. Cheers lad.
8:19 " I dont like mushrooms, I like bacon, sasuage, and beans." me af!
Duuuuuuuude, I'd have imagined you could at least shave in those 7 hours...
I hope you finish that, didn't your mother ever teach you not to waste food
Love the mushroom pun
If you're going may anything in a CrockPot/Slow Cooker, try making your own BBQ Pulled Pork :)
you bought a family-sized slow-cooker so you could make breakfast for one.
Please can you do some recipes using a limited kitchen? (like some students have to), like 2 hobs and a microwave oven?? :)
Wheres the guy that you used to fo videos with . Are you guys still friends ?
Crock Pots/ Slow Cookers are meant to be left while you go to work, or sleep. They are actually really safe to leave on unattended. During the winter I do chili, soups, roasts, and a few other things in the crock pot. I put it all in in the morning (I organize and have everything together the night before so it's fast and easy in the am), set it to Med or High and go about my day. My grandmother, mother, sister, aunts, me, and ect all have used crock pots/slow cookers without any issue, and my uncle who's is a retired fire chief even uses one at least once a week.
Sausage wrapped in bacon...that is the hot dog you will get in Los Angeles if you buy one from a vendor off the street. AKA Danger Dog, Dirt Dog, Street Dog. Hot dog wrapped in bacon with grilled onions and peppers, and because it's Los Angeles, probably grilled jalapeno peppers as well. Topped with ketchup and mayonnaise from a squirt bottle. Possibly some pico de gallo as well. Wait. Now I'm starving.
I just love all of your videos, you are hilarious and very entertaining to watch! I have been subscribed to your channel for 3 years now, and I have to say that there isn't 1 video that I haven't laughed at! Keep them comin, "their amazin" as you always say lol!!! ????
a air fryer would do alot better
Are you killemftw's father?
I think this would all be perfect if you put the egg in a greased ramekin in the fridge the night before and then just plopped it in the slow cooker when you came down to have a shower in the morning. With all that heat in the slow cooker it would ‘poach’ by the time you were dressed and ready to eat. It’s not much different to when you make kefte meatballs and drop raw eggs into the sauce to cook at the end.
An egg in a slow cooker for seven hours? You're practically making a science experiment at that point.
You shouldn't have done the cling film on the ramicans especially the egg
Used to do slow cooker frittata for breakfast years ago. Would time it to turn on about 4am and it would be ready by 7am. Eggs, cheese, cooked potato, cooked bacon, capsicum, onion, etc...really good for frittata's...pretty sure for a full breakfast though id rather just leave the eggs and do microwave eggs lol. I have a microwave poacher, and easy to do microwave scrambled eggs as well.
HOT NOODLE TRUCK!
Just do what Ashens does, get a breakfast in a can. XD
You put butter on the mushrooms
I wish you and Jonathan SacconeJoly were friends and did a Dad video together!!
That's exactly what I want for my breakfast: It being done slowly.
Kids go to school.kids come back what you making.I'm just waiting for my breakfast to be done.
Try lasagne in it you'll never do it in the oven again
Omg he's mixed the beans with the tomato juice. I can't cope with that. Never the two should meet. Divide them with sausages or scrambled egg or something
I've never heard anyone do a Bee-Gee"s impersonation whilst dishing up baked bean's before! Also, if you had put the bacon on top of the mushrooms they would of fried in the bacon juices.
Was that during storm alli
Where do i get those salt and pepper shakers?!?
You should do a Sunday Roast in the Crock Pot with veg! It's one of the many ways we use ours.
what are the words/lyrics to your rap? You rap in the beginning of your first videos- hard for me to unstand certain words.
I was going to comment on your last video asking for some slow cooker stuff but thought that would be a bit boring haha. Evidently not ???? top work.
I tried this a couple of years ago overnight on low and OH MY GOD, it was disgusting lol. Bacon leathery, sausages sweaty, beans burnt at the bottom and the egg was the worst of all ?? Never again will I try this, but fair play. You've got to get it out of your system.
please make a giant macaron, that would be cool!
fried elvis
I would have put a slice of bacon in two ramekins and put the mushrooms inside both to get bacony mushrooms.
Flutty Japan pancake
I love a slow cooked roast dinner but it's better to cook the meat a few hours before adding the veggies. We also use ours for chilli or soups. Never thought about using it for a breakfast!
No, thank you. ????
set the tomatoes on top of the sausage... after you're done slapping yourself.
I like the haircut, sorry its been a while since I've checked into the channel ??
mmmm that's so noiiiceee
As someone who prefers chewy bacon, that bacon leather does actually sound pretty good. Like something between bacon and jerky. I think crock pot would probably be a good way to cook a whole load of sausages all at once for like, a big group. You might have to move them around every so often so each one gets a chance to brown against the sides, though.
Mmm, pigs in a blanket!
Hey Baz. Well done with the breaky. I did the exact thing (except the egg plus i add butter and minced garlic on the mushrooms) in my 5.5 litre slow cooker at 4:30am after a poker night with the boys...... DRUNK. The result is kinda like the same as yours, the leather bacon, the juicy tomatoes, ect, but it's good if you're hungover. Don't worry about leaving your slow cooker on unattended coz it's designed this way as much as this grilled cheese toaster is designed for arson. Cheers from Australia dude
You missed one there Barry.. Moist-rooms. MOIST-ROOMS. Get it?! ??
next week on barshens, barry, stuart and eli eat motorcycle leather.
I really like how at the end of the last few videos you play your original theme song you used to start your videos with bring you back to your roots Barry
"it's nice......but leathery" story of my life....
Come over and live in the Netherlands, we’re only having samdwiches and tea/coffee/milk for breakfast and using the slowcooker for dinners! Plenty of time to do your bacon in a skillet ????
Maybe the mushrooms would go well with a bit of a butter sauce? To keep them moist and tasty
I died at "No, thank you" part. XD
Those things are great for making pulled pork!
There's plenty of moisture in the slow cooker with the food cooking that you didn't need the plastic wrap. And why did you keep trying to pick up the hot dishes? Lol!
Breakfast for dinner is a long standing tradition in my family! Easy to do after a long day at work!
This is a great series Barry, well done.
looks like you basically hard boiled the egg .. the Yoke will turn greenish on the outside where it is in contact with the Whites will also become dry and crumbly ..
Hi I like your new crockpot hope you make some more slow cooker recipes
Bacon that sausage...
Hair looks much better ??????
Can you try the delimano pancake maker please? I keep seeing adverts on the TV and it looks like it could be quite good, not expensive either
Your daughter is very polite " no thank you ". Lol.
That grilled cheese sandwich episode was EPIC. Maybe my favorite. ?? ?? ????
You can slow cook infants in there
I'm amazed the cling film didn't just melt itself to your food after 7 hours. The egg... you basically made an overcooked hardboiled egg. That's why it was rubbery with a green yolk. Next time you try it, I suggest scrambling the egg, as you'll never get a proper fried egg in a slow cooker. NEVER will that yolk come out runny after 7 hours.
"I could baptize children in this thing!" -Barry, MVK 2018 Best gadget quote ever!
Maybe let the bacon cook half way, dump off the grease, and add the egg to it so it comes out as a bacon wrapped egg and it won;t be in the crock pot so long. you can cook all kinds of things in the crockpot. My faves are lasagna and meatloaf.
As someone who can't stand her food juices to touch, this video started out as a grand journey, but ended in a terrible wreck.
Wooooo homebase as someone who works there I love this video already!!
You should’ve put the bread in the crock pot
Great experiment, the egg is better scrambled.
This is a good way to ruin a slow-cooker. With so little surface area touching the food, the pot is likely to break from thermal shock.
I love the idea of putting a slow cooker on in the morning and coming home to a cooked dinner, but ive heard stories of fires do to them so i'd be anxious all day; its not worth it >.<
Air fryer English Breakfast, just put it on and get ready while it all cooks. Like a microwave, but healthier because it doesn't need 10 kilos of salt to keep it fresh.
Going for the barshens style outro I see. Very nice! And cool video as always
Chloe at the end omg ??????????
If you do a fair amount of crock pot cooking/slow cooker I would HIGHLY suggest the liners for them. It saves soooo much cleanup. It's a really good investment and even if you use it a few times a year, I still believe just saving time with clean up is worth the price.
Crock pot playlist pls sir Barry
I'd exchange grits for the beans.
I make lasagna in mine it tastes beautiful .
Mmm I love me some bacon leather. ??
You should try making a roast or pulled pork in it... its AMAZING!! Just dont forget to add liquids to help it from drying out.. like bbq sauce, beer, wine, sauce powder packets with water... they also make great soups..
Will you try the instant pot?
Letting ya kids try the breakfast before... just to make sure it doesn’t kill ya ??????
This recipe doesn't seem terribly wise. Slow cookers don't heat up quickly, so those sausages are going to be sat, mildly heated for quite some time....

Sadly Croc-pots have ruined slow cookers. Slow cookers used to heat from the bottom, but now seemingly all of them are copies of the Croc-pots design and heat from the sides. It's like they've not heard about convection. .....and if you have them half full of stew, it burns at the edges.
Breakfast for dinner, we have that a few times a year.
cling film in a slow cooker sounds...
I have a big and small slow cooker. Great for keeping food warm too
You should try doing the been with a bit of Lee & perins, some BBQ sauce and finely chopped onions. I only ever have BBQ beans!! ??
Mr. Barry's looking pretty sharp. ??
this was in the paper
I just love your videos
Isn't the pepper supposed tp go in the black one and salt in white one?
The sausages remind me of the best hotdogs in London. Every evening, after about 18:00 or so, on the corner of Herbrand St and Bernards St, across the street from Russel Square station there is a guy selling them out of a cart. If you're in the area, I recommend trying one.
jeez... do it all in a frying pan in 10 minutes max. needs to be a fryup.
Would love a series on this. Have always thought about getting a slow cooker but never thought I'd use it much. Recipe ideas would be great
I dunno its seems kind of wrong to make an English breakfast in a Crockpot..lol you need hamhock and green beans ????????
Your best videos are the ones with your family in...love them! Nice doo too Barry!??
you can cook a small chicken or turkey breast in that crock pot. it's also great for making mulled ciders at a party
I gotta ask why in a English breakfast they always add tomatoes
Why tho
Barry "I hope you are well". Can you try a Crock-Pot (slow cooker) Swiss Steak recipe? My Great Gran use to make it.
Are you gonna do slow cooked ribs?
Why would anyone do this?
Yes but he’s a fun guy lol
How to ruin any meal Put it in a crock pot
This worked out pretty well, but yeah, that was one way overcooked egg lol. I like to put an egg on some things I microwave. A little tip to doing that, I would puncture the yolk if I were you. ??????
This looks awful. Awful. Also, slow cookers are for people who forgot they have an oven, right?
I LOVE Crock Pots. I have 6 of them. Different sizes. Great for large family dinners not just for cooking but keeping food warm. Since my husband and I both work and only have an hour for lunch (we live close to work), I put food in at 7:30 or 8 am and lunch is ready at noon. Some food needs high and some (reheating) needs low or warm. I bake meatloaf in 1 person servings and freeze. Then when we want some, I put in 2 and put it on low. 4 hours later, lunch. Also great for baked potatoes (white or sweet) and mashed potatoes. Pork chops with cream of mushroom soup (no added liquid - high for 4 hrs.) is totally awesome. Spaghetti sauce can replace cream of mushroom soup. The list is unlimited! Not just for soups and stews!
I really like the music in the background now as opposed to silence
It just seems like a big to do just for breakfast for one.
Omg ur daughter is so polite ??
Goodness me Barry, the Mr Majeika reference unlocked a room of memories in my mind! Amazing! Loving your vids, keep going!
A rectangular slow cooker, like the 18 quart Nesco roaster oven might be better suited for something like this. It'd give more space for the bacon to lay flat on the bottom.
If I was buying a large slow cooker I'd get an electric pressure cooker, many of which have a slow cooker function. The new electric pressure cookers are great, you can make stews in 25 mins rather than hours, they can cook rice and lentils perfectl, make youghurt and loads of other things (sometimes they're referred to as multi-cookers). The "Crock Pot" is an excellent brand of pressure cooker, but it is a bit of a one trick pony and only a little cheaper than a multicooker/pressure cooker.
Instead of the clingfilm why not use the bacon to protect the egg, tomato and beans :D
This was such fun to watch, what with the slight vlog vibe and all <3
Seems like more effort than just using a pan and a pot! :P
I would traditional put the egg into the pan. I like the juicy yolk.
I have never seen anyone use a crock pot that way.
Where’s homer gone?
What about the black pudding Barry?
Hahah. Did you say 'Breakfast Velvet'? You should patent that name. Hahahah. I'm your first customer!
This has to be the most English thing I have ever seen. You need an intervention.
why would anyone cook a full english this way? it takes 20mins at most to cook it the traditional way and you get much better results.
Your daughter is so pretty how old is she
I like my slow cooker (not Crockpot brand), but I’ve found it’s best for things that are supposed to be mushy like soups and stews. Otherwise the texture is not so good.
My daughter was in absolute fits of laughter when you were saying ow ow ow with the hot beans!?? Also I have used a slow cooker for Apple crumble before and you can also do many desserts where you just sling the ingredients in a little stir and bam!! I saw this and glad you tried it out before me lol
The toaster really left a scar...
Phil Vickery made an upside down cake this morning on this morning in a slow cooker, can you try that?
Definitely trying this one on my day off. I just bought a crock pot last week! I love Chloe’s polite/skeptical “No thanks...” lol :)
I slow cook beans all the time, just dump the can in the slow cooker, add some butter/seasoning and leave it for a couple hours and they're lush
I found an awesome breakfast recipe which was a breakfast casserole. Onion, mushrooms, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, baked beans and eggs all layered, flavoured with chilli and paprika and cooked in the oven. I've cooked it a few times. Delicious. I bet it would work in a slow cooker but I'd be worried about things sticking to the bottom.
I loved your daughters reaction to the egg, I don’t blame her!
I know what you mean about the wind, I was playing rugby at school when it was that windy
Can someone explain to me the appeal of beans on toast?
Hair looking on point ??
May I make a suggestion about the egg? Put some cold water into the ramekin and break your egg into the water, then add the ramekin a little later on, cover with clingfilm before adding to the rest of the things in the slow cooker.
seems like a lot of work and time for a single plate. If it were a family breakfast type thing then maybe, but it really would have been easier just using some frying pans, etc.
Lazyass Tip: buy the disposable liners they sell for slow cookers and there's no clean-up! Also, set it on "HIGH" and it cooks in half the time.
Is it just me going mental because the cling film isn't perfectly smooth?? FFS Barry!!!! :@
I know that's a traditional English breakfast (though where's the blood pudding?!), but doesn't the quantity look like it would feed at least 2 people? I was waiting to see if Barry would eat all of it.
Don't you mean a British plug Barry?
Barry, I hate to tell you this, but that's not a slow cooker - it's an air fryer!!! (Just kidding!) :-)
Your so funny .. i love your energy ????
Salt and pepper not in correct pugs. I'm triggered
Perhaps a little butter with the mushrooms and egg in the ramekins would help
Loving the haircut B, v smart. And a fry up too, excellent video.
Barry, now show the proper way to cook a full English Breakfast. Some of us in the US do not know how to do it properly.
Hey barry! Im loving these new kindof videos you are doing and by the looks of things alot of other people are too judging by the views etc, keep doing these please! Love you:)
Berry can you please do some crackpat recipes ??????
Barry your hair looks ace mate!
That's just way to long for one meal. I guess if I came home from a long day and didn't want to cook I'd be good. Honestly I don't even eat most of that lol but I like the concept
We use our slow cooker several days a week here in Pennsylvania.
I can baptize children in there! ??????
Yes I guess you could baptize a baby in that crock pot but I make soap, hot process soap and use one that size for 10 POUNDS of soap at a time! I love to see you make crazy English foods since I'm an American! Hubby and I laugh at the gadgets and I have bought a few of them too!
Toasty nightmares. ?? ??
Giant tolberone??
Oh my word! I loved the Mr Majeika books!!
Waiiitttttt I've been to that Argos ??
I love my slow cookers. Steel cut oats overnight is awesome, all you have to do is put some extra milk in the morning, depending on the consistency you like. There are so many recipes that are great for the family, you can make a breakfast casserole with hash browns, onions, sausage meat, egg and cheese. Even a pork loin is lovely in the slow cooker. I may try this recipe this weekend.
Ughh!!! Get it on the oven...Looks disgusting.
Loved the wee Stanley Baxter reference haha
thoughts on movining to UK ?
Have you looked into a step down plug? They arent too expensive in the states...
I think i might have added some butter to the mushrooms myself Barry me old mucker!
So this is for people that have a difficult time chewing ????
I cook steak in the crock pot. Any steak, any quantity. I usually add beef or chicken stock. Four hours on high...it tastes like roast. Absolutely delish.
Barry, please can you do a series of cooking meals for one person.
went pretty much as id expect....and cooking an egg for 7-8 hours...nope
We are on the same page here Barry. I love fried mushrooms to,with salt and pepper ????
What does Mrs Barry think about you buying another big kitchen appliance every week? :D
Well hello there ladies and gentlemen scrolling down the comment section!
Do more slow cooker recipes please.
I think it must be much simpler and clearly quicker aswell as tastier too, to create the great British breakfast the normal british way and FRY everything including the bread all washed down with a mug of hot tea or coffee or orange juice. Obviously the OJ wouldn't be hot that wouldn't work at all lol!! But You're right about mushrooms, they're gorgeous fried in butter on buttered toast. This video made me want tomatoes on toast now.
Good on you for not opening the lid...I was always taught...you add an additional 30mins of cook time when you open the lid. I assume its because the temperature decreases rapidly and takes time to raise back up. I appreciate this video, and wouldn't mind more breakfast ones. I love hot breakfast, but just dont have the time in the morning.
For the longest time I could not figure out why I crave full English breakfast until I did my 23andMe I am 74% British which explains to me why I have always been fascinated with Great Britain
Barry try a whole chicken or smth in thw crockpot XDD its gonna be so tender
I own a 7 liter crock pot that is programmable - you might try to find one on sale for your family as it is rather large compared to what you are using - awesome video to use tho :-D
at first i was bummed out about the vlogs going away but the fact you have changed the video style to sort of incorporate them makes me happy keep up the good work
I cook my breakfast on a plate in the oven (but admittedly this crockpot recipe is easier if you have to cook for a few people) Preheat it to 180c. Put sausages on the plate and cook for ten, put the bacon/black pudding in for another 10 mins. Add tomatoes, mushrooms, beans etc (you do have to shuffle things about) for another 10 mins. Depending how well done you like the egg, you can put them in at the 20/10 minute mark. You can also do toast in the oven of butter it to make fried bread, although this is best done separately. So.. you can do a whole breakfast with only one plate to wash (and cutlery).
Couldn't you put a bit of water in the bottom of the pot, to keep your food from drying out? Then you wouldn't need the cling film.
Pre sliced mushrooms WTF
What happened to the cartoon graphic at the start? Loved that! Can you show us how to make crumpets please :)
I don't blame you for not wanting to leave appliances on at night, but as long as you're using plugs that are rated and made for your voltage and country, you should be fine. However, I understand perfectly why you don't want to. I wouldn't either.
Try biting the egg up like your doing scrambled mite turn out better
Thats not an english breakfast, you're missing black pudding :P
I'm only 2:04 into this already and am cracking up so loud that my bf swatted at me to stop cause he's sleeping. The Euro plug! I could not help laughing at that after the disaster that was the grilled cheese death trap.
You should try some slow cooker carnitas. I've noticed you like the Old El Paso style tacos with hard shells, lettuce, tomato etc. That's how I always had them growing up myself. But you can make some proper Mexican carnitas in a slow cooker, if you want to try those.
Prison tip, you can ‘fry’ an egg in a mug in a microwave in seconds.
I saw that on this morning this morning hahha
It bothers me that Barry always buys new appliances for his videos instead of borrowing them from neighbours or buying them second-hand.
I love to experimenting with crockpot. I leave the pot with lowest heat before going to bed and woke up with lovely smell of chickpeas in the morning. I think the tastiest food I ever cook with it were chicken soup. ohh soo tender and moist to the bone and natural sweet. it's different from cook it with pressure cooker.
I don't think Mrs B enjoyed it by the look on her face ????
Now, it's time for portable soup!
More slow cooker recipes please! <3
@2:46 Warning!! Warning!! Dad joke... Ugh... You want to beat your egg into what will become a fluffy omelet in a ramekin. (Yeah, right ... fluffy! ??)
Yay! More crock pot recipes please ~
I have never understood English breakfast. Sorry, but to me that looks disgusting :(
I'm sorry Barry but when I was watching this I couldn't help but thinking, what a crock...
Barry can you please make pigeon pie on your channel and I am sorry for asking again
Is that egg from levi's beard?
3:40 is that the music from how to make sushi? If so ye both should colab
If you want to try more slow cooker recipes get a copy of Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook by Beth Hensperger. I have a copy and really enjoy those recipes.
Not leaving it overnight...The evil slowcooker killed Jack! JK
Your wife and kids are adorable
Crock Pot is just a brand name of slow cooker. I guess just calling all slow cookers a crock pot is an American thing though. My slow cooker is one of my favorite kitchen appliances. I've used it for all manner of meals/dishes, from breakfast to dessert. ??
“What about the toast?!” Couldn’t stop giggling on this part! ??
I really like the new ending of the videos Barry..
InstaPot!,
What, no black pudding? Very interesting experiment, Barry. I would have left off the cling film, but to each his own experimental method. Another enjoyable MVK video.
Well, unlike the US voltage toaster thing this crockpot is set up for UK voltage, so perfectly safe to leave overnight... :P
Yassss Barry! MUSHROOMS ARE THE BEST THING EVER! Craved them in my pregnancies and my mum craved them when she was pregnant with me ?? Love the Hair BTW ??
That recepie must be yoaking your cracking Barry
Your daughter is so polite!
Slow cooker rice pudding is the best.
So much toxic plastic. Cancer in a pot.
Have you thought of using an instapot?
HI BRITISH PERSON!
That mushroom joke deserved a thumbs up for the video!!!! I laughed!
You should do a giveaway for your book! (I really want one ????)
Are "slow" cookers designed for Brexiteers?
Hye Barry !!!
Barry, you do leave electrical stuff unattended or do you plug out your fridge everytime you leave the house ?? I was skeptical at first with my slow cooker but leave it do it's work while I'm out to the office ??
I love ur videos
Am I the only one bothered by cooking with plastic wrap?
Breakfast at 5 pm ... sums up my life basically
Can I give you a chef tip wrap the food in foil first and use foil on top of the bowls wrap the bacon in foil and the sausages you'll have a nice breakfast
I could baptize children in this thing ??????
Now I'm hungry :P
Love this!! My partner and I love a cooked breakfast!! He tagged me in something like this on Facebook ?? I better buy a bigger crock pot! Can barley fit a sausage in mine ??
He made a good breakfast while i had a salad
Nr 8
nice I just made my breakfast now I get to watch you make it yours while I eat mine
Alright Barry
I've done this for ages it works a treat for me...
Do you like it better than the air fryer?
Great video!
I love your videos, every day I get home I check if u have a new vid cuz u are awesome
Hey first comment:-)
I had an heart attack just watching this video
14 eggs for breakfast xD
??, ?????. ????? ???? ??????(
Who tf would eat these for breakfast. This is literally a call for overweight. This is not healthy food especially breakfast. For breakfast you want to eat good healthy food not to only wake up the organs and make them feel good but because it's the first meal of the day. The body needs to start working and putting this food in as a first meal is just bad. Eat healthy good food for breakfast for not only you feel good for the rest of the day but also for you body to feel good.
I wonder what they do with all of the crust they keep cutting off the bread
I just made a french toast casserole, check out the blog for the easy recipe! https://reynashome.co/2018/10/25/french-toast-casserole/
Are you sure you're using enough cheese in those recipes?
These are just ideas people, you are by no means obligated to make any of these recipes lol.
If my Dad finds me eating sweets for breakfast I'm dead meat
2:17 i want to try it!
ugh too many ads
Well I know what I'm doing for 3:00am breakfast
Background music is annoying ,not so healthy breakfast
Like why the heck is ketchup a dipping sauce for everything?
A cor do cheddar da primeira receita é mais forte doq o lápis de cor laranja
Ketchup for breakfast...
Most of these are heart attacks waiting to happen.... 1000 calorie breakfasts wtf
Me gustaría que la pusieran en español también para aquello que no saben hablar inglés

I keep thinking about diabetes after watching this
Is there literally any egg replacement that would work well with all these recipes?
Who the fuck eats things with ketchup for breakfast... These are more like snacks and desserts, not breakfast unless its a holiday or special occassion and you have min 30 min to make breakfast
I hate bacon ?? and it's all with bacon ??
Tiger loaf has the most beautiful stretch marks??god I'm hungry

Everything has so much fat.. Look delicious.. But maybe once a week..
Erm... Do they eat everything with ketchup?, Lol Wtf

Rip to the crust ??

What is it with the ketchup?!? Dipping?!? Lol not everything goes with ketchup
Everytime they dipped the food in ketchup I'd cringe??
This isn't fast at all... And I don't think I have these ingredients and so much time in the morning. Lol
Red velvet pancake was my fav
I need to know the song.
3:37 , 7:32 , 8:59
Why breakfasts on youtube are always fat or extremally sweet?
Genius ?? loved most of them
Most requires baking ?? I don't wanna bake
Your so good at making food ??
My honest opinion about your channel I think you say the recipes a little too fast
I consider this for snack.
eeew...plastic cheese? don't you have real cheese where you live?
Who eats this much for breakfast sometimes I don’t eat till like 2 pm
None of these recipes beat the taste of plain delicious sizzling bacon ????
This is one of my favorite videos so far. OMG! Yes, pllease... yummmy
What you think my muscules I'am Super Strong ??????
I don't like bacon
I am a vegetarian but always like to see non-veg recipes
I don't think it's a good idea to start your day with all this greassy food

why the fuck would you add oil to cook bacon
Todos gostosos ??????
Gross no thanks.. I only found like 3 recipes appetizing.
You should make more healthy foods!
Yay! This video actually has measurements !
You can tell they don't live in America, or they buy farm fresh eggs, because look at the dark color of those yolks! They're beautiful, that's what eggs should look like.
Mm....so yummy????????
y loved them
who the hell is eating so oily.breakfast
Lovely,but I wish you had some thing mad so well for vegetarians

This is diabetes
these like desserts
I love this
2:20??

egg and milk
OMG! I can't ????????
Why do you fucking gremlins have to eat ketchup with nearly everything
It’s bothering me that they put ketchup on everything
11:10 what the heck?! WHAT THE HECK?!!!
OR open a cereal box and pour it in a bowl and add milk ????
Some of these are good but others have too much cheese or are more like desserts to me
Those refried beans looked disgusting
this is the war between twisted and tasty !!!
Must. Put ketchup. On everything.
Is this a second channel of Tasty ??
It’s 1 am and my stomach is growling
These are 'breakfasts' for when you want to get cardiovascular diseases.
Wow! mouth watering recipes. Love everything
Omg the red velvet pancakes looked so good I was going to right down the I recipe then they added vinegar I'm hiley allergic to viniger and all the other I can't eat bc of my braces
iike
Good grief dessert recipes not breakfast. I dont hate my kids this much.
What is the name of the music used in this video
That's not easy at all
Work tomorrow and work e to work tomorrow and tomorrow morning tomorrow and work for tomorrow work and tomorrow tomorrow and ????????????????
Waoooooooooooooo
I love your videos there are so great ??
Never crack eggs straight into something! Its retarded and the white stuff (the COLOR white not egg whites.) is not good for you! Always use a fork and take it out!
You people are gonna have a fucking heart attack sweet jesus the amount of fat
What a rip off, the last one took me two minutes
Nope, I want easy and fast breakfast, sorry I don't eat dessert as breakfast.
I did not like them.. not impressive.. breakfast should be simple and easy to do
You people's is disgusting
11:11 sausage and bacon with caramal sauce and strawberries?????lol!
Last two just made me cringe... But others I'm attempting lol
When that cheese came out that boat.....
UGH! IM HUNGRY??
The French nugget toast is actually called pain Perdue which means lost bread
I hate bacon
Was this sponsored by Heinz or something?
A salty breakfast croissant bake with honey/maple syrup and powdered sugar on top? That's honestly disgusting.
This is absolutely disgusting
Why are all of these so unhealthy. Yeah I’d love to start my day with a meal packed full of bacon and cheese or sugar. This is why America is so fat
Every YouTube channel with food has the same format
Oh my god, it looks all so delicious!!! I'll run to the supermarket as fast as I can to buy all the things I need :-)))
Most of theese are desserts, and many are french toast variations. Also, adding red food coloring doesnt make things red velvet...
They got these ideas from tasty
These are awesome ideas!
Do these turn out the way they are shown?
Is this a bootlegged Tasty?
The new tasty guys!
This cnna channels should get 5Millon subscribers
It always looks so easy but it isn't Q.Q
1,000th like yay ??
What's with the ketchup?
Thank you very much for this great video I hope you translate the words into Arabic to benefit from them and I participated with you channel to reach me all that is new ........Thank you very much
These people must really like ketchup..
I love your recipes. I'm writing down these and make A lot of these
Way to much for a poor countryman. Sorry..
pretty sure half of these should be called desserts instead
Could you do a series on low calorie foods too. Diet food can be tasty too you know... Just needs more thought and care. The kind of lives we lead these days and the stress.... At all ages.. This food though excellent can only be cheat day food ?? looking forward to some equally easy fast and tasty twisted daily foods... May be even more fun make ahead recipes from you.
Why .....why is this channel still at 81k subscribers!!?? ??
Where's the classic breakfast foods? Like Cookies 'n' Creme Horizontal Stripe Cake Or Cookie bottom mousse cake Like if you get that reference
Dead Twisted Chefs, we get it ya'll like to eat. Can you please show normal human sized portions though? An 8-stack of Red Velvet pancakes is the fast track to weighing more than an african elephant circus act where 3 elephants stand on top of eachother. a 2-stack is a more appropriate meal size.
Love the music!
When you do your next ice cream recipe, I heard a song called ice cream twisted the other day..could you play it? It wasn't bad.
Fish
I can't watch or support such waste of food. I am unsubscribing. SHAMEFUL!!
You sure love wasting bread crusts. Idiots.
I love the comment about the gluten and it drawing back. I make tortillas from scratch and keep wondering why sometimes it recoils when I’m trying to roll it out. I believe the solution is to let the dough rest longer, correct?
????????????
Outstanding my man, that chorizo looks amazing.
wish I could meet a handsome man like Bryon who can cook well!! lol
Delicious! I like the mellowness and calm manner of you and this show. Many shows are noisy, voices loud, they have audiences....there’s no need.
Chorizo ??????
You should have dipped it in Taco Bell fire sauce for an authentic flavor
This is just yummy for my weekend movie night :)
You are not a cook you only 1 or 2 year experiment and try to make name with sort Cut
Byron's voice is soooooo soothing... And my stomach is sooooo aching...
I tried this. Good recipe.
Is that your own chorizo or store bought? ??
Love your recipes. If you lower the heat on the cast iron, your tortillas will cook better.
Were you just using a cast iron pan on a ceramic cook top? I thought that could not be done.
I'd let you munch on my quesadilla in the morning, Byron.
Please make Tortillas. I have seen so many but want to watch yours
Looks good. Try cooling down your skillet with a wet towel when it gets too hot or simply start with a medium flame. Your tortilla should not be allowed to smoke at all. Go for a softer brown color on the tortilla bubbles.
The sign off-LMAO. Great video.
When I cook my tortillas they don't bubble and turn out like a poppadom, what am I doing wrong?
bacon fat instead of lard..... Father in Heaven save me from myself...BYRON I LOVE YOU!!!
aloo paratha??
Mmmm.... This is right up my alley given that I'm an Arizona native! Looks delish!
where has this guy been all my life god i'm hungry!!!!
Love these cooking videos. Keep up the Fantastique work. ???????
byron why dont u make something that we can find in the fridge. like, what to do when u only have lettuce and beef in ur fridge. how can we improvise. something like that.
You make everything look so delicious and easy to make. Thanks for all the inspo! ??
American cheddar looks so weird all orange and shit.
Just me or is this way too much effort for a home cooked breakfast. Like for a restaurant it makes sense but at home? Just have an omelet with all the same shit
Its like Indian Parathas
Just subscribed & I'm already in luvvv ?? mostly cause I'm a fat ass but luv the recipes ??
hey byron...my dream is to make a food truck so if u dont mind can i take some of your recipes ...
How he says chorizo. Lol The correct way to say it is cho-dee-so
Any enchilada recipes?
That looks amazing, glad I found your channel, I needed ideas to cook for my family.
????????
i don't like when my girlfriend watches these videos
where can I buy those big slabs of the wooden cutting board thingy?
Could you do a video on making corn tortillas?
eat a dang quesadilla! subscribe to learn more about SPUP
Breakfast Quesadillas f d r Google msMichelle  cook
Lol you don't use tongs when flipping tortillas use your hands! And you burnt them lol ?? ??
As a Mexican i think you did it perfect
so many food police. I'm Mexican and I so enjoyed this video, the beauty of food is that it's universal you can play with it and do your own variations. You don't like the cheese, use whatever you prefer, don't like how he flips the tortillas, flip them as you please. My mom was 100% Mexican and she always substituted things in her recipes and everything was always delicious. Don't knock on things before you've tried them. Never thought of using bacon fat instead or regular Lard I'm excited to try and see what my family thinks! thanks for the delicious recipe as always Byron!
would be nice with some pics of the flour/fat mix before you added water.
Hey Byron ???? you do a lot of recipes with egg would you please do a burger with an egg on it recipe
Can I b your wife
fuck two hours for a dough
1:35 flour bae
That's not a quesadilla homie, that is a mulita.
Do a greek or african recipe, please ??
That's indian chapati!
tbh... dont nobody got time for all this
toen ik een kind was keek ik dit whene i was a kid i wacht dis
At the beginning I was a bit iffy about this video because I saw flour tortillas and not corn tortillas but then you started to make it from scratch and I had to give props to you for going a step further. Love it.
Yup Byron low key Mexican....homemade flour tortillas, you went all out
GRINGA GRINGA GRINGA
what knives do you use? and where can I get good ingredients like you? can you do a video about your knives and where / how you source such beautiful ingredients??
i made this for my family without the bacon i used turkey rashers. it was delicious!!! thank you for the recipe. could i make this woth brown flour too?
The way this man talks about his food. I needa find me a shawty to talk about me like da ????
hey Byron , pls share your red velvet cupcake recipe
You should make a strawberry short cake
I really enjoy watching and trying your recipes!! Can you come up with a dish that includes quinoa? I bet you will kill it!! Cheer!!
please make a kitchen tour video! i would like to see how your whole kitchen looks like :) thanks
Looks sooo good!
good video, good idea. I still prefer bbq pull pork, corn, egg and mixed cheese, in creamy spicy dip.
seems like, it's too hard to make a tortilla! but believe me, in India, it's very common. we used to make it three times a day in a count of 30-40! and it's perfectly round shape! it's called ROTI :)
These look incredible Byron! Love the idea of adding the bacon fat. Soo good!
Hi Byron, love your videos!!! I subscribed right away. Have you ever considered publishing your own cook book with all the recipes. Thanks :)
I don't eat cheese. What can I use to replace the cheese?
wow thats a lot of work for a quesidilla maybe this is how it's done at resturants
Please show us a recipe for mango tea and different drinks to serve since it's getting warmer, especially in the Massachusetts area :)
Looks delicious
Do you have any kids?
In general, nice but... Byron, do you know how BAD pork is for health? It is not even considered edible.
Tasted quesadillas once and decided that I don't it but I think I'm trying it again because of your video
im wet
love these man! I love making these...mine is a little more low key cuz I don't make the tortillas haha. Also, what knife do you use?
Can I give this vid multiple ??????
plz marry me..
Breakfast foods are the best kinds of foods out there. Show me someone who doesn't think this looks delicious and I'll show you a liar. Great recipe!
try them with some monterey jack chesse next time, you wont regret!
beautifully stacked quesa's!
Love your content! Byron! I made a bet with my friend that I could get 500 subscribers within 8 days. If I win I get 100$! Help me out on this one YouTube! Ohh and I own a Food Channel ????
00:28 a little more bang for my butt and to be more recoursefull with my cum????
This looks delicious, the best part is that it looks super easy to make ??????????????????????????????
sir i would love to see you to rate games
Hi i have a new cooking channel and wanted to know if you would like to collaborate on a video?
1:35 'flour bae'
Im 5 minutes into the video, i just found your channel, and im in love.
You are boss with those knife skills! Can we please get a knife skills video? Love your simple yet elegant cooking style! Help a beginner out!
I've never seen chorizo looking like mince :O the end product looks delicious nontheless!
How can i replace the fat to make the dough?????
Looks yummy!
How many tortillas does the dough recipe make? Can you make ahead of time and store the dough or freeze it?
hello Byron! I was looking through all of your videos for pork chops but you don't have any. you should do one for awesome pork chops!
I would eat this but I'm allergic to cheese ;(
Those knife skills though! ??
Byron, you don't know how to roll perfect round shape tortilas. It is not that difficult. It can be done in not more than 10 seconds.
ap ki roti gol nai hay, ap ko rishta nai milay ga.
Your background music is good! It is well-matched with today's food.???? + I really like Quesadillas????
Yum! I want one!:D
Is there anything you can substitute the lard and the bacon fat with? As a veggie, I can't eat them, but I really want to try these:)
It's almost dinner time in Britain, but we'd love these any time of day!
My family is Mexican, my husband is white haha. (He always tells me, how do you manage to have homemade tortilla every single day?) My family got me used to literally having tortillas at least once a day. So I make tortilla dough every night to have for the next day and so on. I also make homemade corn tortillas, way way better than store bought. Anyways I love love your cooking videos! Blessing to you and your little family. ?? (oh and never thought of using a mixer! For the past 10 years I've done my dough all by hand, definitely trying that!)
Why can't I chop my veggies like you?! ????
Can you make more foods that you bring to school or work. You have a lot of recipes that you have to eat right away. :/
Hi Byron! :) How many tortillas did you get from this recipe?
1:35 salt bæ
what is a good substitute for the bacon fat/ lard?
Ooh! I want one! Hmm, you know, I've never thought about making scrambled eggs in a saucepan before...
It's Paratha, with stuffing! Lool.
Wow! This is awesome! :)
why do you add milk to your scrambled eggs? I've tried it with and without and it doesn't make that much of difference
Most of your recipes I would never attempt to make , but I just love watching your videos. They are so aesthetically pleasing and relaxing it honestly doesn't matter what you're cooking I'd still watch it lol. If you ever decide to one a restaurant or even put a dish on someones menu I would so support it! Keep up the great work!
I am a offended, and this made me feel mexican.
I used to enjoy fresh homemade tortilla's when my grandma used to make them. but sadly since she has alzheimer's she hasnt made them in a long time. and she never gave us her recipe for them
The bacon fat is it just leftover fat from cooking bacon in a pan or is it something special about it? xD
Can't wait to try this x
It looks so yummy <3 I want to try using our local longganisa instead of chorizo >\\\<
if you prepare the tortillas a day before. how long do they keep?
Your videos make me hungry ??
Please make a video of Tortilla De Patatas aka Spanish Omelette!!
I make breakfast burritos but I have never made a breakfast quesadilla. I need to!
You are honestly the only cooking Chanel I love to watch. And you make homemade tortillas look easy to make ??
I love how you keep the Mexican recipes, Actually Mexican... ???? Thank You! ?? Will definitely be making these!
Looks like I'm having breakfast for dinner because anything more complicated than toast and eggs for breakfast is too complicated for my morning brain.
this video was great, but the audio was a bit low during the tasting section
cenk uygur denies the armenian genocide
Another great video! Thanks Byron ??
Empanadas? Pleaseeee. ??
Hey Byron! Awesome videos, again! You need a show on food network!! The video quality is so good!
I could pay my rent with what that mixer costs.
Great video!! Looks delicious!! I'm new to your channel but I'd love to see a shepherds pie recipe! :) If you've already done one then just ignore! :p
i love the minimalistic style of cooking
Byron, you should take your wife to a Cafe Rio. Its a Mexican grill. Hope you give it a try!! Promise you will love it!
Loved this!!!! Making it for dinner asap!!! Would love to see a video of you showing / talking about all of your most used kitchen tools listen in your description box
Those look awesome.
4:18 I bet he ate that
chapati .... we have been eating this since. forever
Byron slapped that quesadilla down like it owed him money
Seriously change the cheese to something sharp/acidic and you'll be happier Just always avoid american't cheese - barf
Yum I love chorizo
Can I use vegetable shortening instead pork fat ?
Nice tortilla making skills! ??
I've made all your breakfast dishes LOL
I thought you said mix for 45 minutes and I was like whaaaaaaat lol
I'm confused why you always try the food before you sit down and film your impression of it..!?
Give a good look to the camera at :20 lol. I saw the comment below about glass tops and cast iron, I'm glad they asked I was wondering that. Great video! One Question, how do you make this when your kid(s) are screaming at you that there hungry! lol... Keep up the great work sir! Chris
Try Oaxaca cheese instead! You make everything look soooo delicious!!!! ???? xoxo
Your tortilla making game needs to be upgraded.
This dude is a beast
Looks amazing!
the amount of cilantro in that nearly made me throw up. the soap plant
As a Mexican living in Mexico, I approve this quesadillas, but I think it would be better with a more mexican cheese, like Oaxaca cheese
bro
These looks sooooo good
????????????????????
You deserve way more subscribers, love your videos!
How do you scramble your eggs? Do you whip it the whole time with a whisk or switch halfway through? If you switch, with what? Thank you! Big fan!
If anyone is planning on or made this recipe please tell me how it turned out
Could I substitute the bacon fat with coconut oil or shortening ? I can't eat anything containing pork/pork derivatives ??
This looks so good! Can't wait to make it!
Yum
you make it look so easy!....how?!?
The dislikes are from people who doesn't love food and good work with it ??
Love it! Now I'm hungry, can I get one? haha ??
Are you telling me that tortillas are just basically roti but with a different type of flour and less oil?
My tortillas became crispy hard after cooking??what did I do wrong:0
i make omlets and scrambled eggs and quesadillas all the time... butto make a breatkeft one.. i never thought about that haha
Dislike for stupid idiot
1:18 what is mixter
"... to get rid of the bacon bits.' Dude no.
ready for breakfast? until i cook these its already late in the night :D good video!
Can you make a video on how to care for cast iron pans
Its like chapati with fillings
These look amazing!!
YUMMMMY
I didn't think you could use cast iron on glass counter tops :o
You sound funny saying tortilla xD and it was a lot of times, Maybe I sound the same saying something in english :P Good recipe!
this is literally my stress reliever. i love watching you make art with food. you really capture it all and give a nice picture. ??
The eggs need to be cooked with the chorizo. After it kinda melts add the eggs and then cook it like you would scrambled eggs.
screw it I'm making this for dinner tonight
Why do u always look mad when cooking? haha
man I love ur cooking I been doing some of ur recipe and I going to food Network to compete for chopped I will be doing some of ur recipe
Don't forget the usual rice and beans that accompanies this crap.
Hey Byron, any chance you could do a shakshuka recipe?
saludos 7u7
I'm Mexican so I get to enjoy homemade tortillas pretty often xD Thanks for the recipe! It looks really good ??
haz tlayudas =3
Looks friggin delish Byron! Definitely going to try this tomorrow for breakfast!
So gay :O
looks so yummy!!
I hope the tortillas came out delicious! My mom has tried doing them in our mixer..they don't taste the same compared to making them by hand. She also uses hot water! She goes in with her hands too, idk how she stands the hot heat haha I will definitely try this! :)
I am incapable of seeing one of your videos and not clicking on it
what can be substitute for lard and bacon or any butter will work please
Looks tasty! ??
nunca había visto que alguien batiera la masa para tortillas con máquina, ni que las voltearan con palillos ??
Did the "raw" taste of the pepper and onion cook off with the heat of the cheese melting? or did you still get some of that flavor?
I need to mix it for 45 minutes?!? 0:53
anything with bacon is awesome
Dude that's a gringa
I can never find chorizo where I live :(
My favorite breakfast place does choizo tacos and they're so good.
Wow, you never fail to impress Byron! You've really inspired me to work hard and improve my cooking. Hopefully, I can be as good as you one day
Hey Byron! Who makes those nice Saute Pans?
Hey Bryon! Are there any alternatives to bacon fat/lard for this recipe? Thanks! :)
what can we use instead of pork fat?
How much time does everything take on the whole? Love the recipe though <3
yumm! love your vids :)
Could you please share some recipes that don't contain onions, peppers, or mushrooms?... I really don't like those. Thank you ??
never been so excited to watch a video.
4 people just don't understand.
file corruptions are the antithesis of chorizo
Marry Meee ! I love watching all of your videos ! keep it up
Marry me ! I love your channel
fantastic! ezpeazea
why have I never thought to do this?! I do burritos all the time, but never even thought to do a quesadilla
Y wouldn't I leave the bacon bits in the bacon fat tortillas with bacon sounds fkn delicious
Perfect quesadillas!! loved them!
I've been waiting for this video ????
wow looks good OMG
The Quesadillas looks really good.I use a little bit olive oil in the pan. I think that`s what I should make for lunch todayyyyy~~~~With avocado, Hehehe...

I tried the waffle recipe and the waffles tasted horrible.
Ur recipes are amazing but I don't get all ingredients??
sigh
I love your recipes
Wow! Thank you! All recipes are amazing ??
I tried the Apple rolls Not that good
I think it's American style breakfast, in Europe and Asia you can't have such huge, calorie full things in the morning....that's why Americans are HUGE!!!! You have to decide whether you want to live longer or die sooner eating things like this!!! Full of sugar...poor body!
Damn this looks good... I'm gonna go eat my spaghetti now
hi there its so nice cooking and useful tips thank you so much.
pollen 'p?l?n/ noun a fine powdery substance, typically yellow, consisting of microscopic grains discharged from the male part of a flower or from a male cone. Each grain contains a male gamete that can fertilize the female ovule, to which pollen is transported by the wind, insects, or other animals.
Excellent do For lunch and dinner also please............
What was your favorite recipe?
that's not what a shakshuka looks like... everything else looks super delicious though
Excellent recipes
It could be just be, but anything involving an oven is too hard to consider for breakfast lol
You should make more healthy foods!
How do you make the sauce in the first one
Shakshuka is an Egyptian dish but we mix eggs with tomatos
The apple French roll ups are amazing
?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ????? ?????? ???
Nthng is easy as indian breafast idly,Dosa enough for a lifetime
Congratulations on an excellent video!!! Wow, absolutely delicious stuff! I can't wait to try these breakfasts! Thank you so much!

Is not... Easy at all
All i seen was 10 easy breakfast recipes.I clicked so dam fast.Im hungry too, and its mng time.
I always love your channel because it helps me to learn many recipes easily.
Music reminds me of Gran Turismo ??
Could you list or tell the back ground music during the video.
Having a meal with garlic in the morning doesn't sound so appealing to me - The aftertaste and bad breath... Ew.
With out egg you can't do any breakfast
Amazing recipes, but the video is damn quick. I cannot catch all the ingredients. I have to download the video and watch it again in slow motion ??
Can we just have breakfast for lunch and dinner too?
who thought of that shitty music to accompany such lovely grub!!
Its nice watching your channel I like the videos you sending me and your background music is perfect
Nice Food
You are amazing thank you ??????
Hallo. Very interesting those crisp pancakes... but could I leave out the apples? It could be better, for my own taste. Thanks if you'll answer.
Great video!!!
I love it!!! I love your channel!
music is adorable!
Beautiful video! Would whole wheat flour work for the waffles?
If you were my sister, i would ask you to make me breakfast everyday ..??????
2 ?????-???????????? ???????
Thank you for so many wonderful recipes
Imagine a brunch with all these recipes! Amazing!!!
??
Tutto buonissimo sicuramente, ma quanti grassi e roba fritta.

I can eat 6 uv those waffles, 3 uv those sandwhiches, 6 uv those apple pancakes, 10 cheese potato pancakes??????
Why you do them to gather you make me confused But you are great thanks
I really wish I had time in the morning to do those :D
All I can say is WOW!!!
This was a wonderful video. I'm going to try the red sauce and egg dish and the blueberry ricotta pancakes.
?????? cest super !!!
Chakchouka is a north African dish, it's better when you don't use onions and use more garlic, and add some hot sauce to give it the right amount of spice (it's not really meant to be served as a break fast)
The music reminds me of Tasty
I thought there will be muffins as well. Btw I loved all of them.
Breakfast orgy! Yummy, loved it!
????? ???.. ?????
That was just so good. Really nicely made video... and food!
absolument fabuleux,fantastique dommage qu'il n'ai pas de traduction en français en tout les cas .....respect madame ????

Subscribe to my Chanel
Great video! Can I come over for brunch this weekend? ;)
Tt veramente squisito!?? complimenti sei bravissima! Grazieeeee ??????
so nice????
wow?? verry good
First
A MONTH!!!!!!
Dont forget to freeze your food for 3 months kids!
freeze up to 3 months ..?
I was so confused about the spinach smoothie because at first, they didn't add the spinach
I frickin love this idea
It look so good
"And heeeeeeeres the frozen fruuuuuuit..."
I love this maybe the cook ?? ?? ?? or not
When I first saw the egg with vegetables I was like Me : OH!! That was my mother's recipe
Pineapple wth milk but pineapple and milk combination can lead us to death
I read that as Meal Prep for the Weak, because I am... XP
My fridge doesn't have that many eggs
1:07 c'mon tasty we all know that's Rubbermaid
All of these people that gave this video a thumbs down, clearly must have maids!!!!! Tfs ??????
Food for people that don't like real food.
This music is very relaxing
A month wtf yep this is gonna be ready for the week
Can anyone please tell me the name of these plastic bags used to preserve the fruits?
Why did I misunderstood "Week" for "Weak"
PLEASE don't mix eggs and broccoli unless you wanna have explosive diarrhea!
I don't even eat eggs... but why do y'all horrifically overcook them like this??
Can u just eat it right there and then
Looks like repeatition
I am going to do everything! But I will take broccoli to any recipe, I HATE broccoli
Ahh yes can't forget to label the bags of fruit that suspiciously look like the label we have given them. Can't forget a strawberry for anything else now can we?
Wtf! 3 months! I can cook a lot of food on those 3 months!
That repetitive music was incredibly annoying. Also, enough with the greek yogurt.
Amazing you should do a lunch one this was awesome right up my ally
Reach ten mil alreadyyy
This could take me a week just to make Monday LOL
before they put the veggies in I was like ooh that would be really good then once they put it in, I was like hell no
Oddly Satisfying Me!
Asians don’t eat food prepared for day to consume it another day.i prefer fresh cook & eat ur video says it can last up to month ??
Meal prep for the WEAK..
Mario bros music, anyone else recognize that? No? Just me? Okay.
Still abnormally normal. Usual tasty.
Anyone try these recipes?
The muffin confused me. Why broil it and not toast it? Why put it in a damp paper towel BEFORE freezing?
I cant understand people who want every morning something different for breakfast.
You can’t be serious? Store up for months... um no.. ????
Why would you freeze food inside a damp paper towel?? The towel is going to become a block of solid ice
Tasty indeed.
The pancakes look so unappealing. But like food prep vids.
Ok so I’ve done the breakfast sandwich thing but the eggs get so dry after heating them in the microwave. Anyone have a tip for this???
wow!!!!!!!!!!!
How to defrost these pancakes?
Plzzzz plzzzz make more videos on meal prep.... Plzzzz????
Working at tbell.. I cringed at how those burritos were folded ??
Can u guys pls make something that kids can make that doesn't require difficult things or way too much food
im lactose and tolerance-
Watching this put the taste of microwaved egg in my mouth :B the rest seems good though
341
It's 3:30 am I have a play tmr And im watching this. F M L
Who watches these videos just to see the food how tempting it looks and not the recipe???? If do so then hit the like button plzz ??????
I'd watch these so much more if there was a voice over, you can't look away for a second or you miss something so half the time I don't click
The music on replay got really irritating
T~T
What's the purpose of using damp towel in microwave?
Yummy
Get dat damp paper towel
This music makes me want to stab my ears with a wisk
It seems delicious but personally I think it is not eco friendly as this will create a lot of rubbish.
Quality content
No measurements though
I can't wait a month:'( I don't have patience
Plz sub to me cuz I need to try to get to 50 subs plzzzz
I want to make all of these ??
Strawberries aren't berries...
great video!! thank you
4:30 does everybody cook eggs with water or is it just not me?
You made a mistake at 6:02, it says F twice, but we know what it's meat to say:)
I really need a much larger freezer...
My super pregnant ass wants granola bars now
I wonder why they used turkey bacon ????????????
hey, am just gonna freeze these fruits for 3 months.
hey, am just gonna freeze this sandwich for a month.
This is soooooo good and the music makes me feel optimistic ! Definitely gonna try this on my diet ^_^
So glad they labelled the bag strawberry banana
some are definitely not for the healthy people here lol
kiwi, banana... SPINACH??!
I heard Ron Swanson killed himself after watching this.
They're fxxking frozen! -Gordon Ramsay
You will be late to work every single day. Or just do this on the holidays
B you got me fucked up if you think anyone is going to use 12 eggs in one recipe
As a busy person, this is really helpful!! Meal prep prevent you for skipping meal. I've been looking for meal prep recipe this week, and tasty never disappoint me ????????????
I like the mixed berry smoothie best.
Good job tasty! These are kinda healthy!
how about you teach us how to waste less when cooking :D give us some cool ideas
Good video! You should put the macros and calories too?
Can someone tell me what the first one was
Hope u hit 10 mil
GODDAMN SO GOOD BUT MY MOMS OVEN DOES NOT WORK
It's not Tasty !! It's stacked funky smelling food ??????????????
Who puts barely a sprinkle of cheese in a burrito!?
Instead of promoting regular fresh cooking.....'stack your food in freezer' for a week in advance !! ????????Yay???????? !! So that if you decide to eat something else...????????..noooo !! There is already food stacked in my freezer !!! Fuckerssss ??????
Looks so yummy ??????
Very nice ????????
Thank god for the labels on the fruit. Really had me confused thinking it was chicken ... lmao so extra.
I can't afford this.. ????
raw oats? it causes inflammation !!
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much for this! Super helpful! I like meal prepping but its hard tl fond time to make things for breakfast so I usually skip it sadly! Everything here looks so great. I'm definitely going to try some of these! Many thanks!
Leaving out the measurements and making us go to another site? Unsubscribe...
I need more healthy meal prep!!!
Turkey
All this meal prep shit is big freezer privilege tbh
I wonder how many times I’ve watched Tasty videos that has frittata in it.
Many flewaer ...... And awesome test....... Thanks tasty
Nah, id rather eat fresh food. This is unhealthy.
Is it necessary to freeze for a moth or is it optional?
Ok, now im in LOVE with you ??
As of right now I am still a child by some day I’d like to becomes a parent and adapt some of these ideas To how my family would eat.
Wh- Three months?!
I ain't gonna freeze mf eggs
That first egg sandwich is Kanye shaped
Amazing video. Love it. This video was superb.
The first one would be eggsellent if I was not allergic to eggs.
they put four shreds of cheese on that breakfast burrito
I am I the only person who cannot do a “bird” and egg in the same meal? Like I think there’s something wrong with eating a chicken omelette.
why are they writing names on see through bags?
Maybe a smoothie recipe for people who just happen to be allergic to bananas?
Over night oats is the most disgusting white people shit ever
Literally CANNOT stop binging these videos! Love it! xx
The way they wrapped the burrito hurt me a bit...
Chocolate Milk?
This is a fun and slightly more interesting way to get a week's worth of meal prep done! Admittedly I just go out and buy a box of cereal, but to each their own right?
What is the brown paper?
How did the granola bars get that thick when there clearly weren’t enough oats to cover the bottom of the pan? ??
That’s some shit they feed u at overnight summer camp
I wish I had my own fridge ??
Meanwhile poor student can't afford fresh ingredients
Tasty ?? aye
Gooddam some of these look good but my lazy ass wouldn’t even think of ever trying it
Damn meal prepping looks interesting, but I’d never do it.
For the first one...., what about the Measurements??
What the hell 4:49 Who can't roll a burrito??????
Cooking right know!
https://youtu.be/vZaZ-oouwhw
I really love to eat Tasty Reuploads for everyday! Yum!
Don't make the spinach milk smoothie unless you don't mind farting non stop for a year.
I didn't finish the video before I got up to go make the breakfast sandwiches and the prep ahead kiwi banana smoothies. Hahaha.
That would not last me long tho those small things??
Is only a reposted video...
Very cool ideas here.
I wish I can have breakfast food all three meals ??
Can you make a video of cooking before school?
those are the saddest pancakes i've ever seen
I thought the smoothie said freeze for 3 months at first
alternative to doing any of this: just make some grilled cheese
I get the Digorno Crispy Pan Pizza ad every video. btw I'm a very small YouTuber
The breakfast videos are my favorite!
Very confused as to why they’re using almond milk but then also using Greek yogurt which has dairy...like either use no dairy completely or cow’s milk throughout ???????
Can the almond butter be replaced with peanut butter in the last one, or would that taste bad?
While some of these seemed great and I might try them out, one thing I haven't ever really understood is what is with sweet breakfast? I mean the most I've tried is porridge with berries and even then it was too sweet for me. I really prefer savory.
Am I the only one who gets Asda "It starts with a ..." adverts?
That's a big ass egg piece
To: people who are saying they are repeating everything/overusing clips. Buzzfeed/Tasty has to make schedules for both, both use the same people, and new recipes can be hard to think of, and if you are doing collabs with big people it can take a while to do. (Sorry if my English is not well) From: JJ.
Am I the only one who gets Asda "It starts with a ..." adverts?
This music is honestly the most wholesome and uplifting thing ever.
Me wishing there was a such thing as a second breakfast ??
I hate spinach smoothies they actually tend to cut my tongue and apparently it was a defense mechanism that they made thousands of years ago so that they wouldn’t get eaten by herbivores or something.??
Im so confused cuz i've never got an ad on yt before.
BITTTCCHHH serve looookkks hunnnty????????
Okay but how so I make the damp paper towel
I'm 13,248th!
Anyone else getting these “Terror High” ads?
yum
Puts "Strawberries and Bananas" on a clear bag when we can easily see it
No It happens to me stupidmicro trans spay
Good ideas... I love this channel!
do you even know how expensive almond butter is...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJi3kp2JA-k
Perfect breakfast !!??
I do cold overnight oatmeal ???? super easy and keeps ya regular tbh
And I just had a piece of chocolate cake this morning .. (Can’t cook for myself yet since I’m young/there was nothing in the fridge and my parents are never home soo)
Did anyone get that music.ly/TikTok add??
The fruit is not frozen when she takes it out of the freezer
Wait? This is a tasty video?! I though I was loading into sims.
Yummy!
A lot of great ideas here! I'd change a few things like using real bacon instead of turkey bacon. The sheet pan pancakes didn't look so great, but I can just skip that one. :) This could make breakfast time a little easier in the morning with kids!
All those breakfast meals look delicious
IM EARLY
This is ellie -->?? Ellie does not have a name or age Name her And the amount of likes is her age
Am i the only one who watch this in bed trying to sleep

OH YESSSS!
Time to eat
Amazing video, horrible burrito wrapping skills lol
I like meal prep do more
Meh!
Before 5,000 views! Never thought it'd be this early!
broccoli and eggs?
Are you sure about freezing cooked eggs and meat because I don't want to get food poisoning !!
No I do to
or meal prep for the month...
I would do the first one without brocolli, anybody has an idea for a substitute? Can I use a pressed garlic instead of the powder?
I like the longer-ish videos ??
Is anybody keep getting musically ads on every tasty video
Binge watching tasty videos ????
1:39 was confused for half a second, only to realize the horror that I would soon witness.
2:16 I actually want to try this so bad (even if it has spinach)
Good video
Want to hear a joke ? Read more
why do we have to wait a month to eat it?
??????????!
Nice idea
Yammy
3 MONTHS??? NO ONE IS WAITING 3 MONTHS TO PREP BREAKFAST FOR A WEEK
Broccoli is a trap.
