I've always been a big fan of Webers,>>>t.co/Al2rAFl5tP   and this one is no different. With a one-gallon can of charcoal it held almost 500° for almost two hours, and stayed well above 350° for at least that long afterward. VERY nice, and we love the color.
Anyone know what make of BBQ this is?
Was going good till the last tip.. oh and Carbon is not a carcinogen. We are carbon based life forms,we should be dead without grilling..
I soaked my timber in whiskey overnight ...... not a good idea. Nearly lost my eyebrows in the process of lighting it up.

Grilling. Steaks is. Interesting.
Charring CREATES carbon a CARCINOGEN. Holidaykitchen June 25 2009.
this is moronic.
4:21 That looks pretty charred to me.
Hahahaha vedgies on the grill? what a joke
Wire brushes are very dangerous to use.
@4:53 . Always cut steak against the grain and on a bias
Sorry, all of your meat is burned! My chikens will be very happy!
Carryover heat! Carryover!
Searing doesn't "seal" in juices... That is a myth.
Don't use a wire brush unless you want to send yourself or loved ones to the hospital for emergency surgery... ugh.
So mush wrong. "Searing holds in the juices" Also you should use a temp probe to get grill temp not your hand! And NEVER soak chips! And resting of meat has been de-bunked too.
So many myths in this video.
Makes my mouth water
First rule of grilling. Never use gas or charcoal, always use natural chunk.
Holy shit I tried this today, with Korean beef, chicken kabobs, salmon fillet and of course Veggies!! After we were done, my family needed a forklift to move my body from the patio to the house
tmas
Can someone tell me the average cooking time of raw chickens into a "SMOKELESS" grill?
Should say "tips for newbs". also, cowboys did not cook on stainless steel gas grills. Even for newbs, if they think they'll be grilling fairly regularly, a digital probe-style thermometer is a much better choice than an instant read. By the time you think you should check the meat, it could be overdone, and there's no going back. Get a thermo with multiple probes so you can track different meats, or meat and bbq temp.
IF THE FOOD LOOKS GOOD, EAT IT!
This video refers to the element Carbon, as a carcinogen. That is insane. Carbon is a fundamental building block of life. It is not a carcinogen. That is Jenny McCarthy levels of crazy. "My friend Paul breathes oxygen. Paul got cancer. Therefore, oxygen is a carcinogen." <-- wrong
I've found my own method. I sear both sides of the chicken leg on the grill for a few minutes then I place my chicken on the top rack where the backer burner is essentially allowing the heat to finish them off. it takes around 35-40 minutes but I've found for me and my family that my chicken always turns out amazingly. very juicy and tender. try it. gotta keep the lid closed. checking them every 10 minutes flipping them if need be.
searing doesnt seal in juices
0:13: you can't have more burnt than that!
I see so many things wrong in this video. Black meat causes cancer, and NEVER EVER grill your meat above open flames. Wait until your coals are red glowing but covered with white ash.
Can anyone answer me this? Do you cover the grill when your meat is almost done or during the beginning of grilling?
@4.17 - 'Charring creates carbon, a carcinogen.' What a load of crap. There is nothing carcinogenic about carbon. Get your facts straight before you spread your drivel across YouTube.
Wonderful video, liked, thanks for sharing, happy day to you!
140 for medium rare....not hardly. 125 to 130 tops.
Holy shit I tried this today, with Korean beef, chicken kabobs, salmon fillet and of course Veggies!! After we were done, my family needed a forklift to move my body from the patio to the house.
such a great tips!
GRILLED! NOT FRIED, GRILLED
Good tips, good refresher. I'm going to share this on my blog this weekend now that winter is over and the weather is more conducive to starting outside and grilling. http://notobsessedwithfood.blogspot.com

Great video for beginners. ...but saying carbon is a carcinogen (4:15)?
I think everyone should know how to grill correctly. Who doesn't enjoy a mouth watering slab of grilled meat?
anyone know any good channels for cooking, shows a wide variety of different foods, and very good tips? Thanks!
Carbon is not a carcinogen, as stated in tip number 2. High temperature cooking of meats, such as grilling, will produce chemicals such as heterocyclic amines, benzopyrenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Wikipedia). These are the carcinogens to avoid, but the meat need not be charred black to produce them. So save grilling for special occasions (like weekends!), and eat your fruits and veggies. We will all die sometime, but for some of us, you're not really living if you don't grill once on awhile!
Great tips and resources.
Good basic tips...but you gotta be a little slow if you didnt already know most of this.
not to be a stickler, but this isn't bbq, it's grilling, bbq is smoking.
I smell fish taco...
cook for less time genius
I love bbq mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :)))
I'll bring the beer..
It's grill, not girl.
dont poke holes in the steak and dont over cook it
rule # 1 = Don't use a gas grill. Also, let steaks sit for an hour or two which negates rule 9 here for steaks only. - Me, born and raised in Texas.
every time i girl my stake it's drys up,even when it's marinated with sauce, any tips!
dont let the fire hit the meat, since the fire is burning from that stuff u put on the brickets (dont know the word in english), wont be very healthy ^^
I had a nice slab of steak for dinner tonight. Yummm... It was so good that I'm actually thinking about it now 4 hours later. :p
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm now i wanna eat a steak
Damn straight.
tip #1 use charcoal
i sat and ate a massive bag of bacon tasties while watching this...
# 3 - Up to a point, the more frequently you flip the meat, the juicier it will be. Flipping the meat, whether beef, poultry, or fish, every 30 - 60 seconds over high heat will give you the best results. Heat drives juices in the opposite direction so that they come up out of the top side of the meat. If you see a steak's juices pooling on the top of the steak, you've gone too long without flipping the meat and have lost a lot of its juices.
# 7 - If you use mesquite charcoal instead of briquettes, don't wait half an hour before putting the meat on. Mesquite charcoal burns hotter and faster than briquettes, so put the meat on ten to fifteen minutes after the charcoal catches fire, whether it's covered with ash or not. # 4 - Soaking wood chips in water just makes your food taste like wet wood. Place the chips, or better yet wood chunks, up against the coals on the outer edges where they'll smolder instead of burn.
write on youtube poulet mankal and u will see the video of the best chiken
