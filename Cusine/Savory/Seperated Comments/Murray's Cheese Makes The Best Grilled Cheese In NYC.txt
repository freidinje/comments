That fat girls fake American accent was just so wannabe American. Jeez be original.
Impractical jokers owns this store
“easy to mess up” I get dollar tree cheese and bread and it’s bomb to me
Your giving away murray’s secret
I imagine Jasmin or Jake sneezed while walking around their caves. Right after they leave, a team in full hazmat and flamethrowers go in to decon the infected.
Lol
The narration is horrible and the self-video taking is too shaky.
its a shame because this is interesting but your voice ruins it
So they use real cheese. Thanks?
Stoned reporter
different narration pls
She has an annoying voice- not working.
The girl is ugly
Im pretty sure thats not how you wash your hands lol aren’t you supposed to scrub in between your fingers and wrist?
Pomade
can this chick talk any lazier
My last name is Gabbard to wow thought I would never see another far from where I live
"Now Murrary's is literally a cheese kingdom." Go back to school
Get a gimble to stable your camera
Fire everyone
Fire the voice over chick fuckin annoying
my cat just died today and I am crying right now?????????
I’m allergic to penicillin :’/
This video is to cheesy
“They also get washed with water regularly, to keep them drying out and cracking” WHY CANT PEOPLE SPEAK?? Keep them FROM drying out and cracking, this girl probably has a degree in journalism and communication, yet she is incompetent at even the most basic writing.
The way she says cheese is so cringe
Jake looks like the whitest to ever live
In the Netherlands we call it a “tosti”
Im expecting to get some information about the cheese sandwhich, but instead they talking about jesus?!
I’m not going to pay $9 for a grilled cheese
Buzzfeed video and presentation quality is so much better than this. Did you guys record this on a cellphone ?
Boring indian host
The amount of cancer this guy sells. Dairy is cancer stop eating that shit
This is Bob: ('v') Thats All You Need To Know.
Penecylin isnt actually safe for all people. Like me, I can't have that or I could possibly die
I literally know 15 year olds who can produce a better "video" than this within a day. Hire goddamn video/audio people, they're everywhere and hungry. This is sad.
I just feel that grilled cheese is something u make at home so why pay for at a store
Woooow I wish to smell all kind of those cheese
Gosh her voice is soo annoying
This is like saying your chick has the best puss* ,but if your bragging I guess I'll try it ??????
Most annoying voice ever
i wanna know who messes up grilled cheese
that's Cheesy
I want one now
I've watched so much of Mark Wiens I missed the face when you ate
Jasmin's shallow and uninspired commentary was in painful contrast to the exciting content and excellent production quality. WTF insider?
Who else licked their lips at 2:50
They could NOT have picked a more emotionless voiceover
it's literally NOT a cheese kingdom.
But of them suck.
Do cheese expired.....
WTF eatable things written by colour pen ??
This narrator sucks
Despite the very refined choice of cheeses, one can notice that the same level of care was not applied when choosing what type bread would make the best grilled cheese. Of course, "wonderbread"-like come as the natural choice, but in fact it's too dense to adequately form a crunchy crust while melting the cheese within. And that leads to the 2nd mistake, that's to press the sandwich while grilling it. By doing it, one presses out the air bubbles within the slice of bread, effectively losing the light texture the bread has, which plays a big part in discerning the flavors. The ideal grilled cheese would comprise a crunchy crust, thin but fluffy slice of white bread and slightly melted cheese (melted enough that is becomes creamy, but not too stringy). In order to achieve this, I would suggest using bread light as possible, one's favorite cheese mix (mine is gouda and requeijão), and, most importantly, grilling each side at a time with plenty of butter over LOW heat. By doing this, I assure your grilled cheese will get all 3 textures maximized to its best.
Wow the narrator gave me a fuckin headache. Someone get her fired
This ass grill cheese is better with potato bread
Cancer on a plate
But is it Gordon Ramsay good?
0:18 murrays grilled chesse is the best in nyc looks up best grilled cheese in nyc Murrays Grilled Cheese dosent show up
You need a good cameraman, at least. Srssly..
Good topic terrible performance from the narreators
Get another narrator
how did i went from perpetual energy to grilled cheese..
It always seems like Americans invent things which are like super normal here in Europe. "The cheese is aged for a year in a room which mimics a cave"!!! We have been doing this for hundreds of years in Europe????
these peeps crave the content more than the cheese
The narrator needs to get fired ASAP
Wtf is this..a high school video? Next.
Jasime you are so cute, I want you
Narrated for kids
Why is the NY Chedder orange? That can't be natural? Never seen orange cheese before....
She REALLY ANNOYS me.
Why did I assume it was Bill Murray?
They chose the most untalented and generic people to narrate this episode.
Mustard sauce in your grill cheese is so good. I like using tasty cheese with brie add mustard and tomato chutney. Yum
Narrator sounds like she's doing her job while on the toilet
Ancient cheesemakers also used to urinate on the cheese, it acted as a preservative and a flavor enhancer...
Wow. A 6minute video about a guy ( an executive chef LOL ) taking the philosophical side about putting some cheese between two slices of breed. “ it’s the butter amount, also the bread, and the cheese too”. Get a grip dude, please.
Narrator’s voice sounds like a voice over before the sex scene
Biggest mistake by having that Indian host
Consider using a stabiliser
I just ate a grilled cheese an hour ago and then I saw this on my Recommended YouTube page. I think I'm being watched! (I'm taking off my shorts)
Anyone else find the insider girl (the blonde) kind of irritating?? Idk why lol.
Jesus its cheese
I don't mean to be rude but the voice over sounds like a pornstar
My first thought when I heard the name Murray was about impractical jokers. don't know why XD
title: Murray's cheese payed us the most
dudeeee change the video's speed to 1.25 it sounds better and normal now
it's as if im hearing her read the script. please dont get mad, we're telling u this so u can improve :)
Please look at the lense, not the screen on the camera
these guys have to be the most boring and annoying people that could’ve done this
Can't I make this at home? Minus the hype..
gets hungry
Long Island? Percy Jackson fans, let's pack our bags abd go there
Cheesus ??
When I eat cheese I poop a lot
Why is America so obsessed with grilled cheese? Like. I love it, but.. It’s fried bread and cheese, it’s really not that special.
How do you mess up grilled cheese?
“Cave master”
What’s with everyone making fun of the narrators voice Some people have different voices plz stop judging the narrator’s voice
“My wife She make a cheese from her tit” -Borat
I've been there. It's fine.
wow he makes a sandwich in a sandwich maker ! legends hahahaha dude i buttered my sandwichs since i was a boy. comon that is clearly an easy home made lazy sandwich NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL.
Disliked because of the narrator
I mean superrrrrrr cruuuunchy
Garbage
the best grilled cheese is the one you make after waking up with a hangover
This video is intolerable because of the voice over
Producer Jasmins attitude is soo annoying
no my mom does
want eat!!<3
Now I want some grilled cheese at almost 11 pm. Dank it.
4:50 beefcake made me thirsty
I want to own this cheese factory xD
the narrator sound like she's sleepy
imagine the smell.
Chopsticks for my lips? 2:50
May I have a decillion slices please? Each with extra cheese thank you.
I just realized this is the same narrator in the video"Putting a steak in a log of butter"
I crave cheese
Only cheese I like is mozzarella
1:20 holy shakey cam
Yeah, whoever narrated this is slow and has no emotion besides boredom.
God she's cringy...
Holy mother of god's grandfather i need to have grilled cheese right now wtf that looks so good wtf
Is it just me or did i hear her say "jesus is used to be aged"
That's so boring though. Just bread and cheese.
What a terribly produced video... the whole experience was awkward, the narration was cringy and the lines were rehearsed. They literally offered nothing of substantial commentary. “I’m picky about my cheese, I like it to be creamy, I like to be able to... taste things.” No shit?
Narration was trash, sounded like she was reading a children’s book to a class of 2nd graders.
My mom makes insane grilled cheese...
5:24 “I’m picky about my cheese...I want it to taste things” ???????
Good topic, but absolutely terrible quality. Go watch a BA video or something. This is so subpar.
gets bread gets cheese cuts cheese puts cheese on the bread grills kicks throws eggs makes a mess throws cola How to basic.
The narrator speaks with "Valley Girl" accents, completely took the enthusiasm out of this video.
Wonder what it smells in that cheese cave
But where is my tomato soup ? ????
Ahh shit a video about a food place. I bet that 2 loaf and a few slices of melted cheese = 6.99.
Why does she sound like one of my voices on my gps.
Does the narrator have down syndrome?
They picked two of the most annoying two people to do this
the person narrating sounds as if they recorded with an earphone microphone.
Horrible narrator
Yes because searching "best grilled cheese in ny" on google definitely tells me its the "best"
Watching it at 1.5x because I can't
Stop looking at the screen and look at the camera lens
This is cheese heaven.
Yummylicious.
I'd rather rob a cheese cave than a bank honestly.
Gouda cheese nr1
When did it become okay to film on your Iphone. I won't ever take anyone seriously doing that
this is truly one of the worst videos i’ve seen in a while
I f8kn h8 moldy cheese. They taste gross. Brie cheese i can tolerate
I’m glad this video isn’t 3 minutes of the Asian girl cheese pulling and making funny faces.
Cheezers from regular show makes the best actually
why are these videos always so damn awkward and uncomfortable
I hate cheese but this looks sooooo good! XD
Why is the production and narration high school project level?
The narrator sounds like shes talking with her teeth clenched together.
So much hate for the narrator, I really liked it!
At 1:47 you incorrectly said that the cheese culture is covered with mold cultures like penicillin. That is incorrect. The mold you are speaking of is actually called Penicillium, that produces secondary metabolites like Penicillin. #fakefactsinsidershame
Who’s man is this narrator.
On bleecher street? How STRANGE. They must have a cheese DOCTOR.
Those cheese cave must be smelly ????
To the narrator, you need more practice
My friend steven makes the best cheese this video is fake
They secretly put crack in the cheese
they're so boring.
All the food insiders reporters are sooo FAT!!!
please use another narrator next time please
chopstick for lips? What does that suppose to mean...
She has to try to not talk so slow
the girl narrating sounds like a dumbass, and the script is bad. "they get washed with water regularly to keep them drying out"
Who made the song in the latter half of the video?
Grilled cheese chef?????
Cave master
The voice overs remind me of my middle school/high school video projects lol
The thing I like most about it is that it does not come off as pretentious, it does not use a gimmick or putting something different just for the sake of it. Because most fancy shops in cosmo cities do that and it just comes off as low attention grabbing tactics. But I don't know the price of it so I could be wrong.
cheese washing must be a great conversation starter. Where do you work? Oh I work in a cheese cave and I wash their cheese ‘-‘
Sub me.
This person’s voice is horrible. You need get someone else
I'm hungry now
Nice
Timestamp: 0:29 to 0:32 Annotation: You got that right
why do I always end up here at 2am lmao IM HUNGRY AF
Cheesus, it's like 20 pounds on a bread
I see heart attack
Schwiizer do?????
I want to show other dairy places the Murrays only cheese because it's not fair on them if only Murray has it.
voice is so annoying oml
The narrator sounds lazy
Got me fucked up if you think imma pay for a grilled cheese when I can cook it at home ?? if you can’t make one I’m sorry but you can’t go wrong.
I am talking about SUPER CRUNCHY
The place where no vegan goes
Stop abusing “literally” this store IS NOT LITERALLY A CHEESE KINGDOM. morons
Joey Tribbiabi would be proud
I'm lactose intolerant...
1:45 serendipity? Army?
Jasmin seems to be a non-native.
Do they make profits??
"Oh hey, what do you work as ?" "Oh im a CAVE MASTER "
I’m glad that there are no rats in the cheese storage
I love the part where they talked about cheese.
I'm hungry now.
’cave master’
What an annoying voice ??
yaaaaaaas girl
Mayonnaise is great ad well if you don't have butter ??
Insider is like Buzzfeed but lile 100 times better
Jake looks like a fat pete davidson
Just like curing flower in a jar :) dark, cold... Flavor.
I want this so bad
The whole video could have been explained in 30 seconds
Looks like paid advertisement with a low budget to me
prob costs like $20 after taxes
I can only eat my grrrred cheese with a thin layer of miracle whip or mayo or even spicy brown mustard on the inside, otherwise it’s just melted cheese on bread and dry af.
Lmao the narrator can stop. She is so annoying
C A L O R I E S
The music got me in some kinda feelin
Your hot jasmin do more food videos plz.
Watch at 1.25 speed :P
Get a professional narrator. This sounds like a high school project, it's embarrassing compared to Eater, Zagat and BuzzFeed.
0:27 I'm sorry but thats a lie, I've fucked up royally before and that sandwich still tasted amazing
Ace hotel NYC grill cheese!!
My panini press makes a better Grilled Cheese
I can't find a menu with prices but I feel like they would sell a grilled cheese for like $20...if so, nope
The narrator has no emotion in her voice and facial expression. It's really hard to watch....
"Best"?? that's BS
Super C R O N C H Y ????
Of course it's in NYC
It’s not grilled cheese without tomato soup, it’s just toast and cheese without it.
"What makes their grilled cheese the best?" Simple product and Marketing
What idiot messes up grilled cheese. If you can't make this or eggs than you don't belong in a kitchen
Okay....I'll have to go make my own now ....
I need a grilled cheese in my life.
1:53 this mold saved lives someone give that mold a nobel prize
Grilled cheese is idiot proof , seriously just use good cheese and not shit cheese duh !!! Not even going to watch this, useless !!!!
Yummy
One of those grilled cheese sandwiches is probably 1000 calories hahaha
LOL, his title is 'Cave Master', hahahah. I am laughing so hard. Badass.
Is it just me, or does the narrator seem dumb af? Like she has no clue what she’s talking about but
Holy cheese Son of a biscuit who didn't tell me about this!
lol @ Americans going to a restaurant to eat cheese toast
Americans find out what real cheese is ??????

INSIDER, can you do a video on Ice Cream Rolls?

The narrator bores me
OMG It looks so tasty Well, i was talking about my lunch ????

Who else is hungry like me?
Her voice is the most sickening voice they could’ve used
its looks good and professional
I feel hungry.
Cheesy!!!!!!!
When it says A google search my google assistant pop up
The artificial cave is a joke!! XD the air itself in the cave can drastically change the taste. This guy is just ageing cheese in a fridge.... And calling it a cave. If you want real cave mature cheddar look up, Cheddar Gorge UK you can order online. Damn... I like cheese
Narrator's voice sounds like a lazy college student. ??
I like my grilled cheese buttery and cheese
You call this a Tosti. Mwa seen better. NEDERLANDSE TOSTIE FANS VERZAMELENNNN

Osm cheese and nice
1:20 do they really have to be that obvious on reading the script next to the camera :/
Why does that look so gooooood!
I want one now please *rubs screen *
I don't mean to be offensive, but the voice-overs were super underwhelming and drab.
Dear friend, being a servant of hospitality is pleasing to Jesus Christ. Jesus ministry on Earth was a ministry of humble service. There is nothing pretentious about Jesus. He didn't expect special treatment. He did not chase after Fame. In fact on more than one occasion, Jesus told others to remain quiet about what they had seen Him do or hear Him say. What we learn from Jesus by His example is the importance of putting the needs of others ahead of our own. In the book of Philippians 2 : 3-4 it states, "In humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interest but each of you to the interest of others." Our life is not about the pursuit of comfort and recognition. On the contrary, in pursuing God's purposes, our life is second. This is one characteristic about Jesus that we can and should imitate. We are never more like Jesus than when we are serving others. The greatest act of love and humility occurred when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ freely suffered and gave His life for all of mankind. That through His death, burial and resurrection, all whom believe in Him may be saved from their sins. Begin your life of selfless humility by receiving the very One whom exhibits the true essence of humility. The Creator of the universe, the Alpha and the Omega, the Great I Am...Jesus Christ. Please find strength and comfort in praying the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, in our desire to be more hospitable, create in us a heart that aims to serve others in your name. May we discover that true greatness is not in fame or position but in Humble service. This we pray in Your mighty name, Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior. Amen! ??????
Vegan grilledCheese
Oh please. I make better ones.
Good idea. The script needs a little work. The rest will come with time and practice
It sucks being lactose intolerant...??????
John Deacon would be proud. Like if you get my reference. I probably won’t get many likes ?????
Any small or big Youtubers want to support each other?????
My heaven
Why am I attracted to Jasmin
"we took a trip to these caves to learn more on how they do it" ( ?° ?? ?°)
I saw the cheese
A google search proves they hold the title for the best cheese sandwich... what???
Why is everything in NYC?
The narrator (Jasmin?) sounds like she had to wake up super early on the day of the recording while recovering from hungover.
I HATE MELTED CHEESE. IM SORRY, BUT I DO,
Well it was a bad idea to watch this at 2:00 in the morning...
Why is it always New York or California that have these places? You never see someone out here in maryland doing shit like this.
2:29 - 2:40 a portrait of mutual hatred ??
Please wash your hands properly
my grandma makes the best grilled cheese in her house
Cool vid but PLEASE stop using the word "literally" inappropriately.
There’s no way it’s better then my mommas
The narrator sounds like a momo. Who hires these schmucks?!
Ok but why buy a grilled cheese when you can make it at home? Also a grilles cheese is not easy to mess up. That's a bunch of bs lol
It's probably like $10 for one grilled cheese, outrageous.
What’s so hard about making a grilled cheese?
Covered in penicillin. Not the icky kind of mold that's bad for you, so it's safe....LIES!!! I'm allergic to penicillin!! She's trying to kill me =-=
Now I’m hungry for grilled cheese
2:46 does she mean to keep them FROM drying out and cracking?
Can you guys please do a video on Studio C. They are a HILARIOUS comedy group ?????? Seriously... you need to do a video on them
When she said it’s totally safe it sounds so sarcastic
The employee in the cave is so over it.
Too bad I’m allergic to penicillin....
Lies Our mom's make the best grilled cheese sandwiches
"It's so simple, yet so easy to mess up. So how do they do it?" I assume the rest is how they make terrible grilled cheese sandwiches. And that's not how to pronounce Gouda. They should know better. (It's pronounced like how'da)
Ew
Voice over is so bad
Whenever I make grilled cheese, it BURNS
"NYC this NYC That" Tbh they need a new topic to talk about
It's 4am and I'm hungry..
This looks delicious
I can make a grilled cheese sandwich for free instead of having someone make it for me and paying for it
Any other lactose in tolerant people out there :’’) yep *suffers

Introducing the new Grilled Cheese diet. Eat 3 grilled cheese sandwiches a day (and nothing else) and lose 10lbs a month!
When auto translate mentions “Jesus” instead of “Cheeses”
Fast for 4 days in a row lose weight, then take one bite of the grilled cheese sandwich here and gained it all back! That's how you balance out the universe.

A spa for cheese. No wonder it's the best.
For some reason I can only have a cheese toastie with ham
Hey INSIDER, the video content is good, but both hosts suck cheese, no pun intended.
I hate that girl's fake accent

Cheese ain’t even THAT good tbh

All i can Say is its better than the $250 one Lol ????????

My mom did it better
I'm so early ayyyyyyye
This Indian chick isn’t right to present ,
I'm going to have two for lunch. Though I do not have Gourmet Cheeses or expensive bread, my Grilled Cheese is crunch on the top because i put shredded Parmigiano Regiano on the side that covers that sandwich.
What if they sneezed in there? lol
I would never pay for someone to make me a grilled cheese
I like how the don't add anything super special so it doesn't overpower the chese.
I'm sorry, but the narrators voice really annoys me like c'mon talk faster, geesus.

"That Be 25 Dollars"
well, i have the best grilled cheese my apartment has to offer.
I don’t like cheese ???? I don’t know why I’m watching it
Usually I click on these videos and think it’s ridiculous how pretentious these NYC restaurants are, but this actually looks incredible. So far, the best grilled cheese I’ve ever had was one I made myself, after my friends and I hosted a fancy dinner party and made a glorious cheese fondue. We saved what was left over and I decided to make a grilled cheese with it. It was the most delicious, creamy, melty grilled cheese ever.
Look Gromit! Cheese!
You post this at 6AM sure Insider I’ll just drop everything and go get a damn grilled cheese ??

2:02 "cave master" what a fun job title. I'd love to introduce myself like that
