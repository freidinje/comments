I think of adding some chicken or eggs would be perfect ??
how i love this grandpa ????
I wish I had this rice right now with sum salmon
Grandpa IS NOT cooking or stirring here SORRY TO SAY. He is just adding ingredients into the pot which are probably measured out and given to him by someone else. Check the stirring and wrist technique of the person who IS actually doing the cooking and also has an orangish red lakhri (string) on his wrist compared to grandpas NON stirring wrist technique.. . Grandpa nor his grandson are wearing lakhris here .That cast iron spatula cannot be used by grandpa too heavy for him he would of burned the rice at bottom of the pan. Just saying otherwise nice rice who ever cooked them
Huge lover from Indonesia grandpa is the best ????????
Man... All tgis granpa videos make me hungry.

Stop encouraging handouts. This is not acceptable. Have those kids help you out with cooking or around your farm. Let them know hard work gets you to where you need to go. No wonder your country is so backwards.
May god bless his soul ??I love watching him cook for those children??????..team grandpa

Not authentic with too many bottled sauces and rice cooked on the day. Too much rice in.proportion to veg.
Grandpa,you are just precious! The meals you prepare look delicious and you put so much time,effort and love in them.Watching you taking the time to share your blessings and feed the less fortunate gives me faith in humanity. The world needs more people like you! May God continue blessing you! All my love from Sherman,Texas USA
i wish grandpa would sing again
Love your kindness and cooking skills Grandpa! LOVE watching your videos! God Bless..

SAUCE
Melhor canal do youtube! O que melhor usa seus fins lucrativos ??
those kids are lovely. God bless grandpa and his family
I don't understand how young palates can tolerate such (to me) ferociously spicy food - the usual appreciative smiles seemed noticeably absent this time. That said, I have taken much inspiration from Grandpa to try new food and ask more questions at the local Indian food outlet. Purpose served.
??? ????? ??????
Job
Good
red chilis, green chili sauce, red chili sauce and Szechwan sauce. Don’t you think it’s too much spicy for these kids?
Siapa Dari INDONESIA !!!
piles mubarak
I really appreciate and respect what this grandpa is doing but the only problem is that you put a lot of spicy and chili ingredients into your food which is bad for the children's health that you are feeding.
I like it when he says ‘oil’ as ‘I’ll’
E Ardida tamvêm kkkkk
Ai que comida bunita devi estar muito gostisa kkkkkk
Yuum yummy ??????
Give the Grandfather a Sharp Knife and Glasses. I ASK YOU TO
Amazing
You did it again Grandpa. Looks delicious! You and your crew do a super job.
it uses too much bitter sauce and spices, how is it being renewed.
Can't describe how much I'm loving this grandpa and all the efforts he made for the orphans ?? Love from Belgium ??
Rice KO wosh Nahi Karna padta
