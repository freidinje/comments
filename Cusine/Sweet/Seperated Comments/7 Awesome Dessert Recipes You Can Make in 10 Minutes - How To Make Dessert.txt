These are all really gross too
Well I think its safe to say the title of this video is a lie
Wow so tasty desserts. One who Like these desserts hit the like button below my comment
Asosome and very easy thank you for sharing this video ??????????????
These recipes are from the yotube channel the scran line
If they show us all that common process which we all do and known the video will be I think more than 30 minutes
wow
Super ??????
Çok güzel??????
??????:+?????? Yeah...Only 10 minutes.....
In the first one you need to bake brownie for 30 minutes tho! So incredibly stupid!
Hmm, I think perhaps you don’t know how time works. On the very first recipe, you have to bake something and then freeze it. Unless you’re using liquid nitrogen or magic, things that size don’t go from burning hot to frozen in 10 minutes.
Super mind blowing so much??????????????????
Nice ?? but it is so difficult ????

Can you do this slow please
Ten minutes? Sez who? There's a lot of know-how, not to mention special equipment, on display here. It's entertaining, but not realistic for a lot of us (or healthy for any of us). File under fantasy.
I hate sounds background
Desserts you can make in 10 minutes. For the first dessert: bake for 30 mins

Can you buy "Inedible Cookie Dough" in the US? I wonder sometimes about the people who do these titles.
