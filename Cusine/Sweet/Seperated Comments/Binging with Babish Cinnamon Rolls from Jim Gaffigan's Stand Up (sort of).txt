I little to creamy I’m going add heavy cream
BwB is P2W
This is what I love about Babish, he shows you his mistakes. Im a chef, want to know how I learned the most? lol of course its from informative senior chefs, but next to that, it was fucking things up until they got better and better. I can now make fancy dishes while im drunk and not make any mistakes. Hard work, determination. Cooking isn't easy it takes time to learn all the little things that help you learn to breathe in between dishes.
Make fried chicken from ‘The Help’
4:08 little bit too creamy, so i'm going to make it less creamy with HEAVY CREAM... how ironic
This channel is why I've gone to a cooking school where u work at a restaurant. This channel inspired me to pass the tradition of yt cooking from babby's mother to him to anyone with a cooking channel
Do the monster hunter feast!
Compare your content to your earlier content. Disappointed.
Another brilliant ep! Appreciate you sharing insights into your 'mistakes' - very reassuring to practicing bakers that it's all a case of trial and error.
I’ve never heard someone say “soften” that way before
make a dish out from one studio ghibli movie
solution to frosting being too creamy: add cream
I know someone probably already pitched this idea to you if you haven’t already thought of it yourself, but you should open up your own restaurant that has some of these most iconic movies recipes on the menu.
It's really really really informative to show your mistakes. We learn about the chemistry of cooking in the process, and we learn that small tweaks and changes lead to major differences. I learned a lot from this episode. Thanks!
Can you please do a thanksgiving video? I love your recipes and their the best and easiest to follow and I need ideas for thanksgiving dinner, thank you!
Ain't there two kinda one with ICING and other with cream cheese icing I I could have sworn there was one I don't like crema cheese

A Steven Universe episode would be cool

How do you literally, and philosophically wash your hands?
"WhY is BabISh pUTtiNG uP a PaYWaLL?/1!!?" "THis Is ExCLudInG hIs FAnS!!11" Y'all I'm poor as shit and if I don't wanna pull $5 out of my pocket then I won't, but I'm not complaining! All y'all think Youtube is actually able to fully fund these creators' lifestyles but that just isn't true. You want the content? Pay for it. Can't afford it? Try saving your money and learn to budget. Don't want to pay for it? Shut your mouth and be glad you get to see BWB's content as it is.
Could you make a episode over Chico's Tacos. Dont be an heretic, make them the way they are supposed to be (government cheese).

I hate your videos because they make me hungry but I love them because they teach me how to make stuff
Too creamy adds cream
Can you them if u have braces on yes or no if yes what the best way of eating them
Ok I think that he shouldn't make the pay 2 watch videos because i think way less will see them making them not worth it and if he posted them all here then maybe ads and sponsors will work out + i don't know what the patreon rewards are but i think i'd say the ones that pay get to choose the theme of the dish being made( if it's already this way correct me)

I thought it was binging whatever that was when I have seen your vids recommended in my feed, not bingeing. This is the first vid of yours I have watched.
the lemon ruins the whole thing.
I prefer Swedish cinnamon rolls
What was the rule of thumb for content support? Oh yea, don't paywall your normal content. Hiding episodes behind a paywall is a BS move. I get youtube is being a dick to its creators, but taking what you normally give us and hiding parts of it isn't okay. If you're going to make a paid exclusive, that's fine and more power to you, but it certainly shouldn't be what you're normally giving us as it stands. And before anyone chimes in "But it's EXTRA!" No it isnt. Home made hot pockets could very well have been next weeks episode. This blocked off content could easily be released on normal schedule. The fact that this normal content is being hidden from those who don't want to pay him or can't pay him directly is a paywall and it is NOT extra. Extra would be having an exclusive thing unique to the support, as in a new show or behind the scenes or whatever. But episodes that normally would be released to everyone now being hidden is not cool. On top of that, some of us already pay for Youtube Red, which is basically like already paying for the content of the creators we watch. Yet we are still being fucked over.
The recipe on your website has a few typos. I.e. the 1 teaspoon of salt vs. the half that you mentioned here in the video. Also, it'd be really great if you could write out the amounts for each ingredient in ml or mg, instead of ounces. Those are common measurements used almost everywhere. Ounces are primarily used in the US. Great video though!
Uuuuuuhm people? Are you really "disappointed" that someone who spents time making high quality videos said "IF YOU WANT you can sponsor me with 4.99/month for EXTRA content"????? he never said he is making his videos sponsors only, he said if you want to give him a few bucks for the free entertainment/education he is offering, you can do it with out going to another site
Sweet rolls from Skyrim?

Look at all those Sayoris
Could ya make the gateau from skins
It makes me sad the people here who are complaining about missing out on a small bit of extra content because it’s not FREE. He’s been doing it on his patreon for a while. It’s literally his job, he needs to get paid. I feel like people don’t appreciate the effort that goes into content, since they expect it all for free nowadays. You can’t walk into a restaurant and demand to be served but you don’t want to pay for your food. You can’t refuse to pay the price for a movie ticket because the actors already got paid, but expect to be let into the theatre. It’s not the end of the world if you can’t get all the content you want, when you want it, and at the price you want. I couldn’t care less how much money he makes, you should support people for their content, not until they’re “doing well for themselves”. The great thing about this channel is that the normal videos are super entertaining on their own!
Hooooottt pockets
Back when I worked at a convenient store chain's kitchen, we used to make some of the largest cinnamon rolls. They came frozen in a box, so they weren't as good. Some days we'd only put 4 to a sheet pan, let them thaw over night in the refrigerator case as prep for morning, I had no clue what they did with them as i was never trained or worked mornings, but somehow they'd fill the entire sheet during baking. 6 to 8 was our typical amount per sheet, but 4 was when we got really huge rolls. Don't know what was in those rolls to make them grow that much, but having giant rolls made more profit.
take the swedish version. This just looks fucking bad.
Make The Robin Scherbatsky cocktail from How I Met Your Mother!!!
Now I'm hungry... Again. Thanks....
This reminds me of the sweetroll in skyrim hmm
How much shoul I pay you to send me that cinnamon rolls to Korea? I'm craving for cinnamon rolls ????
When are you going to use useful meassurements? Like grams, liters, kilograms and so
Would this work without egg whites and just the yolks?
Looks tasty. FYI, you're extricating them from the pan, not extraditing them :)
Banish, can you do a drunk voice over. Like drunk history.
I love ya, Babby. Guys, chill out on the payment topic. If you give even 25 cents one time on Patreon, you are contributing like a hundred times more than the standard ad-watching viewer according to Hello Internet. If you haven't given even that much, you have no leg on which to hop in your rage. Also, market forces yadda yadda. We oughtta respect his right to try stuff, even if it sounds dumb and overpriced. His deal.
Why do I hate this guy so much? Hmm. ??
YouTube: Hey, I just want you to know that Philip DeFranco's viewers watch this.
Make Young Sheldon's Texas Brisket.
Oh man, I learn so much from this channel about cooking and baking and stuff, but as someone who already bakes cinniman buns a LOT this was the first episode I loved but also was going "Aaaaaaa!!! Stop messing up those tasy buns!!" through the whole episode xD. I saw those mistakes coming before you even explained them. What I love though is you leave the mistakes in so other people can learn from them too! Cinniman buns done well are heavenly. Bad buns are dry, chewy, and heavy. The good ones I could eat by the dozen...
Make Scooby Snacks
make a discord.
That ad was fire asf
I wish I could help support you. You’re probably the first person who really got me into cooking. Now it’s a passion of mine to learn. One day I will be able to be a patreon. I’ve been trying to get a job as a prep cook to get into the industry.
kitchenaid is expensive as hell.
I don't think I've ever heard someone pronounce the t in "soften."
DO A ALMOND PALMER FROM BIG MOUTH LMAO
I like how people are getting butt hurt about having member exclusive content like he hasn't already been doing that on patreon, like many successful YouTuber's who still continue to upload on a regular basis. He literally said it's the same content as his Patreon supporters, just through YouTube. Y'all need to chill tf out and let Babish do Babish. You aren't his mom and if it bothers you that much then don't watch anymore.
Well damn my favorite channel wants me to pay him for membership content only. I can't afford that. Love ya but you sold out.
Yo can you do the triple gooberberry sunrise
Thank you for keeping the mistakes in!
i made these once for class and we put margarine on the inside before we sprinkled on the cinnamon/brown sugar and were buttery from the inside.

Yo gon get diabetes
Kinda sucks when people pay for YouTube red and still don’t get the fun stuff that a “channel member” does
”gotten to know your rolling pin”
I've been a fan for awhile, but I'm unfamiliar with your history Babish? Did this start as a hobby or is their some education behind this?
running out of ideas...
You tellin me you couldn’t find no clips of cinnamon rolls being made
You over cooked them
I'm surprised you didn't use makara cinnamon, since you used Cinnabon as your inspiration for this video. They actually have a proprietary blend of cinnamon that they use in their rolls. For shame! Haha just kidding ??
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..."
Chum. Bucket. Food.
"As God intended" lmao
What kind of conditioner do you use?
Between the serial plastic wasting sponsorship from Blue Apron and the members only episodes, I feel like you're going down a really bad path.

apple strudel from sound of music, dude
this gave me both an erection and diabetes.
You should do lobster thermidor, from the Lego Batman movie
"Binging"? As opposed to what? Google?
Hey Babish just had this idea. I bought a frozen dinner at the supermarket because I was too lazy to cook today and the picture on the box looks a million times better compared to how this came out. Ever thought of trying these frozen meals and then remaking in a super gourmet way like you do with other meals you’ve prepared? Anyways just a thought, love you channel ????
4:12 When your cream is too creamy so you add cream to make it less creamy while making it more creamy
At this point you're just making food videos then looking for that food in a movie so you have an excuse
What kind of plastic wrap is that?
You gotta do orange sweet rolls on basics now
You should make the sandwich that Peter orders in spiderman homecoming, that would be pretty cool not gonna lie

Good - it's important to learn from mistakes. It took me 4 tries to get your Inglorious Bastards strudel down to a science. Now it's a fam favourite. Never stop binging, Babish
You should make sweet rolls from Skyrim next time!

Jim Gaffigan, noice
how is gaffigan as popular as he is milktoast crap
i like the way u oiled that rolling pin lol
I can never get my head around the american version of cinnamonbuns/rolls,,, im too attached emotionally to the 'swedish' version, the cream on top seems too much in my eyes and makes it look rather unappetizing. But to be fair,i havent tries it with frosting so i guess the flavors evens out!
Have you done the sandvich from team fortress 2? If you haven't done it could you please do it
I love that you put your mistakes because someone making the recipe at home may be doing them without knowing what went wrong
So do I sit in those or eat them?
This is a very childish request but I need to see a binge episode of Jackson and Oliver’s “Cheese Jerky” from Hannah Montana
If you start doing premieres then....
Now that the fallout vault tec cookbook is out. You think you’re gonna try some of those recipes and do your own take on it in the future maybe?
feels frosting is too creamy solution is to add cream Sometimes cooking doesn't make sense.
2nd way better I wanna make that
It would fit better to cinnamon rolls form Cinnabo in Better Call Saul.
He’s so funny I went to his show in Milwaukee
2:16 Did you ask for permission?
The cream cheese/butter is too creamy so lets add some cream to make it less creamy...
What if I want to add chocolate and caramel sauce
You should make Chidi's peep chilli from The Good Place
I'm glad you did keep the footage. It shows us that mistakes aren't terrible and career ending. You learned from it, and passed it on.
The true from scratch challenge, make your own flour, sugar, butter etc.
I'm really sad that Youtube is pushing some of its best creators into having to create premium accounts to help them out monetarily, instead of supporting them and staying true to what made this such a great platform in the first place. I can't blame anyone who is doing so - it makes so much sense, but I think that it's because Youtube is failing as a medium, rather than because this is where 'progress' is. Andrew - you deserve to reap from the content you create, because it is so well made and you can feel the time, effort and talent that goes in to every video you make. Keep it up :)
Thanks for sharing. I just made some last week by hand instead of using a mixer (i.e. wooden spoon handle to mix and hands to need), and I think they were the best I had ever made. I'm kinda swearing off using a dough hook for a bit to see if it makes a difference. But I've been working a couple days a week in a donut shop, so my kneading skills (and strength) have dramatically improved also. I did make the same first mistake, I crowded the pan and had to cut them instead of pulling them apart. But since I waited until they were thoroughly cooled, I got away with it. And I used more of a glaze than an icing so even cooled the icing got into all of the nooks and crannies. I appreciate your showing the first bit because mine looked exactly the same way. I like the 1/2 inch spacing that you did, that seemed just about perfect. I also used, as some noted, the paste method. But, I have never really liked the amount of filling left in the roll, it seems most of it runs out onto the bottom and forms that great crust on the bottom. It's tasty, just not where I want it as I like to unroll the roll to eat it and that makes the middle bite the best. I also used regular sugar, so it needed the butter. I think I'll try your filling and icing the next time and see what a difference it makes. I thought about cream cheese icing, but it didn't seem appealing at the time. Now that I've seen yours, I've changed my mind! Isn't that what sharing all of these great recipes is all about anyway?? Cooking is just one big experiment and always striving to improve.
Can you make Beef Stew from BenchWarmers?
You divide the community with the memberships and the exclusive contant..
that's a lot of nap to go through
I'm still a fan, but I feel like the show has changed. Regular episodes are starting to feel more like Basics with Babish. I liked it back when recipes had a little more creativity, complexity, or even just entertainment value. This episode was just basic cinnamon rolls. ?? Maybe it's time to expand the behind the scenes team. I know you can do better!
In sweden you put a mix of cinnamon, white sugar and butter on the dough which makes it so much more tasty
Couldn’t land a Better Call Saul clip, huh?
Babish needs a paddle for his mixer that has a scraper/spatula on it. Someone get him it for xmas.
Make something from Chuka Ichiban! please.
Much better without frosting and butter in the roll. Americans seem to have a psycosis of covering already good stuff with frosting or cheese
Where are the pickles man
do piss or bear shit from Man vs Wild
Try to make the 99 cheeses pizza from TMNT that would be foookin awesome
I still think he should do the ramen from naruto ?????
I love how your "mistakes" are barely mistakes.
you should make some food from undertale. like glamburgers and steak in the shape of metaton's face, legendary heros.
My favorite dessert
Man now I want cinnamon rolls
I fucking love the mistake parts, because I absolutely do shit like that when I try your recipes unless you specifically say "don't ____, it'll fuck it all up" lol
Can you make a Lembas Bread from Lord of the Rings, please? That would be awsome! :D
OMG He is Human Total Fuck Up on this one Babish.....lol
“So we can pull them apart, as God intended.” -Babish My favorite quote so far.
Please make Big Smoke's order from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas whenever you get the chance.
It would be cool if he could make something from Steven universe
You forgot to spread butter on the dough before adding the sugar and cinnamon mix, that was mistake number one. Usually you mix the sugar and cinnamon into the butter to make a paste and spread that, makes for moister cinnamon rolls. Also it should be pearl sugar on top, not frosting...
yo should make a keto diet video, like how to make a good proper meal
Definitely giving this a go for Christmas
In Norway we make them in a different way, we bake them all separately -not touching at all
It’s either yeast or be yeasted .
its hard not to feel warm when watching this video
Make Naruto Shippuden Ramen Please :) New Subscriber Here :)
3:54 that is the manliest way to sieve something hahaha, I shake my little girl wrist from side to side like the little pussy ho I am but babish cannot relate.
I find the lack of eggs and cardamom disappointing.
Can you do a simple rick from rick and morty????
Sploosh!!! do Zero's Sploosh from the movie Holes please??!!!!!
DO SPLOOSH FROM HOLES!!!
Yes dadish
Soup dumplings from crazy rich Asians!
5:16 - Babby pronounced the t in soften. Bold move.
Jim Gaffigan and you didnt make a HOT POCKET?
Hey Andrew - Love your videos. Would you consider using reusable, beeswax wrap instead of plastic wrap? My wife and I are foodies, and we cook a lot. We're trying to cut down on the plastic that we use, and we've found the beeswax wraps to be the perfect replacement. Give them a shot. You might like them!
Good morning, tippity top cheffers, let's get this roll!
I loved your focus on learning from mistakes! Thanks for sharing that footage, those tips are good to know
To be honest, when I think cinnabun, I think of the famous Louis CK bit. But we don't talk about him anymore...
"Synonym rolls, just like how Grammar used to make."
The next time that you make this, try brushing melted butter on the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mixture. It is delicious!
Can you make synonym rolls?
I have never ever seen or even heard of a cinnamon roll recipe that didn't add copious amounts of melted butter to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Is that even allowed?
Yesss cinnamon rolls. They are a Christmas morning tradition at my house, but really I'm always ready for one. Will give yours a try this year :)
oh yes daddy ( ?° ?? ?°) 2:16
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Oh My...
From now on, I will ALWAYS BOTH literally and philosophically wash my hands BEFORE AND AFTER cooking. Ah, I am learning so much here
You also forgot to add butter onto the dough with the cinnamon sugar mix
I think this should be a basics with babish
please do Triple Gooberberry Sunrise from The Spongebob Squarepants Movie.
Shoulda used Better Call Saul as your inspiration
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" ohhh myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Youtube agolrithims are getting creepy. I was eating a cinnamon roll and thinking of looking up a recipe.
So frustrated that you dont butter the dough before the cinnamon and sugar.
If something is too creamy, just add more cream! :D
Add vanilla to the frostingggggg
Well if you making stuff frome stand up shows You need to make the chocolate cake milkshake from gabriel stand up show
Since you’re not adverse to making Japanese food please make some food from Shokugeki no Soma aka Food Wars! Fake food has never looked so good!
My nigga where is the butter inside of the cinnamon rolls before you actually roll them?
Babish mentioned that he uses vinegar to clean his giant wooden worksurface. I am interested in that! Does someone know the right concentration for wood / kitchen? I would really like to know what concentration is the right one...
I udnerstand early access to your content if we pay, but some of us have been subs since day 1 and followed u on twitch once you started that up. So holding back videos COMPLETELY that would be monetized anyway is very disheartening babish. Dont be a sell out, remember where u came from.
basics with babish fried chicken.??
Hey Babish, Better Call Saul would've made a better excuse to make Cinnamon Rolls.
You are so cool
Again, a really great recipe! You were the inspiration to start my own YouTube channel! thanks for that :) greetings from the Netherlands!
Why didn't you just use Better Call Saul as an excuse instead?
Try to make swedish cinnamon buns or as we say in Sweden Kanelbulle.
All these people in the comments feeling entitled to free content smh
@5:19 he pronounced the T in "soften" and i cringed a little. but he is forgiven, for he is Babish
Please do some foods from the Witcher videogames next!
I really appreciate you showing the mistakes as everyone will probably make the same mistakes. Tutorial videos don't do this often enough, they quite regularly cut out mistakes to reduce length.
Chill that roll before you slice it. They'll cook more even
I hope I'm not asking for too much but I was wondering if you could outline the kitchenware and gadgets that you use, like where you got them from and what we should look for
should not have watched this without an immediate plan to go and get cinnamon rolls
Please give the Naco like you had done for this video.
They taste better if you mix the cinnamon and sugar mixture with butter and them spread it! Thats how we do it in sweden anyways
Add more cream to make this less creamy. mind explodes
why the hell would ya drown the poor buns? holy dang
Pretty soon YouTube will be just like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. Gotta pay for a subscription to watch anything.
Make wilson fisks omelete from daredevil
being swedish this saddens me. i have never seen buns made this way. Why do you americans make everything so big. And why do you cover it in cum ?
Tacos on a stick from icarly
DO THE RAMEN FROM NARUTO
It would be awesome to see you do the foods that Dr House made when he hopped off the Vicodin and got addicted to cooking instead
who cooks with a watch on ? dude...
I have just made cinnamon rolls
do pokemon malasadas next! :D
this isnt pornhub??
I’ve been a loyal fan since you only had a couple of thousand subscribers and I’ve gotta say, I feel like the quality of your videos have gone down a bit, they seem a bit rushed, and I used to love how you’d pick recipes that you could improve by using your own cooking talent as well as following the recipe as the film/ programme stated. Saying that, I wouldn’t pay $5 for the content now, I think your channel is great but it’s lost some of the sparkle it had at the beginning.
I'm very, VERY glad this isn't Louis CK's version.
As a Dane. I find this frosting a total HERESY!!
Getting to know your rolling pin
Thumbnail made me hungry. So I came here.
Really? Not from Walter Mitty? Ahh
but why didn't you add butter with the sugar-cinnamon mix :(
Making something less creamy by adding cream? America explain!!!
I love how you left all the mistakes in . The most important part of the video where I learned the most. Love this channel :D ! Thanks Babish
you forgot the butter in the rolls! Babish i'm heart broken.
YouTube won’t let me get the paid subscription
What is the cover called that he puts on the bowl at 1:59
do... do americans not put a layer of butter before the cinnamonsugar?????????????????????????????????
Who watches Babish, but never tries the recipes? ??
Very enjoyable!!
'if you ask me a little bit too creamy' Proceeds to add cream
For all the people who didn't listen, he's making ADDITIONAL CONTENT for members. You feel so entitled to say you're dissapointed. He literally not taking anything from you.
If youtubers with 2M suscribers can buy lamborghinis, you can at 3.3, not charge fucking 5$ on SpEcIaLs EpIsOdEs. ?????
Too pure for this cruel world
you say the ingredient you're adding and by the time you're done saying it, on screen, you've already finished adding the next ingredient you haven't even mentioned yet. please please stop dong this. you didn't used to do it in your first videos.
you are the best
I understand that you need money for this really nice show but I won’t stick around if I miss a ton of stuff because I don’t pay
Better Call Saul?? Cinnabon?? Missed opportunity..
You ever consider doing the wake-up juice from Back to the Future 3?
too creamy? add cream :D
Disgusting. And not the food, but the membership. Sad and disappointing.
There's no graceful way to oil a rolling pin.
gosh your voice is the bomb i love it im in love ! Just for this voice im making cinnamon rolls
It is so good to see tiny spatula getting some love this week. I don't think it's tiny heart could take any more neglect

Plz make pho Babish!
Finally a proper cinnamon bun. Brioche is not a bun guys, I don't care how much cinnamon you put on or little as it seams at all these uppity joints.
Andrew listen to your subscribers who can't afford exclusive content. at the very least can you make it early release or something? i can't afford patreon.
Oh no! how dare he ask me to pledge $5 (optionally) for a little extra! How will my entitlement to free content go on? Gimme free content reeeeeeee!
It’s too creamy...... L E T ‘ S A D D C R E A M
N U T T
You could have used Better Call Saul as well. As they also have Cinabunn in it :P
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns?
I like how people are complaining about a paywall when BWB literally said at the end of the video that the exclusive "paywall" content is the same exclusive content that his patreon has been getting for years now and just because you have the option of doing or not doing the same thing through a different platform, in this case youtube. Now is when you start to complain.
I miss the days of youtube being free content where people were happy with just ad revenue. Now its patreon youtube subs and some even going to twitch. Your currently making 10 grand a month off your patreon alone, is that really not enough? Add on money you get from youtube ad revenue and sponsorships.
Louis CK’s Cinnabun joke is much better
Please make Kitty Foreman’s brownies from season 8 of That 70s Show that were so moist you could eat them with out milk, thanks.
Do you hire for jobs related to your Corp.
Does anyone else feel Babish's torso judging them?
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." LMAO also, I'm a tad bit confused what I need to do to watch that homemade hot pocket video. will it ever be on youtube?
I'm only 14, I don't even have a job ugh I love your videos so much and I really really really wish I could support!! Like I said, I'm only 14 tho I'm sad you decided to make that decision but I mean it sucks because I think the majority of your fans are kids possibly, or at the most, teens that are in college and can't afford to even get lunch sometimes But you're already receiving a ton of negative feedback which I think nobody's being mean about it and screaming "fuck you babish" or anything which is super good bc they're being tame and simply saying "I'm disappointed" But it's your channel And it's your decision Possibly to even just pay rent So I'll support your decision, in an nonmonetary sense bc I'm broke Either way, thanks for the videos!
Gonna make two batches of cinnamon rolls after watching this. Just so I can learn from the mistakes too ??
Those jokes were dead
hey look, it's a Twit...wait no, Youtube subscription
Jesus Christ, I usually check the comments on Babish's videos because they tend to be decent people having nice conversations, but holy shit everyone is going mental over A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION! Like, just accept it and move on, no one had a problem with the fact he's had a Patreon forever, which does literally the same thing. ???????? ????'?? ?????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???? ?????????? ?????? ??????. Youtube FINALLY does something that makes it easier to be a Youtuber nowadays without the demonetization bot shitting down their throats (and no, I don't think for a second that Babish gets demonetized) and everyone acts like it's the end of the world, chill out, it literally never has to effect you if you don't want it to.
Broooooo he should low key setup a contest and who ever wins, he flys them out to NY(i think that's where he lives) they spend a whole day with him and they are part of a video plus they pick a video of his channel of a dish he has made and they take part in making it
I think you meant literally washed and philosophically didn’t wash your hands
Hey a tip for next time you make these: get non-flavored dental floss and get a good amount. Then put it under the roll halfway and bring the 2 ends up in a crisscross to get a clean even cut. You get more control of your size with that.
You could have just used Schitt’s Creek. As an excuse lol
Can you make brownies?
REEEEE LEAK THT HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS
I know it's been a while since crunchyroll sponsored you, but please give us from food wars A) The Soma vs Joichiro Breakfast Challenge B) The Takumi vs Mimasaka Semifreddo battle and/or c) Soma's risotto stuffed quail

Mistake number one wasn’t forgetting butter under your sugar/cinnamon mixture???
I had a cinnamon roll yesterday at school
My heart stopped just watching this
$5 is less than one half of one lunch out. Get a grip, people. I spend more than this each week on soda
Your god maybe
Make the sundae from that one episode of Spongebob
You should make a video about Gokus epic meals!
Well, after my upcoming contribution to our Halloween Potluck, I know what I'll be bringing to the office NEXT! =D
And now I'm fat. :p /Ok, ok, 'fatter,' dammit, shut up. //totes worth it.
I don’t understand how the standup was funny at all...
Let me thin out my cream cheese, butter and sugar frosting, with heavy cream...
Does anyone else feel accomplished when they see binging with babish using the same utensil as you have at home? Well I sure do
How about the dumplings from “BAO”?
Or it could have rather been the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from better call saul.. :/
“Screwed up royally” lolllll
Now lets do Louis CK’s cinnabons
Nice buns!
why oil not flour? also why bread flour not AP Flour?
IT'S NOT ORANGE! OUTRAGEOUS!
Id like to get to know your rolling pin daddy babby
Jim Gaffigan is a real Queer cock sucker.
Yess such a great breakfast for such a great stand up show lmao
So is the Tu-tur-key-key your Thanksgiving special for this year?
I half expected him to just do the bad batch and call it a video. Nice to see he's picking the quality back up.
Men are u ever coming to argentina?
why are people so angry about the 5 dollar thing? nothing changes for you. i dont sub to his patreon but im not here whining like WOW YOU'RE MAKING US PAY FOR BEHIND THE SCENES?? his regular content will still be free (with ads ofc). like let him live. we all need money to survive and we can all do with it as we please. its not like he's genuinely forcing it on you. god damn.
You know Babby, I could've really used a Hot Pocket tutorial ??...
You shouldn't knead on medium speed. Its 2 for kneading. You definitely shouldn't knead on medium on camera. Pretty sure you just voided your warranty.
I hate Jim so much lol
Jim Gaffigan is a terrible comedian
Make taco on a stick from icarly
Who thinks he should do a series were he makes the biggest foods from restaurants taking the normal ones and make them huge
You didn’t butter the inside! Cinnamon and sugar, and melted butter, roll it up and butter even more! The more butter the better!
It's too creamy I think I'll add HEAVY CREME to thin it out
Okay I lovya babish but cream cheese icing? Why man. Why
90 of your dishes go into the "clean plate club" is had lost its prestigious label.
Can you make Chidi's Chilli from The Good Place ?
$5 a month for one single channel? I love this channel but that's ridiculous, especially since you're paywalling some of your videos.
A question, is it cinnamon rolls, ir cinnamon buns? Or are they different baked goods?
Better Call Saul would have been a good reference as well.
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ??
I have a question: What size eggs do you use?
I love that Babs always owns his mistakes. It makes beginner cooks a lot less intimidated to know that everyone makes these kinds of screw-ups.
Anyone else catch the innuendo he made while greasing the rolling pin?
For some reason I thought the cream was salt and I almost cried
I don’t see the membership option.
Babish would probably crucify me. I forget to add bacon, cheese, salt and pepper before flipping my omelette over every time.
Do food from Studio Ghibli films!
Crème de la crème à la Edgar !
So how much do we have to donate to patreon to have you cook a meal for us? ??
There are no mistakes in art.
Glad to see I’m not the only one sad I don’t get to see that exclusive homemade hot pockets episode. It’s not a matter of not wanting to support you, rather an inconvenience to your fans that we would all have to pay $5 to see a new recipe. I understand you want to be compensated for your work, but this idea leaves a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
2:16 ( ?° ?? ?°)
Can you please make Pokepuffs?
Bruh next time spread the butter across the dough then add the sugar spice mixture fam.
That was awesome! Thank you so much for including the "what not to do section." I honestly learn more from those honest mistakes!
Dude Why do I feel the need to see you in an episode of Bob's Burgers?
anyone else unroll the cinnamon roll then lick the frosting off your finger only to realise you haven't washed your hands but you don't wanna wash them cause then you loose 50% of the frosting so you keep licking it off your fingers anyway?
You ran out of ideas from movies and TV shows huh...
4:09 MAKE LESS CREAMY BY ADDING MORE CREAM
There are too many swedes on the internet to propagate these lies of their cinnamon rolls being better -- they are almost always dry, have weird added spices that throw off the flavor of the cinnamon, and they sprinkle freaking rocks of sugar on top. Get out of here with that shit.
Could you do some dish from the Hundred Foot Journey?
With you voice Babbish, you need to narrate a documentary or something. It's so soothing.
Thank you Babish ,you are the Jesus of cooking
Love Jim Gaffigan
White comedians are so cringy lol
BABISH!
You should make Minnie’s chocolate pie from The Help or Ed’s sauce from GoodBurger
Easily eat all 12 of them
Not a fan on exclusive episodes behind a paywall.
I’m having so much unnecessary anxiety your videos are probably the only thing that calm me down .??
"once you gotten to know your rolling pin"
why are you putting content behind a paywall? sigh... that's kinda sad
If I wasn’t burnt out on Cinnamon rolls I would make these for breakfast... Screw it, they look too good to not make them.
Never clicked on a video so fast
Who the fuck puts cream cheese a on cinnamon roll?
My family visits Cinnabon regularly and my young kids love to watch the workers make cinnamon rolls. One thing they do differently is adding softened butter to the dough after it's been rolled out and then adding a cinnamon-heavy mixture on top of that. If you're going for the Cinnabon level of roll that Gaffigan is talking about, you gotta add butter to the dough and vanilla to the frosting.
Make more videos God damnit
I tried to pass this video because I knew I would get hungry but it looked too good... now I’m hungry
You mean sweet roll
Make a sandwich from Scooby-Doo
My wife makes cinnamon rolls that are indistinguishable from Cinnabon...main difference is she butters the inside of the roll as well
yeah dude. i mean, i know u gotta pay ur bills and shit; but ive been following u since u had 100k followers. Last couple episodes were all about that blue apron shit, and again, i dig that. but, if thats the way you going with this channel, i appreciate all the videos uve posted and i wish u good luck
do the Kimchi Gumbo from the movie "Searching"
>says the frosting is too creamy >adds cream
sorry babish but i need to report this for pornography
I think I'll stick with my kanelbullar.
Please do Peeps in the Chili Pot from last week's episode of the Good Place...clean plate club member for sure.
The best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made are the Alton Brown Good Eats book recipe, but I’ve gotta try these
This is too creamy... adds cream Now I understand the use here, but the name makes it sound counterintuitive
You should try making swedish cinnamon rolls. :)
I am so obsessed with cinnamon rolls rn too omg ??
If we're letting stand-up comics in, can you do orange chicken from Jo Koy's set?
Those cinnamon rolls looked so good it brought tear to my eye. (I know, pathetic, but cinnamon rolls are amazing. Anyone who says different has issues)
I'm too broke for memberships aaaaaah. I feel bad that I can't support you through Patreon already. Ahhh college sucks.
I’ll be unsubbing, I don’t support paywalls
the amount of people crying over content they didn't even know they were missing is amazing. you didn't have it, you didn't lose it, yet you're still crying about it.. he isn't changing to sub-only for fucks sake, he just uploads a few videos for patreons and sub-only.. its not the end of the world, you won't see less videos of him..
I feel like my grandma could teach you a thing or 2 but it’s good you did okay, love the vids keep it up??
You should make chocolate covered meatballs from that one episode of american dad just to give you a challenge.
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin,...." Shouldn't we have taken it out for dinner & a movie first...?
Want to make your cinnamon rolls extra sticky and yummy? Pour a cup of heavy cream over the rolls before baking as normal. I transcended the human plane after tasting it.
First of all, I am an absolutely straight man. Now this is what I have to say, dude you are an absolutely beautiful man with those cinnamon rolls no I think the cinnamon rolls are beautiful.
too creamy... adds heavy cream.
If you ever come to Texas, go to Lulu's in San Antonio. They make a GIANT 3 lbs cinnamon roll. It is delicious and absolutely almost impossible to finish.
Synnonym roll like grammar used to make
You forgot butter with your cinnamon and sugar mixuture
This guy is a greedy sellout
Saul Goodman would be proud of you
DONE! I wish I had thought to take PICTURES! But the moment I saw this video go up I knew I had to try it! The rolls hadn't finished cooling before they were all gone! Clean plate club for sure! This is an amazing recipe and I can't wait to make them again! Thank you for all your hard work!
Put them in a box & send to me plz as is, I don't care! I am the barb kelner of cinnamon rolls! lol
It's 4 am and i'm competely wasted, watching this helps me ti survive this night
Love jim
Why don’t you add butter with the cinnamon sugar?.... won’t omitting the butter result in a dryer cinnamon bun?
What is it called cinnamon bun, cinnamon role or cinnamon swirl? Or did they do that to screw with us
Too creamy? Add cream.
Can you make the good burger sauce from good burger
Louis C.Ks standup on Cinnabun is hilarious
Babish has Big Dick Energy pass it on
I'm sad that I can't eat these since I'm allergic to cinnamon. I always walk past cinnamon rolls in the store and they are so temping.
I really just think you wanted to make more cinnamon rolls...and I'm ok with that because? I'd do the same
it was only a matter of time before your success warranted a paywall. congratulations are in order.
Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin ??
People seem to not understand this one simple fact: It's literally the exact same thing the patreon supporters were getting in the first place. You aren't getting fully pay walled for his normal content. So why shit on Andrew for making adding just a little bit more to his income? If you have the extra money, cool... If not you'll still be getting ALL the normal content.
This looks soooooooo good
This episode makes me feel sleepy.
What is better for you fees wise, youtube membership or patreon? I will do whatever charges you the least fee percentage.
Only one way to remove paid sites on a ad driven website.  Unsubscribed

That frosting is vomit inducing.
Woah woah wooooaaah, you're putting whole episodes behind the paywall now? No, come on man, you know better.
Great now make me some.

Cinnamon rolls? You mean Lin Manuel Miranda
Great video keep it up
WAIT did babish just make a mistake? ???????
I shouldn't have laughed that hard on some of the things you've said on this particular episode. oh well.
You forgot the bacon
Boo, locking content behind paywall. For shame.
Gain 10lbs by just watching the video..how..HOW!!!

Your collection of tiny kitchen utensils has gotten me intrigued beyond belief. Tiny wHisk isn't alone anymore.
Let this man make money on something he works hard on. This literally doesn't take anything away from you, it's extra content. Welcome to capitalism.
secretly wishing I was the rolling pin . . .
I was looking for one of these.
I love Jim Gaffigan
Momma always butters the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mix
This morning I saw this video and I craved cinnamon rolls and I’m home alone on fall break and I don’t have enough money for postmates so I decide I’ll walk to the store which is about a mile away. So I look and look but I don’t find and money. All I found was a 1964 50 cent coin... ??!!! All silver coins (accept nickles) before 1965 were made of 90% silver! And I know there is a gold and silver shop near my house that I can walk to (about 0.5 miles away) so I take the coin and sell it for $6 then I go to the store and get the cinnamon rolls but my sister texts me to get her Starbucks from my Starbucks account but my phone is at 1% so I barely make it and then walk 1 mile home. Worth it.
when he was like wow it doubled in sized
I love you even more Babish for the Jim Gaffigan refrence????.
I wanna punch the person who came up with the the name for "Cream Cheese" It sounds like the most disgusting thing ever I mean who would combine cheese and cream
You should write these down
I like how the comments are filled with peoples “you know what I think” ‘s, and others complaining about paying to support. Real classy. Keep up the good work man, and make some food from Zelda. ??
Soff-ten?
I like mine made with half cake flour, half AP flour so they’re very tender, and I use a brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter mixture to fill. I skip the frosting because I’m already eating a cake filled with sugar and butter. It’s just too much for me.
the entitlement coming from people who consume content for free is a whole lot lmao, you don't have to pay nor will your normal vids get affected by the choice
$4.95 a month is absurd! You better post a new killer recipe about every few hours to justify that. And how about posting the recipes in the comments to save some time. That way we can go out and earn some money to pay for ridiculous YouTube subscriptions! Get real.
If you cut them with a thread they retain a more round shape. My mom would freak out if she saw you cut them with a knife.
BITCH WTF HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS TAKE MY MONEY BINGINGWITHBABISH
You should make bread pudding next
The stand up wasn't funny at all
This video made my stomach growl so much! I would love love love to see you recreate the fluffleberry cake from the Trolls series on Netflix! Your content is so visually appealing!
Would you like that with some hot jizz?
bless. you.
jim gaffigans the best.
Don’t you wish they served this for breakfast at school?
Louis CK had a good bit abt cinnabuns ??
Try putting softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and marshmallows inside your cinnamon rolls! And instead of that frosting use powdered sugar, milk, oil, and almond flavoring. It’s really really good, I promise!
2:15 ( ?° ?? ?°)
"We can pull them apart as God intended" ... I love you Babish
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" hahaha
Babish oiling that rolling pin????
I mean, so long as he continues to release his regularly scheduled videos, I don't really care about the member stuff.
Anyone whining about him offering extra content to people who are willing to pay for it is a pathetic loser.
Babish in 4K is amazing
you should "make" an app like Tasty or Fit Men Cook with recipes with in app purchase for new seasonal recipes
Filthy Frank's Hair Cake.
Can you do a cooking mama recipe?? If you haven't done it already.
There is no god.
ohmygod seeing people complain about how Andrew is utilizing the YT membership is making me so angry. Y'ALL FORGET THAT THIS IS HIS JOB!!
Duuude Finallyy You did cinnabon rolls!
1. Watches video of delicious looking homemade cinnamon rolls 2. Drives to to store and buys cinnamon rolls in a tube
Shoutout: To the Kousher Salt For making this channel possible
Make the Ethiopian food from the Simpson's
I like how Babish decreased the 'creaminess' of the frosting by adding cream lol
If you’re making food from a comedy act, you can do food from anime. Make bell peppers and beef from Cowboy Bebop
What did you cover the dough with when you first rested it?
Mooncakes please
Think of it this way. If he can't make a living off youtube then he'll have to get a 9-5 job and cut back on videos. No one wants that right?
Make Kingpin’s omelette.
I already have an absolutely perfect recipe for cinnamon rolls that I found years ago.
To all those complaining about the pay wall , you're not losing anything. Those people are just paying for something extra. It's fair.
Daddy babish back at it again blessing me with your skills ?? (no homo)
Make dc mumbo sauce
Weirdly enough, 2 of the 3 mistakes were also done by Andrew in Tasty's Eating your Feed... and it was also a Cinnamon Roll... o_o
Babish I'm moving into an apartment to be closer to college at the end of this year and I swear to God you are going to get me through that with your recipes
2:18 He says once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin Right as he is stroking the wood u see what I’m saying
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" tell us how you really feel Andrew.
What yeast do you use ? And what kind of sifter did you use in this video ?
I don't understand why everyone is so up in arms about him having paid extra content. He already has a patreon that gets extra content when you pay, so why not having the exact same thing here? It's not like he's not doing his regular content anymore. You give extra, you get extra. It's literally EXTRA for a reason.
He messed up on purpose so that he had an excuse to make more cinnamon rolls.
Omg I just drooled Input Homer Simpson Drooling hear....................... I wish I had a Stan mixer with attatchnents. Now I want Cinnamon rolls Yummmmmmmmmmmmm
Wow did not need to see Babish lubricating his rod...
This dough should be sticky Oil up the rolling pin because the dough is sticky
I've made probably like 600lbs of bread or more, and I gotta say, I've never had an issue with yeast+salt, you should do a mythbusters style myth busting episode of cooking beliefs vs reality. Like how some people put oil in their pasta water to make it not stick etc.
FUCK This Really I bet you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon rolls (Edit) Just read the description make something tomorrow (Edit2) This is Just a Joke (edit3) make bubbas shrimp part 2
I looooove your videos! They make cooking look like so much fun. I would love to see you do the MLT from The Princess Bride! Also, some of Amy’s creations from Brooklyn 99 like the baking soda mashed potatoes ??
I don’t understand what the big deal is about Andy’s decision. You have the option to pay for extra content. Extra. It’s not like he’s suddenly making his whole channel inaccessible unless there’s payment. I think it’s completely fair. You can choose to not pay and still see his normal videos as per usual.
I'll be making vegan cinnamon rolls tomorrow I'm so excited
Make anything from the cartoon show chowder
bell peppers and beef (cowboy bebop) ?
I just want God intended fluffy bread..
Folks complaining about a “paywall” should understand it's only for extra content. Regularly scheduled Babby will continue for free (ad-supported)
1 (and biggest one) mistake: give a fuck about visuals and texture. Man Like my Mother always says:" it should Not Look Like Hiroshima, but Bit broken is ok." Banking never goes like you would expect it. So chill. Your First try was good too. Next time do karnellbular (real cinnamonbuns). They are much better than that what you call cinnamonbuns
DUDE!!!! I just saw you on Buzzfeed's Worth It!! Crazy, out-of-nowhere cameo! That was so cool! Small world!
Babish likes Jim Gaffigan holy shit my life is complete
So two things. 1). Can you do like a basics episode, but for college students? Like how to make good food with only a stove, oven, and hand tools, maybe a crockpot. Because I'm in college right now and would love to make some of your recipes, but I dont have access to a stand mixer, or an electric hand mixer, or any real "fancy" tools. I just think it would be really cool. 2). I am not a fan of the membership for "normal" videos. I can understand if it was for like the behind the scenes and Q&A videos that I know you do on patreon, but not for this. I'm a college student, I can barely afford groceries and gas right now, I can't afford to pay for videos, as much as I want to see them. I love your content, but I dont think this is the right thing to do. No matter what happens I'm still going to keep watching whatever I can.
Make the food from The Green Mile
You can get sponsored by audible and do book foods One suggestion I have is the foods from Rutabaga: the adventure chef
This makes me so sticky.
Babish I don't want to be that guy but you're already pulling down a healthy six figure salary each year purely off the Patreon revenue you already have plus whatever you get off of ads and sponsorships. I'm not so sure that exclusive videos are the best way to take the channel, $5 a month might not seem like much but it adds up and the entirety of Netflix is only $8 a month, I don't think that's really a good price point for one single channel that gets maybe an extra episode or two per month in comparison.
Babish: puts dough in a bowl to rise for the millionth time Me: "Holy shit it so big now"
Everything candy from Jimmy Neutron ????????
What if you flour your surface/rolling pin instead of oiling it. Does that work just as well?
Charge a dollar and you’ll make more money. Less people will be “disappointed” and more people will be comfortable with spending a dollar vs 5. Enough to outweigh how much you would make charging 5, I believe. I’m thinking about it like this. Netflix costs $7.99 for way more content so it seems very disproportionate to people. Doesn’t 1 seem so much further away from 8 then 5? Enough so for people to be enticed enough to care and think they’re getting a better deal out of it.
Wow. Ok. A pay-wall for "exclusive episodes". This is a sad day. Didn't think you were the kind of creator to do us like that Babs. Gonna have to drop a downvote on this episode, first one ever but trying to cash out on supporters who have been supporting you since the beginning, people who have bought your cookbook, watched your ads, clicked your links, and upvoted every episode... This is kinda gross.
Best cooking show out there.
Clicked so fast because I thought Jim Gaffigan was guest staring. Good job Babs, ya got me! Great recipe too!
Guys if you don’t want to support him just don’t. He wants to make something special for those who have the ability to give him extra support and it’s okay!! Let him live
I don't know why I hate cinnamon rolls. Everything about them is right. But my body just says "this is too fucking sweet and the filling does not work with the dough." home made or not, I kind of hate them But I'll kill the shit out of a tray of those gross orange frosted Pillsbury rolls.
damn but i wanna know how to make hotpockets
this is a bit of a stretch
I don't know where Jim is getting his Cinnabon from, but every cinnamon roll I've seen from them is about the size of a head of garlic.
“*rubs oil over rolling pin suggestively* once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” ??????
I add extra brown sugar to avoid the frosting and crowd to keep slightly moist dough. People love them.
for all those saying "Eww paywall eww" Shut your bitch ass up. Nigga got to eat, and with all the bull shit youtubes going through dont be suprised.
really..so I'm never going to see how you make hot pockets?
Make the doughnut breakfast sandwich from the same stand up please!
I love this channel so much, but that "join" button makes you look like a piece of shit. It makes me think of someone like Jake Paul.
you could have made this a better call saul episode and ya blew it! :P
It could also be from better call saul
DAAAAMN i want it now
do chug jug from fordnide
Gonna take a wild guess and say the opening scene was Andrew's 2nd favorite Cinnamon Roll related bit. Can you guess the first? Hint: Louis CK
Yes. Love the change in format. Don't be afraid to express yourself just because you've accumulated a lot of subscribers now, people like your personal creativity as well
Ah, Jim Gaffigan. My favorite comedian. By the way, the special that clip was from is called Beyond the Pale, and it's on Netflix if you want to give it a listen.
HOLY FUCK THAT LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING JESUS GOD I WANT IT NOW!!!!
what watch are you wearing?
People consider standup comedy funny? That's fucking retarded.
Including mistakes was a nice touch! Nice to see you jazz up the formula.
HEY GURL HEY ??
this is a version of art, in video format, it is entirely fine for him to charge for extra videos. It takes time and effort to film and edit, if he feels the need for added compensation I'm glad he felt comfortable enough to do so. No one's forcing you to pay, the fuck is this attitude of 'i get so many videos for free how dare you not give me everything'
For everyone that is pissed off that he has an exclusive membership for extra content, if you don't want to pay, you get a video a week. If you would pay 5 bucks a month you get extra. Literally if you want more you have to pay, just like everything in life.
why is this in my recommended
Fuck jim gaffiagan
So why not use 2 baking pans? And why pans over sheets?
Hey Mr. Babish. I have a recommendation for one of your videos! You should make Mrs. Beans famous nutmeg ginger apple snaps from fantastic Mr. Fox.
dam, you literally made my friend shed a tear with that pan removal.
Once you got to know you’re rolling pin ????
I love Jim Gaffigan! He's great ??
2:17 Andrew, I - don’t even know what to say
You should do the number 9 menu idea in Regular show
I just saw Jim Gaffigan Nashville
So just cinammon rolls? Putting Jim in the title seems pointless.
I am so glad that you use lemon in your recipe! It really brightens up the flavor!
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
This guys whole channel is a fuckin joke just takes click bait names for things people like and oh I’m making that
Exclusive episodes, woohoo.... One more youtuber falls to the dark side... I get that you need money, i get that you want to give something back to people who support you, but content paywalls are the dark side of this kind of content... Other channels managed to get better ways to do that...
I used to work at Cinnabon, good try, but not even close.
Good excuse
Lmao “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” I can’t????
Cook with Gordon Ramsay dude!
will the membership exclusives eventually become videos you put on your channel free?
Well, you pronounced the T in 'soften', so I'm afraid that's it for me. Good luck in all your future endeavors.
Don't call it "mistakes," call it what it is; "Research and development." It always pays off doing a test run 1st whenever you're doing new things in the kitchen.
"cream in the cream cheese until creamy, but this was too creamy so i added cream"
Well he's offering a service. Paying for that service makes sense.
Anyone else say “Oh fuck” @5:20
I love this channel just finished binge-watching every video
"once you get to know your rolling pin"
Capitalizing??
Make Rick and Morty food
Is the buttermilk measured in fluid ounces?
its scientifically proven salt will not damage yeast. its a culinary school myth
I want to mention I think the babish sponsor isn't as bad as people are saying. We're not losing the videos on Tuesday and Thursday because this is implemented, it's just an option you have to pay for more content in a week. I think it's understandable that $5 could seem steep some people myself included but I don't think it's totally outlandish when people are super down to subscribe to channels on Twitch all the time just for emotes and no additional content. I'm not into the idea of a highly requested episode being behind a paywall, so I hope the sponsored episodes are ones that Andrew specifically thought to create.
Whats the generic reason a person would oil their work service vs flouring it?
Man you’ve gotten lazy. You used to have original and unique recipes and variations but now you just made a generic cinnamon roll literally anybody could make. On top of this you introduce paid content? Your subs are going to plummet
How you gonna make cinnamon rolls and not make chili after
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
Ha! "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Ha!
Make a Mr.Robot or Tim Burton special please? And either make something from We Bare Bears
Could you subsitute all purpose flour instead of bread flour?
Too creamy he says while adding more cream
WHY DIDNT YOU USE THE CINABON SCENES FROM BETTER CALL SAUL!!!!!!!!! IM MAD
Why'd ya have to tease me like this? Evil!
did you actually just pronounce the "t" in soften as in "soft-en" ?!
This Look So Good ??
Can you pleeeaaaase do the mini muffins ????
You should do Katsudon from Yuri!!! on Ice or San Xian noodles from Flavors of Youth
If you make mistakes in your recipes, I really think you should leave the footage in. You could show the audience first hand what it should and shouldn't look like. The mistakes you make I guarantee 99% of society will make too.
The darkening injures him in the left thigh
What is that cover called that he puts over the bowls?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS JIM GAFFIGAN IS AMAZING
Those mistakes were really just blessings in disguise. Would still eat.
Do a real kanelbulle!
Cummie rolls ??????
I mean to be fair call me a fat fuck but I would wish the cinnamon rolls were bigger
the fact you’re making ‘exclusive’ content has really made me want to stop watching your channel which is a shame because i love everything you post, but you’re starting to get too greedy.
• At the start of the video: [sees Jim Gaffigan] . . . ? ??? ?????~??s ? • Watching the end slate: [gaaaasp!] ? HOMEMADE HOT POCKE~ETS! ?
Cream cheese frosting + Cinnamon rolls = ??
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish, because it's not related to movies or TV?
We have all intentionally fucked up cinnamon rolls before babish. It's like a culinary right of passage.
Do Ed's Sauce from Good Burger!!!
Snazzy wrist watch, Babby???? If you're running out of ideas, a House MD Special would be awesome
when will we get bubba's shrimp part 2 bab
I love Jim Gaffigan and I Binge watch Babish all the fairly often
Can you make food from fantastic mr Fox
So... he’s asking us to pay $4 a month to watch “extra” stuff even when he already earns a ton of money? Come on Andrew.
2:16 “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” please tell me I’m not the only one with a dirty mind ????
I really don’t understand why everyone is so upset about the membership exclusive videos; it’s the exact same concept as what Babish is doing on Patreon. This is also his job now and it’s ridiculous to expect him to keep churning out content without payment. I get that he has sponsors and stuff but I’m sure these videos get expensive and people need to eat and pay rent too. Nobody is obligated to pay for a membership, it’s just a way to support content creators you like.
Too creamy. Add some cream.
I love Jim gaffigan
I have only eaten cinnamon rolls like twice in my life but whenever i see them in a cooking video i crave them so much. Its 01:08 AM, HELP
I don't even cook that often but I cant get enough of you're content. It must be that angelic voice you have ??
Need more Baking with Babish™ in my life
Babby, I really enjoyed the mistakes, on shorter videos (if the mistakes happen again) please repeat! Especially as it's a benefit to us lower level cooks AND it's pretty funny and humanising, nobodies perfect!
Waaaaaaaat no worstishiresgshshhjtehurehurhier sauce
Is that a rolling pin in your apron or are you just happy to see me?
You should make the "Captain Crunch casserole" from Futurama
Microwave wings from regular show pls
The day has finally come!!!! :)
Can you make Borscht?! please
you must be really struggling there having adds, sponsored videos plus asking for donations...WOW!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Have you made spaghetti tacos from icarly, because if not I think you should
Let me just break out my wheelbarrow
Infinity War foods - 'Metaphysical Ham on Rye' Reuben Sandwich, 'Stark Raving Hazelnut' ice cream, 'Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge ice cream, Deep Fried Edinburgh Kebab, Zarg Nuts
Dilutes creamy mixture with cream
hey great videos! it would be cool to see you make kringle like the kind you can find in Racine, WI
Shouldve done it “from breaking bad” lol
Good to know even the mighty babish makes mistakes. And still eats them ??
Lemon zest should be mandatory.
Gut busters Malcolm in the middle
Didn't Louis CK do a similar bit? Or are we just acting like he's dead to everyone now...
Ohhh THATS why they're called Cinnamon rolls
Make Asuna's Ragu stew from SAO!
REALLY!!!!!!! THE ONE ITEM I WAS WAITING FOR AND NOT PRESSURING YOU ABOUT, WE HAVE TO PAY TO SEE?!?!?! HOT POCKETS, FML
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish? Great video though.
My Grandma always makes her frosting too sweet but love the rolls
Also Louis CKs stuff
Don't get greedy
Babish, make the foods from Everybody Loves Raymond.
I'm with the majority here, don't sell out and get greedy trying to make more money at the expense of the people that love your chanel. It's a good way to lose subscribers in my opinion.
Since when does anyone need an excuse to make cinnamon rolls? There’s never a bad reason to make delicious cinnamon rolls??
Wish he used someone funnier to make cinnamon rolls ??
???? ????
haaahha paaaaahhckaaat
Ehh i like the video but Jim gaffigan isnt funny
Sonic the hedgehog chilli dogs
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." ( ?° ?? ?°) Also, premium content behind a paywall is bad in many definitions of the word. If you're putting it behind a paywall, make it limited. A month waiting period or something along those lines so EVERYONE gets the content, but you're still making it very much a "support me and see it early" kinda thing. Most folks are okay with something like this.
Please do the food from Haven
You should do the mud pie and salad from Drop Dead Fred, both movie accurate and edible versions
rubs oil sensually over rolling pin "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." I lost it Lmfao
argh its torture :T i wanna see that homemade hot pocket episode :V
Could have easily done cinnamon rolls from better call Saul, where they make them like 6 times
You forgot to spread the dough with 18 pounds of butter per square inch
Please do the foods from Once Upon A Time in America!!!
I really, really hate cooking. But I really, super love watching you cook. Keep up the awesome work. Such a great channel.
i like pizza
godly
?????? "as god intended"?????? 5:25 sec
Good on you for the honest mistakes. I've been consistently impressed with you as a YouTuber and I hope you keep producing content. Great Stuff Babish!
Has Jim Gaffigan ever actually been funny about anything? He's almost on the same level as Springfields "What's up with that?"
Make orange marmalade from Paddington!
when i was a girl scout, every single year for christmas we got together for a gift exchange and to make cinnamon rolls. i was a scout for about 10 or so years (i mean, once a scout, always a scout, but you get the picture) and it was what i always looked forward to most. these cinnamon rolls were absolutely melt in your mouth. we barely gave them time to cool and they just dissolved, so sugary sweet it was like heaven. it's been nearly 10 years since i last had one of those suckers and think about them more often than i probably should. i ran into my troop leader a few weeks ago, and asked her for the recipe and she said maybe we can all get together again for a reunion - and of course, cinnamon rolls. my little heart can hardly wait.
Why are you destroying a wonderful Scandinavian pastry by drowning it in cake icing? It's also way too thick, lacks cardamom and has almost no cinnamon in it.
“I’m using this as an excuse” Just say u wanted some cinnamon rolls
Do we have to use egg
You should do dorm style foods
I absolutely LOOOVE Cinnabons!!!!! Too bad I can't buy them where I live :(
Maybe you should make apple cake
In the movie Gamer the kid asked for a sandwich with every "butter" the could find: peanut butter, almond butter, ect. It would make for good content I think
Please make Foods from Seinfeld part 2
Rat Burger, Demolition Man
Just did some research and found that Luis ck. took the joke, not the other way around.
No cardamom? These are heathen cinnamon rolls.
388,943rd view
I have to pay to see all the episodes now? Can't say I blame you, but I'm really not happy ether.
Foods from the Marvel Netflix shows would be a good one. So Wilson Fisks breakfast from Daredevil, some whiskey based cocktails inspired by Jessica Jones and some of the asian cuisine in Iron Fist. Cant think of anything for Luke Cage atm but its been a while since I watched it.
Slowly spreads oil on rolling pin "so once you have gotten to know your rolling pin"
Damn these look delicious. I learned to make cinnamon rolls from my nanna (she wasn't actually my grandma but she was as good as), and she always put down a thicc layer of butter on the rolled out dough before all the cinnamon-sugar; so, if you're looking for an extra dose of decadence, give it a shot!
As God intended ??????
Loved the extra footage of learning from your mistakes. Would love to see more stuff ups and fixes in the future
Or from Better Call Saul.....
Please do the most expensive mc1035 from archer
In Maya Rudolph hormone monster voice make whatever you want daddy, I won’t judge
Do the krusty burgers from the Simpson’s or well known as skinners “steamed hams”
Could have used the Homer Simpson clip of him wrapped up like a big toasty cinnamon bun.
2:17
Make a time lapse of bread rising
better call saul could have worked.
Better call Saul Pimento sandwich???
I'm glad you found an excuse to make cinnamon rolls!
You HAVE to butter the sheet of dough before putting the cinnamon and sugar on and rolling! It’s the most important step :( idk how people eat dry ass rolls
You should’ve put bacon grease on the table
Oh nice youtube is becoming a patreon/twitch copy, how wonderful.
they're beautiful
Today in my foods class while cooking I said “let those flavors get to know each other” and my teacher gave me extra credit for being clever??????
You should make 1 of the meals that the Palico make in Monster Hunter World or all of them
For better cuts for cinnamon roles use butchers twine or unflavored floss, tie it around and gently squeeze to make better cuts
Those rolls would of came out 100x times better if you 1 Before you sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar you brush on Crisco (Shorting) and 2. add a little bit of vanilla in frosting, anyone trying this trust me just covering the dough with shorting before the sprinkle will make a night and day difference
Do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil.
“Once you’ve got to know your rolling pin” then rubs it up and down ??
hmm too creamy..... ADD MORE CREAM!!!
”Getting to know your rolling pin”
"it's too creamy so I'll add cream" Idk why this made me laugh
5:19 "as we extradite..." did you mean EXTRICATE?? ; )
Regular show, Microwave wings
But what makes bread bread is the shape of it that let's you cut it into a slice?
And what resulted was a truly delicious cinnamon roll
If you guys wonder how he knows that the dough is 14 inches. He uses my dong as measurement.
I feel like this could have totally been a Better Call Saul reference.
Should do animal shaped chicken tenders
Looks so good!
you nailed it the 2nd time around, looks amazing. But mistakes are just as delicious!
what is the specific plastic wrap that you use?
Star baker! Love it, could you use custard?
In the bakery i used to work in i was the cinnamon roll guy, made about 10 dozen a day. We never frosted ours, i would put maple syrup and pecans on the bottom which became the top when flipped over to get them out, 7 in a 12 inch tray and thats how we sold them.
Someone please .. i beg you.. comment the ingredients in gramm/kilogramm etc..
First I finally buy your cookbook and then you upload? Best. Day. Ever.
Beef jerky from the Simpsons!
Hi Babish, don't know if you'll ever read this or even care, but in my location we don't have access to channel memberships and it's really depressing that I'm missing an upload because of it!
Babish they are releasing a fallout 76 cook book and was wondering if you’d make some recipes from it
I want to see the Monkfish Turkey from Malcolm in the Middle. Probably impossible.
Want a better flavour profile for the cinnamon rolls? Add a splash of vanilla and lemon extract to the frosting, and use only brown sugar in the cinnamon/sugar mix. I used to work at Cinnabon, and these were things we did there. Otherwise, everything is on point!
I can smell them lol
Make the cheesecake from friends
Bro why do u want so much fucking money from your fans you already have a Patreon for no reason, it’s not to fund your content you already make enough money to buy everything you need for your videos. Stop selling out and looking for every single oppurtunity to make more money and instead let YouTube be what it was meant to be in the first place which is a space for unique, creative content that is free for users.
Seems too creamy... adds cream. — ya boy Babish, 2018
I put a stick of melted butter on the cinnamon sugar mixture, before I roll it, it makes the rolls gooier, more like Cinnabon.
It's really interesting because the swedish recepie is kinda different but also the same. The dough is the same, but we also sread it with butter and then add the cinnamon and sugar. We cut it and then place them individually in a muffinpaper on a bakingsheet and put them in the oven. You could also switch the cinnamon for either vanilla and almonds or cardamon and sugar. Also we don't really put icing on them, that's weird.
Did rolling pin even buy you dinner? Monster
Anyone else think of Skyrim’s sweet rolls?
4:08 Too creamy? Add cream
OMG HE SHOULD DO THE “TO THE MAX” SANDWICH FROM WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
Please do Paddingtons orange jam
Hmmmmmm...... Too creamy....... Needs cream.
This guy is such a low key savage
So they are basically Chelsea Buns, just without the dried fruit and instead of a basic stock syrup glaze, a cream cheese frosting? Meh.
We can support him on patreon, now we can pay money in the channel also, and in addition to that watch videos that are sponsored and affect the content of the videos. We can buy his books and shop for things from his website. Are we done merchandising or not quite yet? I was a fan very early, but it has become concerning.
Sorry Babish but you missed a key ingredient You needed to spread a whole stick of butter on the flattened dough before you covered it in sugar. Trust me, I worked at Cinnabon for a couple of years.
Who else likes ikea cinnamon buns?
Thank you I've been craving cinnamon rolls
5:19 Jesus fucking Christ I just want to dive in there and build a shelter and have a family and kids and a happy life forever. Thank you
Too creamy - adds more cream
babish kinda reaching these days
Try going for the Swedish original: Butter the spread dough before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar mix, and instead of frosting sprinkle with granulated sugar. Also, crowd them even less - don't let them touch at all.
make foods from trailer park boys, to celebrate legalisation in canada
I've never not laughed harder than at that opening scene.
The frosting is a little TOO creamy, so let's add some cream. ??
That’s sweet that you learned from your mistakes, thank you!! Also, can you make a video on tempering chocolate? I’m trying to make some decorations for a birthday. Any help is appreciated! ??
"Once you've got to know your rolling pin" ??
Ahum better call Saul?
I love how the mixing bowl changes from the metal bowl into the glass bowl in the blink of an eye:) Hey,isn't saccharine bad for your health?
Ill take all of them thanks
Have you made any vegan/vegetarian dishes before? I think that’d be pretty cool to see.
Am I the only millennial who knows who this amazing man whom we call Jim is?
Try Swedish cinnamon rolls, it's very similar but add cardamom in the dough (instead of lemon zest), mix the sugar and a lot of cinnamon with butter and spread that instead of sprinkle it on the dough. Brush them with egg instead of butter and sprinkle sugar nibs on them (no frosting). ??
thank you america for making it impossible to recreate any of your recipes. seriously who measures things in ounces?
When i saw the cinnamon rolls, i thought they were from Better Call Saul. Let's just say that so you don't have to make a video on them again
Please make the cup of joe from the polar express
Next should be Lembas Bread from Lord of the Rings
"This frosting is a bit too creamy." adds heavy cream
HOT TAKE!!!! I LOVE THE CLEAR BOWL!!!.... Being able to see what is happening in the bowl really give me a better idea of what im looking for!! Not sure if you just got the bowl or I just noticed it but well done my friend!!
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" lmao
the fact that you put in your mistakes makes me think you dont actually make many in the other videos. I sometimes add too much milk to my bowl of cereal
Let me guess someone stole your cinnamon roll?
Do this more often. Show us your process and how many times it took you cooking the same meal to get it right.
How about secret life of Walter Mitty? There's cinnabon there
This looks awesome. I just can't get the logistics right on when I should start this in time for breakfast. Way early one morning? Or let it ferment overnight?
Would love to see you do a Collaboration with Mike Chen from Strictly Dumpling on different Chinese Food, since you both live in NYC ??
I love that you make the occasional mistake. Gives an amateur like me some hope.
“Pull them apart as god intended” lolol

Make food from Red Dwarf!
I wanna see exclusive episodes!!! But I'm broke af!
My mom made the best cinnamon rolls. I really miss my mom. ??
You need to butter the inside before adding the spice mix, it helps the sugars caramelize and be extra gooey. Soak large golden raisins in a dark spicy rum, the longer the better, we usually go at least a year. Include those in the middle too, they become pockets of caramelized rum.
"Too creamy. Lets add cream" lol
Can you make a hot pocket out of cinnamon rolls? audible gasp Death pocket
DIDN'T sit in it, not legit
“ but if you ask me, a little too creamy” adds heavy cream
Your solo vids sound way happier than your sponsored ones btw
Thought it was cheese in the Thumpnail
This is so wierd. This is not at all how we do them in Sweden.
too creamy, let me just add some cream
Another great vid dude! Really enjoy your channel!
Could you do a Naruto episode please.
Brisket please (young Sheldon works)
Oh No! Andrew, I get the Monetization, of course, have the adverts pay you. I get the Patreon, let your loyal followers create your salary, all while absolutely having access to your episodes earlier than everyone else. BUT PLEASE don't start creating content on YouTube that I can only see if I pay a monthly subscription for your channel. 4.99 is a lot for just one channel when ALL of netflix is 7.99. I can't afford it as much as I think you deserve it. Why sell out on this when you've already been able to profit off of Monetization, Patreon, and the Blue Apron Sponsorship? I won't stop loving your show! I'm just a little disappointed.
Funny enough I was like I really want some Cinnamon rolls and here this is....I'm being tempted
Cinibun from the secret life of Walter Mitty
I used to manage a cinnabon when I was younger those things are the most unhealthy things ever but God are they delicious
Yo babish! You should make the ultimate sandwich from Ninja Sex Partys song!
Can you do an Asian cuisine recipe with noodles, vegetables, and chicken. A side of homemade egg rolls ????????
We can never wash our hands from the mistakes we regret, only clean them to prevent more getting on them

This taught me that pretty is not necessary to be good. Be proud of your mistakes.
Cotton Candy Brandy From Big Mouth
Make blank sandwiches from bone
You pronounce the T in 'Soften' and it bothers me way more than it should
“An excuse to make cinnamon rolls”? That offends me my good sir, there is no such thing as an excuse to make cinnamon buns, you make it because you want sweet, doughy, gooey delicious goodness
Could you brush the rolls with egg wash before baking instead of just butter?
So far your the only one giving special content like episodes to your members thats just mean to us with lesser money to not see your great cooking. That hurts since as far as i see your my only sub on youtube whos doing it like this.
"A little bit too creamy" "Gonna thin this out with some cream"
try them with sourdough starter!
Hey you should do a Wok special showing/celebrating the diversity of what can be cooked in wok as well as the special flavors and styles only a wok can produce! I guess that would be more of a basics with babish episode
get to know your rolling pin ;)
You could have called this Cinnabuns from Daddy’s Home ^^the breakfast scene
Could you do garlic bread from Scott pilgrim vs the world
I've never been a patreon before but Babish makes me want to.
I had a dream where this was called binging with barrack and it was great
Honestly those ‘wrongly’ made cinnamon buns weren’t all that bad. I’d enjoyably consume them ??
Gotta unsubscribe, sorry Babish. I don't like that I have to watch ads, sponsorship messages and now I miss episodes if I don't pay extra. Best of luck to you.
"it's a little bit too creamy" .. **adds more cream**
I would love to Join your channel or support you on Patreon, but I am sadly poor. Any chance of releasing the "exclusive" content at a later time, like say six months after Patreon/Youtube subscribers get access? I try to support the channel with my Twitch Prime every month, I figure it's the least I can do, because you're one of my favorite content creators on YouTube. I say "one of" because you and FoodBusker are the only two channels I watch religiously (and god help me if you two ever get together for a collab)
How bout the Ed sauce from Good Burger

Can you make a really big cinnamon roll like a giant single lol
Please make Bill Gannon's barbecue sauce from Dragnet!
To make Cinnabon style you needed to roll that dough out to 14x28. Paper thin. That is how you get so many layers like they do.
This is the first time I've seen (or can remember) Babish advertise himself. More power to you, it's much deserved.
i'm pretty sure someone probably said this but I think the ultimate challenge for Babish to make is the edible strings from Mouse Trap.
Hey Babish! Love your stuff, got me in the Kitchen! Any chance you could make space food or have a space theme from Apollo 13, the Martian, etc? Would be awesome!
A little too creamy LETS ADD SOME CREAME

Thought this might been a basics with banish vid lol.

No mistakes, just happy accidents.

I like Louis C.K.’s standup on cinnamon rolls/Cinnabon better but I can see why you used Jim Gaffigan instead.

Just a small tips, when i make thr norwegian similar thing (shilling buns) we make a cinnemon and suggar cream out out of butter, sugar and cinnemon and it makes it all a bit more fluffy and all
That's not fair, hotpockets don't even cost 5$

Allison's sandwich from the breakfast club
How is that a little known fact. It's the most obvious thing ever. You can see that it has been rolled just by looking at it.
I really like the idea of leaving mistakes in. People like me (who don't do baking very much) would love to see things that can go wrong, because I probably would've done the same things.

So I know someone with a dairy allergy (like anaphylactic shock serious if they have butter/milk/cheese), how would this work with margarine for the rolls and instead of a cream cheese icing making meringue and glazing it over about midway through cooking?
As a Halloween special or something..It would be awesome if you made some of the outrageous meals described in American Psycho.. ??
fuck mE UPPPPPP
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
WHY FROSTING ON THE CINNAMONBUN??!!
They look a little dry compared to cinnabon, don't they?
dangerous path that extra stuff, Babish. So long as you don't neglect to make a vid when you usually would for your regular subscribers I don't see any harm though.
Quit pronouncing the T in soften. You sound retarded.
Another thing you should have done is put butter inside lf them helps them unroll and they are just so much tastier
make something from food wars please god
Oh man... I want those hot pockets... They look delicious

WHAT THE FUCK I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK FOR THIS
Finally! Someone else uses a serated knife to cut cinnamon rolls! I like the idea of oiling the work surface and the rolling pin! I'll definitely give that a try when I make my caramel pecan cinnamon rolls next! Thanks for the video ????
When you were oiling the rolling pin, I could hear Cocktail Chemistry making his classic, "Shaking the shaker in a non suggestive manner" joke.
Hey um do the ribs from Norbit at the wedding scene
Is using the mixer essential or can i do this by hand???
sorry, a swed cant accept the way you guys make a cinnamon bun
Liked before watching because cinnaman roll
You need to spread soft butter before cinnamon and sugar! At least thats what we do in Finland, the home of cinnamon rolls ;) you can never have too much butter or sugar
Mmmmh kanelsnegl ??
I thought your first mistake was rolling the dough with cinnamon and sugar. Usually when I see cinnamon rolls made, it's more of a cinnamon paste rather than just the cinnamon sugar. But hey, it's your recipe.
Hey guys! Ever cook the pre-made Pillsbury cinnamon rolls? Hack: Use a muffin sheet if you want them individually cooked to perfection.

I need more Babish in my life??
I don't want you to do this. Don't make bonus episodes just for people that pay. You're not gonna make enough from this. It'll effect your upload time and your community. Trust me. It's not a good idea, you have enough money from Patreon and YouTube.
Sweet role from Skyrim next
Was that clip supposed to be funny at the beginning?
"Screwed up royally" = rolls were uneven and didnt frost fast enough
i like to think that this is an episode on better call saul
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!
Not from better call saul?
You can honestly just use powderd suggar and water for the frosting Tastes better in my opinion
@binging with babishyou should make cinnabon delights from taco bell
Mixture too creamy ? No problem, just add more cream !
You know, this idea of "I'll show you where I messed up so you don't repeat my mistakes" thing was a great touch. Shows you're not infallible and helps us avoid those same mistakes at the same time.
oh now you’ve done it
On what number should you set the mixer to

"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." X'D i died.
2:17 lmao
You actually made 4 mistakes. For true soft and circular rolls use was free or very light waxed floss to cut the roll. Try it. My mom uses this technique when she makes cinnamon rolls and it will up your presentation by four levels guaranteed.
Great Job Babish!!!! They look fantastic! I challenge you to make them gluten free, my wife has celiac and can't eat your standard buns!!!
RIP - can you do a bonus recipe for an alternative frosting that has no cream cheese? Vanilla or another variant would be dope.
Aaw, I would’ve liked to see homemade hot pockets.
Can u put that intro song in again!!!
First mistake is just how we used to make ours growing up. Nostalgic.exe
Hey Babs! I love your videos. You should consider doing the food platter shown in Monster Hunter World. I'd love to see that feast come to life!
So now google/youtube doesn't pay you and we directly have to? This has become a lot worse than TV Cable subscription. I could get 2 channels for that price with 24 hr entertainment.
Better Call Saul Cinnabons
Okay, here a little bit of feedback: 1. I love that you put in the mistakes you made, it really shows a little bit more behind the thought process and entices you to experiment yourself. Maybe you can make a future episode, which shows the process of coming up with a recipe. 2. I kind of dislike the idea of the exclusive babish episodes. I myself am a patreon, so this doesn't apply to me, but I feel like the great and active members of the community get kicked out a little bit, if they can't afford to support monetarily. My feeling is, that this is a bit different from additional videos like Behind the Scenes or QnA. I dunno, I really would have liked to have all the content for everybody, I don't mind paying for people who can't. That's the end of my feedback, hope you're doing great =D EDIT: Wow, so many people take this to heart, really cool to see a relaxed and respectful discussion. To you Andrew, don't think I am mad, I don't think of you as a greedy person or something like that, it is only my own feeling of leaving some people behind. I can totally understand, that increasing the patreon incentive is a smart thing to do and probably YouTube requires some exclusive stuff, to be able to enable channel memberships. So whether you decide to stay at what you said, special episode for patreons and channel members, you decide to release them for everybody or you decide to release them to the public after 2 weeks or so, I stand behind you because I know that you are just a guy who is passionate for cooking and that is why I subscribed to you.
good video babbi!
louis ck's cinnabon bit was better but i get you can't use that
I've been watching your channel for a long time. I pay for some single serving content, but I think asking for 5 dollars a month to get exclusive episodes is crossing a line. I enjoy your videos, and watch ads. I'm slightly disappointed in this decision. Thanks for making great videos Babish.
The entire point of YouTube is that it’s free
Babish, what's makes cooking fun? Just wondering
When life gives you lemons, fuck up cinammon roles with it. Lel just an opinion
Mmm cinnamon bun my favorite after chocolate cake but before tres leches cake ????????????
Americans put cheese on everything... surprised it's not deep fried after baking.
As GOD intended lmaoo
babish is basic babish is binging
i think that was THE single most unfunny comedy routine i have ever seen.
For Cinnabon you need to use indonesian korintje cinnamon
Mmmmmmmm I sure love me some synonym rolls
2:14 ????
Needs more cinnamon.
Looks so good??
2:15 ??????

“We can pull them apart as god intended” I’M DEAD
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ????
I like when they grow into each other. it makes it more chewey than crispy.
I think my family are the only people who use dental floss to cut our cinnamon rolls...it baffles me, it's way better than a knife.
@babish you should of used a cinnamon sugar butter instead of sprinkling sugar cinnamon. It helps by adding more moisture to the rolls.
Im seeing all these new uploads but i still havent seen a proper naco video yet. Hmmm.
hmmm, a little too creamy. Better add some cream.
2:17 i see what you did there babby
Not as good as kanelbullar
Watching this at 12:45 AM. SO JEALOUS ????
How about making some of the mediocre-1970s English dishes from Fawlty Towers??
you should of used a clip from better call saul when he is working at the cinnabon
I know its cinnamon bun, but I miss going to the mall as a kid and watching people make pretzels.
You could have used Better Call Saul as your excuse. They even have a montage of him making the actual Cinnabons.
PLEASE MAKE A MCCHICKEN
Regular shows double glazed apple fritters

You’re icing is too thick. Why did it stay so opaque, it looked a little gross.
I told myself before i clicked on the video “i bet he’s using this as an excuse to make cinnamon rolls” love it
Please make The Stinky Sandwich from Home Improvement!
Taako's 30 glove garlic chicken form the Adventure Zone
I feel like you used to make more effort sourcing the best ingredients and making it very gourmet. Now you just make basic recipes with ordinary ingredients.
Excuse you, did you just pronounce the "t" in soften?
but...wait...WHERE. IS. THE. BUTTER???? Arent' they supposed to be slathered with butter before dusting with cinnamon (AND SUGAR!)? That's how we do it in Sweden at least.
What's the difference between oiling a work surface and flouring it
The day has come!!! Thanks Babish!!!
Swedish cinnamon buns are the best. way easier to make and way tastier. (not as sweet as this version) but to each their own. :)
Started my diet yesterday Babish releases this video SHIT
Anyone else think he made these mistakes on purpose in order to make a more in depth video? Also was having trouble sleeping last night so decided to get to know my rolling pin, slept like a baby after that.
I love when you include your mistakes because I guarantee I'd make them
2:20 why do you want it to not stick to nothing? surely you want it to stick to nothing or not stick to anything? basacly you want it to stick to everything so why add the oil?
what if i dont have one of those fancy dough machines
For some reason cream cheese frosting make me feel sick unless I think of it for carrot cake
Wonder if consciously excluded to add in the Louis ck cinnabon bit
I've never requested a dish before, but know I know what I want. Do the pineapple upside down cake from the Penguins of Madagascar cartoon series.??
4:10 says frosting is too creamy adds cream
was that stand up meant to be funny?
watching this while eating chick fil a.... heaven
He could have just said the Cinnamon Rolls were from Skyrim lol
Imma make a Izuku Midoriya
Do some of the dishes from popular anime, like Seven Deadly sins
Do Oliver's Monte Cristo from Arrow season 6 episode 3
*American cinnamon rolls.
No no no! You should butter the bun dough before sprinkling on the sugar and cinnamon! It not only helps to keep the cinnamon-sugar inside the rolled up dough, but makes the bun itself taste so much better! All and all there’s too little butter in this recipe. Adding butter will help the dough rise and makes it taste way better!
Could've used skyrim....
Can’t wait to make these
Babish YES! Please do more stand up related dishes.
Babish is cashing in. Good for you
How about a short series on homemade versions of Chinese takeout? Like crab rangoon, orange chicken, lo mein, etc.
Oh for christsake. 4.95 a month to watch you cook? I better get a frigging cinnamon roll sent to my house each month then
Who else would joyfully eat that "mistake batch"?
Good call not using Louis CK's stand up for cinnamon rolls.
Could you stop using retarded measures like ounces for the rest of the world please?
Theres a REALLY good Cinnabon clone recipe floating around. It is my favorite one. THe cinnamon filling is more of a shmear though so its nice and gooey when warm.
I'm gonna gesture toward these cinnamon sticks.
swedish cinnamonbuns are better
Nice to see some mistakes! Thanks for keeping them in.
Mistakes happen, and are always enjoyable. Thanks for sharing. Some orange zest in the frosting is also a good thing. Works for Rice Krispie treats too.
Can you do literally anything from Chowder
Worst. Comedian. Ever.
Cinnamon rolls with frosting? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
Too creamy... Add more cream
i just mase cinnamon buns in class yesterday way
God I love Jim Gaffigan, great to see some love for one of my favourite comedians
Ahhhhh!!! That looks so good!!!!
I haven't tried this recipe yet, but my mom does a few things a little differently so I thought I'll leave this here in case anyone wants to try it out: 1.) Butter the inside of your dough with melted butter before applying the sugar mixture. Don't use to much though or I guess they might come out greasy. 2.) Brush the top of your buns with eggwash or simply a beaten yolk instead of butter. 3.) I prefer powdered sugar on the buns instead of frosting them. The frosting is just too heavy and sweet for my taste. You could also try glazing them with a mix of powdered sugar and lemon juice, that's a popular option here in Germany. I don't have any measures, but just keep adding powdered sugar to your lemon juice and whisking it until you like the taste and have a smooth glaze. If you want more lemon flavor put some zest in aswell. And for some other variations you can put dried fruits or cocoa in the dough and use different fillings. Chopped nuts mixed with some sugar are great, or my personal favorite: a mix of poppy seeds, some milk and sugar.
What is the wrap on the bowls?
Why does americans cover their cinnamon buns in glaze?? I've never understood that
Kingpin's omelette from Daredevil please.
Why you gotta do me with missing out on content jsut because I cant afford to fund you? As a University student I apprecate it when channles do this but dont make people who cant pay miss out on stuff. I mean its your chanel do what you want but now im a bit dissapointed
I adore your channel, especially since I'm in Culinary Arts school, and your tips are really helpful. ??
Where can I find that weird matte wrap? I've never seen it before

PAPA BABISH YOUVE NEVER MADE A CHEESECAKE
Speaking of acknowledging and improving upon your mistakes, you gonna redo the Naco video soon or what?
fuck you and your membership you greedy pig, yo already have advert friendly content and a patreon. YOU HAVE 3 MILLION SUBS seriously this membership thing is stupid and over-priced. I'm not spending 5 dollars every month for exclusive tiny pics of your face your douchebag. you have time for extra videos? why not give back extra content to your regular fan base? oh wait no you could charge hella money for that so noooo you have a drug problem or something? why do you need a patreon, channel memberships, and a massive income from your regular programming? how much money can a pig have?
Didn’t even watch the video, just came to say that cinnamon rolls are my favorite food
When I try to recreate a Binging with Babish recipe, my family thinks I'm crazy, because I'm doing everything to an imaginary audience

This is how I want to die. Those cinnamon rolls look amazing but I'm allergic to cinnamon :(

I was just gonna make some yesterday but I didn't find a good recipe but now I can use yours!
I tried making Chocolate Chip cookies a couple weeks ago. But I forgot to add eggs so my batter was very dry. Butt I ended up making some pretty good Chocolate chip short bread cookies with what I had
should've done cinnamon rolls from better call saul
I don't care if any movie or series featured the food you make. As long as you keep cooking and baking I'm fine.
You should have won the Streamy

Make the cake that hagrid made Harry Potter in the sorcerers stone!
too much bad good wowe
I love cinnamon buns. However, I would really really recommend adding heavy cream instead of butter brushed to the top before baking. It makes them extremely soft and more similar to that mall place that is known for selling buns.
For a swedish take on the classic cinnamon roll: mix cinnamon and sugar with room temperatured butter, spread out evenly before rolling up the dough. make's the roll much more moist and tasty. Don't line up in a deep dish, put them spaced out on lined baking tray. Wipe down with melted butter och one beaten egg, cover in decor sugar (is that what it's called?) Don't wait until cooled down from the oven, consume way to many, feel stuffed but know that it's worth it.
Plz make food
hey how about making the Nobby Buns and the Brownie topping recipes from the end credits of the film , Hot Shots?
"Too creamy" then proceeds to add heavy cream
Question, am I the only one that thought the mistake was NOT putting a layer of butter on the dough before the cinnamon sugar mix? Or is that a southern thing? I mean I come from a long line of southern big mammas, and heaven forbid you not put butter in that dough!
Can you now make the Cinnamon Rolls (Cinnabon) from Louis CK's Stand up? Just to see the difference.
Make a Brioche!
Chai Jin from Jade Empire, wimp.
You should try to make pepper buns from food wars!!!
You should make Mrs. Lovetts Meat Pies from the movie "Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" since its almost Halloween!
Babish's frosting was too creamy, so he added more cream to make it less creamy. SCIENCE.
Can we get Big Smoke’s entire order from GTA San Andreas?
It’s official. I love you.
You need to make the Snatcher Neo Kobe pizza
I must really love your channel because I hate cinnamon and still watched this. What would you suggested if I wanted to change the cinnamon for another ingredient?

They are also very much in Better Call Saul! So no excuse needed, go ahead and feel just fine about these appropriate amounts of calories!
well done. i'm glad you caught your mistakes and fixed them. i was definitely cringing when i saw you making those mistakes... i find, you don't really need to thin out the cream cheese icing if you ice right away after the buns come out of the oven... the residual heat immediately softens and melts the cream cheese icing...
Please do Wilson's egg breakfast from latest Daredevil Season 3
Fy faen they look good but I prefer Swedish style with pärlsocker instead of icing.
Please can you make spaghetti tacos from iCarly
So what about bubbas shrimp pt 2
Yum!
I really appreciate you putting your failed attempt in this video as a method for teaching! As a viewer I think sometimes I forget that creators may attempt something several times before perfecting what they're making, and it can frustrate me if something doesn't turn out perfect on the first try. Thanks for keeping it real and reminding us that cooking can be trial and error :)
Kung fu panda? The feast from the first Pirates of the Caribbean. That’s all I got
babish is running out of ideas
If you add melted butter to the cinnamon sugar and spread it into the dough it makes it ten times better.

I hope you will do iZombie! lots of great food porn on there.

Make cookies like squidwards mom used to make
I work at a cinnabon, those buns are between the size of a mini and a classic size, we actually cut and frost them right when they come out of the oven (which you frosted but didn't cut them), we have a metal spatula that is serrated on one side so when we cut them we aren't pinching them, plus we are told that when we roll them that the swirl must have at least wrap around 5-6 times, and we don't use oil when rolling the dough we use flour, idk if you want any of this info, I know from the standup he specifically said cinnabon, but those cinnamon rolls look 100000% better than the ones we make at work and I'm gonna use that recipe sometime
"once you've..... gotten to know your rolling pin,"
:Hears the "t" pronounced in "softens" and questions his entire life...

I love your channel! I'm definitely going to try these cinnamon rolls out. Could you please do a Bojack Horseman special? :)
Eggnog from Krampus for Christmas special
Cutting the dough with a knife misshaped the buns! Cut them by wrapping them with twine and pulling the ends quickly
Please always do it like this when you screw up. But yeah, 5 bucks a month ain't happening. You're cool but you're not as useful as Spotify.
Maybe you should do some more food wars, the last one was amazing
Listen Bab, I love ya and your recipes, but you need to put butter inside of the cinnamon rolls. You can’t just sprinkle some loose cinnamon sugar onto the dough! You need either lather that dough in some butter (melted or soft works) and then sprinkle OR mix the soft butter right into the cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon paste.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that good ole Babby completely screwed up the Naco
So who actually prefers a cinnamon bun over a stickey bun?
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin.” ??????
Why do you not give a fuck about the audience using real units?
I LOVE Jim Gaffigan!
Why didn't you spread butter on the dough and then sprinkle the sugar? Why was there no butter in the filling? Why don't I have one of these buns in my hand right now?
Can you make secret ingredient soup and dumplings from Kung fu panda? ?? ?? ??

Imma need you to make the duck and peanut butter soup from American Psycho
"hi guys, essentially you're gonna see me screw up the recipe and make it again" video still isn't ten minutes long you quality content creator you :3
Noooo this is stereotypical rolls. You need to make it special with a real recipe! I'll send you a REAL cinnamon roll recipe!
What shrink wrap did you use to over the dough and later the first batch of rolls? just curious by the shape it takes. thanks
I want to get to know my rolling pin better too hehe
A time lapse of the dough growing would a be cool for future episodes
Now a premium membership does sound nice. I'm happy to see you're doing great man.
I was thinking about those Hot Pockets while watching the video. Got a neat surprise seeing them at the end of the video. Jim Gaffigan would be so pleased.
Brb, I forgot to philosophically wash my hands
Cool now make pringles in a can from Bo Burnham's Make Happy
Mmm synonym roles, just like Grammar used to make
Hey babish, this might seem like a dull idea but it's been something I've wanted since 2005 and they discontinued the product in the UK but is there any chance you can see about making turkey twizzlers? they were a favourite during my childhood and if there is a way to recreate them I'd love to try it.
You should try the Cherry Glazed Rack of Lamb from "How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days"!
I am so freaking happy you did an episode on cinnamon rolls!!! Since they are my all time favourite food! You know you could have also picked Better call Saul since he's a manager in a Cinnabon.
Please try to collab with Alton Brown! You guys are my two favorite food people!
Can you try to find a dish from dragon ball z for thanks giving
You should make Chidi's Peeps and Chilli from The Good Place
Uh mistake number 1 was not putting butter before rolling. Wtf
Here is where you messed up. You have to add small pads of butter evenly distributed along with the cinnamon sugar mixture then roll it up and proceed as normal. As the rolls cook the butter melts and mixes with the cinnamon and sugar and creates a candy caramel coating that flows to the bottom of the buns and makes them Elevate to a whole new level.
and im back as a subscriber no cheesy commercial :D this is the banging with babish i love to watch <3
Please do food from skyrim or fallout. Sweet rolls and sugar bombs :P
I get you want to make a living out of youtube and i still will watch all of your vids and i still love your channel but making me miss out on hot pockets God damn
Please do the feast from "Fantastic Mr. Fox" or another Wes Anderson movie
Make the cheesesteaks from Creed!!!
or go buy one at cinnabon
As a swede these buns/rolls dissapoint me, but its Babish so its okay.
Mistake number two was still followed, try making them on a sheet without them touching. Also you should make monkey bread (any flavor) I think with help it’d join the clean plate club
So you made finnish bostoninkakku minus the frosting
If you could make the turtle or dragon bread from the 17th episode of Yakitate Japan that would be impressive.
Watching this makes me hungry for cinnamon rolls. Also, apparently, my cat loves to watch your videos and loves your voice o.O
Slightly disappointed that it wasn't bean bagchair sized. 8/10
Way to little cinnamon in that mixture might as well call it brown sugar roll! Swedish cinnamon buns are way better ??
This is not how me make them in Sweden ??
I have watched your ENTIRE channel in like 3 days. You are incredible ????????
I messed up the first cinnamon rolls royally *proceeds to make perfectly delicious and beautiful cinnamon rolls"

I might be late for the trend. But better late than never right? How about babish do a take on big smoke's order from GTA san Andreas?
ICARLY SPEGETTI TACOS?!?!
Babby you made content exclusive with a pay wall. That defeats the point of YouTube come on now. It's okay though because you make an effort to put out public videos frequently so it's no Biggie. Please don't make all your content behind a paywall in the future though
You should do Chicken Pinciotti from That 70’s Show.
I thought with cinnamon rolls you're supposed to cut them with an unflavored floss or string since a knife would make the dough in the spirals stick together
Mario Batali vs Wolfgang puck in the cooking war of the century order for eight easy payments of I don't know what I'm doing
Nitpicking with Babish.
These Memberships really do me in... if every channel does them and you want to see this extra content, you will spend a fortune when you pay 5 $ a month for each channel you like and want to be able to see this stuff. I really don‘t understand this anymore - YT was for free and now we have Premium Memberships that also costs monthly... that all just ain‘t fun anymore in my book. Love BwB but I feel like paying for cable TV these days here on YT.
@Binging With Babish, if you were to spread making these starting night before, could you do first proof overnight in fridge, then simply roll, cut, and final proof in morning?
Jim Gaffigan: same theme but still pretty funny. Is it because of his voice?

How are you going to describe them as saccharine sweet when you made them with sugar?
you should do the little purple candys from jimmy neutron !!
Little fun fact, your cinnamon babka recipe makes great cinnamon rolls too.
The good place chidi Do his chilly it is in one of the 1st 3 episodes on season 3 it is on netflix
We used to put the in aluminum muffin tins at work, paint them with butter, then wrap and freeze. Then as we needed them we could pop out a tin, chuck it in the proofer, and then bake them off for the best cinnamon bun french toast you could ever imagine!
Absolutely loved seeing the mistakes on this. They taught me so much and I am sure not thinks less your skill and the entertainment of your videos. Great job and thank you so much.
Man, I have had cinnamon buns on my mind. There is this place I go that makes cinnamon twists and I can’t figure out how they make the twist.
im gay
Babish is on a roll
I don't like American cinnamon buns. Frosting should not be there it just overpowers everything else and just makes it taste like sugar. I like the swedish ones
Too creamy? Add cream!
My god its magnificent
Should have referenced Louis Ck's arriving at the airport bit about cinabon!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin," Subtle.
Can you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil?
bab ish
I used to work a Cinnabon. Not a perfect recreation but still looks good. You missed the crucial step of buttering the dough before spreading the cinnamon and sugar mixture. I guess the melted butter step kind of replaces that. Rolling away from you looks awkward, we we're all trained to roll toward us.
Is that reusable plastic wrap?
4:10 cooking just makes so much sence the stuff is too creamy so what do you do add cream genious also really cinnamon rolls ( imade them with my mum following this video :ok hand:)
hotpockets!
Poffins from Pokemon Platinum!
4:10 Too creamy? ADD MORE CREAM
Make some dishes from naruto like the ramen
I hate to tell you Babish, but you used the wrong recipe this time. The only cinnamon bun recipe worthy of being present amongst a table of gods is the cinnabon clone recipe on google. It is fluffy and moist and springy in ways the human mouth does not fully appreciate until you bite into one of these bad boys. Its also the first recipe I actually changed and didn't completely destroy. It calls for 600g strong bread flour but if you use 400g only and another 200g of fine sponge cake flour the dough is even more bubbly and delectable. You definitely need to try this.
I could go for some of those Hooooot Pooockeeeeets.
Where's Bubba shrimp part 2?
Make some pumpkin pie
If you rowl the buns tither, they will come out even nicer
Am I missing out? I've never seen a glass bowl on a stand mixer.
americans always ruin things
This looks great, but i thought the point was to attempt to make The Cinnabon? The ones you made are tiny. A true Cinnabon should be huge! It should make you question your life's decisions. A true Cinnabon is what the great comedian and pervert Louis C.K. called a "fat fuck treat". The ones you made look far too healthy. Perhaps change the title of the video to "Healthier Cinnamon Rolls"
I made some cinnamon rolls a while back for a project and made the EXACT same mistakes you did. Thanks for this video!
Dang, I thought this was gonna be the size of a bean bag chair
Lol, Andrew apologising for screwing up the first batch like we wouldn't definitely go in on them anyway
Nice video as always! Could you do some foods from Tom and Jerry? For instance, the Bouillabaise in Jerry and the Goldfish.
The cinnamon rolls look delicious but what I really want to know is where I can get that sweet watch.
I guess every YouTube account has to change at some point. Sad to see this one do the same. Now we got to play for certain videos? You turned into one of those girls on tinder that has a premium Snapchat...
Make the pancakes John Candy made in Uncle Buck
What about the jimmy neutron purple flurp?
This channel members thing seems like abit of a YouTube after thought to compete with or At least merge patreon features. I follow four people who have it now and honestly $15 a month for YouTube videos and a sticker or two seems expensive.
Please the good place episode!
I wish i can grab those cinnamon rolls from my phone
I think Louis C.K. described Cinabunns much better, but I guess he's a non-grata still.
Babish has so many cute, random and downright hilarious quotes I'd wear on shirts Everything burrito: it's not the amount of meat, it's how you treat the meat Any video that includes Worcestershire sauce: a hilarious attempt in pronunciation This video: After you Physically and Philosophically wash your hands!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin," hahahahahaha
Reese's monkfish from Malcolm in the middle?
Holy shit, yes.
I’d love if you did some recipes from Stardew Valley!
I am sugar free for 3 years. I feel like this should be on PornHub
It always fascinates me how different American cinnamon rolls are from Swedish ones. I just don't get it. There are few things as good as a good, proper cinnamon bun, but to then make them all giant and baked together into a slab and slathered in painfully sweet frosting? Probably the biggest food related culture shock I've ever experienced tbh ??
Wow I don't have anything to make this
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” lol
Thats a nice wrist watch. +10 points
Hot Take: You could have picked a better comedian and a better show by making the Cinnabons from Better Call Saul. Bob Odenkirk is a national treasure.
'a little too creamy' Adds heavy cream
Yum yum Cinnabon ??
Spaghetti Tacos from ICarly. GO!
bro butter on frosting?? thats a no for me
Could have just done a basics on pastries instead of reaching like this
Get to know your rolling pin ( ?° ?? ?°)
That's not at all what I picture when I think cinnamon rolls/buns
Louis C.K. did a great take on that too in his standup. Since I watched it I cannot force myself to eat another one of those.
I've never seen someone make the filling with dry cinnamon and sugar, I've always done it and seen it by mixing the two powders with softened or melted butter. I'mma try the dry mix next time! Also! I might join just for the hot pockets episode!!
Make eye holes from rick and morty
You didn’t take a nap halfway through!!!

Why not making the cinnamon rolls from Better Call Saul????

I'd rather eat a pint of Ice Cream. Like a Man!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" Ahaha, nice try Babish. We all see what you did. Or... at least I did. Anyone else..... no? Ok den.
Two way that Andrew gets to excuse himself to make a thing: 1) Make a Basics episode out of it. 2) Use the smallest mention of it to make an episode.
Thanks to youtube demonetizing we have to pay to be able to view some content now
4:09 “A little bit too creamy...” “Let’s thin this out with a bit of heavy cream ”

Pastry is a cardinal sinnamon.
Love my boy Jim. Also PLEASE DO THE BENTO BOX FROM ISLE OF DOGS
Do you have a video breaking down the accessories you have on your mixer that I missed? From what I can tell, you're using a lot of the basics, but as I just got my wife a stand mixer recently, we've been tackling some of your dough recipes and would love some advice/tips on good things to have for it all.
You should make coconut Pete’s paella from broken lizard’s club dread
Your excuse should have been Better Call Saul

i was really hoping that this youtube membership thing wouldn't start the trend of creators having exclusive videos to those people who pay for it. but i guess it was only a matter of time before stupid shit like that happened.
Can you please narrate audio books?

"sofTen"
Can you post recipes in metric for the rest of the world?
Omg ... so delicious
Can you make Burple Nurples from Chowder?
You should make Chief Wiggum’s chili with the ‘merciless pepper of Quetzalacatenango’
I like how you admit to mistakes and then show how to correct them.
My buns are toasty from just watching this
Cover me with icing babish
You should have made it from better call saul
Emojis Babish? Emojis? Really?
I understand Youtube is going downhill and you need to do different things to get more revenue, but the day content goes behind a paywall is the day i shed a little tear.
Cinnamon buns is my kind of treat
Impressive, but can you make the ET Malt from the movie Paul?
Could you make pickle rick!!!!!!
What brand is that watch you’re wearing?
Do I have to use instant yeast? All I have on hand is pizza yeast.
alright guys lets be real how much ass do you think babish gets
Hey, this might be abit to ask for, and I don't think you'll read all the comments, but I'm finding these really hard to follow. And by this I mean all recipes because I'm Gluten Free. Celiac makes cooking really hard and I would love it if you could make some dough or break or cake that was gluten free. Thanks for the hours of delicious looking entertainment ??
I like to think of these from the Louis CK stand up (love gaffigan too) Gimme the jizz syrup!! ??
It'd be really cool if you did the spaghetti al nero di seppia from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency!
How do you philosophy wash your hands?
Use mineral oil! It helps with the sticky dough and its flavorless.
Jim Gaffigan is hilarious
I miss the times when I can still eat cinnamon rolls ??
Since the cinnamon bun originates from Sweden/Denmark, you should try the Scandinavian recipe! It's super simple, almost the same as you did. Add some ground cardamom to the cinnamon mixture (maybe half around 33/67 with cardamom/cinnamon). Then slice them a bit thinner, about 3/4 of the thickness you did. Then they need to be baked completely separated from each other, so they turn out as individual beautiful cinnamon buns. And final step: ABSOLUTELY NO FROSTING! That is blasphemy. But instead, before baking: brush them with some beaten egg and sprinkle on some pearl sugar/nib sugar and then bake. Voila, authentic Swedish cinnamon buns :)
Ok I think this stretching the theme of the show a bit. I think babish just really wanted to make cinnamon rolls
Hello, everyone, my grandmother and I put our hearts into making food videos. We joke around as well ;D The videos are really good! We would appreciate, if you check them! :)
@2:17 nice
Looks good but cannot measure up to a woman I know, she is from the south so maybe that’s why lol. Whenever she takes in orders it’s a minimum or 17 preorders. But yes I can see why they made it too the clean plate club, too many people don’t bake them right and they end up dry and crusty, yuck!
I'm drooling over my work desk??
In Sweden we actually have a thing where we overcrowded the cinnamon rolls on purpose to create kind of a cake and it's delicious. We also mix the sugar and cinnamon with butter.
Them buns are money, honey. Now, can we do dishes from say... i dunno....Teletubbies?
Hey I get that movies and tv shows and stuff are great inspiration for recipes...but haven't you ever wanted to know what a Sweet Roll from Skyrim tastes like?
I really appreciate showing the "failed" batch. Showing that everyone makes mistakes and cooking isn't a one-and-done deal helps build confidence in budding chefs.
You have to try a Franzbrötchen from Germany! it is the best cinamon rolle/bread you will ever try! :D
Absolutely love your channel. Happy being the free subscriber though.
those are some nice buns you have there
My icing is too creamy so I'm going to add... cream!
Oh you a freak freak Babish with them sexy cinnarolls ??
Who's just here to watch and not actually make these ????
Please do a ‘Chowder’ special
thank you
I don't even care, i will eat anything babish makes. I would marry this man.
Maybe do something KETO friendly? I really love all your episodes, I just can't eat them lol
I'm just glad you didn't sit on them without pants on.
You can just make a basics vid we dont care as long as we get a video
Paid channel membership. So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.
A lot of the time I see how you do things in proximity to how I stuff things up in the kitchen and this made me feel a lot better, thank you
Hoooooooooot pockeeeet
Lucky Bastard Roommates! "Hey Babbs, I think you can do better. Reshoot."
This thumbnail made my pants stiff and my stomach growl. ??
Watching this episode mad the following line pop into my head: "Let me guess, someone stole your Sweetroll...."
Can we get a trailer park boys episode
Add some lemon juice to your cream cheese icing it makes it way better
"gotten to know your rolling pin" ????
Can you do something from My Little Pony? Like a Cherrychanga, or Chimicherry, or ChimiCherryChanga!!!
TurBriskaFil from The Big Bang Theory
What brand of Cling Film does he use? that shit sticks to everything!
Rather Membershits than Blue Aproprobullshit
A special based on the food of the animated Miyazaki films would be pretty amazing!
Your first try, wansnt a mistake, in fact I think Its great for a group of People if served in slices, like a cake
Early
Could you maybe write down the recipe?i'd like to try those cinemon rolls but it is really annoying to look it up in the video:(
Omg, is that Tiny Whisk's long lost cousin Tiny Spatula? ... I just realised those would be dope rapper names.
Ive been waiting for this video for far too long.
The depth of field is WAAAY too narrow, I really like the look but it feels really weird when you are blurred aswell, i think just keeping the background in bokeh would look much better
no hot pockets?
Should've done Cinnamon Rolls from Better Call Saul ??
synonym rolls
Emoji story ??????????????????????????????????????????????
I was hoping they were from Better Call Saul
haha Louis CK also had a Cinnabun bit.
the wheat allergy inside me is crying
We want the intro back!
This is hilarious. I just woke up and popped open a store bought cinnamon roll can and then I saw this when I scrolled through my youtube feed.
Do an Apicicus recipe!
What happens when you run out of food to make off tv shows?
Random suggestion, do the bento box that kills the scientist from the movie Isle Of Dogs (anybody who has watched the movie knows what i mean)
Hey Babish, so my wife is allergic to eggs. What would be a good generic replacement ? I always get so sad when any desert recipe you make contains eggs ! Thanks in advance.
There needs to be a M*A*S*H episode. Can do Adam's Ribs, Spam Parmesan, Water Buffalo steak, and wash it all down with Swamp-style gin.
Yasss papi
BABS! What kind of watch it that?!
i mean you couldve used a scene with no context that just shows a cinnamon roll and i think we would have been fine with the vid
4:09 "Too creamy" proceeds to add more cream
Cream cheese?! CREAM CHEESE!!! SUMMON DAVID SEYMOUR.
Too Creamy??? Adds Cream
I wish you didn't make episodes membership exclusive :/
Louie CK's bit was funnier
Hey my man babish, i suffer from cronic insomnia and so for about three years i've been watchin your show instead of looking at the ceiling and despairing . You've been a massive help over the years. Any chance in one of your vids you could say "chris says hi elise." its your channel, you do you, but it'd trip my gf out and so i'd really dig it. Do you like black dynamite?
This guy is so unfunny "Hey I'm a fat dad who naps a lot" So hilarious -_-
I’m pretty sure you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon buns Ok i just checked the description and i was right
I prefer danish pastry
Could have used the clip from better call Saul!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." Yeah, Babish.. I caught that.
How do you wash dishes with sticky dough tho
Home brewing with Babish???
Could you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Netflix's Daredevil??
liked the mistakes in the vid.
Kinda sad, that you would make some videos exclusive for the members. Wouldnt it work quite well if you let the members watch the videos way earlier than your normal subscribers and then make them available to everyone a month or so later ?
I love fresh, out of the oven, sweet, sticky Cinnamon Buns that has sugar glazed all over it
FINALLY
Thank you. Now I want but don't wanna make.
If I tell you.. can you make the biriyani from Cheeni Kum? It's a bollywood movie btw..
Did you just pronounce the "t" in soften? 5:16 hehe "cooooooool whhhheeep"
Sorry babish. YSAC uploaded but I'm back
Please Make "TurTurkeyKey" from How I met Your Mother for your thanksgiving special
You should do a series of videos on school lunches. We used to have these Italian dunkers that you could probably perfect.
Better Call Saul
So, boys'n'gals, sit and enjoy a story of cinnamon roll (CR) heaven. Li'l old me, barely 23 years of age was taking a vacation in the states, driving up from Frisco to Seattle with my family. (I'm originally from Germany and have only heard of CR pureness at that point.) We stop at the tiniest private-owned gas station, go inside to pay for the gas. The owner's that big, beardy, tattooed dude who'd pass as an actor in Sons of Anarchy any day. He's got the usual assortment of snacks, hot dogs and this tray of cinnamon buns. I'm curious (and still hungry) and buy one of those. I go outside, take a bite, stop, take another bite and then turn around on my heels to buy two more of those for the others. Not only were they delicious, but the guy was very nice and happy too as I told them that they were awesome - he made them himself (or his wife did, something like that). We chatted for a while, I bought more of them for my family and then we drove off. I forgot his name and I'll probably never find that heavenly place again but thank you, unknown dude, for the best cinnamon rolls in my entire life. Keep doing gods work.
Wow. Jim Gaffigan’s Comedy is good for something I guess....
Will definitely be trying this next week
You mean your not going to to reap the rewards of ad revenue by making the failed attempt a second video?
From Fallout 3 ?!
I looked up to you man!
'this is too creamy, so im going to add cream' ???????????

God, making cinnamon rolls based on a cinnamon roll lover's description... I'm down
"Channel Membership is only available to..." Aaaa Babish I wanna joiiiin ?? also I've been craving cinnamon roll for months so this is like premonition to me
Was that comedian suppose to be funny?
Should have made the cinnamon roll from van wilder
Just had my first cinnamon roll today. They dont sell it here. Then yesterday just found a bakery that sells some.

Well Sunday night I really wanted to make cinnamon rolls.. now pops a new video from you on cinnamon rolls! I guess it's mandatory now ??
Dammit, & I just ate breakfast. Also, are we gonna get Shrimp Part 2 & are we gonna get some dishes from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
You should try to make and eat an Every Pizza Place Salad from Family Guy.

"Thin it a little with heavy cream." ??
Can you make Tsukune's Shantai Curry from Rosario Vampire?
I just can’t do CREAM CHEESE frosting on Cinnamon Roll, it feels like I’m trying to add a flavor that has no business being in a Cinnamon Roll. If it’s not a vanilla frosting from scratch, it’s just not worth it.
Do the lentil soup recipe hidden in Baby I’m Amazed at the end of Simpsons episode featuring Paul McCartney.
Wait how do I philosophically wash my hands

That clip at the beginning wasn’t even remotely funny.
Babs.....i literally screamed an orgasmic "YES!" when i seen the pull apart. Bravo good sir??????
Yeah, this is reminiscent of when I first made cinnamon rolls. Except I burned mine in the oven thinking they weren’t done enough. And I made them on a baking sheet rather than a pan.
Can you please make power puff girls?
please do the gum drop pizza from Aladdin!
"It's a little creamy so we're gonna add some cream to even that out."
As if you needed an excuse to make cinnamon rolls.
Cinnamon Jizz
Coulda gone with better call saul as your reference
i like bread
As a swede this makes me very uncomfortable. This is not how we do it. What is this? Dry yeast?Where's the butter on the inside?! THE FUCK IS A CREAM CHEESE FROSTING?! (admittedly this is probably an American cinnamonroll, which of course would be different than the Swedish one. I'm not even sure they're originally Swedish, but I'm gonna pretend that they are until someone tells me otherwise.)

Why do you keep using the unit ounces when referring to solids? My understanding is that ounce is a unit for liquids not solids, so saying ounce of butter just makes things for confusing for the international fan

I wonder what sorta stuff Babish could do from World of Warcraft. That game has so many recipes for food. He would need to fill in some of the blanks, but it could be awesome.

I never thoguht i would face palm myaelf while watching your vids but this time you had it coming with all of those rookie mistakes in the beginning
JOJO!!!
You should do a seres called blunders with babyish
Over here, we bake the buns on a large sheet, so they don't stick together. And we sprinkle the buns with pearl sugar or chopped nuts before baking, not tonnes of fat sugary frosting.
You should make the Paunch Burger dinner for breakfast burger combo. (Looks like an oversized triple bacon thickburger from Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr, a monstrous helping of chili cheese fries, and a regular size(128 oz) chocolate milkshake.
Let me Cinnamon your Rolls kids
Andrew, what kind of cling film are you using to cover your baking trays(and mixing bowls)?

Mr Babish how about of Benson's chili from regular show
On next episode from Hannibal
Ive never been so excited for a BwB. I love cinnamon rolls but its impossible to find good ones, let alone make them (for me at least)
Cream cheese frosting > all other kinds. Almost every cinnamon roll I have had has that terrible powdered sugar and a little water for icing, no where near as good.
Hey I just wanted to say thank you.. for bringing back my love of cooking. I'm proud to say that I am now back in the kitchen becaus I find it fun again. And not just to survive
This was THE Christmas breakfast for my family for many many years. I miss those days
”Once you’ve gotten to knowing your rolling pin...”
If you weren't such a coward, you could've made this into an episode on replicating Cinnabon's recipe.
5:25 Now THESE are what I call precious cinnamon rolls!
I wish he made more of a glaze instead of a frosting
I love making cinnamon buns all the time. Now the guy who first inspired me to cook has made them, I love it. Also the way he makes it is completely different to the way I do. I am so going to try it out and see how they compare.
Hot nut on a bread snake.
jim gaffigan is (in my opinion) one of the most underrated comedians out there. he is so funny in such a unique way and every time i watch his comedy specials i laugh until i cry basically. maybe next time you can try making a ? hooottt pocketttt ? :)
“This seems too creamy, let me add some heavy cream”
Can you make hot pockets next?
Hey Babish. I'm a long-time subscriber of your channel from Korea and I've noticed that you haven't done anything from my country. So, i was wondering if you would make an episode about the dumplings from "Old Boy"(the original one, of course). Thanks!
Cream cheese too creamy --> add cream ??
I feel old because this could have been from Mitch Hedberg's stand up.
Cool
Would you rather buns of steel or buns of cinnamon?
Jim Gaffigan lives in NYC. You could have had him on the show. You can make Hot Pockets with him.

Cinnamon rolls are precious and delicious. Like...sweet doughy gold. You NEED to drown it in icing though. If you don’t, you’re not eating it right.
Too creamy, let's add some more cream.
Home made hot pockets? Remove from box, throw directly in toilet. How hard is that?
He copied Louis CK
"too creamy, add more cream"
'In my opinion this is too creamy so i'm going to thin it out with cream'
4:10 Thins out mixture that is too creamy With heavy cream
I decide to make cinnamon scroll for the first time on Monday. They didn’t rise much were also quite hard on the outside and I also didn’t have enough icing sugar to make the glacé. But they still tasted okay
louis cks cinnamon rolls sounded tastier.

You are running out of ideas bud
THANK YOU for not deleting the failed footage, it helps new cooks more than you think!
The only mistake with first attempt was to cut it. It was nice cinnamon-rolls-cake...
I would suggest more cold rise on these. The best cinnamon rolls have a lot in common with beer than bread. I enjoy Alton Brown's recipe, but I think Betty Crocker cookbook and several others have this method as well which is far superior in my book to these quick rolls
Can you make Mom’s Spaghetti from 8 Mile?

How the hell didn't you use Better Call Saul for this. HOW????!!
You should just make "Kanelsnegle" they are very similar, but not quiiiite the same. (A danish "Cinnamon roll")
Hey babish love the vid. I do have a neat little accompaniment to your cinnamon gooey roll of yummness. My wife makes the best cinnamon rolls...I dont care who here argues it. My wife is the Angelina Jolie...of the cinnamon roll-y. Anyways chef John joke aside. She uses maple syrup to sweeten the batter and coffee in the cream cheese frosting. I have never wanted to cry just thinking about them...now I need her to go make me some.
d'egg
Make Cucumber Sandwiches and/or Peppermint Iced Tea from Hilda!
I feel like mistake number 1 was not using a butter and cinnamon sugar mixture. Creating a paste, or buttering the dough and sprinkling with the cinnamon sugar.
Make Stupendous Stew from Super Mario Odyssey!
How does this dude not get fat
If you want more cinnabun style buns whip your butter and sugar and cinnamon together as a paste and then spread it super thin and sprinkle with more cinnamon
Do a fallout special: sweet rolls, iguana bits(?), Sunset sasparilla, sugar bombs etc
Make the 3 course meal chewing gum from Willy Wonka! And then make the lemonade that makes you float. :D

I thought mistake number one was going to be using a dry filling..... Babby. Wet cinnamon filling.
In honor of the 25th anniversary, may I suggest a Jurassic Park special? Chilean Sea Bass (or anything simmalr people who don't own dinosaur parks can afford) Ginger Ice Cream Green Jello

Babish is a beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too pure
Danes here are shook
Surprised it wasn’t cinnamon rolls from Cinnabon from Better Call Saul.

Jim gaffigan is one of the best comedians. I love his show and I respect how much of a gentleman he truly is when his wife got terrible sick and he took care of her. That is relationship goals.
Hey governor cheerio
Never watch BWB while hungry, never watch BWB while hungry, NEVER WATCH BWB WHILE HUNGRY
Nice to know everyone screws up sometimes. Muffin trays work great for baking cinnamon rolls.
Still waiting on cherry pie from Twin Peaks...
It's too creamy... add cream.
These look horrible !
I prefer Louis CK’s version of Cinnabon....)
Watched "This is not what I expected" the other day. Lots of good looking food, in what I can only describe as a Chinese screw ball comedy
Babish, I'm trying to renovate my kitchen, and I was hoping to install a good solid work surface for cutting, kneading, just generally working on stuff before cooking properly--but all the kitchen outlets I've been to keep telling me that such a thing isn't worth doing and that I should always use a cutting board/surface protector? Could you tell me how you do it/what it is, or is it just a case of "whatever, don't care, I'm going to be getting a lot of use out of this and if it gets ruined, I'll replace it?"
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns? Love the fail footage to show us how the recipe is developed; we've been trying that ourselves.
Going home and trying to make these now
Indeed God never intended for cinnamon rolls to be cut??
??
You could of said it was from the Secret life of Walter Mitty
Do anime now
This could've been from Better Call Saul.
I really like this format! I love it when people include their mistakes and this recipe sounds delicious.
This is why I prefer baking caramel rolls, you pour the caramel in the baking pan first and then flip the whole thing over once baked. Simple easy and efficient
I wish every episode was 30 minutes long
You know what? I'll take it because I want to make cinnamon rolls too.
Andrew!! I think it would be amazing if you did a react video to some of the videos on You Suck At Cooking's channel!! His videos are pretty funny and random, with some cooking thrown in. ????
Mistakes or not to be honest they looked fantastic either way kinda like that very home made look and texture
Hey Babi, try the argentine dish 'milanesas con puré' from the argentine movie 'El Angel'
"Sweet Bread A La Gusteau (good and bad version)" from Ratitouille
so can i point out we were a few episodes into season 2. then this episode is season 1.
Lost opportunity to gesture towards a giant bowl of sugary cinnamon roll goo. Could you please do your own take on the Fiesta Burrito with Chili and Eggs that Dan Aykroyd makes for Robert Stack in the food truck scene from Caddyshack 2?

Oh man the way you worked that rolling pin turned me on a little Also you should do a LoTR themed episode with rabbit stew, lembas bread, and a huge second breakfast full of all hobbit foods.
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
I make cinnamon rolls all the time but I can never get the frosting right. Thank you for the recipe. I’m gonna try it!
My friend. My family makes dozens of large cinnamon rolls every Christmas as gifts. Do yourself a favor, before adding the Cinnamon Sugar, do a thin coating of room temperature butter to the dough. Trust me, it's butter... I mean... better!
You should make the ink spaghetti from Jojo’s bizarre adventure
Can he just he picked up by Netflix or something major? He fucking deserves it! Imagine him and Alton Brown cooking together!
You don't need any excuses to make cinnamon rolls.
improvement! using a glass bowl to be able to see the process!
I think Cream Cheese frosting on cinnamon rolls is blegh, but i’d still eat urs babs. Also you should do food from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
Hey Babish, will you post the homemade hot pockets on YouTube as well? Doesn't seem fair for us guys who can't afford to spend 5 dollars a month
"Getting to know your rolling pin" bit got me haha
Is that a new apron?
A bit too much frosting for my taste
What's the stuff being used to cover the rolls while they proof?
hoooooot pocket.
Oh hey Babi got himself a new shallow dof bokehlicious lens!
I prefer Louie's description but Jim's is good too
I'm just saying Babish Food Wars is a treasure trove of content for you. Also they did an episode with bear meat which would be super interesting to see you cook.
“I screwed up royally” still makes a great cinnamon roll that’s like an A- instead of an A+
I need these now
U should recreate Walnut Date Loaf from Captain America Civil War
Make "sandwiches" from How I Met Your Mother
I like your new watch Andrew.
I'm allergic to cinamon, so how could i make these without cinamon? Please tell me
bitch those look so tasty
Can you make your old intro into the vid back?

"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."
Paul Walker’s tuna no crust plssss

awwww lol love this channel so much
( DRAMATIC MUSIC KICKS IN ) THE TIME HAS COME MY FELLOW CINNAMON BUN(or rolls) LOVERS
I’m watching this while walking to my 0 period
Mistake #4: sugar and cinnamon are to be mixed with room temp butter and then spread on the dough not sprinkled. Plus a good helping of roughly ground cardamom in the dough gives an extra aromatic touch.
Haha, you should have made a Cinnabon the size of a Beanbag chair ??
I used to work at Cinnabon and we would only put 6 buns in the pan you first used and we put them in diagonally. Also they made a HUGE deal about frosting while hot but not over frosting lol. "we sell Cinnabon, not cupcakes"
Ah the scraping the bottom of the barrel portion of babish. The best ones!
I want Babish to pour cream cheese frosting on me.
"It's too creamy, so I'm going to add cream."
i literally made cinnamon rolls last night
Is this what Americans consider "comedy"?
thank you for showing your mistakes, when you follow a recipe it usually doesn’t tell you the things that you’ve shown in this video.
American cinnamon rolls are disgusting. Looks like someone came all over them.
I thought he was talking about what is colloquially called Monkey Bread or Sticky Buns. I love making money bread.
I mean.... What else can I say besides it was a 10/10 video
Too creamy? No problem, just add cream! :^)
Cinnamon rolls without chili? I knew you city-folk were odd, but I didn't think you were barbarians.
I loved seeing the revisions here - cinnamon rolls have been one of my favourite things to bake since the time a friend taught me how. I'm looking to try a cardamom version from Sweden next! As ever, I will beg and plead and promise unto half my kingdom for an episode on the No-Face Feast from Spirited Away. Please feed your gluttonous children, Mr. Babby :')
Those hot pockets are calling me
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
Good burger from well good burger
People say that kitchen aid appliances are the best, now they must be as they're clearly Babish approved!
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin ??" Damn Babby, buy it dinner first....or maybe....make dinner with it first?
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
I was half-expecting Babish to sit on a bun as per Gaffigan’s joke.
Can't wait to make these! Delicious
I just started going back to the gym. I did not need this.
Like 0.3 sec after I saw the vid post yell THE TIME HAS COME

hey man a vegetarian special or an indian special pls
Early for the babo pin me pls babo

I've never been so early.
Unrelated Mr Babish, what kind of watch is that?
"STOP! YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW. PAY THE COURT A FINE OR SERVE YOUR SENTENCE! YOUR GOODS ARE NOW FOREFIT!"
I don’t know if I could bake this, but according to Keegan Micheal Key,... I’ve got this.
I get so much rolls from cinnamon rolls

You should have used the scene from the Mark Walberg Will Ferrell movie. I think it was called Daddy's home. It's good because Will pretty much implies that they can't be made in a regular kitchen.
