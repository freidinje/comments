These are all really gross too
Well I think its safe to say the title of this video is a lie
Wow so tasty desserts. One who Like these desserts hit the like button below my comment
Asosome and very easy thank you for sharing this video ??????????????
These recipes are from the yotube channel the scran line
If they show us all that common process which we all do and known the video will be I think more than 30 minutes
wow
Super ??????
Çok güzel??????
??????:+?????? Yeah...Only 10 minutes.....
In the first one you need to bake brownie for 30 minutes tho! So incredibly stupid!
Hmm, I think perhaps you don’t know how time works. On the very first recipe, you have to bake something and then freeze it. Unless you’re using liquid nitrogen or magic, things that size don’t go from burning hot to frozen in 10 minutes.
Super mind blowing so much??????????????????
Nice ?? but it is so difficult ????
zoom cam love fore ca ed red milj cas play sav to naar ver kroe wa lug voli ni

Ten minutes? Sez who? There's a lot of know-how, not to mention special equipment, on display here. It's entertaining, but not realistic for a lot of us (or healthy for any of us). File under fantasy.
I hate sounds background
Desserts you can make in 10 minutes. For the first dessert: bake for 30 mins

I little to creamy I’m going add heavy cream
BwB is P2W
This is what I love about Babish, he shows you his mistakes. Im a chef, want to know how I learned the most? lol of course its from informative senior chefs, but next to that, it was fucking things up until they got better and better. I can now make fancy dishes while im drunk and not make any mistakes. Hard work, determination. Cooking isn't easy it takes time to learn all the little things that help you learn to breathe in between dishes.
Make fried chicken from ‘The Help’
4:08 little bit too creamy, so i'm going to make it less creamy with HEAVY CREAM... how ironic
This channel is why I've gone to a cooking school where u work at a restaurant. This channel inspired me to pass the tradition of yt cooking from babby's mother to him to anyone with a cooking channel
Do the monster hunter feast!
Compare your content to your earlier content. Disappointed.
Another brilliant ep! Appreciate you sharing insights into your 'mistakes' - very reassuring to practicing bakers that it's all a case of trial and error.
I’ve never heard someone say “soften” that way before
make a dish out from one studio ghibli movie
solution to frosting being too creamy: add cream
I know someone probably already pitched this idea to you if you haven’t already thought of it yourself, but you should open up your own restaurant that has some of these most iconic movies recipes on the menu.
It's really really really informative to show your mistakes. We learn about the chemistry of cooking in the process, and we learn that small tweaks and changes lead to major differences. I learned a lot from this episode. Thanks!
Can you please do a thanksgiving video? I love your recipes and their the best and easiest to follow and I need ideas for thanksgiving dinner, thank you!
Ain't there two kinda one with ICING and other with cream cheese icing I I could have sworn there was one I don't like crema cheese

Nooooooo why the cream cheese ugh ??
A Steven Universe episode would be cool
I'm interested in your take on Ham's infamous s'mores from The Sandlot. Pretty basic stuff but I'd love to see your twist on it, creating your own graham crackers or adding a fun twist like using Reeses instead of Hersheys chocolate.

All y'all think Youtube is actually able to fully fund these creators' lifestyles but that just isn't true. You want the content? Pay for it. Can't afford it? Try saving your money and learn to budget. Don't want to pay for it? Shut your mouth and be glad you get to see BWB's content as it is.
Could you make a episode over Chico's Tacos. Dont be an heretic, make them the way they are supposed to be (government cheese).

Ok I think that he shouldn't make the pay 2 watch videos because i think way less will see them making them not worth it and if he posted them all here then maybe ads and sponsors will work out + i don't know what the patreon rewards are but i think i'd say the ones that pay get to choose the theme of the dish being made( if it's already this way correct me)

I thought it was binging whatever that was when I have seen your vids recommended in my feed, not bingeing. This is the first vid of yours I have watched.
the lemon ruins the whole thing.
I prefer Swedish cinnamon rolls
What was the rule of thumb for content support? Oh yea, don't paywall your normal content. Hiding episodes behind a paywall is a BS move. I get youtube is being a dick to its creators, but taking what you normally give us and hiding parts of it isn't okay. If you're going to make a paid exclusive, that's fine and more power to you, but it certainly shouldn't be what you're normally giving us as it stands. And before anyone chimes in "But it's EXTRA!" No it isnt. Home made hot pockets could very well have been next weeks episode. This blocked off content could easily be released on normal schedule. The fact that this normal content is being hidden from those who don't want to pay him or can't pay him directly is a paywall and it is NOT extra. Extra would be having an exclusive thing unique to the support, as in a new show or behind the scenes or whatever. But episodes that normally would be released to everyone now being hidden is not cool. On top of that, some of us already pay for Youtube Red, which is basically like already paying for the content of the creators we watch. Yet we are still being fucked over.
The recipe on your website has a few typos. I.e. the 1 teaspoon of salt vs. the half that you mentioned here in the video. Also, it'd be really great if you could write out the amounts for each ingredient in ml or mg, instead of ounces. Those are common measurements used almost everywhere. Ounces are primarily used in the US. Great video though!
Uuuuuuhm people? Are you really "disappointed" that someone who spents time making high quality videos said "IF YOU WANT you can sponsor me with 4.99/month for EXTRA content"????? he never said he is making his videos sponsors only, he said if you want to give him a few bucks for the free entertainment/education he is offering, you can do it with out going to another site
Sweet rolls from Skyrim?
Babish you should try to recreate the giant pancakes from the film Uncle Buck. Like if you agree

Look at all those Sayoris
Could ya make the gateau from skins
It makes me sad the people here who are complaining about missing out on a small bit of extra content because it’s not FREE. He’s been doing it on his patreon for a while. It’s literally his job, he needs to get paid. I feel like people don’t appreciate the effort that goes into content, since they expect it all for free nowadays. You can’t walk into a restaurant and demand to be served but you don’t want to pay for your food. You can’t refuse to pay the price for a movie ticket because the actors already got paid, but expect to be let into the theatre. It’s not the end of the world if you can’t get all the content you want, when you want it, and at the price you want. I couldn’t care less how much money he makes, you should support people for their content, not until they’re “doing well for themselves”. The great thing about this channel is that the normal videos are super entertaining on their own!
Hooooottt pockets
Back when I worked at a convenient store chain's kitchen, we used to make some of the largest cinnamon rolls. They came frozen in a box, so they weren't as good. Some days we'd only put 4 to a sheet pan, let them thaw over night in the refrigerator case as prep for morning, I had no clue what they did with them as i was never trained or worked mornings, but somehow they'd fill the entire sheet during baking. 6 to 8 was our typical amount per sheet, but 4 was when we got really huge rolls. Don't know what was in those rolls to make them grow that much, but having giant rolls made more profit.
take the swedish version. This just looks fucking bad.
Make The Robin Scherbatsky cocktail from How I Met Your Mother!!!
Now I'm hungry... Again. Thanks....

Banish, can you do a drunk voice over. Like drunk history.
I love ya, Babby. Guys, chill out on the payment topic. If you give even 25 cents one time on Patreon, you are contributing like a hundred times more than the standard ad-watching viewer according to Hello Internet. If you haven't given even that much, you have no leg on which to hop in your rage. Also, market forces yadda yadda. We oughtta respect his right to try stuff, even if it sounds dumb and overpriced. His deal.
Why do I hate this guy so much? Hmm. ??

Oh man, I learn so much from this channel about cooking and baking and stuff, but as someone who already bakes cinniman buns a LOT this was the first episode I loved but also was going "Aaaaaaa!!! Stop messing up those tasy buns!!" through the whole episode xD. I saw those mistakes coming before you even explained them. What I love though is you leave the mistakes in so other people can learn from them too! Cinniman buns done well are heavenly. Bad buns are dry, chewy, and heavy. The good ones I could eat by the dozen...
Make Scooby Snacks
make a discord.
That ad was fire asf
I wish I could help support you. You’re probably the first person who really got me into cooking. Now it’s a passion of mine to learn. One day I will be able to be a patreon. I’ve been trying to get a job as a prep cook to get into the industry.
kitchenaid is expensive as hell.
I don't think I've ever heard someone pronounce the t in "soften."
DO A ALMOND PALMER FROM BIG MOUTH LMAO
I like how people are getting butt hurt about having member exclusive content like he hasn't already been doing that on patreon, like many successful YouTuber's who still continue to upload on a regular basis. He literally said it's the same content as his Patreon supporters, just through YouTube. Y'all need to chill tf out and let Babish do Babish. You aren't his mom and if it bothers you that much then don't watch anymore.
Well damn my favorite channel wants me to pay him for membership content only. I can't afford that. Love ya but you sold out.
Yo can you do the triple gooberberry sunrise
Thank you for keeping the mistakes in!
i made these once for class and we put margarine on the inside before we sprinkled on the cinnamon/brown sugar and were buttery from the inside.

Yo gon get diabetes
Kinda sucks when people pay for YouTube red and still don’t get the fun stuff that a “channel member” does
”gotten to know your rolling pin”
I've been a fan for awhile, but I'm unfamiliar with your history Babish? Did this start as a hobby or is their some education behind this?
running out of ideas...
You tellin me you couldn’t find no clips of cinnamon rolls being made
You over cooked them
I'm surprised you didn't use makara cinnamon, since you used Cinnabon as your inspiration for this video. They actually have a proprietary blend of cinnamon that they use in their rolls. For shame! Haha just kidding ??
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..."
Chum. Bucket. Food.
"As God intended" lmao
What kind of conditioner do you use?
Between the serial plastic wasting sponsorship from Blue Apron and the members only episodes, I feel like you're going down a really bad path.

Jim Gaffigan's awesome. One of my favorite comedians, glad he got a feature.
Should’ve just made it a Basic with Babish.
gotten to know your rolling pin BABBIE NOOO
Man, y’all sure bitch a lot even though you get free content from the dude.

I need to try this out myself mouthwater
BABEY! HEY BABEY!!! PLEASEEEE SHAAAAREEEEEEE ????
Please do the Black spaghetti from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure
Mmmmm... my favorite Cinnamon roll...Loved ur recipe Babish
”?????????? ?????? ????????”
anyone knows whats the wrap he uses to covert the bowl?
Would love it if you did an Invader Zim episode!
He should make the dumplings from kung fu panda
Should've made the giant roll that Homer Simpson eats at Cinnabon
apple strudel from sound of music, dude
this gave me both an erection and diabetes.
You should do lobster thermidor, from the Lego Batman movie
"Binging"? As opposed to what? Google?
Hey Babish just had this idea. I bought a frozen dinner at the supermarket because I was too lazy to cook today and the picture on the box looks a million times better compared to how this came out. Ever thought of trying these frozen meals and then remaking in a super gourmet way like you do with other meals you’ve prepared? Anyways just a thought, love you channel ????
4:12 When your cream is too creamy so you add cream to make it less creamy while making it more creamy
At this point you're just making food videos then looking for that food in a movie so you have an excuse
What kind of plastic wrap is that?
You gotta do orange sweet rolls on basics now
You should make the sandwich that Peter orders in spiderman homecoming, that would be pretty cool not gonna lie
Make the double pepperoni pizza from the spider Man dlc
Yall didn't know that they're rolled, and that's why they're called cinnamon rolls????
Should have done another batch with puff pastry
What temperature do you bake them at? I’m going to try 375 Fahrenheit
The closest to a real life Sayori
What do I do if I don't have a kitchen aid? :(
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" lmao took me a second. good... job.
This is the link for the good place menu
Would it be possible to do an episode over horchata it would be amazing!
I don’t like it, it makes me hungry
I don't even like cinnamon roll's but watching this makes me want some!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." ;)
Good - it's important to learn from mistakes. It took me 4 tries to get your Inglorious Bastards strudel down to a science. Now it's a fam favourite. Never stop binging, Babish
You should make sweet rolls from Skyrim next time!
Stoned pb&j from Bo Burnham if you’re doing comedians now
I really like that you left the mistakes in. It thought me a lot about what can go wrong and how to fix it.
Wilson Fisk’s omelette
Benson's Grilled Cheese Deluxe from Regular Show!!!!
Unsubscribe Babish... you did some good videos but you're seriously overestimating your worth now.
Jim Gaffigan, noice
how is gaffigan as popular as he is milktoast crap
i like the way u oiled that rolling pin lol
I can never get my head around the american version of cinnamonbuns/rolls,,, im too attached emotionally to the 'swedish' version, the cream on top seems too much in my eyes and makes it look rather unappetizing. But to be fair,i havent tries it with frosting so i guess the flavors evens out!
Have you done the sandvich from team fortress 2? If you haven't done it could you please do it
I love that you put your mistakes because someone making the recipe at home may be doing them without knowing what went wrong
So do I sit in those or eat them?
This is a very childish request but I need to see a binge episode of Jackson and Oliver’s “Cheese Jerky” from Hannah Montana
If you start doing premieres then....
Now that the fallout vault tec cookbook is out. You think you’re gonna try some of those recipes and do your own take on it in the future maybe?
feels frosting is too creamy solution is to add cream Sometimes cooking doesn't make sense.
2nd way better I wanna make that
It would fit better to cinnamon rolls form Cinnabo in Better Call Saul.
He’s so funny I went to his show in Milwaukee
2:16 Did you ask for permission?
The cream cheese/butter is too creamy so lets add some cream to make it less creamy...
What if I want to add chocolate and caramel sauce
You should make Chidi's peep chilli from The Good Place
I'm glad you did keep the footage. It shows us that mistakes aren't terrible and career ending. You learned from it, and passed it on.
The true from scratch challenge, make your own flour, sugar, butter etc.
I'm really sad that Youtube is pushing some of its best creators into having to create premium accounts to help them out monetarily, instead of supporting them and staying true to what made this such a great platform in the first place. I can't blame anyone who is doing so - it makes so much sense, but I think that it's because Youtube is failing as a medium, rather than because this is where 'progress' is. Andrew - you deserve to reap from the content you create, because it is so well made and you can feel the time, effort and talent that goes in to every video you make. Keep it up :)
Thanks for sharing. I just made some last week by hand instead of using a mixer (i.e. wooden spoon handle to mix and hands to need), and I think they were the best I had ever made. I'm kinda swearing off using a dough hook for a bit to see if it makes a difference. But I've been working a couple days a week in a donut shop, so my kneading skills (and strength) have dramatically improved also. I did make the same first mistake, I crowded the pan and had to cut them instead of pulling them apart. But since I waited until they were thoroughly cooled, I got away with it. And I used more of a glaze than an icing so even cooled the icing got into all of the nooks and crannies. I appreciate your showing the first bit because mine looked exactly the same way. I like the 1/2 inch spacing that you did, that seemed just about perfect. I also used, as some noted, the paste method. But, I have never really liked the amount of filling left in the roll, it seems most of it runs out onto the bottom and forms that great crust on the bottom. It's tasty, just not where I want it as I like to unroll the roll to eat it and that makes the middle bite the best. I also used regular sugar, so it needed the butter. I think I'll try your filling and icing the next time and see what a difference it makes. I thought about cream cheese icing, but it didn't seem appealing at the time. Now that I've seen yours, I've changed my mind! Isn't that what sharing all of these great recipes is all about anyway?? Cooking is just one big experiment and always striving to improve.
Can you make Beef Stew from BenchWarmers?
You divide the community with the memberships and the exclusive contant..
that's a lot of nap to go through
I'm still a fan, but I feel like the show has changed. Regular episodes are starting to feel more like Basics with Babish. I liked it back when recipes had a little more creativity, complexity, or even just entertainment value. This episode was just basic cinnamon rolls. ?? Maybe it's time to expand the behind the scenes team. I know you can do better!
In sweden you put a mix of cinnamon, white sugar and butter on the dough which makes it so much more tasty
Couldn’t land a Better Call Saul clip, huh?
Babish needs a paddle for his mixer that has a scraper/spatula on it. Someone get him it for xmas.
Make something from Chuka Ichiban! please.
Much better without frosting and butter in the roll. Americans seem to have a psycosis of covering already good stuff with frosting or cheese
Where are the pickles man
do piss or bear shit from Man vs Wild
Try to make the 99 cheeses pizza from TMNT that would be foookin awesome
I still think he should do the ramen from naruto ?????
I love how your "mistakes" are barely mistakes.
you should make some food from undertale. like glamburgers and steak in the shape of metaton's face, legendary heros.
My favorite dessert
Man now I want cinnamon rolls
I fucking love the mistake parts, because I absolutely do shit like that when I try your recipes unless you specifically say "don't ____, it'll fuck it all up" lol
Can you make a Lembas Bread from Lord of the Rings, please? That would be awsome! :D
OMG He is Human Total Fuck Up on this one Babish.....lol
“So we can pull them apart, as God intended.” -Babish My favorite quote so far.
Please make Big Smoke's order from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas whenever you get the chance.
It would be cool if he could make something from Steven universe
You forgot to spread butter on the dough before adding the sugar and cinnamon mix, that was mistake number one. Usually you mix the sugar and cinnamon into the butter to make a paste and spread that, makes for moister cinnamon rolls. Also it should be pearl sugar on top, not frosting...
yo should make a keto diet video, like how to make a good proper meal
Definitely giving this a go for Christmas
In Norway we make them in a different way, we bake them all separately -not touching at all
It’s either yeast or be yeasted .
its hard not to feel warm when watching this video
Make Naruto Shippuden Ramen Please :) New Subscriber Here :)
3:54 that is the manliest way to sieve something hahaha, I shake my little girl wrist from side to side like the little pussy ho I am but babish cannot relate.
I find the lack of eggs and cardamom disappointing.
Can you do a simple rick from rick and morty????
Sploosh!!! do Zero's Sploosh from the movie Holes please??!!!!!
DO SPLOOSH FROM HOLES!!!
Yes dadish
Soup dumplings from crazy rich Asians!
5:16 - Babby pronounced the t in soften. Bold move.
Jim Gaffigan and you didnt make a HOT POCKET?
Hey Andrew - Love your videos. Would you consider using reusable, beeswax wrap instead of plastic wrap? My wife and I are foodies, and we cook a lot. We're trying to cut down on the plastic that we use, and we've found the beeswax wraps to be the perfect replacement. Give them a shot. You might like them!
Good morning, tippity top cheffers, let's get this roll!
I loved your focus on learning from mistakes! Thanks for sharing that footage, those tips are good to know
To be honest, when I think cinnabun, I think of the famous Louis CK bit. But we don't talk about him anymore...
"Synonym rolls, just like how Grammar used to make."
The next time that you make this, try brushing melted butter on the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mixture. It is delicious!
Can you make synonym rolls?
I have never ever seen or even heard of a cinnamon roll recipe that didn't add copious amounts of melted butter to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Is that even allowed?
Yesss cinnamon rolls. They are a Christmas morning tradition at my house, but really I'm always ready for one. Will give yours a try this year :)
oh yes daddy ( ?° ?? ?°) 2:16
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Oh My...
From now on, I will ALWAYS BOTH literally and philosophically wash my hands BEFORE AND AFTER cooking. Ah, I am learning so much here
You also forgot to add butter onto the dough with the cinnamon sugar mix
I think this should be a basics with babish
please do Triple Gooberberry Sunrise from The Spongebob Squarepants Movie.
Shoulda used Better Call Saul as your inspiration
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" ohhh myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Youtube agolrithims are getting creepy. I was eating a cinnamon roll and thinking of looking up a recipe.
So frustrated that you dont butter the dough before the cinnamon and sugar.
If something is too creamy, just add more cream! :D
Add vanilla to the frostingggggg
Well if you making stuff frome stand up shows You need to make the chocolate cake milkshake from gabriel stand up show
Since you’re not adverse to making Japanese food please make some food from Shokugeki no Soma aka Food Wars! Fake food has never looked so good!
My nigga where is the butter inside of the cinnamon rolls before you actually roll them?
Babish mentioned that he uses vinegar to clean his giant wooden worksurface. I am interested in that! Does someone know the right concentration for wood / kitchen? I would really like to know what concentration is the right one...
I udnerstand early access to your content if we pay, but some of us have been subs since day 1 and followed u on twitch once you started that up. So holding back videos COMPLETELY that would be monetized anyway is very disheartening babish. Dont be a sell out, remember where u came from.
basics with babish fried chicken.??
Hey Babish, Better Call Saul would've made a better excuse to make Cinnamon Rolls.
You are so cool
Again, a really great recipe! You were the inspiration to start my own YouTube channel! thanks for that :) greetings from the Netherlands!
Why didn't you just use Better Call Saul as an excuse instead?
Try to make swedish cinnamon buns or as we say in Sweden Kanelbulle.
All these people in the comments feeling entitled to free content smh
@5:19 he pronounced the T in "soften" and i cringed a little. but he is forgiven, for he is Babish
Please do some foods from the Witcher videogames next!
I really appreciate you showing the mistakes as everyone will probably make the same mistakes. Tutorial videos don't do this often enough, they quite regularly cut out mistakes to reduce length.
Chill that roll before you slice it. They'll cook more even
I hope I'm not asking for too much but I was wondering if you could outline the kitchenware and gadgets that you use, like where you got them from and what we should look for
should not have watched this without an immediate plan to go and get cinnamon rolls
Please give the Naco like you had done for this video.
They taste better if you mix the cinnamon and sugar mixture with butter and them spread it! Thats how we do it in sweden anyways
Add more cream to make this less creamy. mind explodes
why the hell would ya drown the poor buns? holy dang
Pretty soon YouTube will be just like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. Gotta pay for a subscription to watch anything.
Make wilson fisks omelete from daredevil
being swedish this saddens me. i have never seen buns made this way. Why do you americans make everything so big. And why do you cover it in cum ?
Tacos on a stick from icarly
DO THE RAMEN FROM NARUTO
It would be awesome to see you do the foods that Dr House made when he hopped off the Vicodin and got addicted to cooking instead
who cooks with a watch on ? dude...
I have just made cinnamon rolls
do pokemon malasadas next! :D
this isnt pornhub??
I’ve been a loyal fan since you only had a couple of thousand subscribers and I’ve gotta say, I feel like the quality of your videos have gone down a bit, they seem a bit rushed, and I used to love how you’d pick recipes that you could improve by using your own cooking talent as well as following the recipe as the film/ programme stated. Saying that, I wouldn’t pay $5 for the content now, I think your channel is great but it’s lost some of the sparkle it had at the beginning.
I'm very, VERY glad this isn't Louis CK's version.
As a Dane. I find this frosting a total HERESY!!
Getting to know your rolling pin
Thumbnail made me hungry. So I came here.
Really? Not from Walter Mitty? Ahh
but why didn't you add butter with the sugar-cinnamon mix :(
Making something less creamy by adding cream? America explain!!!
I love how you left all the mistakes in . The most important part of the video where I learned the most. Love this channel :D ! Thanks Babish
you forgot the butter in the rolls! Babish i'm heart broken.
YouTube won’t let me get the paid subscription
What is the cover called that he puts on the bowl at 1:59
do... do americans not put a layer of butter before the cinnamonsugar?????????????????????????????????
Who watches Babish, but never tries the recipes? ??
Very enjoyable!!
'if you ask me a little bit too creamy' Proceeds to add cream
For all the people who didn't listen, he's making ADDITIONAL CONTENT for members. You feel so entitled to say you're dissapointed. He literally not taking anything from you.
If youtubers with 2M suscribers can buy lamborghinis, you can at 3.3, not charge fucking 5$ on SpEcIaLs EpIsOdEs. ?????
Too pure for this cruel world
you say the ingredient you're adding and by the time you're done saying it, on screen, you've already finished adding the next ingredient you haven't even mentioned yet. please please stop dong this. you didn't used to do it in your first videos.
you are the best
I understand that you need money for this really nice show but I won’t stick around if I miss a ton of stuff because I don’t pay
Better Call Saul?? Cinnabon?? Missed opportunity..
You ever consider doing the wake-up juice from Back to the Future 3?
too creamy? add cream :D
Disgusting. And not the food, but the membership. Sad and disappointing.
There's no graceful way to oil a rolling pin.
gosh your voice is the bomb i love it im in love ! Just for this voice im making cinnamon rolls
It is so good to see tiny spatula getting some love this week. I don't think it's tiny heart could take any more neglect
what klingfilm are you using? is it reusable? (looks like)
WASTELAND OMLETTE (for Thanksgiving)
Glass bowl; nice touch.
Here’s a tip If you mix icing sugar, cinnamon and a drop of water it makes a paste that you can spread and it makes it more even and tasty but they do look delicious ??.

Plz make pho Babish!
Finally a proper cinnamon bun. Brioche is not a bun guys, I don't care how much cinnamon you put on or little as it seams at all these uppity joints.
Andrew listen to your subscribers who can't afford exclusive content. at the very least can you make it early release or something? i can't afford patreon.
Oh no! how dare he ask me to pledge $5 (optionally) for a little extra! How will my entitlement to free content go on? Gimme free content reeeeeeee!
It’s too creamy...... L E T ‘ S A D D C R E A M
N U T T
You could have used Better Call Saul as well. As they also have Cinabunn in it :P
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns?
I like how people are complaining about a paywall when BWB literally said at the end of the video that the exclusive "paywall" content is the same exclusive content that his patreon has been getting for years now and just because you have the option of doing or not doing the same thing through a different platform, in this case youtube. Now is when you start to complain.
I miss the days of youtube being free content where people were happy with just ad revenue. Now its patreon youtube subs and some even going to twitch. Your currently making 10 grand a month off your patreon alone, is that really not enough? Add on money you get from youtube ad revenue and sponsorships.
Louis CK’s Cinnabun joke is much better
Please make Kitty Foreman’s brownies from season 8 of That 70s Show that were so moist you could eat them with out milk, thanks.
Do you hire for jobs related to your Corp.
Does anyone else feel Babish's torso judging them?
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." LMAO also, I'm a tad bit confused what I need to do to watch that homemade hot pocket video. will it ever be on youtube?
I'm only 14, I don't even have a job ugh I love your videos so much and I really really really wish I could support!! Like I said, I'm only 14 tho I'm sad you decided to make that decision but I mean it sucks because I think the majority of your fans are kids possibly, or at the most, teens that are in college and can't afford to even get lunch sometimes But you're already receiving a ton of negative feedback which I think nobody's being mean about it and screaming "fuck you babish" or anything which is super good bc they're being tame and simply saying "I'm disappointed" But it's your channel And it's your decision Possibly to even just pay rent So I'll support your decision, in an nonmonetary sense bc I'm broke Either way, thanks for the videos!
Gonna make two batches of cinnamon rolls after watching this. Just so I can learn from the mistakes too ??
Those jokes were dead
hey look, it's a Twit...wait no, Youtube subscription
Jesus Christ, I usually check the comments on Babish's videos because they tend to be decent people having nice conversations, but holy shit everyone is going mental over A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION! Like, just accept it and move on, no one had a problem with the fact he's had a Patreon forever, which does literally the same thing. ???????? ????'?? ?????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???? ?????????? ?????? ??????. Youtube FINALLY does something that makes it easier to be a Youtuber nowadays without the demonetization bot shitting down their throats (and no, I don't think for a second that Babish gets demonetized) and everyone acts like it's the end of the world, chill out, it literally never has to effect you if you don't want it to.
Broooooo he should low key setup a contest and who ever wins, he flys them out to NY(i think that's where he lives) they spend a whole day with him and they are part of a video plus they pick a video of his channel of a dish he has made and they take part in making it
I think you meant literally washed and philosophically didn’t wash your hands
Hey a tip for next time you make these: get non-flavored dental floss and get a good amount. Then put it under the roll halfway and bring the 2 ends up in a crisscross to get a clean even cut. You get more control of your size with that.
You could have just used Schitt’s Creek. As an excuse lol
Can you make brownies?
REEEEE LEAK THT HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS
I know it's been a while since crunchyroll sponsored you, but please give us from food wars A) The Soma vs Joichiro Breakfast Challenge B) The Takumi vs Mimasaka Semifreddo battle and/or c) Soma's risotto stuffed quail

Exclusive episodes just for people that pay? Not cool.
Mistake number one wasn’t forgetting butter under your sugar/cinnamon mixture???
I had a cinnamon roll yesterday at school
My heart stopped just watching this
$5 is less than one half of one lunch out. Get a grip, people. I spend more than this each week on soda
Your god maybe
Make the sundae from that one episode of Spongebob
You should make a video about Gokus epic meals!
Well, after my upcoming contribution to our Halloween Potluck, I know what I'll be bringing to the office NEXT! =D
And now I'm fat. :p /Ok, ok, 'fatter,' dammit, shut up. //totes worth it.
I don’t understand how the standup was funny at all...
Let me thin out my cream cheese, butter and sugar frosting, with heavy cream...
Does anyone else feel accomplished when they see binging with babish using the same utensil as you have at home? Well I sure do
How about the dumplings from “BAO”?
Or it could have rather been the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from better call saul.. :/
“Screwed up royally” lolllll
Now lets do Louis CK’s cinnabons
Nice buns!
why oil not flour? also why bread flour not AP Flour?
IT'S NOT ORANGE! OUTRAGEOUS!
Id like to get to know your rolling pin daddy babby
Jim Gaffigan is a real Queer cock sucker.
Yess such a great breakfast for such a great stand up show lmao
So is the Tu-tur-key-key your Thanksgiving special for this year?
I half expected him to just do the bad batch and call it a video. Nice to see he's picking the quality back up.
Men are u ever coming to argentina?
why are people so angry about the 5 dollar thing? nothing changes for you. i dont sub to his patreon but im not here whining like WOW YOU'RE MAKING US PAY FOR BEHIND THE SCENES?? his regular content will still be free (with ads ofc). like let him live. we all need money to survive and we can all do with it as we please. its not like he's genuinely forcing it on you. god damn.
You know Babby, I could've really used a Hot Pocket tutorial ??...
You shouldn't knead on medium speed. Its 2 for kneading. You definitely shouldn't knead on medium on camera. Pretty sure you just voided your warranty.
I hate Jim so much lol
Jim Gaffigan is a terrible comedian
Make taco on a stick from icarly
Who thinks he should do a series were he makes the biggest foods from restaurants taking the normal ones and make them huge
You didn’t butter the inside! Cinnamon and sugar, and melted butter, roll it up and butter even more! The more butter the better!
It's too creamy I think I'll add HEAVY CREME to thin it out
Okay I lovya babish but cream cheese icing? Why man. Why
90 of your dishes go into the "clean plate club" is had lost its prestigious label.
Can you make Chidi's Chilli from The Good Place ?
$5 a month for one single channel? I love this channel but that's ridiculous, especially since you're paywalling some of your videos.
A question, is it cinnamon rolls, ir cinnamon buns? Or are they different baked goods?
Better Call Saul would have been a good reference as well.
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ??
I have a question: What size eggs do you use?
I love that Babs always owns his mistakes. It makes beginner cooks a lot less intimidated to know that everyone makes these kinds of screw-ups.
Anyone else catch the innuendo he made while greasing the rolling pin?
For some reason I thought the cream was salt and I almost cried
I don’t see the membership option.
Babish would probably crucify me. I forget to add bacon, cheese, salt and pepper before flipping my omelette over every time.
Do food from Studio Ghibli films!
Crème de la crème à la Edgar !
So how much do we have to donate to patreon to have you cook a meal for us? ??
There are no mistakes in art.
Glad to see I’m not the only one sad I don’t get to see that exclusive homemade hot pockets episode. It’s not a matter of not wanting to support you, rather an inconvenience to your fans that we would all have to pay $5 to see a new recipe. I understand you want to be compensated for your work, but this idea leaves a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
2:16 ( ?° ?? ?°)
Can you please make Pokepuffs?
Bruh next time spread the butter across the dough then add the sugar spice mixture fam.
That was awesome! Thank you so much for including the "what not to do section." I honestly learn more from those honest mistakes!
Dude Why do I feel the need to see you in an episode of Bob's Burgers?
anyone else unroll the cinnamon roll then lick the frosting off your finger only to realise you haven't washed your hands but you don't wanna wash them cause then you loose 50% of the frosting so you keep licking it off your fingers anyway?
You ran out of ideas from movies and TV shows huh...
4:09 MAKE LESS CREAMY BY ADDING MORE CREAM
There are too many swedes on the internet to propagate these lies of their cinnamon rolls being better -- they are almost always dry, have weird added spices that throw off the flavor of the cinnamon, and they sprinkle freaking rocks of sugar on top. Get out of here with that shit.
Could you do some dish from the Hundred Foot Journey?
With you voice Babbish, you need to narrate a documentary or something. It's so soothing.
Thank you Babish ,you are the Jesus of cooking
Love Jim Gaffigan
White comedians are so cringy lol
BABISH!
You should make Minnie’s chocolate pie from The Help or Ed’s sauce from GoodBurger
Easily eat all 12 of them
Not a fan on exclusive episodes behind a paywall.
I’m having so much unnecessary anxiety your videos are probably the only thing that calm me down .??
"once you gotten to know your rolling pin"
why are you putting content behind a paywall? sigh... that's kinda sad
If I wasn’t burnt out on Cinnamon rolls I would make these for breakfast... Screw it, they look too good to not make them.
Never clicked on a video so fast
Who the fuck puts cream cheese a on cinnamon roll?
My family visits Cinnabon regularly and my young kids love to watch the workers make cinnamon rolls. One thing they do differently is adding softened butter to the dough after it's been rolled out and then adding a cinnamon-heavy mixture on top of that. If you're going for the Cinnabon level of roll that Gaffigan is talking about, you gotta add butter to the dough and vanilla to the frosting.
Make more videos God damnit
I tried to pass this video because I knew I would get hungry but it looked too good... now I’m hungry
You mean sweet roll
Make a sandwich from Scooby-Doo
My wife makes cinnamon rolls that are indistinguishable from Cinnabon...main difference is she butters the inside of the roll as well
yeah dude. i mean, i know u gotta pay ur bills and shit; but ive been following u since u had 100k followers. Last couple episodes were all about that blue apron shit, and again, i dig that. but, if thats the way you going with this channel, i appreciate all the videos uve posted and i wish u good luck
do the Kimchi Gumbo from the movie "Searching"
>says the frosting is too creamy >adds cream
sorry babish but i need to report this for pornography
I think I'll stick with my kanelbullar.
Please do Peeps in the Chili Pot from last week's episode of the Good Place...clean plate club member for sure.
The best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made are the Alton Brown Good Eats book recipe, but I’ve gotta try these
This is too creamy... adds cream Now I understand the use here, but the name makes it sound counterintuitive
You should try making swedish cinnamon rolls. :)
I am so obsessed with cinnamon rolls rn too omg ??
If we're letting stand-up comics in, can you do orange chicken from Jo Koy's set?
Those cinnamon rolls looked so good it brought tear to my eye. (I know, pathetic, but cinnamon rolls are amazing. Anyone who says different has issues)
I'm too broke for memberships aaaaaah. I feel bad that I can't support you through Patreon already. Ahhh college sucks.
I’ll be unsubbing, I don’t support paywalls
the amount of people crying over content they didn't even know they were missing is amazing. you didn't have it, you didn't lose it, yet you're still crying about it.. he isn't changing to sub-only for fucks sake, he just uploads a few videos for patreons and sub-only.. its not the end of the world, you won't see less videos of him..
I feel like my grandma could teach you a thing or 2 but it’s good you did okay, love the vids keep it up??
You should make chocolate covered meatballs from that one episode of american dad just to give you a challenge.
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin,...." Shouldn't we have taken it out for dinner & a movie first...?
Want to make your cinnamon rolls extra sticky and yummy? Pour a cup of heavy cream over the rolls before baking as normal. I transcended the human plane after tasting it.
First of all, I am an absolutely straight man. Now this is what I have to say, dude you are an absolutely beautiful man with those cinnamon rolls no I think the cinnamon rolls are beautiful.
too creamy... adds heavy cream.
If you ever come to Texas, go to Lulu's in San Antonio. They make a GIANT 3 lbs cinnamon roll. It is delicious and absolutely almost impossible to finish.
Synnonym roll like grammar used to make
You forgot butter with your cinnamon and sugar mixuture
This guy is a greedy sellout
Saul Goodman would be proud of you
DONE! I wish I had thought to take PICTURES! But the moment I saw this video go up I knew I had to try it! The rolls hadn't finished cooling before they were all gone! Clean plate club for sure! This is an amazing recipe and I can't wait to make them again! Thank you for all your hard work!
Put them in a box & send to me plz as is, I don't care! I am the barb kelner of cinnamon rolls! lol
It's 4 am and i'm competely wasted, watching this helps me ti survive this night
Love jim
Why don’t you add butter with the cinnamon sugar?.... won’t omitting the butter result in a dryer cinnamon bun?
What is it called cinnamon bun, cinnamon role or cinnamon swirl? Or did they do that to screw with us
Too creamy? Add cream.
Can you make the good burger sauce from good burger
Louis C.Ks standup on Cinnabun is hilarious
Babish has Big Dick Energy pass it on
I'm sad that I can't eat these since I'm allergic to cinnamon. I always walk past cinnamon rolls in the store and they are so temping.
I really just think you wanted to make more cinnamon rolls...and I'm ok with that because? I'd do the same
it was only a matter of time before your success warranted a paywall. congratulations are in order.
Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin ??
People seem to not understand this one simple fact: It's literally the exact same thing the patreon supporters were getting in the first place. You aren't getting fully pay walled for his normal content. So why shit on Andrew for making adding just a little bit more to his income? If you have the extra money, cool... If not you'll still be getting ALL the normal content.
This looks soooooooo good
This episode makes me feel sleepy.
What is better for you fees wise, youtube membership or patreon? I will do whatever charges you the least fee percentage.
Only one way to remove paid sites on a ad driven website.  Unsubscribed
the Broodwich please
You + Jim Gaffigan = Good Video
$4.95 a month? Pathetic rubbish.
That frosting is vomit inducing.
Woah woah wooooaaah, you're putting whole episodes behind the paywall now? No, come on man, you know better.
Great now make me some.
Can you make spaghetti tacos from iCarly
Frosting is too creamy, add heavy cream to thin it out
jim gaffigan inspired episode and you dont go with hot pockets?
What cling wrap do you use? It doesn’t look plastic...
Cinnamon rolls? You mean Lin Manuel Miranda
Great video keep it up
WAIT did babish just make a mistake? ???????
I shouldn't have laughed that hard on some of the things you've said on this particular episode. oh well.
You forgot the bacon
Boo, locking content behind paywall. For shame.
Gain 10lbs by just watching the video..how..HOW!!!
bro u kinda look like my 8th grade science teacher
Your collection of tiny kitchen utensils has gotten me intrigued beyond belief. Tiny wHisk isn't alone anymore.
Let this man make money on something he works hard on. This literally doesn't take anything away from you, it's extra content. Welcome to capitalism.
secretly wishing I was the rolling pin . . .
I was looking for one of these.
I love Jim Gaffigan
Momma always butters the dough before adding the cinnamon sugar mix
This morning I saw this video and I craved cinnamon rolls and I’m home alone on fall break and I don’t have enough money for postmates so I decide I’ll walk to the store which is about a mile away. So I look and look but I don’t find and money. All I found was a 1964 50 cent coin... ??!!! All silver coins (accept nickles) before 1965 were made of 90% silver! And I know there is a gold and silver shop near my house that I can walk to (about 0.5 miles away) so I take the coin and sell it for $6 then I go to the store and get the cinnamon rolls but my sister texts me to get her Starbucks from my Starbucks account but my phone is at 1% so I barely make it and then walk 1 mile home. Worth it.
when he was like wow it doubled in sized
I love you even more Babish for the Jim Gaffigan refrence????.
I wanna punch the person who came up with the the name for "Cream Cheese" It sounds like the most disgusting thing ever I mean who would combine cheese and cream
You should write these down
I like how the comments are filled with peoples “you know what I think” ‘s, and others complaining about paying to support. Real classy. Keep up the good work man, and make some food from Zelda. ??
Soff-ten?
I like mine made with half cake flour, half AP flour so they’re very tender, and I use a brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter mixture to fill. I skip the frosting because I’m already eating a cake filled with sugar and butter. It’s just too much for me.
the entitlement coming from people who consume content for free is a whole lot lmao, you don't have to pay nor will your normal vids get affected by the choice
$4.95 a month is absurd! You better post a new killer recipe about every few hours to justify that. And how about posting the recipes in the comments to save some time. That way we can go out and earn some money to pay for ridiculous YouTube subscriptions! Get real.
If you cut them with a thread they retain a more round shape. My mom would freak out if she saw you cut them with a knife.
BITCH WTF HOMEMADE HOTPOCKETS TAKE MY MONEY BINGINGWITHBABISH
You should make bread pudding next
The stand up wasn't funny at all
This video made my stomach growl so much! I would love love love to see you recreate the fluffleberry cake from the Trolls series on Netflix! Your content is so visually appealing!
Would you like that with some hot jizz?
bless. you.
jim gaffigans the best.
Don’t you wish they served this for breakfast at school?
Louis CK had a good bit abt cinnabuns ??
Try putting softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and marshmallows inside your cinnamon rolls! And instead of that frosting use powdered sugar, milk, oil, and almond flavoring. It’s really really good, I promise!
2:15 ( ?° ?? ?°)
"We can pull them apart as God intended" ... I love you Babish
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" hahaha
Babish oiling that rolling pin????
I mean, so long as he continues to release his regularly scheduled videos, I don't really care about the member stuff.
Anyone whining about him offering extra content to people who are willing to pay for it is a pathetic loser.
Babish in 4K is amazing
you should "make" an app like Tasty or Fit Men Cook with recipes with in app purchase for new seasonal recipes
Filthy Frank's Hair Cake.
Can you do a cooking mama recipe?? If you haven't done it already.
There is no god.
ohmygod seeing people complain about how Andrew is utilizing the YT membership is making me so angry. Y'ALL FORGET THAT THIS IS HIS JOB!!
Duuude Finallyy You did cinnabon rolls!
1. Watches video of delicious looking homemade cinnamon rolls 2. Drives to to store and buys cinnamon rolls in a tube
Shoutout: To the Kousher Salt For making this channel possible
Make the Ethiopian food from the Simpson's
I like how Babish decreased the 'creaminess' of the frosting by adding cream lol
If you’re making food from a comedy act, you can do food from anime. Make bell peppers and beef from Cowboy Bebop
What did you cover the dough with when you first rested it?
Mooncakes please
Think of it this way. If he can't make a living off youtube then he'll have to get a 9-5 job and cut back on videos. No one wants that right?
Make Kingpin’s omelette.
I already have an absolutely perfect recipe for cinnamon rolls that I found years ago.
To all those complaining about the pay wall , you're not losing anything. Those people are just paying for something extra. It's fair.
Daddy babish back at it again blessing me with your skills ?? (no homo)
Make dc mumbo sauce
Weirdly enough, 2 of the 3 mistakes were also done by Andrew in Tasty's Eating your Feed... and it was also a Cinnamon Roll... o_o
Babish I'm moving into an apartment to be closer to college at the end of this year and I swear to God you are going to get me through that with your recipes
2:18 He says once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin Right as he is stroking the wood u see what I’m saying
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" tell us how you really feel Andrew.
What yeast do you use ? And what kind of sifter did you use in this video ?
I don't understand why everyone is so up in arms about him having paid extra content. He already has a patreon that gets extra content when you pay, so why not having the exact same thing here? It's not like he's not doing his regular content anymore. You give extra, you get extra. It's literally EXTRA for a reason.
He messed up on purpose so that he had an excuse to make more cinnamon rolls.
Omg I just drooled Input Homer Simpson Drooling hear....................... I wish I had a Stan mixer with attatchnents. Now I want Cinnamon rolls Yummmmmmmmmmmmm
Wow did not need to see Babish lubricating his rod...
This dough should be sticky Oil up the rolling pin because the dough is sticky
I've made probably like 600lbs of bread or more, and I gotta say, I've never had an issue with yeast+salt, you should do a mythbusters style myth busting episode of cooking beliefs vs reality. Like how some people put oil in their pasta water to make it not stick etc.
FUCK This Really I bet you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon rolls (Edit) Just read the description make something tomorrow (Edit2) This is Just a Joke (edit3) make bubbas shrimp part 2
I looooove your videos! They make cooking look like so much fun. I would love to see you do the MLT from The Princess Bride! Also, some of Amy’s creations from Brooklyn 99 like the baking soda mashed potatoes ??
I don’t understand what the big deal is about Andy’s decision. You have the option to pay for extra content. Extra. It’s not like he’s suddenly making his whole channel inaccessible unless there’s payment. I think it’s completely fair. You can choose to not pay and still see his normal videos as per usual.
I'll be making vegan cinnamon rolls tomorrow I'm so excited
Make anything from the cartoon show chowder
bell peppers and beef (cowboy bebop) ?
I just want God intended fluffy bread..
Folks complaining about a “paywall” should understand it's only for extra content. Regularly scheduled Babby will continue for free (ad-supported)
1 (and biggest one) mistake: give a fuck about visuals and texture. Man Like my Mother always says:" it should Not Look Like Hiroshima, but Bit broken is ok." Banking never goes like you would expect it. So chill. Your First try was good too. Next time do karnellbular (real cinnamonbuns). They are much better than that what you call cinnamonbuns
DUDE!!!! I just saw you on Buzzfeed's Worth It!! Crazy, out-of-nowhere cameo! That was so cool! Small world!
Babish likes Jim Gaffigan holy shit my life is complete
So two things. 1). Can you do like a basics episode, but for college students? Like how to make good food with only a stove, oven, and hand tools, maybe a crockpot. Because I'm in college right now and would love to make some of your recipes, but I dont have access to a stand mixer, or an electric hand mixer, or any real "fancy" tools. I just think it would be really cool. 2). I am not a fan of the membership for "normal" videos. I can understand if it was for like the behind the scenes and Q&A videos that I know you do on patreon, but not for this. I'm a college student, I can barely afford groceries and gas right now, I can't afford to pay for videos, as much as I want to see them. I love your content, but I dont think this is the right thing to do. No matter what happens I'm still going to keep watching whatever I can.
Make the food from The Green Mile
You can get sponsored by audible and do book foods One suggestion I have is the foods from Rutabaga: the adventure chef
This makes me so sticky.
Babish I don't want to be that guy but you're already pulling down a healthy six figure salary each year purely off the Patreon revenue you already have plus whatever you get off of ads and sponsorships. I'm not so sure that exclusive videos are the best way to take the channel, $5 a month might not seem like much but it adds up and the entirety of Netflix is only $8 a month, I don't think that's really a good price point for one single channel that gets maybe an extra episode or two per month in comparison.
Babish: puts dough in a bowl to rise for the millionth time Me: "Holy shit it so big now"
Everything candy from Jimmy Neutron ????????
What if you flour your surface/rolling pin instead of oiling it. Does that work just as well?
Charge a dollar and you’ll make more money. Less people will be “disappointed” and more people will be comfortable with spending a dollar vs 5. Enough to outweigh how much you would make charging 5, I believe. I’m thinking about it like this. Netflix costs $7.99 for way more content so it seems very disproportionate to people. Doesn’t 1 seem so much further away from 8 then 5? Enough so for people to be enticed enough to care and think they’re getting a better deal out of it.
Wow. Ok. A pay-wall for "exclusive episodes". This is a sad day. Didn't think you were the kind of creator to do us like that Babs. Gonna have to drop a downvote on this episode, first one ever but trying to cash out on supporters who have been supporting you since the beginning, people who have bought your cookbook, watched your ads, clicked your links, and upvoted every episode... This is kinda gross.
Best cooking show out there.
Clicked so fast because I thought Jim Gaffigan was guest staring. Good job Babs, ya got me! Great recipe too!
Guys if you don’t want to support him just don’t. He wants to make something special for those who have the ability to give him extra support and it’s okay!! Let him live
I don't know why I hate cinnamon rolls. Everything about them is right. But my body just says "this is too fucking sweet and the filling does not work with the dough." home made or not, I kind of hate them But I'll kill the shit out of a tray of those gross orange frosted Pillsbury rolls.
damn but i wanna know how to make hotpockets
this is a bit of a stretch
I don't know where Jim is getting his Cinnabon from, but every cinnamon roll I've seen from them is about the size of a head of garlic.
“*rubs oil over rolling pin suggestively* once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” ??????
I add extra brown sugar to avoid the frosting and crowd to keep slightly moist dough. People love them.
for all those saying "Eww paywall eww" Shut your bitch ass up. Nigga got to eat, and with all the bull shit youtubes going through dont be suprised.
really..so I'm never going to see how you make hot pockets?
Make the doughnut breakfast sandwich from the same stand up please!
I love this channel so much, but that "join" button makes you look like a piece of shit. It makes me think of someone like Jake Paul.
you could have made this a better call saul episode and ya blew it! :P
It could also be from better call saul
DAAAAMN i want it now
do chug jug from fordnide
Gonna take a wild guess and say the opening scene was Andrew's 2nd favorite Cinnamon Roll related bit. Can you guess the first? Hint: Louis CK
Yes. Love the change in format. Don't be afraid to express yourself just because you've accumulated a lot of subscribers now, people like your personal creativity as well
Ah, Jim Gaffigan. My favorite comedian. By the way, the special that clip was from is called Beyond the Pale, and it's on Netflix if you want to give it a listen.
HOLY FUCK THAT LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING JESUS GOD I WANT IT NOW!!!!
what watch are you wearing?
People consider standup comedy funny? That's fucking retarded.
Including mistakes was a nice touch! Nice to see you jazz up the formula.
HEY GURL HEY ??
this is a version of art, in video format, it is entirely fine for him to charge for extra videos. It takes time and effort to film and edit, if he feels the need for added compensation I'm glad he felt comfortable enough to do so. No one's forcing you to pay, the fuck is this attitude of 'i get so many videos for free how dare you not give me everything'
For everyone that is pissed off that he has an exclusive membership for extra content, if you don't want to pay, you get a video a week. If you would pay 5 bucks a month you get extra. Literally if you want more you have to pay, just like everything in life.
why is this in my recommended
Fuck jim gaffiagan
So why not use 2 baking pans? And why pans over sheets?
Hey Mr. Babish. I have a recommendation for one of your videos! You should make Mrs. Beans famous nutmeg ginger apple snaps from fantastic Mr. Fox.
dam, you literally made my friend shed a tear with that pan removal.
Once you got to know you’re rolling pin ????
I love Jim Gaffigan! He's great ??
2:17 Andrew, I - don’t even know what to say
You should do the number 9 menu idea in Regular show
I just saw Jim Gaffigan Nashville
So just cinammon rolls? Putting Jim in the title seems pointless.
I am so glad that you use lemon in your recipe! It really brightens up the flavor!
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
This guys whole channel is a fuckin joke just takes click bait names for things people like and oh I’m making that
Exclusive episodes, woohoo.... One more youtuber falls to the dark side... I get that you need money, i get that you want to give something back to people who support you, but content paywalls are the dark side of this kind of content... Other channels managed to get better ways to do that...
I used to work at Cinnabon, good try, but not even close.
Good excuse
Lmao “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin...” I can’t????
Cook with Gordon Ramsay dude!
will the membership exclusives eventually become videos you put on your channel free?
Well, you pronounced the T in 'soften', so I'm afraid that's it for me. Good luck in all your future endeavors.
Don't call it "mistakes," call it what it is; "Research and development." It always pays off doing a test run 1st whenever you're doing new things in the kitchen.
"cream in the cream cheese until creamy, but this was too creamy so i added cream"
Well he's offering a service. Paying for that service makes sense.
Anyone else say “Oh fuck” @5:20
I love this channel just finished binge-watching every video
"once you get to know your rolling pin"
Capitalizing??
Make Rick and Morty food
Is the buttermilk measured in fluid ounces?
its scientifically proven salt will not damage yeast. its a culinary school myth
I want to mention I think the babish sponsor isn't as bad as people are saying. We're not losing the videos on Tuesday and Thursday because this is implemented, it's just an option you have to pay for more content in a week. I think it's understandable that $5 could seem steep some people myself included but I don't think it's totally outlandish when people are super down to subscribe to channels on Twitch all the time just for emotes and no additional content. I'm not into the idea of a highly requested episode being behind a paywall, so I hope the sponsored episodes are ones that Andrew specifically thought to create.
Whats the generic reason a person would oil their work service vs flouring it?
Man you’ve gotten lazy. You used to have original and unique recipes and variations but now you just made a generic cinnamon roll literally anybody could make. On top of this you introduce paid content? Your subs are going to plummet
How you gonna make cinnamon rolls and not make chili after
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
So that's the reason I feel sleepy after eating Cinnamon buns. They are heavy
Ha! "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." Ha!
Make a Mr.Robot or Tim Burton special please? And either make something from We Bare Bears
Could you subsitute all purpose flour instead of bread flour?
Too creamy he says while adding more cream
WHY DIDNT YOU USE THE CINABON SCENES FROM BETTER CALL SAUL!!!!!!!!! IM MAD
Why'd ya have to tease me like this? Evil!
did you actually just pronounce the "t" in soften as in "soft-en" ?!
This Look So Good ??
Can you pleeeaaaase do the mini muffins ????
You should do Katsudon from Yuri!!! on Ice or San Xian noodles from Flavors of Youth
If you make mistakes in your recipes, I really think you should leave the footage in. You could show the audience first hand what it should and shouldn't look like. The mistakes you make I guarantee 99% of society will make too.
The darkening injures him in the left thigh
What is that cover called that he puts over the bowls?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS JIM GAFFIGAN IS AMAZING
Those mistakes were really just blessings in disguise. Would still eat.
Do a real kanelbulle!
Cummie rolls ??????
I mean to be fair call me a fat fuck but I would wish the cinnamon rolls were bigger
the fact you’re making ‘exclusive’ content has really made me want to stop watching your channel which is a shame because i love everything you post, but you’re starting to get too greedy.
• At the start of the video: [sees Jim Gaffigan] . . . ? ??? ?????~??s ? • Watching the end slate: [gaaaasp!] ? HOMEMADE HOT POCKE~ETS! ?
Cream cheese frosting + Cinnamon rolls = ??
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish, because it's not related to movies or TV?
We have all intentionally fucked up cinnamon rolls before babish. It's like a culinary right of passage.
Do Ed's Sauce from Good Burger!!!
Snazzy wrist watch, Babby???? If you're running out of ideas, a House MD Special would be awesome
when will we get bubba's shrimp part 2 bab
I love Jim Gaffigan and I Binge watch Babish all the fairly often
Can you make food from fantastic mr Fox
So... he’s asking us to pay $4 a month to watch “extra” stuff even when he already earns a ton of money? Come on Andrew.
2:16 “once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” please tell me I’m not the only one with a dirty mind ????
I really don’t understand why everyone is so upset about the membership exclusive videos; it’s the exact same concept as what Babish is doing on Patreon. This is also his job now and it’s ridiculous to expect him to keep churning out content without payment. I get that he has sponsors and stuff but I’m sure these videos get expensive and people need to eat and pay rent too. Nobody is obligated to pay for a membership, it’s just a way to support content creators you like.
Too creamy. Add some cream.
I love Jim gaffigan
I have only eaten cinnamon rolls like twice in my life but whenever i see them in a cooking video i crave them so much. Its 01:08 AM, HELP
I don't even cook that often but I cant get enough of you're content. It must be that angelic voice you have ??
Need more Baking with Babish™ in my life
Babby, I really enjoyed the mistakes, on shorter videos (if the mistakes happen again) please repeat! Especially as it's a benefit to us lower level cooks AND it's pretty funny and humanising, nobodies perfect!
Waaaaaaaat no worstishiresgshshhjtehurehurhier sauce
Is that a rolling pin in your apron or are you just happy to see me?
You should make the "Captain Crunch casserole" from Futurama
Microwave wings from regular show pls
The day has finally come!!!! :)
Can you make Borscht?! please
you must be really struggling there having adds, sponsored videos plus asking for donations...WOW!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Have you made spaghetti tacos from icarly, because if not I think you should
Let me just break out my wheelbarrow
Infinity War foods - 'Metaphysical Ham on Rye' Reuben Sandwich, 'Stark Raving Hazelnut' ice cream, 'Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge ice cream, Deep Fried Edinburgh Kebab, Zarg Nuts
Dilutes creamy mixture with cream
hey great videos! it would be cool to see you make kringle like the kind you can find in Racine, WI
Shouldve done it “from breaking bad” lol
Good to know even the mighty babish makes mistakes. And still eats them ??
Lemon zest should be mandatory.
Gut busters Malcolm in the middle
Didn't Louis CK do a similar bit? Or are we just acting like he's dead to everyone now...
Ohhh THATS why they're called Cinnamon rolls
Make Asuna's Ragu stew from SAO!
REALLY!!!!!!! THE ONE ITEM I WAS WAITING FOR AND NOT PRESSURING YOU ABOUT, WE HAVE TO PAY TO SEE?!?!?! HOT POCKETS, FML
Why not just make this a Basics with Babish? Great video though.
My Grandma always makes her frosting too sweet but love the rolls
Also Louis CKs stuff
Don't get greedy
Babish, make the foods from Everybody Loves Raymond.
I'm with the majority here, don't sell out and get greedy trying to make more money at the expense of the people that love your chanel. It's a good way to lose subscribers in my opinion.
Since when does anyone need an excuse to make cinnamon rolls? There’s never a bad reason to make delicious cinnamon rolls??
Wish he used someone funnier to make cinnamon rolls ??
???? ????
haaahha paaaaahhckaaat
Ehh i like the video but Jim gaffigan isnt funny
Sonic the hedgehog chilli dogs
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." ( ?° ?? ?°) Also, premium content behind a paywall is bad in many definitions of the word. If you're putting it behind a paywall, make it limited. A month waiting period or something along those lines so EVERYONE gets the content, but you're still making it very much a "support me and see it early" kinda thing. Most folks are okay with something like this.
Please do the food from Haven
You should do the mud pie and salad from Drop Dead Fred, both movie accurate and edible versions
rubs oil sensually over rolling pin "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." I lost it Lmfao
argh its torture :T i wanna see that homemade hot pocket episode :V
Could have easily done cinnamon rolls from better call Saul, where they make them like 6 times
You forgot to spread the dough with 18 pounds of butter per square inch
Please do the foods from Once Upon A Time in America!!!
I really, really hate cooking. But I really, super love watching you cook. Keep up the awesome work. Such a great channel.
i like pizza
godly
?????? "as god intended"?????? 5:25 sec
Good on you for the honest mistakes. I've been consistently impressed with you as a YouTuber and I hope you keep producing content. Great Stuff Babish!
Has Jim Gaffigan ever actually been funny about anything? He's almost on the same level as Springfields "What's up with that?"
Make orange marmalade from Paddington!
when i was a girl scout, every single year for christmas we got together for a gift exchange and to make cinnamon rolls. i was a scout for about 10 or so years (i mean, once a scout, always a scout, but you get the picture) and it was what i always looked forward to most. these cinnamon rolls were absolutely melt in your mouth. we barely gave them time to cool and they just dissolved, so sugary sweet it was like heaven. it's been nearly 10 years since i last had one of those suckers and think about them more often than i probably should. i ran into my troop leader a few weeks ago, and asked her for the recipe and she said maybe we can all get together again for a reunion - and of course, cinnamon rolls. my little heart can hardly wait.
Why are you destroying a wonderful Scandinavian pastry by drowning it in cake icing? It's also way too thick, lacks cardamom and has almost no cinnamon in it.
“I’m using this as an excuse” Just say u wanted some cinnamon rolls
Do we have to use egg
You should do dorm style foods
I absolutely LOOOVE Cinnabons!!!!! Too bad I can't buy them where I live :(
Maybe you should make apple cake
In the movie Gamer the kid asked for a sandwich with every "butter" the could find: peanut butter, almond butter, ect. It would make for good content I think
Please make Foods from Seinfeld part 2
Rat Burger, Demolition Man
Just did some research and found that Luis ck. took the joke, not the other way around.
No cardamom? These are heathen cinnamon rolls.
388,943rd view
I have to pay to see all the episodes now? Can't say I blame you, but I'm really not happy ether.
Foods from the Marvel Netflix shows would be a good one. So Wilson Fisks breakfast from Daredevil, some whiskey based cocktails inspired by Jessica Jones and some of the asian cuisine in Iron Fist. Cant think of anything for Luke Cage atm but its been a while since I watched it.
Slowly spreads oil on rolling pin "so once you have gotten to know your rolling pin"
Damn these look delicious. I learned to make cinnamon rolls from my nanna (she wasn't actually my grandma but she was as good as), and she always put down a thicc layer of butter on the rolled out dough before all the cinnamon-sugar; so, if you're looking for an extra dose of decadence, give it a shot!
As God intended ??????
Loved the extra footage of learning from your mistakes. Would love to see more stuff ups and fixes in the future
Or from Better Call Saul.....
Please do the most expensive mc1035 from archer
In Maya Rudolph hormone monster voice make whatever you want daddy, I won’t judge
Do the krusty burgers from the Simpson’s or well known as skinners “steamed hams”
Could have used the Homer Simpson clip of him wrapped up like a big toasty cinnamon bun.
2:17
Make a time lapse of bread rising
better call saul could have worked.
Better call Saul Pimento sandwich???
I'm glad you found an excuse to make cinnamon rolls!
You HAVE to butter the sheet of dough before putting the cinnamon and sugar on and rolling! It’s the most important step :( idk how people eat dry ass rolls
You should’ve put bacon grease on the table
Oh nice youtube is becoming a patreon/twitch copy, how wonderful.
they're beautiful
Today in my foods class while cooking I said “let those flavors get to know each other” and my teacher gave me extra credit for being clever??????
You should make 1 of the meals that the Palico make in Monster Hunter World or all of them
For better cuts for cinnamon roles use butchers twine or unflavored floss, tie it around and gently squeeze to make better cuts
Those rolls would of came out 100x times better if you 1 Before you sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar you brush on Crisco (Shorting) and 2. add a little bit of vanilla in frosting, anyone trying this trust me just covering the dough with shorting before the sprinkle will make a night and day difference
Do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil.
“Once you’ve got to know your rolling pin” then rubs it up and down ??
hmm too creamy..... ADD MORE CREAM!!!
”Getting to know your rolling pin”
"it's too creamy so I'll add cream" Idk why this made me laugh
5:19 "as we extradite..." did you mean EXTRICATE?? ; )
Regular show, Microwave wings
But what makes bread bread is the shape of it that let's you cut it into a slice?
And what resulted was a truly delicious cinnamon roll
If you guys wonder how he knows that the dough is 14 inches. He uses my dong as measurement.
I feel like this could have totally been a Better Call Saul reference.
Should do animal shaped chicken tenders
Looks so good!
you nailed it the 2nd time around, looks amazing. But mistakes are just as delicious!
what is the specific plastic wrap that you use?
Star baker! Love it, could you use custard?
In the bakery i used to work in i was the cinnamon roll guy, made about 10 dozen a day. We never frosted ours, i would put maple syrup and pecans on the bottom which became the top when flipped over to get them out, 7 in a 12 inch tray and thats how we sold them.
Someone please .. i beg you.. comment the ingredients in gramm/kilogramm etc..
First I finally buy your cookbook and then you upload? Best. Day. Ever.
Beef jerky from the Simpsons!
Hi Babish, don't know if you'll ever read this or even care, but in my location we don't have access to channel memberships and it's really depressing that I'm missing an upload because of it!
Babish they are releasing a fallout 76 cook book and was wondering if you’d make some recipes from it
I want to see the Monkfish Turkey from Malcolm in the Middle. Probably impossible.
Want a better flavour profile for the cinnamon rolls? Add a splash of vanilla and lemon extract to the frosting, and use only brown sugar in the cinnamon/sugar mix. I used to work at Cinnabon, and these were things we did there. Otherwise, everything is on point!
I can smell them lol
Make the cheesecake from friends
Bro why do u want so much fucking money from your fans you already have a Patreon for no reason, it’s not to fund your content you already make enough money to buy everything you need for your videos. Stop selling out and looking for every single oppurtunity to make more money and instead let YouTube be what it was meant to be in the first place which is a space for unique, creative content that is free for users.
Seems too creamy... adds cream. — ya boy Babish, 2018
I put a stick of melted butter on the cinnamon sugar mixture, before I roll it, it makes the rolls gooier, more like Cinnabon.
It's really interesting because the swedish recepie is kinda different but also the same. The dough is the same, but we also sread it with butter and then add the cinnamon and sugar. We cut it and then place them individually in a muffinpaper on a bakingsheet and put them in the oven. You could also switch the cinnamon for either vanilla and almonds or cardamon and sugar. Also we don't really put icing on them, that's weird.
Did rolling pin even buy you dinner? Monster
Anyone else think of Skyrim’s sweet rolls?
4:08 Too creamy? Add cream
OMG HE SHOULD DO THE “TO THE MAX” SANDWICH FROM WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
Please do Paddingtons orange jam
Hmmmmmm...... Too creamy....... Needs cream.
This guy is such a low key savage
So they are basically Chelsea Buns, just without the dried fruit and instead of a basic stock syrup glaze, a cream cheese frosting? Meh.
We can support him on patreon, now we can pay money in the channel also, and in addition to that watch videos that are sponsored and affect the content of the videos. We can buy his books and shop for things from his website. Are we done merchandising or not quite yet? I was a fan very early, but it has become concerning.
Sorry Babish but you missed a key ingredient You needed to spread a whole stick of butter on the flattened dough before you covered it in sugar. Trust me, I worked at Cinnabon for a couple of years.
Who else likes ikea cinnamon buns?
Thank you I've been craving cinnamon rolls
5:19 Jesus fucking Christ I just want to dive in there and build a shelter and have a family and kids and a happy life forever. Thank you
Too creamy - adds more cream
babish kinda reaching these days
Try going for the Swedish original: Butter the spread dough before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar mix, and instead of frosting sprinkle with granulated sugar. Also, crowd them even less - don't let them touch at all.
make foods from trailer park boys, to celebrate legalisation in canada
I've never not laughed harder than at that opening scene.
The frosting is a little TOO creamy, so let's add some cream. ??
That’s sweet that you learned from your mistakes, thank you!! Also, can you make a video on tempering chocolate? I’m trying to make some decorations for a birthday. Any help is appreciated! ??

Ill take all of them thanks
Have you made any vegan/vegetarian dishes before? I think that’d be pretty cool to see.
Am I the only millennial who knows who this amazing man whom we call Jim is?
Try Swedish cinnamon rolls, it's very similar but add cardamom in the dough (instead of lemon zest), mix the sugar and a lot of cinnamon with butter and spread that instead of sprinkle it on the dough. Brush them with egg instead of butter and sprinkle sugar nibs on them (no frosting). ??
thank you america for making it impossible to recreate any of your recipes. seriously who measures things in ounces?
When i saw the cinnamon rolls, i thought they were from Better Call Saul. Let's just say that so you don't have to make a video on them again
Please make the cup of joe from the polar express

HOT TAKE!!!! I LOVE THE CLEAR BOWL!!!.... Being able to see what is happening in the bowl really give me a better idea of what im looking for!! Not sure if you just got the bowl or I just noticed it but well done my friend!!
"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin" lmao
the fact that you put in your mistakes makes me think you dont actually make many in the other videos. I sometimes add too much milk to my bowl of cereal
Let me guess someone stole your cinnamon roll?
Do this more often. Show us your process and how many times it took you cooking the same meal to get it right.
How about secret life of Walter Mitty? There's cinnabon there
This looks awesome. I just can't get the logistics right on when I should start this in time for breakfast. Way early one morning? Or let it ferment overnight?
Would love to see you do a Collaboration with Mike Chen from Strictly Dumpling on different Chinese Food, since you both live in NYC ??

Make food from Red Dwarf!
I wanna see exclusive episodes!!! But I'm broke af!
My mom made the best cinnamon rolls. I really miss my mom. ??
You need to butter the inside before adding the spice mix, it helps the sugars caramelize and be extra gooey. Soak large golden raisins in a dark spicy rum, the longer the better, we usually go at least a year. Include those in the middle too, they become pockets of caramelized rum.
"Too creamy. Lets add cream" lol
Can you make a hot pocket out of cinnamon rolls? audible gasp Death pocket
DIDN'T sit in it, not legit
“ but if you ask me, a little too creamy” adds heavy cream
Your solo vids sound way happier than your sponsored ones btw
Thought it was cheese in the Thumpnail
This is so wierd. This is not at all how we do them in Sweden.
too creamy, let me just add some cream
Another great vid dude! Really enjoy your channel!
Could you do a Naruto episode please.
Brisket please (young Sheldon works)
Oh No! Andrew, I get the Monetization, of course, have the adverts pay you. I get the Patreon, let your loyal followers create your salary, all while absolutely having access to your episodes earlier than everyone else. BUT PLEASE don't start creating content on YouTube that I can only see if I pay a monthly subscription for your channel. 4.99 is a lot for just one channel when ALL of netflix is 7.99. I can't afford it as much as I think you deserve it. Why sell out on this when you've already been able to profit off of Monetization, Patreon, and the Blue Apron Sponsorship? I won't stop loving your show! I'm just a little disappointed.
Funny enough I was like I really want some Cinnamon rolls and here this is....I'm being tempted
Cinibun from the secret life of Walter Mitty
I used to manage a cinnabon when I was younger those things are the most unhealthy things ever but God are they delicious

“An excuse to make cinnamon rolls”? That offends me my good sir, there is no such thing as an excuse to make cinnamon buns, you make it because you want sweet, doughy, gooey delicious goodness
Could you brush the rolls with egg wash before baking instead of just butter?
So far your the only one giving special content like episodes to your members thats just mean to us with lesser money to not see your great cooking. That hurts since as far as i see your my only sub on youtube whos doing it like this.
"A little bit too creamy" "Gonna thin this out with some cream"
try them with sourdough starter!
Hey you should do a Wok special showing/celebrating the diversity of what can be cooked in wok as well as the special flavors and styles only a wok can produce! I guess that would be more of a basics with babish episode

You could have called this Cinnabuns from Daddy’s Home ^^the breakfast scene
Could you do garlic bread from Scott pilgrim vs the world
I've never been a patreon before but Babish makes me want to.
I had a dream where this was called binging with barrack and it was great
Honestly those ‘wrongly’ made cinnamon buns weren’t all that bad. I’d enjoyably consume them ??
Gotta unsubscribe, sorry Babish. I don't like that I have to watch ads, sponsorship messages and now I miss episodes if I don't pay extra. Best of luck to you.
"it's a little bit too creamy" .. **adds more cream**
I would love to Join your channel or support you on Patreon, but I am sadly poor. Any chance of releasing the "exclusive" content at a later time, like say six months after Patreon/Youtube subscribers get access? I try to support the channel with my Twitch Prime every month, I figure it's the least I can do, because you're one of my favorite content creators on YouTube. I say "one of" because you and FoodBusker are the only two channels I watch religiously (and god help me if you two ever get together for a collab)
How bout the Ed sauce from Good Burger

Can you make a really big cinnamon roll like a giant single lol
Please make Bill Gannon's barbecue sauce from Dragnet!
To make Cinnabon style you needed to roll that dough out to 14x28. Paper thin. That is how you get so many layers like they do.
This is the first time I've seen (or can remember) Babish advertise himself. More power to you, it's much deserved.
i'm pretty sure someone probably said this but I think the ultimate challenge for Babish to make is the edible strings from Mouse Trap.
Hey Babish! Love your stuff, got me in the Kitchen! Any chance you could make space food or have a space theme from Apollo 13, the Martian, etc? Would be awesome!
A little too creamy LETS ADD SOME CREAME

No mistakes, just happy accidents.

How is that a little known fact. It's the most obvious thing ever. You can see that it has been rolled just by looking at it.
I really like the idea of leaving mistakes in. People like me (who don't do baking very much) would love to see things that can go wrong, because I probably would've done the same things.

So I know someone with a dairy allergy (like anaphylactic shock serious if they have butter/milk/cheese), how would this work with margarine for the rolls and instead of a cream cheese icing making meringue and glazing it over about midway through cooking?
As a Halloween special or something..It would be awesome if you made some of the outrageous meals described in American Psycho.. ??
fuck mE UPPPPPP
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
WHY FROSTING ON THE CINNAMONBUN??!!
They look a little dry compared to cinnabon, don't they?
dangerous path that extra stuff, Babish. So long as you don't neglect to make a vid when you usually would for your regular subscribers I don't see any harm though.
Quit pronouncing the T in soften. You sound retarded.
Another thing you should have done is put butter inside lf them helps them unroll and they are just so much tastier
make something from food wars please god

Finally! Someone else uses a serated knife to cut cinnamon rolls! I like the idea of oiling the work surface and the rolling pin! I'll definitely give that a try when I make my caramel pecan cinnamon rolls next! Thanks for the video ????
When you were oiling the rolling pin, I could hear Cocktail Chemistry making his classic, "Shaking the shaker in a non suggestive manner" joke.
Hey um do the ribs from Norbit at the wedding scene
Is using the mixer essential or can i do this by hand???
sorry, a swed cant accept the way you guys make a cinnamon bun
Liked before watching because cinnaman roll
You need to spread soft butter before cinnamon and sugar! At least thats what we do in Finland, the home of cinnamon rolls ;) you can never have too much butter or sugar
Mmmmh kanelsnegl ??
I thought your first mistake was rolling the dough with cinnamon and sugar. Usually when I see cinnamon rolls made, it's more of a cinnamon paste rather than just the cinnamon sugar. But hey, it's your recipe.
Hey guys! Ever cook the pre-made Pillsbury cinnamon rolls? Hack: Use a muffin sheet if you want them individually cooked to perfection.

I need more Babish in my life??
I don't want you to do this. Don't make bonus episodes just for people that pay. You're not gonna make enough from this. It'll effect your upload time and your community. Trust me. It's not a good idea, you have enough money from Patreon and YouTube.
Sweet role from Skyrim next
Was that clip supposed to be funny at the beginning?
"Screwed up royally" = rolls were uneven and didnt frost fast enough
i like to think that this is an episode on better call saul
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!
Not from better call saul?
You can honestly just use powderd suggar and water for the frosting Tastes better in my opinion
@binging with babishyou should make cinnabon delights from taco bell
Mixture too creamy ? No problem, just add more cream !
You know, this idea of "I'll show you where I messed up so you don't repeat my mistakes" thing was a great touch. Shows you're not infallible and helps us avoid those same mistakes at the same time.
oh now you’ve done it
On what number should you set the mixer to

"once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." X'D i died.
2:17 lmao
You actually made 4 mistakes. For true soft and circular rolls use was free or very light waxed floss to cut the roll. Try it. My mom uses this technique when she makes cinnamon rolls and it will up your presentation by four levels guaranteed.
Great Job Babish!!!! They look fantastic! I challenge you to make them gluten free, my wife has celiac and can't eat your standard buns!!!
RIP - can you do a bonus recipe for an alternative frosting that has no cream cheese? Vanilla or another variant would be dope.
Aaw, I would’ve liked to see homemade hot pockets.
Can u put that intro song in again!!!
First mistake is just how we used to make ours growing up. Nostalgic.exe
Hey Babs! I love your videos. You should consider doing the food platter shown in Monster Hunter World. I'd love to see that feast come to life!
So now google/youtube doesn't pay you and we directly have to? This has become a lot worse than TV Cable subscription. I could get 2 channels for that price with 24 hr entertainment.
Better Call Saul Cinnabons
Okay, here a little bit of feedback: 1. I love that you put in the mistakes you made, it really shows a little bit more behind the thought process and entices you to experiment yourself. Maybe you can make a future episode, which shows the process of coming up with a recipe. 2. I kind of dislike the idea of the exclusive babish episodes. I myself am a patreon, so this doesn't apply to me, but I feel like the great and active members of the community get kicked out a little bit, if they can't afford to support monetarily. My feeling is, that this is a bit different from additional videos like Behind the Scenes or QnA. I dunno, I really would have liked to have all the content for everybody, I don't mind paying for people who can't. That's the end of my feedback, hope you're doing great =D EDIT: Wow, so many people take this to heart, really cool to see a relaxed and respectful discussion. To you Andrew, don't think I am mad, I don't think of you as a greedy person or something like that, it is only my own feeling of leaving some people behind. I can totally understand, that increasing the patreon incentive is a smart thing to do and probably YouTube requires some exclusive stuff, to be able to enable channel memberships. So whether you decide to stay at what you said, special episode for patreons and channel members, you decide to release them for everybody or you decide to release them to the public after 2 weeks or so, I stand behind you because I know that you are just a guy who is passionate for cooking and that is why I subscribed to you.
good video babbi!
louis ck's cinnabon bit was better but i get you can't use that
I've been watching your channel for a long time. I pay for some single serving content, but I think asking for 5 dollars a month to get exclusive episodes is crossing a line. I enjoy your videos, and watch ads. I'm slightly disappointed in this decision. Thanks for making great videos Babish.
The entire point of YouTube is that it’s free
Babish, what's makes cooking fun? Just wondering
When life gives you lemons, fuck up cinammon roles with it. Lel just an opinion
Mmm cinnamon bun my favorite after chocolate cake but before tres leches cake ????????????
Americans put cheese on everything... surprised it's not deep fried after baking.
As GOD intended lmaoo
babish is basic babish is binging
i think that was THE single most unfunny comedy routine i have ever seen.
For Cinnabon you need to use indonesian korintje cinnamon

“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” ????
I like when they grow into each other. it makes it more chewey than crispy.
I think my family are the only people who use dental floss to cut our cinnamon rolls...it baffles me, it's way better than a knife.
@babish you should of used a cinnamon sugar butter instead of sprinkling sugar cinnamon. It helps by adding more moisture to the rolls.
Im seeing all these new uploads but i still havent seen a proper naco video yet. Hmmm.
hmmm, a little too creamy. Better add some cream.
2:17 i see what you did there babby
Not as good as kanelbullar
Watching this at 12:45 AM. SO JEALOUS ????
How about making some of the mediocre-1970s English dishes from Fawlty Towers??
you should of used a clip from better call saul when he is working at the cinnabon
I know its cinnamon bun, but I miss going to the mall as a kid and watching people make pretzels.
You could have used Better Call Saul as your excuse. They even have a montage of him making the actual Cinnabons.

I feel like you used to make more effort sourcing the best ingredients and making it very gourmet. Now you just make basic recipes with ordinary ingredients.
Excuse you, did you just pronounce the "t" in soften?
but...wait...WHERE. IS. THE. BUTTER???? Arent' they supposed to be slathered with butter before dusting with cinnamon (AND SUGAR!)? That's how we do it in Sweden at least.
What's the difference between oiling a work surface and flouring it
The day has come!!! Thanks Babish!!!
Swedish cinnamon buns are the best. way easier to make and way tastier. (not as sweet as this version) but to each their own. :)
Started my diet yesterday Babish releases this video SHIT
Anyone else think he made these mistakes on purpose in order to make a more in depth video? Also was having trouble sleeping last night so decided to get to know my rolling pin, slept like a baby after that.
I love when you include your mistakes because I guarantee I'd make them
2:20 why do you want it to not stick to nothing? surely you want it to stick to nothing or not stick to anything? basacly you want it to stick to everything so why add the oil?
what if i dont have one of those fancy dough machines
For some reason cream cheese frosting make me feel sick unless I think of it for carrot cake
Wonder if consciously excluded to add in the Louis ck cinnabon bit
I've never requested a dish before, but know I know what I want. Do the pineapple upside down cake from the Penguins of Madagascar cartoon series.??
4:10 says frosting is too creamy adds cream
was that stand up meant to be funny?
watching this while eating chick fil a.... heaven

No no no! You should butter the bun dough before sprinkling on the sugar and cinnamon! It not only helps to keep the cinnamon-sugar inside the rolled up dough, but makes the bun itself taste so much better! All and all there’s too little butter in this recipe. Adding butter will help the dough rise and makes it taste way better!
Could've used skyrim....
Can’t wait to make these
Babish YES! Please do more stand up related dishes.
Babish is cashing in. Good for you
How about a short series on homemade versions of Chinese takeout? Like crab rangoon, orange chicken, lo mein, etc.
Oh for christsake. 4.95 a month to watch you cook? I better get a frigging cinnamon roll sent to my house each month then
Who else would joyfully eat that "mistake batch"?
Good call not using Louis CK's stand up for cinnamon rolls.
Could you stop using retarded measures like ounces for the rest of the world please?
Theres a REALLY good Cinnabon clone recipe floating around. It is my favorite one. THe cinnamon filling is more of a shmear though so its nice and gooey when warm.
I'm gonna gesture toward these cinnamon sticks.
swedish cinnamonbuns are better
Nice to see some mistakes! Thanks for keeping them in.
Mistakes happen, and are always enjoyable. Thanks for sharing. Some orange zest in the frosting is also a good thing. Works for Rice Krispie treats too.

God I love Jim Gaffigan, great to see some love for one of my favourite comedians
Ahhhhh!!! That looks so good!!!!
I haven't tried this recipe yet, but my mom does a few things a little differently so I thought I'll leave this here in case anyone wants to try it out: 1.) Butter the inside of your dough with melted butter before applying the sugar mixture. Don't use to much though or I guess they might come out greasy. 2.) Brush the top of your buns with eggwash or simply a beaten yolk instead of butter. 3.) I prefer powdered sugar on the buns instead of frosting them. The frosting is just too heavy and sweet for my taste. You could also try glazing them with a mix of powdered sugar and lemon juice, that's a popular option here in Germany. I don't have any measures, but just keep adding powdered sugar to your lemon juice and whisking it until you like the taste and have a smooth glaze. If you want more lemon flavor put some zest in aswell. And for some other variations you can put dried fruits or cocoa in the dough and use different fillings. Chopped nuts mixed with some sugar are great, or my personal favorite: a mix of poppy seeds, some milk and sugar.
What is the wrap on the bowls?

fuck you and your membership you greedy pig, yo already have advert friendly content and a patreon. YOU HAVE 3 MILLION SUBS seriously this membership thing is stupid and over-priced. I'm not spending 5 dollars every month for exclusive tiny pics of your face your douchebag. you have time for extra videos? why not give back extra content to your regular fan base? oh wait no you could charge hella money for that so noooo you have a drug problem or something? why do you need a patreon, channel memberships, and a massive income from your regular programming? how much money can a pig have?
Didn’t even watch the video, just came to say that cinnamon rolls are my favorite food

I love cinnamon buns. However, I would really really recommend adding heavy cream instead of butter brushed to the top before baking. It makes them extremely soft and more similar to that mall place that is known for selling buns.
For a swedish take on the classic cinnamon roll: mix cinnamon and sugar with room temperatured butter, spread out evenly before rolling up the dough. make's the roll much more moist and tasty. Don't line up in a deep dish, put them spaced out on lined baking tray. Wipe down with melted butter och one beaten egg, cover in decor sugar (is that what it's called?) Don't wait until cooled down from the oven, consume way to many, feel stuffed but know that it's worth it.
Plz make food
hey how about making the Nobby Buns and the Brownie topping recipes from the end credits of the film , Hot Shots?
"Too creamy" then proceeds to add heavy cream
Question, am I the only one that thought the mistake was NOT putting a layer of butter on the dough before the cinnamon sugar mix? Or is that a southern thing? I mean I come from a long line of southern big mammas, and heaven forbid you not put butter in that dough!

well done. i'm glad you caught your mistakes and fixed them. i was definitely cringing when i saw you making those mistakes... i find, you don't really need to thin out the cream cheese icing if you ice right away after the buns come out of the oven... the residual heat immediately softens and melts the cream cheese icing...

I really appreciate you putting your failed attempt in this video as a method for teaching!

Thanks for keeping it real and reminding us that cooking can be trial and error :)

I work at a cinnabon, those buns are between the size of a mini and a classic size, we actually cut and frost them right when they come out of the oven (which you frosted but didn't cut them), we have a metal spatula that is serrated on one side so when we cut them we aren't pinching them, plus we are told that when we roll them that the swirl must have at least wrap around 5-6 times, and we don't use oil when rolling the dough we use flour, idk if you want any of this info, I know from the standup he specifically said cinnabon, but those cinnamon rolls look 100000% better than the ones we make at work and I'm gonna use that recipe sometime

Cutting the dough with a knife misshaped the buns! Cut them by wrapping them with twine and pulling the ends quickly
Please always do it like this when you screw up. But yeah, 5 bucks a month ain't happening. You're cool but you're not as useful as Spotify.
Maybe you should do some more food wars, the last one was amazing
Listen Bab, I love ya and your recipes, but you need to put butter inside of the cinnamon rolls. You can’t just sprinkle some loose cinnamon sugar onto the dough! You need either lather that dough in some butter (melted or soft works) and then sprinkle OR mix the soft butter right into the cinnamon sugar to create a cinnamon paste.
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that good ole Babby completely screwed up the Naco
So who actually prefers a cinnamon bun over a stickey bun?
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin.” ??????
Why do you not give a fuck about the audience using real units?

A time lapse of the dough growing would a be cool for future episodes
Now a premium membership does sound nice. I'm happy to see you're doing great man.

Hey babish, this might seem like a dull idea but it's been something I've wanted since 2005 and they discontinued the product in the UK but is there any chance you can see about making turkey twizzlers? they were a favourite during my childhood and if there is a way to recreate them I'd love to try it.
You should try the Cherry Glazed Rack of Lamb from "How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days"!
I am so freaking happy you did an episode on cinnamon rolls!!! Since they are my all time favourite food! You know you could have also picked Better call Saul since he's a manager in a Cinnabon.
Please try to collab with Alton Brown! You guys are my two favorite food people!
Can you try to find a dish from dragon ball z for thanks giving
You should make Chidi's Peeps and Chilli from The Good Place
Uh mistake number 1 was not putting butter before rolling. Wtf
Here is where you messed up. You have to add small pads of butter evenly distributed along with the cinnamon sugar mixture then roll it up and proceed as normal. As the rolls cook the butter melts and mixes with the cinnamon and sugar and creates a candy caramel coating that flows to the bottom of the buns and makes them Elevate to a whole new level.
and im back as a subscriber no cheesy commercial :D this is the banging with babish i love to watch <3
Please do food from skyrim or fallout. Sweet rolls and sugar bombs :P
I get you want to make a living out of youtube and i still will watch all of your vids and i still love your channel but making me miss out on hot pockets God damn
Please do the feast from "Fantastic Mr. Fox" or another Wes Anderson movie
Make the cheesesteaks from Creed!!!
or go buy one at cinnabon
As a swede these buns/rolls dissapoint me, but its Babish so its okay.
Mistake number two was still followed, try making them on a sheet without them touching. Also you should make monkey bread (any flavor) I think with help it’d join the clean plate club
So you made finnish bostoninkakku minus the frosting
If you could make the turtle or dragon bread from the 17th episode of Yakitate Japan that would be impressive.
Watching this makes me hungry for cinnamon rolls. Also, apparently, my cat loves to watch your videos and loves your voice o.O
Slightly disappointed that it wasn't bean bagchair sized. 8/10
Way to little cinnamon in that mixture might as well call it brown sugar roll! Swedish cinnamon buns are way better ??
This is not how me make them in Sweden ??
I have watched your ENTIRE channel in like 3 days. You are incredible ????????

Babby you made content exclusive with a pay wall. That defeats the point of YouTube come on now. It's okay though because you make an effort to put out public videos frequently so it's no Biggie. Please don't make all your content behind a paywall in the future though
You should do Chicken Pinciotti from That 70’s Show.
I thought with cinnamon rolls you're supposed to cut them with an unflavored floss or string since a knife would make the dough in the spirals stick together

Nitpicking with Babish.
These Memberships really do me in... if every channel does them and you want to see this extra content, you will spend a fortune when you pay 5 $ a month for each channel you like and want to be able to see this stuff. I really don‘t understand this anymore - YT was for free and now we have Premium Memberships that also costs monthly... that all just ain‘t fun anymore in my book. Love BwB but I feel like paying for cable TV these days here on YT.
@Binging With Babish, if you were to spread making these starting night before, could you do first proof overnight in fridge, then simply roll, cut, and final proof in morning?

The good place chidi Do his chilly it is in one of the 1st 3 episodes on season 3 it is on netflix
We used to put the in aluminum muffin tins at work, paint them with butter, then wrap and freeze. Then as we needed them we could pop out a tin, chuck it in the proofer, and then bake them off for the best cinnamon bun french toast you could ever imagine!
Absolutely loved seeing the mistakes on this. They taught me so much and I am sure not thinks less your skill and the entertainment of your videos. Great job and thank you so much.
Man, I have had cinnamon buns on my mind. There is this place I go that makes cinnamon twists and I can’t figure out how they make the twist.
im gay
Babish is on a roll
I don't like American cinnamon buns. Frosting should not be there it just overpowers everything else and just makes it taste like sugar. I like the swedish ones
Too creamy? Add cream!
My god its magnificent

Can you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Daredevil?
bab ish
I used to work a Cinnabon. Not a perfect recreation but still looks good. You missed the crucial step of buttering the dough before spreading the cinnamon and sugar mixture. I guess the melted butter step kind of replaces that. Rolling away from you looks awkward, we we're all trained to roll toward us.
Is that reusable plastic wrap?
4:10 cooking just makes so much sence the stuff is too creamy so what do you do add cream genious also really cinnamon rolls ( imade them with my mum following this video :ok hand:)

Make some dishes from naruto like the ramen
I hate to tell you Babish, but you used the wrong recipe this time. The only cinnamon bun recipe worthy of being present amongst a table of gods is the cinnabon clone recipe on google. It is fluffy and moist and springy in ways the human mouth does not fully appreciate until you bite into one of these bad boys. Its also the first recipe I actually changed and didn't completely destroy. It calls for 600g strong bread flour but if you use 400g only and another 200g of fine sponge cake flour the dough is even more bubbly and delectable. You definitely need to try this.
I could go for some of those Hooooot Pooockeeeeets.

Am I missing out? I've never seen a glass bowl on a stand mixer.
americans always ruin things
This looks great, but i thought the point was to attempt to make The Cinnabon? The ones you made are tiny. A true Cinnabon should be huge! It should make you question your life's decisions. A true Cinnabon is what the great comedian and pervert Louis C.K. called a "fat fuck treat". The ones you made look far too healthy. Perhaps change the title of the video to "Healthier Cinnamon Rolls"
I made some cinnamon rolls a while back for a project and made the EXACT same mistakes you did. Thanks for this video!
Dang, I thought this was gonna be the size of a bean bag chair
Lol, Andrew apologising for screwing up the first batch like we wouldn't definitely go in on them anyway
Nice video as always! Could you do some foods from Tom and Jerry? For instance, the Bouillabaise in Jerry and the Goldfish.
The cinnamon rolls look delicious but what I really want to know is where I can get that sweet watch.
I guess every YouTube account has to change at some point. Sad to see this one do the same. Now we got to play for certain videos? You turned into one of those girls on tinder that has a premium Snapchat...
Make the pancakes John Candy made in Uncle Buck
What about the jimmy neutron purple flurp?
This channel members thing seems like abit of a YouTube after thought to compete with or At least merge patreon features. I follow four people who have it now and honestly $15 a month for YouTube videos and a sticker or two seems expensive.
Please the good place episode!
I wish i can grab those cinnamon rolls from my phone
I think Louis C.K. described Cinabunns much better, but I guess he's a non-grata still.
Babish has so many cute, random and downright hilarious quotes I'd wear on shirts Everything burrito: it's not the amount of meat, it's how you treat the meat Any video that includes Worcestershire sauce: a hilarious attempt in pronunciation This video: After you Physically and Philosophically wash your hands!

It always fascinates me how different American cinnamon rolls are from Swedish ones. I just don't get it. There are few things as good as a good, proper cinnamon bun, but to then make them all giant and baked together into a slab and slathered in painfully sweet frosting? Probably the biggest food related culture shock I've ever experienced tbh ??
Wow I don't have anything to make this
“Once you’ve gotten to know your rolling pin” lol
Thats a nice wrist watch. +10 points
Hot Take: You could have picked a better comedian and a better show by making the Cinnabons from Better Call Saul. Bob Odenkirk is a national treasure.
'a little too creamy' Adds heavy cream
Yum yum Cinnabon ??
Spaghetti Tacos from ICarly. GO!
bro butter on frosting?? thats a no for me
Could have just done a basics on pastries instead of reaching like this
Get to know your rolling pin ( ?° ?? ?°)
That's not at all what I picture when I think cinnamon rolls/buns
Louis C.K. did a great take on that too in his standup. Since I watched it I cannot force myself to eat another one of those.
I've never seen someone make the filling with dry cinnamon and sugar, I've always done it and seen it by mixing the two powders with softened or melted butter. I'mma try the dry mix next time! Also! I might join just for the hot pockets episode!!

Two way that Andrew gets to excuse himself to make a thing: 1) Make a Basics episode out of it. 2) Use the smallest mention of it to make an episode.

Do you have a video breaking down the accessories you have on your mixer that I missed? From what I can tell, you're using a lot of the basics, but as I just got my wife a stand mixer recently, we've been tackling some of your dough recipes and would love some advice/tips on good things to have for it all.

Your excuse should have been Better Call Saul
That tiny spatula though
Do the napolitan pasta from Girls und Panzer
I love synonym rolls ??
It looked perfect.... Until you said “cream cheese frosting” :’(
Make some one piece dishes
A bit too creamy adds cream
""special episodes for $5 a month" finally a premium program I'm willing to subscribe to
Wayyyy better than the ones I had at school.
But does anyone know how they make it so gooey!
i was really hoping that this youtube membership thing wouldn't start the trend of creators having exclusive videos to those people who pay for it. but i guess it was only a matter of time before stupid shit like that happened.
Can you please narrate audio books?
that drip of icing made my morning
channel membership...
Bibadi bobadi Bacon!!!
I am now so hungry I want to eat the world. NEED cinnamon rolls!
Make Halloween caramel apples
2:16 "Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin..." I see what you did there, lol.
Dude, you should just make a Jim Gaffigan special.
wow yummy
wait wait wait, let me get this straight. You said the icing was "too creamy" and to thin it you added cream. dafuq!!!!!
"sofTen"
Can you post recipes in metric for the rest of the world?
Omg ... so delicious
Can you make Burple Nurples from Chowder?
You should make Chief Wiggum’s chili with the ‘merciless pepper of Quetzalacatenango’
I like how you admit to mistakes and then show how to correct them.
My buns are toasty from just watching this
Cover me with icing babish
You should have made it from better call saul
Emojis Babish? Emojis? Really?
I understand Youtube is going downhill and you need to do different things to get more revenue, but the day content goes behind a paywall is the day i shed a little tear.
Cinnamon buns is my kind of treat
Impressive, but can you make the ET Malt from the movie Paul?
Could you make pickle rick!!!!!!
What brand is that watch you’re wearing?
Do I have to use instant yeast? All I have on hand is pizza yeast.
alright guys lets be real how much ass do you think babish gets
Hey, this might be abit to ask for, and I don't think you'll read all the comments, but I'm finding these really hard to follow. And by this I mean all recipes because I'm Gluten Free. Celiac makes cooking really hard and I would love it if you could make some dough or break or cake that was gluten free. Thanks for the hours of delicious looking entertainment ??
I like to think of these from the Louis CK stand up (love gaffigan too) Gimme the jizz syrup!! ??
It'd be really cool if you did the spaghetti al nero di seppia from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency!
How do you philosophy wash your hands?
Use mineral oil! It helps with the sticky dough and its flavorless.
Jim Gaffigan is hilarious
I miss the times when I can still eat cinnamon rolls ??
Since the cinnamon bun originates from Sweden/Denmark, you should try the Scandinavian recipe! It's super simple, almost the same as you did. Add some ground cardamom to the cinnamon mixture (maybe half around 33/67 with cardamom/cinnamon). Then slice them a bit thinner, about 3/4 of the thickness you did. Then they need to be baked completely separated from each other, so they turn out as individual beautiful cinnamon buns. And final step: ABSOLUTELY NO FROSTING! That is blasphemy. But instead, before baking: brush them with some beaten egg and sprinkle on some pearl sugar/nib sugar and then bake. Voila, authentic Swedish cinnamon buns :)
Ok I think this stretching the theme of the show a bit. I think babish just really wanted to make cinnamon rolls
Hello, everyone, my grandmother and I put our hearts into making food videos. We joke around as well ;D The videos are really good! We would appreciate, if you check them! :)
@2:17 nice
Looks good but cannot measure up to a woman I know, she is from the south so maybe that’s why lol. Whenever she takes in orders it’s a minimum or 17 preorders. But yes I can see why they made it too the clean plate club, too many people don’t bake them right and they end up dry and crusty, yuck!
I'm drooling over my work desk??
In Sweden we actually have a thing where we overcrowded the cinnamon rolls on purpose to create kind of a cake and it's delicious. We also mix the sugar and cinnamon with butter.
Them buns are money, honey. Now, can we do dishes from say... i dunno....Teletubbies?
Hey I get that movies and tv shows and stuff are great inspiration for recipes...but haven't you ever wanted to know what a Sweet Roll from Skyrim tastes like?
I really appreciate showing the "failed" batch. Showing that everyone makes mistakes and cooking isn't a one-and-done deal helps build confidence in budding chefs.
You have to try a Franzbrötchen from Germany! it is the best cinamon rolle/bread you will ever try! :D
Absolutely love your channel. Happy being the free subscriber though.
those are some nice buns you have there
My icing is too creamy so I'm going to add... cream!
Oh you a freak freak Babish with them sexy cinnarolls ??
Who's just here to watch and not actually make these ????
Please do a ‘Chowder’ special
thank you
I don't even care, i will eat anything babish makes. I would marry this man.
Maybe do something KETO friendly? I really love all your episodes, I just can't eat them lol
I'm just glad you didn't sit on them without pants on.
You can just make a basics vid we dont care as long as we get a video
Paid channel membership. So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.
A lot of the time I see how you do things in proximity to how I stuff things up in the kitchen and this made me feel a lot better, thank you
Hoooooooooot pockeeeet
Lucky Bastard Roommates! "Hey Babbs, I think you can do better. Reshoot."
This thumbnail made my pants stiff and my stomach growl. ??
Watching this episode mad the following line pop into my head: "Let me guess, someone stole your Sweetroll...."
Can we get a trailer park boys episode
Add some lemon juice to your cream cheese icing it makes it way better
"gotten to know your rolling pin" ????
Can you do something from My Little Pony? Like a Cherrychanga, or Chimicherry, or ChimiCherryChanga!!!
TurBriskaFil from The Big Bang Theory
What brand of Cling Film does he use? that shit sticks to everything!
Rather Membershits than Blue Aproprobullshit
A special based on the food of the animated Miyazaki films would be pretty amazing!
Your first try, wansnt a mistake, in fact I think Its great for a group of People if served in slices, like a cake
Early
Could you maybe write down the recipe?i'd like to try those cinemon rolls but it is really annoying to look it up in the video:(
Omg, is that Tiny Whisk's long lost cousin Tiny Spatula? ... I just realised those would be dope rapper names.
Ive been waiting for this video for far too long.
The depth of field is WAAAY too narrow, I really like the look but it feels really weird when you are blurred aswell, i think just keeping the background in bokeh would look much better
no hot pockets?
Should've done Cinnamon Rolls from Better Call Saul ??
synonym rolls
Emoji story ??????????????????????????????????????????????
I was hoping they were from Better Call Saul
haha Louis CK also had a Cinnabun bit.
the wheat allergy inside me is crying
We want the intro back!
This is hilarious. I just woke up and popped open a store bought cinnamon roll can and then I saw this when I scrolled through my youtube feed.
Do an Apicicus recipe!
What happens when you run out of food to make off tv shows?
Random suggestion, do the bento box that kills the scientist from the movie Isle Of Dogs (anybody who has watched the movie knows what i mean)
Hey Babish, so my wife is allergic to eggs. What would be a good generic replacement ? I always get so sad when any desert recipe you make contains eggs ! Thanks in advance.
There needs to be a M*A*S*H episode. Can do Adam's Ribs, Spam Parmesan, Water Buffalo steak, and wash it all down with Swamp-style gin.
Yasss papi
BABS! What kind of watch it that?!
i mean you couldve used a scene with no context that just shows a cinnamon roll and i think we would have been fine with the vid
4:09 "Too creamy" proceeds to add more cream
Cream cheese?! CREAM CHEESE!!! SUMMON DAVID SEYMOUR.
Too Creamy??? Adds Cream
I wish you didn't make episodes membership exclusive :/
Louie CK's bit was funnier
Hey my man babish, i suffer from cronic insomnia and so for about three years i've been watchin your show instead of looking at the ceiling and despairing . You've been a massive help over the years. Any chance in one of your vids you could say "chris says hi elise." its your channel, you do you, but it'd trip my gf out and so i'd really dig it. Do you like black dynamite?
This guy is so unfunny "Hey I'm a fat dad who naps a lot" So hilarious -_-
I’m pretty sure you just wanted an excuse to make cinnamon buns Ok i just checked the description and i was right
I prefer danish pastry
Could have used the clip from better call Saul!
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin.." Yeah, Babish.. I caught that.
How do you wash dishes with sticky dough tho
Home brewing with Babish???
Could you do Wilson Fisk's omelette from Netflix's Daredevil??
liked the mistakes in the vid.
Kinda sad, that you would make some videos exclusive for the members. Wouldnt it work quite well if you let the members watch the videos way earlier than your normal subscribers and then make them available to everyone a month or so later ?
I love fresh, out of the oven, sweet, sticky Cinnamon Buns that has sugar glazed all over it
FINALLY
Thank you. Now I want but don't wanna make.
If I tell you.. can you make the biriyani from Cheeni Kum? It's a bollywood movie btw..
Did you just pronounce the "t" in soften? 5:16 hehe "cooooooool whhhheeep"
Sorry babish. YSAC uploaded but I'm back
Please Make "TurTurkeyKey" from How I met Your Mother for your thanksgiving special
You should do a series of videos on school lunches. We used to have these Italian dunkers that you could probably perfect.
Better Call Saul
So, boys'n'gals, sit and enjoy a story of cinnamon roll (CR) heaven. Li'l old me, barely 23 years of age was taking a vacation in the states, driving up from Frisco to Seattle with my family. (I'm originally from Germany and have only heard of CR pureness at that point.) We stop at the tiniest private-owned gas station, go inside to pay for the gas. The owner's that big, beardy, tattooed dude who'd pass as an actor in Sons of Anarchy any day. He's got the usual assortment of snacks, hot dogs and this tray of cinnamon buns. I'm curious (and still hungry) and buy one of those. I go outside, take a bite, stop, take another bite and then turn around on my heels to buy two more of those for the others. Not only were they delicious, but the guy was very nice and happy too as I told them that they were awesome - he made them himself (or his wife did, something like that). We chatted for a while, I bought more of them for my family and then we drove off. I forgot his name and I'll probably never find that heavenly place again but thank you, unknown dude, for the best cinnamon rolls in my entire life. Keep doing gods work.
Wow. Jim Gaffigan’s Comedy is good for something I guess....
Will definitely be trying this next week
You mean your not going to to reap the rewards of ad revenue by making the failed attempt a second video?
From Fallout 3 ?!
I looked up to you man!
'this is too creamy, so im going to add cream' ???????????
.... why am I in class I need to go and get stuff for this lol
'Thinks cream cheese mixture is too creamy' 'adds heavy cream to make it less creamy'
Sam I wanna synonym roll
Hot cross buns
Damn i want babby to glaze me
Babs, ya need to make one of the meals from Spirited Away! Cause daaaamn that would be amazing.
As a Swede it hurts every part of my body watching this version of cinnamon roll
Help me heal my broken leg faster
Plzz do brisket from young sheldon
U should have used the footage of Louis C.K. talking about cinnamon buns
God, making cinnamon rolls based on a cinnamon roll lover's description... I'm down
"Channel Membership is only available to..." Aaaa Babish I wanna joiiiin ?? also I've been craving cinnamon roll for months so this is like premonition to me
Was that comedian suppose to be funny?
Should have made the cinnamon roll from van wilder
Just had my first cinnamon roll today. They dont sell it here. Then yesterday just found a bakery that sells some.

Homemade hot pockets?? Just looks like a pasty from Greggs ????
Until creamy
Well Sunday night I really wanted to make cinnamon rolls.. now pops a new video from you on cinnamon rolls! I guess it's mandatory now ??
Dammit, & I just ate breakfast. Also, are we gonna get Shrimp Part 2 & are we gonna get some dishes from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?
You should try to make and eat an Every Pizza Place Salad from Family Guy.
"A little too creamy..." Adds cream
Suggestion: lunches from "The Breakfast Club"!
Is that a daydate?
"Thin it a little with heavy cream." ??
Can you make Tsukune's Shantai Curry from Rosario Vampire?
I just can’t do CREAM CHEESE frosting on Cinnamon Roll, it feels like I’m trying to add a flavor that has no business being in a Cinnamon Roll. If it’s not a vanilla frosting from scratch, it’s just not worth it.
Do the lentil soup recipe hidden in Baby I’m Amazed at the end of Simpsons episode featuring Paul McCartney.
Wait how do I philosophically wash my hands
louis ck cinnabom bit was wayyyyyyy better.
Have you made soft pretzels??? MAKE AUNTIE ANNE'S SOFT PRETZELS!!!????????

That clip at the beginning wasn’t even remotely funny.
Babs.....i literally screamed an orgasmic "YES!" when i seen the pull apart. Bravo good sir??????
Yeah, this is reminiscent of when I first made cinnamon rolls. Except I burned mine in the oven thinking they weren’t done enough. And I made them on a baking sheet rather than a pan.
Can you please make power puff girls?
please do the gum drop pizza from Aladdin!
"It's a little creamy so we're gonna add some cream to even that out."
As if you needed an excuse to make cinnamon rolls.
Cinnamon Jizz
Coulda gone with better call saul as your reference
i like bread
As a swede this makes me very uncomfortable. This is not how we do it. What is this? Dry yeast?Where's the butter on the inside?! THE FUCK IS A CREAM CHEESE FROSTING?! (admittedly this is probably an American cinnamonroll, which of course would be different than the Swedish one. I'm not even sure they're originally Swedish, but I'm gonna pretend that they are until someone tells me otherwise.)

Why do you keep using the unit ounces when referring to solids? My understanding is that ounce is a unit for liquids not solids, so saying ounce of butter just makes things for confusing for the international fan

I never thoguht i would face palm myaelf while watching your vids but this time you had it coming with all of those rookie mistakes in the beginning
JOJO!!!
You should do a seres called blunders with babyish
Over here, we bake the buns on a large sheet, so they don't stick together. And we sprinkle the buns with pearl sugar or chopped nuts before baking, not tonnes of fat sugary frosting.
You should make the Paunch Burger dinner for breakfast burger combo. (Looks like an oversized triple bacon thickburger from Hardee’s/Carl’s Jr, a monstrous helping of chili cheese fries, and a regular size(128 oz) chocolate milkshake.
Let me Cinnamon your Rolls kids

Mr Babish how about of Benson's chili from regular show
On next episode from Hannibal
Ive never been so excited for a BwB. I love cinnamon rolls but its impossible to find good ones, let alone make them (for me at least)
Cream cheese frosting > all other kinds. Almost every cinnamon roll I have had has that terrible powdered sugar and a little water for icing, no where near as good.
Hey I just wanted to say thank you.. for bringing back my love of cooking. I'm proud to say that I am now back in the kitchen becaus I find it fun again. And not just to survive
This was THE Christmas breakfast for my family for many many years. I miss those days
”Once you’ve gotten to knowing your rolling pin...”
If you weren't such a coward, you could've made this into an episode on replicating Cinnabon's recipe.
5:25 Now THESE are what I call precious cinnamon rolls!
I wish he made more of a glaze instead of a frosting
I love making cinnamon buns all the time. Now the guy who first inspired me to cook has made them, I love it. Also the way he makes it is completely different to the way I do. I am so going to try it out and see how they compare.
Hot nut on a bread snake.
jim gaffigan is (in my opinion) one of the most underrated comedians out there. he is so funny in such a unique way and every time i watch his comedy specials i laugh until i cry basically. maybe next time you can try making a ? hooottt pocketttt ? :)
“This seems too creamy, let me add some heavy cream”
Can you make hot pockets next?
Hey Babish. I'm a long-time subscriber of your channel from Korea and I've noticed that you haven't done anything from my country. So, i was wondering if you would make an episode about the dumplings from "Old Boy"(the original one, of course). Thanks!
Cream cheese too creamy --> add cream ??
I feel old because this could have been from Mitch Hedberg's stand up.
Cool
Would you rather buns of steel or buns of cinnamon?
Jim Gaffigan lives in NYC. You could have had him on the show. You can make Hot Pockets with him.

Cinnamon rolls are precious and delicious. Like...sweet doughy gold. You NEED to drown it in icing though. If you don’t, you’re not eating it right.
Too creamy, let's add some more cream.
Home made hot pockets? Remove from box, throw directly in toilet. How hard is that?

I decide to make cinnamon scroll for the first time on Monday. They didn’t rise much were also quite hard on the outside and I also didn’t have enough icing sugar to make the glacé. But they still tasted okay

You are running out of ideas bud
THANK YOU for not deleting the failed footage, it helps new cooks more than you think!
The only mistake with first attempt was to cut it. It was nice cinnamon-rolls-cake...
I would suggest more cold rise on these. The best cinnamon rolls have a lot in common with beer than bread. I enjoy Alton Brown's recipe, but I think Betty Crocker cookbook and several others have this method as well which is far superior in my book to these quick rolls
Can you make Mom’s Spaghetti from 8 Mile?

babish!! can you make something from the movie The Hundred Foot Journey??? it's a movie about food, I know, but there are so many cool things in it.
A little bit too creamy - I'm going to thin this out with heavy cream? WTF?

How the hell didn't you use Better Call Saul for this. HOW????!!
You should just make "Kanelsnegle" they are very similar, but not quiiiite the same. (A danish "Cinnamon roll")
Hey babish love the vid. I do have a neat little accompaniment to your cinnamon gooey roll of yummness. My wife makes the best cinnamon rolls...I dont care who here argues it. My wife is the Angelina Jolie...of the cinnamon roll-y. Anyways chef John joke aside. She uses maple syrup to sweeten the batter and coffee in the cream cheese frosting. I have never wanted to cry just thinking about them...now I need her to go make me some.
d'egg
Make Cucumber Sandwiches and/or Peppermint Iced Tea from Hilda!
I feel like mistake number 1 was not using a butter and cinnamon sugar mixture. Creating a paste, or buttering the dough and sprinkling with the cinnamon sugar.
Make Stupendous Stew from Super Mario Odyssey!
How does this dude not get fat
If you want more cinnabun style buns whip your butter and sugar and cinnamon together as a paste and then spread it super thin and sprinkle with more cinnamon
Do a fallout special: sweet rolls, iguana bits(?), Sunset sasparilla, sugar bombs etc
Make the 3 course meal chewing gum from Willy Wonka! And then make the lemonade that makes you float. :D

Babish is a beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too pure
Danes here are shook

Jim gaffigan is one of the best comedians. I love his show and I respect how much of a gentleman he truly is when his wife got terrible sick and he took care of her. That is relationship goals.
Hey governor cheerio
Never watch BWB while hungry, never watch BWB while hungry, NEVER WATCH BWB WHILE HUNGRY
Nice to know everyone screws up sometimes. Muffin trays work great for baking cinnamon rolls.
Still waiting on cherry pie from Twin Peaks...
It's too creamy... add cream.
These look horrible !
I prefer Louis CK’s version of Cinnabon....)
Watched "This is not what I expected" the other day. Lots of good looking food, in what I can only describe as a Chinese screw ball comedy
Babish, I'm trying to renovate my kitchen, and I was hoping to install a good solid work surface for cutting, kneading, just generally working on stuff before cooking properly--but all the kitchen outlets I've been to keep telling me that such a thing isn't worth doing and that I should always use a cutting board/surface protector? Could you tell me how you do it/what it is, or is it just a case of "whatever, don't care, I'm going to be getting a lot of use out of this and if it gets ruined, I'll replace it?"
Who needs an excuse to make cinnamon buns? Love the fail footage to show us how the recipe is developed; we've been trying that ourselves.
Going home and trying to make these now
Indeed God never intended for cinnamon rolls to be cut??
??
You could of said it was from the Secret life of Walter Mitty
Do anime now
This could've been from Better Call Saul.
I really like this format! I love it when people include their mistakes and this recipe sounds delicious.
This is why I prefer baking caramel rolls, you pour the caramel in the baking pan first and then flip the whole thing over once baked. Simple easy and efficient
I wish every episode was 30 minutes long
You know what? I'll take it because I want to make cinnamon rolls too.
Andrew!! I think it would be amazing if you did a react video to some of the videos on You Suck At Cooking's channel!! His videos are pretty funny and random, with some cooking thrown in. ????
Mistakes or not to be honest they looked fantastic either way kinda like that very home made look and texture
Hey Babi, try the argentine dish 'milanesas con puré' from the argentine movie 'El Angel'
"Sweet Bread A La Gusteau (good and bad version)" from Ratitouille
so can i point out we were a few episodes into season 2. then this episode is season 1.
Lost opportunity to gesture towards a giant bowl of sugary cinnamon roll goo. Could you please do your own take on the Fiesta Burrito with Chili and Eggs that Dan Aykroyd makes for Robert Stack in the food truck scene from Caddyshack 2?

Oh man the way you worked that rolling pin turned me on a little Also you should do a LoTR themed episode with rabbit stew, lembas bread, and a huge second breakfast full of all hobbit foods.
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
I make cinnamon rolls all the time but I can never get the frosting right. Thank you for the recipe. I’m gonna try it!
My friend. My family makes dozens of large cinnamon rolls every Christmas as gifts. Do yourself a favor, before adding the Cinnamon Sugar, do a thin coating of room temperature butter to the dough. Trust me, it's butter... I mean... better!
You should make the ink spaghetti from Jojo’s bizarre adventure
Can he just he picked up by Netflix or something major? He fucking deserves it! Imagine him and Alton Brown cooking together!
You don't need any excuses to make cinnamon rolls.
improvement! using a glass bowl to be able to see the process!
I think Cream Cheese frosting on cinnamon rolls is blegh, but i’d still eat urs babs. Also you should do food from Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
Hey Babish, will you post the homemade hot pockets on YouTube as well? Doesn't seem fair for us guys who can't afford to spend 5 dollars a month
"Getting to know your rolling pin" bit got me haha
Is that a new apron?
A bit too much frosting for my taste
What's the stuff being used to cover the rolls while they proof?
hoooooot pocket.
Oh hey Babi got himself a new shallow dof bokehlicious lens!
I prefer Louie's description but Jim's is good too
I'm just saying Babish Food Wars is a treasure trove of content for you. Also they did an episode with bear meat which would be super interesting to see you cook.
“I screwed up royally” still makes a great cinnamon roll that’s like an A- instead of an A+
I need these now
U should recreate Walnut Date Loaf from Captain America Civil War
Make "sandwiches" from How I Met Your Mother
I like your new watch Andrew.

Could you make some dishes from jojo's bizarre adventure like Ink spaghetti or anything Tonio makes?
"The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing."
Paul Walker’s tuna no crust plssss
"The icing was too creamy, so I thinned it out with some heavy cream." Is this an oxymoron or just irony?
awwww lol love this channel so much
( DRAMATIC MUSIC KICKS IN ) THE TIME HAS COME MY FELLOW CINNAMON BUN(or rolls) LOVERS
I’m watching this while walking to my 0 period
Mistake #4: sugar and cinnamon are to be mixed with room temp butter and then spread on the dough not sprinkled. Plus a good helping of roughly ground cardamom in the dough gives an extra aromatic touch.
Haha, you should have made a Cinnabon the size of a Beanbag chair ??
I used to work at Cinnabon and we would only put 6 buns in the pan you first used and we put them in diagonally. Also they made a HUGE deal about frosting while hot but not over frosting lol. "we sell Cinnabon, not cupcakes"
Ah the scraping the bottom of the barrel portion of babish. The best ones!
I want Babish to pour cream cheese frosting on me.
"It's too creamy, so I'm going to add cream."
i literally made cinnamon rolls last night
Is this what Americans consider "comedy"?
thank you for showing your mistakes, when you follow a recipe it usually doesn’t tell you the things that you’ve shown in this video.
American cinnamon rolls are disgusting. Looks like someone came all over them.
I thought he was talking about what is colloquially called Monkey Bread or Sticky Buns. I love making money bread.
I mean.... What else can I say besides it was a 10/10 video
Too creamy? No problem, just add cream! :^)
Cinnamon rolls without chili? I knew you city-folk were odd, but I didn't think you were barbarians.
I loved seeing the revisions here - cinnamon rolls have been one of my favourite things to bake since the time a friend taught me how. I'm looking to try a cardamom version from Sweden next! As ever, I will beg and plead and promise unto half my kingdom for an episode on the No-Face Feast from Spirited Away. Please feed your gluttonous children, Mr. Babby :')
Those hot pockets are calling me
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
Good burger from well good burger
People say that kitchen aid appliances are the best, now they must be as they're clearly Babish approved!
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
"Once you've gotten to know your rolling pin ??" Damn Babby, buy it dinner first....or maybe....make dinner with it first?
Just made me some synonym rolls just like grammer used to make
I was half-expecting Babish to sit on a bun as per Gaffigan’s joke.
Can't wait to make these! Delicious
I just started going back to the gym. I did not need this.
Like 0.3 sec after I saw the vid post yell THE TIME HAS COME

Unrelated Mr Babish, what kind of watch is that?
"STOP! YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW. PAY THE COURT A FINE OR SERVE YOUR SENTENCE! YOUR GOODS ARE NOW FOREFIT!"
I don’t know if I could bake this, but according to Keegan Micheal Key,... I’ve got this.
I get so much rolls from cinnamon rolls

You should have used the scene from the Mark Walberg Will Ferrell movie. I think it was called Daddy's home. It's good because Will pretty much implies that they can't be made in a regular kitchen.

spooky...
0:33 - I tried this recipe with butter from a happy cow and the bread exploded during cooking. Make sure the cow is very angry.
0:26 If you want it cursed why would you draw a pentagram on it????
Having trouble finding ghost pee ??
To be honest, it was sooo satisfying when he zoomed in and slowly twirled and pulled the toothpick out of the bread
Just how grandma made it
Why didn't you let the eggs have a moment?
Reference to the pumpkin pie video :D Also what's up with his dogs? .-. I mean, I'm not gonna say much because I respect his love for dogs, but HOW???? (Also clap clap best content of the year award good job YSAC)
I couldn't find any of the ingredients.

For some reason I couldn’t find the ingredients? XD ??

how did you teach your cat to play catch?
I live California what is a win winter?
Hibernation fort <3 I'm in the other hemisphere, the lonely Southern Hemisphere (we're a bit quiet down here if you compare the populations of each hemisphere). Spring is here, and I kind of want to build my own Spring Hibernation Fort because the hayfever is so bad. Right now I have a regular (strong but non-drowsy) antihistamine tablet I take regularly, a nasal antihistamine AND a saline nose spray (I have the squirty bottle to do proper saline rinses but don't do it too often because I'm too lazy to boil water and wait for it to be the perfect lukewarm temperature before it goes cold). But my sinuses still hurt and my eyeballs are still irritated.
YOU ARE BRILLIANT
Good morning let’s get this bread
I like dogs
#45 on trending boys

Hmmmm………….. Dude you need to make a video at least like every hour..... Thanks.....
Why am I just now finding this channel!
I forgot how much of a genius you are
aaah sit on it and spin... to mix well. most pumpkin pie fillings and breads have butternut or sweeter squash in them - maybe 1/5th pumpkin to allow for advertising laws <— haha
Meh
This is never boring haha
Did you know the star of David is a symbol of Israel and also the balance between man and woman by the ??( the chalice represented the woman) and the ??( the blade represented the man) which together formed the pentacle or six sided star
Time is real, it was proven by Einstein and is taken into consideration for GPS and satellites. This has been your daily fact from your local nerd who gets triggered when people say time is an illusion
But raw eggs arent disgusting.. Ok they are.. a little bit to me

So when can I buy the YSAC limited edition double LP vinyl?
I made this and it is fantastic! !! Seriously ..my husband and daughter ate almost an entire loaf within an hour.
2:34 that was oddly seductive
"You can make a sacred wand out of anything just so long as it's sacred, which means that it was made by God, which is all things, so it's not that difficult." This is actually... pretty damn accurate, really. That's pretty much exactly how that works.
Yes
Fucking love this channel.
At least you don't live in South Dakota.
I really love the effort you put into all your videos. You're really entertaining (and i love your voice) please keep up the amazing videos

I'm sorry, but where are the eggs? There are supposed to be more eggs. Like, alot of eggs. Please redo video .

Wait....this isn't that binging with Babush guy right?
Where has this channel been all my life... I do suck at cooking.

works better if you summon a demon from a pentagram of pumpkin pie spice to share your lonely, terrible winter with!
Not a big fan of pumpkin bread
Had to watch this through the gaps of my fingers.
I miss Lemon Demon
Damm i have everything but the ghost where do i get one

HowToBasic's odd younger brother

My dog died and I've been really depressed to bake anything since he was always my doggo test taster. But your video gives me hope to get back to it.
Bread is bread because of the active yeast reacting to the sugars of the wheat, therefore causing it to rise and create a light and airy texture when biting into it.
He got the ??.??

How do you not have more subs?
I tried this and got pumpkin cake
This is hilarious!
"3/2 Cups of all purpose flower, including the purpose of making pumpkin bread" I haven't laughed that hard about a cooking video. Also funniest thing was when he said "congratulation you get one piece of candy corn, you already have it"
He's a dog sitter he has a lot of dogs each video
You never disappoint.. ????
Well it to late for seasonal fall pumpkin bread. It snowed here today.

(((Mediums/Witches are an abomination to God. The reality is that people are not talking to their dead relatives but to DEMONS!!! Which is an abomination in God's sight to consult with witches and to contact the DEAD!!!))) …….. When we go against God’s will and we think we are talking to our dead relatives that have passed on and this is not the case. This is called Necromancy. (Necromancy): The suppose practice of communicating with the dead, which states in Deuteronomy 18:12 it is an abomination unto the Lord. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. (Mark 12:27). As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment (Hebrews 9:27). Demonic spirits love to disguise themselves as our loved ones. The demons love to appear as little children. People are either taken to the pit by Demons or taken by Gods Holy angels right after we pass on. Its either we love Jesus and repent of our sins and follow his commandments, (John 14:21), or we don't and find ourselves in Hell one day, because of our free will our father has given us. Definition of: {Familiar Spirit}: A Demon supposedly attending and obeying a witch, often said to assume the form of an animal. (The Lord said to Moses): Do not turn to Mediums that have familiar spirits or Wizards to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God. (Leviticus 19:31). I will set my face against the person who turns to mediums/Spiritualists who have familiar spirits and wizards. To go whoring after them by following them. (Leviticus 20:6). A man or women who is a medium and has a Familiar spirit and is among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:27). Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritualist/Wizard or who consults the dead/ Familiar Spirits. Anyone who does these things is an Abomination to the Lord. And because of these Abomination practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the Lord your God. (Deuteronomy 18:10-13). Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums who consult familiar spirits, and households Gods, the idols and all the other Abomination things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. (2 Kings 23:24). He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums with familiar spirits. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, provoking him to anger. (2 Chronicles 33:6). When men tell you to consult mediums with familiar spirits, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? (Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?) (Isaiah 8:19). You shall be brought down, you shall speak out of the ground; you speech shall be low, out of the dust; your voice shall be like the medium’s, out of the ground; and your speech shall whisper out of the dust. (Isaiah 29:4). (Voice…like a medium’s refers to the forbidden, deceptive “voices” for which the medium supposedly served as a channel). Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. (Divination). This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved." She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her. When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place to face authorities. (Acts 16:16-19). He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination and consulted familiar spirits and Wizards/mediums. He did much evil in the eyes of the Lord, provoking him to anger. (2 Kings 21:6). The spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come though hypocritical liars, who conscience have been seared as with a hot iron. (1 Timothy 4:1-2). I used to watch television shows on mediums, but now I know what the bible says about people like these. We need to pray for them that they stop being a mouth piece for Satan and his demons. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the father is not in him (1 John 2:15). We need to get this information out and stop defiling ourselves and pray for people who consult with familiar spirits and come back to the Lord Almighty and seek the truth from him. Praise Jesus (Yeshua) Who is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and the Alpha and the Omega. Amen!
long live pimbloktu
1:58 Um, excuse me good sir. Did you just call me disgusting?
I was glad until you added candy corn
Some rare ingredients
This was great! I was especially surprised by the quality of the song at the end. It seems a step above most songs you've done in the past. Would you say you put more effort into this one? Also can you try to say 'fuck off' in more of your videos? I find it helps to elucidate some of the mystyrious sentiments I share with most co-workers and some members of my extended family. Thank you kindly.
That’s one spoopy pumpkin bread
What an handsome boy 4:29
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime, doubly so.
What is the name/artist of the song at the end of the video? ??

Why does your sheep act like a dog?
Oh my ghoul! So glad I ran into your channel. You're ridiculously entertaining and yes, I'm planning on making that pumpkin bread.
I fully concur with your feelings on snow.

The callback to the pumpkin pie episode made me so giddy.

See yall in a month
Keep up the videos Imaginary Ambition
What kind of camera do you use?
Can I use butter from a happy cow instead?
The fall of Fall.
Okay but the candy corn thing is actually really similar to an old Halloween/harvest festival tradition where they'd stick random things in food and baked goods and the thing you got would predict the events of the coming year
That is a very good doggo.
is there a link for that song ?? it's legit good I want to hear it more
That song was clearly not written by someone who lives in the south. Cause summer sucks.
I love you
yess. good pumpkin bread. good dog.
Beautiful.
Im a small youtuber and I would appreciate any type of support ???
I’ve been enlightened
This was hilarious! You got my sub!
Good energy, up dog.
I can't believe you can cook, edit video, make music and most importantly, have winter pillow fort too
I love pumpkin bread
Yessssssa
pumpkin bread more like pumpkin shit
I can always count on you for a smile.
How you make me laugh stop plz

2:36 does anybody else think that's oddly satisfying??
I actually believed him for a while. I'm so glad I found this channel
?????????? the funniest stuff all of that place
Yo that hibernation fort looks cozy as fuck.
I was a little confused about the light but as soon as you put the smiley face bucket on it I got it. It made for a well need laugh. Thank you
nice song
You are like a very refined HowToBasic.
You suck at YouTube
Guys my walnuts are pretty tough, anyone know a good way to scare it?
Spööky

Lovin’ the fort????

Everything you make is absolute gold. Oh your foods great too.
Beet song is still my favorite song made by him???? ITS AWESOME
This is a good channel????????????????
has he made the broodwich and if can someone link me it
I saw the thumbnail and thought it was hash lmfao
You forgot to mention that the all purpose flour contains the most cursed substance of all: gluten
Very spoopy
What happens if I harvested it within 31 days of a full moon???
Ive been waiting for this all my life
Let’s get this bread
Do you have a band if so please link it. I love your style of music
There needs to be more wang jangling.
Mm that taste... Revolting
Brooo brooooooo, you should make music.
Why dont you have your own vevo channel
It holloween! So everything looks and sounds haunted!
That doge!
I make a CURSED recipe from the DARK WEB (GONE WRONG!)
Hamilton is that you
Low-key the outro songs are bomb
Eventually this comment, along with this sad lonely dinosaur, will be lost in all of the thousands of comments for this video
This is Tim ?? 1 Like = 1 Friend
We all know I suck at cooking, I don't need to be reminded.
Let’s get this bread
Thought the slices of bread was weed ??
“With carrot handle” ?? ?? ??
Those are pecans
Thank you, very cool!
HEY! WHERE DID YOU PUT THE TRUE WANG JANGERLER?!
I love your videos and think they're hilarious! However I'd like to show them to my kids but you throw in a word or two of profanity in almost every video, so that really keeps it from being fully kid friendly. I recognize the need to have it a little edgy but I think it wouldn't take much to make it family-friendly too.
I lost my everliving SHIT when he said "wangjangle"
3:55 I thought he censors his videos?
That's one soggy doggy
Such an accurate video. Thanks ????
Congrats on trending
Why does it it look like a soft brick ??
Thanks for the music. That's my comment. Short..!
Do you live in heaven?
Or...you could just go buy a loaf for like 4 dollars. I buy it from the Amish, it tastes like crack cocaine. I don't want to cook it myself cause I suck at it.
Can we get a banana bread recipie please Edit: or garlic bread, that works to
1:04 The way he shook the stick got me dead ??
I’m allergic to walnuts. What do I do now?
Yoooo ur on trending!
U are my favorite YouTube channel in the world. U put so much effort into all of ur vids. U always make me so happy when I watch ur vids and u inspired me to try and become a chef and I hope I can cook with u one day. Keep up the good work!!!!??????????????????????????????????????
Banana bread is the best
Those pecans were like "not today satan"??
Hello I have a problem with this recipe I can't make it spooky enough :(
The eggs didn't say goodbye to each other but the dog was a good actor. 420/666 stars
Yay!! I hope you make more videos soon.
I didn't have any pans so I ended up pouring it all down the sink. oops.
Does he foster dogs? That would be awsome if he did
summer is trash tho
That was a good song at the end
For some reason this is the one this that I know I’m doing right in life, watching this nonsensical video.
This IS it Chief!
WHY DID I NOT GET A POST NOTIFICATION?!
salt cant be haunted
>log in >see new ysac video >instantly click on it >fuck yes
chuffed
0:18 in case you don’t understand, there’s a full moon every 30 days
What's your dog's name?
noice
Can I replace the pumpkin with bananas
The canned pumpkin is not actually pumpkin but a type of squash called field pumpkin
I came here from trending and I am really interested
Terrific funny!
Finally
Please go on The Official Podcast and defend your hot song writing skills.
Ive been waiting for this video for ever and i feel so happy because its here. this makes me wanna cry because of how much i love this channel. i just want to talk to this guy and tell him how many times he has made me happy for a human to be alive.
YSAC, you never disappoint! What would it take to get a compilation of original songs from all your vids?....A greatest hits album even...? Also, if we can't have Blotto back what about an Egg Cops follow up....? Who's with me?
Weow wat a spoop
This all because USAC built a fort and wanted to show it off
Well... thanks for telling me I suck at cooking lmao. I can cook ramen
I just found my new fav channel!!
lol good stuff
0:12 feelsbadman !
i got genuinely really fucking sad during that song wtf
The scariest part of this video... is the lack of the intro... Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!
I appreciate the dog montage
Trending ??
0.55 why is there a satanic star
I love warm pumpkin bread with butter
groom your dog.
CURLY DOG OMG <3
how to make holy water step one.. boil the hell out of it
i don't know if I should take him seriously, but dang this is a good channel
Number twelve on trending, deserves one, keep up the amazing videos, you are amazing
Someone has to say it.... your a watered down version of howtobasic.
The song reminds me of They Might be Giants. Good job.
My favorite song so far.
My favorite song so far.
@1:38 when dad cooks because mom is out of town
First time ever seeing his videos...this is what I've been missing????????
Lol
That outro song beat the corn on the cob one without a doubt its 100% my favorite one
My mom's pumpkin bread recipe is better than this one (and has less Halloween jokes).
Is that pimblockto on the keys?
ugh this is so disgusting I'm unsubbing ugh
Wow, thats a lot of sugar
That's some dooty bread
Your channel is so funny!
I decided to make this and it was actually really good
I swear this is How To Basic when sober.
didn’t you think your used homemade spice. also it’s still 85 out where i’m at doesn’t even feel like fall??
Pumpkin bread that doesn't have mini chocolate chips is invalid
Thanks for the great video! I’m actually going to try out this recipe.. looks good
0:37 tf2 Halloween Cosmetics just a ton of haunted stuff
Yummy yum yum bread
The song though...yaasss
his dog should be in youtube rewind
i'm crying tears at the sad lamp thing
I wanna eat that
has anyone listened to his tips seriously?
I’m slightly disappointed that you didn’t bless the ingredients with that sacred harvest dildo you have. Your bread has not been properly blessed
Where do you get all these dogs, you lucky monkey skunker?
When your salt is haunted you know you're fucked
When he blessed the ingredients I choked
WHERE DOES HE LIVE
Time to be spoopy
How do I know if my ingredients are haunted? ????????
Who took your wangjangler
I saw a banner that said "binging with Babish viewers watch this." I'm a subscriber already! how about "YSAC viewers watch this" on BWB vids??
Luv u
Thank you for taking me on this journey
Please do ASMR
Finally an upload I can watch without getting bored
The hardest part of this video is me keeping my toxic personality away from it.
I only have butter from an angry goat. Will that work?
Put some lemon kush in the bread
white girls approach over the horizon
Dude this song at the end had such good production, it's no worse than those of some of my favourite bands. Seriously if you put this on spotify as a full version, I'll add it to my favourites playlist.
You are one sick individual that should never be cured. Keep jangling your wangle, my man.
So many fans to make you on trending! I’m a subscriber from about 100,000! Keep up the quality vidoes

Come for the food, stay for the witty humor, and return for the dog.
Just in time, my cursed brown sugar was about to expire! Thank goodness I have this recipe now
You're on Trending yeyeyeyeyeyeye
There’s a face reveal at 3:40!!
Oh my
He's a lil silly in the head it's awesome eating the batter
I followed the instructions perfectly and the pumpkin bread killed my dead aunt's sister, what now?
the video is good if you mute it and skip towards the end
Why he had to be satanic and draw a star for ??
what is it with haunted stuff amirite
I suck vagina
lets get this bread!!
keep your toxic personality away from it for an hour
What's a electric mixer Do you mean electric wanjangler
I just wanted to leave a rare comment and say that the ending song on this video was legitimately really good. I actually checked the description for a download link. YSAC, you should consider collecting a few of your best songs and making an online album that people could listen to or donate to download.
Please be in my band
Dude I swear this looks exactly like Maine
He’s a doggo confirmed. Jk, I love your doggo btw.
I'm proud I found you before you were so popular
That doggo at the end was everything i needed to feel happy today, thank you.
Ey boy grammar mistake in your description. Its not it's. Sorry
Wanna have an unfufilling realtionship that only relies on friday night dinners for us to have any kind of attraction and kindness to each other simply because the food is sub par and because it's sub par I let you hold my hand for a soild minuet until I put you back on the couch because it wasn't good enough for you to earn your once a month laying like a plank on opposite sides of our king size bed?
Came for the bread, stayed for the doggo
It's kind of like HowToBasic's mature disapponted father
If you go into hibernation, does that mean that we won't get any videos until spring?
Drilling the candy corn into the bread. ??
Cats are better. I rest my case.
Cute dog bro
Its amazing how he records this all with his mouth
What kind of dog is that? You know in the end when the music roles? I just wondered.
jealous of your dog's wet curls
greatest YouTube cooking channel by a long shot. I am sorry Babish!
Almost as good as binging with babish
Amazing lol
* flashbacks to pumpkin pie video *
mad cow would have been better :)
I don't trust people that downvote your videos.. What kind of person do you have to be to downvote this video?
l e t i t r i s e
I missed you ??????
i honestly love your doggo so much
So I get that this is a cooking channel, but can you seriously make an album of these songs and sell it and take my money pls
Please bring back pimblockto!!!
How do I get these so called “possessed chickens?”
how many dogs does this guy have???? there’s a new god damn dog in every video
I am thoroughly spooped
I, too, require a happy lamp for the spoopy season.
Is this not a full babish rip?
You're finally on trending!! Congratulations! I never did find out what happened to plimokto or the eggs
How did I not see this in my subscriptions
your songs are fun
3:56 ooooo he used the fuck word
When's the album coming out?
LGTPB stands for Let's get this pumpkin bread
Loved the perfect edit timing on the song at the end with the dog catching the ball @ 3:58 & 4:04. Personally, I loved older themes like the robot and phrases about pepper, but I am glad you do not rely on the same thing in every video. Artists explore the new and provide insight . . . keep up your art, it is very fine.
I’m telling you, it’s a different dog every time.
The dog is awesome
Is the end of the video taped at lake superior
Oh so thats why the eggs keep spinning no matter what i do to stop them and as well as getting scared every time i eat walnuts
Yay you got on trending!!
That jumpscare got me so bad
This is so much like HowToBasic... I LOVE IT!
Spooky scary pumpkin bread
Undo on 4 hundo
s p o o k y b r e a d
thank you for existing.
This was so funny I forgot the instructions ????
what if i cant find the haunted parts of the ingredients
Its like I'm watching how to basic but but calm version ??
bonus lesson: spooked walnuts are pecans.
How about corn breas
delicious finally some good fuc-
Where does this madman live it's so fucking beautiful.
Your dog is adorable!
Je klinkt echt als een engels iemand ik klink gwn als een dronken mongool gg
s p o o k y t i m e
Woah, my mom just made this for breakfast!
Fuluufy cat u have
if I make the pumpkin bread and slather it in whipcream does it become pumpkin pie? Also, can I buy the song at the end from anywhere? seriously. Those are some good sounds.
What's the point of baking if you're not eating the raw batter ?????
Cool af
Lol I don't mind raw eggs. I bake one loaf then eat the other raw.
Is it a new dog in every video or am I just crazy? Also why are they always so serene?
I wonder what one of their videos would be like if they made something from Food Wars. xD
I love your songs
Brown sugar is a good idea, the recipe I use has white sugar and requires more of it.
Hey everybody I’m a kid friendly youtuber that makes my own very cool movies, I am making a really cool movie series called The Spezi Realm and you can see the Trailer for it on my channel subscribe to my channel so you can get notifications when the episodes will come out!
Finally a wangjangle!!!!!!!!!
I can't find haunted sugar anywhere
I've been subscribed to you since your like 5th video maybe, and this end song is my favorite. Really great job man. You always put so much effort into your videos and at 4+ years I thought you've earned a pat on the back of some kind from a guy you don't know lol Keep up the great work!! ??
This is the S P O O K police. You're under arrest for being too S P O O K Y
You suck at making videos. Yeah, you totally suck. Kidding. Haha great content as always!
That dog porn at the end. My bulldog jiffed twice. Thnx.
We are simply not worthy of your content
This honestly has to be the best outro song yet.
Why are you trying to be a Binging with Babish fake lol have some originality
Salt can't be haunted because it drives ghosts away, but you can use cursed salt instead.
Your not uploading as much. Are you ok?
Just made Pumpkin Bread French Toast the other day.
I love the end <3
The celery wand made me choke on my soda hahahahahahhaha
You should upload more
I want to see your face.
Fortnite content nobody cares about YouTube: I sleep YouSuckAtCooking makes a new, amazing video YouTube: REAL SHIT
Yo that fort honestly looks cozy af.
its*
I think people underlook the songs he puts in at the end of his videos. The fact that he writes one for each video is pretty impressive
i thought the thumbnail was some dank hash, this aint bad tho
Is this babish?
This is fantastic. You put out great quality videos that are a lot of fun to watch!
lets get this bread.
I've been getting a lot of bread lately, not money just my card intake is unreal
October: let's get this pumpkin bread November: let's get this corn bread December: let's get this Holy bread
wheres pimblockto
This is too much info dammit, I'm really pissed off..??
Not only did I learn something, but I had fun and a good laugh . 9.3/10. Deduction for not enough skeletons in your video. It’s only spooktober once, take advantage while you can.
I never knew what love was until I found this channel
i'm pretty sure the kitchen appliance, when referring to it as something that can finish your pastries or your bread, should be spelt "undough"
whats with all these heartfelt comments
where the F U C K do you live where it is always that fucking pretty outside? or, at least, where is that stolen footage from?
You have a very soothing voice lmfao
I am so glad about the fact that we share this kind of humor
Finally my possessed chicken is of use
I come here for the witty cooking lesson, I stay for the sweet jams at the end. <3
Lmao ?? this was great ??
it was truly horrifying carrying around hot bread in the hands till it cooled off.
This channel is completely underrated! One of the best YouTube channels ever! I'm making the pumpkin bread right now .... collecting all my evil ingredients.
Forget making this, where can i buy it
How to make weed brownies
???? this was very entertaining lol glad I didn’t change the video lol love your monotone voice lmao and your sassy whit

NSFW @2:34!
Ok, this is epic

To what extent should I spook my nuts?

Those lyrics are impressive.
Those are definitely pecans.
Can you make some merch?

I love it when he ends the video with a doggo
Thank you.
Did you raid a haunted house's spice cabinet?
THis Was So Great! Check out my Restaurant Youtube Channel! We are doing amazing things. I may have to make this! Great stuff!!
Why am I laughing at how you poured the salt in at 0:42 lol
You are a treasure.
I wish your songs were on spotify

I hope he makes a whole thanksgiving meal for his next video.
Does ysac have a twitch channel
I'm disappointed ????
Your so random and I love it Your dog is so cute btw
This is my new favourite YouTube channel
Your dog has noodle hair.
This is actually the third recipe i tried. Am I weird?
Thanks dad, very cool!
The pup is gorgeous. What's his name?
who else came here for pumpkin bread?
If you don't have two pans just pour the other half of the batter down the drain - YSAC 2018
"How can i have the loaf if its still back in the undo" bwaahahahahahah. My kids are gonna love this one. Thanks for another sick video man - your dog looks like a frikken legend
Can you do weed brownies next please

How to make pepper pepper pepper.

Fantastic. Bravo
It’s HALLOWEEENNNNNNENNENENN
To be honest I’m always super excited for the puppy endings
Love it, but why do most people seem to not like winter? (I’m referring to the song at the end) I can’t stand the heat. I live in the south and we get 7 months of HOT weather and I don’t always work indoors. I always enjoy winter.
4:19 turn on subtitle
Snudhhsniushinshjbs ITS 6 on trending!
Thought the thumbnail was some loud
What kind of dog is that?
Your dog has Ramen Hair
????? ???? ????? ?????
Pro tip: Don't actually try to ride out the whole season in your hibernation chamber. It's much safer to come out intermittently through the months to restock on leftover candy, gingerbread and nanaimo bars. Happy hibernating!
Creativity is worth rewarded by likes!
But is meatloaf therefore not just beef bread?
This vid was too spooky
I fucking love pumpkin bread, and I hate the pumpkin everything that comes with fall. You live in a very beautiful place. ?
Winter>Summer forever
Hi i am from thailand please follow my channel

Plot twist,all the white ingredients were cocaine.
Wow. I AM SHOOKETH.

It has to be binging with babish
This was awesome. Good job
I want to see an episode where your mom makes one of her recipes
My salt isnt haunted, will it still work?
Okay this guy is actually funny
These videos are amazing! the sacred wands are genius.
I hate to break it to you buddy but no tool ever will replace Pimblokto.....
#6 on trending what
So much effort in one video
The scariest thing is that people disliked this video
dog dog dog dog dgo
Cordless kinetic screwdriver ????
Booooooooooooooo
(Also chocolate chips make this super good btw)
I hope you realise that you are now required to do cinematic dog outro for every future video
Where’s the Wangjangler?
What is the end song XD i need it
Can we get a mixtape of all the songs played at the end of the video????
Be sure to do a thorough tick check after your Autimnal stroll in the woods!
Is that jerktonium? hahah anyone remember that from spongebob
How many dogs do you have??
wow, your "pour it down the sink" life hack just saved me so much space in my fridge, i had at least 50 pounds of unused batter in there. thanks!
I prefer to bake my pumpkin bread in a pumpkin.
I got scared together with the wallnuts
I truly appreciate the feeling of solidarity for those of us with seasonal depression ???
I will watch these for as long as you keep making em
The new HowToBasics
Yes
i thought this was a real recipe...
I'm definitely going to subscribe on this, very educational
To be hones though, that fort is what I want to sleep in every night
i like
I thought that was shit in the thumbnail
White people
Wow your dog is serving LOOKS omg
Blessed the food and I lost it
#7 on trending baby let's go!!!!!

pumpkim bread/cake is really good
lets cancel the job interview, sit tf down and watch the latest video of You Suck At Cooking.
This video made me so happy
I don't have any spooky ingredients. Will regular ingredients work or will it just make regular, un-spooked pumpkin bread?
#7 on trending
i love your videos but pumpkin bread does not sound appetizing.. americans have weird tastes-
Is this supposed to be funny?
Am i able to substitute the haunted salt for cursed salt?
Seasonal depression moods
Holy yeet,#7 on trending.Congrats!
Ever made sushi?
So bloody toxic!!
I think you summed it up perfectly
Good boi do a fetch, get wets Many foods made Yes
as an australian i hate summer ((me saying i was australian is very relevant and in fact gives me the authority to speak out my opinions m))
Shouldn't you measure by weight and not volume when baking?
I love all your videos and im jelous of you ! I SUCK AT BEING HAPPY I TOTALLY DO!!
I'm tired of seeing videos from this horrible channel on the trending page. I don't know who had to suck what on who to get these on the trending page but please stop.
Where can I find the lyrics to the song at the end? Lol Edit: you need to put that shit on Spotify my guy
I’m honestly here because the thumbnail looked like weed
Can you release an album?
*cough* SOMEONE clearly lives in Canada. ?? I feel your pain re: the shortness of summer, bro. Kickass but sadly accurate song!
I made pumpkin bread the day before this video was made and it turned out not great. I'm so dissapointed that I didnt wait another day, and now i have 2 loafs of mediocre pumpkin bread. Do you know how it feels to have to dissapoint your friends and family with mediocre pumpkin bread?
LET'S GET THIS (pumpkin) BREAD!!
Its a good fucking day when you see a new YSAC video in your feed! BLESS!
Did you just insult my cooking.
rad
hello i've missed this :')))
Do you make the music video first and then the cooking part? I feel like you could make legitimate music if you tried harder.
The thumbnail looks like a beautifull piece of hashish, lol
Friends, did you know that by remembering the Works of Jesus Christ, which reveals His character, ensures us of His love? In the Book of Psalms, David proclaimed his deep yearning for God as he hid from his enemies in the desert (Psalms 63:1). Remembering his personal encounters with The Lord's limitless power and satisfying love led him to praise (vv.2-5). Through his most difficult nights, David could still rejoice in his dependable Father's love and care (vv.6-8). During our darkest times, when we feel as if God is not there for us, we need reminders of who God is and how He demonstrated His love. Reflecting on our personal experiences with Him, as well as His actions recorded in scripture, can affirm the countless ways our good Abba Father loves us. Start your endless relationship with our Creator by first acknowledging you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross. His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. You will be rewarded greatly and forever changed! Precious one, please find comfort in praying the following prayer with me.... Dear Lord Jesus, thank you for demonstrating Your endless love to Your people, in our lives and through the words You preserve in Scripture. We give You all the honor and glory and we thank you! Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.??????
Where the HECK am I gonna get 3 haunted baking ingredients?
ok i might suck at cooking but that's better than eating pumpkin bread
I was waiting for Pimblokto to appear all oiled up and healthy
That bread looks dry as Fuck;)
Such rich content. I appreciate the time you put into these amazing videos. You dont feel the need to mass produce bullshit. Just quality content every time. It's always worth the wait.

One of your best songs at the end
If you even eat or cook pumpkin bread you suck at cooking.
Dog footage is BACK!!!! Hype
We're have u been
Its the little quotes that count??
Hello, Humans. Terrance walks through his nightmares, with a machete. This machete allows him to kill many demons and monsters alike. Such nightmares, become ten times worse, everytime Terrance sleeps. What should be rest and peace, is nothing but anger and suffering. The anger and the machete become one. One that crushes demons and stands up to the flames of darkness. The darkness almost consumes Terrance. The machete brings about scary power. Once Terrance unleashes the full power of the machete, the nightmare ends and he wakes up, on the floor covered in his own blood. Terrance has enough scars to last 100 life times. TERRANCE OUT
Awwwwww, that winter hibernation fort looks amazing.
Your funny songs are getting longer. I like it. You are my favorite Youtuber right now I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
I've heard that cans of pumpkin actually isn't pumpkin. It's squash. So you just made squash bread. And if you use those cans for Thanksgiving and Christmas for pie, you've made squash pie. Oh, the joy.
Thank you for the awesome footage of your dog playing on the beach! Your dog has the best hair ever.
but can it be a halloween decoration?
what kind of dog is that?
Finally someone who gets the hibernation fort.
2:05. "If you don't have two pans, just pour the other half of the batter down the sink." I'm so glad I wasn't drinking my beer when you said that.
Let's get this pumpkin bread
Hehehe enjoyable sense of humor.
Good Content

“Sneak one piece of candy corn in the loaf and when you and your friends are eating it, say ‘whoever gets a piece of candy corn wins a prize and the prize is..a piece of candy corn. Congratulations you already got it.’ “

It’s so aweful it’s amazing
Let's get that bread
Raw eggs are my favorite though.

So good. One question, how many dogs do you own? I’ve seen at least like 10 different dogs in your outro and I can never tell if there yours or your friends that you just use for the vid
Welcome back, daddy. Master daddy.
I'm disappointed in the cooking to jokes ratio in this one. What is this, potatoes?
This channel is EVERYTHING.

Makes me miss Umblotto.
Hi-key want to buy the outtro song. You do not suck at songwriting my dude.

spoopy
I love these videos man I almost choked on my wonton when he said possessed chicken smh
I, like the pumpkin pie spice, am haunted by the fact you’ve followed your mother into the easy way out.
I can’t find any haunted salt :(
I’d really like to spend a day with the guy that makes these videos. Like what a personality: cooking, singing, humor, dogs
Try pumpkin bread with yogurt (I like nonfat Greek yogurt). You’re welcome.
The songs are back!!! I’ve missed them.
How do I know if the cow is angry?
spook
3:18 I was homeless for 7 year's and three of the seven were spent in a hobbit hole.... Even though it's been 5 year's since then I still miss it a little... Say's while is in a bed watching TV show doing Christmas gift stuff and playing on a phone 8n a house made for people and not animals...
Honestly this was some click bate like to some Howtobasic vid.
That toothpick insertion was very sensual to me
You know it’s October so say haunted Like a hunted pencil

What state does he live in
The song at the end is amazing
This is probably the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube
The music has gotten rather good.
I know I suck at cooking. No need to remind me. ??
I literally have been waiting for this for a month, T H A N K
i dont appreciate this blatant winter hate
Have you guys ever wondered if he is the one that actually sucks at cooking ?
That looks good with cuban espresso
You should be on food network
that actually tastes revolting
I laughed so hard at the sad lamp so relatable
why were the dog images vibrating? also who made the guitar noises
be back in 11 months
Omg no way! I actually made this today in culinary and miserably failed.
Hi love your videos keep on keeping on
Ondos on 3 fundo wtf happened to ondos on 4 hundo
YSAC teach me how to cook up some happiness
Your videos always hit too 10 trending when they first come out, and you only upload once a month YouTube algorithm pls explain.
These videos inspire me... But then I realize I can’t cook
Next video can you do a face review when your cooking something
Y Yo You You s You su Hah, go suck a Wang jangle =)
The sad lamp instantly reminded me of the glaring light of the dead of winter
Since we are aproching the 100th episode I wonder what he will do.
See you in a month.
Holy crap that candy corn was definitely having sex with that bread! This is x-rated!
I watch your videos, not just for the cooking and comedy, but also the beautiful Canadian scenery
Wait what was this video about I was too scared
Quality content
Is it a vegan pumpkin?
Damn, that song hit me straight in the heart. Winter can indeed fuck off.
I made one of those hibernation forts. But I find it really hard to breath if I closed all the light source out. I tried opening it a bit but the light just keeps getting in. Anyone have any solutions? so that it is breathable?
what if i just toast an entire pumpkin, is that just a raw loaf of pumpkin bread
When my mother makes her pumpkin bread then that’s when fall starts
How's that hibernation fort going for you?
I blessed it a third time just in case, and now I'm breaking quantum physics of my third being. Cooking at godly sucking levels
2:32 suck that, Socrates
Great song at the end brother!
and you got my sub.
HALLOWEEN
Finally
Okay so are you just posting one a month now, cause I honestly need more ysac in my life, man
A toast to bread, for without bread there would be no toast!
You! Sir! You you you you!! It’s alway been you mr. dog !

Gotta pump the kins before you make the bread tho

Congratulations on trending!
OMG i just found your channel and i love you! I'm dying of laughter and your voice is so relaxing. I also like your intro and your ending. Totally subscribing! Keep up the good work!!
Oh thAnk U Sweety. That made my day. Another dOg???? He had a great time.ahh. usually Poodle dawg r not big on water. His he's Labra doo? Or perhaps a Golden naught? A piece of candy corn is no prize. A bucket would be no prize. A boatload would be a curse. Ha!
Those are pecans
How’d I not know about this channel?!
I love this channel. I’m so glad these videos are getting more popular; they are so funny and creative.

Great episode as always, but man, right at the end it really struck me just how good your music is. Am I crazy, and has it gotten even better?
instructions unclear, my house is now haunted with three ghosts and one demon
yes
1:04 ??????
You sound like you want to move to Arizona, join us winter doesn't exit here.
Seriously though, I've been trying to find a purpose for all this haunted baking soda I've had in my cupboard. So glad I have a use for it now, THANKS!
More a pumpkin cake hmm? Not dough but batter?
Will you ever do a face reveal? Also, I am undoubtedly going to make this
2:24 You forgot to tell them to buy gold
"move to a nice warm state of denial" I love this channel

I genuinely love your stuff so fucking much, you are my favorite youtuber
i love this channel
Why this dude so damn talented. Love the outro songs
Your video is the highlight of my week, probably even life
my day got a lot better
If I eat this I would pass out from shear fear and deliciousness
“If you’re not afraid of raw eggs.” Nice reference
Ok guys so just if we believe enough we’ll just be ok or bad at cooking just believe
Where do i find the ghost urine?
I want to hear music you make other than for this channel. Do you have a bandcamp?
the scene at 2:35 was too intimate for me ??
make garlic bread you hipster
How did you come up with the concept for you suck at cooking? You've been round for a long time and still relevant.
Finally a new video
But what if my all purpose flour doesn’t want to be purposefull
Day 2 of subscribing: Finally the last epi- A NEW EPISODE?! Bye homeworks
Festive!

i love this channel
Ugh I’m so sad. I need my happy lamp
My pp hard

I love your dog
I'd honestly love to sleep in a hibernation fort.
Let’s get this pumpkin bread
At around 0:40-ish I realized it's almost Halloween! EDIT: Dude wtf, why do you need half a ton of sugar for BREAD? oO
OMFudgingG he's back
Dude, pumpkin nut bread is made from pumpkin nuts, from a pumpkin tree, not with pumpkin and walnut. That's a cheap knock off! Banana nut bread is also made from banana nuts from banana nut trees.
Seriously, those lyrics and that flow.... Please release an album. Or pursue a music career in some semi-serious capacity, anyways.
Damn that guy makes me question my sexuality
Will you do apple pie?
Y'all: Who buys pumpkin pie spice instead of just making your own? YSAC: MY MOMMY SO SHUT THE FUCK UP
Sacred Wang Jangler
let's get this pumpkin bread??
Screeeeeech XD I live for your videos :3 ????
Hi
Those were... really damn good lyrics! Who even are you today? :D
Now that song in the end was beautiful, really, do you have your music on Spotify, or a second channel? Would love to hear more.
That pumpkin bread is u n b a l a n c e d
Garlic bread, banana bread, and pumpkin bread.the holly trinity
I wasn't ready for that toothpick insertion...nnnghhhh!
Dude these vids are awesome!
Do you have to use these exact ingredients? Because I can’t find any ghosts who are willing to make this.
OHH ITS HALLOWEEN SOON
thanks for an awesome video full of smiles because of you
Damn, no full moon.
loved this ep!!
Winter > summer
Doggo
ok now it’s 100% he lives in rural southwestern Ontario
19 more till 100!
I always eat batter, sometimes it tastes better thank the actual cooked cake, or dessert in general. If I manage to find some cursed brown sugar, I'll try to make this pumpkin bread only to eat its batter.
You still suck at cooking after 81 episodes
I fucked a goat once.
Pumpkin bread is great for making grilled cheese sandwiches. The trick is making sure to use fresh cottage cheese.
Wait so if the eggs come from a possessed chicken, do we not let them say goodbye to each other?
Yo not to mean but when are my eggs
YES
It's been a while since you've been making videos...can you do a video reveal?????? Please!!!!!
I always look forward to these. Thank you!
Im sure you’re hot af Or cute af
and it doesn't make you a better person.
This was on my recommendations
This is the only channel with consistent quality content
Ok but the blanket fort looks comfy as hell
Your songs sound like early Weezer records.
Good morning everybody let’s get this bread
YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS NEW VIDEO
Most entertaining AND informative channel on Youtube.
These post cooking songs are getting more and more professional... If you pull a joji on us, just keep up the theme of being occasionally about food or cooking in some bizarre and surpringly rhythmic way (like you always do)
What's wrong with raw eggs?
But... but I care about what makes bread, bread
Where do you keep getting all these dogs
Thank you. I needed this today
Sp00ky
Cheered me up after the unfortunate events at the Chippenham v Maidenhead game
I want that mother fucking winter hibernation fort
This man lives in another universe where everything feels right
This video somehow just made me so happy :’) I love how he always inspires me and somehow even brings nostalgia up.
youtube says you have 2 new videos, yet there is only 1. Did you upload and then remove version 1 of this video or something? was just wondering what caused the YT error and figured it may be good for you to know as well. PS I like the way you wangjangle. Very rebellious. Personally I'm more conservative so I live in a tin can.
Do you have 50 different dogs?
1:05 killed me a little
I spooked my walnuts too much and now they're hiding in the back of the pantry and won't come out.
I appreciate that we both hate living on an axis
The song at the end was extra tasty!
Where’s Pimblokto?
The wild ysac has returned once again for its once in a couple year uploads, the people rejoice as it goes back into hibernation for another decade...
what did the pumpkin say to the pumpkin carver cut it out
I think he’s a dog walker!
Awesome Doggie!
Fruit cake is next
Wangjangled?
This is what I needed today
That winter hibernation fort is my dream
You know what guys I think I'm finally good at cooking
I fucking love pumpkin break I make it every year thank you
ew.
I complained last video about not having any ending music. And then this one comes out with a pretty long and pretty awesome song. :)
Finally a new video
oh my beautiful. and it looks absolutely delicious. i really appreciate people like you who take so much time to make videos for other people’s enjoyment. im nod of those people.
Great video! Can’t wait for next years upload
Missed you man
You forgot to tell us to bless the ingredients in the description recipe thanks now my mums possessed by an angry cow
Your dog is so cute!
Says the one who tried pumkin in touster
His music is actually great
What happens if I use a sad lamp?
Thank you.
The recipies a bit different, but me and my mom make pumpkin muffins simillar to this.
Is no one else gonna talk about how awesome that song at the end was? SO GOOOD!!
Gordon Ramsay can't beat him
THE COOKING LORD HAS RETURNED
I usually come here to hear the him sing. It's great. or did someone else sing at the end?
Can't wait for you're next tuesday-ish vid

Happy to hear that the wang jangle finally made a return.
H I B E R N A T I O N F O R T
what the fuck is this ?
I like the song at the end
When are you gonna drop an album?
are the dogs different every time?
HOW MANY DOGS DO YOU HAVE
What makes bread bread is the fact that 5 symbols have been organized in a way to communicate to people that what it's referring to has been recognized as bread.
cmon ysac, no one will ever be as good as your mom!
Can I get a Spotify link for that song it was actually amazing
Good morning chefs let's get this bread
The DOGGO
Finally
I like your sheep, he is good at fetch.
You know, YSAC, some of your videos of your dog are better than your recipes. (I buy my pumpkin bread at the local bakery!)

Pumpkin

That blanket fort looks comfy af

DAD?
My mom makes pumpkin banana bread its ??
Is the bread supposed to turn to a dog?
Am i the only one who gets emotional while watchin these series?
1000th
You actually confused me on what makes bread bread. Im so lost now.
I swear, this dude needs a Oscar!!
Wouldn’t recommend screwin’ the candy corn...high potential of genetically modifying it.
Uploaded at the same time Babish did, coincidence? I think not
For Tennessee it’s winter
Your dog is looking like my bathrobe
When does the You Suck at Cooking album come out?
When he said time is an illusion I really him to say that helps things make sense
i love it, thank you
I’ve wanted to try some of your excellent tutorials but I don’t know if it’s legal to wang jangle or capture coconuts. It doesn’t seem to be illegal where you cook. Do you know any relative areas where this may be legal?
This is one of the best ones by far??
PS great pooch
Why the fuck don't you have a music label?
My fuckin ghost doesnt want to haunt my flour anymore he's such a grouch
I didn’t get a notification
This music is amazing. Do you have a soundcloud or anything? I'd love to download a full version of this song.
This is so clever. A friend sent me this and I'm digging it. Will sub. XO
Where do you get all these dogs and beautiful scenery from?!
Why did my Fran send me this link to watch a man make a gold bar and play with a wet sponge
Holy heck, thank you. I didnt follow instructions clearly so got my dick stuck in the pumpkin
I have waited so long, and it was so worth it!
just what i needed
Can you tell me how you made that hybernation fort
Shit,Its my favorite type of bread
Where do you get all these doggos?
I've been missing the doggies
i missed the songs at the end
Glob bless you, sir wangjangler
I think the joke of harvesting a pumpkin within 30 days of a full moon is being grossly underappreciated.
I thank the Halloween Spirits for your videos!
Alright you got me at haunted salt. Totally not possible.
Reference from episode 68
I MISSED YOUUUU
Fucking amazing! They’re all good, but it’s been a while since you produced a genuine masterpiece like this one. Made my Halloween, which has gotta be the point, right?
i love that the songs at the end of your videos always sound like Weezer if they didn’t try to be cool
If you like summer because its hot then move to florida, every day is 100 degrees outside
AW FRIG YISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
I saw a dog. I'm a happy pumpkin.
35 pumpkins disliked this video
Yes you uploaded again! Thank you for the amazing videos!
Dude I miss these vids wish they’re were more of them. Great video man keep up the good work.
Finally I have been waiting for a new video I already watched all of them
Wow great vid see you next year!????
What kind of dog?
I love it
3:27 ??
You should put your songs on sound cloud
Inb4trending
So, now I can make a mean loaf of pumpkin bread but I still pretty much suck at cooking...
when's the EP comin out
Ended up with pumpkins growing out of oven, Instructions unclear
Send the ingredients to the pope for extra blessing
put the song on itunes
I could smell wet dog all the way from here
Nice song.
You silly twat. Salt can't be haunted. It is one of the main items that are used to fight ghosts.
Let’s get this bread
ok but that song at the end was a Mood™ thank you
Wait... this is a Halloween video!??
Yes give
I scared the batter too much and now its crying. Thanks for nothing, you monster!
OMG
I can’t wait to do this! I love your videos YSAC!
There’s a different dog every time
Finally
okay, this is epic
You always have different dogs in your videos. How many do you have?
That song is my life dude. I relate so hard.
“Now you wanna sneak one piece of candy corn into each loaf.” phone dies
What a jam
Why is it called bread when it's actually cake?
3:18 I remember when I used to make those when I was young. Those were the good day until I went to high school and got almost no free time left
Should I feel insulted that he is singing a intro about that a suck at cooking idk??????
Face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel face revel
Can I be your slave?
Wow I've now been watching this channel for 3 years... It's great to see this channel grow to size it is now
That is NOT a dog
i NEED a winter hibernation fort
YESSSS.
If you released an album, The YSAC Soundtrack, I'd buy like, at least a dollop of it.
This was my early christmas gift, i am obsessed with your series
Good thing I have all the ingredients in my dungeon where I do my sacrifices
you dirty little pervert. were you scrubbing your onion??!
I live in Florida. What is this winter that you speak of?
For all the comedy (or whatever you're doing) in the videos; you do make some genuinely excellent food.
his voice sounds like tina from bobs burgers
Perfect
You drilled in the candy corn LMFAO
Best song of the series
With all these funky ingredients, I can't help but wonder what affect this bread with have on you once you eat it????
With two cups of sugar, think this deserves the title of cake. Don't sell those spooky ingredients short. Shame on you.
How many dogs do you have or do you rent them for your videos? I swear it's a different dog every time.
You put so much quality into this it's honestly amazing.
i have every single ingredient the only thing i dont have is a bowl
my father is back luvvvvg love lov
how long do i have to wait for news from pimplokto.....
If you can't curse your own brown sugar, storebought is fine.
not the funniest one :/
Guess what Read More I don't really suck at cooking
Wait. Are you english?
Oi oi oi where’s the egg saga. THE STORY MUST CONTINUE
Every time one of these episodes goes up, a little bit of me prays furiously for the return of the Egg story Arc. :'(
Lmao! The song
What beautiful location are you living in? It looks like paradise!
your good boye adds more quality to your videos
?
when is the album coming up? :P
Yay You uploaded a video!
That song was actually pretty good
i saw this and screamed
Huh... Today is a full moon. Looks like I'm going pumpkin hunting
This was posted at 3 am
Fuck yeah
0:48 scared the life outa me
make the canned pumpkin stuff with real pumpkins pls. there is no magical canned pumpkin in finland
I remember when you had around 60k crazy how far you've grown
Iam so pleased that you are still making video's!
You are my fav youtube channel by far
BUT WHERES PIMBLOKTO
Cute dog!
It aint spooky if there aint bones in it -69 or 420
This episode was just ok.
I've bred pumpkin bread before, but I've never tried baking it. Hmmm
Is the song going to be on the album?
Pupper
lets get this bread
This isn't trending yet?
you down play the life long horrific suffering of the cow and how most people do not have genetics to not be sick from the sugar in it alone let alone the protein with gets digested in 4th stomach of cow , didn't know you have a 4th stomach .
That was a really nice song at the end, good video
Can I borrow your drill?
Make more video pls
Is it normal to feel like you're falling in love while watching this video?
The sun is refracted somehow in the song... looks like a mushroom cloud sent to make eternal winter
Of course he’s a dog person
Glad to see someone who remembers to spook the walnuts.
Song slaps.
That was too scary can you please warn us next time when you make a scary video
Wow, how convenient! I guess I was waiting for this
my winter hibernation fort broke and I'm going to die of hypothermia or frostbite if I don't find a new one by December. send help.
Pumpkin bread is the best buttered and wrapped in wax paper. Being a little squished from being in a paper bag for a few hours makes it that much more nostalgic.
We miss Pimblokto! Just repair him
How many not cats do ya have
Littlrely my life
this gave me spook
wassup white boi
Nice
The song at the end was excellent!
God damn it, 20 seconds in and I'm in tears already.
11 months of winter? DO you live in Winnipeg? :3
I'm dying one hundo
Quick question guys!!!!!!! How do I know if my spices are haunted???? where did you get yours?????
Winter = the bestest.
I MADE IT FOR ONCE
Hey its how to basic that talks.
What about the wangjangler-3000
Master of cooking has returned
Finally a halloween themed vid lol
You got a rise out of me with this one..
Your drill sucks ass.
I can't wait to see more new content
You taught me something new, thanks! I always thought baking soda was the same thing as baking powder. Never saw a recipe that included the former, though.
Okay but i actually love you???
You need to post more my man
Dude nice dog! Congrats
YAY finally after a month! ???
"Winter can come for a month and then fuck off." a whole californian mood.
That's a damn nice fort.
I think I hurt my self-hitting the like button! Slow down kids, the video is not going anywhere.
These videos you make are so good, and the food looks so delicious :) And your editing is really nice One question, are you in college ?
xD I love how he's always making fun of shit but had the thoughtful realization to mention that people shouldn't eat raw eggs ;P
Holy shit, your outro song was especially good this time!
How do you know so many dogs?
i’ve been blessed this season
This would be perfect for stapling onto a tree.
This is scary
3:15 Möth joined in room
Who are the 23 "people" who down voted this?
Get it it’s all for Halloween
Salt can't be haunted. Everything else can, but salt, nah.
New YouTube update looks weird
How dare you call me disgusting for eating raw eggs. Maybe i can only eat raw eggs because thats all i have
Noice
These videos are becoming more and more insane! And I don't mean good, I mean actually mad.
I suck at cooking yea I totally suck
I didn't have any haunted spices, so I took the ones that I had and placed them near my computer speakers. I then played a compilation from YouTube of Hillary Clinton's old hag laughter, and that spooked them right up.
58k views 5.8k likes 5.8k/58k×100%=10% 10% of the people that watched this video liked this video I wasted a full 3 minute writing this comment and its getting late and tomorrow i have a math test and i have not studied one bit, i think i will fail the test
At like 5 million subs u should do a face reveal/not face reveal but q&a with ur dog(s).
Instructions unclear accidentally summoned the Pumpkin devil.
Is Pimblockto coming back btw?
Where can I get the orange harvest wand
This is cooking. This is comedy. This is music. This is ART.
I can’t believe you resuscitated congrats
I am literally on a school field trip watching this and all my friends are looking at me.
Never Clicked off buzz feed so quick......
What if I only have possessed baking soda, and not haunted baking soda?
50spoopy100me
i don’t like pumpkin
Report 4 too spooky
I only have a cup and a half of cursed brown sugar. Can I substitute the other cup for cursed regular sugar?
You Suck at Disappointing Me!
That was the best ending song he has ever done! Its so good!!!
this song a bop tho
yuuu suk at kookeeng yeh u totali suk!!!
The song at the end of this one was just fantastic! Love your videos!!
Epic dog footage.
Within 30 days of a full moon? Pretty easy I guess then
Bring back binblocto!!!
I have always liked your ending songs but like This one gotta be my favorite Its so chill
I'm sad. We need more episodes!
the dog bit was epic
succ bread
S P O O K Y B R E A D
I thought in the beginning you would cut the pumking and a slice of a bread would come out. :(
Placed it on the hanger. It fell off and onto my feet where it got busted open. I still suck.
Great episode, I really enjoyed the music afterwards
It’s weird how good at cooking he is
I quited babish's video to watch yours
Lets get that bread

"cordless kinetic screw driver" lol!
I hope you make a song with Bill Wurtz one day
Pumpkin bread sounds awful bet it smells of fart lol
Good dog
Amazing! YSAC rules.
Love the song ??

That was so so pretty
You are incredible! I subscribed for your sense of humour

Hi, I love your vids, but WHERE IS PIMBLOCKTO PLEASE I MISS HIM SO MUCH
Damn, I really wanted to see the dog shaking off the water
What's your sweet poochie girl's name? (and lineage)
Where are the Eggisodes
Ysac album needs to happen. Tunes so lit??.
Always impressed!
I want a piece I love pumpkin bread
Get your dog groomed, unless that's a Kurt Cobain costume you've got on him. Great episode
This cooking show isn't that great if still, after watching 81 episodes, I suck at cooking just as much as before
I caught my pumpkin during the bloodmoon 25 days ago . Will the recipe still work
is this a pie? I made pumpkin bread before and I've never put sugar and butter in it... but I'm from Poland so maybe my idea of bread is different
I love u ysac
Thank you for the great video honey??
This time, maybe I'll learn something.
Love u
That scared stick logic would drive many Christians
Where does he live?
every tuesdayish D:<
Yes, I do suck at cooking.
Whats with the Pentegram
Three teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice? You mean 1 tablespoon? What a fool.
I appreciate the amount of effort you put into your videos
hello people that are looking at the comments while watching the video
What happened to the onion?!
What happened to the onion?!
I prefer banana bread
1:44 Why didn't you let your eggs say goodbye? I know they're probably possessed but possessed eggs should still have the right to say goodbye.
i happy now
I wanna make a winter hibernation fort now :(
Fun fact: in french “magic wand” is actually “baguette magique” so that’s a super legit harvest wand
I suck at cooking, yeah, I totally suck... But how did he know?
Ok but the real question is, is pimblokto alive?
My doggo has the same ball
i love you
2:52 Now that's heresy. You need jesus.
Is Pimblokto still rotting in a closet somewhere?
You need to cut your dog's nails, dude.
So...can I have Ur dog?
Man I miss this channel Edit: the dog is good, pure
Oh guys I never looked at the description but its amazimg XD
30 days after a full moon. So.... whenever?
You better stop wishing for winter to go away. We are all about to know what that will be like permanently.
Man that fort is fuckin sick. Can we have a fort tour as your next video?
spice pumpkin
It’s going to be a good day!! Even though I apparently suck at cooking
The effort you put into these videos is amazing. It really inspires me to do nothing because I will never make anything this great.
Where the f do you live dude it looks like North American paradise
Yes
2:34 that shot made me feel uncomfortable
Just move to south america. Or Hawaii. Or anywhere south.
I actually really dug that song.
Why does 2:35 look so sensual?
I thoroughly enjoyed this video.
Plz put the song on Spotify
Lets get this bread
when are you dropping that YSAC mixtape ?
when you post is always the highlight of my day, I wait sometime many months to see you post and I love it, I found your channel around episode 20, and has been my favorite series I have ever seen. Just a quick thank you for posting such great content!
Because you make 1 video every year that’s why you get less views
Really average white girly
Omg i fucking love your vids... I live for them????????
Your eggs... you just dumped them in there without letting them say goodbye.. You monster... Wait.. Halloween special. Is that your costume?
Where can I buy those sacred harvest wands?
Hi
Wait what? How did that pumpkin goo changed into pumpkin bread? Man this is spooky..
Crap! I used the milk from a Mad Cow, instead of an Angry Cow... Feeling a strong urge to go on a rampage now. Cheers!
Spoopy.
Hello random person scrolling through the comments
??????
Guess I have to go pumpkin hunting now
Bruh, that black pipe was ABS not PVC.
2:34 ????
would it be good to use chocolate chips or no also is the something im missing like a show or website or no
Screw this, I'm just gonna drink a glass of raw eggs.
Still not over that pumpkin-pie spice trauma, I see...
Cordless kinetic drill lmaooo..!!
Tasty
Please do more and don't take so long in between
This is literally my favorite channel on YouTube
ty, i needed this!

I was waiting to see why you made a fort on your Instagram
Where do you even get all these diffrent dogs from? Are you a pet sitter on the weekends??
back in my day we used to do the PEPPER PEPPER PEPPER
ugoleh dog
When are you taking this show on the road? I'd totally by a ticket or two! I wouldn't go, but I would buy a couple of tickets.
Pumpkin bread is alive. We're all dead.
YSAC my local grocery store doesn't stock spooky ingredients nor power tools. Any other suggestions on how to summon Sata.. I mean uh make your spooky pumpkin bread?
Spoopy foods
yo that blanket fort looks comfy af
Time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so
One of the best channels on YouTube hands down.
you suck at cooking, more like you suck at uploading more than once a month
10/10
These videos just keep getting better. Thank you Dr. Chef Hands for these blessings.
Sweet puppers. Bread too.
you better put that song on your soundcloud, or else...
OMG YOURE BACK
Reuben, can you find my comment?
I am not sure if I can find those ingredients ??
Another vid of YSAC making a mess, as always. Looks like you got to get out the "Ready And Go 1999+2" to clean this mess up.
New pup? Or new to you? Either way, they are wonderful! Love the song, it's EXACTLY how I feel about winter months. ??
Face reveal video question mark
Great recipe! but i tend to add a pinch of razorblades for a bit more of a blood tasting loaf.
Damnit, I’m late. Well, still loved the video. The celery orange thing looked like a plunger.
Does showing with a EGG means that he is HOW TO BASIC ? Maybe he is?
Please show your face, I will tattoo it on my bun
Aesthetic dog footage??
liked before watching, you're welcome
Your dog is even haunted
spooky
how do u have access to so many dogs
(Maybe a face reveal in a year or something?!?!?!)
This is actually a cake; no resting, batter instead of dough, waaaay sweet
It looks like afghan hash
As a aspiring pastry chef i approve of this
??????????????
Noice jams!
no one says "oops" better than you honestly
Your dog has a better life than me
yo did you steal my dog cause my dog looks like exactly like your bread dude wtf
The end song was jammin though
Yayyyyy! Tysm dude!!!
spooky
"Captured within 30 days of a full moon"
I hate this video but I thumbed it up because: reverse psychology ????
I haven't washed my ysac since last Halloween
Man I sure miss dogs, wish they didn’t go extinct
He wont like this comment.
the dog montage at the end......... so cute
I squeaked when he topples the ingredients with that blessed orange thingy
Can i use this spooky bread to feed my duck?
This made me want to make some pumpkin bread and transwangdoodle it into a poodle and play catch.
Do potato soup please!!!!!
I need that song at the end
2,000,000 subscribers face reveal
Please release the ending song as a stand alone.
Raw flour will give you salmonella before raw egg does.

Megalovania starts playing ITS SPOOKY TIME

Thanks now my house is haunted with seasonal seasoning ghosts
Piano fingers
Where is your intro
We missed u fam welcome back and do more videos fr
Btw what's the odds of you trying to land a Pineapple 360° Inverted cake/pie?
I think ysac could start a religion
That montage of your dog was so darn cute
When you try to think of something funny to say so that he responds\_(• •)_/
Your dog is a literal ball of fluff i want him
At last ur back bro????
did the doggo try the bread??
After the hibernation make a new year food or something
This reminds of someone making a possessed salad...
Bitchin video! As usual! But that song at the end was jammin! Somewhere I can purchase that beautifully orchestrated piece of heavenly majestic music?
I said I would dress up as your upload schedule for Halloween last year, my friends haven’t seen me since.
If I don't have a ghost, can I pass the water through myself if I'm dead inside?
You comedy is so pure just as this pumpkin bread
3:57 demonetized, parents disappointed, god is angry, have a good day
Just a man, his dog, and some pumpkin bread....yes....
What a great day
bro do you live in narnia?
I always come for the food .... But stay for the Jam
uuuUuuuUUUuuuu spoooOooOOoooOoopy
Why did he use a liquid measuring cup for the brown sugar then a dry cup for the flour? I'll never understand why people don't know they are different
Angry cow butter,??????????
You just made my day a whole lot better

You Suck at Singing. :-/

Welp, time to start a YSAC binge once again.

Boop
Wait, I wasn't supposed to slice it up and put it in a toaster? My life has been a lie...
Came for the bread. Stayed for the dog. ??

I'm Earlyiiissshhh??? :D GIMME ALL THE PUMPKIN PLS
ok but if it tastes like cake why is it called bread??
Diss track on god when??
That outro song was really good. Maybe the best yet.
Who the fuck disliked 7 times
Would a wooden spoon be a valid harvest wand for blessing purposes? Or am I doing this all wrong.. my pumpkin goop seems lacking
Defintely BC.. right? Great video. Have a nice day.????
Where do you live? The shots with the dogs and the water are always so pretty
Ah, the baguette. The French sacred harvest wand.
YOU SUCK AT SINGING YEAH YOU TOTALLY SUCK

Happy Tuesday. Let’s get this bread.
All I have is mad cow, will that work?
Every video you make gets funnier
I liked the song at the end.
I think I look forward to your videos more than any other channel. So damn funny.
Phillip starting to look pretty dead at this point.....call TMZ
Spooky food
All kitchen joking aside, raw flour is not safe to eat.
03:18 Damn thats my childhood..
I found the candy corn
Here before trending
but the cow is not angry what should i do :(
Roses are red, chickens go cluck you suck at cooking yeah you totally suck
The scariest thing is I’m still suck at cooking and it’s almost the end of the year, And also I still eat batter with raw eggs on it. No worries, it got blessed so it won’t be so disgusting.
YES YES YES! Thank you! <3
Thumbs up if you enjoy the jingles at the end of all his videos
GOD IS ALIVE
0:31 I don’t know man, that seems like the most complicated ingredient
This video feels like you were in a hurry to make it. More than normal.
Jeezus... YOU KIIL A PUMPKIN!!
YSAC has some deep lore. We need to conduct a study on YSAC time traveling, cuz this is getting out of hand
Pepper pepper pepper
Trumpkin bread.
Thank you.
I wonder if fans from farther south watch this episode and wonder why half of the episode is being passive aggressive toward winter. I'm from Minnesota, so instead of enjoying fall I whinge and yell at the sky for taking away my 16 hour days and turning them into 8 hour days. The sun sets before I can get home from work in mid Winter. I should get a SAD lamp too, thanks for reminding me.
Another hilarious video!!!
0:28 Can I use Diet Ghost?
YAY JUST IN TIME, I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP
oh no the white girls are coming
Next Video Coming 2019
Damn, I was hoping to be better than his mom
I hope you upload more videos man because it helps me to be happy and forget what is happening in this cruel, cruel world
Omg ?????? this was so funny
Oh wait shit I'm early
I thought your channel dead
Why do so many annoying hipsters subscribe to this channel???
lets get this ???read
H A U N T E D
I can beat your mom in a cooking 1v1
sooo.... just gotta wait another month or so until a new video then
So, if you made a scary pumpkin bread using some frightened ingredients, does that mean that when I'm scared of people it makes me ready to spook some people on Halloween?
I've been blessed with pumpkin bread this morning. Thank you wangjangle gods.
great vid bro keep up the good work
That baguette looks like it was violated....??
I’m sorry but that toothpick scene was WAYYY too sexual for me. ??
So I have low haunted seasoning will that still work?
Yassssss
Getting Car Seat Headrest vibes from the song. Keep it up ????
I showed my step son your channel one day and he got hooked. Every time he comes over he wants to see a new video! post more please? Already watched all you have out there
I’m am the 303rd comment
James I love you. Wanna live a mutually abusive relationship together until nothing in life matters anymore?
ily
Finally men! soo good to see another new video! love ya
this channel is what you'd get if Exurb1a and binging with Babish had a kid. i love it.
Pumpkin bread comes out the same color it went in. Fact.
hope you have a good day. thanks for the recipe and the laughs
Pumpkin spice season is almost over. The two months of Xmas are almost upon us.
Omg i have the same hand mixer (/???)/
Ahh ysac. You don’t post often, but when you do you know it’s gonna be good.
OUH MY GOD YOURE FINALLY BACK
Omg, it looks good. I'm starvingggg.
Pupper footage made my day.
Damn it! The cow wasn't angry enough. I was so confident in my ability to piss everyone off and I have failed. Well, I give up.... I'm kidding. I hate to lose. I'm bringing in the big guns (my friend. He can piss of anyone. First he makes you laugh. Then he's lying on the floor covered in blood. Oops) The funny thing is: I was halfway through a sad video, mourning the loss of my favourite character before I noticed this video and came to cheer myself up before going back into mourning
What is this? Hogwarts?
I'm having trouble going for that autumnal forest walk. Any advice?
I NEED MOAR VIDS COOKING! I'm just kidding it takes so long because you pour your heart and soul into these videos. I'll wait :)

“You suck at cooking ya you totally SUCK”
Good morning. Have an excellent day why dontchya.
Yay! Another YouTuber from the great state of Texas!
On one hand I literally cannot believe that anyone who once lived in Washington would ever voluntarily return to place like Texas, and on the other hand is literally impossible for anyone who’s not a millionaire to have a kitchen that large anywhere near Seattle
The attachment you had on the kitchen aid originally would have been best to beat the cream cheese. What you added was a whisk which is intended for more liquidy substances like eggs.
For your next review you should take a look at Volcanic Panic. It is such a weird edutainment game, although it is kind of fun.
"Bobby I tell ya h'what that is some good yum yum. You don't even need any propane accessories to make it!"
"Texas desserts" He didn't even make Frito Pie. For shame.
BOP IT!!
Great video as usual, but I'm really starting to want something other than food videos. Just my opinion though
You should do a video on Pajama Sam 4: Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff! Its actually real
What in Sam hell did I just watch
i mean... thats not really how you fold but it worked out in the end! but please if you ever do bake something in a future brutalfoods please learn how to fold properly, it could mess up the dish and make it flat if you dont fold it right ;;
Don’t pretend to be a redneck it’s weird
No Ian folding is when you take a big spoon or rubber spatula and gently scoop the bottom onto the top of itself and you repeatedly until it’s all mixed this is done so that it doesn’t loose it’s fluff and it’s less dense you don’t need a mixer
Most underrated YouTuber. Your level of quality is very rare...steak.
I live in Texas. I'm glad your in my state! : )
I thought it was illegal to be gay while riding a bull in Texas. The bull is libel. Bull letting dummy on his back for dumb bullshit vids ... to the farm .
i love your vids omg make life amusing and entertaining again
I'm glad to be in texas
Not. Enough. Y'alls. If you want to represent Texas cuisin properly you can NOT skimp on the Y'ALLS !
Thats what I like to call A Plop
Fu*k u make more televoid..end that sh*t but not fast atleast add 2 to 4 episode
has Ian finally transformed his channel into a cooking channel ?
try takis
You really need to do one of these with your friends, it would be funny to just see you and Austin both competitively cooking your own respective dish
love your fridge, just popsicles huh?
The editing in these videos is top notch. Hoping the next video is either a game review or another Yugioh product
I made the Texas Yum-Yum! The only change I'd make is the store-bought crust; I got two smaller graham cracker crusts, which were perfect for the same amount of filling, but the taste of the crusts themselves was a little lackluster. I'm going with two crusts of the same size next time, but I'll make them myself for better flavor. Even with the generic crusts, though, it was pretty tasty. My friends had seconds (and thirds!), and my dad gave me formal permission to make it for family dinners in the future.
More like Brutalmousse, am I right?
i love me some brutal foods! x3 MMMM-mmmm! (seriously though. great show. im very entertained)
look teaster
The most befuddling thing about this video is how after a certain point the line between Ian’s cowboy accent and his actual Texan accent fades into obscurity
The hell happened to the game reviews?
"Mm them suckers tasty!" Brutal Moose
Should I be worried Ian is keeping 30 men in his freezer?
I like how Plops can make both cow and horse noises. What a versatile fellow.
I don’t want to get to the age where I worry about breaking a tooth on a sweet
Not a fan of pudding but that cowboy bark looks very tasty.
You should check out binging with babish his basics series has some good tips
Tip: use a rubber spatula to push the confectioner's sugar off the side of the bowl a couple of times during mixing (like, turn it off, scrape down, turn it back on. Don't scrape while it's running). Anyway, this pie looks so good. Looks better than the allrecipes picture IMO. Honestly I'd just skip the vanilla pudding. Just the chocolate pudding and the whipped cream mixture would be delicious.
No, no more food shit, I’m gonna lose my fucking mind ?????
For whipped cream you are supposed to go slow to fast when mixing
Not gonna lie I actually thought that kitchen was green screened for some reason. Then he opened the fridge and I thought “oh shit, it’s actually real”
My wife claims she can make anything better than you. (We are fans btw)
Is it just me or does Ian’s legs look shorter?
You know, you might like "Super Seducer" - it's a game filled with FMV! It's basically like a "choose your own adventure" kind of thing. You get good choices and bad ones, it's pretty hilarious!
Look up folding on YouTube
I have zero idea who else has been able to give you any tips but here's mine to add to the pile: - You can do the same thing you did with the Werther's with the peanuts, almonds, pretzels, and Oreos. A heavy rolling pin will work much better then a hammer though since it's wider and you'll be able to, once everything is a decent size, roll the pin over all your pieces to help break them down into smaller pieces. - To help some the confectioner sugar problem, turn off the mixer once in a while and scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Depending on how much sugar you're using, you could only need to do it once since confectioner sugar pretty much melts instantly when in contact with any wet ingredient. Spatula's are pretty much your very best friend when it comes to getting anything out of a bowl.
Question, do you have to be riding a bull while making these desserts or is that part optional?
i grew up in texas and i ain't never heard of none of this
this looks like one of jenna marbles' old kitchens
Holy shit I cant stop laughing at the Farmers Only page. " Preferred body type: Living or recently deceased"
Folding means to move from the outer edge to the centre while mixing, usually with a rubber spatula. Also that is one sexy kitchen.
Nice kitchen dude! I guess it's true what they say about Texas.
every time ian pulls out the whisk something in the back of my mind just goes “god dammit”
1:36 stealthy myst joke! nice nice
Rattlesnake on another rattlesnake
Ian, your editing is so beautiful; love it, man.
Watching you manhandle that KitchenAid hurt my soul
You should typically fold anything with whipped egg whites with a rubber spatula, so you don't deflate the egg white's stiff peaks.
I was having a bland day till I saw this Brutal Moose video
do you do weird movements on purpose to edit later, or do you just notice them and add weird edits?
Still waitimg for Plops fanart to show up
I love your channel so much since you started doing these videos
Howdy from Dallas! Love you Ian <3
Remember to watch your sugar intake. Its so bad for you in many ways but if you become diabetic you're fucked.
on this episode of "ian learns how to use a mixer"
Your videos always feel like slightly terrifying fever dreams
The fucking sound effects. Bring the whole thing together.
The echo is terrible
Don’t let PETA see this.
Whenever i react to your videos i find other peoples demons come out of me and i catch it and tell them all to go home and let my soul breathe
His Kool Aid tho
Damn Ian, your hair makes you look like the MOST majestic cowboy.
stay amazing
I appreciate your work.
Where do you live again? Because your local store sounds super crappy.
32:30 Plops plopped.
Remember when Ian used to review video games
This is so f÷%×ing stupid

I'm gonna miss the cramped kitchen All hail the open wide one
My buddy. My pal. My man. I’m gluten free and they’re very different. But now I feel you should do a weird gluten free food episode :p
What was the intro music?
Ooooh a new brutalfoods kitchen? So big and fancy!
15:11 I feel like there was a missed opportunity to do an echo effect on the word somewhere and have a kind of "lost in space" thing. xD Other that the editing is amazing as always. Love your stuff!
Big yeehaw energy
SPAH'S SAPPIN' MAH TASTY TREATS ! YeeY !
i love brutalfoods more than anything else!!!! AMAZING!!!!
19:09 to 19:20 had me laughing so hard
Don't you mean Tasty Stupid Treats?
My beautiful moosy boy! ??

This guy reminds me of a pinterest post gone bad... except he seems proud of his fails.
its cooking cowboy jesus
Boooowls
i feel like you're secretly a DJ, you sample yourself more than Skrillex.
recipes are not direct directions instead you sure use it as a guide so that the thing your making goes well . so maybe next time making this you should think maybe you should put less of (this) or more of (that). for example the pudding you put in the first recipe but you could not listen as watching you messing up is kinda entertaining.
you should get yourself a meat tenderizer for the kitchen. It's just a mallet with spikes on one side, but it's got more surface area on the heads so it doesn't damage the food (or the table for that matter)
10:15 more like phoned it in xD
I recently discoverd this channel, and I gotta say: It cracks me up. The gamevideos but especially the Brutalfoods stuff. I love the editing work. So much thought and detail, fun, cheesy soundeffects and even self-mockery. It's hilarious and awesome. You've got yourself a new sub, sir.
That's an awesome kitchen. I'd wager you're either around the Frisco area or the Mid-Cities?
Brutalfoods suggestion: Plz review the frozen microwave white castle cheeseburgers and hamburgers
As a baker I'm like screaming at the screen. When you are mixing ingredients you need to stop the mixing and scrape the sides in then continue mixing. You also folded it wrong. Also it's easy when everything is room temperature when baking well at least for me Personally I would have chilled each layer to make it spread better
Mmm, that oversized fridge blocking the door triggers meeee
#stopyeehawbullabuse
If there weren't these random bits of editing in there, Ian's vids would not be the same.
After watching a few of your videos I know now why so many americans are that „mega fat“-kind. How many calories does that thing have and how many grams of sugar? I‘m fat but just watching this I feel like I would get an instant sugar shock xD
Agh! Ian nooo. You do not fold things in using a stand mixer. You remove the bowl, take a silicone spatula and fold everything in by hand. See this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZcebw9XZo With the bark: you mentioned a really hard time eating it. The chocolate needs to be a bit thinner, and less toppings next time, which makes it easier to eat. Hope this helped.
Try making something with Vienna Sausages ??
Idk why but this got me in a Christmas-y mood
Any chance we could see a Brutalfoods and Cheftronic crossover episode some day ? That would be hilarious.
i feel like the reason i like your videos so much is that we are kindred spirits brothers in pun, united by japes good video ian 10/10 i hope plops is treating u well
PRO SOUTHERN BAKING TIP TIME!!! Cream cheese beats way easier if it's room temp. Next time you use it, leave it out for an hour or two before you use it. It'll combine better and be less chunky. Welcome back to yeehaw territory, buckaroo.
I was left with the satisfactory taste of these foods, my mouth then said Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
15:03 so when your an old man you'll go to a sadistic jail that pits you against other inmates in endurace competitions because you stole a bag of werthers?
You've yee'd my last haw, partnet.
Hey Ian how was eating at Whataburger again
oh...OH...ohhhh
Glad to see that the "plop" sound effect makes a return.
That's just a theory... A FOOD THEORY!!
Ian, I love you but I honestly never realized how much of a giant pussy you are... I hate sounding like a dick but you're a gentle little flower are ya? ??
"Beat it until it's soft" - Brutalmoose
That edit at 20:43.... Damn that was slick
THAT was, but this isn't.
good video love the editing its pretty good keep it up on those sound effects dude
I see you over there at ohio
Get a kitchen hammer
Watching you cook is just so.... mesmerizing. Like you're so bad at it but you're trying and it's adorable but it bugs me too and it's just so fascinating
Your editing is the best and funniest!!
#Smallmonds
Happy brutalween
The Take 5 bar is so underrated.
Lol I love how your microwave says "your food is ready"
Your eyes are saying "Why did I do this?"
Mr. Ian, it has come to my attention you failed basic english. You see, when the instructions said to FOLD in the whipped cream in, you used the MIXING machine. In order to FOLD in whipped cream, you need a spatula and literally FOLD the cream into the mix. Overall 3/10 would recommend
Holy shit, man I'm from Oklahoma.
fold in is basically gently stir it by taking the stuff on the bottom and fold it over to the top with like a spatula i recommend looking up a video
Hi Ian! It’s not your fault the Kitchenaid Mini didn’t scrape the bottom of the bowl. It has to be adjusted the first time you use it, with a coin in the screw on the side. You just turn it, try it out, turn a little more, until you can hear the paddle scrape softly on the side of the bowl. Looking forward to more Brutalfoods and hope Texas is treating you well! Love from Germany
West Virginia
Hi Ian, long time fan, an idea for a future episode of Brutalfoods, Chocolate Cola Muffins! I make them all the time and them suckers tasty ?? my wife, nephew and myself love you and your food videos keep up the great work, Jonathon, Amanda & Jake ??????
Oooh, I like your fancy turn table!
It's pretty cool knowing one of my favorite YouTubers also lives in Texas though I live in Lubbock it's still cool
New kitchen is really good but i missed old kitchen :(
30:20 "isorrowproductions here with another game of Hearts of Iron IV, diabetes only"
Guys, I think he really enjoywd that "Texas Yum Yum"
Yay~ More brutalfoods :D How to fold, translated into texan (accent: stereotypical) [because aren't I so witty] 1) Carefully scoop yer light stuff on top of yer heavy shit. 2) Wit yer mighteh spatuler, hold yer wedge blade at a ninteh degree angle per-pen-dic-u-lar to dat giant ass bowl of yers. 3) Slowly drop yer spatuler til it hits rock bott'm. 4) Rotate yer bowl thirty-three degrees (or a smidgen, just not a rooting tootin rotation, save that for rodeo partner), while spatuler still in the fillin'. 5) Once yer done rotatin' that tarnation, scrap the spatuler on the opposite side of the bowl til bottoms up. 6) Bring the spatuler back to where you started, but don't you tread on that mixin's durin' so, son, and repeat that darn tootin' process 'til the lord sayeth otherwise cowboy. Normally folding doesn't matter unless you need the fluffiness is integral to the structure of the dish (like souffles, or those weird jesus cookies my mother made that one easter to teach us the resurrection before I decided me and her god weren't friends any more, etc), so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Also, you might not want to call out to ramsay he might die seeing you chop with a knife (you could just do a pulse or two in a blender/food processor if you have one)
I just made buttercream frosting in an electric mixer before watching this, so the struggles you were facing with it were hilarious anf relateable. My stuff always gets stuck to the sides, too.
I absolutely love this video, I've watched it at least 5 times in the last 48 hours, love your videos brutalmoose!! :)
I must say, watching your videos is like escaping the bullcrap of the rest of the world??
It makes me so sad that he didnt even mix the ingeidients knowing well enough that thw mixer didnt do a good job on the sides of thw bowl lol
ian how could you betray me like this,,, gluten free pretzels are more dense, sweeter, and crunchier. the superior pretzel. everyone ive ever talked to prefers gluten free pretzels to regular. slanderous cowman
The beginning is an accurate representation of how we do things in Texas.
Ian, just wanted to let you know that you are my absolute favorite Youtuber. You are the only person I ever get excited about when I see you have a new video up. Keep on keepin on, son.
Thats not really how you fold cream, try wikihow, they know everything.
9:09 your wish can come true if you get the spoon that you had at 4:15 to clean the sides
im making the fuck out of texas yum yum sometime very soon lMAO looks like you're in a house now!!! congrazzi!!!
do you have any thoughts on continuing telivoid? it got left of a cliffhanger.....................
Dark chocolate is one of my favorites! ... 70% is the best :P
It was painful to watch you miss the salt, that recipe needs it. So of course it was not as good :(
Normally, I'd approve of a big kitchen. But when Ian's not fumbling around in what's essentially a back alley with a sink, I feel like we're missing a certain... something. An extra layer of unneeded difficulty that we need.
Not mixing the two, bummer
brutalmoose You still haven’t covered the award winning pc game The Sims 2
Folding it in is to like put it on a spatula thingie and just fold it in. the whole point is to avoid mixing as to not destroy all the air bubbles and keep it light
i'm so glad i'm subscribed to you bro! keep on the great work :)
Boi that is NOT how you fold it in. Use a rubber spatualy to LITERALY fold it over and over gently. Take a quick look at a binging w babish vid.
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: Softened means you let it warm to room temperature Using a stand mixer you have to pause a few times to scrape down the bowl to make sure everything is evenly mixed Folding is where you put a fluffy ingredient over a dense one. You push your mixing tool into the middle and scoop across the bottom toward one edge, up the side and back toward the center of the top. Then you turn the bowl a small amount and repeat until everything is mixed in.
Texass
Ian! To fold something in means to incorporate slowly with the help of a scraper in such a motion that you lose as little air as possible, it's kind of a circular motion, you'd have to look it up, it's hard to describe. It is done with very light preparations like meringue, or creams. It is done by hand. Sincerely, a gastronomy student. Good luck next time you fold something!
"not sure if it's gonna make it through the crust" literally holding a device made for crust (etc.) cutting Oh, protip: when slicing a pie, to avoid making a mess of the first piece, cut out the pieces next to the one you want, so the first retains shape on exit.
Ian I Love You But Your Kitchen Has So Much Echo
“I’ll shower you in coconut cream pie”
btw, when you measure out something like confectioners sugar or flour, you are supposed to use a sifter and sift into the measuring up, otherwise you're using way too much as it'll be packed into the cup.
you thought gluten-free pretzels were the same as normal pretzels? my dude, how did you live to adulthood being this clueless? and you were surprised by the hard chocolate after keeping it in the freezer for half an hour? and you couldn't foresee the need to press the toppings on the chocolate down to make them stick? and you didnt realise that if you filled up the pie crust with chocolate pudding, nothing else would fit? some of these aren't even cooking errors, they're like navigating the world properly-errors, like pouring a glass full of milk and continuing to pour. i guess i shouldnt complain since thats what i watch for. also "folding" something means that you take a spatula and fold the new ingredient into the mixture by, you know, lifting it up and folding it over itself. like... the meaning of the word 'folding'? oh and "beating" means mixing fast, which is also implied in the name. you are a clown of a person. love u.
Also less chocolate. Speaking from experience
considering you used 2 bags of chocolate morsels, I would do 1 dark and 1 milk.
Nice
at 4:46 turns into ana Kryczbowtv's mushroomland series.
That Texas yum yum reminds me of something I used to make when I was a kid called black bottom pie or something. It was almost exactly the same except for one extra layer at the bottom that was lightly melted chocolate chips. I've gone off chocolate as I've gotten older but I remember really liking it.
darn, never ran into any youtubers in washington, although i ran into the completionist in LAX
Another bark you can do: Milk chocolate bark with crushed candy canes. It's a nice Christmas treat. Oreo truffles are good also. Mum taught me these. (Metric measurements, so bear with me) 300 grams Oreos. 250 grams softened cream cheese. One standard block of chocolate. (I use Cadbury milk chocolate.) Method: -Crush Oreos fine. (In the bag works for the crushing process) -Combine with softened cream cheese. (Make sure it's soft!) -Melt chocolate bar. (You can break into squares and melt in the microwave. Thirty second increments, make sure to use a fork to stir and make sure it's free of lumps.) -Make golf ball sized (Or smaller, but not too small) balls out of the combined cream cheese and Oreo mixture. -Coat them with melted chocolate. -Place onto a tray lined with baking paper. -Chill in fridge for at least two hours and then devour! It's like a ball of Oreo cheesecake covered in chocolate.
Increase mixer speed to high with the whisk attachment to fling everything out into the bowl (instead of sticking to the whisk)
Couple tips from a culinary student, a thread.... To start, when your chopping maybe spread a damp paper towel under tout cutting board, to stop it from sliding around so much. your technique needs work, but not the worst, i would just try to keep the knife down on the board and rock it with the tip always staying on the board.
I love the cooking/tasting videos!! They’re great and I hope you do more!!
In the UK we have a pasty called "yumyums" and they're really sweet and usually covered in sugar
idk what i was expecting with ian cooking but wow that made me physically recoil at almost every step. you’re doing great, keep up the good work
10:37 you made The Stuff god help us all
The pudding looks really good and I'm so happy he came in on that bull in stay the costume for the rest of the video too funny ??
I don’t love chocolate pudding. It’s disgusting.
If you heated the choclate in the oven on the paper you wouldnt need to use a bowl
19:25 chocolate rain
folks, I was literally thinking "partner, y'didnt even dress fer the occasion. points taken off." but points're bein added. this cowboy is mighty happy
Come on Ian.... you just didn't want salt, we can understand
My boyfriend and I were drinking and watching your video. Then we saw your "folding" technique and decided we needed more alcohol.
You remind me of Blake from Workaholics
For the peanuts. Just throw the amount you need in a plastic zip bag, get a cutting board, put an at least once folded dish cloth between the table and the cutting board, put the closed zip bag onto the board and then..... HAMMER DEEZ NUTS DOWN. I recommend getting a wooden meat tenderizer hammer, since they are quite wide and also useful for things like tenderizing meat if you don't crush peanuts.
Is no one gonna tell him that isn't folding...?
Take 5 is good tho
you should do a gluten free taste test of original foods compared to there gluten free counter partners
Why would you leave Washington???
I love how much fun you have shooting and editing your videos and they're so creative and interesting because of it. I think you're the youtuber I get most excited for when your notification pops up saying you uploaded. You could literally just make a video where you microwaved your leftovers and I would watch it. Please keep making awesome stuff!
where i live howdy is a very kind and warm welcome
as a joke you should cook some beef on a future episode and this is plops and then so him with a rips sign, then a sad montage, and then cook the beef as if it was him your costume, who agrees leave a comment on thumbs up, if like this idea!
That clock is really doing the work back there. Might want to start paying it for keeping track of time so well.
The Texas Yum Yum reminds me of a dessert my friend makes. It’s graham cracker crust, cherry pie filling, whipped topping, and I think there’s 1 more ingredient I’m forgetting. It’s pure sugar and tastes really good.
for the pudding one you should let it freeze some more till its almost sold, really tasty that way
P L O P S I S D I S P L E A S E D W I T H Y O U R O F F E R I N G
Is this like the third kitchen you've been in on this series?
get a haircut
Ian, this is how you fold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L44FtTXTxWk Great vids man, I'm always excited to see a new vid from you :)
The Bop-It noises when you were taking off the mixer killed me
0 out of 10, you didnt even fold it
i am instantly offended
0/10 for folding. thats mixing not folding
Faster than a rattlesnake on a second rattlesnake.
Your editing always makes me happy
Plops needs to be a recurring character.

Who edits his videos? They do an amazing job lol
where's the game reviewing?
I think the channel name should be You Suck at Cooking
You're an idiot...in the best way possible!
I find your lack of kitchen aid knowledge disturbing.
hope you have settled in your home
If you want to make the bark again, just use a broken up Heath bar for the toffee, though maybe crush it up as fine as you did the Werthers so it doesn't break your teeth. Also, a crushed up Butterfinger bar would have been amazing. Glad to see you're learning some great techniques. :)
This video made my day.
Instead of werther's, use crumbled up heath bars.
Aw man can’t wait for the episode where Moosey cooks Plops Steaks
Only you and Gordon Ramsey can making cooking look fun.
We definitely talk like that here
Browsing through cooking videos(stoned of course, weed just became legal here), but man these are awesome to watch sober or not, you’ve really figured out how to captivate an audience and keep them entertained, instead of just talking and showing us how to cook, you add in these little extra bits to the video that make it more exciting to watch, I can say I’ve never once laughed my ass off at a channel about cooking! definitely subscribing, keep making these awesome videos!
love from Dallas ???

Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
Texas seems like such a wonderful place. I have a friend from Sherman and he talks about it sometimes.
What part Texas u in sun
I'll say it again, these are so great.
Damn, child, guittard chocolate?! Dems some fancy eats. ??
I'm German and the way you pronounced Werther´s hurt my ears pretty badly xD | I liked the video though ! (Also pretzels sounds fckng weird to me haha)
6:57 when I load up PornHub for the 6th time that day
This was in my recommendations for some reason, and I clicked on it expecting to see a pro in the kitchen, and instead I just watched a video of what it looks like when I try to follow a recipe ??
When I saw you substituting werther's HARD candy for toffee, I said outloud nooo. You don't want to put something that hard on stuff you need to chew. Give that at a party and all your guests will crack a tooth. LOL.
I like how Americans call, throwing boxes of processed food together…. a 'recipe'
When things get stuck on the mixer, put it at a higher speed. It will separate and attach to the bowl like it should.
I... I don't know whether this lack of knowledge is scripted or not, but either way, I absolutely love it. The funniest thing to watch. But also the saddest because it insinuates that Ian has barely baked anything before-- (p.s. ian, if you honestly don't know... invest in a rubber spatula thingy to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl.... pls)
plop
Ian your editing gets me every time. when you squashed that guy with a bowl and then his ghost flew up i lost it
i love this show so much! please never look up cooking tips or how to do things, your stumbling through is the best part!
Sea salt on dark chocolate is amazing, would have probably helped your bark. Plop

Why do you have backup pretzels? We barely even have normal pretzels.
I miss the tiny kitchen
Just looking at the layers that was WAY to much milk. Was the cup and a half from the pudding box or from their recipe?
>texas desserts >no texas sheet cake Understandable tbh. I never had it until I was adult, despite living in Texas my entire life. It seems like a more rural thing, since the only times I've had one I didn't just buy from H-E-B were when visiting my grandaunt's family on the farm. But damn is it amazing. It's sweet and moist, but kind of subtle. Make sure to make one with brown sugar icing.
Great video, i'd advice to thin out your chocolate and even it out more, you had some really thicc chocolate, so no wonder it's overpowering.
Smallmonds.
This editing is amazing, sort of reminds me of Tim and Eric
Can I borrow some of your glorious hair good sir?
I never realized he's from Texas, I guess he does a good job of hiding the accent when he's doing videos.

Wow. Don’t know how I found you dude but I’m glad I did! Great content! I’m from Dallas,Tx too!
Back in Texas, huh? Does that mean more collars with PBG?
The editing is on point.
You may want to get an electric wisk for the puddin', and a drink blender for the nuts and oreos. As for the Werther's you want to melt them down 1st like with chocolate then pour it thin on parchment paper thin it out let it set then take a mallet to it to break it down. Then if finer pieces are needed you can put the crushed thin Werther's chunks into the blender.
Why did u get it
You in the country now boy !
America.
I never thought you lived In Texas the Place I live
Is that really how you think Texans talk? I'm offended quite frankly. Your standards are waaaay too high
Now that you're back in Texas, you gotta stop saying "you guys" and start saying "y'all" again.
invite me over and ill cook with you :^)
Welcome back to the greatest state in the union!
Welcome back ian. ?? Looking forward to more future videos.

What kind of grocery store does this man go to
The thing you should've done while making the layers for the "Texas Yum Yum" is that you should've put the pie in the freezer/fridge for each layer. (Also if my English is horrible I'm sorry it's late)
I have officially changed my Horse's name to Plops on Red Dead 2
cooking tips from a cook in training every time you use a cut put a damp cloth under the board makes it more stable, and it makes to easier to chop. when chopping use the tip as a pivot and cut with the heel hand on the back of nife apply downward forces then rotate by 5 to 10 degrees and down again until you reach the maximum you can and go do the same in the other derecshen as fast as you can , ps aly warcks as good as sharp the knife is. try a cloth bag or a rag tied shut then brack the candy in it less loss of smashed goods.
You didn't correctly fold it in
Already been commented, but damn that's a nice new kitchen.
when using a stand mixer youre supposed to scrape the ingredients off the side of the bowl every so often so everything gets incorporated properly to fold ingredients, you take something like a spatula and mix by gently placing the spatula to the bottom of the bowl and fold the ingredients at the bottom of the bowl over the ingredients at the top of the bowl (hence the term "folding"- im bad at explaining things so try googling it if u still dont know how, or try watching like. rosanna pansino or smth) toffee and caramel are slightly different, in that caramel is often just caramalized sugar (which is just heated sugar with a little water added) while toffee is sugar and butter (sometimes with a flavouring) you could have very easily made your own toffee had you so desired however, in the end, none of this matters as long as you like how the final product came out, but just for future reference ig :0c
Why isn’t this a show on the food network channel
I was definitely wondering why you had gluten free pretzels. They do taste different, but I actually like them better. They taste fancier to me, but also less strong on the pretzel flavor. But I also haven't had the real thing in years, for reasons you may suspect.
Damn you always upload such quality content with great editing. Keep it up!
Your food makes me horny
Whenever cutting nuts you should roll the knife
fuck you ian
This is some top-notch video editing and composition. Watching these is always incredible.
you should rename this video "ian vs the kitchen aid"
Damn what shitty store are you going to where they don't have heath bars and all pretzals are gluten free
plops made a big oopsie but he still a thiccy
sniffffff, GOOD
How did you escape the televoid

More of this crap please less of the other crap thank you.
This is very spooky! just in time for Halloween!!!! ??!
You have the same model mixer as me! Nice. Those boys are good.
I like Brutal Foods because it's like watching those people from infomercials trying to cook.
It was so yum they had to put 2 to really sell how yum it is
Pro tip: don't follow instructions.
A cup of sugar... holyshit. 4tbs already kinda sweet with that size
Lost it already at "seeking a: cowpoke"

Pudding pies are great, but I loOOoOoOoove Icebox cake. Just a layer of graham cracker, a nice heaping layer of pudding, more graham cracker, more pudding, then cool whip on the top. Simple, but sooooooo... yumyum. XD Pudding in general is just amazing.
You were definitely in the gluten free section lol, pretzels are just another baked good. Also, Schär gluten free pretzels are as good as normal pretzels, if you want gluten free ones I recommend those.

33 Minutes of Red Dead Redemption 2 Gameplay
18:24 You... NAILED IT!
Great, now I’m craving every single thing in the video. Had to laugh at the “folding” segment, folding is done by hand, not with a machine, the machine just mixes it. You get a large bowl, put your cream cheese stuff in, then with a spatula you scoop some topping up, lay it on top of the cream cheese, then flip that part over. Keep adding topping and flipping over the section you laid it on. If it doesn’t seem very even try scooping up a section of cream cheese/topping and flipping it over on top of another section until it seems fairly uniform. The idea is you want layers of different things to accentuate the different flavors and textures, not a uniform paste.
We don't take too kindly to folk like you 'round these parts.
We'Re GoNnA cOoK yOu On A fUtUrE ePiSoDe
See ya later partner.
When you grabbed the mixing piece with four fingers I just thought to myself: you fucking savage.
Who the hell dislikes a video with this much time put into it? Even if they didn't like it they could still appreciate the effort. :/ ian gang out ??.
If the mixer doesn't get the sides very well you got to scrape the contents of the bowl back into the center with a spoon or rubber spatula.
30 men in the freezer
THIS NEEDS TO BE A NETFLIX SHOW!!
My gran from makes a version of the chocolate bark. Much fewer ingredients though. I never realized it was a texas thing.
I don't like chocolate pudding.
Salt supposedly reduces bitterness, so maybe the dark chocolate would be less overpowering with that extra bit of salt. Suuuper jealous of your kitchen btw.

You're a Texan? You were really giving me Canadian vibes
This video receives 2 Plop points for its two uses of the sound bite "Plop"
i just realized why i love your editing so much. its very Bill Wurtz -esq. and i mean that as the biggest compliment.
I had a feeling he was going to over do the candy smashing
dawg. I love this shit. at first, i was very resentful because i enjoyed game reviews more. but this is a great evolution of content
Love the Halloween costume
I miss the pc game reviews but this shit is still great
Your editing is amazing ian
Love the Bop-It reference hidden in there
moose? in my city? you bet im bout to catch him on the streets. gonna give him a TV dinner.
At what point did you realize that your channel was destined for cooking videos?
You should invest in a food processor, it helps speed up the process when it comes to chopping, plus less hammers needed. I love your videos and watching you grow and learn more about cooking while enjoying yourself. Also, I love your editing so much, your style is so unique and fresh. I appreciate you so much, for every bit of content you do!
lol you got gluten free pretzels edit: yes they are different PS your grocery store sucks
I swear your editing is some of the most entertaining, creative and wacky stuff I've ever seen. 11/10 hats off good sir.
Hey! My mom has celiacs disease, and you should avoid Gluteno honestly. The quality of their foods (particularly crackers) is not very good. I've found far more delicious gluten free alternatives than their brand ??
so, idk how it happened, but this became a meme food review channel, and i'm okay with this.

As a native Texan, I approve this message Y'all. Also welcome to Texas, Ian. Enjoy your stay?
Ian when are you getting a brutalmoose fursuit
Please make more videos about video games and movies
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great
The clock never changes its time. This all took place in one single moment.
Isnt Texas yumyum just Mississippi mud pie?
Ian you could've just broken the candy with a rolling pin without breaking the bag and having to leave the room!
0:37 I think that’s the river in downtown San Antonio
Watching Ian cook is both adorable and frustrating at the same time! It’s like watching a stubborn child try to figure something out by themselves. On one hand, you wanna say, “D’aw! Keep it up buddy! You’ll get it!” But on the other hand it’s like, “omfg just let me show you how to do this ya little brat! I love you but I have things to do before I turn 90!”
Have you heard of Oreo Pudding Pie? It's goood...
He doesn't live in the Texan south, he doesn't know what REAL Texan cuisine is
btw to get the sides u gotta turn of the mixer, scrape down the sides, n start again. ALWAYS SCRAPE DOWN THE STUFF ON THE SIDES CUZ MIXERS DON'T GET IT! U also could've microwaved the frozen whipped topping for like 10 to 30 seconds to make it a bit softer to spread.
To fold something in, you add it to the mixture, used a spatula to dig to the bottom of the bowl and pretend that you're folding an omelet over. Do that a few more times until it's mixed. Also, with a mixer, be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl every now and then!
im from Texas im pretty sure the accent that people do is exaggerated but i say y'all alot i say y'all too much actually
I live in texas and i never seen some of this shit wtf
Wait are you in dallas?? Fan meetup pleeeeaaase
Is this Red Dead Redemption 2?
Texas Yum Yum, I've had it before, as my sister lived several years in Texas, and would make it when she came home for Christmas. Good stuff.
Chorp plop bowl make more food videos this one was great
Red Dead 2 is looking pretty good
Are you really gonna scroll past this without saying Howdy?
Man, never stop making videos.
Red dead redemption 2 looks amazing
Hola coming from Dallas
Dude... just scrape down the sides with the spatula. I love your videos but damn do they make me happy my school made everyone take 2 terms of Home Ec lol. Also made us take 2 of Wood Shop, then you chose the rest. I appreciate the balance. You shouldn't measure the ingredients with the wrapper on XD
#SprinkleBae
Hi ian! im also an amateur chef! im pretty sure you were doing well with chopping those nuts at around 16:26, also, when you used the flat of the knife to crush some of them, that is also something you can do! just not for hard things like nuts. more so for garlic imho. try using a meat tenderizer (any hard object) against the nuts when they're in a couple plastic bags instead, next time. Edit: oh lmao, you did that with the werther's
Rolling pin does a better job.
Crushed Heath Bar is a nice substitute for crushed toffee bits.
when you're crushing buts you should use the side of the blade-
Use a rubber spatula to scrape the inside of the mixing bowl and to fold in the whipped cream.
Love this
So you probably figured this out by now, but you were using the whisking head at first on your electrical mixer. That's no good for thicker ingredients like cream cheese. Also, minor note, when the recipie calls to "fold in" something, you're supposed to make a flipping motion and repeatedly "flip" the base mixture over the ingredient you're adding. I know it might seem unimportant (it wasn't for this recipie) but if you're baking something and the batter isn't mixed propretly, the product may deflate or not bake correctly. This looked great by the way. Totally making that Cowboy Bark. Thanks for showcasing these recipies.
I question anyone so confounded by simple pudding. And there's no way you can go from a tiny apartment to that tricked out kitchen. Somebody moved back in with the family. No shame just saying.
I think the kitchen is so biiiig that now there’s a multiple Ian’s coming out of nowhere
"Preferred body type: Living or recently deceased"
You remind me of Kurtis Conner in the best way possible.
Ok, but Ian is fr hot.
Try it with tapioca
next time, add the salt straight to the chocolate for the base to cut through the richness just a little, and maybe marble some peanut butter/dolce delece in as well. i also wouldn't add oreos as it makes the texture too hard, but add more pretzels definately. also, maybe some freshly cooked, blitzed bacon--just be sure to drain any grease. (i know it sounds weird, but honestly with the nuts, pretzels, salt, etc. already there it would actually work surprisingly well. just don't use milk chocolate for your base if you ever try it.) PS next time you chop nuts, just use a blitzer/food precessor. no muss, no fuss is the Texan way.
Ian: lemme put extra chocolate Ian later on: chocolate is overpowering Never change
Oh yes!!! Yes!!!!!
this video was really stinkin' good
I didn't scowl on my yum yum and it tased a lot worse
noooo you moved out of seattle? i was hoping to someday bump into you
Watching you fuck up the Mixer brought pain to my soul.
When baking, I have learned that you fold things in by using a rubber spatula and gently scoop it all together in a way where it will stay fluffy.
4:46 was that the ted-ed opening?
is Ian a stoner?
Ian, you use a spatula to fold something in.
We'll need some MILUK
Please don't cut nuts like that ever again. :( It's dangerous. The baking aisle at your local grocery store should have pre-chopped nuts in small bags for you to buy. Or you could do the bag technique, but use a rolling pin to roll over them to crush them.
your clock doesnt work did you know
"Fold it in" Proceeds to put it in the mixer.
Nice kitchen, you should try some gluten free recipes!!!!!
are those real plugs in his ears or?
i made choclate bark before with white and milk choclate and m and m
3:21 its cannon that all episodes of https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC18ju52OET36bdewLRHzPdQ (brutalmoose) takes place in a cartin of milk dimension, i need to visit it some time. and is being viewing buy a moose god making pie that is also booth inside and out side the milk cartin dimension 8:47 NOW WHO(you should check out Dr.who if you thought this was a good comment) WANTS TO FOLLOW ME TO VICTORY! TO ONE DIMENSION IN A RANDOM CARTIN OF MILK DIMENSION.
Just some tips: DISCLAIMER: I am not a chef, I just really like to cook 1. While mixing, if you scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spoon or a spatula, it will incorporate everything that is stuck to the sides. 2. Folding is a technique in which you incorporate something fluffy and aerated into your mixture, in your case the cool whip, without beating out all of the air. You simply put your mixing utensil, it can be a spoon, spatula, or even a whisk, into your bowl, and while holding it, rotate your bowl a bit, giving it a little mix, and then gently fold the mixture over itself. Repeat until it is evenly mixed. If the way I described it is a bit unconventional, I'm sorry. 3. The thinner you spread out your chocolate, the thinner the layer of chocolate in your bark will be, and try to get it as even as possible so that you don't get bites that are overwhelmingly chocolate (not that it's a bad thing, but you want to be able to taste the actual toppings as well) but you did your best given you only had a tiny baking sheet and tiny freezer. 4. Gluten-Free baked goods (breads, cookies etc.) are often made with rice flour, because it contains no gluten, which is the stuff that binds baked goods together, so they're not just crumbly pieces of cooked dough, and is also what makes bread chewy. Replacing the regular flour with rice flour, and also the subsequent absence of gluten is why your pretzels might've felt and tasted a bit off. A good replacement if you have celliac or any sort of gluten sensitivity, but if you can, just eat the normal pretzels.
but really who tf has the time to critique him on folding? just let him LIVE
New Brutalfoods episode: 11/10 Folding in ability: 1/10 I love your kitchen shenanigans, Ian, even when you make me cringe by taking the correct mixer attachment off and putting the wrong one on! Keep up the good work!

Welcome back to Texas Ian
here we have a review from Texasyumyum, titled "Don't let the devil consume your bum bum"
Welcome back to Texas, if you're even old enough to drink go for classic Texas Tea. Mix of 5 alcohols, citrus flavors, and a splash of coke. https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/classic-texas-tea-2273736 <3 It's fairly popular in the West Texas college towns I grew up in.
Are you ever going to continue tellevoid?
i like these types of videos and i think you should keep making them, but i would really like it if you brought back the gaming videos because i really liked them and miss them
Pudding pie is my favorite dessert for the hollidays
None of that is from HEB how is this texan
Aye whats the song at 13:32 during sprinkle time? I am desperately searching for it!
Today on brutal foods - I moved back in with my folks and used their kitchen to film
Ok, I'm italian, so excuse my curioisty and please understand my ignorance... in the U.S. you drink so much milk as it seems? for example in my country it's very very difficult to find someone who drinks milk during lunch or dinner. Most of the people, except children, drink milk only on brekfast (if they drink it at all).
how much did that thing cost you :D
TOFFEE?! JUST GET HEATH, HEATHEN.
Ian moved to Texas? time to just perpetually live at a kroger until i find him
When did this become a cooking channel?(Although as a cooking channel it is kinda like a actual cooking version of you suck at cooking.)
STOP USING YOUR FINGERS FOR STUFF
when using the mixer you should have a spatula to get the powder on the side of the bowl
I love the THICC portions
The new kitchen looks amazing and I'm sure there's lots of room for more craziness, but I miss the tiny kitchen and seeing all of it from one camera angle.
Damn dude. Is that what YouTube money gets you Kitchen Wise? (Spoiler Alert: I doubt it)
im in houston for christmas you should have a meet up id love to see you <3
don't be afraid to put full blast on the mixer
I swear my friends kitchen looks exactly like that.
you didnt fold it in... but the topping doesnt look so airy it needs to be folded in or anything so i wouldve done exactly what you did.
Has a sound person or anyone else commented yet about the ringing sound? at first I thought your voice was hitting something's resonant frequency but then you can hear it on its own at 24:31-24:40. Is it a fan in the background that gets noise-cancelled properly but only if everything stays quiet? That'll never do! I mean unless it comes out in post.
I’m Minnesotan and I often say y’all
30 men in your fridge wait what
I hope your parents watch your videos
Not one “darn tootin’” in the entire video. I’m disappointed, Ian.
Ian, I love your content but your lack of cooking/baking abilities made me frustrated. Still love these videos ????
Plops looks a bit thin... feed the damn thing, Cowboy Ian!
Puts more chocolate than the recipe asks for... Companions about that he can only taste the chocate.
Wtf I never even got to meet you while you were here in Seattle
Ian, you seem... shorter. It must be that Texas has stronger gravity. I suppose everything is bigger in Texas (except Ian).
...is this the old smosh house
These videos are some of the only videos that make me laugh super hard. The editing is the best I've ever seen it's hilarious!
Welcome back to Texas Ian, I missed you. I really wanted to Cowboy Bark to be something special! But that Texas Yum Yum looks mighty fine too. The crust still seems a bit small though...
So did he move in with his parents or is this his own place in Texas? Not judging, just curious.
the dang sound effects at the beginning tripped me up so bad that i genuinely was cringing at how much mud you must've been getting on that kitchen floor, i've never felt so stupid in my life. like...i knew there wasn't really a horse/bull/cow beneath you but my brain really played me
Wtf did you move AGAIN???
When a recipe tells you to fold something into something, evidently what you're doing is making the batter light and fluffy by incorporating air into the mix. Gluten is a substance present in cereal grains, especially wheat, that is responsible for the elastic texture of dough. A mixture of two proteins, it causes illness in people with celiac disease.
god I cant watch this fool cook things. hes just like egoraptor.
Okay I can't stand it....Ian...to fold an ingredient in you need to flip everything together starting from the bottom of the bowl. you need to do this manually. It pretty much is just stirring slightly differently, but its done to incorporate air into the mix - source my mom and all the years I've been cooking
I wonder if Austin is insulted by that introduction
Editing was top notch this video.
Can confirm
is this red dead 2?
Stick!!! The werthers!! In!! A food processor!!!! Asfkgll
Hits "crust" umm smells good
I don't know why but the AOL door opening sound with the open fridge had me in stitches.
So you're going to wear that every time you cook right?
Yum. Yum.
Fold in means take a spatula and then put the whipped topping into the mixture, slowly take the mixture and kinda flop it on top and repeat, kinda like folding sheets
1. Scrap the sides of the mixer with a spatula 2. Fold stuff in by gently "folding" the substance into itself
That hair!!!   <3   For recipe #2, put the peanuts in a bag and hit them with a hammer also
must not comment! i fix these several times a year they aint this hard to make. also place chocolate on baking tray then heat in oven save the spreading
I agree with you Brutalmoose, when you read out the ingredients for the Cowboy ?? Bark I was like “Ugh dark chocolate.” Lol great video as always!
This is easily the best channel on youtube the production value here is unbelievable
I always like how clueless Ian is in all his food videos
ive been going thru a rough time lately and this video really cheered me up... as always your editing is on point and seeing u just acting natural and fun is so refreshing, thank you so much for posting, youre amazing
My mum mentioned that the clock doesn't change from 1:50 the entire video and now I can't see anything but that.
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
It’s Incredibly Hard For me to Take Him Seriously With His Long Hair,Hat,&,Inflatable Bull Costume
It's only been a minute or two but I gotta say: I love your choice of font.
I was watching the food channel a few days ago and honestly, i really want to see Ian cover Cookie salad... because legit its the strangest thing I've ever seen. You serve it warm and its like a pudding? plus you eat it during the main course of the meal.
Your channel and editing reminds me of Cow Chop and Idubbz with some dashes of Eric andre
You should have used an ERGHHHHHHHHHHHH sized sheet.
I hate pudding and Jello. Didn't even like it as a kid. Come at me, losers.
"To yee, or not to yee..." "that is the haw"
If you have a food processor, it makes chopping (read chorping) easier. I'm pretty sure there's a pulse option, so that it doesn't just become a fine powder
As a Texan I can confirm we cook all of our meals while riding various animals through our kitchen
Who I feeding this poor boy? He doesn't understand any food
In the use of a Kitchen Aide mixer: 1). Scrape the sides of the bowl fairly regularly using a spatula ("Scooper Thing") that way it mixes evenly. 2). The whip, which you first started out using, was the right tool for softening cream cheese. You had the right idea to push the cheese out and mix again, but it's easier with a spatula. 3). You can go as fast as you want with a hard or semi-solid ingredient like cream cheese, but when mixing powder and liquid it's best to start on a low setting like 2 or 3 until it's mixed in, this prevents you from getting a face full of powder. 4). The beater (second head you attached) is the correct head to use for folding in ingredients. It's best used on a mid setting, don't put anything in while it's running. Folding in performance 6/10. 5) Always scrape your mixer heads with a spatula before removing them from the mixer. That way nothing goes to waste and you don't have stuff dripping everywhere while you move it to the sink. Doing great, keep it up!
When you're mixing with an electric mixer, pause it half way through and use a spoon to mix the outside parts that didn't get mixed, then resume the electric mixer.
The kitchen is too big Just like Texas
brutalfoods makes me want to be a master chef you should be the host of hell`s kitchen Ian
I want to see a cowboy Ian movie
When I first read it I thought it said Desert recipe reviews hahaha that's a bit culturally insensitive and geographically inaccurate.
My brain is going to explode from the editing.
lit subscribing because i love your use of chromakey. (also texas)
Looking Good, Cowboy ??
Ian's finds out about gulten free pretzels in the worst possible way
>Takes off beater >"Since it says to beat it, I guess I'll use this." >Puts on whisk Ian nooooooo
@ 10:49- Plop levels have reached an all-time high. Also, sounds like he's going to the bathroom :/. Otherwise, this is a fun video to watch! :D
for some reason i now what to see ian wear that get up at a cowboy action shooting contest
I don't understand what the "Folding" accomplished, just toss it in there and let it continue mixing.
Toffee bits are in the baking section next to the chocolate chips. They are the best!
Your reaction to the gluten free pretzels was great ??
I love your mom's kitchen
"I think I just add it in with it going slow?" I mean, no, that's not what folding in means, but also it'll work so who cares
Texas rocks! Brutalfoods rocks! I'm not from Texas but I know that state rocks. Thanks dude, please do some more "poppin cookin" and frozen dinner videos.
Best hair
This was dogshit.
I just wrote my exam and know I failed it even tho I put a lot of effort in it. This gave me joy
24:28 look to the right
OK ok oh my God ok you have to scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula YOURSELF the mixer can't do it for you.... And folding is using a rubber spatula to gently scoop under the batter or whatever it is and literally fold it over itself until mixed. Usually it keeps air in things of you need air in your batter and to gently incorporate things without fuckin up your shit.
not scraping the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula...REEEEEEEE
Ian confused in the grocery store would be a great video and also too relataable.
Penis
I just noticed it was a 30 minute video but that’s ok
"I love Werther`s" I see... 'click unsuscribe'
When you sniffed the crust I was ready for the Freddy fish 2 “oooooooh” voice clip
I love love when you put a video out I don't want you to me lie cuz your videos are like gourmet food you got to wait for the right time to eat it and the time is now Can you could read the phone book and I would watch it cuz your so damn entertaining is that series Televoid! Ever coming back? Keep up the good work every time I see one of your videos you make my day make me so happy and I feel so happy you can make my worst days feel like the brightest
I love the editing
I can hear dentists crying in the distance
Someone get this man a rubber spatula
I just moved to texas within the last few months too. Are you doing a fan meetup any time in the future?
I had subtitles on when the video began so when I saw [galloping] I immediately clicked like. lol
Pulling out the ingredients for the first recipe just gave me flashbacks to my friends who likes baking complaining to me that everytime she wants to bake something new and tries to google the recipe it comes up with a US recipe full of premade ingredients that you can't buy anywhere else. Haha.
23:16 communism
The editing is still top notch.
Why do you look photo shopped in your own kitchen lmao Guess its the lighting idk
I already loved you exploring food in these videos but your editing makes it even more fascinating and fun, never change ??
jokes aside that is actually proper knife technique
Not living on the coast really reduces housing costs.
You’d think it’s a Johnny Test episode with all the sound effects and whip cracks ??
Red dead redemption 2 looks sick
Ian you missed the opportunity to do a Halloween treats video!
To fold, first only fold by hand. To fold, use a rubber spatula and mix in batches using a slow figure 8 motion.
10 out of 10 as always mutalbroose
i could practically smell the chocolate...i gotta make me some of that yum yum
man, the new red dead redemption game sure does look strange.
The editing cracks me up so much
Yeah, I stealing Plops for Red Dead 2 horse name. Thanks, Ian!
folding in means exactly what it sais. You need to get some flat spatula, put your ingrendients together and then fold it, take a spatula, put it in the thing, take a spoonfull of thing and turn it upside down. fold it like you fold paper.
You added to much Chocolate to the bark
i dont like "chocolate pudding". I mean I like chocolate pudding but what you made is a CACAO pudding and its disgusting.
4:52 M-O-U-T-H-F-E-E-L IAN
WHAT THE FUCK WHY HAS IT BEEN 50 FUCKING YEARS SINCE YOUR LAST PC GAME REVIEW I AM RELLY PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW AND IF THE NEXT VIDEO ITS NOT A GAME REVIEW I AM UNSUBSCRIBING
Boy howdy, I wish I had 30 men in my freezer
Ian has anyone ever told u that u are some sort of half-horse half-human hybrid?
I wanna make a vid to show you how to be more efficient and use proper techniques, but your terribleness is so endearing and funny.
E
"that looks correct"
this is amazing
I lost it when the ghost came out and then got slapped
The cookie sheet size description killed me ???? where can I buy the Ian sized version
rip tiny grandpa
Ian next episode you should eAt A TrAY of tUbiFeX WORmS
Go vegan you lovely moose!! Ps our hair is almost the same length
Run the mixer faster and it'll fling the cream cheese out as it goes, the paddle will struggle with the topping and sugar. I feel like the yum yum was enough for two pies. I'm a shitty "from the can spray stuff" whipped cream guy. I hate the frozen stuff. You needed a half sheet pan. That was a quarter sheet. When you use parchment paper, lay it down with the curled side down so it stays put, if your need extra stickiness, a quick Spray of nonstick between the pan and paper does the trick. Get a meat mallet for bag pounding. Also you can mince garlic by peeling the garlic, putting it under plastic wrap on a cutting board and hit it with the meat mallet. Lets you move a bunch of garlic super fast
Most cooking videos you watch somebody who knows how to cook trying to teach the unlearned masses. Brutalmoose shows us someone learning how to cook. Also I love I got a Red Dead Redemption ad while Ian was grinning manically as he smashed Wether Originals.
This channel has gone through such a ridiculous change and I've loved every bit of it.
Your horse is so we’ll be haved :)
This intro is probably the best thing I've ever seen.
"Its not quite as good as the picture, but this is my first time" That could go many ways
Pretty accurate to an actual Texan
this editing is SO GOOD
dude i love the edits you do for all your hand gestures, they always crack me up
I'd kill for one of those Kitchen Aid mixers...but I'd need both money and counter space...
First time seeing cream cheese?
Cream cheese is an abomination almost as bad as mayonnaise. Were it not for that, I would TOTALLY be into the Texas Yum Yum. *fist shake* GOD DAMN YOU CREAM CHEESE FOR RUINING YUMMY DESSERTS!!!!! DX (Also that is the EXACT OPPOSITE of "folding in" when it comes to baking.)
That hair is gettin longer than a horse in the middle of winter (no idea what that actually means)
How do I subscribe twice
It would be nice if TexasMoose would appear as a minor reoccurring character from time to time
add cream to the chocolate next time, it makes it less brittle. and you fucked up on the folding again. Use a rubber spatula and just fold it in by hand. Self explanatory
as a texan, i fucking love this video.
w h a t i n t a r n a t i o n
You should do some Halloween themed foods!
Sad I never ran into Ian in Seattle
Oh, Ians into some freaky shit, huh?
You didn't fold....but I applaude the effort
Aww man! Ian, you're so dedicated! You moved back to Texas just to make this video in time for Red Dead Redemption 2! Hope Rockstar rewards you good for this! ??
4:52 talk about a tasty lick Ian knows how to eat mmm~ ( ?° ?? ?°)
wow ian, this Read Dead Redemption 2 Review is great!
Top shelf editing, nicely done and excellent work on making this fantastic video, also all the foods in the video look mighty tasty <3
I turned on notifications and got nothing thanks YouTube now I ate my burger like a normal person.
Wow, red dead redemption 2 looks great 0:24
15:00 I want a Werther's
Ian keeps moving into places with bigger kitchens. It's going to become such a big problem that eventually, his whole house will just be the kitchen
yum yum
I don't blame you moving from WA especially seattle. Rent is outrageous.
As someone who has been around those kitchen aid mixers her whole life (my mom makes cakes at home), i sorta...hurt...watching you struggle with it, but I was laughing like crazy so it was okay. (Also when stuff sticks to the side, use a spatula to scrape it off and fold it in while the machine is turned off)
I loved this. Good video :-D
all videos from now on need an ian wipe
so, is this the halloween video?
Other Ian at 24:32 makes me nervous
You have to fold in the cheese, David. Fold. In. The. Cheese. David
Dude, you need a slap chop!
I was honestly concerned you were going to put your finger in the mixer while it was running
The Texas Secret: Hammers and Holes
you need a rubber spatula for melted chocolate ian, its too sticky for anything else
Love the kitchen, but There is a lot of reverb. I wonder if there's anything you could do for it. It's not that bad, but it's really easy to notice.
I'm actually in love with all these videos you do, and they always make my day so much brighter. Thank you so much for your beautiful editing skills and your humor and your wonderful skills in the kitchen, and keep up the amazing work!
Why do you look so much like Sohinki from Smosh Games?!?
If you’ve never had it and you’re from Texas, it’s probably not a “Texas treat”. Not to mention it should also include incest since it’s Texas.
It's nearly midnight and I want to run to the store and grab the ingredients for Texas Yum Yum why must you do this to me Ian
Fantastic video, but I think you coulda slapped Plops a little less, he was trying the best he could.
The lighting and kitchen looks so gorgeous that I thought the whole thing was a green screen XD
What i got from this video: The south will rise again.
You're editing has given me a second life thank you. Great video.
proud to be a texan with ian
Should have just mixed the cream cheese in a bowl with a wooden spoon
Your sound effects and editing is so extra I love it! That level of detail is top notch.
Ian just got back from Ram Ranch
Do this for every states and their stereotypes please!
19:15 made me cry, I love your videos so much! can't wait for the next one!
For future reference, you can use a spatula (that scooper thingy) to scrape down the sides while it's mixing, just don't like, stick it into the blades.
I swear you house is the same exact design as my friends house
Sometimes I wonder how human males even survive....I guess that's why so many of them are desperate to have a girlfriend/wife
yeehaw? More like yeenaw ?????
Kitchen looks good Ian
PLOP
Red Dead looks so good
Your audience demands a glutten free review episode
Take 5 bars are fantastic.
watching this with closed captions on is pretty great [Chill, boppy music as Ian desperately struggles]
I love this video so much! I laughed a lot. I enjoy your editing style. It really made my day better.
One of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time. Keep it up Ian!
you should have used Werther's Soft Caramels instead.
Does this video ever fucking end? I feel like ive been watching Ian slap his horse for hours now.
Ian! Why'd you change your icon? I loved that weary moose.
Looks like this guy has way too much fun editing ????
puts in extra dark chocolate there's too much dark chocolate
i fucking love these cooking videos
i love this channel so much
I am 100 percent Texan but I hate ALL of America. Especially bull riding cowboys! Lol jk.
Ian I love how you don't know what you're doing but you cook anyway. It's great for people who don't know how to cook to see that, because anyone can cook, you just need to be like you and just try it, even if it doesn't end up perfect the first time
Dude the PC release of RDR2 looks so damn good. Likely going to buy!
Holy crap! Your kitchen layout is the same as my dad's! Now I have the same attachment to this video as you do to Texas Yum-Yum!
Pause at 2:01 Howdy, they call him Texas Ian. He is anything you need, And I mean anything. Even love...
Welcome back to Texas!
I can no longer discern reality from cream cheese.
Did anybody else scream when he rode in on the bull ???????????? I can’t with those freakin slap noises
Southern / Midwestern potluck food is not remotely good for you but it does tend to be incredibly tasty. If overly sweet.
Loved the use of the green screen at the beginning, Cowboy Ian. Kudos!
Thank you for sprinkles
I hadnt watched this channel in a while and i came back and saw this and holy shit i couldnt stop laughing these are actually hilarious great job man.
This is the craziest review of Red Dead 2 yet
Ian I love you and I've been watching for a long time but I see some of these videos and question if you've ever eaten food before.
We really don't deserve Ian but I'm glad he's with us in this ol cowboy place called Earth.
You know it’s going to be good if he has that great value!
Folding is what it sounds like. You take a rubber spatula, and fold the mix over whatever you're trying to fold in.
...was that a cherry mondo lmao
Plop
The funny thing is that there’s really only Latinos/Latinas where I live in Texas (Fort Bliss)
"Texas yum yum" is called "sex in a pan" where I'm from
Been playing a lot of Red Dead 2, I see.
whos kitchen is that
Texan here and WTF is Texas yum yum??? Loved my whole life here and haven't heard of Texas Yum Yum lmao
The editing is perfection! ??
The peanuts, and other brittle ingredients can be put in a ziplock sandwich bag and hit with a rolling pin
Brutalmoose! that is a bull not a horse! I do not think you can ride a bull like that around lol (I could be wrong thought lol )
Heath bars are toffee, they have em at checkout. Most grocery stores have toffee bits in the baking section next to the chocolate chips. Werthers are hard candies, not toffee. They will not eat the same
this made my day, even if I am a day late.
nice kitchen
I'm definitely going to try the Texas Yum Yum.
I'm subbed and bel rung, but I can't find this is my sub box.
WHY THE FUCK DO I SEE ANYTHING BUT THE ALMIGHTY HEB BRAND PRODUCTS!!!
PLOP
12:01 Every year, millions of plops gets abused each day by their owners, you can help stop it today
P l o p
You are a master of dry humor!!
WHY DO YOU FREEZE THE WHIPPED CREAM!? YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE!
I really love the idea of Brutal Foods, Ian keep it up man, you're awesome!
Thank you, Ian.
Probably wouldn't hurt to invest in a potato masher.
19:09
THATS NO CUP! THATS ONE OF THEM FANCY SPOONS MY WIFE GOT
This is seriously the best editing I've ever seen.
i can't believe you stayed in costume
Folding in ingredients you make a cavity in the center of the bowl of other ingredients, put the ingredient you need to fold in in the center, then scrape the edges into the center and mix it from there
I loved watching “Touch the Food: The Episode” and especially loved that “Full Strength Strongman” Metal song cameo!
I love the lighting in the new room
yo take 5 is bae
You are the best YouTuber.
We Washingtonians lost an awesome fucking moose. We'll miss you buddy, but we won't miss a video!
i fucking swear, my grandparents have almost the exact same kitchen/(at least from what i saw) house layout
make a video on the glutino pretzels
Do another video on lego land 6
I want Binging with Babish to collab with Ian
welcome back to texas, you da best!
Where is the next sex game review
what's the number cause I'm pretty sure this is now the third kitchen
your videos are an art form
Hee yaw
I hope he went to HEB for all these ingredients :)
I'm disappointed you used Great Value instead of Hill Country Fair. 0/5; not Texan enough.
Ian not knowing how to use a mixer is gay culture.
"did I correctly fold it in this time?" No. Folding is done by hand. It's literally an action where you fold one ingredient over the top of the other.
Plop
You mean african american chocolate? Gosh Ian be more sensitive heccin Texan (Lmao love these vids alot!)
The day everything goes right in a BrutalFoods video is the day I unsubscribe.
Remember when this channel made video game reviews and had a rivalry with Caddicurus
I really love your sense of humor and editing style! (also "plops is displeased with your offering" should be a new reaction image)
The farting ziploc bag made me laugh so hard I had to pause, this is peak editing.
18:24 Okay tutorial heads!
The brutal foods kitchen reminds me of one of my classmates kitchens from elementary school in Texas lol
Ian buddy I love your egg tea towel! It's freakin adorbz
I might actually enjoy cooking if I had someone fun like you to cook with, haha. I hope Texas is treating you well so far! Nice digs!
As a Texan, I didn't know that's called a Yum Yum..? I make pudding pies every thanksgiving. Though I add a bit of cool whip to the pudding. Always a hit ?? /obligatory YEEHAW!
1:37 sign: stoop
My culture isn’t your DESERT dweeb Texan gamers rise
Could have named this video Brutalmoose do Texas
Did you eat my snack pack??
21:31 WHY MUST YOU REMIND ME OF MY TORMENT!
This video didn't show up in my subscription box.
WELCOME BACK IAN!!!! BOIIII HOWDY!
@brutalmoose you can hit the 2 on the microwave for an automatic 2 minutes brah
Ian do you have a no Google policy so many questions could be answered by that but I suppose it would be less entertaining so keep up your confused bumbling
I could watch you poorly cook kindergarten level food all day Ian.
Can you please do a whole video on "those things"?
Every time, I think to myself, how can watching someone cook for half an hour possibly be entertaining? Every time, I am wrong.
No, Ian. You did not fold it in correctly. You get an A for effort though. I love you ??
As a Texan I highly enjoyed this video ?? I said to myself" Hey, that looks like a Texas kitchen!" and then you said you had moved back to Texas XD
This was half an hour?! It felt like 10 minutes!
what's the episode where he talks about bugs bunny! and what was up?
I want the recipe for that pie. Though I also wonder if theres a sugar free version? I want to make one for my brother but hes diabetic ;-;
thank you for another great vid, please stop using great value. of you use normal quality ingredients you food will taste better
Oh man this video killed me ?? love ya Ian!
It's strange that Ian, as far as I know, lives alone but buys a whole gallon of milk.
Who’s you’re editor I love all of the dumb transitions and sound effects
Also, are you drinking from a Kool-Aid Bottle?
I would probably freeze the Texas Yum Yum solid as a i don't like the texture of any kind of pudding (SORRY IAN it feels like mayo in my mouth :/). I actually want to try the stuff in this video; it all looks very tasty! Specially the Bark stuff. That has a lot of potential for customization (remove the peanuts and oreos and add caramel popcorn UGH YES).
ian !! i am also a dallas gal who moved to washington but recently moved back! maybe i'll see you and plops around sometime
You were up here in Washington and didn’t even make me a treat? Not cool man
10:13 No. No you did not. Lol Probably wasn’t a big deal for this particular recipe, though. It’s super important if you make something with egg whites, though.
This opening is amazing and your house also looks amazing!
how much texas yum yum you want uh 3? so texas yum yum yum yum yum yum
Glad to see you’re all moved in!
Man, I'd never heard of Texas Yum Yum before, but now I need to eat it!
Did you actually move to Texas? A lot of the newer houses look like that and you passed a lot of places meet where I live, ps I’m also Texan. FortWorth, Dallas, and I’m thinking maybe Denton? Idk, I’m just but a humble and simple Texan child with a beard and fingers as soft as babies but cheeks...
3:55 the look of pure disgust
My gran used to make Texas Yum Yum every christmas, it's AWESOME. It was just called puddin' pie, though. Oh, small town Texas...
I live in Texas and it’s just like Red Dead Redemption 2
Future tip: When using the mixer, use centrifugal force to get the goopy shit out (cream cheese, butter, etc.) by turning it to 10 and letting everything fall off in the bowl. (Also, I've been baking for years and can't fold shit to save my life)
Watching these videos is always a pleasure, Ian. Your editing is honestly the best. Period
man you really do love your whipped topping
I missed this yesterday and I felt bad. Need my fixin' of some BrutalFoods.
Are you salty that the 2nd recipe isn't salty enough?
As usual: dat editing tho
can you do another yugioh video?
0/10 folding
kitchen is only a little bigger than the last one
20:42 that was actually a pretty cool transition
im texan this is offensive
I give your folding a 0/10. You did it completely wrong.
ur supposed to scrape the sides every so often with an electric mixer :(
Never made pudding I just eat the snack packs
You're an idiot
Plops...the best thing I’ve seen all week! Also, if you want your pudding to thicken, try cornstarch!
"Brutalfoods - I'm just doing mah best." - Make that T-Shirt. Do it
For future reference: use the side of the hammer instead of the head. You’re less likely to break the bag. You could also use a rolling pin or a wooden mallet so you don’t break the bag
IAN you mus SIFT your CONFECTIONERS SUGAR before MEASURING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Glad to see I'm not the only one who's confused by kitchen appliances
As a fellow Texan, I approve.
Can you make a Halloween Special for BrutalFoods?
So...I think as a Houstonian I am required to say... Fuck Dallas.
Thats a damnnice kitchen, by tarnation.
You literally look like you're standing... That's the worst costume... The illusion is lost....
Have you ever cooked before.
Go to the candy aisle and look for toffee bars
i had some leftover french silk pie in the fridge so as u can imagine, ive eaten it all while watching this
I have an identical shirt
DOTCH GULCH
sub to brutalmoose for his game reviews years ago. stay for cooking show.
Ian: I don’t want to cut myself! Also Ian: cuts open the chocolate in the most unsafe way possible
Red Dead Redemption II looks so realistic
NOOOOOO I LOVED THE OLD BRUTAL FOODS KITCHEN r.i.p will never forget
That’s a bull not a horse. I don’t understand.
I want Ian to wear Plorps in a future episode as he taste tests a bunch of steaks.
Best cooking show on youtube
As someone coming from the country that invented cake. America. Why.
This was so entertaining.
I love the feeling when you see a random stock photo on a Brutalfoods and are just waiting to see what will happen to it.
I cant eat pudding anymore being lactose
Smolmonds©
Damn, new kicthen again? Where are you gettin' this money?
That molten chocolate... Looks so good and tasty Damn Ian, now i need this in my life
Ian's new legs are as soulless as Plop's eyes
0:09 UGH Wish that was me
With things like peanuts or other kinds of nuts it helps to put them in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to break them apart
WHAT THE HECK A BIG KITCHEN? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
That Yum Yum looks great. I might try it out myself but use strawberry instead of chocolate pudding cause i dont like chocolate pudding XD great video as always!!! Glad to know the move is done. Kitchen looks great
Bruh you need a flat kitchen hammer, and need to hammer up all of em ingredients yall
This should be on tv
pro tip Ian! if you don't know where to find certain toppings for deserts, you can go to an ice cream or yogurt shop and just buy the toppings off them! (ie: toffee bits)
Pajama sam thank you very much
This is DEFINITELY the right way to announce a move to your viewers.
god i love these
you need puddin just ask team four star
A horse is a steed. A bull is a steer.
notice me senpie
Could have Crushed the Pretzels, Oreos, and Wurthers all together and just mixed and applied to chocolate.
i heard microwaving chocolate is bad. it burns away the sweetness. i would have put that plastic bowl in a pot of boiling water.
Oh precious Ian, how sweet you are - how bad at "folding in ingredients" you are. This actually wasn't terrible, but to truly fold in an ingredient, you'll want to use a rubber spatula to very slowly and gently mix the ingredient in a bowl, scraping up from the bottom of the bowl as you go. Essentially, "folding" is a technique used specifically with light, airy ingredients that you don't want to knock the air out of. So basically it's just mixing as gently as possible, to keep the mixture light and airy! While using a stand mixer wasn't the best idea for this, putting it on the slowest setting was the best option for your chosen technique. <3
Red Dead Redemption 3 Reveal Trailer
Howdy. When folding in dry or liquid ingredients into the other, use a rubber spatula & make figure 8s (like a ballerina in a rodeo). The purpose is to incorporate air into the mix, which adds volume (like in yer mama's perm). Whisking will just beat the air out of it (like beatin' the devil out the sinners).
why did I laugh when you said snack packs
Plops is displeased with your offering!!
Can we make it a new rule that it isn’t a true Brutalfoods video without at least one “plop”?
Farewell, Original Brutal Kitchen. You shall be missed dearly by newcomers and veterans alike.
He should do an Instant Ramen brutalfoods, good video btw.
18:22 is that manly muscles?
IAN JUST GOOGLE HOW TO FOLD STUFF IN BC ITS NOT THE SAME AS MIXING AND YOURE LOSING ANY AIR THAT IT HAD
Mother kept yelling about you using a mixer instead of a hand mixer. Apparently the first accessory you put on it was actually the right one.
Those sound effects from Bop It were an ingenious addition. I don't know how you notice those sorts of opportunities!
That close up of Ian taking a gulp of mailk fucking killed me
"it's very hard" Whaaat, frozen chocolate is hard?!

Eating the two sugariest desserts ive seen in all my life, hes also drinking koolaid. Ian, are you diabetic?
Why is this a food channel now, i do not get it?
I sighed when he came in on the bull
So I thought I would just give you some tips and tricks for using a stand mixer. First of all you were using the right attachment to mix the cream cheese you just need to turn it on a lot higher. Usually around the 6th or 7th setting is where I put it and what you're attempting to do is just beat air into the cream cheese making it "lighter". And it's sticking to the side of the bowl is no problem you just scrape down the bowl. The attachment you put on is for folding in ingredients and mixing them ever so slightly. It's for stuff you don't want to build a lot of gluten in like a crepe. The other attachment is the dough hook and that's for kneading dough so you can bake bread. You're doing a really good job by the way as well. They are a difficult unit to understand sometimes and you seem to grasp the concept pretty quickly. Other than the fact of not plugging it in but I do that all the time so no judgment there.
Real cowboys don’t ride horses, they ride C O W S
I feel like I got called out when he said Ramsay(my last name)
You are SO bad at cooking hahaha.
That "cheesecake" has got to be the most unhealthy dessert I've ever seen lol. The amount of sugar that must be in that! Just looking at it is giving me diabetes.
You living in Texas honestly makes me enjoy living out here a lot more even though we will most likely never actually meet.
Did you enlarge your head? I dunno why but your face looks too big for your body...
And I quote, "I'm going to add more chocolate which can't be that bad just more chocolate" I added too much chocolate ??
You made a Werther's dust shaker... That's kinda amazing.
I just got a Toyota ad in spanish on this video, I have adblock on.
Can you play and find the game kid pix 3D on your channel plz
It appeared to me that youns and ole plop were swimmin' down the river walk in San Antonio if I'm not mistaken. Welcome home cowboy!
Ian! Couple tips for your mixer * the highest setting is for beating stuff - it also helps when something thick like cream cheese is stuck on the inside of the whisk * ALWAYS lock the top down, the last think you want is it opening up
Don't worry Ian. in a few months you'll be Ain'tin and Y'allin like you never left.
He started and stopped cooking all of that at 2:51 in the [MORNING/AFTERNOON]. That's why they likely call him Quickdraw Ian.

Take 5 is the greatest candy bar of all times
The sound effects are great??
Don’t Fuck With Texas
When using a stand mixer, you need to scrape down the bowl with a spatula to properly mix everything.
Dang it, Youtube! Why do you always give me alerts when Youtubers I'm not subscribed to upload, if you're not even alerting me when great Youtubers like Brutalmoose upload!
I like this video so far but I think you need to reposition the camera a bit. We can't see much on the main camera.
Wait I have real pretzels....Best quote ever
The first recipe is just "sex in a pan" under a different name
Don't think I didn't catch the Myst joke you sly moose ;)
this vid wuz very funny u never disappoint me and I'm excited 4 the next vid
Ian. Listen to me. Buy a coffee grinder. Nuts, oreos, pretzels and chocolate chips. Anything small can be processed in the grinder. You will now thank me for this life-changing pro tip.
I would watch this on Food Network.
I was wondering why you weren't using the Kitchen-aid stand mixer you had on the back counter. It was amusing watching you try and use it. It's something I use on almost a daily basis so to see someone struggle with it is entertaining.
Being someone who's actually from Tx, this is painful.
Everything is perfection as always, Ian. Really enjoyed all of the editing bits, and of course your humor, as always. :) You're seriously one of the best people on this site-I can't get enough of your videos! Hopefully the move went okay and that you're enjoying Texas again. :) Best wishes! Thanks for all the hard work, as always.
I see we have gone full circle with the long hair -> short hair -> long hair thing
Let Little Ian host the show
19:23
October's rolled around, you know what that means... It's Texas Mocking time.
Next time you try to knife a legume, consider a meat tenderizer or a generic kitchen mallet.
You should leave both cream cheese and whipped cream out for a bit to soften before using it next time.
Fuck this I want to watch a man cook microwave dinners in the tiniest space possible dammit! I can't relate to this at all! Love you Ian <3
Has anyone told him that's not a horse?
So weird seeing stock footage of my city on a YT video!
I love watching Ian develop as a cook
You left Seattle?! Sad. I remember when I ran into you at the Fry's in Renton. Good times.
Not even 10 seconds into the video and I'm already laughing. Was not expecting this outfit, my mistake.

CHOCOLATE RAIN
Welcome back to Texas
Ian has the funniest editting in all youtube! Love your work, man!
Fantastic video Ian! Your editing is both totally original and utterly entertaining.
Waiting for the day Ian gets on the tending list
Hell yes I've been waiting for this
0:03 Me walking into school after playing red dead redemption all weekend.
Thank you for your content as always, Ian!
Word of advice: read the entire recipe through before beginning with the first step, so you don't get surprised part way through. It may even help to rewrite the recipe, to divide up those multi-steps. Also, for chopped nuts, or for crushed grahams or cookies, put the measured amount into a heavy duty plastic bag. Use a meat tenderizer hammer to gently pound them into pieces.
Why was step two beat your wife? Thats weird what website did you get your recipe from?
Rides a bull, adds a horse noise for it... I don't know if it was intentionnal, but it was funny.
Ian do you edit your videos yourself? if so you do a great job on it
U forgot to put the pudding in the microwave and add the colour changing sparkles
One of the only brutal foods I would actually eat lol. Just so you know that "electric mixer" you used is actually generally called a "stand mixer" in recipes and an electric mixer is a hand-held device with two whisks sticking out of a motor to make them spin. I think they work the same though chefs might be mad about that, the only difference is you have to scrape down the sides of a stand mixer so that confectioner sugar would have mixed in better.

This guy reminds me of sheldon from big bang no idea why
I'm sick of the 15 second ads everywhere man
Thank God someone else recognizes the greatness of Take 5
Ian you did have pudding remember... ....the kid cuisine warm pudding
no real texan would use gluten free pretzels!!!! save those fer the liberals!!!!!
Those fucking Bob-It sound effects! Too funny Man too funny.
I love brutalfoods but I hate Texas. Goddamn cowbos always trying to eat my beans.
Still not folding right lol
God, oreos on top of chocolate, pretzels, crushed toffees and nuts? Whoever came up with that recipe didn't know when to stop. And I would have been pretty sparing with the salt anyway.
I love the way you edit man
No see the pudding tastes amazing because the last pudding you had was that warm Kid Cuisine magic shit.
you just recently oved into the condo in Seattle and now Tx .??????
Given I help my mother bake, I found myself going "Scrape the sides! what are you doing!?!" a lot during this video. And I literally said "No, no NO!!! that's not what folding is!". Overall very entertaining video.
why'd ya move home?
Cool cool
With her very first paycheck, my mother went to the store and bought an entire tub of 'whipped topping' and ate it in her car. She can no longer eat, or even smell, 'whipped topping.'
Moosey where do u shop. Try walmart next time.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!
Did Ian unhook his clock just so we wouldn't be able to tell how long it took to make these? It's 2:10 the entire time. Haha.
Definitely do an episode on all sorts of gluten-free foods. That would be kind of amazing.
I never thought I'd see Werther's Orignals on this channel. Hmm, not had any for ages. Maybe I should pick some up...
Typically when 'folding' something into mixture one of the techniques use is to take a spatula and make 90 degree turns with it in the bowl. Its done like this os stuff that has air in it like whipped creams or toppings dont lose the air in them during the mixing process. So think almost wrapping the two mixes around each other until they are one rather then just stirring them together.
p l o p
I can’t see I’ve seen folding done in an electric mixer, usually it’s literally entry folding with a silicone spatula. Also, room temperature is super important for incorporating things, especially for ingredients that are supposed to be lighten and airy like whipped cream. Your doing great though! I love watching the process
Is it just me or does Ian move a lot?
As an ex-Wallyworld dairy/frozen stocker, all of this Great Value stuff made me scream in shear horror. Truly an October fright.
Well, shit, welcome back to texas. Winter's here, so that's a thing. Have fun!
Yet another kitchen? You move a lot man, but them all upgrades tho.
If you ever need toffee bits again, you can break up a Heath bar and use that. My grandma has a awesome recipe for Toffee Bit Triangles that uses Heath bars.
That's one way of starting a video.
Plop
The editing in these videos never ceases to make me laugh.
Your editing is so good dude, and in an unsaturated environment like this it makes the content super intriguing.
23:47 30 men in the freezer :o Oh no
This is your magnum opus.
Welcome home dude.
You're using a Kitchen Aid for that? That's overkill lol
We don’t deserve Ian
All Ian has in the freezer is Otter Pops.
20:42 my favorite part!
21:43 Gluten free Brutal Food video confirmed?
Man Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great! You convinced me to buy it
also, as someone who has hammered down dog food for our hissing cockroaches at work, here are a couple of tips: - put the ziploc bag in another ziploc bag - make sure to get as much air out as possible the plastic bag will still rip and tear, but getting the air out first will make it rip less, and having the other bag will make it less of a mess. :-)
When mixing with an electric mixer, you have to use a spatula to push in the batter stuck to the sides of the bowel.
I love the audio editing, just makes every second enjoyable
0:37 i’m pretty sure that’s downtown where i live lmao
I can finally understand what in the tarnation this feller is sayin now that he's speakin proper-like. Welcome back ta Texas!
ahhh the kitchen is sooo big now he has even more room to cook??
Hits like before even watching the whole thing
glad you're back Ian
When you mix in a mixer you are supposed to scrape the sides off every now and again, it helps everything mix :)
Heck yessss! I’ve been obsessed over the older Brutal Foods vids recently, and I’m STOKED to have some new Ian brain candy. Nicely done.
what about the peanut on a food prosesor?
You are my favorite food reviewer.
How Ian makes it seem like too many cooks with one person is beyond me...
plop
I would love to see you review gluten free things. Also I do think the salt would have helped a lot with the bark, it helps to take away from the bitterness of the dark chocolate. Lastly, if ever you make bark again, try tapping the pan after putting the chocolate in while it's still hot, this will even out the ratio of the chocolate and kind of smooth it out.
For future reference, Heath candy bars are 99% toffee.
Chocolate raaaaain
This moment when you see all brutalfoods and that not even twice xD
We want to see more brutalfood :3 please :D
Fingerlickin' good.
This video was pretty yum yum
I need to try that Texas yum yum recipe! In the UK we don't have the Jello puddings so I may have to try it with Angel Delight which is a sort of pudding mix XD
With electric mixers like that, you're supposed to scrape the sides while it's working. And folding is something you do manually. You take your silicon spatula and slowly flip the product into itself, gently. It is quite literally folding.
Ian's steed looks suspiciously like a bull.... What type of bull are you pulling pretending plops is a horse?
This is the best western of our generation.
Please play West of Loathing, Ian! It’s so good, and so western!
Your parents have a very nice kitchen.
0:40 Katamari DamacIAN!
Next time you need stuff like toffee bits, try the baking aisle instead of the candy aisle :)
I'm pretty positive you're supposed to use a rolling pin, not a hammer
Brutalfoods is one of, if not, my favorite YouTube shows, keep it up Ian
you know kinda miss the the old game reviews but this is worth the trade
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP4vbktd-PM The furst 38 seconds explains and shows what folding something in is
I watch brutalmoose for the plot
Hey Ian, is Televoid coming back?
THIS INTRO IS RACIST!
you should probably invest in a portable electric mixer
omg. gordon ramsey is spinning in his grave.
Ian is certainly doing a great job of integrating back into that weird Texan culture ;)
Best ending ever.
Any day Ian uploads is a good day
So happy you're back! ^-^
Someone send this to Gordon Ramsey so he can learn some tips
You should get the Fallout: Vault Dweller Official Cookbook and make some things in there. Nuka Cola is a must since it's a staple in the game series
I'm so happy you finally get to eat nice yummy cold pudding and not the gross warmed up crap from the TV dinners!
A good way to fold something in is to take a rubber spatula and make a figure 8 with your mix. The idea is to keep it fluffy and full of air.
Dude your humor is great always makes me laugh keep that stuff up
Toffee bits= hard caramel What the fuck, HEATH bars mang.
the best treats for the best state
As a Texan I can confirm that them suckers look tasty.
I really shouldn't be watching Ian's videos when I'm doing something that'll get ruined if I laugh.
when you're taking out the mixer hand at 10:42 and you say "push it" and "twist it"..... are those the fucking sound effects from a Bop-it
ian, if you want to chop something like peanuts without risking your fingers, you can place your free hand over the far end of the blade where nothing is hanging near the edge, and then just rock it from that point back and forth over what you're chopping? it's hard to explain but basically your passive hand holds the far end of the knife down while your dominant hand rocks the blade up and down, and turns it left and right slightly to chop along what you're working on :D
You love the salt, eh? Sounds like someone ought to play them some fightan grames. :3
the fun thing about you being in texas is that could mean i live 20 minute away from you or 5 hours and that's beautiful. also i wanna make you pollo a la plancha sometime my dude! cook for a rad guy.
he used the wrong mixer head! it' s for dough!!
This is my favourite gaming channel
I just wanna thank you for the editing I know it can't be easy but it always brings me joy seeing your silly edits on your videos and I don't know if you really get how much we appreciate it and how much we appreciate you Ian, we love you and hope you have a fang-tastic Halloween ????????
PS: The bit where you were unwrapping the Werther's at maximum speed while maintaining your narration bit at normal, just cemented you as the best video editor who ever lived.
Me: Why do people scream at the tv at sports games? They can't hear you... Also me: OMG DON'T USE THE WHISK ATTACHMENT! NOOO! YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE DOWN THE SIDES AS YOU GO!!
So happy your move went well. When it comes to folding, i always take a little bit and use a wooden spoon to mix in the ingredients. So happy you are back. Cant wait for some more Brutalfoods.
As a Texas, I approve of this video.
Who would've thought sweet Ian was a cowboy all along.
With every episode I’m more and more convinced that Ian doesn’t live in our reality. Every store he goes to has no normal ingredients, he’s unfamiliar with some really basic foods and cooking techniques, he has nothing in his fridge but freezies.
Ian pls scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula when using any mixer. Certified chef (me) says ur folding technique was not really "folding" but for whipped topping it was ok. Folding means to gently mix with a rubber spatula, usually scraping from under then "folding" over the top. For this, your method worked fine, but for something more delicate than whipped topping (like real whipped cream for example) actual folding should be used.
Best editing in the west.
The Jebediah Ramsay cooking show
i dont like chocolate pudding. i dont like chocolate milk or hot chocolate either.
Ten seconds into the video and I was like "wow. The new Red Dead Redemption looks great"
If you’re melting chocolate use the double boiler method, put a pot with water on the stove then clip on a second thing, kinda like a deep frier but with water and put the chocolate in the smaller bowl inside the big bowl
love that plop sound
RIP old Brutalfoods kitchen [*]
B-oooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwl
My husband and I always watch your videos together and I think we wants me to make both of these things now haha.
Gluten free pretzels are exactly the same, the only difference is that they don't get all grossly gummy as you chew them :p
why did i wheeze when you gave plops the texas yum yum
Dude, I've had a phenomenally shitty day and this really helped cheer me up- thanks
the editing is just - :-*
"Are gluten free pretzels different?" How has this man made it more than 20 years on this earth.
This channel made the terrifyingly seamless transition into a food channel and I both love and am intimidated by the fact
Ian you've never had pudding pie before? That's all my family made during holidays
You are the only other person I've ever heard use the word "Larapin" aside from my Step-Mom.
I’m sure some other people have mentioned this, but to keep parchment paper on your tray, put butter on the try to help keep the paper stuck to the tray! Best of luck, Ian!
What an enjoyable fever dream this is
The bark probably needed to be spread thinner so it wasn't quite as chocolate heavy.
17:24 Improvising with those Wethers really shows how you've made GIANT STEPS in your cooking ability.
Should've used Heath bars for a toffee substitute. Since it's just toffee with chocolate on it.
How long we growing this hair Ian?
I can't even hate the intro
Your new kitchen is really beautiful.
The legend himself is back
so are we not gonna talk about the 30 men in my freezer part?
1:50, it will always be 1:50...
Yeah, the gluten free stuff is just terrible, also anyone saying it's 'unhealthy' the only reason they sell it is because of Gluten Allergies. It's like going peanut free because its harmful to some people, that's the logic behind that food fad basically. Just be careful, these item usually cost more for little reason.
MORE PLEASE
That's... definitely not what folding looks like.
I loved this video it was great..Hope to see a thanksgiving and or christmas themed cooking video
Mmmmm, them's suckers tasty
Oh man, that bark would've been so much better with tempered chocolate!
Weeerters
yee (and i can not stress this enough) haw
Texas foods. But no HEB groceries! I've been let down .
'I'm just doing my best' Well your best wasn't good enough, dude. You fail at cooking.
can someone please tell me the song title???
Neat thanks for the Type 2.
Why don't you just Google what you don't know how to do? I mean to be fair it would be a more boring video that way but ya know
[0/11] " NO BLUE BELL !!"
Your kitchens continue to increase in size
I enjoy american desserts which are just other desserts and snacks stacked on top of each other.
Who needs Red Dead Redemption when you have this?
I love your editing!
Chef Ian, can you try to make a raindrop cake? You’ll probably fail, but it’s really fun to watch people attempt it. And I believe in your ability to produce a good failure of a raindrop cake.
I love all the editing in this series. It makes the video much funnier without relying too heavily on what's "in", as the kids are saying these days.
I'm very sad that you left us in washington but your 10/10 content makes up for it
Sorry Ian, I won't tell you how you folded or how you did. I leave all my baking knowledge outside when I watch a Brutalfoods. That way, it's just goofy, silly Moose being endearing. Instead of me being a pedantic arsehole complaining about baking etiquette in a comedy video.
Honestly I prefer the tiny poverty kitchens. It's more relatable to me, Ian, you bourgeoisie scum.
I love u ian??? nice place too!
so, folding is done by hand by using a rubber spatula and gently "folding" whatever ingredient into the others to avoid mixing and stirring, I'd suggest watching a video on it, and with the stand mixer, use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides to avoid that issue with your sugar.
Do you think someday, Ian will have received enough youtube comments and help to be a human level cook?
Is the cowboy music from roller coaster tycoon 3? It sounds so familiar
The only yum yums I know are twisted donoughts.
I had deja Vu at 14:52 I just remember seeing Ian in a cowboy costume and talking about toffee bits. It really freaked me out.
thanks Ian. your paddle attachment is weird get a new one if it didnt come with one, it should look like yours but with a more in the middle . my teen and hubby love you as a mom i find your cooking insane. ThankQ
that costume is incredible
Ian shares my love for Take5 ??
You should've done a thinner layer of chocolate for the bark thing and the Texas yum yum looks really good
God damn that kitchen is hella nice
did you grocery shop at a staples????
Can you try making what’s called a Jello Cake? It’s super good and moist and I want to prove to my friends it’s a real thing lol
Your kitchen is gorgeous! I cannot wait to see more videos filmed in here, looks like you have a lot of room for shenanigans. And more Plops.
When smashing things in a bag a rolling pin is better.
Thank you for sprinkles
3 seconds in I'm in love
I live in Texas and I’m not even joking when I say this, when I saw the kitchen and the placement of everything I thought it was my kitchen. I was like “what the fuck..?”
As a general rule of thumb : use all room temp ingredients it’s easier 4 them to incorporate n work with :) if your cream cheese and whipped topping was room temp it’d make beating a breeze!
I don't know about you, but that was definitely some food
I’d love for BrutalMoose to mix his video game and food content and play games like my childhood favorite Disney Kitchen (I don’t remember if that’s the name for sure) or other food related games.
For the Yum Yum, I'd try an Oreo crust and way less chocolate, that might also be a good time. As for the Bark, I'd actually melt Hershey bars as opposed to milk chocolate chips and then go from there. Great video!
Hot damn! You moved back to Texas? Guess Texas couldn't leave you at all. Either way, welcome back to Texas!
This jerk ass rode this poor tiny horse the whole video. Without giving him a break! Unsubcribble
Wow i just made a chocolate pudding pie last nite and have never made one before! Great vid!
It just dawned on me that there are people out there who've never backed or used backing equipment
Lmao the chocolate sprinkles look like ants on the pudding pie wowie
Boy howdy didnt sid from Hey Arnold! Say that? I checked...yeah he did.
This is like Ian's 3rd kitchen on this show? Very mobile master chef.
I am consistently in awe of the fact that Ian owns a stand mixer
For cowboy bark you should have used heath bar
Wrap the bag in a towel before you do the smashy smashy my friend. It will help with the bag tearing problem.
I missed your cooking videos!! Got back from work and i saw this bad boy and clicked faster than you can say chorped. My fiance got an aneurysm from watching you cook lmao 10/10 would make recipe!!! Thanks Ian keep it up!!
Instead of a hammer you can use a heavy rolling pin and a chopping board to break things up in a bag like that
<3
Who needs read dead redemption 2 when Ian, the texan is here to solve our western Bordem!
Toffee bits are usually found in the baking aisle or in a bulk food store
I was about to talk shit about you but then you said you were from Texas just like me so yee haw
How hard did you have to struggle to not say that the Texas Yum Yum was yum yum for your tum tum?
As you move into your expensive new apartment, I hope you don’t suddenly become unfunny like Ethan and Hila.
That Texas Yum Yum looked really good. I may have to make it.
Ian wtf ??
I think its funny that most youtubers seem to get more polished and clean-looking as they get bigger, but Ian has become more scruffy as he got more successful. Love ya Ian, glad to be a long-time subscriber. Me me, I'm a Brutalmoose boy
I love how this video game channel just turned into a cooking channel
I was sold on this video in the first 5 seconds.
Folding in is literally using a spatula to 'fold' in the ingredient... So bring a fold up from the side of the bowl and into the middle. Basically, do it very gently and without adding a lot of air into the batter.
Also, only use the whisk (metal head) when it says whisk, haga
Here's a tip, Ian... In recipes, works like 'mix' 'beat' 'combine' etc. all have actual speeds on a mixer... If you look up the user guide for that mixer, it'll include what speed each word means!
Welcome back to Texas, Ian!
Ian, I was stressed through this video. But I about lost it when you cut into the yum yum and used the scooper backwards.
Your next video should have something to do with Steak now XD or Hamburg.
As someone who has to eat gluten free food I loved your response to the gluten free pretzels.. You should do a gf episode :) it's all gross
Cooking tip: when using most stand mixers things will get stuck on the side/ on the attachments. Stopping the mixer and using a silicone spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl into the middle will help get it all mixed.
yeeha
Who edits these videos they are amazing
Wow, the new Red Dead Redemption spin-off franchise is looking great!
this isnt ian's new house, he just broke in, hence his unfamiliarity with the mixers and then his loss to the location of the salt
WAYYYY too long since your last video. Nice looking place though. Get your shit together moose and upload more videos!
Your editing always makes me laugh! You are honestly so talented. Thanks for making stuff that we can enjoy too!
is your clock in the back ground working??????
I had to watch this on 2x speed cause I was short on time and it’s the ideal way to watch this tbh
I'm hyper for the cooking plops episode!
Always sift confectioners sugar so you don't get clumps
Ian has reached god tier editing levels
on the one hand, I found myself talking at you through the screen (which of course I know it's pointless, it's a Monday) but on the other hand, I enjoy watching you learn with us. Keep up the good work and always be learning Ian!
now I'm no recipe expert, but the pictures you showed of the texas yum yum from the recipe don't look like they have any vanilla pudding on them, which might explain why you had way too much for the crust. like, looking at their picture, all I see is the chocolate pudding layer, the cream cheese/whipped cream layer, and the whipped cream layer. am I crazy? did they add the vanilla pudding layer to the recipe but not actually make that one for the picture?
Wow never been so proud to be a Texan
Please review games again.
Oh boy! I love this :D More Texas foods!!! ^_^
Great video as always
In case the brutal murderer in the Food Lab isn't a look you want to maintain for future food crushing bits... You might want to place the baggie on a cutting board to protect the nice Brutal Kitchen from the remains of your enemies!
When is Televoid coming back?
Where's televoid you left us on a cliffhanger
Does anyone know why he moved?
Yo y’all is the best word ever Like being from Texas I say y’all every chance I get
No offense to Ian, but does no one in my generation know how to use kitchen tools?
the real reason i subscribed to brutalmoose
Are you sure thats pudding?
every time ian cooks in a video i get so nervous about his knife skills and general cooking technique I want to physically reach through the screen and help
Shoulda had a plop for the cream cheese drop
Oh come on, how hard is it to mash Graham crackers and melt butter for the crust?
Folding is important in making airy, fluffy desserts because you're mixing ingredients without beating out the air you put it by whipping/wisking it.
If I didn't find stereotypes hilarious, I might have been insulted by this XD P.S. welcome back to Texas!! Yeehaw!!
I love your editing style
when Ian came out in this costume I thought it was gonna be a review of Red Dead Redemption 2
Ian moved back in with his parents didn't he
MMM THEM SUCKERS TASTY
"No baking required" is usually a pretty good indicator of some terrible Southern grocery store dessert casserole.
My culture is not your fucking costume
You did not 'fold in' correctly.
The saga of the never-knowing-what-to-do-with-my-hands-while-talking continues
not sure if I'm imagining it or not, but I think I hear a little bit of an accent slipping back into his voice
Mmmm! Them sucker's tasty!
I should be writing an essay for college but instead i'm watchin this. Good job me
Great video. Sound design was on point as usual!
Thanks for the birthday upload Ian :)
Love your new home and kitchen! I really enjoyed the episode!
Mr. Moose please don't keep your whipped topping in the freezer, it belongs in the fridge
I'm from Texas love your video
You can never have too many sprinkles
Your editing so freaking amazing and very entertaining on its own.
Fuck you. I want pretzels and can't eat bread. How dare you point out the fact that I'll never be able to eat real food again.
BOY you really showed up out here with the guittard chocolate and kitchen aid stand mixer, that patreon must be going well for you huh
What is your po box so I can send you some damn kitchen supplies stupid wooden spoon havin ass.
Wade Winston Wilson AKA Deadpool Merc with the Mouth: Mmmm dang howdy ya'll Cowboy Ian along with Plops the Bull knows how to cook the best rooting tooting food in the whole Wild West Texas faster than a rodeo of Rattlesnakes partners. YEE-HAW RIDE EM YOUTUBE VIEWERS AWAY YIPPEE-KI-YAY MOTHER (CENSORED)!!! Oh and don't forget to like this comment and give Mr Ian the brutalmoose the love he deserves. Jesus those chocolate pretzels are making me thirsty!
Your clock is broken
Welcome back to Texas Ian! We missed you
While watching this, I imagined myself as an old Texan, and I think, if an actual old Texan watched this, he'd be pretty OK with it. Ian has no idea what he's doing in a kitchen, old men have no idea whatt they're doing in a kitchen, it'd all work out.!
How hard was it to film in that costume?
Wow i love these food videos
You don’t have to be lonely at farmersonly.com............... I’m a city boi -_-
I love these video so much
please PLEASE if you end up streaming the new red dead you have to do so dressed in this cowboy outfit it's very important
damn...plops is a big boi
The chewy soft werthers would've worked better then the hard candy ones
God dammit, you moved from Washington before I ever got to meet you. Oh well.
after watching so many cooking tutorials by perfect pinteresting pros its very refreshing to see such realistic uncertainty and mess like this is what would actually happen if i tried to cook
I like the Red Dead Redemption 2 theme. Love knowing everything is planned that far out
bowl
those are some mighty fine sustenances partner
I absolutely 1000% love this but I can't explain why
You know, you could have just bought the regular sized pretzels and broke them into smaller bits instead of buying the GLUTEN FREE SHITTY MINI PRETZELS.
MMMMMMM!!!!!! Them sucker's TASTY!
BEING TELEVIODS BACK!? Please...
Texas is best state, just sayin.
Where do you find the music? It's always so relaxing and catchy, it completes these (already fantastic) videos!
Oh god I was so concerned you were going to try and take the graham cracker crust out of the tin XD
I would say that now i could maybe see you in public but you probably never leave your house.
Oh my GOD WHEN YOU FED PLOPS THE YUM YUM IM YELLING
Brutalfoods always leaves me wanting to cook too.
Thank you for the effort you put into editing these!! When you were putting on that last layer of whipped topping on the yum yum I started literally laughing out loud ??????
I think yum yum is southern in general! My family is from Mississippi and we make it for every holiday gathering. For toppings instead of sprinkles we use cherries, nuts, and shreds of chocolate
Is this a cooking or gaming channel?
I like the new crib but i kinda miss the old one tbh
Will we be seeing you at Pax South?
Is there ever a point in time where we as a collective community should ask if Ian is ok?
Graphic design is my passion
In future, keep in mind that if you're Ok with the extra chocolate which is added to your recipe, you can use a chopped Heath bar to replace toffee bits in place of Caramels, as the filling in a Heath bar is toffee. But if you like Caramels instead, more power to you:)
Your texan is on point!! ... Almost as if you were from ... Texas ...
>takes off correct mixer attachment >adds whisk >returns correct attachment
House tour plz
These are some next level sound effects.
I really wanna try that Texas yum yum but I would have to get substitutes for so much of that stuff I'm not sure it'd be worth it
What in tarnation?! You live in Dallas!? Well spank my monkey sir.
I didn't know Red Dead Redemption 2 was this realistic.
I love your new kitchen.
This didn't show up in my subbox, god dammit youtube. That feel when Ian uses the whisk again lol
Where have you been daddy
Heath bars are toffee and they sell them in bits most of the time!
I just love every episode you ever make. Keep up the great work, man!! "Well, I'm a Texas Yum Yum boy! ..In a Texas Yum Yum world."
Me when i play RDR2
Plops looks like he wants to die
Who else realized he didn't break up the Oreos and was just waiting for him to realize it himself
You can only "fold in" by hand
I never heard of "Texas Yum Yum", but then I realized that's it's better known as a slush cake. And didn't you just move into a new place last year? And you already moved again?
i 2 hav ther t mend en meye freser
3:14 yeah wild like the wild wild west yee-haw y'all better like texas yum yum or you aint a real texan lile what in tarnation
Just wanted to leave a quick tip about your work of the kitchen aid mixer; while mixing you will want to turn off power to it and scrape the sides of the bowl periodically.
DALLAS? MORE LIKE GAYASS - This ad was paid for by the city of Houston
26:23 I love that moment of pure happiness
Delightful music choices
You were in Washington this whole time!? I'm from Washington too
please com to brasil !!!!! ????????
Ian is kinda bad at power tool saftey...
Ian when you put the whisk on the mixer, i cried.
This video makes me want to die and become immortal all at the same time. It’s like the time I walked into a bathroom at an airport in San Francisco and locked eyes with a woman through the mirror. She was doing her makeup as water fell from the ceiling all over the bathroom. It was the strangest experience of my life before I watched this video.
Welcome to Brutalfoods: where the measurements are made up and the instructions don't matter.
This is good.
god it truly is a good day when Ian uploads another brutal foods video <3 That editing always kills me! ??
Mmm, them suckers tasty! YEEHAWW
yeah i would love to try the YumYum as for the britle, yeah you need a thinner chocolate base, also maybe crush all the ingredients in the same bag
I knew from the beginning when Ian came in with a fake horse I was in for a good time
I hope my ex doesn’t know Ian exists... she would kidnap him and keep him as a pet.
Sometimes Ian will do something and i just wanna scream
Always a great day when i see an upload from this guy!
Brutalfoods vs Binging with Babish! I would love to see that video!
This vid made me hungry
Man, RDR2 looks crazy realistic.
I'm a yum yum Boy in a yum yum world
the glutino chocolate covered pretzels are amazing eat them
Folding.............. Kinda?
Well I know for a fact that H-E-B has all organic toffee bits for all your baking needs! help they have a gun to my head
Holy fuck.... I thought I was watching another 'after prison' show! Until...........dzzam zooo!
That pie is 100% fine. Because everything is bigger and better in Texas
Say what you want about Ian's kitchen skills, but you can't say he isn't trying his best!
0:09 he slapp the ass
Awesome video
a bit of advice, PREP PREP PREP! if you prepped better, you wouldnt have forgotten any of the steps. you want to have everything you want to use there, ready.
Should we tell him he's riding a bull, not a horse?
WTF @ 19:08
I can totally envision this on my minds tongue.
Thanks for having captions, Moose!
I don’t skip a single ad for a brutal moose video. The work he puts into his hilarious edits and amazing content deserves every penny ??????
I love watching this even though it hurts to watch the struggle of basic kitchen terms and what utensils to use.?? Don’t stop doing these I enjoy watching and seeing you actually getting better because you have definitely progressed! Thanks Ian for the entertainment!
Call Nicole‘s on the man man
I remember when you left Texas, after the "explores the airport" video. They grow up so fast ??
i was literally binging brutalfoods the other day omg
The fact my last name is Sprinkle, I feel personally attacked about embracing my inner sprinkle. lol
24:41 ????????
the red dead redemption 2 culinary dlc looks good
0:08 “Red dead redemption II (2018)”
"Prefered body type: living or recently deceased..." um.. Ian, you okay?
Oh my God, Ian. You have no idea how happy seeing this video in my sub box after a looooong hard day at work has made me. ????
I've watched you for a long time off and on... but these videos made me sub and I wish you'd make an editing tutorial, cuz you're amazing!
I normally find gluten free pretzels to be crunchier and better iunno
I legit saw this when I woke up, said I would save this for when after I did all my project work, and here I am. Gotta save the best for last!
For toffee substitute, if you don’t want to make your own, buy some heath bars and cut back a little on the chocolate in your recipe.
i got an ad for diabetes on the side of this video lmao
am texan can confirm this is actually how we dress and act. cept my bulls name aint plops, i call him pissback. on an unrelated side note i also have a bladder control problem.
That is one snazzy new kitchen
The key to success with those mixers is regularly using a rubber spatula to make sure the ingredients get fully incorporated. Folding 5/10
17:35 is absolutely jarring holy shit.
I live in Texas and these are amazing! Nice for you to do a video for the Lone Star State!
Feel really bad for you texas is full of inbred morons..Texas, the Alabama of Texas..
Your hair is so fucking beautiful, it's distracting.
To crush or "chop up" any nut, use a small paper back, put the nuts inside and fold it up, grab a table spoon and whack the bag with the back of the spoon like you're using a fly swatter on a counter, depending on how hard and how long you hit will control how fine you crush it. (Worked in a chinese restaurant for 5 years as a kitchen hand) Good to see you at it again, I missed your videos, love your cheesy editing, can't wait for more :D
Maybe don't hammer a plastic bag of werthers into your dirty garage and then shake said bag over the food you'll be eating. ...otherwise, great video as always
That was amazing. 10/10. You sir, are a video editing legend. Glad you had a safe move!
Fffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk I could have met you in Seattle
omg they made giddy up from fortnite into a real thing hahaha omg lol ????????
Pudding pies are amazing! Super easy to make and tasty. The problem with bark of any kind, though, is that it's really just hard, melted chocolate covered in stuff. What I like to do is get different colored candy melts, melt those down and mix 'em on wax paper to make a colorful bark base, then just cover the whole thing with sprinkles. Doesn't change the fact that it's still just hard chocolate covered in stuff, but it does look cool. Get some red, green and white candy melts, toss in a few drops of peppermint extract, throw on top some dark chocolate mint pieces, makes for a fun Christmas bark.
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks weird...
This video is a yum yum.
What were you snorting, crack?!
Living in Texas sounds horrid.
"Ages: Channelwood Preferred" Ian you satisfy my need for Myst references and I love you for it.
Good
Texas is great
Can you review more frozen food
My mom's been making that Texas Yum Yum pie for years. Don't sleep on it. It's legit amazing. Only thing that makes it better is using an Oreo crust instead of graham crackers.
30 men are in my freezer too
Looks like Internet Gamer Jesus decided to bring us a taste of the Alamo today.
i'm looking for the gluten free snack reviews
I LOVE YOU!!! PLANT A BABY INSIDE ME!
yum yum
Alton Brown you are not, brutalmoose, Alton Brown you are not
Ian, where did you get the cool horse from? I want to be a family friendly Texan cowboy food reviewer like you
As a Texan, I approve this message
Funny and fun as always ??
So dumb it is hilarious!
Nooo he left seattleee
0:00 when you've been playing Red Dead Redemption II all day and forgot to plan a video to record.
That's such a big kitchen! You could wear so many costumes in there!
Ian SMASH
I feel like he gets a new kitchen every episode
after years of dealing with people in multiplayer games and on the internet, I've grown a taste for the salt myself.
I feel like this becomes more and more like an actual cooking show every episode
This didnt show up in my subscriptions but was in my recommended videos?! Youtube wth?
Why do Americans drink milk with dessert, so strange!
new red dead redemption lookin good.
OMFG I USED TO LIVE IN DALLAS
You just blessed my birthday and I’m from Texas WOW <3
I can't handle the fucking sound effects in this one. They got me fucked up
Brutal, folding something in, in this case would be putting whipped cream in the middle of that bowl and scooping the cream cheese onto it and flattening it. It's folding something you have onto the ingredient over and over and combining it that way. Just thought you would like to know.
Ian sure does move a lot. He should change the name of his channel to brutalMOVES.
I don"t kkow if anyones said it but, the hard candy would of worked if you had melted and thinned it a bit and used it like a soft caramel.
I like how he turned off the clock in the background so we can't tell when he makes cuts.
So if you want to get the stuff on the sides, you have to stop the mixer, take the bowl out and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and get it into the mix. I'm not sure "how to fold properly" but I thought it was taking a bit of and mixing it in by... not quite mixing, but like.... a single mix. Like folding laundry. If that makes sense. You could probably do the same thing to the nuts as you did with the caramels, but with a rolling pin instead of a hammer.
Toffee bits should be in the same place you’d find baking chocolate in a grocery store- in the baking aisle just FYI
the legend never dies
Honey honey give me the yum yum.
19:25 Holy cow that is an amazing chocolate rain reference, I nearly missed it it was so subtle!
OH god, I live in Houston and I have a kitchen that looks exactly like that XDDD it feels so weird
YES BRUTALMOOOOOOOSE UPLOAD
Brutalfoods = Ian learns to cook with advice from his viewers. love the new vid, Ian! <3
This hurt my soul watching this but also made me laugh! Ha ha ha! That folding technique could use some... work but the editing is primo! ??
I love these videos, they're funny but also chill and slow pace. Also, here's a little tip if you ever use the KitchenAid mixer again. Pretty much with any mixer, if you find the food is getting stuck inside the wisk, or whatever mixing part you're using, turn the speed up as far as you can and centrifugal force will throw it out.
23:47 30 men in my freezer And now back to "Cooking with Jeffrey Dahmer"
Ian need to stop shopping at shitty health food stores.
I'd be interested in seeing a "Cowboy Bark, take two" with you giving it another shot with some tweaks to it to suit your tastes. Also, my Kitchen-Aid mixer is that exact same model and color as yours. I really don't get enough use out of it, so perhaps I should try making that Texas Yum Yum since no-bake ice-box cakes/pies are so simple to make.
What I'm most curious about is how any of this is "Texan" or anything "cowboy." That pudding pie seems pretty generic, and I learned a version of that bark in a Christmas dessert. Not complaining, really, but methinks the smell of arbitrary marketable adjectives is hanging in the air
Love the cooking videos and the plop sould effect. Keep it up!
Welcome back to Texas, made it just in time for the fair!
That’s the best fucking intro ever. Riding that bull should be how every video starts.
Ian... as a fellow long haired dude, your hair is fucking beautiful. Also your editing is fan-goddamn-tastic. I guess I have a bit of a mancrush on you. Keep on rockin in the free world.
Ughh it never fits...
As a born and raised Texan, I feel pretty left out since I've never even heard of these. ?? Also welcome back to Texas, it still sucks here. ????
The new Red Dead Redemption is looking good! Im amazed by this indepth gameplay!
Thought Beto was going to be in this.
That Yum Yum looked Yum Yum and now I want pudding....
My culinary school-trained boyfriend is providing expert commentary to Ian’s cooking....I’m enjoying it too much to tell him to stop ??
I laughed in the first 45 seconds
them suckers tasty. yee haw.
Ian I love your cooking videos, theyre amazing. I had already thumbed your video at the start, but the moment you said "Take 5 candybar is the best candybar" I immediately went to thumb it up again, only to realize I already had.
oh yeah, it's that time of the evening, sit down after a good ol' game session with a snack and a brutalmoose video, this series is one of my favourites on youtube!
this guy tries too hard to be iDubbbz
I like Texas. Yummy food
I audibly gasped when I heard the instrumental for "Manly Muscles" come on outta nowhere
You gotta scrape the sides of the bowl yourself my dude.
we have the same microwave
wow read dead redemption 2 looks great
Is that the sound of the coconuts from Monty Python and the Holy Grail?
As a represnitve of the great state of Texas i deme the opening a accurate reprsentation of are State
I like how he took a tip about breaking up food in a bag and used it for the Werther's but didn't think to use it for the nuts. Also, why are there 30 men in your freezer?
Red dead redemption 2 looks good.
...why are your pretzels in a ziplock bag?
Brutalmoose is the only terrible cook I love watching lol
The Texas Yum Yum really reminds me of dirt pudding. It’s basically vanilla pudding with oreo pieces in it, with the rest of the ingredients of course. I’m sure the Texas Yum Yum is just as yummy as dirt pudding! :)
Also, health toffee bits should be with the chocolate chips.
The clock didn't move...
The editing reminds me of a segment from 90s-2000s PBS kids EDIT: Its like the editor on Sesame Street dropped acid one day and just let it work itself out
Where are the bugs.
I love that brand of chocolate you used for the second recipie! It's so good. :)
now that you're back in dallas you're obligated to review the western freddi fish game
Guys... I think I have the same refrigerator as Ian.
I always use a hmuuuh-by-bluuuh size baking sheet when I cook. Also, watching Ian struggle with an electric mixer was the highlight of my Sunday.
Honestly so surprised you didnt burn your chocolate.
That kitchen is bigger than my flat room :D Can't wait to move next month.
A Texan making fun of Texas? I’m down. Also folding in is basically slowly mixing sideways.
Brutalfoods TUNA NOODLE when?
I was just thinking, “hm where’s brutal moose at?” Here he is!
You fail once again on the folding
Oreo's are overrated
Ooh! Please do a video on gluten-free replacement products! I’m allergic to wheat, and kinda have to eat it, even if it tastes like cardboard. The graham crackers are good, tho.
Mmm them sucker's tasty!
cookin with feces
I'm sad you moved! (I'm from Washington too) but your new kitchen looks AMAZING and roomy and you look happy to be back in Texas so I'm happy for you! I enjoy your content, thanks for what you do! <3
What I really enjoy about Brutalfoods is that having Ian trying these recipes for the first time, and overall not being someone who's kitchen savvy, he gets really excited about doing it right. It's heartwarming tbh
ewww why do you keep your tangerines in the fridge?
Hey what's up guys welcome back to Binging with Brutalmoose.
youtube back at it again, not showing me your uploads for the past four months. Time for a binge!
I'm sorry I'm commenting during watching the video, but you could just use the broad side of the knife to crush the peanuts
texas yim yum
Ian! Your clock isn't working!
Nine seconds in and I'm already ten times happier than I was before. You a good dude my dude.
As a texan I can relate to a emotional degree to the intro
Folding it in literally means using a spatula and folding the ingredients.
And as Cowboy Ian and Plops rode off into the sunset, they realized that their friendship was the greatest yum yum in all of Texas.
Welcome back to Texas! Living around Houston atm
someone should tweet gordon ramsey this
ian you need to scrape down the sides of the bowl yourself omg. -a baker
Get yourself some silicone spatulas boi! You can use them to scrape stuff from the sides of bowls, and to poke stuff that gets caught up in whisks. It'll save you from a LOT of electric-mixer related headaches. And you can also use the big ones to fold! (folding btw is when you scoop up mix, then gently flip it over on top. It's super literal. Like folding a blanket in half... kinda)
'Folding in' performance 1/10. Google it next time lol.
I am from Texas
grabs cream cheese covered whisk like a savage lol!
Real talk, I was hoping the freezer door wouldn't be able to close with the tray in it
sometimes gluten free pretzels are good and theyre a lot crunchier
Welcome back to Texas pardner! Yeehaw!
the sound effects must have taken up 90% of video production.
Ps, to fold in, would be by hand, not using the electric mixer, but rather folding it in with a spatula or spoon, like a very light mix so to speak
That kitchen is HUGE!
The goddamn sprinkle graphics cgchfj
Hey there cowboy, I reckon you probably got a heaping helping of moose hair in your recipes... delicious.
That Texas Yum Yum looks like a variation on my mom's Chocolate Delight, only instead of sprinkles, she uses chocolate chips. Considering we lived in Texas for a while, it all makes sense. Another great entertaining video, Ian! If there's some kind of Televoid!-like lore, I wonder if that second Ian with the hammer will come into play later ??
10:40 loved that subtle reference!
ian... use a rubber spatula.......
I cant stop staring at your kitchen. I swear, did you move down the street from me?
No matter where you live Ian, you will always be one of my favorite YouTube creators. Thank you for making such great content.
Nuts + ziploc + hammer = win
Well they do say things in Texas are bigger wink wink and you certainly did have some big delicious calories there ?? I can't say I like the bark, because I've had different types of chocolate bark, not a fan. But, I do love me some puddin, my favorite dessert at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Or really anytime. Lol plops wasn't feeling any of it though. Hah hah
i challenge you to cook without a microwave
From my 10 year-old cousin to my 85 year-old grandma, 25 year-old neckbeard and 60 year-old paterfamilias alike, and everyone in between -- my whole family loves your videos, Ian!
This is the 3rd brutalfoods kitchen
This is a great show. Because not only are you learning to cook by watching it, the one doing the teaching is learning along side you.
Does anyone else wanna see Ian do a cooking colab with Alton Brown? I do.
18:22 "brutalfoods meth lab"
Man Martha Stewart got nothing on ian
Red Dead Redemption 2 takes a weird turn at the end
That is %100 a Texas kitchen
Ian cooks so fast time stops. (*watch the clock on the wall)
Isn't there actually an MST3k episode where the girl unplugs the mixer to get a guy's attention? LOL She was all squishy and had "The Reds", as I recall. :D
how to properly use a kitchenaid ; for the love of god please make sure ur mixer is locked when you're mixing or you WILL eventually end up with a mess also,.,. to get the sides get the mixer attachment with a rubber side scraper
Gordon Ramsey, step aside, we have a new king in the kitchen.
Those little blackouts for your commercial breaks are really clever
I prefer milk chocolate. Dark chocolate is strong and bitter.
I used to be a fan of Ian, but then he went on a totally uncalled for almond-bashing tirade and now I'm going to have to unsub. I always knew Ian was in the pocket of Big Cashew.
Thank you for your Sprinkles
I'm sad as hell and this is what is getting me through the pain
1:35 preferred body type
8 seconds in and I can tell this is going to be a good one!
also I'm a little sad that you moved back to texas, I never did get to run into you in the wild and awkwardly wonder whether or not I actually ran into brutalmoose
i would be fine if brutalmoose just became a food review channel.
What exactly is 'pudding' in this context? Surely pudding is any kind of desert?
the first time you galloped over to your fridge i about shit myself
Texas Treats! makes rando recipes found on internet though I'ma guess Texas Yum Yum is pretty indicative of the kinda desserts you'd make for parties in Texas.
Yeehaw thank you for the delicious and plentiful bounty pard'ner
You should make a Cordon Bleu at some point. I think you'd quite like it.
You live in texas and you didn't get your stuff from HEB? :/
I remember when moose actually made good content
I work at Spirit Halloween as assistant manager, here in Tx!.. I hope you used a coupon for the inflatable costume, if not go back with it and exchange it for a new one and get around $7 off with 20% off, Before the 31st. Make sure to go for our 50% off store wide sale. November 1st!
Please watch with captions
You putting that plastic bowl into the microwave in order to melt the chocolate made me shrivel up.
Damn, that is a nice kitchen.
i've been waiting for this for so long
You should have done real Texas toast lol
I await the day Ian makes a very difficult mousse recipe.
ok 1.) im so glad you have a larger workspace now!!! 2.) yeehaw baby...
Wish I could be real life cooking buddies with Ian
Ram ranch
20:43 WOAH DUDE
Watch ian fumble with a mixer for 10 minutes
Someone needs to make a fan theory video all about Ian’s various personalities.
I did the version of the Texas yum yum but the base was oreo's and it was so good!
NEW BRUTALMOOSE WHAAAAA I LOVE YOU IAN IM GAY FOR YOU IAN LOL TOUCH ME inside
Return of the plop
why does ian have so many ice pops in his freezer?!!
Ian once again proves he is the king of editing
Mmm! Them suckers tasty! 00:29
You should do a Halloween treats episode if you can (I understand this kind of stuff takes a lot of time.)
Damn Ian get that youtube money look at that kitchen ????
I absolutely love you Ian, so goddamn much. But holy crap the cringe on your cooking skills has got me conflicted ?? like, let me come help you big daddi, I can't take it.
Are you high Brutal Moose
Darn it, Ian, I LEFT Dallas to go to Washington!! I still love you, though.
the subtitles makes it a more complete experience
Could just make toffee.
Do savory foods next but something unusual like rattlesnake or something classic like chili
I'm a little bit scared of hammer Ian.
just looking at the chocolate cake thing gave me type 2 diabetes
Why didn’t I get notified of this ?!? ?? what if I missed iit
Why you didn't said chorped instead of chopped?
Your videos have such a good feel and homely vibe. Feels like I’m cooking with my mother in my childhood kitchen. 10/10 would feast
15:11 OwO
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great!
Somebody call peta his steed needs help
1:37 that's a good Age :)
The first Brutalfoods to actually be brutal. Sad about my almond friends, but cowboy Ian is teaching me all I need to know.
I’m guessing the traffic for Farmers Only is skyrocketing after this video.
Remember when he called it CHORPING instead of chopping?? ????????
Did you move again?
American pudding looks weird. What is it? Where i live pudding is like a cake
Plops sure is rude not to eat your Texas Yum Yum.
you should try making some of the state fair recipes
1 out of 10 on folding, you do it manually using a spatula
Did I just hear larapin on a brutalmoose video? holyshit...dying languanges on my youtube? it's more likely than you think!
I'd eat the fuck out of it.
He lives only 3 or so hours away from me! Awesome!
Another awesome video thanks Ian.
the water bottle fuckin killed me
I want to see Ian do a show like this but trying to style his hair I bet he’d come up with some crazy styles
Man, the ending to the new Red Dead is insane.
I don't think any notification makes me happier than these
"Just a little peice" Grabs the whole thing ??
Ian, please use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl and push it towards the blender. Thank you!! Love you!!
Fuck yeah for Take 5
19:10
Bro I love your videos ??
Red Dead Redemption 2's Graphics look great
Got to admit, the mental image of how that Texas Yum Yum would taste made me think it'd be too sweet. But now I really want to try it.
This is what you get for beating RDR2
Someone give this man a cooking show on a major network.
Welcome back to the Lone Star State, brother. Have a great time in Dallas.
"Surprisingly okay" is how most people describe me. 22:26
You fold with your hands you godless heathen
Sweet boy, I love watching you try your best... ; w ;
the new kitchen looks so great!!!! i hope texas is treating you well :)
Hella funny love your videos, great moves, keep it up, proud of you
Wait hold up, you in texas? WHAT TOWN?
A tip from someone who has experience using that exact brand of mixer: it's a good idea to EITHER have a small spatula on hand to push unmixed particulates back into the area of the bowl where they'll get picked up by the whisk/mixer attachment OR stop it on occasion and use a spoon/spatula to push the unmixed particulates deeper into the bowl. Do the former if your recipe requires constant mixing, which some recipes do. For this kind of recipe either method would work.
for some reason his kitchen looks super familiar.
OMFG WHAT IF YOU MADE THE FIRST RECIPE WITH CHOCOLATE PUDDING AND USED PEANUTBUTTER INSTEAD OF CREAMCHEESE?????????????????????????????
Dunno why this episode is feeling like a nice warm blanket right now...
Ian how much money is it going to take to make this and the yugioh card openings a weekly thing because God, I need more brutalmoose
Hey Ian I got a halloween bark recipe for you to try. Melt white chocolate, then mix in candy corn and pretzel pieces, spread and chill.
Damn that Dead Red Redemption DLC is looking nice
I have never seen this guy before. This is my first video. Is this all actually real? Has he never seen a cooking show before? OMG WHY IS THE S FROM SEEN ON A DIFFERENT LINE????
Man red dead redemption 2 is looking fantastic
Ian! Taste test gluten-free food next!!
That chocolate one would be better if you just mixed the toppings into the chocolate when it was melty and then letting it harden again... though if you do it that way you would be better off sprinkling salt on AFTER it's spread out rather than mixing it into the chocolate.
I'm def makin texas yum yum
That black cup sure seems like more than one Cup. And each time it calls for only 1 1/2 cups of milk, that pitcher seems to be WAY more than 1 1/2 cups.
It amazes me how incompetent an adult can be in both his own kitchen and the grocery store. Godspeed, Ian, Godspeed.
Please do a Beef Wellington with Plops.
Ian has found his true calling with brutalfoods.
I think I get more excited for a Brutal Food video than any other video in my subscription box. It was like when a new JonTron would come out at the height of his popularity. Also - getting some serious Town with No Name vibes from your aesthetic, Ian.
Ian's videos legitimately are a cure for situational depression. I immediately felt better about my love life despite it having nothing to do with anything in here.
As a Texan, I can confirm that the intro is 100% fully accurate and now flawed in any way.
What the hell is larfin' anyhow?
Over 30 minutes of quality ian time
THEM SUCKERS TASTY
Now introducing kitchen number 168352946826483729646
gotta love the plop reference
As always Ian, your editing equally frightens and intrigues me
#foldingfail
I appreciate the bopit noises you mixed in when you took the mixer head off
??
When folding something in, you use a rubber spatula with the ingredients in the bowl, and go under them all, flip one side onto the other, repeat. You are folding the ingredients together as you would fold a piece of paper. Nice Video ( :
Christ cowboy Ian running down the riverwalk absolutely killed me
man... your editing is so creative
Noooo why would you leave Washington it's the best state
Howdy ian
I love your editing.
BACK TO YEEHAW COUNTRY
I crack up every time I hear the whip noise when you slap your steed lol
Don't worry with the mixer... I don't think anyone that's seen a single one of these videos is going to follow your example when it comes to cooking
It wouldnt be brutalfoods if you had the right portions
Did you check for toffee in the baking aisle? It's one of those things you'd think you would find in the candy aisle, but I usually see bags of toffee bits in the same spot as the chocolate chips.
I wanna be a cowwwboyyy babyyyy
I love brutal foods so much man, I look forward to watching it whenever a new episode pops up. Ian, you are a comedic genius and I hope you continue to upload these more frequently. I hope you read this! <3
Do you not have a food processor in texas? you could've chopped those nuts with a food processor in like 1 minute instead of using a chef's knife.
Ian kills once again. RIP old guy. RIP chocolate.
I don't think I can top all the howdy and y'all jokes in this video. Ye sure did a.. hankering... job... something.
Red read redemption 2 gameplay at 0:34
I'm sorry dude, but I can't watch any of your Brutal Foods videos without eating!!! runs off to prepare lunch
This video truly is the yee to my haw
Lmao he’s such a disaster in the kitchen
Stand mixer tip Yes stand mixers are notorious for not mixing stuff on the sides well. In the future I would recommend stopping the mixing for a second, using a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl and resume mixing. Repeat as necessary.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty!!!
You should try banana cream pie. Similar to the first recipe but replace the chocolate with ripe bananas and remove the cream cheese
Welcome back to Texas fellow UNT alumni!
Red Dead Redemption 2 is a lot different than the reviews lead me to believe
Does ian Brokeback himself?
"I want a Werthers."
Plop ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
When is Ian going to get around to making a Tuna Noodle?
What a lovely new kitchen!
ian thats a bull not a horse
I had to click off porn so fast that I had to listen to that garbage while I watched this mastapiece
I could not have possibly asked for a better intro
Ian affecting the Texas drawl is funny, but it does remind me of the way I usually speak Swedish with a neutral non-regional dialect (the 'common tongue', if you will) but just naturally affect a strong local dialect whenever I'm talking to my older grandparents. It's funny how a more interconnected world affects the way you talk to different people.
Is Cowboy Ian a canon character?
My God,so many calories.... :D
"I don't wanna talk about it, I'm just gonna eat it." Best thing you can say about food.
Hell yeah brother.
Ian's fascination with basic culinary ideas is endearing.
0:30, this needs to become a MEME!
My Memaw use to make what you call, "Texas Yum Yum." We just called it Pudding Pie. It fairness, yours looks good for someone who hasn't been making it for a while. You definitely need to work on rationing your layers, but it still looks good. As far as the "Cowboy Bark," I have my doubts about it without salt. Even with salt on the pretzels, peanuts, and almonds, it needs salt to take the edge off of the immense sweet.
From one Ian to another, thank you for an amzing and silly video. I love your editing! you made my day!
BRUTALFOODS FOOD LAB THEME PLAYS M-Manly Muscles???
I sorely missed you, Brutal. Also, as a born and raised "Yankee", I always had access to pudding pie. I question the validity of its Texan origins. haha
You sure like saying yum yum
You might dont know this but Brutalmoose was Araki's inspiration for Gyro Zeppeli in Part 7.
"Mmm them suckers tasty" ian oct 28 2018
Ian, you are back in Texas and you couldn't even show support of your own state's economy by buying H-E-B brand? Why don't you just emigrate to Canada if you're not even going to try?
The whisk attachment is always best for cream cheese. Edit: I make a lot of cheese cake. Brutalmoose used cream cheese fresh from the fridge, which I never do. I always warm the cream cheese first either on the counter for an hour or so or just in the microwave.
i think the texas air has gotten to you...
I come for the food I stay for the editing
i dont know if i like sprinkle time
Sunday just got a whole lot better!
I dont think Plops is real...
Hey Patrick, what am I?
Bruhj
That's a sweet ass kitchen!
I love how this channel is slowly becoming a food channel.
I'm gonna try making the Texas Yum Yum pudding pie.
As someone who bakes a lot, I'll give you the short version of folding: You put the ingredient you want to fold in on top of the rest of the mixture. You use a spatula to fold the mixture over the new ingredient, pressing down just a little bit. Then you fold it over itself again, and again, until the ingredient is just barely combined. The point of the whipped cream is to make the mixture fluffier, what with all the air in whipped cream. If you just mix it in, you destroy all the tiny air bubbles in the whipped cream and you don't get the fluffiness. Folding preserves most of the air bubbles and spreads them throughout the whole mixture.
IAN, HELP! Can I ake this if I currently reside in Massachusetts or is it strictly for cowboys?
This is the Halloween episode? I’m not mad just curious lol
YOU LIVE IN TEXAS NOW, HOWDY FAM
0:58 the flight. genius.
Ian, i have to say, your videos are so good :D Wish u got more wievs :/ Editing is just on a different level! Not sure its a higher level, but surely a different one :D
YEE (and I cannot stress this enough) HAW
Are you in Dallas? I feel like I made fun of you behind your back at a concert before I started following your videos
Congratulations on your move to Texas. You'll be better in no time. In other words you're not getting better.
i'm a little sad that ian isn't in seattle anymore. oh well
Hell yea welcome back to texas bro!! Im gonna make the yum yum pie for sure next time double back the candy and wrap a towel around that so if u drop any none is wasted
Wow, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks really immersive.
PLOP
You’re definitely my number 1 favorite creator. Your personality, the editing ... it’s all too perfect lol!
We gotta get this man some silicone spatulas.
fry some wood
Ian took a bite of that Texas Yum Yum and now it's in his Tum Tum.
Mixing pro tip: Scrape things off of the sides and attachment periodically so that it all gets beaten together!
howdy partner, I too like the salt
fry some wood and eat it while you review it
I first subbed cause I liked your Lego Island videos but now I'm here for the really novice cooking videos and I'm not disappointed in the slightest.
Fold things in by hand. You basically take a spatula, add whatever you are folding in slowly, and sort of gently scrape and fold over the mixture very gently. I'm pretty sure a mixer can't get the job done, the aim is to keep it fluffy or prevent gluten from forming, depending on the recipe. Also, stand mixers don't scrape the sides, you have to do that yourself with a spatula. On another note, did your parents not cook or something? A lot of this is pretty basic stuff.
Alright, alright, alright, The Brutalmoose has returned! Great video dude, your editing is so damn creative and clever!
Wow. The new Red dead looks great
Zero folding happened.
What a handsome cowboy.
Yo i also live in dallas.
It's like watching your drunk friend trying to flirt with a beautiful woman. It's somehow painful to watch, but it is still too entertaining to look away ^^
Yeehaw
Thanks for brightening my day with this new video, Ian!
You could've tried heath bars for the toffee element. Also pudding pies are a favorite of my dad's- my mom used to make pistachio flavored ones for him all the time
Why did we switch places? I LIVED IN TEXAS FOR 26 YEARS (Houston and Dallas) AND JUST MOVED AWAY LAST YEAR AHHHHH
Drinkin a Mondo there, eh?
You moved FROM Washington TO Texas? That's the wrong order.
You should probably lift the mixer's head to make putting the ingredients into the bowl easier.
I feel like I just joined a sprinkles cult
Welcome back to texas :)
Amazed you were able to cook while maintaining your balance on that steed of yours for as long as you did! Very proud of you, Ian.
would eat whipped topping with yellow cake any day
as a legit Texan I am in TEARS. bless your heart
Why Ranger Ian, you’re lookin’ mighty handsome in that cowboy getup o’ yours... making me wanna a-hoot-an-a-holler!
Your editing is so fun and makes me laugh every video! XD as a fellow Texan, I can appreciate the humor in all this and now I need me some Tx yum yum!
Digging the new brutal kitchen, Ian.
Who needs E3 when you can have T3
Anyone noticed the clock doesn't work? ^^
Before now, I didn't realize how distinct Texas kitchens looked. Like I swear I've been in that exact kitchen in several different people's houses. Anyways, welcome back and I can't wait for more Brutal Foods to take place in this very Texan kitchen.
oh boy. new moose.
That "Farmer's Only" joke had me rollin'! I know I'm gonna be randomly laughing about that all week
This editing always amazes me. Love this channel!
OMG I love how simple he is, I can relate to him so much! Never change! I love you the way you are. Your videos make my day <3
Did you borrow your sisters mixer? Or are you just into the gayest color, sea foam green?
Oh my god, this video is golden
It's refreshing to see food videos that are not only comfortable with but even celebratory of shitty processed grocery shop food
The Texas Yum Yum my mother-in-law makes omits the vanilla pudding, and just does the three layers (chocolate, whip/sugar/cream cheese, and whip). Fits much better into the pie crust.
You have good taste in jazz. Also, 17:20 sounds like some Brutalmoose original midi creations? If so, you have talent, my friend
Yo. For real. You make kitchen videos interesting enough to see all of it. I really like how you edit all to make that possible. Congratulations from a Spaniard fan.
Well ya see. I love these videos.
Hey America? What's whipped topping?
Someone's been playing Red Dead Redemption 2
Ian's broke and moved back home. No self-respecting man has magnetic knick-knacks and such on their fridge
Damn Ian, Washington is gonna miss you :c
God's not dead. He's right here, riding a fake bull.
I think you should make every video with plops the bull for now on. I will not be satisfied unless I see plops.
For pudding dishes like the Yum Yum, freezing them as opposing to just refrigerating them makes them easier to serve
god i would die for your new kitchen, it's gorgeous.
Man, 34 minutes but felt like it was over tooo sooon :( That's a rare talent, I usually bookmark 30min+ youtube videos to never watch them later.
You could have used a crushed up Heath candy bar for the toffee bits.
Is it me or is there some sort of high pitch sound in the background from time to time?
I feel that the oreo on the bark was unnecessary
Red Dead Redemption 2 secret level
Man, the amount of effort that goes into the editing is astonishing. It's a great contrast to the laziness in filming/acting. You care so much and at the same time, you couldn't care less. You are a gift to the world.
Great video as always! I really wanna try that first recipe.
As someone who is Gluten Free from having Gluten Intolerance, I can assume that yes Ian you were probably in the Gluten Free Isle, nearly every supermarket has one of those now. Also, Glutino makes some pretty good chocolate covered pretzels but I won't argue on the plain ones, they are kinda not great.
Please do a gluten free video
the texas yum yum kinda reminds me of mississippi mud pie
Hey your kitchen has the same layout as my parents, except there is no island. Safe to assume the house has the same layout and I can say stalkery things without having to work for it.
There's something about Ian in that hat that makes me say "yeehaw!" if you know what I mean. ;)
Plop
I hope we get some Void for spooky halloween!
You didn’t get this stuff at HEB????? And you call yourself a Texan
Huh, a cowboy related Brutalmoose video? Wonder what this could be related to? :p Fantastic video as always my dude!
You didn’t get this stuff at HEB????? And you call yourself a Texan
YEEEE-HAW.
its not a brutalfoods episode if im not crying the entire way through.... it really is brutal...
You should use your spatula the push the side stuff back into the area that is getting mixed
This intro scene solidifies Ian as the greatest food youtuber
I am strangely disappointed the clock in the kitchen is not real.
32:33 guess thats why they call him plops
Yes, Ian, pretzels Are made with flour. That means they have gluten. Pretzels are usually in the potato chip aisle in my experience, but rarely they're with the crackers or on their own endcap.
I love it. The new kitchen, the intro, everything!
Next week's video: Ian gets ants
Upload more videos
Its like ?? but sweet
rubber spatulas are a thing of god, amazing
I'm lovin' the new kitchen??
Great vid but I’d recommend to lapel mic in the future
I love your "it's probably fine" approach to cooking. XD
Yee (And I cannot stress this enough) Haw
Why does the clock always tell the same hour?
Ian's editing just gets better and better ??????
Ian, for cutting nuts and other small hard foods you should use a food processor. it's much faster and you have a lower chance of cutting yourself. also don't use a hardware hammer to crush foods, use a small wooden mallet. the mallet wont break the bag and is available at most stores. also for removing chocolate from a bowl like that use a rubber or silicone spatula, it's easier to scrape it off the sides since it's flexible.
Yee Haw
Caramel....CARAMEL?! IT'S BUTTERSCOTCH YOU UNCULTURED SWINE!!!
As a fellow Texas resident, the only dessert we have is another beer (or Dr. Pepper for the young'ins).
yee haw
I think you 'chill' things in the freezer my man
??????…
Nice new kitchen, Ian. Now you don't have to squeeze yourself between a counter and an oven xD
Who you callin pin head
plop
new kitchen looks great! I hope your happy to be back in Texas. I loved the video and can't wait to see the next!!!!!!!!!
yeehaw
How many times has Ian gotten food stuck in whisks and whisk-like attachments? AND IT'S A DIFFERENT WHISK EVERY TIME HAND WHISK TINY WHISK ELECTRIC MIXER WHISK ATTACHMENT
Ians outfit made me think of something. Ya'll ever heard of Ram Ranch?
Not gunna lie, I yehawed when I saw the River Walk.
Nobodys bothered by the feedback?
Man, that Texas Yum Yum looks pretty dang yum!
For some reason I thought that red drink, in the bottom right corner while you were cleaning, was cleaning fluid and I was MORTIFIED when you took a swig of it before I realised lmao
The sound effects are so good this episode. The old man ghost broke me.
that's a really nice kitchen. i need to get into the being a moose on youtube business
Plop
What's so great about dumb ol' Texas?
As a professional baker, this was... difficult to watch. Hilarious, but difficult. I audibly gasped a couple times. A+ content.
To avoid spilling when smashing stuff like Werthers, fold over a dishcloth over the ingredients, instead of using a plastic bag ;)
Ian buddy I love you and you're hilarious and great but holy crap Pretzels are made OUT of Gluten.
You kidding me!?!?! BrutalFoods on my birthday???? Man I already loved you can I like double love you or something cause this is insane, man.
Reminds me of the Jell-O Oreo pies that I make, or the Edward's Hershey Creme Pies! Anyone else ever had those? OMFG! They are orgasmic. I had to choose one night between Hershey Pie, and dick...Guess what Saia chose? Lmiao. The pie was strong in me that night, friends. Lmiao. Great as always, Ian. ??????
I could watch hundreds of these videos.
Ian, a wave like motion is good with a knife. Don’t really lift the whole blade up, lift it up to around the hilt, and continually bring down the blade and bring it up again.
MMMMMMM THEM SUCKERS TASTY!!!!! LOL
Werthers are amazing, they are the best thing since sliced bread
I'm assuming that will also he your Halloween costume?
I want to see you fly out to california to be taught by Rosanna Pansino. She'll teach you all you need to know about baking.
I thought nothing could top your Tiny Food intro, but you editing yourself riding your bull into a canal really takes the cake! LOL.
Always glad to see PLOP make a return.
Heath bars could have worked instead of werthers
3:54 that boy aint right
Yes, I always love this series! It makes my day. I love how you've transitioned away from your former content really well.
I don't like change
Don't mix with texas
Brutal foods is literally the only reason I'm subscribed
21:45 DO IT we want a video on that
10:15 Lol nope ?? Good effort tho ??
And using the mixer, it helps a lot if you pause the mixer and scrape down the sides with a spatula every now and then!!
I'm so happy for this dork. I've been following him since his Polar Express and Iron Soul reviews and such and it makes me so proud that he can afford filming equipment and a nice kitchen like this. He's not the best at understanding cooking instructions but that only makes him more charming.
kool aid bursts and fun pops. your moms the best
Hey so when you measure out powdered ingredients (sugar, flour, etc) you gotta spoon it into your measuring cup because otherwise it gets packed in and you're not measuring correctly. Except for brown sugar, you spoon that in and pack it in with the spoon.
Yaaas! Ian is using guittard chocolate chips, the only chocolate chips worth eating!
small tip for you! if youre trying to cut up nuts/pretzels or the like, instead of cutting them use the bottom of a sheet pan or sauté pan and set it on top of them and push down, crushes them nicely
A. You're supposed to scrape down the sides of the bowl. B. Folding is when you lightly mix ingredients by stirring (by hand) as if you were folding the mixture into itself. This is done with whipped cream and marangs, mirangs, merains? Whipped egg whites! to prevent the bubbles from being deflated.
it's pudding cheese cake and whipped cream whats not to like, other than the diabeties??
You've got a metabolism like whoa..
Y'all're forgetting that Ian is originally from Texas
19:20. So, this was a Halloween video all along!
My mom and I were binge watching brutal foods all night and then this pops up. Thanks, Ian!
Pretty cool that you could train your steer to only walk on its front legs.
Man, this Halloween special really was spooky! I’m all spooked! Look at me, being all spooked from that extra special spooky brutalfoods episode! Woo! Spook.
The mixer part physically hurt me
ian ffs look up a youtube video of how to fold whipped cream into batter. smh
You want to scrape down the sides of the mixer with the rubber spatula when working with it. Otherwise, you tend to get unmixed stuff on the edges
THE EDITING IS SUPERB
Hands down, best YouTubed out there. ?? love from Houston.
I watched this episode in the bath
Food is one of the few things Texas still has to be proud of.
nilla sounds like the white version of nigga
12:03 Yes? This is peta
I do hope you don't dress up like that for every video, having to twist yourself like that work, is kinda... uncomfortable even to watch.
Red Dead Refrigerator
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH brutalfoods. i have my own series based off yours. it'll never be as funny as yours sadly.,
Love the video, and I love your content but the editing is a bit obnoxious at least to me
love the editing as always. esp the chocolate chip bags screaming, always funny when screams get cut off
Toffee bits = Heath Bar broken up.
Watching Ian effortlessly gallop Plops across the San Antonio River Walk was the highlight of my day and I made 40 bucks a few hours ago, so you know this is golden
SO YOU REALLY JUST GON SCROLL PAST WITHOUT SAYIN' HOWDY...
Love you and these videos and their editing, Moose <3
How to tell if Ian likes a dessert Does he drink milk ?
Lovin' the new set! And the dark 'lab' area is also pretty great, like you took the werther's to get interrogated and tortured. I love the second Ian that shows up with the hammer for a moment! I would say less chocolate on the bark altogether, but in the first place, I probably wouldn't eat that, because I have a real problem with hard, crunchy things like brittle and stuff, although if it was soft enough, I'd try it. Yeah, though I'd probably pick of the oreos to eat on their own. Looking forward to the other creations you make in this kitchen, gonna be awesome!
Youtube didn't notify me :/
You're so wierd and I love it.
Ian, honey, I absolutely adore your videos and they just make my week!.... however, no, that is absolutely not how you fold. Try using a spatula more when you’re mixing. You can scrap down your sides with it, and fold the ingredients in with it. Otherwise, flawless!
Brutal fooooooods
I know several people who left Texas to jump on the herb train in CO and WA, every one of them have moved back to Texas. Texas is the best!
Great video, Ian. I have a weird question, what kind of microwave you have? I'm looking for a new microwave to get for my family for Christmas.
Just started the video and wow Red Dead Redemption 2 looks marvelous.
Wow the sequel to the hateful eight is so good!!!
Ian needs a new battery for his clock.
3:30 - Is... is this just because american pudding is different from ours or did you need to cook some of the needed milk and mix it and just didn't...? o_0 EDIT: It seems to have worked just fine. =D
the editing on this video is my favorite you've ever done by far
Another quality video from http://www.youtube.com/brutalmoose
If anyone ever decides to tweet one of these videos to Gordon Ramsay or something like that, let me know how that goes.
Wow do Texans actually eat sweets without a kilo of lard and meat? :O
Gluten free review soon?
The sorrows of young Werther’s...
Who else at like 18:25 just thought: MANLY MUSCLES!
I had no idea you were from Texas. You should do some more traditional Texas style cooking Edit: Y'all dun did gud cowboy!
I hate pudding, but that Texas Yum Yum looked... yum, yum.
Your extra texany-ness gave me HEB ads.
Don't you hurt that poor mixer
Folding 0/10. You gotta put the cool whip in the middle, then use the spatula to pull some cream cheese over it. Be careful not to pop too many bubbles in the cool whip. Thats the point of folding and not mixing.
Not gonna lie Texas really be like that sometimes everything is right except the weather
Y O U R O F F E R I N G D I S P L E A S E S P L O P S
The chocolate bark breaking in half was actually exactly right, chocolate bark is slammed on the tray to break it up into uneven pieces!
BRO that's probably the best video you've done so far and the call back to the water bottle being in the shot had me deader than a rattle snake on top of a 2nd rattle snake
welcome back to texas, where land is cheap and you can get several acres for the same price as a small apartment in california.
can u just watch like one episode of binging with babish
the video editing is 10/10, love it ian, keep up the good job. wow.
So a tip for next time with the mixer- Use the rubber spatula to scrape ingredients down the side of the bowl so they mix in better. You can do so without turning it off, or you can turn it off and do it all at once
Welcome back texas, or as we call it "Hell."
Cowboy Ian, sounds like a character that would be in Red Dead Redemption 2 who would chase you down while riding a bull.
I had a really bad day but this cheered me up immediately! ^^ Thanks
Ian can I visit you?
Are you high?
YOU have to scrape the sides Ian. You should also be scraping off the mixer attachment.
my family calls texas yum yum "Mississippi mud pie" and it's so good it has a subtitle: (better than sex) we also add pecans to a homemade graham cracker crust and we also usually make it in a casserole dish so you can see the layers
love the new kitchen ian!! lots of space for lots of brutalfoods
Today on brutal foods: candycrush
24:13 Nothing says "Either I'm flat broke or I filmed this a few days after moving" than a freezer with nothing but freezy pops in it.
LMAOOOOOO i cant believe this is what your content has come too. sad to say you played all the shitty learning games for the pc. hence the death of your content
never fails to entertain
THE CLOCK IS BROKEN
As an Ohioan, I gotta say you done Texas proud, pardner y'all.
The longer his hair is the closer we are to the next televoid episode
This Channel is a GEM ??
Stopped the video right after he talked about the pretzels, went to get a bag of Werther's toffees and WTF IS THIS COINCIDENCE?
Gluten free episode please!
Folding skill: 0/10 Folding uses a spatula, and you stir it up, making sure to get stuff from the bottom and pull it to the top
plop.
Yesss! I've been waiting on another Brutal Foods from you!!! My day has just been made :)
Steed? I think that’s a steer
And this is why you scrape the sides of the bowl with your rubber spatula, so you don't get streaks of flour or sugar in your batter or frosting. Also always be sure to get your ingredients to room temperature before using them unless otherwise state in a recipe. Things will incorporate easier if they are at room temperature.
Ian is slowly evolving into a better chef day by day. The keyword being slowly.
6:00 lol I had the same problem recently. Did u also borrow your mom's kitchen aid?
Giving Chef Ramsey a run for his money
When is the next game review coming out?
I love those sounds!
In the baking aisle, there should be a bag of toffee bits.
10 seconds in and im laughing my ass off. i love your channel
Welcome home pardner (I live near Houston so it's cool to see Ian back in Texas)
It dawned on me that he did all that work while wearing that ridiculous outfit. How did it not get in the way?
next video is just about the gluten-free version of things
9:50 Well you tried
Hey Moosey. Just thought I'd give a tip. Regardless of the terrible knife skills, try putting slightly wet paper towel, or a moist hand towel under your cutting board. That'll keep it from slipping. Also, I would totally watch a video of you doing a knife skills tutorial.
To fold - In a single action, run the spatula or spoon around the side, then along the base, of the bowl. Now fold the mixture over onto itself. Rotate the bowl 90°. Repeat until just combined.
Red Dead Redemption 2 is looking pretty good.
something oddly therapeutic about these types of videos
you can break the bark by covering the top with another baking sheet and shaking the two together. Peanut Brittle Method
I dont know if it's all that Texas sun or Moose making good dessert food but he looks so happy. Washington will miss you. Hope to see more videos soon.
I don't know why it's so entertaining to watch someoone who is terrible at something do the thing.
Mmm them suckers tasty
>Have an incredibly nice mixer anyone who cooks would want. >Never used it til now. I feel like I should tell you about food wishes but your unseasoned approach also makes your videos extra wonderful and sincere so I am at an impasse.
my boy.... you're supposed to scrape down the sides of the bowl while it's mixing so everything gets properly incorporated. My Boy.
The cowboy hat has revealed to me the Texas in your face and now I can't unsee it.
Welcome back to Texas!
Yeah for me its Milk Chocolate or GTFO. Funny video.
Also I have no problem with the channel if it turns in the furture into a cooking channel. Just a fun thought.
Ian's sound effect folder is probably bigger than my steam library
18:52 now Ian looks like that guy from Rednex. Please sing cotton eye Joe for us.
R u just slapping ur own ass in that costume?
Ian, you sadly need to rewiew the rest of the hungry man things. I think... but you don't have to if you don't have the stomach for it.
I was on edge the whole video, i was worried your steed will pop ????
Texas Yum Yum is the dumbest name I’ve ever heard for that particular desert For future note: Beat = paddle. Whisk = whisk. Use the paddle for pretty much anything that doesn’t ask you to whisk. As for folding, it’s done manually with a spatula, a slow process of mixing, not stirring.
Next episode: Plops burgers
yee yee ian
You needed the smaller boxes of pudding for the YumYum, and you stop halfway through mixing things to scrape the sides of the bowl for better incorporation. I'd also definitely suggest thawing your whipped topping completely before using it. Still, that recipe sounds delicious and I'd personally try it with other pudding flavors like chocolate and pistachio or vanilla and butterscotch. You could even use different crusts, like 'Nilla Wafer or Oreo cookie crust.
You supposed to fold not mix further. If you will mix whipped cream more it gonna turn to butter
Use a food processor for the nuts. It's quick and you won't hurt yourself.
Should've put the peanuts in a bag and smashed them up by tossing the bag at a wall/floor. Sometimes the best way to do something is also the most primitive way.
There's something special in the way Ian edits these videos where I feel if most other people were to try something similar, it'd come off as obnoxious or annoying, but I think because of Ian's relatively chill tone of voice it ends up mixing together just right
Can you like bring a real cook. To judge you. I would like that. I would watch that.
New kitchen again I see
Ian, when you smash something up in a bag, if you put a thick dish towel over it that helps with the bag breaking issue.
I- I don’t like pudding...
The plop made a comeback!
Man, words can't express how much I appreciate the effort in editing you put in.
The whisk attachment is for egg whites for meringues
When I think Texas dessert I think orange salad.
TEXAS Y ' ALL
Rejoice, a new brutalfoods!!!
I’ve never seen someone fold stuff in with a kitchen aid before usually it’s done by hand
Methinks the Brutalfoods Food Lab(TM) could use a food processor.
Your uploads are worth the wait.
Wtf I accidentally disliked it oh God Sorry about that! I loved it and fixed my mistake!
Ur from texas, you should know literally all pie is atleast 3 inches higher than the crust
I love your food videos! They make my day!!! Youre certainly my favorite food review/cooking channel.
Texas girl approved ??
The amount of sugar here is more than I eat in a year. Sickening. Another, if you please, chef Ian.
Instead of the hard candy I think toffee like Heath would be better.
Wrong attachment ! Nooooooòo!!!
Watching your videos is like the YouTube equivalent of playing The Sims 1. Specifically The Sims 1, not the others. Y'know what I mean?
The Texas Cheesecake massacre would go on to be one of the most BrutalFood crimes in American history.
I'm not certain if it's the same for something like the sugar you have, but typically folding is done by hand, not with an electric mixed. The simplest way I can explain it is just to take batter from the bottom and bring it to the top while slowly adding whatever you're folding in as you go until whatever you're folding in is distributed evenly. Might be different for something like sugar, but that's how it's done for when folding things like chocolate chips or berries into cake and the like.
O m l u didn't even fold it
One of the things I would have done differently with the bark is patting down the toppings into the chocolate so they'd have a better grip. IDK if you did that off-camera or not, and I'm not completely convinced it would have helped keep the oreos attached, but it might have.
The sprinkles part saved my soul
I am the only one that wants so badly that egg kitchen cloth?
Nothing in his freezer except popsicles
SOO GOOD, WE ARE HUNGRY FOR MORE IAN!
the red dead 2 role play is off the roof
5:56 ITS CALLED AN AGITATOR!!!! its an aggitator, damn it.
I love your content and it always makes me smile but for some reason this episode had me dying of laughter
I love you
12:01 I'm calling peta
Being subscribed to Ian over the ears has been nothing less than an extended fever dream I never want to end.
As a Texan, I honestly feel so attacked right now
Brutalmoose is the exact kind of content I click like on before even watching the video ??????
man, always fun to watch these videos, especially with all the fun editing, good job ian.
Bring back city boy Ian
Small chopping tip, if you wanna dice alot of small things like the almonds, hold the knife sideways on your cutting board, put one hand on top of the middle of the knife slightly to the tip. Then use your other hand to bring the blade up and down, sort of like a lever to chop it finely.
Has Brutal Moose lost his mind after some sort of mental breakdown? What the HELL has happened to you man?
I know this is off topic, but I need you and Chadtronic to review Kill Joy 2 ASAP. There couldn’t be a better Halloween special.
Woah there cowboy ian, that horse is so well behaved in your kitchen
Electric mixers don't scrape the sides. You have to have a spatula on hand to scrape the sides down when stuff gets stuck. You also have to scrape down the beater occasionally. Also the whisk was the correct one to use. You're doing great though! :D
Folding in is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Say you were mixing chocolate chips into the dough... once you add chocolate chips to the bowl of dough then you use your mixing spoon to pull dough from the bottom of the bowl over the chocolate chips and keep repeating until it's evenly mixed. It works better than straight up mixing which might result lumps. Also depending on what your mixing you don't want to overmix (a lot of more complicated recipes can "break" which makes it go flat when you want something fluffy). Think of folding as basically a gentle way of mixing.
Looks like Ian took a train back to The Town With No Name.
You did not correctly fold in however you did pretty good with the kitchen aid navigation. Next time use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides once or twice and then you can use the same spatula for folding. Folding is a light turning method to incorporate whipped stuff. The kitchen aid works too aggressively, even at low speeds, and ruins whipped cream (and I’m guessing whipped topping too ).
I just wanna see how many people i can offend by saying YO FUCK TEXAS
You had me at Cowboy Ian.
Ian, you have graced me today with another video. I thank you.
Y U M
Don't recommend watching this while hungover
12:03 well, you realize that now you gotta cook with bull beef in a future episode
Get along little moosey!!
In the future, when you're adding ingredients to the bowl, you can lift the top of the blender out of the way, so you're not just smearing Whipped Topping all over your mixer.
MANLY MUSCLES!!!
no one'smentioned this yet but WHY THE HORSE NOISES WHEN THAT'S CLEARLY A BULL? ian pls
Everything's bigger in Texas™! Including that kitchen o' yours. Git 'er done, Moose!
Your sound effects crack me up, I love these videos Keep up the good work, Ian ??
I know its a subtle thing, but I love how you place your midrolls in thought out places in the videos. It just makes the whole thing more enjoyable
Love your cooking videos, your humour is so damn good I could watch you cook literally anything even, Human FLESH (demonic laughter)
Yum yum
The editing in this video is so unique and interesting! I love it. Ian has really stepped up his game.
SHOUT-OUT FROM THE DALLAS, TEXAS METROPLEX!!!! NO WONDER WE THINK AND LIKE THINGS SO SIMILARLY, WE'RE FROM THE SAME PLACE!!!!! TEXAS FOOD IS TO DIE FOR AT IT'S BEST, HUGE FAN, ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED YOUTUBERS. LOVE FROM NORTH TEXAS, IAN!!! ???????????????????????
I'll never get over that AIM door sound
Damn I’ll actually make the first recipe at least.
bro I love your editing so much it's so surreal and hilarious ahahahhaaha
I'm sorry, Ian, but are you ever going to do another Televoid episode, or game review?
Poor Ian realizing he wasted some of the yum yum broke my heart!
I haven't got to this missions yet in Red Dead 2.
To fold in something you take it and sort of flip the spoon in whatever you're folding it into, this is to avoid ingredients splashing and to help well mixing ingredients of different densities, so in other words, it's completely unnecessary in many cases and people had no reason to get mad at you because in the end it effected literally nothing.
You don't know how long I've been waiting for a new Ep. ; D
binging with brutalmoose
If it weren't for you I wouldn't have known of gluten free pretzels and if they were different from normal pretzels Thanks Ian
All dem dislikes are from good for nothin city slickers
Howdy my nigga
Not done with the video but THE WERTHERS IS A MISTAKE DONT DO IT
Everything that contains flour has gluten normally. Anything that doensn't, doesn't. Gluten is a protein the wheat plant makes that links up with itsself and gives bread products their structure.
After mixing with the mixer, it's best to take a rubber spatula and scrape the sides/bottom of your mixing bowl, as well as scrape off the mixing tool you used. While a mixer is faster than hand stirring it sometimes leaves clumps where the mixer doesn't quite reach. Plus using a spatula to scrape will save you from having to use your fingers, and therefore less messy Edit: oh! Also you can find regular baking caramel in the baking department too, just an extra thought!
These are my absolute favorite videos on youtube, literally the only ones that make me laugh out loud.
33:47 loved the subtle "plop" there
Hey Ian, great video, but I've got a couple tips! - Good call on having a towel to wipe your hands on but if you're going to taste things with your hand, you should use your pinky to minimize cross-contamination and keep things a little cleaner. Your pointer finger generally touches more and is less sanitary. Usually, if only you're eating it you're safe though, as long as you start by washing your hands - You need to scrape down the sides of our mixing bowl with a spatula, that's why all the powdered sugar wasn't mixed in - Folding is a gentle mixing method that usually involves mixing using a spatula. You usually do this if one of the things you're mixing is some kind of foam or otherwise whipped and you're trying to preserve that Your technique has really improved since the start of the series though, awesome job!!
"pretty stinkin' yum"
I love the intro
I would let daddy Ian ride me
While I prefer dark chocolate myself, I do see how milk chocolate would've worked better. The milk in milk chocolate actually makes the chocolate softer and melt faster. The salt could've balanced the taste too. I hope you find that darned salt in the next video! And also...it's so good to see you back, Ian! Been watching your older videos in the past couple of weeks because I missed you that much lmao
Man, I've gotta send in some Pennsylvania German recipes sometime. A few of them are pretty bonkers.
Congrats! You just hooked me to your channel!
MANLY MUSCLES!!!
Yay more brutal foods! Texas Ian really rocks that hat.
San Antonio c,:
Person with celiac here. If you ever try gluten free stuff, be warned that it's basically the same but mushier and drier.
Yay Brutalmoose! I've been waiting for this!
Does Ian live in Texas now?
This is a gross appropriation of my culture
Ah man i love these food episodes
in a stand mixer ya gotta scrape down the sides when mixing things to get it all incorporated
It's so nice to see you back. I've missed your awesome videos.
Its just a guess but some store layouts can be confusing. Real pretzels are usually in the chips aisle, while gluten free gets its own section somewhere else.
howdy folks
To fold something in, use a rubber spatula or similar object (not a regular spatula though) and scrape down to the bottom of whatever container you’re using, then try to literally fold the mixture in on itself. Continue until combined. And that reaction to gluten free pretzels was all too real. I feel your pain.
For the nuts I would of put them in a bag and crush them with a Meat Tenderizer like my mom use to do with her fudge when she put nuts in it.
My entire life is just waiting for another Brutalmoose video.
plop
When shit gets stuck on the side of your mixing bowl you got to scrape it all to the middle
Ian, I only found your channel a week ago and you're already one of my favorites. Your food videos are some of the best original content on youtube and I'm absolutely salivating for more!
Red Dead 3 looks great!
i swear, ian is the only youtuber whose videos get better and better throughout the years
Omg that intro, I think I died
Ian, I fucking love these videos man. Keep up the amazing work
Folding in, so far as my experience goes, is using a spatula to scoop the base over what you are adding in. Better not to use the full cup all at once. For chopping nuts, just use a food processor. Hit pulse a few times, and you'll be set. Also much safer. If you ever need toffee bits again, in the baking aisle, you should be able to find Heath bar bits. Or just buy a couple Heath bars and smash them up (the bag method will work fine, so long as you don't let them melt.)
idea for a spinoff of brutal food "learning kitchen concepts with ian"
This is one rootin' tootin' video.
I love the editing in your videos! It always makes me laugh
Not even five minutes in and I think this is my favorite brutal foods so far
Y'all should review one of the Kraft Mac and Cheese frozen dinners and maybe some of the box varieties of Mac and Cheese.
I would love to watch you make one of my vegan cookie recipes. You'd probably get some good humor out of my butter and egg replacer.
plop
You americans with ur weird giant milk jugs Milk is supposed to be in bags u weirdos
So much counter space. I want.
This feels oddly racist against Texans. #Cowboylivesmatter
Yo Ian, please do a meetup now that you're in Texas! ??
I missed your videos man, hope you do a Halloween episode! Although this was pretty spooky....
So here's a cooking tip that doesn't really apply to this particular video, but it may be helpful to know for the future so I thought I'd comment on it anyway. My inner chef panicked for a moment when I saw you using chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate. It took me a minute to remember chips are fine for a recipe like this, where the chocolate is by itself. But if you ever have to mix melted chocolate with something like milk or cream, don't use chips! They have added ingredients to help keep their shape, so they don't properly mix into the liquid. Globs of chocolate separate out, and the whole thing never becomes smooth. So there's my very tangential cooking tip for you
If that’s not whole milk you’re not a real Texan.
Omg, yes!
Riding a Bull inside your house?! I've not seen such bravery
Mixer tip: The whisk part of the mixer is best when you’re trying to thicken something Like if you’re beating egg whites or making whipped cream. If your just mixing use the other one, I’m not sure what it’s called
Another Brutal Moose Classic! Great work! Keep it up!
Impressive how your horse is constantly doing a handstand
"I just made chocolate pudding, and then I ate it." I'd watch it ????
Ian. Seriously. This might be your best video yet! Yee-Haw!!
Dear Ian: When you use a kitchenaid, you have to scrape the stuff off the sides with a spatula so it falls into the bottom of the bowl and everything mixes right. To "Fold" means to gently fold the ingredients together using a spatula. demonstrated here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7P78MrqArk We do it so the fluffiness of the ingredients is not compromised. Your nut-chopping technique is fine! Keep your free hand on the back of the blade and rock back and forth. A more precise way of melting chocolate (so you don't accidentally burn it) is to use the double boiler method demonstrated here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsBLZxZUGQ (you don't have to chop the chocolate first if it is already in chips) Keep your eye out for gluten-free shit. It's everywhere now, especially in the baking section, and most of the products do not hold up to the real deal. Nice self rotating dish thing! Sincerely, Someone who bakes a lot
Watching these is both hilarious and frustrating. That's an artform.
Sprinkle time was a life changing experience. Thank you Ian.
yeehaw
IT LIVES!
you had way too much fun making this video, haha!
ram ranch intensifies
Congrants on thee new place! :D
Yim yum
Hey Ian great video! That pie came out tight. Usually when I make pudding pies the pieces fall apart I do have some suggestions Whenever you work with cream cheese, thaw it out before hand (maybe an hour beforehand) You were also right you should have scraped down the confectioner's sugar while it was stirring (if you don't feel safe, stop the mixer then scrape)
Almonds are very good for you. Best way to eat them IMO is buy the M&Ms white bag.
Dadgum chief you're spoilin' us with 30 minutes of intensified Texan cuisine goodness
Love your channel! Beaumont native over here, partner!
Why dont you make more game rewiews?
“Preferred body type: living or recently deceased” Same, man. Same.
HES BACKKKKKKK
Sometimes I think you're serial killer till I realize I look the same way when I use tools, I love your edits and sounds effects really be having me dead ??????????
Liked the video just for the almond pun
Film theory: Ian is actually a good in his own universe, in which he can change a scenery a bunch of time and multiple of him exist, also his only way of entertainment is through a universal communication device to upload stuff on YouTube (of course I don't take this seriously, I'm joking)
You gotta do more Texas treats - may I recommend Bayou Goo Pie, kolaches, and Texas sheet cake?
bake something will'ya
Love the smooth jazz
Moose liking all these comments makes me think he was high while doing it.
That new kitchen looks better than my future
This is as American as it gets..I wanna go to America.
LOVE THE FUCKIN BOP IT SOUND EFFECTS AT 10:38
I can totally picture Plops getting bored while you're making the desserts, wanting to liven things up.
No you're supposed to buy the nuts already sliced xD
why did you move back to Texas? didn't you move like only a few months ago?
When my grandchildren ask me what did i use to watch im going to show them this
you're parent's house is nice !
I appreciate Ian embracing my culture and it's people.
Can't finish. GJ.
Get off your high horse, Ian! Seriosly though, I adore your videos. Thank you, they're real treasure
YOUR EDITING MAKES YOUR VIDEOS VERY ENGAGING
Well if people yelling @ you for not folding it correctly weren't telling you how, then they're in the wrong
Man all your videos crack me up so hard
why are you putting pretzels and salt on chocolate? whats happening in america? why do i get more scared of texas everytime i learn something new about it
More brutalfoods? Sign me up.
I wasn't really hungry, and only took a short break from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. But the Moose uploaded something, so here I am, pizza in hand, feet on the table. God, I love these videos. :-)
I think i would have just mixed everything into the melted chocolate instead of sprinkling it on top
For future nut reference, its better to stick them in a bag like you did the werthers and just hit them
a new brutalfoods, actually made my weekend
That’s one nice kitchen you got here cowboy
Get a slapchop.
So now that you're back home and still cook like a disaster, I feel like you should do a #brutalfoods episode with your mom or something.
Man's hair its amazing
Welcome back to Texas, Ian! .....yeehaw?
This is like one of the few things that has ever made me feel proud to be from texas i love u ian
I hope you enjoy making these videos as much as my friends and I enjoy watching them. Keep up the great work!
I gasp every time I see a new video
Sad that you have to leave your fellow YouTubers behind in Washington but welcome back to Texas!
Congrats on the move... if it's what you wanted. We're moving to Texas in a couple months ourselves.
There's something I made a few years ago for my birthday called "Man Bars" that turned out really good if you want to try another dessert recipe in the future. It's basically little cookies made of graham cracker, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, vanilla, salt, powdered sugar and either walnuts or pecans. When I made them, I subbed in peanuts because I don't really enjoy pecans or walnuts that much and it worked out really well.
Hey Moose! If you ever need to crush something, using a rolling pin or a meat tenderizer works well instead of a hammer :)
That's some tasty desserts y'all!
Folding in performance: Kinda?
Pretty sure Vincent Smith would be down for your version of the cowboy bark. After all he was sent to prison for stealing a bag of werthers.
Parchment paper should be the size of your baking pan, unless the recipe calls for it to go over
Do you create your own sound effects or do you have a huge library you got somewhere?
18:21 MANLY MUSCLES!
stoop kid never leaves his stoop
I’m from texas and this entire video is 100% accurate
Did little Ian run away. Plops for the win.
Who else thinks he looks like the llama deafault skin from fortnite season 6
Dislike for “smallmonds”
I've never tried a Take 5 bar until today. Ian is right about it being the best.
Legend has it that no tourist made it out alive crossing texas from one end to the other. All perished from clogged arteries from the good food
Good to see you back Moose! Yeehaw indeed and verily.
This series always worries me. I mean... he's never seen cream cheese?!?
beat the cream cheese. grab a base ball bat and beat that cream cheese like it owes you money
Why are you guessing how folding in works? Why not just look it up if you don't understand?
??????????
Why are you guessing how folding in works? Why not just look it up if you don't understand?
Your transitions are fucking awesome. You still edit your own stuff?
MORE BRUTAL FOODS YES
Our god has returned
I really wanted a halloween special but ian is using a costume so im happy,love you ian
Damn I moosed your editing
Welcome back to Texas! - From Houston
I feel that fridge thing, we had to put our leftover pizza on a plate bc the boxes were too big lol
this video made me say yeehaw
I wanna taste that YumYum. ( ?° ?? ?°)
I love red dead redemption 2
0:29 PUT IT ON A SHIRT!!
In regards to large chunks of toppings like Oreo not sticking, something else you can do that I've done with similar stuff, is to make up a little bit extra of the chocolate base and save it for after you've topped it, and kind of put light lines or swirls of the chocolate over the top, so when it sets it holds everything down a bit. I think for the second recipe my preferences would be to use milk chocolate too, I like chocolate but not big into bitter dark chocolate.
Oh man, I wanted to sleep but brutalmoose posted so I guess I won't
Please don't cut into the bags like you did with the chocolate chips. It's very easy to slip and stab yourself. For your health.
When there's untapped potential on the sides of the bowl, use a spatula to scrap down the sides, as you want to incorporate all the ingredients.
Love the spooky bits! They make this a semi Halloween video. XD
Jesus 3 brutalkitchen's in 2 years
Hope you enjoyed the evergreen state, please come back soon ?
I had one goal in life...to randomly be in Seattle doin' shenanigans...I'd see Ian and scream HEY MOOOOOSE! and run away into the night. You've deprived me of my stupid dream, man. Not cool.
Damn, I'm gonna miss that tiny kitchen
HE LIVES!!!
My culture is not a costume. We cows are very offended by it.
why tf am I critiquing your cooking ? I don't cook I only watch binging with babibi
MMM THEM SUCKERS TASTEY
This series should just be called "Ian has a hard time with whisks"
I love brutalfoods episodes
Fellur folding in something is putting the 2 ingredients in a bowl and then with a spatula scraping the bottom and "folding" it on top
Oreo were introduced March 6, 1912; 106 years ago and are a discount version Hydrox cookies which were made years before.
the editing in this video. like always, is fucking insane and i love it
2,300+ likes vs 13 dislikes
I've never been offended by Texas Stereotypes, but I've always been mildly annoyed because I'll go to tell someone Texas isn't like that but then 6 people on Horses just go past my house blocking the entire road and I know they're right.
-"in the worst case scenario we got too much chocolate and who doesn't love that?" -"the chocolate overpowers everything else" man I love brutalfoods
Whoa, that's a nice kitchen
Damn fine pie there.
Real Title of the episode: "Ian learns how to use a Kitchen Aid." :D
I love your editing so much
Wow. Apparently it's impossible for me to watch a BrutalFoods video without giving it a like before the end... ! Ian, your editing... It's is amazingly silly ! I love it ! The "plop" at 4:27 caught me off guard. Now let's continue watching.
There's never anything good on Sundays BrutalMoose: Howdy! I can fix that
Really enjoyed this quick look at Red Dead Redemption 2, looks promising
As a fellow Texan, I can confirm a rattlesnake on a second rattlesnake is rather fast.
I'm from Texas, too. The Mexican side. So less "yee-haw" and more "gimme your money ese before I fuck you up homes"
Congratulations on moving back to TX, Ian! I have family in the East of the state and have been thinking more and more of moving out there, ironically from WA!
Your editing is also just golden such a treaT
is your clock broken or did you freeze time to make this video?
Ah yes. The best god damn state in the country
I’m from Louisiana and I can’t comprehend why someone would choose to live in Texas. I prefer to believe Ian just did it for the lolz
24:30 - 24:45 alone deserves a Thumbs Up. :)
YAS!!!!!!!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN.
Never change, Ian.
Hello Ian, How about reviewing more frozen foods? Love, Me
Amazing video as always! ?
frozen pot pie reviews? banquet vs marie c’s?
that echo tho
Excellent Video! I am always excited when you"plop" out a new one. Keep on going making such good content, loving it!
I’m soooooo hard right now.
Welcome back to Tejas we missed ya’ll. Seeing you move about the kitchen with your trusty steed had me rolling. That looked mighty finely tasty and was a hoot to see you create. As always I love y’all videos. I certainly embraced my inner sprinkle. I didn’t know y’all had 30 men in the freezer, sounds pretty chilly.
Hope i see plops more in this channel
I'm only 10 minutes in but I have to stop and say Ian please get a spatula and use it instead of your fingers hhhhhhhh
Why do so many southern kitchens look like this?
I like how everyone is a professional chef apparently.
LOL! That intro, totally worth the wait for your new video :)
A brutalfoods episode! thumbing up regardless Vincent Smith will try to steal that bag of Werther's.
How are those freezer men doing?
How are you even alive you should have starved to death years ago
I don't know about you guys, but BrutalMoose is the only youtuber that really feels like your friend above everything else.
Red dead redemption 2 looks fantastic
Ian really has one of the best editing styleson YouTube
You know, I never thought I would see a man on a cow smashing Werther's Orginal in a garage with a hammer while hard rock plays. This is why Brutal Moose is the greatest, and why I'm scared of him
When using a electronic mixer, stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl so everything gets incorporated properly
Is the channel going to be called Texasmoose now?
23:50 peak comedy is not knowing if that's a typo or not.
I can feel the Texas flow thru my mouth and exit through my narrow urethra
IM CRYING
I live in Sweden and I have never heard of Whipped Topping. WTF is that?
Yee, and I cannot stress this enough, /HAW/!
Plop.
You need to make tuna noodles (my favourite) next time !
Moose Moving Up In Worlds
Chocolate pudding pies and chocolate covered pretzels are my favorite sweets so this vid made me hungry af. I agree that Milk chocolate would be better for the bark. nothing beats milk chocolate, pretzels and seasalt with a dash of caramel <3 I might try making some of that bark with my nephew, load him up on chocolate just before his mom picks him up. Great vid as always.
THE LEGEND IS BACKKK
I fucking love the little audio edits. It's very Ed, Edd n' Eddy.
Tha'ss gonna be some mighty tender beef by the time Ian is done beatin' the heck out've it :o I never heard of a Texas Yum Yum, buh... well, sure looks tasty :o
I'm so happy rn
A new house?! ??
Ian, I love you and I love your channel... But when did the channel become just about food? ??
in brazilian portuguese "anjo" literally means angel, but in recent years a repurposing has been happening where the meaning of it can be used as "a sweet person, so fun and adorable, someone so nice you just can't help but smile and laugh when you are in their presence" just to sumarize, when i watch ian's videos i just wanna scream "anjoooooooo" into the screen.
So I think the bark might have been more than 'eh' if you'd melted your caramel down into a salted caramel sauce and poured that over the top. That way there'd be less of a chance of breaking your tooth and dispersion of the caramel flavor with some salt which would help cut the dark chocolate taste. Also! Yes to hitting things in bags, though you can try the smooth end of a meat tenderizer so you don't rip the bag.
oh boy howdy this is a real TEXAN BOY THATS FOR SURE
absolutely wonderful content as always and that cowboy bark (yeehaw) looked delicious
I can't believe you did Texas desserts and the internet just completely failed you by not suggesting Texas Brownies, the single best chocolate-based dessert on the planet.
plop
Watching Ian mess around with that expensive piece of cooking equipment was a painful experience. Treat your kitchen aid with respect!!!
Brutalfoods may be my favorite thing on the Internet
I really enjoy those videos? It really make your editing/humour shine
this reminds me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIR68SbPg-U
The world needs some "Plop" t-shirts
> Being on a diet > Watching Ian make desserts What coulf poffibly go fronf stuffing oreos in her mouth
When’s Ian getting his own TV show?
Red Dead Redemption 2 graphics looking good
I love these brutalfoods episodes IAN! But, what the hell happened to the televoid series man? You Can't just leave it like that. I mean, you can because it's your channel but, it would suck, lol! So yeah, dont leave it hanging like that, just yet Ian.
Ian's legs have gotten a lot shorter since the last time I saw him. Must be from all of the sitting he does during editing.
I love your channel and I love the food series you’re doing right now but ngl, you shouldn’t be allowed in the kitchen other than to do the basics.
The texas yum yum recipe calls for puddin', but can I substitute pudding instead?
19:25 ??Chocolate Rain??
wot in tasty texas tarnation is this? also, watching you try and operate an electric mixer was painful lol
this was more fun and informative than pornhub on sunday YEE HAW!
I thought you were going to call your steed PBG and am almost sad you hadn't.
Ian doesn't have an accent for someone that grew up in Texas
at the end there i was really expecting ian to say "and thats why they call him plops"
Ian dude, I you needed to split those pudding portions in half to make it look nice in the crust. You had enough to make two of the Texas YumYums. I'd still eat it tho. Chocolate pudding is my jam. Also, get yourself a decent SlapChop or something like that. That way you can chop up things like nuts and veggies without removing a finger. XD
Ian! Cowboy Ian? Thank you for the video! It kept me company while I built Ikea shelves. It also made me want food. Good job! Also, when you fed Plops the Texas Yum-yum at the end, did it result in a cowpie on the floor? Ahh, the challenges of being artificially fused to a steer.
You should try peppermint bark it’s really good
Such a highlight of my day seeing a new video from you, Ian. Now I'm hankerin' for some pudding.
Mmm! Them sucker's tasty
Oh my god billy joe bob he’s back in town’
I have the sneaking suspicion that the Brutalfoods Kitchen Lab...may not be a kitchen lab...but a garage..
P L O P
Plop it! Mix it! Spread it! Chop it! Crush it! Melt it! Pour it! Top it! Freeze it! Spin it! Cut it! Eat it! Milk it!
The whole reason you can mostly only taste the dark chocolate, is because the salt helps cute through that strong, bittersweet dark chocolate.
Ian, I just wanted to say that I truly look forward to these food-centric videos more than almost any other content on YouTube. In fact, my subscription box is full of comedic food channels! I hope you realize how much fun and unique these are and I hope you never stop! Thanks again!
Man, this has me hyped for Red Dead Redemption
I love and appreciate the quality of your videos. Thank you. :)
Red dead redemption 2 looks good.
Ian using the mixer is some of the funniest shit. He has no fucking idea what hes doing
I know what I’m making at the next rodeo.
Oh :(
Hello Ian, you never seize to amaze me! You could literally read the back of a cereal box and you'd find a way to make it entertaining. Keep doing what you love and wish you the best, man. Probably your only fan from Saudi, Cheers. P.S. Sorry in advance if there are any grammatical errors. English is my second language.
Welcome to Texas! Shop at HEB
Tik tok made me lose faith in humanity Jesus where are you
Ian should make Surreal Memes tbh, his editing sometimes feels like one
When adding confectioner sugar or more powered type ingredients, sifting them helps with not ending up with chunks.It's looks great though :d
The Manly Muscles song was one of the best callbacks of all time. Thank you, sir.
These videos always brighten up my day, thank you.
The new red dead redemption 2 gameplay looks sick
T H E M S U C K E R S T A S T Y !
yeah, gluten free stuff is basically made without wheat flour (your standard white flour), and processed somewhere wheat flour isn't used either. usually a blend of different flours are used to compensate, and it tastes... weird sometimes. most gluten free bread tastes like moist cardboard. it's very sad. doubly sad that i have to be gluten free since i have celiac. but i've learned to cope. i'm sorry you had to experience the gluten free food taste sensation by surprise.
i have lived in texas my whole life and i can confirm everyone says y'all just about every other sentence
I was on my way to sleep but then saw this video. Sleep can definitely wait! (we have the same rice cooker, btw)
I am not going to get use to the new kitchen yet ya'll (I live in Ohio not Texas).
The way powdered sugar works, you have to use a spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup, because if you just scoop it regularly it packs together and you get too much. Unless the recipe specifies, it's better to spoon it in rather than scooping directly with the measuring cup.
I see someone is excited about the new red dead game.
My favorite chocolate bark is rocky road. Milk chocolate, marshmallows and almonds. Really tasty.
this is getting me in the mood for christmas, oddly enough
Why is there a huge bag of freezie pops in your freezer?
welcome to texas rupert the bear he is the bear with a lotta hair
It's like every time I turn around you're in a new kitchen. Kitchen World Tours.
Texas Mentioned, Swell with TEXAS
This just made my weekend. Great work Ian.
Dear Ian To fold something into something else, put both in the same bowl, grab a spatula or rubber scraper and scoop, lift, flip, drop, repeat. It's meant to gently mix two things together
Oh man, that Texas Yum Yum looks amazing. I might just have to give that a go.m myself.
The music sounds very much like it's from the early Spyro games, lol
How did cowboys make the bark back when there where no Oreo's?
18:32 is such a mood
Another brutalfoods is honestly christmas
lmfao I was dying when the plane traveled across the world just to get to the other side of the country
My dad’s old house looked just like this
Oh wow, never knew you're from Texas. Reminds me I have a character from Texas in my story I might never actually start. lol 19:14 - How did I guess he'd get smashed? lol (I didn't guess he'd become a ghost though)
Question: Am I only allowed to make and eat these tasty Texas treats in the titillating territory of Texas?
This dude feelin the red dead 2 fever
Totally accurate to Texas
Those "Bop It!" noises.
Try the second dessert with only peppermint/candy canes and salted crackers.
Don't get how you're not more popular on YouTube. You have Such a unique editing style and humour
I just fucking lost it at 25:39 how DARE I'm sOBBING
I love Brutalfoods so much! Between the editing and the laid back presentation and chill music, it just makes for quality entertainment.
So weird to see you actually prepared with all the ingredients and tools you need to complete something. I can't say I like it...
10:52 Me when I see that Ian uploaded a new vid
Everything’s bigger in Texas, including the kitchens
Dude what the hell, how can someone be this good at making videos. Top tier content my man
make sure you scrape the bowl, so you get all the ingredients mixed in next time also its easier to just put the whipped topping in a pipping bag easier to design and cover,
Pro: the editing and comedy of Brutalfoods is phenomenal! Con: so MESSY!!
And I thought Red Dead Redemption 2 would be my favorite piece of western-themed entertainment this weekend.
I'm like man that cleaner looks like a squeeze it. Then he proceeds to drink it.
I missed you Ian, I'm only a minute and a half in and it's already worth the wait
yeehaw pardner im the comment man wid de stereotypical texan accen’ an southern spellin! i aint so creative wid these comments, but i sure do try pardner!
Ian. When folding something into something else, typically you do it by hand. What you did is more like incorperating. Folding is literally like, folding. But you still did a decent job for the most part. Folding creates a more light and airy texture when done right. You might notice that your pudding pie is a bit dense. That's the difference. Incorperating is something you do when you fully want something mixed in. And Ian, finally... Your knife skills still scare the shit out of me, lol.
diabetes.
This video is a Texas treat
10:39 "push it.. twist it.." BOP IT
P L O P
I may be late but I don't care!!! Love your vids Ian! Keep em coming
Does your family ever watch your videos and question your sanity? ??
ian.....i reckon that horse yer riding looks suspiciously like a bull....juss sayin, pardner.
Best RDR2 gameplay yet
What does ian use on his hair it always has such volume
Red Dead RedemptIAN
Red dead redemption 2 looks great!
Plops is the goodest boi
Dude finally I love these videos ian pro chef tip put a moist towel or paper towel under your cutting board so it doesnt move when you cut... on it. Also tried making your chocolate Mason jar penut butter balls came out bomb !
Can't get enough of these cooking videos, keep it up Ian! I'd love to see you try some foreign recipes as well (Like "brigadeiro" and "coxinha" from Brazil).
Food Network better be paying attention to our boy Ian
15:33 As an architecture graduate, I am appreciative of Ian's measuring system and can confirm that we also use it in the field
I wish Brutalmoose could go back reviewing bad pc games or video games.
Ol' Texas Tanner strikes again
I remember when this guy used to do mainly game reviews. Now, he's the only cooking YouTuber I'm subscribed to.
Honner the texas flag, i pledge allegiance to thee,texas,one state under god one and indivisible Edit: HOLY CRAP I realized that texas.one is a real website so I just fixed this
yes.
Cowboy jesus
chocolate sprinkles aka shiny rat turds
finally a relatable youtube chef. i also spent an unreasonably long amount of time trying to get the mixer attachment off when i first used a kitchenaid
Ian's hair is so fabulous, I'm really jealous.
Texturally, pudding is repulsive to me ??
another masterpiece!! Congrats on the new kitchen! I know you are a proud Texan, so this was a great video for you to do :)
I had no clue you were from Texas That's awesome! I love my state. Now I highly recommend checking out hobby lobby for more science kits. They'll definitely have some!
And the Texas Yum Yum has been entered into the Clean Plate Club.
Y'all is pretty Southern, and ain't is too. However, they both have nothing on the majesty of y'ain't.
God I love these videos so much Great editing, great humor, great long video time, great hair
You can never predict Ian. I was fully expecting some Halloween what not but instead we have a video about pies! Still great content
My wife cried when you "folded"
Hey, I have the same paddle thing! Next time I cook up something, I’ll feel like I’m on BrutalFoods in my own home!
As a texan, I approve of this video. ??
Cowboy Ian is best Ian
next time you need toffee bits and can't find any, just break up a few heath bars! might only work if what you're making already has chocolate in it but they're MUCH easier to work with than hard candy imo
This new red dead redemption is looking damn fine
PLOP
fuck y'all
You should have made fried chicken since you are in the south
Next time you need toffee, look for Heath bars. They're toffee and you can break them up
Cool. 5 ads on one video!
I simply adore these episodes.
Your hair is so long and majestic. Glad to see you are still alive though.
"yee haw" -Ian hecox 2018
I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but I think your clock needs batteries
Ian: time for me to break up the Carmel, "gets a hammer" Me: why the f*** would you use that, just use a rolling pin lol.
BrutalMoose: Oh baby Me: a triple
Clicked on this video so hard, I might have injured my finger...
l still love to think how the channel starting out was doing game reviews like caddy and now we out here makin' food, I'm really enjoying these videos and hope to see more in the future
I'm just a hotdog....yeehaw.
Am I the only person who noticed the clock behind him was 1:50 throughout the video :D
chorp
You did the folding correctly, I don't know what everyone else is talking about. The only thing you messed up on was breaking your pretzles and Oreos. You are suppose to use a frying pan.
This is my girlfriend and I's favorite show to watch together. We're gonna try making the pie!
I'd give this video 5 yum yums out of 5
Yes
Just in time for Red Dead Redemption 2
Every added blip of funny audio you edit in makes your vids 1000x better. Keep it up, E.
Your moms kitchen is pretty nice.
your hair looks so nice, beautiful, and luscious
DAMN now that's a sexy cowboy
The best way to spend a fall Sunday. Thanks for another fun food video Moose!
I think I would gag with the Texas Yum Yum. Too much whip cream.
I FOUND SQUIRREL IN THE WATER WITH A HELMET,I WILL COOK IT AND MAKE IT A SNACK
Ian your amazing at piano!
"I need a scooper thing" PROCEEDS TO USE SPATULA
This is embarrassing, but the whole time I kept getting worried he'd lose his balance and fall off the bull...
Damn, I want me some Texas Yum Yum
I got an HEB ad for their brand of ice cream. Doesn't get anymore Texan than that.
My happy place is the brutalfoods kitchen where it literally rains chocolate and it's always sprinkle time.
i was just thinking about brutalfoods the other night, glad to know i hold a psychic influence over you
THE BOY'S BACK IN TOWN
Ian, for chopping up peanuts or any kinds of almonds, just get a machine for doing that. I'm in Europe so I have no idea what they're called out in the states but this will save you a lot of time and fingers!
That is a Texas sized bag of powdered sugar.
hey im in texas do you wanna swing by grapevine and buy my insane clown posse cds
Hi! I saw some other people mention scraping down the mixing bowl to get everything mixed; but idk if anyone has mentioned that you can scrape down the bowl with the soft silicone spatula you have, it scrapes everything down and is more easy to get excess off of instead of a spoon. You sort of make a stabbing motion around the inside wall. You can also use a soft silicon spatula to stab things out of whisks instead of fingers. It's really helpful when making cookie dough/other dough to make sure everything gets incorporated. Your lazy susan thing is really cool, very glam :^)
Is it wrong to think when Ian made his entrance: “hmmmm, Ian’s awfully adept at spanking that steed. I wish I could g...” Ehhhh, you get the idea. Glad to have ya back Moosey! :)
I'm originally from Washington but have lived in Texas for twenty years. Seriously, go back to Washington.
Just subscribed and was sad that you havnt uploaded in a while, then you upload. Nice
Nice! You aren't dead. Thought you quit YT
When you realize brutalmoose was spanking himself. ._o
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks pretty good
One word.... DIABETIS
Yee (and I can not stress this enough) H A W !
Is Take 5 better than Crunc?
well, bless your heart
Please do all your videos in the future dressed like that. Thanks.
Cowboy Ian is the hero the SouthWest deserves.
You FOOL, you escaped Texas, why did you return?!
The editing is always amazing, I'm sure it must take a while to do, but it will never be unappreciated
The sprinkling was too intense for my soul.
The echoey kitchen really makes me feel like I'm in the old wild west ?? Hooray for the return of BrutalFoods and of Plop!
More brutalfoods
I’m Texan and I’m not too disappointed
The new kitchen looks a lot better on camera.
I think you did well!! Although I'm also a kitchen amateur so I have no idea what I'm doing as well :")
Puddin' without cookin'? Madness!
Good to see you're back Ian!
I missed you, Ian
When you say move back to Texas, did you buy a house or move in with your parents? That looks like your mom's kitchen.
As a fellow Texan, I'd like to give y'all a hearty yee-haw for another good video
Why do you even have this show when you clearly don't know how to cook?
Love the hair
As a Texan residing in the lovely state for nearly 2 decades I can confirm these dishes are indeed heccin Texan
One protip i have for your future chocolate melting endeavours: a double boiler To create a double boiler you add water to a saucepan, put it on a hob, and bring it to a gentle simmer. Then you put a heat-safe bowl on top and melt the chocolate in the bowl. It’s a little slower but also the chocolate has just about 0 risk of burning, and it’s easier to control if you need the chocolate at a specific temperature. Double boilers are also good for other more gentle heat-based tasks, like melting butter, mixing up some hollandaise sauce, making custards, etc.
Careful about feeding Plops. You don't want him making cow pies in the kitchen
YEEEEEEEEE HAW
I hope to see Plops return to us soon, bringing treats and recipes from across the globe...
I totally thought you were going to say I'll be dressing and talking like this from now on
My girlfriend doesn't like chocolate at all, so she would hate chocolate pudding XD
Love it! That Texas Yum Yum sure looks yum yum!
read dead 2 and a cowboy ian is making this the best weekend ever
So would you say that Cowboy Ian is a real BUCKAROO?
Thank you for the great captions!
One of the best parts of these videos is the cooking tips from the comment section
Sadly with that kitchen aid you do have to swipe the sides once in a while to help it mix everything. I think there's a part for the machine that does reach the sides though
the subtitles are funny, yet not goofy.
You’re an editing god
I lived in texas and and just moved to washington the irony
A half hour of brutalmoose to start the day? Hell yeah!
Jesus of Dallas, I love your editing!
Those bare Ian feet tho
Man the new gameplay for red dead redemption 2 looks great
I don't know anything about cooking, but this is probably my favourite series on YouTube.
The Netflix Adaptation of C.O.W-Boys Of Moo Mesa is heading in an unusual direction.
This is so trippy ?? i thought the background looked like a green screen
3 words. Yippee kay yee!
Ian you probably moved back to Texas the cheap McMansion sized houses
This editing is so great
Loving these edits so much :,D
I got way too excited when Ian rode in looking like the hippest cowboy
Why is there a Gluten free section?
Pretzels and Oreos? Yuck!
You know your eating some good desserts when you need some milk to wash it down with
I love the new cooking mechanics in Red Dead Redemption 2
So about the kitchen aid, if stuff gets stuck on the sides, just pause it, scrape it back from the sides and turn it on again, also, when microwaving chocolate or other melting thingies, its ok to do the 1 to 3 minutes, but every 30 seconds take it out and move it a bit with a spoon or alike, so the chocolates that are in the middle get moving and the ones on top/bottom/sides dont burn because of heat and pass that bad flavour to the rest of the mix
I expect more Cowboy Ian in the future
you might want to put your hair back in a ponytail while you cook or else hair might fall in your dish
Scrape the sides!
Is this that Red Dead Redemtion 2 everyone's talking about? Where do I buy??
Do you run a new kitchen factory, ian?
Plays Red Dead Redemption 2 for 5 minutes (*intro start*)
As a Texan resident I can confirm this is the only thing we ever eat
Honestly half of the fun in these videos is watching ian learn how to cook.
Not gonna lie I’m a big fan of Brutal Bull (your bull riding Texas persona) really hoping that costume gets some mileage!
A half hour, dessert themed, Brutalfoods on my birthday!? You're the best!
Finally a new video!
Looks tasty as hears Mariana sauce in the background oh god...
Would it canoblastic for Ian to eat moose?
That "Confectioners sugar" was Powdered not Confectioners.
I wonder what goes through Ian's head when he edits these videos...
I'm pretty sure "Folding" is meant to introduce as much air as possible into the frosting, making it much fluffier. To fold in an ingredient, instead of just mixing, pour your ingredient on top of the mixture, and just use a rubber bowl scraper and just scoop from the bottom and literally fold it over the new ingredient over and over. Hope this helps! Love the content man keep it up, def one of my fav creators!
Awesome new kitchen Ian!!
You mentioned Texas so I need to ask if you like Bowling for Soup
That's a cute dog.
Helpful tip! When using a stand up mixer use your rubber spatula to push the stuff that sticks to the side of the bowl back to where it can be mixed in with the rest of your mixture!
Another good vid, Ian! For what it's worth, I think when the bark called for toffee bits they probably meant something like a chorped up Heath bar.
To get material off the side in that kind of mixer you need to use a spatula to scrape things off the side intermittently while it mixes.
So I turned on the closed captioning today and didn't realize how they weren't automatically captioned. The closed captioning actually made the video even better and I totally recommend you guys give it a try if you haven't. Besides that, great video! <3
Having a kitchen aid mixer for you seems like an art student buying copic markers or something. Tools are great, but a lot of technique to learn. Love the brutal food videos.
Brilliant!
the greatest youtuber of all time is back! instant like
Real men eat pudding on a knife
Hey Moose, I recently bought this off brand slap chop for like $15 and its a lot better at breaking things up things like the toffee, since when I break up harder ingredients, the bag falls apart with it. Thought I'd share, and always good to see ya!
If I still lived in Dallas I'd be helping you out bro! Culinary degree here, give ya some pointers and such :)
You love salt, eh? :P Have you heard of NerdECrafter? XD
i have the CC on and at 3:26 that is like the farthest thing from gruff western music lol :p
I'm still watching but I keep thinking your bullfriend is going to knock something over.
Hey so is it canon that there is more than one Ian?
I want puddin' now.
Here's how to crush your nuts, for future reference; spread your nuts across a cutting board, take a small pot, and press the bottom side down on your nuts. Those nuts will be well crushed, guaranteed.
My oh my have mercy on me for givin' such a delight on the Lord's Day
I love the editing on these.
Use a cloth next time instead of a plastic bag, no risk of breaking :)
I audibly gasped when I got the notification
18:22 MANLY MUSCLES!
You actually need to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl with a spatula so everything is properly mixed. Also, to fold something in, you put some of what you want to incorporate, take a spatula, scrape against the bottom and/or side of the bowl, and literally fold it into itself to gently mix everything in. Folding is good because it introduces more air, making it lighter.
Brutalfoods Food Lab sure looks like an ideal place to hide a body...
Omg I missed Ian's videos so much
I LOVE the salt
One hell of a kitchen upgrade, Ian! Congrats!
Wow, that’s literally the exact right technique to chop nuts that you displayed.
God I really love the cooking in the new red dead game
IAN YOUR KITCHEN IS ENORMOUS
That is the correct folding method if you are using an electric mixer. Otherwise, you could fold it in by hand using a rubber spatula to stir the whipped topping in. Also, if you scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, the cream cheese won't stick to the side like that.
Ian: Remember to use a microwave safe bowl. Me, hesitant to believe that bowl he’s using is microwave safe:
In this episode: Ian moves back to Texas, shortens a few feet, and obtains a flying bull.
Hey good job with tempering that chocolate it’s hard to get a good finish when your messing with the chocolate while it’s still hot like you do with bark. Love the videos Ian
I don’t live in Texas but I live in Alberta also known as Canada’s Texas so close enough right
I say we sub title this episode: Ian Rides Again. Also now I really want to watch you play Nancy Drew Secret of Shadow Ranch.
Wow an ad luckily I'm watching it on a ps4 haha
This red dead redemption 2 gameplay looks amazing
I had a feeling it was gonna be a good Sunday!
you thought all pretzels were glutton free?! ..... dude.... pretzels are bread.... you know.... wheat
i like the new house
Based on the thumbnail I was expecting this to be a video from "Tasty"... Boy was I taken off guard by the cowboy Ian...
Put nuts in a bag, smash them with a mallet or rolling pin. Think I might make both of these ....
Howdy! your editing is amazing!
You finally uploaded
my only complaint is that he didn't dip the bark in to the texas yum yum
13:00 with that music I thought you were in Mung Daal's kitchen
These videos and black tar heroine are the only things that get me through the day
?? Yehaw! ?? These two larfin desserts left me going “Mmm! Them sucker’s tasty!” ??
* cries in hank hill *
My baby sis and I are dying from your confusion with the Kitchenaid. You look like me and my confusion with children in general.
Those are Pathetic Recipes A FRITO PIE, that's a Man's Recipe
Your gonna need to fix the audio in the kitchen. Try putting some sound damping pads behind and around the camera/microphone
Living in Texas, I honestly hate the stigma placed on it of everyone being super country.??
I missed you so much
Oh no, he stole some poor confectioner's sugar again!
Plops is best stead.
That moment of Ian holding the plug was priceless. Also, Heath bars are toffee. Get Heath.
his accent gets more texan over the video. oh no
welcome back to Texas my friend
Folding is a technique where you attempt to not burst bubbles in delicate things like whipped cream and custards. You use a spatula to scrape the bottom and "fold" it over the second ingredient so that it won't lose it's volume and fluffy texture. But you're right, I agree it's funnier if you don't know that.
Scrotch
Well, yeehaw! I reckon those treats look pretty delectable, I tell you h'what.
People: Cowboys can't be sexy! Me: Shows them cowboy Ian.. Me: I bet y'all feeling pretty stupid now!
Wow, Red Dead 2 looks even better than I imagined.
YESSSS MORE BRUTAL FOODS!
Ian, I know you have a destructive side after seeing the Werther's massacre. It hurts me to see you try to cut bark instead of just smashing it
I love the commitment to the costume bit.
Mmmm, them suckers tasty!
The editing just makes everything perfect
Omg blame it on his roots, Ian showed up in boots and came back to Texas. Bluebell, Whataburger, and HEB missed you, bro. ??
Yeah... What's So Great About Dumb Old Texas?
ENGINEER
“Mmm! them sucker’s tasty!”
"You're doing amazing sweetie" - me and my sister losing our minds at your cooking antics.
5:40 It's not that hard. 5:52 Oh...
You're ment to whisk it mate, but good try.
Ian is an unlockable character in red dead
17:24 jazz pianist ian with his hit "i have not seen such bravery"
I was so happy to wake up to this. Ian cooking is like me, clueless with good intentions
Greetings from Brazil! Seeing cowboy Ian is a shining light of hope in this dark times. Maybe I'll even try making some "YumYum... Yums".
With things that get sharp when you break them, you can also cover them with a kitchen towel to keep them from going everywhere.
Here's a helpful bit of advice: when lining your baking sheet, take a stick of butter and rub the pan down with it before you put the paper on it - this will keep the parchment paper (I prefer wax paper) from popping out as it did.
CHORP CHORP YALL
12:05 Hint at making types of Buffalo Wing Sauce?
Even though I lived in Texas my whole and I'm Hispanic, I cannot relate to these treats Yum Yum
I think this is my new favorite BrutalFoods video.
Put the peanuts in a bag or bowl and smash 'em. Just a thought. Great music and sound effects btw! =)
I always find mixing cream cheese with my kitchen aid much easier when the block of cream cheese is cut into smaller pieces. Same goes with other things like blocks of butter, it just makes mixing easy and efficient. Great video as always by the way!
Every time you do anything I'm just worried you're going to blow something up
S N A C K P A C K S is my cb radio handle
I will literally never get tired of the "plop" sound clip
as someone who knows how to bake/cook there is a lot of "omg no" moments in this video but still pretty good nice job ian
Your house is so nice!!
Who else loves brutalfoods?
OH MY A BRUTALMOOSE VIDEO, THATS NEWS !
Man they actually look good.
ian, why is your clock not working :(
For the chopping, your hand placement was good but you need to roll the knife from end to end of the blade edge over the nuts instead of bringing it down on them. :) Edit - Also, you should chill the Texas yum yum to get the pudding and other layers to be more solid when you cut and serve.
I can't decide if a KitchenAid stand mixer is 1.) wasted on Ian, or is 2.) the only mixer capable of standing up to his abuse.
I'm under the impression this video was fun to make. lol
Ian "we're getting some stray confectioners sugar in here..." me: crying you're supposed to scrape the sides xD
We don’t deserve the amount of effort you put into these but we sure appreciate it!
Finally another brutalmoose videooooooooooo! I've been fucking waiting forever! Yesssssssssss#
I giggled as the "plop" caught me off guard.
How dare yee make funs of our home land
if u love old stuff so much then do a recipe from the first cookbook ever written by Apicicus
For the duration of this entire video, my thought process was "gee, I'm hungry. But I need to finish the video before I get lunch. Gee, I'm hungry."
your gorgeous hair has been distracting me the entire video. seriously what magic do you use in order for it to be so fluffy and shiny?
Ian makes such awkward cowboy. I love it!??
I love the theme
Boy howdy, I just hit some black gold, Texas tea.
Ian? not in an apartment kitchen? who IS this IMPOSTOR?
Yo take five is the BEST! Also please make Plops a series regular
Nice Red Dead Redemption 2 review
This video just made me want chocolate.
You actually wanted the paddle for the cream cheese step Paddle for beating, whisk for whipping.
2.57, looks like a bag of coke.
Ian criminally underuses his rubber spatula
its a bull, not a horse just saying.....
Your editing gets better and better with every video Ian. The music, the transitions, the splicing, the sound fx, the lighting, all that hard work you put into these videos SHOWS. Excellent job!
0/10 folding, it wasnt folding. Folding is basicly barely-mixing stuff in so its kinda combined but without much force used
hype as fuck for this ep
At mid intro: let's get married.
30 MEN IN MY FREEZER
Texxxxxas yeeeeees
Cruel Deer is back!!
Finally! A new Brutalmoose for me!
For a minute there I thought you'd had to move back in with your parents. And then you opened the fridge door at 2:22. I stand corrected.
Next brutal foods do super Texan beef recipes or tex mex.... But beef... RIP PLOPS
To fold a mixture, take a spatula or wooden spoon and slide it to the bottom of the mixing bowl. Try to scoop one end of the mixture over the other, like you're folding it in half. Repeat until your mixture is well incorporated.
Aw, no Killjoy 2 review for Halloween? Also, 2/10 folding in score- illegal use of mixer. Would be 0 but I appreciate the effort.
plop intensifies
One day Ian will run out of characters to play Oh who am I kidding?
Ian, remember I loved you before you had money
Read Dead Redemption 2 DLC gameplay (REAL) (COOKING) (GONE SEXUAL)
You live in Dallas? I live in Houston.
You get an F for Folding.
@16:28 Shoulda used a food processor Ian, woulda made it much easier
Texas Yum Yum sounds like a “special” massage.
Yeah, cool whip and cream cheese is basically the filling for a cheesecake, totally should have used thawed cool whip.
In the middle of a water fast and deputy moose came in to torture me.
Jesus Christ, Ian. This is amazing. ??
man, i'm a bad texan for neither having heard of or tasted texas yum yum in my 24 years of life
Moose, here's some good tips for knowing what type of attachment to use for your stand mixer!!: -The Whip attachment is best things that are more of a liquid consistency or for when you need to add air into something when it's mixing, such as with whipped cream. A lot of batters use the whip attachment. -The paddle is good for things that are thicker, such as frostings, or as you have here, softening things like cream cheese, butter, etc. Basically, if something would be REALLY REALLY difficult and annoying to get out of the holes on the whip attachment, go with the paddle. -The hook (which idk if you have) is for doughs, though some less dense doughs can be made using a paddle.
I wonder what kind of bottle that he always has is called.....
You folded wrong. Check one of 15000 videos or wiki How's. Basically, scrape around the outside of the bowl and do a kind 9f figure 8
the stars and stripes are big and bright
I fully expect you to have diabetes by the end of this
screams in triggered baker Cries in YEEHAWWWW
this has made my day, thank you ian :)
I've not seen such bravery
10 seconds in and this video is already outstanding. That first recipe looked so good! I think I'll try it sometime! I cant say this enough, I absolutely love your editing! :D
Red Dead Redemption 2 looks amazing
YES NEW BRUTALFOODS THANK YOU GOD
Is that footage of Dallas, Texas I see?
i am from thailand
Plops is displeased with your offering! ??
YEEEEEEEHAAAAAAWWW
Wow Ian... Didn't know you were from Texas... So am I... Ian from Texas...
you mixed it not folded it but sure. you do u papi moose
tell plops i'd die for him
answering ian's question and some tips - Scrape the sides of the mixers bowl with a spatula, so it all mixes homogeneously - You did not fold correctly, but i don't think it mattered for the recipe - Instead of cutting peanuts with a knife, crush them with a mortar and pestle, or put them inside a zip-lock bag and crush them with a hammer
I love you and hella missed you bud where you been?
0:33 Red Dead Redemption 2 early leaked footage (colorized)
What are you used to cream cheese to look like? In a container?
M8 if you want to fold something you gotta actually fold in with a spoon
NEW VIDEO!
ian i believe folding is usually meant to be done manually, perhaps with a rubber spatula
you can just use like a spatula or spoon or something to scrape down the sides every now and then to ensure maximum mixage.
You were in Washington this whole time
Can you pin this for miniscule reasons?
This editing brings me great joy. I love your work so much, Ian <3
You have to fold things in by hand with a spatula. It literally means fold the mixture over itself until it is just combined. Over mixing ruins the texture.
Man, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks amazing
dear god ian stop mixing things with a whisk you don't know what you're doing
Critical-ingredient-free is a crime.
Ian, with the mixer, you should've left the whisk head on and used a spatula like the one you used for the chocolate pudding to push out the cream cheese. Along with that, you should've pushed everything on the sides to the bottom so they could be incorportated. Also, folding in means you would take a spatula, put the whipped topping in, and gently fold the sides on top of the of the whipped topping. When you make a machine do it like you did, you're taking the air out of the mixture instead of letting the air be retained.
Everything’s bigger in Texas...even the kitchens!
With the mixer you're supposed to take a floppy spatula and push the sides down as it's mixing! :)
I had texas yum yum when i was in girl scouts many years ago, and it was amazing. I fell in love. I never found it anywhere else UNTIL NOW
Still effed up the folding part
It seems no one is saying it, that’s not folding
#peoplegettingreallymadatfood
'beat the cream cheese' Ian: ???whisk???
KKona Clap
It's the heart-attack tart
Thank you. Its good to focus on something else when stuff is going on in life. Keep it up Ian
SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOF TOPS
I'm not gonna lie, I initially did not like the format change. But now I want this on the Food Network
You did not fold in correctly, good guess though.
hell yes the moose is back!
“30 men in my freezer.” Umm... Ian...? Are you trying to confess something to us? lol
When using a stand mixer, ocassionally turn it off and use a spoon to scrape the sides down into the center.
Back in texas we call ice cream frozen cow juice
Y’all
Crushing the old man with the bowl really got me lmao
30 minute video 15 of it is spent fiddling with the mixer. UPDATE: The last 15 is spent in the Missing Sea Salt Chronicles
Wow! These graphics for Red Dead Redemption 2 are amazingly realistic!
CALL MOM FOR HELP
Ian, use a hair tie next time. You don't want your hair in your food.
Man... I envy that kitchen aid. Dems expensive
Guess who’s back, back again! Ian’s back, tell a friend!
[TRIUMPHANT WESTERN MUSIC]
Dang, Brutalfoods Kitchen 3.0 is MASSIVE, happy for ya Ian!
don't mess with Texas! I love this tho Bc I'm from Texas bahah
So excited that you're back ????
Ian, your videos are honestly amazing. Love watching them!
I hate chocolate pudding!!
yee (and I can not stress this enough) H A W
OH GAWD I WANNA BRAID IAN'S HAIR ??
New kitchen hype! I'll forever miss the old kitchen, but I'm interested in what this new kitchen will bring to the table.
Real cowboys only wear white socks
As someone that owns and uses a kitchen aid mixer literally every day, his struggle is painful to watch.
Who in the god damn tarnation disliked this video?
OMG I've been binging all your brutal food vids this week and there is a NEW ONE EYYY!
I live for your edits, Ian.
I like vertically split fridges more than horizontally split fridges
This is the only food related stuff that i follow on youtube.
Instead of a hammer, you can use a wooden spoon to beat the shit out of it instead ??
So if kitchen were Pokemon would this be the final form?
Good Texas fun...lmao
Is it bad that I forgot this channel existed?
How many times this mother fucker gonna move house?
Gotta say that’s the biggest thing of milk I’ve ever seen What in tarnation
Like if y'all from Texas
Why are you doing childrens programs, all of a sudden? Why has your focus shifted to "Bad Sesame Street"? Who IS your focus group? Tweens? Why are you making yourself look more stupid than you are? And why the fuck, are you trying out "ready made meals", when there is already 400+ people doing that? What happened to the games? Have you stopped playing? Did you find that making videos of games, was too boring? I am clearly not in your agegroup with these videos. Say goodbye, to your mature audience, and make sure you welcome the new ones. You know, those 12 year olds, that think you do something funny. It is not often you see a you-tuber, trying to switch out, his whole fan base for something younger... Oh, wait hang on, you see this all the time... Congratulations! You are now an extended after school service provider.. You must be proud, disowning your whole fanbase, in order for a new, more younger one... Hats off. You are just another asshole, trying to look after his "assets", without realising that you spit on your patreons and trusty followers. Great job. You are doing good. And you wonder why your channel is in decline? Why would a retro gamer, want to subscribe to a food channel of a retro gamer? Are you sick? Having a fever? Think Mcfly, think!
wowowowowoweeeee thanks
yeehaw! howdy?! (translation for all y'all city slickers: hello! how do you fare?)
Howdy boah
Last time i watch brutalmoose is in 1785
I went from listening to southern gothic to watching this.
Are you back in mom's house?
Is his horse plops a reference to Bob's Burgers or to himself?
I want Ian to tackle bread making
Yes. At last. Howdy-do.
I miss the can of Pringles on the fridge :(
Shout out to my boy Plops
I'll eat you for dessert IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
My mom thinks you are hilarious.
Nooooo I did not wake early enough to comment first!
I'm not clever enough to think of a funny joke referencing the video but BOOOOOOOOOWL
I really love these videos, keep up the awesome work Ian! ...and only because you asked, no, no that is not how you fold ingredients... also "heath bars" would have been a good toffee substitute.
I like the daily wear, Ian, but what are you going to be for Halloween?
You live in Dallas the most shat on city in Texas
red dead redemption 2 looks really good
Bless you Ian, keep doing what you do
Texas pies are TALL lol like they defy gravity so this is pretty correct actually
I trust one (1) man and that man is cowboy Ian and his trusty steed
The cycle is complete. Since January of 2013, I have waited for the return. We have seen whispers of it, but time after time, haircut after haircut, we have been japed and jostled. But no more. For we have finally done it. We have finally achieved... FULL LONG HAIR IAN ONCE MORE!
Keep Austin Weird, Ian!
W h y
Wait... Ian's from Texas???
PLOPS. I'M SCREAMING.
Look out Babish! Ian is going after your views >:3c
Good to hear a Texan is back home. Fort Worth represent.
The perfect thing to watch instead of starting my homework
You don't use the mixer to fold, folding is done to make sure the air that is incorporated into whipped cream and suvh isn't pushed out. You fold by literally folding the cream/egg whites into the mixture with your spatula.
I get genuinely excited when I see a notification for a new video from Ian
Thank god notifications for this channel still work
So glad it’s a 33 minutes video about pudding pops god bless you Ian god bless you
I’m supposed to be studying for a test tomorrow, but here I am.
Thank you Cowboy Ian. Very cool!
Yes more recipies!
Needs more ramen
As, a proper southern boy, who loves to cook, this entire video is offensive + all the puns included.
Yum yum!
This is so wack that you posted a food review video, I just subscribed to you last night because I found your lunchables review! Keep up them fine 'ol videos boy! Yeeeee-haw!
Woo Texas peeps, Where y’all at? Houston over here!
When the intro started I was thinking "now that's a Texas-sized kitchen" And then Ian said "I moved back to Texas" lol
Red dead 2 looks amazing
Tasty Texas Treats to Try This Thanksgiving That happens to land on a Thursday
i really like this change of videos
what a great birthday present. love ya texas ian
Change your channel name to BrutalBison
Why does Cowboy Ian have Dwarfism?
Literally having to restrain myself from not laughing so hard I die, this is gonna be fun
He's back, just as the prodigies said.
When they say folding they meant that you place the whipped topping on top of the confectionary sugar and cream cheese mix. Then with a spatula you fold the confectionary sugar and cream cheese mix over the whipped topping. This process is done so you can keep the fluffly lightness that the whip topping has, aswell as help the mixture hold its shape. Fokding would make the mixture almost spongey like. Although with this recipe I don't think it really matters. Anyways I love your videos! Tysm for making them ?? Also good luck in any other cooking/baking endeavors
Yesss a new vid
I like how this has just become a cooking channel now
Really good pacing in this show! New characters every video. Wonder how Ian is doing.
I ain't from Texas but this episode seems genuine
https://www.taste.com.au/baking/articles/how-to-fold-ingredients/bfczqmgw
I need smell-o-vision now for this video
You live in Texas and don’t shop at HEB?, this is a Disgrace for the Lone Star State
When folding you should have your rubber spatula and just lift and place until it's homogeneous. When you use the mixer your starting to over work your ingredients and changing the texture. But all that said it doesn't really matter so great job.
How did you know I was just binge watching the cooking videos and realised that no new videos were uploaded?
Yesterday we had Chad and Hammy and now we have Ian This is great
Is it me or does Ian look like Shawn Michaels
I love this halloween video.
Where did Little Ian go
i miss video games
Ian! im gonna Cum!
Ian you basically did the opposite of folding.
33 minutes and 52 seconds of my favorite series. #blessed
you and Brandi TV are the only wholesome youtube channels in existence. This video is amazing
Congratulations on the move, commiserations on the continued failure of your folding technique.
Also appropriate because Red Dead 2 is Finally Here!!! GG Ian
THE PERFECT HALLOWEEN VIDEO!!!!!!
Wow, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks really good!
I found myself hoping for a new BrutalFoods episode yesterday. Rewatched the Ramen episode.
yay. texas represent
It's been 1 month >:C
Yeehaw y'all
Welcome back to Texas! Glad to have ya here.
Probably the most diverse channel on YouTube at this point
Represent that State of Texas, BABY!! ????
I’m not sure if that was correct folding but you know what? I don’t think it mattered, frankly.
Half hour Brutal Foods. LETS DO THIS
I bet Ian a year and a half ago thought that this whole Brutalfoods thing was a funny one-off meme. Look at it now, it pretty much changed his whole channel and brought in so many new people; myself included
I've always wanted to go to Texas
It's BrutalFoods time once again ????
Just this morning I was wondering when there would be another brutal video. Right on time for dinner, too.
welcome back to hell
4:27 plop! ??
I got so excited when I saw this in my subscription feed! I love your videos! :)
Ian you make such great content. Please keep being awesome, and welcome back to Texas!!
Ian. I know you gettin those views, but you gotta stop with the brutal foods. I’m getting bored.
As the one in my house who uses the kitchen aid mixer the most, the part where you were trying to figure it out was both funny and painful (painful becuase i could be like "psst, Ian, push it up and then twist it"and such)??
oh boi
Scrape edges with Spatula then mix with machine again....easy :)
Hey first yee then haww
Grrrr Texas..... But this was pretty good
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
Why does this new kitchen look like the old kitchen but from a different angle
Cowboy Ian is my favourite character from Red Dead Redemption 2.
Fantastic! This pie looks like a better then sex cake also know as a sin cake. These are super Yum! Wishing you an amazing day dear friend x)
Best halloween ever, a new episode of brutalfoods and plenty of cakes to bake.
LOOK AT THAT KITCHEN
Oh yes! brutalmoose!
Yay! A moosical!
Yeehaw indeed
vote for beto ian
Ian must've sensed I was having a shit day, cuz a brutalfoods episode is just what I need lol By the way, just some friendly advice on how to fold things in from a fellow cook, use the rubber spatula to kind of lift the mixture up and cover the whipped topping with it, keep lifting and covering until it's mixed in :)
P L O P
I can’t decide whether I love or resent your content but either way I’m enjoying myself.
Hmm! Them Sucker's Tasty!
I love you Ian, I was just saying I wish you'd upload and you do
yee haw
I'm uh... I'm gonna pre, dude.
perfection
Think all that weird food has stumped your growth there buddy.
Everything is bigger in Texas
cowboy ian has some short legs
Trusty steed? I think you meant trusty steer. Regardless, it's always a treat to see more BrutalFoods, y'all...
yee haw
blessed
Texas yim yum
I have to unsub. Moose was once all about quality game and then movie reviews, and now he's just doing food stuff and less scripted reviews in general.
As a Texan I approve of this
Thanks dad
It’s so crazy to me when I find out that certain youtubers are from Texas cuz like.... I’m from Texas, I’m in Texas. That’s wild. Yeehaw indeed.
Good stuff
cowboy ian is gorgeous
So when are you actually going to change the channel's name to "brutalfoods"?
The perfect video for a Sunday morning in Alberta, which I’ve been told is the Texas of Canada
The hair is out of control lmao
as someone from Texas... ouch. you don't have to put so much emphasis on the howdy and y'all cmon Ian also ain't is just a word, no need to over do it
Red Dead 2 looks great.
I love you, Brutalmoose! ??????????????????
I’m low key hungry now and my parents have not shopped for groceries in weeks.
Wait, this isn't a rdr2 review?
Return of the PLOP!
Yeehaw, a new BrutalFoods! And a tasty, uhhhh, root-tootin' episode it is! EDIT: ~? S P R I N K L E T I M E ?~
YES
Man, Red Dead Redemption 2 looks so realistic.
Looking forward to a great video, BrutalMoose
Today on Brutalmoose: Ian makes pie til the cows come home.
Welcome back to Texas! Yee....haw?

OMG THIS NOTIF MADE ME CRY I LOVE THIS CHANNEL, THIS EDITING IS MY LIFE, NOTICE ME, SENPAI!
Good job on the new apartment Ian. I'm sure Tiny Ian paid some of the rent
Half an hour of video, four advertisement-blocks, I am satisfied.
The new place looks great! Hope you like it there Ian! Edit: Those look soooooo good
You better be cooking these with propane!
Brutal gets his video ideas from a random hat drawing
Mm them suckers tasty ??
Oh, freakin’ yeehaw brother
You don't have to be lonely, at farmersonly.com
Texan viewers, where y'all at?
They always say yeehaw but never ask haw yee
Fuck yeah! Just what I needed today a BrutalMoose vidyo!
Ye haw
There he is.
...O_O... dear God no..... 1:34
Bless you, Ian. These reviews/cooking demonstrations mixed with your comedy give me life ?? Please keep doing you, ‘partner’. Yee-haw!
TexasMoose
Who's watching this in 2016?
RDR2 looking good ngl
Oh heck yeah!!! BRUTALFOODS <3 Omgosh stop abusing that poor mixer. T.T Edit- You can save time with chopping peanuts and almonds by putting them between a couple of layers of paper towel and using a heavy skillet to crush them. :)
Yes! Another one! I’m so excited!
Ah Texas the America of mexico
You know this started as a pretty boring Sunday but Ian's video just made it better.
Texas. Full of Texassholes. Texas; stupid, poor, sick, Texas sucks dick.
I was literally just rewatching Brutal Foods, love ya Ian.
yeehaw bitch
Amazing
Brutalmoose can you be the yee to my haw?
imma texan, y'all
Oh Gosh the choice between you and the Eagles.....Imma pick you.
Witty & Interesting Social Commentary Regarding Texas
Howdy howdy
HELL YES AN UPLOAD BOYS
He got a new apartment. That's so awesome. Good job Ian.
Yeeh haw another round house kicken' video from my best pal cowboy Ian! Yal best be ready....
Smelly dog
You know the episode will be incredible after such intro.
I love you
im gonna Cum!
Brutalmoose’s channel is going through a midlife crisis. It doesn’t know what it wants to be lol
I just entered the video and Cowboy Ian already scares me
Hello lloooloooowefverfvetgherdcwdg
Whoever says cowboys aren’t sexy, I bet you feel stupid right now.
That was an odd intro...
10 seconds in and it's already going strong
17 seconds in and I'm already laughing my ass off
I came here at 18 views lol
“Mmm! Them suckers tasty!!” There you go moose man
Yeah, sure why not?
As a Texan, these better be marginally Texas-themed. Only marginally.
What a wonderful start to my morning
As soon as Cowboy Ian galloped in, I knew this was gonna be good.
Mmm... Desert.
What a fantastic treat for this gloomy sunday!
Good shit, daddy-o. This was straight up cash money
YESSS DAY=MADE
I wish I was that bull
Now for a greatly edited video for us to watch
Who are you and why I subbed you
dude i live for your videos
Hey I’m here and it’s 16 views and unlisted! Yo I’m early for once!!
Y E E H A W
Yessss he’s back!
Neigh.
Yay new brutalmoose!
Third
Early gang
Unlisted squad
Yesssss!!!! Finally!
thank god
Farst
Lets go brutal moose this is my favorite channel
She sounds like she has a cold or menstral cramps. I love the idea but don’t overwork your stars.
I want to try that ice cream
Is it me or does she give off a Kerry Washington vibe
Did Vikings have ice cream?
She sounds a bit like louise from bobs burgers
The most amazing thing about this is how the video ended up No.11 Trending. This girl seems pretty clueless and barely follows the recipes. Every other comment seems to love the video and the presenter so I guess I'm just a grouch, IDK?!
what music/song is this?
It said to boyle, boil, it.
That was the most beautiful ice cream maker Ive ever seen. Your voice, you beautiful face and hair. Wow!!
IM SUBBING TO WHOEVER LIKES THIS AND SUBSCRIBES TO ME????????????
Says they’re following a 350 year old recipe and immediately disregards the recipe...??
Man I don't think I've watched a tasty video this calm
Man Kiano's pretty ??
"This is definitely . . . a flavor." Great line!
Lol she added WAY too much of that orange “aromatherapy” ??
Taste test at 5:07
Wow the 2018 version of making ice cream
Sweetheart, 350 years ago you would have been a slave, not eating ice cream
We were watching the titanic during this
I like her! Keep using her!
i t i s a f l a v o r
i wonder howmany recepies from the past are lost and rediscovered in kitchen
I absolutely LOVE your voice!
SHE'S PRETTY!!
They still make this where I'm from
The title is nonsense.
You guys should do more of these. I love historical cooking stuff.
U so cute be mine if u can ??????
Well, ??
Unintentional ASMR
i think it's sad and pathetic how lazy america has gotten over the past 5 generations including myself, in today's generation we call people to up to deliver are food and i'm not saying there's something wrong with that but if your calling romeo's pizza, chicken wings, papa john's pizza, pizza hut, or calling people up to deliver your grunola candy bars and potato chips pumpkin pie chicken fry don't you try to lie because i can see it in your eye then roger we have a problem
Wouldn’t be melted by then?
You do realize that using a 350 year old recipe doesn't make your final product 350 years old, right?
I just clicked cause she is hot
Ice cream recipe she added a ton more of spices per her liking? Doesnt make sense or hold true to the original recipe.
There’s a third recipe which calls for ambergris!
so they have ice already in the 17th century?
My dads getting me McDonald’s rn
MMMMMM I know something looks creamy and it's not the ice cream. You sexy lady.
New favorite tasty producer???
She looks like the Scandal actress ??
Ok the ice crem is good but.. no ones is gonna mention how FINE AND CUTE IS MATT ?????? like helloooo ???
Lol... Not true the story is fake
What people haven't been around that long.
Amazing recipe and more healthy .
3:15 her reaction is awesome??
She is hella damn fine.
Just because I am too lazy to try it myself, you guys should try making very old candy recipes. Example: Molasses candy from around the Civil War :)
Bogus. You didn't actually follow that recipe..
I only clicked for the beautiful black woman stayed for the surprisingly interesting video.
Yay more kianooooo!!
Next video:We tried making quality content.
I thought the ice cream was 350 years old
she added a lot of orange flower water so it went down hill from there so be cautious with the flavors you use
who else thought the ice cream was 350 years old but then read the title and was like oh ??
Roses are red, violets are blue, this is on trending, wtf YouTube!
She is adorable!! I could watch her try food for hours..
She pretty much changed the recipe right off the bat ?????
1:30 this is how you know this is a Tasty video
?????????????????????????
Lol that 3 hours felt like 350 years of work
Love your videos! My fiancé and I also make videos!
T H E B R O A R M Y N E E D S Y O U ! Enlist by subscribing to PewDiePie! Help us win against the tyranny of T-series!
Yes! More vintage and old recipes videos pls!!! Really curious about how food in the past tasted like.
Man, there is something about her...
It was supposed to be mixed occasionally. That helps with even cooling.
I want to try this but then I’m scared that I’m going to mess up my kitchen...
Malk
Click bait kinda
Kinao. goddamn.lord help me
Her skin is so beautiful it’s glowing ??
dies of polio
I have a question though...How did they get ice if there's no refrigeration?
Please stick with people who could follow recipes, as well as cook.. ????????????
?? you’re not following the recipe.. you’re making your own with her ingredients. so much for following the recipe, maybe that’s why didn’t turn out. maybe that’s why the title says (tried to) but she didn’t try! at all.. you just ran with it because why?? yes we all know..

Get a life stop thinking ppl are idiots..... Those ingredients ... Give me a break....lucky they had freezers lol. When did they had vanilla. Haha cmon. Get a life....don't pretend u can cook !!!!
What a beautiful host??
You sound like a dumb bitch
Each like I will add an ice cream ??
I actually like making food from scratch and enjoyed this video and history...
Who else felt that in their ear 4:13
Did anyone crave ice cream after this.
I’m so stupid. I actually thought the ice cream was really 350 years old... slaps neck
You see that Brit.. My Blade Of Mace was better than your cream of orange poop.
10 mill subs and i dont even know of it
Who thought the title said "350 year old lady trys ice cream"
Where she found ice from? 350 years ago **no freezers**
Time and money equals interesting video experiment maybe I'll try it??????
Directions unclear, Anal bleeding won't stop.
Where did they get the recipe from ?
“It’s nasty” lol
?? ?? ???? ?? ??a? ??? ?a? a ?a?? fa¢???
Kiano fine asl. ??
I love Kiano's voice.
If they didn't have a fridge how did they make the ice for ice cream to 'chill'
I thought the ingredients were three hundred and fifty years old
Yum
Omg
Kiano rocks! Natural, funny and accessible. 5:36-5:48 was a pretty funny reaction.
i could listen to her talk all day long, her voice is so calming ?
Love it
You sir or ma'am just earned yourself a new subscriber
I really like Kiano and I really love the idea of trying old recipes. Would love more!
I LOVE HER
Does it piss anyone off how she said 17th century so about 1650 then yhe producer said 16th so 1550 and then in the title its 350 2000-300= 1700 1700-50 1650? So it it 1650 or 1550 or are the editor's stupid
Another quarter cup will never hurt. ... In most situations
Stretchy ice cream next!
How could you name it a 350-years-old ice cream when you just need 6 minutes and 34 seconds to serve it? jk
her personality is so calm and non-buzzfeed i am Shocked
No refrigerator... but has Ice?
I was misleaded by the title
Make 350 year old whiskey or wine and Ill be impressed..
Slave labor also degraded over the years.
You didn't follow the recipe.
Wow
I love me some BlAcK ChOcoLatE
is she coping Inda?
I'm tempted about that blade of mace ice cream wow looks tasty
When she said that there is no refrigerator was used I was a little confused when she also said ice. I thought when you make ice you use a refrigirator
Tries to make ice cream from old recipe. Immediately changes recipe with first ingredient

she sounds like scarlett johanson
More old recipes please. This is so fascinating.
Orange flower water tastes good in small quantities and if you take it more it tastes like soap...... It should be carefully handled
It would have been less icy if you churned a few times during the hours it was freezing. Just mix it up so that it freezes more evenly and with smaller crystals for a smoother texture. I've made ice cream without a machine, just with two mixing bowls, salt, ice, a whisk, and a freezer. I know people like ice cream in the summer, but if you had only primitive means it would be very easy to make ice cream outdoors during winter in a very cold place. If I lived in the arctic I would definitely try it and it might be better than a cheap ice cream machine if the temperature is low enough. At -40° you probably just need to whisk the chilled ice cream base in a bowl for a few minutes at the most and you have excellent really smooth and creamy ice cream, not icy at all. Then you warm up indoors and when you're warm and toasty you fetch the ice cream just outside (or in the freezer) and enjoy it.
Yum ??
Am I the only one who thinks she’s sexy
Lmao. "It is differently a flavor".
SHE. SO. CUTE
If there is no refrigerator, how can they make ice??
"We tried to make a 350 year old ice cream recipe" wouldn't it be better to phrase it more like for example "we tried to make ice cream using a 350 year old recipe" or "we tried to make 350 year old ice cream" ?
Why did you put “attempted” and “tried” because you wouldn’t have a video if you didn’t accomplish it
no one died in the west during the production of this ice cream......
so mr burns is older than 350 years.....sides maybe being satan LOL
The whole time she kept gradually adding more and more orange flower water I was yelling 'Nooo dont do it you will regret it!' That stuff is deceptively strong the longer its in something the flavor will penetrate. That shit needs to be used sparingly.
Entertaining I enjoyed this...
Can't help fallin in love with Kiano
Lightweight
Subscribe to Pewdiepie, guys let's do it!
There was white sugar in 1600’s ?
Her great great great great aunts probably prepared that ice cream for countless generation of white people....still using niggas to prepare it. What’s a shame. It’s ok my cousins are still Beheading each other back home
Ooohhh?? I'm pretty sure Patrick Star wants this IICEE CREEAAMMM!! ??????
it's true? ice cream recipi are 350 year old.
Wait if there were no refrigerators back then, how would they even have ice ??
A 350-year-old recipe and a 350-year-old ice-cream (which is what the thumbnail showed) are two different things.
Where did people from 1650 get ice from hahaha
Please make a mordern version of both of these ice creams! Kiano you're so cute!
THANK GOD FOR ICE CREAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMM!!!! :D
Not sure who this lady is, but if she doesn't know orange blossom extract she can't be much of a cook. It is very common in Middle Eastern cusine and also in Western confectionery. It is true the recipes of those days were not too precise for our present standards, but when the recipe does give instructions (as in the ammount of mace blade) she "knows better". Very annoying video.
She cute
So how did they make ice in the 1600's ?
The real oldest ice cream is when our ancestors spilled milk cream and sugar into ice on the floor
Do an old Cake recipe next
Why you are so cute!
no, its not what the taste like.. u already changed it in the early of the video
i love her voice its so calm??
HowToBasic's Classic Recipe Gone Wrong
The 1660s IS THE 17TH CENTURY no * needed.
I didn't know ice cream was even available back then! This is wild ??
More of her please!
I see people making recipes and opening beverages from the past, but why noone does the same for the future? I want you to make stake a-la Mars and open a wine bottle from 2630
Another way to make a 350 y.o ice cream: Step:1 make ice cream Step:2 leave it for 350 years boom 350 y.o ice cream
Please attempt other old recipes so fun
Bitch didn’t even follow the recipe fully
I would try to get some orange flavoring or extract instead of the orange flower water.
"It is definitely...a flavor..."
Ok. Did you know that making ice creams in the old days have no measuring they just. Boom bam boom just PUT ALL OF IT.
pretty black woman always helps with food porn lol! :D
I'm here from trending videos on YouTube
Ha! Never knew it's called 'mace'. It tastes super good when being sweetened. Spicy almost chili, plus crunchy.
I think the orange flower water recipe would taste good if she followed the right measurements for the recipe..
Where did they get the ice from? 350 years ago
????????????
she burned the spoon
You didn’t make the recipe.
the years make no sense
This looks so amazing and so much fun. Curious about how it taste
#13 on trending! Congrats!
Are you guys going to continue making old recipe's video?
You are very beautiful
You put too much orange flower water
I can't say that this would hold up to modern standards. WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE POURED A MOTHER FUCKING SHIT TON OF THE ORANGE WATER
I'm wondering how they made ice back then.
If there were no freezers back in the 17th Century, how do they make Ice for the ice creams? Do they export them from Antarctica
I love the way this producer explains everything and makes such good educated guesses and is good at problem solving. I want to make this mace ice cream, but with almond or soy milk!
Hate to say it.. But due to breeding and genetics and general improvements to agriculture. Chances are this taste nothing like it did back then. Kind of like how chickens back then were drastically different. That said it's cool you found such an old recipe.
Fun fact: Salt does not lower waters freezing point, it changes the chemical from H2O to H2O with NaCl or saltwater which is what has a lower freezing point, not lowering the freezing point of water
X for doubt
Okay so you learn something new every day. I was sure ice cream, wasn't a thing until the like 30s or something. How did they even make ice in the 1600s is what I want to know.
who else thought the ice cream was 350 years.... just me okay
It’s probably because you used so much of that orange rose water. As the saying goes, “A little goes a long way.”
how the hell did she find this recipe?
i like her
if they didn’t have refrigerators in the 1600s how did they make ice, from snow?
She has a little bit of that Miley Cyrus raspiness in her voice.
They should’ve waited 6 more tears to make this video
She sounds exactly like IVANKA TRUMP...same voice.
The nut meg
I read this wrong and thought she ate 350 year old ice cream
No se si el helado está rico pero...que hermosa por dios!!!!
Check me out https://youtu.be/tcMAvxbsJ3M
I'm so stupid - I almost thought the ice cream was literally 350 years old;;;
She looks tasty.
Check it out! Prep! https://youtu.be/Q7yMo9Qfaig
I love her ??
mmmmm tasty 'cough cough'
I would love to read recipes from way back in the day with the beautiful hand written notes. I love all those pretty food blogs but there is just something special about someone writing recipes and scribbling things out after they revise it. ??
Marry me

I want to see jayden play fortnite btw great vid
*Recipe calls for 1 blade of mace. Woman uses 4 instead. * Don't tell me you're following a recipe when you're not!!!!
(Scratching my head) she said less is more with adding sugar but went in on the orange water smh ????? duh ?? it’s going to taste nasty.
This is excellent! I could watch endless videos with Kiano making recipes!!!
Who do you know how a bar of soap taste like ???
Wow..... We Can't Believe It That Old Recipes Ice Cream Was Back To Era 2010's Even Not Too Popular
To truly recreate it you would have had to use raw milk straight out the cow no processing but it was so cool video
Salt raises waters freezing point. It doesn’t lower it...
My finger was really close to the like button so I clicked it
Orange flower water ice cream should be called bar of soap ice cream
Whoever that invented the ice cream... is a KING. Here to express my love for ice cream: - My username. - I did a speech on ice cream in 8th grade English. - I eat ice cream cake every year on my birthday. - There's always a box of ice cream in the fridge. - Every time we play Kahoot (online game), my username would be IceCream777. I love you King Tang of Shang (creator of ice cream)
Awesome
"it feels cold but it's just sitting there" what does she think happens in a freezer??
Please try doing more old recipes!
If there was no refigerators back then, HOW DID THEY GET ICE?
8
Kiano omg ??
Kiano is so cute
5:39 OwO
Was there any ice cream 350 year ago
You should make the ice move or shake your bucket ,thats make the ice cream fast freeze, thats how my country make traditional ice cream , you should put a lot of salt and shake it. Believe me
Shes cute... People in tasty always this cute?
So there were no refrigerators back then right...so where did they source their ice...from glaciers?
So I first thought the I itself was 150 years old and then I realized they meant the recipe
Voice doesn't match her body
Make this a series!!
A taste of Vanilla extract alone is more delicious than a taste of cheap tequila.
I love butterscotch nd chocobar one of my favorite ice cream
"its definitely......... a flavor" LMAO
I want more videos made by this beautiful melanin women
I'm 300,769th!
I love violet blueberry flavored ice cream and rose strawberry ?? floral is an acquired taste ?? but then so is perfume
Interesting...I like the way you made commentary about the ice cream as you were making it!
OMG I DID THIS IN 3rd IM IN 4th NOW I MADE A RECIPE FROM THE 17th CENTERURAY!!!111
How do they make ice in the 1660s?
So beautiful ??
Mace is to me what makes pound cake taste like pound cake. My mom's recipe uses ground mace and vanilla. Yum
This is just a copy of ‘How to cook that’
Am I the only one who thought this said "We Tried 350-Year-Old Ice Cream"?
Ice cream are not innovated since 350 years ago,so fuck off beach
This should be a series,old recipes
if 1600's peoples watch this, they would be like "THATS NOT HOW YOU MAKE THATTT"
What’s the point if you’re not even going to follow the correct recipe?
Kiano is so chill
why does she remind me of dojo cat
I feel like it really isn’t trying the recipe since she added more blade of mace then what you should add.
Nice
i love her
She cute
you did not even follow the recipe from the very start.
Did they have freezers back then? Cos how would they make the ice?
i love love love kiano! more please <3
Why isn't Rie in this video?????? This is bullshit.
This was so cool! I would love to see more videos of recreating old recipes!
Sweet
We did this is intermediate when I was little, but we had a bag with ice and salt and we put the ice cream mixture in a smaller bag then we sealed the bag and put that bag in the ice bag shook the ice bag and around 10 minutes later we had ice cream
Why did she use plastic spoons at the end. No need really
You completely changed the amount of flavoring in the recipe so, no, you didn't make the recipe. Probably best to say that judgment should be reserved for the original.
In 1660s, how did they obtain ice? Was this made in winter season?
Kiano is so smart!
This was northish right? Cause how did they had the ice?
Is she new? I love her already!
When I saw the title of this video I thought to my self "Well it would be expired"
I REALLY like her!! Please more videos with her, this is a refreshing tasty video :)
you added way too much orange flower water.
WHAT A DISGRACE I JUST GOT CLICKED BAITED SHE PUT 3 BLADE EXCEPT 1
Hope you guys find more antique recipes!
People are totally eating perfume ice cream (rose, lavender)
she’s so pretty omg
I love how calm Kiano is I need a video explaining her tips and tricks to attaining that composure??
Does anyone else watch these when you're hungry, because you're too lazy to actually get up and eat?
You guys should try rose water instead! ????
Nasty ??????

ICE CREAM RECIPE OLD AS WAKONDA
I love you so much Omg aaaaaaaaa
Orange flower is delicious
You can put it in but you can’t take it out. -kiano You are very wise Kiano
OMG i love her, we need more
Nice click bait, fucking reported
She’s so well spoken. I love it
Wait ?? If there is no refrigerators how is there ice ??
She acts like she’s never made homemade ice cream before. ??
that holy moly at the beginning sounded like "chuj mój", which in polish means "my dick" that was the first thing that came to my mind i'm so sorry kiano
i love this
This was a great change of pace. The straightforward, deferential, sincere delivery was so refreshing and made for a very pleasant, even soothing viewing experience. Great job, Kiano! (Btw, your skin is da bomb! Absolutely gorgeous girl!) I've gotten so used to content makers being cheeky, sarcastic, and flippant when trying or introducing history or old material. That''s not to say that this approach can't be effective, but it is only so when the content creators are (or at least appear to be) very knowledgeable and intelligent about the subject. Unfortunately, very few content creators (for some reason) take the time or effort to do this. Shane Madej and Ryan Bergara are some of the few examples I can think of who can pull this off. Probably because deep down inside Shane is a respectful person and takes it seriously. Only throwing in jokes when it seems appropriate (and never out of ignorance). Which is why they achieved a great amount of success while still remaining at Buzzfeed.
Looks pretty good for a 350 years old ice cream
the lady who created ice-cream is a geniuss!!!
Please make more "eating your feed"
That’s what she said
Lol I love this I love ice cream too!!
I thought this said we tried to eat icecream from 350 years ago not make it sooo.... This is nice ??
I would love to see more Kiano vids!!
if theres no refrigeration back then, how'd they make the ice?
?????? ??? .. ????? ?????? ?????? ????? ?? " ???? ??? "
Orange blossom water is delicious! It's used everywhere in Arabic pastries
I have a question. How did they get ice in that time. I may just be dumb.
She took WAY TOO MUCH of the Orange water. You don't have to go to culinary school to know that you use spices and flavours very carefully.
try making stretchy ice cream!
I hit the e-e red botton
I love her voice it's so relaxing lol
She's annoying. ??
I love her voice
Orange flower is very strong and not pleasant on its own
She’s cool
Orange flower water is to be added without caution lol, it tastes good when you put "a lot" It's like sugar..?? I mean you don't treat it like vanilla extract .. you can be free
How dis they do ice ??
Sooooo she made ice cream??
Wait a minute... How did they get ice 350 years ago if they didn't have freezers?
Well you just ruined a good old recipe, by doing it in the wrong way of making manual ice cream..
This is useless if you didn't know the exact measurements. They're not the 'replica' of anything.
For some reason I thought you guys were going to try 350-year-old ice cream ??????
0:20 1660 is the 17th century tho?
They changed the recipe and the steps quite a bit
Kiano's voice is making me sleepy I love her.
Thanks!You are sweet! Can you write recipe?
Did she put the ice bucket into a freezer or room temperature ?
I love how calmed yet interesting you are
How did they get ice cubes if there wasn't a freezer then
They had plastic wrapper 350 years ago?
Ice cream be like :"I never freeze" 4:32
Clickbait, the ice cream itself isn't 350 years old
Nothing beats my 2,000 year old boiled rice recipe. Everyone should try it!
she added a quarter cup wtf
Water evaporates, so you don't put orange flower water in when the rest of the mix is hot. You put it in at the last second. Look up any middle eastern/Mediterranean/south Asian recipe for desert that uses it. Same goes for Blades of Mace. I like Tasty's concept, I really do, but y'all need to do your research if you wanna do these videos.
Pretty girl. I like that hairstyle and your lipgloss.
Where is rie?
I like the producer's presentation <3 ! Such a nice and chill lady ! Really liked watching this, as for making it haha... Dunno...takes too long.
Really love the video effects along with the speeches lol
I I l I lo I lov I love I love t I love ta I love tas I love tast I love tasty I love tasty s I love tasty so I love tasty so f I love tasty so fl I love tasty so fli I love tasty so flip I love tasty so flipp I love tasty so flippi I love tasty so flippin I love tasty so flipping I love tasty so flippin
Till nowadays Ice cream in the Middle East has those flavours+ pistachios + melted Arabian gum, and it's called: Bouza, sold traditionally in shops and street vans.
But where did they got the ice from???
They didnt have mechanical stoves or wraping paper or anything you used so I dont think it taste the same
C'mon Tasty, what's with that clickbait thumbnail (not title). You guys are better than that
I’m eating ice cream rn
writes down recipe goes to church 350 year old recipe!
Kiano vs rie
Wow...using a oldy goldy recipe to prepare ice cream is absolutely stunning!!
She has great camera presence.
Remy Ma raps ??& cooks ????
If there was no fridges back then, how did they made ice for ice cream? ?? IM CONFUSION
Did people have electricity 350 years ago?
Love Kiano and her videos??
Amm I'm a kid and I have a question how could they make ice cream back then if they did not have refrigerators to make ice unless they were from the artic and again Shiping it would not work it would melt but love the video
More of this kind of video please :) She is just so amazing!!
Kiano is the cutest she’s just so adorable
In the 1600s how the hell was there ice present if there weren't refrigerators .... that seems made up
But how did they make the ice if they had no refrigeration!?!?
How did the Lady get ice if there was no freezer 350 years ago? Did they make ice cream in winter?
We tried using a 350 year ice cream recipe
dang! I wonder how that recipe is still here (considering it went through 350 years...)
We did this when I was grade 4
Did anyone else think it was cheese ??
I love watching Kiano
Wait, how did they make ice 350 years ago? Why couldn't they make ice cream in the same way...
Her voice is so soothing
kiano is so chill and lovely omg
KIANO IS SO CUTE OMG
May be instead of plastic wrap on the top, go for aluminum foil and a shallower dish so that the top foil is in contact with the custard
she is so well-spoken i love it
You should provide the citation to the manuscript where you found these recipes.
Who would have this much cream at hand
bro i love her personality :b
Her skepticism tells me she's not familiar with old fashioned ice cream churns that use ice and rock salt to freeze the ice cream mixture. My mother grew up with a hand crank model, which is why she bought an motorized model for when I was growing up. Good times! Granted, you're not likely to get a hard set on your ice cream without a modern freezer, but you can get something firmer than a soft serve consistency.
Nice voice.
Lol an add for tasty came on right before this
You should make stretchy ice cream!
350 year old recipe? Sheesh. Back in the good old days where they had to do everything the hard way. I can't even imagine.
Try to make s t r e t c h y ice cream
IF THERE WAS NO REFRIGERATOR IN 17 th CENTURY THEN FROM WHERE DID ICE COME ???. .....Illuminati background music.........
You poured way too much Orange Flower Water to your cream! That is why it tasted so bad.
I just want to reach through the screen and eat it
????????????
dOn'T fOrGeT tHe OlIvEs!
the idiot didn’t even follow the recipe
I am sorry to ask the wrong question in wrong suitation can you please tell me you foundation shade please?
More historical recipes please, Tasty! (Also maybe consult with a food historian?)
It reminds me of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.
Such a soothing and calm voice ! This video was relaxing and entertaining
Can you make strechy ice cream that would be cool if u did
Where did they get the ice though?
WAIT SO PEOPLE HAS TO EAT ICE CREAM WHEN IT WAS COLD 350 YEARS AGO??? it couldn't be a refreshing summer treat because of the lack of refrigeration... I'm shook
lol i didnt notice i was eating a mcflurry while watching this video????
Damn she is so chill !
An ice cream recipe from the 17th century... Yes please! This is amazing.
Kiano is cooool so great that the first recipe I see her do is ... ice cream !!! :D
Watch my channel video ?? https://youtu.be/l0X2NetU7r0 (Making Slime With Funny Balloons Most Satisfying Slime Video)
I thought we used to use snow and vanilla and mix it together to make ice cream
Your honestly so fucking stupid you didn’t even follow the recipe dumb hoe no wonder it tasted like ass smh maybe if you weren’t barred out on Xanax it would’ve worked
it is just amazing
I thought you aged ice cream for 350 years lol
If you don't have fridge in that era, how do you manage to get ice(unless you get it from the nature)??
This chick is straight ?? ?? ??
I am very hungry for ice cream Now
I'm sorry but I'm triggered by the quality of the video
She's so cute
Tons of things like this on James Townson YouTube channel. They had someone making parmesan ice cream. And of course the 1700's fried chicken episode.
They must have had a lot of trouble storing the ice cream 350 years ago.
Different people got different tastes
That ice cream would be expired, I think.
Of cause it does not taste good. She used way to much Orange flower water. She also added more than twice the amount of Blade of mace as the recipe said. She did not whip it, And no ice cream is not ready after 2 hours on ice. It need a lot more time and you need to steer it from time to time, so it does not crystallize. Did she know nothing at all about making ice before she began? What she made is a basic old fashioned ice cream as it is still made today by many. Myself included. She just did it wrong from point a to z Ice cream maker/machine is not necessary when made right
Kiano has the most beautiful skin I've ever seen
Where did they get the ice?
Wait.. If she said 350 years ago dont have refrigerator to freeze the Ice cream, then where the heck 350 years ago people get the ice from???
She has a cute face.
How did they have ice without refrigeration 350 years ago?
Ok, so we got our recipe. Now lets just go ahead and throw that away. Im gonna do it so that it wont represent the original recipe. So what did ice cream taste like then? I have no idea, this is just a bowl of random ingrediant amounts. Probably should have done more research.
That's an amazing idea. Make more of these videos.
If 350 years ago there were no freezers how they made ice ?
i think you should put salt on top of the ice to speed up the project
more kiano pls
That's right stick it to the slave masters ghost!!!! We eating ur recipe now ????
Doesn’t she look like remy ma???
I have a doubt....if they had no refrigerators then...how did they make ice to chill the ice cream??
Would like to see more videos of making stuff from really old recipes.
what is the difference between milk and cream?
She is so beautiful :)
Damn it, Kiano is always looking gorgeous!! I wish I could marry her!
wow.. i literally thought for a second that the icecream itself was 350 years old... I'm so dumb...????????
I like her coz she doesn't give fak about anything
Please use this girl more often in Tasty videos, she's lovely!
good video .......YESSS.??????????????????
Don’t call it following a recipe if you don’t actually follow the recipe
Lol
I made ice cream the old fashioned way before...we churned it by hand... took me almost an hour. Even at 9 yrs old I was like not worth my time lol
i love her so much
did they have plastic wrap even in the 1600 ??
Where did you find ice in 17th century
Where did you find ice?
Immediately clicked when I saw Kiano! Your videos are always so creative, but also super soothing haha (To the editors or whomever, is there anyway the ending of the video could not be blocked by two big Watch More boxes? It ruins the end of the video, every time.)

Haha I’d just go to the market and buy some ?? ??
This sort of thing makes me embarrassed to be a millennial. It's not amazing that it "holds up so well", because this is a common way to make ice-cream--people were using essentially this method to make ice-cream at home just a few decades ago. She used four times the amount of mace in the first recipe and 15 times the amount of orange water in the second recipe, and then remarks that it's too strong! It's a little sad that they don't know the flavour changes as the mixture cools, but it's sadder that they judge the original recipe based on the results of their borked version.
It should be noted that we are used to stronger flavors and artificial flavors, so they'd probably use less of the ingredients to taste the flavor...
Wait if people didn't have refrigerator back in the days how did they obtain their ice???
Lololololo
But how the ice got iced
She said they didnt have a fridge
I hate it wen idk what to comment !
Damn Kiano you are sexy as hell ??????
I make Bread & Butter Pudding every now and then and sometimes add either a bit of orange flower water or Cointreau. For both a little goes a long way as they develop after a few hours.
96th comment (this is stupid)
How was ice made without freezers
Did you just add salt to lower the temperature? That's not how thermodynamics work. Sigh.
Step 1: make ice cream Step 2: wait 350 years Step 3: eat
actually.....salt increases the freezing point
Best and most calm video from tasty I’ve ever seen
The thumbnail makes it seem like the ice cream's 350 years old...
I like her
Orange blossom water is popular in north africa, I love it!
Heh hee most certainly ice cream machine or least a freezer nowadays is needed. :D
She looks like Doja Cat so much omg
Tasty never stop copying others
Christmas time has Cinnamon ice cream that’s almost to die for. SO GOOD. The “blade of mace” ice cream reminds me of that a little bit.
Funny...my name is keanu. Pronounced like (kee-ahh-new)
Hi Guyyyyyyssses I Love This Channel So Much???????? I’m Subbing Everyone In The Next 30 Minutes?????? If You Like This Post?? Comment Done? So I Know To Sub Your Channel?? And Sub Back I’m Doing Everyone....GO??
Fun fact, 350 years ago, people get their ice from ice merchants, who gets their ice from ice miners who lives in colder areas closer to the poles. So people were using ice that was taken from lakes and rivers, brought in by a ship, sold in big blocks and stored in an ice shed. Having ice in their drink and eating ice cold desserts is a sign of wealth, because ice was a rare item.
She reminds me of a black version of the girl from last man on earth
The most calm video ever
When you little sister got a birthday cake but no ice cream. ????
Who else thought they were gonna eat a 350 year old ice cream
I hope you do more videos like that, you are very charismatic :) I wanna try this recipe
330TH COMMENT ~Rox
No refrigeration, but plastic wrap is fine.
MAKE STRETCHY ICE CREAM.
She's a real cutie would love to see more of her and listening to her sweet voice. The ice cream looks good too.
Her skin tone??
If back in the day they didn’t have refrigerators and used ice, then how did they make the ice??
Kiano is just so pretty omg
Kiano ??your voice is like alluring me in drugs, you are making me sleepy... <3 <3 <3
I would have appreciated it if you would have religiously followed the original recipe rather than modify the ingredients; so basically you made a new recipe and no longer the 350 year old recipe.
This is the kind of video i like
How did they freeze things 350 years ago?
Probably the calmest person on Tasty :/ (well and Rie!)
i thought they were gonna age the ice cream for 350 yrs.............im so smart!!!! ;)
It's not good, because you kept adding the flavor, more and more!
I think a better title would be: Trying Out A 350-Year-Old Ice Cream Recipe
Very nice
Wow, y'all waited 350 years to eat this?
Heyyyy Kiano??
Matt!
ok but like where did they get the ice from back then?!?!?!?!?
How did they get ice in the summer and how did they keep it like what if she made a lot and she only made it for her (accidentally)
Is it an American recipe? Then bravo for realism.
I like this series. I hope you do more old recipes!
how did they make ice back then?
I think if she didn’t put too much orange flower water it would’ve just been a hint of it
Yum??
Millions of people will watch this, only a few hundred will make it and a few dozen will get it right.
She kinda remind me of Miley Cyrus??
Where would they get ice in the 1600s? Unless it’s winter time I guess.
But did she really follow the recipe? It seems like she was doing a lot of it to taste but what did the recipe say about the flower water?
Tell me this doesn’t sound like Selena Gomez
Let me guess its booza Edit: ok nvm
if im early do i get a heart?
Omg
People of the old era were really interesting. Both flavors speak for it.
My outer edge has melted solid. What!?!?
But my inside is completely liquid. (Wink)
Please do it again.
I am early
I like her ??
kiano and rie are the most iconic chefs
i love this woman
There's just so many things in this videos. How the hell have you never made ice cream using this method before? Second, you seriously didn't realize how deep the container was and question why it didn't freeze in the first place? They didn't have that big of a container in 1600's. She did such little research and its so half assed.
This video is so misleading .......
Hi, what does a treat of the time means?
blade of mace that just sound like a op MMORPG weapon that you can obtain through hard grinding
so....you have the recipe but then just do what you want. like whats the point??????????
Love ice cream!! BTW can u plz tell me with what can i replace almond flour for making macarons?!
WE WANT MORE OF KIANO!!!!!! I love Kiano! She so pretty and I love her personality and her voice. ??
OMG MY HURGY
If I had a 1 time use time machine I would go back to Lady Ann Fanshawe in 1660 and tell her her recipe was featured on youtube on Tasty!!!
Can we take a second to admire how beautiful kiano is ?
girl....you're beautiful, and i'm smitten by your chill vibe :)
I love orange flower water so much. It’s still used a lot in middle eastern dessert.
The woman would have go to the north pole to fetch ice cause 350 years old ago there were no refrigerators ??
I wonder who has a bucket that big at home
i bought tasty products from walmart. just loved it. thanks
jesus, add water to the ice...
Ann Fanshawe was an English memoirist and cookery author. Born at 25 March 1625, St Olave Hart Street, City of London, United Kingdom and died at 20 January 1680, Ware, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, married to Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet (1644). Daughter of John Harrison, this lady was a talent at her time! She wanted this to be a modern trend of the 1700s but look what ice cream is now. After all, this what you can do is.. mix the blade of mace and orange flower water and BOOM!! I mean like no one really used to read her books THAT MUCH. but wait till 200 years and BOOOOOOOOM! SOMEONE SAYS OK I READ IT ITS A PIECE OF HISTORY.
So ice cream is frozen sugar milk?
from where did they get the ice 350y ago?
This is so relaxing to watch yea? OK I think so.
These sound like hipster ice cream flavors
You have a Buch of subscribers, mind giving me a few pointers?
if you are a fan of cooking,desserts abd you love to watch cooking videos and enjoy it,i’v uploaded lovely stuff that you can see and like ??Have a great greatly day ??
Kiano needs to be in more videos!
Ice cream, Ice Cream, Who wants some ice cream? :D
I was hoping for a 350 year-old ice cream
WHEW....I've never been this early
Wow I thought salt melted ice.!
Every-time I watch a tasty video with Kiano in it, I can't stop staring at her! She's so BEAUTIFUL! She has gorgeous eyes and lips! (Not in a creepy way) Also, she's so calm..like she could be synonymous with serenity :)
Kiano, like piano.. She's cute..
woah this video was so chill haha
Where’s the 350 year old??? Clickbait
350 years ago..??????.. lires..
I have the same soap feeling with the orange flower water. I honestly hate the flavor but it’s used in multiple desserts over here in the Middle East.
She did a decent job, but needed to know that flavors get stronger to the taste as liquids cool or freeze since it takes time to develop. This is why it's best to add less flavor...what seems not flavorful when hot will taste better at room temperature or cold.
She is so cute
Species were expensive but they aren’t now
350 yeezy?
"Icy" cream
350 years old? It should’ve rotted years ago!
I thought the thumbnail was Michelle Obama before I wore my glasses
I LOVE ??

Ice cream recipe from the mid 1660's !~~  This is just amazing !!!
holy shit i thought it said trying to make a 350 year old into an icecream, LMFAO. thats enough internet for one day.
Name gang
I have 350 year old icecream stuck to the roof of my freezer. Never cleaned or defrosted so it must be that old.
That looks Tasty
You do know that the 17th century is the 1600s, right?
I’m going to take a break from eating ice cream. It’s getting too cold outside ??????
Something different
the mid 1660's is still in the 17th century, no need to correct it.
