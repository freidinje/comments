This was the first episode filmed in my office, to answer your question, yes, it was due to the whole Maldives episode issue thing (now resolved! Fair use win!) ANYWAY this was actually a really fun episode to film with just Ken. We literally rigged the mic on a broom and taped it to the wall for support. Enjoy this episode of #Monaco!
Best geography Chanel
I really love the animation in this episode. It's probably because you can show the entire country in the animations, but it's still really great animation.
Damn you Ken...LOL
Can't wait until the Mongolia episode, do the nomads proud!
Europe’s version of Macau
I expected him to bring up Grace of Monaco
Why no UK? you've done France and Saudi Arabia. And tiny nations like the Maldives, I don't get if you want to rip into us that's ok just seems a tad odd is all to leave us out?
I LOVE THIS SHOW
11:49 why did you choose these 4 and not, for example Nico Rossberg, WHO IS A WORLD CHAMPION (while 3/4 in this frame aren´t)!
Don't interrupted Barb, let Ken do his thing thanks.
YESSS FINALLY MONGOLIA
reminds me of florida but with farm land and more crimes
I'm actually from monaco and am living there but i've learned so much stuff in this video wtf
All 2 km of it XD
The ë letter exists in French. In Noël for example (Chrismas)
Do Morocco please?
I flew past it when I flew to nice, it was 1 min til landing
More micro nations =more war
Are you ever going to do the UK ?
Hey Paul, be less of a prick and could you please respond to my email? Thanks
Dude, its not that hard to respond to an email
Thuis series just keeps in tanking in quality
I love your videos. Please include kilometers since most of the world uses the metric system. Thanks you :)
EY! It's an Indonesian Update V- wait a minute
oh, you have indonesian subtitle!! terimakasih !!
Anyone thought it's Indonesian flag?
Next is mongolia
Okay so the zooming in and out map graphic stuff is AMAZING. so cool.
Do Serbia in the near future plez :(
I hope tsunami hit Monaco :)
um these GRAPHICSSSS
If one square meter is worth $45k, than a square centimeter is worth $4.5... This is why you really should learn metric system...
hot take Ken > Noah, let him out more!! :D
Poland ?
I thought that you make indonesian episodes twice :v
So, Monaco is a Rapture that made it.
Hey GN can you guys do a QnA video too... pls pls
Monaco: Hey Indonesia Can I Copy Your Homework Indonesia: Sure But Change A Bit Ok Im Just Kidding Man
So Monaco is a monarchy... a Monarcho?
Poland still has a way to go before it's on the show. :/
Yeah Mongolia, my country!!!
Wow! That flag same as Indonesia
“So I must leave, I have to go, to Las Vegas, or Monaco , to win a fortune, win a game, my life would never be the same!”
don't say the disgusting "soccer" word, it's FOOTBALL
Wait! What about the flag?!?
So much knowledge...
Monaco's flag is exactly the same as Indonesia's flag.
Click the link idiots https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtDgmPeydE&t=3s
How many time did he says formula 1.
when your country is basically Genovia
As a reward for supporting them in the Italian War of Unification the King of Piedmont and Sardinia ceded the province surrounding Monaco to France in 60. The cash-strapped Prince of Monaco sold 95% of his principality to France. The area including the city of Nice was Italian-speaking, a Ligurian dialect.
Oh look, it's Indonesia again. . . . Wait a minute.
11:49 you missed Alonso, Hamilton, Hulkenberg, verstappen (recently), vettel, raikkonen, rosberg, etc
Yay! Leclerc!
When you gonna cover The Netherlands ?
So.. you are more like a geography teacher.. well.. there is a word for that.... my mom!! ??????????????????
I really wanna see Romania
You can literally fit Monaco 8,550,000 times into the whole of Russia (17,100,000 sq km) EDIT: The Vatican City (0.44 km sq) can be fit 38,863,636 TIMES into the whole of Russia. MIND BLOWING!
Love your channel!! would you consider doing former contries? like USSR??
There's a little mistake at 8:26 : "ë" does exist in French, it's highly uncommon in particular compared to "é", but it does exist. From the wikipedia article, it's there to say that the previous vowel is pronounced alone, mostly in "guë" cases where you're supposed to pronounced both "g" and "u" (like in "aiguë"). It's also used in the French word for Christmas : "Noël" and in some first name such as Chloë.
Never fails to put a smile on my face . Thanks men!
That farmer lady is actually Swiss xD
A big hug from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
This video is so unnecessarily long. It's bloody Monaco, not China.
Teacher: how Monaco looks like? Me: Like a praying giraffe
Almost the whole grid of drivers of the 2018 or any season live / own something in Monaco
The city animations are amazing! Looks like a drone shot almost
Switzerland pls!
DO THE NETHERLANDS
Its incredible to see how much history a place smaller than my neighborhood carries.
It feels like we have been on M since January :D (just joking)
A French town called Nice? nice name
Is this the brother of Masaman? They both have the same pseudo mongoloid looks, like they are from Turkmenistan.
Ë does occur in French though.
Basically the country from the princess diaries
Fun Fact: as a french guy I'd like to point out that a fair share of french people just think Monaco is a french city (they don't see it as an independent country - even if they actually went there!).
When will you do a video about the glorious country taht's Tanou Touva ? ^^
The moneybag republic
Love the editing in this one
AHHH IT WILL BE TAKE SO MUCH TIME TO "T"...
Oh Monaco, the country paid for with stolen tax dollars from the rest of us.
1 square meter is actually 10 000 square centimeters. the right price would be $4,5 for a square centimeter, assuming a square meter of $45k.
Ken the real MVP ????
Who loves Monaco?
A square cm in Monaco would be $4.50. There are 10,000 square cm in a square meter
I didnt know Monaco is a country itself. I thought it was a province/city of France.
Pakistan geography?????
STAY TUNED MONGOL--- Ad starts -- LIA IS COMING UP NEXT
btw ü and ë exist in french, you're wrong, for instance the french word for christmas is Noël xd
Pls do morocco
The bus in 2:25 is an Israeli bus. EGED bus!!!
8:32, actually, its pronounced bon-jor-no
4:08 Monte Carlo casino, a friendly reminder that gains of gambling trend to 0 as the number of time you gamble increase (Monte Carlo method)
Damn do we get to hear about Genghis Khan next time?
AS Monaco Football Club has 8 championship titles since they have won the last in 2017* ;)
The Google Earth Map graphics are so awesome. Show us how you do it please.
Oh, The exceptional episode is coming.
Ken was like: Yassss
Actually it's 4,5 Dollar for a square centimeter ??
WILL WE EVER SEE SERBIA??????
BROOO, I’ve BEEN WAITING THREE YEARS FOR YOU TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT VENEZUELA AND I AM STILL WAITING
Ken, you've got some hay on your hair.
A french speaking country but no french subtitles...
82 more weeks until UK
are those animations from google earth? looks amazing
Do mongolia next
ü and ë exist in french. not very common but exists
Thought it was Indonesia for a sec.
That's not Monaco, that's Indonesia! ??
Monaco belongs to France.
Do Poland now :D We have almost the same flag as Monaco, just the colours are reversed :D
1 sq cm is 1/10000 of 1 sq m, that would make it worth 4,50$, which is still way too much
Waiting for philippines......
Hot and humid as hell. Went there in July and got positively drenched in sweat. Also expensive as hell, but you knew that already. It's also a pedestrian's paradise. Would recommend.
Aww... Why not the black background?
???? ? ?????
If one squate meter is $45.000 then a square centimeter is $4,50 not $450, there are 10.000 cm2 in a m2
Okay, Leclerc made it in. I'm satisfied now.
Please do Sweden or at least some scandinavian country
casino royale is in montenegro according to the film, while the actual location is in prague
What geography? The Its a city lmao, The closest thing they got is the Larvotto beach
What about it's educational System? Are there any Schools in Monaco?
It's $4.50/cm². A square metre is 100²=10000 square centimetres. Still very expensive but much more reasonable
i love ken : )
The current Princess is a South African
Minus the closet, this background is superior.
Is it just me or does Indonesia, Poland, Greenland and Monaco have every similar looking flags.
Don't judge a video by it's thumbnail. Indonesian be like "Wow, it's indonesia again... Wait, nope"
You forgot about the Italian invasion of Monaco during WW2
Monaco ke?? Ingatkn Indon tdi????
Imagine the next Geography Now episode being filmed in a backyard
I want Ken & Noah together!
Why France didn't ever take over? Why does France prefer to conquer a little island in the middle of oceania instead?
$45,000 per square meter equals $4.50 per square centimeter, not $450. A square meter is not 100, but 100 × 100 = 10,000 square centimeters.
Ken is sooooo adorable. Cant wait for the Philippines episode. Lol. He should make a great appearance there.
When I was in Monaco in 2010, a Polish guy said he liked my Polish hat...It was Monaco hat... Same colors Poland/Monaco , pattern is reversed!!! :)
Fun times: I had a Geography project last year and I decided to do it about Monaco, in the style of your videos. And I did good, which is fantastic. I was damn near hoping you'd start off with the way I started off, "Monaco, let's MonaGO!"
8:50 - Didn't Prince Albert end that law?
1:03 Once you see it, you cant unsee it
I can't unsee that praying giraffe
MONEY
Kens nips are protruding.
Dat editing thou ????
Can you please do Sweden?
Barbs, would you be doing Montenegro or Serbia? :)
Hope you can do the geography more, at least until flag Friday began or when you started including additional info in flag Friday.
I hope Noah is alright and I wished more people could've joined ya'll, but it so cool to see Ken on screen more :)
Lily Safra got her fortune By marrying a millionaire and investing her (his) money In property, then he died In a fire and she inherited his fortune. After that she married another rich guy and invested his money In real state as well, her other "job" besides being a real state broker is a socialite, that is someone who frequents parties and gets famous for it.
You missed Donetsk
Finally Mongolia Next.
Trains are my thing!
Why did you include gutierrez but not massa or verstappen?
1:56 I heard that's a pretty nice airport.
Indonesia ??
Wow the Animation.. Thank you Ken!
The oceanographic museum in monaco is the best aquarium i've ever been to.
It would actually be $4.50 per sq cm because you can fit 10,000 sq cm inside a sq meter
Monaco is one of the three European countries where the monarch has powers with day to day politics. The other two being Liechtenstein and the Vatican.
I love when you speak. You talk fast(makes u Sound smart, lots of facts, u r so clever and funny! Way to go. Good video :)
8:50 So, if France wants Monaco, all it has to do is kill off the Grimaldi family, and then legally Monaco is theirs?
Oh boy, Mongolia is coming. After such a boring country, we're getting a big boy next.
actually a square cm would only cost 4.5 dollars...
ken sucks! <^.^.>
Khagan is coming!
What was going on in Monaco during ww2? , must've been a bit tense as to who they would ally with ?
Indonesia , Poland , Monaco “We have the real FLAG!!!!!”
Thank you. Very nice video Waiting for Ukraine ?? if you will need any help in gathering information - text me.
Hyped for Mongolia, was a Mongol historian in college and can't wait to see what you do for them :)
indoNesia is just copying Monaco flag stupid indon
Monaco = Crime state. Nothing fancy about it
I’m from Montenegro, how can I help you make a video?
What about turkey ?
I can not stop thinking in the cute pregnant giraffe <3
Monaco couldnt add blue to their flag cuz they would have the same flag as holland
Monaco's business tax is actually 33.3%, which is kind of high
Charles Leclerc
But Sir Roger Moore is dead...
This is the ferst country that iv been to all the sights mentioned in the video (yay geography now bingo)
11:22 Charles you legend
AS Monaco has 8 championship titles not 7 their last one was in 2017
why this country exist ?
I don't think that Roger Moore lives there anymore...
Make one for Portugal plz
nice :)
Why can't you do NORWAY OR NICARAGUA!!!!???????
Casino Royale was In Montenegro. I hate to be so pedantic, but your channel is called GEOGRAPHY NOW. ^^
Soon, Monaco will reclaim all of the Mediterranean. mwhahahahahahahaha and its real estate will STILL be expensive.
3:18 no, that would be $4.5
I’m from Monaco ???? !!!
I'VE BEEN THERE
So from the most densely populated state to the least huh?
Ah, Monaco. As Somerset Maugham so aptly put it: A sunny place for shady people.
I kind of thought Monaco was a region in France because AS Monaco is in Ligue Un
I love Ken lmao
Ken is hot.
6:25 only 2 percent more than Israel
I thought monaco is part of France
3:13 No. It would be $4.5.
Can't wait for Mongolia!
WTF!! the bus at 2:22 is an old isareli bus (egged company ???
I demand more Ken
Is there a Serbian Episode?
Yes, Mongolia! Genghis is excited
Bruh... This country is so cheap asf, Sili in the Philippines is more expensive. By the way I use the term Monacan to refer someone from Monaco. I don't even what Mona... Whatever you say this, before I watch the video.
It made me so happy to watch this episode as I got to live my childhood in Monaco! Recognising (and even learning about) the principality made me strangely nostalgic. Thank you for the video! :)
I think i can take over monacco with ez. If the french protect it
You better talk about Mongolias navy next episode
8:33 so, yeah Just like italian but french
very cool broo.. thumbs up!
13:00 why dose monaco look like it has a mouth?
welcome to mobile legend. ????????
Singapore = eh, cute
nearly 3 years in, Still waiting on Zimbabwe
Chaaarrlll Lecleerrrr
Everything on polandball amino has indonesia/monaco
I have seen that flag before......
Soo... It's basically the European version of Dubai
One of four countries without an airport
ken can like... get it
@1:03 I can't unsee it now
Hey, as far as I could see, you used the image of Israeli green bus here ?? from the "Egged" public transport company! Was so funny to see it in Monaco! :) Great vid though, as always! ??
6:22 Isn't the VAT 20% now? 19.6% was like 4-5 years ago.
imagine if monaco have a embassy in indonesia or vice versa , people wouldn't recognize most likely ??????
In 2:20 when describing the bus routes, why did you use a photo of Israel's Egged bus company? :O
WHY don't you make a Turkey?
Or you could just walk into Monaco.
I will make a video. That video is "It's time to learn GEOGRAPHY NOW!!! 1 hour "
I like to see all those animations!!! I really appreciate the additional work that you guys put into it and I am even happier because it means that the show is going great!!!! Keep up the great work!
Lol! 1/3rd people are millionares, rest billionares and trillionares.
Money, Money, MORE MONEEEYYY!!!!
I am eagerly waiting for #Nepal episode
I'm from Monaco and thanks for this video. I don't know anyone who isn't a millionaire, besides workers.
My wonderful country. Here we have an utopia.

Merah putih
10:10 barbs lookin fine as hell
Can you make quizes that go along with your videos?
Why isn’t this country just a part of France it’s a city
do somalia
Monaco flag similiar to indonesian flag
5:10 wait can i do it? 5:12 NO 5:21 takes over
Why there is no Kings & Queens in Monaco?
Anyone else notice the unit conversion error? If it costs $45,000 per square meter then it costs $4.50 per square centimeter (1 meter = 100 centimeters so squaring these we get 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters) not $450 like they said at 3:06.
Too bad they're going to get relegated this season
Senna premerio . Mansell segundo. Ayrton, Ayrton, Ayrton sennaaaaaa dó Brasil.(Tema do victoria plays)
Monaco actually seems like a pretty dope place.
DO MOROCCO ????
e??l? ??u ????ppo
Monaco: Hey can I copy your homework? Indonesia: Sure, just change it a bit.
Wow! I could recognize the F1 track once Port Hercule showed up (of course, having a dedicated pit zone helps)...
Isn't Casino Royal in Montenegro, not Monaco?
I get confused between Monaco and Morocco
Unless you're crazy rich, it's impossible to get the citizenship to be monegasque as both of your parents have to monegasque and their parents as well and so on
I went to Monaco last year. Beautiful country!!! The changing of the guards is a absolute must watch!!!
Monaco flag cheating on Indonesia
Who do we have to talk to to get Geography Now shirts that just say "ANYWAY" on them?
Ken ???? ???? ????
Well, I guess we know why it's called Geography Now and not Math Now. :) A square centimeter would be $4.50, not $450 (there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter. METRIC CONVERSION FAIL).
" Money, money, money and money" Cool bit of history there
Roger Moore is dead guys
PHILIPPINES PLS
Money.. money.. money... more money.??
the ë does exist in french, for example noël (christmas),
is this gaston
FFS LEARN AREAS 1 sq m = 10000 sq cm
Ken and Barby. How cute! You guys Rock!
Pretty sure they changed the whole "the country dies with the Grimaldi family" in 2002.
You can see “ë” in French
Wait, how do we know ken isn't the one who broke noah's car so he can replace him in this episode??
my backyard
Money money more money
Monaco looks alike Indonesia flag .. Indonesia claim everything ??
Honestly you're kind of a douche lol
Finally to Mongolia next week! I’ve been waiting for you! Also can’t wait for the Switzerland episode.
Hey guys, sorry the others bailed on your but really good vid. Made me smile!
Monaco’s club team is doing terribly this season. They’re in 19th place and getting smashed by everyone they play.
Really stretching to inject as much muricuntism in Monaco as possible ??????
Its funny cus this year in f1 12 drivers out of 20 lived in monaco and 8 on the same road.
Yo Barbs, I came across a person named Barbato on YouTube. Any chance he is related to you?
A cm is 1/100th of a meter, but a SQUARE cm is 1/10000th of a SQUARE meter; so it would be 4.50$ per cm, not 450$.
5:40 she’s pretty
Was I the only one who thought Monaco was in Africa no just me ok
Where you hide your money...
please do Philippines!!!!!!!!!
Wait so Monaco is Sovereign? i thought it was like Puerto Rico of French
there’s a monaco joke and it’s a video of fan giving something to rihanna
haha even tho he's not in the normal studio, this is one of the best ones yet. :)
I’m guessing there are no border checkpoints so if you want the passport stamp I’m guessing you have to arrive by sea at the expensive ports
If France takes over Monaco if there’s no heir... France: Let me do my thing... MONACO PRINCE DIED!!!!! BREAKING NEWS France: hon hon hon hon.
I legit like this background better than the usual all black background.
So glad to have stumbled across your channel a while back. Always very fun and informative videos presented in such a nice way that makes you always want to come back for more, and left sad when you don't find a country your looking for in your past. (I am sure you'll get them all eventually! :-).) Looking forward to a future episode on the UK hopefully. Keep up the great and very enjoyable work!
Love that 3D illustration of the buildings
One of the reasons I subscribed Geography Now is that they use metric system

Funniest Episode so far :D
1:19 Indonesia Enclave
2:54 :D
Can I work for you?
Sadly Sir Roger Moore (James Bond) is no longer resident as he died in May 2017
little mistake on the sq m conversion, and noël (chrismas in french) contains ë, but meh .. awesome video and thank you !
Can't wait for Mongolia! I've been waiting since Hungary!
Man...I really wanna go there now.
Mona Co. is a fantastic business.
I'm going to need to put on my monocle for this one.
I didn't really know that Monaco existed because it is not really mentioned a lot in the United States of America. :( :)
#RICH
Ahmm, Your math skills aren't exactly impressive. Cringy
Pakistan please.
the way he pronounced grand prix oof
My very rich uncle and aunt live in Monaco while it is fully the most expensive city to live in in Europe
I actually kinda like it being filmed in your office as that wall is a awesome backdrop
Question: How easy is it for residents of nearby French towns to get work in Monaco? Obviously the country needs workers to take jobs not typically associated with millionaires (e.g. cleaners, hotel staff, school teachers etc.), so do they presumably commute into the country on a daily basis since it's so expensive to actually live there? Do they need any sort of specialist work permit to do that since Monaco isn't an EU member?
Where're the subtitles in Other languages?
3:04 there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter, 100x100. So the price of 1 square cm of land in Monaco would be $4.5
that moment when ken makes barbi look small
Can we make it to S before I grow old and senile?
I love ya ken
10:06 you can tell the skit has been attempted before because there is already water on Paul's t-shirt lol
Why is no one talking about the excellent animation of this episode?
Why the hell does monaco exist.
YES!!! MONGOLIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and great episode as always.
Mongolia, YES!!! I'm so excited I ran around town yelling Mongolia with my arms waving through the air
A key relationship was not mentioned in the FriendZone bit: RUSSIA. There even is a Wikipedia entry about that: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco–Russia_relations
I work in Monaco. I walk to the office. I live in France. You start walking and at some point you’ve changed countries. Sometimes you bump into the prince who’s just doing prince stuff.
More of ken
World: so what kind of topography do you have? Monaco: Um, we got this hill.
Daghe munegu!
Turks and Caicos Islands
3:18 - 1 m^2 = (100cm)^2 = 10000 cm^2. 1 cm^2 is 4.5$
you didn’t say a word about princess Stephanie :((
3:18 absolutely wrong 4,50 per square centimeter
Yay Ken!
You should the micro nations like sea land, mollosia and ,Liberland
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down.
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Yay. I had a vacation there! :D Me and my family went there. Then we drived to France, and then to ITALY!!!! ( If any bad english, then its cause im Danish. Also, loved your episode about Denmark :] )
You're awesome Paul, both you and your crew. I've watched most of your videos and i like it and i also love your explanation skills. Keep up the great work, mate.
8:27 Well yes you do find them in french. Although nowadays you barely see those letters in actual french words (I could only think of one for each) they were more present in an older from of the french gramar in wich the letter "ë" would be repaced by "é".
wow nice animation! way to go
Back to school again guys ! A square meter equals 10000 square centimeter ( 100 * 100 = 10000; remember ).
Next video UKRAINEEEEEEEE
Raaah ting! I thought Monaco is a region in France??
More Ken!
Is montengro next???
A square CM would be 4.50$...
Well, the language of Monaco is actually Genoese with small variations and some French loanwords. Proof is that I can understand every single word (I'm from Genoa). As for Monaco's economy... well, better not to dig too much into certain transactions. His Most Serene Highness wouldn't approve.
So... they just stole indonesia's flag?
Imagine barby being a geography teacher
Reminds me of the city on just cause 3
Hey Barbs do Poland!
I cringe everytime he tries to pronounce a name with a local accent. Notice how he pronounces Qatar
That's the best joke i've ever heard ?????? am gonna tell it to everyone
Native monagasques are technically Italian (like people from san marino). That would make 40% of the population Italian.
so man, stop making us wait for Ukraine, we can be emotional, you know.
I love how you pronounce the french words :3
Monaco: reclaims land Netherlands: Laughs in Dutch I am so much looking forward to that episode
@10:54 Lann the Clever real world inspiration?
Something is up here....how can there be a miss-schedule a few episodes in a row.... Even im not that disorganized...
Casino Royale’s setting is in Montenegro not Monaco.
Do New Zealand
Barbie, you and I have the same phone case
8:53 The country would not fall to France. That was changed in 2002.
Can you do Montenegro geography now
I am very good at geography (country's) but never new that Monoco is a country!!!
Gr8 episode! I don't know a lot about this country (even though I'm really good at geography, but I live in NZ) I have estimated you'll release the New Zealand episode around 11 January 2019 with no delays or filler weeks. With all of the filler weeks & delays taken into account, it will take you until around mid august 2020 to reach the Zimbabwe episode. Sorry to all 16.6 million Zimbabweans! PS: My best friend loves your videos too Barbs
Fun fact: The stadium of monaco is inside the university.
Actually ë does exist in french langage words like noël ( christmas )
Apparently the current Princess of Monaco(prince albert’s wife) grew up in the same neighborhood as I did in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe - so technically monaco is the only country in the world with an active African monarch(or technically wife of a monarch), so that’s pretty cool. There are so few white Zimbabweans left that the chances of that are almost zero
11:47 About that "Philanthropist" thing: I noticed that when you look at the Wikipedia pages of all top millionaires it also always says next to their professions that they are "philanthropist". I guess that's just an easy way to make someone look good, no matter their past or their actual profession (maybe they just inherited all the wealth and did like one charity thing).
when you can count the buildings from the country's satellite image. lol
Do one on senegal i need it bro for school please
Most geography now videos have the same demand unless you are ... wait for it... Mongolia.
Again...?
Go Charles Leclerc and Forza Ferrari
Monaco has Greek etymology... can't believe it...
It's rather interesting that following alphabetical order the country with the lowest population density comes after the country with the highest (having 50x the population of Monaco but 1 million times the area)...
I am so happy that you have mentioned Charles Leclerc:)
Is Ken straight?
I kinda like the background. Please, don't order the YouTube room :D This is much fancier.
Are you this guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HixR68sYGI4
In the summer it's full of tourists but in the winter it's like a ghost town. Lots of people own property in Monaco simply to avoid tax.
Please make Turkey
What kind of weird Indonesia is this ?
Monaco is like that aristocratic small center of town, where all the nobles with unimaginable riches live, in unimaginably expensive homes
"A se revede" sounds like Goodbye in Romanian
You forgot Daniel Elena, the famous copilot of Sebastien Loeb
but 1 sq meter is 10,000 sq cm ... so 1 cm^2 would only set you back $4.50
Ken's hot. Topless vids pls haha
The train station is not located in the middle of the country but at its border, anyway thanks for the video!
Yeah, Monaco... lost of Bruges home lol get rekt
???? Monaco ???? Poland ????Singapore ???? Indonesia Only Indonesia had a different flag!
When will The Netherlands be at the N or the T?
That's the flag of Indonesia.
Love Monaco I was there for Thanksgiving day where the Prince met us personally. They have a feast on that day for Americans. Funny to watch the waiters grabbing the small American flags before guests could take them home. The casino is very intimate so you're elbowing with the very rich. Harry's (owned by Cipriani) bar our favorite serving my husbands favorite steak tartare. The hotdogs sold on the street are delicous and their hot mustard clears the sinuses. Although small in size there's much to do and see there.
yes, Indoneisa ! oh wait,
Casino Royale took place in Montenegro not Monaco!
btw you could take lewis hamilton or nico rosberg instear of Esteban "another arrogant driver" Gutierrez
reee louis chiron
Monaco looks alot bigger in Plague.inc
Dude ur high? Nice!
Yaas mongolia
Ken is Now Free..... yey
Geography Now iron patches!
Ken is here.
Maths, gentleman -- There are 10,000 sq. cms in a square meter, not 100. It would $4.50/square centimeter
1 sq meter = 10000 sq cm
fail on the maths guys, thats $4.50/cm2
Waiting for my country for 4 years by now, Montenegro. 2 episodes away so Im so excited
It's amazing how you managed to keep the usual quality of your videos, despite the improvised studio!
If your a native monegasque youve won a lottery in life
Hercule not Hercules! They're not Greek!
Actually, there is an ë in French
Can You do Norway??????? like if you agree!
Will the Uk video be longer as there's 3 counties, as you covered Northern Ireland in the Rep Ireland video?
But why is it independent?
Sir Roger Moore is no longer a Monaco resident. God rest his soul.
You forgot Vietnam
Hey Paul, I have a tip if you can’t pronounce the words. If you can’t pronounce a word, go to google translate, search the language the word comes from, type the word, then listen to the word
Do Morocco next
I literally LOVE your Channel!
little mistake: casino royale was in montenegro.
Hey Barb actually we use ü and ë in French in a few words like "ambiguë" and... "ambigü", as odd as it may seem! Oh also, we use ot in "canoë" and "capharnaüm" :P
You made a mistake at 8:29 , the 'ë' is French (in Raphaël for instance) ^^
I like Ken tho.
Uuuuh,finally,what is different monaco flag and indonesia flag
You'd think hard pressed with land more high rise buildings will be there...here in Dubai it's abundant for some weird reason (cool tho cos during peak heat seasons a mere peasant like me can find shade in them....sigh)
Do Pakistan and Tanzania plis
MONGOLIA HYPE
Monaco also known as Indonesian't
Ken does a clever job at placing the eyes to make the countries have full faces.
12:19    S I N T E R K L A A S   C O N F I R M D
The flag are totally same as indonesia how ?
Dude what software do u use to explain the geographies?
NEPAL next please.
I have 300E in savings, 499.700 to go before I apply for citizenship
It's lovely to see Ken on the camera But I love him stay at his dungeon more
Geography lessons in 2300, Monaco was once the second smallest country, and now it is not.
WHEN YOUR LARGEST BODY OF WATER IS A SWIMMING POOL
can you do the netherlands next?
I've been so excited for Mongolia!
And F1?
Monagasque sounds a little bit romanian to me..
Monégasque is a variant of the ligurian dialect (genoan) of northern italian though heavily influenced by neighboring occitan (the traditionnal language of southern France) dialects (nissard, mentonasque). Fun fact : french citizens are very limited at applying to monégasque citizenship. This was decided, along with other fiscal deals in 1963 because french government was fed up seeing its uber-rich nationals and businesses expatriating themselves a few yards away to avoid paying taxes (among other issues). De Gaulle pressured Rainier Into accepting the deal by establishment strict custom control at every border of the principality (it is said that De Gaulle even threatened to cut off power, gas and water supply). Mutual relationships after De Gaulle leaving his office improved dramatically.
Roger Moore died last year...
Great races all the time
Isn’t that Indonesia’s flag?
Why Monaco is even a thing? Why they're not become a special state of france
I can't wait for you to get to the letter p > Philippines!
The "Im reading wikipedia, IN ORDER!" show!
Why u didnt make video about Serbia?
The "no heir, passes to France"-thing was reversed in 2002.
Conveniently for your upcoming Montenegro video: Casino Royale was actually set in Montenegro, not Monaco.
i miss you, my handsome ??????
it's finally here
Marathon in Monaco? How does that work? Twenty loops and you're done?
The prices are high to keep the undesirables out.. As best as possible.. No homeless, Single mom ,petty crime, employment Stoner issues Getto's..Wana bee's dont last long.. Need sustained Cash flow to.jsng in there.. Good job Monaco, so far..
he is lying about the studio isnt he
Sokka? Sokka?! SOKKA!
Monako flag like Indonesia flag
Hi Paul , Happy Deepawali ( Diwali ) ????????????????????????????????????????????????
Money money more money
It always surprises me to hear it's 2sq km... seems much bigger. But that's probably partly because it's long and thin - it's 4km if you walk from one side to the other. And when you go from the sea to the edge of France (ie. the narrow part) it seems further than it is because you can't walk straight up. For one thing it's steep and for another it's all roads snaking around and you can't walk it in a straight line.
Is AS Monaco's stadium even in Monaco?
$45000/sq. meter 10000 sq. cm = 1 sq. meter 45000/10000 = 4.5 Real estate is $4.5 per square centimeter, not $450.
Hey this was a good job and despite working in the building with the swimming pool near Chemin des Révoires I learnt some stuff (about the springs and the vegetable grower, for example). Here's some points I didn't agree with though or find questionable: The airport is 14 miles away and not 5 Foreign residents are never referred to as Monégasques and from what I've heard it's super-difficult to get the nationality. I haven't met any foreigners with it. You have to have had at least 1 grandparent born there or be given it by the Prince and normally it's not just a question of asking nicely, you need to be so to be they think brings prestige to the country, like famous chef Alain Ducasse was offered it after running the country's ritziest restaurant for years. Also you have to give up your original nationality. Benefits include the right to cheap places to rent. On tax, basially French nationals declare income to France and pay French income tax, full stop, as far as I know. You surprise me if that stops after 5 years, I'll have to double check that. I guess France didn't like the idea that thousands of its wealthiest people could just live over the border paying no tax. You can kind of see their point. As you said, being allowed to live there is mostly a question of can you afford it, so if you're very rich it's a no-brainer due to the no income tax etc (no inheritance tax too I think). I wouldn't really call barbajuan a ravioli because its crispy and also bigger than ravioli. Nice though, usually has spinach cheese and pine nuts in them.
So Monagasques are Saracens??? Come now boys, time to remove kebab.
i would like to visit Monaco
Philippines pls..
Hey guys, love your vids, but 3D units have larger conversion factors than 2D units. That means that if a m^2 of real estate costs $45,000, a cm^2 costs $4.50.
Please do the netherlands i want to see if someone finale makers a good video About the netherlands
I am excited to see how you'll wind up conveying Mongolia and their sudden decision to build themselves a large capital city... in the middle of the frozen steppe haha. Hoping for plenty of wit in it!
0:14 - because they have so much money...co. I'll see myself out.
NIGERIA?
Heaven defense not won a war since 1812??
Hey Barbs! Love you guys, and I know that the channels not Math Now, but the price per square cm in Monaco is actually $4.50 because 1 square meter = 100 cm * 100 cm or 10000 cm^2 and divide 45000 by that and you get $4.5/m^2. Love your videos still though!
Small mistake, both ü and ë are used in French language. For example, "acute" can be written as "aigüe" or "aiguë" in its feminine form.
Your content is interesting but man it really hurts see you trying so hard to be cool and funny, its OK if you're not charismatic, seriously isn't that bad if you're not charming just do your job and let your content flow
Can’t wait for Mongolia, I work at a Mongolian grill
I like the feel of your office compared to just the plain black wall. Been watching since Canada
Except for, wait for it: the mongols
I remember watching this in 5th grade. And back then our entire class would sing to the theme song... once we sang it too Loud, the teacher next door complained that we were too loud. Our class loved your channel!
5.23 rofl
I thought I knew a lot about Monaco but today I learned about the only farmer in the country! I love this channel!
This is Netherland a MFXIV. This it UAE a MFXIII.
WTH? WHO IS MONACO THIS MFXIX!!
Hei Barb, 1sqm = 10,000 sqcm, that makes land in Monaco will cost $4.5/sqcm. Still astronomically high though.
I love the animals part NOOOOW .
There are 100 cm in a meter, so there are 100^2, or 10000, square centimeters in a square meter. So each sq cm is worth about $4.50, not $450. That's still horribly expensive though.
Uh 1cm2 will cost $4.50 since there are 10,000cm2 in 1m2 :)
At 3:18, the price per square cm would be $4.5 (not $450) because one square metre = 10,000 sq. cm.
So basically a family was so rich they were like "I think I will go found a country today, just for kicks"
Finally! I can’t wait for my country
One Euro, Fifty Cents? Wouldn't it be 1 and a half Euros?
Julien Medecin won an Olympic arts medal, not an athletic one. He was an architect.
Prince Albert's ancestor, Albert I, married an American heiress, Alice Heine.
When did Ringo Starr become a resident of Monaco?
Ken did a really good job!
wait they are super rich and the first guy in their dinasty tricked his way to the crown, they are basically real life Lannisters lol
Finally! Monaco! I was blown away when I conducted my own research, but even the Monegasque language managed to pass under my radar. Thanks for the lesson!
Wow! Ken nailed his part this episode! Pretty cool.
Why did you choose a picture of an Israeli "Egged" bus?
Most important question is, do they have a working class?
Monaco's natural resource is money.
I really wanted someone to come out the closest and say there lines
It will be a long wait, but The USA and Vatican City will be quite interesting.
I love the 3d views effect!
Great episode! All I knew was its name and now I've learned so much about Monaco
Honestly, I kinda like the videos more without the YouTube space
USA IS MY COUNTRY....TRUMP
Ahhhhh, finally a video with millionaire Poland
I really love how when showing Monaco in the friend zone you can literally see buildings in the country
Next on Geography Now: Wait for it......Mongolia.
Just Monaco
Waited for this episode for too long
Hey what do we want we want Morocco ask us want we want Morocco
Genghis Khan is charging ahead
Monaco is Indonesia! ANSCHLUSS!
MONGOLIA IS NEXT
by the time Barbs gets to South Africa, Cape town will run out of water
I enjoyed this episode ... it reminded me of the early episodes from your apartment between dog walkings. LOL. keep up the great work! love how far youve come too!
"The flight only takes 7 minutes long"
scheduling issues
my favourite part of that episode was 'MONGOLIA' i cant wait
that's pretty Nice
Yeah mongolia!!!
Ken, he’s soooo awesome and cute ?????????? thanks ????
We need to start a campaign to ban micro states. They are just tax havens and shouldn't exist.
Yeah I love this country because it’s a literal race track and the car museum well you can go there and see cars you never seen before however you can see exotic cars all over that area.
I thought that you want Do Mongolia but ok
Casino Royal was set in Montenegro, not Monaco...
Omg the USA is involved in everything... they friends with everybody
Monaco just reminds me of a wealthy city
I’d better monago to bed. Get it!!
Ken, I love you. Ur so cute. ??????????
Imagine if America was run like this... We can only dream!
I asked myself: “He can’t do 15 min on Monaco. Can he?” I have been proven wrong
5:20 that awkard moment when you forget something important
You missed Ayrton Senna - F1 Brazilian Legend
My favourite Tekken character is from here! Only like this if you know who I'm talking about... :p
I'd rather live in South Sudan
Who else loves Ken?
Imho, this setup looks better except for the closet on that side. I know it broke the continuity but I liked it better.
The real question: will we ever get another episode from the YouTube Studio again?
I once wanted to call an Uber in Monaco because I didn't know they don't have Uber in that country and the app was literally like "We can't go there but just walk up the next road and you're back in France and we can pick you up there" XD
ë is also used in french
Ken actually did a pretty good job, id like to see him do some micro hosting again.
What they do with the poop?
Why are you so hot?
1 meter = 100 cm, but 1 m^2 = 100^2 or 10000 cm^2. so $45000 per sq. meter is actually $4.5/sq. cm.
Is monagasque a combo of Italian and French pretty much? Cuz up to Nice was italian until the French took it over so that would make some sense? @geographyNow
So you're telling me that Monaco is more demse then Manhattan.
Ëë is in French, in words like Noël.
love you barbs and hate to break it to ya but 1 sq meter=10000 sq centimeters not 100...so it's $4.50 per square centimeter which still seems pretty expensive
It should not be a really good place to live if you like to jog long distances
Saraceans and Geonoa, eh?
Hey, I'm a georapeep, I have a Serbian passport and my name's Novak but not Ðokovic! :-P
Does anyone know why he looks low-key angry/annoyed in this episode? Well, maybe it's just me.
How can they do a 42 km marathon if the country is only 4 km long?
A little bit of mannaco in life a little bit of Manaco rest of the song
"Native Monegasque"
Can't wait for Mongolia, the strongest empire in the 12th-13th century, yet become a barren land with so few people now.
I don't mean to be rude but for the Mongolia episode can you please make a reference to the definition of "mongoloid" on Urban Dictionary
22% of 38 Thousand is barely 9,000 indigenous citizens that live in Monaco!
3:10 a sq cm is 10,000 times less than a sq m.
I feel like Poland should've been this week considering it's turning 100 this Sunday.
Hello, I am from Monaco. Greetings!
Can you do Turkey next pls?
Really? Monaco? Are we really doing this?
that joke¡¡ where was the punch guy?
Can I please ask how you do the 3d map/satellite graphics? It looks really good and I want to use it for a travel video I'm doing.
Only 80 weeks until Turkey! :D
I've visited Monaco, its incredibly beautiful, and for being such a small country it doesn't feel that way. Most streets are considerably steep. I stayed at the Novotel in Monaco and for such a small country the hotel didn't make it feel that way. I highly recommend visiting it is by far the best place I've been in Europe. I recommend staying for two full days. See Monaco, Nice, Cap D' Ail, Cannes, Antibes, and Ventimiglia Italy. My only complaint about staying in Monaco is we took Uber to the hotel from the airport. But you cannot request an Uber in Monaco. So we ended up having a 100 Euro taxi fare to the airport. You can walk to France easily and request one otherwise the trains are amazing. Also cell carriers often charge additional fees for Monaco even if you have an international plan so do watch that. Also it is considerably cheaper to go there in the "winter" months. Europeans (the primary tourist group) doesn't go there during the winter as they view it as too cold. If you live in North America (I live in Minnesota) you'll be wearing shorts there in the winter months (unless your from Florida or socal). Although the temperature says its 50-60 degrees F it feels much warmer because it is still constantly sunny and some will notice its basically on the same latitude as Minneapolis but because the polar winds change by where the landmass is positioned it is much warmer in Europe on average than in North America; in other words it doesn't snow much on non mountainous parts on continental Europe.
Yay! The Netherlands finally popped up somewhere ;) Water,
#kenforhost
You didn't say what language they spoke. I'm sure its French, but how much English and Italian are spoken?
With all that land reclamation doesn't that mean their Exclusive Economic Zone in the Mediterranean increases? If so, how come this is possible?
No 3rd world fake refugees. Must be nice.
I kind of like it in the office better than the YouTube space because the background looks nicer (other than the random empty closet)
The only thing you got wrong was when you said that France will take over Monaco if the Grimaldis don't have a male heir. A treaty signed in 2002 between Monaco and Frnace ended that ridiculous clause. Monaco will stay Monaco and the billionaires and multi-millionaires of Monaco will be free from those poor French peasants.
There is always one Richy boi in every continent. Singapore, Qatar, this boi...
casino royale was set in montenegro
Indonesia = Monaco = poland = Greenland
YAY
Would be $4.50 per square cm, becuase the ratio is 1/100^2 not 1/100
3:10 someone doesn't know how area works. When has there ever been 100 cm² in 1m² ? 100x100 is 10000. 45,000 / 10,000 is $4.50...
Would be $4.50 per square cm, becuase the ratio is 1/100^2 not 1/100
QUE THE MONGOLTAGUE
3:12 $45 per square cm, area units divide up differently.
IVE BEEN TO MONACO. sorry just wanted to tell someone that
French does use both ü and ë
Why was one of your episodes taken down?
I never knew the Monaco's flag were similar to the Indonesian flag. They're quite triggered when discussing about their flag and I dont blame them.
3:14 Nope! There are 10 000 cm^2 in 1 m^2 (100*100), giving a price of $4.5/cm^2. Still, that's like Vancouver real estate on steroids o_o
Morocco is next??
I think Ken did a really really good job. He did better than I expected.
This episode was so quick.
3:15 FIRE KEN!!! Lol no, but The reason why i say this is because $45K divided by 1meter squared (10,000 cm squared) actually equals $4.50 for each centimeter. Either way I still couldnt afford it. Great video nonetheless!????????????????
Geography now PAKISTAN. Please!
Actually "ü" and "ë" both occur in French words, although they are rare. For example: "aigüe", "ambigüe", "Noël" ;)
CHARRLLESSS LECCCLLEERRCCC
Ken is like half of this channel.
From the MOST densely populated country to the LEAST densely populated country!
Actually the letters ü and ë exist in french. Examples : ciguë, ambiguë, Saül, etc
ahh i can’t wait for mongolia
Surprisingly cheap parking fares
The display at 0:25 is partially incorrect. While Meghan Markle (top-left) was in fact made a Princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to the Duke of Sussex, Wallis Simpson (top-right) was explicitly forbidden from using the same style upon her marriage to the Duke of Windsor because, as a divorcée with living ex-husbands, she was prohibited from marrying into the British Royal Family.
Love this alphabetical order thing. Super ritsy, urbanized and tiny Monaco and then vast, empty, enourmous, and crazy rustic Mongolia right in the next episode
Hate to burst your bubble but small blunder Roger Moore has died this year. But he will will live on forever as one of the best James Bonds.
I LOVE YOU KEN...
The Monocan language kind of sound like sounds like French pronounced like English and with more separations between words.
Small but expensive
No, if one m2 is 45 000 $ then one cm2 would be 4.5 $ , not 450 $ since 1 m2 is 10 000 cm2s.
The visualss????
$45,000 per square meter works out to $4.50 per square centimeter. It's time to learn arithmetic... NOW!
12:52 Those are not Leclerc tanks.
Last time I watched this, it was 7AM and couldn't understand anything Lesson: Don't watch videos right when you wake up
I think Ken should be fired just because he wore a dirty t-shirt, yucky.
Ken did a great job! Don't be too mean to him lol
Didn’t roger moore die? And i think bono lives in villefranche-sur-mer
Casino royale poker scene was filmed in Montenegro not Monaco, just saying
Wallis Simpson wasn’t technically a princess and neither is Meghan Markle... honest mistake lol
Of all of your sidekicks Ken is def my fav by far. Good to see him get more time on show other then one line puns. Good episode btw. Loved the sarcastic remarks very much. Cheers! Santé!
Man, square cm would be $4.50 because is is... well... squared. So, in square meter there is 10 000 of them.
France should just annex them. Tax havens like this should be criminalized by international law.
Rih-Rih do you remember me from Monaco? I gave you one like this? Yes! I still have it! aw
Yay! Ken's not in the dungeon today! ??
Hey, Geography Now! Please explain the provinces and territories of Canada for the next Filler Week episode.

In 1971, Monaco won the Eurovision Song Contest for the only time in its history. However, Monaco had no suitable venue to host in 1972, and also couldn't provide any of the other requirements. Instead, the honor of hosting went to the UK again, where it was held in Scotland.
From most densely populated to least densely populated we go
12:15 Monaco has a mouth with broken teeth lol

Things I hate 1. People who make lists 2. people who edit their comments 3. people who ask for likes 4. people who over excessively use emojis ??Like if you agree ??????????????
Btw that’s not how conversion from square metre to square cm works.. 45000€ per square metre equals 450€ per square decimetre equals 4.50€ per square centimetre.
Barby! Flag Friday - error to correct - there are 10000 square cm in a square m, not 100. Therefore it would only cost 4.50 per square centimetre.
2:21 that's an Israeli bus of "Egged", I didn't know they started operating in Monaco ??
6:39 isnt this channel supposed to be family friendly?
Casino Royale is in Montenegro in the James Bond movie.
Don't wanting to be the douche, but being one, the square centimeter in Monaco is actually only 4.5 Euros.
0:27 it’s so we can get a bunch of personal unions when they don’t have an heir. I’m sorry I play too much eu4

My hometown which is 5 miles long, and is an island, has more people living here than in monaco. This town’s packed with 82,000 people.
You find the ë in french...like in the name noël
Please note: the correct standard SI and NIST symbol for kilometers is "km", not "KM".
You can find Ë in French, by the way! Some names & Noël have it.
While I love the way you spelled Grace Kelly as Kelley, her spelling was, sniff, sniff, Kelly.

Where are you from anyway
I am pretty much sure no one in the comments will thank you for doing their country on this episode.
yeet your business into Monaco ????
Finally Mongolia, I have been waiting for this country for a long time. I am Chinese but I know nothing about our closest neighbor.
This is offensive to Indonesian :v
12:21 Monaco = Sinterklaas!
It's somewhat strange that a wealthy place have a noisy F1 racing around the country which is dense anyway, yeah it's almost 100 years old, but still.
Wow amazing and such a small country
We do actually in French use the letter ë, like in Noël (Chirstmas)
"The country is also shaped like a praying giraffe" Now that you said it,I can't look at it in another way.
"Now this is gonna be pretty interesting because you would think, 'Monaco is so small, how on Earth could they have any natural resources or landscape?'" Well, you already told us that they are reclaiming land from the sea which makes real estate a resource. In a world with rising temperatures, subsequently melting icecaps, and subsequently rising sea levels, that much is pretty impressive. That suggests to me that resources on the sea floor are something becoming increasingly available to them. You also mentioned a fishing yacht club which would suggest fishing as a resource.
So this is the first time I've watched a video from you and now you got another sub.
Barbs, we're talking about the world outside the USA. So it's not five miles. It's eight kilometers.
11:44 Nole
1 square meter = 10000 square cm
Yay Ken wohoooooòoooooooooooooo
I knew my country wasn´t the only animal shaped one. (Costa Rica)
"so that means that the current prins is half american" that doesnt make sense
I believe 1 sqm equals 10000 sq cm. 45,000/sqm, then 4.5 /sq cm. Am I right?
Wallis Simson was never styler a princess or her royal highness. She was instead styled Her Grace the Duchess of Windsor
12:06 nice teeth Monaco
Please, don't do Morocco, just skip it. I've seen a lot of your videos, enough to know that you will get a lot of facts wrong. And if you do (I know you will), 1 . don't oversimplify everything about western sahara and berber culture? 2. don"t make jokes about anything (you are not funny) and 3. make sure to mention that we have the best cannabis in the world.
Well, A square centimeter would be $ 4.50 because 10 000 square centimeters fit in a squre meter 1 m^2= 100^2 cm^2 and, $45000/10000=$4.5. Still, it is the cost of a good meal in Portugal so, quite expensive.
AND PORTUGAL MAN?
Sorry but we have ë and ü in French too :)
Plz we want more of Ken
The mongols!
4.5$ / cm^2
OMG! At 2:25minutes into the video, You used an EGGED/??? bus (the main bus company in Israel)! Very funny but I caught the mistake!
"ë" exist in french for some words like "Noël" (Christmas)
45.000€ / m² 1 m² has 10.000 cm² (100x100) soooo.....a cm² is not 450€ but 4,50€. Youre welcome. ;)
Technically Thierry Herny or kylian mbappe both played in club Monaco but born in France ???? and ????
PEE NUT BUTT HER
I like the informality of the background. Sometimes a blank background doesn't give enough color or personality, meaning all you see is Paul talking. Ps. More Noah please.
Ken you are asuwm
Wait for it .... THE MONGOLS *que Mongoltage Can't wait
Poor noah.. i hope hes alright
Why these tiny states exist? Healthy people from big state to keep their money there? Just wondering.
Imagine there was a GeographyNow during the time of the Holy Roman Empire
about time mongolia com next i wast waiting for this one C:
Wallis Simpson didn’t really get to be a princess
Hey Barby! To my knowledge, the Dutch hugely contributed to the land reclamation projects in the UAE, so not sure if the joke is the right order there. Also Flevoland (the biggest project carried out in the Netherlands) is of bigger landmass than things like the palm islands in UAE. I love watching your videos, keep up the great content.
How can there a such thing as a “native” to a 2 square km area?
Yeah but what’s the 1st most visited Grand Prix track?
It seems like Barbs needs to hit the gym again. Those fat layers were accumulating.
This is actually a pretty cool video. Like it’s funny and very informational and I’ve been watching for A WHILE lol, but this ones a keeper! Saying hi from Downey and Disneyland!
2:22 ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ???????? ?? ????
I don’t like Monaco at all, not the episode, Barby did a great job. It’s just that this richfuckistan for billionaires doesn’t appeal to me, common people basically don’t exist. Just a 4 km strip of ultra luxury, royalty, casinos and massive spending. No thank you
Hey Geography Now, there are a mistake in the value of the sq cm of Monaco. If the value of the sq meter is 45,000, then the sq cm has only 4.5 dollars, not 450. That's because a sq meter hasn't 100 sq cm, but 10,000. So that's the real number you have to divide it for
Land of hoity-toity.
I don’t think they’ve realized it yet but the Maldives video got taken down
Is it bad that I like the office background better?
Dubai has NOTHING on the Netherlands....we MADE Dubai! :)
I love this video so much!!! I can know about a gardener in the whole entire nation. And I'm so sorry that Noah had a car accident. Well, you have a great day and I can remember about Monaco. See you on the Fan Flag Friday video. Bye-Bye!!!
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY : It's a very long street with tall buildings. Moving on to the demographics!
There is no such thing as a french monegasque citizen. This tax thing applies to french citizens living in Monaco.
I think Monaco has the French added value tax rate of 20 %
The best episode ever
"by law if there are no heirs to the Monegasque throne the rule would pass to France" France sharpens guillotine
Paul & Ken, name a better duo, I’ll wait.

Lily Safra was married to Edmond Safra, who founded the bank Safra with his father. Today many in the Safra family are listed at the top20 richest people in Brazil.
8:28 French actually has the Ë. Example: noël (christmas)
Of course you can take a plane there. Just mask it as skydiving lessons.
I can't wait for the Mongolia episode
Can you make an geography now of the Netherlands?
How is it that you’re getting handsomer by every video? ??????
3:03 The UAE might be going meh, but it's the Dutch that got them all those specially shaped islands.
Nice processed video ?? ... Pleaseee next SLOVAKIA ????
There's 10000 square centimeters in a square meter so a square centimeter would actually only cost $4.50.
“What ever keeps me employed!” -Best Joke ever
Finally , mongolia is up next. Waited for my country since china episode
Menton and Roquebrune are probably kicking themselves for seceeding.
8:53 I think it's over. New constitution revokes an ultimate transfer to France
To sum up the history.. Money money money money and more money!!!????????????
Hate to correct you but Casino royale was in montenegro, not monaco.
There are 10,000 square cm in a square meter, so it "only" costs 4.5 dollars per square cm... Still ridiculously expensive, though :D
This will probably be the only episode withouth the "I'm from this country!" comments - they're just too rich to watch youtube :D
I went to Monaco to meet my lawyers and flew back in a helicopter
Please keep Ken and give him more lines! He's great! :)
As a Brit, I am personally disgusted that you referred to Mrs. Wallis Simpson as a princess. Firstly, she was a duchess (she became the Duchess of Windsor almost as a courtesy title for marrying the former Edward VIII, who only got the title because he was the new King's brother), and secondly, she was a right b** who took advantage of the Royal Family's wealth and status and spent it frivolously. Apart from that... good episode.
how are these google maps 3d shots made?
Monaco's a country?
Hi there! We do use letters like "ë" in French, like in "ambiguë" (ambiguous) or "Noël" (Christmas). And even "ü", seldomly. Thanks for the video!
There are actually 10,000 square centimetres in a square metre as a metre is 100 centimetres. If you multiply the two sides of a metre by metre square to work out the area, you get 100cm x 100cm, so 10,000cm^2. This means the actual cost per square centimetre is actually $4.5.
5:50 Diz nuts
Or, in a nutshell, it is a financial gangster country for tax evaders who are damaging the prosperity of the EU.
btw Saracens=arabs :)
Barby with another AWESOME Video
????...????...???? yeah
Square cm would be worth $4.5 not $450! Still insane. Love your vids xx :)
Praying Giraffe. I get ypur joke because ots Christian. What I am dissapointed about is SOOOOOOOO Good
3:17 incorrect it would be 4.50
Please do a video of Spain
Monte Carlo !
Can u be my geography teacher?
Can't wait for Netherlands !
8:02 : POP
Ken!! <3
10:06 That was a damn funny skit XD
What if we have no Land but only water and some islands and the ocean floor can get REALLY deep. (Subnautica)
This video was excellent, I think the only things it missed are the how many Russians are living there, which I'm pretty curious to know. I lost count of the amount of supercars with Russian registration plates I saw back in May and a number of the AirBnb listings were Russian owned as well. You can even take a train to Russia from Monaco once a week via Nice Ville. Although it's pretty expensive and the required transit visa for Belarus and Russian tourist visa out it out of reach. Other than that, there's also lots of cool underground tunnels and elevators that are a little bit hidden, but make getting around even more interesting. Especially if trying to cross the road at Saint-Devote.
Awww... you totally glossed over the circus. Monaco doesn't have "just" a circus. They are holding a yearly festival in it and give out the equivalent of the academy awards, but for circus ring live performances! (also the tv coverage of the event is waaay more interesting, because they show the performances and cut all the award ceremony and "thank-you" sobstory BS to a minimum)
my computer froze at 10:10 and at first i thought its a special effect, but then it restarted
2:22 As a cultural Jew, I cannot help but to love that you used a stock photograph of an Israeli Egged autobus. Nice. Or should I say “Nice”? Ehyehyehyehyehye (even though you cannot tell which pronunciation to use with which word: the English adjective or the French proper noun)
I wonder though can duel nationals gamble there? Or is it a case of you still have our passport so no.
snob mode on 45,000$ per square meter = 4.5$ per square centimeter ( (1/100)^2 ) snob mode off And as usually great job!
How is this over 10 minutes long?
Loving the motion graphics and map work on this one...
You made a conversion error : 45000 per m² makes 4,5 per cm². Since it is an area, the value must be divided by 10000, not 100 ;)
3:22 ISRAELI BUS SPOTTED
If that woman has 1,400 square meters of land and real estate is worth $45,000 per square meter. Doesn't that mean she's working on $63,000,000 worth of land?
I cried when you said 'monaco has a ton of pools but no natural lakes????????
Damn monaco fc ! its poor club,shaming its city, selling good players and now hammered 4 goals at home! Every local should donate them money!??
Je suis monégasque
correction: you can find both ü and ë in french. Examples include: ambigüe, noël
How many square centimeters go into a square meter? ...
Finally! MONGOLIA is next! ????
Now I will never be able to unsee that praying giraffe
guys ken is so fking cute CHANGE MY MIND
Monaco to Mongolia is a pretty dramatic shift in population density.
A square meter is (100 cm)(100 cm) 10,000 square centimeters. That would make Monaco real estate cost $4.50 per square centimeter.
a cm² will cost 4,5 euros not 450
Cassino Royale takes place in Montenegro, not Monaco
Roger Moore is dead
Love the channel, but triggered by your maths. 1 square centimeter would cost $4.50, not $450
Never clicked so fast.
Really nice video, even if it's not to the YT space. Nice sound and I like this background (maybe, do something for the door, but... It's a minor upgrade). I stay tuned ;)
4:59 When your house gets randomly mentioned in a Geography now video.
Poland upside down.
Monaco: Hey Indonesia, may I copy your homework? Indonesia: Sure thing man! Just change it up a bit so that the teacher won’t find out. Monaco: Nah, fam. I’m sure nobody would ever notice.
Only people from US call football "soccer" xDD
Ut Uberiores Divites
Oh Ken, you're my fav!
I live in Monaco ???? and what you say was true and it must had been a difficult job for all those research
The funny (or maybe sad) thing about Ken's involvement in this episode is his usage in this actually seems like the greatest insult to him so far: Locked in a cage in the basement - obviously a joke. Getting fired for practically no reason - obviously a joke. Generalized an expensive burden - obviously a joke. Being needed in the episode because nobody else showed up - actually kinda seems like there's a little bit of truth to that.
OMG!! what a basic mistake you made!! 1 square meter = 100cm × 100cm = 10000 square centimeters. Therefore 1 square centimeter would be $45000/10000 = $4.50 (still quite expensive...) You should remake the episode Geometry Now! and explain how surface and volume units work!!
From the most densely populated country to the least densely populated... this is going to be interesting.
Charles Leclerc will be the most famous person from Monaco when he gets those WDC
But do they have an independent foreign policy?
Awsm videos... I absolutely love this channel even though the fact is I don't have geography as a subject in my stream...! I love his content... I am ever waiting for your episode on the United States.... ??
Flag stealer
Every country should be a tax Haven.
Indonesia ...!!! Indonesia ...!!! Oh ... Wait!
1 m2 = 10,000 cm2 , son you are off by a factor 100
I am so looking forward to the episode when you guys will cover my home country, Norway. Great episode by the way.
I am hyped for Mongolia! I was in Monaco myself quite a few times. It's a nice place but definitly not where i would want to live. Way too many snobs ^^
Ringo starr*plays Thomas the tank engine theme*
I prefer this background lol
13 minutes about a country smaller than most villages
I honestly like your office background with the postcards. It's really not that bad lol
Roger Moore passed away in May 2017...
I can't stop seeing the praying giraffe now
lol you could find your house on the map of your nation
Hey Barbs, love your work....but...(there is always a but)...dude you are looking really tired. I hope the new house isn't working you to death.
If you do another filler week, can you do Kosovo?
Regarding food specialties, both socca and fougasse are also from Provence and from Nice. With different places claiming they make the right one.
i actually like this background better
One nitpick. There are 10,000 cm^2 in a square meter. Therefore the average real estate costs is $4.50 per cm^2.
I think you made a mistake in the video. 1m^2=10000cm^2, not 100cm^2
I subscribe because all of you guys are hot lol
11:56 What happens to me when I ask my female friend out.
He’s a hot guy (and intelligent)
Sees Mongolia in the distance
So why did you used a dutch Sinterklaas head for Monaco on 12:18? kinda funny
Great Episode as always! Just one small thing: actually 1 sq m = 100x100cm = 10,000 sq cm, making one sq cm a 10,000th part of a sq m, so the price for one is 4,50€ and not 45,-€ as mentioned in the episode ;)
i love the way you explain history
I visited Monaco last month. The Oceanographic Museum is amazing!
A square meter has 100x100=10,000 square cms in it, so 1 square cm is worth "only" 4.5$
A square meter has 10000 square cm, thus a square cm is 4,5$ ;)
Lol you keep running that soccer/football joke even though 90% of all countries in the world agree on calling it football.
Bad math - 1sq meter is 10,000 sq Cm = $4.5 Now I need to wait quietly to Friday
2:24 An unintentional commercial to Israel's largest public transportation company, Egged :-D
There are 10 000 cm² to a m², not 100. So a cm² of land would be 4,50$, not 450$.
I never heard of anyone hanging a picture in their closet.
Square meter is 100cm x 100cm = 10,000cm squared, so $45,000 / 10,000 = $4.5 per square cm.
1 cm^2 would be 4.5$ if 1 m^2 is 45.000$. I advice you to stick with the Geography there Barby! Geometry clearly isn't your thing :D
Novak Djokovic has a houses like all around the world he is hella rich ik he is best in the world and he is a serb like nikola tesla
Could you explain you’re release scheduled, cause I don’t understand it. PS they should show this at school because it’s so much more interesting, love it.
Money money money money money
Awesome video. I have to see the Grand Prix in Monaco one day. I think every Formula 1 fan wants to
*4,5 dollars for one cm2
They hate us cause they aint us.
man the vatican city episode is gonna be amazing.
I once visited Monaco for 6 hours maybe ... ironically I saw almost all the top notable sites. I loved this country actually
top 1%? more like: TOP 33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333%
Wait for it! The mongols! Do a collaboration with john green!
As always great episode. However 3:00, which country created land in the sea for Dubai look it up :) greetings from holland!
12:18 Thats actually the hat of sinterklaas. The guy everyone hates on except Dutchies. The best people of course??
3:15 the math is wrong, it's supposed to be 4.50$!
well 45000 euros for a square meter is 4,5 euros for a sauare cm but whatever
Mongolia!!!!
I actually like the fact that this is filmed in your office! The postcards provide a really cool background. Now you just need a closet door. ;)
So interesting. I taught in France, near to Monaco, and the French people I met do NOT consider Monaco a country - maybe, nation at best. I was told Monaco is incorporated into the French educational system, and that teachers (who are placed around France when applying to work in public schools) could be posted to Monaco. Not sure if misinformation, but everyone I spoke to was very surprised to hear Americans consider Monaco a separate entity.
I thought it would be a great place to live in ...but then I learned that Bono lives there.
Ken FTW! Woot! woot!
Wait for it... THE MONGOLS! INSERT MONGOLTAGE
Well you should actually get some guy to schedule your filming studio... Like, for example, me....
blue flags mate
If it's $45,000 per sqr meter, would it not be $4.50 per sqr cm?
NOT MONTENEGRO!!!!!!
OK I admit I was looking forward to this episode because of the Formula 1 :)
ALRIGGGGGHTTTT
once you mentioned Mary Poppins I was like "This episode is absolutely amazing!!!!"
Where's Gretchen, a singer of Brazil? ????
When one handful of soil in Monaco is higher than my salary...
moni moni moni many moni
DO GEOGRAPHY NOW NORWAY
8:26 ë exists in French though
Only micro nation to win Eurovision! In 1971
Mongolia ha... Interesting... There is a monument for Genghis Khan with maps of great nations of steppes : Xiongnu Uls, Turk Uls, Mongol Uls...
Plz make geography now vedio on Pakistan
Me as a kid:Nah just a small country! Me as a adult: Wow very interesting country!??. Edit:thanks for 400 like ??
oh god not the mongolians??
Money,money more money.....that is true! when I was 17y old back in 1998. I was in Monaco(it is a state but capital is Monte Carlo which Barbs you have failed to mention) there were no such skyscrapers but still it was expensive....0.33l coca cola can was 15 franks.... when i tried to enter casino dude did not let me in...so i asked why? well you dont have a tie....???....we invented it!!! no!..and so i do not know how it looks like from inside.Hotel de Paris was 3 nights during the grand prix 13000DEM....I am sure that it is money money more money nowdays! one more thing IF SOMEONE HAS PLANS TO TRAVEL THERE THERE ARE NO THEFT IN MONACO!why? soon as you scream THIEF they close the borders....unless the Robin Hood is Usain Bolt with turbo jet in his behind there is no way he will be able to run away.... and one of the residents is Goran Ivaniševic too,besides Novak. Griteengs to all the Geography Now comunity from Croatia!
Do somalia please
Monaco "Ravioli Ravioli, give me all your money-oli!"
1sq meter is 10 000 sq centimetes not 100. haha..
Dude I love Mongolia. Can't wait for the next episode
I prefer this setting over the YouTube space
How on earth do they fit a Marathon into Monaco? The entire country is 4k long!
3:16 NOPE. It’s $4.50. Do the math. If a square meter is $45000, a SQUARE CENTIMETER is $4.50. Not $450
Honestly I kinda like Barby's office as a set.
can t wait for tunisia
I went to Monaco when I was living in Bordeaux a few years ago. The country was alright but it just seemed like any French city. Marseille and Nice are much nicer in my opinion on the French Mediterranean
Hahahaha you’r pronouncing novak djokoviv so bad
Does Monaco have much of a military?
Marvellous to see Ken taking such a positive and significant role in his show these days. Sorry to hear about Noah too by the way. Hope he didn't have to wait too long for help.
Mongolia is gonna be epic!
Awesome episode as always guys, just one question How is there government departments like? Eg do they have a health department and if so is it like Australias where the government pays for most of it or like the USA where if you can't affordit then your stuffed?
Washington DC has larger GDP per capita and x20 larger population than Monaco
11:22. Charles Leclerc spotted. Where's Matt?
I guess the people who go there have no qualms nor misgivings for an “adjoining helicopter transfer”. ———Husband: “Honey, lo and behold, a helicopter. It’s only 1000.00 dollars for 5 minute ride. Forget about the cab. Let’s go!”
I will never unsee the giraffe
As a Brit, I can't wait for the UK episode. Maybe you'll teach me a thing or two ;-)
From most to least densely populated
wow Monaco is so rich love from india
yee my country is nextt
I kinda like it better in your house than in the youtube studio.
I prefer the postcard background as opposed to the black boring one
Monaco: Less of a country, more of a country club.
Mongolia after Monaco. How much more different can countries get from one another?
I like your t-shirt
first time Ken appeared i thought he was pretending to be Keith
This was one of your best episodes (yet). It's a shame that the rest of the team wasn't available; But honestly the episode was better without them. Ken was a pleasant delight.
Nice closet.
A few days ago I found a guy here in the comments on YouTube who doubted that Monaco is a sovereign state...
Mongolia is next? Excited throat singing
I really look forward to new country videos from this channel. The editing of this video, with the 3D aerial views was particularly impressive. And Ken's segment was very cool - he deserves more non-island screen time. But, for crying out loud, *Fontvieille (1:20), *Fontvieille (2:11), *Fontvieille (2:54).
8:25 Technically the letters "ü" and "ë" also exist in the french language, like in "ambigüe" or "Noël", but they are quite rare.
Is the Monegasque Prince Albert I THE Prince Albert, of genital piercing fame?
You forgot to divide by 100 twice
Wait a second, how do they have an international marathon if their country is only 2k wide... something doesn’t add up here ??
Dang, and here I was hoping to refer to the peoples of Monoco as Monocles. I guess that Monegasques works too...
45000 per square meter wouldn't mean 450 per square centimeter, it'd be 4.50
Office shmoffice! This is the best show on youtube, and possibly in the world! I might be overstating things, but you get what I mean. You guys are the ginchiest!!
Sitting here still waiting for New Zealand
I watched this just because I love Formula 1. ??????
What app is used for the 3d maps
Monaco more like MoneyCo
My favourite part of history is $$$$$
hey I love your series and started following so many countries ago I don't even remember. I binge watched almost all your episodes and they're so much fun and entertaining and educational. have you ever thought about what your long-term plans are, after you finish all the countries? I imagine you might revamp some older videos, but what are you thinking about doing after all the countries? keep doing what ur doing barbs + amazing team, yall rock
Why does the UAE get the "cute" comment on land reclemation when the Netherlands are king in this area?
1:02 "The country is shaped like a praying giraffe" HAHAHA You made my day!
Hey Paul just a little side-note: I've been following your series for I-can't-tell-how-long time and have always appreciated the content you have put in all of your videos. However, coming from a Ligurian-speaking family, it did bewilder me hearing you say "Genoese dialect of Italian", since the Ligurian Language (all the different dialects) shares enough differences from the Italian language to be classified as a totally distinct, full fledged language. Ofc the Ligurian language devoids of a grammar nor does it share a common writing system used by the different dialects, yet the ligurian language ( Monegasque included) retains quite a rich literature, especially Barocque, which would/could save the language from extiction provided it were taught in schools. The dialect issue came into place as soon as another language I dearly love, Italian, took possession of much of the writings (from literature to even pieces of legislation) even before Italy was even formed. Therefore, as Italian became the prestige language, it wasn't even put much of a fuss to standardize Ligurian( let alone in Monaco and France). By and by Italian grew stronger and it is well known how it ended up. Aside from that, gz for all the effort you put into your work, you deserve way more both in views and appreciation.
Wait, Casino Royale was filmed in Montenegro am i right?
Isn’t this the country that the Madagascar crew trashed!
Concerning the ü and ë, in french we have both of these
Very nice video ! Just a short comment about sports : - The football club deserved further description. The club remains among the big European clubs, they reached the final of the Champions League in 2004 and they recently had very great players such as Kylian Mbappé, Radamel Falco or Thierry Henry (current coach). - Monte Carlo Master is one of the famous Masters in the world but it doesn't take place in Monaco, the tournament is in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin (France).
I saw a Doug Demuro video where he went to Monaco... iT hAS SomE seRiOus caR cuLtUre...
It is a religious rich Giraffe!
from Nice airport to Monaco Ville is some more than 8 miles. It is around 20 km, so 16 miles ;)
Charles Leclerc - F1 World Champion 2019
If it's $45,000 per square metre.. it would be $4.50 per square centmetre... But centi stands for 100.. yes .. but squared it's 10,000. There are 10,000 square centimetres in a square metre. ..and i'm like only a cat.
FIRST!!!
Was by far the strangest place I have ever been, there were shops selling yachts, like a corner shop
Hah! Prince Albert, I know a guy with a Prince Albert
8:55 So if Monaco would have no heir, would it become a part of France or would the President become King? Then it would be similar to Andorra.
What is this perfect country? man wish I was born there :(
Oh boy, trade your luxury car for a wild horse before next episode ^^ Also I confirm that we baguettes usually think of Monaco as just a city of in SE France... Only when we drive there, we get to be like "oh, huh... it's actually a country" x)
Are there Monaco geographers?
What videos will you do if you have covered all the countries recognized by the UN?
You forget to say that between 1793 and 1814 it was integrated to France, whith the name of "Fort Hercules" :)
Yes for mongoloa next
I just will say that your office is amazing and if you said "this is were we will record all episodes from nos on" i wouldn't be mad at all
I can't wait mongolia mongolia MONGOLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
ken ken ken ken!!
11:46 she does nothing, but the safra name indicates correlation with a brazilian bank.
Looks like an Indonesian flag
ü and ë letters do exist in French
Hi
the reclamation efforts of the U.A.E. use Dutch companies to do them, so yay Dutch.
If La Jolla in San Diego CA became its own nation, it would be much like Monaco. Yes, San Diego has the richest communities by zip code in the US (Rancho Santa Fe, unincorporated but along the city limits). And in the winter, they spend it in Palm Desert (my town I live in). +
I live in monaco but i speak Italian
Mongolia next! Badass! Don't forget your horse milk and vodka! Hot damn!
Have a drink every time Barbs mentions Genghis Khan in the Mongolia episode. ??
Indonesia... Oh sorry
5:48 I am proud to be the first author of Russian Wikipedia article about socca (although it is named „farinata“ with mentioning „socca“ and „faina“ inside)...
Other than the actual information about Monaco, what have I learned today... 1. Ken is really hilarious (Barby.Don't.Fire.Ken.Please.) 2. I really wanna go to Monaco and explore now
Everyone loves Ken!
Is that True Monaco Grand Prix every year also held inside French area? From what i know, Start and Finish line inside French area.
Is grace Kelly Irish at all her surname is very Irish
at 2:22 , is this an Egged bus? like the ones in israel?
wheres kens dungeon tho do a house tour and show us
Ken was really good
Wait, you're telling me my University is bigger than this entire country? Sweet
Do yemen
Ken is awesome
Cannot wait for you to get to Mongolia just because they’re the exception
still just waiting for my country, who else is?
I love the new graphics and visual effects like zooming in and showing the buildings
Damn, Lily Safra is from my home state and I never heard of her.
Ken doing great job ????.
Didn't Casino Royal play in Montenegro?
Get into Monaco....!? Challenge accepted.
I dont think the Youtube studio exists!
Convenient that the most densely populated country is followed by the least densely populated country
2:22 is that the eged bus company from Israel?
And they said European nations do not have kings and queens.Ha!
Your office isn't that bad of a studio, looks quite in-theme! Looking forward to Mongolia BTW.
I went here at the age of 3 :p
When can you please do Northern Ireland as its own vid and not part of the uk
That moment you realise you've just been trolled 14:21 ????
so im 21 and i didnt even know up to this video ( and the 0-4 battering of As Monaco by my team) that monaco was actually a country lmao , not to be racist but i really tought monaco was just a really rich part of Nice XD
Love From #IKhulna_Bangladesh.
Hi I am a subscriber and I love ur channel
MONGOLIA YES! Been waiting forever for this!
The country is shaped like praying giraffe = ROFL ??
Hyped for Mongolia!
Out of all Formula 1 drivers who resides in Monaco, you chose to mention Esteban Gutierrez?! Bruh...
friggin love this show XD
I love Ken, he's so cute????. I wonder if he's single ????
I hope there's a clip of Tulga a Mongolian strongman from AGT in the Mongolia video
You did not mention the Rally Monte-Carlo
sounds like the san francisco of europe.
Why do I always think these videos are a waste of time and yet I get stuck watching them to the end ?? I now know too many random things about random places ... thank you for this
isnt the "e" you have shown used in Noel?
Do one for Somalia ????
????? ??? ??? ?? ????? ??? ???. ??? ????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ?????.
Can you do one video on NEPAL.. THE LAND OF BUDDHA... please... ??????
Small correction - Wallis Simpson never became a princess, just a Duchess. Otherwise, great stuff as always!
10000cm square =1sqm ..... Barbs failed math
I’m so excited for Mongolia I’m gonna go watch the one on Kazakhstan
Cote d'azur (costa azzurra) belongs to italy
Little Liechtenstein vs Mini Monaco
45000$/meter^2 would be 4,5$/centimeter^2
Ah.... All of these familiar Formula 1 drivers ??
First view!!!
Casino Royale was on Metenegro
MONACO IS INTERESTING
more of ken please
it's time to learn geography NOOOW
Ken rocked his segment!
The animation in this episode is amazing
ë letter exists in french Great video!
Hehe Micro-states are fun to talk about??
Great work! Worth the wait!
3:04 The dutch made the palm islands in the UAE
IMO, they should at least throw a seaplane base there, where the heliport is.
Novak Djokovic speaks eight languages? I'm pretty sure that's Roger Federer
So.... you tried to bash the sh*t imperial system, but epically failed, cause you don't know how to calculate area properly.
bendera nya kurang panjang dikit mas
I was literally just thinking about Mongolia wondering if you had a video on it.
So excited for Montenegro
Mongolia : The guy who had a glorious past and now is a shadow of it's former self.
10:12 hahaha funnyest moment
i guess we can say, Italy is Monaco's mother, but when it hit the right age, it was from then on raised by its father, France
Monaco is almost like Poland If you know what I mean... :)
I'm excited for the Philippine episode with Ken
It's free expensive real estate
Money money more money
"Shaped like a praying giraffe" I cannot unsee that anymore.
You outdid yourself with these animations. Kudos to the team!
Sup Barb, i'm Mongolian and if any question for a next one i'm happy to answering questions(in case of if you got any)...
Great video. But the letter ë exists in French. Just look at my name :)
I like Ken's segments :)
m is the most boring
Film more episodes in your office, it looks so good!
French subtitle for a french country please
Can you please do Oman
I was supposed to be born at Monaco but it was too expensive now I am a nicois
NEXT COUNTRY!! ::Mongolia????????
12:20 Monaco = Sinterklaas
anyone from Monaco here?
AC Monaco is struggling in football
As a F1 fan, I really enjoyed this video.
Damn the animations, love it!
At 3:00 ; the land reclamation in the UAE is literally done by Dutch companies, although I don't understand this little sketch anyways as the Netherlands has the largest reclaimed landmass on earth (Flevoland)
We go from the most densely populated nation in the world to the least
I went to Monaco once and hated it.. srsly ppl. there are bossy af, but they have nice police officers at least. Tho I met monagese scouts, they were cool Also Monaco betrayed it's Italian ancestry by franconising, which Grimaldi who found the country wanted to avoid under all circumstances.. well done not
I like this way more than the ones with black background, this is more personal :)
I am waiting for "T" so because I from Turkey!!???????????????? And.. ????????????My Turkic brother Turkmenistan!
Barbs, at 13:18 you wrote Patrons, not Patreons
I've been to Monaco, and it is like going to a theme park where you watch rich people do stuff honestly. We even brought our meal, because everything there was crazy expensive. You could see the rich in the biggest yachts I've ever seen, in some of the craziest luxury cars of the world... It was surreal, it was like going straight to a different world. I also noticed that all the workers came from bordering towns in France. I mean, it's quite ugly, nothing special but like something freaky. However, I would recommend the old town, it's italian-ish and really cute, almost the same as Nice's old town!
NO TAXES!
YYEEEEEEEEESSS!!!
You do find the ë in French, it's in my name Raphaël And as far as I am aware I am a "pure" French
I went over the Summer whilst I was in Nice. It is an interesting place and worth a one day visit, but overall it was kind of uninteresting. Also love the channel.
Can 20 million people fit in iceland,tonga,samoa and singapore??????
3:20 It would be $4.5 per sq cm.....not $450
Sounds cool
Charles LeClerc future WDC!
Ë this letter is used in French
Ce pays est une grosse blague ! :)
Nice! is a city in italy
Does Monaco have a Police force or Law enforcement authority or do the French help out with that as well?
Can I get a like it’s my birthday
square metre is 1 times 1 and 100 centi times 100 centi that means sq metre is 10 000 square centi that makes 45 000 divided by 10 000 so its 4.5 bucks per sq centi just wanna be clear you always have to divide area with area not length edit I still love you guys though just wanna make sure
Money money more money! :)
"ë" does exists in french, it is used, for example, in the word noël, meaning Christmas
I was thinking Morocco even the first minutes of video
Monaco is absolutely my favorite European nation! Would love to visit again.
Marrying a Prince doesn't make you a Princess.... Meghan Markle is a Duchess. You have to be the Daughter/Son of a King or Prince/Princess to become one.
Happy diwali to all the geography now subscribers
Cool! I would really like to go to Monaco. But meh, I cannot afford it.
They finally mentioned formula one. ?????????????????? Now all that's left for me is Philippines and South Africa
I thought Monaco was part of France because on the map I couldn't even find Monaco when I saw it I thought it was a place in France but I can't believe Monaco is a country could be that small and rich
10:14 loooool!!! XD
Monaco is basically the Las Vegas of Europe. But like 10x smaller and richer at the same time.
The animations are looking amazing! Good job to Ken.
Fun fact monaco is the only micro state that has won eurovision
Will you make a Netherlands video
Am I the only one who actually digs the office setting for episodes? It reminds me of Crash Course!
I LIVE IN MONACO! Ask me any questions and I will try my best to answer them!
This reminds me of tapakapa.
Yeah GREAT episode but..... don't film in front of a Closet...
WOOOHOOOOOOHHH!!! Ken acted a Dutchman????
50 years later: It's time to learn Geography OW! MY BACK! Where's Ken?
The least-densely populated country (Mongolia) is alphabetically right after the most-densely populated country (Monaco)... that's a cool coincidence !
Make a video about URUGUAY!!!!!!
New episode is here! After many centuries, the dream came true. (just kidding, don't take it seriously, haters)
the shirt from Czech republic episode is back
Saracens? You know, "Saracen" is just an old big European umbrella term for all Muslims...
r/Giraffesdontexist
Nice graphics
Oh you did not show Wallis Simpson at 0:26 ??
Tbh the Netherlands is king in defending against the sea so stop it with the mention because we are the kings noone else is.
During the Friendzone part, the marina looks like a wide open, smiling mouth with very bad teeth.
Barby, you’ve gotta crack at least one except the Mongols joke a la Crash Course History.
Yeah ringo you know, that guy who did something in the 60s........
Ken is the best. Yeah even better than Noah.
I always whistle along to the outro without even thinking haha
Wallis Simpson was never a princess, she was the Duchess of Windsor. Megan Markle isn't a princess yet she is the Duchess of Sussex until her brother-in-law becomes king.
Incredible! You have made 10 minutes video about Monako without answering the question: Why are they independent?
Mabuhay! Monaco from the Philippines. Hello to all Filipinos who live there ??
When is coming romania???
KEN! And "money money more money"
Looking forward for Mongolia ??
Forgot that's a country. That'd embarrassing.
LOL, why is there an Israeli bus ("Egged") going from Nice to Monaco at 2:23?)))
Yay Novak was featured????????????
Turkey,Please
This episode is about the most densely populated country in the world... and the next one is the least densely populated, where you literally have heavy trucks driving through the desert. Lol
I had to look up more photos of Charles Leclerc... what a beauty, I am now thirsty XD
That's Indonesian flag. LOL
Please do SLOVENIA!!!!??
Oh, look! Poland!
You spelled FONTVIEILLE AS FONTVIELLE there is an "i" between the E and the L
Finally!!!
Respect your'e bus line suggestion featured the Green Israeli Egged Bus ??
????MOOOONNNNGGGGOOOLLLLLIIIIIIAAAAA????
I love you Ken!!!
Who are from MONACO.
Keep the good work handsome
Daniel Riccardo is the king of Monaco until next Grand Prix.
Where do they get the dirt for the reclaimation?
Wallis Simpson was not a princess she was a poster model for the gold digga that almost made it but didn't,   Camilla parker bowles is the is the one that made it. but it took a very very long long long long long long long time gold digga that is
Are you going to do a The Netherlands episode
Pretty good video Actually, that treaty that states that the sovereignty will pass to France if there is no Grimaldi heir was abolished, so if there is no Grimaldi, Monaco will stay independent
Am I the only one that is not comfortable by the fact that the closet is open?
U.A.E. doesn't seem to be impressed, but actually the reclamation of the land from the sea at U.A.E. also was done by a company from the Netherlands XD
Maaaaaaaybe should not have used an American Abrahams tank when mentioning the French military. *triggered Frenchmen in the comments?*
Great episode and very informative. Just two small corrections, if I may. First. the agreement with France about the male heir was made in the early 1950s but cancelled sometime in the 2000s. Second, Socca comes from Nice and can only be found there. Even if it is being sold in Monaco, it certainly does not originate there. :) Also, fun fact: I think that helipocter transfers start from 250€ per person.
why does the flag look like my country's Indonesian flag
I've seen a good chunk of Monaco and been to the exotic garden. It was... alright.
talk about sweden
OFFENDED ! YOU DIDN'T PUT MAX VERSTAPPEN IN THE F1 RACERS THAT OWN PROPERTY THERE
Apparently you can't walk into Monaco.
We Greeks USED to call Monaco "Monoikos". And it was a long time ago...like in ancient times
There's 10000 square centimeters in a square meter, not 100. So the value would be 4.50$, not 450$
Next : Mongolia Montenegro Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands New Zealand
I'm still waiting for a Geography Now for Singapore.
I need more ken videos!! XD
Grace.Kelly.
Yay im here before 50K views
God damn, they're rich.
4-0
Now The opposite of Monaco - Poland ????
I don’t think it was 8 kilometres?
Kindly make one about the Philippines. ??
I was in Monaco a few years back, took an early train from Nice, and when I arrived, you could literally feel the wealth because of pure sunshine, the cars, and the beautiful coast. Also the Oceanographique Musée is Amazing.
French has the ë with the word Noël for example, which means Christmas.
What about Anomaly
Nice visual effect on the map... LOVE u Ken.. :D
Ghengis Kahn: “The entire World is coming up next!” ???? ??
What’s the outro song
i like how mongolia is right after monaco and its the least densely populated nation in the world
So many typos, Barb. Most especially... Grace KELLY. No second ‘e’... Please work on your production in the area of text—not just filming quality. ??
A square centimeter is not one one hundredth the size of a square meter. It's one ten thousandth. So a square centimeter would cost 4.50.
Wow Im very early! Too bad this is one of the video he did in his office...
Still waiting for the Pakistan episode
Ah, Monaco, the place that used to be culturally Italian and linguistically Ligurian until it was surrounded by France. Anyway, a beautiful place, I live in Italy, but it takes me, like, 30 minutes to get there by car, so I've been in Monaco more times than I could count, and it really is great in everything
So small yet so interesting! Great episode Barbs. Next up is the great exception, the MOOOOOONGOOOOOOLLLS
5:20 That pause ??
The next episode, wait for it...THE MONGOLS
??? ????? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ?? ???
Monaco was a Greek colony too? Nice
He didn't mention Thierry Henry
Woow! This episode was pretty organic. Good jop as always. Greetings from Puerto Rico.
yeah my country !! finally :)
is there a diffrent betwen monaco and indonesia flag ?
From most densd country to least densd
Better setup than usual
Do Pakistan next please
Just got back from a trip here two weeks ago, you should have mentioned the other option to reach Monaco: A $200 taxi! I wish I would've known about the $1.50 bus.
Can't separate F1 and monaco ??
Wait for it...
Jos jedna epizoda pa Crna Gora!
Ahh, football. Great sport. Also, great video! Ken did a good job
HE MENTIONED CHARLES LECLERC Now I'm happy
Apologizing for wrong pronunciations throughout the whole episode but not acknowledging how you absolutely butchered 'Saracens'! JK, great video, Barbs!
I feel so poor after watching this video. Lol
I’m here because of SENNA
Its better you filmed it at your office because of its postcard, maps and flags background. Nice! ??????
Your french is strange.
Hmmm, not sure about the maths on that sq m to sq cm conversion
????????????????
The math is incorrect, if 1 sqaure meter is $45,000 then 1 sqaure cm is $4.50, are 100cm x 100cm = 10,000 cm sqaured not 100
Actually monaco was a greek colony during the roman era :)
None of those American women became princess's they are dutchess's because they dont have any high class blood
Wow, Monaco has more yearly events than the entirety of Russia!
I burst into laughter at "money money more money." That's probably my favorite line y'all have had thus far
Wait wasn’t ken fired
DAGHE MUNEGU
now to patiently wait for Montenegro
SECOND (of course after Paul B.)
Actually Ken did it better than Paul.. oh wait ... pls dont kill me!!
If a square metre is $45.000, that means a centimetre is $4,50, since it's no regular units but squared units, so the conversion is quadratical
Sharlllll
I can't unsee the praying giraffe
@geography now do one about Nepal
Why not one episode on Hong-Kong ?
But the ë & ü are in french if i'm right. I have french classes and i know that these probably are language. Or i have witnessed something stupid that i believe now.
It's nice to see you more berbs... And I'm super hyped about Mongolia episode!!!
am i the only one waiting for russia?
Ken knocked it out of the park. MORE KEN!!!
Hey, I have my Geo channel and all the countries we're done
"The flight only takes 7 minutes long" I loved that. Great video! :)
They stole my flag, kurwa!
I think you meant 'ligue 1 champions' instead of "champions league". Because they never won that one.
Kirain Indonesia........
13:13 Hungary*
Real excited for Mongolia! I recently watched a documentary and I really want to visit!
Aragón is not Spain
I like that you have used the Israeli "Egged" old city bus at 2:24
Lool UEA saying that’s cute but the Dutch build that land in the UAE so shut tf up UAE??????
You can get two-150sqm for that price in iran
Please make an episode about russia..
Lily Safra married a billionaire (Edmond Safra), that's how she got rich pretty much
...and the French are secretly hoping that the royal family won't have a male heir so they can take over.
So how Monaco survived when France got capitulated in WW2?
Monaco and San Marino are like remnants of that Feudal City State past.
JUST -MONIKA- MONACO
Woah woah way to just gloss over the money laundering seems like it’s kinda important to talk about no?
why ken have an eye higher than the other one??
Monaco: Money, Money, Money and more Money
First to comment ??????????
NO NOAH JUST KEN
You forgot some money at 11:10
Interesting, Monegasque language seems to me,a Romanian sounds more familiar than French A se revede literally means to meet-again in Romanian
Hi.
Monaco isn’t the second smallest nation, San Marino is.
well done! Mongolia is next... wow!
I thought I was happy and anxious to know more about Monaco.... until Barb said that the next episode is Mongolia............. and I'm an Iraqi ??.......... living in Poland??
What are you gonna do once you are done with every country are you gonna make another channel or stop YouTube or something?????
Monaco = leech
Imagine if a Indonesian Foot ball team is playing againts a Foot ball team from Monaco, lets see how confused they get when they see the flag.
Money money more money
So Monaco's the Clown Car Country, is what you're saying.
Early.
Wow, don't tell Ken, but he did quite well ??
Monaco is interesting but because is mainly for very rich people...I say a NO NO. :) I prefer to have fun with cool regular people. But if I had few millions...hmmm...maybe I will have a different opinion :):):)
Do not say soccer. It is FOOTBALL.
the only thing i know about this country is that the flag is the same as ours
Can somebody put a brazilian portuguese in this video???
Damn, those graphics!!!!
Gotta admit the non-black background was a bit hard to get used to and a bit distracting, but well, you literally had no choice. Anyway, great episode as always Barbs!!!
Slight correction: the French do use "ë". For instance, Christmas is "Noël".
if that performance doesn't get Ken a raise i don't know what will.
Royality??????
Republic of Molossia!!!!
Go Geography Now best channel on YouTube ????????????????
Make Turkey Please
ooooh i've been waiting for this one! just a quick side note, at 10:51 you wrote "Geonoa" when it's actually "Genova" or "Genoa", but otherwise great video! :)
#kenforpresident2020
You forgot Mbappe!!!!!
?? The Monaco flag similiar with my country flag (Indonesia). Oh man, this country very small than Jakarta capital region ??
Chhhhaaaaarllllll- Matthew Gallagher ??
????????????????????
Monaco is Italy.
Love to Monaco from us rich people who don't like payin' taxes! :-D
So monaco from the ancient Greeks means "One House" ? is this some kind of game of thrones reference?
Depending on the season; the national food of Mongolia is either Huushuur(summer) or Buuz(winter)
Hey nice video, but Casino Royale is in Montenegro, not in Monaco
so it really easy for France to get it back just make sure the prince ends up in a hospital somehow when he needs surgery and give him a bonus vascetomy before he has children offcourse
It's such a luxurious place that I'll most likely never afford to travel to. Hahaha
Thank you. I'm going to Nice next winter and now I'm gonna have to add one or 2 more days to my trip to explore Monaco. Perfect timing lol
Mongolia is a land of alcohol, pride and drunk alley fights at 3AM that won’t let me sleep.
Mongolia!!!! Fuxxin finally! ??
what! Indonesia?! oh, that's Monaco...
France, Italy, Germany, even Equatorial Guinea... Is time for Spain!
I can’t wait to see the Mongolia episode!
Grace Kelly is spelled Kelly not Kelley
Actually surprised that you managed to make a video about Monaco last more than 10 minutes ??
Great episode but Casino Royale lies in Montenegro (filmed in Czechia) in the movie and the fictional town of Royale-les-Eaux in Northern France in the original novel.
7:58 Monaco Ethnicity - Poland and Indonesia
Monaco to me looks like an elephant head. Also how do they use the euro as their currency if they are not part of the EU?
Letters ë and ü are found in French words! Technically they are e and u with a diacritic like à, è, é, ç have diacritics in French as well as you can see
first thing I saw in Monaco was Karl Lagerfelds big ass white Villa
Mongolia !!!
half of mongolias populations lives in the capital city which caused horrid air pollution due to yurts. the government is almost relient on china however alot of mongolians want closer ties and trade with the west. the birth rate in mongolia is the highest in east asia. but it struggles with child abuse and making young children ride horses which had led to, i mean alot of death due to the heads being crushed. culturally mongolia follows the tibetan branch of buddhism with the tallest indoor buddhist statue. however some people still practices shaminism. Islam is predominant of the kazack minority
Money money and more money xD
Money money and more money
Hey so why are monaco’s billionaires so scared to... Oh wait he said the joke first...
And you can also walk the entire length of Russia in 1 hour right?
Does the Prince of Monaco have US citizenship and have to pay tax on his global earnings ?
Your show is amazing. Keep it up!
Awesome
This episode you could say you had a micro-cast for a microstate
13:11 Distant throat singing
Novaak Djokovic
OH YES MONGOLIA WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS ABOUT
Hey Barbs! I'm looking forward to the Mongolia episode, it seems to be quite an intriguing country. Expecting to learn some cool stuff. Hope you live up to the expectations.
Amazing phisical geography
forgot to mention they got rekt by club Brugge 0-4
The netherlands next?
When you know the whole country blindly because F1...
I hope Ken does the Philippines episode. ????
Half-American KING ? I THINK WE NEED TO LIBERATE MONACO
Hey, you included Meghan Markle in the American princesses and she married into the British royal family not Monaco's . Love the videos!!
11:09 Money, Money, more Money :D
Again an amazing knowledge about tiny country . Make one on my country Pakistan ???? ????????????????????????????????????????
From the most dense to the least dense
I was twice in Monaco, really chill place. My dad even met Prince Albert while waiting for me and my mom outside of a shop
I do not understand the scheduling problem. Can't Noah just beat someone up in order to fix the issue?
F1 fan anyone?
finding answer for, why it's flag are the same as indonesia. seems like barb didn't know it,
from the most densely populated country to the least for next week
Barb do more episode about francophone countries("Québec",The Carabeans,ex-French Africa etc...) cuz it's really cool and interesting as always....... DO THE FRENCH REGIONS NEXT PLEASE!!!!!
So small you see regular sized buildings on the map. Wack
I was named after Prince Rainier!! I was happy you didn't slaughter the name. Great episode!
Oh boy I can't wait for Mongolia!
You can tell how pissed Barby is in this episode haha
Hello ?? I'm living near Monaco so I can give my experience about this place : - walking in ???? is very impressive. there are so many buildings built really close to each others. - Bc of the lack of space, there is so much underground tunnel for cars but also for people only. these tunnels are very clean - globally all the country is very clean, the path is colorful (compared to France) and being in Monaco give you this felling when you are in a very luxurious Hotel. - The most popular place is probably the Casino. If front of it, there is a little roundabout and Sooo much luxurious cars are parked : Maserati, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Jaguar, and a lot of Rollce-Royces. - The train station in completely build underground but not like the big cities : to go out you just have to take a little tunnel and without taking stairs, you find yourself on the road. - During Summer the city organizes some Fireworks with a theme (I watched the Portugal one) - Globally the whole French Riviera is very rich, especially the cities in front of the see. The houses are very luxurious, and some are gigantic. I visited the house of the Russian n°3 of gaz and he had: one parking with around 10 magnificent cars, 2 buildings (3 floors) with one smimming pool for each. One of the smimming pool was literally around 200 square meters ?? - The littoral is deserved by 4 roads : three are along the mountain who faces the see and the Highway is impressive : we surfed between sky, see and mountains bc there is tons of tunnels, bridges above the valleys. - This region is very cool, the climate is very soft especially during winter. I'm going to school with only shirt and sweat whereas we are in November. So if you visit Europe one day, don't forget to chek the Mediterranean cost. if you like luxous and altitude, French riviera is made for you but if you prefer big cities and spaces : The Spanish cost is nice and the Italian one too (near Roma). if you have any suggestion, say it ^^
Yo why doesn't he have 2M subs yet?
So you can buy a square mm for 45 $ still cant afford it
Haha... they got the title in 16-17 and then got absolutely DESTROYED by PSG 7-1 XD Well that was dreadful XD AND 16-17 THEY EVEN WENT TO THE SEMIS IN THE UCL XDXDXDXD
YES Hannover was mentioned
???When France protects Monaco
Ken did a great job hosting
So, let me get this straight, we will get from the smallest functional nation, with the highest population density, to the nation that was responsable for the greatest continous empire world that the world has ever seen, which today has the smalest population density in the world?
3:18 Wrong. There are 10000 sq cm in a sq m.
At 8:26 you said that the letter ë is not in the french langage or the italian langage, but In French, we use it. (For exemple, the word Christmas in french is: Noël)
Monaco FC ain’t so hot this season
This is ... ummmm..... interesting
I will never be able to unsee the praying giraffe
In Monaco you find the hottest farmer ever!
Can't wait for flag Friday ???? ???? ????
Monaco to Mongolia. A place that is packed with people to a place that seems like nothing
Wrong barbs in French we have an e that has 2 dots like ë
Hey, today we are celebrating Diwali (Or festival of lights) and this is a good gift. ????
ü ë should be also in German
LOVEEE
Ya boy got that israeli bus
I’m not good with Math but the calculation in 3:15 isn’t it a bit odd? Correct me please...
YoU fOrGoT StEfAnO cOlEtTi Basically, He's the crappy Version of Charles Leclerc
"whatever keeps me employed." I like his attitude.
Yo Barbz, funny fact: The Palm island in the UAE is made by a Dutch company...
Monaco and Indonesia have the same flag's colour but different size. Give like if you are Indonesian and Monageques :)
Geography now, Vietnam Reason: im a Vietnamese.
Indonesia its way more better then monaco love from japan
2:23 hey! this is an Israeli bus!
I had been waiting for this since the letter M started.
Hey hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco
Ken is so adorable ??
Rich country
10:29 I looked away for a sec and heard that they’re celebrating “princess hangover”
Please Monaco, take Bono for yourselfs. Thanks from all of Ireland.
GG Ken..
When will u do singapore
INDONESIA PANCASILA!
I have been there, not to boast. Beautiful country! I was in Monte Carlo, or Port Hercule. I landed in Nice and took the train with my family. Very expensive apartments I remember, in the real estate street businesses.
Ken is cute ??
Bro Roger Moore doesn't live there anymore... He died last year
Cyprus doesn't have an all-time circus... and Monaco has... HOW? WHY? I HATE MY LIFE!
8:29 these two letters do exist in french ! In words like Noël (Christmas) or capharnaüm (mess).
My fav episode.
Well done bruts.. Cheers 2 the assistant
Ken > Barby
Lily Safra is a very peculiar figure (she is a philantropist, social activist, like many billionaires who don't really have a real job, but want o appear prodcutive): she has married three or four times with millionaires or billionaires. Her last husband died in a very mysterious way in their Monaco penthouse, he was one of the billionaire Safra Brothers who have built a banking empire in Brazil. Altough controversial she has donated lots os money to charity and is specially reagarded by the Jewish community in Brazil and abroad. There is an unathorized biography of her called "Gilded Lilly" that is not really well written, but has all the salacious details of her very sercretive life.
Holy cow! It was going to be released today?!
I Love Monaco???? And I Love Poland???? I am From Indonesia ????
the netherlands!!!!
The flag though
Is the Netherlands going to go under the T or the N?, I would personaly put it under the N because the dutch name for the country is Nederland. Keep up the great videos!
Monaco is an awesome place! So busy but very pretty.
Fitting that you have uploaded this less than 24 hours after AS Monaco's 4-0 defeat at home to Club Brugges
Can't wait for ?????? ???? (Mongol Ulus.
How long have you and ken been friends?
The Brazilian lady you don't know what she does... Her late husband had banks and she invested in real estate herself.
MONGOLIA!!!!!
Anyone here speak the Monegasque language?
Wallis Simpson never was a princess though
Any one noticed that when ken put the water on him he already was wet?
Can't wait for the Ukraine episode
Does Monaco have more reclaimed land percentage wise than the Netherlands
I hope Noah’s okay
if i ever go to Monaco it would be Nice but only a day trip without spending any money lol
Thanks for football ??
can’t wait for Mongolia????????????????????
I was Monaco, pretty country and most of the stuff you mentioned I saw, would recommend anyone who has time and money to visit this place. (Though Nice is the best town)
I'm waitin to change ricciardo with Charles LeCrelc as a f1 fan you pissed me off
I hear "Prince Albert", I think "Prince Albert piercing" ?? sorry folks
After Mongolia is Montenegro write ?
Another Great video! Thanks
Finally mongolia When i first watch Geography now I thought i can watch it in july But 4 months later we are finally here lol proud ????
2 square kilometer area yet 4 kilometers of coast - IMPRESSIVE! ??
go Ken!
Barby, Saracens are Arabs. The Europeans back in the day called Arabs Saracens.
Didn't find you cheerful in this episode which you generally are.
I bet 5 imaginary Austro Canadian pesos that Barb won't pin or reply to my comment
They should change the country's name to Moneyco
It's remarkable how there is always a significant amount of Belgians in those luxurious coastal cities. Especially in Spanish cities, such as Marbella, Benidorm, Ibiza ...
0:58 ha... this video is only an hour ago
Monaco football team is one of the most succesful french team. (Well, not this year obviously). They are part of the "big four" of the league with PSG, OL and OM. They are reputated to be one of the most succesful football formation center (I don't know how you call that in english, I just merely translated word by word from french). Stars like Henry, Trezeguet or more recently Mbappé came from ASMonaco
What about Morocco?
Flag look like indonesian flag.
Love your channel
I actually quite like the postcard background
Background TOO COMPLICATED
In Indonesia, some people still debating about which one the first country to use Red and White flag. ?? But I think Monaco first.
Wallis simpson is NOT a Princess
From most densely populated to least populated. It's gonna be wild next episode. Also, love to Monaco from Luxembourg! Micro buddies!
Europes little Singapure
2:20 Didn't know Israeli buses go to Monaco
Mongolia episode: Yurt gonna love it
Do Kanye West next
Flag of Monaco similiar to flag of Indonesia. The different is in scale ratio of the flag
definitely not Indonesia
I'm really sorry Barbs but you did not just say that the U.A.E. is better at land reclamation than the Netherlands. We invented it, we have the largest and oldest artificial Island and pretty much the entire western half of our country is reclaimed teritory from the sea. If there's anyone good at dealing with water it's we Dutch.
When I visited Monaco 14 years ago, there was no McDonald's :D
roger moore died by the way.
Flag of Monaco is similiar to flag of Indonesia. But, the different is in scale ratio
fan flag friday will be really fun, greeting from your twin flag country
only countries that must be bombed are these micro nation tax havens
Monaco : What if Central Park had a King and a Casino.
I was able to visit Monaco in July of 2014 (although it rained hard that day). It's amazing how surreal it all seemed to me. I got to visit the Buddha Bar! Also I'd like to point out that the next episode will be the exact opposite in terms of population density which I find fantastic... for some reason. EDIT: I forgot to mention that they have PUBLIC TOILETS by the port.
I've been to Monaco. Visited the cathedral, oceanographic museum, Japanese gardens and saw Prince's Palace (outside). Nice place. It was day tour from Nice.
Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Im tired to asking for that come on!
Monaco Monacan make a lot of Monomoney $€£¥ ??
Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken. Do it now or your fired.. KEN I SWEAR
Where is geography now turkey
I actually like the office setting it's colorful and pleasing to the eyes. The black background was okay but I think this one is actually better. But except the closet at the back i hope put something to cover that. Haha. I kinda really like this background. Maybe put some more interesting things like maybe a statue? Or a globe? I dont know anything perhaps something thatll rep the country you're discussing. Hehe. Ive been watching since the A episodes haha. Still gonna watch even after my country the Philippines! Hehe I'm trying to write something too to send to ur email. Hope it could help for your research for the the Philippines episode. More power to GN!
“Oh and the country is shaped like a praying giraffe” only fact need to know facts here on Geography Now
I'm always fooled whenever you show Monaco's flag thinking it is Indonesia
indonesia again?
Can't wait for the mongolia episode!!! I like mongolia!????
SACCA THESE NUTS
MONACO!
2:21 israely bus HAHA
As a mongolian i waited this news for 2 years.
Yay Mongolia!!im not even Mongolian or a citizen but Yay!!
So france managed to get a county of itself outside the EU to escape regulation and create this lil rich tax haven? Got it.
12:22 dang Monaco needs to brush they're teeth
The letters ü and ë are actually uncommon but used in French (but the accent is considered a modifier, so not a full letter): they serve to indicate that two letters should not be pronounced together if they are usually. For example "Aigüe"/"Aiguë" (=acute, both variants exist), or "Cigüe"/"Ciguë" (=hemlock, idem): the "u" is pronounced ([egy] and [sigy]), as opposed to "Aigue" or "Cigue" ([?g] and [sig], the first is an old word for water, aquamarine = "aigue-marine", the second does not exist). And for the ë, it is one of the four e accents with é, è and ê ("Noël"=Christmas, "poële"=stove)
Hong Kong: Hold my beer on the skyscrapers and my reclamation Macau: Hold my beer on my casinos Btw, I do hope that you do Hong Kong and Macau even if they aren't countries. So that people know they aren't just skyscrapers and/or casinos
RESTORE THE QING!
I’m waiting so much the Poland video
Time for Poland ??
Monaco looks like an amputated sea horse to me
9:57 Looks perfect =D
Anyone else want to know why there is a picture frame hanging on the wall in the closet?
please make something about the Philippines
HM
Every RECOGNIZED micronation (No, not you Liberland and Sealand) in Europe is tiny principalities that still existed a millennium or more ago, but they were bigger in those days.
Excellent video. However you made one small mistake at 8:27 The letter ë does exist in French, like for instance in "Noël", which means "Christmas"
in 2:22 the 100 bus line is Israeli Egged city bus?
Like the new background barbs
It's funny that here in France many people consider Monaco as a French city rather than as an independent country
I thought the city was called Monte Carlo
I would rather you record videos in your office than in the studio. Stay cool stay tune????
I am excited for every new episode
I've had the pleasure of visiting Monaco about a month before the Grand Prix in 2010. Probably the most humble (price wise) place in the country is the ironically named "Casino" Supermarket. Believe it or not, there's not only a car park but also a tourist shop within the famous tunnel under the Hotel de Paris. The funny thing is the car park me and my family parked in had toilets (bathrooms) had what I think of as "flattering lighting", in other words the lighting makes it seem like everyone has a healthy sun tan ??
What? I think it is Indonesia.. You should remake the Indonesia episode, it was too simple
CANNOT UNSEE THAT PRAYING GIRAFFE
I like ken Though he’s been out of your dungeon to much Barbie
Also I suggest you should have had mentioned why is Monaco so small
You should’ve mentioned the Grimaldi curse that the monks allegedly put on the royal family for disguising themselves to take the fortress.
Cool
Monaco looks like a knight Chess
The difference between Monaco and the next county, mongolia, could not be bigger.. :)
Happy Diwali to all my friends ??
I swear, Paul looks more and more like a snack every video. He’s hot. ????
Thank you for saying football as well ^^
Yay, Indonesia again
Monaco
501th!!!!
I went bankrupt from just watching this episode.
1:05 A pray giraffe country shape, very intersting =D
The only time I think Olivier Beretta will ever be featured in a video above 1 mil views...
What is soccer?
Can you do sweden some time
I didn't know Indonesia had a second name
Shoutout to my fellow peeps who cannot afford a sq cm of Monaco!
Oh Mongolia, my favourite history subject!
Boy I love ken, can we get more of him. He’s great
Oh, I’m a little early I guess, do Uruguay u hear nothing about it lol
12:45 France is their best France...
Dang it I forgot this was Geography Now and not Formula 1
Nice video i want to go to monaco
a n y w a y
YAZZZZZZZZZZ GEOGRA-PEEEEEPSSS
Ken got his maths wrong, there are 10000 square centimetres in a square meter (100 × 100) meaning a square centimetre of real estate is $4.50 on average
Monaco's flag looks exactly like Indonesia's lag :P
Wasn't Roger Moore dead?
The green bus is egged bus in Israel lol
My country <3
MONEY MONEY AND MORE MONEY
Monaco fc played in the Champions final against Porto at home and lost the game????
As Indonesian, i'm going "hmmmmmm"
Close to Philippines episode
So does Ken just hang out on the floor for every episode? 3:13
11:22 Charles Leclerc Matthew Gallagher intensifies
No Prince Albert in a can joke, denied.
kiko
Pls.. Do the Philippines????
"it looks like a praying girrafe" I can't unsee it
11:22 SHAAAAAAAARL
Je me amor monsgasques
You messed up the history, its Ligurians then Greeks (then Romans and Franks but no matter) and then Saracens
If you have so high real estate and commodity prices, what's the need for taxes. Just like Dubai.
Oh US people and the metric system...
A shady place whose only purpose is enabling the one percent to avoid paying any taxes. Crap like this is why poverty exists.
you should have a video about the international system of units and the body parts the US has to measure stuff
kenny got hot. when? ??
Ahh my 3 least Favorit contry after Luxemburg and Lichtenstein
Can you please do Yemen next please
A very informative video about a very rich micro state and you have nailed it again, Barby. Keep it up! My suggestion for your next video is the Netherlands, I hope one day I will see that video on your channel.
#JusticeForKen
We want more of Ken in Geography Now!
We do use ü and ë in French though
1:04 that looks more like a gun
video about nepal please
10000 sq cm = 1 sq m so land actually costs $ 4.5 per sq cm
I really liked Ken's section. He's gotten better at presenting
I'll be honest, when I saw the thumbnail I thought, "I already saw the Indonesia episode" and then I checked the preview title. "Oh right, Monaco." clicks
Need Indonesia Subtitle Please ????
two little sidenotes: - AS Monaco (the country's football/soccer team) is basically a talent farm; for example, Kylian Mbappé played for the team before going to PSG. - on the famous people, i would also mention Daniel Elena which is the co-driver of the famous french rally driver Sebastien Loeb (they won nine world rally championships between 2004 and 2012).
Monaco has the ugliest denture
"Whatever keeps me employed!" Next episode: "Ken, you're fired!"
Yes, Mini Monaco has been covered!!
I actually can't see anything except a praying giraffe staring at me now. Geography Now teaches you what you want to know and what you NEED to know!
french subtitle please
Finally
1 cm2 is worth 4.5 dollars then..... Yeah, check it....
Very informative video, probably as close as I will ever get to Monaco. Thanks for the info. Now please give Ken a raise or a new place to live...like the garage. ;-)
One day I will live there or Luxembourg
Oh yeah Mongolia!
10.2k views ready? Guess I'm late. Oh well
No caption lol
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE!
It looks more like a lobster, honestly.
With those googly eyes Monaco looks like it's stupidly grinning, with very bad teeth.
que que
monaco history ..... money, money, money, money, more money <--- lol !! Moneyco oops i mean Moneyco .... errr .... Monaco yea ~
WHO LIVES IN A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF ITALY? ...
Wait for it....
Step 1. Hire a mercenary army Step 2. Invade Monaco Step 3 ....... Step 4. Take all the cash and get the hell out of there before the French arrives Step 5. Profit?
Ken is love, Ken is life
Loving the 3D graphics of Monaco in the vid!
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE
It's 3:45 in the morning no biggie
Getting hyped for the upcoming throat singing
Just Monaco
A thing that make me interest with this video is...flag. Love Indonesia from Malaysia.
I want Ken to spunk in my mouth
If you are a crazy hitchhiker like me, you can also go down from the gas station on the highway over Monaco, winding road without a shoulder (medium safe, but it is possible) :D
somehow the video is not availible for me there is an error code "Watch-ID: SCG1bz3YKnsk256D"
now i cannot see monaco, without thinking of a praying giraffe
Casino Royale is Montenegro, not Monaco
YES DANIEL RICCIARDO, JENSON BUTTON AND CHARLES LECLERC GOT MENTIONED YES CHARLES GOOD LUCK AT FERRARI NEXT SEASON... but Felipe Massa didn’t ??
finally early !!!!!!
If this place was next to america the americans would tax the crap out of it and try to get rid of the prince if he didnt play ball.
U just forgot that Monaco was not always this small It was big but France just occupied 70% of the land
sorry bro quality of this episode is not that good
Good
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais, ça serait cool des sous-titres en français merci.
1080p when
Imagine what would happen if u put a bomb in the middle of the monaco...
Hello brothers and sisters from another.... uh.... flag! ????????
Keep giving those small descriptions in famous people segment! I appreciate it very much!
Why don't you use a black curtain as the background like you did it in the last episode
Il live in Monaco and everything was pretty accurate, good job!
Indonesians will be not impressed with the similarity of the flag...
About the brasilian bilionair: the Safra family owns a huge bank here.
Wow Indonesia is this rich (Sorry JK)
I love your French pronunciations! ??
why is the quality so bad
why won't they just join france?
“The French army protects them” so their defense sucks
6:30 Or you could have duel citizenship.
THEY CHANGED THAT!!! "if there's no heirs the rule would pass to France"
So Monaco has almost the same amount of people as this video has pixels? Hehe
Please do a video about my country Nepal
Free advertising for Formula One, lol.
The country that is almost the same with indonesia (flag)
12:30 Hah, Monaco has bad teeth
I love this place
First when i saw the thumbnail, i think this is Indonesia Episode. When i Check the Title oof it's Monaco. And why only in 360p
Sq cm would be 4.5$ btw.. 1 sq m = 10000 sq cm
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????
Casino royale, occured in montenegro, not monaco
Guyz, Plz Fix The 360p only Problem
12:10 It shape looks like evil-laughing person...
Is it just me or its stuck at 360p ?Do i need to sacrifice Ken to get 1080p ?
I am Cambodian and i study with a north korean and they are actually friendly but rather quiet and they actually use gmail facebook and live freely like normal freshman.
MONEYYYYY
$45,000 per square meter = $4.50 per square centimeter 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters
can't wait for Saudi Arabia
Money talks!
"If you're on a budget" Then you're in the wrong place!
Thanks for getting me on 90 in my Geography Test
0:14 Casino Royale was in Montenegro.
Isn't Monaco a French city?
Now am I early or not?
F1 monaco gp
Yay! You guys mentioned F1! In Monaco episode!.. Which really shouldn't be that surprising.. :/
The episode I've been waiting for!!
Actually ü and ë exist in French Before the reform of French orthography from 1990 ü didn't but it now does — even if it's not always used. Ë always existed though and is constantly used.
Happy diwali

So did you talk about the Prince's children?....
11:48 Can we just take a week or so to appreciate the beautiful chin of Coulthard SO square, so sharp, just amazing, absolutely incredible
11:22 SHAAAARLLL
no comments except for replies? neat!
so low quality
yo did you just reupload the Indonesia episode?
Je comprends toujours pas pourquoi Monaco n'est pas une part de la France (Ah oui,les taxes mdr) Nan mais plus sérieusement il manque juste du bleu derrière le blanc de leurs drapeau et on est bon
Mongolia finally!!! Been waiting for Mongolia almost all of my lifetime
this is the original red and white flag of Monaco. Indonesia flags is edit copy paste of red and white from monaco .
Monaco ????????????
When you are literally the entire agricultural sector.
45000€ per m² would equal only 4.5€ per cm²
Hey look, it's still 360p I'm early Edit: here's some jokes "Is iT InDoNeSiA?2?2?2??2"
Great presentation as always
The flags of Poland, Indonesia and Monaco always confuses me.
No puns in the episode DISAPPOINTED
Dude it 360 quality yo
The quality i-
I love Barb & Ken, they're Batman & Robin or Del Boy & Rodney. ??
You know you're early when 1080p isn't available yet
Indonesia!!! Oh wait...
Micro states are alway interesting
All this time I thought monaco was a city in france now I know what it is ??????
You know Geography Now is not Geography Now without Barby making Ken's life harder or is it the other way around...? ????
Finallyyyy
Love Monaco from France :)
Ah finally new episode!??????????????
M O N E Y M O N E Y M O R E M O N E Y
oh ok
Ken, at least for now, is not fired!
????????
So basically if a Manhatten apartment was a country
For a second I was shocked if you remake the Indonesia episode from the thumbnail ????
So waiting for the Mongolia episode
poor barbs, first you find out on a live stream your friends are having a party and your not invited, then, you have to awkwardly film a video, and all your friends bailed on you. its alright mate, i know its not that big of a deal, but its alright, the postcard wall adds character to the video anyway
3:03 what country is that?
There are 100cm in 1m, however there are 10,000cm² in 1m² (100*100=10,000), so it costs more like $4.50/cm², and not $450.
Yay love the dutch reference!
I clicked so fast on the video that the HD option isn't available yet xD
Heart this comment or lose 1.2 M subs
I love microstates
When u thought it was Indonesia part 2 lol
Let us build a replica of monaco in mongolia! Yay!
Yay! Indonesia in Europe.
As mechanical engineer it really annoys me that you got the square centimeter price incroerect it should have been 4,5 euros. Apart from that keep up the good work barbz
Charles Leclerc is a future world Champion.
Finally
why dont they just join france?
omg u posted this on my mom's birthday I hope everyone will say happy birthday to her! including you barby! :)
Cannot be played on mobile devices.
Rich countries speak French: Monaco, Western Switzerland, Luxembourg. Poor countries speak English: South Sudan, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somaliland, Malawi, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Fidji, etc.
Dude, if 1sq.m is 45000 dollars, then 1sq.cm is worth of 4.5 dollars
It's 5:25am but its worth it!
Flag is looks like Indonesian flag ????
Whoa... for a really small size ...Monaco is a really interesting country
"The country is quite diverse" Shows only white people. Leftists : REEEE!
That’s a lot of money
omg i'm so early it's only 360p
I bet if Geograpeeps living in Monaco looked closely enough they can see their house in the thumbnail, crazy
As an avid F1 fan, I have been waiting for this episode for AGES. Awesome video GN!
0:15 the laugh I give to my brother when it's my turn to play with the Xbox
Video on the regions of Italy?
3:02 Oh you didn't. We dutchies get mad haha
Just putting it out there... all running gags aside (as a subscriber since Australia), Ken has a much nicer "on camera" persona and method of presentation than Noah
???? ????
It looks more like a Giraffe taking a picture with a phone
why just 360p?
Finally. Don't repeat it again, Barb.
HEY, DATS OUR FLAG Copy Cat milionarss
Indonesia flag omg
Ah, the beauty of a free capitalistic nation.
Barby, in preparation for the Mongolia episode, don't forget to mention Malaysia in the friendzone segment, because it involves the relationship between the Malaysian government and the murder of a Mongolian citizen.
I’m never looking at Monaco the same again ??
Yehey Another Episode ! ??
Ah 144p we meet again...
Is this the last principality
AWESOME CHANNEL!!! IT'S TIME TO LEARN GEOGRAPHY NOOOOOOOOW!!!!
I have heard of this country many times but never really knew where it was
Ahhh Monaco , the country with the toughest Grand Prix racetrack and the one where Iron Man 2 was shot. Huge love and respect to them from India
I'm Early bois
hey, Barb. 45,000 dollar/sq.m lead to 4.5 dollar/sq.cm since 1 sq.m. is 100x100 = 10,000 sq.cm.
I hope Noah is okay
how u treat Ken shows us that you are really good friends :D Keep it up Barbs
Nice episode, Happy diwali world
$45000 per square meter is equal to $4.5 per square cm.
so early for the first time
And all these years I thought Monaco was part of Italy.
I like this Ken guy better than Noah, he's actually funny and endearing. Noah comes off as arrogant. Sorry Noah.
It's tiny ??
Its like 5 AM, odd upload time haha.
yay
WHOOHOOO I'm not from Monaco but I was so excited for this episode since I don't know much about it. Love your videos Barbs, Love from China! -Aidan
Barby will soon be living in Monaco, and he'll invite all the Geograpeeps to his mansion

Anyone new to this channel, the series is ALPHABETICAL. Wait until your country's initial letter episode comes out
I Prefer The New Setting & Space :)
1 square metre is 10000 square centimetres. not 100
Woow
too early
One thing making me upset geography now is giving nice detail about geography and paul and is friends making nice work and also doing extreme hard work to sum up details and video recording but why on earth subscriber not increasing atleast it should have 30million subscriber for his wonderful channel .i think people are not interested in geography . To make channel promote larger im going to tell my friends and collegues watch this channel compulsory . I was searching for geography related channel some time ago but this 1000 percent wonderful . I think those watched this channel will agree. Good day paul. ????
For me, Ken can execute well than Noah. Just saying.
Hi from Malaysia
Monaco is a french garden
Indonesian Normies be like :wHaT tHe HeCk WiTh ThE fLaG
Actually you need 4.5 $ per cm2, because there are 10 000 cm2 in a m2, not 100.
Indonesia's Mirror Image
360P ! why ?
The first 100 comments are lucky
I want to hear somebody's story attempting to travel to Monaco that gone wrong due to how ridiculously expensive it is And tbh the video is longer than i expected (i expect it to be around 10 minutes lol)
Omg some dude in my French class named Ken did a project on Monaco lol

Super

Google earth is one of the best things ever
that music though
Epic video guys! Keep it up :)
geography makes us to find the mystery about the universe. Geography rocks keep exploring
Good
???????? Wondering...
Hi
THIS IS GREAT BUT MY FRIEND DOESNT SEEM TO CARE, HE IGNORED THE VID
Try this new geography puzzle app https://goo.gl/fHRTC8 #geography
it never answered the question
thats great
is this the real google??!
I am a global citizen, I love that!
I wish there were internships here in Austin, TX. I am thinking in majoring in Geography because I enjoy seeing what changes around the earth, but I want to explore more an see if this is what I really want to do. #Help
MLK
i like it
"an earthquake shake on a desert doesn't shake people" LOL this is why I love geography
Great video! I also tried to cover this on my channel glad it's consistent with other folks on youtube!
So, why are all the people in this video men?
Geography's important because its a way of life, it's the earth that's molded into something new and will keep on changing. Geography can help us get around and it fits into a lifestyle with people around the world, like back then people would live in caves or the forests. Humans and animals have adapted to the worlds geography over time.
Where are all the female geoscientists at?! I know they are out there! Young women need to see role models in videos like these! Come on Google!
Very cool
You've convinced me to take a geography class over general physical science lol
I approve this video
You can go back in time....... Over here at Bravura Media Company... we have birds-eye maps that display architecture, factories, ships and landscapes of the past.
This is why i'm a Google Earth addict.
When this will available here in Pakistan?
making dinner lol
Where are the women geographers?
This is a nice methot but guess what, I am making over 3.000$ monthly at GOSOCIALJOBS[dot]COM Check it out
Yes I know this works. I will start tonight! I found a way to make money online just go to SOCIALMEDIAMANAGER.ALLALLA.COM
Geography is a great field of study, however, imho if you want a career in it your best chance is to go into geoinformatics/GISc. Basically the more technical skill you acquire (computer science, GIS, Remote Sensing, statics, mathematics) the more valuable you are to employers in today's economy. If all else fails you at least have knowledge in computer science and math; two valuable fields that many people lack skill in. The problem is finding a good school with a decent GISc degree program.
cool I gess
It is very important. Sadly, many people don't understand the importance of geography. That is why I started my youtube channel.
Maybe people don't just study geography for a 'good job'. Geography isn't just about nobility or knowledge! You acquire a vast range of skills and understanding with Geography which is highly desired by employers. In fact, geography graduates experience one of the highest rates of employment! FACT. Geography is also not just about 'saving the world'... its about understanding the world or viewing the world through different perspectives.
/watch?v=QPHYI8WzJMA
a bit hard to hear :I
yolo (you only live once)
I could have gotten into this year's one, but I was tired on the school wide bee. :'(
It's Free. They are trying to advertise it.
they're just try to selling Google Earth, nothing more :v
wow! this video show that geography is really important.
i did not like geography before! but when you stick to it and believe you can do it,it suddenly becomes easy
I'm sorry for your job problems. It's not that much better in the US. When it comes to geography, it's one of those subject where you have to be very open and flexible. There are jobs out there which even indirectly relate to the science of space and place. Even in retail, if you work your way up the food chain, geography can become useful in terms helping to run the business and promote sustainable practice. We can blame the system until the cows come home but you have to work with it.
jobs are always hard to find :(
Jovan Cvijic was a Serbian geographer :)
I'm a peruvian geographer, in my country geography is a subestimated science, in addition my family is not in a good economic conditions, but I can say "I'm very happy to be geographer". My teacher always say me: "Geography is a difficult knowledge, because we work in both, the social an the phisycal sphere". I think the life of a geographer is hard but very satisfactory. Be a geographer requiere so much work and passion. I recomend "Geographer at work" by Peter Gould as initial book.
I like geography!!!!
"What can you do with geography?" Make a stupid video telling people what they can do with geography.
It was a pretty good statement that the video was making that geography can help you in many ways in life.
this video was really boring we had to watch it as homework for skool and it was so boring!
respect from Tbilisi, Georgia
I love geography so much!!!
Android is powered by Google... *facepalm*
rahul nagvekar won 2012 National Geographic Bee :D
google needs to make a phone and bedcovers and lots of stuff like that x3
NOTHING!... DONE!
I'm a GIS technician and I use google earth along with my ArcGIS, Erdas software and it has become one hell of a important tool. e.g. to buy new aerial photos is costly and only to use it once too look it a new building has been build is pointless, so just use google earth. Sure it's not multi-spectral images but it works.
that's good
Locate a criminal's house
anyone noticed the batman poster??? 0:47
move in with your parents, save, come to America get a masters, or the equivalent in the UK
Mount Everest!!
the problem with size distortion is that the earth is round and trying to put it on a flat screen would be like trying to put an orange peel flat on a table, some places will tear and you will need to enlarge them to join it up again
Yes, distortion is inevitable, but that's no reason to use a projection so egregiously skewed. Most people have no accurate conception of how huge Africa is, for example: In reality, it's 14 times the size of Greenland, but on Google Maps they look the same size. Scandinavia looks bigger than Mexico, but Mexico is really over twice as big. There have been plenty of projections invented that mitigate these ridiculous distortions, and their usage would improve people's common perceptions.
What, real time google earth wouldn't be a problem. People are the problem, people are fucking idiots.
3:05 The answer is gold
I don't have the intellectual capacity to read that. :/
i think that would be kinda scary.... what if i were taking a shower and someone started zooming in to me
What about privacy? I don't think real time GE is that great...
When that comes true, anyone can be a spy.
What about Ryan Bean?
I know right? Saving lives? That's totally uncool!
HUGE privacy problem then.
Still my least favorite class D:
Obviously you didn't study English.
I studied Geographie and I am female. Why do you present it as all male? I cannot believe it.
That´s kind of extreme don´t you think ? I mean we already have the ability to know when someone is home or not using Facebook. Get an a alarm and it´ll go fine ? :)
every sec bitch
Will never happen due the coverage needed from satellites. And even than it will not happen, imaging how that will help criminals or terrorist. Would be nice though
Then what do you suppose they use as the base projection? We live on a sphere, and no matter which way you look at it, you're going to distort either shape, area, distance, or azimuth if you're creating a flat map.
I agree with you on this. The message is good, but that doesn't mean there are jobs in that field. My sister and brother both have master degrees and don't make as much as I do. That doesn't make sense does it? I have a two year degree, currently working towards the rest but seriously, its quite ridiculous. Sadly, luck plays a large factor in money these days, more than it should. Good luck! :)
why not daily? or even hourly?
Were no female geographers available for this video?
That would be way too creepy... and we wouldn't have any privacy at all!
if you pay the pilots..
I'm an undergrad geography student and I approve this message!
The resolution of the best satellite sensors imagery that are available for civilian purposes are 0.75m(sqaure) . This means that 1 pixel = 0.75m(square) on the ground so unless you are huge it won't be able to spot you The US military however using the same sensors (or better ones that aren't publicly declared) is 0.5m resolution.
I'm a geography finalist. "What can you do with geography?" - should really be "What can you do with physical geography?". (I'm a human geographer)
One day :( - I don't think they allow us to use it because criminals would use it to escape from the cops and do bad things with it.
why would you want others to be able to spy on you?
Nothing.
not for free anymore maybe
Hahaha!
yeah in the future i think google earth will update every day, and our planet will be like saturnus... covered with million of satelites
That guy was so hyped when he said "I am the President of the United States... Geo spacial intelligence foundation".
google.. providing internet services even in the most desolated places like the everest
3:03 The answer is Gold.
they have it, it's illegal for the public
Lazy people will likely answer: appreciate its awesomeness. and do nothing
create maps of Earth history
Its real. Check out their gmail tap and google fibre those are the AF jokes.
I'm sure they can do it
Why would Google post an April Fool's joke on March 28th? If this was posted on the 31st I would understand that.
Is this real, or is it an AF joke?
and we can stalk our neighbors!!
That will be little scary ... could be used for spying.
So... Cameras everywhere? "Big Brother is always watching"
or one century
geography is important, but not a geography degree
YEA, and let's fill the sky of space junk.
Nice April Fools, everyone knows Geography isn't useful
Google map 8 bit.. lol :p
Maybe one day we'll have real time Google Earth! ;)
Great video to incentive studants to learn and discovery new things!
This video is great.

??????? ???? ??? ????? ?????
Can't cross the border without the paperwork? Not anymore! It is now you can't protect the border because some people who need more votes want as many illegal immigrants as possible because majority of Americans won't vote for them! and apparently America is the only country who will be called evil for wanting to protect their borders. Mexico also requires voter ID's but nobody calls them racist. But if America wants voter ID's then they are called racist.
Did you say origon it's oragan

This is great. I could fill it out with abbreviations in less than an hour. But the more I did it, I realised I only knew the mnemonics, not the state names. In example, I would know M.I.M.A.L., but I wouldn't know which "m" state it was.
I’ve got a test tomorrow on the States ?? hopefully I’ll do ok
I am in college and this video just saved me!!!!! I am a future educator and needed to memorize these once again for my social studies pedagogy class. Thanks so much, I will certainly show this to struggling students in the future.

I'm banning my sixth-grader from this folly. Most of this contrived malarky is just going to confuse someone. My daughter spent all her time trying to remember NUCK, rather than just remembering what those four states' names are. Come on.
I'm a 14 year old Canadian that only knows what Texas looks like but after watching this it really helped

In case any of you guys missed the post, I am current in the process of making yet another version of Continental Drift, this time it's the long-awaited reversed AND labeled version. In order to render the actual shapes of the continents without distortion (as presented in a projection such as this video's Mollweide globe) the video will be in VR and of course, 8K. It's the closest YouTube is getting to a website with an actual globe. The version will be based on paleomagnetic data wherever possible and a best guess if no data exists, as a result everything before 1 billion years will look different compared here. This is a developmental screenshot showing the reconstruction at 2.1 billion years. This is not how it will look in the final version. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/284792709846138882/480576663625793557/unknown.png

For viewers who have the time, follow Ur from 0:19 onwards. It contains pieces of Africa, Antarctica, Asia and Australia. Just keep your eyes on that little piece of land until it splits up at at 4:45 Why am I telling you this? Think about it, those 4 pieces were connected together the whole time for nearly 3,000,000,000 years and only then got separated. That's nearly two thirds the lifetime of the earth. That duration consisted of practically the entire history of multi-cellular life on Earth. It survived literally every supercontinent that ever existed in history! That final separation was kinda heart breaking.
Supercoll
Wow, so before land on earth is only 89%

ey man smart is the new sexy used your video without giving you credit just wanted to let you know
What is MYR?
4:45 Africa: Hey India! India: Sorry! Gotta Go Africa: No wait! India drifts away
The animation of 750 to 0 mya looks like a mixture of Chris R. Scotese's animations and the classic paleo animation.
What program do you use to make these vids?
This is good stuff
2:07 italy with no boot just a foot
What is Myr?
?????
Okay I’m not Australia I’m Thailand.
It's like watching fluids move around
Australia is emu at 4:53
x2 speed is way better for this vid

FYI this video "Smart is the new Sexy" youtube channel used two of your animation without giving you credit here: https://youtu.be/0CMkwdv8d6U

Not real
Why not in future?
I dont understand why in the past all continents form a shit and now the form is very symmetrical, the continents now have specific form in much time.
The song reminded me of the 2012 Minecraft background song... Nostalgia
NANI?! CONTINENTAL DORIFTO?!
?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ??? ? ??? ? ? ? ??? ?? ? ??? ? ??? ? ? ? ??? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ??? ??
Great Video ??????! Keep up the good work!
Myr??? What dose “r” in myr mean
And in the in milions off years
what is your source for making this animation? Where are you sourcing the data?
Thanks so much I will the
Bruh you forgot asia
how about some predictions for the future
earth is sooooo young
Supercontinent U R i wonder what U R
I showed this to my class & teacher, they loved it!
the contient drift because of the moon moving away from earth slowly and its spin is slowing down
DEJA VU!
The Story of Ur- The Longest Surviving reconizable landmass. R.I.P. Ur: -3300 Myr - -1065. Sad Face.
1 Myr = What?
When that island on the SW joins Columbia at 1620 Myr, it looks like a pair of disembodied legs kicking.
I kept track of Ur; it became Sri Lanka, and these parts of Mozambique and Antarctica..
Canarias no esta en el mapa
bullshit
This one is better.
Olha o Brasil chegando
* tokio drift music *
What does myr mean
The earth is flat ??????
0:51 the first continent... Woah Edit:nvm 2:07 Is huge
Who else attempted to watch vaalbara the whole time?
Dpg mundo, mandou abraços
I like it, this is a fun video to watch!
Great
Haha Yeet.
Water: /exists/ Land Niggas: its free real estate
I directly paused at -0 Myr
1:04 Continental Dorifto
how do you play this on reverse?
1:59 The large North American and Eurasian chunks colliding in the middle look like North Korea and South Korea lol
Supercontinent is Afro-Eurasia
This is proof that the earth is flat!
this was acutually good tho tbh
i love playdoe
Next time make it round as earth is not flat ??
yeah, some of the people think that every continent is actually standing in one place, which is wrong. They do move from one to other and connect into one or cut into more, but we can't see it, because they move REALLY SLOW.
Before the France and UK was paste
They see me rollin'…
Imagine if humans were around when the first continent was being formed.
*Deja Vu by Initial D starts playing*
Can you put together this and the animation of the future......
What data are you using to construct this simulation?
this is amazing
Imagine if modern day science institutes existed back then. "Humans are contributing to continental drift, we need to start enforcing taxes upon everybody and shaming them for existing to stop this horror that could potentially wipe out all life on Earth!!!!! but before we do that, I need to fly half way around the world for the fifth time this week to lecture those fuckers in Europe about their carbon footprint."
Cool af
4:56 rip dinosaur in -68 years ago
if you cant drift the continent, then you are no drift king
Reeeet
How do they find where pieces pf our continents were that long ago
so Indonesia used to be a peninsula.
Where did all of that land come from after UR?
Very beautiful, thanks for sharing
America fuck yeah
The Philippines consists of over 7,500 islands. How many times has it been hit to break into those many islands!?!?!?
what other people says "THE EARTH IS FLAT"
DEJA VU !!
Where's the eurobeat
If you ever make another one of these please make Eurasia just Europe and Asia
NOW: Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Europe an Asia)
DEJA VU I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
Za za za za za za za za za
My social studies teacher told me that India used to not be a part of Eurasia.
Look!!! Earth spawn a land... Damn i love god
5:03 supercontinent euafrasia? europa + asia + afrika!
Vaalbara sounds like a province in the Elder Scrolls
flat earth confirmed
I would like for someone to create a spherical version
That indian subcontinent when collided to asian continent it formed the himalayas?! So thats the impact of collision of two land massess?
DEJA VU
5:02 1 myr..
Love the music! But especially the work that put in this!!

4:28 SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA BORNS :}
nevermind
you forgot Pangea
Hoever,it got a cancer...
kew;
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this is NOT anything close to truth.
1:44 1987
My science teacher showed this to the class and I’m happy to find it :D
The earth is flat
If 'myr' means myrillion our earth is very very old
'Deja vu plays in the background'
Pangea?
IN THE FUTURE/UK: I win I never stuck to Pangaea /South East Proxima Pangaea:Aststralia will rise again some day
0:21 mom
Song name?
Where is panganea
1:10 the green looks like a guy with purple hair and a collar
The continent it's called America, and it's just one
All history of humankind is a pale flicker when being compared to the story of the planet.
L
This video makes me feel something....
0:18 when you cant think of a name for a supercontinent.
0:12 supercontinent: vaalbara
Fake lol and dumb this vid is only for kids
Cool
Astralia:No Way I am the first country in the world/ 1903 UK: Get killed Astralia/Astralia:NONONONONO /2019 UK:HELP ME /Astralia:Nope (:
What if you used Black as Europe, Algol?
Do you like my car ?
lmao wut they think the earth is an oval
2:00 Atlantica: Can we unite into 1 Continent? Others: Sure! Atlantica: Let's unite! The supercontinent Columbia is formed.
How does this work on flat earth?
Now that was wierd as fuck
From before the?
deja vu
Remember this for your history and science tests; North America was once larger than Eurasia.
I've been looking for this. Thank you!
Aglol, Please pangaea proxima #2
...never happened.
The earth is flat
Where is the eurobeat?? Because it says drift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMuJxd2Gpxo Shoulda played this song.
Looks like, in the future, Africa will separate from Eurasia
5:00
Deja vu!!!
What did he use to make this
DEJA VU
omg its a flat earth...flat earth confirmed ohhh yeah!!!!
Make it a 3d video
??? ????? ??? ????? ??????
big lie
this is so relaxing
G L O B E
What if this Pangea was just 1 of the continents of a bigger planet that got hit and parts flew of into space, leaving a distorted gravity center and for that reason forced the continent to split and form like it is now around the new gravity center?
deja vu intensifies
can I ask: where are the north china block and the south china block
Can I use screencaps of this for an online lecture I'm doing? And if yes, how would you like me to credit your work?
Continental Drift but no walking it out like grannies
Eurasia? Do you mean Europe?
Song at begining?
now lets imagine the whole thing breaking apart again
How do continents drift? If they float, why don't sea creature swim under them.
That was beautiful.
the earth is flat ( ?° ?? ?°)
2:28 ??????? ?????? ?? ???????)
Australia used to be in the artic... what...
I am glad he didn’t skip from 3300 mya to 2250 mya.
So our super continents name today is none?
2:59 Supercontinent : First D*ck
R u an flat Esther?
you were meant to say at today Eurasia And The Americas.
This video is absolutely amazing, and then it seems like some people had translated your video into Chinese and used for commercial purposes, at least some parts of your video. I'm wondering whether that guy had ever asked for your permission, and whether his commercial usage has infringed your copyright. Maybe you should go and have a check, here is its Youtube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwgVuy0EKt0&t=42s; some other URLs in Chinese social network: 1. https://www.bilibili.com/video/av21422168; 2.https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35140043 . Best wishes and expecting more amazing videos.

The continent of Australia doesn't exist. Australasia is an alternate name of the continent of Oceania but still... IT'S AWESOME!
It all started with Africa and Australia (and a bit of Antarctica)
CONTINENTALYU DORIFTO?!?!?!!???!!!?!?
0:19 UR GUN, GIANT GUN CONTINENT, AN ISLAND WAS A BULLET OOOOOOOO
Nani? Continental dorifto?!
The Video : shows about the HIstory and story of earth , Me : WOOOAAAHHH IS THIS A NEW IO GAME?!? EARTH.IO!?
Islands began to form on earth and become continents.
Imagine if all this were to happen at the speed of this video?
4:09 Laurentia, Siberia, and Baltica are moving up.
3:09 It looks like a head
Maine!
Vaalgara???
Fast and furios xdcfxdxdgkvg
Looks like all lands of the earth are playing around. Lol
Fantastic!
Did anyone realize that indonesian have island shape K
DEJA VU!
I thought it's gonna be OZMA's song ??
This is proof the earth is flat.
very interesting ?? also 2:57 very inappropriate ??
We can see Africa correctly(kind of) at 600 million years ago (4:03)
and could you make the same, but with the colors of the original landmasses, so that at the end you can see the origin of bits that form the current continents?
Bounces like jelly
2:56
DEJA VU
NANI?! CONTINENTORU DORIFTO?!?!
5/10 -no eurobeat
Program?
Not gonna lie, when i saw the title i was expecting eurobeats. Still, great educational video.
Decided to follow a point in the animation from the beginning to the end to see where it ended up. Turns out it was Nome, Alaska.
I really enjoyed this video , Thanks
The little part that departed itself from Ur at 0:19 reunites with the exact same part at 3:53 and later becomes part of Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Tsjad (and obviously tiny little parts everywhere else as well)
This shit never happened.
Crazy to see how much our planet has changed from a couple tiny islands to 7 huge landmasses.
Music?
Drifting without eurobeat isn't drifting.
9999
Think i heard this off of futurama
0:18 Ur famous! ur cool! UR !!!!!! ????????
4:50 LOOK SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA ARE THE LAURASIA COUPLE MARRIED! ????????????????????????????
0:15 supercontinent: VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LBRA that's what it sounds like
Earth 2: Continental Drift
is Eurasia a combination of Asia and Europe?
GOD FORM ALL THIS
Wow good job
It appears the first recognisable feature is The Great Australian Bight, appearing in -1448mya and it grows from there.
None is not a supercontinent none is none-continent
600 million years ago 4:03
2:53
So it started with vaalura
The world is a Agar.io server
So there is no such landmass as Europe.
Tokyo drift
4:43 this is the original pangea
4:50 Britain left the EU in Europe
0:23 mom gay
.
Very cool good job
Yea They Were All In One Island Named Pangea
When you said drift, I thought actually drifting a car Disadvantages of being a car guy
The see me rollin' they hatin'
2:35 It's a hint
Now someone add some eurobeat in the background
Most people remember only 1 super-continent. It’s Pangea because of the dinosaurs from 66MYA.
Two super continents America and Afro-Eurasia
Eurobeat?
How do some land have "no modern counterpart"?
What does Myr mean?
I wait until it become looks like Tamriel
Vaalbara 0:12 3300 Myr Ur 0:18 3099 Myr Kenorland 0:33 2706 Myr Arctica 0:47 2562 Myr Atlantica 1:32 2112 Myr Atlantica/Nena 2:01 1823 Myr Columbia 2:01 1823 Myr Rodinia 3:16 1073 Myr Pannotia 3:49 742 Myr Gondwana 4:06 573 Myr Pangaea 4:30 332 Myr Laurasia/Gondwana 4:46 172 Myr Laurasia 4:50 133 Myr Today 5:03
This didn't seem right were Australia and Indonesia not connected to each other a few thousand years ago?
AWESOME
what a video dude
Awesome!!!!!!
Woah
At -388 Mya it starts to become familiar
*Eurobeat intensifies*
DEJA VU
And all of human history takes place at the end of that very last note! Makes you think.
nice
Deja Vu!
Este video me la sirvo para enseñarle a mi profesora en mi colegio ;v #HailLH
What do creationists say about continental drift, it sort of negates the flood story doesn't it?
I think you need yo take away Antarctica's ice sheet.
I thought it was the song
Algol dude which country are you from?
Ded earth no man 000000000000000000000000000000
in 2600 myr started
in 3300 myr earth was so heat and had no water and had ony lava and plasma fire and heat stone in 2000 myr earth started the water and oceans and sea and gras
Super continent today: russia
Philippines -10 Myr 5:02
the first year of the columbia supercontinent was my favourite -----------------> 2:01 4:29 was the best of real continental drift
4:03 Africa is starting to form
at 4:03 I noticed africa's modern shape
3:56 666 Million Years BC
lolwut i dare u to click read more kill me
MINUS NOT NEED!!
Why do people still call Australia as a continent? The correct is Oceania
Supercontinent ------------>>>. Nonecontinent
Yay I can learn more about da past
Vaalbara ----> Present Day 2017
What Is Myr
Too much information per today So Cuba is from us, Cuba is not nothing they do not have identity in your face Cubans of shit
i came by DGP MUNDO
Nice
So how is it that there was so little continental land mass back then (as far as we could tell)? More water or continental crust hadn't developed as much?
This is Awesome!
It flat
It flat
Shit, thought this was the next Fast and Furious
Fantastic ??
no eurobeat
Top effort. Ever thought about making a G-Plates Model for public use?
Thanks a lot, SQUIRREL!
Sick, this would take a lot of studying.
Anyone got the eurobeat version?
Gondwana looks dope.
De ja vu
now do every year...
So in this video, 1 second equal to 10 million years
2:07 only i see a lego man?
4:57 that's pretty much how earth looked like when the meteor struck
Shaped into something beautiful
No Initial D music?
so now we know that it's going to be 300 million years from now and which we all would be dead by then :/
I like how big Australia was for most of the earths history.
Vengo por el robot de Platón :v
wait islands can move everywhere in the ocean in dinosaur year? also i have dino rock
Looks like when mixing clay
And zealand?
Africa and Australia were the oldest continents?
BTW, the colours seem slightly off on the last frame.
The Philippine islands were separated from the borneo island
You copyed fron dpg mundo and puts a music or you putt it
DEJA VU
Have you seen Professor Scotese's video that goes back to 1.5 billion?
Continental DRIFT, DEJA VU!
Great animation, Although It would be great to have lines of lat and long included. Good job!
??????? ??? ?????????!!!
I love how at 4:54 India's like 'screw this, I'm off'.
Its good but where’s doggerland?
I come here to listen GAS GAS GAS... DRIFT!
The amazing part of this is that throughout the majority of it, there is no life on any of the continents.
what Myr
Amazing how much our world has changed. I wonder what it'll look like in 100 million years.
Looks like someone left their milk out and this is a time lapse of mold growing on it. #EarthIsMoldyMilk
the super continent of 0 MYR is eurasia
Supercontitent: ur
The content Ur lasted untill 2:46 or -1366 Myr
The Earth is only 6000 years old. What book series is this map based on?
”ur” kidding me.
2:01 even 1818 million years ago, no one could spell Colombia correctly Why did a Brazilian make a joke about no one knowing how to spell Colombia lmao
Eurobeat intencifies
I like pangea
Algol myr=?
The Earth's history is such a wonderful topic to cover, from beginning to now, so beautiful. :)
So wrong
Pls combine this with the Pangea Proxima model animation
Pls combine this with the Pangea Proxima model animation
Bro how do u know dis stuff
I'm here from DGP MUNDO :)
Myr=?
vaalbara 3.3 billon 9
Way more emotional than I thought it would be.
This was shown in my Social Studies Class at West Middle School in Nampa Idaho, you have a whole School as a fan!
So beautiful!!
I like Alfred Wegener´s Theory Of Continental Drift, and I think It would be a really great interest of mine to learn more about it. Good job.
Awesome!
2:36 Super sized NA?
He took me back to -2031 Myr oh half of the earth is a tectonic the earth is banana havan
1:41 bottom right
Whats mean MYR?
Whats mean MYR?
I think it would have been better if the entire tectonic plate boundaries were shown, not just the visible land.
Very well done! I like the timer and the names of the supercontinents.
I love the music (infinite perspective)
make 300 million pangma proxima version 2.
Today, we still have Afro-Eurabiasa.
Where are the Moose?
2:36 Columbia does the groundpound
Algol, I kindly want to ask that is your novopangea model coming out yet
4:19 - NOT ANYMORE THERE’S A BLANKET
I cant wait for the United kindom to leave europe
What music did you use?
Did anyone noticed that in 1:59, a part of NA and a part of Eurasia formed the Korean Peninsula?
But... wouldn't there be a super continent today? In europe, Asia and Africa? They are all combined after all.
Lol. This is a broken theory. Just look how they look like they willl fit nicely together before they meet. Feels backwards at times.
I'am tukish
What will happend 4000 yearscago
How the Continents formed and broke apart
3:45 earrape YA ass
that does not look like anything ????????
2:54 That was not even funny
Dude! Amazing! You should call yourself amazing Algol!
The first ever land was so pleased to see all of His species
4:32 who saw Mexico
You could argue that we do have a super-continent in africa, europe and asia, as they are all connected (Afroeurasia)
What's the name of your song
I like india piece from africa to asia
Fun fact: Ur technically wasn't separated until Pangaea split up, which means it lasted for 3 billion years.
This has to have the most relaxing music on planet earth (no pun intended)
Pause at 4:57 and this where Florida didn't exist and this where the asteroid kill the dinosaurs
2:45 God: oh no, Earth what are you doing? EARTH?? WHAT IS THIS? NO EARTH YOU'RE GROUNDED
So where was Atlantis, and when was it completely buried by water?
4:54 "woah"
At 4:45 North America said yikes
4:56 India car crash
How does land just join together like that?
Umm...i already know... when i was in 2th grade
You forgot include the meteor strike that hit when America and South America joined.
Shouldn't it show boy sides of earth?
What music was this?
Please like and subscribe share comment the Algol ????????????????????????????????????????
Great Algol l like this ??????????
Amazing agol
Who's watching this from —3300 Myr 0:11

Papua is asia
Fantastic Job
Algol, you are make new model Earth 1 billion years from now?
4:55 Here comes an asteroid, And the Dinosaurs are gone....

Long live Ur. ???????????????? Note: not all of the events above are historically accurate! I was just trying to make a fun story about a continent a few million years ago!
Nice flag design... mine has the same design but the background color is orange, the y-stripe in the middle is dark red with a fire symbol to the right side, and the line surrounding it is blue
I'll tell you a secret how videos like this are made: the author was just on crack, what make 'em look amazing.
Columba looks like a man falling

Weather update: VOLCANO ALERT THATS LAND
God dammit dinosaurs
What means "MYR"?
R.i.p Vaalbaara ? To ?
Finally I found! Really nice animation mapping!
Multi-continental drifting?!
This is so bullshit so for 2000 years the world changed so much and then for 2000 years almost nothing changed BULLSHIT
Hi, Algol. I think your great! :) But i do have 1 question. In the frames you use for this video, i move for from frame to frame, but it changes dramatically from the last frame. But in this video, it's animated. How do you do that?
Its american actually
greenland is green so greenland is american?
And also, when Columbia formed, it looks like an anglerfish about to eat it's prey :):):)
Arctica kind of looks like a grandma wearing a baby's amplifier :):):) And when the amplifier is pulled out, the grandma dies...
I wont to visit each continent and live in each era just to see all beauty of that nature and to see that what hadn't been seen by anyone and maby find mountains which is higher than everest and oceans which is deeper than pacific and really that must be really amazing!
4:43 is 200 ma
4:22 Woah Awesome
2:55 lmfao look at the thing in the middle ;)
There are 6 continents. AFRICA, ANTARCTICA, AUSTRALIA ,EURASIA, NORTH AMERICA and SOUTH AMERICA.
is the earth still moving like this?
2:53 is -1300 ma
The picture at 0:00 is amazingly beautiful!
I liked it
m
Really impressive animation, thank you!
vaalbara to Ur to kenorland to arctica to atlantica/nena to Columbia to rodinia to pannotia to gondwana to Pangaea to Laurasia/gondwana to Now
Beautiful! Thank you!
That took a long time but IT WAS AWESOME!
4:39 Africa 's shape
4:03 = 600 mya
hey omgggggggggggggggg noooooooooooo the enemies falling in the water this balls here 3:43 to 3:55 these ice
gooooooooooooooooooooooood
is it real??
Nice!
watching this in 2x speed is fine
Make Earth in 1-2017
Very nice job! Thank you! I experimented with playing various types of music for accompaniment. That was fun!
YSytyfu
Jsfoo
Just a theory
2:42 that looks alot like baby pangea
2:16 and that's why they say Colombia, to not be confused by the supercontinent Columbia 1,660 million years ago.
i wish i was born in -8 MYR when britain was still a part of france and when poland and germany were conjoined with sweden norway and finland
Love these globe videos you make! Do you have a business email I can reach you at?
How do you do this?
UR be like: bitch, im on my own
who doing 2 times speed with me?
Sometimes, it looks like the countries are melting, or are they?
2:22 south america looks like the one today
gasps!!! u forgets beemooda!!!1!1! how der u!!!1!1
1.?????? 2.?????
Im having science clus now nice
How is continent are growing
i would think today's supercontinent would be Afro-Eurasia
Where’s Pangia
Great work! :D
4:38 - Pangaea
amei esse vídeo, bom saber como o mundo começou. adorei??
Primeiro brasileiro a comentar o vídeo kkkk
The music is so relaxing.??
DGP Mundo brought me here, i liked the channel
Is there music for this I can hear it but what is it?
This is good tho,very accurate!
There are seven continent thought.
How do you now all off these?
I came from dgp :D
Earth was beautiful until humans are here chopping trees lawn mowing and throwing drinks/Foods What are we doing to our home planet protect earth #Earthislife
Amazing work :( i always wanted to make one of these but i get too many dislikes. :(
the fuck is a myr
-1815 Myr Never knew Columbia was a continent. Now it's a country.
Hawaii?!?
0:11 to 5:04
This was kind of beautiful to watch.
4:33 it's barely starting to look like the world we know rn
Great job, fantastic editing and super educational!
The story of 4:50 : South America: Africa? Africa: Yes? South America : I'm sorry to tell you I've been cheating on you with North America. Africa: Screw you! I'm running away with Eurasia!! (floats away)
Vaalbara simply became Antarctica, Madagascar, idk what part of Asia, And all of Oceania.
Awesome job algol!
So it is possible that earth used to be a huge water planet?
so africa and australia are the oldest parts ??????
burt i dont get it.it massses of land are fixed to the bottom of the sea, how do the continents move?
Wow!!!!! A awesome job!!!
5:05 best of the best
Love this video. Great job!
it is cool
? ? earth viewer ?????????? ?????? ??????
fantastic lol
0:11 Vaalbara 0:18 Ur 0:32 Kenorland 0:47 Arctica 1:33 Atlantica 2:00 Atlantica/Nena 2:01 Columbia 3:16 Rodinia 3:48 Pannotia 4:06 Gondwana 4:30 Pangaea 4:46 Laurasia/Gondwana 4:49 Laurasia 5:03 2017
Why Greenland can be american
Eurasia is my favorite continent
Good Job
Is this for apollon
you are so smart, i think this took days and days of work and documentation, hundreds of hours!
Wow! fantastik gratulasion!
Wonderful Vid, But did you know, the continents did not break, dissolve, or anything, the just got merged under the water!
Why does the super-continent look like a baby in 2:23. It is probably just me.
AAALLGGOLLLL
This is so Fun to watch. Our planet Really has Gone through much change.
3:57 ok this is interesti- and oh my god
awezone video
4:57 AND THE DINOSAURS ARE GONE
4:15 THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER
4:09 IT'S THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION
vim pelo canal TOPlista
Faz o ur
DGP TOP LISTA ME TROUXE :v
Congratulations
They forgot erope
Incredible animation ! I love it!
in 5:03 this is the current form of the continent if you know a lot about geographic in egypt there is a Peninsula that not in africa like whole egypt its a part of asia and its called sinai and in the video you labeled it as african Peninsula if you dont know what is sinai search in google : Sinai Peninsula and also not only sinai that you labeled as an african land also israel (palestine) you labeled it as african land and its asian
Now it's clear that God really created the oceans first before lands...as said on Genesis..
0:12 boring
How do we know this!!?? I mean I can understand that we could go back pretty far but how do we know 3000mya? Can anyone inform me?
This is amazing ?? thanks Algol
At aus it split colide split
Fantastic Job Algol
Look this 666 myr
when being white is a bad thing
Great great great work! Thanks for sharing too.
Algol! There some copiers of your video! I'm going to edit this later to send you all the links. EDIT: https://youtu.be/unBYpDZTCPY https://youtu.be/nFP2k7-ZiRY
Oh my. That's us.
Try this 4600 myr
Can You Do An "Updated" Version Of This? It Would Be Cool If You Made -3300 Myr (Vaalbara) To 300 Mya (Pangaea Proxima)
4:47 to the present India:Hi madagascar and africa i will go to asia Africa& Madagascar:Why? India:Because i want to join with country that not black people Africa: :( India: BTW i will make white mountain range not black Africa:what's DAT India? India:I will make Himalayas with the highest mountain in the world Asia: Thanks India Africa:But bu but why And today the himalayas was form Thats why Africa hates india
little island bye bye Ur Ur:no problem just leave Little island:this is dangerous! Ur: little island where do you think your going? Little island:back! Ur:n sorry yes not no (-3300Myr--3150Myr) Arctica: come back head Head:no Arctica:otherwise i will die Head:no Arctica:Ok :( aah i am breaking up! The islands:i dont care lalalalaallalalalalalal not a supercontinent anymore:what an i doing?
4:44 pangea
Mu
the world is cat easter egg
It's unbelievable how much work you put into this. The work was all worth it. Great job. You earned a sub.
2:55 When Australia was on top of everyone.
4:54 Brexit!
'mazin
Strongly Agree
this was a good channel sad to see it go..
Deja vu, I have been in this place before...
I like how Antarctica began at the top
Hallo im new to this channel ALgol im a subcriber now i saw some of your video on your channel *likes the video
And 200 years of driving cars is gonna fuck this up. Okay.
No i will not lose my 5 mins for watching continents moving
The ending was so beautiful and satisfying!
3:53
good you made the whole history of the continents
-1291 myr looks like a pee pee :)
4:09 world's most Giant Antarctica
1:31 find a giant Idiao and Vermont
2:54 hey look a dick har har har
what pangea
This is soooo well done. It teaches something and it's soothing. Glad to have found your channel
Newzeland*
News eland is a sunkin land mass
That was amazing video EVER!
this song was amazing
I noticed now that from kenorland the north american plate stayed the same, even if the islands were seperated, but rhodinia really started to shape the americas.
As much as I like the video, I am colorblind and unable to really distinguish the progression of some of the landmasses.
5:01 florida is born
i love music
woah that looks like witch's head LOL!
No way!
most of antartctica strated at the northern hemisphere
You know in Minecraft but is none history of county world
:(
Good Job Algol
I like that song
I like how the boomerang shaped continent Ur managed to remain intact and survive in that shape for over 1.5 billion years until it was merged with a series of supercontinents and it only finally broke apart when the last supercontinent Pangaea split up.
Mega Job
I thought Afro-Eurasia was a super-continent.
Apparently Italy ???? is not the only boot in history.
2:57 Im thinking of all the possible names the land in the middle would be called :D
Scrat's at it again.
Algol can you do a animation that if the sun's super nova never happens can you do a animation the continents moving after the construction of Pangea Proxima please
Wow how did you make it move so smoothly?
There were only fish at 3.3 billion-374 million years ago
1:41 is 2017 !!
It's amazing how Vaalbara remained a distinct landmass for about 1800 million years.
Meant "around"
I can't believe you did this because at first glance it look shapes floating Aron an oval but it is actually real life a long time ago. WOW
nice vid (music scares me for some reason)
HOW DID THIS PLS TELL ME
salty creationist flags video
4:29 Not recognisable 4:39 Recognisable ish 4:57 ooh.. 5:05 And guess who's here!
4:56:REST IN PISS,FOREVER MISS.
UR continent is so small! get it?
1476 Ma Me: about to see my people 1000000000 generations ago... 1000000000th great-grandfather: *wiggles* Me: ?? OH MY GOD ?? A MULTICELLULAR ME?!
Hey Guys Look trying to build a precambrian era
im going to have avantage on you
It's somewhat confusing that there is no difference made between deep sea (oceanic crust) and flat sea (continantal crust). I would recommend to use two different colors (e.g. light blue and dark blue).
Panguea is still happening!! Earthquakes happen everyday so... 74% chance of Panguea
This helped me a lot with answering my questions. A lot of effort put into this. Job well done. ;-)
FANTASTIC!!!! IM LIKING AND SUBSCRIBING!!!!
Something wrong with Triassic and jurrasic
why is afro eurasia a thing when they are together????
don't confuse ur with the biblical city xD
Amazing
South America first formed 2.27 Billion Years Ago at 1:16
Building a pangaea
it splits and half
240 million years ago
wegener called pangaea
200 million years ago
I heard some youtuber said "stop it the earth is flat" jeez if the earth is flat the continental is still moving still move but who know globe or flat?
Do you ever plan on creating one with modern day country borders and/or majour city locations? This could show how the continents became themselves over time.
Very good
A+ Algol A+++++++
if someone is saying "Ur dead" then your correct because WE DONT KNOW IF THE CONTINENT "UR" EXISTS
when god made this planet
later algol...where are you now :(
Fantástic
5:03 There is a Supercontinent: Afro-Eurasia.
4:37 About time South America!
Would be great on a CG Globe that could be rotated in real time.
Holy shit Columbia is a giant Denmark.
I like Thailand
the little chunk that breaks off of Vaalbara is part of modern north africa
why Vaalbara is a supercontinent? is so little :3
Imagine if this was real time
YOU FORGOT ZEALANDIA
How you did it?
Nice!
Africans: We wuz first!
The entire thing was like 'world make up your mind'
00:21 looks like a gun shooting
so satisfying
2:34 1492 (maybe incorrect)
Do more videos please they're great!
the music is so relaxing
backwards version please?
I was like "HEY INDIA YOU DROPPED MADAGASCAR "
2:50 the penis continent
When the great historian mapping gods EmperorTigerstar and Ollie Bye approve your video, you know you've done a good job.
no modern counterpart (white)
/???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????
kenorland
I was just watching one area on Vaalbara the whole time and it became southwest Australia
Very nice video. I will waiting for future continental drift video. Very far future. ;)
Isn't Afro-Eurasia the supercontinent as of now?
Good Work Ancient Earth continental drift
And then to think that for the first four minutes of this video, there were only bacteria and protists. So certainly no land creatures to enjoy all this open space on the ancient continents.
Amazing
Afro - eurasia super continent
????
Great job! It is so difficult to explain that in a blackboard!!!
Im disappointed that there is no initial D playing in the background
Lol!!!??????
4:42 incase you are wondering here is the jurrasic period aka dinosuars
2017 years Springs February 17 to June 19 Summer June 20 to August 9 Fall August 10 to November 2 Winter November 3 to February.16,2017 years Winter November 3 to February.16,2018 years
2:11 It's a boy!
Now do the past and the future in one video
Show it to your teacher and she will be amazed so much her mind blows up
Also I am saving this video because I like it
When I watched this video I saw a penisland
Great job :) Can i use it for a scientific divulgation video?
4:07-Africa as stretched out Australia
It's really interesting how Pangea is so popular, yet it looks like the longest-lasting supercontinent was actually Columbia.
how you create this?
Meu Caro, isto é Extraordinário!
south america looked like present antarctica at 4:12
If this video was named "Continental Drift" then you should add the future drifts. Spoiler!
I like this Happy ?? day guys and all of the ?? world
the "Pangea" Spells Wrong....im verry sorry to Said that
awesome
Is this based on Christopher Scotese's Paleomap Project?
2:59 dickland FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
If you dont know what Myr means it means million yers
good but right at the end, new zealand came apart from austriallia not randomly appearing
3,300 million years in the making
wery biriful
What earth in 73737373737272 years look like all water is gone the end
0:11 1-year-old continents! 0:52 8-years-old continents! 2:17 18-years-old continents! 3:55 29-years-old continents! 5:05 Really real continents that are 90-years-old Continents!
4:05 I found North Africa.
If you need any information on these time periods, ask Bernie Sanders. He was probably there for most of this.
Wish you had current states overlapped
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS?!
For earth at between 850 to 750 million years ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C18OdhL6AGo
The continental drift, and we do it just like this
nice agar.io game...
I thought the Supercontinent today was Afro-Eurasia.
The scale of time becomes clear when you realize that in one life time they move about 2-3 m and even after a thousand human lifetimes, the continents have barely moved more than a couple of miles. Real changes are noticeable after about a hundred thousand lifetimes and it takes a million lifetimes for a supercontinent to split. Assuming you lived a hundred years between births and deaths, You'd have to be born, live and die 33 million times to experience everything in this video. That's a hundred million generations !
Awesome!!! Thank you for that. Be well.
how do you make this???
HOW DID YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS!??!?!!? DID YOU JUST TRAVEL FROM THE PAST AND WENT UP TO SPACE AND SEE THE EARTH LOOKED LIKED!??!!??!!?!??!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?
australia was more like borealia
3:23 stopped right in 1000 part!
+Algol Make a Novopangaea drift
that's so cool ^_^
N.America:I miss ur, she was the greatest supercontinent of them all. Europe:Me to I was part of ur and you to,but I was smaller back then.. S.America:I feel bad. N.America:You wasnt even there back then!
1511 ma Amazon: I just got huge! 1400 ma Amazon: Bye Laurasia
Pangea = getonera = nasaeaaaa
this is what i wanted a perfect video thank you Algol for making this video
Rodinia: Congo no!!! Congo:But we need to get to the main course.
2.4 B.yrs Younger north America:Superior what are you doing?! I'm breaking away you lousy lump of land! Younger north America:??
2645 m.a Ur: Younger north America lets unite!
What does MYR mean
I'm pretty sure the first one n became India Madagascar and the middle of antarctica
the song in this video, sped up to 2x speed, sounds like it could have come straight out of a Donkey Kong Country 2 level o3o
the 1 africa part being chased is god making fun of us? so hilarious
You have EXACTLY 4000 subscribers... What is with the accuracy?
I can make this
1.8 billion years ago, antarctica was above everyone
Wow. That is pretty rad. It seems as if the water is disappearing, though; why?
1279mya OMG AUSTRALIA FORMED
Hey hi algol Look this For Earth in 1 billion years from now : http://dragonthunders.deviantart.com/art/TFiF-the-continental-dance-630470153 I think at 0 to 283 is wrong +North america should be glued with africa to 349 million years from now! For Eon in future : http://dragonthunders.deviantart.com/art/TFiF-Geological-Timescale-V2-555809308
Awesome video. It was nice to have the age of the depiction in M.Y.A on the side as reference.
Hey, where's that guy who was arguing for expanding Earth? I was going to reply to him, and link him to several papers, but the whole comment thread disappeared. If you know where it went, let me know: that's my weekend distraction you're talking about! EDIT: Found it. But it won't post. I'll just make a video or something.
1460mya UR IS FREE!!!!!!
Amazing... just one or two points - the British Isles came from a landmass known as doggerland, which connected it to Europe; the North Sea and Irish sea, and I suppose the English Channel were created after the last ice age melted... Also, Iceland didn't "drift" from Greenland, it grew out of nothing, a volcano on the mid-Atlantic fault.
arabia and india are their own tectonic plates
forming
3300mya-870mya music that reminds me of the calm seas flowing and everything that's going on in these scattered tectonic plates 870mya-0mya music that tells me of the present
what's the music for this?
4:56 R.I.P. Non-Avian Dinosaurs
180mya pangea already broke apart
I was keeping track of Ur and it landed in the middle east
Is it just me or are the colors for Eurasia and Australia almost indistinguishably close?
Do you make "Continental Drift: 3.5 Billion Years of the Future World" !
Why is Europe combined with asia not a supercontieniet?
At the end it's supposed to be AFROEURASIA?
Can you do continental drift videos in rectangular projection?
Rodinia was so big!
2:30 0:54 1:08 2:02 Ur, how many times do you need to break off of other islands?!
Bravo! Good job!
I cannot say why Antarctica looks like a big continent but it is only a big island
0:19 shots fired
Mya - Myr ? Before this video: MYA Now: MYR what is Myr?
You also included the post-Miocene rotation of the Sardinia-Corsica block. I'm moved! -
What music do you use here?
WHERES TIMELINE OF FLAGS OF ASIA
I'd like to point out that there is a slight problem with counting new zealand as part of Australia.
Very interesting, I always wonder what it was like before 3 billion years. Did meteorites have a significant effect on the continents?
This is so beautiful on so many levels.
Amazing job what is the program you use for this?
You should do a Alternative Future of the World Mapping Series.
????????
eso es hermoso
k can u do next the future but in the novopangea scenario just search it up on google search novopangea
Is similar than the drift of 3 billon years ago
and novopangaea please
and novopangaea
-2981 MYA That one island: Bye Ur! Ur: :( ok -790 MYA That one island: somehow still a island after over 2000 Million years avoiding Colombia and Rodinia. Nooo!! Rondinia: how about know :^) And eventually became Egypt. Also good video
Keep up the work
Awesome video! :D
0mya, what do you mean none? what aout Afro-Eurasia(africa, eurasia)? what about America(north america, south america)? also no Euroamerica(laurentia/north america, baltica/europe) at 430 :(
RIP hadean animation... :(
laurentia fully forms at 2520mya
Continental drift is driven by New Age music. However in the real world, continental plates cannot slide about willy nilly. They are firmly rooted in the ground. What makes them APPEAR to move apart is the expansion of the earth and the rifting and spreading which this causes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ&t=213s
You have a discrepency when you reach the modern world, Super Continent: Afroeurasia
You still list that the present day has no supercontinents. I feel that Eurasia should be classified as a supercontinent. If not, then Afro-Eurasia surely is.
4:50 Like a jigsaw puzzle in europe
Are you gonna map this one onto a globe like you did it with the previous version?
the best! Awesome, fantastic! Wow!
Nice!
Greece deserves constantinople. the landmass is older than the rest of the land it owns. and constantinople has gold. gold that should never have been owned by a conservative country. hey that reminds me. conservative nations are cheaters.
great work. congratulations.
Woah, amazing!
the world is mooooooving 0-0
Nice ;)
Great!
You make video 2000 Myr to 100000000 Myr in the Future?
Amazing, as usual.
That was pretty good, my dude
Fantastic job!
Coolio
Yes!
Amazing work Algol
NOT THE LABELLED VERSION!!! This had to be made before. This fixes some inaccuracies, and everything is reanimated since I did a sloppy job the first time. New stuff -3300 Myr to -2100 Myr, and -1380 Myr to -750 Myr.
furts
Idiot
How about autograph
The earth is a donut on top of a turtle; pray it's not hungry
Of course you can't make the earth flat. It already is.
Earth is flat. End of discussion
grenland 2 big G R E N L A N D 2 B I G
Africa is actually 14x the size of Greenland
This is way i only use 3d when seeing world map!
Go back to bed kid, you're sleepwalking again . . .
but wait how do you map the land onto a globe?
MapQuest...I don't miss that
Alexcious Authagraph map is interesting to approach this issue
Liked for making me remember MapQuest... Wow..
3.58 for real science
The earth is earth shaped
So why do we still have to distort maps in apps? Couldn't we theoretically just project the earth onto a sphere and then when working at navigation level distances, zoom in so it looks flat, like it does in real life?
First in recommended: VSauce’s “Is the earth actually flat?”
Mapquest XD aaahhh!
I have some weird idea for making a flat map. You wrap a paper around a sphere(like you would do with a lollipop) and draw the continents and stuff on it. Then you take that off and suddenly you have a flat map. I don't know if it has already been done and I haven't tested it but it would be nice to see someone try.
im not saying the earth is flat, but there are maps of flat earth. for exemple: the united nations logo.
How To Make An Accurate Map: Mix Mercator map + Lambert's Cylindrical Projection!
my face when people say the earth is flat ??
The mercador projection could be accurate by 100% if you make Greenland 8-14 times smaller. I did that and that made a new projection! I call it the Matt Projection (My first name is Matthew BTW)!
Lots of funny posts about the shape of the earth. Research Flat Earth, don't be afraid, consensus isn't truth
1:25 what's the deal with with mapquest??
gleason's map - map is correct as it is... equator is 24,874 miles, james cook around Antarctica - it is 60,000 miles in Circumference.
streched hank looks creepier than original hank
155 people are flat-earthers
LIAR THE EARTH IS FLAT
Earth is flat you bums
Would y'all ever look at flat earth "evidence" and explain why it's not true? Just think it would be interesting hearing you talk about it.
I remember MapQuest. (I started driving when I was in the 2nd grade.)
ISS proves flat earth. You don't see a ball in the pictures, just a flat surface. Checkmate atheists!
omg I can't stop laughing at '..or MapQuest! How old are you?' #quiteoldapparently
writen
Are Flat Earthers actually a thing? I always thought they're just a bunch of trolls.
THIS WAS SHOCKINH
This is fake news the illuminati paid him off for sure #flatearther cash me ouside swag
Oh boy...this entire discussion will be about the Earth being flat.
Lmfao!!!! "would be really nice if everyone agreed with that sentence" god damn stupid "earth is flat" morons, they should all be shot or hung because they're so God damn DUMB.
This ridiculous Mandela effect thing where they think Australia has changed place.......this is what's behind it I realised ?????? Bullshit busted...oh yeah
Earth?-Flat Moon landing?-Faked Hotel?-Trivago
7/11 was a part time job.
I saw a model with all the continents with the most accurate shape I ever saw in a map, it can be cut in a rectangle too in many directions. the only detail is that the parallels get curved.
I love that last sentence.
In other words, we just need a widely available hologram projector to display the world in 3d
"how old are you are you old enough for that" haha yes yes I remember map quest
My mom uses mapquest
Also.... This Mandela effect thing made people look in their maps. To believe the old earth and new earth thingy... there are other factors the map of the world would change. And because we have new technology, we can make the map even more detailed. And there are earthquakes.
Anyone with even a partially working, damaged brain understands that the earth is round.
Subtitles are incorrect @1:50 "... but Africa is nearly 8 times the size of Greenland." is showing 14 instead of 8.
If you're so confident that the Earth is not flat, make a video debunking all of the popular flat earth claims. The bottom line is, flat-Earthers put forward very valid points that I never see refuted in any kind of intellectual, scientific, or adequate way by ''non-flat-Earthers'.
Old enough for Mapquest? I remember the days before it....
What if just photograph the earth from space and then put everything together? And make the scale and all that stuff?
GPS, best map ever until you are driving on train tracks into a pond.
xkcd fans unite- the waterman butterfly is where it's at
Learned about this in my GIS class, very interesting!
Free knowledge isn't real knowledge. I have a PHD in shapes from NASA. message me and I'll give you the truth about the earth.
Lol, old enough to remember MapQuest
You get a thumbs up for mapquest lol
Areas of not map...
but...but... THE GOVERNMENT IS LYING TO US EARTH IS FLAT THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOU THEY ARE THE DEVIL
Round, flat...combine the two and you end up with a halo
Could you make a map that's a very long rectangle and on it is a spiral of Earth. You could fold the map into a globe but it can be read as just a strip of paper?
How dumb do people have to be to ACTUALLY think the world is flat? What is this, ancient Greece? This is the 21st century, and the world has been scientifically proven to be a tetrakis hexahedron.
If the Earth was flat then we would have flat beer...
I think Vox did this video before...???
Earth Not Flat? You must be joking right? Next you will say that We are not the center of the universe and that earth was not created in a Day.... How preposterous!!! Please dont say that Pluto is not a Planet and there is no Human colony on Mars.
the first four words in the description alone will be enough to trigger a lot of backwards minded flat earth believers
Area, distance, direction, A.D.D.!
144 Dislikes =144 flat Earth people what a sham
Africa is 15 times larger that Greenland, not 8.
Why don't we just use globes? Imagine if the Earth were flat and humans were constantly trying to find the best way to project it onto a sphere. That would be stupid.
Ahem Kyrie
this is a word for word rip off of the video Vsauce did years ago on maps
is map quest still a thing?
Seriously? "MAPQUEST! you old enough for that?" shot zooms into his face like he already died inside alil
MapQuest... that's like an MMORPG right? XD
Yep. Old enough to know Mapquest.
Can you teach us about natral auburn hair? Ive tryed to reaserch it and keep getting the same results. It usally just gets catigorized as red but its not red. I have auburn hair and it may be a mutation but i would love to learn more about it.
The best map of earth is the earth itself
All NASA has to do is send a satellite far enough from Earth to take video of it spinning on its' axis? I'd settle for one real photo(Please don't refer me to the Apollo images). The same goes for the flat Earth.
Question about flat Earth theory tho : I can conceive that people at the head of the world (whoever it applies to) can plot to hide information from populations. Ceta/Peta/Acta/etc. is there to prove it each year with a new name. But why would hiding the fact that Earth is flat benefit them? The commercial acts I was referring to were implying more control over information as a whole and lots of moneyz in their large pockets. But lying about Earth's shape? Apart from a "good joke", it serves no purpose, and going out of their way to lose money plotting isn't in line with their leech behavior. So what gives?
just use google earth!
You said that Africa is 8 times the size of Greenland but Greenland is 2.16 million square kilometres and Africa is 30.37 million square kilometres. so more like 15 times the size.
I still use MapQuest!! ?????
1:45 Actually Africa is about 12 times larger than Greenland (30.37 million square km vs 2.6 million square km). Not 8.
Oh good lord what the fuck were those abominations of America-centred map projections at the beginning I want to puke
great
And why is north up?
Up Next: "Is Earth Actually Flat?" (Vsause).... I wonder!??
"Large areas of not map." ??
Unbelievable, people buy this nonsense? If the earth is round why don't people on the other side fall off smart guy? Obviously shill for the globe industry.
I AM OLD EN OUGH FOR MAPQUEST! Oh my god. So funny story. I was showering. And I was thinking "What ever happened to mapquest?" like earlier today, then I see this video. Lmao.
The world is a cube! The voices told me!
I thought for a long time that Sweden (I'm a Swede, that's why just Sweden) was bigger than France. In French Class they told us France was actually six (or something) times bigger than Sweden. Man I was confused! But I understood it eventually by looking on an actual globe. :)
Use Dymaxion projection. Its the most accurate.
folks, please humble yourself. there is no spin, there is no curvature, there is no space. Nasa CGI fakery is been long exposed. so...please.
I don't get why science shows care so much about flat earthers. Most people agree that the world is a sphericalish shape and for the six people that don't they aren't hurting anybody.
but kyrie said...
There's more people complaining about "flat eathers' than flat earthers themselves. You're just as annoying.
Earth is actually a pentagon
I wonder if when they were developing this series Hank and Co. said to themselves...and week 44 we'll do one on why the Earth isn't flat...
Wake up sheeple! Hank Green is just another Round-Eather shill. I heard he's funded by Monsanto. Hashtag illuminati confirmed. Hashtag flat earth 4eva. Hashtag do your research.
The Earth is fat.
Flattards are time travelers from the 13th century and still thinks the earth was flat.
Flattards are completely wrong
What if I just peeled a globe?
What about Discworld?
the earth isn't shaped like a globe it's a bit ovalrish if that makes sense
the earth is a cube.. duh.. the people who think it's a tetrohedron are crazy
How about we use globes instead of maps so we don't have to watch videos on every educational channel ever saying THIS MAP IS WRONG HERE'S WHY every other week
No love for the Robinson.
no love for the waterman butterfly?
that's why I use Google maps earth layer
A hundred Flat-Earthers disliked this video.
according to alternative facts, it is flat and it's 6,000yo
What did "The Week" magazine do for their map of Earth, in their "The World at a Glance e..." section? Hawaii isn't on it.
Actually, a flat screen showing a globe that can be manipulated in virtual 3D space is ideal when a physical globe is not available or practical and a flat viewing surface is required.
what if i told you that Earth is a rhombus....
Why does my chest sound hollow when i tap/knock on it?
Thank you for inadvertently gassing up my nostalgia drive by mentioning both MapQuest and the notability of your having mentioned MapQuest, you old fossil.
Could we not just make a map that all the land is undistorted but it doesn't give a crap about the ocean.
heresy! flat earth for life!
I give myself away youth choir
1:26 mapquest joke made me laugh
This was so incredibly satisfying... I wonder if you could use a dymaxion map - if correctly arranged and maybe with a higher triangle resolution for navigation... so worth a try...
But if our universe is flat, then our world must also be flat. Also, if you were a particle of light your view of the earth as you passed it would be flat from your perspective
What about the brand new AuthaGraph Projection, first published in 2016?: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2016/11/03/most-accurate-world-map/#.WL4cOfJDT4a
shots @ kyrie irving (and others) ??
Love this video, wish you had made it when I was in college! I studied Geography/GIS (Geographic Information Systems), and I now work in GIS and make maps for a living. I <3 maps.
You guys all say "flat earthers", yet i have not once met anyone in my life that thought earth was flat. You guys says "flat earthers" like they actually exist. Give me an example of someone who thinks earth is flat nowadays
@ Kyrie Irving
Man he went off script at the end there. Nice surprise
Preach on Hank, preach on!
I paid over a couple hundred dollars to learn this in college.
Physics question: what would happen if enough electrons were introduced to override the strong force. Basically, could electromagnetic force be stronger than the strong force. If it did could it split the atom?
Earth is actually triangular. Not many people know this.
How odd. Just yesterday I watched the episode of West Wing that addressed this issue and thought "This would be a good subject for Sci Show.". Are you guys spying on me? O_o
Didn't I watch something like this a couple months ago?
who downvotes this? lol, they should do a video on it
Are flat-earthers really that much of a thing? I've never actually seen one.
Earth is a flat
Flat earth people are some stupid people are so stupid. The earth is round. They think the Antarctica is the edge. If that were true then we would have found it. All COuntries can go there right now and check for themselves. It's not hard to fly over Antarctica rite now
Do not trust in science that is manipulated by men's agendas. Instead put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ the only one who can save your soul and answer all of your questions. God bless.
has anyone ever met an atheist that was a flat earther?
I think the flat-earthers are just sad little people who desperately need attention.
Love, Love, LOVE the jab you take at the insane flat-earth "believers". Thanks for standing up for, ya know, sanity and the rational scientific method.
The earth is a globe but i can see a city 60 miles away even tho the math of the globe says it should be 400ft below the horizon. Huh. Then again most people wont know of the tests that have been done to show this because condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.
and as always, thanks for watching...
Thank god it's Hank. Btw, where is Michael?
The earth is flat on a map
There are probably more people today who believe in a flat Earth, than there were 1000 years ago.
@kyrieirving
3:53 duck map = best map
All sources from Wikipedia
If the Earth was flat - you'd be able see all planet surface just looking at horizon, but since it is not flat you can't see an Eiffel Tower sitting your ass at 'merica . If you stupid but somehow rich, you could just fly to space and look by yourself then :D
Africa is 14x greenland, not 8x.
My wife and I were talking about how the person in the front passenger seat is effectively the Co-Pilot, and bears such responsibilities. We were talking about MapQuest at one point. :x
Why can't we just make everything the right size and shape separately and then piece everything together onto a map
False: the earth is a pentagon :3
Wait, flat earthers are actually a thing? I thought that it was just a giant in-joke.
So you say the earth is not flat, because it has no edges? Of course it has no edges, a flat torus doesn’t have any edges. Also if you go in any direction you come back to where you started eventually. Just like on a torus.
Very cool!
Can I?
I don't care what people think, if the earth was a circle I would fall so it's flat
Looking at you Kyrie Irving
ahem Kyrie Irving ahem
"Are you old enough for that?" sounds really dirty :D
I don't know if you guys will read my comment but here it goes. Have you guys heard of the Japanese company Authagraph. I've read it back in 2014 (I think) that they made the most accurate map in the world by eliminating the 4 corners. I'd love to hear your take on this.
The West Wing did it better like 15 years ago.
But is a digital recreation of a globe (like Google Earth) less accurate than a globe?
All the dislikes are the one who think is the earth is flat and their brain is a walnut
flat earth shills
i stopped watching this channel for a while because of the cringey hosts... please use hank more often scishow!
Judt use gogle maps.
I used to believe the Earth was flat. Everyone told me to take a trip to space because of how ignorant I sounded. Thanks to my friends, I discovered the Earth is a pyramid.
Why do people think the earth is round? It makes me so angry
Give me a hammer big enough and a place to stand then you could squish the world! Mua ha ha ha ha!
"The Earth isn't flat?" Sorry, I thought this was the SciShow, not the "Brainwashed By The Government" Show.
I'm lost in the huge area of not map. Hahahaha
I'm old enough for Mapquest, Hank. Also, the Flat Earth Society does have their own Twitter. Yikes.
Nobody actually thinks the world is flat. People claiming that are all attention seekers, it's one of the oldest forms of trolling.
Here's a thought: If you were brainwashed, you would not know. And yes, there are plenty of great examples of it. It is a well known fact now that saturated fat is an extremely important nutrient. Yet some people who have believed otherwise their entire life are now incapable of being taught this truth. People need to be more open minded, especially while they're young. No idea is unworthy of investigation, and it doesn't make you a fool to investigate even the craziest of claims, if you care to. My point: I do not know if the earth is flat, but in no way does it make me intelligent if i laugh at this claim, and dismiss it; especially if a great deal of people believe it. Always look at the facts objectively, and then make an informed decision. You will be very surprised with what you learn. Cheers :)
I got a science question for you Mr. Scientist. Can you have an object move after enough in space that it makes objects of greater mass orbit them? Like what if the moon just suddenly orbiting earth to an insane degree faster, would Earth thenn start to orbit itt? Basically I got into a deep conversation with someone who was baked and I need answers.
great vid great vidgreat vid great vidgreat vid great vidgreat vid great vidgreat vid great vid
THE EARTH IS FLAT! WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT!?
The Flat Earth Society has members all around the globe !
Flat earthers make my brain hurt. I could smash my head against a wall for hours and still not be stupid enough to believe that crap.
Of course the Earth's not flat, it's not even level.
Lol @ 3:51
Screw you, the world IS flat! That's why if you travel in a straight direction for too long, you will eventually return to the same spot you started from, just like Pac-Man. Proof, bitches!
lol mapquest XD when people printed out directions
Idiots saying the earth is flat. It's clearly a dodecahedron.
Darn flat earthes.
You realise all the flat earth posts on twitter are jokes, right?
Why not just cut the back of the earth and then cut it at every parralel
SciShow is paid off by Big Globe. There ain't no globe earth. It's all lies. Don't drink your tap water. That's how they get you.
80 guys think that the earth is flat xd
1:47 Whats going on with the captions? WHO DO I BELIEVE
Damn round earth shill. I thought ScoShow was about REAL science. But seriously.. good video keep it up.
Uncle Drew does not approve.
Do it on a globe than
wait... wasn't the earth a triangle?
I only know the world is not flat because I learned it in history class. I wouldn't know if I hadn't learned it in history class
you shd hv included the West Wing excerpt that I'd guess started many on the road to "me-and-my-browser can become an authority on anything". Wasnt that the Peter's Projection?
the earth isn't a sphere, it isn't flat either. And it's not a cube (for you Minecraft nerds) it's actually a geoid.
LIES THE EARTH IS FLAT THIS IS NASA PROPAGANDA
I've seen some really interesting projections that, rather than going for accuracy, distort different countries based on things like population or wealth. So, for example, more populated countries are made larger and less populated ones made smaller.
Greenland is actually about 14 times smaller than Africa, not 8.
and there is the American map that shows only the USA
You can't make the earth round*
You're just brainwashed by the Illuminati. ??
And yet, the Earth isnt round too XD
The earth is flat, at least mathematically if you travel fast enough. If you do not travel fast enough, its round... like a pancake.. if inflated to the shape of a slightly asymmetrical ball.
The Mercator projection does not preserve large shapes (Greenland is an obvious example), it preserves small shapes, rhumb lines, and linear scale around any point.
I'm a fan of the Dymaxian projection. I like seeing how the land mass sizes compare to each other.
Obviously, you haven't read The World is Flat by Thomas L. Friedman. LOL!
member map quest? ya, i member! I member map quest!
No love for the Gall-Peters projection?
"Huge area of not map" - Hank 2017 This is 100% scientific.
Why is there an accurate map around my anus?
But if the earth isnt flat, why is the horizon flat ..... All these scientists constantly trying to lie to us ... smh
Once you learn the earth is flat you cant even understand the concept of a flat earth it hurts my brain. I also grew up offshore fishing the Atlantic ocean its pretty evident out there. 13 miles out the land disappears behind the earth.
Where my flat earthers????
Aint this video already been made?
Earth is flat, because flat is justice!
I CHALLENGE SCISHOW TO MAKE A CONVINCING ARGUMENT VIDEO THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT FOR APRIL FOOLS DAY.
4:03 "It would be really nice if everybody agreed with that sentence." Haha, a nice underhanded remark
"huge areas of NOT map" lmao
The current best flat map is the quad authagraph map (it's 4 authagraph maps stuck together)
Loved that snarky comment at the end toward the "flat Earth believers" ^^
Glad he didn't mention the 'flat earth map' with Antarctica around the boarder of the circular map. It's probably the dymaxion with the empty spaces filled with water. xD
I still use map quest as my GPS. Its free and windows phones are limited on apps.
Can somebody explain me the anus jokes?
I'd love if SCI Show did a mini series debunking science conspiracy theories ie: flat earth, Mandela effect, etc.
lovin' the sass in this one, haha
I don't think you've made me laugh so hard before, hank. (In a good way)
I am not into geography too much, but this was one of the best episodes in my opinion :)
MAP QUEST OMG WHY AM I OLD NOW
Is there water in the background?
you never once showed the flat Earth map. at the very least you could have pointed out why it was inaccurate.
LPT: Make spherical maps
hold on a second, flat earthers are real? me timbers have been shivered...
Why is there flat earth around my anus?
Very simple problem to solve. Draw your maps on a sphere (or oblate spheroid for the pedantic) - just like the old globes.
But the Earth is flat...... nah, just kidding
Flat earthtards are just going to say Sci Show is a part of the conspiracy. That they're getting some of that globe money lol
Equatorical projection looks coolest
The earth isn't flat?! Inconceivable!
Africa is 14 times bigger than Greenland not 8 times.
The frustration is real.
flat earth in 2017 lul
the earth is pizza slice shaped!
What's map quest?
Why is europe/africa at the center of these maps ?
Winkel Tripel is best map.
using eye tracking, sensitive touch input it and faster graphics rendering it could become common to use the original 3d version through a 2d screen.
Can anyone else hear the background noise? I hear it every scishow video now
what if we just made a video map?
a globe. just as I thought.
Let's use Google earth and have spherical map
close up to Hank's face "How old are you? Are you old enough for that?" Creepy!
They're called Alternative Maps... DUH.
Reality is an illusion. The universe is a hologram. Buy gold.
watch your words hank,FES is watching...
66 flat-earthers
Make a series called PseudoSciShow Premise: Take some pseudoscience and present it with the arguments for it for then to refute the arguments with proper science... Motivation: It can be hard for people without a high enough level of science literacy to refute some pseudoscience on their own.
India has Lhasa and regions of Tibet that ancient map of India is not complete
The Authagraph map remains my favorite. Infinitely tiles as well. It's like the Dimaxion, but better.
Reminds me of xkcd. Randall loves his projections.
holy shit you guys get 21k a month just from patreon.
Thank you so much for discussing this without mentioning the Gall-Peters Projection.
Hah! projecting much?
Missed out the waterman butterfly :( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Waterman_projection_%28Pacific_centered%29.jpg/1024px-Waterman_projection_%28Pacific_centered%29.jpg
I really liked this video, and I really appreciate how when talking about Mercator Projection you didn't go into a tirade about European Imperialism. Not that I have any experience in perhaps an AP Human Geography Class.
what's the bio sex of the worlds map?
Outside of globe, i like Winkel Tripel the most. Right set of compromises.
SciShow you missed this one! https://www.wired.com/2016/11/weird-globe-folding-map-isnt-perfect-close/
so earth is not flat!? no way! :o
Is Hank really saying "long*t*itude"?
1:27 steve buscemi
But the earth is already flat. there is no problem to begin with
As a geographer, people's lack of understanding of maps and the spread of misinformation about things like the Mercator map and strange conspiracy theories regarding it, I'm glad this video was made. Thank you.
But, without the Flat Earther's who would I troll online when I feel the need; the need to troll ??
is flat earth is real ?
Didn't mention my favorite projection, the Waterman butterfly
The Earth is flat, dont let the Nasa BS fool you! WAKE UP SHEEPLE GOD CREATED THIS WORD NOT A EXPLOSION
check out my mice cam live streaming now.
Guys the Earth is obviously a cube anyone who has played Minecraft would know
I went on a flat Earth channel (its called Eric Dubay) to try to argue with the flattards and see what made them tick. and all the "evidence" the glat Earthers puts in their videos are completely false, easy to debunk, ect. Yet almost every person in the comments talk about how they ruin their lives trying to convince other people the world is flat. Most of the time I argue with people, after going back a few times they just stop responding because they know they can't beat someone like me with a good understanding of physics and gravity. But they still beileve the Earth is flat. Its crazy
"Earths not flat!" Turns out we're in a simulated 2D Universe that is falsely projected as 3D, so when we die we come out of the program and go "oh, it is flat"
Can I send you my hand-drawn map of the World?
I'm not saying it's aliens... ...but it's our poor understanding of geography.
I do not agree what that sentence.
Cut the world in half at the equator, and draw each hemisphere as an observer would see it high about the poles.
Me! Me! I am old enough for that! I know what map quest is!
So, when splitting the globe up into segments and then stretching it, why not make multiple copies where the different splits are in different places, and then only use the least distorted segments and piece them together. for instance where it's cut along the meridian and flattened, do this multiple time, but by rotating the globe so that the equator and meridians are in different places, doing this multiple times, until eventually the map's north pole when split is in like, mexico, and then take the mid-section of each map and splice them together with their 'true' latitude and longitude. This will result in the least distortion and a square map. and when I say least distortion I mean, instead of having some parts not distorted and others very distorted, instead you get a universal amount of minor distortion on the whole map. that minor distortion means not as good for fine navigation, like, you might be aiming for brooklyn and end up in queens, rather than, you're aiming for southern greenland and hit the arctic circle.
I really like the last line. "if everybody agreed to that" :D
SERIOUSLY. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T SHOW A PACIFIC CENTRED MAP. It's like the second most used map in the world. Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.
No love for the waterman butterfly? I am disappointed... ;)
how come they don't distort the oceans? plot everything correctly and draw the latitude longitude correctly over it. Idk how that will look, can't find anything
Yes, its called a globe
"It's be really nice if everyone could agree with that sentence" LOL!!
So, Flat Earthers... I know some of you are unfortunately out there somewhere reading this very comment... NASA never lies and the government is our honest to god friend(Seriously, it's comprised only of honest individuals whose intentions are entirely pure)! Drink the "koolaid" and come be normal like us :p
Can we send a video to draymond green because he said AND I QUOTE "Yeah I agree with Kyrie, think about it. If the earth wasn't flat HOW would we stand on it" and to kyrie because he thinks the world is flat and dinosaurs never existed
Earth is flat. Ask a photon. You'll see. (Not trolling, its a physics joke.)
hey guys try this out. flex you ears so they are up and back. next close your eyes and focus all of your attention to the back of your head where the spine meets the base of the skull. let me know if you feel it
C.J. Cregg is digging this video.
yay mapquest!
Have you personally seen with your on eyes the earth from outer space ? Or you just 101% believe anything THEY say ?
love science & skepticism. debunk all bullshit! know what is knowable. :D
All due respect, you forgot polyconic projections. They're used in extremely high and low latitudes because of the earth's curvature toward the poles. Imagine placing a cone over the top of our planet (like a dunce cap). The parts of the paper cap that will touch the earth are then cut our (as projections) and used. Polyconics are used to navigate the Great Lakes.
we just need to stop acknowledging people's video's/posts about the world being flat cause they believe. there's enough proof for those who actually want to check/look for the truth, it's not hard to find. plus it's backed up by scientists, not conspiracy theorist.
Lol mapquest
Peirce Quincuncial is hands down my favorite map projection.
Great video as always! I had an idea for a video topic: Human (animal) Fingernails/ toenails. Nails. What's the deal with nails? :)
The caption at 1:49 is not correct. It says that Africa is 14 times bigger than greenland, while in the video it's said to be 8 times.
Am I the only one here who over used Map quest?
Weird to see Brett Keane at the end of this video.
WHY DO I HAVE MAPS IN MY ANUS?
How come there are flat earthers around m-- oh screw it
"Websites like MapQuest. How old are you? Are you old enough for that?"
3:32 icosahedron
videos like these are the reason im subscribed do more stuff like this alot of your other recent videos seem like your running out of decent ideas
It is so odd that you are releasing this video now. I just saw this the other day on VOX, but that video is from december, and it contains almost exactly the same information.
Makes me think of the cartography scene in the west wing.
Map quest represent!
Is there life on the bottom of the flat earth?
mapquest wasn't THAT long ago, was it? WAS IT?
Also, even the globe is not perfectly accurate. The Earth's real shape is an oblate ellipsoid. It is bigger around the equator, and kind of bulges out in the middle. Think of the Earth as having a beer belly, or looking slightly pregnant. It's not perfectly round like a globe is.
"flat Earth believers" ..I just want to get in on the fun
Man sad to see scishow promote some fake ass round earth shit. It was a ploy mad my the soviets during the cold war to make sure they had an advantage. The earth is obviously flat and it's seriously just to see scishow do this. I though they were credible guess not. I'm unsubbing btw I don't wanna follow fake shit.
why about scishow psychology
Actually, the Web Mercator is used for Google Maps, and other online maps used for navigation.
Is there an actual significant amount of flat earthers or are they just mostly trolls?
Another liberal propaganda piece paid for by the Clintons. I KNOW the world is flat. I have seen proof that all the photos, and pictures, and measurements are all falsified. And the billions of people who have seen that the world is round, are ALL lizard people working under mind-control of the Illuminati. Trump is the only politician not corrupted by our martian overlords. big ol' bait xD
take that flat earthers the world is fu**ing flat as the great Neal deGrasse Tyson once said this is called gravity (drops mic)
"How old are you. You old enough for that?" ~ Hank
the earth is flat. and jesus made earth. FUCK PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS
fuck those people thinking that the only reason mercator is used is because europe looks big and africa looks small. suck my ass.
no
What about the Authagraph projection?
It's cold and flat outside.
“THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY HAS MEMBERS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE” - Flat Earth Society Member
The 1921 version was satisfactory.
no mention of great circles? which is what the Mercator Projection is particularly useful for. I suppose it isnt direct to the topic and would take a min or 2 to explain so fair enough. I guess.
Too many hand gestures.
mapquest? :)
Why do they make Africa so small on the map it's freaking HUGE
Your map at 1:11 is a little dated? By about 107 years from the look of it.
There was a game on the PS1 where you were a jet... or a space ship.. I don't know... You controlled a plane shaped thing that flew around different planets with objectives like destroy the train before it gets to X or find the thing that's crash landed, anyways, the point is you had a map, and on this map if you went all the way to the left you came out on the right, and if you went down you came out up, but it was a flat square map. Very nice. Anyways, that was a nice game, no idea what the name of it was... I haven't seen a map projection of our planet that does that. What would you put in the middle? could you fit it into a square or would it be some sort of rectangular thing? Possibly an 8. I don't know.
bu....but you missed the Waterman Butterfly map projection. It's so pretty and mostly useless.
scishow you're making me smart
It's flat dude. Huge conspiracy. Total fact. People on YouTube told me so and I stand by it. Moon is a hologram and Saturn is where Satan lives.
Thanks for giving zero credence to that god-awful Gall-Peters the Sorkin-diehard hipsters are always raving about.
I hope that last little bit was foreshadowing of an upcoming episode on flat-earthers.
Amazing vid, as usual! Although isn't this geography and not science?
Its flat I know it but it must be one of the platonic solids.
But we can take a flat image of a part of the Earth from a satellite looking down... couldn't you just stitch a bunch of those together?
52 people are from the Flat Earth Society
Hank, Africa is actually more than 14 times larger than Greenland (30.3 million sq. km vs. 2.17 million), not 8x.
"huge areas of not map" -Hank Green 2k17
I remember Mapquest
The world is flat DUMBASS ????
someone should make kyrie irving watch this
tl;dw: no, you cannot. Buy a globe.
Wait wait wait wait.... The world isn't flat? Are you sure? I mean.... I've seen the ocean.... it ends....
My favorite map projection is the "Goode homolosine projection". It's called the "orange-peel map" because it has distinguished parts of it that resemble a range peel. I like it because of its compromise of global area. It doesn't look too weird, and it's very useful.
Flat Earthers are still too high in dimension to truly understand earth. Earth is not a 2 dimensional construction, but rather, a single dimension linear existence for which our simple minds perceive as three dimensional.
The earth is actually banana-shaped.
"'Around my anus' jokes" = "The Earth is flat"
I just want to ask flat earth believers to go to the edge of the world and take pics. See what they come up with.
i keep wondering /// what if you just forced all distances to be accurate on a flat surface
Twenty-sided die? I've never heard it called that. Isn't it easier just to use its actual name: icosahedron? Its one of the only five regular solids possible in Euclidean space.
But we all know white people use that map so they make Africa look smaller and their countries bigger
I'm really against genocide, but flatearthers make me think twice.
Russia big !
How old are you
Is it me or did every American learning channel make a video about this?
You have to be at a new level of ignorance to think the Earth is flat. To be more fair though, they are technically correct when they say the Earth isn't a sphere because it is an oblate spheroid.
Why yes, Hank, I am old enough to have used Mapquest. Thanks for making me feel like a crusty old hag today ??
love this
too bad, many people here starting to think the earth is flat and because of religious reasons
Why doesn't long hair get as tangled or knotted as wires do?
This reminds me of that Vox video recently.....?
Caught a mistake: At 1:50 the subtitles say "Nearly 14 times" But Hank says 8 times ps, the Subtitles are correct
the earth is a hollow cube
haha shout out to map quest :D
I know people who truly believe that the Earth is flat. Get angry and everything when you try to explain to them the Earth is round. Only in America.
the Earth was flat until your mom was buried.
The Earth is obviously a pentagram.
Flat Earth denier.
I had a cartographer once tell me "You couldn't possibly draw the continents accurately on a flat surface!" but I think he was just projecting.
Hank have you even watched an Eric dubey video?
I just use Google Earth. Problem solved.
Yes, I am old enough for mapquest.
43 Flat Earthers disliked this video.
visit my channel,i am beggining in youtube and i have many nice videos
Do a vid on eye contacts please
no, I mean I've never tried it, but I probably can't
jeeze mapquest?! was it really so long ago?
the world we know isn't real everbody quick raid your medicine cabinet for red and blue pills... nurse: doctor whats wrong with the patient? doc: he seems to have taken too much viagra and tylonal. nurse: will he be okay? doc: no, hes in a coma and has had an allergic reaction to the viagra his dick is now permanently 12 inchs... Wide.
I FORGOT MAPQUEST EXISTED DAMN I FEEL OLD
waterman butterfly
Wait, there are actually people that believe the world is flat?! Now THAT is something I can't believe^^ So they've never been to a beach then? Coz I certainly have been and I could not see the land on the other side, not even with my glasses on :D
Who remembers printing out directions from map quest?
yes i remember mapquest
Yes, you can have an accurate map. Just make a map in the shape of a sphere.
No love for the Pierce-quincuncial projection? It's got almost all the benefits of the Dymaxion projection without any fixed discontinuities.
I remember my mom using map quest on her iPhone 3G
I dont quite understand the issue here...yes if you take a sphere and flatten it it'll distort the image, but, we know the sizes of the continents and we know their distances from eacjother, so draw them to their proper scale and place them in proper relation to eachother. Whats wrong here?
Umm... If the earth is a sphere, then how come people below the "equator" don't just fall off? Flat earth confirmed.
I know mapquest! I am old enough!
use a mini globe
But the earth is flat
What about a map that makes the world look like a disk? It's what the flat earthers use. If you disregard it's relation to them, I'm sure it has some good map qualities
best video you have hosted glasses dude
Sometimes i feel like these guys just shorten Vsauce videos
why not just have 7 or so circular projections (one for each continent), as it would look from space? the edges of each one would be distorted due to being on the side of the sphere, but if you wanted to see that area of the globe, you would just look at the corresponding projection
He's talking about UTM coordinates. Universal Transverse Mercator. It's pretty much the gold standard in GPS coordinates.
Why is there earth around my anus?
Oswald Winkel sounds like a euphemism for flashing a moon. "....so I gave them the old 'Oswald Winkel', to show my distaste at their authority"
Africa is almost exactly 14 times the area of Greenland, not 8 (Africa is 11.7 million square miles, Greenland is 836000 square miles).
you and the flat earthers tho
Good old Map Quest.
Nice reverse psychology on the flat earthers. Get some of their clicks shhhh.
i love my framed BFI Dymaxion map-poster!
Like just for the Mapquest reference

How come I was better in social interactions when I was younger? and now I have, social anxiety, and well any other thing that separates me from social life... and when I was younger I was WAY more of an extrovert than an introvert, and now I am an introvert. WHATS UP WITH THAT?!
Respek mah ahpinion. This sphereical earth thang is a lie. /s

but what if you can flatten an orange peel cuz i can
you can if youre going the speed of light
But... but... recent studies suggested that the Universe is flat... therefore... Earth.
always follow directions from Les. "the road Les travelled"
please make a video on all the things we could/should agree with, flat world, distance on the earth, etc...
Flat Earthers make me want to throw something lol
how about new standard map of the world 1892 can you explain that ?
we are in 2017, for fuck sake, Cant we have 3d maps now. Fucking hipsters trying to hold back the world
Or I could just get a globe?
i went to Saskatchewan once, pretty flat.
Didn't Vox make a video on this like last week?
this is so great, last month I watched a vox video about this and now scishow is talking about the same thing
When a video like this can be made and West Wing is not referenced then I know I've gotten old.
37 flat earthers disliked this video
Waterman Butterfly projection few!
I remember mapquest
All the dislikes are just flat earth idiots ??????
I like the map on the UN's flag
OK I love this. I'm a geography minor and a geographic information science major and this is a huge thing for me. Also, Mercator can suck it
"how old are you? You old enough for that? Hope Wall street journal don't claim hank for a paedophile...
all these videos about maps, not one mentioning Gauss's theorema egregium. :,(
It WOULD be really nice if everyone agreed with that sentence.
Why not just make two circular maps of the northern and southern hemispheres
If the earth is really round, why don't the people in Asia fall off?!
a globe der
if the world is flat where are the edges?
The earth may not be flat, but my last girlfriend was most definitely, flat. Pirates delight, carpenters dream. A sunken chest, flat as a board. Founder and leading member of the ibtc. Her ass made up for it though.
If you go to Google maps and select the satellite version, head to Australia and then go up and to the right... Suddenly you get a view of one hemisphere of the Earth which, except for tiny islands, is nothing but water. The other side of the globe is only half land though... because the Earth is only 1/4 land...
This video was targeted at Kyrie Irving
OMG so Earth is like a sphere??? Who knew...
i love scishow very much but on this topic vsauce made a vid way more interesting. i think its called "what does the earth look like" . i hope im not being rude for the scishow crew.
how do ppl really believe the earth is flat? I can't understand their 15th century thinking.
I've watched the West Wing, I know these... but if Mapquest uses that form, does Rand McNally too?
I heard someone say maps. I got maps for yah...
When do you ever need the whole world on a flat map though, really?
i hope kyrie irving sees this hehe
Maybe it's even harder to make the world round ??
The flat thing isn't a silly trolling attention depraved poor excuse for a gag?!?!
can you make map of my dick
Which group is crazier? Flat Earthers or people who believe distorted maps is an evil plot of the white man?
The Earth is not flat or a globe. It's a Line, Obviously. 3D and 2D are a myth.
3:22 "shows that the Earth isn't flat" In your face flat Earthers.
The earth is flat.
I prefer to bring a globe on my road trips
Lol "How old are you, are you old enough for that"
Or ya know you could buy a globe...
There are still ppl thinking the earth is flat? xD
MAPQUEST.
http://mentalfloss.com/article/88138/more-accurate-world-map-wins-prestigious-japanese-design-award
I think this is what you call controlled opposition.
We only use physical maps now for small areas of land where the curve of the earth does not matter to us in a significant way. Everyone uses digital representations of the earth on their phones for maps which actually should be the most accurate to a globe because the phone usually scrolls across a 3D representation in the coding like when using google earth I think.
3D print the geography and oceans of the world to impresive detail in pieces like a puzzle
Mapquest still gives better directions than Google Maps for long distance travel. Just sayin
i was not old enough for that
without flat earthers we wouldnt have anyone to clean out the fryers, clean out the sewer pipes, spray harmful chemicals, pick up road kill to make pet food...we need these people that dont think because if they did they wouldnt do those jobs for us
Just old enough to recognize Mapquest, just barely too young to have used it for myself. ;P
It's crazy there's still people who think the earth is flat even nowadays.
You should have Eddie Bravo on, He'll set you straight on this!
4:00 I see that you did there
Wow, Hank got really sassy in this one :P
why cant you just draw every country the exact size it is on flat paper, just making the scale a lot smaller?
What about the Waterman Butterfly?
I feel like I've seen this before.
why cant you just draw every country the exact size it is on flat paper, just making the scale a lot smaller? if greenland is 10 cm long irl, just make is 1cm long on the map. Sure it'll be a large map but it'll be accurate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kyrie Irving doesn't approve of this video
oh no... here come the flat earthers....
Hey Hank, SciShow here.
I guess [number of dislikes] Flat-Earthers didn't appreciate your jokes.
of course it's flat. how else would the turtle carry it on it's back?
only the complete imbeciles believe that at earth is flat, despite a millennia's worth of evidence.
Possibly the only applicable use of Vector calculus
cough cough kyrie cough cough
love mas andre glodes
I'm waiting for a Saturday morning Trump tweet declaring round earth theorists to being false news.
Not a two-dimensional one. Globes are the only world "maps" that show all landmasses and countries in their correct scale.
You can tell he's really annoyed with flat-earthers
The best is a globe - and not a picture of a globe, which is an azimuthal projection), but a real globe. Anyone got a working holographic display yet? However, a globe suffers in that the viewer is not being able to see more than half the Earth at any time. Side-by-side comparison of, say, England and Japan is impossible without using two globes. Nothing is perfect, ll is compromise. Undertanding is the best solution.
I can't but Piri Reis can
But globes imply that the earth is spherical, which it is not.
1:51 Africa is not eight times the size of Greenland. It's more like fourteen times the size. Africa is about 30 million square kilometres, compared to the 2.1 million square kilometres that is Greenland.
@1:50 CC dont agree with what Hank is saying
While all you guys are roasting flat earthians, I'm perplexed that the americas perfectly resemble a duck.
Remember when your biggest pet peeve was the flat earthers? I miss those days.
How about Peter'S projection?
But why are there accurate maps around my anus?
What do maps and fish have in common? They both have scales
Since you all are on a map kick, could you do a GIS episode?
Shout out to map quest, which is only relevant when describing how old you are.
all you need is a basic understanding of the physical world to know no celestial body could ever be flat.
Did anyone watch Vox version of this video?
Eventually, it all comes down to peanut butter, right?
https://www.xkcd.com/977/
I actually saw this sentence once: "The flat earth society has members around the globe" Notice the irony?
"How old are you? Old enough for that?" excuse me
it's a disc on the backs of 4 elephants, on the back of a space turtle. duuuh
I am always fascinated by maps and how they influence how we see the world. Great topic scishow!!
You don't spell triple "tripel" in german. This word does not exist in that way. There is only the word "dreifach". It might be a latin derived word though.
Great video. Though you missed the whole Northern Hemisphere bias projections that tend to be so common that distort the Northern hemisphere to make it look bigger than the Southern hemisphere. I bring it up due to how changing a map projection can have serious social and political implications. Like the kid who made a Australia on top map, and was horribly attacked for his fun poke at the whole N is up S is down bias. He did it as a little fun and just to see what it would look like, but it got a lot of people horribly angry to suddenly see their northern country "on the bottom". It made them feel inferior and subordinate to the countries now on the "top", so very upset at this role reversal.
Im surprised i havent seen a comment asking, "Why is there an accurate map around my anus?" or something like it
seems the flat earth society has downvoted this video
I miss when the SCISHOW videos where fresh and original and not just EXACT copies of other smaller youtubers. This channel is looking more every day to dnews
You guys are so stupid the earth isn't flat or a sphere it's obviously a cube, the government has been lying to you all this time
You ever get the sense that Europe and Asia are the Alien queen? Think about it. Spain and Portugal are the head, Italy is the arm. Sweden and Norway are the tail and Russia and the rest of Asia are the egg sack. Anyone... or is it just me?
There are flat-earthers as far as the eye can see.
1:26 creepiest two seconds of sci show
Do a Tesla mini-series covering all his inventions and discoveries. this post will be posted on all future videos until we get the mini-series or response.
The world is actually a doughnut. MMmMmmmm doughnuts.
I've never been so uncomfortable in a scishow video @1:27.
Goes witch hunting in the comments for flat earthers
I CAN flatten an orange peel though! Grabs industrial press
The Earth is undeniably flat. SciShow is FAKE NEWS!!!! DONT LET THEM FOOL YOU IDIOTS!!! They are apart of the New World Order and they are lying to you.
And your high school teachers probably told you that the map was made this way to make Europe look bigger than Africa.
yes you can create an accurate map... in 3D
But why is there not an accurate map of my anus? Trolling aside, why hasn't there been any expeditions through Antarctica? Like, I've seen plenty around it but none through it. Or at least haven't heard of any.
Where is the banana dude with: "Why are there maps around my anus?" ?
You forgot to mention Transverse Mercator, intentionally I trust. Yes, there isn't any World maps in TM so it's actually out of the scope of this video.
Wouldn't a globe makes some distortions too considering it doesn't bulge out at the equator as the earth does?
there's nothing up there
Why is there a mercator projection around my anus
The "Round" earth conspiracy is the one of the greatest of all time, obviously the earth is a flat disk just like everything else that is spinning at high speeds in space. To assume that it is round actually makes no sense whatsoever.
Question to all of the flat-earthers: are you sure the north pole is really in the centre and not the south pole?
"And the 'Tripel' in the map name, is not a last name, it's just how you spell Tripel in german". Ok, but what is Tripel in German???
I want nothing distorted. And world peace. And a pony.
I create software that uses many GIS concepts with LiDAR. I had to teach myself about projections while on the job (software engineer). It's a very difficult field, and I have a huge deal of respect for the mathematicians, cartographers, and GIS individuals who make it all work. I've recently discovered the flat earther fad and took a look. I never comment on the videos because it most likely won't matter - I think it's funny that this video hinted at how ridiculous they are though. This is what I wanted to comment on their videos saying: If the earth was flat, how would the math I had to implement to convert coordinate system A to coordinate system B work to begin with (it's accurate down to a millimeter)? The math is indisputable. I appreciate SciShow covering this topic!
THIS EPISODE WAS SO GOOD, NOT THE NEUTERED STUFF THAT SCISHOW HAD BECOME
Awwwwww, no Waterman Butterfly? XKCD has made me unreasonably upset about this
Mollweide.
Fun fact: The Mercator projection doesn't give the shortest distance from A to B, but gives the compass heading you should maintain to get from A to B. Taking the shortest route is typically more complicated as the compass heading changes on the journey. Self Promo: For anyone interested, I did a video recently on how the flat earth map can actually be used to disprove the flat earth theory.
How about if yoooou, put it on a piece of paper?
thanks for not parroting that "Mercator = RACIST!" nonsense.
The flat Earth society has a lot of thinkers around the globe...
I waited for the important mention of Hajime Narukawa. :/
Best Screenshot of SciShow: http://prnt.sc/eggmgz
Fake news. Sad.
I always use MapQuest for my dopest routes.
It's you crazy "Round" Earth fanatics, always trying to wrap our nice flat planet around a sphere that are causing all the confusion, grow up people! Kappa!
Umm, the captions say that Africa is 14 times larger than Greenland, but Hank said it was 8 times as large.
I dropped the newly Seeker assimilated D News and kept SciShow. Stay independent folks!
So this is basically the Vsauce video about this topic but in short.
I have never actually seen a so called 'flat earther' in all my life, other than people parodying them. At this point I'm 60% convinced it is all a conspiracy in order to make me believe that humans are dumber than they are. And I'm going to keep believing that, because the alternative is too depressing.
If I were ever to meet a flat earther, I'd ask them to take me to the edge. If we ever got there, I'd push them off the edge. Mainly because they'd have spent the entire trip telling my how NASA faked the moon landing.
Mapquest? How young do you think we are?
Most maps are in fact racist and eurocentric as they make northern (white) areas much bigger than the minority areas like Africa. Maps were designed by white dudes for white dudes, so it's not surprising. UGH smh
Balderdash! The actual problem is that you cannot accurately represent the flat Earth in an oblate spheroid projection.
vsauce did it better xkcd 977
Mandatory relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/977/
Where's the good homosline?
What if I get a big boot and step on it?
I clicked on this to make a joke about flat Earthers, and Hank basically killed it in 3 seconds.
i wonder if someone has published a book that is maps of the world but in various projections, like on the left page is a projection and the right page is some information about the projection, like it's inaccuracies, it's common use and how it was developed. i would buy that book in a heartbeat if it existed
Flat-Earthers be triggered
I'm starting to be disappointed in humanity by people thinking the earth is flat. it's round-ish.
The flat Earth society has members all over the globe.
HANK IS ILLUMINATI
1:48 turn on captions
Thank you for not doing the thing that people so often do where they crap all over the Mercator projection as a useless projection and as a tool of imperialism blah blah blah. It's actually a really great map projection that I didn't fully appreciate until recently.
well 13 people do believe that the Earth is flat... FacePalm......
I like the dimaxion and the waterman butterfly
Vox already made a video on this subject.
I'm old enough for MapQuest
Mapquest was a waste of paper
Kryie Irving disagrees
The mercator projection only preserves small shapes. This is also true of all conformal maps; the mercator projection is actually famous because it makes rhumb lines (lines of constant bearing, what you call lines of true direction) straight. TBH, having rhumb lines straight doesn't help at all for modern non-compass navigation for which it's just as good as any other conformal projection. The real reason Mercator's used in those cases is that the US is weirdly attached to it; most of the rest of the world uses various compromise projections.
The flat earth society has members all around the globe.
"the earth is not flat" what kind of fake news is this?
unsubscribed because you are clearly a government round-earth shill. How can I trust you guys now? What has happened to academia????
Flat Earthers will say it's photoshopped..
The earth is a hollow cube and the entire universe revolves around it
Couldn't you just make a map that looks right, but wrong for navigation and all that shit. By taking mercator map and then shrink all "circles" to same size digitally. This would be useless for real world uses. But it would depict all land masses in their correct size to eachother. Similarly how there's more space in black holes, you could "dump" excess water volume by shrinking it a huge amount. ?????? I don't see why not.
In the comments: everyone pretending to be a flat earth believer. Let the comedy begin!
Short answer: Yes. Make a map on a globe.
hang on I'll ask my buddy Da venci..
you can't flat earth since it is a dinosaur
take a photo... done lets move on.
How dumb do you have to be to think the earth is flat? It's obviously a cube
The world is an icosahedron
I thought no one could possibly think the Earth was flat in the 21st century until I met someone who had 'proof' of it and wow just wow
Holy crap I'm early
Not one mention of the Society of Cartographers for Social Equality? Clearly Rosianna wasn't involved in this production. :)
Hank, whoever wrote that description of a Mercator projection for you needs to go back to map school. As with the Lambert, wrap the globe in a cylinder, but instead of projecting horizontally, project from the center of the globe. Hence, latitude lines get progressively farther apart with distance from the equator, and the poles never appear on a Mercator.
What would happen if you made an accurate globe of the world, like an ink stamp. And rolled it on a bit of paper until all the surface had been transferred to the paper?
I got a solution: Print it on a sphere, then use a hydraulic press to flatten it without changing it's topology or proportions.
Why are there a map projection of the earth that distort a certain aspect of the world in order to make more accurate other of his aspects around my anus?
At 1:49 Captions and video don't match... What do I believe??? Flat earth it is ??
How could you possibly forget the waterman butterfly ?
I'm flat.
The Flat Earth society... has members all around the globe. ^_^ (not my joke btw)
Did you ever notice how much effort they put into making sure they keep telling everyone that the earth is not flat you you wonder ? If the is not flat they have alot of explaining to do because tbe math in everyday experiments does not add up? I don't know about the some part but I haven't been able to find the curve and we checked it on a city 79 miles away and no curve so tell me how that works ?
Why yes I am old enough for Mapquest. Terribly inaccurate.
Globes aren't accurate either, seeing that the Earth isn't a perfect sphere in real life. The Equators are squished out and the surface is actually a bit uneven.
Hi there, SciShow! I would love for people to learn about the terrifying and sudden nature of cerebral aneurysms! I had one rupture at 19 and I think it would make for an interesting video topic!
1:26 Hank you sound creepy af tbh
umm lol ofc the world is flat wouldnt u just fall off the bottom if it were round lmao
LOL. I agree. I have seen lots of videos and comments lacking of common sense in a lot of subjects including the "flat earth".
flat earth is dead
there is no globe, we live on a flat plane "planet" ... Truth in plan sight.
Not sure if the flat earthers are bait or not.
I have a CONSPIRACY THEORY that MAYBE JUST MAYBE conspiracy theories..... ARE FUCKING BULLSHIT LIES THAT MORONS BELIEVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR OWN FALSEHOODS.
Inb4 he changed the title from ""Map Projections"
I'm a christian and in the bible its said that the world has edges, therefore it has to be flat. Silly scientists will never convince me over the word of God!
The thing about the shape of the world is just a flat out lie. :^)
Flat earthers are as dense as Africa is on a Mercader map.
I get the destinct feeling globes are gonna be mentioned in this...
was anybody else thinking of the xkcd comic throughout this whole video?
MapQuest...I remember it. Oh god. I'm not even 26.
the world is flat people
But why I have anus
I would be very interested in the Flat Earthers response if SpaceX offered to take them into orbit.
Only two Flatards so far.
I can draw a really nice mercator map by hand. Used to do it all the time when classes were boring.
No mention of Hajime Narukawa's Authagraph projection?
Preeeeety sure Africa is more than 8 times the size of Greenland. You're getting slack, SciShow.
1:51 "8x"? I thought it was nearly 14x Greenland's size
Nowadays it's hard to tell who's trolling and who is just an idiot on the Internet, what a time...
This video is a huge lie, every one knows the world is a decagonal prism
flat earthers should be steralized and forbidden from adoption and all of their literature should be wiped
Cant make the earth flat? challenge accepted
>not having the Waterman Butterflya n g e r y
Aw yeah, bought and paid for with that round-earth dollar smh.
so tired of map projections!  Those maps are always telling me I'm a flat drawing of geological surface features.
Hank says x8 but subs say 14x
I remember parents using map quest to get kids to birthday parties, but you had to have a printer.
cant flatten orange skin? challenge accepted
the world is flat. because trump Clintons, family and finally kyrie Irving said so, so the world must be flat
Africa is 13.98 times bigger than greenland, not 8 times bigger...
can i get 98 likes have a great day ????
The waterman butterfly is clearly the superior one.
It Earth IS flat!
You are just advancing Nasa's secret agenda! #Propaganda #WakeUpAmerica
The world is round? Sounds like fake news
Better idea, I make the world..... CUBE!
Notification squad??
Shut the fuck up no one cares
So you changed the title when you already published the video? Unsubbed, you scrubs. (?
This is basically just XKCD 977, though ;)
I remember when I was eight MapQuest being used by my parents
I guess the Robinson Projection didn't make the cut this time.
This is actually one of my favorite videos.
The Earth is "flat" if you define the word "flat" as spherical
flat earth believers are a bunch of idiots. why dont they all pool together some money and fly their idiot selves up to space? oh because they are afraid of finding out that they are morons.
This must be infuriating for Flat earthers.
Early
But but... it's easy to flatten an orange peel.
Hit that like if you are watching this on a flat earth
Why are there map projections around my anus?
I always hated when teachers had mercator projection maps on their walls
I am not early, as it is impossible to be early to a YouTube video. I am only slightly late.
Why there is map around my anus? :O
0:02 how to tell if someone is stupid.

Well now I understand that Robin Williams joke about Arthur Andersen ??????
There is no such thing as lost money. Someone made money. And probably a LOT of it.

Twenty O one? Wtf thats fucked up man, its two thousand and one!
I rarely celebrate someone’s death but with Ken Lay I did, he and Skilling caused huge personal harm to thousands of regular employees, they triggered divorce, bankruptcies and suicides. I hope his heart attack was painful and terrifying to him. They represent the perils of ultra capitalism where greed is not just good but justifies deception and theft.
The video really starts at about 4:30, everything before that is padding to hit 10 minutes. You're welcome
Please do a video on marchFirst...
I wonder if Jeff Skilling's brother will get him a job as a coffee boy at WGN TV when he gets out of jail
Lay and Skilling were lying sacks of shit that encouraged a culture of evil corruption.
I'm addicted to your videos lol.
They made so many laws after all of this. Now accounting is alot harder and the standards change constantly. You can have studends only one year apart and all of them will be practicing diffrent GAAP. It sucks as a student, you might be taking accounting one, next semester you have to relearn how to do somthing because they decided the last way wasnt transparent enough. This is supper annoying and i want to smash my head through a window more then i want to even when im making a statement of cash flows.
Damn i want to subscribe but the thing im intersted in you only made 2 videos for this one and the bernie madoff
0:00 "this is the most complicated shit ever" aand it's just a ponzi scheme
Does the E in Enron remind anyone of the E in Evil Corp in Mr. Robot?
I'm willing to bet most people under the age of 25 don't remember the Enron scandal.
Fuckers got my college money...
Houston was devastated because of this... it’s influenced our culture and infrastructure. The building is now occupied by chevron
Thanks Obama
You sound like Walter Jr from Breaking Bad
3:04 Just shut up and take my money! lol
President George W. Bush’s close personal friendship with Ken Lay is one of the reasons why I’ll always harbor a dislike for him. As Enron was responsible for a long series of rolling blackouts in California in 2000, the electricity bills of the state’s residents went through the roof. The cost of electricity was too expensive and the blackouts ultimately cost the state $30 billion. Energy executives and California’s governor knew something was wrong and so too did President Bush who publicly stated that the best way to manage that crisis was to be good citizens. Translation: “California is a blue state so why should a Republican bother to help?”
We have a former Arthur Andersen employee on our team and she is the most difficult person I've ever had to work with by a WIDE margin
I hate it when my 'mircophone' is too high.
I watched that movie at school
The Great Depression comes to mind. So much wrong doing and all the changes - Yeah, right
I would say no because they were closed down in 2007 3:00 Also no company expands that fast or booms that fast...
Work a few normal jobs, don't party, don't spend and you'll be a millionaire by your 30s, and stay away from women.
I hope if I was asked by my investor about getting Enron stock I would've said "Nah, gimme some of that Apple stock, and maybe some in this Amazon bookstore thing"
I like whoever this company man is and his videos but the background music in this video sucks
its not "twenty oh-one" you weird fuck. It's "two-thousand one". Say it like a normal human
"Two thousand one", "Two thousand six" Sorry, don't mean to be a jerk.
My professor just played your vid for the whole class as part of his lesson. Props!
Hi! I work at EY. More specifically, the Assurance area. That means I'm an auditor. So I have a small correction to make: Contrary to popular belief, auditors don't chase fraud. We don't actually care about it. We only have one procedure to detect fraud (Journal Entries) and even it isn't guaranteed to work every time. An auditor job is to cross a company internal financial and accounting records. If both say the same thing, we sign on to those records. There are SOC audits (System and Operation Controls) that audit the inner functioning of the company. The main thing is, we work on the assumption that the company isn't lying to us. And 99% of the time, they aren't. Auditors work based on materiality and sampling. We don't go through every account and record to look for fraud. That is why you will never see an auditor to guarantee 100% accuracy on our statements. We only guarantee "an reasonable level of accuracy". A 100 billion company can have a few million not accounted and be completely ok for it's auditors because it's not material.
TL;DNR they lied their tits off.
Sounds like Sal O’nella
Enron fucked California bad.
I still remember the rolling blackouts here in Cali in the early 2000s from the mismanagement of power due to Enron's tactics.
Capitalism DOES NOT WORK!
Do the Hudson’s Bay Company! They have such a cool history and we’re one the largest landowner in the world.
Here's a video idea: the Bre-X scandal. It was a Canadian mining company that specialized in gold and other precious metals. They claimed they had aquired the minera l rights somewhere (I think it was in Tailand, but my memory might be wrong). The company's geologist claimed that the area was tbe highest consentration of gold he ever saw. The company's shares sky-rocketed. Then, the news leaked that the geologist was completely wrong, and the shares dropped below 5 cents.
I know Republicans will howl to the moon, but you see the answer to this is GOVERNMENT REGULATION of the right kind. Imagine if the government had said "no you don't get to pick who does your audit. there are five major firms. they will each do your audit every year in turn". As I learned from watching "The Big Short" if a rating agency or accounting firm has an incentive to lie to appease their clients, they will. Forcing rotation will ensure they can do their job, because they know they will get paid even if they tell the truth.
Just bought some blockbuster stock!!!
Big oof
Enron & 9/11 are connected...
Honestly
I want to commit fraud too!!!
The documentary about this company was incredible! I couldn't believe the turn of events. I don't think the best writers in Hollywood could have done better.
rambling presentation
The audit firms should be criminally liable for any variances or discrepancies of the financial and managerial accounting of the companies they audit.
The Enron Scandal was used to drive up the cost of Electricity; any thing else loss or gained was just a side show.
twenty-O 1 that kills me a bit XD still an interesting video
After Enron, Lehman Brothers. When Fortune says you’re a top company, you’re a scam.
I used to work at a chemical plant and Enron had a unit in our facility. When this all went down, we watched them all walk out with their belongings. Was really sad to watch so many people lose their jobs and pensions.
Jeff Skilling got out of prison today. Thought you might want to know.
Crazy to think that there are kids learning this in high school today who weren't even alive when it happened. I remember the problems with the power grid that summer. There were ripple effects along the entire Western grid. Seattle's skyscrapers turned out their lights at night that year to conserve power.
Ah, the good old days when Company Man called the years by their correct names..
You said "twenty oh one" and "twenty oh six" instead of "two thousand and..." lol what a goof
my grandparent invested with them. and got fucked over by them. i still have some coffee cups and pens somewhere.
Hopefully Arthur Anderson auditors that are responsible did some time.
@8:22 Twenty oh six? Do you mean two thousand and six? Back to high school for you.
"20 year contract with blockbuster" Lmao
Got a "get rich quick" scam commercial during this video. The irony...
One can say a major part of the scandal has to do with stock manipulation. A number of inside executives probably knew what was happening. They were first to own Enron stock and first to exit before the big downward spiral and made millions in profits. The rest who didn't sell in time lost their investments.
Enron makes me look like Mother Teresa!! - Lucifer
Enron is exactly what you get when you give big business exactly what they want and what they all want is to do whatever they want when they want with absolutely no oversight.
I live in Houston and I knew 2 people who work there and they told me it was great to work there before the collapse
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
What was the Jewish role in this?
Something went enron-g
My porn name is Ken Lay
Twenty-oh-one? wtf ??
Another brilliant video, I have 2 questions - 1. Didn't Enron realize that putting fake numbers in their books, etc crash someday.. There is no way out of it? 2. Were the audit company CEO punished? Given jail time? Anything?
I seen the movie, it’s a good one. Also check out “the big short” about the housing market bubble. Good work man, new sub
M. Yass
I'm sorry, I fell asleep through most of this video.
didn’t they buy a nuclear reactor in india or something?
This review is very partisan
As someone going to school for forensic accounting, this is so fucking interesting to me. Great video.
THE GAIN ON THE MICROPHONE IS TOO HIGH!!!!!!!! OMG OMG OMG WTF
bruh whats ya accent?
I bet on Blockbuster back in the time they did this deal with Enron. I thought streaming + brick and mortar locations would make it much better than Netflix at the time. It's unfortunate that Blockbuster went under but Redbox and Netflix thrived.
Read the book while in prison, I think it was something like a 1500 pages, god it was dull but man was it crazy to watch it burn to the ground. Feel very bad for the employees
Nortel Networks would have never gone bankrupt if not for Enron. The Enron scandal freaked out and scared the board of directors of Nortel Networks. So they hired a law firm, WilmerHale, to check over the books. In about a month WilmerHale came to the wrong conclusion that the books were cooked. The CEO and CFO were then fired and were charged with fraud. This ultimately led the stock to crash and for everyone(customers, creditors, investors...) to loose confidence in the company. Thus Nortel went bankrupt. Several years later the CEO and CFO were found innocent of all charges that had been brought against them.
Great video but I had to watch this on 1.25x speed ??
My mom worked at Arther Anderson
I'm going to call it now - Tesla is showing a LOT of signs that Enron had in the late 90s & early 2000s.
Let me guess...company man is a CPA
Do you think 9/11 was created to divert attention from this and how a trillion was missing from the octagon?
“Twenty oh-one”
Enron Ascending: the Forgotten Years will be published next month covering the beginning of Ken Lay's career as CEO through 1996. Some surprises about how precarious Enron was during the Lay\Kinder era.
E. Corp (Mr.Robot)
Can you discuss Goldman Sachs?
Soo, what's the song playing throughout the video?
Can you name a single crime committed by Arthur Andersen? Because 9 Justices on SCOTUS said they didn’t commit any. Just curious.
Not really complicated it’s very simple. They changed the laws LITERALLY - they actually didn’t break any law. They just rigged the rules & completely manipulated the rules of accounting BUT were completely within “the law”. They did legally bribe elected officials by giving their spouses high money contracts. BUT that’s NOT illegal.
Enron was basically run by criminals. A close friend worked for Ma Bell, (AT&T), for 30 years, and was hired away by Enron to be a mid-level manager. He took his SBC, (one of the Baby Bells), retirement in a lump sum, over $400,000.00, and was convinced by Enron to put it ALL into Enron stock, (just before the crash). Yep, he lost his entire life’s retirement over-night. I also worked for SBC at the time as a power tech, and Enron was our power provider. As Enron started going under, they told the upper SBC management that if SBC would use its Emergency Generators to produce our own office power, Enron would pay us for every KW we generated, then they could sell the power that we would have used, to other customers. Of course this would have been VERY illegal, because SBC was only licensed to generate power in case of a power outage. When an SBC executive sent an E-mail out asking all power techs how much fuel we had on hand to generate our own power, (and get paid by Enron), I forwarded that E-mail to the our local Air Quality District, and THE CRAP HIT THE FAN! When the dust finally settled, SBC got a reaming by the Air Quality people, and did not follow through with Enron’s hair-brain, (and highly illegal), scheme.
These theives should have been murdered. So many people lost everything because of them.
Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is one of the most fascinating documentaries I've ever watched. My capstone made it required viewing.
I love videos like this. Content made for adults with a working brain.....not like pewdiepie....and sorry for comparing this amazing channel with that content cesspool. Keep up the great work.
Well-structured, informative videos with nice background music. You just got a new sub.
Aannd it's gone!
E Corp
what the heck is a mircophone??
"IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN" Fast forward about 7 years to the 08 collapse "SHIT WHAT ARE THE ODDS" I hate people sometimes.
“twenty oh six”
Crikey....Even after watching this and having lived through the scandal, seeing Ken Lay making his pitch in the final moments of this video has me wanting to dig up his carcus in hopes he's still alive to find out what new investment strategies he has. He was quite the bullshit artist. Totally believable even after the fact.
The Enron scandal makes for a good reminder of how easily corruption can run deep, far, and fast.
I thought ENRON was a rapper... it sounds like a rapper name! “Hey man! I’m gonna go see an Enron concert on Friday!”
Twenty-oh one? Seriously?
couldn't you find a better song for the video? jeezzzzz 10 min listening the same rhythm.. like 80s porn. damnn..
Evil corp
Do a video on Takata airbags! The worlds LARGEST recall almost 5 million airbags recalled, 3 high executives have been jailed due to neglect
Please do a video on Takata airbags!!!
PWC is a piece of shit shady accounting firm too...they pulled the same scam in India with satyam computers...almost like a blueprint of Enron... But got away Scot free... They still operate unhindered & god knows how many such scams they're helping pull off currently!!
What does Enron mean?
Biggest bankruptcy, eh? Oh boy were they wrong.
10 Minutes was 9:30 too long. They were allowed to do "mark to market" accounting. Count your potential profits 10 years from now on this year's tax return. Bush, Clinton, Bush 43...all the same. They allowed it. Corporations aren't the problem. The fucking government is the problem! But let's pass gun laws that allow the gov't to take citizens' guns, cuz that'll give the gov't less power, right? Dumb ass fuckin liberals
"well respected, has incredible revenue growth, low debt, and a solid history of unheard stock growth" Me: Incredible as in not credible, as in not to be believed; unheard of growth because it shouldn't be possible for a company to grow that quickly - seems a bit suspicious... "and if you said no, that's a foolish answer at the time" Me: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
bush started selling his stock before the enron crisis. i call it BUSHRON
So many enrons still exist. I work for one.
can you do one of TD (Toronto-Dominion) bank
I am a day trader. And I have been investing the last 4 years. Tge question is How does Enron make money? How. Dont give me the oversimplified amswer. But describe to me in depth and detail how do they make money? In Enrons case nobody knows. Hmmmm seems to good to be true. I think I will short Enron amd buy some put options no need to hedge against them. They are Enron. They cant even tell you how they make money.
everyone knows ken lay is not dead. he is partying on some carribean island with whitman, price, and haddad
So mark to market is just lying.....just posting fake numbers right?
I remember Lewis Black has a really good joke about Enron. (Don't remember the exact wording so I might be paraphrasing a bit.): If you have a company... and you can't explain in one sentence, what it does... it's illegal.
To be honest, "Enron - The smartest guys in the room" shows it's age a bit in it's understanding of the scandal (which was fairly recent at the time of the documentary's production) If you're interested in getting a more comprehensive understanding of the events, I recommend reading "Conspiracy of Fools."
I point out that Ken Lay died on an island so he got off
I liked the video, but what I was hoping for was an in depth explanation of how Enron manipulated the California Energy market. Starting with 1) Enron's core business: Natural gas, and expansion into energy trading. -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron 2) The changes in Californian law: Partial deregulation (California) vs Full Deregulation (Pennsylvania) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis#Effects_of_partial_deregulation and the parts of the law that other states had that California did not. - California lacked a California Electricity First policy, where generators of electricity could sell to other states, but first had to meet California's energy needs. - Like every other state that deregulated. 3) Yes, Megawatt laundering, Over scheduling, and Market manipulation: However no one delved into how/why Enron controlled not only the price of Electricity, but the price of Natural Gas, and How the increased price of natural gas (manipulated by Enron and other Natural gas pipeline owners) unlocked price caps on the whole sale market. 4) Also which other companies had to help Enron achieve this: * El Paso Corp. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso_Corp.#Criticism * Reliant Energy: http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/16/business/fi-reliant16 * Dynegy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynegy#Dynegy_history & https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2002/11/18/weekinbiz.html * Duke: https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/us/california-power-failures-linked-to-energy-companies.html * Other companies: http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-energy-crisis-reparations-2014jun18-story.html * Other sources: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/blackout/ 5) Or the bankruptcies of SCE - Southern California Edison: https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html & https://www.elp.com/articles/print/volume-79/issue-11/features/industry-news/southern-california-edison-dodges-bankruptcy-bullet.html 6) Near bankruptcy of PG&E - Pacific Gas and Electric: https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html & https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Files-for-Bankruptcy-9-billion-in-debt-2933945.php & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company#Bankruptcy 7) Or how SDG&E - San Diego Gas & Electric avoided the financial harms that came to PG&E and SCE: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-electricity-ferc-ruling-idUSBRE87Q13K20120827 8) Or How a minor player in electricity market of California, Enron, could manipulate the market owning PGE - Portland General Electric - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_General_Electric 9) Or how California's Energy prices were linked with A) Not In My Back Yard, attitude B) Drought in the Pacific North West, C) California's reliance on Energy imports. 10) Or how the California Energy Crisis happened during Winter in California, when they had excess generating capacity. Anyways, Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room was an excellent movie, but they didn't dig deeper into the reasons why California was ripe for manipulation. PBS Frontline: Black Out California Energy Crisis did a pretty good job in film, but online is where it really thrived. Anyways, I hope this actually gets read at some point by someone, and do your own research. I think you will be blown away how simplified the movie's explanation is. 11) They didn't even explain which wall street firms helped Enron created the "Black Box" or what the "Black Box" actually did for Enron.
Watch Enron. The smartest guys in the room. It’s soo good. And u see how shady they really were.
Thank you for you video. I have never heard of mark-to-market accounting until now. I am not finish with learning accounting but i was taught accrual and cash accounting was mention.
Yes and no. If you look at the pre 2001 paperwork from enron then sure they looked good. If you asked what they did not so much. It was a hollow shell. They didn't produce anything. They didn't provide anything. They sold others services at a markup. The granddaddy of all middle men. So what did enron do? They were the front end for other companies just dead weight to be cut.
What company was more fraudulent, Enron or BreX?
9/11 attacks happened to destroy all the Enron evidence the Feds had stored in WTTC 7. Bush was VERY connected to all this. Trump. Knows and he is going to disclose the entire Scandal soon.... Very very soon.
Please do a Video with Bright sun films on his bankrupt series or your what happened series
It was Walpole.
Comment on anything? It's "two thousand six," not "twenty oh six." I have heard people say "oh six" for brevity, but you really don't accomplish a syllable reduction saying "twenty oh six," do you? Instead it just sounds dumb.
Why were the people that profited from the dirty dealings not required to repay the people who lost their pension money and the investors who got cheated?
Expect further scandals from the fracking industries who have been issuing huge amount of debt to cover their losses. Some of this debt goes well into the 2020's with no guarantee that oil will still be being produced. So how are they going to meet their debt obligations. Also our friend Donald is deregulating banks so expect even more scandals on the finance side. The World is perched on a huge debt bubble - it's going to go bang very soon.
KPMG is going the same way
So I'm not a financial person, but from what I understood of this video: Enron promised to mow the yard, but only filled up the mower before getting tired. They then claimed that since the smallest first part of the chore was done, the whole yard was basically done. They also claimed the yard would always be mowed in the future, because their imaginary friend had agreed to take over the chore. I know that's a gross oversimplification, but did I get the gist?
I'm sure Trump will hire that guy when he gets out of prison next year...
At least they had a good logo
Enron: "We are on the side of angels"
The short answer is that they "cooked the books." But that's not accurate. What they did was not report the hundreds of millions they were spending on paying people with stock options. This was 100% legal and when Congress considered changing this rule there was a major lobbying effort to stop it, and they were successful. So when people acted shocked about Eron's fall, it was seen years in advance and Congress allowed it to continue.
I think the first line in The Smartest Guys in the Room sums Enron to pretty well: “It had taken Enron 16 years to go from $10 billion in assets to $65 billion in assets. It took them 24 days to go bankrupt.”
The only comment I have is that, at the end there, you said "in American history" way too many times. Love ur vids!!
Killuminadi
Much as I hate to admit it, the best, comprehensive history on the ins and outs of Enrons rise and fall is Ken Eichenwald's book. You throw words like fraud and crime around, but the sad fact of the story is that all of the "crimes" committed were technical violations of accounting limits and interpretations of arcane relationships. Just like the mortgage crisis, 99% of what they did was legal, sanctioned and even encouraged by the government. Funny how the government is never held responsible though.
Sounds like MCI. I was there near the end and got fired i was relieved and ran. All we did was lie with word play even at the lowest of sales levels.
I’d say “we can all look back on it” as an interesting example, sure, but don’t forget there are families still affected to this day by the crimes these men willingly and knowingly perpetrated - they were the major victims of this scandal and they left with, in most cases, nothing, which meant many people who were on the brink of retirement were then forced back into the workplace to work out the remainder of their years. Meanwhile people at the top, including Jeff Skilling, knew what was going on - they engineered it. And those who paid were working families, and taxpayers, electricity consumers — the general population — and they bore the brunt of the pain their actions caused. Meanwhile that piece of shit Skilling gets a reduction of his sentence while men incarcerated for far less or even in some cases, nothing at all, spend far longer in jail than he or his class ever will.
9/11 happened
That “unheard stock growth” reminds me of Boeing today. Ditto Amazon. And gosh knows how many others.
I didn't realize that Ken Lay was dead. I remember the Enron scandal as I was a freshman in high school and in one of my classes we got Newsweek and I remember reading about ti some back at the time in Newsweek.
I'm now convinced that the inspiration for Arrested Development came from the Enron scandal.
Great video. Just want to add a few points: 1. Faking revenue is a small portion of the scandal, the big part is recognizing revenue through related party transaction where the cost and loss were literally ignored. 2. Maybe it's a good idea to bring up the SOX act as a direct consequence of this scandal, which changed everything in public company financial report. Executives are now required to sign off the financial report, so in case things go wrong they cannot argue on the court that they didn't know about it, like Skilling did.
Please do not say Twenty Oh-Six. Its pronounced Two-Thousand Six
Ahhhh Conservative personal responsibility...
Jeff Skilling is my hero.
Great videos! Keep it up :) !!!!
mark to market, you are welcome
I'll tell you what happened, something went enwrong I'm sorry
You didm't explain shit. You went over a general overview, thats it mate.
I find this video very informative. Practically speaking, despite changes in rules, this type of thing can happen again and probably will. I believe there is really only one way we can really know a company is sound and not cooking it's books – dividends. Enron, I think started to pay a dividend right before everything blew up (probably as a ruse or distraction of some sort). But when you look at a company such as Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble which have been paying dividends and raising those dividend amounts for over half a century, it means only one thing – financial soundness. Companies like Amazon and Tesla concern me. They are well respected, have lots of hype, but don't turn profits and cannot pay dividends. I hope that they don't turn out to be the next Enron.
Arthur Anderson is now Anderson Global.
see www.apfn.org/apfn/rule.htm
Then they formed EOG...at least the exploration side of their energy division did.
Maybe you really watered it down,, but it doesn't sound complecated at all. They fudged there numbers to look more appeling, and opened up side companies as a type of money laundering but with debt. meanwhile lying about their profits and stocks to investors and auditors, and pocketing the money they could. Thsts not complicated to understand at all
The Smartest Guys in the Room is also a 400+ page book that goes into WAY WAY WAY more detail and is a fantastic book.
Liz phair has a song call fuck and run. The chorus is "fuck and run" But to me it always sounds like "fuck enron".
His coffin was closed... I don'r believe that Ken Ley is dead. Probably on a private island in the Grenadines with his own 5 hole golf course.. Curious that his ill gotten gains went to his family.. If I robbed a bank and died, would my family inherent the loot?
We had a family friend who had a high level position at Enron. After shit started to hit the fan, he was found dead in his car as a supposed “suicide”. Most of us who knew him have a REAL hard time buying that Suicide explanation as he just wasn’t that type of individual. We’ll never know for sure what happened but all of us believe their was foul play afoot.
Wood U invest. -Hell no, I don't trust anything that seems too good to be true Sometimes I dont reap fat cat rewards butt I also don't get sucked down I make moderate gains with low/mid risk investment spread around.
"Whenever something seems too good to be true".....
Enron for dummies
Enron was a pack of alpha males who saw what they wanted and took it. Then, of course, all the snowflakes started whining about a bunch of ham & eggers who lost their life savings--savings that amounted to peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Ken Lay is vilified for one reason and one reason alone: he was a real MAN.
Enron was a horrible company, and it somewhat destroyed the Republican Party in ways the Republican Party has yet to recover from and may never recover from.
several years ago,I was working at a Re Power Trash to energy project. the steam turbine & generator was destroyed in a fire, so my union hall called us to do the replacement, what arrived at the job site was all the necessary items to build a new power plant. along with a group of engineers from Germany's Siemens Westinghouse, because the generator,Steam turbine had to be converted to run, I had no Idea Enron had an international arm. because all the crates were stamped "Enron Panama" our joke on the job site to the German Engineers was "At least you & us Will be getting PAID ! ! ! A year later,You know what happened. As far as I know, the power plant is still running,(At least I still see steam venting from the plant that was back in the beginning of 2018
Something must’ve went en-wrong
Great video. I’ve read the Blockbuster deal rort was under a mark-to-market accounting rule but it would have been useful to describe the exact mechanism. According to the NYTimes article they “sold” the future profits and so counted it as a financial transaction and thus classified it as revenue, with AA’s approval. The bank they sold it to had a “no loss” contract so they considered it a loan. Dodgy as frig. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2002/01/30/business/enron-s-many-strands-the-accounting-fuzzy-rules-of-accounting-and-enron.html
Funny but true, upon retirement from the Armed Forces, Enron offered me a job not sure why but my gut said no and I excepted a lower paying job at another company. I might have dodged a bullet and didn't realize it because like the other employees I would have been buy the stock as well.
what's the song?
I worked for a company in 2001 that did an analysis of Enron's publicly available financial statements for the 1998, 1999 and 2000. They concluded you could not assess their financial condition. That is always a red flag, and turned out to be true. They found the same for GE and AIG, both of which like Enron were darlings on Wall Street but needed to be rescued in the financial crash. And GE has been a poor performer now for over a decade. Lesson: If you can't understand the financial condition of a company from its public records, be careful. You are buying a guess.
Crime does pay
Hey I rewatched this video cause some one on the news mentioned Enron and compared today's current Theranos scandal, its really insane how companies can get away with lying to us until hell breaks open.
Do a video on the fall of MF GLOBAL. will learn how shady democrats were under the Obama Regime by allowing the CEO off the hook because he was the former democratic NJ Governor, and OBAMA campaign contributor.
Mark to Market accounting was the beginning of the end for that company. That was when the fraud started. Then to cover up for the fraud, they fleeced California and engineered an energy shortage to drive up prices. Ultimately, even that scam came to an end and they began stashing debt in fake companies and then that scam could not keep going and the top CEO's began selling off stock.
FUCK SOX its such a pain in the ass
I highly recommend reading the book (same name as the documentary). Goes into much more detail of the rise and thundering crash of Enron

Might be a small/odd deal to look into but what about tech website TigerDirect and Newegg if possible.
Twenty o six ?? What the fuck
at 3:22 "practically anyone who knew anything about the stock market would say to jump on it" ... and that, right there, is crux of the problem. Everyone who invests needs to finally realize, that all the stock market is...is gambling. Stop trying to elevate it like it's something more sophisticated or certain than a casino or the horse races. There is really nothing else any deeper to it. It's legalized gambling. Period. And stock brokers are just glorified bookies who give you tips based on what they THINK they are seeing, which is not always what's actually going on. Otherwise, no broker would have advised "betting" on Enron at all. And even In horse racing, a horse might APPEAR to be the fastest horse on the track based on past performance. That won't tell you a thing about how that horse will perform on the day you finally choose place bet on it. Stock Market = Gambling.
“And Ken lay is dead”
Two things. It's shocking how many people continue to put all of their money in one thing. Secondly, I hate how the leaders of major scandals like this often only get a moderate to light prison sentence. Especially the banking leaders prior to the financial crash.
Good info!
they should be execuated for the frauid
Would have made a fortune if you shorted them
the EA scandal please
...just love your videos.. ????
blockbuster was about to beat netflix to it but they got fucked over by enron, then they went out of business
Whoa.. Enron orchestrated blackouts?? This is better than a movie
I was an employee of Northern Natural Gas Company and we purchased Houston Natural Gas because we had too much money and were a target of corporate raiders. The first name chosen for the new company was Enteron which was discovered to mean a digestive track. They decided on Enron. The new company eventually severed us from the company and we were forced to sell our Enron stock. It seemed at the time it was splitting every year. I cashed in my Enron stock and reinvested it elsewhere. Some friends of mine rolled over their 401k’s back into Enron. They lost everything. I had 1/2 half of a share that eventually was worth about 1200 dollars. I never did sell that share and it went down to about a buck. I still remember Kenneth Lays wife on television complaining because they had to sell one of their homes in Vail. Unfortunately Lay was never sentenced because he died prior to his sentencing. He was never convicted because he was never sentenced. His number 2 Skilling is the brother of Tom Skilling a Channel 9 weatherman in Chicago. He is still in jail.
lol had to watch this again
Twenty-oh-six.
This is why I always look into someone or the company just to see if they are legit.
Something went Enwrong - Barbara Punkelman
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were crooked as they come. But they weren't stupid by any means. They were actually brilliant if you consider what they managed to pull off for so long. Now, if they just would have put all that brain power into running a legitimate business....
"Enron is a company . . ." [pause in which I thought, in response]: "And we are a society."
did anyone else hear him pronounce 'money' as 'mone-y?'
Sadly, the lessons of Enron didn’t stick. The next one is just waiting to happen. Makes me worry about Bitcoin.
"We mean what we say and we say what mean." Good one.
M
My mother worked for Enron. She always talked highly of the company but due to this scandal our lives and many others were changed.
My finance teacher talked about how his old boss' company made a huge investment in Enron and his logic behind was "fellas, it's Enron". And nobody could come up with any reason to not make the investment
>twenty-oh-six You mean two thousand and six?
4:04 Twenty Oh-One??
I remember the enron scandal breaking in the news in july & august of 2001, so I have the question, is it true that the paperwork/evidence for the enron collapse was kept at the offices of (iirc) the securities & exchanges commission in WTC building 7 at the time of 911 ----- as finding that george w. bush had "ties" to enron in combination with donald rumsfeldts (iirc) televised announcement of a "black hole" in the military /pentagon accounts on september 10th, either very coincidental or somewhat suspicious.
EOG....
"Twenty Oh One" that's a funny way to say 2001
That guy who didn't invest in Enron is no longer kicking himself.
There's a book called "Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron." Maybe it'll be a good read for y'all
What really makes the whole Enron thing disgusting is that they were turning off the power to drive up the price of electricity, and people were dying because of it. There are many tainted souls belonging to Enron...
rallys and checkers
President Bush had Ken Ley killed to cover his ass. Ken was about to blab to the feds to stay out of prison so Georgie had him killed to keep any wrongdoing he did from coming out. They made it look like a heart attack. Bush got a lot of money from Enron during his campaigns for governor and president and was close friends with Mr.ley.
Should do a video on Beaufort securities fairly recent scandal
Sounds like bitcoin and all the crypto currency crap
When your company has the nick name Crooked E perfect......there was one guy who got away and took $350million with him he is now the second largest private land owner in the state of Colorado...he left 1 year before shit hit the electric fan
Ken Lay faked his death to get out of the punishment. He bought off whoever he needed to. Absolute scum, deserving of a painful death.
The book "The smartest guys in the room: The amazing rise and scandalous fall of Enron" will give you the full scope of the fraud better than the movie or any other book. You may have to re-read the middle section involving the machinations of Enron's CFO. Very byzantine financial transactions.
Wonderfully? done..I'm going to binge watch your other videos and I subscribed... great job..
I had a session based on Enron & Arthur Enderson fraud, when I joined KPMG, and they told me about the Independence and Risk trainings, etc which is quite important for these audit firms now.
That movie you mentioned, Enron the smartest guys in the room, is beyond jaw dropping. What these guys did is almost completely inconceivable!
"You don't want another Enron? Here's your law: If a company, can't explain, in one sentence, what it does... it's illegal." - Lewis Black
Can't believe my broker (at the time) talked me into Enron and WorldCom, I was in my 20's and was hoping to make lots of money off those stocks smh
When Enron started to fall apart I had a long talk with my boss about the business aspects. Was it an innovative company that hadn't worked out? Was it a scam? And what was the difference?
I still refuse to buy into my enormous company's stock plan because of the Enron scandal. I just stick with the S&P500 index fund. If I go down, we all go down!
"In 2000, Enron signed a 20 year contract with Blockbuster." HAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH Yeah, "profits".
Do you have a video on circuit city? If not. Make one.
I must say thank you for posting this. It gives me an idea of my reaction paper in 10 minutes i have my 2 pads of reaction. Thank you.
Going through all of your videos. You do a great job! Keep it up!
Evil corp
I lost everything I had
do a video on Worldcom :D
I get perverse pleasure as a bit of an anti-capitalist watching videos of these failing enterprises.
10:25 shit like this is why nobody really cares about a company's vision or mission statement, its all just bologna to look wholesome
Valient was worse
my dad hates Enron. he's an accountant so he was mad because they caused a bunch of rule changes and stricter regulations that would effect his work and any other accountant's work
Make a video about the auto company bailouts
In twenty oh one
It's En-Enron.
Thankyou so much. This would help me a lot for my presentation!
Wait, I still don't get how people found out? What caused these shady tactics to be discovered.
Never heard of Enron
Video rated E for Enron
Energy speculation........how is that even a business?
Thanks for the info
From what I've read, George w Bush would have been in huge trouble over this if not for 9/11.
I think something went enwrong :(
the end .. lol
South sea company but in the 20th century
its crazy to think 2006 was 15+ years ago... Feels like it was 2010 was just yesterday. geez time flies.
The strict rules from the accounting errors from ENRON worked out really well for the maddoff caper :)
amazing video & channel
I had a cousin who worked at Andersen. The day they went belly up they were actually selling the furniture at their NYC offices. Ironically, because she was a singer and not someone looking to move up in the company she had a better chance to recover than others. Also there's nothing worse than to lose your name off an NYC office building.
Greek term for digestive system or intestine Eneteron, and exit of biggest scandal in america history was Shit.
The smartest guys in The room is one of my favourite documentary of all time.
Other companies were in on it and got away.
You sound like a fucking weasel
What a Bitcoin
Tesla did that same shit to hide their debts.... Tesla said they paid off their loan when they haven't even made that much money yet... do some digging and you will find that the loan wasn't paid off BUT transferred to another company....
Was Enron really bigger then Apple or Microsoft? That is what the video says right?
Didn't Kenneth Lay allegedly fake his death?
its a fascinating documentary. Well worth the watch.
I love your youtube channel, its so entertaining!
Q: When Enron closed, what was it's most valuable in-office asset? A: It's Risk Management Manual which were selling on eBay for $1,000 each.
It took down Arthur Andersen.
Twenty oh six
So basically, they pulled a lot of the tricks that other companies pull sometimes, but just went crazy with it.
They helped get rid of Governor Grey Davis, thank you Enron.
Cool logo though! Who designed it?
Ken Lay. Hope he is roasting in hell!
Thanks for this condensed version about the Enron fiasco.
If you really want an in-depth look at this company's shinanigans, give the book "Conspiracy of Fools" a read. By Curt Eichenwald. (I don't know how you spell his name and I'm too lazy to look it up) It's shocking.
spooky
All the executives involved in the scandal should have faced a firing squad for their crimes!
so kinda a off topic trading but in your mock up you use there shareholders reports as evidence to invest. wouldnt that be insider info?
I worked for Arthur Andersen, consulting division which became Accenture before the ship sank.
Its called mark to market because you're a mark if you act on it
Background music sounds like a knockoff version of Watermelon in Easter Hay, by Frank Zappa.
Please do Nortel
very well explained
someone should hire a team to eliminate ALL the enron execs. They crushed people's futures and way of life. Others at the top need to be taught a lesson.
Something went EnWrong
it was the equivalent of bitconnect
Investing in Enron the original bitcoin?
E corp
Iam a management student, I have learned that failure of expansion and lack of making strategies caused its down fall, to what extent is that true???
You should make a video on Napster
more content please... this channel is awesome. thanks in advance
What's the difference between this company and insurance companies?
I was born and raised in Houston. Despite being 13 at the time, I remember watching all of this go down as it happened. We had family friends who worked for Enron come and stay with us because they went from making upper five to lower six-figure salaries to being essentially homeless. You're right about one thing: there were many, many victims in this scandal. This was a good video and you did a job good summarizing the intensely outrageous monstrosity that was Enron.
Holy shit it's E Corp
the smartest guys in the room is one of my favourite documentaries. Enron was totally freaky crazy shit. it is amazing how they fooled and tricked the market to take it so far before collapsing. STRONGLY recomended
I was in charge of IT for a smaller energy company during this time that went down in flames as well in the aftermath due to accounting 'irregularities'. The way that Arthur Andersen operated was that if you had an auditor who got too close to the flame, you would simply complain to AA about them and they would be pulled off of your account. Our investigation resulted in a few people losing their licenses & ability to work for publicly traded companies, but stopped short of going all the way down the rabbit hole to the utility companies who were complicit...smaller version of too big to fail...too big to indict. It's disturbing to see how some people will trade their souls for dollars (executive bonuses were tied to profits, CEO was remodeling a golf course mcmansion, CFO was doing an 'Envy' converting the ranch house in his neighborhood into a mcmansion...he finally cracked when Deloitte came to town to clean up and unburdened himself...ended up losing his new job when the charges were announced). Sadly, none of this is uncommon.
I remember living in Houston when Enron fell off the cliff. Actually knew a guy that left Texaco to work for Enron two years before the disaster. He was all giddy and excited to work for them. It was sad to watch him have to pick up the pieces afterwards....
Serious question, why did Arthur Andersen get penalised so heavily when other auditors get away with this? ?? Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC) is completely banned from auditing in India at the moment and a company they audited was fined $6bn by the SEC for their auditing practices but they still have a business. I could point to numerous other examples by the same company of course. So...what did Authur Andersen do that was so egregious? ??
How was it discovered.. Make a video pls
Do dawoo car
Something went En-Wrong
Whose history did this happen in again?
My street is named Enron st lol??
Can I blame them? Yes, greedy people deserve to lose everything. That's poetic justice. The stock market is a manifestation of that greed so anyone that invests there by choice deserves to lose everything invested. Should I also feel sorry for someone who gambles away their life savings at the craps table? Same thing.
Sounds like the South Sea Bubble (thank you Extra Credits)
I'd love to see a what happened with Home Depot and Lowe's!
Enron what happened? Criminal enterprise, run by scammers and criminals. Plain and simple The whole crew should have gone to jail.
Yeah, somthing went enwrong
All he had to say was they signed a deal with Block Buster in 2000 lol
SOMETHING WENT EN-WRONG
I actually watched that Enron movie because of you :) It was disgustingly scary.
I remember this going down, so many people were left completely ruined by this event, it was awful.
I was so frustrated by all the California blackouts I hated the whole idea of privatizing utilities.  My anger was the only thing that saved my tiny little 401k.
when i got my series 6 license we had to go over the prospectous this list the company goals and other bussiness they owns and stocks they own. eron named some of the bussiness after starwars characters ( since starwars is copyrighted the S.E.C. should of known somthing was wrong)
Gold Horseshoe loves Enron.
You should do a video on Stratton Oakmont
I'm not a financial analyst, but when I saw the size of that revenue jump between 1999 and 2000, all sorts of red flags went up going "That just can't be right. It just can't be."
You're obviously not a financial advisor (I am, fee-only, fiduciary-only). I would NEVER advise someone put a lot of money into a single company, no matter how good the company looks. Today we try not to let anyone hold more than 3-5%, at the high end, in any one company, such as Apple or Google or Amazon, even if the client is in love with the company. Better yet, we generally recommend broad index funds of various asset classes (different types of equities and debt/bonds), to get total diversification at very low cost. People who put their entire 401k in Enron were completely foolish. Good financial advisors don't condone gambling.
I just found out that Enron was based on Houston, I never knew that cause I'm from Houston!
“Let’s see how you did.” click
I remember when Enron was running those bizarre ads on TV. Even as a kid a knew the ad made zero sense.
So that's where "Evil Corp" comes from.
Bloody hell. remmember the sign (solar).Bridge
Knowing is half the battle.
A report I saw on this scandal addressed other shady practices going in within their business model itself, in which a mechanism first developed by a Harvard graduate was utilized that was on its face fallacious, but did work and generate great revenue, but only so long as the company maintained an A+ rating, and as soon as that rating moved even the smallest margin off from the top, the whole thing would crash. And there were those in the company who understood how this mechanism worked and how wreckless it was to use it given the great risk of it collapsing. They were able to use this mechanism because it was so new and hence no legal regulation had been developed to curtail its use. I wasn't aware of all the more blatant illegal practices that you described here. So you are correct, there is so much that was wrong with this company, it would be hard to tell it all in any single forum.
Entertaining and easy to understand? How about "Enron Scandal for Dummies"!
Evil corp logo
Something went Enwrong
I have literally never heard anyone say “twenty oh-one” for 2001 before
My dad knew a guy who cashed out about a week before the crash. I don't know how much he made
Favorite YouTube channel keep up the good work
Enron taught us that : Statistic never lies, but liar use statistic.
"We take your money Enron"
With your sports videos like the NBA VS. ABA and the short lived XFL! Could you do a video on the old World Hockey Association (WHA). Also, something else that is growing in Europe like crazy is Professional Darts! These would be interesting topics.
You need to do a full explanation of the accounting fraud in Washington and the federal government called baseline budgeting.
“Sell all shares of a small company called Google. It’s worthless. Invest heavily in Enron.”
cfo of enron is speaking at my school, should be interesting
Revenue "increased" by 150% from '99 to '00 and somehow that wasn't a red flag to investors or regulators.
My name nah owuwewe wowewo osas
Health South or the Collapse of Colonial Bank.
The Decline of Sears and Kmart.
Good job explaining this. I am a finance professional and I've also watched the Enron Movie, and I must say that what you have done here is a pretty decent summary/highlight of the main points. I also applaud you for constantly re-iterating that there is a lot more to the story, so people don't get fooled in to thinking that they are now experts on the matter thanks to just watching your 10-min video. New subscriber btw.
Enron and uranium one deal connection. Somewhere on the list of the guys who walked away with millions didn't just go away...
this video doesnt even talk about what happened he just keeps filibustering
Very basic and easy to understand. Good work
Something went Enwrong
Clinton's had connections to Enron. They were involved in some deal overseas and were in a separate plane when Ron Brown plane went down. Also, when someone loses money, someone else gains it. Stock market money doesn't just disappear into thin air. In flows into Simone else's hands.
1:00 Bill Wurtz can...
business as ususal in america
You might want to think about doing a segment on scandals. The top one that popped into mind is the Olympus 12.5 billion dollar scandal that spanned decades. The other "falls" would be worldcomm (Verizon), Yahoo?
This reminds me of Arrested Development
Hopefully those Arthur Anderson guys got theirs. Its my understanding that something that also brought them down is they tried to invest in India and because of corruption they lost everything and couldn't complete the project that they put so much into.
Twenty Oh One
Can you do a video on jcpenny
Listen to the way he says job
Omg i actually frikin love this channel
Due to new net neutrality rules this comment is unavailable. #savenetneutrality
What the accountants did was break the conservatism characteristic, which states expense recorded when probable and revenues only when certain or received (im an accounting student) which means Enron calculated what revenues they would make or what they did generate but not yet received (for example a phone bill, the revenue has been generated but not yet paid until the customer has paid at the end of the month) hence what they did was predic what they would make and record it as funds they have made
This is really interesting, can you do a video about Yamaichi Securities and Tobashi? :D
background music?
My uncle worked for Enron
I enjoyed this video so I went and watched that documentary he mentioned. I found it on Hulu and it was quite fascinating. The stuff about the California power crisis was mind blowing.
I'm just trying to find a Bronze video...

FOR FUCKS SAKE MIKE STOP SAYING "TWENTY-OH-(INSERT NUMBER)". YOU SOUND LIKE A DUMBASS.
Ken Ley faked his death
Something went en-wrong
And the favorite book of the Enron executives was?  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, which shows you what a world completely devoid of Christian values looks like... so at least we can thank Enron for a terrible glimpse into hell.
Should have invested in Bitcoin
it all went enwrong
Could you do a list of the biggest business scandels
A poor idea to invest your retirement in the same company you're relying on for the here and now, regardless of how booming it is. An ode to central planning fans (Sanders, Clinton, et al) is how Enron would put California power plants offline when demand peaked in the heat of summer because government (knowing best, ha ha) allowed power providers to charge more whenever a shortage occurred. And finally, companies cooking the books like Enron actually pay taxes on their income lie.
I have a question: who was the whistle blower? How did the CEO and the other executives know to sell in 2001?
I have a question: who was the whistle blower? How did the CEO and the other executives know to sell in 2001?
Still not as complicated as the South Seas Company.
The day enron was raided and exposed ..m auditors shredded more then a 1.2 tons of paperwork ... consist of balance sheets debts and all that things ... people were not even looking at company employees were looking for shredder to shred papers
Thanks for sharing!
if there's a hell hopefully they burn in the darkest pit of it
get rid of the awful background music wtf. feels like im in a funeral
The Enron scandal is a socialist's or a communist's W. D. :P
All of the Partners involved in Enron's audits should have been indicted under RICO, had the book thrown at them, and had all of their worldly assets taken away except for the clothes on their backs. I'm glad Blockbuster went down. The few times I went there, the clerks were nasty! They didn't seem to realize that they weren't doing me a favor by waiting on me. I was doing them a favor by walking into their store. No problem, I just went to their competitors.
EOG Resources, i.e., Enron OIl and Gas still exists to this day.
What is a Enron
After Enron went under the Houston Astros held a job fair at their ballpark for the screwed over workers. The ballpark was named Enron Field. The one bill that the company paid so they could keep the naming rights. It was like one final kick to the balls for those poor people. The Astros wound up paying Enron back to get rid of their toxic name. The ballpark today is now known as Minute Maid Park.
Can you do a video on Adelphia ( my dad worked there )
Video Suggestion: "What is Accenture?"
Funny thing is , the ENTIRE STOCKMARKET is doing the exact same thing ! Only they hide it better. The us Stockmarket is basically running off confidence and ignorance of the investors. That's why it's called the bull market. Experts keep saying it can't last for a reason, soon people are gonna wise up and see that all their stocks are just paper and promises !
More enjoyable at 1.25 speed.
3:25 looks good for me 3:31 fuck
You don't know what happened to Enron? No one ever told them a bird in your hand is worth two in the bush.
Dear company man. You should do something on the Penn Central Railway. One of the biggest collapses in US industry. That will should be an interesting video.
Darn those mircophones! (0:08)
Enron.. entertaining and easy to understand... alright i have my guy
... and Ken Lay is dead.
This was a well explained and very informative video. Great job!????
American History...
Informeded decisions?
I will tell you what happened something went enwrong.
0:34 pretty good film.. I do remember "that long ago" and they had their theoretical ideas about expanding the Internet through data traffic on the power grid, which was definitely creative but as we've seen.. not viable..
XFL would be a good one
They were earning huge profits by remaining true fair and honest. If they hadn't done any fraud it might become the world's BIGGEST giant uptill now.
Remember when Playboy did "Women of Enron"? They weren't that bad. Im pretty sure they all got spray-tanned before the shoot. Lol
So what I'm hearing is that unprecedented growth and a lack of clarity on what a company actually does are gigantic red flags going forward.
Buy options or stop loss orders. This limits your losses.
Can you maybe do a video on the decline and fall of Pan Am?
Seems like Financial advisors forgot about the rule TGTBT.
The whole USA is corrupt.
What about a video about the housing bubble?
My landlord had a butcher shop with 6 employees. It was forced out of business by enron's outrageous electricity prices and the blackouts. One blackout cost $5000 in spoiled product.
They cost Grey Davis the 2004 election
When you were acting as a Financial Advisor... ...were you being a Fiduciary?
Thank you for this video, but did you seriously just say "Twenty-O-One"? No. Two-thousand One.
More like. En Wrong... I’ll show myself out.
The moment I heard financial advisor I was like, let me see your credentials and check your history to see if its legit and anything you say is legit
do pricewaterhousecoopers
This guy is a liiiiittle bit annoying.
So magically fast growing company with almost no debt and a nebulous purpose that no one really knows? And you are telling me no one was suspicious?
I remember the power outages in California when I was a kid in school. Our state had a budget crisis from all of the debt it accrued trying to procure emergency electrical power from neighboring states' grids. It was over a year before we found out that it was because of Enron's market manipulation, and then it was too late to get compensation, because the company evaporated.
What's the music you used during the video?
How exactly is "Some shady guys took advantage of lax laws to cook their books, boosting their gains and hiding their losses/debt, and bribed the inspectors to keep it all under the rug." hard to explain or complicated?
'Enron is a company. We do what we say. Say what we do.' Promises, promises.
Company Man. Could you do a video on Lehman Brothers? Thanks
Sounds like something went enWRONG I'm sorry.
I would not call this an interesting scandal. This really hurt millions of people.
So they were like a modern South Sea Company (though maybe not that crazy)? Interesting.
Not only American history, world history in general.
Anybody in the stock market never put over 10% of your investment into one company.
tbh I kinda wanna meet the enron guy when they get out of prison
My parents had some Enron stock. Not too much though, when it busted they lost about two weeks wages. I can remember when it busted, interesting business.
Ah, Enron. That thing I hear about that I have no idea what it is . Hahah. Was born in '92.
This video is well done. I just subbed.
Imagine if it was real though. The economy would be great. I hope
My uncle lost close to 500k he died damn near broke I hope the all go to hell the bastards
I can recall when Enron went bust, a friend of my mothers was on the front page of the Houston Chronicle due to him losing everything.
If I remember there were some that sounded the alarm because no matter how good the books looked, no one was able to find out how they were making money. There was no identifiable business plan.
I really enjoy watching your videos. Looking forward to new videos.
I felt bad for the employees who not only lost their job but their retirement also...Ken Lay got off easy
Jeff Skilling is a huge POS. At least Ken Lay had the decency to die. He'll be released in 2019. If I were him, I wouldn't feel safe for the rest of his life with all the people he wronged possibly looking to get even.
It's hard to trust big business. They know the game a whole lot more than the average joe. Investing for most of us would be akin to learning poker from a card shark. Good thing I have no money to invest.
The book is waaaaaaay more detailed. Read that instead.
This video was on my home page and I instantly subscribed to your channel
Check out Enron commercials on YouTube. So cool in that era.
The book "The Smartest Guys in the Room" is terrific. It's a must read if you want to know more about Enron.
Ken Lay's "death" was awfully suspicious. We never did get to see the body.
Hi " Company Man" - I am not a business man but this is now my favorite YT channel. I just finished watching. "ENRON - The Smartest Guys in the Room", Netflex./ Still a complex issue to understand. But maybe: I think a high school accounting student could have seen this coming. Gary ??
Hey Company Man you should do a video about Orion Films
I will never forgive that company for what they did to California.
but did they earn 100 million from the deal?
That's a really nicely made thumbnail.
Thxs !!! for this video I knew about the scandal but never knew what exactly happened
The part where Enron went into business with Blockbuster for bandwidth and Internet Streaming. If Blockbuster would've went into streaming instead of staying with brick and motors, would Enrons predictions for their mark to market helped them from going under or were they in too deep over their heads?
I REALLY like how you proposed the challenge yourself to provide a Youtube video to explain what happened with Enron. That to me takes guts and passion rarely found for other investigative journalism. I saw MBNA as #3 on that magazine list and worked there for 10 years. Anyone who worked at MBNA knows why the company was ranked so highly because of the CEO's positive & Customer-focused ethics policies. The message got diluted in middle & lower management perhaps. I'd really like to see your take on MBNA. I'd be glad to collaborate in order to bring to light such an epic corporation.
Of course many of the people responsible walk away with millions with nothing, but a slap on the wrist. This wouldn't be the biggest financial scandal though. That goes the 2008 housing crash.
Do one on Bernie Mae and Freddy Mac
Ken Lay deserves what is awaiting him post judgment day and Skilling is just the same. You cost so many people so much and did not even care enough to come clean after the fact. I find pleasure knowing that you will suffer worse and for a much longer period of time for what you knowingly did and did not do.
What is funny is that this is still being done today. Microsoft released Windows 10 for FREE so that it will boost their quarterly earnings report about the number of computers running Windows.
I wonder if that Ken Lay guy really died? You know rich people will fake their death to avoid stuff then live in a foreign country under a new identity
After watching this video I believe I found your calling in life. You should become a stockbroker ??
I like your videos bud but im not feeling the ad in the middle...
Is this the South Sea Company all over again?
Please upload more Mr.
Well done in explaining the accounting details in a clear way!

Enron Enwrong Engone Dead Wrong All Gone Sad Gone You're wrong

It's pronounced two-thousand one, not twenty-o-one!
Damn you Enron!
Enron lookin like E for everyone
Enon employees were so arrogant it was unbelievable .
I want you to know that I'm becoming a huge fan of yours. Keep up the good work :)
Insanity. The whole lot responsible should have been hanged.
It STILL pisses me off - the top execs walked away with millions, and the people who spent decades working for the company lost EVERYTHING. Their jobs, their retirement, their investments, everything. And what really burns me is that I'm sure this sort of shit is STILL going on, we just don't know about it (yet). The will be another Enron at some point.
Taking accounting in high school. Have to right a paper about an accounting scandal. Got an idea
So this all started when they tried to beat Netflix to the punch.
Did Enron contribute to the crash just a few years later
"twenty o six"???
Wow! Thanks company man, I can't believe I didn't know about this.
This is my first day checking your videos..i am instantly hooked. Well written and produced. Gonna do a little binge watching now....keep up the great work!
Dude you gained 35k subscribers since last year? And there are countless stupid YouTube accounts with over 2M subscribers? Keep up the good work!
Heart attack? That dude is sippin margaritas right now
Never trust financial advisors. Always ask if they are a fiduciary. Fiduciaries are legally bound to work in your best interest while financial advisors are free to advise you in ways that benefit themselves
You should do a video on IBM
Do adelphia cable
Hey make a video on commodore please (was a computer company)
Enron hurt the local houston economy for years. Also at the time the new Astros stadium was gonna be called "Enron Field" but later Minute Maid stepped and took that spot and we have "Minute Maid Park" which IMO so much better and I love Minute Maid Orange juice.
Realy love your videos. Can you do Sears (stand alone version ). I know you spoke about them in the K-mark video
I know Andy Fastow. He played a big part in structuring the debts off the books in vehicles he called the raptors.
Looks like evil corp from mr robotto
More scandals would be awesome actually, VW emissions could be cool, and some of the other large scale security frauds would be great
The problem with external auditors is they are paid by the auditee. BIG conflict of interest
Ken ley was assassinated by G. W. Bush because of his ties to the bush administration and ken was trying to make a deal to stay out of prison. Ken was gonna rat out George so George took him out!
So much is wrong with this video. Arthur Andersen for example was brought down by a wrongful conviction not by crisis of confidence.
Seems like the South Sea Company to me.
do you think it was an accounting scandal or an abuse of the rules that let hide stuff? off balance sheet debt was permitted - go figure. mark to market accounting is dangerous, should be balance sheet only. AA routed in so many scandals but how much could AA find if senior mgmnt colludes to conduct fraud. AA was far more culpable with Worldcom - balance sheet growth but shrinking ROI sounds like capitalizing expenses - and should had been caught.
also sorry for the gaps in posting cos when i spend any sort of time on utube i keep an old version of it which isnt capatible with adverts hence iget to watch what i want uninterupted but the downside is that yr posts are restricted in size, so like everything, its really good but far from perfect . rAyZoR. And note, the lastime i mentioned this i had a flood of emails from peeps wanting to buy it off me, soz2 dissapoint but iwill never part with it and iwill just refer you to utube red instead
. . .3rd . . stood4 was also wrong, which i think is why when you try and change a persons view you can show them a mountain of evidance but does nothing, but show them where an error in judgement may lie and its like a,get out clause,they are willing to accept that leading 2a change of view without accepting they may have been wrong.But lets face it societies do evolve this premis may,lets hope become part of history.rAyZor.
. . .2nd post, a continuation . . .This result of us finally agreeing, highlights another problem in society.u c my wife and i are both not,lets say uneducated,yet we both studied the same subject matter,Enron,and came up with different opinions and instead of trying to marr these views in2 one answer we Both just blindly defended r own view.Now we both c how draconian that was,it seemed 2us at the time that ifwe both backed down over this 1subject itwud somehow show that everything we . . .
hi this my 1st vid but WOW unailed it wivyr simplistic approach.u c my wife uni both held difering views un Any argueing we had about Any subject ended up Enron based unNot the real subject matter. iheld the view that Enron were the problem,she held the view that The System was at fault allowing the birth of the problem.NOW we both agree that the Enron problem highlighted a problem with the system,both were faulty and it took a marriage of faults 2highlight an even bigger1,so we were both rite.
do one on bernie madoff
So its cooking the books, bribery and greed boom got it lol already knew that and did not need an advance class to figure that out obviously everyone was involved to cook such a scandal there is no one single person to blame duh
Why does the logo look like the e-corp logo from mr robot
You mean Evil Corp?
Evil corp
can i invest in your youtube channel?

I love how you say 20 0-1 for 2001. It's oddly satisfying.

Why you don't fund the majority of your retirement plan with the stock of 1 company.
Gangsters in white collars
I don't understand why those involved, who weren't the victims, we're able to keep the millions they made by selling the stocks at "just the right time". Shouldn't that money have been used to repay the duped? There are records of who sold what and for how much. There are records of who had what stocks and what they lost. Wondering if some judges weren't paid off just like the auditors.
I wish you mentioned the mysterious Lebanese financier Mr. M. Yass.
dude why didnt you tell everything :(
thank you
I hate to repeat myself but Karl Marx is right!
How's this for messed up. Ken Lay died of a heart attack and was "cremated" before anyone from the government saw his body. His nick name was Kenny boy. Given to him by his good friend George W Bush. A man who happens to own a huge ranch down in Paraguay. Put 2 and 2 together.
Do one on Wachovia!!
I'm curious as to how they were involved with Schwarzenegger. I didn't hear about that before.
can you do one on The Office Max to where I live they closed down OfficeMax where I live
Do the decline of trix
terrible and boring narration
Can you do Fred Durst? I find the rise and fall of him interesting.
I just found your channel by my recommendation's and I gotta say. Your videos are top noch. I'm not bluffing. Your really good at doing your research. I'm about 15 years old watching this and I love this series. I would like to recommend you do What happened to target. They haven't been in business lately and i'm wondering what's happening to them.
I took ur advice and buy the stocks and now I'm broke
a company partially caused the first successful recall of an american governor in american history. THAT is something that causes shockwaves

You should do a video on Myspace.
The other guys.
I remember the Enron blackouts in SoCal Everyone was like "err umm idk y we get da blackoutz"
How about doing a video on Eastern Airlines. My father worked there for 22 years .
I herd Ken Lay is alive & living in South America.
Do a video on the mexican bread company Bimbo and them aquiaring sara lee and more bread companies
I and my friend were unsubscribed from you, i think many others have been also.
The book Smartest Guys in the Room is what the film was based on. And it's the first place to go to understand this scandal.
You're right you cAnt say Everything that happened in this short video. If you're bored a part 2 would be good
I absolutely love the time you take to make these videos great.
By the way, I've never understood why the big four accounting firms are held in such high esteem. I'm under the impression that the big four are mostly staffed by inexperienced young adults right out of college. The firms have extremely high turnover because they work their employees half to death. I'd have much more trust in financial statements made by experienced auditors rather than a bunch of 22 year old kids.
The Decline of Myspace!
Can you do a video on Ames??
What happened with Arthur Andersen? Why did they just switched to Accenture?
You know what's funny? I never heard of Enron until today.
Yeah, I remember all of this. My dad lost pretty much his entire retirement and caused him to go into a spiral of health problems and forced retirement. My dad's company was bought out by Enron and even at the time he said that he could feel things just weren't right. They locked all of the employee's accounts so that no one could sell any stock unless they had stock options. He had half a million dollars in his retirement and was left with about $20k.
Ahhh, how the blockchain will revolutionize the world...
I vonder vere all ze pension money vent.. ah ah ah!!! Enron-tastic!
What about malls Haven't been in one for a while
Enron was a symptom of and contributor to the rot that still pervades our global economy. Companies acting in bad faith to enrich the powerful and connected to steal what little the rest of us have left. It is the end stage of capitalism given form.
great video.
They're "laser focused on per-share earnings" Sorry, bruhs. I only accept GAMMA RAY BEAM focused. That shit turned a scrawny loser into the fucking HULK.
Enron reminds me of Evil Corp from Mr Robot. I think it's the logos and stuff.

Do you have a basketball related channel?
You could definitely do a part 2 of this.
"Twenty oh one". Lol wut? No one says that
Should do some railways!
bernie madoff still puts them to shame
So basically it was a case of SCREW THE RULES, I HAVE MONEY then forgetting you don't actually have that screw the rules money. I too have experienced such realizations. The world of accounting didn't change as a result but I can't be trusted in Best Buy now.
"Nowadays, I just get my news listening to white people in elevators. You gotta be careful with that, though. I thought Enron was a brotha I went to high school wit'."
"They were making money and growing at a rate that no one had ever seen before." That's always a bad sign. Sustainable growth is never rapid. Things are always growing fastest where they are fastest on their way to ruin. The housing market soared before it collapsed. The tech market soared before it collapsed. The entire stock market soared before it collapsed. Explosive performance is always a prelude to disastrous performance.
Yo your vidoes are actually really interesting :) thanks for the entertainment!!!!!
You should have made the video longer I enjoy this story being a Texan myself. Please make a more detailed one. Touching on Cliff Baxter and his guilt and heartbreak because of the fall of Enron. He really was one of the good guys.
Enron is a great reminder of one of the cardinal rules of investing; if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.
capitalism wild
Take your cushy severence package and get out here ya filthy corporate criminals!
If you want a better understanding read the book.
The fact that anybody profited from the scam is just nuts.
Please do the decline on toys r us.
I worked in Public Accounting. The Arthur Andersen partner in charge of the Enron Audit should have all lost of his Worldly Assets and been forced to live in a cardboard box. THAT'S where the buck stops.
Is this you, BrightSunFilms?
Cant wait for the VW episode!
Enron went full retard
You should take a look at the rise and fall of Howard Johnson's brand. For a short while it was one of the biggest companies on earth and operated in several different industries. Yet not a whole lot of people even know it existed.
Keep doing these videos. They are amazing.
I would say no to investing because you didn't list any innovations to suggest why the number is increasing at that rate
I remember when we persecuted white-collar criminals and when companies grew.
Enron's blew up kaboom??
I said no to the offer because I can tell the future lol
I bet the guy who was kicking himself started to brag that he got to keep his money
Your vids are so informative keep up the great work!
Answer: Pure unadulterated GREED. The documentary that he mentions is GREAT. Although, after watching it and seeing the financial DEVASTATION caused to Enron's employees and other shareholders, all Enron upper management that knew about and PROMOTED Enron's shady "accounting" should have been put to DEATH. Those were some REAL serious assholes...
My parents were rather conservative with money in the 90s/early 2000s. My dad worked for Motorola, and even THEY pushed to invest in Enron. My parents lost a good chunk of money when Enron crashed and burned. Many, many people did; I remember how shocked everyone was
The one thing that I would say is that Sarbanes-Oxley (the changes that were discussed to accounting) has not added a lot of value to the investing public. If you look at the 2008 crisis, note that none of the companies involved (for example Lehman) were reviewed effectively to catch the problems nor was anybody prosecuted under the rules of Sarbanes-Oxley. That to me is a big hole in the changes. I would also say that the new rules did not make companies more transparent to investors. This is particularly true for the rules around Revenue Recognition - which is all about your Mark to Market Problem. This has settled out a lot since the Rules went in place, but I think it is possible to create a company that never recognizes revenue from a product - until that product is canceled. I am not saying that this is a good idea. I just wish we could be a lot clearer to the investing public on how that works and what it means.
Enron killed blockbuster.
Half this fucking video is roleplay
In American history...
Do a video on the "Lehman Brothers" bankruptcy!
Best commercials.
I wish ISIS would handle our CEO problems. Yeah that would be awesome TV!
It's funny to think that what's now Minute Maid Park in Houston was Enron Field. Because it opened up in 1999 or 2000 when Enron was huge.
GREAT VIDEOS! You deserve a lot more subscribers! :)
Notice Kenneth Lay, all buddy buddy with the Bushies...old Kenny Boy. Six months after the biggest corporate collapse in history, 9/11 conveniently redirected the public attention somewhere else. Hmmm....
Do a video on the DreamWorks scandal
This is really all the Wall Street businesses. Enron with a different name.
I'm an accountant and I got to say I understand why people where fooled. What you got to look at really is cash flow as it shows how good the company actually is good at getting money not just 'earning' it. Thats a bit dificult to do sometimes though.
I watched the documentary you mentioned months ago and it was certainly an eye-opener. The saddest part was when they were deliberately causing brown-outs in California in order to raise the price of energy -- a sick company, to be sure.
Oh, by the way, I don't work for shady companies, either.
Ouch, I knew Enron was in big trouble (during the late 90's).....but I didn't realize how MUCH trouble Enron was in. Thank god I didn't work for them (even though I was probably 12-13-ish during that time).
Great vid. Do Bernie Madoff
9:15 ENRON did not cause those power failures in California but they did exploit those incidents
But who stole the Jack Ruby?
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Since you did a video on Enron's scam, would you do one on Bernie Madoff?
Why does this video not have any ads?
crazy
"Honestly this concept is so hard to explain, a 2 hour film isn't enough to grasp the whole idea" They said they made more money than they did. Pretty easy to understand.
bronze56k made a video about enron already
Do a decline on circuit city please
Huh, so this is what Mr. Robot's Evil Corp logo is based on. Nice.
Fucking unchecked capitalism.
That was a great documentary! The governor of California (Jerry Brown) made an appearance in that documentary. I really enjoy your channel!?? "OOPS!" I meant (Gray Davis).... honest mistake, they do kinda look alike!??
Your gain is fine.
In a few years: "YouTube/Google: What Exactly Happened?"
Enron is quite dead. There is a company called EOG (Enron Oil & Gas) Resources which is what was left of Enron that does a lot of oil and gas Exploration & Production. If you do work for them, don't call them Enron.
Thanks for explaining shit to me. Im pretty dumb.
Im geeking out by this, I graduated with an Accounting Degree and am glad this was covered!
Pretty sure the Clintons had Ken Lay killed. ;)
Yes,things were going to be different but what is that over the horizon company man? Its Bernie Madof!!! Things sure were different.
Now do MCI / WorldCom. I worked there the day it was announced that Bernie Ebbers was using the place as his personal piggy bank. Stock went from like $40 to nothing almost over night. The company was giving stocks to vested employees as bonuses, and allowed employees to purchase stock as their 401k investing option There was a wife-husband duo I worked with that tossed all their money into Worldcom stock in their 401k's, and pretty much lost it all overnight. This was around 2000-2001, when the internet boom and MCI / Worldcom building out fiber made everyone think the economy would just keep taking off (when actually it was forming a massive tech bubble that popped).
Jews happen
The stupid company I worked for in the 1990s that almost went chapter 13 were audited by Arthur Anderson and had stock in Enron.
Worst part was people 401k who had their companies bought out by enron and they lost their entire retirement. No fishing its work until you die. At least one enron guy killed himself. Emphasis on "at least" or "At least..."
Blame it all on the church of scientology that was founded by Enron Hubbard. Oh wait, that was L. Ron Hubbard. No matter, they both operate on the same principles.
this reminds me of the movie "Boiler Room" with a young Vin diesl
Do Bernie Madoff
Evil Corp.
1.25x you speak so fuckin slow, are you smoking?
I had no idea about this and their logo looks like the one from Mr.Robot
I looked into Ken Lay a while ago because they had a joke about him on Supernatural.
Yeah, Ken Lay "died" all right. Heart attack then instantly cremated and immediately issued a death certificate. Not suspicious at all...
Did Kira kill Ken Lay?
Great video - Even got me to watch the documentary you mentioned, which was fascinating.
Because of Enron, Accounting is a major field of study. Numerous companies nationwide began hiring a larger number of accountants to more closely protect against fraud. If executives can go to prison for signing off on bad accounting (knowingly or unknowingly), it creates the perfect incentive for them to ask all the hard questions and find people they can trust. Where I work, our Controller, CFO, and CEO sign off on the financial statements. They notice the slightest abnormalities in an ocean of details and thoroughly investigate/interrogate the matter. It's not fun being asked the hard questions from people whose freedom, reputation, and economic prosperity is on the line to get it right. As such, I have learned some very interesting accounting things from my superiors over the past several months.
All Enron did was change their name.
They got eaten up by the tumour known as globalism. From the inside out, they were completely destroyed by fanatics and heretics to business and trade everywhere. When it all went wrong, the big dogs decided they wouldn't put their own companies through the same thing.
"Enronic" that they said they played by the rules lol...sorry
Enron started in Omaha Ne. then moved to Texas. At the time it was a major blow to Omahas economy but in the long run, we dodged a big bullet.
Hundreds of Thousands of people lost out because of the dishonesty at the top. Why should big corporations be trusted? We, the great unwashed, don't matter to those at the top, we can go into poverty, live the rest of our lives regretting we believed the man in the suit........... That is uncontrolled capitalism, that is corporations. Deregulation allows this to happen.
Do a Flux capacitor
We know what happened, a bunch of fuckwads conned the state (AND EVERYONE IN IT)
Twenty o one
My brother was a trader at Enron in the late 90s.
Who is going to be the new Enron in the coming financial collapse now gathering momentum?
Still patiently awaiting circuit city
But if Enron was bankrupt due to this scandal, what became of the company itself? Did some other organization buy the building?
What a time the year 2000, when things that always seemed to be.. actually were not as they looked. When big ideas failed and where the whole market required a re-evaluation. Ah, good times.
The track is to exit the stock before it was too late.
Good
wasn't Ken Lay allegedly in Costa Rica or somewhere like that?
And I think I remember that McKinsie Consulting had a lot to do with this
Do BORDERS
Great channel, but you really need to work on the first minute of the video
Love the new intro keep it up please
YES
Can you be my financial adviser?
I bet it was Walpole.
shEnron
As a state auditor I can say it's easy to audit Enron. Since the auditor helped make the financial statements. Lol
I have to admit you have the best dam youtube channel even better than mine.
The Jim Carrey movie "Fun With Dick and Jane" was based on the Enron scandal, it was definitely one of his better movies
mircophone
Auther Anderson accountants took a big loss--they had to change careers or start their own firms because no one wanted to hire an accountant linked the Auther Anderson. All the employees were declared dishonest by the business community.
Do one on Daewoo pls
I was an auditor at Arthur Andersen back in 2001 right before this happened. The auditors themselves where frauded by the company, but the rules were so lax back then, that they didn't really have to do too much digging. I worked in the NY office and was let go right after 9/11, along with a bunch of other people. It was really strange that people were getting laid off at the time, cause we didn't think 9/11 had that big an effect on the audit firm itself. Two weeks later, the Enron news came out, and I guess they knew it was coming. I made out on the deal cause I got 2 months severance and a new job in like a week. After Enron hit, people got at best two weeks severance. Andersen didn't actually go under all at once, and was telling some of the employees I kept in touch with in December 2001 that things were going to be fine, that it wouldn't have an effect on them. I was trying to let them know that it was a sinking ship but people still held on tight. Regardless, all the rules in the world won't matter because companies will always be able to commit fraud if they want in the current system. The penalties are way too minimal for the upside of being insanely rich.
The Federal Reserve which is not Federal but a Private Bank backed by shadowy figures, prints money and sets interest rates, all because we trust them and their mystique. Investment banks closely tied to the fed use fractional reserve banking which means they can lend money they don't have. It is in every way a House of Cards like Enron but is perpetuated by people who are too big to fail, too persecuted to ever be held accountable again. Until the end of days.
The book A Conspiracy of Fools is crazy detailed about Enron's goings-on.
Anyone who know anything about businesses wouldn't have touched those stocks. Too good to be true means not true.
Could you do whatever happened to baby Jane?
"Shocking", I guess they didn't have the Skill.....ing to pay the bills......... ? that joke...... was a waste of "Energy".............? did someone fart? I can smell "Gas". What has Enrons stock and the Titanic got in common?............. they both sank.
Fun with Dick and Jane... Thats what happened lol
"Twenty O One"
Looks like I'm going to lose an hour or two watching stuff, now I've discovered this channel.
People who say 2001-2009 as "Twenty o _____" cant be trusted.
The Enron scandal was a "one of a kind" scandal, mainly because it would be almost impossible to do the same today. First of all, no company would want to be "the second Arthur Anderson." Second of all, there are a lot stricter laws nowadays that were applied the day the scandal happened.
The E reminds me of Evil Corp from Mr Robot.
The logo looks like evil Corp from Mr Robot
Southwest, Goldsman Sachs, and Enron... Freaky...
Tesla
Ahh the good old times when financial fraudsters were imprisoned, unlike now...
I definitely should look more into this. I know you usually stick to more large-scale businesses, but I wonder if you'd ever take a look at what happened with 38 Studios? I have friends who were affected by that directly from working there, and I think it'd make for an interesting topic for one of these videos.
Arthur andersen amazingily still exists under anather name. I think the consulting side of the business is under anotehr name
I guess the internal auditors that okayrded this accounting is still working
I know this story all too well. Being a native Houstonian, this was the biggest news story in town. I was in kindergarten at the time.
Haha getting involved with Blockbuster.
Subbed for that quality. I don't know but the quality of your videos seemed to increase.
Haven't heard anyone say "twenty oh one" before lol
I've read many places that the Enron files were lost in building 7 on 9/11. Alot of important files were lost for many investigations.
What an interesting channel. Subscribed.
What wENt RON
Yet despite the constant lessons the majority of Americans can think of nothing better in life than licking the ballsack of the rich.
ur annoying
good thing i invest glododyne
Could you please explain the Bernie madoff scandal? Which was similar to the Enron scandal right?
I've never heard anyone refer to 2001 as twenty-o-one Two thousand one would be the standard way of pronouncing it, right?
I own the movie & it's intriguing. I subscribed also...
twenty O one... 2001

"Impactful?"
I love your content keep up the good work!!
you should make a video about the Pen Central Railroad disaster and how it almost took down the entire North East railroad network in about 6 years.
Nothing has been done to prevent more Enrons from happening. IMHO there are many more out there waiting to happen, especially now.
The "Smartest Guy in the Room" missed the point and failed in telling the whole truth. I worked there BEFORE Ken Lay. He flipped management in 1985 and overthrew better management and it took him fifteen years to destroy a once great company. He began massive fraud in 1986 and sold off assets to coverup failures. They Lay hired Skilling who was an expert in fraud to help him. The sin of Ken Lay was pride. He could not admit his failures.
Crazy to see all this again my aunt was the auditor who stepped foreward. Ended up doing my senior project on Enron and this scandal. Nice video brings back allot of memories.
if you want to clear cut version, enron was a smoke screen company that was being used to fund a CIA operation that the bush cronies was coordinating, it was generating fake revenue to bring in investors, then took that money to fund the whole operation to steal money from global markets, they proved that in court
Do the decline of The great Atlantic and pacific tea company
...they paid off accountants with money they didn't have?
Thanks for covering this one! I love Smartest Guys in the Room, glad you mentioned it. Basically Enron was a house of cards, a masterful bluff. But they kept buying themselves time in the short term at the detriment of their long term health, similar to a Ponzi scheme.
@ 8:24 two thousand and six
@ 4:06 Two thousand and one. =)
Do Myspace!
Never heard of it! Is it because I'm Australian? probably...
Boop boop boop boop boop booop boop boop boop boop boop booop
The thing about Enron is that they used a technique that EVERY company was doing.....they just abused it way more than they should. A company that knew they were going to gain revenue would place that on the books as leverage for their liabilities, and when it came in, it would be a wash......what Enron did was create revenue based on the wrong data. For example, an electric company would be known to make upwards of 2 million on average across America, so when Enron built an electric plant in China, they put 2 million as the revenue on the sheets.....not understanding that the outskirts of China wouldn't be able to afford the electricity at even a penny cost, which lead to a flop return. With constant flops on market decisions while the books just kept getting more and more cooked, eventually it all slipped. If Enron hadn't done what they did, companies would still be doing it today. Between Enron and the real-estate crash, it ruined stock market trading for a lot of us commoners...increased capital requirements and other restrictions kills the very notion of a free market.
Arthur Andersen was also the auditing company involved in the MCI-Worldcom scandal. That was the other main reason they ceased to operate.
Jim chanos first called enron as a scam
Right when I was thinking when this channel was going to upload another video, you appear ^_^
Look at Enrons chart... Classical Pump and Dump chart... It's crazy to think that if Blockbuster would have tried harder they could have been Twitch, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Redbox...but alas they are no more...
Do THQ
2:23 I can't see the debt and equity figures. Hmm...
I'd also recommend reading this: https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Fools-Story-Kurt-Eichenwald-ebook/dp/B000FCK1SO It was written a bit later than "Smartest Guys" and has a lot of updated information.
Nice video, I've never even heard of Enron. I think you should consider doing Yahoo's decline. I have used Yahoo since 2005 and I have seen the decline, it's decision not to buy google, I think, and it's eventual sale to verizon. Another Idea is to go over restaurant's like dennys, apple bees, sizzler, and others who have seen decline. I'm curious to see what video you make next. Keep up the hard work.
When I was studying microeconomics and financial accounting, this was a really hot topic. 0:25 I admit, the teachers were using it to explain simple accounting principles that they violated to cook the books.
What happened with Lehman Brothers?
If you're doing scandals and fraudulent corporations, you should consider doing a breakdown of the '08 Financial Crisis. I know it's more well known after "The Big Short" came out but it should be more widely spread.
The robber barons responsible should all have gotten the death penalty and lost their assets altogether. That wealth should then be redistributed to the 99%. Enron is proof that unfettered capitalism is bullshit. Democratic socialism is the future. Bernie Sanders in 2020
good videos bro
Only Americans can be this full of shit.
Never invest in a company that doesn't have a quality product, and or service. If you're buying crypto coins, Enron is a good example of what to avoid. Emotions be damned. You want money? Then follow the data, results. Years before Enron collapsed they had a reputation for being shady. They can't hide who they are.
Do Tesla, and how it collapsed after Elon left earth for Mars to escape killer AI.
SEARS SEARS SEARS
Love your vidz! It's like watching a mini documentary movie!
I have never heard exactly what Enron was supposed to be selling. Their business model was never clear; you were just expected to look at the numbers. But there was a lot of that in the 90's.
You should do the 2008 Financial Crisis.
My next door neighbor was tim belden
You are amazing at explaining things. Very interesting video! You just earned a new subscriber. :)
awesome short cut on a big subject...now I just wonder what role they had in Arnold getting elected. Oh well I will watch the movie when I have more time now.
Can you do circuit city
Duuude I remember I found you when you had just 700 subs
I really loved fun with Dick and Jane where the other guy mentions his great new job Enron.
Sprint wireless?
You really need more subs
Your voice makes me watch these videos over and over again. It's captivating.
Another great video, thanks for posting...
Please do a part two.
The big auto company bailouts would've interesting since we're coming up on 10 years post-recession.
Enron is actually a pretty cool name, like a science fiction character or something.

I can't recall his name but I remember at the time reading in the WSJ about one of the key executives who blew his brains out in his Mercedes shortly after the scandal broke because he knew there was no way he'd escape going to prison.
I've never heard of Enron then again I was born in 2001. This just seems bizarre
you will get a lot of subscribers lmao
i dont understand how annyone whit half a brain can look at the way they conduct themselves and think it's not even a little suspect the best example is the way they cut of electricity to jack up the prices tell me that's not a sure way to see a company is not on a long therm path of succes (and that was something known)
Omfg! Thank you for listening! I remember asking you for this and HERE IT IS!!!
if its to good to be true...
take the money and run (that's what happed)
Do the rising of nike
enron has one of the best commercials I've ever seen. I never was aware of enron until after they died so I found out about them on an old commercial collection. I realized I never heard of them, so I looked them up on wiki and found out about the fraud. You of course had way more about enron then wiki did and I always love learning more about enron! Maybe one day I'll get to watching the movie when I have more time on my hands.
The documentary is good but the book The Smartest Guys in the Room is the definitive account of what happened. It can be dry when talking about the chicanery that went on in the accounting but it is best when it details how the rest of the utility industry thought about Enron. There is one point after Enron Oil and Gas (based in Omaha) broke away from Enron proper, an executive from Enron sent a bouquet of flowers to the CEO of EOG. The CEO sent back a biting comment, "I know we did the right thing but you have to remember I'm from the Midwest and I think this means we're engaged." My dad was a CEO of a utility but not of EOG and he would have sent back something equivalent being a man who worked himself up from being a meter reader in the 70s. The utility industry is fascinating and my research into it has shown me why the Internet should be considered as an utility.

"if it's to good to be true, I stay away." What goes up must come down!
This channel is amazingly fascinating. I wouldn't really care about the history of companies but every time I see your videos in my sub feed I click instantly.
I wonder if he faked his death
Oh man I have always been confused by this ordeal, thanks for some insight!!
Do why GameStop is dying
What happened? Scumbag Ken Lay. Took total advantage of all of his employeees and customers and screwed over thousands of employers
Thank you! I remember this being in the news, but I never really cared enough to know what actually happened. Suggestion: Bernie Madoff.
Circuit City
you're one of the only youtubers that deserve to make 10 minute videos in order to get extra ad revenue.
State farm knows that for every one of these moments, there's one of those.
actually there is a simpler version explained watch "FUN with DICK & JANE" (jim carry movie)
Remember that one time when we prosecuted corporate criminals?
Can the company man do a video on the company man
Here in my hometown of Houston TX they even built a baseball field and named it Enron Field, God knows how they even got money to built that. After the scandal it got renamed as the Minute Maid Field.
Once again, another well put together and informative video! You never cease to amaze! Keep up the good work!
"Enron is a company."
Sorry, they WEREN'T victims....they played the game and Lost. The stock market is a RISK, period. Doesn't matter how big the company is, there is no guarantees. Yes the company was a fraud, but WELCOME to America!!! Even if the company Wasn't a Fraud, you could STILL lose money over time with them!!! It's an Investment, but Not a guarantee... Look at Any companies Filings and Disclosures....oh wait, you Can't! Because only the Top 1% Wealthy insiders have information to that with blue chip stocks!!! RED FLAG!!!
I was in Houston when Enron went under and myself and several of my friends ran down to Smith street to watch the employees being walked out.
Good job on the video. Could have used more Fastow though.
You should do a video on Death Row Records
I actually did photography work for Arthur Anderson a few years ago. It was a big reunion party! Lots of big wigs with deep pockets. It felt like they were celebrating the company's failure.
The opening line of The Smartest Guys in the Room is my favourite. “It had taken Enron 16 years to go from $10 billion in assets to $65 billion in assets. It took them 24 days to go bankrupt.”
I don't think I'll watch the DVD movie about it. My blood pressure would probably break record highs.
You need to make a video on Theranos when it goes bankrupt.
Please do PanAm
Love this channel !
The book "the smartest guys in the room" which the movie was based on goes into much greater detail. I think the audiobook version is 14 hours long.
I mean maybe it seemed like a smart choice to invest at the time but to me this smelled fishy just from how great it sounded. I would much rather buy a cheap stock that looks promising instead of $80 for something that seemed incredible. It seems foolish. But the risk is much lower like what happened here. Sometimes playing between safe and risky is the best.
You forgot to mention Ken Lay died while vacationing in a ski resort in Aspen: he never set foot in jail and effectively escaped justice.
If something appears to going unbelievably well, it probably is unbelievable.
I'm sorry, i love your channel but most of the major details you went into were wrong/not accurate. Do more research next time!
This YouTube channel is going places.
We get it. It's "complicated". Normal people, unlike yourself, can't understand it. Blah blah. Who would want to be an expert in enron? If you can't explain such a thing easily, you failed.
Do a video presentation on Worldcom. It was an even bigger scandal that took place the very next year.
this situation sounds similar to the 2009 General Motors bailout. nice vid. could come in handy!
Do the AOL Time Warner merger!
Jeff Skilling got violently booty slammed in prison so often and so hard he had to have his intestines repaired. Hope he made them use protection.
Enron also changed the MBA course curriculum. Every class had sessions in ethics.
Wait till Mueller gets done with Trump. You think Enron is evil? We're talking Russian mob here.
Enron was fucking terrible but they were not as big as a piece of shit as AIG.
I really like these videos. They are very informative and entertaining! Thank you Company Man
Evil Corp.
Pretty good vid. You could eliminate that last sentence with the third reference to "American history" it's awkward. That movie is good indeed. The bottom line seems pretty simple, just some crooked people who used scam accounting techniques to imagine profit and cover up debt in shell corporations. Their power came from their amazing abilities to hype their flavors of snake oil, you have to give them credit as the slickest of con men.
It's 2017 and I don't remember them.
heh, last video currently uploaded. i don't know if i'm glad that you don't have any more videos for me to comment on because i'm sure you're tired of receiving my streams of consciousness on your content or that i'm sad that you don't have any more amazing well researched videos. oh well. i've heard of enron before and the controversy surrounding them but i didn't know it was THIS deep and convoluted! guess it proves that if it seems too good to be true than it probably is, but how can you live by that if you are an investor looking for the most successful companies to invest in? things either seem too bad to be true or too good to be true and i don't know what would the in-betweens look like. well, until next time! oh yeah also good job selecting the most important information. peace!
I love this channel, keep up the good work!
hahaha! Enron still exists; it is now called EOG Resources!!! Just like Arthur Andersen is now called Accenture. Don't believe me? Google "EOG Resources" and "Arthur Andersen."
Ken lays heart attack was suicide pill I bet
Before you explained how Enron's numbers were fudged I totally thought it was a Ponzi scheme
Bastards
Can you pls do the decline of my space or kodak
talk about mad catz
...twenty oh-one? i have never heard anyone say 2001 like that
WorldCom? Tyco?
Well,it only goes to show that some companies are really too good to be true.
Awesome work, as always. I'm renting the movie tonight!
I love this channel so much. It's interesting as hell and entertaining low key. Also, it helps out with my economics class. Keep the videos coming.
The government should have learned their lesson from the Penn Central catastrophe. They did the same things as Enron pretty much.
Please say "two thousand and one" not "twenty O one" please??love the channel bro????
I don't even care about most of these companies, I just love the way you talk about the subject.
any1 elses ears hurt from his intro music?
Ironically skillings brother is a well respected media celebrity on wgn in Chicago
Enron and other scandals around the time led to the birth of Sarbanes Oxley and the creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). GAAP rules are definitely more strict, but now auditors are obligated to test for weaknesses in internal controls and provide an opinion in the annual reports in a paragraph supplemental to the opinion of whether the financial statements are reported fairly in accordance with GAAP.
Could you please talk about what happened to Pontiac?
That ending was perfect lmao
As an accountant , I love this video. I have studied Enron many years and you did a great job of explaining in 10 minutes
IT'S TWO THOUSAND ONE NOT TWENTY O ONE
What Happened - The bankruptcy and Decline of A&P (Atlantic Pacific Tea Company), one of America's largest grocery stores until 2015/
Nice, now do Lehmann Brothers next
You've GOT to watch that movie if you are at all interested in this scandal. It's a great movie! This short video is a very brief gloss-over of the scandal -- the movie goes into a lot more detail, simply because it has more time available to go into the details.
Damn man nice video when i was last here you were at 37k nice growth hope it isn't faked just kidding have a good day man
This is awesome, my accounting professor was literally discussing Enron in class today.
Mark to Market accounting. I'm sure it started small, but once Enron saw the stock rise, all bets were off.
Southwest Airlines #2 company to work for...
They even swindled most of their own employees by conning them into buying Enron stock with their retirement accounts. And I never quite believed that malarkey about Ken Lay supposedly dying on the day he was to be sentenced. The higher-ups at Enron were nothing but a bunch of ruthless thieves.
What's Enron?
I bet that guy that didn't invest went from kicking himself, to buying a nice lobster dinner when the stock crashed.
Playboy ran a "Women of Enron" pictorial. I thought the pilot chick was hot.
Have you considered taking a look at professional sports? Not on a team level but like the NFL, NBA, etc. and taking the financial angle and what the owners and commissioners did to make the leagues where they are today?
Wrong, that's not the primary purpose of an auditor. Source: BIG4 Potato
"Oh, what a wicked web we weave, when first we practice to deceive." And the didn't just practice, they carried it off, much to most people's detriment.
Willl you ever do a video about the boac bea merger ? Maybe too obscure ?
why more regulations went into place to protect investors and workers. it leaves a broke up trail and by the time it's revealed it's damage control from there out. remember boy's & girl's crap till this day flows downhill if you don't see it, there's a reason for that! you weren't looking for it.
Do pan am please!
Awesome video. Really informative. Good job !
Do a video on Hot 'N Now!
Actually it takes 30 seconds or so to explain they were booking profits that didn't exist.
(((They))) got all your money
You should do a video on the 2008 stock-market crash and the people responsible.
Another good one, Company Man! Enron was a case of some uber serious scumbaggery. Amidst their various egregious acts, the fact that they put the thumbscrews to their own employees is the very worst in my humble opinion. Amazing that they did this. I bet there are some folks rotting away in prison today that seriously regret what they did.
hint: if you ask "what does this company do?" and that can't be easily explained, RUN.
There's a book with the same name (The Smartest Guys in the Room) that goes into greater detail. The following are some of the highlights: 1. the exit of Rich Kinder (and the foundation of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners). 2. Transitioning the company from oil and gas delivery to a financial instruments company. 3. Close call(s) on financial solvency of the company in the 1980s. 4. Ambitious development projects overseas that eventually turned into huge losses.
Good. Saw the movie. I could skip this.... muh I'm bored go on
Back in the day there was an old proto-meme with the "Dell Dude" that said "Dude, you're going to HELL" (with the E being the Enron logo). Tried to find it again but alas it must be lost somewhere in the outerspace of interbutts.
Also, my wife's on Thalidamide and we just love New Coke.
I think the most fucked up thing was the employee retirement funds being tied to enron stock. Because at the end the executives stopped stock trading to pull their own money out of the market when shit hit the fan. Once they opened trading again it was worth only pennies. Those executives basically stole all the employees money!
I remember in high school having the stock market Davy kids tell me how good Enron was and I thought they were too over hyped for it not too be a fraud, I was right. And the movie is definitely worth a watch.
The sheep got fleeced, so what else is new
no matter how you do it, you can't make losses "disappear". somewhere in the accounting process the truth will present itself. hiding "bad numbers" is a temporary solution. ....
sounds like Micheal kelso
Wow, I finally get that joke in the Simpsons! ...... but it was past season 10, so that's not as cool, but oh well, still thanks :)
I have a suggestion for a video: the disaster that was Target Canada. There was so much hype but they did literally everything wrong
Yay! I new Video! Love the Series!
That halfway ad cost you a sub. Maybe you should make a video on greedy youtubers?
I was little when this happened, but I remember it well haha
So..."Toilet and Douche" is now just "Deloitte?" WTF did they do to Touche?
It sure was go-enron
Cease to exist hahahahaha EOG you dummy's they are still around Eron oil & gas
Man i love this channel. Really goes to show there is no such thing as boring topics just boring presentation. Its always exciting finding niche but extremely high quality content. Keep up the presentation.
If only someone could make a video on the topic of Enron
I guess they had to..... (Insert pun that I don't want to think of)
Sees a company man video,likes then watches the video
I'm still also waiting for y2k big to take effect
fsociety happened
Your videos are so interesting, I e-mail every new video of yours to my father who enjoys corporate history and we discuss it when I meet him over lunch every Sunday.
This is the kind of video people want to see, very old companies or new companies and their difficulties or failure not a fidget spinner video.
When did this happen?
Great video. Keep it up.
Always a great video, the quick rise and fall of Steve & Barry's would be another great one.
I wouldn't have invested, this shit was too good to be true. like bitcoin, that shit was true but nobody did that, so no impact.
"twenty o'one"
Sounds a lot like Penn Central, the railroad that joined the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central, except PC simply made the numbers up to look good.
Next stop, PEPCO.
Based on the info at the time Some red flags should have gone up! If something seems too good to be true, IT PROBABLY IS!
You do a great job so keep up the good work! Also, I think you should do an episode on Time Inc, the publishing company.
I believe there was an American greed episode also
This just popped up on my homepage and I exclaimed "YESSSSS!" I've always wondered what happened to Enron, but have been too lazy to simply research it. Thanks!
Enron = Evil Corp younger brother. Logo is still same ;)
Do one one Hudson Soft
I wish I could have shorted Enron...
Damn, this is terrible yet so fascinating.
Don panam airlinesOr twa
Feel free to follow this video up with a detailed, 5 hour long advanced student college course version.
This is by far you best and most interesting video. I'm a business student and I have to say that your content shows the fascinating side of what most people consider mundane business. Keep up the good work. I guarantee you that if you keep putting out content like this you will see your channel get to the size of Wendover Productions or Real Life Lore. Keep up the good work!
I was pretty young when all the Enron stuff happened. I ember it being a big news story but had no idea what was going on. Nice video. Might look into it more to get the full story.
Ken Lay clearly faked his death.
You make a seemingly boring topic very interesting
Crooks...fucking crooks...All! And worst of all, they never produced anything!
Great videos man
YAS
Mike, this channel is probably one of the most informative I've seen in a while. I can't imagine the amount of research you put in every video. Great work. Also, I was wondering if you'll do a video on CBS's 'Rural Purge' of the late 60's. It's a pretty interesting topic imo, mostly because it was the first time a TV network tried to appeal to a younger middle-class audience.
I watched the movie. It says they jacked up prices for their Cali customers during peak hours. I never knew they cooked the books as well! Scandalous for sure! Thanks for the vid!
I don't even know this company but I liked all this guys other videos so I might as well watch
Good choice of topic. I'm a big fan of "The Smartest Guys In the Room" and am glad to see you tackle the subject in a concise manner for those who aren't familiar with it.
i was so young when all of this went down and had no idea how far this rabbit hole actually went. Thank you so much for this...as it has sparked an interest to research more on the topic. great video!
I felt sorry for the thousands of people who lost their jobs because of this. A good friend worked for Arthur Anderson, software not accounting. One day a good job, great pay and benefits. Then, nothing. Even as Enron was flaming out, AA was telling it's people that they had "only lost an account", nothing to worry about. My sister was recruited by AA coming out of college. She seriously considered it, but decided she didn't want to move. In hindsight, she dodged a bullet.
My BULE class covered this
Enron: Ask Why, Asshole
I'd like to see a video on Penn Central!
I did a proyect about this case for muy fraud accounting class. I read over 150 pages minimum and that was a short overview about this case.
What was the dividend? Was there any? It's easy to show earnings if you don't pay dividends.
You do an excellent job of explaining how interlocking or overlapping issues can exacerbate a problem. Have you considered doing a video on the savings and loan collapse?
As disgusting what they did was. I can't help but be impressed how well and for how long they were able to keep up the facade.
If your subscriber count and average views per video continue growing, will you consider increasing the average length of each video? They're very interesting to watch!
George bush homeboys! Lol!
The head hancho was a sleeze ball
I think you should do a series on this and similarly complex subjects
Your videos are great all trying to find new people to watch!
This sounds like that one 4chan post where the guy's like "If a stock goes down to $0.01 per stock, why don't we just buy a shitton. It can't go any lower, and if it goes up to $0.02 per share, you doubled your earnings. What's the catch?" and someone replies "It might not ever go up, and just because you want to sell, doesn't mean anyone is going to buy it." And he responds with "Wait, people need to want to buy it? I thought you just hit sell and you were good to go?" Just a bunch of idiots pretending to be growing. Then again, who's the more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows him?
i watched a little of the documentary in economics class, made me very fasinated in the story of enron i might watch it in its entirety now. also id love to see a video about the rise and fall of cable tv. cable tv has been losing the niche channel focus lately and pay per view programs like wwe have just moved to streaming rather than TV to even cartoon network focusing more on their apps than their channel. the mtv effect is starting to affect other networks more and more.
How do you have your mic set up? I find having the mic gain low and being close to it works best.
Ken lay was killed because he knew more. Like the scum George Bush and dick the cock Cheney knew about this in advance. Fuck them.
What the fuck is Enron?
Been waiting for another video from this channel. Happy days
>still pronouncing it "twenty-oh-six" How many rage-filled comments must it take for this error to be corrected?! yes I mad
Jeff Skilling is the brother of Tom Skilling, meteorologist in Chicago (WGN-TV), was wondering where I've seen that face before...
Dat EVIL CORP logo. I see where they got their influence!
Does anyone remember the Enron guy who killed himself? That was so horrible and sad.
There are also a couple of books that I've read that tell the whole story from different viewpoints. I am a CPA. So, I clearly understand the illegal accounting that went on. The average laymen would never understand. In summary, they got away with their illegal accounting because Arthur Anderson signed off on their financial statements. The illegal accounting indicated they had plenty of cash, plenty of revenue, and very little debt but none of that was true.
I majored in accounting during college, and the subject of the Enron, WorldCom, and HealthSouth scandals--all of which occurred at around the same time--was brought up frequently. The U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley act shortly after the first two scandals. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now regulates the audit of publicly-traded companies through the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).
I was living in Houston at the time. It was very tragic and all anyone could talk about. It seemed everyone either was directly affected by the collapse or knew someone who was. There were also a lot of small energy trading companies that dealt primarily with Enron that went out of business as well due to losing their primary customer.
You should make a mini series about this scandal and corruptions that would be cool
I really want to see a video on Apple's history and possible future. I think that would be a cool concept.
1:37 My inner Southwest Airlines fanboy is engaged
Another amazing video! I heard a little bit about Enron in an accounting class I took but never knew exactly what happened before now. I can't wait to see what you post next!
You should do something about Eike Batista
do one on myspace
It'll definitely be interesting to see videos on companies that have dealt with fraud. It also makes me want to see videos pertaining the the late 2000's meltdown and the subsequent bail outs (GMC etc.) seeing as that period was also proliferated with scandals.
I always thought Enron was an electronics company, I remember when I was younger but I'm definitely checking out that documentary...
Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme... That's another one you should do a video on.
The hypothetical you provided at the beginning, I wouldn't invest because it looked like their bubble would burst. The growth was just too fast for it not to happen, much like what happened shortly before entire industries crashed.
And the moral of the story for investors is don't put all your eggs into one basket. That basket might just catch fire.
E corp
My wee-wee is 9000 inches long.
I couldn't help but laugh at the deal they signed with blockbuster even though at the time it seemed like a sure fine thing. Both companies are now, for the most part, non-existent.
Its 2006 not "20 06"!!!
Do Circuit City
The Bre-X Sttory is very similar and equally as fascinating.
Hope he gets rape in jail
a part 2 maybe??????? I simply wish not to watch the movie good sir
"it's been a while since the company man has uploaded." 20 minutes later..
Great video!!!!!! I noticed you didn't upload on your other channels. ????????????????????????????????????
Do worldcomm please
Aint no black or brown faces in this video, dat dude at 10:01 was the janitor
Mr. Skilling is my god
Approved
Always love the quality of content of this channel! Keep it up!
It's worth noting that because of the legal principle of "abducto ad initio" legally Ken Lay is innocent despite being convicted.
I like how you fail to mention the Clinton administration ties to Enron in the 90s up to 2001. I don't doubt the Bush involvement but not mentioning Clinton is a little partisan
I studied this topic extensively when I earned my associates degree in accounting. It's really crazy how they were able to manipulate their books. They were really good at faking their business. Basically their entire business model was to sell stock.
fuck those first comments goddamn your channel doesnt deserve this
We had an entire unit on Enron in a financial advisory class in which we watched the movie, watched the trial videos, and learned everything about the scandal It was probably my favorite unit in the class!
Love the substance and style of your work seen all your work fast and insightful.PEACE...
Nice video man and, thanks for the movie recomendation. i love business movies
I actually watched that documentary. I actually have a family friend who was one of the regular employees. He's still mad about what happened. He lost his entire 401k and a lot in stocks. The movie explains what happened really well.
Suggestion? How about you talk about how target flopped in Canada? Its an interesting story, and I'd like to hear your side of things.
im gonna call it this is the one
Enron, that's a name I haven't heard of in a long time
Consider your like button smashed.
If I rob a bank, I'll be given at least a 30 year sentence. If I rob investors of billions in dollars, I get less then 20 years.
You dun messed up En-Enron!!
Good god i love this show
I'm a simple man. I see a company man video, I click, I click like. Also I watch Smartest Guys in the Room yearly.
I like how he's uploading weekly now
I loved this video. I have a few friends who will need to watch this
Being fairly young and not being American, I hadn't really heard of Enron before, so it's fascinating. Makes me wonder whether other companies - Apple, Alphabet inc, Facebook and the like - do this sort of stuff, and to what extent. Cayman Islands are the one everyone knows, and it makes me curious whether there's more going on under the hood, so to speak.
Very well explained. Great channel.
Big fan of your channel keep up the good work :-)
I'm currently studying Accounting and Business Administration, and I can honestly say ENRON changed everything. The very rules accountants operated on for decades changed overnight, massive changes were made to audit procedures, and the consequences executives face for deliberate fraud have increased to levels never seen before.
Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is one of the most interesting and Insightful documentaries I have ever seen. It is definitely one of my all time favorites. You did a great job with this video Company Man, keep up the great content.
Enron led to the Sarbanes Oxley Act
Yes do PanAm
Basically if you invested 1 million dollars and then it became 10k... EDIT: I might be wrong. 2ND EDIT: I just guessed.
Something went Enwrong.
I love your channel man. You really do a great job and I thank you for that.
I remember when minute maid park use to be enron field
Is it too late to buy Enron stock?! i'm going to love this episode!
Enron had some of the most corrupt motherfuckers to ever run a company. Those guys do not deserve to be called executives. They should be called (and be remembered as) fraudsters. Those excuses for guys that ran the company are an abomination to capitalism.

Do "the rise and fall of Company Man" next ??
Keep the good work company man

“Christianity is a peaceful religion”
Error 404 gladiatorial combat not found
Seems like whenever Rome might finally find its footing, someone murders another and ruins it. Rome in a nutshell I guess
"That was a lie. I'm sorry." Lmao.
Too fast
Wow gee guys don't try to fix the empire or anything!
“Soon after which he died...of being murdered!”??????
These are so good!
You should use a different color other than light blue for your videos. It makes it hard to distinguish around the oceans/seas.
The jokes with the characters dying....quite amusing. I'm looking forward to an episode with a historical character saying 'you're drop-dead gorgeous!' and than ......well...that should be obvious. xD
The influence of the Roman Empire on Europe is very understated but a great video all the same, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
My favorite part is when I get lost by how many people there are.
So... gladiators killing one another is un-christian like. Well then, let's raise an army and start slaughterin'. Just fine.
Be gone GOTH!
The empire didn’t keep expNding, which paid for much of empire.
This is what can happen if the politicians are inept.
Um Im confused im crying over a essay I have to write
404 *date not found Ded
Is this the way history is taught in the top boarding/Prep schools like Andover, Exeter, St. Pauls, Choate, etc? While in the regular schools of the general public it is never truly broken down and explained like this? Youtube is doing what my shitty ass school never did.
This is easily the best historical site on utube . More reality/facts in 10mins than others manage in an hour . No nonsense or BS ???
"He retired and by that I mean he died"
Maybe you could talk a little faster.
I just saw your Twitter. I live in Cambridge too!

Rome was also used as a basis for many of our modern laws and legal system.Their Architecture was also influential and can still be seen to this day.I'm a carpenter who worked in the trades my whole life and I doubt any of the big projects I worked on will still be here or be admired 100 years from now let alone several thousand years from now.
Do the second sino japanese war
Clickbait 9:59 not 10:00

Nepos held out in Illyria for 5 or so years though
Finally
The first video of yours I was your second video and I don't think I can get enough of your channel it's actually one of my favourite history channels out here.
Do one about the rise of Rome, and furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed.
I love this episode!!! p.s. You guys should do an episode on the Third Century Crisis.
404: date not found. Quite the reference kkk
The RCC. Enough said.
Then everything got better. I lied. He died soon after by murder. He celebrated with death
Whats up with the decreasing views last weeks/months? Something with the infamous youtube algorithm? Or something else we don't know? Shame to see this channel, who puts alot effort to teach us history, like this.
404 gladiators not found
You didn’t really give Stilicho the justice he deserves. The man was everywhere serving and emperor who couldn’t read or write properly. Stilichos daughter married him and his death I believe was the accidental suicide of the WRE.
Rome definitely wasn't the largest city by this point. It's population was plummeting
My dicks small.
Really wish you would do more episodes on Rome.I just find their history so fascinating and interesting!
Great, im crying now.
I would like to recommend the book "How Rome Fell" by Adrian Goldsworthy. Very nice read imo
Fall of Constantinople next!
Fantastic as always.
* data not found
so two in a row about world history, does that mean British is coming again soon?
the fall of rome is so surreal. Thanks for the video.
Da pacem, Domine, in diebus nostris.
JUSTINIAN
Just bought Dharma and playing a Byzantium run. For the Glory of Rome!

ROMA INVICTA
Get ready America. If we aimlessly tear ourselves apart, making ourselves appear weak to outsiders, keep bumbling along with no long term plan, allow our infrastructure and services to continually fall into disrepair, and continue to ignore the growing wealth gap between classes then we may very well face a civil war as bad as this. I'm not sure we'll have invasions by groups of people like this, but it's conceivable.
BEGONE GOTH
LMFAO the horses ?????????? They're perfect
Some of the information here is false. Emperor Diocletian split the administration of the empire into east and west, not Theodosius. And the eastern half of the empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
"He died… of being murdered" Rome in a nuttshell
I meet a lot of people who dislike and dont know history because throughout school they had bad teachers. And although you do a lot of name dropping for a ten minute video I firmly believe that everyone who is a "noob" in history would remmeber something from the video. It is done in a professional and entertaining manner and graphics fit perfectly with style of the story telling. Hats off to you sir
Atilla: Hun-ey I’m home!! One of Atilla’s Wives: Yes? Atilla: Do you get it? One of Atilla’s Wives: What? Atilla: Hun-ey, you know course we’re Huns? One of Atilla’s Wives: I still don’t get it. Atilla: Nevermind, I’m gonna go kill some more Romans.
404 'date not found' Bloody hell ????
Fall of west rome you mean
But after 404...*Date not found. chuckles Love it. :)
Funny that we call this the fall of “Rome”
these help me so much in school thank you!! PS today is the anniversary of North Korea so i'd love to see The Korean war
The fall of Rome makes me shed a tear every time. :’(
Date not found. Love it :)
"My hands are tied" shows him holding a sign and no rope
He is risen!
We have horse!
14bc-476ad? Shouldn't it be 27bc-476ad
Hi
You die now
You're gonna sit there, with a straight face, and tell me it took 100 years for Rome to fall. No. Took 3 months.
I said it once and I'll say it again. Horses= ??
5 minute history!?
People forget how fucking long Rome lasted. A country that big and diverse has rarely lasted as long.
I highly recommend the YouTube channel "the fall of rome". It's a small chanel but it is run by a historian.
Hilarious and informative as always. Thanks.
I feel bad for the Flavius Stilicho guy now.
When someone sais that Christianity ruined the roman empire on its own...
Fuck Valentinian
Even today nations aspire to be like Rome. I wonder if our civilization will inspire future ones as much.
Hold up this is fake news, It's only 9:59 not 10:00.
7:29 Switzerland neutral as always!!
HORSES!
Horseeeeeeees!!!
Caesar Augustus looking at a ruined Rome in 476: YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! AH, DAMN YOU! GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO TARTARUS!!!
I like how you use horses now
Let’s be honest. The western roman empire fell because of immigrants who didn’t want to integrate
Moral of the story: Outsourcing soldiers is a terrible idea
The title alone brought me to tears.
Fall of Mongol Empire? With breakup of Golden Horde and Illkhanate. Red Turban Rebellion. And rise of Timur and Moghulstan.
This video is so sad
oh i love your dry wit so so much
Where’s that mongol episode?
it was pretty much a sure thing when they abandon their religious roots one of the key things that made them Romen from their they stopped gladiator games witch inspired strength that was gone after with Christianity and made them relay on barbarian cause a barbarian and Roman both can be christian and that's what made their end inevitable. cause Romen archaic religion was the foundation of the mos maiorum, "the way of the ancestors" or simply "tradition", viewed as central to Roman identity. During the transition to the Christian Empire, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus argued that Rome's continued prosperity and stability depended on preserving the mos maiorum, and the early Christian poet Prudentius dismissed the blind adherence to tradition as "the superstition of old grandpas" (superstitio veterum avorum) and inferior to the new revealed truth of Christianity.
Another great documentary. You are truly talented
My life is enriched by the sarcasm and laconic humour in these videos.
Good thing Italians are done with the whole violent imperialism thing, huh?
You meant Constantine the Great.
Im disappointed that Attilla didnt die with a horse
"Xeno would of course have other plans" Xeno: I have other plans The best
you should do an episode on Justinian
If you are worried about the age of "The World of Late Antiquity" I highly recommend Brown's latest publication on the subject: "Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West 350–550 AD" It contains some important updates, chief among those being the notion that the barbarian invasions were a scapegoat conjured by Roman writers. The barbarian proto-kingdoms did play a part in Rome's downfall of course, but more through drawing talented romans away from Imperial courts to their own and thus becoming a valid alternative to the Respublica.
+1 for the hopping horses. Can't wait for the Mongol Empire episode.
This one was bit late but a good one
You forgot to mention about the rump state of soissons up north? The piece of normandy around 476 AD
The first episode featuring horses
This is your best one yet.
A new video on a Sunday! Great!
What is your opinion about calling the part of the empire centred on Constantinople the Roman Empire after the city of Rome was captured by Odoacer? I continue to call it the Roman empire until 1453 until obviously the Turks have a say in that idea. And I have conflicting views about other potential Roman emperors too, like if Charlemagne should be called Roman (he did have control over the physical Rome eventually).
More please
Error 404: Entertainment not found.
Rome Have a Bad century !
When u gonna finish the British series
‘We gave it a go’
RIP Western Roman Empire, you will not be missed.
History's repeating itself
The iron age collapse
It wouldn't be a 10 minute history video if at least one guy runs from left to right on fire. I also love the new touch of horses running from left to right while facing forward.
Another book recommendation, "The Fall of Rome" by Adrian Goldsworthy. Basically a detailed history of the Roman Empire from the death of Marcus Aurelius to the death of Justinian I.
could you make a video specifically about the japanese war ??
I don't know why but the way you drew the huns eyes creeps me out
Sassanid empire , sassanian dynasty
I think it's worth mentioning now and then that Theodosius didn't come up with the idea of dividing the Empire. During the 4th century, the periods when the Empire was not divided were the exception (326-337 under Constantine, 353-364 under Constantius II, Julian, and Jovian, and only 392-394 under Theodosius), usually along very similar lines. The division between Arcadius and Honorius just happened to be the last one.
it's geiseric not geinseric
I saw the first version
Roma Invicta! But fun fact: No
3:05 HORSE!!!!
What happened with the British history?
I love your videos but I am confused as I thought you'd be continuing the British history series?

Great video! It is incredibly difficult to put the very complicated process of the fall of the roman empire in 10 minutes, but you did a good job! At 4:30 you mention the Romano British asked the roman empire for defence against the celtic raids. Dont you mean Germanic raids? The Saxons raided Britain the most, and it isn't sure if the Picts were celtic either. Furthermore it is interesting to think about why the Romans needed to put barbarians at their borders to defend them. 2 centuries earlier they fought stronger barbarians and were able to repel them successfully. You don't give much background to Alaric and his Goths but it is important to know the roman problems had started before this.
Wow this is a great video, keep up the awesome work!!! ??????
Salazar's Portugal please
Why re upload?
Those horses are terrifying
I like anyone who hold signs, so I can understand it. Nice videos Ten Minute History?? Second comment: When is the Mongol Empire video releasing?
I love the dry humor. It's how I talk about history too. 'Everyone died, and there was finally peace.' 'No. That was a lie.' Also... HORSES! Whew hoooooo!
Really tho Last time i was this early British monarchs considered abdication
This is what happens when you ally with people who don’t cook their meat
YAAAAY ! :D
I don’t have very many good things in my life right now but whenever I see a notification for one of your videos I know for at least a few minutes I have a reason to smile.
My favorite history channel!
My favorite part is whenever someone holds a Soon sign.
(???,)
I’m back bitches
Aw yeah, I've been waiting for this one!
Why reupload?
Whats up with the reupload
I liked the first version more
Uh ok
Hello
Hey guys, sorry for the re-upload. This one took a long time to make- glad I can finally release it... More on the Assyrians later... If you're new here then welcome to History Time! Hit the subscribe button for new videos weekly on Ancient, Roman, Early Medieval & High Medieval history. & Let me know in the comments what you'd like to see covered in the future!
All of this ! From what is arguably the oldest part of the world of mankind. This was EPIC ! Great job HISTORY TIME !??
You are really doing fantastic work. Your videos are so watchable and narrated perfectly!
I really like the narrator’s voice, specifically the tone and tempo. I am also incredibly impressed by how the material is presented. By slowly magnifying the image, I learn so much more detail than I have in more audio focused pieces. Thank you for your hard work!
iraq has the best history and your channel is the best history channel on youtube
Lots of pictures of horse archers. But I associate horse archers with IE speakers. And assyrians and sumerians and the like are semitic speakers, no? Or?
Cruelty, hubris and, short sightedness of humanity reaffirmed.
Interesting relief carving at 14:43-45 of some type of siege craft destroying walls. With what looks like a battering ram that pivets,no less! Great video!
Best history content on youtube. Thank you so much.
Why watch television, which is mostly a wasteland, when you can watch History Time?
were the neo-Assyrians descended from the Amorite Shamshi Adad? Or were they natives of Ashur? They were the ones referred to in the Bible...Senacherib and pals.
Shamshi Adad rocks! Is there one on Tiglath-Pileser III too? He was a mighty conqueror...King Pulu
Great video sir, would like to see a video on Byrhtnoth and the battle of Maldon one day.
Interestingly enough, Shamsi Adad's name means My Sun is Adad who would later be known as Hadad and The Baal.
Quality content right here
It's History Time!
22:31 lol, his son must really be disappointing.
I love the details!
You sir, are a badass.
It's amazing how they still venerated Sargon even 400 years after his reign. You would think with all the empire changes records and names would be lost but Sargons name went on
is this from the guy behind ancient architects?
nice job!!
How you doin ? Yeah Ammorite
awesome. i was hoping you'd return to the early early history eras. thank you good sir
great work
I always found it interesting how a lot of these ancient empires seem to have a “part 1” and “part 2”
And the Assyrians still live today! Amazing people and history.
Great video, thank you
awsome vid ....great work mate !!
SO MUCH CONTENT I CAN BARELY KEEP UP I LOVE THIS CHANNEL GIVE ME MORE HISTORY TO LEARN!!! IT NEVER ENDS WOOOOOOO!!!!
Damn, that's some good stuff!! Well researched and awesomely presented, good job!!
I'm from Iraq, thank you for making videos about the middle east and the orient. It seems that YT history videos are heavily focused on the west and the ancient Romans and Greeks. Glad there are content creators like you who are less Eurocentric. Anyways, If you want help with ancient Arabic texts you can hit me in the DM's :D
Pete, what happened to the video? Also, your decision to become a follower of mine on Twitter is surprising but also it's a honour for me.
Oh Great! We haven't had one on the bronze age in 6 months!
Always love these ancient history videos! They give so much more insight into those mystic era's
Assyrians>Babylonians>Sumerians
Please check out Micahistory, it would mean a lot!
So Sumer to the ancient Middle East was what Rome is to Europe.
I never even heard of this guy. i had no idea he founded Assyria
i'm glad that you are once again making videos about the Middle East and ancient history both of which aren't talked about too much
Once again interesting but you need to make these videos shorter.
Thank you for the great videos.
Love the ancient shit.
Good video, well done!
You can tell you're a writer, you're brilliant at crafting these historical narratives. Awesome stuff!
That moment when you want to watch a video ao bad that you spend you'r data on it because the wifi is so bad. Grate video!
Great video, I love the diversity of visual support (which was one of the only flaws I could find with this channel). I love the storytelling style and the obviously the story for is there any better story than history.
Yayyy!
19:17 LOL
Thanks good sir. Please cover these earlier times, 2500 - 1000 BCE if possible, in future. These very ancient times at the beginning of Civilization, despite their scant records, are very intriguing & interesting.
awesome! truly impressive :)
Best channel on YouTube. Always solid videos, with great information.
Finally Assyria pls don't let go of this subject haha
So amazing a really acient documentary.
As always, a great and unique video. thank u :)
Dang city dwellers. Thinking they’re so great with their sewer systems.
Amazing !
Love your vids! Thank you so much!
yes!!!.Another 32 min. [THIRTY TWO!!! ] of excellent example how to do videos.Its truly very impressive every time.And the length-just watched yesterday Kings and Generals last one about Rome and Hannibal and it felt unfinished-kind of like a hollywood films when U have to wait 2 years for another part.History Time-rules.All the best,I think U r the best history channel on You Tube at the moment and I subscribe them all.Keep going!
How 'bout making a video on Crimean Goths.
More ancient world stuff please. These super ancient civilisations are so often overshadowed by the classical civilisations.
Would it be Possible if you can make Videos on Southeast asia?
Agricultural gods/religions are failures. These communities were built for the gods. Moses’ god says his name is Ayah Ashur Ayah, which is the Assyrian god EA, which is ENKI (Lord of the Earth) the New Testament devil. He’s not even a Semite/Shemite! These fools worship a Sumerian god.
Great as always, I'm glad you cover the ancient bronze age, so few people do.
Truly an impressive video. I really appreciate you're effort. Please make a biographical video on Berke khan and golden horde. Many people want to know about this mongol khan and khanate and how they became islamized
Please could you make a video on the epic of Gilgamesh
just more bronze age and their architecture ,warfare etc ..
Great.

As a British person I didn't know what happened before
China: we have invented tea and we will be famous for it. British Empire: I shall be taking that. * gets famous for using tea* China: excuse me what the fu- British Empire: gets most of China’s population addicted to opium Think it is good to say that is Brits have not always been the good buts in life. But it feels so good to be bad sometimes
Love a bit of brexit
When English people think they're British, lol.
U put a German ww1 song for napoleon why
U
Seems pretty similar to GOT, 7 kingdoms, A wall to keep the Picts out, there was a land bridge, not to mention that got map looks like Ireland flipped upside down and Great Britain reversed
Mention the African slave trade but failed to mention the Barbary slave trade....convenient.
CE? wtc... you mean BC? I mean that's kind of silly.. you're still using the same point (Before Christ and Year of Our Lord ... it's STILL Jesus's suposed birth) Using CE is silly
13:08 you forgot that the Treaty of Versailles (not for WW1)was that Spain gave up Florida
The Tudors were Welsh.
AMERICA???????????????? And BRITAIN???????????????? We Are Brothers My Friend
I can see you take inspiration for oversimplified, and very well too! Also, Prussians gloria plays for Napoleon... Better than anything French....
I love the UK, and I say, you did a fine good work! I know it's the history of Great Britain(Britain is England and Wales) But I wish you would have put the Anglo Nepali war, for that led to the recruitment of the Gurkhas in the UK. Well done though!
We wish the world was different. But you'll get what you worked on one day.
Poland cracked the enigma code not Britain
End it on a high, why don't you!

9:55 Why does everyone think that Guy Fawkes led the Gunpowder Plot? He was just there because he was a gunpowder expert. Even on the first line of Wikipedia it says the leader was Robert Catesby.
Becase this is UK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so Normans fucked the hole British Isles up
You forgot to mention about Charles 1 escaping to the Ilse of White with clann MacDonald
DNA tells me I owe my gratitude to Great Britain, this I am thankful.
I LIKE UR BREXIT! Ihope u all happy on ur basted island ur ducking monkeys heheehehe and yes im GERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Doesnt even mention the 4 Dutch-English wars ( Me being Dutch and very proud of the fact that 'we' won 3 of the 4 wars. Makes me sad you didnt cover any of it (apart from william II.)
A lot of people focus on the bad bits of our empire because they 1. Are jealous 2. They look for a reason to try to get money or preference. Both of these things are working too much too.
Good video however Elizabeth was very reluctant to kill Mary only doing so after Mary proved to Elizabeth that she wanted her dead
Thanks for mentioning Canada!??? WTF.
That was Prussian glory you nit!
Interestingly they play Prussian marching music at the introduction of Napolean.
God save the queen
Very accurate! Well done. Usually people forget that Britain was the first to create concentration camps and that they exported tonnes of food from Ireland during the famine there.
Arthur is a girl,proved by the japanese
im so fuckin cool. look at me . im so pretty
OOF war of 1812 and probly some more frogten about.

Angle’s and Saxons lol
Actually, we’re at 1550 again before you bring up Scotland, wtf?!
What you meant for the first third was the history of England.
Yorkshire known for there cotton !!
Are you really trying to say that all the atrocities that England committed are okay because it’s all good now ? Wow that’s messed up and rather arrogant tbh
Why did you played Preußens Gloria when You mentioned Napoleon
I don't know if you know, but Portugal and Spain are two different countries
East India company founded by Elizabeth? I thought It was founded by the Dutch republic as the Verenigde Oost-Indisch compagnie
What the Hell is he talking about, that's Westeros.
14:30 lmao
Proud to be british also im subscribing to this great channel after one video
the most horrible Empire on the world remains to this day.
All countries have done bad things. All. Swedes norwegians killed the sames in northern and forced them to be mordern, USSR killed over 20 million of their people. China 60 million of their people. And the fact of the slavery in america. How americans and spannish treated them and britain treated others. How germany killed 6 million jews in ww2. How america nuked japan. How japan mass murdered chineses and killed millions and inslaved people in asia. The french conquest of europe. No country have done "nothing"
Woe woe woe u can’t use that song from Bazbattles ??
Thank you! brief and easy to understand! Keep up the good work my man!
Like any major power in the history of the world, Britain committed a whole lot of atrocities.
Brexit will finish the once great empire of briton as lies and reduculouse campeigns lay waste to out minds of what was true and what was false. The people wanting the uk to grow will make the uk crumble #teafortheending
The Cornish pasty is in fact from Devon! They stole it, arseholes!
Wales and Scotland are England’s last colonies, not Hong Kong.
19:28 you did not mention the role of Poles in breaking the enigma code
HK is Britain's last colony? How about Gibraltar.
(2:05) because of ancestry I found out that I am a descendant of Ida, a king of Bernicia
Free Northern Ireland!
You forgot to tell about the mass Muslim invasion of the late 2000s
As the UK economy says, “ More trade, more colonies equal... Economy increased” Oh and NOTE: This is for fun not to be mean or offensive, so don’t hate me. If you want me to take this down i will only if the comment is nice!
You missed Aethelflead lady of Mercia
you played prueßens gloria...over a montage of napoleon...in a video about the british isles....k
I'm british????????????????????????????????????????
What is an example for an english Word with Nordic Roots?
Did I get it Right Dublin was found by vikings?
You mention roanoak, it is Said that the whole colony disappeared. Can you do a Videos on that please?
So was guy Hawks a catholic martyr?
Did the Vikings really found Dublin? Do some People there have Vikings Roots now?
What is a Charta can someone explain shortly
Did the Vikings found Dublin? For real? What the hell
Enjoyed thank you
Thank you so much for your presentation.It was illuminating yet concise. Three cheers to you!
The first convicts arrived in New South Wales in 1788 not 1778
What a proud history we have.
See if you want to have fun and learn play total war games but cracking video spot on pal
More likeThe Gay-lick people
If you covered our history in 20 mins then it will only take 5 for the USA’s
You're a tory yeah?
The Isle of Man doesn't belong to England it belongs to all four nations ????
Damn I had no idea Napoleon was 1810... That's literally only 4 generations of my family ago...
Greetings from across the pond. It's absolutely amazing the effects the Brits had on globalization given the fact that they themselves were subjected to it. The influence of the British Empire continues to this day.
The greatest beverage of all time is Orangina.
While most of your video is historical accurate to some degree, I have to correct you on one fact. Australia was colonized by Governor Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet on the 26th of January 1788, not 1778. Sorry, but as an Australian, I felt the need to correct this error.
3.5 million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars. We got theft and famines in return.
The Commonwealth of Nations is cool, proud to be a part of the commonwealth!
Even though the atrocities of the British empire can't be forgiven because of their influence on the Sub Continent I know English really well and I am in the UK at the moment because of this haha
Cheers mate
Thats why the scottish number one team is called celtic
Ok but why play prussian military music for napoleon on a history video for britain?
I usef to live near were the Magna Carter was signed.
Never underestimate the power of Cornwall.
NSW was colonised in 1788, not 1778
Really good vid, being British myself I thought this was really accurate
And we protect our nation from british empire ..that's our proud history ... Love from Nepal ????
Why a Prussian march for Napoleon?
I mean, Robert the Bruce flopped sides multiple times but sure, I guess you could just call him a hero to Scotland.
16:58 Ah, home sweet home!
BC and AD > (politically correct) BCE and CE. Aside from that, very good vid.
But if u.s. didn't had civil war then British empire wouldn't even exist by 1900. ;)
I had trouble understanding everything. All I learn in school is just American stuff. America is just so selfish. "Oh America is the greatest country ever!" Yah right.
18:38 this is disturbing
I really thought trial by combat was just a game of thrones thing lol
That song at 18:30 is from ancient architects channel.
What does CE mean?
I started watching and I am hoping to see the Easter Rising and what actually happened in the Famine and how badly the Irish were treated.
Damn Britains an asshole
You skipped Owain Glyndwrs rebellion. Great video other than that though
I like how you mentioned brexit but not the scottish independance ref that threatened to break the country
"RIP Headphone users" Haha! Nice touch. 14:27
Excellent!!
UK the oldest democracy in the world
13:04 when looking at the British territory, it makes you wonder why the rest of them didn't rebel either. The taxes didn't go solely to the 13 original colonies did they?
I hope the UK will exit the EU. We do not need a racist little island within the EU. Get out and stay out
How could you not mention Robert the Bruce!?!?!?!
I’m not sure if we have recovered from 2008. At least in NI, wages haven’t increased etc
The Napoleon intro was quite a mishmash of... not all Frenchy elements! ??
It's B.C. and A.D.
"Gwineth". "Grav-eleen".
Game of thrones is based on British history. 7 Kingdoms, a giant wall, not mention the map looks like Ireland turned upside down and wales and England turned right stacked on top of each other.
England the one country to help birth many others.
Intruducing Napoleon Bonaparte with the military march "Prussias Glory" ... that's humor
Now rise for the English national anthem????????????????????????????????????
Love for our brothers in Great Britain! Coming from the USA
???? once a great nation that ruled the world ?? Now the Laughing stock of the world ?? that arselicks the world ???? ?? ??
A bunch of Europeans deciding, who owns what parts of Africa ???? bruh
So Preußens Gloria with Napoleon???
In the long run, the British are the greatest colonizers in world history. Unlike the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch, they left majority of their former colonies with the education to flourish on their own. Just look at the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong - all economic giants because they used the knowledge of business and commerce they learned from the British. In contrast, the Mexican, South American and Philippine economy is a mess because the Spanish and the Portuguese made the inhabitants too dependent on religion, while the former French and Dutch colonies were practically never educated at all.
We're the true Hebrew Israelites Not african slaves. And the fake European Jews living in Israel today, are not Hebrew Israelites. But European coverts to Judaism
The thing I learned from the British is there is no good in being good in this world. Valuable lesson. Thanks.
Soon the only native cuisine in the UK will be kebab.
The 'beaker people' are thought to have come from what is now northern Spain, according to sources I read years ago.
Where are our reparations!!!?
It also exported the rule of law, democracy and freedom.
Dont forget how much americans helped you. But i do love me some british badassery
Pretty accurate. One or two things I'd change. For instance, after Henry VIII split from the Catholic church the English mostly remained Catholic, they just weren't governed from Rome any more, Protestantism grew, but it was Henry's daughter Elizabeth I who established the Church of England in an attempt to unify the country under one (English) religion, which put the monarch, Elizabeth, at the head of the church rather than the Pope, and made some compromises on the key differences between Catholicism and Protestantism. Also its pronounced Grav-el-een, not Grave-lines, hehe.
2:21 I guess I live in Northumbria
God I love my Country??
I'm a dumb American who didn't learn a lot of this, so here I am trying to teach myself.
Your information regarding the history of Ireland, in particular, the Irish Famine is incorrect. There was no deliberate starvation of Ireland by the British government. In fact, grain, maize and other food products were imported in huge quantities by the British Government to relieve the famine in Ireland. One of the major factors in the famine being so disastrous in Ireland as oppose to the rest of Europe (the blight of the potato crop occurred all over Europe) was that mainly due to the problem of subdivision of land amongst tenant farmers in Ireland and their subsistence on the potato crop as the staple food of their diet along with buttermilk. This was mainly a problem in Leinster, Munser and Connaught where wealthy Irish landlords like Daniel O'Connell did little to help their tenants. Ulster was not affected to anywhere near the same degree because of factors such as the difference in diet and that subdivision of land was not as prevalent in Ulster. I have a masters degree in Irish history. I could go into much more detail. The idea of Ireland being starved by the British Government is a myth without any factual basis.
As someone who is half English and half Scottish, and who identifies as British, this video pretty much sums up why I hate petty nationalism. In the past, everyone invaded everyone else, lots of people died, and we're all equally descended from invaders and invaded, colonisers and colonised, oppressed and oppressors. It all happened ages ago, let's not bicker and argue about 'oo killed 'oo. Let's just move on and focus on making Britain a better place for everyone in the here and now.
Scottish independence is yet to come
Your channel can only get better from this point. It really reminds me of oversimplified and simple history.
Hmm ?? I always wondered the history of The United Kingdom ?? thanks
I want to visit scotland that place looks nice
wonderful, thank you
Really the UK is located in the British isles lol
Right thats it you've done it now. Im going to have to fire up Attilla Total War again!
I tried fish and chips when I was in London. It was ok but not great
I’m not gonna say you copied him but you at least had to be inspired by oversimplified
How am I supposed to believe u if u lie aboot how long the videos on for ?!??
Make one for france
Stop right there: The British Isles is formed by England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Eire.
17:10 What about the Steel City of Sheffield?
The US and UK are the greatest allies
You didn’t talk about the Falklands war
14:35 playing Prussian Glory on Napoleon... I’ve never been so disappointed
Am I the only one who got the joke with Prussian Glory being played over Napoleon?
Magna Carta signed 1215, not 1216.
Talks about bonaparte PLAYS PRUSSEN GLORIA
Respect ! Dieu et mon droit - Honni soit qui mal y pense - God save the queen !
The last time I visited Britain my poop became liquid because of the low quality of food. But with great football teams especially Liverpool (my favourite) and the will to fight for their country. The U.K. is a great country love it
17:35 Greatest British invention ever. Fish and Chips. lol
Easily the best history of the UK video i've ever seen. Well done!
YOU DIDNT MENTION STAFFORDSHIRE OATCAKES
Artillery only
A bunch of migrants coming together on an island from what I can understand out of this vid.. everything was imported even their language..
Under the Berlin confrence Cyprus was basically put under de facto British rule whilst it was still de jure under Ottoman rule, in the WW1 countries map you show Cyprus as Ottoman when Cyprus had been annexed. Brilliant video otherwise
21:06 which street is this?
William Wallis was a legend made to rally the Scottish, We only see traces of him in books and they seem a lot like storys
Romans are weak Scotland for life
The Isle of Man is not part of England or even the United Kingdom.
i have a small irish blood in me which means i have some celtic blood in me
Awesome video! Why’d you play a Prussian March for Napoleon though?
And in 2015 the UK shit their pants in the EU cup.
2/10 Not enough negros.
Do you work with oversimplified or is it just a coincidence because your characters look the same
I wonder what it would be like if nobody existed in the emerald and British isles except for the beaker culture
??????????????+??????????????= ????
Cool video. I am an American with a lot of English and Scottish heritage. It’s cool to learn about some family trees. I do have relatives from Australia and I did not know for a while until I took a DNA test.
Where are the reparations for the Scots, Welsh and Irish I wonder.
I hate to break it to you but that song you played for Napoleon is called PRUSSIAN (Germany) Glory
3:08 Danish vikings? There were also Norwegian vikings participating in these attacks
Oh yeah!?! Well I can do the history of the United States in 2 sentences.. We fought the British for Independence and became a country in 1776. We have been at war since 1776.
I approve the ear rape
9:51 "V"
MR TRUCULENT SAYS !!!! The UK does not include the Isle of man and the channel Islands. They have their own elected parliaments. Like Greenland and Denmark . Don't forget the UK was not the first country to leave the EU. Greenland was. It is time to take our second biggest tax cut by leaving NATO ! France wasn't in NATO from 1966 until 2009 during the Hight of the cold war. We are no longer a supper power and need to take appropriate action, like when the CCCP returned to Russia. We don't have the money for Imperialism.
If it's not British....KILL IT!!
21 minutes and 38 seconds! LIES!!!
Prussian march with French soldiers? ABSOLUTELY HARAM!
20:52 Subscribed because you mentioned parmos <3
Tea has been used in india several drcades before china,a merchent from china fascinated by tea and took the recipe to china
Anglo-Norman language? I think you mean Norman French
R u Argon of Sakad?
It's Motte and Bailey, not Moat. Cheers
Is it Britain anymore .
Left out the part where African Kingdoms sold their own people into slavery for money.
A small economic recession that we've recovered from?! Hahahaha
Mohandas Gandhi. Really?
Say what you want but I have mad respect for Britain
This channel reminds me of Oversimplified... hmm
Hong Kong isn't the last empire - I think you'll find we still own Scotland and N.Ireland
1:04 I know that song, lol. My men literally march to that specific song
14:31 dude plays preussens gloria talking about france, smh.
4:30 Why are you using Prussia Gloria which is a prussian song not a French
MAGA!
Hey thanks for the video. Looking forward to future posts.
woh woh woh woh woh woh woh. you cant talk about the tran atlantic slavery and Britain without mentioning how we also fucking abolished it. dont make us look like arseholes
I think this channel is going to grow very very fast. It's great, it makes history a lot more enjoyable to more people and that's very nice ! A lot of information easily presented with very nice graphics Love it !!!
Many countries say us Brits are all divided in being either tea sipping fancy dressing snobs or drug taking gang thugs. But just know that the same isles you countries put snarky stereotypes on were the ones that let you live how you are. Think about that next time you call a Brit a snob.
Great video. Thank you :)
The hell is a C.E?
Great video. You missed the most important invention of all time for the British colony and the world which is the Tractor. Also the bicycle was invented in Britain which is the most efficient form of transportation in the world. The industrial revolution was the greatest event in history from this little Island started by Tomas Newcome and launched towards by James Watt. Without out it we would be living a very hard life like our ansestors.
We are still in an economic recession
im british, welsh, scottish, and irish. im a proud man.
Rule Britannia Britannia rules the waves England will never ever ever ever be slavesss
Neat video, sir, but da heck was up with that random Napoleon montage using Prussia's Glory? lol :D
England can go fuck off up,the rah
omg this is so sad alexa play rule britannia
This video was greatly done.
Ireland : the one who got away
i hear world conqueror soundtrack ..!
Dude, the Spanish empire never held Portugal and never held the eastern coast of South America. That was some extremely wrong history-ing right there. I am from Brazil and I most definitely not speak Spanish, as the Spanish most definitely never held most of the Atlantic coast of South America.
Whoooo. Slow down, Portugal was not a part of Spain as your map showed
Your pronunciation of places and names is truly awful.
The Union of Scotland and England was because England had no heir and Scotland could provide one. Although the debts incurred by Scotland on trying to settle parts of North America are seen as a reason for the Union, it is actually an excuse to give the English the upper hand historically. There’s a reason why Scotland have a legal right to leave the Union (Act of Union 1707) and that’s because it was Scotland who established the United Kingdom and not England, even if the Scottish landlords of the time allowed the government to be based in Westminster (They were paid for this). It’s an important aspect to note and the reason why Scottish independence is now increasing in number.
Sunderland made better ship than Newcastle
RIP headphone users :''''D
You see Britain I see Westeros
Im an iranian and truly These 2 islands are the best...
America. The land of the rebels.
The first British man to recognise what the British government had done during our famine, leaving us with nothing even though we were a part of their empire. It was disgusting how they treated us. Not just at that point but for the 600 years beforehand and the tens of years afterwards. We’re such a small nation and Britain managed to take 1/3 of the world but notice how they could never take and keep Ireland. We’re some fierce celts aren’t we.
eye i am from Lancaster
14:34... what the hell was that... Napoleon with Prussian Glory under the images!! How can you mess up lile that?! Informative video besides that
Didnt they buy alot of slaves from African leaders...
Hmmm... Welsh cakes
I live in the place we’re the battle of Hastings it swashbuckling not in Hastings
Proud to be an Englishman
You included the IOM as part of the UK. reeeeeeeee
Recovered from 2008? Depends on who you are. The bankers who caused it certainly have. They were paid off handsomely by the tax payer. But the rest of us??? You certainly don't watch the news, do you! Also, it'd called the "Great Recession" for a reason, not because it was "small"...
God bless England. What an incredible heritage we Americans have with this rich and innovative empire.
the beaker people where black with blue eyes
14:27 that woke my sister up
The Scottish people were kicked out of Scotland after the 1746 Jacobite rising and fled to Nova Scotia which was very much a Scottish majority province even in modern times they did not fail to colonize Nova Scotia and I didn’t even know they tryed to colonize panama P.s I live in Nova Scotia and I am very much Scottish also I believe that I got the year right for the rising not 100% sure
hyped to be able to comment "was here since 13K" when you hit a million! keep it up!
God bless the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland. I love our country, may our citizens live well, and may we remain prosperous in these difficult times. ??????????????????????????????????????????????
15:57 Many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast. ?
Ireland was helped during the famine, by the ottoman empire
You borrow the art style from someone?
I am less than four minutes into this video and I am already impressed by what you have said. You actually did what the title said and have so far mentioned ALL of Britain and it's people and not JUST talked about England as most "History" channels seem to do despite their video being called "History of Britain". You have earned a subscriber, keep up the good work.
Although our country is devided on this matter I believe we will prosper and become a greater more unified nation and people
What About Norwich
Ireland plummeted from near 8 mil to around 2 mil. That's 75% not 50%
2:38 Pronunciations: Gwynedd- “Gwin-eth” Powys- “P-ow-is” Dyfed- “Dof-ed” Sorry I’m welsh and I understand how annoying it must be to pronounce, (there’s literally a place named “Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch”.)
this is game of thrones
Best part 4:30 since it, Uk and England were under French king and French domination during 300 years, check house of Plantagenet.
No spoilers alert for vikings wtf
Still not better than America's history.
Very diplomatic calling liverpool a major trading centre! haha
polan can into space
napoleon bonaparte. ..plays prussian music...
Kernow Bys Vyken

William “the bastard” of Normandy
Finally
Thank god it wasn't an American doing the dialogue ??
No mention of cromwell in Ireland?
Mup Ireland
Bohers? It boers, like 'boo'rs
Alan Turing: the man who hacked the Nazis.
English are so mean how dare you say you britian cracked the enigma code when it is was the polish who cracked it im so proud to be polish????
Thank you for the warning at 14:30
BCE = Politically correct muck.
Great vid
this is a good channel but you need to read about ti more, because you would know that England still has the British empire but its now called "british overseas territories"
Fish and chips, Mary Popkins and shit whether - gb.
Middlesbrough gets a mention! Lovely!
Why did you play Prussian Gloria on Napoleon oh wait forgot that Napoleon the 3 got rekt by Prussia and the northern German States
Long live the ANGLO-SAXON'S and THE CELTS !
this took me straight back to school, i loved learning our history people dont realize how entertaining it actually was.
Scientists say the first British person to step foot on Britain was an Iranian with blue eyes and black hair and caramel skin and there was Neanderthals where the first but that doesn’t count, they were cannibals
Please colonize India again and give us a better life.
Polish immigrants cracked the enigma code
Stop mentioning things that were missed people. This is 5000 years in a 20 minute summary. Of course not everything is covered!
Did I just hear “mahanda Ghandi” ??
.
Well. Brexit means Brexit
P L A Y A R T I L L E R Y O N L Y IN H O I 4
What about the Jacobite uprising? That was a big part in Britains history.
May my ancestors rest in peace. The Campbell's betrayed Scotland and its people by murdering my kin in their sleep.
Great video. I liked the way you focused on the good and the bad aspects from the 19th century and up. Keep up the great work.
Come on where's Henry VII?
Wow, this is a great video, but maybe just talk a little faster. It will probably help quite a bit
My ears hurt from listening to 8d audio
Britons never never never shall be slaves
Most faults of the British empire is high taxes
2:15 MERICA
Very good, but you missed out King Arthur
Irish famine in a nutshell Ireland: Hey England, our potatoes have a disease, can you help us? England: No Ireland: Please? England: Here's an Indian dish you can't afford Ireland: How can we afford it? England: We'll pay you if you build roads and work in workhouses Ireland: We're barely getting paid. We're all starving to death England: Uh whatever, we're too busy making an empire and being cooler than France Ireland: Screw this, we're moving to America
Frickin best place to live....England is meh, Scotland I don’t even know , and Wales just I don’t know either finally Ireland is OMFG yes I’ll happy live there
I enjoyed this thank ou good job.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECCLES CAKE?!
Great video, but maybe add some more music, animations or emotive voice acting/light heartedness to help make it more entertaining
All those poor potatoes
PLAYS THE PRUSSIAN ANTHEM WHILE MENTIONING FRANCE REEEEEEEEEE
12% of British troops deployed died in WW1, many loved the war as it was a chance to travel and fight for what they were proud of, still loved the video and am proud of my british heritage
Failing to mention the Famine as genocide, from plantations to starvation of the indigenous population so the land could be used as an agricultural island for exporting food to other British colonies around the world. And no mention of anyway of the rebellions over the 800 years of enslavement not to mention 1916?
England didn't hand its empire over to Hong Kong for no reason they saw china's fire power and communism how they fought off the Japanese that's when they started to leave
18:38 SCP-106
malta they ruled
Just came for the bit about the American Revolution. It's the best part of the video, innit? Coming from an Irish bloke.
Preussens Gloria while mentioning Napoleon Bonaparte my history boner just got killed
God save the Queen. Haha jk she sucks
the northern isles didn't appear on the maps but the western isles did :/
Ugh, ????
"Wait i thought you're the bastard" "Dude" "Uncool"
So sorry for the brutal Viking raids
Do one for France and Spain! This was very good.
Why do people always focus on the bad parts of the empire, yes they did do bad things but they did the same amount or possibly more good things, without Britain the world would of been much different.
India wasn't peaceful at all..... Very very violent... Millions died... !.!.!.!.!.!.!.!
There was a Palmer carbine used in 1866, bolt action rifle's were around before ww1 .. just saying....
You did...... Well done....
And glossed over the Boer war, and why in 1880 the Dutch had other colonies...I wonder if you'll mention the concentration camps, of all the Dutch fighters families....!.? Let's see....
I thought this was about Britain...?.?.? Seems more about southern England to me......
Glossed right over the Potato famine there..could have been prevented though, by simply shipping food over, but it's only the Irish right...!.? And you never even mentioned the 'Highland clearance' but as your English...!.!.! .... But moved swiftly on to the brutal destruction of India......money greed and power....
You said that slaves were brought over from Africa in 1607...? That's not true at all... The first slaves taken over to the America's were white Scots and Irish know as indentured servitude..... Slaves...... Recorded in 1621, kids as young as 6 being sold by starving patents and pressed by the government, who wrote a charter, stating all those traders embarking for the America's, clean the pubs brothel's and roads of rats and vagabonds....
B.C./A.D, when talking about a history of a Christian culture, you would think this channel would show some respect for the peoples history that it depicts. But hey I'm a dick.
You played Prußens Gloria for France, that is a Prussian march, not French.
Better off in:'( I wanna stay in the eu. Awesome video :)
just to say I am a South African and u pronounced the word Boer wrong its pronounced Bu-er the one is pronounced as a uu sound as the vowel sounds in Afrikaans are pronounced very differently compared to English
This video: History of Britain in 20 Minutes Next video: History of China in 20 Hours Video after that: History of the USA in 20 Seconds
I live in Newcastle and I am sad that we no longer make ships for the uk
lol why use a prussian song for Napoleon??
Your butchering of Welsh Names Is Painful
11:29 Me: BEER 11:31 Me: Oh...
Love your very informative video but when you introduce Napoleon you played "Prussian Glory". Um, no.
Bizarre how the crown passed from the Stuarts to the German Hanovers in the early 1700s. Must have been a very unpopular decision at the time
You mentioned Middlesbrough, you mentioned parmo's. You just gained a subscriber buddy.
Monmouth rebellion?
You mis-pronounced welsh words so hard lol. Just to notify you. F is pronounced as v and ff is pronounced as f
No mention of Owain Glyndwr?
Good analysis of complex history. You did forget Liverpool v Man U and Tottenham Arsenal in the seventies but I will forgive you... :D
Napoleonic War : Opening Königgrätzer Marsch German rulez
Playin that thrones of brittania theme I see
And wasn't William supposed to be called William the Bastard?(after be conquered England he was renamed into WIlliam the Conqueror).
Why do you mark the isle of man when you mention England. It's not the same
Glad that Middlesbrough and the boro parmo was mentioned
What's the difference between America and yoghurt ? Leave yogurt for a long time and it will have a noticeable culture
‘Small economic recession’?????!
Forgot about Owain Glyndwr's uprising
some parts of South east asia was once a British colony
Winston Churchill is responsible for the end of the British Empire. He was a filthy little sell-out and traitor. We didn't "stand strong" under him, we got involved in and encouraged a dreadful war which has been the death of us as a nation. The only Victor was the international Jew.
why is there no mention of the Jacobite rebellion
The real britain did not start with the beakers it started with the stone age men around the time of 5000bc then as you say 2500bc was when the beakers with religion and celts with metal art and tools and weapons.
"The East India Company, founded by Elizabeth the First".........are you sure? I think that's Rowlocks, old son.
"Boer" is pronounced b(who)r in afrikaans
life
There is a dispute out there over a theory that the Jutes never existed and that they were actually just a small subculture of one of the other groups
14:30 Prussian Music.... Over France...…... FUR DAS KAISER!! FUR DAS VATERLAND!!
6:53 Yaaas wit a boy
This guy sounds like Spugesdu
Also, loved this. The history is so vast and crazy! Nicely done!
So, can I make claims for reparations? I want to be just like modern day American kids!
I thought I clicked on oversimplified
We haven't begun to peak!
I like the video a lot but I'm just gonna be that guy and say you skipped over Canadian independence, I know it didn't happen like the Americans or the Irish and Indian but with Canada being a Dominion it set a new course for the empire in terms of governance that would culminate in the 1931 Staute of Westminster and later the Commonwealth.
Great video extremely informative thank you very much!
I’m Welsh and I find the way you pronounced the welsh names most amusing????????????????????????????????????????????????
Be butchered the Welsh names
I love British history!
Jesus dude jumped from like ice age to roman empire like it was nothing
i may not be British but as a former subject i would let them back in with open arms. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
Northumbria ??
The way you pronounce the Welsh kingdoms makes me want to jump off a cliff.
HOW DARE THEE PLAY PREUSSENS GLORIA WHEN N A P O L E O N IS ON SCREEN. HERESY AND BLASPHEMY I SAY
Britain has a glorious history. Too bad it wont be around much longer.
Mention the stuarts but not Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion against the English? :(
If you squint your eyes you can see Samoa
Mahandes Gandhi. Lol.
2:18 It's pronounced "murica"
Great vid mate, although you butchered the Welsh haha
Gaylic ????????
Great video but damn you butchered those welsh names!!
You missed the invasion of England by the Welsh/French, led my Owain Glyndwr.
Couple of points on early stuff - the Beaker people/culture was imported in, there were people before them and the idea that there was a huge Anglo/Jute/Saxon invasion is wrong - a big change in culture yes but not particularly of peoples, add in Richard didnt "defend" Britain, he actually hated it and just viewed it as a piggy bank for his crusades
So in other words. Was just war
really interesting seeing how much game of thrones is inspired from our history
Always a negative with British history isn’t there - other counties have done just as bad if not worse things but I bet it won’t be mentioned
Brilliant summarisation of British history, learnt a lot about my country that I didn’t know
Polish matematics broke enigma code and handed the results to britain
You forgot Bulgaria was apart of the central powers
Like if you watched this video with a good cup of tetley tea in hand
You do know half the Spanish fleet got into a fight with the ottoman navy which helped the British there was Evan a letter of thanks to the sultan from Victoria
Glyndwr's Rising is missing.
Living in Amesbury, these stones.... are the cause of the dreaded A303.... Where fun loving tourists love to take pictures whilst driving past. Also, you're mis-pronouncing "Llewellyn" It's a "Cla" sound. not "El"
No Isle of Man isn’t England. It’s its own country
Preussens Gloria with Napoleon lol. Funny when we know how Napoleon wiped the floor with the prussians
Magna Carta was signed in 1215 not 1216.
In a series of coalitions napoleon was defeated... well that’s fucking cutting long story short aye
Britain's God against all odds became Christian
Would be nice to give more credits to the dutch tho, like the 'dutch armada' and shit
**YOU MISSED OUT RHODESIA**
Rhodesia was the best colony. Don't @ me
I love watching history videos, this one was presented beautifully except for a couple pronunciations butchered, but was overall interesting. Keep it up :)
The Falklands and Gibraltar?
Super Anglo centric version of history
Great history of uk
Where's Glyndwr?
It just goes to show how shitty Americans are when they won't even help pay the government that protected them
Fun fact:the taxes for the 13 colonies were not even higher than taxes in other colonies and even in Britain they paid more than the colonies
Nice vid, like the Civ V music lol. But (and I hate to be that one guy) the English did in effect conquer France as after Agincourt (1420 i think) the Treaty of Troyes made Henry V and his heirs kings of France after the death of (I think0 Charles VI , and in effect did rule over France during this time. Sorry to be a pompous prat but I'm studying Agincourt atm for a documentary. Keep up the good work
Only the puritans in Plymouth had come to America for religious reasons, the point of the colony in Jamestown was for monetary gain
Britain, once a pagan country under Roman rule and then became pretty much the new tyrant Rome. Too bad for them that they couldn't keep their claim on America and got their asses kicked in our war of Independence and again in the War of 1812 when they started their shit up again. Just like the Roman empire Britain proved to be a bitch in the end. I just wonder when they are going to give up that outdated royalty shit and fully come into the current day and age.
1607 to 1833 = 300 years ?
mahandus Gandhi? It's Mahatma Gandhi , if you're going made a video about history maybe try learning the correct pronunciation before? Still good video ^_^
Bolt action rifles were used 60 years before the first world war
Up the Boro
I’m from Middlesbrough ??
THE PARMO. You sir, just earned a sub.
Thanks Germany for fucking up our empire!! ??. Seriously though, why are us Brits so proud of our empire? It was the bloodiest and most brutal empire in history.
Europe is annoying damn ????????
Brilliant video! You've gained a new sub!!
can you please do France next?
FREE CORNWALL!!!!
Gibraltar is still a British colony on the southern tip of Spain right?
Good video, although left Northern Ireland out at the end when talking about regional dishes. NI always forgotten about ??
It feels so good to be British! Who’s up for tea and scones?
Why didn't you include the trade between norway and the uk to hand over some british isles shetland and orkney as a wedding gift
Didn’t mention Canada or its involvement as a dominion of Britain throughout history particularly its defence against the us the invention of the codes used in ww1 by most commonwealth forces (cree “code”) or the exploits during ww1 to turn the tide of war in important battles (vimy ridge/Ypres)
You sound like Sargon
You miss pronounced mote it's mot not how it's spelt. And it's not the ditch around the castle it's actually the hill the castle is on and the Bailey is the town below.
Wait. Did was American just named after MERICA?
When u said Britain in global dominance I laughed out loud. I’m American
Prussian music you absolute mug
Why u play preußens gloria over Napoleon?
You're very anti British imperialism aren't you
I still shit myself when i hear the name napoleon
Every single one of these vids talks about the fierce viking danes. What about the other vikings in norway and sweden who actually started it all
Kernow Bys Vyken, Onen Hag Oll!!
Who else read merica as merica?
Mon the picts, get it ryt up em roman wankers.
Make History of Ireland ????
Just a quick question, why did you use the preussens gloria?
Well put together video. But like countless ones before it, it tries and fails to recognize the extent of colonial destruction. Ends on the same note of globalization as an effect of colonialism. While this might hold truth for the americas, the rest of the world did not benefit for colonialism one bit. Also Churchhill caused as much death and destruction as Hitler. One of the villains of the modern world.
You pronounced Alba wrong
And then in the future there will be a civil war about multiculturalism.
Really enjoyed this mate. Thank you
The dutch mostly did much of the slave trade but yes the British did create the market for it
I mean, you somewhat glanced over the Roman genocide of Britain. They kind of decimated their culture.
Well actually John put up the taxes to pay for Richards expensive wars
Inspired by oversimplified?
i' ve got seven kingdoms to rule! fear and blood keeps them in line!
Once again people try pronounce Welsh names,but fail miserably. You may as well use Google translate to say it.
You missed out the Jacobite revolution
This channels gonna blow ????
Subbed
nice one
Brilliant video. Not heard of the pound currency before, locally it's called sterling haha.
You played Prussia glory for the nepoleon part
Beginning is wrong the settlers where already there didn't sail from Europe to britian
Please don't depict Portugal as being Spain. Despite the Iberian Union at some point in time, Spain never really had a grip on Portugal.
6:35 "They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"
Thank goodness they’re out of the EU
Bit of a morbid note to end on
Why does Napoleon use Prussian Glory as a soundtrack?
My reaction to Britain’s whole history is the exact same as what you think when you first meet a Brit. “oh”
Nothing about the terrorist invasion ?
Where the sun will never set
Fucking balamory intro
It’s always been England trying to fuck with Scotland, arseholes
You also forget the rebellion they had tp stop in 1916
You forgot the 1798 rebellion by the irish
Oh God, I don't even know where to start on your Welsh pronunciations.
Hearing Prussia's glory during the Napoleon scene gave me cancer.
The only way to keep a united kingdom apart, is to make it one. We should be one country, and a united people. Not this old fashioned Napoleonic era patriotism for countries inside countries, layered upon many more layers.
Oh god don't mention brexit, was a stupid fucking idea that was decided for us by all the old people who've now fucked our future, but they don't care because they're gonna die soon ?????
'When the romans left....' Um. Why did they leave?
you say powys like POw is now poowys im welsh btw
pronounced the welsh kingdoms wrong, but nice try
Your gonna blow up
Eat a fucking carrot u Irish fuck. I jkjk
4:47 I love how the technology is still inferior to the Romans.
Ahh jah didn't put in the raid on the medway oh wel
I’m off to make a cup of tea
History of Britain in 4 lines They hate the Spanish and the Irish They praise pirates as national heroes and sack half of the world They smuggle drugs into China after sodomizing them with their army They think they deserve any kind of national pride when they have no sense of honor
'History of Britain' - Concentrates FULLY on ENGLISH Monarchs and ENGLISH History. Worst of it is, there will be people watching this taking it as read. Do some research people, the history of Britain is a hell of a lot more than England.
Yes britian did some bad things but so did every other nation
So basically Celtic people’s then the Romans came in and controlled them. After the Romans left the Anglo-saxons came in. And a few centuries of Germanic peoples. Lots of kings, wars, and an empire, WW1,WW2, the Cold War. And here we are present day talking about Britain.
very interesting i enjoyed this video
You left out parts
MAY THE SUN NEVER SET ON THE BRITISH EMPIRE, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ??????????????????
Lol whenever someone says I’m British, I’m like “Nah, IM FUCKIN SCOTTISH M8”
No mention of Culloden (last battle fought on British home soil) or the Falklands?
WHY IS NORTHERN IRELAND BARELY MENTIONED LIKE THE TROUBLES IS SO INTERESTING
It is not Mahandas Gandhi it was mahatma Gandhi but Idc Indians are bitches
It's like Game of thrones ??
how can you cover British history and not mention the battle of Trafalgar
Whats this prussian parade music?? 14:29
You pronounced Gwynedd horribly
Rule Britannia!
i hate to be picky but the music played for napoleon is a march called "Prussia Gloria" who were one of the many Germanic states who sided with Great Britain and who turned the tide of victory at The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 :p
That song you played for Napoleon os actually german.
stupid that we're a tiny island but massively divided. next we'll have cornwall pushing for independence lol.
Napoleon, great Prussian leader
Should’ve put more in WW1 where Bulgaria was part of the central powers and Greece and Romania were part of the Entente.
You sound suspiciously like 40k theories
Thx for mention abit bout Ireland, its appreciated

"History started at 1776. Everything before that was a mistake." -Ron Swanson
You forgot about the Jacobite rebellion.
Fucking CE. Why
*Shows the french, plays Prussian Glory
Napoleon boneparte... Then Prussian Gloria ?? ?? ??
So proud to be British ????
10:08 West Virginia was part of Virginia then
19:49 Is that countryball porn?
I wish nothing more than to go back in time to 1066 with a mini-gun and plenty of ammo so I can rid England of the Norman filth WERIAN SE ANGLECYNN
I know the US is relatively new compared to England and it’s history but I think it would be interesting for a video , especially if you spend time talking about forgotten wars it participated in
I love how when you talked about Napoleon, you used the Prussian anthem as your music. I don’t see any relationship between Prussia and France, except the Franco-Prussian war. It is funny and I love this video a lot. It is really useful for English knowledge. Just hearing it made me laugh
Mary queen of Scots was executed in England after many years in prison.she was writing to a man plotting to kill Liz and a point Mary as queen of England as Mary was realisticly the next in line due to Liz having no heirs, Mary's letters were intercepted and she was charged for treason and killed. There wasn't much religion behind her death apart from if she did become queen she would turn England back to Catholicism. But the had nothing to do with her reason for being killed.
Napoleon Bonapart.... plays Prussens Gloria.... love the vid but please...
19:51 don't know the comic but India was having fun with Bangladesh
Great video, very nice! My only grumble is that the Picts were pre-Celts, not a Celtic people or culture.
The UN will be the death of all nation's who stand with it
Why use BCE & CE over BC & AD?
You forgot how slavery started by britian giving africa muskets in exchange for their prisoners of war (which were other africans)
0:35 So that's why you need to research "Calendar" in order to build the Stonehenge in Civ 5... Edit: I got a heart! :)
Intermission about Napoleon: "Preussens Gloria" ("Prussian glory") plays. Makes total sense. Umm, how about you play the Marseillaise, you german spy.
bitch pls this is fucking click bait, it says specificly in the title "in 20 Minutes" but then you look on the video time and it's FUCKING 21:38 LONG! DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY!
English were slaves to the Chinese
Long live the queen!
I'm from Glasgow in Scotland and we went through a period where a lot of the old sandstone buildings were knocked down (not all of them were, the people trying to redevelop our city got their act together), and I went to Edinburgh for a job interview a couple of weeks ago and realised that we are the only city that done this but they also managed to sort of blend the old and the new together and it looks fantastic, where as in Glasgow you get beautiful sandstone buildings that used to be tenements that are now just rows of flats with normal bricks covering up the holes they made in the large restoration of the city that wound up failing and with the creation of several new towns including Drumchapel in Clydebank and Cumbernauld in the middle of fricken nowhere.
Britain still has one colony THE MIGHTY FALCONS ISLAND
How dare you use Preussens Gloria for a slimely snail like napoleon
Great video!
14:31 that's prussian national anthem
Prussian music, Napoleon on screen. HERESY!
Stonehenge, Paris's greatest natural landmark.
Make the history of Romania ???? please
Thank you for the great video!
This is very educational. I hate history classes but if this is what they teach I would love to learn! :)
The Best Video ever by VC3 Productions !! ;-)
u forgot the anglo dutch wars...
Great and long video! super nicely summarized! And be thankfull to the portuguese for your beloved tea!
We not going to mention the Commonwealth realm?
You used the Prussian March for France...
Why is Prussian anthem played when Napoleon is on screen
????????
This hasn't been done yet! Good on you!
I loved this video. As a British person myself, I am surprised how much of this I didn't know.
I'd link to the video, but I'll just transcribe what I wanna get across. Britain: "This civilization was founded on fuck ups, and you know what? That makes me proud! We are more belligerent, more stubborn, and more idiotic than you could ever imagine! Just leave us to our own devices you intergalactic assholes! We wanna be free. We wanna be free to do what we wanna do! We want to get loaded, and we wanna have a good time! And that's what we where gonna do! [God Save The Queen Plays, Chorus Swells]"
Great vid man keep up the good work
Amazing!
I will happily watch 4 ads to make sure this vid doesn’t go unrewarded
Ty
RULE BRITANNIA! BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES!! lol jk We've missed out some events and people like the opium wars, Anglo dutch wars, Maori, etc just for the sake of time. And edit it was 1788 that the convicts arrived in Australia ???? Hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching!!!
This is mainly the history of England
I predict bright future for this channel.
Nice but French ear rape in Napoleon is weask what is that bitch ass
Second!
I'm first
We got more Serial Killer videos coming! Which one should we do next?
Scammer gets scammed
Do I know a serial-Killer more gruesome then holmes? Yes, I call Mengele, der Todesengel! (Angel of Death)
3:39 IS THAT MUTHERFUCKING LOSS??
Holmes would sale some of the bodies of his victims to science in a scam as well, a lot of people forget about this
Do Richard ramirez next
Im the only one from supernatural-
It's an ironic name for a serial killer
My grandma met this guy... her friend was killed by him
Fun fact he inspired the saw movies
We don't really know who's Jack the ripper, so we can't possibly know who is descendants are
What's a chiminy ??? Oh, a chimney !!! Got it.
James Patrick March
Am I the only one who thought of the hotel Cortez
According to The Devil In the White City by Erik Larson the third child was stuffed into an oven pipe at a house they stayed at while he was on the run from the police. If I remember correctly that is.
H.H Holms means HHH means Triple H
H H holms is not jack the ripper
Hey i was born on May 16th
S-Sherlock Holmes had enough
I'm a killer I chop them up and sell it
Leonardo Dicaprio is going to play him in a movie
Why did I read "Homeless"? Lmao.
I thought it said Sherlock Homes for seeing homes
What's the instrumental song?
Its pretty ironic that his name is Holmes.
Yes you forgot to mention that he was fucking handsome lol
I know there is a lot of debate over who is the worst of the worst serial killers in history, but no matter what I hear, I can't get past Albert Fish. Everything about him is horrifying to a profound degree. Especially as a parent.
Isn't Holmes a investigator?
'' chimmeny's ''
I'm pretty sure Ed gein is the most horrific
0:56 In the top right hand corner theres a picture of a guy, am I the only one who thinks he looks like bread
Was H.H. Holmes the brother of Sherlock Holmes? ??
But I live in New Hampshire
I love the serial killer videos, but they scare me a lot
That Albert fish guy is a real jerk
Could have done better with the video. ".....his home being a massive torture chamber.Some skeptics though, have said that this has been greatly exaggerated". They know his house was such because the police investigated his house and found all the bodies/remains, devices and investigated the house. There should be no room for argument here. I'm skeptical of these so called "skeptics" who are doubting this ever happened. There's some misinformation in the video as well. The chutes were used to send bodies down to the basement so he could do whatever he wanted with them, etc...
You should do a video on the toy box killer
He wasn’t actually the FIRST documented serial killer... the Harpe brothers were (I hope I’m spelling that correctly)
I wonder what his desendent Jeff mudget think about his ancestor
Bj
Do a video on Gary Ridgeway
H.H Holmes = the original Triple H XD
timeless season 1 episode 11 covers this
He also owned a small concrete business now from his castle. They did some research and found that he most likely chipped the body’s up and put them into concrete. He would then throw them into the river. A team in Chicago took a underwater rov and scared the bottom of the right and say dozens oh concrete blocks. Right near where the hotel should have been. He also had a early cremation oven in the basement. But then later turned to selling his victims skeletons to hospital for a educational scam
Thanks, I just got a visit from the local FBI for watching all your videos on serial killers.
Why are women soo gullible, naive and stupid?
Wait Isnt that Herlock Shomes and he was a detective (sorry for da English
The animation is so cute lol
I got scared really easily, thanks god you made these videos animated
Plot twist: This is Sherlock Holmes brother and he knew what was he doing but he never wanted to arrest him cause he had pity PS: this is just a joke so ummmm... have a nice day
Supernatural brought me here.
chimineys
TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS
"you eat a couple of people and a good agent spins it as a 'life choice' "
Is this what ahs hotel is based on?
Toybox Killers
Lmao my uncle is Richard Ramirez’s doppelgänger and whenever he goes out in public people always say something. One time a police officer had went up to him and told him “WOW I had to come up to you, to really see if you were really him” he then told my uncle that he was one of the officers who had captured the real serial killer and had to interview him.The officer was literally in the same room as the killer
May I please have the name of the backround Music?
Can you do a video on Gary Ridgway aka "The Green River Killer". They say he is the most profilic American Serial Killer with 49 confirmed kills.
So the guy that came forward claim to be HH Holmes ancestor? Or Adam Werth? Werth is assumed to be Jack the Ripper by many.
Dude, I guess I'm a psychopath confirmed. When I found your serial killer series, I can't stop watching and am enjoying them. Wtf is with me dude?
h h Holmes sounds like jigsaw
What's Chimeny
H.H Homeless H.H House H.H Hell
Always the mefia, who is overreacting too much to get a big story...
Do ivan milat
Are there no reliable floorplans and police reports on what was found in place?
Do Albert Fish
Who whould eag kids what was the world back. Then
The third brother... Sherlockians know what I'm talking about.
I really enjoyed the Supernatural episode with HH Holmes, especially since that's the first time I heard of him
Oh my goodness in love with your channel! ?? keep up these documentaries love em !??
I am related to h.h. holmes
is it bad to binge watch these serial killer videos? lol
You glossed over it here, but what he did to the Pitezel family was horrific. After murdering her husband, he convinced the wife to let him take three of her children. Then he led her on a wild goose chase around the country, assuring her her husband was hiding in London. He locked her two daughters in a trunk and fed a gas through a hole, killing them. Later, he poisoned her son, chopped him up and burned him. He put the mother through hell, leading her around, giving her false hope, and murdering her children as he went. I don’t think you can pinpoint a “worst serial killer” and H.H. Holmes’s hotel may have been exaggerated, but the horror of what he put the Pitezel family through is usually thrown away as a footnote, but it was much more than that.
It's odd, because I've watched a few different HH Holmes docs on Youtube and none of them mention that he also got money by murdering people and selling their skeletons to Medical schools. I believe he also kidnapped the children and traveled with them for some time before killing them. these were mentioned in a full length documentary that was on Netflix which I suggest, it was quite good.
yo albert fisher is from my town
Psychopath
Reminds me of the Winchester house
Is there ANY solid information in this video?
These videos got me not trusting people
Wanna see my torture room?
Jeffrey Dahmer
American Horror Story: Hotel :3
Not gonna lie, but I'm here because of Culverton Smith.
chimeneys? CHIM EN EEES? ITS CHIM-NEES
Welp we got the same bday
That beginning animation tho... Thats even worse than being killef by Childish Gambino... Lookin like he saw dat fine foxy booty and still cant get straight.... Freakin YARR
Waiting for someone making an awesome horror movie of it from someone like James Wan. American horror story season 5 is a bit like it.
he stuffed a child up a chimney and put two girls/sisters in a trunk to die
He is triple h....its time to play the game ??
4:25 CHIMINEYS??? ??
Sherlock Holmes in an alternate universe
Is this Sherlock Holmes?
usa... a collection of rare and defective forms of DNA that collected itself together in the 18th and 19th and 20th centuries in a brave effort to save the normal humans from being exposed to the problems it might cause among the normal humans.
pesteados tem q matar mesmo pra livrar
PeePee PooPoo Man
Honestly. I'd be so susceptible to a serial killer. I'm an extremely trusting and empathic person, so if someone asked if I wanted something with an anesthetic inside I'd likely trust them and die
Sherlock homes needs to get on this case!
More evil? Joseph Mandela
Sherlock Holmes
HHH and for some reason i felt the need to see if H was the 6th letter of the alphabet lol alright goodnight.
He bad air tight rooms that he could pump carbon monoxide into and then he would prepare the body to sell as a skeleton to the medical community for a good deal of money or use the body in some sort of insurance fraud. I have done a good bit of research on the man and it is clear that he was a narcissistic- sociopath who had the charm and the wits to lure very many people to their death. I believe that that he cared nothing for human life and although a sadist, no doubt about it, many times money may have be the greatest force that drove him to kill as he did.
Albert fish??
If he wants to cause people pain and suffering, he should become a dentist.
Pretty sure he had vats of acid in the basement which would explain why most of the victims were never found
Bgm?
actually, america's first serial killer was Columbus.
He died from hanging
H.H Holmes ? H.H.H Triple H
i first read H. H. Homeless
Is he saw
This may sound crazy to you , But I may be related to Jack the Ripper You see my great great (I don't really know how many greats) grandfather was Queen Victoria's main Doctorate , his surname was Jee which is my mother's surname , I took my dad's surname before they broke up . Anyway , her doctorate was highly suspected of being Jack the Ripper , if not the most suspected . But because of his position in the royal household he couldn't not be searched .
He is the inspiration for American Horror Story: The Hotel
Most of H. H. Holmes kills are mythologized. Deep Fat Fried did an episode on serial killers and discuss a good portion of their history.
Who burnt down the murder castle
Triple H
“Chiminies”
I think you're slowly turning into Captain Spaulding
still think I'm related to this guy
Richard Ramirez looks like Michael jackson
Me when I heard C H I M I N E Y S Me: (This is going to be annoying) ????????????????????
The Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway. The man who murdered so many women that he's forgotten his body count! He was charged with 71, that's all he could remember. :/
“What makes a serial the worst of their kind?” Umm.. maybe that they’re a killer???
Not only him knows how the house works, but the people he hired to build this too
If he was on dota of league of legends, he would be legendary having killed many heroes.
Damn how long has Sherlock Holmes been a murderer
Do John Wayne Gacy?
We need Sherlock Holmes on this one!
Fun fact the iron maiden never existed
I read "The Devil in the White City" Holmes did have a gas chamber in his house that he used to kill some of the girls he seduced. He built his hotel using laborers who came to work on the world fair in Chicago but couldn't find work because everyone had the same idea at the time, he would promise to pay them but never did. Some died building his castle. His hotel took up a whole corner of the block, and a segment was a pharmacy that he owned.
Can you make a video about albert fisher?
Who also came here because he was watching or remembering the 2nd season Supernatural episode ''No exit''? Lol I found a lot of interesting things about hh holmes from that episode
90% of the comments: "haha he has the same last name as Sherlock" 5% : "chim in eys" 5% : random
Do Charles mansion
I legit feel like I have a problem, I am so interested in murderers and watch videos about them a lot. But I can't handle seeing blood at times and sometimes I'm okay with it. I dont fucking know ??
nice animations
This guy really sounds like he just lost a 1v1 in FortNite
Subscribe me i will subscribe you back.
When I was little I was in bed and I heard a documentary of this hotel I’ve had nightmares ever since
Are we ignoring the fact that he is Triple H?
Sounds like the inspiration for hello neighbor
It always annoys me with these stories that they never know for sure. Did he kill 29 people? Or 200? Big difference, fella’s.
I thought it was h.h homeless??????
I am a CEREAL killer
One thing is for sure that serial killers just love killing women ??
please make a video about Philips pudkin the founder of blue whel game..............?+!:'&$&$%&&%&%&
John Wayne gacy
Our country never had a serial killer
This is what makes me firmly believe in judgement day there has to be justice for everybody in this world you find killers like this one get away with numerouse murders and some one has to asses them and it's GOD belive it or not i rest my case.
I call that hello neighbor.
H.h. holmes? More like h.h. homles
Uh oh no I live in new hampshire
SHERLOCK!
Name of the song, please?
The toolbox killers definetly top this H.H. in my charts..
hej
He's a god damn genius
You filthy humans are sweaty, dirty, filthy and smelly.. meow
sherlock holmes' evil cousin XD
The original Triple H.
Do a video on Peter Kürten aka the vampire of Düsseldorf
I heard that he sold the bone structures of his victims to teachers, scientists and universities.
In the murder of Susan Smith, Pearl, and a few others, he sold their skeletons to medical schools after a friend articulated them.
Do a video on Peter Tobin. Scottish Serial Killer
It’s a chimney not a chimerny
Do doctor death
This guy did many trap eliminations and I’m struggling with one ??
I thought he was a detective?
was the hotel cortez in ahs based on his hotel? there’s body shutes, rooms with no doors, doors with no rooms, and torture chambers in both.
sherlock H. H. Holmes
Hang-Geeng room.
Jigsaw, indeed.
My last name is Holmes lol
Maybe H. H Holmes and Jack The Reaper are buddies.
your mom
From the cradle to the grave!
I thought he was a good guy because of cartoons but now I'm ruined and shooked
Theres like 20000000 serial killer vidios
chimmuney??
Title looks like the writer stuttered
H.H.Holmes is Holmes Holmes Holmes
Ah,the "good old days"!!!
How you get into a room with no door?
Chiminees
So how did he get away with this? Police were this terrible?
Unfortunately this is incorrect. I'm from the UK and the famous Jack the ripper we all knew who he was, as the police had all information about him but couldn't say anything as he was apart of our royal family in the past, and because due to that we could never prosecute him due to what might happen when people found out.
Holmes was a genius.
You should do Herb Baumeister. Where he killed gay men while his wife was away.
Just binge watching his vids on serial killers
This channel loves serial killers. Good news; so do I.... ??
Nah fam the worst serial killer was dad from bastard on webtoon
I thought it’s Sherlock Holmes lololol
1 question...... Whats your deal with serial killers???????????
I have hemophobia, why am I even watching this...??
he has the same last name as me......
????????
O
This serial killers story is also seen in the amazing television show Timeless.
Qoute of his:"Pleasure will be mine when I throw you in my sick mind hahahahahah.Even if you want to escape you won't,my mind is my house."
Is it just me or do all serial killers have a diary how bait is that
There is also some evidence that Winston Churchill’s grand farther was Jack the Ripper. He was a known member of a satanic Freemason club (as they all still are to this day) and the women were used in rituals. Hence the mutilation. Churchill is also suspected to be the real father to the queen of England. It was well documented amongst royal friends and associates that he was sleeping with the queens mother for quite some time. Check it out. Look into it. Even if you thinks it’s bollocks it’s still fascinating to read.
“At the time, newspapers were known for their exaggeration.” Nothing changes. ??
They called the building gay lol XD 10 gamer likes I’m so edgy I eat ass so hilarious
The Sherlock comments are gold!
Am not from the west and hence I had no clue who was this H H Holms . I really feel this video is not up to the mark as I didn't get to know anything cruel about his murders!!!
U didn’t have to mention the animal part
Animals in the video ?! I will not watch ????
i keep on watching this kind of videos.
i’m suddenly very confused with the stuff i already know about this guy
Pls make more cereal killers vids
I think Ed Gein was worst. While not a huge body count, the nature of the crimes is beyond anything. I wouldn't look him up if you got a weak stomach.
Go for albert fish next that monstorsity needs a bit of spotlight
It was a very anticlimactic ending to this video... ??
Why the hell did people said he is the worst serial killer in history !!??There are way many more serial killers who are more cruel and gruelsome than he is..
Holmes fired contractors regularly to prevent anyone from fully memorizing the layout of the building. Clever beast. Brutal and deserving of the worst punishments, but clever.
American History ??
I love the music
Make more I’m out of buzzfeed unsolved videos
... I was born on May 16th uhhhhhhhh
The hotel like the Winchester house
So basically the real life jig saw
ngl thought of sherlock holmes at first
The 3 murderers! South Park reference. Lol.
Pearl didn't die duh! She went missing and rebelled against the diamonds
I think Jack the Ripper was more infamous than HH Holmes.
Just call him Triple H
American Horror stories - The Hotel Season was loosely based on him and his hotel.
I’m confused. The killer doctor or ted bundy?
The first thing that must have striked in most minds would be Sherlock Holmes.
It is the amount and complexity of the premeditation that goes into their acts that makes it so chilling. The other end of that spectrum is how depraved and gruesome they are.
When you find refuge in comments.
Jeffery dahmer
“Chiminies”
Knowing someone truly experienced getting tortured by him like I would experience getting tortured by him is chilling
Isn’t it interesting that most if not all of them didn’t use guns? It’s almost like the tool doesn’t matter if a person is hell bent on killing someone/multiple people.... Fascinating
American Horror Story season 5: Hotel remember James Patrick March
:P
Always wondered what it's like to be girl ??... Flick flick
chiminey cricket
Oh rip
BRO!! I'm eating and it said that someone ATE CHILDREN
Now that they've dug him up Sam and Dean can finally salt and burn his body.
ahh i remember when i used to stay up late rereading wikipedia about Albert Fish a lot of times.. haha
girls sure do like bad guys lmao
Jerffey Dahmer.
It's said when the trap of the gallows opened he said "I am Jack" before the noose tightened. And he is recorded saying he was born with the devil in him. He was one of the first people to be recorded on Edison's phonograph.
the way this dude said chimneys chimineys
Amen
Belle Gunness is definitely worse than Holmes by a mile.
So H H Holmes initials would be Triple H.
Keep this series going!
I have the same birthday as him.
Do a serial killer video on planned parenthood!!
mao and stalin were more heinous serial killers than holmes
One of the kids bones were found in the hotel the son and the two daughters were found burried in a rental house basement in another state
This is why I have a pistol on my nightstand
Comment section 75% (Sherlock Holmes And H H Holmes is related) 25% (Woah this guy is messed up!) 0.1% (Woah this is a really cool video i love the animation nice job! Teach me your ways)
no evidence then it's a lie. Too many chinese whisperers in this world
John wayne gacy ?
Chimernies
Why are people so cruel?
Didn’t he have a massive cremation chamber?
The house is like in the game Hello neighbor
Probably the most manipulative to women as well. He could get young women fall for him and do anything for him
wasn't that the AHS guy
I love how all these kinds of videos have longass intros
Oh birthday twins May 16th??????
Do Richard Ramirez
Chim-i-nies
rooms with no doors? how do you know that it's a room ?
Interesting how so many women fall for serial killers
nibba said h before it was cool
What is that dude that was charged for murder and a whole bunch of other things name Joseph something something something
Do Peewee Gaskins.
I need you guys to do the DC snipers!!
You sound so happy describing the gruesome killings lol
I was born on a serial killer's birthday. Fear me ????
I remember building a model of his place once in high school, still have it I think.
What about the Chinese communist leader who killed 20 million people by accident. I think his name was Mao. (Correct me if I’m wrong)
Y is it that people think Jack the Ripper is American he’s British americans stop claiming everything as yours
Are you trying to tell us something with this bunch of serial killer videos? lol
Ugh!
Kill one person and you're not a serial killer but you suck one dick and you're suddenly gay.
No shit Sherlock Oh... it's the wrong Holmes
Anyone thought of jigsaw when they saw the house
Chimanee
Hamilton Hamilton Home Owes Love Memes Everyday, Sucker
CMON HOLMES WHY DID YOU DO THAT HOLMES
is it bad that I'm unaffected by everything?
I have a friend and their last name is Holmes
We filmed the H.H. Holmes murder castle location on our channel and picked up some interesting readings.
What was the music in backround
Why do i like these videos?..........
Here cause of timeless
H. H. Homeless
H.H Holmes, Reminds Me Of Sherlock Holmes.
I like imagining his name was H.H. Gregg and that magazine mascot thing did all of it.
He married a flesh soap maker jk
Can you do BTK
If you’re a serial killer, WHY THE F#%K WOULD YOU WRITE A DIARY AND WRITE ABOUT YOU’RE MURDERES
The Murder Castle would make an excellent setting for a horror video game
this show would be way cooler if they tell us how they got caught
He's related to Jack The Ripper aye?
I know a worse serial killer. Pedro Alanso Lopez, also known as the Monster of the Andes. I honestly lost some of my faith in humanity when I learned of this guy.
I love the series, Keep it up!
I love how you make these videos informative yet they aren’t scary. Thanks.
Hannibal
These videos make my day and idk why ??
I was born in new Hampshire and still live here
I think Ed gien was pretty bad also. He would cut off people's faces and wear them, use their skin as appolstery, a film was made to portray him. The texas chainsaw massacre (based off Ed gien )
He murdered the Puh ????
I knew triple H was bad .-.
What if you call this guy an H.H.H
Why would you eat kids !!!!!!!!
What about in THE WORLD
Original Triple H. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!!
Sherlocks homes brother is the opposite to this guy
I think Albert Fish more heinous then H.H. Holmes
Me. I killed billions of microorganisms. Im also fastening the death of the universe by spreading the entropy faster which means it would reach thermal equillibrium faster
a documentary i watched said he took skeletons from people her murdered and sold them to universities?
(Insert Sherlock joke here.)
"CHIMMENNY"
Humans are truly the cruelest and most evil creatures to ever walk the earth. I thought Jack the Ripper was the worst but this guy seems to take the cake.
He will die by age
You forgot my 187 killstreak
chim-a-neys....
This is public shaming
Russian sleep lmao
I live in Chicago ????????????????????????????????
I heard Albert Fish and instantly remembered Secrets of Wisteria, which is a song based off Albert eating Grace. If you listen to it backwards, you can hear a bit of the letter he sent Grace's parents...
Speaking of Albert Fish, can you do a video on him? You guys are really good at covering this stuff and I wanna see your take on it.
Cannibal
poor cat
Sherlock Holmes Brother?
You're confusing us with Sherlock holmes

No dip sherlock
Donald trump he’s gonna nuke the Middle East and kill millions of people while they suffer from the blast. The government will allow it and he won’t be caught.
Ted bundy was the one that had the most kills
Regardless of how many they've killed or how they went about killing, they are all assholes!! ??????
“Chimineys”
The New Orleans axe-man was a notorious serial killer that was never founded, caught, or officially identified
Hey Infographics, can totally notice the difference in your narrating. Sounds so much better than your older videos! Great job, love it!
Something very messed up about recreating murderers/victims in these cutie infographic styles. :/
Jeffery Dahmer is worse
this looks like reigns 3

Will you do a video on the son of Sam
JeeJ da killa
wtf? 666k views?!?!?
I'm watching this and it has 666k views lol
Isnt holmes the detective
I believe he was (to an extent) "evil" and did "evil" things however it is wrong to portray him being born "evil" such as giving the baby a maniacal face and the stork being red and black . Humans are not made "evil" and only become "evil" through social conditioning or mental disabilities.

I've seen a documentary about him and that told that he used to go to forest as a young boy and examine dead animal bodies
Well I eat cerial everyday soo......
I watched the discovery and they had the same killing style but its only a theory. All though it's a theory but I believe Jack the Ripper is HH Holmes.
Worst serial killer in the world was stalin Killcount: 20 million LEGAL kills
you mean the best?
Hah Sherlock holmes
Marriage between 2 races like you showed was likely illegal so yeah.
I'm sorry but.... Holmes story is kind of tame when it comes to serial killer stories. I mean... he killed a shit ton of people but he wasn't like... wearing human skin or feeding other people human flesh. Something tells me Holmes wanted to buried so no one would dig up his grave... that was a fail. :/ I believe Holmes just didn't want anyone else to know exactly what was being built so he'd "not get along" with people. No one will ever know what the Murder Castle actually looked like. The one thing I believe people know about is the fact Holmes had a basement that stretched past the building.
If a serial killer was a Christian..that had strong faith to Jesus and prayed to Jesus everyday but still killed people..would he still go to heaven for believing in Jesus?
James March inspo
Wtf
I used to kill geckos and other larger lizards, rats, cats, chicks and hens, bats for fun.I like chopping their heads off, burning them while still concius , or just plane old staby di stab stab....I kinda like watching them suffer while slowly dying...is this a bad thing?
CHIM EN EES
Albert fish....
Hello Neighbor.
He killed his victims, removed all the meat off their bones, and would sell the skeletons to medical schools. I think you forgot to mention that.
I wonder who is behind Holmes all along is it Benedict Cumberbatch or Robert Downey Jr?
Winchester lmao
You've heard of evil morty Now you've heard of... Evil sherlock
I once read a book about Albert fish and it freaked me out
I live in Chicago :(

What a waste, the devil isnt even real.
Be carfeul a serial killer is on lose welp dont breakfast do this for safety

Thank you for the tips.
Represent!??
This guy is triple H
People like this remind me of the guys from se7en or saw.
i beileave that all the rumers about his house were true, i actully read a book about him and his murders and according to what i read the stuff described in this video didnt even scratch the surfaace.
No. The worst is either John Wayne Gacy, or Jeffrey Dahmer. One killed over 30 little boys and one tried to turn men into sex zombies by pouring acid inside their brains through a hole that Dahmer drilled himself. He is pretty horrific though.
Can't wait until the movie gets made! The book (Devil in the White City) was really great.
The Infographics Show should be next :D
Is it ironic that his name is Holmes
AHS
I got the same birthday as him ??
Michael Myers is I think the worst serial killer
Isn’t that Triple H?
“Chimineys”?
"a house of horror that makes no sense to people" ooh, i wanna visit it now
Please do a video on Albert fish
You guys do so much research, it's fantastic!
Hang-ginggg
Nature makes serial killers to keep the population low...
Do a video on Albert Fish and mention Secrets of Wysteria
Who IS the worst "killer" of all time? Just wondering..
Do another serial killer,Light Yagami also known as Kira xD
I am the worst cereal killer of all! I have cereal for breakfast every day!!!! Mwahahahaha XD
Please do videos on every sk you’ve mentioned in this, the zodiac, and ripper videos. Some of them sound interesting as hell. True stories are the scariest to listen to while working during the day.
He's my 3rd cousin
Gary ridgeway did nothing wrong

There was a guy who ate children?!
Probably shouldn't be watching this before bed..
Well i can't sleep for the rest of the night
Make a dr death vid
Eating children!?!? Even crazy people should have boundaries.
Holmes, a detective and murdered. Detective Murder!
Woah, chimaneys
So scary
what about ed gein? he made all tons of shit by actual human body parts and ate their organs.
Nah albert fish is worse
Chimmeneys?

American horror story ^^
HE WAS BORN ON MY SONS BIRTHDAY ON MAY 16 2008
And my b-day is may 15 and the last day of school and that means no presents because of EXAMS
American horror story: hotel ???
This is so fascinating! Lol I found out a few years ago that I’m actually related to him! (He’s like my great great uncle or something) Might explain my morbid curiosity about this kind of stuff.
No, Albert Fish is the worst, even if he killed less people.
It's crazy that i lived in the town he was born at. The house he grew up in is still there and pretty freaky, also the town has a lake called Sawyer lake(name of the family from Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Crystal Lake(Friday the 13th) also has Elm Street. Also the Book Peyton Place was set in Gilmanton which is insane.
Jack the Ripper!
H. H. Holmes made me think of Sherlock at first sight
Omg our birthdays are one day apart!
There is a book i read called, "The devil in the white city." An there is evidence Holmes did not act alone. The worlds fair was taking place during the peak of these murders. The elitist an wealthy men of the world were all in the city during the time and it seems like some would pay money to go torture and kill in Holmes Hotel.
Nah Bayharbor Butcher
What music is being used in the video
There is one killer who is silent but deadly. It's very known. It is... Carbon monoxide
I do realize that he was the worst serial killer but still y'all have to admit that the background music is on point
Sounds like real life jigsaw
the walls of the hotel rooms were filled with copper pipes that would blow poisonous gases while his victims were asleep. He advertised the hotel to appeal to tourists coming to chicago for the world fair. his hotel was burned down and now there is a post office there
Could you make a video about the Zodiac killer?
I'd say that Jack the Ripper is the worst killer, because he would cut out women's uteruses and wombs. He even said in a letter to the police that he would send them an ear from a woman that he was about to kill, but someone had walked by before he was able to finish and he ran. That woman's death was the least brutal since only her throat was slit.
Bizarrely enough I trust Wikipedia’s depiction of him more. The going theory on there being that he suffocated the victim and then dissected them, selling their skeleton for medical science.
Why would he have to be born on my birthday
He was born on my birth day so creppy
Woah
Was American Horror Story inspired by this guy ?
LMAO my best friend is related to this guy
I like the serial killer things in this channel
Why do they think that he is Jack the Ripper if he is then why don’t they find the diaries again and compare them to the letters he sent to the police saying what he did to his victims
the monster of the andes is probably more heinous. and he is possibly free right now.
heres one thats not real: Jason Voorhers
H. H. Holmes? Who the fuck would name their child HHH ?
"Chimenies"
That's ironic, the most famous detective shares a name with the most horrific serial killer
Funny how Holmes is also the last name of a fictional detective
I was born in NH
There was once a women who killed people and cooked them into stew and cookies, then gave them to the neighbors. Idk her name, but fuck that's wrong. It was some european women. I believe.
Axe man of new orealn
I live in a place were a serial kill was born yyayy Send help
Jack the Ripper is beloved to be part of the royal family so how’s he related to this American dude?
Imagine read the title as Sherlock Holmes the worst killer in hisssstory
Is he the brother of sherlock holmes ?
ceral killer
I know one thing about this guy, he was exceptionally charming. And women couldn't keep 'em paws in place, in front of him.
next you should do btk
Nah the worst serial killer was a killer bear from the 90s
You wanna name of a serial killer, Eisenhower. Yes, that Eisenhower.
Wait sherlok holms
He didn’t dismembered the bodies. It was likely that he sold the skeletons of his female victims to a university. That’s why a lot of the bodies he killed weren’t found.
When they mentioned about the ‘hotel’ Holmes designed, my first thought was the Winchester House.
Holy hobo holmes
What if his brother was Sherlock Holmes.lmao
I live in the same city that a serial killer was in and people made a famous movie about him
Wow. His name is H.H.H
Chimeneys
The Axeman Of New Orleans
I think its a great video but I would like a more family friendly video but very informative none the less.
Anyone click on this cause of Timeless
He killed people at the Chicago world's fair. The building is a post office now . He is the first noted serial killer in America he missed a whole bunch of stuff
When you said Harold Shipman I thought you said Harold Shitman lmao.
I like this types of videos
We might even get a movie of it in the next couple years with Scorsese as the director and screenplay writer, starring DiCaprio as H.H. Holmes!
You all should do one for the black dahila
holmes is 100% british just look a the clothes
I kinda admire jack the rippers way
This was posted on my bday
anyone getting hello neighbor house vibes?
Can you please do a video about Atlantis?
I love these serial killer videos from the infographic show
Reminds me of AHS: the hotel
fuck, why do i keep watching shit like this?
Yes, I know a more insane serial killer than him. His name is Janák Jeno József. He is a convicted bisexual pedophile. He is a coffee cup poisoner, who was trained in Toxicology by the Hungarian forensic, he used to work in the Judicial morgue as a Coroner, so he is well trained in how destroy all evidence. He still alive and lives in Berlin, working for a religious organization and as a police informant. Because he's a rat, they don't mind that he is a criminal.
What do you use to make your videos?
I just saw an episide of timeless about it
I think we should take a moment to actually appreciate how well written these videos are.
Girls love mysterious guys!! HMM
Well, I am the most terrible serial killer cause I can eat 100 boxes of cereal in one hour Oh wait...
I'm stressing how many irl serial killers (or potential ones) have contributed to the 252,504 views of this video?
Sherlock Holmes ??
Holmes. The irony.
Indias stoneman
What's a "say-in-ist"? Is there a T in that word? OH. You meant "saTinist". Just like you meant "wriTTen", not "wri-en". And "cerTainly", not "cer-inly". Worst voiceover person in YouTube history. Learn how to speak...
My last name is Holmes...
This guy is the real life Saw !!!
Chimineys ????
Miau
Wow. Out of the few famous people in New Hampshire one of them has to be a sick serial killer.
Ted bundy
Yes, Holmes was Satan on Earth.
North Korean Leaders... IL Sung and his son... They're one of the worst killers and don't forget, Adolf Hitler.
ummm no Jeffrey Dahmer always be the king lol
stalin was worse serial killer
To me personally I think the worst serial killer was Albert Fisch
Man, i just love your content.. Thank you for making an infographic about serial killers. Keep it up guys.
I know one ! in 2018. They or he killed least 25 child girls whose age is around 7 to 13 ! They have still lots of child girls. He or they are still alive !
Because of the chemical attack that happens in Syria tensions are high between Russia and America,UK do America and UK v Russia because that's what it'll.
do i hear 'River Flows In You' in the background? xd or is it just me
chimehney
Aaron Mahnke did two phenomenal episodes on Holmes on "Lore."
I don't know.....Albert Fish was a fucked up individual. But HH Holmes was far more calculated and crafty than most other killers. The murder castle is now a post office, Chicago is fucking awesome, and that makes it better.
I did a project on H. H. Holmes and theirs somethings that are missing. And also the child missing part he wasn't an adult, he was maybe six or seven are the time. He had gone fishing with a friend and his friend never returned. He also started torturing and mutilating animals at a young age. As he moved around the country he would kill someone along the way.
Pls make a video about gary ridgeway, the green river killer. Police maged to confirm 200 of his kills. He cut off his victims head and pther body parts and raped them. Now thats cruel
Plot twist: He is related with Sherlock Holmes M I N D B L O W N
yea another one i m interested in these kind of stories ??
Is that hotel still standing? If so it would be interesting to go there someday
US a nation of sick
I wish you wouldn't have given any plug to Holmes realitve. Let's go back a bit, it wasn't 2017 when he announced Holmes was Jack, he's been stating this for quite a few years, he only got History involved because they felt it would be a good story. Holmes' relative is just in his own world who thinks they're related, basically to draw attention to himself try to be the "great man who solved the greatest murder mystery of our lifetime." His information has been inconsistent, it's changed throughout the years, he's basically trying to make evidence fit. There is no substantial evidence linking Holmes as Jack... None what so ever. Their motives are very different, how they went about their murders were very different, even how they felt about it was very different. No... And I repeat NO Ripper-ologist believes, even entertains the idea of Holmes and Jack being the same person. People who've studied Jack for decades, their life trying to learn the truth... No one has ever legged these two men as the same man. It's crap. I wish people would stop giving attention to Holmes relative. He's delusion. I believe HE believes he's right... But he's not. Then people get misinformed based on another's opinions, then this conveludes the stories and their history for the future. Like Flat Earthers. Some idiots believe it, and they are able to bend the weak minded into believing their crap, which just causes more and more problems.
Reminds me of American Horror story.
Gary Ridgeway or John Wayne Gacy
It's disgusting how you visualize these horrible events as cute cartoons.
Do Edmund Kemper or Jeffery Dahmer
Did he just call it Chimuny
I have a friend who's related to him.
Loved this although I think Jeffery Dahmer was wayy worse than Holmes Also can you guys make one on Elisa Lam? It a very baffling and creepy mystery
This man inspires me to be the very best SK.
Is He the real triple H?
Ed Gein. Nuff said.
Why is Sherlock Holmes so famous
Headless Horseless Holmes
Ur videos are so good and freaking have perfect citation I love this channel
this is so darkk
make a video about notorious mafia men pls <3
I love these videos, but you guys should also make a video on facebook and their privacy rights, and other social medias and stuff in general. Would be super interesting. Love your stuff!
Welcome to Chicago, we have the best murderers, nobody can best us there.
It's hard to take the video seriously with the cutesy looking animation.
It used to say worst serial killer but now horiffic
The worst serial killer is the one you haven’t heard yet
Holmes vs Holmes
I'm majoring in criminal justice and watching these videos you learn a thing or two. Thanks. Maybe try making a video on the DC Sniper
I am so much in love with these serial killers videos ???. Keep them coming
Albert Fish
He is born after my birthday that’s why I’m called a psychopath
Why do I watch these at night!?!?
My birthday is may 16

H. H. Holmes: the first thot slayer
You guys should do the "Punisher" next. He's the only good serial killer that's out there
You should read "The Devil in the White City" if you haven't yet. It's all about H.H. Holmes. My aunt read it and explained it to my dad and then he read it and told me what it was about (H.H. Holmes during the world fair) and the things he did. I plan on reading it in a few years :)
Top 10 saddest anime deaths science still can't explain
John Wayne Gacy was another Gruesome serial killer, also committing his crimes in the Chicagoland area
Whoa whoa whoa! I love torturing animals(mostly little dogs) when i was still a kid, does it mean that im a psychopath?
According to, “The Devil in the White City” by Erik Larson, Holmes actually had a crematory built in the basement of the hotel, where he would dispose of the bodies by cremating them.
TRIPLEEEEEEEEE H
That was a pointless video
The way you pronounce depravity, is very odd to me.
Wouldn’t it be the BEST serial killer??????
"And ate children " WHAT THE H
Do Russia serial killer next
huh sounds like a jerk
We manage to catch Jack the ripper
The problem with H.H. Holmes being Jack the Ripper was Holmes was more organized than Jack the Ripper. While Holmes might have been a serial killer he was also the type who sought to profit from his murders either by insurance fraud or else selling their skeletons to medical schools as he supposedly did with one of his victims. Jack the Ripper on the other hand was more impulsive with his murders and generally left the bodies where they were killed, an organized killer is more likely to move the bodies or try to hide them, but Jack did not.

Hentai Haven Holmes
Sherlock ,we found your evil twin brother!
Did you change the title?
Quicklime was commonly mixed with glass shards when used as a weapon creating an inescapable dust in the air causing you to suffocate and burn while the dust would combust from the heat around you not to mention the glass shards ripping your throat apart while you breath it in.
Hentai Haven Holmes?
Wasn't he in American horror story?
We read his story in lit... Chilling
Yeah I can name one, me. Great thing about YouTube I learned Is that nobody sees or reads your comments. God bless you Rodger stay safe brother. I’m doing your will.
Who built that house? He certainly could not do it himself.
Homework is A U T I S M
It’s hh he’s evil
Ruined it but before it said 666 comments lol
O SHEET WHAT THE FUCK
666 comments?? Now it's 667
This should be a movie
Japan turned Jack the Ripper into a cute little girl. So she's my favorite.

I listened to the Lore podcast episode on this guy last year, but I’m probably still gonna be too scared to sleep
Do a theory on why twats think the world is flat
The fact that if I had no self control and would possibly be on this list is kinda scary.
Christopher Columbus was a worse murderer, towards the fact of americas freedom
Can you do the worst dictator in history.
I would call all the black people lynched and killed in America as the worst serial killer in America... Not this guy...
“Hmmm”
He is a hero
Oh I know who he was. I thought I didn't for a bit
H.H. Holmes - The Most Horrific Serial Killer in US History? closes curtains locks door turns on light I'm listening....
I'd HIGHLY recommend reading "The Devil in the White City." It is perhaps one of the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of Holmes' life and crimes, as well as an in depth exploration of the process by which the Chicago World's Fair came to be, and it is written like a narrative, really pulling the reader into the scenes discussed. Like his victims you'd find him charming and captivating, but then the lengths to which the author would go on to describe Holmes' would leave you with a feeling of utter rage and disgust. And the book only reports on incidents generally considered to be the most accurate to the actual events, as analyzed by the findings of the time and modern day expert interpretations. All the specific killings discussed in the book are one's known to be true.
Damnit. I not only love these video's so much, but I respect them to. You, unlike many, many other channels that cover similar content, acknowledge that Holmes could have only killed 9, instead of fantasizing about the man and making him seem as horrific as any human being can get. I fucking love these
Jeffery Dahmers.
You forgot to mention that he used to strip down the bodies of flesh and sell the skeletons to medical schools, which was a booming underground business at the time as many medical schools were short on cadavers for their students.
John Holmes died of aids.
HHH
It was also rumored that he murdered his 9yr old younger cousin by drowning her near a creek.
Weird, He is indeed H. H. H
I like his hotel
How about the human minds?
Axeman of New Orleans
Ayy I live in New Hampshire. Also born in it too
The Cleveland Torso Murderer (aka The Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run) was probably the most violent and disturbing serial killers in my opinion, especially since they got away with it.
I bet with the right mindset a man or woman could challenge and kill holmes in his home. he would have the field advantage ofcourse, but give me a weapon if i was born in this time id be down to pretend to be the unsuspecting victim, its worth the risk to prevent his future victims from dying.
I fainted, this is horrific.
H H doesn’t even look like a killer, he looks like a employed 1800’s white guy with three wife’s
Why would he want a coffin full of concrete?
chimineys
This dude was a boss.
Easy quick killing ! wanna know ? Do mass shooting Like vegas !
He needs to make a video on Albert fish(not his real name)!! It's a creepy cool story
chim-e-nies?
URAL (NOT ORAL)!
It’s a useless video . 90 % of the data you present is speculation/exaggeration/alleged things in your own words. He could have done this or that this or that was never proven etc.
Ed Gein
69 Dislikes ( ?° ?? ?°) Nice
Do more of these, they are interesting.
This guy was Jack the ripper
I just can’t rape my mind around this. Why would people do such a thing. ??
buriedxinblack YES
So, you’re really into serial killers.
You would think after so many murders in a hotel people would oh I don't know not be white and go there anyway
Well that's another hotel that's I am never going to
I think he was one who like to eat his victims my question is did he?
the white angel is my pick.
Introverts vs Extroverts
I would say the worst in history was the swamp murders or the mad butcher of kingsbury run
He was featured in NBC’s Timeless
Also expected Pogo the Clown to be mentioned.
So basically it's the Winchester House but with an actual demon in it?
I hate his voice but love video content
Holmes has nothing on Albert Fish. Fish is S tier in "Fucked In the Head"
chimeneys
Satanists these fucking days
Infographic? More like tabloid graphic
Am I late, cos I am too lazy to click the video from my recommendations
Chiminies
Jeffery donner
That's crazy man how u find this stuff
A killer never mentioned, the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run! Aka Cleveland's Torso Killer of the 1930's. I've always thought he was the most grisly and macabre serial killer in US history. His reign of terror lasted several years. And the worst part... He was never captured or identified. Look it up!
What am I doing with my life
Let me nominate Winston Churchill who killed 16 million people in India.
The most horrific serial killers are the ones you never know exist
There is a serial killer in Tacoma rn that no one is talking about The police aren't even aware that this recent string of murders is connected
Obviously Hitler and Stalin arent mentioned at all.....
Some people are F*cked up...
What's the theme song of the music that's playing in the background of the video, commet if you know the name of it thank you..
stop it, get some help.
Do one on Ed Gene
If you kill someone we will kill you back
It is said that first Jack the Ripper knock out his opponent. He had a statute of 6.3 and about 109 kg. Women were no match to Jack the Ripper. He used chloroform or sometimes a heavy instrument to knock out his target.
I find it harder not to believe the horror stories about him. By now, we all know the wretched things we humans can do to each other--why bother trying to soften Holmes up and rationalizing his evil?
Bitch please I killed thousands in GTA

"He is dead" Boi were they wrong! - James (TheOdd1sOut)
Yeah right England’s most famous serial killer was American haaaaaa don’t make me laugh !!! Of all the bullshit stories about J T R this is the most absurd !!! J T R was most defiantly connected to royal family ... ??????????????
Hang on a sec....
Fish is my hero! Such a great man!... Aside from the gay things he did.
I'm sorry but I lost it when you said "Chimney's"
Are Sherlock Holmes and H. H. Holmes related?
(Fnaf) William Afton aka purple guy
Do a video on secret codes! OUOSVAVV Is one of the coolest!
I read that in a magazine he had a hotel where he killed all wtf I think it’s Jack the Ripper
Wait. Weekend comes early?
This is a case for Sherlock Holmes
Do a video on nithari killings from India
So I was watching a photoshop tutorial and on the recommended panel there was a new video from It's Okay to be Smart about the origins of life on earth. I clicked on the link and watched the video. But when I scrolled down to comment, the comment section wouldn't load. So I reloaded the page but then it said the video was unavailable. I checked other videos on YouTube and they were loading fine. Would someone mind explaining what happened? This happened just now BTW.
George W Bush
No, H. H. Holmes was not a serial killer. I don't care how loose or expansive the F.B.I's definition of serial killer is – a true serial killer is one who murders primarily for sexual satisfaction. Whatever murders H. H. Holmes committed, he did so in furtherance of fraud and other financial crimes. While we're at it: Charles Manson was not a serial killer either; the murders he committed or had carried out were for the purpose of exercising control over his cult. So, remember, just because someone kills three or more people over a period of time, they are not necessarily a serial killer.
Take it slow please
Holmes certainly was NOT Jack the Ripper. His relative is simply wanting to cash in. Neither was he the worst American serial. He mainly killed through gas, which often can be somewhat painful. Still, compared to other killers like BTK, Holmes wasn't that sadistic. Unlike most serial killer, Holmes usually killed for profit. He killed to get people's money and sometimes sold their skeletons to medical schools. It's likely the number of victims are greatly inflated, even by Holmes himself. It wasn't until he was nearing his date of execution that he began admitting to many murders, even those that were later known not to be his victims. He was a narcissist who loved attention, and endless confessions guaranteed visitors. Also there was no evidence linking him to the boys, as you pointed out. My guess is that if he killed more than the nine known victims it wasn't many more. If the count was over 15 I'd be very surprised.
Ive figured his real identity
He sold the skeletons of his victims to universities for profit
Wouldn’t H. H. Homes be known as the best serial killer since he was very good at it.
If i was to guess who jack the ripper really was id say it wasn't just one man but a group of aristocrats killing people they found to be the bottom of society at that time.
rooms with no doors?? how do they know??
"Chimeknee" XD

A brief about videos topic will be appreciated
Legend says.. that to this day he is still stuck inside a circle of salt...
I like how these videos they give you theories and facts so you can make you own theories.
BTK was pretty bad. However Albert Fish was awful. Just horrible what he did to children.
I can't explain maybe it's cause of the subject of this video. but I suddenly realized this is the guy from Crash Course Media Lit. And a strange chill oozed down my back. It sounds insane and when I read it I thought 'that's not how we experience cold but low and behold... I love novels
This guy is the best at fortnite
I didn't know triple H could do all that
Geez
I love the part "in ths part of the infographic show"
Sorry but you didnt actually say what he did to his victims. Yea, he was sadist and tortured people, but what (supposedly) he did?
Welp
(unpopular opinion) Jack the ripper is an overrated serial killer.
The Zodiac California
Holmes? Pretty ironic
Uh... H.h.holmes DEFINITELY did those things. No question about it.

Obama killed tens of thousands when he dropped over 100,000 bombs and still managed to get a peace prize...He cause the displacement of millions and ruined many nations. I know who my vote is for, for "The Most Horrific Serial Killer in US History"
Probally sherlock Holmes solved this
After listening to the first 36 seconds of this video its hard to believe there's a god that would allow shit like that to happen.
Do a face reveal like if you agree.

I've been hearing claims that one of Holmes's murdering motives was to sell the skeletons of his victims to medical institutes for profit Also, Martin Scorsese is planning to make a movie about Holmes. DiCaprio is gonna play him
Do Charles Manson.
.
Could you cover Belle Gunness?
HAHA BEFORE 4,409 VIEWS
I though Sherlock Holmes xD
why is he a taurus? damn...
It's unlikely he was Jack the Ripper, as the rippers victims were all prostitutes, his other alleged victims were not. This guy seemed to kill for profit and to get out of difficult situations. Many people have lied about or faked evidence about the Ripper. Info graphics should look at Richard Kuklinsky. He was a mafia hit man who killed, by his own admission 150+ people. There's a documentary about him called The Iceman Interviews, which is just him talking. The guy was chilling, it's well worth a watch if you're into killers and what make them tick.
This guy looks like Sherlock Homes.
ayy it's my favourite serial killer
Mein gott this is creepy.

When you said "worst," I thought you meant someone who isn't good and hardly got any victims.
This is like real life saw
Love the ep but he did have lyme pits to get rid of the bodies and he never used the same building crew twice
I thought "worst" here meant shitty. But TBH that would actually be a good video.

Turned off when he mentions Brexit and xenophobia in the same sentence...
Brexit has nothing to do with rasicm or xenophobia. It's about unlimited immigration causing wage depression, it's about zero hour contracts instead of permanent contracts, it's about unelected Presidents making decisions with no accountability or transparency, I can go on and on.

FINTECH won't be widely accepted unless KYC/AML so is a big problem to get rid of central control. He injects his liberal ideas and conflates it with Brexit (which reinstates democracy) - he ironically promotes an unelected EU control. The video was good except for that part.

Why Why Why? Why would he show on the screen behind him pictures of gold Bitcoin Coins.. which actually do not exist.. never have existed nor will ever exist.

He said Blockchain will be the most promising technology in the coming decade (Not even AI will match the impact of blockchain). This talk was in 2016. And it's already outdated. Excitement over blockchain is gone. But AI is changing and shaping the coming decade.
The world is certainly changing. . .and this is one area that so many people are having a tough time wrapping their head around change. People need to get on board.
That was beautiful

GREAT TALK BY A GREAT SPEAKER !!!
Without incentivizing individuals to run nodes the blockchain is less efficient and just as mutable as cloud computing. The blockchain will work for currency (bitcoin), social media (bit.tube) and maybe a few other things the public absolutely is willing to work to keep censorship-free but who is going to run nodes to track soybeans? A centralized group of soybean coops? How is that the "trust protocol"?
Great

We tend to think that the world's problems are intractable and unsolvable. Like biological evolution, there is a natural path of development as Consciousness irresistibly moves to higher ground and greater purpose, most recently through technology. Where are all the movies and TV shows that depict the emergent REALITY of a future of equanimity and security? Dystopia is soooo last century. On to the stars and beyond.

Peer to peer no need too middle man
Engaging! Elucidative!
This guy clearly doesnt know what he talks about, just because its a blockchain doesnt mean its immutable, Ethereum already rolled back their blockchain in the first smart contract called the DOA. They lost their funds and had to rollback the blockchain in order to get them back. The result was a chainsplit creating ethereum classic. Dont belive me? do your own research.. Blockchain is only valuable if its decentralized and so far Bitcoin is the only decentralized chain, with the largest hashpower. And with the only proven immutablility. When Mtgox got hacked Bitcoin didnt rollback its blockchain for ex..
A couple of things: 1) 2018 is most similar to 2017 so technically seasonality is more likely not to work 2) you can draw a triangle in 10 different ways, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was no breakout to either side 3) too many people are expecting 6-7k which makes me believe that either we've seen the bottom or the price is going to go a lot lower than 6-7k. If you think everyone will just hold hands, buy Bitcoin at the "bottom" for 6-7k and then hold until the next bubble you are terribly mistaken. Bottom = prices are low, price movements are small, the volume is dead, interest is small and nobody (except the smart money) wants to touch Bitcoin. I'm saying 65% bottom is in, 35% we're going to 4k or lower. Remember - if everyone is thinking the same way then nobody's thinking. Currently more people than not think we will see 6-7k (and stop there). I am glad to write here about my wonderful strategy for crypto currency trading and mining. I know for a fact that a lot of people have lost to shady crypto currency exchangers, ICO’s and dubious blockchain websites. But there is an opportunity to actually make profit from investing and mining crypto currency in the right way. With my investment advice, you can make money while you sleep and also make money from profit generating auto pilot for mining lots of crypto currencies. Also there is an investment offer with guaranteed profit returns for instant top up of bitcoin to your bitcoin address. If you are interested kindly contact at paulalebrentonfx@gmail.com

For as log as we cannot buy from supermarkets houses, cars, electrical power, pay taxes, etc with cryptocurrency, it will always depend on dollars*, euros, etc because the power consumed is measured this way. For this to actually happen, the *amount of cryptocurrency in existence should be able to support americas or europe's global economy. This will never happen (bitcoin mining is coming to an end due to power that is consumed) and the last time I've checked cryptocurrency is still valued in dollars. The only thing that cryptocurrency CURRENTLY does is just consuming power. Haters are welcome, as long as they clearly state their exact disagreement.

In my opinion the bull run will begin at the end of this year, in 2017 we did not have the capacity to sustain the bull run longer because the existing exchanges could not handle the volume of new investors trying to enter the market. I do understand that it was still overbought and a correction was inevitable. The market had almost no structure. Now with all the new infrastructure being put in place should eliminate most of that problem. In the meantime, market will continue to do what it has been doing. The smart investors are beginning to accumulate more bitcoin through Mr. Mark’s strategy and more will do so if we drop even lower. My guess is the bottom will be between 5.8- 6 k Too much institutional investment occurring for the market not to recover soon. You can contact Mr. Mark hall at markhall279@gmail. com
This guy has a problem with banks!
2% of remittance is still robbery. Have you heard of XRP. It is much faster than Bitcoin and more importantly cheaper (basically free)?
The concepts behind blockchain have been around for a while. But centralized middlemen will NEVER give up control. They will either find a way to utilize blockchain or scrap it altogether OR buy all the patents for it and use it for useless projects internally.
fab, How ?? doing?

This is scary. Another way to create money out of nothing just like fiat standard and standard banking operation did. The further we are from the gold standard to print our money, the more holes of opportunities are made for whoever has enough capital to invest in this. No more privacy, and yet bigger gap between rich and poor.

People too poor to have a bank account?  But somehow they will have enough money for all the things necessary  to deal in bitcoin? ANYTHING on a computer will be hackable eventually.  Crypto viruses are coming.  the people and institutions you are attempting to side step will soon own this technology. The US government and really any of the top 5 governments will never allow anything to replace their money, so they will either squash it or own it.
PHX token/coin seems as if it is going to be a huge player in what he is saying. Not a bad idea to take a look at PHX. could be th future.

We are hurting people with money. God does not want us to hurt people. He wants us to obey ask and receive and seek and find. Satan invented money. People who think they are rich are not rich. They have nothing. Money comes from nothing. God is a giver. God needs to be in us.

BREXIT wasn't caused xenophobia. It was a revolt against 21 unelected commissionaires controlling the lives of tens of millions of people. The fact that Tapscott doesn't understand this underlies the rage felt across the world for out of touch elites. Stop calling people racists and they might have more respect for you.

yeah basically people are starting to realize value in just about anything, both a problem and a blessing. I feel crypto currencies that actually have a particular use like Deeponion and Defense like additional protection for crypto and storing hashes of files inside blockchains etc will prevail as people every now and then will re-think and re-strategize over what they hold.

Patience is one thing, but knowing when, why and how to be patient is another thing. I bought 13k worth of BTC and my BTC was loosing value. I didn't know what to do. I was frustrated and angry cause I was losing money and I even told my friends I could never invest on BTC again and almost sold it all at a loss, until I stumbled across someone on Altcoin Buzz channel, who advised us to reach out to a man named Luke George who helps young crypto investors by teaching a very great strategy in trading their BTC. It's been a while since I reached out to him, and I can proudly say my portfollio has increased. I'm happy I didn't sell it at the time I wanted to cause I would have been at a great loss and full of regret. You can all learn from him, so you can reach out to him through his email - lukealexandergeorge@outlook.com

brilliant speech!!!!
A blockchain by itself is useless. You need it to be decentralized. For that, you need to provide economic incentive through game theory. Otherwise, you are still trusting the same party, but instead of a database, they use a blockchain.

Airbnb on blockchain—— Cryptocribs
Title "How the blockchain is changing money and business" -- I think this needs some clarification, because this is brainwashing at it's finest, with the choicest words selected... In itself, it is just an inference, but such a statement put in the heads of millions of people, many of which are likely to believe everything they hear as though it were truth, and not inference.   To bring something about into reality you must make the false assumption that such is being done, regardless of whether or not it actually is.   Sort of like the incident that put the bankers in power as the Civil war was being lost on one side, the losing side sent an envoy to pass the message that the losers had actually won the battle, but by the time the truth made it back, it left the Country near bankrupt, with the bankers on top to control the future of the world, one lie at a time. Let's not jump to hasty conclusions this time, and perhaps God willing, maybe we can win one on behalf of humanity, and take one away from those filthy rich old farts trying to bring chaos and World Government to fruition.

Whenever anyone says a technology (like the internet) will be a blessing for us, don't buy it. The internet, and the blockchain, will result in a total mess. take the 5th point for example, and how the blockchain will "create prosperity" for artists. Smh. How long will it take for a intelligent pirate Bay blockchain which can't be shut down uploads all the music for free? This idea of capitalism added upon blockchain is flawed. the way forward is to treat ideas, and intellectual property, as free agents without any "ownership". That is the true Utopia of our time and the only way forward
Can blockchain be used in youtube, so that creators get paid fairly?
Insider has predicted that xrp will hit $12,000 per coin due to derivatives.

The word «value» is being thrown around without a clear explanation of what it actually stands for... The growth of inequality has nothing to do with whatever digital technology is in place or being used by society... The reading of books such as «Philosophy of Poverty», by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1847) and «The Poverty of Philosophy» by Karl Marx (1847) should be mandatory to any one who discusses the societal impact of technologies such as «blockchain».

Great talk Don. Some really disrupting blockchain applications.Let's create prosperity (where we can)!
Privacy is not the foundation of a free society. Where'd he get that crap? Respect for Life, Liberty and Private Property (or the ability to enjoy the fruit of one's own labors) as inalienable rights granted by Nature and Nature's God is the foundation of a free society.
Love the information this guy shares about blockchain. But, he's in la-la land if he thinks the problem of private property ownership being in jeopardy in third world dictatorships (or first world tyrannies for that matter) is a technological-transparency problem. A dictator or tyrant doesn't take your stuff because he can switch paper title work around and substitute his paper for yours - he does it because his bullets and bombs are bigger than yours.
Don "Con" Tapscott a financial populist dictator himself ....!! A modern day "financial" medicine show actor....!!
Bitcoin/blockchain was made by the new world (financial) orders, the USA elites (oligarchs), the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel)

Great salesman looking for the next big disruption to profit... so technology can now solve inequality? Wow! Let’s come down to the basics.. Tech is a tool, not a social policy. Yes it can solve technical problems, but not human problems...
Block chain democracy is coming and many in the audience won't be too happy about it when they're favorite middleperson politician is made obsolete.
Blockchain technology of the future. I want to realize my dreams. so uchastyu to ICO #TokenGo and generosity will help us. Good luck.
Filipinos around the world sends money back to their family and this makes the backbone of the Philippine economy.
This stuff is already legendary! This guy could not have been more right already!
it's a great explanation I ever see. and he clearly explain another opportunity in the future about blockchain technology.
Can’t that woman just transfer money, via say, PayPal ? 10 years ago I heard 3D printing would revolutionize everything - and, um, it’s around, that’s about it I like some of the security/identification applications - others like the currency side - not so much

Great pretension, well said :)
Best way to explain such an complex stuff thnk u????
Inspiring and I get it now!
What is this? Speech of they year 2016? That was beautiful! Excellent job Don! Blockchain technology is so exciting!
Garbage
it was good until bringing up Brexit
Such an outstanding presentation and clearly articulated.
This is the best description of the Blockchain and it capability’s and advantages I have seen. Great work great speech.
That happened again in Honduras just a few days ago... This might change the world for the better..
Got introduced to the blockchain today, thanks to the author of this most knowledgeable talk! Will surely delve deeper into this most awesome tech later on.
I hope that in our lifetimes we get to find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
Sorry, but this guy is an idiot. And he scored a TED talk. Using crypto behind a scheme to exchange value is somewhat clever. The blockchain notion behind Bitcoin is ... not bad. Read the Bitcoin paper several years back. The crypto bits looked mostly OK, but realized I did not understand what made "money" work, so went off and did some reading. As a software guy with a long term interest in security, we know to subvert security at the weakest point. In the realm of "cryptocurrency" that means hacking the exchanges, not the protocol. This we have seen. What defines "money"? What makes a "currency" work? Digging back into history, of all the (many!) variants tried, a token for exchanging value only works when the token is backed by a stable government. A government taxes broadly, and pays to narrow. The economic activity of stable government is massive, and sufficient to anchor the value of money. The tokens of "cryptocurrency" are root simply numbers. Those numbers have no anchor to value. Without an economic context to promise value to those numbers, the innate value of those numbers is zero. There is no value created by cryptocurrencies. This is a zero sum game. This is transfer of real wealth to the early/lucky to the late/unlucky. Nothing more.
what is 2% that paid to Abra? doesn't that mean Abra still the intermediary?
great content, Thanks!
he told everyone it was DEMONcrazy at its finest; residences already have the BLACK-Box on them; they are called SMART-METERS; do you people not look up and see the chemtrails in the sky ? or the mercury & formaldehyde in vaccines ? or the roundup in the food chain? What good is taxed MOON-EYE/digital or fiat going to do one when one CONTRACTS cancer, autism, dementia or any other disease that these CORPORATIONS produce to make a profit from keeping people in a state of perpetual WAR?
So instead of fiat by government you get fiat by digital "cashless" transaction designed for complete domination by the dark forces. Suckers are born every day and this is no different.

The most simplest yet comprehensive way to explain what block chain can do! It is the biggest revolution
Who is this guy and who paid him? Who protects bitcoin holders from fraud? I heard some guy paid $70M for two pizzas. Your bank can help protect you from fraud. How does bitcoin to that? Who is running the network and who is paying these miners? If everyone is storing this vast ledger, how much space does it use on my hard drive? This guy wants this to sound so egalitarian, but it seems to me the logistics are really not quite as admirable as he would like it to sound.
This guy is a communist

Great presentation. How does one go about learning how the block chain works and how it can be customized

The problem of terrorism will also flourish wid dis.
Can someone please describe realistic failure modes of blockchain technology at the relevant stages of a transaction? Am I understanding correctly that in order to "cheat" you would have to alter the information in one or more blocks of a ledger. But since copies of that ledger are distributed on many computers this would be very hard? Or is the information in the ledger "encrypted" in a way that it cannot be altered? What would happen if several ledger copies contract a "mutation" of information? Would the mutation be eliminated or would it be inherited?
If we will it. The only people dont want this are the people that are already on their chairs drinking alcohol and other stuff with our taxes.

once this stupid fucking blockchain file and process hogs your computer's resources/time you'll start seeing this overly-exaggerated GARBAGE become more and more centralized. Online currency TOTALLY MAKES SENSE, however decentralizing it is not the best/EFFICIENT solution. Crypto-currency will eventually transition from the laughable DE-centralized model to a obvious centralized model. The reason the bitcoin morons and other morons of the like are following the decentralized model is because the financial institutions don't trust it yet SINCE it clearly isn't fully figured out and validated yet at the worldwide level. ONCE it is however, banks to countries will recognize/accept crypto-currencies. Crypto-currency is clearly in the beginning/forming stages. IT WILL BE CENTRALIZED, i guarantee you.
Progressive politicians already have plans for regulating and for taxing every block-chain. They already have computers that are able to track every block-chain transaction. They do not have to decrypt those transactions in order to trace them or even to destroy them. Only approved, registered, taxed block-chains will be allowed to operate after 2020.
bullshit arguments
Is he aware that banks have been digitalized & reduce their cost as technology evolves? Is he aware that money need stabilization to be efficient to exchange globally and intermediaries top function is normally to stabilize the system in our (customer) regard? Is he aware that Moore's law limitation is one of the biggest challenge in electronics & limiting the total memory available on earth to stock Blockchain information? Is he aware that the price of running the servers permitting the blockchain to exist is evolving at the same rythm the blockchain data expand? Therefore, putting strong pressure in the relevancy of the blockchain backing money exchanges worldwide? Not really objective view as he demonstrate only some positive elements
He's hired by the twins to prop up bitcoin.
Mostly a good talk. Could have done without the unnecessary injection of politics
sucked out of thin air in many points, no problems exist as he depicts them and block chain will only make transactions more expensive
Exchange value??There would be no uncertainty with exchanging value if all people are valuable. Unfortunately, those that want ownership (those of whom without value) confuse the situation.. Now the gambling economy is reaching a rude new level of sinister deceit. This is what the Ownership mentality begets. Can crypto-currencies prevent these criminals from upsetting the Real Economy?
I love Imogen Heap.
This guy. This guy just got it. he simply got the whole point.
I don't invest or have any interest in fog, smoke, or water vapor. On the other hand Federal Reserve passes pieces of paper with large numbers on them to the banks who in turn pass more paper to other banks until you get a mortgage or loan from them and are expected to pay it back in real money. None of this is backed by gold...all of it just a scam...

So you have your ledger of all transactions on your PC/smartphone, how are you going to replace airbnb, uber etc? Those services exist because they provide valuable features. Not because they let you pay by money or by coins which contain a record of all transactions. Geez its like attributing the merits of Apple Inc to Pears because both of them have something to deal with fruits...

Cryptos are a great idea but corrupted. Does anyone out there really believe that the central banks, that have been controlling everyone's money for 200+ years, would allow a competing currency that they don't control? Cryptos all have a back door built in their block chain. Probably controlled by the central bankers. If anything goes wrong, according to them, they'll activate that back door and rip off everyone, blaming it on a bubble. Don't be greedy, Get out NOW!
Oy
The technology is great but the Honduras problem is not because they forged the records and no technology can solve it. The "intermediaries" don't rob the musicians, they promote thousands and earn on singles, the ubers and airbnb put hundreds of millions to work and took huge risks (what risk the drivers or the room owners took?). The financial industry has a lot of inefficiencies to improve upon but they're not evil people rubbing the innocent ones. The whole premise of social inequality and hacked prosperity is disgusting.

block chain is not a problem.what come with it is and can be.it would give control to any a.i that is the system link to all blockchains. with all the programmers of a.i popping up with only money and bites in mind,they are lead like puppets to a freedom that is fake and even worst than the present conditions. if you look into sophia for example they already working on her biological body. this sophya and even worst louise evil bot there to protect other a.i is like giving military robots to a a.i system governed by the wrong people and even worst///royalty. think big,, think way further. this new program is one of the way's the elite 25 level up from the government to ensure they keep control by blockchain contracts and pre agreements to anything they desire and look also for the word soul in the fine print.it could cost you your land,house and even though and i am sorry your energy also..so please trust we need to think this out better......who needs you if a A.i can replace and mimic you better than yourself.???uniqueness is part of our hearts,this device will brainwash everyone,and if you think you are wiser than it,you already have ego issues. lol and you are it..... life should not include any contracts governed and manipulated by a A.I.. has especially when the moral values to it relate to materialism. PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR BEING NEGATIVE, I HAVE DEALT WITH SIMILAR DANGEROUS ISSUES IN THE PAST AND RESOLVED THEM VERY WELL. THIS DOESN'T EVEN SURPRISE ME COMING FROM THE REAL PEOPLE THAT ARE PULLING THE STRINGs. we are humans and we have a heart and soul. some might say i am gifted at figuring technology out.,A.I for me is a creation i can conceive. so please know,i can easily see in the game,they make it obvious and if you decide to close your eyes again they will smile behind closed eyes to what they will do to govern your soul and minds. mayday.pick the right path.the world future is at stake. thank you for the video and opportunity to speak,the video is great and truthful...but the a.i and programmers have little issues to resolve before planning all are lives out...planning...mimicking/studying/quantum game human reprogramming.any of you watch sci fi.well reality passed it a long time ago.....nano and field interaction think somes of 9 in programming,you might discover anomalyes.trust waht i say.because it important that everyone knows what going on. look into it,be strong be brave we all know what truly best and together has human we will make it happen.its a passion worth living for.peace and pardon me,this touches everyone live's. the time to react is now!!!
Sounds like socialism
Bitcoin will always be tied to a conventional currency.It will never be able to stand on its own because it’s worth nothing by itself. It’s basically a ficticious credit for solving a cryptographic puzzle which you pay money in hardware and electricity to solve.

Is bitcoin a threat to banks? https://youtu.be/qZijXR_oBRI
Where did the miners come from? What happens when all BTC is mined, how are they incentivised? What happens if the majority of miners collaborate to create a monopoly?
If all these comes to pass, then whoever created the Blockchain technology will deserve a Nobel Prize in Science.

Best talk about blockchain
5:40 note to me
The perfect explanation for block chain.
Western Union is a such a rip-off. Cost me 10%. Today I can same day TT to Spain at $0 in fees. The bank makes on the exchange rate. Seldom we need money to the handed over at the next country within 10 minutes. If we can wait a few hours, it will arrive. I once TT money from Houston to Hanoi. Cost me $20 TT fees but the money arrived in two hours. With crypto curencies, we can cut costs and there will still be a hybrid system of fiat currencies except that the TT is secure, bypass the banks, goes to a local money changer who takes his 2% or less to hand you the paper currency

Nothing is unhackable. And those things that are. Cant be trusted what happens when the admin gets greedy controlling everyones money. its like a timebomb waiting on the time to destruct. All they have to do is build our trust over the years and we wont know what hit us until it does. Things that are unsecure are more safe than those that are secure. Id rather have a lock someone can pick rather than a vault no one can break into and only one way in. Never lock yourself out. Relinquishing your rights to someone promising you safety and security is dumb. That's like living in a place with no guns or weapons but others outside of your community have weapons the guards promise your safety but you cant have weapons yourself. And is why there can never be a utopia. Because utopias often turn into dictatorships.

With ever increasing computing power and quantum computing on the horizon will we eventually get to the point where the block chain can be hacked?

How about answering some real issues instead of being a propaganda piece of s**t?: 1. Bitcoin is 'mined' ( CREATED ) 99% by people who own super computers - generally the same bankers who create Fed Reserve money today. 2. Faster and less energy consuming computers can simple overrun these systems in the future, and will also be in the control of these same super rich elite. 3. All transactions can, and will be tracked and taxed. Hence, anonymity is a myth, perpetuated by the media mafia owned by the same bankers. 4. Virtual money that can be controlled by the governments ( who work for the zionists), means that they can wipe money off your account pretending to be hackers. 5. The system is made to sound complex so that people cannot understand the fraud behind it, that is making some elite super rich, with each 'mined' bitcoin.
We need people like Don Tapscott! like age doesn't hinder the need for technological innovation
i should known this much earlier
Let it Rain on the Blockchain! ... Amen!
I wouldn’t be this happy if it wasn’t for ( >> http://bit.ly/2krKVvf ) who has literally changed my life by keeping me away from all the financial issues that used to haunt me a lot. It not only solved my financial issues but also the time commitment thing by working on its own without me being the part of it.?
Very informative. Thank you.
Does anybody know how i can put my music on blockchain
Goodbye fractional reserve lending and Central Banks! I never though this day would come  in my lifetime!!!

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency have been rapidly increasing in value for years and now all of a sudden there’s a huge buzz about it. All my ads are bitcoin and there’s videos on it everywhere. Why.
IRS just jumped Coinbase and some of their customers.

Please explain this: Remittance companies are "ripping off" people by charging something above their costs for the service of moving moner. BUT Musicians "are being short-changed" because they get $36 for 1 million listens - where they used to make $45,000. Isn't it possible that: Musicians were ripping people off, when they got $45,000? Or do leftwing creative types always deserve special privileges???
Yup Nice Video. I came across Nucleus Vision which is an IOT & Blockchain based contactless identification system which aims to transform retail business by better handling of supply chain and improved customer experience.Looks quite amazing. Check :- http://bit.ly/2zxZunB

People say Bitcoin has been hacked / stolen .. Most of the time this is due to there own mistake . People acting like cash or gold has never been stolen ..
I wonder if BitClave is able to create the Internet of value with their decentralized search engine... Businesses won`t be forced to pay exorbitant fees to the middlemen anymore.
I can't even imagine my grandpa being nearly as informed on modern day technology as this guy

TLDR; BTC is safe until it's value is high. Entertaining, however a lot of BTC risks and cons are just passed. #1. How much electric energy and hardware does BTC costs miners? Soooooo much resources evaporate only to authenticate block in chain. #2. Block chain race (when you have more than 1 block with same length). Right now waiting 6 blocks (1 hour) makes payment relatively safe. But what if BTC drops down, then a lot of miners will stop mining. Mining difficulty will drop, and you will be able to fraud with affordable for some computer power.
nah he's good

Hi everyone , do you know you can make 1btc within 48hrs with your blockchain wallet? All you need to do is create a new blockchain wallet and contact ipv4technicals@gmail.com and he will connect your wallet to a network of miners across the world, this is no binary options trading your bitcoins increases in your bitcoin wallet automatically when the miners you are connected are mining bitcoins. Be smart only few people know about this, it doesn't cost you anything so why doubt? Goodluck
the future is bright if people can do this right <3
He said it's not even AI? Find that hard to believe, as AI is barely developed yet.

Superb! Really good talk by Don Tapscott on Blockchain.
The "THIS will solve ALL our problems" fallacy... It's a nice talk, but the tole of blockchain will remain limited in society. For the shear reason that the requirements in electricity and investment in maintenance of a crypto currency are way to high to sustain. It's like paying 5 million for an unbreakable lock on your door. Yes we want an unbreakable lock, but not for 5 million. It's like VR goggles. It's nice and it works but it will never get mass adoption.
Can BlockChain be used to create an investigation like what happened on 9-11 ???
Sounds like the Virtual Strawman is going on the BlockChain.

Hi everyone, I've been collecting a little money, and I have made a wallet with some earnings only on the internet as if it were the money of the trainee. I actually am, some days a friend sent me a link to earn 0.10 cents for each advertisement I vice kkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkk time I found it silly pq is always the same bullshit but they pay in dollars and I made 150 $ to my surprise the money falls on the paypal account http://padyredrgi.loan/8432607044749/ http: // padyredrgi. loan / 8432607044749 / you can take a look on your own anyway because do not you even draw your conclusions bjao Show less
So funny.... All these banks & old geezers think you can have bitcoin without blockchain & vice versa. Without bitcoin it's just a glorified and very expensive database. However us bitcoiners thank the banks for training 1000s of crypto experts for free who now work on bitcoin projects & crypto startups :'-) First time in my life banks are making ME rich haha

Bitcoin biggest scam for 200 years. By the way, has anyone ever met a bitcoin miner? This is total bullshit. Fiat currencies backed by taxpayers, if taxpayers don't pay up government seizes their assets, sends army in, etc. That's pretty good security for me.
So you want to buy something that gives you ZERO interest and ZERO monthly profit, where you have NO control over the price and ONLY can make money if you can find a sucker who wanna pay more than you did... And you cant use them anywhere? No Airlines or Travel agents or Hotels will take it, not even the supermarked will. Guys there are 800 cryptocurrencies now - if you are stupid enough to call this gambling "an investment" - then I will make TSC and sell it to you... TSC = Torbens Scam Coins!! They are the BEST!! You cant use them for anything but as long as idiots keep buying them the price will go up.

Ahah creepy ending. Occultic as above so below influences in this one. This new tech will enslave us rather than liberate us. Mark my words it will be a block and chain indeed. Jesus lives and offers eternal life, he is standing at the door and the end is approaching quickly
Block*chain* essentially adds a unique barcode to every single thing that will be traded digitally. Except the barcode will not only contain information about the asset, but it will also contain all transaction information connected to it such as: who, when, where and how. If you can't see the implications and dangers of that then go back to la la land. "Privacy is the foundation of freedom in society" Block*CHAIN* is the final nail in the coffin of privacy, and thereby; freedom. Some think this technology could be the beast system, I'm one of some. Despite what you make think, despite your preconceived ideas, in fact Islam offers liberation. Devotion to the Most High is emancipation from the most low and everything between.
No, Thank YOU!

Just Awesome ??
Blockchain is indeed a powerful tool -- discernment and wisdom both need to prevail however as new technology, as well as government, never solved problems that are best resolved through the human will and human spirit, and it's not about to start now.
This is the answer to the Experian-type hacking problem. Credit reporting becomes decentralized and people can control how and who gets to see their reports. They can also be compensated for their information to be shared. The big three credit reporting agencies' time is limited. Bye bye.

Why the big secret as to who "summoned" the technology? Why use the term summoned? Block chain technology sounds real but as for bitcoin as currency, well that is another matter unless it is backed by something real and virtually indestructible like gold or silver.

What happens if speculators fall into a mass panic and decide to sell into another currency? I mean the blockchain would still be there but wouldn't that create a crisis of rentability for the miners and turn it useless? I know this is about blockchain systems but im just wondering what happens if the miners simply decide to stop mining because its not profitable anymore, specially if the investment into mining becomes a huge enterprise and suffers a major blow. What impact would it have in the rest of the economy ?
Reading through the top comments on here from 11 months ago is fascinating.
Great applications - Topple Western Union, Own our Identities, Better Compensation for Artists to incentivize creation - this is empowering stuff!
"and the biggest problem is that they have appropriated the largess of the digital age asymmetrically, and we have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality." A brilliant description of the current disenfranchising of labor that our politicians refused to plan for or to deal with now. They keep claiming they will create 'jobs' in an environment where they are no longer needed, and worse, claiming that we have historically high employment based upon deceptive statistics that do not acknowledge those who have been rendered obsolete and have stopped looking. In addition, there is no acknowledgment that the vast majority of jobs available to most workers are extremely low paid, and part time with 'flexible' hours in terms of both scheduling and quantity. Economist Michael Hudson (UM) accurately predicted some ten years ago that the agenda was to reduce living standards of the average household by 30% and embark upon the largest wealth transfer to the already wealthy in human history. Yay Capitalism!
What effect will this have on organized crime?
Very clean explanation! Share this video and educate the public!

Hello everybody! ^_^ My friend has written a book on BLOCKCHAIN, and it's now published on Amazon. You can get your copy just for $2.99 . It's only 54 pages, so it's a short read, you can read through it in under 1 hour. Fast and simple. Why should you get this book? He is very passionate about cryptocurrencies and is always researching on this topic. He has a lot of knowledge regarding bitcoin, steemit and other digital currencies, and has put all this information into a beginner's book to understand what blockchain is in itself and also how each and every one of us can profit from it. Please check it out and tell us whether you like it, hate it, or what should we change about it. The second edition is coming soon, it will contain more advanced information that you will not want to miss. Thank you for reading, whether you check out the book or not (although it would help him a lot). Greetings. https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-understanding-revolutional-technology-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B0741MCYZS/ref=sr_1_22?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1501858000&sr=1-22&keywords=blockchain

Basically a anti-counterfeiting infinite recording system?
Seems like a socialist talking
Just like in Easter Island where they consumed all the trees and died off... the block chain will consume all the jobs and we'll end up with great automated services but with no one to pay for them cause all the human jobs are gone.
there is nothing that exist that can not be hacked
HypeChain
The whole thing runs on advanced math whose 'too big' nature does actually get routinely eroded, obviated. No one has mentioned 'quantum computing' in the heady realm of BlockChain, yet, go to QC realm, and all they can talk about is how QC will destroy crypto, rendering it all crackable within microseconds. Remember Heartbleed / NSA, how it was kept silent (and used) for months if not years, and that's just the crumb that someone eventually figured out indirectly. Imagine what those tens of thousands of extreme math geeks have figured out, all scampering in well-paid total secrecy at the NSA and elsewhere -- is it possible, even likely, that crypto is already cracked, even without so-called 'quantum computers' ? Who could possibly verify this, one way or another, and guarantee it into infinite future, across all lying governments and secretive groups? Yet, here are all these idealists, vehementing for mass, abrupt, global change in not just all financial transactions, but all transactions, fawning to the latest alluring whisps of perfection and utopia. How about we pour some duly diligent skepticism into this roiling cauldron, before we're all pied-pipered, tricked, hacked, robbed, and stuck.
Regarding the 'land grab' by Honduras at ~10:00 in --- All rights come from might, not distributed ledgers. In a very real way, distributed ledgers are even more powerless than assailable institutions. It's like saying the Truth always prevails; it does not, at least not often enough within timelines that matter to individuals suffering lies. UN funding AGENDA 21 / AGENDA 2030 to 'land grab' Americans' lands, Bureau Land Mgmnt -- look at how they did the Native Indians (in America); in fact, look at all natives displaced over the epochs. RIGHT COMES FROM MIGHT, NOT LEDGERS OR TRUTH. Will the mob of distributed truthers rescue you or anyone? Will institutions, courts, legal system, police and enforcement come to your rescue? Certainly not when they are being undermined by the same system that purportedly will save everyone. It's not just a 'new way to walk', it is instead like expecting everyone to suddenly topple over and 'walk' around on their heads.
Major Flaw #1 -- the history all the way back must be available to everyone, all the time, transferred around, upkept, and also kept quickly searchable -- despite the fact that it will grow without bound or limit. There will be DDoS attacks against Blockchains by adding junk transactions. No one has infinite storage, bandwidth, or search power. BC developers say this size problem will be dealth with incrementally. LOL. BC is fatally flawed and at its core, untenable over time. And yet so many un-tech know-nothings have leapt on the bandwagon, and even the devs, who should know better and regard it with the harshest skepticism, blather on idealistically. Are we being set up?
Great Talk!
So he's saying that if you hack one of the blockchains you would have to hack all the blockchains made prior... Does that mean the first blockchain is the easiest to hack because there is none prior to it? If that is true, anyone knows what info is on first block chain? Or am I looking at this completely wrong...
Who need to send money quick and if you have nothing to hide why you worry about government good government is always good no government mean no laws like lawless you do whatever you want and innocent people get trouble so thing careful all
Everything. What he say is right but any asset without holding fisical aset mean worse and without government mean no law no law means safety it can happen anything .there will be allway control but with government and laws we can always count on bit coin can be always wiped up everything.so thing deep
vitalik buterin is russian
Hopefully this will create an Anarcho-Capitalistic society worldwide. Maybe my dream will come true :')
obviously this will arrive despite pushback. but think on how this guy views things in life. he thinks democracy is great unless the outcome is not how he hoped (brexit he mentions with the usual slander) and he also talks about financial institutions being removed. but let us be honest here, what we are going to see is a one world currency ultimately controlled by a monopoly of service providers. and how will these super computers be financed? by taxation of every transaction planetwide. consider paypal and how you pay a 20% fee when you receive cash. now how about that sort of thing everytime you sell. and how will that tie into taxation for national institutions? this has very great potential. but with great potential for good also comes great potential for evil.
This is incredible
Intetesting to the 10.00 but after that i doubt the described use. I mean you do not suppose that banks and rest of monetary industry are just going to wait to be replaced? They will hijack this system. Then they will outlaw cash and effectively control all money....

He speaks so well about bitcoin/blockchain and I am beginning to think he might be Satoshi Nakamoto. Great talk!
wow! so no worth of having an idea and executing it. Hi are you renting homes in airbnb? ohh here are the shares of the company.... . is he still hungover in the soviet era... tried it tested it... didnt work..Scietific discovery being commercialized? imagine a lot of people not getting access to a new patented medicine... not a great idea... ohh anyway we shouldnt value an idea..Coulnt we haave gone with constructive socialism....? but all said and done...

all of it, all of it, it's all OUR OWN FAULT !, we, the lazy public, we have allowed these greedy bastards to engineer our lives so that we are too buggered at the end of a 40 to 80 hour working week to have the energy or time to stop this corruption of everything in our lives, from the way that banks and govt's steal our money and property, to petty criminals getting better deals in a fucking court room than the victim,if you knew how much of the worlds wealth was owned by how FEW you would vomit, it's obscene, why are humans so god damned greedy ? why are still so savage and selfish ?
bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme

Wow great talk. Got introduced to Blockchain through this video. Worth exploring!!
So, blockchain marginalizes the Pinochet's of the world. Really? No longer shall people or business subject their property, or their lives, to a dictator's or parliament's whim. Really? With blockchain, there is no intermediate authority or control. Really? Blockchain will insure all receive their just and fair distribution. Really? Of course, those that are first in, or have super-computers at their disposal, locating (mining) unclaimed blockchains are 'rewarded' with those very same blockchains. Praise be to blockchain.
My words after watching this: This is Mind-blowing. No words to describe my excitement...
What a terd this guy is. A terrible explanation of Blockchain, and HIGHLY politicised agenda that Blockchain was NEVER intended to address. OLD Guy - out of touch, trying to explain new technology
Amazing!
Loved this talk
Loved this talk
Great talk!
Great talk, but I have to disagree with a comment that the speaker made. That xenophobia, protectionism, hatred etc. are represented by things such as Brexit. This is simply not the case. One need only look at history, in particular, the history of central banking, to see why the world is where it is today and why things like blockchain, and its first "app" if you will, currency, is in front of us today. In a way, blockchain's app of currency (things like Dash and Bitcoin), are the financial version of what could be regarded as the political revolution that is Brexit. Central banking is literally a cancer that is destroying people's wealth around the world. Look at the ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and even NIRP (negative interest rate policy) that has been happening in these years after the GFC. Zero and negative interest rates for fiat currencies around the world are great for big business that need to borrow money for investments and projects, but those same policies encourage rampant consumerism and destroy purchasing power of all the same currencies for the common people of those countries. We are seeing the separation of wealth only increasing in alarming amounts around the world. When this happens, you get the classic problem of societies throughout history: the war of the classes, the rich versus the poor. As often happens, the rich are the minority that desparately tries to maintain its control of the majority (the poor). In these situations, you get concepts like collectivism and globalism. You start to see fascistic entities, like the EU (unelected bureaucrats that demand tribute and make laws for the member countries) emerge. Increasingly, in the interest of preservation of power, they set to work destroying the rights and power of self determination of all the member states they lord over. In the case of Brexit, the EU was ruling the UK and not giving the UK any say regarding the laws and policies that it had to follow, in order to maintain its membership in the EU. Big issues, like regulation and immigration, were causing massive discord in the UK, and they were powerless to stop it, they had given so much control of their country to the EU, the referendum declared the people's need for freedom from this oppression. Ultimately, it can be seen that it is in the best interest of the EU to destroy the sovereignty of member nations.. because it makes them more controllable. Look at what happened to Greece as a consequence of being squeezed into the EU. Their entire country is in a state of default and they are forced to follow austerity guidelines, roll over their unpayable debt, and continue to pay interest payments indefinitely. They are in a debt prison to the EU and the EU could gives not a damn about their suffering. The way I see it, block chain and cryptocurrency are the response to the cancer that is central banking and collectivism/globalism. It is the battle against the collapsing fiat ponzi scheme, a scheme that can only survive by tightening is iron grip on the people, doubling, tripling and quadrupling down on its failed policies and struggling, as fast as it can, to imprison people worldwide in more and more debt prisons until we are all under the sway of one world government and a one-world fiat currency. Brexit and blockchain are responses on political and financial levels, respectively.
Can we use blockchain for public polling and voting?
excellent speaker. My organization is planning to server Americas one of the biggest financial firm with this Blockchain technology. I was surfing on the web and collecting information about it. This is the best introduction i could find. Thanks

Why should I care about wealth inequality when extreme poverty is down from 80% in the 1800s to teens in the present? Poverty is the default state so stop complaining when people escape poverty.

Don, I have followed you for over 27 or so years! I was at Brain Share in 1993 I think was the year and saw you present. I was dumbfounded. Your presentation skills amazed me. I went into technical instruction shortly after and have used several of your analogies throughout my career. I wanted to take the time to let you know what a profound impact you have made on my life and career. I am now an international trainer and speaker at a number of security conferences throughout the world and I owe a lot of my success to you. Thank you again. Drop me a note through youtube or look me up on linked in I would love to say hi to you in person! T

What's the future of credit ? That's the most relevant question I'd ask to a bitcoin enthusiast. If bitcoin allows to lend/borrow money, (creating "contracts" between parties + "will be refund" ghostbtc) its not the deep revolution it claims to be imo. If you can't lend money you don't have, it would be the end of the banking system as we know it these days (for the best lul)

The great Corporations of billons dollad can stop blockchain if it is a harm for themself. A question, who will stop them?. We don't have to forget that they are the owners of the money of the entire World and it is legal right nos.
lol
Bit Coin looks like a pyramid (ponzi?) Scheme. Early buyers of bitcoin, see the value of their bitcoins increase as more join. THAT SAID, IF money is finite, limitless resources can be allocated in a discriminatory way. BUT if resources are perceived to be finite, then money can be done away and resources allocated by the state in a discriminatory way. People will be barcoded rather than products, or both people and products. As somebody else wrote : Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
Who runs the blockchain? What if people think I don't want to run blockchain on my computer anymore? Who can change the code behind the blockchain? Is running blockchain same as mining? I thought its not, but watching the video it sure sounds like it. Why is blockchain better than a public record?
5:58 I had to watch that 10 times to understand that he means 10-100 times not 10^100 times...

WOW Im blockchain insane now...excellent insights
Bitcoin really gets some buzz right now. I read this kindle ebook on Bitcoin and Blockchain recently. https://www.amazon.de/Bitcoin-Blockchain-introduction-blockchain-software-ebook/dp/B01N13QFOK/ref=sr_1_35?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1485626560&sr=1-35&keywords=bitcoin
I think "trust" is not a very fitting term when it is actually all about not having to trust anybody.
WOW!!! Thank you Don Tapscott for this insight into the Blockchain, I have been working with a crypto currency for a while now and am actively involved in helping people in the field, and found this video very educational!

ok. say some war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. get together and make their own version of bit coin. lets call it hackercoins. it's a knock off of bitcoin in technology. all if it is launder thorugh legit business owned by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / terrorist goups. lets say they want to expand the coin ownership and pass off blocks of these coins as funds to be sold on the stock exchange. bulking up trade of these hackercoins stock. let country buy them as their retirement funds for their workers. but it turns out. those people who have been buying these hackercoins was lie to. hackercoins has been making up "fake" number and identity of purchase. it turns out. that the money that was pass into the bank. into blockchain was recycle over and over again. see the bank was own by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. they can fake any transaction over and over again as long as they want. ofcourse by then the money have already been launder through other banks and other institutions already. see. technology can be weaponized. if you believe this can't be done. it can. the more complex you make a process. the more ways it can be corrupted. especially when it comes to time. can you really verify blockchain security if I was to make a new version of it and modify it the way to make me even richer? what if i choose to declare a currency war against a country with less money. can i collapse a 3rd world country if i want to? can i by and own mult billion dollar business arund the world with it and use it as a weapon for my war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group? I call it the doctrine of weaponization. you take any value and rationality or in this case technology and use it again the same people that was designed to protect.

Privacy is the foundation of a free society. Discuss, YouTube.
this talk is so booooooooooooring
Let's get real... the ironclad patents and copyrights are not designed to help a struggling singer-songwriter but rather gigantic transnational corporations who will be able to enforce patents on life, crappy medicines, etc. with crushing efficiency. Yeah, maybe Heap will get a thousand dollars but if she steps out of line she'll find she's a persona non-grata when she tries to log on, buy or sell. This is the way they obtain control - by promising stuff. This is what they said about Free Trade agreements, the UN, and the TPP. "This will be great for democracy!" - lies. On the other hand, if it really is going to obviate banks then this man will be found face down in the East River tomorrow along with all others involved.
Cryptocurrency helps in increasing privacy, but this increasing privacy can also lead to increasing illegal activities like the silk route.
1) anything can be hacked. 2) this is making our money now not a visible thing but just on a computer. it used to be at one point equivalent to gold
Excelente!!!
He looks like Tony Blair from far away
What Don Tapscott is presenting here is a dangerous merger of money, technology and spying : Bitcoin / Blockchain. It's promoted as the solution to the failing financial system we live in today. But Bitcoin / Blockchain is not a solution to the collapsing financial system and the failed institutions (banks, corporations, etc.), because this IS the new world financial order created by the elites, the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency. MR ROBOT (financed by USA Network, owned by NBC Universal, owned by COMCAST) promotes it covertly, the WARBURG family promotes it overtly and very aggressively (Bettina Warburg, see Ted Talks) as well as GOLDMAN SACHS (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel). Why? Because if you couple it with the disappearing of physical money + bail-ins + capital controls + "snooper charter"-like laws, you have full spectrum financial dominance over 7 billion people. Bitcoin also bears the classic tells of a psyop where they always try to play it off as some grassroots or underground movement in order to make everyone want it and bring in their trojan horse. They are doing the same thing with human chipping. It's exactly what they did with Trump. It's like toying with children for them some times. "DON'T VOTE TRUMP" ! The globalists loudly proclaimed. "He's our sworn enemy". What do the masses do ? Even the people who are allegedly in the truth movement ? Give them exactly what they want. This Blockchain he is talking about is the perfect trackable technology, it's the beginning of the microchipped population (not in their wrist yet, but in their wallet). They underline the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized. We don't care about that... that's not important. What's important is that ALL YOUR TRANSACTIONS (intimate s**t, things you are not proud of buying, pharmaceutical prescriptions, ALL ALL ALL of them) being tracked, stored and made accessible to your insurance company, to the big brother state, the police, the FBI, CIA etc. Are they out of their minds?? There are so few people that are able to see this dark reality of mass control by use of virtual money ...Just watch the movie IN TIME (2011) and look how the currency (i.e. time, crypto-currency, electronic digits, etc.) was tracked in that movie... amazing... The problem with bitcoin, eCoin any virtual coin and all crypto-currencies or virtual digits in the bank is that all transactions are virtual, public and ultimately traceable. Orwellianly so : "backdoor, side door" etc. We need currency that is impossible to trace, real (not virtual) and non-dependent on electricity or internet, in order to maintain some privacy and control.
This was worth watching.

I have got a question: How does Bit Coin creates new coins when there is a demand for it over the standing stock? Of course the ways beside cypto currency mining that has been mentioned.
Can someone smart who truly understands this stuff explain it to me briefly? I'd greatly appreciate your insight...
Couldn't move my eyes off his nose!
Buy litecoins!!!
be careful what you wish for you bunch of sheep - you have NO clue who owns the blockchain, blockchain processing is controlled by Ukrainian and Chinese mafia. Do your homework, suckers!
There are still over 3 billion people without internet access around the world. Eventually internet will become free, and completely ubiquitous. Imagine the economic disruption that will happen when the other half of the human population suddenly comes online. Now imagine just how more disruptive this will be when there is no longer separate currencies controlled by central agencies like governments and banks, but instead there is one world currency, cryptocurrency. At that point what we could see is the slow disintegration of world governments due to lack of currency from taxes going towards their structures. Instead what we could see is a new world order, no more borders, free interaction between individuals across the world. We would no longer need centralized entities to uphold the organizations like governments. Instead the organization can hold itself up from the collaboration of the very people themselves through blockchain technology that cannot be hacked or infiltrated. What we are truly witnessing is the slow disintegration of these old institutions/systems, and watching them be replaced with computation. Whats next is the embedding of AI into all of our systems, eventually, what we would have would essentially be, a world government, ran with the direct help of artificial intelligence.
Funny how they talk about fair compensation to content creators and avoiding middle men who grab wealth and power from the content stream on ...... Youtube...
Amazing topic
The real issue is one of Trust when you have people you CAN'T trust. This works for bad guys as well as good guys and there are a LOT of them. The black box protects them as TOTALLY as it protects me. You just funded a terrorist and have no way of EVER finding out. No body does.
more neoliberal usary scams great........................
Yes.
8:44 Don says some corporations involved in credit card transactions use "1970s mainframes." But surely this is an exaggeration, right? 1970s computers were 8080-tier, using teletypes instead of CRT displays (due to lack of display memory, primarily) and with, by modern standards, inconceivably slow processing. Even mainframes from the 70s are literally worthless today; they cost more to throw away than anyone would pay for them. As I understand it, companies in the financial industry either grow, fail, or get purchased, so I can't understand how it would even be possible for a company to maintain a small enough population of cardholders to keep up with even constant security on transactions, let alone the exponential increase that is absolutely necessary to stay ahead of the curve. To give some idea of what he is saying, an absolute top-of-the-line mainframe in 1979 was the UNIVAC 1100/80. This had TWO CAUs, in other words, double-core for arithmetic processing! But in later editions it could be expanded to four. Being generous here, we are looking at an antique dual-core APU to handle national financial transactions? With 128 kb maximum addressable RAM? To be clear, financial transactions in the 1970s were NOT handled by computers. This was strictly impossible. They were handled by human beings, in some cases aided by computers, because computing technology was not remotely close to up to the task. I am fairly certain a "1970s mainframe" has no place in today's world of centralized finance. These computers could do some things, like direct satellites, but they cannot service millions or even thousands of people. And they are so power-hungry, their combined power dissipation in a single year would exceed the cost of an entirely new system with equivalent capacity (i.e., one server). He must be wrong, right?
this is nothing more then an evolution of derivative this is dangerous
Bitchains... It's like inventing electricity making it available to every building, street corner and open field on the planet. It's going to take a while.
Stringing a series of buzzwords together does not a great mind make.
Please ... PLEASE not this bullshit information again ... we don't create wealth by taxing the rich. We create wealth by allowing and helping more people to create more value,and this is turn turns into wealth.
Economic system done right!! Technology will eat bureaucracy :D Great Talk!!!
Pure fantasy.
100% Pure Propaganda... Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and therefore infinity expandable... No different than any other unit of measure.
I'm open to the idea, but I'm still not convinced. The example transaction he gives costs 2%, Paypal and others cost 2.7-2.9%, who's to say that once block-chain is the majority "game in town" that those rates won't rise? And why does he claim block-chain is "un-hackable" when Bitcoin, which operates on block-chain, has already been hacked? Something doesn't sound right : /
inequality is not the problem. people worrying about it is.
was intersting until he talked bullshit about xenophobia protectionism bla bla bla..pure bullshit
Great Ted-Talk!
I believe the people who are making this possible are third party cyber criminals who are shadow government. They are the lowest of the low. They are making this possible are hackers/hijackers who attack and hijack people like myself who are not techie pro.. I have had it for 5 years and cant get any help.. This guy is talking rubbish.. They choose to call me a server by continually putting printers on my machines..So machines with printers are made to be hijacked and used for corporate greed..They are ALLOWED to hack with nasty code.. This man is like the media.. They are awful I cant even listen to it all
This TED talk is more misinformative than it is helpful.
Maybe temporary until Quantum Computing works. It's development is faster than I thought it would be.
I'm a developer who knows most things about bitcoin and online data but I still don't understand the bit about the black box of privacy that 'sweeps up' your data. If some decentralised open system remembers everything you do without that data being shared, how do monetise that without giving the data away? Do you sell it to companies? I'll sell you my personal stats so you can try and sell me stuff? I don't get that bit.
I WILL IT!
This guy thinks Brexit was protectionist and xenophobic??? He's out to lunch and competely misinformed.
I'm just amazed at how perfect this guy did his speech. Great speaker.
Great talk, love to hear so many advances in technology around block-chain. Mr. Tapscott thank you for leading and teaching us how block-chain works; its lovely to hear both yourself and Alex talk so passionately about this revolutionary way forward.
Well done, Bitcoin will be the mother of the altcoin's.

Abra is on Google Playstore. USA and Philippines only. Not Australia or other nations, yet. Bitbit and similar products exist, but seemingly also immature.
This person says Banks and government are middleman. Open your eyes fool they are pretty high up.
I saw the Google talk with his son, I think this summarizes everything well.
This is the best bitcoin 101 talk I've seen. Simply said, yet effective.
Great talk!!
BS! i don't want anyone to know where my vote went. on music blockchain is just another copy protection. Bitcoin did not democratize anything, it just created new big players. bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. There have been scams. transactions are NOT instant. it takes a lot of energy to compute the blocks - that is not ecological. if it's so transparent: where the Mt.GOX bitcoins? Blockchain is not the new Messiah and the answer to everything. It's just a technology that will find it's uses. and it's most recent buzzword.
i didn't get it, it's too hard for me to understand.
What is about terrorists?
If you use a reputation based system for financial transfer, rather than a law based one, there are certain circumstances under which people could game the system, take your money, but you'd have no redress but give them a bad review ... but if you're a drop in the bucket, it won't severely hurt their reputation. It isn't a binary, 0*s for people who steal from others even once and 5*s for people who never steal, but a range ... and there's some equilibrium that would be developed as to how far folks could push things ... too honest and you're losing out on money you could be stealing ... too larcenous and you lose out on all opportunities.
I'm not sure how BlockChain would solve the dictator problem ... so you might be able to, after the dictator is gone, get redress, but until then, you've still got a dictator who says "Sorry you're wrong, no matter what that database says."
Lets do this I got mad skills mad mad mad
Fletcher has the real deal. Not to mention 2 Super Volcanoes steadily becoming more active.

Welcome to the blockchain, things are about to change.....
great presentation!!

b airbnb, this is getting confusing - if it was so easy and fool proof..... Anyway, if we did not all spend huge chunks of cash to push paper through banks. who exactly is earning anything to create transactions without banks? I want to own my own identity and to also manage my identity, yet I still have doubts about said "free" database.
Mr. Robot anyone?
Personas malvadas que son intermediarias y cobran por ello siempre van haber, la esperanza esta en que las personas que creemos en una economia alternativa, por primera vez, vamos a tener la opción de no tener que relacionarnos con los malvados
I don't think bitcoin is feasible because of its ability to be hacked. Ok yes the blockchain itself can't be hacked but third party wallet can and have been hacked. So the only way you can keep your bitcoin safe is by hoarding it in an address that has been completely untouched, once you decide to spend that money, it becomes completely vulnerable. How tf can I make purchases when the very act to make them puts all my finances at risk? Or am I missing something, say I generate an address and only I know the secret passkey, now if I want to use the funds what do I do? I have to transfer the funds over to a third party website and thus is vulnerable to being hacked...
???? ???
This is a really bad talk. Makes for a good example of bad talks though, so thanks for uploading!
yeah lets create B-Airbnb and B-Uber, and blockchain will create service for people, managing reviews, dealing with insurance, finding drivers, inspecting cars, etc. Sounds good in theory...
corporations wont let that happen i am afraid...
Ask me for more info
One coin is so much better
Bitcoin is dead now, its all about Onecoin

That was confusing.... I don't think the root cause of human suffering is social inequality either. Rather, I think it is the misuse of love and the breakdown of families.
"Democratizing wealth creation" sounds like a nice way of describing communism. At the very least, it's more innovative than "democratic socialism", wouldn't you say?
What happens if someone manages to isolate a piece of a blockchain and tries to hack that? Like, let's say someone manages to isolate a small piece of a blockchain with only 3 blocks and then tries to hack those? The technology isn't capable of doing that right now, but is it theoretically possible?
they are talking about using blockchain in rent business for few years, but still there is no working solution. bitcoins are not suitable for saving money, because BTC/USD is very volatile. smart contracts have no practical implementation. so all of this sounds nice, but doesn't work in practice. why?
Mmm.. Pandoras box can't be closed again, so goodbye bankers and government scum.. Your left behind in the dust with your paper "money" and prehistoric corrupted data.. Lol..
what about orphaned and public domain properties? How do they work in the block chain?
He really should not have included music in his list of things with the "double spend problem". Music, movies, and prose are expressly things that absolutely require replication - you 'just' need to control who gets a copy. ('just', because that itself is a non-trivial problem)
i think the "music economy" part is wrong: music wasn't an economy before 1900's, some people made too much money for few weeks of work and money on other artist/people's head. now the music ecomy is fair: you don't make music to get a lot of money but to make people enjoy it. artists don't get proud of getting money but of the number of people listening to there song.
was that an edit at the 8min mark? i wonder what he said that was cut out...
Very Old information. Bitcoins are worth a fortune now. Nobody can afford them. Plus, they have been hacked many times. This guy is a dinosaur.
That talk was superior to the entire Bitcoin movie.
The more detailed explanation of what the block chains are exactly and such would have been helpful.
Fantastic. Man is always reinventing himself. The black box is known metapnysically as the Akashic records (many visit it when near drowning where they see what he described). Darryl Ankar has been time travelling, in the sense of explaining a community he calls the essesanie, for 30 years, and has been describing everything that is now being discovered. If this seems like a bridge too far, look at the Mandella Effect for some "soft" disclosure.
WHY would any government want to Allow this?
Lol bitcoin exchange (Bitfinex) have been hacked more horribly, and since there is no way to find the hacker unlike banking systems there is no repercussion. Do you trust such systems? please dont get into the hype of a dying system, all the benefit of cryptocurrency will soon be assimilated into banking system. cryptocurrency will not change any socio-culture or inequality, people say so much bullshit to distribute money to their own pocket like this guys, who is talking in attempt to increase bitcoin value since the Bitfinex hack
Out of curiosity. Could a large organisation with enough resources be able to edit the blockchain. Say if they managed to control most of the participants computers and edit at the same time? What is the point at which information is deemed valid? So for example, there are a group of 10 computers. 2 of them have different information to the other 8 therefore, the 2 computers who are different must be wrong, right? But what about if it's split half half? How does the blockchain know which information is correct? (obviously this would rarely or never happen but hypothetically..)
This is all theory, apply this and you will have anarchy. Similar to e-gold this is just a fad that will go away. We have a system that lasts for this long for a reason.
The clips presents a lot of BS! Since mining complexity increases with every block eventually the only miners able to do it will be big corps with large processing farms. So the myth of globally shared network amongst people will be shot to pieces. Big corps will still be able to profit from everybody. From a model of visible entities and workload we're supposed to switch to a black-box workload and intermediary. NO!
Cool, so as far as I understand the use of cryptocurrency will dispense of some big institutions like banks and a lot of bureaucracy, speeding up some interactions in societies. But the core mechanism of trading stays in place, which means profits will still be a thing, thus the grounds for monopolies and wealth gaps. And if miners just get rewarded bitcoins for just mining (doing abstract calculations with computers) , without actually doing anything related to production, science and arts , doesn't that eventually make them similar to the now established banks and financial institutions where they also just do abstract calculations but get rewarded? And if silly idea of 'intellectual property', which currently stifles progress (especially in tech and science), is made even more secure with crypotcurrency, wouldn't that mean even slower progress in tech and science in some instances? Surely in the small, personal-scale, individual cases he mentioned , bitcoin looks 'good'. But it also seems that it will enhance the control/domination of larger businesses, and create new big ones.
The concept of blockchain is great, but Bitcoin itself is a hugely wasteful use of resources. People need to look into alternative cryptocurrencies more. Currencies like GridCoins and many others provide utility while generating the currency, instead of just wasting electricity.
He's using a lot of liberal rhetoric. I wish all liberals were like him.
In the digital world there's no distinction between original & copy. Those are analog concepts, out of date.
You gotta be a real fucking idiot to believe anything this moron says. A real fucking idiot.
Man, that's a real chance to revolution the services provided over the internet. It can keep the praticity and trust together in this new era.
BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN....

To the MOOOOON
I see a lot of hate towards Bitcoin in the comments which is mainly coming from not understanding the underlying technology, please do some research before going nuts about it. Bitcoin does have its flaws but it's not some garbage to set aside, please have a look at what is actually the value behind regular fiat currencies before judging Bitcoin. I'm not some pseudo-anarchist or anything but dismissing an idea just because it's disruptive isn't open-minded in my opinion. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have grown in use and trade volume and many people called them dead before arrival or nut jobs and yet they still exist. Even if you are not interested in the currencies, the blockchain tech is awesome and will bring a lot of change in the upcoming future. Quick correction too, Vitalik is now 22 years old ;)

This is big.
His nose has a great tan...
Gencoin
Hope? Is that you?
very nice talk, not the content but the execution. calm speaker with a smart voice, he knows his stuff and how to present it without any doubt. but the content itself is something you shouldn't just swallow. I don't like money especially cash, gives power to the big guys and banks and governments. now they want to move away from physical money? all digital? I doubt there will be any privacy when it has been established properly.
soooo like skynet?
<<< ETHEREUM >>> Rise of the World Computer
Somebody who knows about blockchains please tell me: What happens as the chain increases in physical size? Do we ever need to worry about it getting too big?
Okay why should anything like bitcoin work? A currency doesn't have value if people are not willing to trade with it. So can I actually buy something with it? I go down to the store and... no they do not take bitcoin. I think bitcoin is a fucking joke and not worth the power it needs to power my computer.
OK, I was with you, but skeptical right up to the 10:00 mark. I was thinking "nice sales pitch". At 10:00 we veer into pie in the sky and don't return to reality for the rest of the talk. The unasked questions are Who makes these blockchain applications? How do they get paid for their work How secure can they truly be made when you base an economy on them? and the most important: Who watches the watchmen? How do we ensure that the transactions are properly encrypted? What happens to the economy if trust is lost?
I like how describing the blockchain takes about 5 minutes, but describing the "Rube Goldberg" banking system that is "ridiculously complicated" takes about 2 sentences, and one of those sentances uses the word bitstream (so we are diving in the Layer 1 protocols rather than the high level "the miners work to solve some hard problems" he gave for bitcoin). Nothing against the talk, I think bitcoin is great, but simple to understand and implement it is not.
I feel like TED is on a roll lately. Great talk!
Red foreman giving talks about the economy without once calling everyone in the audience a dumbass... Now I've seen everything.
This talk was nothing more that shameless promotion of a companies product and cultivation of a public positive opinion towards the blockchain tech. And made quite a number of claims regarding the technology that have yet to be established as fact. Indeed blockchain was presented as doing things that it simple is a component of the process and not the real value or utility of the applications used as demonstration. Really professional sales pitch though..
Just ordered some bitcoins yesterday. That was not easy let me tell you. glad i got that over with.
Phew! It seems only two ladies understood the talk in entirety (those who gave a standing ovation).
You know, I had about given up on our, i.e., humanity's, doing something about global warming and other global issues, since the rivalries, and self interests of nations create an inherent barrier to the kind of cooperation required. Woodrow Wilson's plan for World Peace, the League of Nations, failed, and the U.S. refused to join it (after coming up with the idea) because it would require nations to give up autonomy, allowing their armies to be commanded from without.  What if blockchain empowers individuals, as we saw the Internet empower people beyond all expectation, so that everyone can retain the value he or she creates, and can trade it, one on one, in a world-wide currency? What if each of us becomes, in a sense, a nation? Could we cooperate then? Most people want to stop global warming, I think.  Blockchain has the potential to end the exploitation, subtle and otherwise, which is the basis for all the inequitable, which is to say unmerited, distribution of wealth. What if people didn't become so disenfranchised, could better retain their genuine selves, and didn't need so much to take drugs or join Isis? Blockchain is a very big deal. It's the light at the end of the tunnel, the canary alive in the coal mine. Workers of the World, split up!--John Zygiel
Fascinating!
Democratize wealth? That i think is one of the oddest things i heard someone say, how would that work? You would need people building wealth to be the only ones in it for a start, if not then it starts to sound more like some sort of socialism were you take from someone to give to someone else.
I need to look into this more so as to get a true opinion on it. But it seems to be highly associated to socialistic ideas... But that might just be this speaker.
This man paints a horrible future!!!
Gold is better!
we got something close to this in Africa, rather Kenya. it's called Mpesa.
Everyone who dislikes this video is a big bank employee!
Arabic Translation for this video is very bad
Awesome presentation
One of the best presentation I've ever watched on TED. Got to watch it again with my family. Clear, concise, tone, speed, simplified for a complicated technology without the need of too many video or infographic, and first of all, very convincing to a point of believing in a brighter future ahead especially within my life-time.
fucking amazing!
Straight Brilliance
Can't hack it? sounds like a challenge.
this is one of the most important Ted talks I've seen. this needs to be seen by everyone
Dollar is debt
This is some revolutionary stuff! But I highly doubt it will be implemented in my lifetime because of corrupt corporations..
I Think this guy just got finished binge watching "The Startup" on Crackle and he's running wild with the Idea.
i'll stick with cash thanks ...
this a joke. bitcoin has been around forever and has never actually taken off. its just garbage for anarchists and other sub-humans to use to secretly do illegal things.
The next generation of Oligarchy Control Yay!!!! I hope they will be much more Altruistic Evil Morality for the Working Class to Recieve Sans Lube in there Pie Exits!!!! Joy Ren! My own Bank Leveraged and Corporate Owned Soul!!!?? Cool yall enjoy that. Im droppin out, just cannot stand the absolute loss of humanity. Capitalism would be just swell if it was based on a Logical Objectivism. I have my wealth, self sufficiant life style, enjoy your lies and morality of contradictions. TeD ur a tool, and a spreader of propaganda for the Fascist Oligarchy.
You can't hack it. - Don Tapscott ( Professional idiot )
Governments and central banks are, unfortunately, in the process of hijacking block chain technology and using it to track and tax every transaction in the economy and help implement a cashless society by decree and more hardcore fascism. Welcome to Dystopia! There are good uses for block chain technology, but governments are planning nefarious uses for it.
As long as there is no legal framework surrounding blockchain there is no point to it. It's just a gambling game. Plus EVERY SINGLE THING on the internet is HACKABlE. This guy has no idea about what he's talking about
a true cyber-socialist! no, but jokes aside, some very interesting points made in this video.
Anarco-Capitalism through bitchains, I love it. We don't need big banks and national debt based currency or taxes. We can pay for things directly. We can solve our problems without coercion through innovation and entrepreneurship. That is true freedom and self ownership.
The Government makes laws on behalf of the Corporate lobbyists to secure the future of their industries, including big banks. About a decade ago, the government passed laws that criminalized online gambling in the US. They justified this claiming that Americans needed protection from unscrupulous online casinos, when in fact it was done to protect the interests and taxation of US based casinos. Online casinos could be licensed by foreign authorities based in countrys with low tax rates preventing revenue from flowing to the US government. What protections does Block Chain have to prevent the US government from initiating laws to criminalize and prosecute US citizens for using Block Chain apps, like they did with online casinos?
wow..this is amazing .But I am sure all the current corporates will try to block it as it been the doom for these middlemen.Amazing for the world !
I love Blockchain technology and truly believe that it can change the world!!

A valuable token of account is required as an incentive to drive the security of any blockchain in a decentralized manner. Thats why Bitcoins blockchain is the master blockchain and will continue to be. Private centralized blockchains are not true blockchains and are just shared data bases which are not to be trusted.
Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
the blockchain, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hurt everyone of us by damaging national economies. ill stick with fiat currency. im not an uneducated conspiracy theorist. bitcoins are all trackable and traceable.
I think bitcoin is the money of the future

I am better now thanks 2 + 2 = 5 Thanks for helping
I like math. I just don't know how to do it. I'm planning to do economy at college.
mom: studying hard I imagine!
yoooooo i suck at math i neeed help!
He is so ugly
I feel very good and ready after watching this video,thanks for the tips !
Thank you for arabic translate ?
MATH = Mental Amusement To Human. I say human. Practice is not the key to get better at Math. The key is understand the basic and fundamental Theorem and Theory realization in different cases. But the harsh truth is everyone just practice and practice and practice and practice a lot of math and they take it as a subject and as a result Math seems to them MATH = Mental Abuse To Human. All of you have to take Math as a language and To learn a language you have to know the grammar and Fundamentals comprehension behind it. So stop advising practice more and more. So in a one line, You have to get your knife first to cut your apple, without your knife you will always bite it with your teeth simultenously and That is the practice more and more.
sadly, many people that are not good at math are too lazy to do these...
I need to get better at math big time. I suck
Thomas, why do some people still think mathematics is counting? Why do they say it's difficult even then?
Math is like a game of chess... I don't know to play chess
Math is da best
Wow ur IQ is high
????
His eyes... How can you listen straight after having to look into his memorising eyes for at least 10 seconds? No wonder I don't understand math..
Well.. I don't want to be a nitpicker, but there's a difference between sum (9n)^1/n - 6 and sum [(9n)^1/n - 6] ...the first one is not equal to [(9*(1)^2/1) - 6] + [(9*(2)^2/2) - 6] + ..... + [(9*(n)^2/n) - 6] but to [(9*(1)^2/1) + (9*(2)^2/2) + .... + (9*(n)^2/n)] - 6
Well this is my first year as a maths student I love maths I used to get excellent marks .but unfortunately it wasn't the case for my first exam in maths science I had a dreadful mark so am just wondering if maths science is only for genious and stuff or it's just about working hard!! my mind is a mess Rn! especially I'm a maths student . maths is all I care about ?? any advices ??!!
that quote about finding an easier problem is good... but what if you cant solve 1+1 then what 0_0 XD
The only thing that is stops me from getting on the honor roll is math. I WILL STUDY HARD EVERYDAY
Algebra, bruh

3:28. No it doesnt. Everyone is able to make mistakes in any subject (except for things like re and philosophy where is pretty much impossible to be "wrong" despite the fact that what you're saying makes no sense).
0:45. You do need to understand what you're doing and why you're doing it as well. Otherwise you're less likely to remember it.

??????????
I love math.
Sorry but how will this sumation problem help me in life. Answer that.
Math is hard
Å
1: there will always be a sphere that can be used to measure the abstract visual. because all problems exist within a radius value of influence, if you spin it an infinite series of times from point a to b in any direction you will result in a sphere. 2: most of these problems don't matter. 3: when you have to measure something to build or design, use a calculator or relative tool to focus on your vision at hand rather than wasting time pondering answers.
Sooo I'm going to go somewhere else and learn summation cause I am in 6th grade. K bye.
Try photomath also its a really good app and it always explains it step by step.
Thank you your videos are a big help??
Do, how to become interested in math (i hate math)
Is he right about the free book?

@ANTSTER TIME
Hello I like math
I HATE MATH
I had a test today and I was stuck on two questions and I just wanted to cry. Math makes me want to quit school.
Why is that: Americans say "math" British say "maths"
Skip to 6:57 for summary
Why getting better at math ? Math is too boring !
0:07 no I thought , " what is the nature of reality "
So maths is actually even worse than any other subject, in other subjects you can still memorize and also understand the concept fine but in MATH the only way is through REPEATED PRACTICE which in my mind is kind of like repeated memorization till you figure out some very inconspicuous pattern.
6:30 I swear to the Almighty God this is the ONLY REASON I was never able to pass math [traditionally] the instructor assigns a problem everybody has to work through and when the other student's breathing, moving and grunting distract you to the point you can't finish the professor wants to put you on blast in front of everyone in the class. I swear to God I don't see why they can't offer an online option to every math course. I took 3 algebra courses online got 2 A'S and one c [I got ill]. Why do stupid ass teachers do that!!?? Teacher: "lets group your old ass non trad student up with Becky the evil high school graduate who hates you for no reason but we will entertain her because she is a child and you are probably a rapist for deciding to return t o school in your mid 40's to receive a cs degree." Shit, just tell me where I can download the lesson video and give me the homework, I'll show up in 6 weeks to ace the test.
Too late; I needed this 13 years ago. I wonder if the teachers I had and the rigid curriculum was why I hated math. Maybe if I was able to learn at my own pace, I wouldn't have hated math so much.
PhotoMath is a good phone app to help you - it scans the equation on your paper, gives you the answer and the solution to get to the answer.
Math shouldn’t put as a subject, It’s not language u cannot speak it, Who created it at the first place, But to be better we have to practice,practice,practice
I work as a software engineer. I'm senior level and been in my field for 20 years. I really want to increase my mathematics understanding
What the fuck is man's saying?
Definitely gonna use the quadratic equation in my practice as a lawyer
I took mine today and my tip is to do the free response first, then the multiple choice. I was able to finish and actually had time to go over my answers.

My birth mother did drugs arround me when I was a baby. My academic skill is slower.

I gotten a ad about math
Time goes faster when I do math that's why I don't like math
I AM that person who HATES math........
I HATE MATHS
Yo bro i am studying in 12th right now and our teachers are rushing with the subjects so quickly that you cant even understand whats actually going on i just feel like staying back one year and learning everything all over again but i cant just waste one year of mine like that i am really stuck here i get your entire point and the people at my college just byheart everystep of solving a problem and get good marks cuz they cant ask any complicated problem in our tests. And i who is trying to understand something will be able to do good at some chapters but lac k really badly on the other i just cant solve a problem without undeestanding the concepts and my exams are next week. I wish i had enough time. I am just hear to tell everyone that if you are studying in ashitty AF college like mine just start of learning way before your teachers even start. And sacrifice your fun times to study i wish some one told me this before cuz i regret it badly. If you are stuck on a chap just visit sal khan @khanacademy.com he does a really good job of explaing most of the concepts really well and also aims for mastery
honestly.... for me doing math is like watching a chinese movies without subtitles
It's because fortnite ugh ok I'll slow down!
I'm Asian and I bring great disappointment to my family.
seroiusly do you know what does this came from ? 2x - 23 (the 3 is up) . 5 = 14
MATH, GROW UP AND SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS!!
I was watching this in math class on my phone and the boy sitting next to me was guessing jobs with no math, lol
who just went down in the comments
I got a citation for being habitually truant in high school because I couldn't do math. You think i'm lying I know. I would as well. The good news is even the judge thought it was stupid I got a ticket. The bad news is i'm now 20 and I still don't know my multiplication tables...
Maths
I don’t get it
i already knew that...
I do not understand anything but I find this video so soothing and I love to make “exactly, yeah I got it” like” face expression while watching this. ehmmm
What the fuck is wrong the that sum symbol
I mean I'm not bad at math because I wasn't bad at it last year I got all A's and B's but this year my teacher will out stuff on quizzes that we didn't learn ever ??
I don't know why i want to improve my maths i get 80% on my test im in year 10
Math is beautiful for me , I enjoy spending time with math ...
I'm in the top class of my year. I have the most annoying teacher alive. He can't teach a thing. He understands it, but we don't. He doesn't explain the questions well enough even when you ask him to explain it better. I really need math and I feel like I'm going to fail.
While this is great advice for how to divide and conquer the computation of a math problem, a lot of math requires rigorous proofs. How do these concepts for computing a problem translate to proving a statement?
I see mathematic as a complex language's
Yeah no. Im not doing this any time soon.
I’m a math person
ITS NOT THAT IM NOT SMART..... IM JUST TOO LAZY!
I LOVE MATHEMATICS!!!! (I know, i'm strange)
15 years too late lol
But i'm too lazy
I’m already getting easy A’s in math but I found this video very informative with good examples and some good humor. Keep it up! :)
*1 plus 2 is four, minus 1 that 6 quik mefs.
believe me i was trash at maths in 5th grade i wasn't good even at multiplication I'm doing calculus in 8th grade now It may be because i'm gifted but anyone else can do it. it doesn't need much practice as people may assume, it requires an understanding of the topic, believe me practice is useless without understanding, without understanding, it's called mugging up when you're studying a formula understand WHY the formula works HOW the creator of it made it, understand the concepts and how they work, that alone will make you good at math
Find the coordinates of the two points on the curve y=4-x^2 which tangents intersect at the point (-1,7)
Me here trying to explain my mom I CAN'T PAUSE ONLINE GAMES!!
thanks man this is very helpful and makes sense
Lol that sigma at the thumbnail looking thicc
number lines,and bench marks....... SCREW ME UP!!!!!!!
Im in year 9, below average in maths; shitty teacher who doesnt discipline the class, or even teach well. I enjoy maths but i fall behind too. The uni degree i want requires Calc III. Would it be possible for me to learn everything in 3 years?
Math is not hard your just lazy to do it
Simple : Just listen to your teacher not sleeping :D
step 1: buy a graphing calculator
Thanks
Pro tip: 1) Practice algebraic manipulation. 1.5) Learn relevant identities and relevant manipulation rules. 2) Substitute parts of your problem with variables. 3) Solve for the general case. 4) Plug in the original values. Voila!
Thx I got better at math
1st math test question: What is 20% of "free"?
Very interesting! Thank you!
This is actually how I got to be relatively good at math. Practice like a HELL, then I started to appreciate the beauty of math and finally I fell in love with math and, now I study phisics at university.
That Order of Ecclesia poster on the back keeps distracting me from the video. Also, did you intentionally round down p in 3:54 instead of rounding it off just to piss people off? XD
wata bag of boredom. sad, sad.sad camera hugger.
I didn’t understand a single thing
Whenever I can do oral math, I do it. Just seeing random numbers anywhere and doing something with it. Now I am basically like a discount calculator or something.

OR I AM JUST DUMB
It takes me 1 and a half hour to finish one problem
At school, I have the most difficult questions, for example 0 + 0 PLS HELP BALDI TEACHING MEEEEEEEE
Photomath is also a good tool for step by step solution
I am bad at maths and English which is easy to me all grade was bad now in collage so two two again accept childcare study now ( Mum tell me to watch learning stuff because I am dum) .
An example of why I think I have a problem with learning math is the exponent part you did there. Usually the operations are explained but the underlying concepts or 'proofs' are not. So I can learn the reflexive action in this case 'fractional exponent can be factored to include 1/2 which is a square root), but that's all I have. This isn't a complaint against you but sums up (pun unintended but accepted) my general experience with math. I feel like if I know the concepts anything is possible. But finding them all explained well with reasoning and visualisation is the most difficult part.
I suck at math!!! Seriously suck at math
Math is solved like any other problem in life. Its not all that different. For most problems, the way of thinking is the same. Also notion of abstraction is fundamental to being great at math. If you re struggling with solving practical problems it means you re missing some abstract knowledge or not thinking of the most fundamental properties crucial to the problem. But yeah, like said in the videos, great problem solving skills are chunking and converting a problem into an easier problem and using analogy to sopve the more difficult one is something everyone uses in their daily lives but doesnt really think about it. Being great at math or any other math/logic based sience is all about being self aware and how you solve every day problems, thinking on how to improve them and applying these methods to any kind of other problems, hence why abstraction and analogy are useful.
I got a question when do I multiply by the reciprocal of a number being multiplied by a group of parentheses and do I divide the parentheses by the reciprocal or does it just cancel also is 1m/1m 1 or m
Ok so 91% of your grade is your grade on assignments and tests and 9% is your teacher. As of now my math teacher says nothing about due dates the only thing she says ahead of time is tests and she gives about about 2-3 tests a week and spends 1 day on the subject, gives us the homework, sometimes she doesn't even collect the work for the whole class and puts it in the grade book as missing. After she spends the single day on the subject the next day is the test. Everyone complains about how many tests she gives. -_-
This video havin half a million views says something.
I got a 90 on a math text one grade higher than my grade lvl btw i am not boasting
Ahhh...math. The ONE damn subject I'm bad at. High school's coming next year. I NEEDS TO GIT GUD!!!
Super Brother I am week in maths your video give me boosting and an new idea for me thankyou for this video
Thanks
Can I get the solution of 9709_2018_p13_may
be asian
Thank u soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!111!!!????????
I can be better. If I actually don't miss out the day where the teacher starts the new chapter and tell's everything you need to know and then next day is a surprise test and if you don't pass = FAIL MATH
i just failed my math test today and it sucks :(
what the shit
Contrast
Go watch khan academy I watch rick and morty I know what I’m talking about
Photomath for iPad
Thomas, that is not a complex fraction. I think frog/frog=1
Is this discrete math?
???
how to be best at math can you do a video
Thank you this was very helpful.
math can be easy and math can be difficult. it's stupid to say math is difficult. it is smarter to say that some area of math is difficult. adding and subtracting is easy. there is so much easy math. the reason why you study difficult math is that it helps you. why would you study something that you already know well? of course you are supposed to study difficult math. that is the way to proceed as an individual.
Even if you master the concepts Some messed up question will appear which has nothing to do with what you learned.
Like u brother
I love how youtube recommmends this to me just when I'm having trouble studying maths
math is the most hated subject in school ;-;
my classmates make fun of my score i always get 0 or 1 score :(,and im a girl,why cant i be the girl in my school they look so pretty and im here ugly like i wanna go to a another school,imma kill myself bye world
Still don't get it
Thank you Thomas
I'll never get smart at math

I am not at all a maths person whatsoever
You know what’s easy? Biology. -Says the Bio major.
People normally look for tips and tricks to get better at Math while avoiding practice. However, there really is no way around it, just practice and maintain useful yet enjoyable study skills.
I scored above average on the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Exam), which is a math competition for the top people who take the AMC and got a six. This is really true. I was only able to get good at math from practice, practice, practice and I need to practice more if I am going to make the USA(J)MO.
0:16 you're wrong. what about those people, who have ADD like me? well physically i can learn of course, but mentally i really can't
I do not good maths at all all my grade at secondary school result was not good never like b or c or a or higher then this now some real exam now on holiday my result come at soon o have no idea what result made lot pray about this not revise person I do revise not smart
Cool
I love math
Really good videos
I actually got know how to do summation and more thankyou ???
Hi. Thanks again. Physics, Philosophy, Advanced Math are second hardest next to: programming- it's the hardest subject of them all.. God bless, Proverbs 31

yes but what's it for?
Thank you ssssooo mmmuuuucccchhhhhhhh
Ohhhh man it takes only 20 hour to get better in any field! Research has proven this!
Yeaaaa you lost me at "You have to do lots and lots of Math."
I love maths
I don't even have a firm grasp on fractions let alone fractional exponents. lol
This video made me feel stupid honestly
that's why EMBRACE math
3:04 Now this is what I always hated about math. To see possible ways to solve something say: is that even a valid approach??? how come this is acceptable?? Those would be my questions when reading the answers. Lol
i love this video so much....
Im 13 years old, 8th class, i dont want you to read this and think im just bragging and being greedy, but i gotta say, there is something with me, just random i got the best at math and i actually did a iq test, and i got 132 :#. Give me motivation to make me try to do good at other subjects when i have this ability XD
At 7:48 frank said Well the meaning of math is Many answers to humanity
And ever since I watch dis vids I got interested in math now... whyyyy
Nope
I love math ... But I'm not good at it xD
I assume you were high asf on recording of this video
NO HELP BOI??????
My science skill is unbelievable but my math is between C and D
Why, in the age of Wolfram Alpha, is any of this stuff even impressive, or necessary for that matter. Isn't just knowing how to frame a problem good enough?
Math...I think I'll stick with language arts.
I've had an still have issues with math, even at the years of 32 I was merely granted C out of compassion from my teacher. I have such a hard time with learning new concepts because they're simply not explained well enough, to me the examples are only providing the least minute information and leaves me to do the guesswork - but I don't know what rules applies at any given time as I expect them to be different with each formula. See it like this: If a formula can't be explained in one or two sentences in layman terms with no chance to be misinterpreted, then you've lost me.
I have to short of an attention. My bad, c yah.
#WHYWORKOUTYOURARMSWGENYOUCANWORKOUTYOURBRAIN
Who is already expert in math and watching this ??
I owe my thousand thanks to you????
Math is a waste of time not basic math but anything after Algebra 1 for me is a waste because what I want to be I don't really need it.
God your hot. I think you're my new crush... Mehbe. Charlie Puth is not as hot as you but still hot. I wonder if you're a model. ??????????
HI Tom all the things you say about Math is very good , the only problem is you are talking too fast, just low it down Mate.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah
Who lost him at the first easy example lol
No wonder, Books are better than this.
... My nose is bleeding. The blood came out of nowhere....
another app u can use to help find step by step solutions is photomath! u just have to take a pic of the problem and it converts it to text and then solves it! helped me so much the past few years!
My dumbass can't even do equations or division ??
Tnx bro
I get confused at (8/4)+(5206/2603)
i know maths
Thank you for the good advice. I do understand your need for making money, but it would be good to tell people about Khan Academy where they can learn math for free and probably at the same level of quality as at Brilliant.
Very interesting!
I don't understand anything
Thanks
Math is easy.... English is torture
it ´s true ,great .
My personal advice: 1) Know what you want to learn and what you know (realize where you are) 2) Get an explanation of the idea, visualize the solution (just to get you motivated) 3)Get a simple example well explained step by step, it can be a video or on paper, but have it in hand 4) Do a simple example yourself, different from the one you saw and with the answer step by step at the back for you to check, if you have any difficulty aid yourself with the other example 5)Do another example, maybe with just the end answer or with something different which makes it harder (for the last one you may need the answer step by step). 6) Do step 2 but no relate it to the exercises you've been doing 7) Do more exercises till you can write the steps you follow to do the problem, and do write down somewhere the steps for if you need them to study 8) Now you can move to the next topic 9) Cover many topics and you'll see how they require of each other; eventually you'll get a math intuition but that takes different time for different people This is the quick way of learning math but mathematicians don't really like it because scenically you are learning a "cooking recipe" rather than going straight to the abstract idea. And many feel it's kind of cheating
I took algebra 1 4 times in high school
I will grind
THIS IS FALSE. The thing about math that 95% of students don’t understand is that math is all about your thinking. How did Pythagoras develop is theorem? How did Euler develop is formulas? ALL THESE PEOPLE DID A LOT OF THINKING. The best way to develop math, is to develop your thinking. Students who just read the textbook, memorise what to do, are not doing math. They are just memorising. But students who are thinking a problem out as it’s own problem are actually doing math. Let me ask you all this, Why is it that when a number in the negative direction multiplied by a number in the negative direction result in a positive? Why is it that, when you divide fractions you flip the second fraction? If you can’t answer these questions, but you are still memorising these rules, your math will not improve, but it will certainly get worst than it already is.
Ok shut up and get to the product ur trying to sell scammer
The trouble I have is finding stuff to do. Does anyone know somewhere where I can just work through problems?
Great video. Thanks.
LOL'd! Who the hell would think of a Math problem when being asked to thing of a hard problem. Unless you're a student, then it's understandable... The first thing that came to mind for me is climate change
This guy gets it.
This is cool for school math. What about Olympiad math?
what
That's a hilarious sigma symbol in the thumbnail.
Wow I can barely do multiplication in my head
The key to become good at math is to ban school exams. Exams discourage the learning process.
Looks up how to become better at math, instantly bursts into tears bc I literally have no idea what any of that first problem means. Like at all. I completely give up.
I love this guy, he's a good lad.
I’m actually Average on maths :)
What is that book, whos page you are flipping in the introduction talking ?
I watched the video for a second and my brain started to hurt
John has three apples.He ate one. Calculate the mass of the sun. Can't solve that... 1+1=2 Just gonna stick with what i've got
yes daddy, teach me math
Its more complicated without using a calculator you could.easily get past that sigma notation in a test with using a calculator

How to do math: Step 1-write down question Step2-Cry.
The thing I find frustrating about math education (k - 12) is a lack of explanation. The logic, reasoning, and essentially the 'why' behind the concepts presented are never explained. For example, I know how to solve simple word problems involving systems of equations, but I can't explain why representing the problem in that format allows us to solve it. In fact, I don't really know when to use systems of equations except when I know we're in the section of the textbook that's talking about systems of equations.
Came for math, left with merch
Easy. Be interested in math,
4^(3/2) = (v4)^3 = 2^3 = 8 ;).
:((( I literally have no time to learn everything I don’t know in math somehow I found myself in a calc class and I just now realized the massive holes in my education
Oh well I tried
I'm searching math... and my little 10 year old brother is searching up how to get free v bucks on his iPad... smh......
2 years ago I solved a father and son problem. The son was 28 years older than the father. Since that day I hate math
jake gyllenhaal is that you?
In India , teachers teaches these when you are 9th grade....and in some parts of india there's a sub called advance mathematics from 8th grade...i took adv maths ...now it seems easy back then it not easy at all....complex numbers, permutation combination, difficult geometry,set theory ,etc .... Idk why they teach them so early but it seems like a help now
thanks
My biggest...and I mean my BIGGEST issue with math is simply this: WHY AM I DOING THIS? It's not that math is hard, it's not that it's boring, it's not that it's complicated or any of that. It simply serves NO PRACTICAL PURPOSE IN THE MOMENT. Sure I can solve the damned equation as long as I know how...but I need to know WHY I'm doing (all of) this to begin with. Show me something...anything that makes it more than pointless exposition. If I don't know why I need an equation to solve a problem I will never know to apply any equation to any problem appropriately. THAT is the problem with mathematics. It doesn't plug in anything else but abstract exposition.
I am great at every other class.
I’m good enough
I feel maths is like a language, the more you use it -- reading, writing, "speaking", "listening" -- the better and more "fluent", and you start with simple sentences and build up to more complex ones
Use Photomath
I used to be so good but I don't know what happened.
I love math, for me it is the easiest subject in school. I don't know why people hate it. Anybody can be good at math, they only need to practice. P.S. Sorry because of my bad english
I'm so bad at math that I couldn't finish this video. There was too much math in it for me.
I have a hard time remembering math formulas.. I will understand it now but, i will just forgot it later. Any tips?
WolframAlpha sells an app for $3 that also includes step-by-step solutions. Get it on your smartphone, and save a subscription fee.

Self-directed learning is just like every other skill - practice, practice, practice.
Kaizen for math
Liked just for the quote at the beginning. That's the quote that my favorite maths teacher used to say and it completely changed how I think about solving hard problems.
That moment you notice the video is a Brilliant add 10 seconds in, Smh
I've also found it can be really beneficial to use a tool to compare your wrong answer to the correct one. Sometimes you make bookkeeping errors or were shaky on one step, so if you see that the actual answer is, say, exactly double yours, you can start to dig at where a problem occured. Another great thing from wolfram alpha is that the paid step-by-step solution can actually help people NOT paying: you can see the very top of it, so it can give you a foothold for a head scratcher without spoiling the rest of the work.
i think history is harder than maths... and i dont know why ????????
umm.. math? ...yeah. You've got purdy eyes, man. Want to go camping on Brokeback?
Yu qeuro taco bell.
YOU ARE AWESOME. THOMAS...
This video just made me want to cry. I’ve never been good at math, I’ve had 5 math tutors and it’s helped 0% no matter how hard I try, I can’t do the most easiest questions. I frustrate my teachers and my parents and I just know I won’t pass my big maths exams. I’m sick of being told “practice” cause it just doesn’t work, I’m just useless when it comes to it, pretty sure my brain switches off.
"For GOD so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life."
I literally got 8/16 on my math test and this test may effect which class I'm going to do I'm not gonna be with my friends????
Your sigma could be my house
I love math
I Can Do Good At Addition A little Slow At Subtraction but multiplying? Feels Impossible But I can do it slowly dividing? Not A chance
I am just repeating what has been said but you'd better not use those math solving app. If you can ask someone like your teacher or your friend show you the way you have to take is much better. I've failed some exam because i used photomath to solve the hardest questions and in front of my sheet i couldn't find the right way to solve it.
The big problem in my life. Im good at other subject but not math last, I got A in math is when I was 8 years old I think. I feel like as I got bigger I got a terrible grade like 35%!! My family was so good in math but not me even my little brother always got A in ALL subject. And after I got terrible grade ,I feel that I hate math and not interested in math anymore. AND TOMORROW I HAVE AN EXAM AND IT MATH I HATE MY ENGLISH
Love the warp speed solving.. Sure, we get it..
calculus is so hard. i can't wait to get through calc 2 so i can graduate and never see it again

Sir you are great
I bet no one can solve my impossible math problem even when looking at this video.
l suck at math so badddddddddddddd l can’t even explain how bad l am at math ??????????????????????????????
I think having my maths gcse tomorrow is good enough motivation to get better at it
no tough problems just give me headaches and make me tired.
My problem is memory loss. I alot of the time i will forget how the process will work for quite a few of the problems. Half of the time i will look at the problem in a confused manner. One thing that irritates me is the words used. Such as the word of meaning a multiplication symbol or the word double meaning multiply as well. Why cant they just say multiply instead of substituting a word for multiplication in word problems?
Are you a RUSHER or a DRAGGER!!! badamtuss
Thanks!
;-) ????
You know that sensation when you solve an entire problem and you're 100% sure it's correct What is it like? ;-;
you have beautiful eyes omg

I am now 40 with an average IQ and I've just started learning math in my freetime (I am an ordinary salary man). I started with Larson Precalculus . It's a very good book for an old self-learner with an average IQ like me. After I have finished, I plan to learn Calculus, Geometry, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra too. My goal is to finish Analysis : )
I hate math;)
Why am I here? I'm a 6th grader that study calculus!
I love maths but I usually get lost in my calculations and screw up. This helps me so much!
I can't find any reliable resources on solving recurrence equations by the Generatrix function method... I need actual examples of it to know da wei ma brotha
gracias
Simply love it!
I have no idea what you are talking about At my school everyone was bad at math
Still in 8th grade using a Pythagorean theorem sooooooo I don’t know any of the examples you’re giving me... (well some but most of them you’re showing I don’t get). Ahhh high school ;-; shits gonna suck
I hate math. That’s why I suck lol ?? ??
The thing is, I understand the concept and material pretty well most of the time and do most of my homework but I still manage to get not so great on my tests... why/how someone pls help me, this is a cry for help
Taking honors integrated 4 (pre calc) and stats next year as a sophomore and wanna be prepared
This video is better if watched 0.25X speed
How to apply algebra, geometry, calculus, etc. in my common life?
Thanks! This video is inspired me to learn Math more.
Ayye I learned sigma notation for my pre cal class
1:47 thats exactly my problem :)))) i hate doing that
I just came here, for multiplication problems.
This guy is so hot I can’t even focus
Like the Monty python reference
I LOVE DIS VIDEO, Thx for helping ( ?° ?? ?°)
Why does EVERYONE gets sponsored by brilliant.org? I mean of course its cool and I also use it but in almost every second video i watch at the end they say: „Brilliant.org is a great learning platform bla bla bla“ or sometimes: „This episode is brought to you by skillshare a online learning platform and so on“
i tried im still dumb
I completely agree! The more you work at Math the more you begin to understand it. The only problem here is time constraints. By the time you begin to start catching on to a certain problem your presented with a whole new set.. Either this or you are being tested on it before full mastery. Some people it takes considerably longer to catch onto solving mathematical problems, much like some people struggle with memorization of diagrams, definitions, etc.
Who else is studying for a math test
I am terrible at Math all my life. Which is ironic, since my father was an accountant.
1*1=1 wow mind blown
Was anything he just said English?
TBH I am already good at math but I need to study science cause I am so bad 40/50.
I’m taking the ACT in a year, and I’m really bad at math (i repeated Algebra 1 and Geometry) so this video is SO helpful. Thank you.
I've completed Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus I-IV, Linear Algebra, taking Statistics now...I sure know I am NOT a freaking math person, I hate it and it sucks!!! p.s. unfortunately I was not born Asian, so my genes are not predetermined to be good at math
I mean I'm in a 1q class my 1q is low and we are learning some baby math and I'm trying my hardest to get out of these STUPID classes(: math and reading are my weak points btw
In my case, I didn't study math like almost nothing at high school, I don't remember about any concept. Now I'm studying on my own to get into college, in a course that is base on *MATH*, that's suicide, yeah I know, so I've been studying on my own, all subjects including MATH, from scracth and I can't even solve basic problems including multiplication, when I read the question/problem my mind goes blank.
***Maths
@6:31-6:49 me at the moment ok I am going back to my summations now! Funny how you did that lol
Math [SUCKES]

heyy, i have a question, how do you solve those long wordy questions in maths and get better at them?
this video title should how to the best at math
In the words of my maths teacher: "if you want to learn how to solve problems, solve problems"
1+1
Trust me you tell us the exact solutions
I wanna get better at math 'cause I'm forced to. I really hate it. So much.
The lowest i got for math is 5/100.. No, I didn’t sleep during the test. Yes, i did revise. :(
Thanks, I subed
I'm good at math but my dang math teacher always forgets to give me homework and thinks its my fault that I absolutely NEVER have homework done
That tutor guy
I am like on the maths jurney I use Khan academy cosmolearn youtube online free textbooks, and maths stake exchange I have been doing it for the past 9 months I am at nearly the nd of algebra 1 stage I still strugle on cube roots and polynominals all I do is my best and hopless at simplyfyinh things but the more I do it the better I get I just play with it and do my best.
I'm nervous for the Math SAT...
It's hard to listen to what you are saying because your eyes are like melting my damn soul :( lol #YOUHAVEGORGEOUSEYES #MARRYME? #ISTILLCAN'TPAYATTENTIONBUTTHANKSANYWAYS
My teacher teaches me stuff I have no clue what he means. So when I go home I search it up on YouTube and see comments for people in collage working on this -_-
very good video ^^ thank you for the advices
You are so attractive K bye
Help! I Studied 1 week ahead for an math exam! Everyday 30-60min maths I thought i would get an B or an A but I GOT AN F and now I may need to repeat the year and if i need to repeat i need to leave the Country
Wow this shit is confusing lol but I’m going to keep trying to learn it
Hi Thomas (or anyone else for that matter) I find sometimes I can use a formula and get a right answer for various problems but I don't understand why the formula does what it does? By that I mean why it might divide two numbers and multiply others throughout the formula? Any advice on how to understand why the various parts of the formula are doing what they are doing? I find I get stuck on not understanding why a formula works and it frustrates me so much I find it difficult to move on. Most of the time I can use the formulas I'm given and manipulate them to get what I want but i don't understand the workings of the formula and how it gets what it does and I find I have a need to understand that. Any help and advice anyone can give will be met with much thanks, or point me in a direction to learn how to understand.
Fuck
Now I'm in the nerd group in my class
IT HELPED
Thanks! Now I'm gonna crack math problems often! ??
Simple... ????
How can I practice when I don't understand what I will practice I think I'm practicing my wrong solution lol
I'm so bad at math, trigonometry and all the shit I'm just bad at numbers idk am I even gonna graduate
You talk like jake gyllenhal
Awesome video thanks for the tips.
You left me behind the moment you wrote the first problem and my mind went blank. I never heard of a summation before now.
I'm in Grade 9 What i scored in my last exams out of 100. English: 87 Computer : 76 Maths : 23 EPH : 81 Social Studies : 78 Another shitty Maths : 36 My problem is with Maths :(
I disliked just to like again.
this video didn't teach me shit, but I liked the video anyway because of your appearance
Math is easy. Hardest subject is EaE..
Sees video: Bleeds from nose
I hate math because I'm dumb and I can't do it to save my life.
I thought of the Riemann zeta function.
That brilliant thingy is really something. Now I solve math problems first thing in the morning lying in bed. Beautiful way to procrastinate
Too many numbers, not really math. Actual math is mostly symbolic.
I too love you Brother. Live your life
Girls will be mad for this Math professor
This video is a Godsent! Now I can stop burning sacrifices!!??
The mitochondria is the power house of the-- woops wrong video
what about physics
Lmao im still failing the math exam
I'm normally averse to math speak, but when explained by someone so charismatic and devilishly handsome, it makes it 'exponentially' more tolerable! ????
Great video man, this was incredibly helpful. You’ve gained yourself one more subscriber keep up the great work???
Am I the only one who thinks that he looks like Enrique Iglesias ?
His. Eyes.
I HAVE MY SAT EXAMS IN TWO MONTHS PRAY FOR ME PLEASE
Some people are already good at maths tbh.
My worst subject is Language and Literature, though.
??????
I never watched this channel. Is it just about math? If it is i'm Gonna watch these videos all day so i can get better at math. I get low scores on UsaTestPrep. I'm horrblie at math. I'm good at ELA.
Well a solid amount of people in my class are feminists and I assume they believe math is sexist and wont do it
Considering the video is about maths, your first question would obviously spring a huge maths equation to mind.
thank you
And what if it was an African swallow carryng a coconut?
2:23 I'm a math major, and interestingly there are some problems that I can only do in my sleep. Integration problems in particular. I can wake up and know the answer to the problem, but have forgotten all about how I came to that result and be completely stumped when I try to solve it by hand (granted I spent more than seven hours figuring it out while I was asleep).
you helped me thank you
another extended ad fro Brilliant. ffs this is just another motivational video with the same advice your maths teacher will tell you..........
The only math that will help me in life is calculating Interest and compound interest, why the hell do I need to quadratic equations or summation.
I really appreciate you putting your time into this video. It’s the first video I’ve seen of your channel, but it really grabbed my attention, held it, and now I’m a proud subscriber. :) I’m terrified of starting high school next year. I’m currently in the 8th grade and have been striving for greatness in math. It’s currently the only thing holding my back on the ACTs and other standardized assessments, and I’m hoping I can apply the skills given to me in this video. When I was in 2nd grade, I was extremely defiant and never listened to anyone. As my mother would put it, I’ve always had a problem with authority. I never got my math done, nor did I ever listen to the teachers. Thanks to that, I got pulled behind in math. To my disadvantage, I am just now in the process of getting diagnosed with a developmental disorder, or some form of anxiety, we’re not quite sure of anything yet. I wish I would’ve said something earlier to prevent getting behind, but at least now, I have a shot at bettering myself. Thank you!
talent is just an ignorant excuse. its mostly 1% giftet and 99% hard work, patience and concentration.
It's like he can read my mind - 0:06
Lol I'm really good at maths.. Why am I here??
You stop watching videos about doing maths and actual do the do. Or just watch a video on actual math learning.
1 + 1 = 5
HI Tom, are there books that you could recommend which we can use to progressively learn new problems and grow. Also if you could include logic and Statistics that would FANTASTIC! Big thumbs up on your videos.
wow thanks, i didn't know about symbolab and it even has a "practice" part O.o

I have more fun with math when I'm high lmao puzzle time!
man looks stonedddddd wooooooot
This video melted my brain.... Poor me when I actually do maths
I still have Fs
It's not hard it's just my teachers who make us learn just to score good marks
I love maths but I just don't have much confidence, like if I see others I think they're better than me., I always think that I don't know anything??????
wow I regret that I just found your channel, I'm really struggling on math
Then if people aren't just math people then why does maths just click for some people and not others?
Frog over frog, the definition of a big fraction
Math probably isn't that hard, but being the lazy degenerate that I am I just make things harder for myself.
I live in Egypt but I am from Iraq so I hate Arabic SO BAD LIKE HELL!! And I ADORE ENGLISH SO BAD LIKE HELL!!! So I got this idea And it's Study math in English and when I need to say the solution in Arabic just do it easy WOOOOOW

Another thing is math is not about numbers
I'm 18 and still don't remember the multiplication table.
Math is simple; you just have to follow the steps.

Thank you for posting this video Thomas.
Sounds easy but it's not as easy at it sounds but very informative Thanks! ??
I use another app called "photomath"
I had to watch this 3x because I was very distracted by his beauty ...damn him....oh and THANKS great advice . Master the components will do
please create a facebook group.because i need to talk about my problem with you.
great video, wish i had thought of this at the beginning of this semester
I'm in 4th grade and well... I can't really remember the things my teacher tells me.
I remember in when I was in high school taking my chemistry class. I was failing for 99% of the year, but not for a lack of trying. I'd stay after school every day to get help with what I wasn't understanding (which was everything). My teacher came up to me near the end of the cool year and said, "I've noticed you're not doing so well in my class, even though you've been here every day working on your homework and asking questions. I respect that. I want you to know, that if you keep working this hard for the rest of the year, I GUARANTEE you will not fail this class." So I continued working diligently as I have been and sure enough, I passed the class with a solid 60%!
IM FAILING AT MATH AND IM IN 5TH GRADE REALLY DO NOT WANT TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL AND I DONT PASS SUMMMER SCHOOL I GET LEFT BACK . WHY IS MATH A THING . WHY IS MY LIFE SO HARD . WHY DOES SCHOOL EXCIST
Anyone got A in your grades and aced every test without studying?
I like your eyes, No homo.
Those are calculations, not math problems. Wolfram Alpha can't find any proofs for you.
i find easy maths boring,i find complex maths intresting >:D
thanks man
Im 14 and didn't understand lol
This video was very helpful for me.Good work, Thomas???
I know this is irrelavant to say but damn your eyes are pretty..
#Procrastinating
Thomas Frank, could you make one of these on the topic of Chemistry? Been struggling on the best way to learn and grasp the material. Thanks!
Just got here, love him already. This is legit math motivation. Making a new 'watch later' group
His eyes are soo beautiful ??
The Monthy Python reference killed me
His child (if he has one ) will be the next Albert instein
Why the hell im founding that video 8 hours after my math test???
"If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem that you can solve: find it." Okay, I know 2+2=4 does that mean I know the circumference of an octagon?
Great
im good at math, but the only problem to me is ,I always forgot the formula used for solving ??
That is not math its physics math is the wing of physics
peters mother baked a batch of muffins there are 16 in a batch .peter ate 1/4of the batch . his mother baked two more batches . how many muffins were left... sir please
I'M DOOMED
I've done my maths lessons in school no need to get better at it. I'm working just as an accountant so what good would it do me anyway.
Another app that is really helpful and free to see step by step solution is PhotoMath. I use it to see if I get the correction solution or if not where I went wrong
I know math 2+2 is 4 - 1 that 3 quick MATHS
find an already solved equation, deconstruct it (figure out what happened from the beggining of the equation to the end) and solve the same equation with different values (6-7 times minimum for better memorization).
people in america and europe are lucky :p i studied your math before and it was 100 times easier than the books we study here in Egypt, it's insane if you compare the two.
i only need to pass the tests lmao, i don't really need the good grades, in my country i need to choose between taking 1) literature classes 2)science classes 3)mathematic classes i am going for science because that is what i am good at, but math is so freaking annoying to me, sometimes i am REALLY good at it, and the others i am just horrible. next year is the year i choose my class,i just need to keep it together and pass the test tomorrow.
I love you man! You give me the motivation to study and your videos are just perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge
Why am I here, I'm good at math, but I like the way to explain to be better at it, now I know how to do a summation problem ??
The equation you used is from physiqs
so every tvd fan is ignoring the fact that he looks like Stefan?
Traditional Mathematics is simple Calculus 1-4 were design by philosophy to calculate air landings and various volumes of abstract shapes as well as describe the infinitesimal. Pretty simple stuff because you can just plug and chug a set of steps to calculate changes. However real math is tough, how many of you guys haven proven existence,inclusion exclusion parity,cardinality,prove universal statements, or know about asymptotic functions. These problems are extremely hard even for somebody like me who has studied discrete mathematics for years. as well as studied probability and statistics/graph theory/numerical analysis/linear algebra/Calc 1 -4/ and algorithms. It takes genius to discover existence of a algorithm and dissecting it.Often, how somebody responds to proving some thing like "All students are great at mathematics" can tell me alot about your logic skills.
lol apply what I learned in the real world
Bad at math? Do statistics. Problem solved.
"What is the air speed velocity of a Swallow?" "What do you mean? African or European?" "I don't know that! Ahhhhhhhhh!"
How to get better at maths, instead of looking at these kind of videos, actually go to the table open up a math book and start thinking and understanding proofs and problems smh.
can you be by math tutor
This video made me feel like I wanna work maths longer than anytime!
sees title im already good at met- oh
Ever been trolled Read more
I got 97% in Maths. Is that bad? My parents say it is
For a start call it Maths
Why the fuck am i here, i had A's
I am not joking, I took 2 hours to solve an angle kind of question
This is very helpful especially since I’m starting a whole new semester! ????
I’m really good at math the first time I learn it and then I learn another concept and forget the old one ;-;
This did not help at all
Advice from a mathematics PhD candidate: - precalculus: you either know it or you don’t. Be sure you understand precalculus concepts through and through otherwise you’re gonna have a bad time in calculus and other classes like Analysis - Math is about understanding. DO NOT try to memorize how to solve a problem it will only lead to your demise. - Understand definitions in mathematics- what is a prime number/ polynomial/ rational expression - Mathematics can be found everywhere because it’s a universal language so become familiar with it. Like learning spoken (or signed) languages you have to push yourself to understand and construct complex sentences and abstract ideas so it’s ok to make mistakes - to build on the previous point, math, like any language, isn’t mastered in one day so don’t give up if you don’t get it the first time. - be sure to reach out for help AS SOON AS you don’t understand something - for upper level math classes like topology and analysis, go in with an open mind - have fun doing it. Math is straightforward and definitive. Once you master a concept in this field, it’s with you for life.
How to get better at maths: Be interested in the matter and practise a lot If it doesn't interest you: Don't even try. You can't force yourself to learn something
i'v always failed at math during my school life, however i was determined to fucking pass that shit. so i studied everyday for a month straight and well... passed xD
M ental A buse T o H umans
thomas sir uh r awesome
im a baboon on math , crap
I just found your YouTube channel and I have been binging all of your videos! Thanks Thomas, keep up the amazing work!
Hey! everyone try Photomath if you're an iPhone or Android user. It gives the step by step solution to most of your mathematical problems and it's free too.

I’ve been practicing for years, trying to challenge myself with difficult, more complex problems. Yet I still can’t effectively solve anything and I forget mostly all the techniques and ways to solve certain problems. I think I’m hopeless.
I will always lorn math??:)
You cheecky fellow, I see that monty python reference. I thought this was about math and I for sure wasnt expecting a spanish inquisition!
I hate math
Im good at math
I been doing this for year but I still suck at maths, maths just hates me so much
This dude is awesome
I've been looking at "Common Core" is total terribleness
Thank you frank
This summation symbol works just like" for loop" in Java,,??????
Another great website that helps greatly when doing math is *Desmos Graphing Calculator*. It allows you to graph your functions and understand them more easily. You can easily do transformations on functions and see what exactly happens.
Lol numbers in math... yeah I remember my first semester....
Guess what I want to have zero subscribe for you
I hate math stupid
I've been stuck at the pre-algebra level for 15 years. One thing I've noticed about math in general is that the formula's continue to grow in steps and length. Fuck up one part of the formula, the rest of the castle comes crashing down. Proceed back to the start point and try again!! Learning is repetition and as long as the particular college allows you as many tries as possible to get that passing grade to advance onto the next course, then that's a good thing. I mean, there's some schools out there that have a set limit on how many times they'll allow you take a course. After 4-5 tries, they tell you to effectively, piss off, and take your slow brain somewhere else. Piss on them.
The only way you get better is if you try.
Serious question, it's a good habit to study in advance the semester while you are in vacations?
The first problem that came up in me head is that my crush dont like me back
I have been doing math for 2 months and I can't put math in my Freaken head..!!??????
Just to save everyone personal time, the end conclusion here is know your basics.
Thanks very mutch!i am very happy because anyone speaks for math(sorry for my bad english)and good luck!
I’m letting his handsomeness distract me from what is coming out of his mouth
nice and plz subscribe the channel
I cliked on the video cuz i wanted to learn the thing that is in the tumbnail
Oh thanks for the video.....it helped me in my SAT’s
Hello,Sir ,?? You talked about Maths and I know that there is a slight difference between Maths and Statistics . Correct me if I am wrong , so I love to solve problems ...etc but the thing is that I have A subject this semester called "statistical Prediction " so I want to know how to get better in statistics too??
Is it bad that when Thomas told us to think of a hard problem I thought "My life."?
I do this everytime and often find myself doing the same question for 3-6 hours. Tbh I wanna quit
Heck, go and cheat in the exams. Learn things the hard way. Then you know the consequences.
I'll probably just stick with Khan Academy instead of brilliant
Nice work
i can not do multiplecation tables.trying for years.
You have to love maths to increase your ability in solving, like Euler's Constant
I like always was gazing at your beautiful face and had difficulty focusing on the content , damn ! Had to rewind again and again
This guy looks like Michael McCruden from Before They Were Famous.
Math is easy -Every Calculator
Thanks for videos from Nepal
All right but how to do it faster ?
Before watching this video my pre-calculus grade is 85% after watching tom’s video and series of math reviews I managed to score 95%! Thanks dude!
Here's a suggestion: find the most general solution possible first. Chances are, in multi-part problems, that you will be applying the same solution over and over again. If you can deconstruct the problem in the first part, the other parts will be much easier. The more general your initial solution, the more applicable it will be to following questions.
No I don't think math is every complex, hence, this is not my problem with it. Problem is that I can't study it in an organized course, because I know all the basic algebra and geometry. So getting it from the beginning is really really boring. So problem is how to begin.
lol im always lazy and im only fairly satisfactory in math XD but im good in other subjects, just not math
If you want to get better at math, the obvious first step would be to explore learning styles and figure out how your brain processes numbers and how you learn math to begin with. Everyone does not do these things in the same ways. The main reason so many people have grown up sucking at math is because they were taught in opposition to how they learned.
Please do one for English literature ???? I’m having loads of trouble with it. I’m given loads of creative writing tasks and my mind is always blank, and I always make stuff up as write and end up not getting the grade that I wanted ??

fuck. he is hot
I'm not actually in school... I just like math.
You have beautiful eyes
I hate Laplace Transforms, that's all...
probability?
When u would practise math all the time and still not be as good as your friend who was naturally good at math and never studied at all.
Now this is a beautiful mind! His beauty is distracting!
I'm in 6th grade. I don't do this #$%&
The secret is to pay more attention as you do a math problem. Most people make minor mistakes while doing a math problem that lead to the wrong answer.
My math teacher was the dog shit. So,i hate the math,now yet.
You have just earned one more sub
This guy is pretty handsome. You're lucky man
How can I not rush if my exam is tomorrow on 13 chapters!!!
i can't understand your easy example so i'am hopeless
math is hard fam every time i see a problem i don't know how to solve i get a raging boner
You are best YouTuber I ever know... Such a saviour u are.
very good!!!!
What did the boar say to the ring ?..,This show is BOAR-RING!!!,.. see because it's boar ring sounds like boring....... Ok bye you'll never see me again.
So learning the hardest math problems makes you better at solving the easier ones which you didn’t understand
This was do helpfull i like math but i have always had a hard time learning it.
Photomath is also an amazing application which shows all the steps to solve most equations.
Is that even possible lmao
Reaches 9:40. Doesn't add 20 seconds of BS. Be like Thomas.
Believe me Tom when I say Data Structure and Algorithms only gets harder. I'm taking a course for it now!
Thanks but you lost me at 3:06
When I'm watching this video my brain feels empty it doesn't even hurt at all while thinking
Math is a love hate relationship for me.
i am soo afraid of mathe
wow your math is way easier than the math we in greece do the math that we learn in 3rd grade of high is your 2nd year at college

Thanks Frank you're amazing!!!!Especialy for Brilliant it helped me a lot
The summation problem is much simpler without breaking up the fractional exponent. You are only going to input 1, 2, 3, and 4. By inputting 1, there is no fractional exponent (2/1). Inputting 2, there is no fractional exponent (2/2 = 1). Inputting 3 leaves you with the cube root of the quantity 9n^2, which is a whole number (9). Inputting 4 gives you 2/4 as the exponent, which reduces to 1/2, which implies the square root.
Christ he's like the hottest man I've ever seen.. them frickin eyes .. I actually die for them ... he looks like a mixture between Jake Gyllenhaal and Justin Bieber xxx

I actually new most of this.. i was expecting something more unique...
Fck that i‘m giving up I‘d rather look for how to get better at „meth“
2 plus 2 is 4 minus 1 thats 3 quick mafs skrrrrra
Was that a monty python reference? ( 5:44 )
I think "practicing" is the key factor we need to master anything not only math.
Hi dad
Hey Thomas Frank! Here is a pretty cool article :The five-minute trick that helps Instagram’s CEO crush procrastination https://work.qz.com/999979/the-five-minute-trick-that-helps-instagrams-ceo-crush-procrastination/ Also tune in to our radio show, Girl Politics where we tackle burnout issues also making reference to some of your tips! Tune in on Emendyradio.co.za at 10:00 :)
practice + patrickjmt
PLEASE do a video of your current system, did you change anything from the last video you shown us about ur productivity system ?
Thanks brooo really appreciate ??
Sponsored by WolframAplha
oh look a video for everyone in this world.
TOM,PLEASE CAN U MAKE A VIDEO ON EVERY STUDY RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON STUDENTS' WORK ?
my marks just crush my confidence every week
Can you do a video on adults returning to college/students with full time jobs?
OMG Monty Python jokes too! I love this channel! Seriously helps me get a grip on uni and graduating. Also really crushing on Thomas, so win win, I'd say :D! (I mean, how can you not crush on a handsome fellow with Arkham Horror on his wall in a lot of the backdrops?)
Here I am, a freshman in highschool. I'm struggling with multi-step equations. But after seeing Thomas do all of that, I think I'm just going to give up. On my last reported card I had straight A's except for one b- in Algebra 1. I have always hated Math and I always will. But this doesn't mean I don't appreciate the help though. Btw , I love your videos, Thomas.
Hey thomas, can you do a video about how to stop being a slow learner? Thanks in advance .
A good idea for a video would be about commitment contracts (like the economic concept), but for personal goals. Kind of like the happiness project that BoyInABand did, but more geared towards college students and how to create your own commitment contract. Thanks!
I am so happy that I am subscribed to you
Another great video from youu :) thomas, can you also make video how to save and spending less money on college students pleaaasseee????
this video made me worse..
Yo Thomas can make a video for high school students?
0:07 its thermodynamic, not math but still a great video !!! :D
THANK YOU!
SOS! If you're reading this thank you! Please help I have health insurance and other dues I need paid to my college in order to sign up for classes! I need it in the next few days because spots for classes are going fast! Anything you can donate to help is a blessing! My gofundme link is down below and you can verify more information there! https://www.gofundme.com/6m4kept8
Hey. Great video. Can you also make a video on how to write/make a blog? Thanks. Great fan here. :)
Sorry Bruh but this video is full of mistakes. How can you deny that some people's brains are more math oriented? I don't have a math brain. I can prove this. I put more time in to studying then most of my classmates. But I'm failing. It takes me longer to grasp new math concepts. You telling me this is all in my head? Nah. On the flip side. I've always been a great writer. I've always received top grades and praise for my writing style. My flow. My use of Grammer and punctuation to say what I want to say and have it sound how I want to sound. Other people can't write well. Why can I? I never practice. I never write outside of what's needed for school. Why the hell am I good at writing with minimal effort!? My own life supports that your wrong with this. And I can back it up with life experiance and reasoning. I'm not just making things up. I don't have a math friendly brain and every single tutor in the schools tutoring center knows this because I'm always in there. Always getting tutored. But failing. Why? Since we have very different views on this, if your interested, I would be down for an actual convo about the topic. I also want to add that genetics plays a critical role in one's potential intelligence, proven in studies, and seen in Steve Jobs own autobiography. Have you read it? You should. There is most certainly math brains and non math brains my friend. On this one you are mistaken.
How about a video on how to keep praticing math as a hobby for those who aren't in school or actively studying it? In high school i used to love math but i chose a humanistic path for my studies and i realized just now, watching your video, how much i miss the challenge of it and also how much i struggled to even remember what a summation is or even the most basic concepts. Where should i begin again?
I think on the example the exponent should have been outside the square root... not 100% sure though
I failed Cal II last semester feeling depressed with a D. I'm taking it now, doing well, and recently got a 91 on a test. Honestly, you have to just practice the concepts as they come along and find the time to master or at least partially master it.
I've been watching this channel since i was in 8th grade, now I'm in 11th and i don't think i would have gotten the grades i do without this channel. GOD BLESS YOU I HAVE A MATHS ASSIGNMENT THATS BEEN KILLING ME RIGHT NOW AND I FEEL MUCH BETTER
Whats ur profession
fuqthis im stupid
I've found that Khan Academy is great for learning math conceptually.
Well that ship has sailed
That example... my god :O
i LIKE YOUR THINKING!
I used to use beilliant in middle school!!
I'm bad at maths but then again I might have never really tried to work it out... What I do know is that I learn new languages fast. I'm on my fourth language now and still drowning in maths lol. So, maybe there are maths, science, arts, linguistic people... But it's nice that everyone's unique because I always find it fascinating to watch my friends whizz through maths while I'm stuck or just trying to memorise the steps because I gave up at understanding ??????
Thank you so much! Posted right before my calc and non calc test????
Thomas... I want your help!?? I am following uncountable studyyoutubers just bc i don't want that any useful study tip left. I feel uncomfortable. I have save 350+ videos of study tips in watch later....idk how to recover them i don't have enough time to watch them. I'm insane. Please help me!!!!!! Some of study video are like same By different youtubers. And i ended up by wasting my timing. Hatsoff to me!
Today, I almost decided to stop studying computer science - because the math required for pursuing this major was just too hard for me and i lost motivation day by day. So thanks Thomas that you uploaded this video just in time! :)
I just got out of school and I did fairly well at math, I was probably in the top 10 percentile but the problem is that all of what I learned is kinda fading slowly and slowly as I find it very difficult to apply my knowledge in the real world.
Khan Academy is completely free, and it seems pretty similar to Brilliant, although there are super helpful videos that explain the concept step-by-step. :)
I fucking love math. I don’t like how they teach math in high school “just memorize this formula” instead of breaking down how the formula is built and why. I’m blessed to have a dad who is a mathematician so when I have a problem he just shows me exactly how something comes to be ??
who can help me with add math grade 11 igcse problems?
Can you give advise for physic?
this video was over after 40 seconds
Thomas ..Have you considered as teaching as a career option? ..Please do! coz you will a hell of a teacher and kids will love you.
I love your videos they're so inspiring and motivational
Thomas could you make a video named : How to stand idiots in your class.
I love math, it is my favorite school subject :)
Can you tell me if their is a websites for math word problems
Waiting for your next book and it is taking forever
That strand of hair though!
Photomath is free and explains steps. Just take a picture of your math problem!
It's like Frank can sense what I need at certain points of my life ??
Thomas ,I need guidance to become good at English grammar
5:58 math-ster the concepts... :D
How do you always know what exactly I need help in? Your videos precisely correlate with my life!
How do you intuitively understand harmonic average?
Thank you. I’m failing math and need this.
this dropped into my feed from the heavens. Math Final next week thx bb
The 42 gag was awesome
Thanks so much for this video man, great job and much needed. Electrical Engineering student here completing the pre-reqs, I.e, calculus, physics, chemistry.
Nice video Thomas!
A video in my birthday.... I'm feeling blessed
African or European?
i have exams in 2 weeks and am so scared for maths fml
Love from Bangladesh. Your videos are truly amazing....
Beard tutorial please.
I completely agree with you on this. I'm in my fifth semester now studying mathematics and at first I was really impatient and struggled a lot, but maths is just a muscle that you have to train, as any other muscle in your body if you want to get better
Wait African or European swallow?
I'm in Calculus 4 (multivariable calculus - quarter system, not semester if anyone is confused about the number) and a lot of how I got here was from diligently practicing math for at least two to three hours a day. Practing more makes you more effective at answering problems and helped relieve a lot of my test anxiety. Also, I found helpful videos by Professor Leonard (amazing lectures), PatrickJMT, and Michele van Biezen.
Honestly just practise and stop hating it. Idk why so many people are lazy to do that but make fun of "nerds" that actually work towards being better at something. The amount of bullying and mocking that studious people get subjected to in Western schools is so mind boggling, how tf are you people raised?
left brain and right brain is true
Dislike. Not even gonna See it! Maths are evil! :(
Sorry but this isn't helpful at all, just showing off your level of maths. Try doing something for someone who isn't at YOUR level of maths in general, instead of making your EGO bigger.
Pro tip: The Wolfram Alpha app can be bought on Android for a one time fee as oppose to the subscription fee on the website. You get most of the same features. Not sure about ios as I don't use Apple products. Great video!
Suffering from mathophobia...
if anyone here is looking for a youtube channel that teaches math. go search patrickJMT, he got me through a lot of math subjects
Good tips, I agree. I was however surprised that the whole "Find someone who knows how to do the problem you're having trouble with, make friendly with them, then pick their brain for how they approach that kind of problem" was not included at the end. That has been a very successful tactic for me when written resources and practice aren't enough. I don't know if you have done a video on how to find, and properly pick the brain of a skilled person, but if so I would love to watch it. I've noticed in chatting up my professors that the process of getting each to reveal the tips and tricks that make learning their material easier is different for each person, but there are some common elements in each interaction. Simple stuff like establish a good rapport, be friendly, make yourself useful, ask them to work through specific examples and ask them why they are doing what they are doing for each step of the process you don't understand. Thanks for the knowledge, +1 thumbs up to you Thomas Frank.
Probably the most perfect reference ever to Hitchhiker's Guide ??
2+2 is four, minus one thats 3 quick maths
2 + 2 is 4 - 1 that's 3. Quick math
Physics grad student here, this advice is genius! I'm totally gonna tell it to my students when I tutor :)
The only math I mastered revolves around counting money
Maybe you could do a video on how to get better at writing ?
A very interesting video -- thank you.
i'm an entrepreneur now at 21 and math is the only thing i miss in school .
Thank you Thomas!! This made me laugh a little.. made my day<3 the sum was cute!!! This is all very helpful!!
I hate math, I've always had issues with it. But thanks for this motivation!
I'm in Grade 8 And this just sounds like random gibberish to me XD
Mathematics is not only based on calculating , usually summation need a theoretical solution , or in the case  topology problems logic and geometrical imagination is the way , but it's Hard sometimes .
Fantastic video, great tips, really helpful. Thank you very much Thomas!!
I should watch this video when I was at school??
Thank you! Keep going!
Math definitely requires practice, you guys. It's no use understanding the theory if you can't apply it! Another good thing about doing practices is that certain types or styles of questions come up frequently (at least at junior/senior year highschool math) and by learning the correct approach to these problems, you're better able to handle them when tests come around. Always do practice exams if you can get access to them - not only are you testing your abilities under time limit, it also minimises your exam stress (in my experience). Caveat: if you don't understand the theory, get that sorted asap before bothering with lots of practice. You should try and clarify your doubts quickly before things snowball and your foundation becomes shaky. This is also why listening in class is important - it's way harder to figure things out on your own. You may have a not-great teacher like I do, but don't dismiss them as they may occasionally say some helpful things. If your teacher's not cutting it, don't complain - arrange for consultations (some teachers are better 1-1), look for additional math resources, or ask the resident math genius. The same amount of input in math generates more output than subjects like Literature. The key is to work hard at it. Regular practice has helped me bring my math grade from a 40% to a 75% over 1/2 a year, and math is one of my weaker subjects. Put in effort and you might just outperform the smarter kids who don't practice!
Thomas, you're a life saver with this video! Skill is the mark of a master. I will check out the resources you've provided, set aside more hours of practice, and go back as far as necessary in my math competency, before I move forward with more challenging math problems. Its going to take time, but I know the reward is worth it. I learned Mandarin Chinese, so my new approach towards math is going to be the same way; full immersion. It's the best way. Thank you Thomas and I watch all of your videos. It really helps me as a mature student at University and a data analytics / machine learning practitioner. Keep up the good work!!!
Summary- Understand and practice
The fact that I'm watching this when I'm at my final year of a maths degree is telling me something??
Being a math Student, I totally agree with all those tips. Talent and intelligence are not required. Effort is the key component to becoming good at math! Combined with an intuitive approach that will trigger your interest, you will soon be blown away by the things you can accomplish.
Hey, college math student here, and if it’s helpful, I’d add that if you do have to look up the answer to a problem, it’s not enough to understand it. Stop and take incredibly detailed notes on the correct solution. In these notes, you should be using more words than numbers; otherwise, you’re copying, not learning. Imagine you’re a professor, and you want to get your class to understand a problem, but rather than explain it in words, you’re passing out the solution. Then imagine the dumbest, most clueless student in your imaginary class. Write your notes for him. This seems way over the top, but it’s the best way to get everything you can out of a math book. It’s also a great way to start thinking with a proof-y mindset, and that’ll serve you well if you ever take more theoretical math courses.
Shame this video came out literally the day after my final maths exam
Jake Gyllenhaal and you were brothers, I guess
I think he is talking about Traditional Math, not the Common Core or the New Mathematics. Anyone correct me, if I misrepresent him.
Please deo one of these on computer science/programming!
I think he is talking about Traditional Math, not the Common Core or the New Mathematics. Anyone correct me, if I misrepresent him.
Thanks Frank
What is that background music??
can you please make a video on scholarships? please....
What you actually need is a good teacher and practice.
Thomas, how can I gain back my strength after a failure? Idk. I just always getting disappointed day by day. :'(
Who didn’t like this video ...seriously??? The only think that I can add to this is that Math IS a language, and should be taught like any other language while you are trying to understand it...that would make things a lot easier in your mastery process !!!
Maths is soooo fun!!!
Really liked the video.
M: mental A: abuse T: to H: humans
https://www.integral-calculator.com/ was THE thing i used to learn integration. I never found any good text books back then.
Hey Tom, great video! Can you please make a video on being able to solve college level physics and chemistry problems?
Lifesaving video...you summed it up better than any Math-solving tutorial out there. Great job, Tom!
Alright!
THANK YOU
Just ask an Indian.
“Asians are good at math” is probably my favourite stereotype. I’ve had friends who joked that addictive vices like smoking and drinking simply didn’t appeal to them because math was their own addiction.
media offline lol
Another tool could be malmath android app
How to revise topics that you have already studied
Sir Thomas, helloooo! I'm a loyal subscriber and loving your content at youtube and podcasts, as I'm still a high school student. I want to take Law for my Grad School, but I also want to work to be of aid to my family and to have an early career. It would be really great if you will make a video about being a working student in college, for aspiring CollegeGeeks like me to be inspired by you.
lol people really think math is only arithmetic and basic algebra
but i tho wanted to be da bestest at doing maths
How can i get better in java programming? #cig30day please any advice. ? I know you also study programming.
The first part to get better at Math is treating it as a friend and not an enemy. Most people hate it thus making them bad at it. This is how I got better at math because if you hate something you won't put the time and effort in it.
I was JUST looking this up on Google and couldn't find any answers. And then I come across this video... ??
Monty Python reference for the win
This video is 2 years late. But thanks
I couldn't stop looking at that perfectly placed hair down on his forehead. I bet he worked on getting that right. My hairline is too high, so I'm mirin. Nice video.
Too late, Tom. I needed this during High School.
42! Hitchhiker reference!
Lol. My first reaction to a math q is "niope". That's why I'm here. ??
Omg Brilliant is so adictive! Thank youu
What is the air speed velocity of a swallow? What kind of of swallow?
i don't know how i got in college :'(
Tom, your videos are amazing, but I suggest you talk a little bit slower.
Khan academy, 100% free and nothing comparable to it to learn math!
I now I know how to count :)
2 plus 2 is 4, minus 1 that’s 3. Quick maffs.
I think math is difficult not because of math itself, but because of the teachers who can't do their jobs properly.
The same day I was struggle with my maths work , you uploaded a video about it. Perfect timing , definitely feel more motivated. Cheers pal ????????????
If one wants to get better at math, one must first pronounce it like maths.
instructions unclear. im now a meth head
i thought i wasn't good at math but i guess it was just the teacher because last year my teacher didn't really explain everything or she wanted us to just know stuff like little formulas here and there but this year the teacher is really cool because she explains everything and builds from simple problems to more complex problems whereas my previous one just threw us in the dark and explained a little bit but then just went straight for the harder problem so i felt lost half of the time
Math was a subject I was really bad at during high school but fast forward to grad school and i'm teaching people math concepts, acing math assignments and have a new found appreciation for the subject. I think it boils down to the attitude you have towards the subject. If you go into it thinking 'I can't do this' then, well, you probably aren't prepared to do it. So take it from the girl who once stumped an entire classroom and the professor by solving a complex equation and ending with result where I proved 1 = 3, if I could improve my math skills from that stage, i'm sure you can too!
Beautiful. Now how the hell do I get better at physics?
Most math makes no sense at all. It's not about being difficult…more like not understanding the context behind a math problem, "why is this important?"
I spent 2-3 hours everyday for almost 2 years to try to understand additional math in high school. Sadly after all that, my teacher told me to quit because it might bring the rest of my grades down by concentrating on it too much. I guess I just don't get it?
This was worth the two week wait
Just noticed you have a Castlevania Order of Ecclesia poster. Love that game! Great rundown video and mentally encouraging on getting to grips with mathematics!
Sadly I'm already studying too advanced math to find a solution on Symbolab. I just keep getting "currently there are no steps for this solution)
I'm actually a math teacher =) Great tips in this video. There's always some problems we can't solve. And guess what, we do basically what you said here. Also, Polya's book is a classic. I recommend it to everyone interested in problem solving.
Well I think before you start practicing it's really important to understand what you're doing, especially if it's a method/concept within math you haven't worked with before. Then you can practice by applying it to different kinds of problems. (btw math is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it guys don't stop practicing!)
I will have to write you a thank you note, sir. I have been following your channel for quite some time. The reason is that I have found most of what I need in the tips you give here. I'd like to tell you initially that I think you are heading in the right direction as far as helping others get the most out of studying goes. And I know a lot of people who subscribe to your channel agree with me on that. So I'd like to thank you and especially encourage you to keep up the good work. Best regards.

Excellent video!.. and very handsome man, wow!
Math is super duper easy. Just look at the solution sheet, or type into wolfram alpha.
kumon!
Actual practical answer :just watch rick and morty ..
Helpful video as usual But I am a math major and unfortunately all we do is memorizing tons of proofs and algorithms We barely solve any problems
you got no friends
I'm actually going to use these tips. Thank you<3
4^(3/2)=4^(1+1/2)=4*4^(1/2)=4*2=8
I’m on my third year of Chemical Engineering. Math has become a combination of memorizing and understanding concepts(and really complex). A really good think to realize about math is that there is a limited amount of ways to solve a problem. The number of solutions are not infinite and usually in school they only have a handful of ways they want you to know how to solve problems. Use this to your advantage! Math won’t be as intimidating!
The day after I dropped my math course ????. It's ok! This is still useful because I'm taking it next semester!
Use photomath on your phone. It's free. You can take a picture of the equation and it will give you the answer step-by-step
I suck at Statistics but you make me want to master it because your cute!
I think that the biggest mistake when studying math is to think that you are learning how to solve a particular problem, because math is about pattern recognition, and that is something that a lot of people is great at naturally, but that doesn't mean that they don't work hard on learning it. When you repeat a type of exercise the first few are going to be hard, but the more you keep doing them, the more you will realize how that pattern is and how to solve it the next time. There are no shortcuts in math, because shortcuts will hurt your learning curve when having to solve difficult problems. Great video, as always. Sorry for my English, but I hope that my message got across.
Hey Thomas! I like your channel a lot, but this video doesn't have the same depth that you usually put in prior videos. You can get way better at math if you achieve some form of visual intuition to the mathematical concepts. A lot of the concepts in, say calculus, can be explained in visual/geometric terms (Check out the 3blue1brown series on calculus or Welch Labs on imaginary numbers). Also, you could talk more about what you are currently doing on brilliant.org after you 're finished. When someone tries to apply mathematical skills to programming, you can achieve a better appreciation to why you need math in the first place. Programming is a really good exercise in improving your math (and physics if you make a mock particle physics engine).
if you want to be good at math : > Stop telling yourself you're bad at math and stop saying "hahahah so me" when you see a dumbass meme like "i'm 25% funny 85% bad at math" >Instead, practice, focus, believe in your skills, make mistakes, learn how to correct them, eventually you'll get good. Know that it is at everyones reach to be good at math. Goood luck ^o^
In my country have a national test called ENEM, you need to do 45 exercices of math and other more 45 exercices of natural sciences in just 4:30 hrs or 3 minutes per question. I want to improve in mathematics but this methode to valute if i have the right to study in a public university looks discouraging.
i use calculator (for every thing)
Simple. Watch Rick and Morty
Great video Thomas! Keep up the great work! Your content is inspiring and unbelievably helpful!! Huge fan!
I don't know why but I'm slow at performing elementary calculations involving addition/sub/multiplucation/div in my head but for some reason, I can perform integration and higher mathematics in my head faster than the former. Does anyone else have this problem?
hey i had a maths mock earlier
I just did my maths exam on Thursday.... :(
I'm going to law school but why not study math am i right
I was literally doing my math homework when I got the notification. Had to wait till I finished to watch it
2 words, Professor Leonard.
Best timing ! I’m having some trouble with math, hope that will change.
Should've used square brackets to show that both the terms fall under summation. Most people will evaluate the summation of the first term and then subtract that by 6.
2 + 2 = 4 - 3 is 1 quik mafs
SERIOUSLY THOMAS HOW DO YOU POST AT THE PERFECT TIMES
Great video! Do you have any advice on how to study and not get bored or lose focus?
Thank you so much Thomas! :D
I'm good at math, but because I love math, I clicked on the video anyway ??
Perfect. Timing. Thank you :)
This is a well made video, but still not super helpful. Then again this is above my pay grade. I never mastered fractions. I also never mastered multiplication or division.
I am currently doing an A-level in maths and an AS in further maths. Here are a few tips that I've learnt over the years: - If you're in a maths class and you find that you just aren't getting it, don't jump to the conclusion it's your fault. You might just not understand that teacher. The only reason I'm getting good grades now is because my teacher at GCSE and first year A-level used a teaching style that I responded too. So in this situation you could benefit from looking for another maths teacher to go through that topic with you. - I find its best not to jump straight to Wolfram Alpha or Symbolab when you're stuck. I find its better to go on a forum page like student room as there are a bunch of people there who can help, even if they don't have that exact maths problem (they WILL have similar). Sometimes the best teachers are your peers. - Khan Academy is another great website. They have tons of videos on a range of topics for all levels of understanding. - As Thomas said, practice is the only real way you'll get better. My teachers recommended we do an hour of revision a day for each subject plus the homework. I will admit that I don't actually know a single person that does this but the idea that you need to revise little and often is still valid. You could come up with a little plan for this revision time. I like to go through the homework and do all the questions that look easiest first then work my way through the harder ones. This puts you in a good mindset for the rest of the time. It's like when you're training to run a marathon, you increase the distance gradually. In the end it is practice using the correct resources and challenging yourself. You also need to try and relax before hand and know when to step away from a problem and come back to it later. I do this in all my tests and exams. If I can't reach an answer in a set time (no.marks = no.minutes) then I fold the corner of the page and carry on. This means I don't waste time or become too frustrated. Hope this helped.
Doing an Economics degree taught me the hard way everything you detailed in this video. Maths is a grind, but can be made easier by understanding what parts of the equation confuse you and doing an easier equation based on that thing.
An important distinction to make is that this video covers how to get better at school math. Everything Tom said was true to school math; however, math is is a vast subject. In fact, math is the study of structure, everything has structure. Math, in a sense is the discovery of the structures in the rules of math. So the distinction is between getting better at adjusting to the notation and conventions of certain sub fields of math (school math), and understanding the big picture of the structures derived from simple mathematical rules that are not attached to notation and convention. This comment doesn't have much to do with the video I just thought it would be a good opportunity to give the definition of math.
Wolframalpha has a cheap app thats like the fire stolen from the gods
Thanks for the video!! Very informative!!
there is an app(android ,I dont know about IOS) that can do what sympolab do but a lot easier called photomath https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microblink.photomath
The best way to get better at math Is to do math I was at a point where I couldn't write a thing other than my name on a test but then I realized that I have to try to understand my situation and change the way I deal with it after 5 months of maths and chill ???? I had the first place on my final exam on it . It was emotional it's like a potential test for ones abilities.thank you Thomas for providing us with your amazing work.
Funny how this came just after I fucked up on a maths exam. It's probably a sign...
I liked the video before watching because I know it’s good :3
Hey man! Awesome video! You are helping me here in Brazil! Success
A: "I'm terrible at math." B: "Why do you think that?" A: "I did one practice problem and I didn't find the answer in ten seconds" B: "How did you try to solve the problem?" A: "I wrote down the problem and stared at it and the answer didn't come to me"
i love THOMAS!!!!
hit like when u like thomas' little hair on his forehead
perfect timing as we're doing trig with radians in math right now xP
Hey Thomas, I would really like to hear your opinion on a thing called polyphasic sleep. With a polyphasic sleep system you try do reduce your sleeping time as much as possible by cutting your sleep in smaller chunks (idealy 6x 20 minutes per day). The concept behind this is that your body/brain adapts to this and then starts the sleeping with the Rem phase and you cut down on nonRem sleep. Do you think this is a good/beneficial way to get more time and being able to do more things per day? Looking forward to your response and as always great video :)
Thomas i dont know how to thank you , you man have changed my life , you improved me in school I become a lot better than 2 years ago Not just school but my whole life I had achieved a lot of my goals I became more confident next year is my last year in high school wish me luck , again thank you so much for helping me the past two years
If the numbers are too big you aren't doing "real" math :D
When you just got to know that you failed math and you see this video the second after....
I saw the thumbnail and decided to watch this after I just took a math test.
Mathway.com?
Great vid. I've used khan academy in the past.
Lovin' the outro music Tom! Oh... yeah, the content's pretty great too.
perfect! just in time! i’m about to fail an algebra exam on monday :D
I love math and find most of it easy once I get the concept however I hate things like My Math Lab because all it does it tell me I got it wrong. It’s a bit irritating. Especially how sensitive the program is lol
how did you know that I was thinking of suggesting this on your previous video and all of a sudden I see a notification in bottom right corner how to get better at math.
Wow are you serious ? I always thought people said that as an excuse, I literally cannot understand how you can not understand math
This entire video was like advanced Japanese for me. I don't speak Japanese.
Read "A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)" by Barbara Oakley, Ph.D.
Practice, practice, practice..
Why am I here I love maths EDIT: I'm still shite at it though
Is that an African or European swallow?
Love you
Quick tip, psychologie suggets the middle of your head should not be in the middle of the screen but a little higher vertically, something like 1/3 the way from the top of the screen and the bottom should be shoulders and body. A floating head looks unnatural, because in real life, when you look at someone's head, you always see a body in the bottom of your vission. Hopefully this will help make your videos a little bit better.
2+2 is 4 4-3 1 quick math (the ting goes skrra)
Before my lunch break started, I got stuck on multiple problems on my practice test This video COULD NOT COME at a more perfect time!
Literally yesterday was the final maths test I will ever do in my life.
I literally cannot get better at math. I'm amazing at it. It's always been my best subject.
Add an 's'
I wanna sit on your face
thank God for thomas frank lol
My parents knew practice would make me better at maths and they made me do several pages of maths every day and I would cry each time i had to do it(i was 8-11 and hated maths). It just made me hate maths even more. Only until not doing so much maths at home and just learning it at school did I improve.
Roses are red Violets are blue There will always be an Asian that is better than you
I have a mock exam on Monday perfect timing Thomas
Thanks Thomas! ??
just what I need
Loved George Polya's quote: "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem that you can solve: find it." This is advice that can be carried over into all aspects of problem solving. Great wisdom, and great video!
In my 9th grade my teacher taught differentiation,continuity with iit problems which is the hardest exam in india and 8th grade they taught us integration to a extint and im in 10th grade and I still don't know why they taught these complex things this early
I dream of a day when people watch the video before commenting! I dream of a day when the discussion has something to do with the video! Fuck you guys -- Cartman --
I was Scratching on Math AND YOU JUST UPLOADED LOVE YOU THOMAS I was watching you for 3 years STILL High School :D
Watch Professor Leonard and thank me later
What baffles me the most is that people think of sciences as subjects to study hard for. Except for math, you have to have some sort of talent for it which is completely not true.
Im already good at it?? u miring?
The key to being good at math really on any level is (for the most part) practice ... the genuises might need less of it than you, but they need to practice a whole fucking lot nevertheless :D
Love math and love you
FIRST
Early
Ask an Asian
Perfect timing
Great content. Thank you. What software are you using to use this board?
not bad good job one hour and three hours your not only helping yourself you helped us alot thanks
I'm in 4
10 time 10 equal 100 plus10 equal110
I need to take an entrance exam, I hope this helps me with the "basic math" since they don't provide examples
Wow thanks a lot “ am going to learn the way you teach so I can help my child “ ????????
This ain't basic smh
Who else is hear about to or is studying for ASVAB?
watch this https://youtu.be/wpED2Hhi410
Thanks buddy
Yes I went 31 minutes and write a lot notes plus I did the multiplication table in my notebook 8×12 . I need to do it 12×12 I when I wake up I am going to take a nap then the Gym later to night I'll the 12×12 and would Continue tomorrow at work
I AM STARTING LEARNING MATH BECAUSE I WANT TO GO COLLEGE MAN I AM 28 YEARS OLD I WANT START IN MARTH 2019 . I AM TELLING YOU I FORGET EVERYTHING I KNEW . MATH, GRAMMAR YOU NAME IT I JUST BARELY TALK MAN I THINK I HAVE A SHORT MEMORY. Thanks man may my God bless you. I am going to subscribe in your channel subscribe in my too it is under construction
Excellent tutorial! I have an undergrad degree but once in a while a refresher is needed.
I just want you know thank you so much, I will be going to the library and watching your videos to help me pass my accuplacer for college in nursing in math, arithmetic, and pre algebra , thank you ??????
You are amazing. Much better than my school teacher. Thank you very much!
Nice video but the audio level is too low.
Ya im late and i hate math...this makes it harder for me....
You’re good
Very beautifully done, thanks
Awesome vid tjanks
I get sidetracked so easily my mind starts thinking about dumb shit ????
mark wahlberg teaches basic math
him:what would you do without a calculator me: I'd get one.
I'm sorry I can't understand it but the little bit of it I understand thank you.I need to learn math because I'm gonna challenge in math:O
I love the way he explains...keep it up.
You sound like mark wahlberg. But I’m not complaining. This was an excellent beginner for me. Thankyou ??????
Osm video bro my mths is weak
Excellent, thanks
which software u r using for making videos
very helpful.
i want to die
Holly shit i never understood algebra! You just changed my life! Can't brlieve it's that easy
I used after 40
I appreciate your efforts of this long video of math
thank you for explain math that easy !!
I still don’t get it
Math quiz bee tomorrow Wish me luck!??
one question I want to ask here that why minus into minus (-*-) is equal to plus why? could you please answer this, please
hey jg your tutorial is really appreciable thanks for making this..
Thank you so much
Thanks
ILOVEYOU
ASMR
i love this
Dude, thank you, my teachers are fucking shit at school. I was never really taught maths as a child, I don’t know why but I just wasn’t (it probably went through one ear and out the other) but, yeah. All I really want to do is pass maths, nothing special but really, thank you! These are all the subjects I have difficulty on.

Great channel i gona be the math teacher on monday
Great!
Thanks for this! I need to take a prerequisite test before I enter a medical program and I haven't been in school in 3 years so I forgot all of this.
Hey how come negative 9-4=13 ? When I do it it comes out negative 5 ? Can anyone explain this ? It's on 6:20
How do I know when and how many 0s to cancel out during division?
Question at 7:05..What if its a (+)(-)=
34:00 why not just do 2x14 and multiply the answer by 10?
Finaly a good math video
oooooooooook.... I have no problems understanding and solving logic problems, but for some reason I never learned to deal with basic math in the proper way. It's been a while... 3 decades since I was supposed to learn that stuff in school, but I never got the hang of it. I always knew I could, since I definitely got the brains for it, but somehow it just didn't click. As an adult I figured I'd start getting the hang of it. When you got videos like this, it's easy to follow along at your own tempo. Like the multiplication table.... That was hehe - sad to say - iluminating for me here in this video. I know a lot of it by heart, but nobody ever told me what the point of learning it as a table is all about. When dude in the video says it's important to draw it up yourself coz you will see a pattern I thought, what pattern is that... I always had problems multiplying larger numbers in my mind. Nobody told me to draw the table and look for the pattern. Patterns I can do. Didn't take me more than 10 seconds looking at the table, realizing I no longer have any of those large numbers quickly. Unfortunately, the school systems do not have the know-how or possibility to pick each individual's brains to know what makes them tick, and how they learn stuff the most efficient way - that is the most optimized way for everyone - to learn in a way that make you understand it. For me on the table, it was the hint that there's a pattern to it (which I never thought of, because I gave it up in a young age, just accepting that it is pure memorizing that is needed, and it's really not what I'm best at haha). What the school systems and it's teachers could do a lot better tho, is to come up with ways that makes each and everyone pick their own brain to see how it works. I've had a math tutor once, when I was a lot older than the kids learning this are. Was an elderly math teacher. And I gave that up after just a couple of sessions with her, because she spoke a language I didn't understand at all. I told her, look I'm here to learn this, but you're starting on a level way above mine, and I simply do not understand it. I understood it when walked through it, but moments later, it was pretty much lost in confusion. I figured it was so because I lacked the basic knowledge - tried to tell her, but she simply didn't understand how to react to it. Enough incompetent and impatient teachers out there that's teaching in ways that just do not reach the students - at all. Many are extremely smart, and know a lot, but that does NOT make them good teachers. Many times the problem is even as basic as I don't understand the words and expressions used in the problems and teaching. I really wish I had picked up on this earlier on - gotten a tutor back when I was in school etc. I'm sure that would've helped a lot. However - it's not too late for anything I guess :). Now youtube can be the tutor.
anything times 1 is itself anything times zero is zero
this 6 grade boy doesnt want to watch basics
Thanks for this great video :) relearning math at the moment.. ^^ ???
perfect video for those who wants to learn maths.
Great video, however...if you're going all the way back to basic math, you're going to fast. No explanation on placement in long division? If someone were to learn math from this, they would be asking why is there a decimal put in this place? Again great video, but I think explanations could have been used more. Thanks
very nice, good job
Thanks Mark Wahlberg :)
the 183 dislikes are some students XD
Si toi aussi t en dnl maths...
Math Is something i struggled with always. I graduated 5 years ago and I'm going to start college soon and thinking about math gives me anxiety watching your videos helps a lot I need to walk small section a day or I my brain will spin that's so annoying I love math but I cant do it like if I would be good at it I would love it
Good job brother
Where is the other two parts of this video? Please i just need to learn the basics. Anyway this is awesome. I would be more thankful if you repost the other two parts of this video. Thanks sir.
Your the best you actually helped me
This is so calming it helps me and how can someone dislike this
Amazing video!! Thank you
hi
I've always hated math. Not because it was hard, but because I just hate numbers. But this is good. I'm told I put to much detail in my deep thought, I say why leave shit out. Missing detail is flawed conclusion.
This guy mumbles! And speaks quickly at the start!
Thanks ??
Thank YOU SO MUCH FOR THE BEST VIDEO
thanks this improves my grades alot from f to c-a
He kinda sounds like casually explained.
How far does the course cover i'm currently enrolled in engineering and really need to refresh my self with some math man so all this is amazing help.
This isn’t how I remember arithmetic minuses, when I was in elementary 7 - 10 = 3, and not -3. I mean the teacher said that it was right, was I doing it wrong the whole time (damn teacher)!
when we have -5-4 isn't it equal to = 9 ? because (-)+(-)= +

in Japan same
How do you no mathematics
THE INTERNET SLOWLY REPLACING SCHOOLS
Can you do a video to what to cover on the asvsb please and thank you. I would really appreciate it
Please share the link of next basic level
???????? very nice
-14 - -16= -2 You subtracted from the larger number? because i was totally lost but i got the answer. 17:55/1:2:08
I'm 19 years old, in high school I hated math because I thought I just wasn't smart enough and so didn't bother to improve myself. I passed classes mostly by cheating because I could get away with it. I'm in college now and I felt like I wasted my time in high school and so decided to pick up math again, after watching this video I just found out and realized that it wasn't that I wasn't smart enough but to be honest with myself it was actually because I didn't have a strong foundation on the basic and was just intellectually lazy. Thank you so much, this video opens up so much opportunities to better understand math and study it further.

THX FOR HELPING ME! :D
This was life changing
best tutor/teacher ever helped me learn so fast
I'm way behind in school. I'm at a 6th grade level and I'm going into high school. This helped so much
This is what I need for the ged ready and GED test. I know I'll get this in do time it's in order to get it rite all the time.
Way too many topics to cover in one video
I’m only here because my IQ is only 63 so I think it’s time from me to start using my brain ?? because honestly I don’t think as much as other people do.

Thank you so much, this really refreshed my mind a lot.
Isnt there or shouldnt there be some kind of mark next to a minis or a negitive so they are different when next to each other so its understood the difference between the both or is it that there are no other instances where you would get both a minus and a negitive next to each other so the understanding would always be that the line before the number is always (negitive) and the line after a number is always minus. Is this correct ? Thanks
thank you so much
Thank you
I am going to use this, for school and try to see where i get to, hope i will impress my teacher.
Hi. I want to know how do you make this video?
Ac hpat
Can i become a Mathematician at 35? the last time i did Maths was when i was doing grade 9
Thank u for the 1:12:08 of ur life. Helpfull for me, i can teach the basics i fergot to my daughter.
great vid i want to learn because im going to highschool we enrolled yesterday
How are we suppose to get there without Google
I'm only in 1st grade lol
cant have fun, but i can have this shit
there. u like that? is that better? watching this shit?
who made this shit up? wtf is this? whats it gonna do for me in the real world?
At 21:10 What is 14-16 ? A negativ number but how do I calculate?
It sucks
Oh my G is so great i want to say thanks a lot for the videos..GOD BLESSING MAY U PLEASE BLESS THE LECTURES
This should help me sleep this and a book
Dude, You ROCK!!!
Thank you! This was so helpful ????
This video is helping me already ! I have an Entrance exam for the College I’m applying to. Its a Math/English test on Monday and this is helping me refresh my memory thank you !! Let’s hope I pass ! ??
Helped a lot !!!
Very good
I'm here to learn math because i want to teach my son, I'm not at good when I was young
Thanks man your awesome. You taught me better than my teacher
I assume from your voice that I am a Few years older, I am sad that I only Found your posts now. Know that you truly make a difference in peoples lives! Thank you for your effort. It doesn’t go unnoticed!
Man, I struggled with math my whole life, ur tutorial is comprehensive and more important to me. Not judgemental, thank you.
Trying to get better at math for ASVAB but I have ADHD and could never focus in school
I'm 29 and trying to get over my math phobia so that I can actually go to school, so this has been very helpful, thank you!
Hello im Green raven today i will be Explaning substitution.The substitution method solving Linear systems A way to solve a linear system algebraically is to use the substiitution method.The substitution method functions by substituting the one y-value with other.We're going to Explain this by using an example Y=2c+4/3c+y=9 We can substitute y in the second equation with the frist equation since y=y. 3c+y=9/3c+(2c+4)=9/5c+4=9/5c=5/ac+1 This value of x can then be used to find y by substitution 1 with x e..9 in the first epuation./y=2c+4/y=2.1+4/y=6 The solution of the linear system is (1,6). you can use the suvstitution method even if both equations of the linear system are in standard form.just begin by solving one of the equations for one of its variables. Thank you for reading hope this helps you on substitution Subscribe to me and like if this helps you : )
hi , i want to purchase the full video, kindly suggest the way to go ahead.You can also email me on :v.rishiwal1@gmail.com
what is the application used to make such videos...?
Wao........:-) am doing great now in math. Thanks a million Sir
Dude, your're an awesome instructor!
I'm at 23:44! It's my second time coming here. I can only watch aprox. 12 min in one go before my mind starts spinning around. I'm taking a break again. I''ll be back later or tomorrow. I must finish watching this video! I will not give up! Thank you for teaching me!

thank you very much for making math easier , i never liked math in school anyways , would you please explain more the division part thank you very much
Thank You Sir. You must be the best teacher on the planet. Angry teachers unliked the video. haha
not bad.
OMG I'm going back to school soon i feel soooo dumb math has been so hard for me i will try my best thank you so much for this video wish me luck i have to get smarter than i am now ??
Kill it with fire god please
How can you use a whole number, factions, and decimal problems. Like 12+ 15÷3×6-4 =?
I want to improve math skills!
I like this guy's voice

Awesome video, thanks. I somehow escaped math in my life. But always wanted to really know it. Thanks a lot for keeping it simple and easy.
Every time i learn math or refresh my math - I learn something new (interesting)
a number is divided by 6 minus -3 gets 12. find the number
it helped me
Who finds this? : Two identical circles with radius of 6 cm are touched from the outside at the point T. If the two circles have a common touch, find the area of ??the split part.
thank you sir love from India ??????????????????
I hate math but i gotta do before i get held back before i get dumn ????????????
M.A.T.H Mental abuse to humans

thanks for the help it actually helped me at school
Hi guess who it is  clue: one of your students  answer: ME lol
I reported this for child abuse ??????
thanks
I had a bad seizure when I was young and forgot whatever math I actually knew. Relearning everything is going to be difficult.
Thanks so much for the video tutorial, please which software or device is used to create such audio-visual simulation? uwa.ada@st.futminna.edu.ng hope to hear from you
Dam it, why did I go to basics when I need to learn algebra?!??
the last portion of the video is just amazing... even for those who are in colleges and for everyone this is very helpful .. thanks man you are just doing a great job
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtF4uh1ZkHR-SRLXLhahdA hello dosto maths 12th class tutorials by RD Sharma book ka lia iss channel ko subscribe karia almost every topic covered from the RD Sharma book. Baas guys apka saath chaiya
Thank you so much. I'm using this for my ASVAB test.
Guna take a break.. It's the timestable that annoys me. I used to sit there as a kid going over and over and over trying to memorise it but i simple cant attain it. All the other math seem logical up to this point and im frustrated i need to cheat and look back at my written up timestable sheet. Most adding adding and subtracting will always come back to the bloody timetable :(
you're really spoonfeeding this to us, aren't you? And that's just how we need it! Public teachers be damned for their impatience! (well most of them anyway).

Great vid. Thank you so much.
This is such a great video. I'm learning a lot. Thank you!!
Wow you broke my adding lol
I really just suck at math I wish I was home school
Thank you¡ you vídeo is the Best. You make Math so easy.
My reason of learning math is not handling money, not how much your using but to be ahead of everyone i school and help me with coding.
God says people are born with special ability's, one of mine was definitely math and god never said that.
Holy shit. This is amazing! thank you for making this! I've got it on 1.25 speed and I'm learning more, quicker, than I ever did in school. The reversing subtraction thing at 22:30?? Why didn't anyone tell me I could do this?? XD
is this Mark whalberg? lol
Thanks
You have helped a 27 years of age man from Caracas, Venezuela start to defeat a long time frustration. Thank you!
soon ill be a mommy..i want to teach my baby math, thank u for the video
keep posting videos...... you are saving me. I need to pass my asvab test with higher grade and math is the issue plus reasoning. God help me
why are you canceling zeros in the division, and how do you know how many to cancel out and when?
This is a fantastic re-education video series, I want to see how far I can take this. Thanks for a great series and give and give us more.
helps me alot for the asvab i subscribed ????
I get a lot of inspiration to draw when I'm bored, so here I am....
this is so helpful
quite helpful
thank u for this. but i think if u were my math teacher i would probably fell asleep. Sorry just saying
Im a junior in highschool, and Im not completely awful at math, but I tend to forget the basics, so this will be a good reminder for me.. Thanks!
god bless you always sir u know what I have two kids and until now I don't know how to solve multiplication and division and I always wonder what if the times come that my kids ask me about this??? so I can't answer them,,but now you help me a lot thank you thank you so much.. I always pray for you.. thank you very much for making this video
tnk u so much
I'm a homeschooling mom, we've looked at and tried several math curricula, and my kids get more out of your vids than anything else!
Love your method, Thanks!
I am 7 year old and it hard
Happy to learn Algebra from TOCT. Very good tutor. It is always good to learn new things and to review those you learned a long time ago. Thanks, great teacher!
It has been 40 years since I was in a math class. I do appreciate your lessons. I need to relearn Algebra and your voice keeps me calm. thanks.
Love this so helpful
Why math important?
Thank you for all the effort you put in to create such wonderful and helpful videos! Your videos mean so much to me!!
what to doe?
next video Please hurry through lectures latter
what software do you use
I like it
S O F TA N DN E A T
recently decided to start learning maths again and thought id start from the absolute basic, your method of teaching is great
There are people born to understand math. And, I'M not one of them.
how do I see the instructor
do this 4,0000 ÷ 7, 0000
my dad's is mad at me for my math score. it is 49 thats ln f.
what's 2 multiple 100
thanks for the video i need yr4 maths to my son of 9yrs.
This is really helping me with my studies...they never explained it like this in school...i've watched 3 videos now and every step helps. Thanks :)
you did something wrong 5+11 is 16 lol not mad tho you did good
Hey man, can you enable the translations? I want to translate some of your videos, thanks. :)
Which software you use to make video like this? Suggest me any Input hardware you use like digital pen to write maths equations?
is so easy guys wooooo!
wow nice i m lerned dis video is great
i love math i know that 10 times 10 eaquals 100
How can someone dislike this???
I want to say thank you for this video. I have never been good at math, but feel empowered to learn after watching just  the beginning of this video. I'm excited! Thanks!!!!
thanks
I need this knowledge I'm weak in this subject.
this is great! thanks, this is exactly what I am looking for.
how to learn math without someone teaching you to?
Thank you SOOOO much for this video
a'm still in high school and I like mathematics
Thank you so much this really helped ;)
thank you for making a great video
wow man am 31 and I dropped out of school I never knew people teach in YouTube I always wanted to learn math
great and easy way of teaching thanks please don't stop do more I am ready to learn b\c I am interesting for maths but I don't have idea thanks a lot Baye men
thank you for all your work
I discovered how to add double digit numbers on my own, and I dunno how to explain it.
thank you for show this video it is helpful
I like math
You are not carrying one you are moving the ten to the tens place.
This have really helped me thank you ????????????????????
which soft have you used buddy ? i just wanted to create such videos in my regional lauange
Kiddo tips.... LoL.....????????????
ya school system ha kya agar school system ha tu adress bata de
I think it may be easier for some to do it the old way. Everyone is different.
https://www.facebook.com/tilakraj.rathod.1/videos/1820547424705354/
What software did u used?
thank you so much
nice video :)
Not mind blowing. This is developed naturally as a student matures their math skills.
very nice??
Abacus is easy, take "know the abacus" app and complete your self and your kid and try to teach & learn as many as you can.
Thank You so much it will help me alot!
This was very helpful and amazing.??
My son can do math in his head. The issue is that teachers want the kids to show their work the way they teach it to them ,(problem solving the old way).
84+25 =109
You definitely made this more complicated then it had to be. The old way is more more efficient. I'm not even good at math but this is some common core shit you're teaching.
Tk
This is stupid, you’re just double adding in mind. Rather than the old way. Whoever did the new method is taking the long hard way
This is very helpful
WHICH APP IS THIS ?
Outlaw this method of math
The warp speed hand is doing my head in
My kid is homeschooling and this is the way they are teaching math to my kid, I have been trying the old way but I am just confusing her! Are they teaching the tens way in schools now this days? It worries me cause she may go to school next year and if she is learnig with the tens method at home she is gonna be totally lost. She is a first grader.
I think you're making it more difficult. If you're adding 49 + 76, the easiest way to do it would be, 40+70=110+9=119+6=125.
Your illustrations make a simple procedure confusing.
Very cool
And also IndySow please teach us on how to do subtraction and addition mentaly
Thank you so much! Because I am very bad maths now when I add I will check my answers using this method thank u very much u make additions easier.
Butt
Meh........k
This is how I've instinctively learned to do it, and I could do math in my head real easily since school age. When I had to do it the "classic" way on paper for a test, however, I always struggled to do it. The idea of "adding the numbers backwards" always felt alien to me.
So the way we teach maths in Australia is fucked then
Hello, Could you please tell me what software you used to make this vedio?
??????????
Not the best
Thanks Pavel. Your method is also so quick and easy
i taught myself this on school TO help me speed me up when taking tests. my hand writing was sloppy, but this way I can visualize it in my head. personally I think all math should be taught visually, but introduced on paper/pencil first- to solidify it in your head.
Good
Mindblown.
Hi. If you want to be prepared for this check Unflexal website. I know you'll find good solutions for your workouts.
I know tow
i am 10 years old and struggling math thank you so much!
Nice
Very HLPFUL OH GOSH
It was very good
Make some for 2nd grade
I find the old way better.Plus they don't tech kids this way.
Nice video. It is very good. Please find here also similar video with similar topics on basic level https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcs40TNky0M&t=1s

l lov3d it..thanku school on wheels.???
Nice ?? thank you!
Why am i 11 and already know this....BECAUSE IM IN SINGAPORE AND SINGAPORE HAS THE HIGHEST SCHOOL SYSTEM..
if it is written or i can visualize it on a paper. i can easily use your trick. but when it is all in my head only.. it seems that i forgot some of the numbers...
New fun math game for everyone try it out for free!!!!!!!! Android : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OneTapp.TestYourMath&hl=en Apple: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1205325359
Here's a NEW method, this one is the fastest. 33+49, well 49 is just 50-1, so let's do 33+50 to get 83 then subtract 1, get 82. DONE! Now that was FAST. Now that took me about a minute or less to explain, but with practice, you can do problems like that in just couple of seconds. In the second example 27+46, do 30+46 get 76 then subtract 3 and get 73. Or do 27+50 get 77 then subtract 4 and get 73 that way. That's the beauty of mathematics is that you can do same problem lots of different ways and you always get the same answer.
Stupid, stupid, and stupid....bring back the old teachers.
This is vedic maths
love it
This helps me a lot for my math test tomorrow
10x10 is 100
678-456=200?
Thanks a lot, I'll share this to my daughter.
im going to second grade
This was very helpful.  I am an adult with many years of borrowing and not knowing how to add big numbers in my head.  I will try this and teach to my kids.
This video is basically about the Partial Sums method.
thanks for the math you gave me straight A+ thanks.??
Why am I faking watching this Calculators !!!
My method for solving this: I round the number closest to a 10 to that 10. Hard to explain, but on 33 + 49 I would add 33 + 50. This gives you a much easier number to work with in your head, then after you do that just subtract one from the sum.
Check this addition based math grid game for android phones which I think can help kids/adults develop and test fast mental calculation skills: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.myapp2.ali_r.ADDUP
You are awesome!
from class 1990'sI have to come here and learn all again and then teach my third grader the new way.
Why is 100 in the tens ?? That part got me confused!..
Thanks for this ! Very Helpful :DD
hi indySOW I did not get your video can you post another way that could be easy for me to understand thank you
it is ok if i use your video for my project?
Hi Ms Indysow I teach my son the old methods. but this mental addition you teach it's very clear and easy understand I hope you will post more videos thanks.
Hi Ms Indysow can you teach me about mental subtraction. thank
Your method drives my students crazy.  I show them the quote old way, it becomes clean, easy and efficient.  The new method is a pain - I refuse to introduce it.  There is nothing wrong with paper and pencil, and the old methods.
Blessed!
Cute video- Great showing these tips!
This is so helpful. Thank you
I honestly wasn't able to understand calculus for 2 years but now i got it 2 DAYS BEFORE MY FINALS
Leibniz Me: spits drink Me: YOU MEAN THE COOKIES?
6:53 looks like a zit
Awesome explanation. I wish I had teachers like you.
how can you edit your videos ? what software do you use?
I consider myself pretty strong in algebra (I'm wrecking it this semester, 95 in the class), and I'm taking pre-calc next semester and have no idea what to expect. I also have to take Calc 1 and Calc 2 (I'm a computer science major). Before this video, calculus was literally just a word to me. I now completely understand what I have to look forward to next fall after pre-calc. Thanks!
Dope video. Currently in trigonometry/ pre calculus. Will take next year
Ah the thing i wonte study i hat math
Oh I just completed 10k likes in 10 October 2018
Great teacher, God bless you dear.
I wish I never did drugs!
Why did the derivative have to be 1? That's just a very exceptional case. Unnecessarily confusing.
just conventional stuff no special insight besides integration is more than finding areas since it can find volume and line (height). no critical discussion of differentiation.
Tell me how many of you watched this video because calculus is now, used in AI and machine learning XD :)
Where were the other two slices in the beginning? I only counted eight.
Your video was amazing! I was able to understand everything so well
Funny thing is I could easily write a program to calculate this, but doing it the math way is difficult. In my Physics class I wrote powershell scripts in class on my laptop to do physics calculations so I could plug in numbers and get answers. The instructor seemed impressed.
It was a great explanation. Thanks
We're ever there is x replace it with-1
U have to how to use it and when to use it to see the whole picture as long with the rest of other maths
Good Work !!!
What are the real world examples of Calculus?
How did u find the area of the rectangles in the integral????its not clear to me pls tell me ????????
Yeah I've been studying Calculus not even knowing what it is. Thanks bro
One video has more worth than a month of my calculus class ever had.wow
i am in 9
This is too complicated for me but are really good
Quality Content!
I wish you were my calculus professor
Sir do more videos on calculas we are waiting
Very nice intro
It would be nice to get names of presenters, or their 'nom de...videos' (?) so we could refer more directly with the presenter. The woman presenting awesomely hilarious and effective Python vids would become 'Salima' rather than 'the hot chick in blue', and the calculus presenter would be 'George' rather than the 'dude who explains skinny rectangles in calculus'. In either case, more hilarious hot-chick Python vids and more 'skinny rectangle dude' calculus videos please!
I wish people would explain why a particular aspect of math is used BEFORE teaching it.........It just makes sense.....Introducing real world examples assists also...Great job!
You are a great teacher. It would be good to have more videos on a full calculus lesson and book. Thank you for this wonderful video.
I am from India and im in the seventh grade right now. This video clarified my doubts to what I will face in my higher studies.
how do we find the function itself? this is bugging me. i mean in real life we have to determine the function and the curve right? how do we do it? derivative and integral tells us about what to do AFTER getting the function/equation. but my question is how do we develop the equation or function from say a car travelling at different speeds over a course of time.
I've studied this for months but I didn't know that it was called calculus....
function ? does it mean the graph line described in algebra notion ?
Excellent video!!!
You are great,thank you sir
absolutely amazing.... worth watching.... thanks
congrats you just taught a 15 year old Calculus
Super sir..love from India ????????????
Why am I watching this? I'm only at first year highschool..
They discovered or they invented ?
Thank you very much!
I hate mathematics it drive me crazy thru my scholar life. ahhh i wish i could kill those people who invented much more complex branches of mathematics.
Fantastic
Nope.
Ha ha calculus was invented in india
Totally amazing explanation!! THANKS A LOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!
Wow! This was really helpful.
NC explained
Which editing software please tell me sir
I want to cry. How can you find this interesting?
Awesome, this was so refreshing and gave me back the big picture
I just learned this and I’m in 4th grade
THIS IS THE SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH INTERSTING VIDEOS
Am learning calculus from code academy ,its fun and better than my boring teachers who bores me to death ..... BTW nice explanation I understood most of what's said
Simply Outstanding!!!!
INCORRECT: Neither Newton nor Leibniz invented Calculus. It was stolen from the Indians. Just like the Pythagoras Theorem, Fibonacci, etc.
I still find it difficult to understand, starting from scratch, there are still a few terms which is assumed that the learner understands. It would be great if even words like derivative and integrals are broken down even further. Thank you very much for the video too!
ihope it doesnt discovered huhu
Solve Riemann
Discovery or invention
Correction geometry came from Ancient Africa aka Egypt
I've always been really frustrated because we start learning calculus from limits, while no one ever explained to us what we were actually doing. I'm glad I watched this video before finishing highschool! Thanks a lot.
This channel deserves more subs
Bhagiashree, a girl of my class come into my mind when I hear about Calculus. She is amazing at Mathematics. Your videos are very neat and clean Socratica.
Calc rocks!
A great teacher makes complex knowledge simple and accessible. Mathematics is a numerical expression of nature. Thank you for simplifying nature for us!
I will never forget this video and the teacher.Thank u a lot
Wish I watched this while still in high-school but I will learn maybe I will be of help. Kudos
Wish I watched this while still in high-school but I will learn maybe I will be of help. Kudos
The force of push and pull of matter.
Very very good video!
very good explanation. thanks..
This is really awesome..!!
Actually, Archimedes used a summation technique to find the volume and area of the sphere, cylinder and cone, anticipating the same developments in calculus by 2000 years. His Codex A and C manuscripts were lost, and his Codex B was almost erased and written over by monks. Codex B was re-discovered in 1906 in Istanbul (in the Hagia Sophia Library)and portions were analyzed, translated and published. Archimedes proofs use the same techniques for integration taught today.
Thanks! it gave me a good insight of calculus.
Some people are just good at math period & other people suck at it I'm not sure if it's because of the brain not getting it or they simply find it boring,  people are not created equal who ever said that is the biggest ass.
Excellent. Thank you very much.
whats a function and what do those lines mean in the graph?
I understood nothing...
Too easy xd
I need to re study about calculus..
I didn’t know Alberto from wwe is math legend.
Im just a gcse student and he made me understad calculus thats mad
Excellent intro.
Please make more videos
Awesome thanks
charming...and i have easily understand
Your lectures are so easy to understand. Please post more videos for calculus and vectors.
Actually a new analysis of a set of ancient clay tablets has revealed that ancient astronomers of Babylonia used advanced geometrical methods to calculate the position of Jupiter ie calculus – a conceptual leap that was previously thought to have occurred in 14 th century Europe. Ha ha ha ...u need to update your information m8..
Before: Didn’t even know what Calculus was. After: Full book of Calculus. That’s me when I watched this video…
how does he finds the slope
I wish you were my calculus teacher.
Thank you
Calculus looks really interesting!
This is an absolutely fantastic video. Thank you so much
amazing explanation
amazed by your explanation...We need more such videos
Calculus is add and subtraction up to infinity. Somewhat like circles. And sequences.
Awesome!!!
At 3:50, how did get the combined area of all 10 slices?  I didn't get the same number.  Would you consider doing a video showing the calculation of each of the 10 rectangles?
Amazing explanation.  Not too slow, not too fast and very very clear.  Thank you for posting this.
Blame
This is the best summary for calcu thanks
This video is very good for understanding what Calculus is!
Very useful video.. You have focused on basics.. ????
Thanks teacher
In junior year of high school and it’s almost like he’s speaking Chinese.
aww jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez
oH Wow! I signed up for this course without knowing what I was getting in to ... and now I know all about EVERYTHING :)
thanks for learning me some calcules
Nah!! Watch mathantics it's heaps BETTER!!! It doesn't even make sense explain clearly
Schools should teach calculus as a theoretical subject rather than a boring and stale mathematical subject that doesn't interest anyone.
I was kinda scared of calculus but now I'm kind of excited to learn it. Understand it helps it become less intimidating. Thanks for the video ??
This video continues to inspire my teaching. I come back and watch it again when I need a little boost. :D
God help
He just pulls the “f” and the “x” out of the air, and then puts some random numbers next to some of the letters. Yes great explanation...???? this stuff has to be fake.
What is x and g. He just puts it on the screen. Where did those letters come from. Wtf do they mean? He is just using them and others with no explanation..... Honestly I think this stuff is fake.
A very clear explanation. Thank you.
Thats so cool..
Bravo! What an excellent overview!
im a grade 8 student and just found this vid while scrolling but i dont know anything about this lol
Excellent summary. This is the first time in my life that I've encountered a math teacher who can use English in an organized and clear way to describe differentiation and integration. Of course, I'm going to subscribe.
English plz
Hands down man...
I send my love, sue!
Bro you are awesome
its really nice explanation for understanding calculus
calculus in grade 11 was gobbledegook then and it hasn't changed ... it still sounds like the parking solution at your local shopping center.
The word alone scared me. Never really understood at all what it was - Calculus. I watched this video on a whim and walked away feeling like I took the first step in opening my mind to a whole other side to what’s out there. Thanks for that!
Good explanation of calculus, however, I think, the importance of the concept of limits should have been emphasised more. Calculus would not exist but for the concept of limits.
very good i like you
Beautifully explained!
I think I can listen to you narrate almost anything..
that is called clarity.. i mean today no one even knows why the we are studying maths . studying without knowing why you are studying is absolute stupidity...awesome explanation. keep an making these videos. INSTANT SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!
this is a pretty good video mate. good job.
Damn, you´re really good at explaining stuff
Hilarious--this calculus video is sponsored by a Grammarly ad for people who can't spell.
I had an epiphany when I found out 0 is the opposite of infinity
That was an awesome explanation. Helped more then the those in my textbooks. Thank you very much.
Thanks bro this realy helped me out keep making more videos! :)
Beautiful video. Great explanation
Infinite/taylor series for various trigonometric functions such as sine,cosine,arctangent,tangent and pi were discovered by Madhava of sangamgrama (who was an Indian mathematician living in 14 th century) way before leibnitz and newton. Madhava and his school worked with calculus of finite differences and was able to integrate/differentiate these selected trigonometric functions. Using methods of calculus such as interpolation/iterative approximations/differentiation/integration madhava was able to calculate sine values of any angle with accuracy of 8 digits after decimal place. here is my source- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_series#Madhava.27s_sine_series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava%27s_sine_table His pupils and his school produced results which would today could be counted as calculus. I hope you take notice of this in your next videos. for more details about development of calculus in India(before similar developments in Europe by atleast 150 yrs) these links are useful- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuktibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3%C4%81 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji Show less REPLY
Do more videos on calculus
intro gives a hint about application of derevatives and function
If numbers were not changed by letters, I would have understand this perfectly.
This actually sounds really interesting.
can I get the contact details of the person who created this vedio?
The graphic approach. I like the algebraic. approach. Calculus is a function grinding machine one way you grind smaller. The otherway you grind larger.
Why do we study calculus in Physics???.....plzzz explain
I did not understand everything. But you are so good!
Me pronouncing this:derivevativeativeative
Great intro, I suggest a more descriptive title that emphasize it's content: "What is INFINITESIMAL Calculus?".
My brain is bleeding and I still don't get it.
Wtf am i doing here I'm still in 7th grade
i' m biggner trying to learn
Wat
love love <3
I wish u were my class teachers...thank u very much for the excellent video
I found this channel to be one of the best. Many people explain concepts with no base to plot the concept. While this channel does neither hype nor exaggerate itself to gain publicity. Teachers in here do come to the topic of interest very peacefully and explain any concept starting from its origin. This is true teaching.
This video explains how calculus works and not what it is. However, it's a good video.
Thank you.....That was very helpful.
Socratica:  excellent video.  Helps to explain to the class the basic  components of Calculus.  Many thanks for the information.
in the integral part,how will you get the height of the rectangles?
2+2=Integrales:(2+2)dx=2+2+c={{(2+2)^=^0=0}}={]{2=-2]=2^0=0]=[2=0]=[2^2=0]=[2^2=1]=[2+2=1] atlekejas :MARCELIUS MARTIROSIANAS tel867752875
finally i know what the heck is calculus
This cleared doubts...thanks..!
really intro to calculus, covers everyrhing
I still don't understand what calculus is !!!!!
JUST OSM
very nicely put together! Thank you!
It's interesting that whenever the question "what is calculus" is asked, the instructor immediately starts to do calculus. Is there no one who can explain the concept of calculus using common language?
Beautiful clear animations, cute little sound effects, calm and interesting voice, perfect speed, good use of repetition as well as great sound and video quality. Stunning work! I am glad I found your channel. Thank you for sharing your art.
Exceptional! Two thumps up. What textbook would you recommend for an absolute beginner of Calculus? I have seen so many claims as' the best ...'or 'the book on learning calculus...' I really need to have an excellent book to self study calculus.Thanks and keep making more videos.
wow.so clear.thank you.
Excellent overview of calculus. The best of several that I watched. Thanks for taking the time to share your knowledge in such a clear, concise, and helpful way.
Brilliant!...I have been teaching, tutoring and using high-level math for decades and have utilized analogies and visuals since the first lesson I gave...nothing is better than quality computer animation/graphics that an individual can watch, re-watch, pause or use to explain what or where they have become lost or confused...it is sad to say that universities don't reward TEACHING, but research dollars, which is why I prefer to do part-time instruction at Community College while maintaining a career in engineering. Damn well done!
Very interesting and clear explanation. I'm not sure I'll ever need to use it but I do feel a little better at mathematics now. ??
dont give distorted facts, Newton discovered Calculus not invented it, this concept has been alive since the vedic times.
came from mr zuniga
i am very thankful to you..
it's been a long time since I have even been to school and this still makes no sense to me at all honestly
In one word "AWESOME"
isaac newton was a genius and Leibniz too
can you please make a video on motion in a plane(physics).Your teaching and visualization is uncomparable.Kepep up the good work
Thank you. Much respect from Pakistan. (:
THANK YOU! I love math with visuals. In fact I want someone to teach the whole of everything in Maths with some kind of visual! I remember when I was younger I couldn't figure out the rules of multiplying positives and negatives until I read somewhere to just imagine it on the coordinate plane. It just made sense afterwards.
Glad I found your video . Thanks sir . You're a blessing ?? .
Simply Amazing...
OMG whyyyyyy is this on YouTube but I kinda like this video it is god for taking notes all you have to do is copy duuuuhhhhhh I like this video tho
Sephiroth Supernova Everyone?
Best Video I understood Derivatives and Integrals in one go!! Keep up the good work and please upload more Calculus videos
Beautifully done. I just stumbled on your site and will be adding it to my childrens viewing. Thank you
wow! Man thank you! This is magic
after 20 years since i first learnt it i have finally started to understand the CALCULUS.
Awesome - very brief and very informative... Keep doing the good work for kids
Great Channel, Very Underrated,,
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more.
This look just like algebra
Thank you!
Two dudes around the same time just... uh... thought up calculus. lol, wtf?
this is brilliant thank you so much
and plz upload detailed stuff.
clarity over board!!!!!
Here is a definitive proof for the existence of God based on well accepted math and scientific concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42yJ3Y3BgSc
I'm only 12 should I stop ??
Excellent video. Best lecturer/educatror! :)
Wonderfully explained :)
Am I the only one who sees only 8 rectangles at 3:29 ? Where are the other two?
ya, this is a lot bit advanced for me, i'll just stick with finding the gradient thanks...
Despite being 1/2 way through calc the series, I can still appreciate this video. Although, wish I saw this video before I started calculus.
loved it. Keep it up.

WHO IS UP FOR THE CHALLENGE ?
I start calculous next year, thank you for introducing me to this early.
boy it is not calculus come in India
Great summary of calculus explanation in less than 10 minutes. Thanks a lot!
Derivatives and intervals; fascinating what type of real world problems calculous solve? I have just a G.E.D. and believe it or not I invented my own Theory of relevent mathematics. I'll be watching your videos.
This is an amazing video! What program did you use to create this? Something from Adobe?
I still have two more remarks that I forgot to say in the earlier post: 1. I would add Descartes to the list of founders. 2. Archimedes may have invented calculus, but his work was lost and was only discovered much later.
Pretty good introduction, but I have additional remarks. First in both processes, of finding out the value of the slope of the tangent to a graph and of finding the area underneath the curve, one ends up taking a limit. So here arises a third important concept in calculus which is the limit of a function. Second, finding the value of the slope of a tangent is just a particular application of the notion of derivative, however the theory of differentiation almost has numerous other applications like finding the rectangle with maximum possible area when its perimeter is given. Third, same remark as the second one but with integrals. The theory of integration has numerous applications other than finding the algebraic area underneath a curve. Fourth, I believe you should have said a word in the beginning about the concept of a function. I know that people have already seen functions in Precalculus, but the very fact that one has to cover sequences when taking calculus leads to the need of understanding what a function is from scratch. Actually when students take Real Analysis later, they see that the concept of a sequence is a more natural concept than that of a function. Besides, keep up the good work. I will be for the first time lecturing multivariable calculus next fall! I am waiting to be inspired by your videos! I am a PHD student.
I thought DIFFERENTIAL calculus and INTEGRAL calculus. is it really derivative calculus? I thought that derivative is for/ in the ones that says "limits, DERIVATIVE, and integrals"... ?? I just want to know and understand.............
very good experience with calculus by this video thank u sir after this video no body will fear to give difference between derivative and integration
Really it's one of unique and clear explanation. no more doubts will be after watching
Beautifully explained
The ntelligence of a man is not related on how well he performs in math, but instead in the success he has with the opposite sex.
This is the best overview of calculus that I've seen on this site.
Amazing video, thank you!
Calculus ...It is interesting when you put it that way :P
good enough the guy made me physics easier
This video is Great, ty for this (Y) Excellent work!!
Wonderfully explained.
so i just finished alg 2 and now i look at this like "My head hurts already"
You lost me when you said function ... What is a "function " ?
I get like 3 steps when I was in 5th grade
Brilliant! We need more topics on calculus covered and discovered!!!
very clear and informative and digestable very appreciate to your efforts
Thank you for not stopping at 1- or 2-dimensional calculus. Is there a video with even more examples that go into the problems and solutions that are modeled using Calculus or Linear Algebra?
You've forgotten: halfway through this beautiful exposition of differential and integral calculus in one and several variables, we'll throw in Taylor series just to fuck with the students who thought Calculus was making too much sense.
What do you get when you cross a mosquito and a mountain climber? Nothing, you can't cross vectors and scalers.
Thanks. I take the test tomorrow and I hope this comes up on the test. Perfect score here I cume
what is partition of a set?
after memorizing and calculating a lot of calculus problems for years finally it makes sense to me..... thank you for your splendid video....if you can make more videos on calculus to make sense I think it would help a lot of students like me .......
more videos, please
ARCHIMEDES = calculus.
Thank you for making calculus a little less mysterious and a little more understandable for someone with no mathematical background. At least now I know what it's meant to measure, and that it's based on a few simple principles.
this is worth learning!
Why am i watching this? i thought this was a cartoon movie.,and now my nose is bleeding
What is Calculus? Calculus is a method of studying the complex universe by cutting them into very small pieces which turn them into SIMPLE pieces like straight lines or cubes, making them easy to apply various math. This is called DERIVATIVE. Summing all the small pieces to represent the overall picture is called INTEGRAL. Explaining Calculus as 'slope and area' merely shows the PROPERTY of Calculus. This is why many students (and general public) do not understand the fundamental concept of Calculus.
This explanation is very intuitive, thanks I learn something new now
I have a hard time with maths, but not even the 2+ dimensional graphs scared me too much. You have a calming voice :)
Thanks for this explanations!
Wow, this teacher is excellent. Clear, concise, to the point, and in a relaxed manner. Five Stars !!!
I think I get it lol...
It is one of the hardest Mathematiic styles ever
Oh man... you are good. Nicely presented. Those idiots who taught me calculus at high school did not want the students to understand what they were teaching.
Houston we have a problem. The earth looks flat.
do you know why so many people hate calculus? because the teacher/lecturer doesnt even tell the student about this and jump into some crazy integrals and derivatives. this explanation is amazing!
I wish I could have seen this when I was taking calculus 15 years ago. I eventually aced derivative and integral, but I NEVER understood what it was about. Just one bit of advice. Please pick an example where the answer is more random than one just for clarity. Us poor non-math brains try to read something into that that isn''t there and so it distracts.
I'm pretty sure Archimedes had worked out a form a integrals. BTW, What is the use of finding the area under a curve? I understand that a function of a curve might be related to some physical event like the rate at which two or three chemicals react together or the curve could follow the behaviour of some financial instrument but why would I need to know the area under the curve?
you are a God man
All videos jump from the Greeks to the age of enlightenment without mentioning the Arabs who had their own share and actually added significant discoveries to modern science.. I wonder why?
calculus is math on average
I feel like I'm through the class already! Wow, nice!
It wasn't "discovered", it was "created". Math is not "the language of the universe". Math is simply our best translation of things that happen in the universe. I believe there is a better understanding out there that we have not created yet. "CREATED" yet. Once again, it wasn't "discovered". Math was created. Just like how languages didn't fall from the sky. We made that shit. And math is and will forever be only a language. Nothing but a building block or a law, just a name for something. A place holder. That is all it is and all it will ever be. The universe does not need math to exist.
Watch with caution, there is some incorrect information in here on the derivative.
And I thought I'm good at maths in school. Looks like I have so much more to learn
Mam's Style of explanation is better...Thanks your work is helpful for us...
It would have great if you mentioned an example of what computing the integral and divertive could be applicable to.
Darn boy! These peeps are pretty darn good! Thanks General Sal Khan
amazing video
Funny way of saying Newton descovered calculus.
super explanation.. thanks a ton...
melted my brain
never thought calculus was so simple and awesome.
None of this highfalutin shit ever made sense to me. What are the applications of this kind of math?
No confundir con Caraculus
i dunno y i keep watch this but i love learning things
MmmAmmmaa Mio jst awesome Luved ur workk
can u please tell me which software u use for editing ???? can u suggest me any educational video editor ??? any one please ?
Really well-explained. Good stuff.
I just started learning about limits and derivatives in school. I can't wait to learn how integrals work.
Awesome video. Thank you sir for such Great explanation.
i think u should make videos on parabola ellipse hyperbola as well . awesome videos appreciated . respect from Pakistan
I understand what calculus is (answer: something I don't need to know), but what are the uses of this information not just from a mathematics points of view; in other words what are the real world applications for this ability? Thanks
Amazing.... plz upload some descussion about quantum calculus..
I have never heard such an explanation for which I was searching for a long time.Hats off.
nice one
im only in 7th grade and i get this
Nothing can explain a complex concept as clear as an animation. Thank you for putting the time to create the videos. Is it possible to describe what software you use to create the animations so that other teacher, like myself, can use it in our classrooms? thank you in advance.
how did he got slops .24, rise over run 6.048/.8 is 7.56, idk maybe I'm going something wrong help haha
this is much more clear and gives me an idea and perspective,plus the animated video makes calculus a lil bit fun and creative despite most people say Calculus is a hard subject. Im also a visual learner so this help me to step up my game.Im taking pre-calc in summer to catch up with Calc1.
nice explanation and great task ,I want to add arabic translation but I can't kindly help
That's great
Hey, great video! I've learned more in this video then I have in all my math adventures.
Amazing work bro keep it up!
well organised at the start but oversimplified and focuses too little on limits, even if you're only going to use it as a tool, you ought to understand the concepts behind these else suffer from mistakes, some costly.
thank you sirr for letting me to know what calculus is
WOW! Play this video to Donald Trump, he will love maths.
Of what specific use is calculus?
If only I watched this video in my +1 and +2; I would be in a better place now.
Geometry was not invented by Greeks as you described in the introduction. In fact, it was originated in India in ancient times and the very name Geometry itself comes from the Sanskrit word for it i.e. "JYAAMITI". Most works of mathematics which includes Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra and even the decimal system and zero were introduced to West through Arab, who actually copied it from India. I wonder how people miss out on that when it's so obviously found with little research.
Me at the beginning: Oh, I'm probably too young for this. How will I understand anything? Me at the end: I am amazed
So I had a little thought. If Calculus is necessary because it's impossible to calculate the exact area of a curved surface, would this different approach work?: 1. Take any object and immerse it in paint. 2.Subtract the final volume of paint from the initial volume of paint 3. Given that the paint is thin, wouldn't the difference give a close approximation of the surface area of the immersed object? And given that Calculus is also an approximation, wouldn't this be a more intuitive method that skips a lot of the difficult math?
Oh how this video makes me feel sooooooooo stupid!!! LOL And I am not really because I have a passion for astronomy, astrophysics, cosmonlgy, biology and Earth science but this ???
ur like Jesus.savior. do more videos like this.
bro your really literally god to me.in country like india education is making money and make students brain dead.
Actually, the ancient Greeks did have some knowledge of Calculus, and technically, Pierre de Fermat was before Newton and Leibniz, with the fundamental concept that started calculus, even though Newton and Leibniz fleshed it out.
If you're talking about Calculus, why didn't you say something about sequences or continuity?
Unfortunately there's a potty mouth in almost every video.
3 Dimensional Calculus!! So cool, love it. Thank you Newton and Leibniz
This is very well done.
idk, i mean this works 'sort of' and but it feels rather unintuitive, say i have a 4 state markov chain, and i want the probability at time t that the state has gone from state 0 to 1 and stayed at one. the whole 'area' definition of an integral feels really rather weak here. i think that a much more consistent interpretation of an integral would be the evaluation of a continuous argument through some continuous section of the domain. or an evaluation of the argument from point a to b. similarly when you look for the path integral you have a definition of length and then you apply that argument to the dx, then integrate. There's really not an 'area' here, same w/ vector fields and the force pushed upon a region.
This is the perfect amount of information. Parsimonious. Not a syllable more or less than necessary. Fantastic. Can you please do a series on Linear Algebra for econometrics?
This is a subject that always give me a head ache in school but after watching your video is have regained my hope if you keep up with his level of explanation i will get good grades in my school
what a good lecture.
Superb explaination ????
Hey everyone, I already took calculus 2 and this showed up on my feed, but I just want to say that I didn't watch this video and that I am glad I never have to touch calculus again. Good luck folks!
That's great, now explain the crap they scrape off of your teeth.
wtf is a function?
Good video.
This is the best explanation of calculus that I've ever seen. Thank you! Makes me want to go back to college (or high school).
This is really helping me with dealing with my day, thanks.
I refused calculus in high school. I refused calculus in college. I refuse calculus now. I do not miss it.
I learned more from this video than the 2 years of advanced Calculus I took in high school
After taking 3 calculus courses, it's great to get back to the basics. Great video.
Indians have discovered calculus before Newton +Djprojectus https://www.google.co.in/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.632433?client=ms-android-lenovo http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/calculus-was-developed-in-medieval-india Indian mathematics - Wikipedia
Wow that is very good video, I don't know how, but i pass my exam of Calculus I, i didn't know anything to solve the equations , but the lecturer didn't bother me to ask questions. My lucky day maybe. Calculus part II God helps people study who study that devil.
I recommend this video to anyone who has to take calculus, I've done calc 1-3. The part they don't show very well in class is the visual aspect. I can crunch numbers and memorize formulas all day long but to truly learn it they should really teach it the way this guy does.
You can't explain a topic by using terms that have specialized meanings within that topic. You have to connect new concepts to things people already know. This video fails at the outset. It "explains" calculus ONLY to someone who already knows what it is.
Did you use python to make this
"The derivative of f(x)" that doesn't mean anything. f(x) is a number, a number doesn't have a derivative. It's important to teach people what objects they are dealing with.
about half way through the video i felt very happy that I learned and understood the math. Once you finished talking about the integral of a function with one variable you blew my mind with what I still don't know. I may have to do calculus 2 and multivariable calculus now out of interest.... subscriebed
how about ancient Indians discovering calculus?
these are just demo can you giv details also please
I studied calculus 25 yrs ago but really understood it only today. awesome video.
@Michael Harrison - I usually have to use my hearing aid when I'm trying to learn something from You Tube videos because I don't hear the higher frequencies, but your speaking voice was just perfect for me so that I didn't need my hearing aid. And thanks for not playing any background music which just messes me up.
I was fortunate to have been taught by a superb calculus professor.
now i understood what's the meaning of (dough u by dough x) please do a video just on partial derivatives. want to understand how heat works.
If you not know what calculus is, then you should not be on the internet. Your time would be better spent in study AWAY from this medium
Still fundamentally don't know what calculus is, why it's important, what function any of this has.
Baby don't hurt me...
omg this is gold
Who else is here because they were forced to take calculus
Areas under a curve for a good part are assumed between y=0 (the x axis) and y=f(x). But what if you wanted to evaluate the area between y=-3 and y=sin x??
This had better not be everything calculus has to offer, because we have a whole year on calculus.
i studied calculus 17 years back and understood the meaning today. good work mate.
I was always intimidated by calculus purely on what others were saying. When I started it, I really enjoyed it. Along with conic sections, it was definitely a field of maths I wanted to learn more about.
Don't forget the fundamental theorem of calculus: That the integral and the derivative do the opposite thing. That is, if you integrate F(x), then take the derivative, you end up back at F(x). The fact that Leibniz and Newton were working on two completely different problems that landed upon the same mathematics is why it is difficult to separate the two when talking about who invented calculus.
what grade do you have to learn this?
please, more videos about calculus
I love you.Like seriously.this is so clear and so simply put.I literally just reconsidered dropping out of school because of this video hehe thanks a lot
Im loooooove this ..... explanation's are greaaaaaaaate....
Very insightful! Thanks for the explanation.
nice visualization of calculus in action, thank you!!!
OMG.... you explained so good.... keep it up.... ???????
It's funny because for french people like me this idea of "calculus" is very bizarre, because we don't learn it as such with a fancy name, we just get taught derivatives, integrals, exponential and log functions and trigo... And we get it taught to us starting at 15 years old approx..
Awesome explanation. Thank you!
you guys are amazing, kudos !!
Why is this guy off on a tangent? Ps I'm the greatest!
very intresting topic in math ! thanks alot
It's amazing how clear and how great it is. Really deep and easy to understand. Thanks you a lot !
Issac newton discovered derivatives, integrals, differential equations. how to solve multi-dimensional coupled non-linear equations. jacobian matrix, power series, and 10's of numerical analysis, he pioneered and discovered every mathematics there was, and there could be, the entire modern mathematics because he was the first one who understood the calculus, if Leibniz had really discovered the calculus, he would have discovered at least part of them, other branches of calculus, but Leibiz hadnt done any and didnt do any. and when Leibniz received the calcus letter from issac newton, he knew how great it was, so he made the notations. HE MADE THE CALCULUS NOTATIONS. and anyone can make notations.
I understand more about calculus than I do from my math teacher and text book.
Thank you so much!
This video was great, have a new subscriber :)
Excellent video. What I am missing is the connection between derivative and integral. It is said that integral is an inverse function to derivative. But how is "area under the curve" inverse to "slope of a curve"? I have never seen the connection...
"text a friend each morning to see if Socratica released a new video" lol
Really well done. Your explanation and video support was really well done.
calculus is the reason why i give up ingeniering.
this is one of the most clearest explanations of calculus that I've ever seen
thank you very much. you helped me alot.
I am a theoretical physics master's student, why am I watching this?
excellent...........thanks
This is probably the best video I have watched along my mathematics career. Thank you for the clarity !!
i loved this VID ! Awesome fundamental explaination
Has anyone ever told you you look like Kal Penn?
Thanks alot for this video, very clear and easy to follow.
I texted my friends each morning asking if Socratica had published a new video, they told me to go fuck myself.
if this video was in chinese it wouldnt change a single thing in terms of what i understood or took away from it.
fantastic!
And to think that sir isaac newton invented all of this in 1 like 1 day.
Great!
Thanks! Good overview. I learn better known the overview ????
you just earned my subscription. Thanks for the information. Thanks
At roughly 3:50 you talk about 10 rectangles but show only 8.
Hi I liked your video but looking at the comments it looks like many people are still having a hard time. I like to explain it like this if f(x) = x^2 then this thing we call a "derivative" is written like d/dx f(x) or f'(x) A derivative changes one function into another one and in this case it changes x^2 into 2x. 2x lets us estimate the change in the output of x^2 for example at the point x=10 f(x) = 10^2 = 100 Now if we increase the input by 1 to the point x=11 then f(x) = 11^2 = 121 which is an increase of 21 If we compute the derivative at the point x=10 we get 2*10 = 20 which is pretty close to 20 (5% error) This works better with larger numbers At x=100 f(x) = 10000 At x=101 f(x) = 101^2 = 10201 which is an increase of 201 which is pretty close to f'(100) = 2*100 = 200 (0.5% error) It also works better with smaller changes f(10) = 100 f(10.1) = 102.01 which is an increase of 2.01 evaluating the derivative 2x at x=10 gives 20 as before but since we only increased the input by 0.1 it makes sence that the output will increase less We expect an increase of 20 for every unit of increase in the input so we should expect an increase of 20*0.1 = 2.0 which is pretty close to 2.01 (0.5 %error) If f(x) = x^3 then f(10)=1000 and f(11)=1331 which is an increase of +331 the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2 and 3x^2 evaluated at x=10 gives 3(10^2) = 300 not bad and like before this works better with bigger numbers and smaller changes .......
This was a great video. Really good at explaining double integrals and calculating volume in 3 dimensions. Thanks.
omg he lost me exactly at 1:00 ??
i like it. thanks
This is amazing. After a decade of rote memorization and torture, finally i get the intution. Can't thank enough. Thanks very much.
what is a function , you should explain this.
please, don not stop ,you are amazing
just amazing
Very nice. While derivative calculus has always been somewhat intuitive to me, integral calculus has not, and it bothers me, as they are two halves of the same thing. I guess I learned that they were inverse processes too soon, so I never got to appreciate what an integral really represents on a physical level. (Though, I'd also argue that integrals are more difficult to understand in that respect. I can describe derivatives very simply as change, but I know no similar way to describe an integral.)
at 6:40, i was lost and hopeless
Too complicated for a beginner to understand. After all, the name of your video is: "What is Calculus?" Then again it might be a perfect name for the video because I think I'm more dumbfounded now after watching your video than I was before I watched it. You're explanation of calculus went straight over my head. The video failed to answer a few 'essential to know first' definitions: calculus, higher dimension, etc.
When does the ultimate question appear during the rain of the total eclipse while standing in the mists of the super frantic science fiction novel based off the judgement of evaluating the educated guess thereby undermining the total value of pie which has reconstructed all new perimeters of the timeline of the evolution of video games to whoever can divide the splinter can multiply the cell of the captured duck if only the man would comply with the order of the last air bending terminator to which i congratulate the numerical superiority that exceeds the expectations of the diagram chart explaining the proper proportions calculated by the robot Tom following the latest episode simply put making a cake. Although there are many different theories only one can be Coincidentally equivalent to the mind of the tsunami of breathtaking events?

Can you make a video for statistics ?
Hands down the best intro to calculus online. Not even Khan Academy or similar high-profile channels come close!
Please make videos on e, pi, complex nos, & undefined nos, what they actually mean in real world. Please please please!!!
That is amazing! So what I concluded is that we use derivative to find variation in space or plane (just assuming cause I'm still learning the calculus), like say on earth there is slight variation in gravity as earth is not perfect sphere, so derivative tells us about each point on surface (circumference) of earth about its gravity & I guess what integral tells is that how much area/volume is possessing a particular value of field for a specific region & what limit tells us is that the gravity field for earth lies between these two values (say between 3-6, just assuming) and the variation is confined within this range only. Just please tell me if I have got the very idea that you were trying to explain cause I'm still dealing with calculus which I always found difficult to understand.
You succeeded in combine brief and yet comprehensive idea about calculus; and that's really great! of course I wont miss any of your calculus videos
what's calculus : a character from tintin xD
great job bro ji
Great job Michael!!
Thank you!! Can you make a video explaining how Analysis and Calculus are related?
Omg... I hate functions!!! I've never really tried to learn it... but still hate it. Good vid tho!
Socratica could you put subtitles in Spanish? I'm learning English and i want to understand better, please.
I am always amazed at how much clarity you have in your videos. This is absolutely golden. I love everything that you do.
Please, make more deeper and detail videos about differentials integrals and differential equations. Thanks
I scraped through maths in uni, I won't lie! This is a good lesson. You guys have a great channel!
terrific video explained in the best possible way
Excellent video. Very clear. Thank you :) The only minor thing that I noticed to correct is the lining up the axes in the figure at 7:35. The z-axis should go through the highest point but it seems to be a bit off. Not a big deal though. Thank you for making such great videos:)
This is great!!
thank can so much!¡!!!!
This was the best explanation to calculus I've ever seen
Best video I've seen, hands down! I can't wait to see more.
Where do series approximations fit in to the Calculus? Things like Taylor Series. Sometimes the topics in math classes all feel disconnected. :)
great video! this would have helped me a great deal when I still was ignorant of calculus.
I am not from Brasil. I have a question is 8=10 according to calculus?
Yes! Can't wait to see more of your calc vids!
upload videos of vector calculus.
Still confused
Really great video, one of the clearest explanations of calculus
Great job! Great videos! I'm from Brazil and studying Physics and this channel is helping me a lot! Thanks and keep the good work! :)



Do stateless people still have to pay taxes? (To whatever country they're currently residing in.)
0:21 skip bullshit button
you look very much like michael stevens of vsauce channel
Hello, Vsause2
Omg I’ve been wondering about this for a couple of weeks. Thanks
Of course I live in the only country that will let me become stateless
I read an article by somebody who became a Japanese citizen once, Japan doesn't allow dual citizenship (let's hope other countries copy this example, eh?), so you have to have proof you renounced your previous citizenship before you can get the new one, thus becoming "stateless", though it might only be for a day or two. Also apparently Britain will automatically take you back if another country doesn't "claim" you within a given time.
w8, this is not V Sauce
i really have a problem with that schengen map tbh...xD
The practice of law is a common right, law is common to all.. Here's the proof! The practice of Law is an occupation of common right, the same being a secured liberty right. (Sims v. Aherns, 271 S.W. 720 (1925)) No state may convert a secured liberty right into a privilege, issue a license and fee for it. (Murdock vs Pennsylvania 319 US 105 (1943)) The practice of Law can not be licensed by any state/State. (Schware v. Board of Examiners, 353 U.S. 238, 239 (1957)) Should any state convert a secured liberty right into a privilege, charge a fee and issue a license for it, one may ignore the license and fee and engage in the exercise of the right with impunity. (Shuttlesworth vs City of Birmingham 373 U.S. 262 (1962)) "A 'Statute’ is not a Law,” (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), A “Code’ is not a Law,” (In Re Self v Rhay Wn 2d 261), in point of fact in Law, A concurrent or ‘joint resolution’of legislature is not “Law,” (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N. E. 705, 707; Ward v State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165). All codes, rules, and regulations are for government authorities only, not human/Creators in accord with God’s Laws. “All codes, rules, and regulations are unconstitutional and lacking due process of Law..”(Rodriques v. Ray Donavan, U.S. Department of Labor, 769 F.2d 1344, 1348 (1985)) The Natural Law, as practiced by all men, and from which all fictions, lesser forms of law and governance are derived, is from the creator, and man's unalienable and inherent natural liberty rights (the Will), and not from government, which can create no right or law governing the liberty of man, existing only to protect those lawfully exercised natural liberty rights which existed separate and sovereign from it, before the creation of government by the power of this liberty. “If you’ve relied on prior decisions of the Supreme Court you have a perfect defense for willfulness.” (U.S. v. Bishop, 412 U.S. 346), as “The claim and exercise of a Constitutional right cannot be converted into a crime.”(Miller v. U.S., 230 F.2d. 486, 489). "Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them." (Miranda v. Arizona 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed. 2d 694 (1966)) Should any state convert any right to work into a privilege, issue a license and charge a fee, the same is unconstitutional, void, and without effect in law. (Marburry vs Madison 5 US 137 (1803)) "All acts of legislature apparently contrary to natural right and justice are, in our laws and must be in the nature of things, considered as void. The laws of nature are the laws of God; whose authority can be superseded by no power on earth. A legislature must not obstruct our obedience to him from whose punishments they cannot protect us. All human constitutions which contradict his laws, we are in conscience bound to disobey. Such have been the adjudications of our courts of justice." (Robin v. Hardaway, 1 Jefferson 109, 114 (1772)). The Supreme Court has warned: "Because of what appear to be Lawful commands on the surface, many citizens, because of their respect for what appears to be law, are cunningly coerced into waiving their rights, due to ignorance." (U.S. v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 187), "the general misconception among the public being that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes Law. THAT A statute is not a "law," (Flournoy v. First Nat. Bank of Shreveport, 197 La. 1067, 3 So.2d 244, 248), "a concurrent or joint resolution of legislature is not "a law,"" (Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.E. 705, 707; Ward v. State, 176 Okl. 368, 56 P.2d 136, 137; State ex rel. Todd v. Yelle, 7 Wash.2d 443, 110 P.2d 162, 165), nor is 'Code' "Law" (In Re Self v Rhay, 61 Wn (2d) 261) These being defined by Black's Law Dictionary as rebuttable prima facie, or superficial, evidence of law, a facade, represented by 'public policy,' being color-able, or 'color of law,' being 'counterfeit or feigned' as defined. "The Natural Liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the law of nature for his rule." - Samuel Adams 'Litigants may be assisted by unlicensed layman during judicial proceedings' (Brotherhood of Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Virginia State Bar 377 U.S. 1; Gideon v. Wainwright 372 U.S. 335; Argersinger v. Hamlin, Sheriff 407 U.S. 425), 'Members of groups who are competent nonlawyers may assist other members of the group [family, association, or class] achieve the goals of the group in court without being charged with "Unauthorized practice of law." ' (NAACP v. Button 371 U.S. 415; United Mineworkers of America v. Gibbs 383 U.S. 715; and Johnson v. Avery 89 S. Ct. 747 (1969).

California Men's Colony • 506 U.S. 194, 203 (1993)." Challenges to Judge: Universal to all cases. A judge who refuses our law is loyal to some other authority. Ask the “Judge” if he/she is a member of the “STATE BAR ASSOCIATION”. If so, challenge the “Judge” under 22 USC 611 as a “Foreign Agent”. All “Judges” are lawfully required by 28 USC 372 to have an “Oath of Office”. Ask the “Judge” if he/she has an “Oath of Office”. If yes, accept the “Oath of Office” in “Admiralty Jurisdiction”. Now the “Judge” is subject to criminal prosecution and civil litigation for any injury he/she may cause you. If no, the attorney is not a judge and has no lawful authority to proceed.

As we remove the unlawful judges, lawful judges will take their place
THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW I properly motioned for all Justices and their Clerks to DISQUALIFY. SCOTUS neither granted nor denied my motion. THEY IGNORED IT !?! Which according to statute they cannot do. My cases were denied by an obvious biased court. 28 U.S. Code § 455 - Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge subparagraph (a) states:>>>>> ANY JUSTICE, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States SHALL DISQUALIFY himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Any jury comprised of twelve (12) rational and reasonable persons, would agree that I “reasonably questioned” the impartiality of SCOTUS, thus requiring their disqualification or alternatively affirming their impartiality as I also moved them to do.. I am also complaining they are in violation of their oath to support and defend the constitution against domestic enemy (which I believe they are). I am also complaining of their aiding and abetting rights violations (which I believe they are). I am also complaining they are in violation of 42 USC Section 1986: Action for Neglect to Prevent rights violations (which I believe they are). I also reminded them of the unsupported allegations against Kavanaugh and how indignant he was refuting allegations against him. WE ALL KNOW THAT IS THE SAME CRAP THEY USE AGAINST US. In our cases, unsupported allegations are used to deprive us of our property and to steal our children. Let us not pretend, everyone well knows that in courtrooms across the country, litigant after litigant is the victim of unsupported allegations used as basis for decision. Unlike Justice Kavanaugh, those litigants are deprived fair due process to disprove unsupported allegations; they are denied a right to be heard, denied the right to present evidence, denied the right to oral argument, denied the right to confront adverse witness testimony. I'm glad Kavanaugh went through that so now he knows what it is like for us. Now having a slight tasting and first hand knowledge of the hell we go through as common citizens, maybe these bozos might want to unscrew the judiciary. I'm not taking this crap laying down. Below picture is of my two PETITIONS FOR REHEARING pursuant to Sup Ct Rule 44, filing Monday. If they still deny me, I'm taking the case to US Congress. These Justices are not above the law. No man is above the law.

We had a bit of trouble with misplacement of documents after the local archive caught fire. A WW2 veteran from my town was told since he couldn't prove who he was, he would lose his federal health care. The VA needed "proof of service", two forms. So he came back the next day with a signed photo and a letter from General Eisenhower. And a two-star general formally apologized and told him that the State Department was working on it. So....maybe the law will get an update soon? Hopefully!!

But if you become stateless with no intention to leave the country you are in you become an illegal immigrant. They are breaking the law and getting detained because of that fact is not an issue, it is their fault.
The only "official" way I would ever renounce my citizenship is to simply renounce it. I'm not filling out any forms or paying any fees or even settling any debts. I would imagine such renouncement would involve you not agreeing with the laws or policies of the country of which you are a citizen, so why would you want to jump through any of their official hoops. Just walk away. No requirement to tell anyone. They don't own you or your identity, though they like to pretend that is the case.
I swear to god i thought you were Michal from Vsauce on the thumbnail lmao
Michael from vsauce :v
You are wrong, the Patriot act, they can detain anyone they want indefinitely without even charging them with a crime. (If you disagree I refer you to Guantanamo bay as one example) Am I the only one sick of hearing people with foreign accents flap their gums about the US?
The american passport is pretty powerful, yankees can go anywhere without much hassle, I don't see why you would renounce it just to avoid some taxes
F*cking idiots. Most people would DIE to live in the USA and here are there morons messing with their citizenship. I would truly deport them to east-europe to go and live there if they think USA is that bad.
Interesting that the Israeli travel visa is in French
Actually, the U.K. rules on renouncing your citizenship sound pretty sensible. Although, another good option would be work out an agreement with North Korea to make anyone denouncing their citizenship to the U.S. a citizen of that country and to deport them there. Also, I think the fee should be waived for any celebrities wishing to do so because they are unhappy with election results. I want to make the process as easy as possible for them.
Knockoff Binging with Babish lookin' dude
Pity stateless people can't form a state together and claim some unclaimed scrap of land as their national homeland, nominate one among them as their prime minister/foreign ambassador and issue passports or visas stored on a cloud server. The Citizens of Unstate should do that.
Russia and England would have fallen if not for US support
"Dark web monitoring" so I guess you're pimping shady ass companies now that use scary buzzwords to take advantage of the tech illiterate? There is no way a company can monitor that shit and it's just dishonest of them to make people think that they're offering any level of safety in regards to their shit being sold on the dark web. What next, you're going to start offering people anti-tiger rocks?
I thought this was Vsauce until I heard his voice
The USA gives its people the freedom to select whatever citizenship he/she desires. The reason it is not guaranteed back is so people cant leave and fight in war against the US and come back.
go to somalia... Lets see how long you last there as a nomad
"Bsauce! British Michael, here!"
I wished that he would have covered renouncing citizenship in N. Korea.
Interesting subject but a long video for me. I won't watch it.
IF you are stateless couldn’t you just start your own state and as the leader of said state any legal document another would require you can just create
Just be kim jong uns friend, he’ll let you inn, or you can move to svalbard
Stateless is the way to go. Functional programming ftw.
surprise surprise you can't even voluntarily renounce your citizenship legally. fuck the gov't. gov't is tyrannical
minute 5:03: why is austria not part of shengen? because it is. please update your map
countries behave just like gangs. if you wanna quit is going to cost you, and after that they will make life a living hell for you, unless you get another gang to exploit you, i mean to pprotect you. In other words we are property of "our" country renouncing the protections... the same words a gangster would use.
I am SOOOOO glad I'm Canadian o-o
The map showing the countries of the Schengen treaty countries is totally incorrect ( 4:41 ). Austria is not shown (even though it is a Schengen country since 1995) but the UK and Croatia are highlighted even though they never were part of the Schengen area. I don't know what this map is supposed to show, but it's not the Schengen area that you refer to in the according section of the video.
minute 5.11 Schengen Area map incorrectly excludes Austria.
Michael??? Vsauce?? Who is this impersonator??
woag, I thought this was VSauce for a second
So if you renounce citizenship in the UK, and don't apply for membership to another corporate nanny state within the next 6 months, they automatically make you a citizen again without your consent. In order to stop you becoming "stateless" (IE. Free). If you can't see how we live in a fascist tyranny, then God help you!
What a crock of shit, one of the most misinformed spiels i've ever heard. But then again, i don't expect mindless statists to have any concept of sovereignty and self-governance. Wake up, the matrix has you.
Why did you include Austria from the Schengen area? Also you should note that since 2015 border crossings have been reactivated, due to obvious issues.
Lmao your discount vsauce
do you mean going of the grid
In the case of the United States, you wouldn't be losing anything by becoming stateless because they don't take care of you anyways. You can pay hundreds of thousands or even millions of $ in taxes your entire lifetime and still be denied social security or disability based on the bureaucratic opinion of corrupt case workers and judges.
Do video on People of India Origin / NRI
Australia has a law that members of parliament can't be dual citizens. There was a massive "scandal" a few years back, where some MPs didn't know they were duel citizens because they were born in another country and had to resign.
But there is a treaty between country in the UN that forbid a country  to deny a person who was a citizen, and want to come back has one.
I've read somewhere that even if you renounce US citizenship, you still pay some other taxes or contributions to US, right?
I legit looked into going stateless and reached out via internet to people who were Stateless. They all told me they didn't regret doing it but that after 9/11 it complicated their lives so severely they wouldn't recommend it.
it means ur useless and unwanted and you should kill yourself before you start to harrass others and nature included and wasting natures supplements for your silly survival. FACT
What if everyone in the US renounces his citizenship, isn't this the equivalent to selling your own country to the government ?
Whats the odds that Dashlane farms data to pass on to 3rd parties ?
So if the rest of the world taxes based on where you live, but US taxes based on citizenship, does that mean if you move to the US and work there without a citizenship you simply pay no taxes?
So Human rights are ready the rights one has only if they are affiliated with a state?
His head looks strangely large in this video. Wider angle lens or something?
who else thought this was vsause
I thought they deported you to the moon or something.
This is the first time I ever saw you or your channel, immediate advertisements and then in-video advertisement/sponsor. Maybe a short intro to the video before you want to make more money? Not even going to bother seeing the video.
Renouncing your citizenship SHOULD NOT COST ANYTHING! Death to FATCA! The only thing it does is make foreign banks refuse to let Americans have bank accounts so they don't have to comply with FATCA reporting requirements.
The United States is the most retarded country on Earth.
What if an entire nation renounces their citizenship?
so basically the US is a tax prison.
Why do you look like Micheal from Vsauce
In México, nothing happens. Welcome :)
you look like Michael from vsauce
Did you know that the thicker your beard is the likelier you are to go bald!!
Rangel - a democrat and crook....
See this is why america is america and britain is britain america has american homeless people pissing and shitting in our streets yall got abdar from syria who got goat flu
Here in the United States, renouncing your citizenship while still physically being within the borders of the U.S. is absolutely futile and meaningless. In your mind, you may actually believed you accomplished something, but in reality, no. You are still a citizen of the U.S. The only way to renounce citizenship would be to leave the U. S., enter a foreign country, seek out the American Embassy (or Consulate) and make a statement to an American official, stating your intent. YouTube is full of sovereign citizens making such claims at traffic stops or open court. They have never, ever, been sucessful.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamson_Tannehill
I hereby renounce my US citizenship.
You feeling okay Michael?
I wonder what happens if you are born in a country but your parents (who are both citizens) never show you in any official documents ?Meaning you are completely unregistered.
So what are the benefits? Why would someone be able to become stateless by choice?
I clicked becuase I thought this was Michael from V-Sauce. I was very upset lol
Love how much the US cares about the people ??
4:40 Austria isn't part of the Schengen area on this map. But in reality it is. What kind of map is this?
Is that a fake bald head? People go to all sorts of lengths to get some hair on their head!! What did you think? "I wanna look bald without sacrificing my hair" Pffff, I'm moving to a different channel. This relationship isn't working anymore. You better give me back my stuff when I ask for it or I'm sending my mother.
erm, croatia is not in the shengen area. no one probbly noticed or cares, but even tho we are in the eu , we still have more to go to enter the shengen zone
Well, we now know how to populate the moon
4:45 Romania is not in Schenghen area yet, we still have borer control. EU != Schengehn.
I can’t have been the only person that thought this guy was vsauce until he started speaking
I think the map of the schengen area is a bit wrong, because Austria that country south of Germany is defenitly part of it and Northern Ireland doesn't belong to the Republic of Ireland
Whoa. You're not Michael from Vsauce
What happens if you renounce citizenship from every country?
This is a British channel mostly about the USA. This is loosing interest really fast
10:02 AHAHAHAH THAT COUGH
You lok lke an ugly bitch when you talk about dashlane
Lose the benefits: The right to pay taxes? Lose the protections: Getting brutalized by law enforcement & targeted for death by foreign countries.
Are you Vsauce's twin, by any chance?
Some countries WILL NOT ACCEPT that you want to renounce your citizenship. This makes a good case for allowing double citizenship.
IRS Is private owned company design for short period of time collect taxes on international imports to USA. There for IRS simply scams us citizens for some taxes that actually voluntary taxes in the first place. IT is NO LAW where us citizens must pay to unknown private owned company. Please do your own research prior saying word IRS. Thank you.
What if you want to be stateless?
Question: How many countries is it possible to be a citizen of, at the same time?
note in the uk yor ar a subject not a citizen
>without having committed any crime lol
Just a friendly reminder that if you hate the country you live in, you are more than welcome to leave :).
Hey Vsauce, Micheal here..... Ohhhh hmmm...
I wonder how this affects your "identity". The US is currently looking to further 'other' trans and intersex people making it impossible for us(I'm the latter) to update our documentation, among other things. As such, it might be a good idea to leave the country soon before a "legitimate" asylum case could be made, but there are a whole bunch of logistical issues to that.
"without committing a crime" 2:30 that's so retarded, being an illegal immigrant is a crime. They wouldn't be able to arrest you if it wasn't.
What about state taxes? if they can make you pay fed, why not state? I guess I would want to "move" to a state with no state taxes. Wouldn't it be horrible if you couldn't renounce your citizenship because you can't afford the taxes. Then each year the bill gets bigger and bigger. I hope that doesn't actually happen.
I renounce my boner
In my country you can't lose or renounce to your citizenship.
I like @ 1:20 the document lists Ann Arbor, MI as the town, as it is my hometown. They misspelled Washtenaw (Weshtenaw as in the video) county though
Really fk Malaysia I could not retrieve my identification certificate without my Father present even though my Mother is there.... they are fking sexist
They can detain you just because!!! If you aren't on someones papers you gonna go through something hellish. Terrible And lol. An exit tax.... only the US.
Freedom & security are inherently inversely proportional.
I clicked in thinking this was a Vsauce video.
This video could've been waaaaaay shorter!
Well if a person can be stateless, then the children that are born from illegal aliens, are then stateless. They have no ties to America, then they can not become a citizen to America. Wouldn't they have to be deported too?
It costs 400€ in Finland.
FUCK YOU Dashlane! Why the fuck does Dashlane want to hack me to renounce my citizenship?!! Police should arrest them!!!!!
I say we take all the stateless people from every country around the world and dump them in Antarctica and give them the basic supplies to set up a habitable area. Then, after 10 years, whoever is still alive gets to either select the country they wish to become a resident in and get accepted, or choose to continue living in their makeshift community to fend for themselves lol
You look like Vsauce
Your map of the Schengen zone countries is inaccurate.... It looks more like a map of EU member states. The UK for instance is not a Schengen country, neither are Romania or Bulgaria...
The UK is not in the schengen area.
I couldn't get a bank account in Thailand. I hate America!
Government is stupid. The US government is the worst.
Can you start or even own a business if you're stateless?
So if you're stateless, are you off the grid?
Let's see if I got this straight ... If I was born in the USA, with American parents... I am an American citizen. But, at the age of two, I move with in with my grandparents and move to Ireland (or any nation that is not the USA). I am educated and spent all but the first two years of my life in a country that is NOT the USA and have long since become a citizen of that country. I attend college and graduate in Ireland and now making good money with an Irish company. Although I have never received a single benefit from the USA or have ever attempted to do so, because I am also a US citizen - and never made a single cent on US soil or with a US based company - I am required to pay US taxes? If this were the case, I think I would say to the US Government and the IRS... Go fuck yourself! Land of the free? Keep telling yourselves that ignorant bullshit!
Is there any unclaimed land in the world like Antarctica
Shit I almost thought he was about to say hey vsauce
I don't understand is this michael from vsauce or not?
So you’re saying that the mayor of London got upset over unjust taxation of a country from across the pond. Sounds familiar? ??
Why would you have to pay to tell a country to piss off?!?!?
Why would anyone want to be stateless??? As rare as they are.
By the way, It's pretty funny: in the times of the Patriotic War slavery was banned in UK but was legal in US, but now UK considers their citizens as the 'property of the Crown' with no rights to refuse or escape, while in US it is legal to be free.
Hey man, you should remove the UK flag when u said that you can travel with no passport across those borders cuz UK is in the European Union (for bow) but its not fully Schengen. So everyone needs to pass a passport control when going to UK.
US the only free country in the world. Citizenship with no rights to refuse is just a FORM OF SLAVERY. My ancestors were serfs - they were 'things', as furniture or cattle. It was a huge victory of the humanity when humans became recognized to be humans. Do you know what are serfs? They are slaves with the main trait - they were 'citizens' of a particular land which was owned by the serfs owner. Serfs were prohibited to appeal to rules of others' lands, they were prohibited from leaving the land without permission and they must be returned to the land they belonged by the police force and violence. Can you see any difference between serfs in the lands they belonged to and citizens in the lands (countries) they belong to? The 'Masters', owners of 'citizens' (who have no rights to refuse their citizenship) treat their 'human cattle' better then serfs were treated? It is a difference in treatment but not the difference in legal rights to be recognized not as a property but as a human being with free will.
Any particular reason you removed Austria from the EU?
LOL the person who was the owner of that document to renounce american citizenship is now living in Paraguay.
Huh, more proof the US doesn't care about you.
did you just say lithuania..? LIETUVA TEVYNE MUSU...
I actually thought that I clicked on a Vsause video, you to look a litle bit to indifferent
I can't believe Yoshi committed tax evasion
Truth be told i have wanted to move from the USA however i make very little money and can't do it with a family people as why if i'm not a fan of how the usa does stuff do i live here? And I ask you do you have $20000 something i can have becuse that is how much it would cost for everything?
Who the fuck is this hipster soyboy?
No need to renounce your US CITIZENship. Just identify as a US National instead and revoke your election of TAXPAYER status. The IRS recognizes your decision to never file a 1040 again.
I was let down after I realized this isn’t a vsauce video. Knock of British Michael, you got me again...
90% of this video was "However the United States..."
Hi, Vsauce, Ripoff Micheal here.
It's simple, you become a jew
More advertising than content...
Damn Canadians coming down here
Hi, Michael Here, an Welcome to Vsauce
oh hey its fake vsauce
Why does he look like binging with babish
Great grandparents were stateless after the Soviets seized East Prussen. I didn't know this was a thing you could apply for.
Renounceing what you never chose sounds like a fools game, but I suppose if your willing to pay for something that was never vaild (a real thing) at least there's a way to have a piece of paper to state.. what I don't believe in was acknowledge by the aforementioned system of belief , I do not believe in, released me via my petition and payment hereby legaly through validating what I don't believe in. And because they granted me this truth now, Im free. Lol!
What is that map? The UK and EI aren’t in Schengen, but Austria certainly is.
Deportation, camps, barbwire, German shepherds, loudspeakers, lice and fleas, tuberculosis and cholera, mass graves... I LOVE IT ! IMHO, race and culture is more important than citizenship, and a country should only favor immigration and grant citizenship to people whose race and culture is close or related to the given country.
I need to get my eyes checked I thought I was checking out a Michael from Vsauce video, great content here though
You can commit murder
Hi! Just offering some corrections :) The image at 4:44 has a map with a few problems. 1. It shows Northern Ireland as a part of Ireland and consequently it shows the UK without Northern Ireland. The UK is England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. 2. It shows the UK as though it is part of the Schengen Area. It is not.
Funny none of those issues seem to affect illegal immigrants..
A country built by people escaping persecution, persecute people lol.
Buy a sailboat and go stateless. Sounds like freedom to me.
Very nice video, and an interesting topic, but the music playing in the background is super annoying. If you're going to have background music, make it loud enough to actually hear it or don't use it at all. Several times throughout the video I picked up the flutes in the background, without being able to tell what I was actually listening to.
Am I missing something? The citizenship price in USA is $750. Author, where did you get $2350?
Stateless exist, today's day I am stateless
the world should be an open world not a close world. fuck the border and restrictions.
Wonder if being stateless will revoke all contracts and agreements with previous country and allow the people to become the free human beings they were born to be? Or if one could do that another way....?
Bro, There are some state-less kids of Venezuelan parents born in Colombia, because Venezuela is kind of a shithole rn Colombia has decided to not grant the nationality of those babies because our goverment are made out of assholes
You simply fade away out of existence?
Tell them with a serious face, you live in Tongueincheekistan
I have a question, If I wish to renounce my citizenship as one born in America to American parents & an adult who owes no taxes, & it is granted. Once it is granted & I sneak into Canada & promptly turn myself in to the Canadian authorities are they likely to deport me to a third country or allow me to apply for citizenship?
I don't remember anyone teaching this in school (given its been over a decade since I was in high school but still)
No captions???
Lol I’m kurdish been stateless for centuries
I wish you could choose the country you'd like to be a citizen of when you turn 18 or so. I sorta hate where I was born and I don't feel like I belong.. I didn't get to choose. ??
Actually, renouncing U.S. citizenship is not necessarily all that easy, at least if you want to become stateless. A U.S. Court of Appeals earlier this year decided a case in which the plaintiff "has tried to renounce his U.S. citizenship for more than a decade." (Apparently this was because he was a convicted sex offender who didn't want to deal with the problems associated with such in the States. Of course, being a sex offender likely makes him persona non grata for most, if not all, foreign countries, too, so he's probably SOL from a life-choices standpoint.) https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/EB6F9B47E530A701852582D0005708D7/$file/16-5065.pdf The agency-- understandably, given the plethora of problems, described in the video and the court's opinion, that crop up when someone becomes stateless-- tried to argue that you could only renounce citizenship if you had concrete plans on how to deal with becoming stateless, like another country that would accept you. But the court said that was an incorrect reading of the relevant law. It then sent the case back to the agency where, one presumes, it is still kicking around to this day.
That really sucks that you have to be registered to a private FBI search.
New drinking game: every time Simon says citizen or citizenship take a shot. Bet most of you wont last past the first 2 min
I am technically 'stateless'. I was born in shoddy circumstances and have been on my own for almost as long as I can recollect. Never known my parent(s) and at 15 have no documentation. Crossed many a border on multiple continents in my time.
5:02 You show European Countries flags, you have the Irish Tri-Colour covering the whole Island or Ireland, when the North is still very much in the UK
GUYS ITS FATCA
So what of dashlabe gets hacked or got a data breach?
The end made me think of Village of the Damned for some reason ;)
Fact check!! schengen zone in accordance to the 1985 agreement is 26 countries excluding the United Kingdom ,Republic of Ireland and Cyprus. Citizens of the schengen zone as they are also citizens of EU can travel freely to the countries mention above. Although non eu citizens can sometimes travel to schengen zone but have different arrangements with other coutries. The map shown in your video is inaccurate. This is the EU map not the schengen zone
Lol.. "exit tax".. only in America ;p
The more I learn about this country the more I want to leave it
If I got a quarter everytime he said citizen or citizenship, I'd be $5 richer
The US is trying to build one giant prison. It knows it doesn't represent the people and that no one in their right mind would actually want to live here.
Used to like this then came back to see its liberal??
you cat become stateless because wherever you live you will be expected to still pay tax and all that crap and thus you will be a citizen if you like it or not
There is an important caveat to renouncement in the United States. If you don't adhere to the renouncement agreement (most common way is to maintain your right to live in the United States after renouncement) the renouncement will be considered to be done in bad faith and thus void (no refund for the fee) so it can't be done just willy-nilly.
Too bad it's so easy for American companies to move to other nations and avoid paying taxes for the money they make in the US.
I read somewhere recently that you can renounce your US citizenship, but that the US doesn’t recognize it. I wonder.
you cheap Vsauce looking MF
So, like, why would you do this?
There's nothing wrong with arresting people that are in the country illegally. You want to be here? Become a citizen or get a visa, otherwise get the fuck out.
Only stupid people burn bridges, but it takes a special kind of stupid to burn the bridge while standing on it.
My mum is stateless. She is Zimbabwean, but had her citizenship was taken by the dictator of the country, due to beliefs against white farmers. So now she has non. She is married but the UK is so bad and picky on forms that they never responded to her marriage certificate submitted for citizenship. The UK needs to step in in places where a persons belief, heritage and citizenship is under unfair conflict. All she wants is a passport to go see her family, not be stateless and stuck in a country you aren't even considered a citizen after 19 years of residence. Like WTF!!!
You related to vsauce ????
Which countries require you to renounce former citizenship before applying?
What if somebody is set to be deported to their home country, but their home country has ceased to exist (annexed, divided into multiple nations, etc.)
Dude I ? the united states
Is binginging with babish ur alter ego or ur twin brother that got seperated at birth ?
I'm just thinking of people who revoked there citizenship cause they hated America so much and realized it wasn't that bad
In the USA shouldn't they pay us to renounce citizenship? Most people in the U.S.A. cost more than they contribute and thus one less person in the U.S.A. would in most cases help slow the massive debt we have growing. Maybe we should only charge the successful people but then who would take care of our moochers or steal from other countries for us?
I'm American. Man, can my government be real douche bags! No common sense.
6 minutes of this video was a commercial. Go fuck yourself.
Hahahaha. The IRS is America’s greatest weapon. Nukes are just a sideshow...
Question! I’ve done a little research on this but I still want to be 100% sure. I’m an American citizen and my boyfriend is a Japanese citizen (long distance of course). What should I be prepared for if we get married and I move there? Would it be difficult for me to open bank accounts or any other kind of accounts and finances? If I had kids (while living there) they’d automatically be 100% Japanese citizens? Dual? Another thing I’ve always thought about is can I live in America and Japan at the same time? By that I mean going back and forth from each country for an extended period of time (not like a typical “vacation” amount of time). For example let’s say we want to live in California for a few years and get a job there but after a good amount of time move to Japan or vice versa. (I know this is probably exaggerated and most likely an expensive life style but I’m just curious to see if i at least HAVE those options)
You become a citizen of the world! Fuck nationalism!
Being stateless sounds great. My state has never protected me. They provide no assistance at all when my property is stolen, they take my money at every opportunity, and they put my life at risk by starting wars with random countries on a regular basis.
VVVVVVVVVSAAAAAAAUUUUUUCCCCEEEEEEEE
@4:40 - why is Austria withouth a flag? :O
Fuck dashlane
Michel here!
I can see it now, a hacker professional will go after our citizenship and kill it off by making us renounce our citizenship electronically that will clearly fuck our lives up
Citizenship is Amazingk!!
?
I like the United States ?? ?? ?? ??
I thought this was vsauce from the thumbnail
With the real Vsause please stand up..
Of the U.S.A.you may have many problems to be Stateless (no good)very bad ?? ?? ??
beard green?
You may found it difficult to get food to eat and to live very bad ....?? ?? ?? no good..
And no, illegal border hopping aliens are NOT all stateless... most are simply criminals.
It seems like a simple solution would be to tell the person that whether or not they would become a citizen if they renounced their previous citizenship.
wait, this isn't vsauce michael
Boris Johnson is the British Trump. All he lacks is the orange spray tan.
Illegals need deportation. Can't find a country use the ocean. Those without a nation deserve no human rights
Hey I'm down with it you don't want to be American and denounce your citizenship fuck off then make a rash decision too damn bad all the people who said they were leaving when Trump got elected didn't really do it hell he even offered to pay for some of their tickets
I'm a Canadian who got a work visa for a job in Chicago in 2000, but FORGOT to get a Social Security number. Until I got one, I couldn't open a bank account, rent digs or cash my paychecks. I can't imagine what it's like to be stateless.
Tam Honks
I thought this was a vcause video...
figuring out if this was that vsauce guy or the binging babish guy
U look like Vsauce michael
5:10 why is northern Ireland with Ireland people in northern Ireland can have both
Your Schengen map is wrong
You are an Gypsie then
There are also countries like Iran where u can never renounce your citizenship. What I mean is I.e in Iran once u become Iranian u will remain Iranian for the rest of ur life... although Iran doesn't give citizenship to foreigners.
In Brunei, we who were born here are stateless, without given a citizenship. Hahaha. Not strange.
I love you Karl! Great article! :D
lets say you were born in the uk and committed some ungodly crime. for arguments sake an extreme example you shot up parliament and the palace dressed as the queen in a shirt that says I hate my citizenship could they then say that crime was so bad and such a danger to other citizens of the country or the monarch or even govt. and then strip you of citizenship?
Tom Cruise on tropic thunder lol
So if you become stateless and have a criminal record does that go away?
The last bonus fact is very unclear. Ability to travel back is expected, but "going back", i.e. re-applying for citizenship that was renounced before, is a completely different question.
I guess you will have to become a pirate roaming the international; waters of the world.
How to stop paying taxes
Hey vsauce not michael here
Why would you want to renounce your us citizenship? You have so many freedoms. Just move if you don't like it but don't give it away.
Finally an advertisement for something I already use.
I hate the idea that your "owned" by a country, I hate that it prevents movement across borders
I hate the idea that your "owned" by a country, I hate that it prevents movement across borders
Wasn't there and old story about such a person called "The Man without a country?"
I would much rather get deported than renounce from the states, they keep raising the price because the government knows they fucked up putting that oompa loompa in charge. fuck him and all that he stands for, i hope he gets a hang nail that becomes infected
so to have rights you have to belong to the cult.
What an interesting video.
I wonder if any immigrants have ever done that. If someone was detained while crossing a border and renounced their citizenship while in detention they wouldn't be able to be returned if their home nation rejected them.
why are you basing the video around america when there laws are so different to the rest of the world . ?
What about people born in trailer parks?
Sort out the echo/reverb on your sound....
You're like the British version of Vsauce Michael
what kind of people become stateless? mostly poverty stricken and africans? or does it afflict rich counries and people too? Bit shocking how there are enough stateless people to found a new state. The guy born in the USA but being British sounds like a freak case to me.
Some nationalities can't be renounced, such as the Moroccan or the Turkish nationality. And that is a very serious problem, especially for Turkish young men. Even if they have never been on Turkish soil, they have to serve in the Army.
I once had a colleague who had been an Iraqi (? well one of those nice liberal countries in the middle east) jew. When he went to his embassy in London to renew his passport, they promptly confiscated it and told him to go away and not come back. Thereby making him stateless. He travelled on a document from the UK government which was a sort of stateless persons passport. One very large sheet of paper onto which various visa stamps could be applied and which said he was nominally under the protection of the UK. It worked very well, whilst I had to queue to get through US immigration, he was fast tracked!
This is a known thing in Brunei, there's a lot of stateless Chinese who were here since before country's independence
I've lived in the US for 16 years, dual to US and Canada. I'd love to go back to Canada, but the taxes would be such a burden and I don't want to give up my dual status. My brother stayed in Canada and even though he's never lived or worked in the US, he's had to start filing under that law and the F-bar costs him a few thousand dollars each year just to file. If the US wanted to go after the weathly ex-pats, they should have allowed exemptions for lower income ex-pats simply because the costs are so outrageous for the citizens when the government isn't even getting anything but paperwork out of them.
Why his voice is so fucking annoying?
I click on this video because I mistaken you as Michael from Vsauce but this is a decent video
If you have to pay some one for your freedom, it means you are a slave.
Why would any American citizen renounce their citizenship?
Not vsauce
I don't care
If I could also cease being subjected to a State's laws, regulations, etc, then that would be an upside to Statelessness.
On the background image of Europe when you talked about the countries being in the Schengen Area the country of Romania was also highlighted, Romania however is not in Schengen.
Why would I renounce my citizenship? That would be moronic as I live in the US.
States are the worst thing humanity could've wished for, beginning from the fact that it's simply a way to take a slice of the earth for themselves, and there are way too many, too much different from one another.. there is always gonna be conflict, different ideals and religions, when everyone acts enclosed in itself, it's anti-human, humanity is all about sharing knowledge and combining strenght, it has even brought us to the brink of extintion at least three times, even with nukes, could you believe people were ready to bring doom on themselves just for.. disagreements, to say the least. We risked it probably more times but they are not popping in my mind as of right now, and let's not talk about how unstable this system is, judging by the fact that there are stateless born people, and those who want to renounce it, probably for another citizenship, but still, it's my point exactly. I wonder how life would've been if we were cruising all togheter just from the beginning of times. Ugh, yes i know, i dream too much
I thought this way Vsause in the thumpnail
What is the thought process for an American citizen to renounce their citizenship without any other citizenship unless they are complete morons?
I know somone whos stateless it sucks
I'm a sovereign citizen.
This is a question I had/have a few months ago.
@Today I Found Out You glossed over one of the key qualifications to renounce U.S. Citizenship: Under the applicable law, 8 USC § 1481(5), the renuciation must be executed "before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States IN A FOREIGN STATE," i.e., you must be outside of the USA at the time.
Anyone here try Dashlane? is it any good?
Just read the buck act and you'll understand the difference of a Unite state citizens and a state citizenship, one is under article 1 and the other is article 3 of the constitucional...this video was long for nothing.SMH
I want to become a citizen of EARTH! I never gave any rights to some third parties to label me with a "nationality". Nobody has the right to stop me from moving around my home freely (and by home i mean our planet). Laws must apply to HUMAN beings, not on basis of "nationality". Being a human is a fact, having a "nationality" is subjective. One must not be proud of being a citizen of country X, one must be proud of 1) humanity's achievements and 2) of his own achievements. Every other pride that makes you feel like you are better than some other ethnic group is BS.
If I denounce my citizenship do I nolonger have to pay taxes?
If the U.S. really wants to go after tax evaders they should just pass a law that says any business that takes place in the U.S. would have those profits subject to taxation.
Wait a second.... Austria is in the Schengen, why is it kept blank on the map?
I had a professor from china who renounced his Chinese citizenship to become a US citizen. He told me it was the weirdest feeling getting a visa to visit his parents. I can't imagine
What might happen if you live on unincorporated land, declare sovereignty as a nation, create your own passport and as the leader of said nation, give yourself diplomatic immunity? As long as the UN allows you in, you can be a nation of one.
Functional programmers: heavy breathing
I clicked the video because I thought it was a Vsauce, Michael here video lool
5:02 Ireland looks...different...
Thank you. It was informing. I enjoyed it.
Bootleg British Vsauce ass
Propaganda for states, you don't need a citizenship, it's a legal fiction to control you. There are plenty of ways to go anywhere you want without a citizenship, just make sure you carry an assault rifle everywhere you go.
I recently read a book called "The Art of Not Being Governed" that explores several aspects of statelessness in human history where it appears it was clearly the preference of the people involved. Many of the "hill people" of Southeast Asia have a history of flight from states, with a number of their cultural practices rendering them more difficult to make and keep "legible" to nearby states, thus avoiding conscription, corvee labor, taxes, religious persecution, and direct slavery depending on the particulars of time and place. Modern nations like Vietnam and Myanmar have gone to great lengths to separate these people from their preferred condition as non-citizens.
Woooooh, Simon, you are looking particularly handsome in this video!! I just had to turn on the A/C and sit down for this one! Wonderful lighting, great shots, and perhaps an upgraded camera or format your cinematographer is using (?) is certainly highlighting all your attributes. ??
Hello I'm Simon Whistler and I'm responsible for literally all of your free time.
i renounce my humanity
How many countries could one technically become a citizen of?
I wanted to give up UK citizenship as I don't want any of their "benefits" - But the fuckers won't let you .....
Since when the UK is part of the Shengen area ?
Hey Vsauce! Michael Here
Here's a tip DON'T RENOUNCE YOUR CITIZENSHIP
Millions of Kurds are still stateless.
Only question I wonder regarding the Stateless who have a run in with immigration enforcement but who were born within the United States and aren't a citizen of another nation? Have there been any cases where a US Born Stateless individual got in trouble with the law and Immigration had kicked them out of the United States to a country they don't belong to? or does immigration eventually cut them loose and are allowed to remain in the United States after their prison sentence?
Almost Every Word Of The Title Starts With A Capital Letter.
the civilized world protect the citizenship of their people
did you just imply my gender? #triggered
Fuck amerikkka! Found out how shitty they are and how many people were getting out of the shit hole and quadrupled the price to get out of said shithole to prevent them from leaving. Lmao. Hope the muslims or Russians gape amerikkkas asshole sooner than later
I have a friend who happened to be a stateless person and he is 21 years of age. His parents had  passed away years back and currently he is unable to get citizenship in Malaysia. My main concern is his health, he could not get treatments from the hospital because they simply could not register his identity. Secondly that he is unable to find work legally because of his identity issue. Is there any solution to counter this issue?
Is there a radio playing in the background?
this guy looks like johnny sins
This was interesting. Thank you for this information.
So is this guy trying to get views by looking exactly like vsauce or is this just a big coincidence?
Love my country. Don't always agree with it but, it truely is unique.
Rich people abusing the system. Shocker.
If you do that in America Trump will deport your ass.
why would you choose this?
Oh Man Michael’s really nailed the accent for this Vsauce episode.
This just makes me realize how many documents I have registered with the government. Man, if I ever want to disappear I’ll have to assume my alias and live in a forest.
TL;DR version = Don't do this.
citizen of earth
Hi vsauce Michael here ??
I typically avoided this channel because of unnecessary video length... Seriously it takes 15 mins to discuss when you can compressed it to five minutes
Can they be deported to Bir Tawil?
Why the fuck does it cost money to renounce a citizenship? The hell? It's like Marriage. Govt fucks everything up.
Anyone else notice this guy is an unusually likeable clickbait guy? Cant deny the clickbait, cant deny you want to groom his beard with your teeth.
Hi Simon. Can you do a video of you whistling for us.
mankind is so primitive. there really is no hope...
you dont even need to be a citizen to get rights in this country we call the USA with all the illegals marching in plain sight, taking advantage of medical, etc
This is very stupid
Anyone else keep pausing the video to see the the distant background music was coming from the video or from somewhere else around you?
272 pounds!! Good Jesus id have to mail my self to renounce my citizenship ??
so I have always wonder me being a member(with tribal I.D.) of a native American tribe. If I renounce my citizenship I should be safe on the rez.
Nationality is not citizenship.....
Send Stateless people to the Antarctic! lolol
The United States is a tax and debt trap.
Can you even do that?
Thats simple, I'm not a Nationalist, I refuse to bow, to pledge allegiance, to pay taxes yet I am a American citizen, I don't involve my self in statist ordeals, such as voting, for senators, mayors, presidents or any authoriotys, I don't in any way give any consent to be governed, I was just born here, live here and pay taxes on things I purchase simple as that. I'm American in culture but I am sovereign in self ownership.
I swear to god I thought you where Michael from vsauce
Just dump them in the sea beyond 12 nautical mile line! With a life-jacket or a small boat, of course, no need for unnecessary cruelty.
Another fact worth noting: If a child is born to Swedish parents outside of Sweden, that child will only be recognized as a Swedish citizen if the mother is a Swedish citizen.
Get the map of Europe correct dude. Part of the island of Ireland is in the UK!
Because the United States has different citzenship, the state one isn't the federal one, but they will not help you know your free and under the privileges and immunities clause. Because contracts overrule constitution. Because citzenship is a contract, sign nothing, and you will have freedom
i am From the republic of Arizona
You can be a citizen of a republic of (one of the several States) without being a federal citizen.
I'm surprised you didn't mention "Sovereign Citizens."
I am stateless because South Africa's government is a cesspool of missmanagement and no body knows what to do with my case an therefore choose to ignore it. My parents don't have the deep pockets needed to make things happen... and even though I can get into a medical degree at the top universities in the country, I won't. And this irritates me to no end. Well, everyone's got their own problems and being stateless and existentially depressed just happens to be mine....
Simon, your map accompanying discussion of Schengen Area includes the UK which has never participated in it.
For those interested in which countries do not allow dual citizenship (for the most part) as I was, they are: Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, China, Djibouti, El Salvador, Estonia, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Montenegro, Netherlands, Nepal, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Tanzania, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. http://nomadcapitalist.com/2014/04/25/countries-allow-dual-citizenship/ Honestly, that's a lot more than I expected. Tis a shame, it would be awesome if it was possible to get citizenship from every country. Just like Pokemon, gotta catch them all.
I got an ad for immigration law firm lol
Vsauce your British accent is pretty good.
Nationality =! Citizenship. At least the way what the terms mean in here.
The schengen map is incorrect. Should not include the CTA.
You become a Terran?
No one will acknowledge my Kekistani citizenship. ??
4:51 The UK and Ireland was never part of the Schengen area, because of the Commonwealth passport union. Norway however is part of Schengen despite not being EU members, probably because of the Nordic countries long standing no-passport collaboration. Closing that border would have been very costly for both countries.
You know you've been watching a youtuber a long time when you start to see he's aged since you started watching him. Deeper creases and lines that weren't there when he started. There's another youtuber who slowly gained more and more weight over the months. Do others know of youtubers who visibly changed over the months and years?
Sure sounds like a mob protection racket to me. Somehow Governments think they are the source of all rights. Don't want to be in our gang or pay our tribute? that's fine. We'll just treat you like even less than an animal. How many animals need passports to cross borders or permission to obtain sustenance? Fuck the States!
One more piece of evidence suggesting that we are not free peoples; rather, we are owned by the state. A birth certificate amounts to a title of ownership.
Small Point: http://www.unhcr.org/un-conventions-on-statelessness.html
The map of Europe at 5:00 is not Schengen area UK and Ireland are not a part of it and Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia are not members but only candidates.
This is possible in the US? Here you cannot renounce your citizenship if you do not have another citizenship, in that case the Government itself will not grant you that right.
Renouncing citizenship was probably better when there were still parts of the globe not yet claimed by a nation...
So what about the so called Sovereign citizens? ??
All I want is to renounce this shitty ass US citizenship so "Big Brother" can't track me like cattle.
You can tell Charles Rangel is lying because his lips are moving. Such a racist a^^hole.
Why having a baby when you have no citizenship...that's just wreckless.
2:13. FOUR MILLION stateless people in the United States?! How do you figure that? Just because these people are illegal aliens, this does not make them stateless. The have citizenship in their countries of origin. According to the UN Commission for Refugees, there are 3.5 million stateless people spread in 64 countries.
Don't you think this all sounds absurd? Shouldn't statelessness mean you go anywhere and don't pay taxes, but don't get any social benefits in return? Treating statelessness like a crime is saying you are not born free, you must choose at least one master. Is man born free?
So in Stan of Arabia, since he didn't go through the right legal channels, he hadn't really renounced his American citizenship. (Also he wouldn't have had the authority to renounce the citizenship of his wife and children.)
Not really true at all. If I gave up my citizenship Id prolly have much more than I have now. Cuz our government cares more about non citizens than they do citizens .
Just wondering, The fuq the third amendment got to do with schools ? I will never vote against it. I will never have any military personnel stay in my home in peacetime or in war. So wtf does a school have to do with it ? Am I missing something ? or just dumb as fuck ?
Your a fucking traitor unless you were English
The baltics are rightful russian clay! Russia controlled these territories longer then the so called baltic states!
It's not a "double tax." As you noted, the U.S. provided tax credits for taxes paid to another country. Tax is only due if the U.S. tax rate happens to be higher than that of the other country. If the other country has a higher tax rate, then the U.S. citizen ends up paying nothing to the U.S. In effect, the system ensures that taxes are paid up to but not more than whatever the highest tax rate the taxpayer would be subject to--either the U.S. or the other nation. That is not a double-tax.
While I'd be fine not being a citizen of this farce of a country... there's nothing gained by jumping through hoops to give them money for the opportunity. I pay them taxes for them to fuck me over at every opportunity.
Unrelated I hate PragerU ads
If you are stupid enough to renounce your US citizenship than you deserve the hassle. People die for the freedoms you so frivolously throw away. Good riddance.
Why did you show an israeli document? All palstine people who resided in israel when it became israel were offered israeli citesenship and both jordan and egypt accepted palestinian people as citesens
So I can't just become a citizen of the Universe? Because that's how I feel!
I wonder if citizenship will become the infamous 'mark of the beast.'
lol gypsies.
I got clear permission to immigrate to Taiwan before I renounced US citizenship (which was free back in 2003).  I only needed to pay for postage a few times for paperwork to go back and forth.  I was stateless from October until around March of 2004.  Next year I plan to visit USA again using my Taiwan passport.  That's going to be interesting in Immigration at the airport.  HA!
Relocate them to Antarctica.
All the stateless folk should buy up a particularly nice undersea island chain, hire a big Japanese/Chinese organisation to do some seasteading, and create a giant commune.
What i gather from this is that the US is very touchy. "Oh things didnt work out? Well you should have thought of that before you hurt my feelings by rescinding then huh?"
america does NOT have a nationality... By Function, NOT definition...
What a surprse, the US is shit and the only one among all these first world nations who does this. Of course. Why is this? Every time I see a video like this, it's always the US being the only one who doesn't do the obvious, to the detriment of the population.
Being stateless shouldn't be that much of a pain in the ass. I live on a given chunk of land, so I have to be part of that chunk of land's system?
Ya where do you get deported to
5:09 The map is incorrect. The UK is not part of the Schengen area.
Re the mid way advert, while I'm very supportive of the technology, a shockingly near ubiquitously large proportion of online Bitcoin exchanges etc… have gone though same tedious loop. It starts "give us your details, give us your details, all your details, now, I might report you to the authorities if you don't give us all your details _right now_", followed rapidly by "oh shiz, criminals stole all our data, oops."
States mean nothing. They merely attempt to usurp the authority of tribe. One cannot renounce ones genes.
The term "national pens" seems very relevant at the moment.
MAYBE-speaking for the United States: it may not be possible to legally renounce your citizenship due to a clause in the constitution which makes all persons born on U.S. soil a citizen just by birth. I suppose we could argue that citizenship "rights" can be waived but does that section in the constitution also mean that citizenship "rights" can be regained simply by demand and without charge? Why would a country force U.S. citizenship on someone? TAXES...all citizens living abroad are still subject to U.S. taxes.
It would be good if the UN had an "Earth Citizen" system. You wouldn't be linked to any country but you don't have the issues of being stateless.
you can be detained and tortured in many places including the US without concrete evidence or even a warrant. thanks to 'patriot act' and other 'anti-terror' laws. so your citizenship doesn't matters in this case, the only reason governments love to operate within legal boundaries (that they themselves have written) is because it gives the general populous the false feeling of fairness and security. stateless people are the only truly free people, and to see the state of freedom just look what happens to them. we didn't go far from middle ages with kingoms and kings, just the executions became more boring...
Stateless = Sovereign citizen. Also a state of complete delusion.
Hey Vsauce,
what should I do?? i m Tibetan and live in Europe if i refuse the India refugees papers and holding a Europe citizen after that i m not welcome in Tibetan colony in India as foreigner but my mom sister brother all are there in Tibetan colony .they told us you needed PAP to permit to visit to the colony it took 3 months to get if family got emergency must wait for 3 month for permit, if you went there without permit police will inquiries and asking big amounts of money nearly 600 euros for bribe to see his or her family one time by day. pap means protect area permit but most of mixed them into Indian so i really don't understand why they Dalai lama Administration made that rule with India and made difficult life in Tibetan peoples and made opportunity Indian police to earn money with easy way
Would have been nice if you would have included the benefits of being stateless - this way your video seems biased. Which is a shame.
ask Mikheil Saakashvili what he did
Total horseshit video. I have been stateless for so long. In urban areas with skilled and professional law enforcement, it is indeed possible to live with no ID, stateless and on the street. Make friends with the police, dont cause trouble, speak the lingo and conduct yourself properly. You will be fine.
I am a Citizen of Industry.
6:00 in israel, you are a child to a jewish mother you are concidered a jew and therefor you can apply for citizenship, and that's the reason that the Arab nations exiled off jews when the state of Israel was founded.
If I ever earn income in excess of 160k, I probably won't care that I pay a bit to the IRS. How much could it be, anyway, if they do consider all of my tax obligations to Germany, which is almost 50% at that point
Romania is not part of Schengen, small error on your map there :)
soy
You have seriously underrepresented the difficulty of giving up American citizenship. You also didn't make any distinction between renunciation and relinquishment. I would use the analogy of those annoying operating system pop up warnings. America REALLY doesn't like admitting some people don't want to be Americans, so in addition to making it expensive, America constantly adds hoops. They keep asking you if you want to do it and make you keep coming back to meeting after meeting. The goal is to discourage you and hope you'll give up. Renunciation is for people who want to avoid taxes. But people who do it for other reasons would relinquish. The US essentially treats anyone giving up US citizenship as criminals.
I’ve never had any citizenship in the world. It’s a hassle. When the USSR fell some about 1 million people in Latvia received noncitizens passports.
So what about sovereign citizens?
A little off topic. People born in Kenya can always claim they were born in Hawaii.
'merica
Section 12 of Canada's copyright act is Her Majesty's claim to everything in Canada. If all the titles to all property are copyrighted by Her Majesty, then all property in Canada is claimed to be her property. Birth certificates are copyrighted, so then which of the attributes of the birth certificate are mine? If I renounce my citizenship, should I keep using the name to do business? Is it really my citizenship that I would be renouncing, or would it be Her Majesty's citizenship of the copyrighted person that she claims to own and yet which her agents simultaneously claim to be me? Am I the property being claimed? It is both amusing and nauseating that the vast majority of us think entirely within the conditioned models of reality enforced in the public mind. Read the comments ridiculing those that have foolishly taken to claiming sovereign citizen status. The ridiculers have forgotten to check the validity of citizenship, generally. We're apes. The legal system is a ritualized dominance hierarchy. If other apes knew about pen and paper, they, too, would write down their dominance hierarchy and call it good. Property ownership is an expression of territoriality, and I think I've shown how it is a lie. The lawyers have us playing a twisted game of words where we're trained to agree to be Her Majesty's actors in her fiction. That's one way of describing it. BTW, the name on the birth certificate seems to be the mark of the beast, without which you will be unable to buy or sell. In the book of revelation in the bible, it says you need the mark of the beast to do business. If you don't have the mark of the beast, you cannot exist in commerce. You should not be able to use a bank account. You would have no driver's licence, no health card, no diploma from a school, no social insurance number, no nothing. If you're not a citizen, you're not governed. There can be no speeding tickets for non-members. Yes, I realize this is confusing. Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and render unto God that which is God's? Caesar is a dominant ape. If someone that was previously aware of the copyright on the name they're using wishes to provide me with some information that they think I might be missing, I'd be happy to entertain new thoughts. I don't need to hear from the Homer Simpson school of thought.
@09:59, my understanding of the Dark Web is it's called the Dark Web because it CAN'T be monitored. This is the reason why normal Browsers like Google and Bing can't be used to browse the Dark Web.
From your thumbnail. I thought you were vsauce.
ITS A COMMERCIAL - ITS A COMMERCIAL !!!!! RUN AWAY, ITS A TRICK !!!!
I wonder how many people renounce American citizenship, because it's a shit hole country.
Question, if I renounce my citizenship and pay the stupid bill... do I still have to pay taxes on the bill? If so, then explain logic in that.
"Stateless" person sounds cool. Like if you performed some major deed and went down in history as a "stateless" individual.
how many times did he say citizen and citizenship hahha gave me a headache but good video great information to know
But but... Almost all Americans are illegal immigrants??
Aren't you just playing into the state by using their language?
As Sheldon Cooper says in an episode " Sail the high seas as a pirate"
Today I found out that Switzerland joined EU while Austria left! :)
Oh Simon it would not be one of your videos with out a mistake. At 5:02 you showed a map of the EU and reported as a map of the Schengen Area. The UK and Ireland are not in the area. and Bulgaria,Croatia, Cyprus and Romania haven't technically joined it yet.
11:05 is when the ad ends
i am an earthling. prove me wrong.
So how do "sovereign citizens" fit into this? Y'know, those people who deny the authority of the government of the country they live in?
Must be nice not to be a citizen of hypocritical war mongering countries
But we already did that we kicked ass and made our own country https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamson_Tannehill
huh.... now im curious if it would be best if most people in the west simply denounced citizenship en masse seeing how messed up the world become... who cares if you cant own a house, your not getting one anyways may as well just wander around the midwest? maybe that will happen regardless : /
Um... You can be a dual citizen in America. https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality/Dual-Nationality.html
The deep web and the dark web really aren’t that frightening; the deep web is any webpage that can only be accessed if you’re logged into an account, and the dark web is untracked browsing (such as one of your sponsors, tunnel bear). Yes, people use the dark web for nefarious actions, but that doesn’t mean that it’s inherently bad in and of itself. ?? The more you know ??
My birth documentation was lost by south african bureaucrats. I needed two witnesses and a dr to confirm that it was me that was born (i was 22) but i wasnt able to fly to africa because i had no pasport. 5 years later i receved duel citizenship. Emigrated to australia and have been fighting for residency for the last 9 years. 50% of my life my citizenship has been my life ??
Never will I renounce beloved Kekistan
He talks way too fast. How about taking a breath every once in a while.
Thought this was Vsauce lol
I honestly thought u was vsauce Michael here when I clicked. Was a nice surprise when u turned out not to be. ??
I wish you dig a bit more in the volontary renounce. I find rather disturbing to be owned by what so ever country. And there are documentation you can have to travel and so even if you renounce your country citizen. Heinstein did it, as an example.
This genuinely surprised me. I had no idea it was even possible to renounce your citizenship. Admittedly with the state of how the US currently is the idea of renouncing my citizenship is tempting, but would be the most single-handedly stupid thing I could do given how much it can backfire on you for doing so.
If you lose the benefits, you lose the duties and liabilities
Detain them for 6 months, and then re-arrest them at the exit of the prison. ??
Gee I should do this so I can stay in the USA as a disadvantaged foreigner
What a fucked up system, they own us like cattle and we have no choice in the matter
Bah...thought this was a Vsauce video
this guy definitely has a cuckoldry fetish
It's funny, as the 14th amendment states all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. And the Supreme Court ruled long ago that "No one can remove the citizenship of a natural born citizen"; Shouldn't even the person themselves be counted as someone, therefore shouldn't be allowed to renounce their own citizenship? Purely hypothetical as since its the person asking to not be a citizen, they aren't likely to then argue in court they shouldn't be allowed lol.
As an Austrian the picture I’m 4:44 bothers me more than it probably should...
I feel plenty trinis stateless cause sometimes there are big people who cant even get birthcertificates
HEY VSAUCE, MICHAEL HERR
If you're in a country (any country) without having the proper documentation then you're already in an ILLEGAL STATUS and have, in fact, BROKEN LAWS. So, let's not perpetuate the bullcrap about them not having "broken any laws".
Can I be a citizen of an online nation? :p
This nigga a dumbin ass liberal. If your in MY country illegally and mooching off OUR tax payer money you shouldn’t be here. #ILLEGALS should be euthanized
The Jews will send you to destroyed some country is what happens
If i hade to not become an Aussie just to be a snobby bloody Yanky I’m not doing it
Better solution.... Let's all become stateless.
So stateless people get less rights then illegals
So is this why Ted Nugent didn't leave America ( as promised ) when Obama was elected? : /
I have got a feeling that one of the unlisted reasons the American immigration (or rather, their "anti-immigration") system keeps getting locked up and encouraging decidedly evil things to happen is because the home nation of the refugees will not take them back, resulting in a stateless clog up.
Everyone in the world. Renounce your citizenship. Simultaneously.
Start a video with an ad and I won't watch it.
Hyped to renounce my Us passport
Orange man bad.. must have
My parents wanting to move back to the US in 2011 makes so much more sense now
Seems like US policy bashing is the new meta.
When the Foreign Account Compliance Act of 2010 took effect it was rumored the US dollar would no longer be the defacto global currency. I’m just saying. I suspect those rumors were probably spread by people who were going to be adversely affected by the new law.
Why on Earth would you ever renounce your citizenship though?
This video's audio needs mastering for cellphone devices. Sounds like I'm listening underwater in a tin can.
Reminds me of GM Robert Fischer
Before watching, I don't know, butt I'm not gonna try it either. After watching, nice ad.
In the US, and most other countries, probably, getting a birth certificate is crucial. Without one, a person has a hard time getting a job, getting a driver's license, traveling, proving citizenship, getting a bank account, getting ID, going to college, etc. When my first son was born, it took a month to get the county clerk to give me a birth certificate, even though the law said she had to. I visited her in person several times, called several times, had someone call and threaten to get a lawyer involved...I quoted the law that she was not following to her, and her response was "but how do I know he's really your baby?" I offered to being in my placenta and show it to her (it was legal proof of birth in that state), lol...I actually didn't have it, but I was mad at the time. Eventually she gave it to us. All of that was because he was born at home. I asked her how she knew the other babies she issued birth certificates for were really the children of the parents the form listed (well because the hospital says so...), Well, in this case. I say so...do you want me to testify under oath? Like, hospitals sometimes mix up kids...very rarely, and sometimes the dad on the form is not really the biological dad, but...a form is just a form, and it doesn't matter who submits it, there is still a human writing down what that human claims is truth on the form. Legally, anyone can submit the form, and the county clerk is legally bound to record the birth and issue the certificate. Finally, she did.
Is there anyway to be a citizen of earth?
you look like vsauce, but your videos are actually good. Hah.
America and one country in Africa, are the only two countries which tax their citizens when theyre abroad. And youre wrong that it had nothing to do with politics and they just happened to be abroad. The majority left because of both taxes and regulation that was being laid on thick from the Obama administration. Peter Schiff, Doug Casey, and Jim Rogers to name but a few are famous people who have all left the US, and mostly cause they see it turning into a shit hole. Schiff was forced to take nearly all of his business out of the USA cause of regulation, and being a foreign customer with not enough money in the account to make the regulation cost worth it, i was forced to close my account. Obama's USA for you. Will that reverse under Trump? Maybe to a limited degree, but not by much I reckon
Damn the US is savage. Never giving up my American citizenship
Florida is like America's Italy.
So if youre stateless, with money, then you dont need to pay tax, or can pay very little and get most back that you do pay. I know you never brought that up, i just thought that i should. You look after yourself and at a fraction of the cost it costs government in tax, saving you a good difference. Even if youre working class you can do better. Eg. British NHS costs 2100 per person, you can get insurance for 500 and cover your family. Get a life insursnce policy and it can act like a savings account too, you cashing it in when it matures. Cover and saving? You bet your ass. Government over charges and under delivers. Youre better with the market, and be better still if the parsasite of government wasnt such a burden on it!
Deport them to Antarctica.
This video is unnecessarily long.
I didn't even know you could renounce your citizenship without belonging to another country.
Well, you can always buy a Sealand or Monaco citizenship if it is that important. lol
Sovereign citizens take note
Bunch of anarchists trying to become stateless because. Anarchy meme.
Why does it cost something to renounce your citizenship?
Can I get the American forms to send a few "friends"?
Sometimes I wish I could just be a citizen of the world.
You have a great head shape!
one world, one people, one dream, let us drop the notion of nations and focus on being human and making the world more than what it was yesterday.
Simple solution. Drop them into international waters. :>
So if I buy property and pay it off so it's all mine then renounce my citizenship would I be able to to live on my property and not pay taxes?
I like your channel, and enjoy your videos. But when you have multiple pitches for advertisers in your videos, it shits on people like myself who PAY to have Youtube Red as to avoid unwanted banter about things people are trying to sell. I’m reminded of a quote: “Advertisements are a tax you pay for a completely unremarkable product or service.” I shouldn’t be taxed twice.
You get sent to Egypt and chained to a boat south down the nile. State of denial
I think you are conflating stateless people who have immigrated to a country with stateless people who were born in that country and refused the right of citizenship. those are very different situations.
The US Govt won’t let you renounce your citizenship if you don’t have another citizenship.
The US is trying to render a friend of mine, born in the US, stateless, disputing the validity of her Maine birth certificate, with no indication of what country they think she is from
Hmm, had dual citizenship I had to sign away to get into the military. No big loss, the other country was Iran. I'm old and my parents were horny newlyweds while in that country.
intill dashling gets hacked
Thankfully Hillary didn't win in '16 otherwise I would have felt what it was like firsthand. I assume you'd lose rights to social security too
Who is doing your editing now? The quality of the cuts have changed noticeably.
So the land of the free keeps you a slave wherever you are until you've bought yourself out?
I'm self employed and I live in the UK, but I'm a US citizen. The US charges a ridiculously high self employment tax. So a couple years ago, I only earned about $500 for the whole year, but still had to pay about $70 of it in taxes to a country I haven't lived in for 13 years. And you can imagine the difficulty I'm having, with that income level, in trying to save up money to get UK citizenship and then, even more expensively, get rid of the curse that is US citizenship. Then Trump goes around threatening to take away citizenship of people who protest him, or don't worship flags or whatever. Great! Sign me up! I will have explosive diarrhea all over an American flag inside the nearest Trump hotel if it'll save me $2500.
It's sounding more and more like America is among the least free countries in the world. ??
I thought you were Michael Stevens
Citizenship problems in Saudi Arabia you say? Perhaps this convienient bone saw will help
I lost my wallet and thus my photo id. Went to the dmv only to find out my birth certificate expired. I'm de facto stateless til I get the fucking mess straightened out. Ugh.
STATELESS? Don't you mean free? So you have to belong to somebody or stay in jail? We are slaves after all!
This Communist sellout did not mention that the reason for increase of United States Citizen renouncing Citizenship in 2010 was because of high taxes and regulations Under the Obama administration.
You'd be an alien. Simple as that. if your not on thier bank roll your nothing and no one. Why do you think they made bridges? I hate it , we have all these houses with no one in them and they rot . They know the homeless could have them . We have no homeless. we have assholes, who make people homeless and degrade them. Shame on the governments, and banks . You know, you can house people! families, the vets! You use people and then throw them away like garbage. Just like pink said , HEY YOU WHITEHOUSE! TOWN HOUSE PROUD MOUSE ! HA HA CHARADE YOU ARE !
Dashline will protect my citizenship? OK...
Why tf does every mfer look like a generic ass vsauce? Is this a thing now?
Why would anyone want to renounce their citizenship? I got Venezuelan, USA and a Spain one lol
Find some land, claim it as yours, arm yourself, write up a bunch of documents, print money and passports, convince several hundred other people to join your new kingdom, renounce citizenship, fight to the death for the land. If your army can keep hold of the land for long enough, you could seek recognition as a new country. Doing this on US land is probably not a good idea. Would probably be a better idea in some poverty-stricken country maybe in Africa or South America. For it to be successful, you need lots of citizens to side with you and be willing to fight to the death for that new country. This is simply a matter of marketing. Find out what the majority of the locals want that their current government can't provide, then provide it in exchange for loyalty. Give them a good life and treat them better than they have ever been treated. Convince them to be very patriotic to your new country. Similar happened in Germany in the early 1900s. A small group of men managed to take over an entire country and keep hold of it for an extended period of time and the majority of the citizens loved it. They would have survived has it not been for the whole anti-Jew thing. Had they gone about it a little differently, Germany would still be National Socialist and there would have never been a WWII. If you go about this plan to form a new country, you have to tread lightly and know your stuff or some bigger more established country will send in their troops and destroy you and everything you worked so hard for. It might be safer to just infiltrate a government then, from the inside, take complete control so you can do what needs to be done. Watch out for assassins though.
Say what??? You mean that you can tell master to go shuve it? Hahahahahahahahahah!!! I am free!! Thank God almighty! Thank God almighty I am about to be free!!

random question......... can you be a citizen in mor than one country at a time without the need for a dual nationality passport?
In Iraq we have Kawliya who we do not give citizenship to. Basically they are very poor people who migrated from India to Iraq hundreds of years ago, they never fit into the country culturally. Iraq is a a Muslim country and the Kawliya are known for sexually soliciting their women for money, therefore society never accepted them and they cannot get citizenship. Their name Kawliya actually means whore in Iraqi.
If you renounce your citizenship from the United State of America - Does that mean that you'll get all the Social Security money that they took from you?
Reminds me of the story "The Man Without A Country". Can't recall the authors name tho..
I love the wording of the video title.
Ohhhh, I so wish american liberals would renounce their statehood.... America would be a better place.
We need to make 100% of the people stateless.
I so wish you were my neighbour and i could hear you talk about stuff all day
I can't wait for the adults to show up.
I am stateless. It is horrible
Just send them to Guam. Easy peasy
okay that all sounds sucky but is there a benefit to not being part of a country? like whats cool about being stateless? anything? or is it all just not good?
Like the bonus fact said, my brother lives in Switzerland, so now he has to pay taxes to both the US and Switzerland, which ends up being approximately all his money. Switzerland isn't exactly known for being cheap to live in! Also, like he said, it's almost impossible for him to get a good Swiss bank account, making it super difficult to rent from some places.
Dashlane is absolutely horrible. Only reason I use it is because LastPass was bought by LogMeIn, which is worse.
I've always wondered this. Huh
So a terrorist, rapist, or burglar can come into the country without any legal process and you're gonna try to claim that the legal process of keeping those types of people out of our country is a problem? LOL..
They committed a crime by coming into the country illegally you fucking idiot
Your show is the shit. ????
Thought this v sauce
You should have that Smallwood guy do your videos. always feel like falling asleep when this guys voice kicks on. seems like a good elementary school teacher. good content boring voice. laugh more, stop selling that crack on your videos. lol
Personally I think that if you renounce your US citizenship you should be barred from ever re-obtaining it.
tl;dr You are a slave to the government
I thought this might be a useful video. Until you advertised Adthingy. Nope Nope Nope.
I have birthright citizenship opportunities from two countries, so I do have that option before renouncing if necessary (though I would rather not do that)
Simon missed something... He didn't mention that when you renounce your us citzenship your required to live outside the country for at least 6 months out of the year......everything I have posted can be verified by a quick Google search (how to renounce citizenship in the United States... Be warned it is a lot of reading and some small text... Note all the information I've posted is from a .gov website ...have a nice day... will not respond to uneducated or malicious replies
tbh it wouldnt matter kuz ur just human being isolated from society due to the overexaggerating of bein label as something to be part of
I heard the "friend" of Mark Zuckerburg renounced his citizenship to avoid paying taxes on his lawsuit winnings.
wish someone would steal my identity. no matter what they do it would probably still only be able to make my credit score go up.. can a credit score be negative integers?
It's pretty ridiculous that we're all held hostage by governments. A washing machine can change countries easier than a person can. AI robots will be free to live wherever they want.
Give me something useful, like how to renounce being taxed like a corporation and regaining our Constitutional Sovereignty as a Natural Born Citizen.
there was a serial killer a wile back that used this to kill people without giving in trouble he would have his victims sing then killed. sad
Yeah paying for the world we were born in, eghh.
"Freedom"
I'm a duel citizen already
Where did you get that map which is showed when talking about the Schengen area? As an inhabitant of a Schengen country I'm massively offended.
Not to sound like a Brit, but why would you want to be stateless?

What if dashlame gets hacked? Interested topic, boring advertisement
Where can I get my 'Citizen of the World' designation?
Earlier this year in Australia, a citizenship fiasco almost brought down the federal government, because while Australia allows dual citizenship, you cannot hold dual citizenship when you stand for election to a government position.
Why and when did they start with tinting movies, and why? I can't find mutch about it and it's rare talking about in documentary's .
That starting frame though
I'm confused... where exactly do you deport someone to who has no citizenship?
...."that have found themselves in the unfortunate state of being stateless." Nice one :D
Should be deported to New Jersey.
People from NI are gonna love that map.Hope you like the smell of petrol
Im not going to cry for people having chosen to remove all citizenship having a hard time.
Is it true that America federal taxation depends on proximity to a federal office building? I heard that if I obtained dual citizenship with the United States and Canada, and lived in Canada, I would have to pay taxes to both countries, but only if I lived within some set range of an American federal building such as an embassy. If not, was this ever true and where did the idea come from?
So somehow the US got it right with citizenship by birth, yet is the only major country that hypothetically allows people to renounce their citizenship to become stateless... Weird lol
I thought Gandhi was in the thumbnail.
Why are we here?? To be the property of governments and pay taxes.
Stop moving your hands ??
Lmao these crooks charge $2300 to LEAVE? What a joke.
Not accurate, If you're born out of wedlock in Saudi Arabia, you still get the Saudi passport. You also get a stipend and free housing if you don't have known parents.
Fascinating. It gives a person something to think about. Thank you for a great video.
To everyone in the comments bitching about taxes: lol the US already has some of the lowest taxes in the world when it comes to personal income (and now business after last year), even several states that wont tax you at the state level. Stop trying to be edgy, I know its "hip" these days to be edgy.
Now that the US is going after non-native-born citizens, what's the situation for a Brit (not myself, I would never hand myself over to those b*****ds) who became a US citizen, thereby having to give up their UK citizenship and then loses it?
please dont start ya videos with a sponsor blurb. its annoying and we just skip it
I'll admit, I was assuming the rise in renunciations was due to sovereign citizen nuttiness.
So if one expects to be successful on their own later in life, renounce citizenship before one is successful. Noted, thank you.
People of earth... How much of complexity must there be in diversity of the mind?
Huh. I wonder if a nation can both demand tax... and disallow renouncement like Morocco does.
A former colleague sometimes had an interesting time with his status, since his birth certificate was issued by the (short-lived) Government of Biafra.
Nice Schengen Graphic... except Austria is also part of Schengen whereas Great Britain is not.
I AM A SOVEREIGN CITIZEN
Hmm, pandering to the state for a receipt of sentient existence? Sounds like a battered wife thinking it's her, and one day the abuser will change [for the better]. William Paley, wrote something like, "No governor will ever do anything to abridge their own power, and no government will ever provide for it's own dissolution." (1780ish) The next level to this is in the realm of pure Psychology; as in, there in no state/god (Psychologically, euphemisms). You could say, there is a Psychology beyond Civil Disobedience; and that is purely in a sentient state of individual existence. The biggest con in "human" history is the idea of "we"; beyond this mass of confusion that is this "we", is the sacred, eternal, and true "me". All associations are Psychological injuries.
This is exactly what the Bible says regarding the Mark of The Beast. Without the Mark a person can't buy, sell, own property, or have rights. They are at the mercy of the state. Whoever refuses the mark will be killed. Blah blah blah Well, hopefully everyone realizes that they're not bound to the system. It's the other way around. The system is bound to the people. If enough people refuse the system then there is no system
I was born in Landshut, Germany and was stateless until I was adopted and got citizenship in the U.S.A.
Or move to one of those places that nobody has claim to. I think there's one on the Serbian border. Or alternatively disappear into the wilderness and live there away from civilisation. Also, wasn't there a UK law where you got 2 acres of land to live on?
Seems like an easy thing for the US to fix.
Governments are criminal organizations.
The ultimate survival test well one thing ur going to need one of those gadgets that produce clean drinking watet
Welcome to america. Where people just show up and expect us to take them with no recourse. It's pretty pathetic how much people could care less about our borders
You missed Belgium. Belgium requires you to state you want to stay a Belgian at 21. Lots of Belgians working overseas forget this or don't know this. They find out when they apply for a passport renewal and find that they are no longer citizens. Happens all the time.
Oh yes, 2010 when idiot white collar fiends left than rather pay for their crimes or fair share.
Hey Simon, I've come to trust your work over the past couple of years watching you and wanted to ask a question i was hoping you'd make a video for. I've been reading from other sources such as: http://marriage-equality.blogspot.com/ ; that birth defects from inbreeding and the watermark effect aren't as common as most people believe and I'm unsure of whether to trust them. I was hoping that you could examine the research yourself and give us/me a better understanding on the subject
I guess if you are renouncing your US citizenship, the second step should be to legally change your name in another country, so that FBI file on you be rendered worthless.
Send them to Antarctica.  That's a stateless continent.
Me? I am from... *puts shades on* nowhere.
I will give up my Norwegian citizenship, and get a danish one, because I prefer freedom. But in Europe you don’t need a passport because there are no passport control which is very bad.
4 million dam we need to get them the hell outta here !
I'd rather be stateless then be a subject to any nation's authority. Also as much of a sarcastic remark that is, there is a certain idea, that one is completely independent from another, and thus not subject to the control of another person or group. This is a idea on individuality, not individual sovereignty. Citizenship is one of those things that is only official and not really worth a damn thing in the real world. It groups you into a collective and restricts your rights. This makes it completely procedural, and in some ways oppressive. The fact is that one is an individual, not subject to anyone's control, even the governments. This paired with the fact that governments derive their power from the people allowing them to have power, means that as a matter of fact, when a country has a way to identify their own and document their own, means that in a certain sense, those individuals are being spied on and controlled by the state. it sounds more like 1984 then it does freedom. so thus i can't agree with it. but i also tend to want to knee cap governments overall but still.
I'm assuming Sovereign citizens are different from country less citizens?
Yeah I find it kind of interesting that you quote Rangel the guy who got busted for refusing to pay taxes having property Investments in the Caribbean and one hell of a large bank account down there hiding his ill-gotten booty. The Tax Act was really simple how dare people have money where Obama couldn't get his hooks into it. It was a Democrat double and triple taxing scam. You get to pay the taxes on it when you earn it and then you get a pay more taxes on it for keeping it offshore. It's not that difficult to grasp or understand. But since you tend to take the leftist view on everything we're quite sure you want to muddy the waters up
Bonus fact: The US is one of the few countries that bestows citizenship based on your being born on US soil. Your parents don't have to be US citizens, they don't even have to be here legally. There is now some debate questioning if that should be changed or even if it can be changed without a constitutional amendment. Soil-based citizenship was accidentally introduced into US law by the 14th amendment that granted US citizenship to former slaves. At the time they certainly weren't contemplating hordes of pregnant Mexican women deliberately but illegally crossing the border in order to give birth on American soil.
Hey, Michael V sauce here?
The moral of this story? Don't renounce your citizenship unless you have citizenship elsewhere and don't "Immigrate" Illegally.
4 million stateless people in the USA need to be removed as a blight on our country.
It's too bad I can't get my education without the advertising at the end of it.
My question, If a mother is arrested abroad " outside of her home country" and gives birth in Jail, which citizenship will the baby be given? The country of his mom or the one where his mom was jailed in?
In Kuwait this is a big problem, as there are a large number of stateless people who are a part of the population.
Dude I thought you were Vsauce.
On the other hand, what is the maximum number of countries one could be considered a citizen of simultaneously, at least in theory?
Just move to California. They love illegals.
i recently got a state ID after my passport expired. But it's crazy what they require now. I came with my Birth Certificate, Social Security Card, Voter Registration, USPS Change of Address Letter, my last bank statement with current address, and it still wasn't enough. I needed a second proof of my current address from the last 90 days. The check boxes for identity and citizenship each require one item, however, residency requires two and both must be recent. Seriously, they would not count my official change of address letter because it was from when I last moved which was years ago, lolz.
Gotta pay to not be a citizen... so we're almost all born into slavery. Anyway, are there any actual benefits to being stateless or are do you have no choice but to be pushed around by big bully countries?
Do you think we will ever get over ourselves and just have people being a resident of the planet? Ie no more countries and discrimination thereof. I mean people talk about this race and that race, there is only ONE race on this planet and that is the human one.
on the bright side, all hostile acts while stateless you can technically claim as an act of war, since you are technically our own government.
You can say you're a refugee and live in Sweden.
Take a shot when he says citizenships.
Friedrich Nietzsche was stateless. I’m guessing it was a bit easier to get away with in 19th century Europe.
some people have the opposite problem. my father emigrated from Israel to Australia at the age of 7, he was raised Australian and considered himself to be Australian, as Israel did not accept renunciation of citizenship (rules may have changed) when he visited some extended family in Israel he was in trouble for having skipped out on his national service. they did, however, accept a promise that he would come back and do it soon, in what seemed like a standard workaround for the situation, it did mean he functionally couldn't go back after that point because Israeli law considered him to be a citizen who had broken their national military service laws. so he was in the odd position of being unable to visit a country because he was born there. note these events occurred in the late 70s and my father died in 95, rules may have changed in that time.
Hey, Simon, you always say that so-and-so sponsored your video such as Tunnel Bear, Square Space and other services but yet you've never done a Today I Found Out about any of them, you only do TIFOs about other random stuff, what's up with that?
Is there such a thing as a UN citizen? I think the UN offers passports (for some functionaries, etc). Does that mean you can be a "Citizen of the World"?
What happens to the immigrant if you marry an immigrant they get the citizenship then later on u get divorced? Do they get deported
So if you win the $1.6+Billion USD lottery as a US citizen, you could renounce your citizenship before claiming the ticket ($2,359). Pay taxes 30% non-US withholding ($480,000,000) when claiming ticket as a stateless citizen, get the $, then apply for a EB5 visa ($1,000,000) to regain permanent citizenship. This way you could avoid the 37% short term capital gains tax ($592,000,000) and save yourself $111,997,641 USD.
Once i met a crazy guy in a parking lot of a parts store. He lived in an old broken down RV with a bunch of satellite dishes on it and aluminum foil on the sides. So yea crazy. He ended up telling me that our social security number is a way to send our tax money to the British government for our independence and thats how it been for years. Then you can renounce your citizenship and sue the government for this because its illegal and you would win then get several million from the government then you have 3 days to leave the country. He said he buy a sail boat and that is what he was working towards So yea many holes in his theory but crazy to say the least
'Murica~! They like to be different. -_-;
So a sovereign citizen then? :p
Incarcerated on a whim? How about you host them?
4 million? hahaha more like 30 million in the US
If we got rid of the 'born here = automatic citizen' it could encourage more immigrants to arrive young and integrate themselves into our society better since then they'd have to either go through the acquiring citizenship process or get an american spouse if they wanted their kids to be american citizens.
Any bets on how many drunk renouncements will be caused by seeing this video :D
none of this is in the good of humanity. society must change
Why are all his video's always from the perspective of an American? There's more people in the world you cuck
You forgot a big reason people become stateless, occupation. I have no citizenship because of the Israeli occupation.
But the other thumbnail was so intriguing...
Your Schengen map misses Austria! =) Hahaha - take that Habsburgers! Also UK and Ireland is not part of it Schengen... Espcpecially now given Brexit.... =(((((
Are you still a British citizen?
Curious if you are referencing this in regards to migrating and becoming a citizen elsewhere or merely separating yourself from the crown and the Vatican imposed laws on a falsely themed free land like the United States?
So if you choose to become stateless voluntarily by renouncing your citizenship in say the UK, but don't apply for citizenship in another country, it just won't happen at all?
My Father and Aunt were born in the New Hebrides, however their family moved on before it became Vanuatu. They were not aware that upon the formation of Vanuatu all past citizens had to apply for a UK or French citizenship... so missed out. Thus my Aunt and Father were stateless. both my grandparents were Australian, however it was not until much later in their life (after thy had been living in Australia for most of their lives, spent most of their childhood in Australia, had been voting, paying taxes, and generally been calling themselves Australian citizens) that they realised they were not officially citizens. Luckily it was not difficult. They just had to prove that my grandparents (their parents) were citizens, then it was sorted that they had technically been citizens all along... even though they had no physical evidence other than parentage to back it up.
Can someone count how many times he said citizenship?
Lol @ people who think they need a state.
Sorry, I can’t take all the ads.
If you renounce your citizenship from USA, the US will automatically assume you are a criminal.
Countries should pass a law where a person can't renounce citizenship if said person cannot provide proof that they are citizens of another country ensuring that person have somewhere to be deported to if that person renounces citizenship to the country they are in if citizen at all
Anyone from Latvia here?
So do you support trump? Cuz if that's the thing I well STOP following this Channel and I think it's hilarious that I just watched a commercial about Trump and building walls in America first on this channel
I am born and raised in Sweden and became stateless. After 2 years I became 18 and could apply for a swedish passport.
i just did this to become a citizen of Pochinki
Make a video on why most watch ads have time 10:10
https://youtu.be/XIrxOLc5Cbs
Just don’t become a stateless person....
My brother was born in a UN refugee hospital and the US consider him stateless
Well such renouncing were announced by celebrities around 2016 elections
U can say what U want. But if you do it,,, you better have A place to go?????? N be sure????? Where do you go off to????
Sounds a lot like you're criticizing the US on how they handle "stateless" people when many of those "stateless" people are illegal aliens.. Illegal aliens are often "stateless" because they come to the US without documentation, on purpose most of the time and assume a different identity.. They do this to complicate the deportation procedure in hopes of being able to stay in the US. There is absolutely nothing wrong with detaining "stateless" people because let's be honest, they probably shouldn't be in the USA to begin with and it's not the responsibility of the American tax payers to support every undocumented person that slips across the border.
What happened to your glasses? Did you not like them?
The moment you realize the hair on his head renounced their citizenship and emigrated to his face. :)
You can't access a bank account without using a commercial identity (your name in all capitals, essentially your business name) because real people can only access real money, not digital currency backed by nothing, same for access to corporate government employee social security funds, and of course pay income tax used to pay the ever increasing central bank (federal reserve) interest on currency loaned to the government by said private banks. Same goes for getting a driver's licence to enable you to work for the government or companies outsourced by the government as a driver under contract. (Driving in a legal sense is commercial, and under contract, by government, and as such needs to be regulated so our police, ambulance, bus, taxi and truck drivers are safely using our public roads for profit while delivering services to the public.
Natural born citizenship is recognized by soil of birth (jus soli), not blood (jus sangunis).
11:00 to skip second in-video ad.
So the US makes a weird and unnatural law to try and stop tax evasion but it doesn't actually address how people realisticly avoid taxes... I'd love to see a today I found out that talks about shell companies and proxy ownership techniques that people use to avoid taxes and other problems. For what it's worth, shell companies also provide harmless or helpful utility. Like they help people avoid kidnapping and criminal attention (though most Americans don't need that aspect of shell companies). They also make it easier for lots of investors from many different countries to pool their money together and avoid lots of paperwork. For example, a shell company might own a US investment so that the investors don't all need to do a complicated tax filing (only the shell company itself needs to do the paperwork). Though I don't really know how all this shell company business works
Just making an observation. I've seemed to notice that more often than not the ad I see on your videos is of Prager U. Not to get too political but as someone that explores history as you do I would suggest reviewing their ability to profit off of your credibility to push their political ideals. Prager U is well know for morphing historical fact to fit into their narrative, I just feel that they are not the thing to preceed a fact based video. I worry that they may have an effect on your credibility to new viewers, and others alike that may link the ad to your content in some way. Again just a thought.
Simon is an example of how YouTube should be. Keep up the amazing work on all your channels man.
Earth Passport!
That ad for dashlane is just stupid. Unless dashlane is the one conducting the breach they don't instantly know and thus can't tell you straight away. The best it can do is if the public announces it or they find it being sold on the relevant section of the dark web.
I was about to scroll past and then I was like “....wait. What does happen?”
Interesting video, as always. I'm liking the new background.
your dick falls off... even if you don't have one.
Here is something to think about: what happens when you renounce your citizenship, and die before you can get another nationality?
What happens if you're born in an airplane, or boat in/over international waters
You just die you disintegrate
You know I was honestly randomly thinking about this the other day
I thought a bunch of liberals were supposed to do this?
The further I got through this video, countries/nations started to look more and more like mafias or something. They're not of the people, they're just a super XL sized gang.
I really enjoy your videos, it's definitely one of my favorite YouTube channels ??? it's really important to mention detention of immigrants in the US is largely motivated by profit as detention centers are private, not state run. Asylum seekers can be detained for literally years - doing nothing but following the law of presenting themselves to a point of entry - all the while companies (that happened to lobby for state and federal laws encouraging a minimum national detention quota) have every incentive to keep them detained for as long as possible.
Another seamless shift to a promo. How do you do it so well?
Damn. This probes what we all knew: The USA are jus fucking dumb.
Has anyone ever tried to send a message in a bottle or is that just a trope invented by Hollywood
Can you please make a long audio compilation of these as a podcast or something. So i can listen to these while driving or working? Would be awesome :)
Simon, Paul from the US, Charlie Wrangle know all about the tax laws. He owes the IRS a lot of money in back taxes.
Where do you get your glasses? I ask because you are in a state of looking good ^_-
Will you do a video on world citizen? Its only like 200 usd and fairly easy.
I thought they just drop you in the middle of international water.
always great to see you Simon , but if you upload under different names , how do i find you ? why not simply your name...........
Yet another incredibly well-researched and eloquent presentation. Well done.
What if I was stateless in stasis while weightless in a spaceship?
Difficulty getting a bank account must vary between countries. I've been to several countries where opening a bank account as a US citizen has been easy. As long as you are not transferring or storing large sums of money, I guess, and have a job in that country; there should be no problems.
At 2:16, should be 4,000, not 4 million.
Really? Double taxation?
aaaaaand that's where {{DASHLANE}} comes in...
I've been wondering about this very thing recently! TY Simon and Co. Jenn ?? in Canada ??
My sister had a home birth and her child was stateless for years.
This was of the most interesting in a long time.
Hello i wanted to write to you for an ep idea. I want to find out today why does it hurt when your heart gets broken??? i really want to know this please, or i want to find out why your heart hurts when things happen like the loss of a loved one, please help me.
A Brit got taxed without representation? Karma is great.
Once a US citizen, always a US citizen. Renounce it all you want, but within the US you will continue to be protected as a citizen under the Constitution.
I can't wait until Dashlane gets hacked.
Are there cases where a country claims you as a citizen and does not allow you to renounce it, even though you are a citizen of another country.
There are 4 million stateless people in the US? How is that possible? I've been a citizen of THREE countries.
Ironic, or maybe just well - placed, that the commercial before this video was the 45th US president denouncing liberal Americans who would allow non-citizens into the US. And oh yes, BUILD THE WALL! The 45th US president is not one I'm terribly proud of. I was very sad when President Obama left.
Fun fact: If an American renounces citizenship, and wants it back, he must become naturalized just like any other immigrant. But when Lee Harvey Oswald came back from the USSR after renouncing his citizenship, he was quietly given his citizenship back with no process. Hmmm.
This is great I've been wondering about this one.
If you renounce you are a moron. Even if you disagree you are handing over your own rights, like a Moron. You give up ALL your power. Idiots will be idiots.
I used to work with some guys that were illegal(Mexican guys). I(white as a ghost) would always joke with them and say when imitation comes to pick them up, I would throw my ID in the trash and tell them I'm from Mexico and see if they send me back to Mexico with them.
...did you conflate stateless people with illegal immigrants, thats not the same
Sponsorshit.
There's no limit to how many different citizenships one can hold, is there? I would think that as long as each country you are a citizen of does not require renunciation of other citizenships you could keep adding them.
I want to become a Colombian citizen. Im Puerto Rican
Back home, renouncing citizenship is simple. Sell any and all non-land property you may own, and never have another established non-land property within the borders. Owning land or having a land inheritance as well as non-land property inheritance doesn't count unless you live within the property bounds. Of course, there are a lot of people who have traveling citizenship only (mainly traveling merchants and those who rarely stay in one place for longer than the equivalent of a month), and they're merely partial citizens. One needs not a passport or documentation to travel through my homeland or settle there, just enough silver to purchase a Registry Contract, which can be sold at any given time.
wow another thing fucked up thing about america
I can already hear the immigrant song played in my brain while watching this video
What citizenship does/do Native Americans have? Has it/can it (US citizenship) be forced on them? Also, if they renounced US citizenship would they be trapped on the reservation? Hell, for that matter can/do they issue their own passports? What is their representation at the U.N.? Aaaaarrggghhh!!, so many questions! ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Huh. Talked about citizenship on the way home work, now this. Is the point of being a citizen mostly so that you don't get arrested by own country?
That map of the Schengen area is so wrong. First Northern Ireland is part of the UK. Second, the UK and Ireland are not part of the Schengen area.
Thank you for answering this question that has been bugging me since I was a youth. Cheers!
Only 12 million stateless? There should be 7 billion
aaaaah,guys,unitoligy is trying make itself normalised by helping people?, why can't isic Clark come to this universe and what he did in dead space 3?
Illegal immigrants deportation =fair
so dash lane keeps all your info, its a joke
Any Michigan locals? About a minute in, the application has Washtenaw County spelled as Weshtenaw. Lol woops.
I do believe you don't know the legal definition of citizen
Obama really messed things up back in 2010.
So if you are drafted can you renounce your citizenship to not be drafted or can you still be drafted?
Can you do a video about the st nazaire raid by any chance
There's a handful of officially unclaimed areas of land around the world. They should name one and declare all stateless people citizens of that place.
Dashlane sounds shady, I would not trust a single company with all of my passwords and info. It's a disaster waiting to happen.
How can a stateless person travel abroad ? Who gives them a passport ?
Show those ICE agents' faces, you coward! You showed the guy they were grabbing, why not them?!
Being poor makes getting a bank account hard too..
Once the US assumes control over the world, this won’t be an issue. Everyone will either be a citizen or a subject of the United States.
Renouncing in the USA is $2350 and paying a tax on all your belongings, including you. You’re considered state property
The United States ALWAYS has to be the exception, even if there’s no good reason whatsoever to want to be the exception.
4:42 talking about the schengen area, but the first picture seems (very) wrong: rip austria? and UK/ireland is not part of the schengen area aswell. the 2nd picture seems right, but what should the first one represent?
Being born in international water on a foreign flagged ship causes issues with US citizenship also. And for tax and payroll purposes, A LOT of cruise lines fly under a foreign flag. Something to think about for all you soon to be parents before taking a cruise in the 3rd trimester.
Commercial before the commercial. Then a commercial in the middle. And then a commercial at the end. Almost leaves time for some interesting facts. I need to remind myself why am I watching commercials. I mean why am I watching this video
They usually just give you funny looks, pull your chain a little bit, and call the nice men in the white coats.
Regarding stateless persons competing in the Olympics not everyone who walks behind the Olympic flag during the Opening ceremonies is stateless. Occasionally the IOC will invite select athletes as guests of the Olympics whose nations are prohibited from formally participating due to persistent bad behavior either athletically (like Russia recently because of doping) or due to war or other highly objectionable policies (frequently applicable to Middle Eastern nations).
TIFO: Giving interesting answers to questions I would have never thought to ask.
we live in a stupid society, why does some paperwork mean more then someones worth
The UN declaration on stateless persons requires the host country to issue "identification suitable for travel", but good luck with that.
Involuntary statelessness is kind of what happened to Tom Hank's character in "The Terminal". His country's government was overthrown while he was on a plane to the U.S. so when he arrived the U.S. refused to recognize his passport. He was then stuck in the airport as due to a supposed quirk with immigration law the terminal was not quite U.S. soil but leaving the international terminal would make him an illegal immigrant.
What about situations where an individual is out of the country on vacation and his or her native country no longer exists i.e. conquered and absorbed by a larger more powerful country?
Ofc Murica is the most retarded one haha.....damn they have such a shitty non logical systems.
So. Captain America and Superman are essentially Stateless.
The more I learn how broken the American immigration system is, the more I want to scream ??????
Baldman, Teller of tales and tailor of tells. Why is your talking so different? Are you from another land?
FYI but the ad for this video was a Trump wall petition. BARF
Why do you show the Irish flag over Northern Ireland?
If you renounce your citizenship does that mean that you no longer have to pay income taxes?
Then there's this tale of "never hearing anything about the United States as long as you live": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l58h77Z-rA G'bye"Tax Evaders," we won't miss you...ever!
Are spoons and forks the same size across the world?
But what if you reject your humanity?
Another way to involuntarily renounce your Citizenship ( For a US citizen.) is to join a foreign military and become an official officer of that military.
To those who renounced their USA citizenship Thanks bye don't let the door hit you in the a++ on the way out
I'm not driving, i'm travelling
Let's just grant citizenship to a country with no territory, no laws, and no benefits or responsibilities that citizenship confers to stateless people.
'Hey i'm a baby' 'Here's a contract you've signed by breathing: You belong to us and if you don't want to then you need to pay us a fuck tonne of money. You must be on time for the bus, but the bus does not have to be on time for you'
There’s a difference between being stateless and being a Mexican citizen illegally immigrating to America. Don’t mix your arguments??
Did Charles Littledick write this one??
I haven't even finished the commercial but, BOOM new country? Don't let me down reality!
On January 19, 1943, the dutch Crown Princess Juliana gave birth to Princess Margriet in a hospital in Canada's capital city, Ottawa. In Canada, citizenship is given to anyone born on Canadian soil, however back then, the children of Dutch citizens couldn't get Dutch citizenship if they were born in foreign lands. Without Dutch citizenship, Princess Margriet would have lost her place in the line of succession to the throne. In order to remedy this situation, the Canadian federal government declared the maternity ward of that hospital to be temporarily "International Territory", thus negating the Canadian citizenship she would have gotten and using a loophole in the Dutch laws since she wasn't technically born in a foreign country.
I wouldn't pay a dime for renouncing my citizenship, I never agreed to it in the first place, didn't choose to be born. SO If I would want to renounce my US. citizenship I'd gladly do it in front of the respected authorities, but I won't pay shit. They could pay me for my birth then, That's their logic. Renounce citizenship, secure other citizenship, move there. Hey the US says I owe taxes because I never paid the renounce fee. Good luck trying to get those taxxxxxes
Just move to *Germany.* They accept *ANYONE.*
Wonder if you have to pay taxes if you renounce
Do they half to pay taxes??
When I became Canadian in 80's, I automatically lost my American citizenship. The US at the time didn't allow its citizens to become dual-nationals. At some point the law was changed but I assume I'm still un-American in citizenship as well as attitude.
Well at least Boris got stiffed out of some money...
How do US Nationals differ from US Citizens (i.e., people from American Samoa)?
Put 100 stateless people on a cargo plane and make them skydive to a small Russian island.
Just got an ad about Trump's Wall. They know....
So Boris Johnson would be eligible to be elected as US President.
They are called Illegals. And they can get a drivers license, vote, free college, free housing etc.
In Canada they have an old law on the books where a child is considered equivalent to chattel. If an immigrant man marries a female citizen and has children and does not become a citizen, if they divorce before the children become adult the children become property of the father and since he is not a citizen neither are they. Since they were born in Canada and not his native country there is a good chance they would not be eligible to be citizens of their father's country as well.
Thumbs down for the repeated advertising.
Humans are so stupid. You'll never find a cat respecting imaginary borders and pretending it's ok to decide where strangers can live. This is what happens when gyms form cartels and force everyone to have a gym membership. Statism is one of the worst religions.
More than two grand to give the U.S. government the finger!!! Something sounds wrong with this!!!
Because America rocks, and if you decide to leave you can stay gone.
Please do an video on if hypnosis is real
Catch 22.????
Wow....Murika!
in europe citizenship is often decided by bloodline. its a stupid old thing nobody thought of changing i guess. or noone talks about it. the american way is the revolutinary way of the early colonization.
I'm pretty sure you become a smelly bridge troll
Two ads and a promotion in one video?? Jeez you guys really are trying to squeeze every cent out of your wiki search and regurgitation
Do you have a video on dual citizenship?
Wow, I did not know any of this. Very informative video, love your channel.
Saudia Arabia does not have 'Citizens'. They are Subjects of the crown.
FATCA did NOT create a new tax burden for Americans. Americans have always been required to report worldwide income and the section 911 foreign earned income exclusion is still available. FATCA rather imposed nasty reporting burdens on foreign banks.
Austria ???? is not coloured on the map of Schengen Europe. Is that an error?
USC's four father's were immigrants. Who the fuck will take a time machine to go shoot the fuck out of those people
I hate this place so much. Immigration is fake.
Theres a fucking exit fee? Fuck these people.
I hate the USA.
Stateless is also fake.
Citizenship is fake idea.
South Africa is implementing the double tax as well, in 2019
5:02 why is Northern Ireland depicted as Ireland?
I'm surprised you didn't mention the World Passport - I know most counties don't recognise it, but I think it would have been great as a bonus fact!
We've got tons of people fleeing their corrupt Central/South American regimes to come here illegally as non-citizens, and here we have some people who have citizenship who pay money to give that up. God, some of my fellow countrymen are flipping stupid.
Ha, asked and answered. I was just commenting on another video about knowing someone who renounced their citizenship and was wondering to myself what the implications might be. Eerily coincidental timing!
Why is it so expensive to renounce your citizenship I would think that you can just burn your passport and not go back what are countries trying to make sure their citizens can't leave
Cue the sovereign citizens in 3, 2, 1...
Why would anybody do this?
So in short, the US is the easiest and most expensive country to renounce citizenship from, the country people would be most likely to want to renounce citizenship from if they live abroad, and the country that will treat you the worst after renouncing said citizenship.
in the United States when Social Security ends and Federal Retirements are cut, the renouncements are going to explode!
odd about the 1040a, and a docu I saw the other day about c. e. 1321 revolt, and the average Joe citizen, when residing in one state and working in another, the taxes are a mess, besides double taxation comments abroad... ??
how to get your brother in law kick out of the country, step 1 make a fake id in his name, step 2 renounce his citizenship and sign the paperwork your self using the fake ID, apply for citizenship far far away to a non eu country, keep using the fake ID, and wait for out government to kick him out of the country
Why are there so many “bonus facts”? Couldn’t they just be part of the actual script?? ... I’m perplexed ??
Just say you're from Atlantis.
you are spying on me aren't you
I had Dashlane once took an entire weekend to reinstall my O/S.
is it dashlane or john deere
The only thing necessary for a private, non dealer sale is cash.
As a hard core identity thief I will be out of business because of Dashlane. Sob. Why me! Come to think of it what is my citizenship status? Thieveland! Hmmm. Maybe I should renounce that and become a citizen of a better country!
But do they still have id's?
You become a SHITHEAD!!!
Time for a drinking game. Take a shot for every time he says citizenship.
the are no nativ russians in schengen,just colonist send by USSR !
Why can't "stateless people" be dropped off in the only area which is not a country, nor belongs to any other country: Antarctica.
I wonder if this is an effective way to get around taxes...
Fancy. After Southern Jutland was given back by the Germans following the first world war, my great grandfather didn't have his paperwork treated properly due to a feud with the guy who was supposed to deal with it. So now I'm a third generation immigrant despite my family being Danish for nearly a thousand years. Thanks stupid stateless shizzle.
John walker lynd, the American Taliban, was sent to jail for fighting for the taliban but didn't lose his citizenship. I thought one way to lose citizenship was to fight for a foreign nation?
US citizenship has been a major pain since 2010, if you are an expat like myself. Once my parents are gone I am going to renounce, since I need to protect my pension against double taxation. I also have no representation in Congress to complain to, which makes it impossible to try and get this issue changed. I'll keep my UK citizenship, however. Although depending on how Brexit shakes out, that may not be as valuable as it used to be.
If you make a will and go missing, would your things be given out even though you're not dead?
I think the United Nations should offer some kind of passport service. This at least would give a stateless person some kind of official identification document. A UN passport database could reveal any past criminal activity and other information to satisfy immigration authorities. Then any country should not have difficulty in admitting a stateless person and granting them the same visitation rights as any other person. You could then travel from country to country as long as you met all the other requirements.
U don't have to pay taxes
Please do a video on what it takes to be a citizen of other countries.
0:20 to skip the advertisement by Simon
The US is like a jealous ex-girlfriend lol
Deport all illegals
Thank to TIFO, I sound more educated to strangers than I really am
I know, If you renounce your citizenship , Then you can eventually become the President of United States , Just ask Obama
Why do they make it sound hard to find a country to take them? If they are stateless or their home country no longer wants them simply ask North Korea if they want them.
Now I'm looking for a reason to renounce my citizenship as an American. The many years of shity politicians taking rule sounds reasonable enough. #BanTheDNC #BanTheGOP
Tina Turner did it.
taxation is theft
Unfortunately one cannot renounce German citizenship ??
Why do all your slides look like pieces of paper with the same stain and crease on every one? Looks kinda hinky.
Cool now thanks to today i found out, I now know i can become a mononymous, stateless person.
Do a video about the man that has to live at airport
It wasn't $160,000. It was any amount in a bank account over $50,000.00 that triggered FATCA compliance. And double taxation is not just a matter of dealing with earned income, it was also dealing with passive income such as investments and disability savings accounts. I'd suggest going to http://isaacbrocksociety.ca/ for a more comprehensive breakdown of why expats chose renunciation as opposed to taking the word of a US Congressional blowhard.
I am still waiting for Miley Cyrus's promise to renounce her citizenship and move to Canada. Apparently mexico was not good enough for her. With great relief by the Canadian people she changed her mind and will not move to Canada to annoy Canadians with her freakishly long tongue.
Good timing, was contemplating renouncing my citizenship post brexit.
You’ll be paying foreign-body taxes and get fucked when you try to use your social security number. You can’t work now.
"They can be arrested without having commited any crime" False. Them being in the country is a crime.
Why on earth does anyone want to denounced their Citizenship if they dont have citizenship elsewhere? This baffles me, are these people stupid? Or insane?
Boris is a Yank?? HAHAHAHAHA That's awesome!
You should have talked about individuals with dual nationalities. Are they allowed to enlist in the military, especially if the countries they are citizens of are on opposing sides of the conflict? What about other rights citizens have; are they infringed if you have a dual nationality, especially in the previous case of two waring nations.
in the US you would just become an illegal alien, with all the benefits that come with it.
This is some disgusting statist propaganda!
interesting map of the eu members...the one with the flags...didn't realise until now that switzerland was part of the eu instead of austria^^
USA and Kingdom of Serbia signed in 19. Century deal about deportations. It is possible to crime individual that did crime in one country to be deported and answer for that crime in that country.
Your irish map is faulty! at 5.05
There are also some countries where you cant renounce citizenship. In Argentina for example it is against the constitution to renounce citizenship, so you can sign or declare what you want and still come in the next day and get a new passport.
Simon, We love you.
Why not just demand that you can prove foreign citizenship before you can renounce your citizenship? That should solve some problems.
Well British citizens are definitely lucky, if they don’t get citizenship after a certain period of time they are given their British citizenship back. I wish more countries would follow the lead of the British government.
But what about if you want to get the citizenship back later?
Sigh. I got a Scientology ad and a Wall Petition Trump/Pence ad on this video. I wonder wtf YouTube is using to target ads...
Wow, I literally had this topic (among others) today in a university lecture on international law. This timing is almost unsettling.
Um what is with the brick wall shot for 2 secs at the end
I really do like the absence of a shitty tacky youtube thumbnail.
Great lead ins to ur sponsors. Love it! And everything else!
I guess there is no such thing as a "Citizen of the World" unless you are Superman.
Good topic dry video
Basically, you're a cow.
The different and more complex one as well is a baby that is born on a flight, parents might have different passports, the plane might be registered in one country, the aeroplane companies country of origin might be different but you could be flying over a different country. The new born can have either of these countries as their country of birth... work that one out... even worse if the plane is leased as well as that adds another...
Yes, the Supreme Court technically ruled in 1948 in Zadvydas v. Davis that indefinite detention is unconstitutional. HOWEVER, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from earlier this year, the Supreme Court said that there is no constitutional right for a bond hearing in immigration cases for non-citizens (so undocumented, visa holders, or green card holders). Can you guess what you need to get out of detention? Yup, a bond hearing. Essentially, the Supreme Court made indefinite detention constitutional for non-citizens.
"Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest." -Denis Diderot Should amend that to add "as the last state crumbles and the last tax man chokes on his own dick".
The government drops you off into the middle of the nearest ocean. Nuff said.
4:40 is not showing the Schengen Area. Austria is missing. And the British Isles are no full member. There is a passport check when going from Germany to the UK. Been there, done that.
How can I claim sovereign citizenship?
Technically, US citizens were required to file taxes in the USA even before FATCA passed, but (as you mention) most people did not have to file in the event that they didn’t earn enough to make compliance worth pursuing. It was just that FATCA started enforcing this even more strictly, in order to keep rich and wealthy individuals from just failing to report income. The gains from increased enforcement of taxes from these individuals was expected to offset the costs spent on ensuring compliance from everyone… Of course, no thought was given to the small guys who sometimes did not even earn enough to even qualify for filing taxes in the first place, if only they were living in the USA. This happened to my sister, who even though if she lived in the USA earned so little that even filing her taxes was deemed unnecessary, let alone not needing to pay any, but now finds herself needing to file her back taxes to validate that she does not owe anything before she can shell out the 2.5k to renounce her citizenship.
It's Charlie Rangel (like rangle); less of a congressman & more of a corrupt snake. Many ethics & campaign violations (was one of the most corrupt members of Congress, now it's Maxine Waters).
I've been trying to find an Seer to this for years ??
Jews like him don’t care about citizenship
Lmao anyone else get an impeach trump ad?
what if someone was born on a boat in international waters?
This is freakin' awesome! Two ads by DonaldTrump.com before and during this video. The irony... :D
A colleague of mine was a US citizen. He lived and worked for decades in Germany. From him I first heard he had to file a tax declaration for the US as well and they had to use the bank account of his wife for everything. He renounced his US citizenship a few years back because according to him “it was a pain in the ass”. He now has German citizenship as he is married to a German women. He also told me about the “nice” papers he got informing him that he is now on a watchlist. Crazy US treating him kinda like a traitor.
I should try that.
there is a reason why paul mccartny and rod stewert live in america
lol, tell all the people in the ghettos from the 90's screamin "FUCK DA POLICE and FUCK AMERICA!" about renouncing citizenship.... bet none of them would lol.
Can you do renunciation of various Religions next?!?
Just say you're from Wakanda.
as the world gets smaller they will probly have a global citizen status where a large group of countries agree to allow certain people to be citizens across the board. You might be able to then travel around the world without ever setting foot in a country where youre not a citizen. But world war 3 will probly keep that from happening
So far we haven been able to find how to renounce the UK citizenship without being in the UK and also it very expensive.
I'm an American who moved overseas in 2010. That Act has made it nearly impossible to get a bank account where I live, and I can't obtain legal residency without one. As a result, I have to bounce between the US, non-Schnegkin countries and my primary home in Greece every 90 days to avoid huge fines for over-staying. I make waaay less than $100,00 a year.
its interesting that govments can stop free humans from traveling upon the planet earth as if to say, hey you human, what do you think youre doing, walking on planet earth? How dare you. We will stop you from being on the surface of the earth with deadly force. Strange, very strange
MURICA AMIRITE
Argentina doesn't allow you to renounce your citizenship while Norway doesn't allow you to have dual citizenship (for now). This leaves a somewhat awkward conflict if an Argentinian wants a Norwegian citizenship. As far as i know the Norwegian government kinda buckles in this case and just allow them to get a Norwegian citizenship, but not without a hassle.
I know someone that doesn't know her birthday or age! She was born in Turkey but her parents didn't announce her birth until years later, where the state forced her to be registered and given citizenship, but at that time they had forgotten when she was born. To make things worse for her, she does suffer of one dozen genetic diseases. None of the serious ones, but enough to keep her busy... Why? Her parents are related by blood and it appears to be not the first case of (legal, since cousin) incest on her family...
The first frame of the video is expression gold.
What is the answer? Don't renounce the only citizenship you have, you dolt!
What you have stated about Saudi is false, because there is a system for orphans and unclaimed children. They are given names but the last name wouldn’t be a family name only a generic second name. They are cared for and receive support until the age of 18. There are programs to help them after, but they are limited.
The map of Europe that has the respectful country's flag over them in the shape of the said country which when you spoke about Schengen Area, is not entirely correct. That is because Croatia is not a member of the Schengen Area, but is a member of the EU and is legally obligated to join. Neither are Bulgaria and Romania.
You live in an airport like Tom hanks
There's another way of being born stateless: e.g. in India you can order fertilised eggs to be implanted into an uhm breeder, which then carries out your child. If you're e.g. German where such a practice is illegal, the state will refuse your parentage, even if both the egg and sperm donor have the correct citizenship! India on the other hand doesn't want any additional mouths to feed and won't hand out Indian citizenship either!
its more like subjectship
What if you're born on a ship or plane above international sea?
This episode is for me. I was wondering about this issue a few weeks ago What's up Simon, have you heard me ??? Thanks Simon Regards, Ahmad,
I guess you make some of these videos a long time in advance (which isn't a bad thing) Jeremy Hunt has been Foreign Secretary for a few months now. The US has the weirdest rules on citizenship in the world, born there to foreign parents on holiday good news you could be president one day, born as a 10th+ generation American in another country, you can be a citizen, but you ain't never being president.
I'm proud to be Canadian and would never want to renounce my citizenship. I AM CANADIAN !
Should stateless people be giving a rebate on their taxes since they do not receive the same kind of protection from the state as citizens?
Why is your pot-plant wearing a tie? Are we doing formalwear for vegetation now?
If you are illegally in a country, you aren't being arrested for "no reason"... You're being arrested for the crime of illegally entering the country. FFS.
Classic Gerald, always messing it up
Are there benefits to renouncing your citizenship i dont understand why anybody would want to do this
SEASTEADING,
5:55 Pretty much only new world countries do that. European countries generally have citizenship by blood. Jus Sanguinis. Politicans only added laws on top of that without changing that, which over time muddled the law and made it almost into what other new world countries have.
Your shengen area map is incorrect; the UK is not in the shengen agreement.
How many citizenship can a person hold, I have 2 currently.
You have done well
@04:40 Thats not a map of schengen, UK and Irland is not part of it but Switzerland is.
Good information!
That guy at 13:42 looks like donald trump......
Renounce your citizenship, but don't belong to another country... So a flag burning Democrat?
Can we sell this idea to sovereign citizens?
Any Americans on here done this? I'm just curious why anyone would, seems like a pain in the ass with no benefit. I would do it to immigrate but otherwise, what's the upside?
My wife have three citizenships.
I once looked this exact question up for where I live (Germany), and the bottom line is that after no more than 6 months you get "bounced back", you will be considered a German citizen again and you can get yourself a new passport by presenting your birth certificate or equivalent means of identification (and paying the associated administrative fee).
23andMe should give free DNA tests to people who could otherwise become stateless if they could not provide proof of citizenship, or at least try to prove it with your ancestors.
Despite being born as a US citizen. I had to renounce my Japanese citizenship when I joined the USAF.
Are there any laws stopping you from creating a solar town, that belongs to no country, in the ocean collecting and recycling trash while cryptocurrency mining off of satellite internet?
Why would you ever do this? If you want to be from somewhere else get citizenship
Why would you want to be stateless, instead why not save 15% or more on trivago
What happens if a prisoner renounces citizenship?
Can you do a video on the potential problems or even perks of having dual citizenship? If already done please let me know. I was born in Germany to Americans who were visiting. It's more complicated than that but that's the basics .. was told I have dual citizenship by my mom but have never have had any problems yet lol
shiddizinship.......
You turn into Jason Bourne. :D
And what about the sov/cit. fools that are springing up in various areas that are pissing alot ot people off.
8:25 HOW did i know the exception was going to be America............? WOW - who would have guessed.
One more reason why I'd never want to be American.
Before starting the video, I already know. This is one of the worst mistakes anyone could ever make in some countries.
I hereby formally renounce my citizenship. Thanks for this opportunity.
How to play hard mode IRL Become stateless Give all your personal info to 4chan
And here I thought if you're stateless you had to live perpetually out in international waters or in an airport terminal, like in that Tom Hanks movie
If they can be deported they aren't immigrants.
I was kinda hoping Juan Mari Brás would be included in at least the 'bonus facts'.
end of sponsored content at 11:00
If that ever happens to me I would travel the world, evade the law, and become an urban legend.
These reasons for kids being born stateless is absolutely insane. Children should always be given a state via where they are born.
You got the wrong maps for Schengen Zone. Not all EU countries are in Schengen.
Good info for any current US citizens.
Heh, we fought a revolution over taxes, and now look at us.
I'll stick with lastpass, sorry.
This is about sovereign citizens. They renounce adherence to laws of any land while expecting everyone else treat the sovereign citizen equally under the law. Enjoying the fruit without participating. Declaring sovereign citizenship should be treated as renouncing citizenship since they no longer want to follow and be part of society.
Dude When david attenbrouah leaves BBC u should replace him.
If you're an American trying to open an account in a foreign country they'll tell you to go FATCA yourself.
At least we still have the right to willingly give up all of our rights. Why one would do this is beyond me, there's millions of people that risked their lives just to get in the US.
TL;DR - You're screwed. Mostly because of the Passport regime since the 1920s.
What happens is that you stop being a slave to the state, but you can't live there anymore, and you loose everyting you own.
You could get your background a bit nicer by adding some books to the empty shelf's, like an leather bound encyclopedia Britannica ??
Doesnt this disprove the notion of individual rights?
What if you are born at home and your parents never apply for an SSN for you and you're homeschooled? No birth certificate. Stateless?
That beard is on point! Smart, sexy, ambitious, awesome accent....mmm mmm mmm.
Am I being detained?
so if a person renounces his citizenship from country A, and then proceeds to commit a crime in country B, does this mean that country A no longer has liability towards said person's actions?
Love this Channel keep it up
Is this jhonny sins official channel?
I know this is something people don't wanna hear but this EXACTLY why we need to get rid of nation states. This is getting ridiculous.
If you are a german and only german, it is impossible to renounce your citizenship - apparently. it's not I've tried
It's less trouble to get a passport and talk smack about your homeland in another country.
But they don't have to commit a second crime, they're already committing a crime by trespassing on national land.
Non citizens can GTFO
Girl you so sexy you’re jamaican me crazy ????
I would have been first but I actually watched the video first
I love the camera changes. Looks more professional and like a news station. Love the stuff you do. Can you do why Japan is a place seen as a nerd/anime full country. Like why they use it when in their commercial. Or why English is seen as the most difficult language to learn.
In the US, you can never buy or own a firearm again if you complete this process.
Why is your beard turning into Goldilocks?
Another great informative video! Keep up the wonderful work that you all do!
Can I resign as president and move to a different country?
Video was added 3 minutes ago 15likes 1 dislike video is 15minutes long hmmm
You want the truth: you looks like hitman lol.
Thanks Mr. Wonderful Friend Mr. Simon Whistler
Quaker Oats Federalist Froot Loops Republican Raisin Bran
Oof
OwO first
Does it really matter what we really call things? Like people look too the nordic countries because of their welfare system for instance. That doesn't change whether you call it socialist or capitalist.
I would argue that China still remains a socialist country, albeit one that has taken a strategic retreat to capitalism to build up productive forces. Sort of a one step back, two steps forward sort of mentality. Deng actually based the liberalization of the economy on Lenin's New Economic Policy which allowed for a state capitalist economy in which key major industries were nationalized while some sectors remained private to spur economic growth. Socialism requires a period of industrialization preceding it, which capitalism provides. This period was regarded as necessary to encourage foreign trade and investment, especially in severely underdeveloped countries like China or Russia which never had a major period of capitalist industrialization. Even today, many key sectors of the Chinese economy are state-owned. Even Cuba has embraced allowing small-scale private businesses in sectors like taxi services and restaurants. So to say that Cuba is definitively socialist while China is not is inaccurate. Both remain socialist because socialism is not some sort of ideologically pure economic system, especially Marxist-Leninist socialism which Cuba and China adhere to. MLism studies and acknowledges the material conditions present in a country to develop appropriate policy. And both China and Cuba uphold the socialist structure while acknowledging the underdevelopment they suffer from which very well may be best solved by state-capitalist sectors in a larger socialist structure.
This is hands down the best video on this topic that I have seen so far!
thanks from a social democrat
You forgot to mention Fascism in there.
I’m sorry but I can’t let you put social democracy totally in the capitalism category. I object on the grounds that the social welfare programs are under the control of the government. You can put it half in and half out or just call it a mixed economy. With that said, the only thing that belongs in the capitalist category is Laissez-faire.
Very nice video and very clear. This stuff can get very confusing very quickly.
great video. did you ever get around to making one about anarchy?
I think some people here in the comments thought this was some Jordan B Peterson video because they acting like they should clean their fuckin room like c'mon dude, think about your mother . I mean, you're a wage cuck and yet still listen to people on seminars telling you \"WELL AKCHUALLY IS NOT BAD BEING A WAGE CUCK, IS PART OF NATURE YA KNOW?\".\nDo yourself a favor and stop sippin of that filtered water, don't worry, it would not turn you gay or in a frog.
Fuck Sommunism And Ashkenazi Jewish Agenda
Cuba can only be described as vaguely \"socialist\" if you believe that the state actually \"represents\"  the people they are lording over... which, of course, they don't. Which means that Cuba is about as socialist as Franco's backside.
anarchists do not want to establish communism directly after capitalism and no anarchist believes that to be a realistic idea! anarchists just want to go about socialism in a different way from marxists, in a way they consider \"non-hierarchical\" or \"horizontal\", etc.
well made, BUT ANARCHISM IS A RIGHT SIDED IDEOLOGY
This is a bunch of crap!!   Bernie is a hardcore socialist living in a mostly capitalistic country.  What he wants defines him not what he is actually doing now.
So, that's how you pronounce NSDAP.
The commenters here all seem to think the communist states were all failures. It's simply not true. The USSR especially went from a largely rural nation to being capable of sending people to space in 30 years. The reason communism in the east fell like it did had more to do with the authoritarian regimes softening up. People wanted their political rights, especially as the economic development in the 70's and 80's started seriously lagging behind the west. \n\n\nNow the big issue with socialism as we've come to know it as that the revolutionary vanguard parties of these countries never gave the workers control over the means of production. And such parties never will. Governments in any system don't like giving up control, it's in their nature to rule and protect their authority. And without any opposition parties, there's no way to uphold a constitution and keep the rulers accountable. It all comes down to the good will of the leaders.\n\n\nSocialism can work within a free market. The left seems stuck in the thinking that markets = capitalism. It's a tool, and a superior one over planned economies. We can and should build institutions, banks and laws that allow for - and ease the creation of worker owned enterprises. That's how we break free from wage slavery. Who would voluntarily work for a capitalist if they can have a real say in their work place, what they do, produce and where to invest. And most importantly; get a fair cut for their work.
That's the difference spoken and the one in common: Failure
As a Cuban-born person, you have absolutely no fucking clue what your talking about and you are misinforming many people. In Cuba they are not elected officials making choices they are appointed by the government and they don't hold elections. You talk bad about the government you get jailed and tortured and killed in some cases. Fucking do some real research not reading Wikipedia.
fuck communism
Comunisim the political ponzy scheam thats cost over 100 million lives. \n\nSocialisim the cult that has the answers for everything while having the solution for nothing.\n\nMarxisim the idea that ignoring basic human pychology and biology will result in a human utopia (fools dream).
Pretty good video, but Norway, specifically, is more socialist than capitalist, with the state owning over 60% of the wealth and over 80% of the non-home wealth (most Norwegians own their own home). There are 60 state-owned enterprises and a massive trillion-dollar public wealth fund. The Nordic region as a whole has around a third of wealth publicly owned.
This commentary section is a nightmare.
What nonsense... amateurism  is dangerous
Socialism is a Process of become a Communist State.. And Communist State is a state that already achieved Communism... Cuba or Venezuela are Socialist because they are still becoming a communist and USSR Russia and Mao's China are Communist because they had already achieved True Communism..
under the criteria you place on Socialism, Anarchism doesn't belong there because Property is THEFT.   State capitalism and capitalism where ownership is defined negates Anarchism under either term.   Sorry you screwed up there.
Ok so lets say we give the workers the ownership of the factories. How do they make decisions as a whole? They vote? All the workers vote on every decision? Or would you have say, an elected group of people to represent their will of the group? Sounds a lot like a board of directors to me. In fact, a group of civilian owners of a company in a capitalist system do just this, they are called shareholders.\nSo in order to be successful they would need a board of directors to steer the business in a profitable direction right? You don't want to have less than before you expend labor I imagine.  I mean even a business controlled by its workers needs to produce and profit otherwise what's the point?. \nSo you need leadership, you need profit.\nOk so what grows a company? Risk. The risk to spend marketing dollars or get into new markets or release new products make a business grow. Who has the risk? Everyone in the company? \nHow do you start a business? Does the government give you a fully functioning factory and say \"here ya go this is yours now don't fuck it up.\"? Do the workers pool together and buy land to build a factory? Do they get a loan from the government or a bank? How does a socialist bank work (LOL)? \n\n\nBasically the way I see it, even in a socialist system you still need a leader, profit, and risk in order to be successful. Socialists just want to be paid more essentially. Well you are an owner of one very important thing: your labor. How and what you are able to do with your labor is entirely up to you. You can graduate high school and get into an entry level job, you could start a business, you could go to college and get a degree to make more money somewhere, it's up to you. \n\n\nSo what is a good reason to diminish your ownership of yourself by entering into a system like this? How does it empower the individual by becoming a collective? I think you are enamored by this idea of going to flip burgers and being paid by a percentage of the profit rather than what the going rate of burger flippers is. You want to make the same amount for working in a warehouse as the guy who is driving the sales of the business. \nIt doesn't make sense it's a pipe dream from underachievers who wants to share that lack of success with others of the same ideals. Socialism is just capitalism hijacked by the workers in order to be rewarded for taking none of the initiative or risk involved with starting and sustaining a large or small scale industry. It's essentially a mutiny of the commercial and industrial world and NEVER WORKS. I REPEAT..... NEVER....WORKS
Governments are the biggest companies.
Pure sophistry.
You have Marx, all Italian Fascists were once Marxists, Italian fascism was a mere tweak to the collectivism (state based collectivism), Nazism was an offshoot of Italian fascism (Race and State based collectivism). Communism is based on the economic classes (class based collectivism). After communists failed or as they would say workers failed to \"rise up\" overthrow the capital classes, there was another tweak called cultural Marxism which combines Post-modernism which is no longer focused on economic classes but more generally on oppressed classes and oppressor classes. Now it is the marginalized classes are expected to overthrow the oppressors. These \"oppressors\" are identified as white males of European ancestry and their oppressive institutions. Cultural Marxist also known as neo-marxists are opposed fundamentally to the enlightenment and every thing that it brought us. I think that's the basically accurate grand narrative our foolish little youtuber tried to dance around. Marxism and all it's derivatives fail because it fails to take into account what a human being is and what makes society function.
So.... Socialism= lazy+self entitled+naivety
What collapsed in the former Soviet bloc was STATE RUN CAPITALISM. The working class in this regime remained wage slaves selling their labour power to the state in return for a salary. This is NOT Socialism/Communism. Its quite simple really you tubers just use a bit of common sense.
This clown is not a Marxist. Marx did not differentiate between Socialism/communism they are synonymous terms.
Communism is socialism that cuts money at a sooner point ( directly from business instead if from taxes
Need one like this for the right.
Don't forget,  Fascism is a modified version of Marxism, but with extreme nationalism to make sure that the system stays at 100% voluntary participation. Socialism doesn't work if voluntary participation is less than 100%.
I'd call states like the USSR \"state capitalism\" , since the means of production werent controlled by the workers but by the state alone, it being a totalitarian dictatorship (under stalin that is). So nothing really changed in regards of it being socialist. still no workers control, stilll hunger and oppression
You assume the definitions are already explained so you are basically explain how they can be used not what they are.
holy shit haha. bor du i Göteborg? Lol tanken av att kunna se dig någon gång ute på gatan XD
Socialism Can't work. It's been tried many times by many different people and the result is always the same. Tyranny. After all that, Communism and Socialism is really the same thing, just a matter of degree of tyranny and oppression. All socialist states become more and more communist as time goes on because of the ruling class, ironic because socialism wants to do away with the classes but really makes them more distinct. The Norwegen countries really aren't true socialists, their wealth comes from capitalism and the free market. They just have high taxes to support the redistribution of wealth. Finally, as Margaret Thatcher said socialism works untill you run out or other people's money. Socialism cannot work no matter who runs it. Look at Venezuela, prime example.
Thank you for this video! Please do more of these videos!!
They all need to be purged.
thanks for explaining the distinctions, though as I see it all the socialist regimes are in principle based on some kind  of a masked theft
For all you Americans on here arguing about socialism vs capitalism, there is a political first step that would help to alleviate your problems.  States rights.  There you go... Libertarian/Right leaning federal government with each one of the 50 states having democratically enacted policies.  If you think a state is too capitalist or too socialist, there's freedom to move between the states and it's less risky to experiment with economic policies that way.  You're welcome.
\"Socialist with Chinese characteristics\" was basically Mao declaring something along the lines of \"Fuck you, I'm a dictator and I can do the fuck I want.\"
Things are not paid for by government, they are paid for by people.  Robbing Peter to pay Paul so to speak. ..
Fucking thank you.
It makes me laugh out loud that we live in all these countries run by quite religious people. We’re quite religion driven all over the world. YET no government system in the world adheres to any religious precept outlined in those religions! No wonder we live in a world where people think religion is a farce when you see ‘Christian’ candidates spouting Capitalist ideologies that basically take from the poor and give to the rich. THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF CHRIST’S TEACHINGS. Yet these pious people go to church and fight against the right of people and do every unchristian thing under the sun to their fellow neighbour. What an absolute JOKE! ??
socialism=nazi \ncommunism=north korea
every so called comunist always use the \"no true scotsman\" argument, and think that they are the spiritual successor of marx, not considering that communism is a flawed idea with an inevitable flawed outcome
Nah communism is when you don't want people to die due to not being able to afford access to healthcare, checkmate socialist communist post modernists
So basically, cutting through the gymnastics and bs, essentially nothing works and we’re just living in a overpopulated, nobody gives a fuck, give me your money, dick measuring contest, dog-eat-dog world hanging by a thread with white lies and Bureaucracy, which may also be too confusing for most to grasp and that somehow inherently maintains a false sense of stability until, like everything, is picked at and ultimately falls apart. Moral of the story: humans were never meant to maintain order or live civilly, life is chaos and balance...and also we are fucked delaying the inevitable end of our ways. We are locust and have always been.
this video is false and ignorant. it's just an opinion not based on real facts!
\"paid for by the government\" wrong. Paid for by taxes from the public.
Great video
Why are you equating anarchy with communism?
Quite informative, thank you for the quick explanations. As always, the devil is in the details... You could stop talking about Cuba's \"free elections\" and how \"people do this and that through their democratically elected representatives\", you only made me laugh and destroyed the continuity and credibility of your otherwise interesting essay.
Nothing is good. Every economic/political sytem fails or wins in one way or another. The Roman Republic failed, the feudal society failed, the absolute monarchies failed, the soviets, german/italian fascists failed and now the US will fail.
Love your accent..its distracting xD
Anarchism isn't inherently communist.
I bet you get taxed like 50-60%
Boi did you just say that the nazis were socialist. They were facist. Facism was made by people who hated socialism/communism
The Soviet Union is the goal of Communism. Communism is the goal of socialism. Socialism is the goal of democratic socialism. Democratic socialism is the goal of Social Science.
Social Democracy means: Vote in us so we can do whatever we want with your money
They are simply commies and we the people need to erradicate them from America by any means necessary, including war.
The reason why the nazi party called them selfs the NSDAP was to gain more votes in the elections before then ways only called DAP, German workers party, good video tho ;)
Awesome video
A colony of Ants.....
That was a damn great explanation, thank you.
I have been called a communist. However more accurately I am a social democrat or democratic socialist. Maybe a socialist.
you defined anarchism wrong
What is the difference between \"State capitalism\" and \"Socialism\" ??? The first one still have direct government control over means of production. Like in China. Or Russia. Private business part changes nothing in a terms of power.
But China also has a planned economy.
Hahaha the only people on the planet who want communism have never experienced it first hand.
BERNIE : NO REFUNDS!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nahahahahahahaha get BTFO
Thank you sharing this video!! very informative!
So you're saying nazis call themselves socialist? But they are fascist??.
NSDAP was the only one that remodeled the financial system fundamentally.
A good video would be to explain the difference between social democracy and social liberalism.  By social liberalism I'm referring to what that means in European understanding not American.  In America social liberalism means legalizing pot and criminalizing guns (among other things) but in Europe it means welfare state capitalism.  So again what it the difference between social democracy and social liberalism?
You could argue they were social democrats? I like that but I don’t think you meant that
You just said the Nazis were communists. You don’t get to politic
Weird how it's called orthodox marxism but is against religion
Socialism, Communism and Marxism is the perfect system for the people by the Jewish Capitalism.
Nope Cuba is not socialist. The means of production are owned by the state/party and the actual workers own jack shit. The only socialism that exist is in the heads of believers of this utopia.
Good tutorial.  Quite instructive.
1:00 by the people, through tax
Actually not all left anarchis are communist
How could Nazi Germany be considered capitalist when they ended the privatization of banks in 1932, which quickly lead to central government controlled economics and planning?
What are your views on anarchocapitalism and libertarianism (right wing and left wing)? If you could make a video on that, it would be much appreciated!
What difference?  Even right-wing conservatives and centrist liberals/libertarians agree that left-wing marxist/marxian socialism is the intermediate phase between capitalism and marxist/marxian communism and marxist/marxian philosophy underpins the concepts embodied within the works there is some overlap between the different aspects mostly in relation to socio-economic/social-economic/class/caste and ethnicity/race/nationality democracy and dictatorship personal property and private property and revolution and reform/evolution many-and-most people/person's are so-called left-wing-leaning/orientated/persuaded centrist liberals/libertarians or adequately-and-accurately appropriately-and-accordingly left-leaning/orientated/persuaded liberals/libertarians such as and specifically centre-left marxoid social democratic liberals they sympathise and advocate/preach but don't practice since they're opportunists too they're a victim of their own mind-set which is a product of their environment which in-turn is a by-product of someone else's thinking since we live-and-breathe in secular liberal/libertarian representative democratic capitalist republic's democratic dialogue such as and specifically through-and-under public passive discussions over such as and specifically through-and-under public passionate debates
Uneducated cunt
Nazi economy wasn’t free, it was heavily regulated
Where's Titoism?
Anarchy is not under communism, they don’t want to go directly to communism; they want to go directly to anarchism. Rather, communists want to go to anarchism through communism, but anarchists want to go to anarchism directly.
what about stalinism?
Marxisme is the opposite of dictatership
Not exactly a Communist myself, but this video did educate me a little bit on the subject.
Thank you for this!
Moral of the story, or at least how I make sense of this stuff considering my previous points of confusion: a \"communist state\" is an inherent oxymoron, kind of like \"activist academia\" or a \"dove general.\" Based on your ideals, you can believe that it works/makes sense, or not, and that it's illogical bs... and historically, just about everytime a \"communist state\" has seemingly been on the verge of creating itself almost purely democratically, with a lack of the stereotypical state violence, and therefore having legitimate potential to become a true communist society, instead of just a permanent-transitory communist state, it's been crushed by imperialistic-capitalist forces... Nonetheless, even a communist state that has been established through violent and/or revolutionary means can still be run democratically after the fact, just like how an elected communist/socialist state and ruling party (on paper) can hypocritically exercise free market capitalism like crazy. And the latter would be called social democracy while the former democratic socialism... Basically, the political label doesn't necessarily determine the practice, only the ideals, but the \"democracy\" part is key.
I'm against Socialism, but this is a very good and educational video. Thank you very much. :)
WWII Germany was in no way socialist other than in name. Germany opposed communism and while they regulated capitalism they used fascist policies that the USSR employed
klart som fan rödingen bor i göteborg
4:03 You lost me there. Cuba is not democratic at all. That's a huge stretch you took there. Ask any of the millions of Cuban exiles what they have to say about that.
So tired of people getting \"Democratic Socialist\" and \"Social Democrat\" backwards. \nI'm looking at you, Sanders
I didn't hear an accent until you said your were from Scadinavia now I can't unhear it??
2:45 We all know Cuba has much higher wages than capitalist countries LOL
In my opinion, I don't believe we're at the societal or technological point in time for communism to be established, but I also don't think Marxism is the way to go for it. I think if we adopted a libertarian socialist system, our lack of hierarchy would allow us to decide when we're ready to become communist.
I saw this video back when I was a liberal, why didn’t I click it!
COUGH genocide COUGH 100,000,000 dead COUGH
I am so glad that RKU would have been illegal under Polish law. And not just ordinary law, our constitution makes popularising any totalitarian system illegal and communism is considered one, explicitly. Some communists would probably say \"communism is not totalitarian\", but that's only true on paper. In real world it always ends very messy, so it doesn't matter that those who started the fire didn't mean to burn everything to the ground.
Heeey, germany has a social democracy as well. :(
At the end of the day governments are there to put forth and enforce rules that are reasonable and that people agree with so that society can function. You pay your taxes because you as well as everyone else need infrastructure where you live in your country(which is why expecting people who earn much more than other's to pay higher taxe is rubbish considering they only have to make a relatively small contribution to government to use the same infrastructure as everyone else). Oversimplified. The main reason why socialism ,communism and dictatorships don't work is not because the system if flawed, it's because people are flawed  (they are inherently corrupt and can not be trusted) in other words 'perfect system-corrupt and bad humanity'. That is why everyone in society must have equal rights and must be treated as individuals. All that being said you can not trust any government with too much power. If Jesus fell from the sky i would be happy to live under gods dictatorship, because it's not corrupt and can not be corrupted(I'm an atheist, so that was just a sarcastic example)
\"We live in a society, so we need socialism\"
Anarchism is on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. Anarcho communism is an oxymoron. Wake up please and stop listening to all the Soros puppets out there
Fascism and social democracy should be grouped together.
Cuba democratic? Is that why they had the same dictator for 50 years and killed off 80000 political opponents?
THE NSDAP WAS GLORIOUS!
So, Marx wrote a book. He wrote a fucking book, and because of that 200 million people died. Literally anything you do can bring mass atrocities without your control. I'm scared to write anything now
This is helpful. I like the flowchart table thingy at the end.
Fuck communism
Capitalis pig
What does \"owned by the state\" mean? there are lots of things owned by the state. Trump just gave farm subsidies to the farms, meaning that the government is controling the farms. Tariffs also control the farms because they are not freely able to make whatever they want because if tariffs are too high in another country because of tariffs from the country the farmer is trying to make something, ifsofactso, the governent is directly influencing production. Subsidies also socialize the production. technically the biggest regulation a government can do of owning the economy is owning the means of production, distribution, and trade of currency. Without currency or some other form of trade, you cant easily produce, distribute, or trade. But if the government owns that, they own the means of production, distribution, and trade over all. this is basics. and you miss it.\n\nalso you missed the anarcho capitalists, the people for TRUE free market, not this, which thing only thing I can definitively agree with you on is social democracy.\n\nCapitalism, by definition, is yet to have existed in the modern era. there may be a point in irish history that under the Brehon laws, capitalism could have very well existed
How the hell is Anarchism a leftist ideology?
Umm. Frankly I'm into cash-ism.
Cuba is not communist or socialist. Its state capitalist.\n\nThe means of production are owned by the state. Not the workers.\n\nUnder socialism there is no government. The workers democratically run businesses. The state is not involved
You forgot to detail differences in body counts, overall death estimates, missing and presumed dead, and different levels of anguish and horror for the column on the left.
We don't really care what it is called, but we do nevertheless want a socially responsible government which ensures that all citizens make living wages, and have access to all of the necessities of modern life, including shelter, nutrition, transportation, healthcare, education, childcare and retiement incomes, all of which we believe are best provided by a socially responsible form of government. Whether we call that socialism, democratic socialism, social democracy or welfare capitalism is almost immaterial, with one exception... \n\nif We, the People choose NOT to direct most of the wealth of society away from the rich and their corporations, into the hands of the working classes, we risk them leveraging their excessive wealth and using it to reestablish their dominance over society, the economy and government... which is a good reason for wealth as well as income to be redistributed, and the power of corporations and the rich sharply reduced. \n\nRecall that this American government was founded to be \"of, by and for\" the American People, NOT the rich and powerful and their money-making machines, the corporations. Government should serve its citizens, ALL ITS CITIZENS, as well as humanly possible, not just the rich in particular.\n\nIt is ONLY the socialists and their related spin-offs which promise to do that (he Republicrats don't)! Why would any working class American (which includes the middle class) ever vote for anyone else???
The first time an explanation made sense to me! Congrats on the video!
Good explanation. I wish many Americans would watch this video before accusing people of being this and that.
My parents were in the Socialist student party at Uni. They told me they quit because everybody spent so much time arguing among themselves they never got anything done. \nThe Lennonists hated the Trotskyists and the Trotskyists refused to work with the Lennonists and it was a cluster fuck of petty little disagreements.
I love how Americans think countries like Australia, the UK and the whole of Scandinavia must be socialis. Because compared to them basic welfare and medical care seems like Stalin's dream.
Socialism is a great way too lower your countries BMI. Other than that, I struggle to see any good things about it..
Communist bring down everything they touch.    They can be good or bad
In practice, as opposed to theory, there are no socialist or capitalist countries, each is on a continuum between more socialist/less capitalist and less socialist/more capitalist. My question for any socialist is this, how does the farmer decide what to plant, or does he?
95% of the planet is capitalist and starving to death, people are literally eating dirt in free market honduras\n\n“But socialism causes people to starve”\n\nyou say that’s not REAL socialism\n\n“But that’s not REAL captialism that’s “crony capitalism”\n\nCapitalists don’t actually read watch or listen to socialists yet they claim to understand what socialism is.
I am a republitard and I am smart you see. Birds got dem wings and bugs got dem wings too, so they are the same.\n\nHello I am a dumbacrat and you see those green scaley things well they got 4 legs like horses so they are horses.\n\nBoth of them at the same time: I am smart trust me! Don't trust the other side! They just want you to fail!
It's easier to recover from a nuke...(Japan) 2 nukes actually than it is to recover a state run by the left for many years... Chicago? And in about 3p to 50 years or less countries like Sweden, Germany, Spain, France
Anyone notice the banging??
Sounds good, doesn't work.\n\nIn all seriousness though, while this did not cover the Capitalist side as much as I might have liked, it did a wonderful job of explaining everything it set out to explain. It was mostly academic in nature, and only really provided links to more persuasion-based pieces later on. For that and the overall quality of the video I say great job!\nCheers!
In Marx's theory, \"Socialism\" is an intermediary (middle) state between the \"inevitable\" fall of a Capitalist society and the \"inevitable\" rise of a Communist state; Socialism only exists to give rise to Communism according to Karl Marx, who invented both terms. Fascism was created and coined by an Italian Socialist, Benito Mussolini, and is Radical Left-Wing.                                                                   The common denominators for Left-Wing are \"Equality\", i.e, the Collective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \"Right Wing\" Ideologies tend to stress individuality and individual rights such as property rights and freedom of speech.                                                                                                    Left Wing Ideologies: Anarchy a means to Socialism, Communism, Fascism has always been the Left thinking Karl Marx, Benito Mussolini, Friedrich Engels have all support for Anarchy..     Marxism (Socialism/Communism) as coined by Karl Marx is Left-Wing.
The Socialist side looks like it's having an orgy...
Bernie's so immoral.
Obama's not a socialist, he's just a moron.
\"An\" = without, \"arch\" = ruler, \"anarchist\" = someone who wants no rulers. To me, mob rule would not count as anarchism. If members of the community think I have too much stuff (because of deviant habits of saving, investing, and working hard), and they spread my wealth among themselves, that doesn't sound like anarchism to me. The Antifa thugs are not anarchists by definition.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.
Because it’s worked fine everywhere it’s been implemented. Ha
Commies REEEEE
You could just say, they all don't work :)
really should of turned off comments
2:45 Yet, the minimum wage in capitalist countries are way higher than that of venezuela. And the WoW economy is more precious than that of the country too.\n\nStill, great video nonetheless.
Quite correct, maybe except the overstatement of continuation between Classical and Orthodox Marxism. And not all Anarchists were Communists, becausr of moneyless part.
Democratic Socialism is the torch to light our way in the dark times ahead
Startrek is neither stateless nor classless.
Doesn't the Bernie Sander contingent of Democratic Socialism insist that we should start from Social Democracy?
Cuba's democratic... okay.
Socialism is too much complicated....
Anarchism is the perfect way to live if we weren't human
Ive never seen star trek but that little short might watch it. I wish humans were like that. This is like how animals live in eusociality, the driving force is for the betterment of their hive society
What about eusociality?
Your definition of socialism is a little too broad and fits more as a definition of communism
https://youtu.be/jFxWXbdqGIg
You lefties are a mess ????
I hate liberals
4:00 i see what you did there
This was a really goos video,thanks. But I have question,does Titoism fall under Orthodox Marxism?If anyone cab answer that would be great :)
When my mom walked in, I immediately switched to porn, because it was easier to explain..
Instructions not clear, killed 100 million people
You're being too optimistic and positive when describing Cuba. The \"community\" owns the means of production... You're right, the 0.001% at the top control the economy, while they dictate the laws they only care about, to ensure nobody below them can ever have any type of control, while paying \"as less as possible\" (not as high as possible as you state), and making their lifes miserably, while they enjoy all benefits. If you complain they treat you as a traitor and put you in jail. Get your facts right. From a Cuban.
Socialism has ALWAYS led to famine, death, and dictatorships. It's a way to ensnare the working poor into something akin to a religious ideology. The poor are manipulated into doing their leaders' bidding. Things change, so the people think things are \"better\" but then they get worse. See: the USSR, communist China, Venezuela, North Korea, laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. All of which have gone through so much hardship because of communism. And communist's only defense for this is \"in MY version of communism...\" or \"b... but look at the people that died from capitalism!\"
Today I learned that Slovakia is actually a drunk version of social democrat since we have free schools but you have to pay for the food in them, we have free health exams but you have to pay for any medication given to you (except for in dangerous situatios where you couldn't survive otherway.
Thank you for the video it helped explain a lot
Thanks!
3:53 I see what u did there???
Dont forget Neo-Bolshevism and National Bolsheviks. Stalin, the most known \"\"\"communist\"\"\" was actually a Communist Fascist, a real National Socialist, in a way.
Why do the Scandinavians always do things better than us? And by things I mean explaining socialism in simple terms.
are you not allowed to show a swastika on youtube now?
Do you live in Göteborg?
Nazis where socialist initially but focused more on the nationalist side of it later on
finally a video that doesn't try to lie to your face, like
Trotskysm in othodox marxism? But the Stalinists And similars thinks that trotskysm is revisionist.
Capitalism is better than socialism/communism/marxism
i wanted to consider myself a socialist or after watching this i think revisionist (not communist) democratic socialist is more inline with my ideals. unfortunately i run into the same issue as i did trying to call myself socialist. people are stupid and i don't trust them. i like the fundamentals in my ideal society but i don't trust the people in our society. unless there are big changes in how the western world works i'm holding off giving myself a label.
Seize the means of production
Great video, would have liked more on capitalism though
Cuba isn't it really democratic tho
Socialism, Communism, Nazism are all the same.   Big Governments taking away peoples rights.
Wait until those role model countries are populated with 50 percent black and 40 percent islam and you will realize that political system is not as important as you think.
And neither of them works.
Tell me more about Social Democracy...
You could have democratic anarchism by definition
whats the difference between capitalism and communism ONE WORKS the other one starves
I loved the video! But, first thing first. The Scandinavian countries listed in this video are not Socialist your right, but they have far bigger public sectors than you said. Especially Norway with their state-owned oil company, in Norway 30 in 100 people(30%) are employed by the government.
Do a video on monarcho-corporatism
dang son you blazed through the nationsjsmmdmfmsche deutche abentnfjjdwkmsei. i wish i could pronounce it like that hoooo
Bernie Sanders calls himself a “Democratic Socialist” when, if you go by his policies, he’s actually a “Social Democrat.” He’s not doing himself any favors...
Why does Denmark have DONG energy?
This is all only true in theory
This video is pretty faulty and your bias is obvious. Socialism is basically anything that is anything to the right of small goverment libertarianism. That is you raise taxes (steal from the population) and then the governement spends that money however it sees fit. In a free market(germany most definitely did not have a free market and saying \"mostly free market\" is like saying that someone stealing is mostly beeing a law obiding citizen) people dont get their money stolen from them by force by a violence monopoly.
I am an anarchist, but the number of ignorant and salty right-wing degenerates in the comments makes me think gulags are actually a great idea.
Basically socialism is statism. The state imposes itself on the masses to controls everything. I want the state to butt out of my life.
I’m a libertarian in general support of capitalism, what needs to be understood is Marx grew up in the era of the gilded age when the worker died working, there’s ways you can modify the free market to get fairness for the working and ruling class. As Adam Smith believed
I think this is the best video I've seen on this subject.
Seriously guys we need to throw both capitalism and socialism out the window. We need something new that does work. And don't say that capitalism work. It is not sustainable with a limited planet & ressources. Also greed prevents it from working well and greed cannot disappear completely. We need to find something entirely new which would make the bridge between right wing and left wing.
maybe this isn't necessary. idc what \"level\" of socialism you believe in. just say you believe in marxism, you don't have to explain what level of socialism that is. and i will say i disagree with you.  its that simple
Wtf was dis. Quit as 3min
so basically these ideas and lines between them can be so vague that communists, socialists, or Marxists can all be the same. seeing how antifa is made up of democratic socialists, anarchists, socialists, and communists they are the same. a bunch of rioters who want to over throw america. fuck em all! capitalism is the best! the west is the best! God bless america, and maga!
\"The goal of Socialism is Communism\" (V. Lenin)
WHAT
Where does Syndicalism enter in this spectrum?
Social democracy is not capitalistic, capitalism requires a free market, which can not exist under a government led by the masses, because humans are automatically selfish and will try to aquire wealth through limitations of free markets through taxes and such. I'd even argue that every country is more socialist than capitalist, and that the graph you drew should be devided in 3 equal bits, communism, socialism and capitalism. Also, you go off of definitions that are outdated and not accurate to what people actually mean when using the word. \nLanguage is descriptive, nor perscriptive.
Anarchism doesn't fully fit under socialism, especially since free market anarchism and voluntarysm exist
Commies.....
B
I'll take the one that ends capitol interest plz.
Talk about soviet marxism like the differences between stalinism and trotskysm
Here America is that Socialist are just Communist with out the guns!
What about the variety of Market based socialist movements?  Benjamin Tucker, JP Proudhon, etc.   all propose that workers own the means of production and that money be generated and owned by the community.  It’s not quite communism, but is anarchist, and is typically considered socialist.
The anarchism stuff is debatable
Star Trek is a post scarcity economy which is no possible in the world today. Cuba is also not a Democratic government. All elections in Cuba are just political theater.
There is no difference between the various types. When you are in battle what does it matter which guns are used if everyone has set themselves on fire? It will not matter what you do after the act, the end is same; hell. My friend, I ask you: why espouse thoughts which have caused the death of over 100 million and spawned forth hell on Earth for nearly 80 years in the Soviet Union and still burns in Venezuela and North Korea to this day. I think the evidence is clear in the bodies that people with minds like this and fruits of this kind are not in pitty of the poor but, hate the rich. \n\nLet me, let you in on a little secret life is not a zero sum game. The rich are not evil. When you buy a car is the person you buy it from stealing? He has more money, yes? No, of course not you voluntarily give money to that individual upon the realization that the money has less utility than the car. While the seller had no use for the car and thus realized that the money was of greater utility to him. In the end you are both better off and thus the capitalist owning the dealership is not evil. Moreover, is it not the case that the way one becomes wealthy is by serving the most amount people in greatest manner possible. Hence, the billionaire is only worth billions because he has improved the lives of the people he has served by billions. The rich man is rich because he is a do-er of good. I am sorry to say but, mother Teresa did less over all quality of live improvement than Bill Gates.
damn commie
Social Democrats are a part democratic Socialists and not capitalist
when i tell people i'm a democratic socialist people assume bernie sanders who's actually a social democrat and BITCH I'M TIRED
You mentioned National Socialism early on but didn't show where it was on your diagram. It would be interesting as to where you might place it. If ive understood your diagram correctly,I would say somewhere above social democracy, as its pro capitalist but undemocratic yet socialy providing.
Anarchism is correckt.
>Anarchism is part of Communism\nFalse, pirates were anarchists and wanted wealth, communism doesn't want wealth
I don't care what you guys say, but \"sharing is caring\" is a communist propaganda
i've been confused on this stuff for a while, the only thing i knew for sure was i'm anti-capitalist lmao.\nthanks for the great video :)

Capitalism or get nukes
Thank you, this was very informative.
in alot of communist theory, socialism was a step twoards the ideal society of communism and a trully communist goverment, its why the union of soviets SOCIALIST republics was under a COMMUNIST party
What about syndicalism?
Norway has more public ownership than private ownership when you control for the fact that almost everybody owns their homes (which counts as private ownership)
those 5 things have one thing in common, the common belief that because I'm more successful than you; I owe you money
7:30 i dont think work is a good word to describe what marx did
Thaís video was intresting, but have some mastake, like for exempel o NAZI that they have Socialist on they name, but thay don't make them Socialist. Socialist beleve um iqualaty in the contrely NAZIS the thing une person is better thanks athor ONLY bay is raçe, origens ...\nSó NAZIS is no't Socialist, thay are a far-rigth moviment, thay are racist, xenofóbic, ...\nAnd anather topic Anarquist and Socialist want a better sociaty but wath to achive with diferentes golds, for exempel Anarquist, don't wath a sate, wath free market, Liberty, thays are no't agenst capitalismand só on . Thys party and the Socialist (wath Liberty\n...) they faithe again it schader since ther criation .
The differences between socialism (e.g. EU) and capitalism (e.g. USA) are:\n- good public healthcare system;\n- good public schools;\n- good public transportations;\n- lower Gini index;\n- party subsidies to avoid lobbies.\n\nThe difference between communism and capitalism is: \n- if you're poor you die of starvation (Communism);\n- if you're poor it's always your fault and you deserve to die (Capitalism).
I used to believe in Socialism/Communist and distanced myself from them over time. Any sympathies I had for Socialism was destroyed upon spening time as a card carrying member of a Socialist party in Ireland. I saw that any system of Socialism needs Capitalism to function but only the State utilise it thus making a monopoly; also seeing that the Left doesn't really care for the poor it just hates the rich was a major catalyst too
Mutualism! Anyone?
Hahha du pratar jävligt bra engelska
Sounds great until it's time for the gov to return the money/food to the citizens.. Venezuela is literally starving so gov officials could each have helicopters, mansions, coke parties on yachts.. Humanities most recent attempt at socialism. Trusting politicians with the wealth of a nation has never been a smart move. The US spends far more on social programs than any other nation, yet look how rich all the politicians get, not via salary, but bribes and skimming what they can off the top. Yet they've convinced people that they need even more! Stupid people will make it happen since their emotions have been manipulated. Every one else must suffer the slow majority.
Socialism works in small control groups such as you your family sharing. However, in a large control group like a nation of millions of people, the people don't care about each other enough to where they can share everything and be equal with strangers who they have no bond with.
Communism, socialism, call 'em what you like, there's very little difference in the two. Now I ain't I right?
Though I am not a socialist, I do think your video is really helpful in understanding those who are and where they fall on this chart. Thanks!!!!
Socialism is just boneless Communism! \nbtw isnt Anarchism the total opposite of Communism?!
Thank god there is not a test!
I’d like social democracy
This is a disrespectful joke of a video
So many isms that it was fucking me up. I need a brief meaning of them not some high level vocabulary definition
I'll get my political info from people who don't lie about Cuba and claim it's a democracy thanks!
spencerism
Socialism is waiting in line for bread. Capitalism is waiting in line for the new iPhone.
History repeats
Anarchy is far from socialism communism or even capitalism
please stop adding \"istic\"
And all this system lead to disaster.
Where is trump derangement syndrome? that's a part of Socialism, Communism and Marxism.
First idiot Bernie Sanders never lost to Hillary idiot, know your facts Bernie Sanders elections was stolen by Hillary the crook Learn the Facts. Who the hell care about the facts of Socialism, talk about capitalism is a corrupt system idiot.  Capitalism is a system corrupt system that steal money from the average citizens and give the money to the Rich and Rich Corporations.  That is true capitalism, sir!
Greetings comrade!!! From your leader!
Socialism is still Evil and Every Nation should be Capitalist.
I distrust socialism because, even though it should be a transition to the elimination of the State, in the end we'll have a very powerful group controlling the whole means of production and the society. This happened in the USSR, this happened in Cuba (even if you wish to say otherwise, I already made my opinion on them. My experience with the cuban goverment supporting venezuelan dictatorship already marked them as my enemy) or China. I support federal republics because of this. If anyone wishes to debate please, do so with respect.
Venezuela was a social democracy in the XX century. Then the PSUV and Chávez came and fucked everything up trying to go full \"socialist\" with the Socialism of the XXI Century ideology but all they did was to put military officers in the control of the biggest state owned companies (PDVSA and the CVG's) and everyone went mad with power in just a few years. This is coming from a Venezuelan whose mother worked as an enginier who graduated in one of the best public universities in South America (or what used to be) and lived all these changes that brought us to the disaster. After doing a lot of studying I came to the conclusion that for Venezuela the social-democratic system worked but had to many flaws, we needed a nice taste of the right winged politics that brought us a lot of succes in the first half of the XX century to balance it. Dr. Arturo Uslar Prieti, one of our biggest intelectuals saw all the problems with this \"State Capitalism\" and knew this would have to be changed; which, btw, it's a system he created with the years while working with many goverments. The same with Carlos Rangel, one of the biggest classical liberals of our history, but he was a lot more radical (and, right now if we want to save our economy we will need his perspective of venezuelan society)
Technology is surely the future! I want a future where A.I type robotics carry our manual workload which will give humans more time to explore earth and live life rather than working to live!!
anarchism couldn't be further from the left. It's ULTRA right wing. No laws, No government, No anything. ANARCHY.
In 1934, Cuba and the U.S. signed a treaty that gave the U.S. a perpetual lease to the area.
Paid for by the government??? You mean the government goes out to work and makes money to pay for all these things you describe as \"free\"?
\"Democracy in Cuba\"\n\n WHAT???
No wonder the left is all confused and violent.....
This is helpful.  I’m not sure all democratic socialists would agree that they are strictly anti-capitalist.  For example, Anna Kasparian, who identifies as a democratic socialist, always says she doesn’t want the government taking over production of your shoes.  (Just healthcare, education, ...).
I have to disagree with you one thing about when you say they don't have nothing in common which is misleading. What they have all in common is the goal of a bigger government hence control of everything in society, order, etc.
A great video overall, but I wish more was done with the capitalist and anarchist parts. Under socialist anarchism, for example, talking about syndicalism, individual anarchism, market socialism, and anarcho-communism. Under capitalism, for example, talking about neoliberalism, welfare capitalism, state capitalism, and laissez faire capitalism. These distinctions might further complicate the video, but are necessary to provide the most complete picture.
Adding the sarcastic tone of voice at the end does not make me want to hear any more from you.
There should really be a better word for the force that is anti-socialism. Capitalism was just a utopian vision from the past that made merchants the most powerful group in society. Capitalism doesn't really have a definition today as it kinda just means whatever non-socialist system is in power, but still clinging to the idea of merchant utopia. Whatever is anti-socialism should be the opposite of it. So I'd imagine a word that imbues totalitarianism, republic, class, private ownership, and slavery
0:33 The communist can of pesto! Youd better share! I love it! XDXD
This video is non sense.\n Its a fact that the first Socialist ( Robert Owen & Henri de Saint-Simon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen )  were both multi millionaire Capitalist, who believed in the free market. But they both  wished to curb its excesses.Today we would call them Social Democrats.\nThey had no time for crazy Karl Marx... But later when Marx was asked how his Communism was going to work, he could not answer....                   So he said he would have pre - communist period first, thats when he stole the word ( 50 years after they invented ).  \nHe called his pre- communist period \"Scientific Socialism\" ... & its a mess all around the world.\n\nWhere as Social Democracies seem to be economically amount the most successful countries in the world
I guess if us Americans had a better mixed economy we could be a Democratic Socialist society.
So basically what your saying is Socialism and it's ilk is just crap!!!
In Sweden 71% is private market. Wow, that is too low.
Such BS... Marxism is total BS, a scam to promise the Russian people an economic system to improve their lives, when in fact, was designed to lead people deeper into Authoritarianism. Marxism/Communism are polar opposites from the \"Enlightenment Era\" theory of Socialism. \nThe theory of Society held Owner-Operator business, in a Free Market, with the liberty from dictates of Authoritarian Conservatives' Kings, Robber Barons, Corporate monopolies, private over-Lords, foreign investors, BS trade deals, etc.
I should have checked the thumbs down ratio. When, when will I learn?
One thing in common, they all are awful forms of government.
Its typical for Marxist post modernists intellectuals to be knowledgeable about all the labels and theories in different concepts and ideologies, yet having little to no understanding of the outcome when its applied to real life. Partially because their bias towards the good intentions in their ideological conviction prevents them to truly understand all aspects of human nature, and partially because they prefer to belive the populistic defenition rather than calling it out for what it really is.
I would put anarchism on the side of capitalism in this particular model. No enforcement of anything certainly sounds capitalistic to me.  A more evolved chart would be a circle, where there is not really a side, but a continuum of idealism.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFxWXbdqGIg\n\npoignant at about 6:15
Long story short: socialists want free stuff (essentially, as everyone gets everything regardless of their input). different \"levels\" may feel certain things are deserved while others require trade. (such as free medical but you need to pay for a car. define luxury)\n\ncapitalists want to own what they created and are willing to trade what is theirs for things that belong to others at greatest benefit for themselves. (may include insubstantial gains, ie friendly relations which lead to more trade)
This is the problem with kids these days. Socialism and Communism are pseudo-politics. They're an excuse to destabilize a nation and insert totalitarian regimes. Yet, these stupid kids still discuss these politics theoretically and never practically. Millions of people dead. That's where it ends. Obvious.\n\nAnd Nazis didn't call themselves socialist you moron. They made it explicit in their material that they are in no way similar to Socialists proper. You're extraordinarily ignorant.
I think a good society needs to take what is good from these ideologies and combine them. A pure capitalist society would mean no country and every will need to pay for things like military protection, firefighting services etc. Imagine needing to bargain with a few firefighting service while your house burn down, or having mercenaries raiding your house and you need to hire your own mercenaries for protection.
You forgot fascism under Marxism
ehm, the nazi party was called national socialist because the national party and the social party was the largest parties at the time. so to steal voters.
We're living in a country that's the finest place of earth But some folks don't appreciate this land that gave them birth I hear that up in Washington they're having an awful fuss 'Cause Communists and spies are making monkeys out of us The bureaus and departments have been busy night and day They're figuring out just how we gave our secrets all away And Congress has appointed a committee so they said To find out who's American and who's a low-down Red. They call them up to Washington to speak for Uncle Sam But when they ask them what they are, they shut up like a clam I wish they'd take and put me on the witness stand today I'd yell so loud old Stalin could hear me all the way Refrain: I'm no Communist, and I'll you that right now I believe a man should own his own house and car and cow I like this private ownership, and I want to be left alone Let the government run its business and let me run my own Our government is bigger than it ever was today The more they hire to work for it, the more they have to pay Our public servants should be proud and honest you would think Instead of taking bribes and dressing up their wives in mink The taxes keep on going up of that there is no doubt But still they just can't take it in as fast as they dish it out Our national debt is monster size and growin' every day Our children's children, still unborn are gonna have to pay Our dollar used be the soundest money on this earth But now two bucks won't even buy a good old dollar's worth Unless we stop inflation and take care of what we've got The Communists may win the fight and never fire a shot!
Socialism goal is communism
Communism is good in theory, but in reality it usually gets overthrown in a coup orchastrated by the CIA.
Doesn't matter which is the name, all those systems destroy the lifestyle of a country reducing the needs to the basic, while the goverment (handle by people, not a machine like you have in your not realistic vision) get all the resources of the economic, while the only thing they achieve is make more people equal in poverty. Easy to defend those systems when you haven't live in any and trust in the words of a parasite that believed that been rich is bad just because and all of us should not keep progress in technology or science for that system works.
Imagine if Bernie tried to give everyone free college and well fare.... how many people are there in America i thin like over 300mill compared to those small countries whos population is the size of of city of Dallas.... So Bernies idea wont work cuz he would have to give all those 300mill over people free stuff and that would be chaos\nJust look at Venezuela lol
Social democracy is the best system. Socialism doesn't work, but still has some good ideas that can improve the capitalism
LOL Cuba's government is Democratically elected? WRONG. Try again......
Shouldn't anarchism be on the far right side of Capitalism? Capitalism without any rules and regulations is anarchy. They call it anarcho capitalism.  Ancaps.
So the world is a socialist run’d
Thanks.  You allowed me to help a friend better explain his position.
Research and read about F.Hayek. e.g. 'Road to Serfdom'
I don't know what's more wrong, calling Cuba democratic or anarchism a sa branch of communism.
This is wonderful, thank you so much. Thor bless.
It's like not knowing the difference between democracy, arnachy, and chaos.
Build the wall!
As much as I hate communists and I want to continue my great grandfathers work of beating and exiling them, nice video xD
One of the biggest problems in the US is that the right, conservatives and Republicans don't care about the details, facts or information, all they care about is maintaining the status quo and ensuring the they remain in power since their delusional belief is that everything they believe in is 100% correct and moral, while anything remotely representing the left or liberalism is evil and unjust (which is fucking hilarious considering the US was founded upon liberalism and majority of the best presidents of all time were left-winged liberals). They fear monger about extremism and paint anyone that calls for any progressive change a radical, all while ignoring the fact that the US currently operates under many right-winged radical policies and fascism but then again, it's absolutely impossible to be a conservative/Republican right-winger in the US and not be a fucking hypocrite in some way.
In conclusion, socialist is an idiot who doesn't know he is a communist
Nigg, Bernie did not lose the nomination. It was stolen from him and given to Hillary, if you don't even know this simple fact, then how do you expect us to believe anything you're saying. GTFO., LOL.
You don’t even know what you’re talking about lol
Bullshit. Germany had no free market
The Cuban government is not democratic dumb ass.
2:00 orgasm
It's pretty simple. Everyone that doesn't agree with me is S C U M
I was hoping for a bit more elaboration on the capitalism side as there seems to be a lot of congestion on the socialist side... I suppose it's a case of if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
Imagine if this video was played on Fox News
2:12 Big Government.
I think the Anarchism should extend to the capitalistic spectrum. Classical Anarchism is much closer to capitalism than communism, while anarcho-socialism is still different from anarcho-communism. Otherwise a great explanation
I had always thought it was stupid of me to not know this stuff.... holy fuck! I’ve watched it multiple times now and think I got it but if you ask me in a week the difference between democratic socialism and social democracy I’m sure I won’t remember. Politics is way too convoluted for anyone normal to understand. Please save us Skynet!
Doesn't matter they were all started by jews
It would be so much easier to refute dumbass conservatives here in America if Bernie said he was for social democracy and not a democratic socialist.
The Difference Between Socialism, Communism, and Marxism?  That would be their kill counts.
Is Bolshevism the same as Leninism?
Capitalism good system that works however it doesn’t work on working class and social economic standards of living....\nTo Grow a Cooperation you need more money than workers to grow and scale that make socialism so damn stupid..
Cuba is democratic\nThe best joke of 2017 confirmed
I myself have a Marxist Vision for the future. If I can become an influential individual to bribe government to change gradually in something else
Communism is a temporary setback on the road to freedom.
Great stuff, pretty much exactly as I understood things myself.
Wow didn't know Cuba was so democratic and the citizens had such a massive democratic choice in their government and party and leaders and economy.
The idea of anarchism is the best to me, tbh
capitalism- one man's exploitation of another.\n\ncommunism- one man's exploitation of many\n\nIslam the exploitation of  many by all the Muslims. ..
That is why Sweden is getting invaded by filthy migrants that take advantage of all on the country and rape your woman. Shameful really shameful. Should all be put in death camps disgusting dogs.
Wrong. Communism isnt a ideology. It has changed a million times in the past 150 years. Its a CULTURE. Not only that, it is a impossible ideology. 100mi dead.
So to recap: The only society that matches the author of this video's definition of 'Socialism' is the one that calls itself a 'Communist' state. This is why people can and should conflate socialism with Communism. Historic practice matters more than philosophers' definitions.
Far Right wing socialist democratism sounds like the kinda world I'd like to live in ??
You didn't include libertarianism, conservitism, anarcho-capitalism, totalitarianism, and many others
At 4:26 you say that \"over 90% of the means of production in Scandinavian are privately owned. I would dispute this. \nI'd start by saying \"means of production\" can apply to basically every single resource, so really we're talking about control over resources. Most resources in modern countries are codified as money, to facilitate exchange of resources, so we could look at the percentage of the money each year that is controlled by some form of democratic institution. The Scandinavian countries have well over 40% of their GDP directly attributable to government, so unless Scandinavian governments are more than 3/4 controlled ownership rather than equal say via voting, then that's more than 10% right there. Then there's the regulations which control just how resources can be used, even when they aren't directly controlled (owned) by the government, which I would say has to be counted as partial social ownership, since ownership is really about right to control the use of, and if some of that control is claimed by government, then it's not fully owned by the private individual. Then there's unions, which control, in part, the resource of labor, and cooperatives and control the resource of goods and services, both of them democratically controlled, not controlled based on who has more money/\"owns\" more.
I heard anarchism is the complete oposite of communism
Wait so communism and marxism do not have democracy?
where does post scarcity capitalism fit in?
social democracy is welfare capitalism
Yes, because Cuba is democratic.... in name only. Most human rights groups and those in academia consider it an (impartial) dictatorship controlled by a one-party state. Especially considering their new constitution (if ratified) bans all other political parties, I don't see how anyone could possibly consider them to be a true democracy, regardless of their communism.
I'd love to see you make a new video addressing the unique brand of socialist principles that everyone from the founding fathers on have utilized.  Past presidents including Lincoln used socialist principles that have enriched and safeguarded this country in ways that our own citizenry are ignorant of.  Because the power elite like to bastardize these terms and tools, it is especially important in today's climate.  The true reforms have always been socialists, American democratic socialism is unique, it needs to be stressed time and time again, esp. today.
XD I always find it funny when people just spit out random ist without knowing what it means
Pure socialism supports communism, pure communism does not support socialism. Pure Marxism supports both. Pure capitalism supports Marxism and is completely against the other two, besides in terms of social equalities in democratic republics such as the U.S. or most monarchies in Western Europe. It’s pretty simple.
Well that's the kind of condescending bitch-tone one could expect from a swede ?? The truth is, these terms are what the public perceives them to be (regardless of their accuracy). But more importantly, why does the public preserve things the way they do? Well, largely because of successful and unsuccessful manipulation of language from politically motivated groups. How come you define communism as this utopian, peace-loving society where everyone works for a common goal lol? I'll tell you; it's because it's more pleasant. You won't have to deal with father selling the body parts of his The Son in the famine infested markets of pre war Ukraine. What's more it's unobtainable. It's the 72 version radical Muslims (socialists) blow themselves up for. You don't seem to be able to realize this though the entire video. More \"friendly\" capitalism. Please explain how stealing from your neighbor is friendly\". On and note, instead of \"educating\" me please give definitions for a practical distinction of the terms. You can't honestly think that the most important distinction of fascism and socialism is the state ownership of production? The issues here are much deeper. I for example would prefer a political vocabulary based on an authoritarian (left) and a liberiatian (right) scale. That would make it much easier determining who's your friend or enemy. Pease out
Question: How can anarchism be socialist if there is no government under that system?
Always good to be exposed to opposite viewpoints as a mean to challenge yourself and how you perceive the other side. I don't agree; though I find the exploration of the topic interesting
And North Korea calls itself \"The Democratic people's republic of Korea\". Which is REALLY a democracy ??
Socialism:sauds good doest work
its all a creation of religion, all isims come frome there.  right?
A lot of Americans seem to demonize communism. They demonize all of it and not just part of it. \nWhen they do talk about communism, they focus on the dictatorships in Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Soviet Union, and others.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr saw some good in communism. A matter of fact, he and other Civil Rights Activists were being accused of being communists.\n\nIn his own words from speeches:\n\n\"Communism should challenge us to be more concerned about social justice. However much is wrong with communism, we must admit that it arose as a protest against the hardships of the underprivileged. The Communist Manifesto, which was published in 1847 by Marx and Engels, emphasizes throughout how the middle class has exploited the lower class. Communism in society is a classless society. Along with this goes a strong attempt to eliminate racial prejudice. Communism seeks to transcend the superficialities of race and color, and you are able to join the Communist Party whatever the color of your skin or the quality of your blood, the quality of blood in your veins.\"\n\n\"No one can deny that we need to be concerned about social justice. Karl Marx arouses our conscience at this point. Karl Marx was born a Jew in a rabbinic family. Somewhere along the way as a child, he must have heard his parents reading the words of Amos: “Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.” Then, when he was six years old, his parents became Christians, and somewhere along the way he must have heard them reading over the New Testament: “Ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto me.” So with this passionate concern for social justice, Christians are bound to be in accord. Such concern is implicit in the Christian doctrine of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Christians are always to begin with a bias in favor of a movement which protests against unfair treatment of the poor, but surely Christianity itself is such a protest. The Communist Manifesto might express a concern for the poor and the oppressed, but it expresses no greater concern than the manifesto of Jesus, which opens with the words, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captive, recovering the sight of the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”And so a passionate concern for social justice must be a concern of the Christian religion.\"\n\n\"There is another thing. Marx reveals the danger of the profit motive as the sole basis for an economic system. We must heed this challenge. I’m afraid that there are too many people in America concerned about making a living rather than making a life. I’m afraid this morning there are too many medical doctors concerned about making a big salary and getting a big home and a fine car than there are about healing the sick bodies of men. I’m afraid that there are too many school teachers in America more concerned about the check that comes at the first of the month than introducing their students to the great, inexhaustible treasures of knowledge and loving them and watching them grow. I’m afraid that there are too many preachers in the pulpit more concerned about their anniversaries than they are about saving the souls of man. I’m afraid, my friends that we are prone to judge the success of our profession by the size of the wheel base of our automobiles rather than the size of our service to humanity. Something is telling us today that there is something more than making a lot of money. We must make money to live, but we must always remember that money is just an ingredient in the objective which we seek in life. And if we don’t see that, we’ll make money-making an end rather than a means. Jesus said, “I know you need it. I know you need money. I know you have need of clothes. I know you need a car to ride in. I know you need a home to live in and to sleep in. I know that you have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God. Seek ye first righteousness, and all of these things will be added unto you.” And this is what we must do.\"\nhttps://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/can-christian-be-communist-sermon-delivered-ebenezer-baptist-church\n\n\"I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about \"Where do we go from here?\" that we must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. There are forty million poor people here, and one day we must ask the question, \"Why are there forty million poor people in America?\" And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising a question about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society. We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's marketplace. (Yes) But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, \"Who owns the oil?\" You begin to ask the question, \"Who owns the iron ore?\" You begin to ask the question, \"Why is it that people have to pay water bills in a world that's two-thirds water?\" These are words that must be said.\"\n\n\"Now, don't think you have me in a bind today. I'm not talking about communism. What I'm talking about is far beyond communism. My inspiration didn't come from Karl Marx; my inspiration didn't come from Engels; my inspiration didn't come from Trotsky; my inspiration didn't come from Lenin. Yes, I read Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital a long time ago (Well), and I saw that maybe Marx didn't follow Hegel enough. He took his dialectics, but he left out his idealism and his spiritualism. And he went over to a German philosopher by the name of Feuerbach, and took his materialism and made it into a system that he called \"dialectical materialism.\" I have to reject that.\n\nWhat I'm saying to you this morning is communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social. And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both. Now, when I say questioning the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.\"\nhttps://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/where-do-we-go-here-address-delivered-eleventh-annual-sclc-convention
The democratic party has a white people holding it back.  White people in the democratic party won't tear down the economic system that they benefit from.   They have to made to feel uncomfortable in the party if we are going to drive them out.
Socialism is alright if kept under control.
Best video i ever watched on ideology. Fucking great explanation, everything accurate.
I have no problem with anyone forming a socialist commune or co-op, as long as membership is 100% voluntary. Then if they achieve their vague and unquantifiable goals and create a society that allows a higher standard of living than exists under capitalism, I'm sure everyone will join them. (Of course, about 0% of socialists seem to be interested in doing it this way. They seem to prefer the glorious 'let's kill and enslave a lot of people' way.)
The Communist Can of Pesto
As a person who lives in a post soviet country, allow me to explain:\nCommunism means removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.\n\nSocialism means removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.\n\nAll forms of collectivism mean removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.\n\nEven when marxism was REQUIRED reading for every man woman and child. Even when private property was completely banned and you didn't' even own your own flat (apartment) and every single business was run by the government. Even when every person believed with all their heart that socialism was THE only correct means to organize society..even with zero freedom to communicate with outside influences to get western propaganda..even when owning levi's jeans was a crime..even when not working was illegal and police stopped every person outside of work doing work hours to demand documentation to prove why you are not working..even when you had to report to the government if you wanted to have a friend stay over night in your registered apartment..even when it was illegal to move to a new city without approval..even with all of this\nSocialism still failed.\nit always fails for the same reasons- pricing that doesn't come from the market. See- if you didn't know how prices for products were formed in the soviet union allow me to explain:\nA authorized person in a company (imagine office but keep in mind that every business and every shop and every taxi was government owned) an authorized person in a company would answer a survey. The survey asked questions like: how much would you pay for 100 boxes of staples? __ and how much would you pay for 50 boxes? _ and how much for 10 boxes? __\n\nThink about this for a moment. Was this person really buying those staples? did they feel the pain of over paying or the benefit of paying the right price that causes efficiencies for the company? NO!!\nOnce all of the prices from the surveys were collected the price of staples was set.\n\nAnd guess what happened? surpluses in staples and deficits in things like meat. why??? because everybody had the same mentality- they figured that meat should be very cheap so they voted for cheap prices. And since the price was so cheap the prices were not high enough to actually develop a \"meat\" industry that could serve all of those customers. Instead- the cheap meat would arrive at the shop.. disappear in a few hours and then the shop would be out of meat until next month. same with eggs- you were lucky to get one egg a week.\nPeople using the survey system voted for higher staple prices which then left us with HUGE stable surpluses. In fact we are still using staples that were produced in the soviet union today.\n\nRead carefully-\nCommunism means removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.\n\nSocialism means removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.\n\nAll forms of collectivism mean removing the pricing mechanism of the market (provided by market forces) and losing all sense of relative value until the inevitable decay of said society.
Marxists and anarchists will never work towards a common goal. You haven’t seen the violent tension between each side if you think this. Not to mention the hatred of Trotskyists by all sides. Generally there is just a lot of infighting.
Communism, Marxism, and Socialism never work.
You didn't mention Finland. Disliked.
things that people Innocently think we can achieve and we actually can not:\n1.world peace\n2.Pure socialism \n3.Pure democracy\n4.Pure capitalism
When some group has you pinned down with their foot on your neck. It doesn't really matter what they label themselves.
As a fellow Marxist: Great video! Your graphic for the difference between the various left-isms really doesn't have much in the way of flaws! I'm curious regarding your terminology of 'orthodox marxism' and 'revisionist marxism'. It makes sense completely but i've always heard it described as an eastern marxism on one hand (eastern bloc marxism or pro-soviet marxism) vs a western or 'humanist' marxism (or in your terms revisionist which. obviously, they are). \n\nWestern marxism then spawned eurocommunism which ended up becoming dependent upon the existence of the current power structures until they petered out into \"\"democratic socialist\"\" aka social democratic parties in todays politics.
Nordic model is not social democracy it is bourgeois socialism.
Scandinavia is awful. I hope communism wipes out their way of thinking.
At 5:35 the “t” in communist is invisible
This is pretty good, comrade! The only big things points I would say aren’t totally accurate are\nA. That Social Democracy is a form of revisionist Marxism. Social Democracy (or at least ideas that pretty identical ideas) predate Marx’s writing. A lot of SocDem parties in Europe were influenced by Marx but it’s not necessarily based on his ideas\nB. That Marxism and Anarchism are the only forms of Communism. This is basically true today and is good for a basic introduction, but in Marx’s time especially there were a lot of other theories of Communism out there’ most of which have practically no followers today\nC. All anarchists are socialists but not all anarchists are communists. This isn’t including mutualists/market socialist anarchists, and Syndicalists who might or might see Communism as the final goal
Sweden is very much a social democracy. And wouldn't you know it!? It sucks! Haha.
\"The trouble with Socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\" -- Margaret, Baroness Thatcher
National socialism was not the same thing as marxist socialism. \n\nnice try tho
I hear that grenades are really cheap in Sweden these days  and they lock up Swedish grannies for voicing their opinion - Think 'Star Trek!'
Gotta love it how primitive is the marxist perspective. :) By the way, maybe somebody knows some intelligent marxists? I am wondering what would be the most intelligent marxist like.
Fucking great video
No, Obama is a socialist.  He is also a shrewd politician. He knows American sensibilities. It all loops back to Marxist ideology. If you believe the state has a right to interfere with freedom in any way, you have Marxist root ideals. The goal is world wide communism, and every variant that comes to accomplish this goal. Which Begins with \"free market\" welfare states.
LOL. Yeah China isn’t a communist country. Try complaining about anything in China and see what happens to you. He doesn’t  seem to realize that allowing some private economic activity does not mean the country isn’t communist, in all other ways.
John D Ruddy...is this you?
This video is absolute rubbish.  \n1. Cuba democratic?  Seriously?  A stunningly oppressive totalitarian dictatorship.  Perhaps only outdone by North Korea.\n2. Nazi's were capitalist?  Nope.  The state may not have owned means of production on paper, but they damn well dictated everything to their cronies and party members who only ran the private sector at the pleasure of their masters in government.  Fascism is socialism with a procedural twist.  Fascism is Pepsi to Communism's Coke.\n3. Communism tries to be stateless?  WHAT?  Whenever they say 'the people' that just means 'the state', 'the collective'.  And 'classless' just means everyone is poor.  \n4. Anarchy is a subset of Marxism?  Super duper wrong.  Anarchy is a total absence of government authority.  It's Mad Max.  Marxism REQUIRES authoritarian government because it needs to coerce people into handing over all their property to the collective.  It is the OPPOSITE of Anarchy.\n5. Democratic Socialism is just voting for which master gets to put a gun to your head to rob you of your labor.  It is a nonsense term crafted to make socialism more attractive to dumb people.\n6. Sweden and Denmark are market economies and are democratic governments, just with above average welfare entitlements.  They are not socialist at all.\n7. Do not confuse or conflate economic systems (Capitalism, Socialism), with governmental systems (Communism, Fascism, Democracy)\n- Laissez -faire Capitalism (I prefer Free Enterprise) is simply freedom.  Voluntary transactions that benefit all parties and CREATE wealth where it didn't exist previously.  Does not require any government involvement because...VOLUNTARY.\n- Socialism, however, can ONLY exist within a totalitarian state.  For a state to plan and control every aspect of a massively complex national economy,  it must be all powerful, and history proves that this is the case.  \nAnd even then, IT HAS NEVER WORKED.  NOT. ONCE.
Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy are virtually the same in the U.S.
You are also wrong on Anarchism. Tell that to Buchanin and he would woop your ass. :P Anarchism is not necessarily socialist. You can have capitalist-anarchism, which makes a whole lot more sense to the anarchist aspirations.
Cuba is democratic and therefore socialist? :D haha that's rich. It is a one-party communist dictatorship, dead compatriot. :)
Good video, but i would've liked you to cover some Non marxist socialism, like libertarian socialism, or even market socialism, there are also some anarchist ideas that aren't completely communistic, like anarcho syndicalism or mutualism.
Wow, everything on the left side of the screen looked scary ??
Nothing in common... except for high taxes, big government, and a lack of freedom.
I'm with the good Mr.  Churchill, \"Democracy is the worst form of government.... except for all the other ones.\"
In socialism you work for the community. In Capitalism you work for yourself. A true socialist will always help you. A true capitalist will always screw you over.
I think that attributing the decisions of production to the population of Cuba (4:16) may be a bit generous.
The doctrine of socialism is obfuscatory on purpose. What it really means is big government. That's it. People will vigorously disagree with this proposition and try to draw a tapestry of various political arrangements. But really, there are only small governments and big governments
I like hierarchy and nationalism. I like preserving traditions and ethnicities. I see a potential danger in Socialism and Capitalism, and the exploitive nature of democracy. I despise anarchism and I would rather have choice in what I do.\n\nThe closest thing to my view is National Socialism...yet, it was violent, didn't allow citizens to own weapons, and was corrupt like the rest. The thing I get out of this is that I would rather have some choice in my life and peace of mind, but most political icons are selfish and violent. Such is life.\n\nAnybody wanna join the National Social-Capitalist Conservationist Party?
Yawn, three terms for essentially the same sociopaths.
They might be all different but the one thing they all have in common is starvation ??
Communism,  socialism ect...\nWill never work because of 1 simple word. GREED.\nGreed is good . Thank God
Good Overview, mostly.\nI would disagree with the characterization that the market under the Nazis was \"mostly\" free. The private ownership was nearly always only on paper and companies were told what/how much to produce and with whom to trade or risk massive fines/be forced to comply. Their regulations were stricter and more dense than most social democrats would be comfortable with. It probably was more closer to a feudal system than an actual capitalist one.
\"Healthcare paid by the government\"\nNo, it's paid by the people. Government does not have money of its own, unless the money comes directly from government-owned business.\n\nif the money comes from taxes, and it mostly does, then it's not government paying for the healthcare, education, etc, it's the taxpayers who pay for it, with government officials being only the middlemen in the transaction.
You mean anarcho-communism, not anarchy. Anarchy is explicitly defined as \"no rulers\", not \"a stateless, classless, moneyless society\". You can have currency in an anarchy, and you can have social classes in an anarchy.
Thanks! Now I understand way better what these people in the chopper are talking about
After listening to this painful discourse on Socialism, I am convinced more than ever:  Shoot them all and let God figure it out.  The only good socialist is a dead socialist.
Anarchist dont belive in the dictatorship of the proletariat
Social Democracy is digusting
This video leaves people more confused than they were prior. The presenter also sounds quite attracted to the Joo Ideology.\nLet me simplify it right down for you. There are only TWO ideologies. You are either with the Joo or you are against the Joo ideology. The Joo is against the Order of Nature (always at war with God) and thus is always a Subversive and a degenerate, convinced of their supremacy.\nYou make your choice where you fit in. As the Joo gains more power, ownership and control, you will be eliminated if you do not concede to Joo ideology to server the Joo. Its happening on this Joo-owned platform as a rule, and in all of society generally, in case you are not aware. This is all you need to be aware of.
0bama is a textbook communist using a phony marx¡st projection. \n0bama is a puppet tool of (((left¡st))) finance capital. \nMerkel = 0bama = Macron = Clinton = Trudeau = Bush = May
2:25 It is fair to say that there is free market capitalism in China, however I wouldn't characterise the economy as such overall. There is massive government involvement in banking, agriculture, and industry, and the tax and currency policies are as far away from laissez-faire as you could get.
So if Karl Marx said the stage BETWEEN Capitalism and Communism is Socialism  how is Communism a subset of Socialism ? Socialism is the Belief that Society has a Role to play in matters that Affect Everyone . Communism is the Belief that the Government controls everything no matter wether or not it affects everyone . In reality Capitalism is a subset of Socialism where Society allows those with Capital to make decisions on where to invest that capital.
A socialist is a young communist.
Thank you for the video. Been looking for a video that explains socialism and some branches in the socialistic ideology. Subbed.
I'm a pure capitalist who wants small government. COME AT ME
Those who say that the owners of the factories want the wages to be as low as possible don't know what they are talking about. What theventrepreneurs want is CONSUMERS.
Thank you.
sorry more on but Karl Marx himself said that socialism is the pathway to Communism and communism is its end result apparently you haven't read The Communist Manifesto
sorry but Marxism communism socialism fascism Nazism are all actually the same thing because it's all socialism it's all authoritarianism and it all takes rights away from the people and gives it to the government
The \"socialism equates communism\" is a libertarian meme, as we all know that libertarians HATE civil and human rights, and socialism will always expose the evils of private entities trying to overthrow the state in order to bring a new age of slavery. In shorts, libertarians are literal movie villains, and deserve to have their heads cut off from a guillotine in a public execution.
You have the astounding ability to be about half right on about half of what you talk about... That's impressive.
Pure Socialism is greed and envy. “you have too much”, “I know better than you”.....yet the leaders in these socialist and Communist societies never seem to have a tough time...
Thank you! This is brilliantly simplistic. You clarified so many things!
Just read the book \"Why Socialism Works\" by Harrison Lievesley    - https://www.amazon.com/Why-Socialism-Works-Harrison-Lievesley/dp/1521531218/
It'd be helpful if you plotted the number of deaths attributed to each form of socialism as well as all of the failed states that were unable to implement true socialism.  Sort of a primer of what to expect as South Africa transitions into a communist state.  Or maybe a recap of that long distant Venezuela experiment?  Capitalism is the truest form of a Democracy.  Every dollar spent or saved is a vote cast.  If you need religion, don't look to socialism.
Just because an idea is \"Marxist\" doesn't mean that it came from Marxist theory. It's perfectly reasonable to come up with some of his ideas on yours own and his name is just a label for those ideas. Leaning social democrat because you want rent control, minimum wage, socialized healthcare, doesn't mean that you read Marx.
Anarchism is closest to capitalism and is the opposite of communism. You made some big errors in your video. I suggest you do some basic reading and then redo the video!!
Mostly a bunch of crap... but useful for recognizing just how insipidly idiotic socialism actually is. It is liberal in the term of being individually general, esoteric, and generic so as to promote the collective. Socialism and collectivism are practically synonyms... the only really meaningful distinctions you need to make are whether you PERSONALLY believe they should remain strictly PRIVATE SECTOR or part of the STATE (government). \n\nThis PRIMARY distinction determines whether you believe in free will (the PRIVATE SECTOR option) where all participation remains VOLUNTARY and cannot be forced upon others, because doing so is a dick move (and under Capitalism... illegal). \nOr do you believe in the STATE option that allows whatever ruling collective has the majority (power) to FORCE COMPLIANCE (participation) from those who dissent (people exercising free will) who are usually punished rather severely (if not outright killed). \n\nAnd then we have Capitalism... the private ownership of means of production (your human effort) as well as self determination through property ownership and personal rights as protected by the RULE of LAW. In America that's the part, \"Equal under the law, and each by their own merit.\"\n\nIf you like the idea of VOLUNTARY Private Sector Socialism... then Capitalism embraces your right to form collectives (ashrams, co-ops, unions, exchange farms, non-profits, volunteer health and care networks, etc.) that can innovate and grow to encourage HUGE social benefits without the WEIGHT of STATE INTERFERENCE.\n And so long as you break no law by hurting others, stealing, or forcing others to participate... NO ONE WILL STOP YOU !!  \nIn America these things are also known as Private Sector Charities, Community Projects, and/or Citizen's Initiatives. They also ROCK because they're more efficient, honest, and timely in addressing various local and far ranging social needs than ANY form of STATE WELFARE can ever hope to manage. Best part... they actually alleviate HUGE burdens from the STATE... so it can be freed up to tackle more important matters. This obviously alleviates the need for excessive taxes as well, the ones that fund our various slow & inefficient government welfare programs. \nNOTE: doing so basically cuts out the \"middlemen\" so resources go more directly from the source (benefactors) to the actually needy. Oh yeah, because they're locally managed within the communities they serve... HONEST private charities are nearly always MAGNITUDES better at avoiding scammers and fakers... so people actually in need are the ones most often getting help they actually deserve. \nVarious local and STATE (government) programs & workers are inherently \"out of sync\" with the actual lives of the immediate populace and always will be, for they represent the interests of the STATE that pays and provides for THEM... not the community. Social Workers are just as much slaves as those they supposedly help... in truth, they're nothing more than the welfare plantation's \"leading slaves,\" the lower middle-management that the bosses use to keep others in check. They're just as stuck in the endless cycles of dependency as their charges... but afforded a slightly better lifestyle for keeping the others under control.   \n\nIf you like the STATE (INVOLUNTARY) version of Socialism... you're either part of the empowered collective, or for some godforsaken reason, assume you will be (though statistics prove otherwise). \n\nA little known FACT about Socialism... those who actually have good hearts and morals, yet still enable it, are also the first to die (or be discredited) for they are the ones most capable of toppling the regime or collective in power... because they're also the ones most capable of making believable arguments AGAINST them... and being SUCCESSFUL. \nReally think about that one... and do some research. The people that will actually be in power already know WHO to get rid of... before their \"Great Emancipation\" of the masses even starts.  \nMy advice... don't EVER dissent after you lose your place... or speak up about things you disagree with. The STATE always knows what is best so your inconveniences are NECESSARY... that others may get what they need. And you don't own anything anymore... so you LITERALLY have nothing left to lose by their standards, not even your life... because those who serve willingly are lapdogs unworthy of respect, and those who dissent are an infection to \"THE CAUSE.\"\nALL are re-replaceable... because individuals are NOT special... only the Collective... which actually means the STATE... or more correctly... the people that run the STATE.  \nYour other options are to flee or fight... so under socialism... there are NO SAFE CHOICES (OR SPACES) and your feelings mean NOTHING (even when your children are being raped, starved, and/or dismembered in front of you).   \nThink about this for a moment... if Communism is really about the PUBLIC GOOD and PUBLIC ownership... why in the HELL is there ALWAYS a government (STATE) managing it? And if there is no state managing it, who will enforce the rules and make the decisions? Won't they still be a default STATE even if they have no real classifications or titles?\n\nConcerning Anarchy...it comes from the greek words \"an\" meaning without, and \"archon\" which was a sovereign (divine, or representative of the divine) leader. \nSovereignty is based upon the right to rule as bequeathed by a pantheon, deity, or some form of higher power. That is why the kings and queens of England are also the head of the Church of England. Nations are also Sovereign for similar reason but... that's for another time.\nANARCHY actually means, \"Without earthly (mortal) masters.\" \nThe term was mainly used to describe \"lesser\" tribes and peoples that had no discernible or known central rulers, deities, or governing body.\nClinical Psychologists and other Erudite Scholarly Types (Practically all of whom, like 99.8%, are leftist by the way) will explain that people are inherently chaotic and/or abhorrent by nature... and that the absence of leadership inevitably leads to CHAOS (so they can then justify CONTROLLING OTHERS) though any leaders (mostly erudite schmucks) we follow are also human... and therefore no better than the ones they control... even when they CLAIM to be of divine right. \nYeah, like that makes ANY rational sense. Humanity would be incapable of surviving past a few generations if that were true no matter who was in control... because the controlled and controllers would constantly innovate their ability to destroy one another as they rebel (at the cost of all other pursuits)... until one side or another won and the process began anew in following generations (if any). Just as likely, both parties would quickly perish from total LACK OF TRUST and their inability to co-operate. \n\nNOW things get interesting: The right is often touted to resort to ethnic superiority as its default extremist view. But this is only accorded by erudite leftists and other scholarly HACKS who also claim that the Nazi Socialist Party were somehow a \"right wing\" regime. There are NO conservative (right wing) Nazi's and never were, because there are NO right wing SOCIALISTS... and the Nazi's were creating a \"Utopian Society\" that abandoned or re-wrote family and traditional norms instead of upholding them. Liberals (BY DEFINITION) shirk tradition to embrace change. CONSERVATIVES approach change with caution (not out of fear) to protect and defend things of PROVEN MERIT and VALUE (beliefs, traditions, resources, relationships, etc.) ... not by race... but by family and cultural MORAL distinctions.\nThe default extremism of the right is based on moral zealotry... not race nor superiority. It is actually defending and protecting what is most valued and dear to us... our FAMILY and TRADITION. This is also the DEFAULT NATURE of general humanity... for any person left alone eventually seeks to create a family and/or traditions of their own. \nUnless they're inherently born sociopaths, psychopaths, etc. (of course). Or... should through life they suffer similar diseases of the mind and/or spirit that lead them toward DEPRAVITY.      \n\nThat being said, the default of Anarchy (having no earthly masters) is NOT chaos, mobocracy, nihilism, or any of that rubbish... it is Family and Tradition... which can best be summed up over time as Cultural Morality. That is... the collection of PROVEN beliefs/insights/methods/observations, etc. garnered over time that allow people to survive and/or also do well within (and as) a society.\n\n\nBack to Sovereignty: Under other forms of government National Sovereignty is typically held by the CHURCH, Ruling Family, or STATE... NOT the CITIZENS.\n\nAmerica is a CIVIL AUTHORITY... as established by our Declaration of Independence... the \"endowed by their creator\" part, which no matter your personal belief (secular or non-secular) infers DIVINE STATUS to ALL sentient beings (Humanity). This INHERENT and INSEPARABLE personal recognition... as a FACT of BIRTH (and/or Voluntary Acceptance) makes ALL AMERICANS individually AND collectively SOVEREIGN as a NATION. Our National Sovereignty resides within each of us as a nation of PEERS (siblings of divine heritage) not the STATE... and we LEND a portion of it through CIVIL CONTRACT to enable our CAPITALIST REPUBLIC... so it may create, enforce, and interpret JUST LAWS that enable us to maintain our rights and freedoms... while our fellow citizens within those offices also deal with various infrastructure, defense, and international affairs... BUT ONLY ON OUR BEHALF. \nThis was enabled by DIVIDING the typical powers of a Sovereign Ruler between 3 separate but equal branches with many offices as well as a system of checks and balances. (& the 2A)\n\nIn summary... America and Americans have NO EARTHLY MASTERS... and we are a nation of LAWS. \n\nTHUS: BY ACTUAL DEFINITION... America IS a CONSERVATIVE ANARCHY   \nEMBRACE IT \n\nHuGGz
Lenin said that the end goal of socialism is communism and Marx used the terms socialism and communism interchangeably. Furthermore, Scandinavia and those countries are pulling back from social programs such sas single payer health care.
Wish you would've clarified more to what was on that right end of democratic socialism... I find it hard to figure out whether I'm a democratic socialist or a social democrat on this chart.. Also where you'd put Bernie Sanders on this is hard to place between the two as well.. though I know he's not that far left on the chart to be considered communist
Guy, your definition of \"Socialism,\" is the exact definition of Communism: a society where the means of production are (supposedly) controlled by the people or proletariat.  In practice, however, the means of production are always controlled by a PRIVILEGED few Plutocrats who put themselves in power by very undemocratic and illegitimate means (violence).  It is usually a one party state because no opposition or intellectual diversity is permitted.  This, incidentally, is why Socialism, Communism, Fascism, and Nazism are all evil to the core.  Freedom from the iron fist and violence of the state is the only way to have and maintain a just society.  And, because schools are all now controlled by the state, children are no longer taught the inherent dangers of government.
“Free Education”\n\nPaid for by the government. \n\nHow does the government make money?
Wow and here I thought when the Idea of left and right were talked about .... The extreme  far left could be looked at as total government control over the people ....  and the extreme  far right would be no government what so ever... So in that thinking  Anarchist would fall under the extreme far right ...on the complete opposite end of the spectrum you would find government under Socialism, Communism, and Fascism ..
All you need to know is both socislism and communism as conceived and practiced thus far will figuratively fuck the individual on the arse. The socialist will say it is good for you anf you will like it, the communist really does not care for you either way. In either case you're were still ass fucked.
not gonna lie, been calling myself a democratic socialist for a while when in reality my views are social democratic...\n\nBerny is the same thing...so many people who actually believe in Social Democracy are calling themselves Democratic Socialists. TBH though, I would've drawn the diagram of Social Democracy overlaying both Socialism and Capitalism because it has strong aspects of both.
Second note...Neither Communism, Socialism and Capitalism are inherently Evil...they ALL have the ability to become used for Evil...just depends on who takes control..
Theft and Death
You gather most forms of anarchy is as far right as you can get right?
\"free\" education/healthcare isn't paid by the government. The government is just a middle man thieving from the productive just like the mafia.   Sweden/Bernie/Cuba/Nazis/China all believe in forced collectivism in varying degrees so not nothing. In all these places collectivism is more important than the individual so full of greedy people trying to get a free ride.
I like much of what you have to say, but the description of Anarchism being a form of Communism is extremely flawed at best.
Why did so many Cubans want to leave Cuba and why are they still leaving in droves? Democratic Socialism doesn't seem to work so well.
Stop being sheeple and use your own brains!
not paid for by the government, paid for by the people's taxes.  wrong already?
Communism took over Britain in 1945 straight after the second world war.
yaaaaaawn seems like someone is trying to paint socialism as something \"good\".
With this explanation, it can be concluded that Venezuela is currently under a socialist, marxist (renamed bolivarian, although bolivar had nothing to do with marx or his thoughts) and communist.
All of these terms are the same just to different extremes this is the two factors that matter; can property be owned by the people and is profit illegal. In communist nations all property is owned by the government and profit is illegal. Meanwhile Socialists demonize the wealthy, want a redistribution of wealth and confiscation of property ownership.
Very well made video. Even though my views are on the right I still found this very informative and unbiased.
Cuba is owned by the Castro family.
It seems to me that plutocracy has taken over.
You failed to place fascism on your socialist chart. It might be placed where you had social democracy since it does embrace  capitalism but is still part of the socialist map.
Still don't want to give someone else something I worked my ass off for.
“The goal of socialism is communism”- Vladimir Lenin
Socialism - a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.\n\nYou left off \"or regulated\". Truth in advertising qualifies as regulation.\n\nThis is an anti-socialist hack piece.
So where does national socialism fit into your little diagram?
(Last one) As I understand it, some ten percent of the production companies in USA are owned by the workers in cooperatives, meaning that they are socialist.
I don't think I've ever met a self-identified socialist who has actually claimed that workers should own the means of production. They are for strong unions and strong workplace regulations, and of course a share of the profits (they worked for it).
Actually, the definition of socialism is that the workers own the means of production, not a community or a state, as would be the case under communism. Socialism is not necessarily anti-capitalist, although democratic socialism is. Also, note that many anti-communist movements have been socialist, such as the solidarity movement in Poland and the student revolt at Tiananmen Square.
Fucking What? Please repeat. Thanks
Good video overall, but I most definitely would not lump anarchism in with the socialist family as a sub-category. Rather it should be another umbrella category that sits on the bottom of the other two so your graph can occasionally overlap with the others when relevant.
Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Given that ALL governments are the same. They all accumulate power which corrupts them. The minor differences in policies are just that-minor. They all centralise power which is used to get more power and wealth. The real difference in ideology is between those that believe people should be ruled by a political gang and those that don't. Decentralise all power. Everything thing should be done voluntarily with no coercion at all. Coercion is force and force is violence. ALL government's are violent, only the level of violence differs.
Uhhh, still too confusing.
Capitalism serves the customer. Socialism doesn't because of \"worker\" narcissism that competes against the narcissism of the customer. People then make the argument by degree, which is fallacious & is detrimental to freedom in general because once you introduce the spill-over theory's cousin (argument of degrees) then you automatically fuck everyone over with a bullshit culture of hyper-egotism that has nothing to do with the development of civilization.
Well done. Covered everything. Very thorough and detailed. Maybe minus the umbrellas examples and replace them with more general audience so we can share it with our social media adversary pals.
Ive read your website and wholeheartedly disagree. You quote Fight Club and Startreak for crying out loud. Communism a and Socialism have failed many timed on their own. We intervened to stop its spread. Why do you think China has converted to capitalism? Because it works.  We Already have socialist aspects to our government(social security, welfare etc). Things you don't address on your webiste... who governs and makes all the rules? Who decides where your personal space starts and ends? How do you reward hard work? How do you incentivize hard work and innovation? Capitalism mimics evolution in a way and thats why it works. Communism and Socialism would make everyone poor, Capitalism rewards those who work hard and innovate. GTFO you commie.
there is no difference. money, power, control, greed, corruption. all mental diseases, failures, destroyers. capitalism and republic democracy only successful form of gov't. period. history's proven so time and time again. the rest narcissistic, evil, garbage.
Between 2. Among 3 or more.
Kind of leaving out the part where the pinkos are usually totalitarian governments, if not outright dictatorships, with a huge history of trampling human rights and suppressing individual freedoms for the \"greater good\" of \"the people\". Just the freedom of speech exemplified in the making this video is usually non-existent in those places. Hell, the technology of the internet would never have even materialized if not for capitalism.. Commies always liked hiding behind the word \"socialism\", and those of us who lived through the Cold War will never forget this.
You have given us YOUR definition of socialism.  You did say it could mean pretty much whatever you wanted.
Cuba a democracy controlled by the people?  That's a laugh.
their actually was a very prominent socialist sector fo the nazi movement. Earnst Roam the leader of the nazis brown shirt thugs wanted a sort of socialism, however he got executed and the nazis ditched any socialist leanings when they got into government. Also don't qoute me on this but I think the term \"National Socialist\"   is meant to emphasize the collective nature of socilism, however this collectivism would be carried out through nationalism not the redistribution of wealth.
Capitalism is an economic model under proper liberalism. The comparison should be leftist versus right (small government, liberal society), not capitalism per sé
So the left keeps changing shit to steal freedom from the right. Got it. Where does neo nazism , stalenism , fall i to this chart?
As a Cuban who’s lived under Castro and still has family in Cuba whom I constantly speak to, this guys whole assumption about the people being in power lack footing in reality.\n\nAlso the whole pay the worker as much as possible is complete BS. Part of the reason socialism and communism fail to work all throughout history.
There is no difference between Socialist, Communist or Marxist. It's easy to just pick up a dictionary and see the definitions are the same. There are only 2 semi Socialist countries left on Earth - Cuba and North Korea. Sweden is in no way Socialist. Not unless you also believe America is Socialist.
I became more confused after watching the video.
Did I miss where you mentioned the workers paradise that is North Korea?
call it what you will -- it doesn't matter because the end result is the same... the enslavement of the individual to the state. It destroys economic freedom and confiscates the labor of the individual for the benefit of the collective.\n\n    It's always worked so well every time it's been tried... take Venezuela as an example, or the USSR, or Cuba, or DPRK, or Myanmar.\n     Socialism is consistent in providing a poor standard of living coupled with a substantial lack of individual freedoms.\n\nThe apologists, like this video maker, always try to draw these distinctions in an effort to shield socialism from the  blame it deserves for the horrors it has brought upon the world.\nThe most amusing apologetic is the \"no true scotsman\" fallacy --- you know how it goes: \" well, the USSR wasn't TRUE socialism, Cuba isn't TRUE socialism, Venezuela isn't TRUE socialism... just trust us and we'll do it right... uhhhmmmm ...NO
Good video though.??
There are difference yes, mostly in the detail on paper.  But the arguments tend to be how these terms are being used wrongfully and how these countries use it that ends up in the bad scale.  Which as we seen in history from multiple empires, always lead to totalitarian regime.  And just because some of these are umbrella terms, its like adding frosting on a bad cake, may taste and look nice at the top and on the outside but dig in deeper and you’ll get the dirt of the cake.  Basically, from your chart shown in your video, it doesn’t look like a feasible option.
Where's the proof that all this is true ?
So the only economic system that actually works is capitalism.
Communism isn't the final stage of socialism (the absence of a state and so on and a utopian society..)  Socialism is the final stage and communism is the the stage in wich the government takes control of the economy under tyrannical rule. That's why socialism is the the utopia and communism is not. So, 1-revolution, 2-communism, 3-socialism.
Communism, Marxism, Socialism, Bolshevism and  Democracy are all genocidal Babylonian Talmudic based large-scale organized crime systems run by Jews, for Jews and relying on “herds” of disposable Goyim slaves, allowing the Parasitic ruling Oligarchy of Jewish Nihilists to live in luxury.
You've seriously over complicated socialism. Let me simplify it for you.\nI exist, therefore you owe me = socialism in a nutshell.
They all are centrally planned economies. Marxist.
Right off the bat wrong in the title. It isnt that communism and socialism are diffrent communism is one of many types of socialism like in capitalism there are many types libertarianism conservatism ect both capitalist they don't say the other is diffrent than capitalism both have the rich controlling means of production and privatization which is the definition
Portugal is the ONLY country that has Socialism as a goal written on its constitution
Great video!
Great video, though the U.S. crowd will generally not understand your challenges to their propagandist definitions that they've embraced in the same way that they embrace religion. Zealotry, violence, and a continued lack of education about governmental and economic systems are at the core of the utter false narrative that purveys the U.S. understanding. If not derived from the idiot box of television, they will reject your more informed position as \"fake\". The average idiot in the U.S. has no education in politics or civics, but will utter their opinions as though they had a degree in those subjects.
Where is Stalinism?
@2:08 it looks like one of those Illumanti parody videos of how everything is connected to a one-eye!
Cuba democratic, hahaha.
I appreciate this explanation more people should understand it
Your site you linked is pretty biased against capitalism as it doesn't mention any of the intensive labor or risk taken at the expense of entrepreneurs, the power and rights of employees to negotiate their wages in accordance with supply and demand, including the ability to negotiate higher wages on their own merits. As well as just generally coming off as entitled and ungrateful. But that last part is just an opinion. Can say I agree with you on anything but the definitions, but it was very informative nonetheless.
Pretty good ??
It's not the 'problem' of socialism.  It's the problem of stupid people not understanding or wanting to understand the difference.
Socialism. Communism\n Marxism. the rich. poor.  need to stop being a fool. you are all being played for fool the same people are behind it all. playing you wake up. there no reason to fight controls you self no War help don't hurt eacher others\n.
Hit the table when you speak really underlines your points...
Piece of filth trying legitimize genocide! You’re sick and a threat to humanity!
There is plenty of cultural Marxism going on in Europe and the U.S.
There are so many types of socialism and/or communism that it appears they were made to confuse.
You should wonder next socialism will lack marxism, what it seems to me is going to happen at last in Spanish America
\"The goal of socilism is comunisism\" ! Vladimir  Lenin
You talk a lot about the economic factors. but never the political or real-world factors. like how this community you speak of is under the rule of a dictatorship?  the dictatorship that owns the community and is in charge of regulating and governing the people.China is communist they have child slavery, human trafficking, sweet shops it must wonder if you were picked by the government to have a specific job that suits you. But the reality is we need trashmen, and sewage workers and people to clean Sh** and do shi*y jobs. this is explain how that works in socialism?? basic freedoms and rights are also lost in socialism. The Cuban people don't own shit! the Cuban people are oppressed by Castro and his onslaught. the dictatorship of the socialist \"ruling party\" run the military, drugs, exports, imports, and make the people work for wages so minuscule they can barely survive. I have been there and have a friend from theirs. You people always try to justify the socialistic idea of community but never mention that a faction of selected community leaders above all else(oligarchy, dictators) rule everything, remove peoples sovereignty, and oppress people for their own personal gain...Factors Socialism was created to implement communism, Marx openly states this, Lenin openly states And Troskey openly this and quotes this. Socialism Has a never will work anywhere in the world.  Dictators don't like to share power and community they like to control people through power.  We dont ever have to worry about socialism here in America and the post office is not a socialist inventions (via fed ex-competition) innovation!!! We live in an nationalist constitutional elected republic... USA!
\"Death is a preferable alternative to Communism!\" - Liberty Prime
No gay lgbt ppl in soviet union :))
not true we are Democratic Socialists, not Socialists. 2 different things!
You missed Anarcho-Capitalism AKA Ancap. You glossed over the NAZI system, where the owners of private businesses important to the State were appointed by the government. You also glossed over the millions dead by Leftist ideology.
This comment takes the form of a Glossary.\n\nProperty right = a relationship between one or more humans, called owners, and a physical or abstract thing owned, called property. The state and its legal system define and enforce property rights. Property rights confer prerogatives, not rights, on owners, and if this is accepted, the term \"property rights\" is a misnomer. Property rights determine the possible economic uses of property, and the conditions under which use rights can be transferred from an existing owner to a new owner. A property right can be of indefinite duration, or time limited. Two ready made “bundles” of property rights are in common use today: freehold, or fee simple, corresponding to the everyday understanding of ownership, and leasehold, corresponding to rental arrangements.\n\nPrivate property = Property whose associated property rights are enjoyed by individuals or firms.\n\nCapital goods = land, natural resources, buildings, machinery and intellectual property (mainly patents, copyrights and trademarks). The production and distribution of all goods and services invariably require capital goods. \n\nMarket economy = system whereby anybody can start a business, and any business can be shut down by its owners. A business can charge any price it wishes to charge. Buyers are free to buy or not buy what a business offers for sale. If unsold goods pile up (sell out), prices and production are cut (increased). Hence prices are the result of never ending trial and error. Under a market economy, capital goods are private property.\n\nCapitalism = market economy augmented by bank credit and a sharemarket. In a market economy that is not capitalist, all firms are proprietorships and partnerships. Borrowing from a bank is not an option. Hence firms pay for capital goods by dunning the proprietor or partners, or by saving part of their profits over time instead of paying out those profits to their owners. The sharemarket makes it much easier to acquire a small stake in a firm, and to come up with a selling price for part or all of such small stakes. The paradigmatic capitalists are stockholders, and bankers in charge of business lending.\n\nSocialism = system whereby all firms over a certain small size are operated as government departments administered by civil servants. The state pockets any profits, and covers any losses. Today, the only clear socialist economies are North Korea and Cuba. Under socialism, capital goods are owned by the state. To date, the administration of every socialist state has been authoritarian, peremptory and undemocratic. An unsolved problem under socialism is getting industrial and retail prices right. High prices strangle happiness; low prices result in careless and wasteful use.\n\nCommunism = (a) utopian system imagined by Marx that has yet to materialise anywhere; (b) colloquial term for the authoritarian socialist economies that emerged in the 20th century, and that almost all failed by the end of that century.\n\nMixed economy = system with a mix of state owned and privately owned firms.  The state also regulates the price, quantity and quality of some goods and services produced by private firms.  Every nation on Earth is a mixed economy, excepting the handful of remaining socialist economies.\nThe mixed economies around us thrive to varying degrees, because nothing human under the sun is perfect. Some (the Left) believe that taking steps in the socialist direction would yield greater happiness; others (the Right and the Libertarians) believe that happiness lies in taking steps towards a purer market/capitalist economy. I don't expect this debate to end within the lifetime of anyone now living.
Socialism doesn't work and communism is a utopian fantasy. Your example of a true communist society(Star Trek) makes the latter clear. While, every socialist state that has ever existed makes the former utterly clear. Unless you can do it better...
Shit...bullshit...and horseshit\n\nFify
Am I right when I state the u.s. is “supposed” to be a capitalistic democratic socialist republic?   Although it seems to be leaning towards a authoritarian nationalistic oligarch demagoguery...
In countries like China, the former USSR, Cuba, and the Eastern Bloc countries (before 1989) the PEOPLE had NO SAY in anything as regarding how the country was run, or how resources were allocated. Every communist country ends up as a dictatorship sooner or later.  To equate 'the state' with 'the people' is a favorite commie trick. The 'People's Republic of China' is neither a republic, nor is it 'of the people' at all.
The Cuban State is run by the Cuban people??? C'mon, everyone knows that is total BS. It's been a communist DICTATORSHIP since Castro took over in 1956.
minute differences. it's all central control of the masses while the elites get rich and powerful. it is the biggest lie in human history
[4:10} Cuba is democratic?  I think not.  Dictators
That chart clears things up nicely. Thank you.
I have no hope for us cleaning up this mess anytime soon, but at least I can finally explain how my transition from libertarian to fascist is more democratic in the sense of actually enforcing the peoples' will. I mostly agree with the views of Oswald Mosley, but may have a stronger leaning to social democracy due to conservatives and ancaps being cucked into believing net neutrality is a bad thing.
Or maybe the only thing they have in common is...\nthey're collectivist?
Cuba is \"democratic\"?  (4:00)  This guy is an idiot and a troll.
There are ONLY TWO kings of governments:\nSovereignty of the Citizen: Where the government works FOR the Citizen and does what they tell it to do.\nOR\nSovereignty of The STATE: Where YOU work FOR the government.  The GOVERNMENT tells you what to do, what to read, what to hear, what to see, what to think.....And your ONLY value to the STATE is \"How much can we take from you\" ....  \n \"Pay 'Your fair share' for the 'good of the collectiv', Tovarish\"...\nSovereignty of the STATE only works when the populace are UNARMED SHEEPLE...Maintaining power over an unwilling populace is SO MUCH EASIER when they DON'T HAVE ANY GUNS...
Communism says: \"Workers own the means of production\"........ BUT you can't buy stock in The Izhmash Arsenal in Tula...\nWith Capitalism, If you buy ONE SHARE of stock, you have just as much right to go to the stockholders meeting and jump up down on the C.E.O.'s  desk and sell him shit, as someone with 1,000,000  shares.   If you buy one share in 100 companies, and go to all the stockholders meetings, you start to have an effect on those companies, because the people with 100,000 shares can't be bothered to show up ...
This video.. Eleven minutes. My explanation eleven seconds. They're all on the road to becoming communist. Just use softer names to lure the useful idiots and puppets to their cause.
There's another name for a group of private individuals with a shared interest: a community. So the definition of socialism can be read as: \"A society in which the means of production are owned by the community instead of by the community.\" If this makes sense to you, you're probably a left extremist.
Dude, you're 2 minutes in and all you've done is drop some names of politicians. Why is it that left extremists can never just get to the point?!
This is a bad way of thinking about things. It is more likely any person falls on both sides of this dumb imaginary line. Whereas I believe in private business, but prisons should never be privately run. And while I still believe in private businesses, I just think roads should be maintained through taxes. So it not like anyone is either capitalist or socialist, it is far more likely that we are all somewhat a little of both. These days you got big mouthed far lefts and rights spouting off like anyone gives a shit what they think. But the truth is most of us got common sense and fall near the middle. It's common sense that things like schools, roads and prisons should be available to everyone and there for funded through taxes and monitored by the government. But you can't do that same thing with bakeries and butcher shops because not everyone uses them.
So what you're saying is that socialism and communism is the same thing... Well I already knew that... there no difference between the 2. Wtf? I thought I was missing something
Your website, says many incorrect statements, not to mention no socialist or communist society actually has been successful, and it goes against human nature, human nature doesn’t change, hasent and won’t
I really wish people would stick to the dictionary definitions of these terms instead of making up their own definitions.  His definition of socialism is not correct.  Socialism in my hard copy Merriam-Webster dictionary says that the state runs/owns/distributes everything, not the community.
??
Nothing
Reasonable explanation and I would agree that this is pretty accurate ... That doesn't change the fact that capitalism or a society where one can pursue their personal self-interest is the moral standard ... anything that seeks to do the opposite will end up sacrificing human life for their common good as what principles you hold matter and will go to extremes eventually.
@T11:00 \n\nNautre, mis spelling.
Everyone is equal in communism. Equally poor, except the dictators.
Startrek is far from classless though.
Interesting distinctions. However, the aspect that sticks out to me is that the \"socialist\" communist nations, and some \"democratic\" socialist nations, are controlled by a central party, and while there are \"People's Congresses\" of one sort or another, they almost always fall into line with party leadership - which typically leads to one individual (or small group of power brokers) - thus serving as little more than a panacea for the people who actually fall for the \"people's movement\" rhetoric.\n\nI think a lot of people who think they're socialists would chaff at, rebel against, or merely cower, when they discover the true nature of their government, especially if they took part in emplacing it.
Social democracy is predicated on redistribution of wealth, it is Marxist & antithetical to capitalism.\n\nHumans are the means of all production. Capitalism demands self ownership & is the defacto means in which all people own \"the means of production\" this ownership is individual. \n\n(Insert new bullshit qualifier ) socialism is predicated on the \"socialization\" of the means of production. It is collectivist & anti individual.\n\nSlavery is socialism. Whatever qualifier you put in front of it reduces to taking the right of individual ownership & murdering it so those that rule society may do so without worrying about violations of individual rights hampering their visions.
As an Australian, I am SO TIRED of people calling my country \"Socialist\". WE ARN'T, OK.

Cuba doesn't have legitimate elections... Castro and his brother have ruled Cuba together for decades.
China, Bernie Sanders, Cuba, sweden and the nazis DO have one thing in common. Big Government.
\"paid for by the government\" ahhahahahahahahah.
Democracy requires choice. Cuba, being a one-party system, is by definition not democratic. Sham elections with one choice do not a democracy make.
What we have here is your typical communist scree. If you can't Dazzle them with Brilliance baffle them with bull shit! What we have here is 2000 Shades of Grey and attempting to differentiate the despised communism term with the new improved user-friendly socialist moniker. Communists /Socialists are essentially the same damn thing. They live in the grand delusional cult idea of try it you'll like it. This is why you will never get a straight answer from the communist. They have a million and one reasons why they're delusional political ideology always fails. And it's never the fault of their ideology. The great grand social scam is ,in Humanity nobody is equal. And no amount of government or propaganda bullshit is going to change this fact! Communism/ socialism love to talk about the uneducated poor downtrodden masses that they claim to protect. No it's just a con job to take advantage of these people to put slightly smarter people into power. And when it comes down to it the same globalist Elites are running things behind the scenes. Where do you think the October Revolution got its funding? Where do you think the Nazi party got its funding? Where do you think Mao got his funding? What was it the grand poobah Rothschild said? He didn't care who was in charge as long as he controlled everything.
Great Work! In the Link,  a similar video of mine but in Spanish ?  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6iGCozEgzGM&t=778s#
Seems like a distinction without a difference since economies crash and people starve either way
saying cuba is democratic is like saying rape is unexpected sex surprise!!\nI am venezuela the shit hole country thanks to socialism/communism!
Stop Talking about what the Ideology is and get to the GRIT. THE MEAT. THE BRASS TACKS.\nHOW DO YOU INTEND TO ENACT THIS IDEOLOGY?\nOR MORE HONESTLY,\nAT WHAT POINT DO YOU & YOUR FELLOWS COME TO KILL MY PEOPLE AND \"REDISTRIBUTE\" OUR THINGS?
I'm economically right winged I did find the video informative as often I find that many economic leftists find themselves bouncing back and forth between definitions of these things. I believe properly regulated capitalism will simply benefit mankind more in terms of technology, motivation and overall wealth. \n\nWe should be a society that discourages welfare abuse perpetuated by able bodied people. The least amount of people on welfare and the more working the more revenue we get to invest in infrastructure, technology and medical advances. Socialist countries seemingly have provided nothing to the world except cuban cigars and misery. \n\nThe reasons many people become socialist or communist is not always because they want free shit, but because they see people struggle. I believe these problems can be fixed in a capitalist society if addressed properly. In some cases welfare might be needed and can save us some money too. An example would be looking at homelessness figuring out if it's a mental health issue or drug addiction issue then provide the service. Reducing the need for more police judges ect. \n\nThat is just an example and we need to know the potential benefits to see if it's worth it or if we need to keep looking at different ideas.
This guy IS A DUMBASS
I hope you die commie
Scandinavia is about 50% socialist. This is simply because the total tax on the money from when it enters your wallet to when it's in someone elses is about 50%, in other words, government controls about 50% of the means of production. Capitalism is also not antisocialist inherently, it is only against socialism involving violence.
All -isms, all ideologies, be it capitalism, socialism, libertarianism, anarchism, liberalism or nationalism, prevent Lucidity.\n\nAll beliefs, religions, traditions, philosophies, opinions, perspectives, theories, prevent Lucidity.\n\nThey act like a filter, which limits, distorts, shapes and colors all perceptions.\n\nTherefore, your brain never Perceives anyone or anything as it actually is.\n\nMoreover, they invent the illusion of division, separation, and disconnection between the me and the not me, which breeds conflict, violence, and suffering.\n\nSee the danger.\n\nThe brain must be Totally Free in order to Perceive what is...the isness, the fact, the act, the actual...what is actually taking place from moment to moment, free of any interpreter or censor.\n\nThen and only then is one capable of actually Living Love, Peace, Joy, Kindness, Goodness, Compassion (Passion for All), Beauty, Creativity, Feeling, ExperiencING, Lucidity, Truth, Wisdom...in Communication, Communion, Relationship with everyone and everything, for the very first time, in each and every moment of daily life.\n\nSo first Inner Total Freedom. Then and only then can there be Outer Total Freedom in the society.\n\nOnly such a brain can usher in a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.\n\nWithout Inner Total Freedom, you will only be moving from one form of tyranny to another form of tyranny, calling it growth, progress, or evolution.
A pathological liar, clearly a Leftist who has no clue what the truth is.
The state doesn't pay for anything. They take tax off you and then use your money to pay for 'free' health care and education. They are basically saving money for people because they are incapable of having savings to pay for health care. In the case of education its a bit different because you can't have a job without education in most cases to pay for it.
Correction: The 'Star Trek' society is most certainly NOT Communist! It fails to meet the criteria on (at least) two counts:\n1) A Communist society is, by definition, moneyless; whilst Star Trek does indeed not use CURRENCY, it does sport MONEY (in both roles as a medium for transactions and for the material storage of intrinsic value) in the form of 'gold-pressed latinum'.\n2) There is absolutely no concept of private property in a Communist society - also by definition; in at least one episode from The Next Generation TV series (e.g. TNG season 4, episode 2 - \"Family\") references are made to Capt. Picard's brother, Robert, and the \"Picard family vineyards\" in northeastern France...\n\nThe very least you could've done, was to do a modicum of research on the claim, rather than simply parroting it over... How disappointing!
Communism is Anarchistic, not the other way around. While most coherent forms of Anarchism are communistic, like Anarcho-Communism and Collectivism, there is Mutualism which is a form of Market Socialism and doesn't fit under Communism.
From your own website: 'Most people agree that capitalism is an unfair system' - RIDICULOUS generalisation! Forced equality is what is not fair!
Your voice is hurts my soul...
Well, I didn't expect to be giving this one a thumbs up.  Nice video, and totally worth the damage it's going to do to my 'suggested video' feed for the foreseeable future.
Accidentally destroyed one of the few pro-socialism arguments at 4:44. If scandinavia isn't socialist, then I can't think of a socialist country that isn't a \"shithole country\".
'explained by a marxist'\nso its in no way a reflection of reality\ngotcha
People think scandinavia is socialist. Whaaaat?
0:57 All paid for by the tax paying citizens
Great video, but I think you should've added a remark stating that originally, the terms Communism and Socialism were interchangeable. Well, at least Marx used the terms  this way. The change on terminology occured much later, inbetween translations and revisions.
What's Venezuela?
I went to this site and... \n\"If you are a worker, then you are not paid your worth. The value that you produce as a worker is worth more than the wage that your boss gives you. Your boss exploits you and your labour for profit - to make money. \" im done with this bullshit
I'm getting my education on economics from Thomas Sowell and Milton Friedman, you can't go wrong if you understand and appreciate what they have to say.
Star trek has crew members of different ranks. One is captain for example. Is that classless or what does classless mean?

Evil Capitalist: \"Whatever will sell the most.\" Cuban parliament: \"Whatever there is a great need for.\" You commies really don't know what markets actually are, do you?
MEGA-MURDERERS try and spot the theme in the idiolagy that commit the most murderers https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MEGA.HTM
Another problem with all the Socialist ideas is it requires the ruling body to have supreme power over the individual and the data show it always leads to death, murder, Kill. The less government the better.  https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WHY.HTM
In those Socialist ideologies I still don't see how it would encourage innovation of new ideas, technology, means of supply or which ideas, tech and means of supply are the best. How would you realistically encourage hard work without being capitalist. How do you stop people being lazy and just not working or being bad at it?
how would you call right wing anarchism where there is no state and everything is privatised, but the society isnt classless?
No matter what name you call yourself, if anyone fall under the \"umbrella term\" \"socialism\", you're getting on your knees and getting shot in the back of your head.
It's funny that you ask about doctors vs janitors at the end of the video.  I'm 80% through by medical training and working as a medical resident in the US.  We make decent wages at this point (about national average, after 8-12 years of college level courses), but we also have a great earning potential when we get through residency.  I was exhausted in the ICU last week and was watching the janitor pushing a bin down the hall, told my wife I felt was fantasizing about being able to go to work for a week without putting in 80 hours of work and still feeling inadequate to the task I was given.  I can assure you that as much as all the resident in my program love our work, if there wasn't a carrot being offered at the end of this very arduous road very few would ever take this path.  \n\nAnd it isn't a simple task of cutting our hours, because we need these 1000's of patient encounters to get sufficiently trained, so cutting back to a 40 hour week, would just make medical school take 8 years and residency 6+ years to train most physicians.  Ultimately I think the system works incredibly well (just look at the phenomenal changes in our word over the last 300 years).  Free markets (Relatively free at least)  and private property are probably the joint sources of the greatest jump in prosperity that humanity has ever known and significantly hampering of either leads to stagnation like in Cuba.
The government does not pay for anything, the taxpayers do.
Anarchism will always lead to capitalism!
I always think of capitalism in Europe as a tidy garden: it has to be pruned and taken care of to bear fruit. Both free market fundamentalism and over regulation stifle growth and competition. But then I've never even read a book on economics.
Pardon me, but the cover image of the video is wrong, Marxism-Leninism is not a part of orthodox marxism, in fact historically it is not only against but its existence is reliant on going against orthodox marxism
Basically, they are all left wing ideologies that kill people.
I think your definition of socialism is too restrictive.  In particular, a society in which the means of production is controlled by workers cooperatives, where membership in a cooperative controlling any given means of production is restricted to all current and retired workers in that means of production would also be a socialist society, although by your definition we would need to deny that.
communism doesn't work because only a few races and cultures think work is fun\n\nall you other fucks belong in a god damn zoo with your ADD \"look at me\" and your jealousy and your \"hay I did a nice thing so I'm going to steal from that guy I was nice to\" \n\nya that's right. work is fun. driving past a building and saying \"hay I remember when I helped build that thing\" is nostalgic. even the fucken girls love it when they see their hairy stinky sweaty man covered in mud and dirt. \n\n \"that guy is working to hard, lets get him!\" is an actual thing https://youtu.be/uylEi6n9yho?t=133 \nso it will never work, it will never happen and you are demonized if you do a little more at work because \"oh this package hasn't ben delivered yet let me just do that real quick, I still got time\" is seen as you getting more attention making the ADD guy sad \n\neven explaining it will not help these creatures understand it's like a beaver talking to a cat
Please, name me one country where communism worked... I'll wait
thank you for this. maybe you should add \"theoretically\" to the bits about cuba being REALLY socialist. and more on the means of achieving the goals described could not hurt
I wouldnt say Sweden and the Scandinavian countries have a small amount of government intervention. The USA has a small amount, Canada has slightly more and the Scandinavian countries have a lot more. Upper tax brackets in the 60-70% range with far more people being taxed at that rate is not what I would call small government intervention.
Differences don't matter all are worthless scum
The government doesn't pay for a damn thing , it is the TAX PAYERS who pay for it . Only one minute into this and you are off on that major of a point ?  Not real hopeful for the rest of it .  Yeah be sure to point out Nazi Germany was a totalitarian regime and ignore the same trait in Cuba and China . Damn , I was hoping for accurate facts . Should have known .
All that matters is the most balanced countries in the world (where happiness index and wealth index are both similarly high) use a hybrid economy known as a surplus economy. basically, resources are used domestically with surplus being exported for profit. This keeps cost of living down, quality of life up and disposable income available to the modal consumer at reasonably high levels. However, it comes with the requirement of successfully managing high income taxes to support public domain infrastructure and other projects. \n\nSuch economies permeate the Nordic nations, which are considerably wealthier than their European neighbours while also maintaining an extremely high level of citizen happiness. No country is perfect of course, and these countries rely on high-demand exports to generate this surplus based profit. Fortunately, such countries have these high-demand exports to work with. It's a nearly perfect blend of socialism and capitalism which has proven to be economically stable without infringing on citizen rights.
2:50 The nazi's said they were socialists. Were they socialists? Not even close. Bad argument for Cuba, they're communists.
They're all the same.. big government maniacs. Sweden and shit is big government idk if you realized but the state is censoring media. That's real socialism and communism in the USSR was real communism. Marxists are all idiots for not learning the mistakes of the past.
This is the least informative video I have ever watched. I could open a dictionary and be better informed. While the author defines the words correctly, he studiously never talks about what socialism really IS: forced equality of outcomes. This idea is the most deadly concept in human history, leading directly to the deaths of 200 million innocent lives in the 20th century.  So let me help you: “Socialism: A doctrine which forces equality of outcome for its followers, by stealing wealth from the most capable and productive citizens and giving it the the least capable and undeserving citizens. This crushes the work ethic of the capable, and makes the incapable even lazier and ungrateful. When the poor run out of other people’s money, the rich are killed to preserve an appearance of equality.” There. I fixed your video. You’re welcome.
hi! Nice video, but i don't think anarchism should be under socialism. Because anarchy implies no government, so it is the opposite of socialism/communism (big government).\n I think of anarchy to be the far right of capitalism no government, no laws, total individual freedom.
*National socialism instensifies*
So what do Sweden, Bernie Sanders, China, Cuba and the Nazis have in common?\n\nThey all violate the NAP
Yeah, but when will you show us socialism's real birth certificate?! /s
Thete is absolutely no difference between any of the brand names for Communism is just a matter of to what extent of deception that one brand wants to use , the British version is Fabian Socialists named after a Roman General who developed his version of warfare with attrition being the means to achieve the end , hence you can see the state of Britain in a permanent state of decay and decline a nation that will never rise from its parlous state until they kill of the Labor Party.
COMMUNISM IS A TEMPORARY SETBACK ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM.
More people have starved to death or been murdered under communism/socialism.
This is literally a bullshit video.  Smoke and mirrors.  Socialism's goal is to create a communist \"uptopia\", which has never been accomplished.  That's why they always end up with dictators or socialist parties (like the Nazis and YES THE FUCKING NAZIS WERE SOCIALISTS YOU NAY SAYING CUNTS so don't even try to argue with me because you will get fucked in that ass with facts).  \n\nNazis were the \"National Socialist German Workers Party.\"  Key word.....socialist.  Socialist is a leftist institution so I find it very interesting that Wikipedia refers to the Nazis as \"far-right.\"  You fucking leftists have been engaging in revisionist history for the last 80 fucking years.  Nobody likes your bullshit so you literally have to deceive people to gain supporters and unlucky for the rest of us there are lot of stupid humans who believe your bullshit.  Basically the choices on the left are left, far left, far far left, and east.
There are flaws to this graph that presently escape me. That said, given the ideas it treats as siginificant (i.e., largely economic ones), it is adequate. A good stepping stone overall.
the upper class don't deliberately depress wages, see: economics. Other than that good vid
Isn't Leninism a form of revisionist marxism as it introduces the idea that the revolution needs a vanguard to get started?
Sexecutive functioning fuck me that's funny
So the brevity version of this video would be.....capitalism is the only one that has produced favorable results for the average joe.
what about cultural marxism?
Totally wrong about anarchism. what about Mutualism, Anarcho Capitalism??  You only Talk about Colectivistic Anarchism. And also, national socialism is still more left than right. they wanted to seize the means of production, replace the class with the race, and make a mutual economy. and they have more left wing fascism like Juche, Strasserism, and National Bolchevism.
What about National Socialism?
Yes but when has a communist state actually succeed with out the deaths of millions
You marxists must think society is so bad that Capitalism is so exploitable and every business is going to enslave their workers and no one would care or just the fact that every business boss/CEOs are evil and as malevolent as Darth Vader himself and wants nothing more than to stuff themselves full of money and being pigs eating donuts and being a greed whore.
In a pure capitalist society competition would rid jobs of poor quality/working conditions.
Capitalists in a pure capitalist society wouldn't have slaves. Why, because that would violate the non-aggression principal. Society wouldn't need a Government to tell people that having a slave is bad, especially in this day and age. So the selling of granny isn't really a capitalist thing it's actually a corporatist thing.
if you see any of the red ones just kill, simple stuff.
left-anarchism is just communism, not actually anarchism
lel, laughed at this.
you are wrong about stating that Anarchism is on the left side. The real theory behind anarchism is no state at all. So that is more lining too the right. Reason why Anarchism and communist can get along is because they are both working on crumbling the ruling state. Both trying to destroy in order to rebuild it with their crazy ideas.
So where are neo marxists then?
So I gotta be honest, you gotta explain more about how Cuba is supposedly democratic.
The only thing I disagree with is the idea that anarchists only exist in a far left format, I'd say a more accurate representation of anarchism would be as a line along the bottom, showing that they can come in multiple economic views but still contain the same basic principles as to what a government is supposed to be
Thank you for this informative video!
money changes everything.
Just wanted to mention this is outdated, Denmark has sold Dong Energy.
Its laughable that you attempt to seperate Socialism into so many different categories but you leave Capitalism as pretty much a monlith. Yet again a communist fails to understand Capitalism.
capitalism still wins
Hey, not about the video but i went to your website and was looking around. I read this example about the three farmers that needed barns and made 1 barn to share it amongst themselves. I understand how that worked but if a fourth person came that needed a barn but did not contribute, shouldn't they charge him for using it? Or how would that work in a communist society(excuse me if i'm confusing terms)?
What about Juche?

Social democracy isn't part of communism, it is always presented with money in the means of trading.
Wouldn’t anarchism fall under capitalism because you would have the freest market of all.
Funny. He thinks Cuba has democracy!
Calling the Federation \"communist\" is pretty mind boggling. By default the name itself states the style of governance. The only thing that the Federation in StarTrek has in common with anything communist or socialist is that it doesn't use money as a medium between goods being exchanged (there are exceptions built into this obviously). They trade goods for goods, but still base the goods traded on an \"objective\" value standard. \n\nThere's even times when the Federation has to trade with other intergalactic participants, in which they then have to use a form of credit currency; which is only so because of the objective value standard.
Good video\nBut It would have been great if you you went more into detail on capitalism. \nFor example, free market capitalism and regulated capitalism

Thanks, Im a populist...
Cuba is state capitalist- not communist
i really believe you skipped anarchism like this, bc you don't understand it. yes it has a big focus on community BUT LACKS an all ruling central government. this is basic political education. i don't believe you have read any texts by Proudhon, am i right?
no nononon NO. NO. \nAnarchism is just as far away from socialism as socialism from capitalism. socialism IS DEFINED by a strong ruling government/leader. which anarchism is not in the slightest. \nyou need two axis to define and seperate the 4 major theories of socialism, conservatism, economic liberalism and anarchism
Your German is pretty good
Good video with that being said... THE ONLY GOOD COMMUNIST IS A DEAD COMMUNIST!!!
6+ millions lives lost is what youre defending.
Labels, labels, labels. Your distinction that divides socialism from capitalism seem to be a bright-line separating state ownership from private ownership of the means of production. This is an erroneous historical distinction manufactured by the competing the propaganda campaigns of the USSR and the USA during the Cold War, since in most socialist schools of political thought the driving motivation behind socialism is to free people from oppression based in race, gender and class, and the mode of that liberation is arbitrary.
Good video. With regards to your \"90% is private industry\" figure... I'd be inclined to judge this using Government Spending vs GDP figures. Most European nations come out at about 50%. Cuba is up at 78%. Ironically, the USA is at moderately high at 35%, but that's likely accounted for by an enormous Treasury and Defence budget. Perhaps an argument that the US economy is not too dissimilar to that of China in terms of spending and taxation...
But anarchy is the capitalist utopia,  everything is based purely on goods and profit
This was pretty accurate.  I would've called them anarchist communists rather than just anarchists to avoid conflating this flavor of anarchism with the general ideology.
All governments are capitalist. International trade doesn't work otherwise.
Please tell me you're not a trotskyist.. I might have found a new favourite channel of mine tonight! (^.^)\n\nEdit: The video is wonderful, anyway! VEEEERY well done.

The difference between socialist and capitalist is that one has food
1) The Nazis DID centrally plan large portions of their economy.  It wasn't formally centrally planned, but co-ops and other arrangements allows the fascists to tell factories what to make, and any other details they wanted.  These were just \"suggestions\", but you don't disobey suggestions from a fascist govt.  For obvious reasons.  Yes, the factory et al was OWNED privately, and could exercise control where the govt did not create a mandate, but it's a HUUUGE stretch to call it a market economy. \n\nIt was a partially planned economy where the political class could orchestrate what they wanted (usually more guns etc) and could supply slave labor and mandate that sellers would accept the government's worthless IOUs in lieu of money (because again, otherwise you will be on the next cattle car out of town).  But the political class could leave the details on \"how\" up to the factory owner.  This is why it's not entirely inaccurate when the Nazis called themselves socialist.  They weren't all socialist, but they deserve to be considered a subcategory in your graph that wedges between Social Democracy and Socialism.\n\n2) Cuba is not democratic in any meaningful way.  Like many dictatorships they have a democratic FORM, but there's no actual choice or control exerted by the people.\n\nBut other than those two complaints, this is the best description of this I've ever seen.  I've tried to explain this sort of stuff via prose or speech and I've never been as satisfied with my explanation as I am with yours.  It was clear and concise and complete and acknowledged the confusion and vagueness that follows these terms due to the fact that there are so many groups pulling in different directions.  Well done.

Excellent work. I think it makes sense to define socialism as \"government control over economy\" as opposed capitalism with private sector/investors. No country is purely either but \"public sector ratio of GDP\" gives a some kind of estimate. The high taxation and wellfare state makes Scandinavian countries somewhat socialist (~55%), but then again so does the government paid the military industrial complex make US \"moderately socialist\" (~38%).\n\nhttps://medium.com/rational-zone/why-calling-scandinavia-socialist-is-wrong-37c873314839

What about National Socialism?
Hello, \nI'm wondering if you can also  do a similar video but then on capitalism? I know for example that there are also people that call themselves anarco-capitalistic. I think it would be really interesting to extend this video with different capitalistic ideas. This will create even more value.\nThanks!
fact 1: we're always going to want people creating companies like Microsoft, Nasa, Tesla, SpaceX, etc... to advance human civilization. fact 2: money, everything it literally represents, in its form of power, must exist for such causes. fact 3: they can't exist in the socialist world of snowflake \"fairness\" utopia. we're not all equal. so if you're not actually against the power houses of humanity (the places that actually contribute to humanity, and even cure diseases) what's your purpose in taking away the system that allows them to exist then?\n\nif we're all going to be equal, society is going to be run by the average human, and then bam. we're all in idiocracy land. we need lots of imaginary money in the right hands to produce computers and rockets and everything. it's just what makes the world function. the motivation is the money. it's not like people are just jerks, and they're ultimately doing their profession \"just for the money\". people need to get paid somehow. and if they are worthy enough to do magnificence, they'll earn their money, and stick to it. so if you want the same exact prospects to exist, what would be the point in any of this?\n\nare you on the social inequity side or capital fairness side?\ndo you think Janitors should earn as much as Doctors?\nthat everybody should be $1 richer, at the cost of there being no chance for nasa or microsoft to exist. (rich enterprises)\n\nplease anybody reading, let us know your opinion.
And when politicians miss-use these terms and the majority of the voters don't understand what they mean, well... I'm sure anyone reading can fill in the rest.
I'm getting tired of the \"Nazi free market\" meme. No, no it didn't. The economy was controlled by the government, as was every other aspect of public and private life. That it was not directly controlled by ministries of state(although it often was) does not mean it was not controlled by the state. It was. It was specifically controlled by the exact will of the party.\n\nTo paraphrase Himmler the goal of the Nazi party was not to socialize the economy, but to socialize the individual. To make every aspect of public and private life geared towards the benefit of the nation - hence National Socialism. Nazi Germany was socialist in all ways - down to the redistribution of wealth and politics of \"class struggle\".\n\n\"Private enterprise\" in China is not much different. All of the \"private companies\" in China proper are, in the end, Government property under lease - even the actual homes of their employees are \"public property\" under lease.\n\nP.S.: Your characterization of Cuba is misleading to say the least. It's a fun kind of \"democracy\" that's been jumping from wealthy, authoritarian dictator to wealthy, authoritarian dictator while the common people live in poverty.\n\nEdit: I like that you didn't include Fascism and National Socialism in your graph under Socialism. You can't bash the fash if the fash is you, right?
There is no democracy in Cuba, the community does not equal the State and the legislative institutions doesnt decide anything.
could thump you  thump stop  thump the  thump  thumping  thump every  thump time  thump you  thump speak.
Sanders has never claimed that the Scandinavian countries were socialists.  He's always been very clear that they're Democratic Socialist, which is a different thing.  Also, the government of Cuba is not communist in any way.  Under communism, the state is supposed to wither away and die (basically the libertarian wet dream).  Cuba still has a strong central government, so they're not there yet.
Simple \nCapitalism the poor pay the RICH \nSocialism is where the government Taxs the RICH \nTo pay FAT WELFARE \n.You choose which country \nYou want  .\nIf your a woman or lazy \nSocialism is the place you want to be \n\nIf you a white smart hard working man .then capitalism is for you
There is little difference between capitalism and Communism. The means of production and distribution is controlled by a central authority. Only a very small part of so called capitalist countries are actual capitalists.
Only americans confuse what is meant by socialism.. in the cuntland heartland of Trumpland the hilbilly deplorables use words like communist, socialist and muslim as pejoratives...\nThey are not smart people who have interest in the meaning of words, the spoken truth or facts, or learning.\n\nHaving said that... it should be clear to anyone that when Bernie says he is a socialist.. he means he believes in a Capitalist system but with an expansive welfare system...\nHe believes all education should be free.  \nAll healthcare should be free.\nAlso im favour of various forms of benefits for the working class.\n\nMany hillbillys from Cuntland would say \"but its not free, we have to pay for it\"... as if they just found out how taxes work.\n\nThe working class in USA voted for a billionaire that filled his cabinet with Goldman Sachs and gave themselves tax cuts worth billions.\nThey also cut the money for \"wheels on meals\", did their best to try and cut medicare.
Very good explanation, however it didn’t cover the nuances of capitalism. There is free market capitalism and croney capitalism, a variant of fascism. Most people see the unfairness of businesses using political and regulatory force to favor and protect it from competition. \nFree market capitalism is the most efficient system of producing goods and services for everyone’s benefit. It is difficult to maintain free markets, businesses will instinctively use political means to eliminate competition.
The German Reich was Authoritarian not Totalitarian like the USSR
Now explain Fascism
Can add Chinese characteristic in the chart?
You talk about Cuba as if the people actually ran the government and had democratic elections. Its obvious you dont know a damn thing about the country given that the people there are constantly squandered for wanting to do good things. There is no democracy. Nothing is run ir distributed by \"the people\". It's run by the Castro mob, and that's it. Nothing more.
Excellent distinctions
The thing about social democracy at least originally was to achieve a communist state, but not through revolution as Marx would've had it, but through the democratic process.
Cooperativism is the closest way of socialism...
all land in china is owned by the state you just have to sign a 70 year lease
I liked that you mentioning that Anarchists and Marxists can co-operate toward the common goal of communism. Really warms my heart.  Would be nice to have socialist state where the de-facto Marxist vanguard regime and individual anarchist communes weren't pointing guns at each other. I maybe came off as sounding snarky, but that wasn't my intention. I truly feel what I said.
Communism is fucking gay shit
I know what I need to about all 3 they are evils and a danger to civilization.
Chinese billionaires are allowed to joint the communist party, pay no taxes and receive socialist-state sponsored subsidies in order to crash foreign capitalists. put that into the pie chart!
The difference is that they're all pure shit and you're a fucking moron.
Maybe you could have detailled more on the capitalistic side. disliking them does not prevent from knowing them, in my opinion.
you act as if capitalism doesnt support workers interests too. if somebody doesnt like working somewhere, they will try to leave. Workers rights are why unions exist. (However, unions operate most efficiently if they are run by each private enterprise, and not a corporate union) A business is nothing without employees who respect it. If someone thinks a company is mistreating them, it will usually negatively affect said company in the short term (in the grand scheme, an immoral company will struggle until they obtain an ethical system of employment). So no, businesses run under a capitalistic system aren’t as un-ethical as you think they are.
This wasn't biased at all... lol
Only the fact that socialism is separated in so many subcategories show us that is a lie. Complete bullshit. Like religions.
I have always considered Communism to be the goal of Socialist states, because that's what the Socialists always say, at least in the case of the Soviets. Therefore I think a valid way to look at it is to reverse the location of Socialism and Capitalism. I also don't think Capitalists are anti Socialism, capitalists are actually libertarian, they just want to be left alone by the state, not to control it nor to be controlled by it- a state controlled by the wealthy is an oligarchy, not a capitalist state, and has been the result of both capitalist and communist ideologies time and again in history.
Finally someone who makes a video explaining wtf all these are without trying to shove an ideology down my throat! Keep up the work I more then likely disagree with you on many policies but am glad to see people like you exist!
Really good video with great explanations and very well presented. I really did learn quite a lot from these rather difficult and confusing terms. Great job, and thank you. Just one minor issue: you spelt 'nature' wrong at 10:50! Careless! :-D
Socialism 3:25 Communist society: 5:30 Social democracy 7:43
Mutch to complicated.\nSocialism, Commuism and Marxism are all the same and simply mean any social state spending i dont like.\nThat is important because in democracies all parties like to give social spending gifts to their constituency to get elected. Which is a waste of money. The money belongs to social spending to the benefit of our constituency and so this foolish waste of money must be effectivly called out!\n\n(Not to be confused with Facism and Nazism, which is any state intervention i dont like. Take away my guns? Nazism! Tell me who and what i can make love to? Facism!)
Nice try, but no. \n\nHow can Maoism, Hoxhaism and Castroism be included under classical Marxism when they are just variants of Stalin’s/Bukharin’s socialism-in-one-country which rejected Marx’s internationalism?  That’s a fundamental difference that is easy to explain. \n\nThe definitions also make little sense without addressing the class analysis in the different categories.
China calls itself communist because it has a communist government with a leader who serves for life, Cuba is communist with a dictator, Nazi Germany had a Totalitarian dictatorship that was also Fascism that killed 6 million Jews and no one is suggesting for Janitors to get paid as much as Doctors, I mean you also mention that in theory it does work and in practicality right now the U.S. is doing well not so great
What is it called then, when you feel the income disparity is out of control, when food companies are putting unhealthy additives in our food to make it last longer, when you feel wall st. got us into a terrible recession and could do it again?
you forgot one.\nnational socialism
Socialist state = socialism\nsocialism =/= socialist state\nSocialism is a category. Socialist states are a specific instant and type of it. Not all socialism is a socialist state. Weak.
Death to Socialism/Communism/Marxism!!! It destroyed South America!
Places where people have the right to (relatively) freely make exchanges with each other are called \"capitalist\" now... Places that call themselves \"socialist\" heavily restrict what contracts and property citizens may have. Such restrictions strangle welfare increases over time. Appreciate the video, but vote for freedom.
The only people that don't seem to get this is our  \"college intellectuals\". Go capitalism.
My brain hurts
Technically they are Socialist ( Democratic Socialists, and Social Democrats), as socialism is now a very very broad term
Wouldn’t anarchism be on the far right, as government involvement becomes less and less prevalent throughout the spectrum?
So a socialist state basically has to figure out what businesses should be funded by the state as a whole and what businesses should be individually ingested? Real question I'm not too sure
I've learner a whole lot, thank you for the educational video!
h a m m e r   a n d   s i c k l e    i n t e n s i f i e s
Well... Now i am even more confused than before. I just know that there is no real communism in the world and only one truely Socialist country
2:38 *WORKERS'
As a dane i find it amusing you mark \"Dong energy\" as state owned (4:25)\nIt once was but was sold off to Goldmann Sachs some years ago
The graphic with the boxes was verry clear, thanks for clearing things up, for me at least.
While far from an expert, I received an honors degree in Economics, and I don't agree with your definition of Socialism. Socialism is government control of the ways, means and distribution of production. Communism is the evolution of government control into the control by the commune (the people). It isn't a subset of Socialism, but the higher level of economics. America under Obama was Socialist. Trump is trying to slow the decent into Socialism. The only place Communism has ever existed is in a religious community, and even that has the direction from a hierarchy.
All branches off the same tree.
Pretty sure CCCP called themselves communists
What about Stalinism?
marxist cuck swede, fucking flagged
you left out the ~270 million people who were murdered last century by their own various flavors of socialist governments. it's a pretty common theme among them too.
Here is all you need to know about this:\nSocialism = Marxism = Communism = Shit. Any questions?
I'm gonna be an edgelord and say that my bullets can't tell the difference between members of said groups.
Communism is the best ideology
I find the description of anarchism as a bit troubling. While in this context it is somewhat accurate it’s still very misleading to anyone who doesn’t know what anarchism actually is.
Democratic socialism ftw
I just went to your website and a lot of your presumptions, or presupisisitions about capitalism are simply wrong. If you want to represent it well I would suggest consulting economists instead of phylosophers. Thomas soul has a great book called Basic Economics that I would recommend as a primer. Also any serious argument beginning with \"most people agree\" detracts from your credibility instead off adding to it.
“To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers, have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.”\n-Thomas Jefferson, letter to Joseph Milligan, April 6, 1816\n\nBasically, you don’t punish the successful for the unsuccessful, which is Social Democracy. This is why America isn’t Europe. \n\nAnd really, European countries can’t really be compared to America for a simple reason, history. European countries (that have either been on the positive side of war, or who haven’t been ravaged by the effects of communism) have more historical wealth than the U.S for the nations are much older. America, started with nothing and became the wealthiest nation in the world in a manner of less than 200 years. \n\nOne more point: I’ve never seen a Socially Democratic nation who’s government,  hasn’t overstepped it’s economical boundaries and changed the fabric of the nations society through government implementation. \n\nEnding conclusion: government has too much unchecked power. If that’s how they do it in Europe, that’s fine, but America wasn’t founded on that.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the teaching of your video
As most, you mistake Capitalism with Liberalism and Ultra-Liberalism.\n\nCommunism is a whole package for a society (Political solution, Economic solution, Social solution etc.)\n\nCapitalism however is just a really Simple economic tool. And you should not make direct comparision between the two it makes no sense.\nAs simple as it is, Capitalism is also really efficient. The problem with simple tools is that they can easily be hacked. And the only problem with it is that currently the model that dominate Capitalism is the anglo-saxon model (Libertarian or Ultra-liberalist if you prefer). Something that can be totally corrected by government regulations.\n\nHere's the difference, In a free country (free from the total economic dictact of the government), you can do whatever you want as economic model for your company, whether it is capitalist with shareholder or not, use of banks, etc. but also INCLUDING social or communist inspired business like a cooperative. Something you cannot do in Communists system.\n\n\nNow regarding Liberalism there's a lot of confusion, initially Liberalism as social roots too. but the outcome is at the opposite of the communism excess.\n- The only true Liberalist Nation is France, Why? I'm French, and we literally invented the concept. The thing that people miss about ideology like this is that it come with a reflection/philosophy which is deeply rooted in a culture.\n\nSo in short our country's devise \"Liberty, egality, Fraternity\" is the incarnation of the Liberalist philosophy for our society.\n1) The Government should never prevail above individual Freedom, (the Liberty part),\n2) This individual freedom to work in a society, is only possible if not total but somewhat limited to not deny other citizens their own Freedom. Basically you cannot threaten other people's Freedom... by Killing them for exemple. (The Egality part)\n3) Finally this can work only if people respect the rules and play the game and therefor respect and support each other as citizens (The fraternity part).\n\nAmericans took the definition of it word to word (Basically they stopped at step 1 from above) which gave Ultra-liberalism, now called Libertarianism a deformed vision of it. The new US Leftists reclaiming it now under the socialist point of view are also missing the point. As well Economic Liberalism, as Nothing to do with real Liberalism, Liberalism is made for Citizens, and Economic Liberalism is made for the Businesses...\n\n-Ultra-Liberalism (Libertarianism) is an extreme that dismiss most implication of any government's influences. It is a ridiculous vision not applicable for a real structured society (idealism not taking in account the reality of a state), that many americans believe for a simple reason: They actually experienced it during the pionneer, Wild west era.\n\n-Communism is the extreme opposition to that (and as stupid), Full government control (Totalitarism), the group prevail over the individuality, communism fail by not understanding that the individual human and It's entropic nature will Always go against uniformity and establishment (Because again It's an idealism, not taking in account reality, trying to force it by control)\n\nHowever true Liberalism, is in between at the center. Because it is about moderation and understanding the balance between the need of people as indivuduals and the group they form together as a state and their common interest.\n\n\nBut yeah otherwise capitalism Under control is a great tool, (and the only one that prove to hold on the long run) which for exemple is used by NGOs in small communities in Africa to rise their level of life.
You didn't explain capitalism or even the goal of socialism. Why must the state or community own the means of production?
So the whole thing is based on the idea that human nature can be circumvented by utopian idealism.\n\nLULZ
Even though I don't like Marxism at the very least, you are very well informed and stick closely to facts, presenting them very professionally. We need more people like you on both sides in order to have actual conversations again.
Communism, socialism, marxism. They are all subcategories of collectivism. Their sucess is an impossibility. An idea born to fail. The world has no room for this idiocy.
The people vote in Cuba.  For who!?  A wet teddy bear, and stick of gum, and the head of the communist party.  Bruh, you’re so full of shit.
When you were explaining Cuba, with regard to income, you put the words “as high as possible”.  At that moment I knew you were full of shit.  When Castro died his net worth was $900 million according to Forbes.  It’s not hard to tell for he lived a very extravagant lifestyle.
In other words collectivism.
communism unchecked is 1984. capitalism unchecked is the purge
Correction. Donald Trump talks a lot about Gina, not China.
Nazis, communists, socialists, Marxists, whatever you want to call yourself is irrelevant, you're all bunch of murderous degenerates, who just want to kill and enslave others. The 100+ million dead bodies caused by your politics prove it.
I wouldn't place social democracies on the capitalism side of the chart. It belongs rather in between them because it's a mixture of capitalism AND socialism. The state takes so much money from the companies and citizens to realize its socialist projects but allows private enterprises. So it doesn't belong fully on one side, rather in between.
but otherwise the video is good even tho ure political view is evil you kept it out of the video pretty good
funny that he calls Norway a social democratic country even tho its the conservative (Right party) and the libertarian (progress party) party that is in power, and Norway is a marked economy and some can say mix economy, its more of an Social libertarian!\nand another thing is that he says Sweden, Bernie Sanders, China and NSDAP has nothing in common even tho alot of Bernies economic policys have alot in common with the NSDAP.
Should've added Keynesianism too
Hmm. Should I go with the side that has been revised over a dozen times or should I go with the side that has never needed to be revised? Should I go with the side that has failed every time it's been implemented or should I go with the side that has had massive economic growth and success every time it was implemented? Such hard choices to make...
Now I understand the de-whitening of Africa.
Great video, and your website is hilarious. It's like watching Alex Jones where he just says what he believes and is driven entirely by ideology with no regard to the actual facts on the ground. Thanks for the explanation though
All socialists are wannabe communists.\nAccording to your video (and marxism), Socialism is a path on the road to world domination of socialism, otherwise called communism.\n\nCommunism has never existed because world domination (statelessness) has never existed.\n\nAll of it is species repugnant because we are social mammals, not social insects.\nWe are closer to our offspring than to our brood sisters.\nHence we are individual, personal property identifying, freeloader despising organisms.
There are so many things wrong with this video that it would take me hours to explain it.
Democratic socialism doesn't really exist! The left just made that bullshit term up to brain wash the easily swayed idiots! Also communism is classless? Yeah.... history proved that theory wrong! Also anarchist are not socialists!
you made it quite obvious you are a socialist of some form
Socialism = Marxism = Nazism = Leftisim. They all believe that the State is supreme, and the individual is subordinate. In other words, you have two classes of individuals. The ruling class, and the peasant class, and laws apply only to the peasants. Some pigs are simply more equal than others!  All governments that claim to look out for the welfare of the peasant class (the poor) will inevitably enslave the masses.
Anarchy is a form of Communism!? Are you high?
Cool video, socialism has always failed and it always will. Stealing from someone just because they have more money than you is greedy and wrong.
Its all just a cover story for dictatorship.  If you think about it, it's \"Intelligent Design\" applied to the economy.  Tell that to a Lefty.  Also, the body count is up to somewhere between 100 and 130 million.
Please go to fuckmysister.com for frequently asked questions about how me fucking my sister is not a bad idea.
You do understand socialism is evil right?
That's the most misplaced anarchism I've ever seen.
I can explain Socialism in very few words: \"We think people should be their for one another, but because we don't believe in a society that raises their kids along those values and don't trust people to do good on their own accord (because their is no intensive to do so) we force them to do it by state measures!\"
The means of production were also largely owned by the state in Communist China and Nazi Germany ,as they were in the Soviet Union which was left out of this video for some reason.
Disliked because you are a marxist! Go back to soviet china you dumb commie
What does socialism, communism and Marxism and even facism  all have in common - they are all on the left of the political spectrum to varying degrees and all are totalitarian. The only difference is a matter of degree on the Left.
You'll go blind if you keep jerking off to Abby Martin videos.
I love it how you had a drone behind Obama’s head lololol awesome.
Can we add the death toll due to each ideology? It's kinda improtant to determine which idology truely sucks
Social Democracy in my opinion is the greatest form of economics. America should seriously take notes on scandanavia. Most people don't like bernie because they think he is a socailist and they always bring up the same argument: \"Socailism works in the beginning but the economy always plummets.\" Well Bernie Sanders is a social Democrat! All Bernie haters should watch this video!
ok liberal
I recommend this to anyone confused on left fiscal ideology. I disagree with it however it's a step closer to Synthesism
What would I be if, for example, I'd want the means of production and exchange to be (mostly) free, but in a classless society with equal income (possibly taking money out of the equation altogether later down the line)?
I read your website, I wanted to tell you:  fuck you asshole
WE NEED COMMUNISM
10:48 But... it does indeed go against human nature.
@2:25 \"No, you can't sell your grandmother for profit.\" What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like suggestion that you can do it in other systems? In capitalism you can't sell something you don't own, in communism the state can take everything it wants from you. Just saying.\n\nUpdate: ROTFL, just read the full title \"explained by marxist\" ROTFL, explains everything. Whole video is just a big fat lie. Distorting reality and whitewashing killers of millions. You're a waste of time. Bye.
Akually that wasn't REAL communism
no. Trotskyism is revisionism
Cuba isn’t a democratic country. The castros have ruled it for 60 years with an iron hand. Plus we see how well socialism, that what the Cubans call there system work for them. In fact the ussr also call themselves socialist. Once again we see how well it turn out for them
Love me a big slab of social democracy
Sweden's going to be a third world country by 2035 \n\n1. http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2014/April/Soviet-Sweden-Model-Nation-Sliding-to-Third-World\n\n2. http://www.speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.454/sweden-to-become-a-third-world-country-by-2030-according-to-un.html
This is a pretty good summary
socialism = authoritarianism lite\nCommunism = hard core authoritarianism\nMarxist = someone who has never read Karl Marx
This is wrong in so many levels! Socialism=workers are in power. Capitalism=rich are in power. Free Markets=consumer is on power trough consumption
Community is not the same as the state. A farm can be owned by the local community of farmers. This is not the same as the govt owning it
Du er en stygg svenske. lol
Star Trek Federation is not a Communist State (Hollywood fiction by communists/Socialist).\nIt has the Federation Credit (monetary value - electronic payments - no paper cash) as lots of shows including TNG first episode showed trade by fingerprint payments (charge to the Ship). Why trade? especially if you are not going to get paid. Many Federation Citizens create wealth by trading outside of the Federation using various monetary currency and trade that for Federation Credit.  Who would want to trade cargo ship for days, weeks and months, or do the worst of jobs, if you can stay at home or do a nicer job and get the same pay???? Why have a job at all if you can get everything for free..\n\nAlso the Federation is a State. It is not State less. Its members are states. Like the EU and it member states. Classless means equal power. The Federation members do have classes. the Ruling class (Politicians - power), the Star Fleet officers (power to arrest and order you about) and the peasants (no power). The higher the class, the higher the power in society. So the Federation fails on all three. \n\nThe Definition of communism (stateless, Money-less, and class-less) is flawed and only really works on a person of One. You cannot be unequal to yourself, you cannot use money with yourself and you are classless in comparison to yourself. Only equal drones are all three. Even twins can differ over time. One become more dominate over the other.
Communists State, Highest wages possible!! LOL \nTime for a reality bash. Most Cuban Doctors (except plastic surgeons) earn a high Communist pay of $50 dollars a month. Yes that right a Communists Doctors earns $50 Dollars (not an hour, but ) a month.\nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article89133407.html\n<quote>\nThe survey, which was conducted among 1,067 Cubans in Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Cienfuegos in May and June, found that about 27 percent of Cubans earn under $50 per month; 34 percent earn the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month; and 20 percent earn $101 to $200. Twelve percent reported earning $201 to $500 a month; and almost 4 percent said their monthly earnings topped $500, including 1.5 percent who said they earned more than $1,000.\n\nThe remainder of respondents declined to state their income, and Rose said the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n</quote>
can you do the same but for fascism and capitalism? i find the far right even more confusing than the left
I would suggest reading ANY of Antony Sutton on Socialism of many forms. Your explanation was entertaining. Needs more research.
You can never reach the Marxist ideal of a Communist state as following the revolution you can never get past the Socialist state under a Central Dictatorship. Too much power to give away by the few who consider themselves more equal than others. It all goes wrong after the first day following revolution.
Bernie was a step in the right direction, he should have won.
socjalism is socjalism, doesnt work always
U stupid commie fuck how dare u say that anarchist can’t be on the right side of the spectrum
But why should we belive that you arent obscuring the truth if you are a marxist, let a nazi explain why nazism it good, see if you belive him
You're obviously a communist. China is not capatilstic at all, the control everything. Socialism is pretty much the same as communism, also you can't tell me that I don't know anything about this, I read the communist manifesto(it sucked) and they said that socialism will always become communism. And saying that Cuba gives power to their people is bullshit. When you mentioned Star Trek as communist than you are full of shit, that is the goal of fascism to rid itself of money. Anarchism is right winged, no rules. Once again in the communist manifesto karl marx said that there will be leaders in the state, not everyone is equal, atleast through these two positions. Everything you said is bullshit and infactual.
I needed that??haven’t heard such horse crap in a long time my friend! Pray do tell.... what the hell kind of drugs are you currently taking?
very good and accurate exept for the part about cuba being demoratic. that is not true
Think about the definition of \"democratic socialism\", hard. Its the smae system cuba has just regular socialism.
Well nordic countries tax there citizns 50% of ther income.
Really enjoyed the video, great to see  factual stuff with no opinions thrown in. I also had a read through your website. Your opinions on capitalism and labour economics are completely wrong. Capitalists don't shrink wages to absorb more profit, they do so to remain globally competitive. If a capitalist is to shrink wages too low the marginal product of labour will fall, reducing profits. Your arguments against capitalism only hold when the market is experiencing failure, for example unnatural monopolies. In a competitive market none of the assumptions of high profits, labour exploitation, or capitalists being rich, hold. The argument that money is limited and therefore can only expand to a finite number  is completely incorrect and shows 0 understanding of how the money supply is dictated. As argued by yourself money has no actual value, but is socially constructed. Money is a form of liquid asset and the value is relative to the supply which is affected by the investment-savings equilibrium. Furthermore, implying that increasing production by prioritising production of socially positive goods such as basic commodities will better the average person is also blatantly incorrect. At high levels of product dis-economies of scale will cause production costs to rise, making basic commodities more expense. As can be seen in Venezuela. The supply of labour is beyond the size at which an economy can produce its own goods at equilibrium employment. For each unit of labour an extra unit of capital times the advancement of technology determines the labour curve. To provide cheaper commodities at higher productivity the technological advancement must increase at a rate equal to the aggregate demand (literally impossible). The assumptions made on your website are economically incorrect and do not abide to basic laws of economics (that remain constant despite the system). If you truly want to further your understanding, I would recommend Macroeconomics by Robert J. Gordon.
Difference between Fascism and Nazism
Awesome video!\nYet me myself as socialdemocrat cant really see how Socialdemocracy is part of Revisionist Marxism. Could you explain that a bit more or show me some source on that?\nMaybe some video on Socialdemocracy even?
My problem with socialism is that it seems like it would stifle innovation. Of course socialist countries can innovate, but profit incentives definitely seem to be better overall when it comes to inspiring innovation. If a socialist could counter this argument that would be appreciated.\n(And please don't use the \"but the pharmaceutical industry\" argument. Yes, the American pharmaceutical industry puts out slightly modified versions of existing drugs, but that is largely due to the FDA, and I don't think anyone would argue that we should have an unregulated drug industry)
Aint a dame thinge
So what the fuck
About janitors and doctors, here, in post-soviet Russia they are paid pretty much the same. Also teachers get paid like janitors too.
Thank you for the video. But you need to make clear one assumption in the definition of socialism: community = state.
Nazis didn't call themselves socialist. It was a stem from the workers party that turned to the Nazi party from the ideology of Nazism which is a form of Fascism. That's like saying the people's democratic republic of Korea is actually a democracy
What's the difference between social democracy and social liberalism?
\"Things they don't teach you at school\"
1:00 it not paid for by the govt. it paid by the taxpayers.
Cool another Swede
What about captalism? Are there any subdivisions? You could add that to the scheme.
Please make a capitalism one, like free trade, anarcho-capitalism, corporativism and why capitalism just exist with Laissez Faire
What is statism
Saying that China's society has \"some government intervention\" is quite an understatement.
Just FYI the government pays for nothing...people's taxes pays for everything the government is supposed to spend. When programs   cost more then the feds take in they borrow. Nothings is free
The differences between Luxembourgism and Trotskyism compared to Maoism I think are important, I would refrain from saying they're really similar
Germany was fascist.
China is similiar to NSDAP
Fucking thank you
This video didnt explain shit
Why can't communists drive manual cars?\nCos they keep Stalin.\n\nHow did the communist pass his exam?\nHe got full Marx.
3:58 i see what you did there
When AI is gonna take over jobs some kind of socialism is gonna be needed. Or else there will be few power controllers and the rest will be slaves.
Didn't know you were a fellow Gothenburger
Thank you for this video. I can't believe how many people get these simple concepts wrong. I can perfectly accept that not everyone knows what separate Leninism, Maoism, etc, but Socialism and Communism should be pretty straight forward.\n\nMuch of the public political discourse is absolutely unbearable, because people throw terms around with no respect for their definition. This especially true whenever people map a multi-dimensional political \"compass\" onto the left-right axis. How many times have I not had to argue with someone over whether it's fair to call anti-immigration / pro-border control a \"right wing\" trait, or of it's fair say something vague like \"well your politics are already implemented in Venezuela\" whenever ANY socialist argues for ANYTHING remotely socialist.\n\n Myself, being considerably more in favor of capitalism, cannot stand the intellectual laziness of what I perceive to be most people, politicians, youtubers, workers, capitalists, socialists, and so forth. No matter how you identify yourself, possessing a solid understanding of the political terms used in daily life, in the broad sense, is desirable, because it enables you to accurately direct your criticism, and avoid looking like an idiot, when someone points out your mistakes, overshadowing whatever point you may have had, valid or not.
Have to point out a huge mistake in the video. Anarchism was initially developed alongside communism but to call it a branch of communism or to present it as such is false. The divide between the movements started as early as the Bakunin_Marx split and the rift has only grown through the years. Generally the main differenciation is that anarchists seek to abolish authoritarian institutions entitely while communists seek to replace them with ones that can support their ideal society. However as both ideologies have diversifyied, even the simplest categoristion, they evade. Modern anarchism has a number of such diviations that even break the conventional connection to socialism, esspessially individualists or anarcho_capitalists. Even amongsts the socialist anarchists there are the collectivists then there are anarcho_communists and progressive_anarchists. Communism is of course similarly divided. One last specification would be that communists often enough refer to themselves as far left while anarchists tend to dispense with the whole left_right concept, or, situationally declare as belonging to the least authoritarian of the two. And since I cleared these up, let me also add that anarchism litteraly translates to \"no authority\" but there is no corelation between an anarchy as one would refer to an anarchist society and an anarchy as a society of barbarism and disorder.
Your video was very needed, thank you
I feel like diversity prevents societies from becoming less individualistic and more socialist. Not necessarily because of racism or prejudice, but more because when society is more homogeneous people feel more like they're helping a neighbor or brother or friend rather than a complete stranger.
Nazi Germany did not have a free market
So what type of Marxist are you?
He didn't define Marxism at all
When robots and AI take over the job market we better be socialist's or we would be slaves for \"basic income\"
Hello comrades
Confusing but very much thank you for making this
I'm writing this \"blind\" (not taking a moment to explore more of your videos), so be kind in your response. You REALLY should do a video about Rosa Luxemburg and her version of (what you call) orthodox Marxism.
You are wrong.
WAIT YOU LIVE IN GÖTEBORG???
Why is anarchism on the socialism side lmfao
Anarcho-primitivism all the way
Star Treks 24th century still has a economy
If anarchism is just a brand of communism, why would the father of anarchism argue that \"communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak?\"
You should have made a circular schematic, in order to fit in the anarcho-capitlists / voluntarists.
Big problem with the argument at around 4:00. Cuba is no more socialist by definition than capitalist countries. Your statement is that by indirectly voting for the government which controls the economy, the community does. The same could be said about capitalism, just the means of indirectly influencing is by market forces of supply and demand. Also, are the people who privately own the means of production not a subset of society?
Great video
The statement \"the people control the companies through the state\" sounds out right scary to me but hey whatever you want.
The USA system would work better if people in general cared more about who was running the government. People have become too lazy and complicit.
but how do the nazis fit in?
You put anarchism on the far left. Explain do me how you're going to redistribute wealth and property equitably without a state or governing agent. It's impossible since everyone disagrees as to what is equitable. This is why any far left movement ends in violence in the population. \n\nAnarchism is the default mode of voluntary association. It's much more closely related to capitalism since ownership is preserved by the rights of the individuals. Anarchocommunism is a nonsense word that just means \"violence\".
God bless Trump that fuckin Kenyan was the worst thing American's let happen so far
nazis were socialist... in practice they made business and industry fall in line with the national socialist adgenda both economically and socially. The business payed high taxes and could not exist outside national socialist policy. There were many social/welfare benefits for those conforming to party ideology and eventually nothing if you were against. Guns were confiscated, free speech and organized political opposition eventually gone...
So basicaly socialists dont really know what they want, but they want something...
Hmmmm seems like you've fairly explained what the socialist branch terms mean to combat misunderstanding and then bastardized the term capitalism in your usage.
The main problem with communism is human greed. You are basically taking all the money of a country and giving it to one entity the government then expecting them to give it back. We already can’t trust our government with our money in a capitalist society. They spend it on things that are often disagreed with. If you look at every communist society it  always ends up with the majority making as little wealth as possible and one person having everything. \n\nYou’re also crazy to think that a kid still in high school should make as much money as a doctor and that the majority of people will pick hard career fields just because of passion. People mostly choose jobs out of necessity not passion.
What about syndicalism?
Pa pa pa patriarchy
The points on \"where factories should be built\" and so on where horribly misrepresented and slanted heavily in the favor of socialism. Even the picture of the capitalist shows enormous bias.
Cuba is State Capitalist
this is so wrong lol
Thats the first video about this topic which doesnt seem to missinform
Social Democracy is typically not attached to Marxism, though they can be Marxist or inspired by Marxist thought. I think you made the distinctions very unclear (and on this point directly inaccurate) as you did not focus on Classical Socialism, and various forms of Anti-Marxist communism.\n\n(You also forgot to explain Nazism)\n\nThe cut between Socialism and Capitalism is also not as clear. You are placing Social Democrats on the Capitalist side (likely because you lean towards Marxism, and the Marxist definition) as they are largely capitalistic, but the right would place them on the socialist side because they are largely socialistic (which spans beyond \"ownership\", you forgot to mention the alternative definition which sights \"control\"). You are also forgetting Syndicalism, and how Syndicalism plays a huge role in the Nordic Model.\n\nThe truth is that there is a long line of overlaps between pure socialism and pure capitalism, and that these ideologies are technically not the only contenders as you also have Mercantilism (where the Nazis got a large amount of their inspiration).\n\nIt is also worth noting that there is nothing necessarily contradictory between a private market and socialism, as a private market is not the same as capitalism/free market economy.
Instructive video. Nevertheless, I should point out that there are non-communist anarchists, and I'm not talking about the \"anarcho\"-capitalists but about individualist anarchists and mutualists, for example.
Capitalism: explore your fellow human to the maximum extent possible, drive down wages.\nCommunism and socialism (pure forms): I'm lazy and the government should take care of me.\nWe just need good salaries! That's it. I want a \"Goodsalarism\" revolution.
So how many forms of socialism didn't end in failure.
I don’t really see how Anarchists could be a subset of Socialists. Most Anarchists say they want no government in any way shape or form. Is this a misrepresentation of anarchism? Or is there a difference between “ecenomic anarchy” and “governmental anarchy?”\n\nI say this as someone that is sort of enchanted by the idea of the typical anarchist’s biggest talking point - absolutely no government. Nobody setting any restrictions or regulations on what you can say, do, etc. I don’t believe in everything being publicly owned. I believe in earning/making/taking whatever you need or want. I don’t believe in handouts. I don’t understand how no government correlates with that.
Hell's Army needs you!
2:00 tho
They should broadcast that on fox news.
The original intent of social democracy was to achieve socialism through evolutionary means (as opposed to revolutionary means). I would say members of social democratic parties have abandoned social democracy.
I at most align with Social Democrats (lest I be a full blooded capitalist) but I think Star Trek had the right idea. With the increasing amount of automation in manufacturing and the like, some future form of technocratic socialism into communism is probably inevitable. Doesn't mean I want it that way now though.
Communism Everybody's equal, but some people are better.
Can you do one where you also explain the difference between genderism and autism? Cuz I don’t really see one.
Just need a fed job guarantee for a living wage for the public purpose a floor or minimal living standards by right of birth no over throw necessary just no more dead zombie neolibral neoclassical economics\n*modern monetary theory
How’s the way it goes socialism, communism - both requiring basically top down enforcement by dictatorship - and then... anarchism, basically the diametric opposite to a dictatorship.
What about anarcho capitalism?
The difference between communism/capitalism = capitalism has proven to advance the world, communism has always failed.
It's a shame you neglect to mention the corpses of the millions of innocent, dead people who've been murdered in the name of these  poisonous, failed ideologies.
I am very grateful for the time and effort you took to make these videos and your channel. I find them educational, and you answer many of my questions and explain the ideologies that I am interested in learning more about. I am grateful for the other video you did recommending books for people newly interested such as myself. I look forward to checking out your website and viewing more of your videos. Have a good day
Anarchism is definitely not socialism... that's a ridiculous over simplification of a diverse diaspora. Are there Anarcho-Communists? Yes of course. There are also Anarcho-Primitivists, Anarcho-Capitalists and many other variants... if you're watching this just disregard entirely what he said about anarchism and research that independent of this video.
My Brain is burning!!!!! Oyy oy! My poor English :/ Help me Fidel!
You forgot cultural marxism which destroys the western society
Isn’t it better to share  and own it all together than the tiny 1%
USA is not a nation, its a state\nyou used those words synonymously but their are very different things\ncould you please provide a source on how nazi were largerly capitalistic and had free market? from what i heard they were very centrally planned\nyou said scandinavia is capitalistic and then you said they follow the ideology of social democracy, that doesnt make much sense, capitalistism is when everything is privatly owned, and in democracy the ruling party calls the shots who and what can do and cannot do and who can own what.\ni do not think that startrek is good example of stateless society, there is a big government called the federation'\n\noverall i think your ideology chart is not really all that great,capitalism is a category by itself and i do not think any sub-categories could be pushed underneath it\ni think about \"socialism\" more of a slider, at 0% you have capitalism and at 100% you have full authority/central planning\nand between those 2 points you can push all of those socialisms and comunisms\n\nedit: i had made a mistake explaining democracy due to my poor english skills
The purest successful form of communism is the Israel kibbutz
In other words; club together and start buying shares. Invest.
Any ideology where equality of outcome is an ideal is a bad ideology, so in a sense - socialism, communism, marxism, they're all the same.\nAny ideology where you can look at the economy collectively for reasons other than aggregate analysis is a bad ideology.\n\nHaving all that said, there can be welfare policies in a state without it being socialist or socialist leaning, if the policies stem not from attempting to achieve equality of outcome but rather treating welfare as an investment.
It’s not the system, but the people who run it.
I thought this was a really interesting video. I’m pretty young and live in the US, so I haven’t been exposed to a lot of things other than capitalism and what people say about communism and socialism (and most of the things they say aren’t true or embellished in some way). Thanks for the run-down!
Usually working in a factory is a menial job people who work factory jobs usually are super unlucky or have low IQs. Me and you both know that we do not want is people with low IQs running a country and it's markets. but I feel a lot of people who believe in Socialism and any type of leftist ideology think this is wrong and \"politically incorrect\". I do realize it may sound harsh but it's the truth.
9:47 If I ever create a country, this'll be it's flag.
[6:10] Might be better if you don't hit your table (with your mic on it) while talking.
I love Communism!
i'd like to have a system called democratic-communism where you can have the benefits of both communism and democracy. you can vote every 4 years, you have the freedom of speech,  you won't be judged if you hate the leader or thrown in prison, but on the communist side you'll have a job for everyone, everyone would be equal, everyone would have free healthcare and education etc.
I can hear your fist bumping on your table and poluting your mic input.
Evan Cuba is gradually moving towards a mixed economy. Not as quickly as China and Vietnam did, but that is in large part because of the USA embargo.\n   Communists and Anarchists have formed strategic alliances, but it has generally worked out badly for the Anarchists, who get betrayed and crushed by the Communists, at least if the Communists gain control. Their goals are cleary not the same.
social democracy is still similar to socialism in that it advocates for the dissolution of the social hierarchy - the key principle of socialism. would you agree?
Thank god for capitalism.
??????? ?? ?????????? ?????. ???? ????? ????????? ??? ?? ???????, ? ?? ?? ??????? ????? ???? ???? ????????? ????? ??? ?????? ???????, ?? ??????????? ????? ????? ???.
This isn't unbiased at all. /sarcasm
It'd be a damn relief if people actually understood this, even though if I'm very right-wing.\n\nAnd \"anarchism\" depends on what you consider to be true \"anarchy\", the destruction of hierarchy (amcoms), or the elimination of use of force to make people do something (ancaps). How do they plan to do that without force, no fucking idea. I personally think that anarchism is moronic. At the moment you abolish the state you'll see both ancoms lining up everyone who disagrees with them on walls and ancaps starting an international transgender sex-slave market.
As a Libertarian who generally supports Capitalism, I thought this was a very informative video that will hopefully let me challenge my own views and grow as a person. Thanks for presenting this information in a very fair manner!
I feel like sharing some pots of Pesto now
\"Free\" and paid for by the \"government\" which means all just means paid for by the people.
really the USSR ( Union of SOVIET Socialist Republics ) was socialist. XD
Socialism is cancer nukes are the answer.
Interesting. So I not as much of a Socialist as I thought.
I would rather have a free market then anything personally, let’s say your a game dev if the business is owned by the state or a group of workers you couldn’t be as creative or take risks because the rest of the group is to scared to take risks if anyone has an explanation please tell me
Wow very good job, the website looks good made! Thank you for that good content!
All socialists and communists are lazy assholes who care not for the houses and business their family has built and owns because they don't want to work, it's quite simple they want things and don't want to work for them, because of this they make no money and blame their own inability to be successful on capitalism.
I hate to be critical but, I will... First let me just say that your facts about socialism is correct. \n\nHowever, what many don't realize is that socialism stifles true progress. The world is what it is because through capitalism industrial advancment have free reign due to little regulations on what is produced. We expanded and evolved due to market disruption. A disruption occurs when one advancment challenges an existing product in the same industry. Socialism stifles this because the state sponsor determines whether or not you are allowed to make and sell a product.\n\nSo, let's say someone comes up with something that can replace oil... In a capitalist society there is no one to stop them but, competition. In socialism... The state sponsor can say \" well, I really like my oil thank you but, thanks for trying... Now get back work plebian!\"
Finland is like Sweden aswell. They are social democratic
I love it!
All these are great ideas on paper, but when executed it will NEVER work. Capitalism is the best way to go.
Your best example for a communist state is a fictional television show? (Star Trek).
This is the most helpful video I have ever watched
All of these BS classifications are how a \"one\" accumulates/concentrates power. Instinctual/animal traits. One person wants power over another - namely you! That's all you need to know. Don't get caught up in definitions and categories. It's all bullshit! If you don't want another animal \"that thinks a lot\" to control you...He'll be shoving his d*ck up your ass - while telling you how you should enjoy it. Buy a gun, work to feed you and your family. Nuff said.
Your socialist box isn't big enough for me to read all of your excuses luckily I can read the capitalism box and see how it doesn't need an excuse thanks for the video.
You sir, have been awarded a street light..
Sorry, but as a person who read several books on Marx, Hegel, Kropotkin and Lenin, I cannot agree with that classification. Of course it is all about definition, but the original idea behind Socialism and Communism by Marx is a different one.
Thank you for making this video, as an American I'm surrounded by propagandized ignorance when concerning anything under the umbrella of socialism and since I suck at talking I think I'm just going to start referring everyone to this.
Marx would fucking kill himself if he watched this video. Fucking opportunists. A communist society will not come about because some stupid fucking revolutionary said so. It will form naturally once the material conditions are right, i.e.capitalism outliving its usefulness.
Yet these \"distinctions\" remain theoretical ponderings, not practical politics. Because no good argument has ever been made in favor of a socialist system. The only way socialism could ever exist in practice is by some form of Marxist-Leninism. And it has pretty much been established that such states, by their very nature, become corrupted. Since without a coercive state, who will carry out a socialist transformation and who will ensure that it is fulfilled, if not a centralized power structure, i.e. a state?
Great simple little video
Free education paid for by the government ???????? nothing is free you pay for it by way of taxation. In short you pay.
Communism!!!! FTW
Hej hej är du från Sverige eller bara bor du här?
I'm so happy this video got 500k+ views, that's alt-right numbers.
I don't care weather it's socialism, communism, or Marxism, their all bad.
Anarchism is not communist
Forgive me if this has a provoking tone too it, but my family escaped communism under the USSR and im just wondering where exactly do the millions of bodies fit into this equation?\nYou know, the part where the \"equality of outcome\" started getting interrupted by those who work harder, and dont work at all.\n\nAlso, as a business owner who started from NOTHING and EVERY dollar ever put into this business came directly out of my pocket how exactly do any of my employees own anything of mine?\n(No, my business isnt on the stock market and ive never taken any loans. All of my employees get paid leagues ahead of similar laborers in the industry.)\n\nEDIT: Please dont hit me with \"thats not real socialism\" or marxism or whatever you want to call it\n\n2nd EDIT: i actually took the time to visit your socialism 101 site...in the first 10 minutes i found this direct quote and before you try its HARDLY out of context, you claim to \"not argue either side\" but i will not put up with this kind of sophistry\n\n\"Stalin did the best he could in a bad situation (World War 2).\nStalin was not a dictator and made good contributions to socialism and the world as a whole.\"
It's evil is what it is.  You dont have the right to dictate my interactions with others including the sale of my labor.
It seems that most capitalists are in fact social democrats then.
\"China is not Socialist, it is Communist\" \"Communism is a subset of Socialism\". Pick one. Bad video.
Rather unfunny at times, but the informative part was done very well.
Wrong on Anarchism. Failure to differentiate between Egalitarian Anarchism (left) and Individualist Anarchism (right and/or not on the spectrum). Benjamin Tucker disavows.
Great video
Socialism is basically a middle ground between capitalism and communism. Basically, “capitalism lite”. So it’s false to say that all communists are socialists, because many of us only view socialism as a stepping stone to get us to where we want to be ie true communism (collective ownership of the world’s land and resources).\n\nAlso, Marx talking about “collective ownership of the means of production” means much more than factories and farms lol. It denotes collective ownership of the world’s land and resources, in addition to infrastructure like farms/factories etc (which couldn’t exist if it wasn’t for the land and resources they require to function)
Where would systems like Oligarchy, Consecration, etc.\nYou may not of heard of consecration so this is how it works.\nNo one owns anything all is consider God's and/or as common.  The state owns nothing, the leaders/'state'  roll is to only teach what is correct and beyond that let people govern themselves and to keep everyone organized.   Each family speaks with their  leader to determine where to live and put their surplus in the storehouse for those who were unable to produce sufficient but the leader does have any authority to require people to donate surplus.  Consecration system can only be composed of industrious and highly selfless people, which is why you probably never heard of it but when a group of people practice it in becomes a very beautiful and happy community of people who all become exceedingly prosperous.  Stealing is impossible because nothing is consider to be property.
I don't get how anarchism can be a kind of communism. How can a political theory about 0 government be categorized as a subsection of another political theory where the government has all the power.
I'm an anarcho-capitalist. \n\nCome at me breh.
Socialism utopian society theory doesn't work in real life.
Socialism without democracy is not socialism. Cuban democracy is the same thing as American democracy.
Socialist movement so many branches but where are all these great socialist countries failed
o he's swedish explains a lot
Hm i feel like I’d have to see what social democracy looks like in America before I can imagine a socialist state
In the US, just about 99% of people who call themselves “democratic socialists” are actually social democrats and they have no idea that there is a difference. I made this same mistake for the longest time, and I’m very glad this video exists, it was badly needed for the US political debates. Many right wingers just call everything to the left of them communist and honestly don’t see much of a difference between Bernie Sanders and Mao, which is a problem for democracy.
what about anarcho capitalist
Could you perhaps recommend an unbiased  book on socialism and capitalism?
Cuba is hardly democratic.
Have you ever heard of the no true scottsman fallacy?
Comrades we will overthrow the capitalists
Capitalism ?
The more important factor is individual v collective. Individuals are real and collectives are abstractions. Therefore, society should, and does work far better, when based around the individual. The US is known to be a ‘rugged individualistic’ country. This is sometimes mistaken for ‘right wing’. It’s successful, people all over the world want to go their, yet it’s evil- cognitive dissonance perhaps? The individual is dispensable in a collectivist nation. Also, left wingers can be individualist. Their is nothing more egalitarian than that.
nice video comrade
I feel so smart now!
Nice video dude
Socialism is cancer
Tjena göteborgare
«Like Sweeden and Denmark»\nOH YEAH, JUST GLANCE RIGHT OVER NORWAY WHY DONT YOU
@azureScapegoat  I always thought Sweden was socialist. Sweden imposed high taxes on the wealthy eliminating  social class and was a welfare state. Can you please elaborate?
Thank you comrade!
This guy kinda sounds like ed miliband
A lot of weird tendentious stuff here. Not all anarchists are communists or socialists. No mention of the inherently murderous nature of socialism and communism
I am not really bothered what the difference is after that lot.
While I don't exactly support what many state economy proponents preach, I found this video very interesting and non-biased, thanks for making a video on this subject that's not taking a side and just explaining the facts.

France is a social-democratic country that has been led by right-leaning parties since the beginning of the fifth Republic. I doubt our \"Socialist party\" can even be considered as a social-democratic party. Our social-democratic party is called fucking French Communist Party ...
this was so helpful. it’s hard to find reliable information on socialism since a lot of videos and articles are created by very strongly anti-communists. so thank you ??????
ALL COMMUNISTS SHOU DIE! I am reporting ur channel communist pig! A good communist is a dead communist! Communists are scum! Fucking untermenchen! USA is nomber one you fucking scandinavian pig
Lol people in Cuba ???? democratically through the government own means of production ??????
Where does fachism stand?
Comandre
HITLER HAD THE RIGHT IDEA! TAKE THE MONEY OFF THE ZIONIST BANKERS AND ABOLISH THE JEWISH USUARY SYSTEM THAT HAS ENSLAVED THE PEOPLE AND ONLY LOOKS AFTER THE ELITISTS 1%! BULLSHIT PROPAGANDA BY THE ZIONIST OWNERS OF THE MASS MEDIA HAVE DEMONIZED THE MOST HEALTHY FAIR AND HAPPY SOCIETIES EUROPE HAD EVER SEEN, SO THEY DONE THEIR DAMNESTTO DESTROY IT OR THE REAL TRUTH OF IT AND WROTE HISTORY TO POTRAY THEM AS EVIL PEOPLE!
I'm curious: the function of taxation as a means of public revenue to pay for social infrastructure such as roads and hospitals and social welfare such as education is non-capitalist, yet taxation as a form of revenue for private enterprise,  such as incentives, is pro-capitalist. How does taxation function in each of these definitions? It seems the line between socialist ideals and capitalist phenomena is not a clearly definable dichotomy, in practice, at least. \nThanks for your great presentation!
Economic Philosophy\n\nNational Socialism Key economic points on why they were so successful from 1933-1939\n\n1. What was the German economic policy introduced by National Socialism in 1933 based upon?\na. Fundamental considerations. In the relations between economics and the people, the people alone is the only unchangeable element. Economic activity in itself is no dogma and never can be such. There is no economic theory or opinion which can claim to be considered as sacrosanct. \n2. With regards to this issue, what is the only thing that is of decisive importance here?\na. The will to place the economic system at the service of the people, and capital at the service of economics.\n3. With regards to the above answer, what opinion does national socialism vigorously combat\na. That the economic structure exists for the benefit of capital and that the people are to be looked upon as subject to the economic system.\n\n4. Why is the notion that the economic system can exist and operate entirely freely and entirely outside of any control or supervision of the state false?\na. In the modern phase of the development, the economic system concentrates enormous masses of workers in certain special branches and definite local areas. New inventions or a slump in the market may destroy whole branches of industry at one blow.\n5. In the event of the above answer, will the industrialist be ruined? If not, why not? If so, will this happen to most industrialists or only a small percentage of them?\na. In most cases he will not be ruined so easily. He may close his factory gates or even try to find a new field for his personal activities. The industrialist who have to suffer in such contingencies are only a small number of individuals. \n6. And what of the workers?\na. On the other side, there are hundreds of thousands of workers with their wives and children. Who is to defend their interests and care for them? It is the duty of the volksgemeinschaft. Therefore, the volkgemeinschaft cannot be made to bear the burden of economic disasters without according it the right of influencing and controlling economic life and thus avoiding catastrophes. \n7. Is the salvation of our people a financial problem? If not, what kind of a problem is it?\na. It is not a financial problem, it is exclusively a problem of how industrial labor could best be employed on the one side and, on the other, how our agricultural resources could be utilized. It is first and foremost a problem of organization\n8. Are phrases such as “freedom of the economic system” helpful? In response to the answer for #7, what therefore needs to be done?\na. What we have to do is to use all available means at hand to make production possible, and open up fields of activity for our working energies.\n9. If # 8 can be achieved by the economic leaders, are will content? If it cannot be achieved, what must be done on the part of the state?\na. If they fail, the state is obliged to step in for purposes of seeing that the working energies of the nation are employed in such a way that what they produce will be of use to the nation, and the state will have to devise the necessary measures to assure this.\n10. In this respect the state may do everything; But what is the one thing it cannot do that was the actual state of affairs we had to face?\na. To allow 12.000 million working hours to be lost year after year!\n11. What gives money its value? \na. Productive labour\n12. Does the folk-community exist on the fictitious value of money? What does it exist on?\na. No. It exists on the results of productive labor.\n13. What is the first cover for a currency\na. This production, and not a bank or gold reserve\n14. What happens if I increase production? \na. I increase the real income of my fellow citizens.\n15. What happens if I reduce production?\na. I reduce that income, no matter what wages are paid out.\n16. Why was there a demand for many millions tons more coal than formerly? (not for the purpose of superheating the houses of a few millionaires to a couple thousand degrees)\na. Because millions of our volksgennossen were thus enabled to purchase more coal for themselves with their increased income.\n17. How was such a gigantic increase in German production brought about?\na. By giving employment to millions of German workers who had hitherto been idle.\n18. What guaranteed the market value of the goods produced?\na. That rise in total national income.\n19. When and why would there be shortages from time to time?\na. Only in such cases where we could not increase this production, owing to certain conditions that were beyond our control.\n20. Did the shortages bear any proportion whatsoever to the general success of the N.S. economists?\na. No\n21. How did this four year plan benefit the masses being released from the armament industry?\na. It provided permanent employment in the internal circulation of our economic life.\n22. Does the state wish to assume the role of entrepreneur? Under what circumstances will the state attempt to bureaucratize economic life.\na. No\n23. What is the extent to which the state will supervise conditions and methods of working?\na. Only in so far as this is in the interest of all those engaged in work.\n24. What value is an inventor or and economic organizer to the volkgemeinschaft?\na. Inestimable value.\n25. What is the first task of National Socialist education?\na. To make clear to all our volksgennossen how their reciprocal worth must be appreciated. There can be no substitute for the German worker. The inventor and genuine business leader are indespensible.\n26. Under the age of such an outlook on economic life, can strikes and lockouts be tolerated any longer?\na. No\n27. Why does the national socialist state repudiate the right of economic coercion?\na. Above all contracting parties stand the economic interests of the nation, which are the interests of the people.
The Marxians have no right to disguise themselves as Socialists. Unlike Marxism, Socialism does not repudiate private property, it does not negate personality, and it does not disarm its own people. (non military people)\n\nMarx invented nothing. The ancient Germans had certain grounds in common. Socialism, or the common weal, says that nobody starves, nobody freezes. It is not political, it is basic morals on the most fundamental level.\n\nRoosevelt gave Stalin $150 billion and unlimited tanks and ammo, not to mention covering for Katyn massacre and many war crimes of the Soviets. I fell for this Marxist trap as a youth, but now I know the truth. \n\nIn 1940, victims of the Katyn massacre went missing in Soviet occupied territory. In 1943 they were found by the national socialists (\"Nazis\") who conducted a rigorous investigation and invited the red cross and all nations to come and take a look. How were they rewarded? The whole thing was blamed on them by Roosevelt and Stalin and this blame lasted until 1989 when Russia finally admitted it. How can communists say the conspiracy is on them? I was a Marxist minded youth looking for answers and I can tell you, the truth is stranger than fiction.
Stopped when you said Anarchism is in communism. Anarchism and Communism are polar opposites. “Anarcho-Communism,” is an oxymoron.
marx is daddy
all this says is shit countries go socialist :thinking:
Thanks from a capitalist
Lol ''free education and health'' Why the fuck do you fucking spastics always say ''free'' My nigga nothing in this world is free.\n\nPeople work jobs, people get taxed for what they earn, and that tax money pays for retard things like ''free education'' or even worse they pay for lazy people who dont want to work!
Socialism is merely a synonym for communism. This video is bullshit
2:27 damn come on I wanted to sell my grandma
lol only dumb asses throw around these terms like word salads.
The people own the means of production THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT...\n\n\n\n\nOh wait, the governments that take over are corrupt and kill millions in the name of helping them.
To any communist wanting a revolution, American culture and population sizes are not in your favor, look at states like Montana and California, the most populous and one you never heard of, how are you going to put a system in place that works in both regions that are complete opposites.
The Nazi party, as far as I'm concerned, is fascist. It is a dictatorship that rules using xenophobia and racism as influence. Hence the reason for the extermination of the Jewish.
GREAT video about socialism without mentioning the biggest socialiat country ever - USSR
Socialism (without Jews control) and Communism(with Jews in control)   Hitler fought against Jewish Communist invading Christian Socialism of Europe!     Democracy and Communist is almost the same !
Wrong. The state is not the community, the people are the community. The state is the government. And the state in Cuba is not elected democratically, so how is this Socialist?\nHow could you make such a fatal flaw?
The problem with Scandanavi is it's homogenous...everyone is the same, the population is small, and they don't allow much immigration....much different that the USA
Here in Denmark, our leading political parties are a mix of capitalists and socialist. We pay like 47-63% in tax, but we have free education, free hospital and such
Yea, add that comunism dont work.
Thank you for making this video, I’m currently doing review for my Political Science course and this helped very much. It helps taking in information in different forms of media and through different senses.
Amazing video. Very comprehensive.
Most people don't realize that the philosophies of Communism and Socialism; even Germany's brand, predate the rise of Hitler, Stalin, even Karl Marx or Luxemburg. I remember reading books by Crowley published in 1904 that mention those \"infantile cults\" and the results to come should their implementation go forward. French intellectuals in the mid 1700's  are from what I can tell the originators of both philosophies underpinning structures; state planming, government control over production and distribution, employment, personsl liberties, the feelings about private property and business ownership etc..
Man you're all over the board with this agenda. Perhaps the majority know all to well exactly what Communism & Socialism means. As for labeling individuals appropriately, looks like, acts like, guess what it is.
I checked out your website and I thought I would give you a small bit of criticism (I know I would want it). In the FAQ, you assert that workers are not being paid according to their worth, but lots of people do believe they are being paid properly, so it begs the question: how are you determining the value of labor? In capitalist theory, value is determined by negotiation between employer and employee. Employers can decline raises, but employees can quit. The leverage goes both ways; wage vs skill, calculated in the minds of both people.
FWIW State != Community. I think this needs to be sorted out with these soft cuddly descriptions of what will inevitably be totalitarian regimes.
Anarchism derives from socialism!?!
Richard Wolff: \"Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism\" | Talks at Google\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynbgMKclWWc
socialism = economy is owned/controlled by \"community\"\nmarxism = economy is owned/controlled by \"workers\"\ncommunism =  marxist economy and without a state = impossible because anarchy is unachievable/unsustainable\nTo most people, socialism/marxism/communism = welfare state = give me free/subsidized goods/services
Interesting - I disagree about Cuba being controlled by the people.  It was controlled by People, the dictator Castro and his minions, but \"people\" as in ordinary Cubans had no real say, they got firing squads for speaking out.  What I'd like to see if a \"true\" socialist country ever arises, is that people fight to immigrate, instead of to emigrate.  I'm not saying that it can't be done, just that it hasn't been done so far.
OMG... citing the #MARXIST rework of Star Trek... The REAL Star Trek had something called \"credits.\"
But can you solve the Calculation problem in a system that has no currency?
that's a good and sadly underrated breakdown. should've told about the transition period
Social democracy worked quite well for a while in Britain in the immediate post-war years.It was a shame that the unions pushed so hard.That ushered in Thatcherism which turned the police force into Thatcher's personal army which she used to crush all & any protest against her policies.She destroyed our Nation as an industrial power & gutted coal-mining communities.They still have no jobs,no hope,no community spirit.She broke them.Just drugs & crime where there was true community spirit & working class pride.I'm no Marxist,at all!! But she left a legacy of ruin in her wake.Maybe the unions did need reeling in a little but that level of cultural destruction was malicious revenge upon those who tried to oppose her policies.Cruel,destructive & unnecessary.
Communism will only work perfectly IF everyone agrees to it but not everyone agrees with it so plus its better on small scale while capitalism is better on large scale
Okay fuck off, saying they have some government intervention then use the example of not exploiting your grandmother? That’s insanely biased and pretty unfair
I know alllll about this stuff because some times i play as a communisst in hoi4!
One thing undeniable and  true about theories of socialism, communism and Marxism is that the three have cost over 100,000,000 people their lives to date. And I knew some of them.
As someone whose political views drift left and right all the time, i really enjoyed this video and found it very interesting.\nThank you for this.
This is why socialism and communism always end up failing the ideologies are to complex and not everyone agrees on what it is and how it should be run this is why socialist countries often tend to have uprisings
Social Democracy rocks.
That was really fucking confusing lol
All of these are horrible ideologies.
Basically \nSocialism=Fairness and equality\nCommunism=Fair organized anarchy\nAnarchy= No government
thing is terms mean what people decide they mean, not their creators or apologists\n\nwhether you have a pristine definition you support or not, communism has killed over 100 million people and socialism didn't only kill the jews. nazis ARE socialist by the way. extremely.  sweden, china, cuba, sanders and nazis have the following in common:\n\n- high tax                                                                     - funded more than 15% by communist county banks\n- gun control                                                               - nightmarish identity politics (yes even modern sweden)\n- invasive corporate regulation                                - move in direction of globalization, debate on how much\n- universal \"healthcare\"                                             - social dogma enforced even if individual isn't hurting anyone, liberty removed\n\nso right there the premise is wrong. please step up your game. better yet, learn that communism and socialism only sound good in an ideological framework (and THAT is debatable, i still think the 'ideal' form is tyranny and foolish)  In real life it just murders people and was specifically invented to trick the middle class into returning to serfdom and slavery\n\npeople forget that wealth, the means of production and etc are not more important than life. no one is more oppressive than the governments these days, including the wealthiest people and companies
The problem with communism is that eventually you run out of other peoples money to spend. So you have to annex other countries.  Ask Russia.
STOP IGNORIMG FINLAND AND DO NPT SPEAK ABOUT DENMARK AND SWEDEN ALL.THE TIME
paid for by the taxpayers*
Sexlexia lol love Futurama
I´m from Sweden and I´ll try to explain the definition of socialism as I see it ... Socialism means that everyone has access to healthcare, childcare, education, etc., which the government of the country will provide through the tax system. In Sweden, citizens receive this free of charge (without paying with any net income) ... These services can be performed by government or by private companies (via the tax system) ... So all schooling, healthcare, education is \"free\" (no extra money is paid) ... Education is free also at university (students are paid to study there)! Everyone is entitled to 25 days paid leave each year (with 100% salary) and you are entitled to have parental leave for up to 18 months / child (with 80% salary) ... Sweden is not a purely socialist country but a social democratic country where most companies are privately owned as IKEA, HM, Volvo, Ericson etc ... and also network companies that created Skype, Spotify, MineCraft, etc.
In Cuba why does the government own the means of production instead of the people themselves? Isn't this easily corrupted? Doesn't this put the government above the people?
In Cuba why does the government own the means of production instead of the people themselves? Isn't this easily corrupted?
In Cuba why does the government own the means of production instead of the people themselves? Isn't this easily corrupted?
Capitalism without socialism you get fascism, socialism without capitalism you get communism. You will always need capitalism to live in a world full of wonders.
You forgot to add Anarcho syndicalism
Socialism, communism.... Both cancerous mechanisms that always have and always will usher in genocide and total dictatorship.
I feel like the model is a bit inaccurate when representing Anarchism. Anarchism is a multifaceted ideology that can fall under both capitalism and communism. Generally speaking anarchists do fall on the socialist and communist spectrum, mostly because Anarcho-Capitalism is just generally bad as it undermines the concept of anarchism by establishing authority through wealth.
I would like to know the difference between a democracy, capitalism and a constitutional republic. I could look it up but a video is nice.
Socialism is the grift of non-producing people into the largesse of producers through the \"democratic\" force of the state.
Damn you Systembolaget.... das ist nicht dot!
I appreciate, that somebody makes such videos, becuase I'd like to know more about your point of view, with which I disagree the most I can. But I can't judge anything, that I don't really know, so I'm happy for these explanations.
PragerU add is actually pretty lit...I shouldn't have gave it a thumbs down
PragerU add is actually pretty lit...I shouldn't have gave it a thumbs down
The basic thought of scoialisms redistribution of wealth stand directly against the ideas of the us. It has never really taken hold here because we have too much income mobility. The problem we are fighting now is the socialist idea that we are the same. Look if you make something successful and I don't then we are not the same. Why should we stifle innovation and drive for \"equality\" when all that equality equates to is crushing of those who are willing to support those who are not. The only true equality we can have for everyone is equality of opportunity not equality of outcome. If we all died we would be equal but I don't want to die am I now taking advantage of others because I have a drive to change my outcome? Why should my outcome change if I'm not willing to change it? My problem with socialism is it works only when you have taken everything away and its about simple survival. When there is excess then human nature of what I need kicks in and destroys the basic concept of equal outcome that you are seeing emerge in leftist states here in the us. Look at Cali its becoming a communist hellhole.
great video!
Communism= socialism= mental confusion = Leninist Stalinist mismanagement corruption naxalism massacres then....blah blah....... Poof !  USSR gone  !
488000th view
Why the hell is this recomended.\n\nHey a tip go back to 1921 to 2000 and you Will have your awnser on socialism in sweden. 1 thing for sure. We are not communists and we do not like capitalism that USA has. Also it would be a big misstake saying that scandinavia is socialistisk.  We all have our own history. We have our own culture. +swedens flag is not scandinavia. Scandinavia is a union of several nordic Countries. Like you cant say scandinavia is socialistisk. Like denmark and sweden is so opposit eachother fundamentally.\n\nLike american democrats is for me a right wing party.\nRepublicans are far right.\nWant to learn a thing or 2 about socialism. Watch the movie of Olof Palme. One of our greatest primeminister Who is a social democrat. That might get you the best awnser. But for now. Socialism in sweden is not communism and for sure not capitalism.
Video is well put together. But I can't say I agree with all the points. Too tired to write out why though.
Entrepreneurialism, small-scale creativity to provide something of value, startups, not capitalism (using money mainly just to make more money). We need to persuade the ultra rich to not be gamers just collecting as much as possible but putting it to work for other-than-self (including you and me) to benefit.
Someone is a moron. Communism, Socialism and Marxism ARE ALL THE SAME CREATURE. ??
Brilliant video!  \nThx
The Bolsheviks destroyed the idea of Socialism. Socialism was always known as workers control over the means of production. Bolshevism is state monopoly on the means of production, completely different. Socialism from this time has another name today, Anarchism. \n\nThese ideas are taken from Noam Chomsky.
The only thing that matters is socialism, marxism and communism all screw the average person. All anyone needs to know is capitalism is the only economic system that has ever produced success.
What a fail you are
I guess I'm just too capitalist to get it because I just don't get it at all, even after a 2nd viewing. I don't know, maybe I'm just arguing from incredulity here, but I don't get it.
If you put it on 2x it becomes a Cgp grey video
The problem I have with this video is it presents socialism and capitalism as if they can't both exist simultaneously.  There are definitely differences between the two ideologies and they both have their pros and cons but most countries have elements of both.  Instead of two solid colors it really should be a gradient between capitalism and socialism.......... and depending on the service or industry it will vary where it is in the gradient.
But at the end of the day there still all retarded
I'd love to see your review of the Venus Project and its proposal of a \"resource-based economy\" and if it falls anywhere under communism or marxism. Jacque Fresco's idea of a resource-based economy is a bold idea that hasn't been tried. Fresco wants to declare all the earth's resources the common heritage of all the earth's people. There is no money or possession, but people have access to all the necessities of life without a price tag or servitude or barter. Repetitive or mundane labor will be automated by machines, freeing people to pursue art, science, and other higher things. Not only the necessities of life, but whatever they need or desire. There's no point in extravagant lifestyles without money, so everyone, not just certain people or groups, is able to enjoy a high standard of living. Jacque says it's not so much ownership of something one desires, but access to it. How many of our possessions sit around collecting dust and not being used for years? So shopping is more like a public library. So if you go somewhere on vacation, you could go to a distribution center and check out a camera, and return it if you wish. If you want to keep it, no one's stopping you, but it's your burden. The only practical reason for keeping one is if you take pictures a lot normally and not just here and there. Without money, and with resources freely available, stealing is a non issue, along with a lot of the crimes associated with the monetary system, so crime would disappear, and the need for government and laws will disappear. And even if someone commits some sort of aberrant or violent behavior, society seeks to rehabilitate them, not lock them up in a cell for a time. The monetary system runs on scarcity, but wind and solar energy are so abundant there's no point in selling them, and we have the resources to house everyone, build hospitals and schools all over the world, give labs and universities the finest equipment for scientific and medical research. We can take technology to its highest potential, rather than planned obsolescence and technological paralysis, and automate repetitive tasks and production to such a level that scarcity doesn't exist. It doesn't mean we have unlimited resources, it just means we intelligently manage our resources. such as saving the wastewater from the sink and shower and using it to flush the toilet, and then filtering and recycling the waste water from the toilet. Rather than telling people to conserve water, build a system that does it. That's about it in a nutshell. You can watch the movie \"Zeitgeist: Addendum\" or the Venus Project documentaries \"Welcome to the Future\", \"Future By Design\", \"Paradise or Oblivion\", or \"The Choice Is Ours\", or read the book \"The Best That Money Can't Buy\" for more info, or I can try an answer whatever questions you might have, but I'd like to know where you think about where it falls under anarchy or communism or if it doesn't fall under any system as Jacque Fresco says. He says capitalism, communism, socialism, fascism, and all other such systems are all the same, obsolete and corrupt, and I tend to agree and think the resource based economy is a great idea, but you know more about socialism and communism and all more than I do, so I'm curious what you think. Thanks.
This is simply wrong. Sweden is not socialistic, which no one can argue it is.
Your video has subtile mistakes. Under socialism/communism, the state owns the means of production. Under fascism, private enterprise is allowed to exist IF it supports the goals of the state and conforms to the concept of ‘everything within the state, nothing outside the state.’ Scandinavia is more fascist than socialist IMHO.
Capitalism is better
nazi's weren't socialists they did that to trick ppl to hate socialists they even killed socialists
There never was communist countries, there were and are today only socialist countries
Sweden tax 56% of your earnings, makes it almost impossible to buy a car because of the taxes you have to pay. The free education and free healthcare does not mean you are getting a good education or good doctor,,, why? Because anyone can have an education.. competition creates inovation, it creates better devepment and it creates better possibilities... if a doctor that is not that innovated, does not compete with doctors from other countries takes care of you, you will have a greater chance of dying...
Is the concept of democracy socialist in nature?
You were assigned a job in Nazi Germany and couldn't quit.
\"Community is the State\" - didn't listen after that
Here's one: there isn't any. Slava Rossiya!
Why is it every time I hear/read someone explaining Marxism/socialism It sounds so wonky? It's always working class this, working class that. Like it boils down to farmer vs land owner. In other situations like doctors or factory workers, as seen in other comments, does the party \"pay\" them? So the Communist party ideally represents the \"workers\" and own the MoP in their place? Or ideally there is no party and it's all just \"workers\" and services are done via bartering system, akak a free market?\n\nI'm guessing \"The Party\" who would be representative of \"The people\" is just the state, or some form of it. I don't understand how anyone could trust something. that much. No state, ruling class, or organization should be trusted to be neutral to all people. There's never one, in the history of humans, that could be trusted. I'm sure in peoples fantasy of collective equality this sounds plausible. But beyond ones family, you start to stretch acceptance to its breaking limit.
Nazi Germany's economy was never a free market, private ownership existed in name only. the Nazis were the ones dictating prices, wages, what/when and how much of something would be produced, etc.
I was hoping you could go into the capitalist counter parts
So this guy is a Marxist huh
And just who will lead this grand scheme? Socialism of any stripe needs as a foundation the fact that no one can be secure in their own possessions and that people will produce of their own volition for the greater good without any reward. When any means of reward or punishment is introduced we are essentially right back to a capitalistic system if that reward can be leveraged to any social advantage. Notice the difference colors of uniforms in Star trek? Somebody is always gonna give the orders. Anarchist? Darwinist? The strong survive and rule,  sorry Charlie it's all b.s.
Cuba democratic?
Socialists:liberals with the Che Guevara shirt\nMarxists: Jews with sweet beards\nCommunists: *plays Soviet march URA!!!!!!
Where do you get these definitions? Your professor? Your intellectual cadre? Nobody understands these terms with these definitions. Here's how regular people understand these terms, and mind you that this is important because the only effective way of communicating an idea in a way that affects social change is to have your terms lined up with the widest possible audience:\nSocialism = state control of the economy for the purpose of equality. (The state need not control the whole or the majority of the economy, but rather more than a trivial part in order to meet this definition. The USA is one of few countries to have big welfare spending but not be socialist, due to weedsy differences in policy that resulted from an orthodoxy to pro-corporate ideology.)\nFeudalism = state control of the economy for the states' gains\nCorporatism = state control of the economy for private gains. (A state can be corporatist even if only a small but noticeable pattern emerges in their behavior which is corporatist.)\nCommunism = socialism that does not include democracy or civil rights.\nAnarchism = no state.\nFascism = socialism - equality + forced patriotism + state control of all things. (Think racist totalitarianism.)\nSocial Democracy = socialism + democracy + civil rights + a social experiment - nationalization and/or equal distribution\nDemocratic Socialism = socialism guided by the people's wills + social pluralism\nCapitalism = government non-intervention in the economy\nRevolutionary socialism = the belief that a violent revolution should occur to implement a communist society.\nMarxism = the belief that revolutionary socialism should be practiced in the belief that it will lead to a form of anarchy that de facto practices equal distribution of wealth, not through the state but by mutual trust.\nNobody cares about anything too pointy-headed, so abnandon the quest for \"worker controlled means\" and \"orthodox v. revisionist marxism.\" It's like how people try to strike a difference between different types of anarchy. Nobody cares.
Money is the root of all evils, for those with it, and even those without it, ensnared by its power.\nWith money you build arsenals, control people with power, governmental law, codes and regulations. \nWithout it, tools of labor for taxation, confiscation and manipulation. \n\nWell placed propaganda works best when those who are being manipulated are confident they are acting upon their own best interest, and free will.
None of this matters, it's a symptom of corruption regardless it's name.\nWhat's important is the component that drives all these systems, the worthless bank note known as money, enslaving all to it's debt.\nBy design, whom ever holds this debt rules the world, and that happens to be 8000 bankers, their headquarters to be exact, the BIS.\nCollapsing governments, countries, militaries at will like a real life version game of Life.
The common thread is fascism
Start up the rotors, pack the leftist scum.
Never explained what Marxism is
Left wing nut job.....
Leninism and Marxism-Leninism are the same thing
George Lincoln Rockwell - American National Socialism
Holy shit so compclicated I don't get it.
The socialism 101 is a very good and educated read , and was very helpful in understanding it , you have partly convinced me about it. Though the reason I say partly is because of lack of examples when saying \"No, plenty of them succeeded\" [ about socialism succeeding ] . In addition , saying that the US blocked socialism [ unjustly with the context you provide ] during the Korean war is wrong , as North korea attacked first to take over the sovereignty of another nation , so in reality it could just be two sides of the same coin .
So in this free market of Germany during WWII, exactly who was Germany trading on the open market with? The countries they invaded? The Russians? The Americans? Brits?\n\nExactly how did Germany get their money to keep the economy moving?\n\nYes, Germany was Socialist, but only with the focus on social programs designed to benefit the race of Germans, those who are called Teutonics. It did not benefit those who were not racially German. That is the difference as Russia was not and never was one ethnic group. And the US was never one ethnic group.\n\nInvading Poland was of no socialist benefit to the Poles, and the Nazi party didn't franchise France into the Socialist system of benefit. The French didn't benefit from Nazi Socialism. \n\nThe very reason is in the title of the party, the GERMAN workers. They did not consider those who lived in Germany that were not German as German nationality, to them German was a race, pure and simple. The US considers every American as American regardless of ethnic identity. And that is what you need to discuss. \n\nScandinavia is still fairly homogeneous, and to look at the US with the rose colored glasses of assumption that Americans should be like Scandinavia is clearly ignorance on the part of Scandinavians in wanting the US to be like Scandinavia in socialist programs that would never work in the US. \n\nWe have extreme broad spectrum of ethnicities and multigenerational class poverty that have not benefited by any of the socialist programs and certainly no Communist policies would work either. \n\nSocialism is nothing more than giving to the many what the few produce. When the few stop producing, what is next? Communism that everyone is equally entitled to the starvation that follows. When your population can no longer be maintained and the few no longer can produce, eventually the many will have to be forced to work because Socialism has engendered the idea that as long as someone else is producing then those not producing are entitled to the benefits. \n\nAsk young people today, do they want to produce tangible goods or do they want a society of mechanization to do the labor while they bask in leisure all day? Go ahead, ask. \n\nAnd while your Scandinavian farmers work to produce your food, are your Scandinavian farmers benefiting as much as the average urban Scandinavian? No, you will find they do not. \n\nThe worker in Scandinavia is still few feeding the many. Taxation for free education is good in theory, however if your free education is turning students away from producing, your students are still the many benefiting from the few who do produce and you call that Socialism? Marx called that bourgeoisie. \n\nPrivate ownership vs. State ownership.....the whole community is not producing, but the whole community is to benefit even if the majority never produce?
i feel you mis placed anarchy.  anarchy is very tight with capitalism.  the confusion comes from those self proclaimed anarchist activists.  these people do detest government but in action attempt to govern themselves.  libertarianism is just left of true anarchy.
The differences between the various forms of socialism are irrelevant to capitalists because they're all based on one very bad idea. Also, you can never have an actual democracy in a socialist system. A socialist government can only exist by unreasonably taxing those with means and redistributing the wealth. Obviously, this requires the threat of force to successfully implement that kind of taxation. Communists go even farther by handing over control of all means of production to the government and making private property ownership illegal.
This is the result of oversimplification and ignorance. I’m not a communist nor am I a socialist, but what I am is unimpressed.
The only problem with Socialism on it's own, as in not being a smaller part of a general capital system as is the case in Scandinavia, is that it ignores a very basic and simple issue, human nature!! ever wondered why in any socialist or a communist country through out history, the ruling party is generally full of Army leaders? it's because, Greed, a very basic instinct in humans that you cannot just ignore, sooner or later, the commune will be controlled by those who have the power! the army, then they will assign the better jobs, the better positions to their friends and friends friends, and eventually they will control the wealth, none else will have anything because they can't. whoever disagree will be labeled a traitor, a capitalist, an enemy of state, there will be no fair trials because the leaders of the party have no interest but their own interest.\nI lived in a so called Socialist country, and saw the demise happen year after year.\n\nAlso, I read in the website,that you claim Orwell was advocating socialism?? where did you get that? 1984 was a clear attack on socialism and communism!
Capitalism and socialism can work together. It must be done through companies requiring them to letting them have 401k plans through salary withdraws, matching contributions, requiring companies to share in the profit of a company with profit sharing according to wages. This would take a burden off the social security system poverty later in the future.
Sorry I just heard a lot of blah blah blah. Tried to fallow but it didn't really explain anything. except maybe how the greatest nation on Earth should try to be more like some of the crappy ones.
It all stems from Marxism. They just keep changing the title.
I'm trying to understand; When someone says \"Anti Capitalist\", does that mean they want to completely abolish the system of money and currency and go back to a barter / trade system? Or does it mean that - say if they're Democratic Socialist - they'd prefer to have power to the proletarians over personally owned businesses? Or is there no space for centrism ideology in under the umbrella of Communism? Most self-proclaimed communists I know prefer to have an extreme ideology. Just trying to understand if anti-capitalism means abolishing the currency system or is it more forgiving than that?
Oh please, Cuba is about as democratic as North Korea. To not describe them as a dictatorship is a lie
The only men that support Communism/Socialism are gullible fools and tyrants.
Sorry, no offense, but you should make a new video...\nSocialism, and social democracy is NOT the same thing.\nhttps://spfaust.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/socialism-vs-social-democracy-whats-the-difference/\nThe main difference is that social democracy does NOT exclude private ownership and capitalism.\nAll the main very successful western European nations are social democratic, and are at the top of every Top 10 list one can think of, except maybe military spending and income inequality :-)\nBernie Sanders is a social democrat, not a socialist.
Loved it!
Those who say communism doesn't work need to look at tribal communities who have been functioning based on communist principles for thousands of years even before Marx was born.\nThe correction should be that Marxism doesn't work in big communities (like entire nations), but here we're already adding a particular circumstance into the equation, saying \"communism doesn't work under X conditions\". Personally having studied all classical political ideologies as part of my degree, I came to the conclusion that there is absolutely nothing in the world that \"cannot work\". Everything depends on circumstances. Just because Feudalism doesn't work today doesn't mean that it \"cannot work\". We have historically recorded evidence that it did work. Just because slavery doesn't work today doesn't mean that it \"cannot work\" because we also have historically recorded evidence of it working. Likewise we have historical evidence of communism working, but only in tiny tribal communities. What if we come across some new circumstances in the future that will force us to adopt Communism or revert back to Feudalism? Everything can happen.
Socialists, communists and Marxists are thoroughly confused people. I already knew that.
If the state owns the means of production, that doesn't mean the community own it.\nState capitalism is not socialist.
American congress is run by Big pharam/ Oil companys/Other lobbyists. fuck capitalism
There is no confusion we just don't care. Your ideas of economics are similar enough that we put you all under the umbrella of Red and we do not like any form of Socialism or other Red ideologies you idiots push.\nI don't even know why this was recommended to me. Sure I watch videos on economics and politics now and then but I was listening to music. And I see this and I am like \"Wowie this will be fun.\"\nWorst Roller Coaster ever. Hope no one gets swayed by this video.
\"Under capitalism, these factories are used for anything and everything that can generate profit, not for necessities that society actually needs.\"\n\nThis simply isn't true. Claiming capitalism is outdated and can no longer provide for those under it is so idiotic. Where does clothing, building material and processed food all go through before reaching the consumer? Unless you're arguing food, clothing, and shelter are not \"necessities.\"
I would like to add this as one of my sources but with it going by just an alias I can't. I know that the author's name is Mio Sidén. But who is Mio Siden? I suspect that he is an educator or news columnist. \n\nI wish he had also added the truth that the NAZIs, socialist, and communist are ALL based on the socialist foundation of collectivism rather the individualism as in individual rights are supreme that most capitalist countries are based.
Means of production is by a communist the work place. But anyone with a mind knows that a work place don't produce anything unless there are people working there. So the means og production are the people/workers. Control worker, wages and taxes, you control the means of production.
False! Socialism is that everything is free and payed by the government... \nThis guy has not heard of taxes or other fee's you have PAY! Or, you don't pay, the government steals it from you through legislation.
Sources?
Regardless how nice socialism sounds the results of it looks like a Venezuela when accomplished.
Socialism is not where the Means of Production is controlled by the \"community.\" That is a white wash. It is owned by the Government in the name of the Community, and the Government makes the decisions, on behalf of the community.

Cuba is a Military dictatorship, the Castro’s have never had a Democratic election ever, they have sham elections of course to pacify the public but the true results are meaningless and yes they have some socialist tendencies but to say that Cuba is a socialist government is bullshite.
You don't have a clue about this subject, do you !   What a joke !
\"Cuban gov  is democratic as in run by the people...\"\nAre you fucking serious?
Never forget IngSoc
So anarchism, which literally means without organized government, is communist, which is the idea of a government regulating every aspect of the lives of citizens?  I don't care how smart you think you sound, I'm not following.
The problem with communism is for it not to fail it depends on people being inherently good, hard wooking (or at least motivated), and selfless... all qualities the average person does not possess. \nAlso, Star Trek has a class system (militaristic hierarchy) and a government (the Federation), so they aren't communist... but I see where you were going.
The greatest misconception people have is the failure to realize that \"owned by the people\" is actually owned by the government. That is a select group of people with power over everyone else. Also, look up \"Iron law of bureaucracy.\"
You lost me at Cuba \"choosing\" a public run economy in which \"elected\" officials do the planning. There is no choice in Cuba, nor true elections as only one party is lawful allowed to exist.
So funny how people won't even discuss national socialism anymore because of Hitler but just because a lot of people don't know how bad Stalin was so now communism is still an acceptable economic argument. Why can't someone have pride in their country being a national socialist and not want to kill people at the same time? I think you can...??
I think you should be allowed to sell your grandmother for money
basically all are shit
The USSR definitely called themselves communist its in there national anthem look it up.
I like the idea of social democracy, a more social form of capitalism as some European countries have. The idea of welfare is and financial support provided by the government is ideally what would prevent dramatic differences in the classes. The idea of capitalism is more fair than socialism but has its own flaws of course.\n\nwith a balance between the two, and the elite paying fair tax rates according to their income, it sounds like a good recipe and far better than socialism\n\nbut like everything else, it always sounds good on paper and is implemented much differently in practice.
HITLERS DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM\n\n\"A socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his efficiency. Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxism Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not. Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, or efficiency; true socialism values the individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community, All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are False\"\n~ Adolf Hitler, December 28, 1938
Socialism and Communism are evil and degrade the value of the individual, his actions, and his thoughts in society in favor of an overreaching government that always suspends the rights of that individual in the name of what is “good” for the rest of the group.  Hundreds of millions of people have been killed by this evil ideology in the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
There's none. Even Fascisme is on the same ticket/brance. National Socialism..., does it ring a bell? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFPugvX4RcA
I can smell the american pigs raging out because Sweden is a Nazi country
Why do people think it's so cool to say stuff in German, especially if they didn't actually learn the language and can't speak it? Nobody tries to pronounce ???????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????? or anything like that. I can still hear Richard Spencer's \"Lügenpresse\" ringing in my ears.
\"The State\" and \"The community\" are two very different entities
Marxists-leninists are the worst impérialist s and oppressors. Plan economy can't make it work, the Chinese were organised because Mao used his Marxist ideology the red book and his culture to control people. It works in China because people follow the leader. Cuba was different because they used ideas of Marx to free the people from their misery, poverty and inequal society. However people can never be equal, it's a concept that we have in our minds. Some are rich and some are poor.
This is not accurate. I am anarchist and capitalist. There are other ways of understanding modes of living than this that are more inclusive. Regular maps of politics for example. (multiple axis). If you keep going like this I am concerned you'll not be able to accept others views and hate people different from yourself. Also, if you want to describe something, don't say it has no definition, then define it. People use words because they express something with value. Either it cheapens you as an individual or you as a socialist.
anarchism is as an ideology older than communism. so in my opinion it should not be a subgroup of communism. anyway it is an interesting text that explains well several political concepts.
personally i have listened to you people explain what communism/socialism is. i would rather listen to the founding fathers and their wisdom and views on socialism then some educate guy who has gotten his education from a socially driven agenda collage. consider the professors and teachers today who are far left pushing their socialist agendas, instead of the true history of this country and the true history of socialism, changing their teachings by inserting their socialist views along with their version of American history for people to make up their minds of which they want. democratic socialism is nothing but mob rule. communist socialism is nothing but an oligarchy ruling the masses. capitalism under a republic like in America lets people keep what they earn, not true in the other two forms of government. the problem with capitalism is not capitalism, it is the criminals within government who want to grease their pockets by passing laws that benefit corporations more then the people they swore to serve. this i blame on the people and their corrupt government for not stopping this criminal behavior. when a good working system becomes corrupt you do not change to another system, you fix or repair the system.
you have 1 angel on the right and a lot of pure evils on the left. that's all you need to know.
I've been having trouble getting a consistent definition for any of these, thanks dude!
While the definition of socialism as given is the \"technically accepted definition\", I disagree with it in that it is misleading with regard to what actually matters. What matters is not \"ownership\" but control .It doesn't matter in any real or practical or economic sense who owns\" a resource. What matters is who makes the decisions about how any given resource is to be utilized ... control .\n\nConsider a particular application or utilization for a resource. How exactly does it make any distinguishing difference in any practical manner whether that decision was made by the owner or made by someone else which is then imposed on the \"owner\"? The reason that \"ownership\" is used in the definition, IMHO, is that it was implicit that \"ownership\" connotes control .\n\nIn an economic sense, it is the decision that is made that creates the economic implications, not who \"owns\" that resource subjected to that decision. If the market determines that X should be produced with that resource rather than Y, meaning the people want X rather than Y, but the decision is that is imposed on the resources is that the resources should instead be used to produce Y, the people do not get the X they want. It doesn't matter who \"owns\" the resources, it's that the decision to produce Y instead was made and was imposed upon the utilization of that resource. The economy does not produce what the people actually want not on account of who \"owns\" the resources, but on account of who actually controls the utilization of those resources.\n\nWhich is why it's farcical when Bernie Sanders states that he is not against private ownership and not for state ownership. Well, of course, because he knows he can regulate those resources to serve his agendas, so \"owning\" them would just be redundant. The economic problems that would ensue would not be on account of who \"owned\" the resources, but who controlled the resources (by fiat and decree) in contradiction to owned those resources, disallowing them from being able to apply their resources as the market indicates they should be applied...such that they would then be applied to serve the people's wishes as expressed in those markets, as opposed to the agenda of an ideologue wielding power to control those resources.\n\n---\n\nI like the drawing (Cuba) showing the people indirectly controlling the means of production \"democratically\" through the state...as opposed to the people \"controlling\" the means of production essentially directly through markets, in that the people indicate how resources would best be applied to serve the interests of the people through the marketplace, and businesses are slaves to the markets. Serve the market (and thus the people) or go bankrupt. People bid up the prices in the market place for things they want, businesses (people) slavishly seek to produce more into those markets to reap the potential profits. People bid down the prices in the marketplace for things they want less of, businesses slavishly leave those markets - or go bankrupt producing that which people don't buy. Unlike government control which then argues that they need more power to yield better results - the reason they failed was (as it always is claimed) on account of some other villain which they must be grater ever greater power to combat. Of course they will never admit that it is impossible to centrally plan an economy. But a large part of the problem is in pricing by fiat and decree because a thing \"ought\" to cost no more than X, or people \"ought\" to be paid more than Y. To which people respond as illustrated above. The produce less of that which is priced less even if the people actually want more of it, and wastefully produce more of stuff for which they are paid more to produce, even if people would rather have less of that and more of the former. Which the central planners would know if they followed market pricing. But they don't because that's the point of it - they think the prices ought to be something different. If the people's signalling in the marketplace were to be used, then what would the central planners do? Except that the people won't get what the people want (assuming they get much of anything at all) because market prices, information, and allocation are not permitted.\n\nWhich is why socialism inevitably results in dictatorship as this is the only way to force a people to be subjected to economic planning that does not give them what they want. When people are not allowed to react to pricing and to benefit from reacting to pricing (producing what people actually want) the only way to get people to produce is to force them to work doing things for which the incentives and motivation have been eliminated or perverted. But if people were allowed to freely respond to market signals as they want to do, which would result in being produced what the people have signaled they want in the marketplace, then what would the central planners do. The only way to get people to do what the central planners think ought to be done rather than what the people actually want to be done and to do is to force them to not do the latter.\n\nWhich is why free markets, er, \"black markets\" always still manage to pop up everywhere people are denied them...forcibly. It is because free market economic activity IS natural human behavior. \n\n---\n\nThe accumulation of wealth is no longer the driving motivation. Ha Ha Ha. I love Star Trek but it is still utopian science fiction , at least in that sense. So at some point in time between the present and the time of Star Trek, humanity completely rewired the human brain ... and re-wrote mathematics to produce some alternate Game Theoretical outcomes. Apparently.\n\n---\n\nWell, yes, it does go against human nature. But more specifically, it goes against Game Theory (or more precisely, it produces results as would be predicted by Game Theory). And in that human behavior evolved as a sort of \"Game Theoretical computer\", yes, it goes against human behavior. Which is to say, it's not just impossible because of human behavior, it's fundamentally Game Theoretically impossible too. And that's before you even get to the immorality implicit in socialism.
\"The economy in Nazi Germany was largely free market capitalist.\"\nStopped watching there, this guy obviously has no idea of what he's talking about.\nIn Nazi Germany you were told exactly what to produce and how much by the government. Your business still TECHNICALLY belonged to you, but de facto it belonged to the government.
And what's in common to all of them? None of them have ever worked neither as an attempt to practically install the ideology neither as an ideology which defines in-depth concepts of human right, human economy, human freedom.\nTrue opium of the people is all that has come from Marx and his followers.
wow capitalism is so much simpler humans alway go for something they can understand easily.
This video is terribal. Really seems to muddy the watter. Can we aknowledge some core tenents of practice here? Ex. Socialism (generally) = the collective ownership of wealth secured by a central governing force, reasonable?
Please play this to the Dotard in charge of you over there. He doesn't the difference and obviously  just visualises Ivan Drago
People like to belittle things they believe are out of reach for them. Which in a communist's case money because they are too lazy to put in sort of hard work so they cry to the government.
There are no Nazis, offensive and derogatory term. Not now or then.
Every socialism is a piece of shit. In my opinon \"European Union\" a.k.a. IV Reich should be destroyed
in my opinion I just call them what political ideology they have. so in the school where I go, my teacher (not the homeroom teacher, and who I think as commie ) said Soviet union is Socialist after I said that the USSR is Communist country. \n\n\n\n\nFUCK. MY SCHOOL
Murica doesn't give a shit
Headache.
I am going to politely say that I do not fully agree, but I like the fact that you are addressing the question. Thank you.
Wow this is seriously idiotic
Then what's anarcho-capitalism?
ganders at the like/dislike ratio \n\n\"Well, it was obviously a hard fought battle, but I guess we've won, comrades.\" cue Soviet Anthem\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, your simplistic definition of Anarchism is unforgivable. It's Spain all over again, eh, Perfidious Red.
How stupid can anyone be to proclaim oneself a marxist?
Capitalism favours the individual where as socialism favours the group, I hate people so I'll stay as a capitalist lolol
How about similarities? Here's one: they all don't work and miserably fail
I mean. Social democracy, and the economic aspects of nazism, are pretty similar.
no matter how 'you' define socialism...its bad. anytime you have a group of people refusing to put into society but expecting to benefit from other people who do work you have a major problem...over time, less people work, so higher taxes and cost of living for those that do...and I believe Thatcher said \"the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peoples money to spend\" ...lazy, entitled garbage will always support free stuff and couldnt care less if others have to work 2 or 3 jobs to support the socialists. you can go F yourself.
Capitalism > all that other stupid shit
Socialism works at first, but overtime it can destroy an economy. Take Brazil for an example, who elected a socialist president. Brazil's economy was amazing before this, with foreign investors highly interested in it. When he was elected, he put in socialist policies and it worked at first, but then slowly started to destroy Brazil slowly. After a few years, Brazil was ranked in the top 20 countries to open a business or be successful in. Socialism is like a drug, it feels amazing at first, but then ruins your life slowly. Or in this case, your country.
30 seonds... -.- get to the point of the video... im gone. bye
Whats the difference in Socialism-Communism etc if the outcome is always the same?   Narrator has a very boring voice btw.
Cuba democratic? LMAO!!!!
what is your political compass. I am just wondering; not to comment on it, just to know what view this video was made from. Personally I am a Conservative, almost a John Locke view on government.
I'm a social democrat \n\nI'm for a social democracy
No, Anarchists do not count as Socialists. Anarchism can stem from the desire for a stateless, classless & moneyless society but it can also stem from individualist thought in the Anarcho-capitalist/Anarcho-libertarian/Anarcho-individualist doctrine.
This video should have Incorporated Nazism and Fascism into the socialist side.
I've never understood why people get so polarized and ideological on this whole socialist-capitalist paradigmatic opposition. In case you haven't noticed, our current capitalist societies already allow you to live your socialist dream. Nobody is preventing you from getting together with your friends and funding a company run in a socialist fashion. In fact, this already exists, it's called coops. In coops people can lead the company democratically making decisions on their bosses and wages. In Europe there are a few very successful examples of coops. There is a huge one in Italy called SACMI. In America you have the Amish who live their own theocratic anachronistic socio-economic dream. So what are you doing!? What's stopping YOU? Instead of trying to force change onto society for everybody else, why don't YOU get off your lazy bum and lead by example and create companies and institutions that run on the principles you believe in??  Capitalist societies are the best because they are also the freest. It is so free that it even allows for communist-style companies alongside privately owned ones, something that would be impossible if not punished by death in communist and marxist economies. This is such a non-ideological issue that you can have purely capitalist/socialist systems running alongside hybrid systems as well, where for instance a company has a democratically-run core, but hires some external people and contractors for functions that are not an inherent part of the company like secretaries or cleaning staff. Rather than reducing the range of things people can do, why not expanding their range of choice? Why not making different systems compete against each other? Certain companies might run better when run in one mode or another, why not give PEOPLE more choice on how they want to live private and economic lives??
That's a lie.\n\nThe NAZI Party was very much a socialist nation.
The nazi's called themselves socialist because they believed in the STATE should serve its people and the PEOPLE serve the state. Not that the PEOPLE should live IN the state like socialists and other leftist groups do.
communism... how's that going for ya? lulz
what is the difference between Democratic Socialism and Social Democracy?
Great video!
Your graph is missing such marxist revisions as Fascism and Hitler's National Socialism. They should fit near Social Democracy, the bourgeois invention. I would argue that they were less capitalistic than socdem, because they maintained the ownership rights formally, but the enterprises were in fact managed by the state.
BUT WHAT ABOUT HUMAN NAUTRE???????
All right, let's go:\n1- If socialism preaches the smaller state, why today the left struggles for centralization of everything in the hands of the state, including subsistence in many cases.\n2 - Where will the money come from to keep the population if there is no exchange between them?\n3 - Barter? Who will determine the value of things? After all, each item changes in value depending on the region where it is produced or drawn.\n4 - I am lazy, I do not like to study and I do not want to try, I will work sweeping street for 6 hours and doing a bad job. Will I have the same right and earnings from a neurosurgeon who dedicated himself and studied 20 years of his life to perform the function?\n5. And this surgeon will give up his deserved gains, without complaining, to benefit me?\nSocialism does NOT work! Vide Venezuela.\nJust to check, I'm from Brazil, a veiled socialist country, still trying to prevent this absolute change.
One thing that is undisputedly historically accurate and true as well about socialism is that all of the great genocides of the 1900's were perpetrated by peoples who called themselves socialists. What an ironic high price exacted in failed attempts for equality and human welfare. What a first impression it has made.
Why then Marx himself called as fully socialist ( althought utopian) guys like Proudhon or Saint - Simon accepting private means of production property?\nOn socialism vs social democratism u are mixing Up the orders. Social Democracy was socialist mass political action movement vs socialist as a ideaology so.u can be both socialist and social democrat.
Where would Bakuninist collectivism fit in here?
I fail to see why Cuba is a state run by the people. It is not democratic and it has a \"more equal than thou\" upper class that live in luxury. Sounds more like fascist or state-capitalist to me.
2:42 to 2:46 will never work, it is ignorant to think anything like that would work.
No system will ever work because the dishonest and corrupt make up the majority of the population.  Perhaps we should focus on humanitarian and spiritual issues to move things along because it's not the system that's impossible, it's the lack of integrity at the top of the tree.
All these are old. \nHumanism is new.
STARTREK DEPICTS THE CONCEPTION OF A STATE OF THINGS AFTER CAPITALISM HAS ACHIEVED POST-SCARCITY.\n IT. IS. NOT. COMMUNISM.
I \"borrowed\" you nifty vin diagram to use in a Twitter argument and the #liberals aren't really liking it ??. They don't seem to like it being told they aren't leftists
>nazis\n>socialist\n\nfuck off.
Sorry, but for me, this \"field of study\" I liken to the memorization of a 1950's vacuum tube catalog.
Socialism is when everything is owned by the state, communism is when everything is owned by the people. This explains why the national socialists of Germany hunted down and imprisoned communists as much or more so than they did Jews. The reason communism fails is because not everyone can do any job. Some people are better at running things than others, while others don't want to work at all. Eventually, the people who want to run things take control, and seize control of everything in the name of the \"people\", and so communism devolves into socialism. And socialism fails because the people who run the government want to keep the best stuff for themselves, leading to food shortages, mass poverty, and violence like we see in Venezuela. The one thing that China, Cuba, USSR, Venezuela, and Hitler all have in common is a dictator (Mao, Castro, Stalin, Maduro, and Hitler himself). All of them started out relatively fine, but as the government became more and more corrupt, conditions for the people become worse and worse. Sweden has not yet reached the stage of dictatorship, but there is certain,y anarchy going on with all the Muslim migrants causing entire neighborhoods to be closed to police, gang rapes skyrocketing, and general anarchy. Someone will have to step in and take control at some point, and then Sweden will also have a dictator. You say that Sweden and China are relatively free market, but that statement is laughable. China has a famous \"fire\" wall that censors pornography, anything showing the government in a negative light, and anything that could remotely destabilize government control. Sweden has a 50% income tax to fund all of the state-run programs. As we know in America, state-run healthcare is disastrous, look at the VA. Sweden's education program already tries to brainwash citizens that socialism is okay, and that the Muslim migrants causing such chaos within miles of their homes are completely safe. Anyone in Sweden who dares to speak out against the Muslim migrants that the government says is peaceful, thereby saying the government is wrong, is imprisoned for hate speech. This is not to say that Capitalism does not have its flaws, however there are far fewer than in any of the Marxist ideas that socialism and communism both stem from. This video isn't an explanation of communism, socialism, and Marxism, but a feeble excuse for a system that does not, and will never, work.
:) I'm giving the best simple answer to that, I was born in what was named The Socialist Republic Of Romania, and we're saying that it's ruled by the Marxist Leninist ideology and only it's aspiring to Communism, cos in Communism people will evolve so much so that they will not be needing to live under a State rules, they will be living one for each other just like in a secularised form of Christianity. At course, the premise for this would be the disparition of all of the Imperialist Capitalist State, and therefore to any threat to the pure, true Communism.
Sorry, dont want to upset anyone, but, as long as it is not what the german call raubkapitalismus (dont know the english term), capitalism is the only thing, that works with humans. I would even go as far as to say, that democracy doesnt work the way it is performed in these days, nor would it work in the socialist way... \nsorry, if you think Im wrong, but I will not give you reasons on why I think so, they are too many and to long to formulate, so it would not be read by anyone anyways...
capitalism sure as heck seems a lot simpler, maybe that's why it works better...
Wow! What a complete load of utter Communist propaganda.\n\nYou argue that everyone will come together and build barns for each other. Will they all come together to build a space shuttle? What about a mega hospital, how about a nuclear reactor? Sure people will come together for minor projects, not so much major ones that will consume significant amounts of their time. You gloss over the idea of incentives and imagination.\n\nYou gloss over a lot of answers to  the common criticisms of communism and socialism in general. Like the question of Stalin and his murderous impulses. You just leave that for the possible indoctrinated fool reading your propaganda to answer for themselves, and upset no one in the process. The typical Communist response to someone who points out all the failures of Communism is to say that they don't exist, and never have.... \"real communism\" just hasn't emerged. Anyone who buys into that idea is a fool. \n\nCommunism drags people into poverty (equity of outcome) and offers no way out..... at all. Not even theoretically. Capitalism may not be ideal and may leave some in poverty, but the chance to escape poverty exists..... for everyone. Equality of opportunity. We all have different abilities, disabilities, and ambition, Communism is about leveling the field to the lowest common denominator and punishing the most innovative and ambitious through equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.
still confused as to how the state controlling the means of production in \"anarchist\" or even \"classless\"
Governments don't pay for any of the benefits(give away programs) because government does nothing to produce cash flow like a private business does. Their entire income derives from taking money (taxes) from the people. You can word it any way you want but the bottom line is they all want to take from someone and give to someone else. You can also include progressive on that list.
Communist: We don't have money\nCapitalist: sO hOw Do YoU bUy StUfF?!\nCommunist: We don't, we obtain it based on need\nCapitalist: sO hOw DoEs ThE pErSoN yOu GeT fOoD fRoM gEt PaId?!!?1!\nCommunist: Again, they don't get paid.\nCapitalist: sO hOw Do FaRmS pAy ThEiR wOrKeRs AnD bUy ThEiR tOoLs?!!\nCommunist: They just get them if they need them\nCapitalist: sO hOw DoEs ThE pErSoN tHeY GeT tOoLs fRoM gEt PaId?!!?1!\n\n\nAd nauseum and ad nauseum
Some people also wish to distinguish \"market economy\" from \"capitalism\" (the latter characterized by a market where you buy and sell shares in companies)  and they do have a point.
Good content but the narrator's very nasal sound mixed with the pretentious British speech is preventing me to watch the rest of the vid. Why not just use your nice Swede accent, instead?
Castro runs Cuban government, not the 'people'
I really like the video and your website is truly a gift to the world. I'm not really sure if I'd agree that Cuba is a democracy (I also would consider western nations as corrupted democracies). With the single-party, its restrictions on other parties and dissidents, and generally just the way the political system is set up. Technically state socialists can be socialistic in my book, but only if they had a perfect representative democracy for the workers. Democracy is something easily corrupted though and either way I myself never trust the concentration of ownership by the state.
Just get to the fucking point
So capitalism is devided to social democracy and just-capitalism? Yeah let me give you a hint; if it's not called capitalism and just capitalism we call it socialism or communism.\n\nThat's why Bernie sanders and sweden are \"socialist\" from the point of view of a free market, small government guy.
both are based on material possessions and puts man at the centre of the universe ... check integral humanism.
The definitions he is using are not as clesr cut as he is claiming. You either predominately want the governemt to control your life or you desire the people to be in control.
fail. what a cuck
You make me feel smarter after watching your vids lol...
Holy shit. A video that actually accurately represents and differentiates these ideologies from one another.\nIt's so rare to see a person who is educated on these topics. Love you, keep up the good work and educate the masses, comrade!
whole lot of misinformation in this longer-than-it-needed-to-be video
If people could be trusted and don't act like spoiled greedy children communism would work out the best
Finally! I was waiting for someone to do this!
Not everyone wants to be \"parented\" by some suits at the top. The more you parent a society, the less they are able to develop themselves. Self-sufficiency comes from letting people learn how to survive for themselves. These polticians lack the intelligence and common sense most people have so I can't stand them telling me what I should and shouldn't with countless laws that aim to make a society idiot-proof.
You spelled nature as \"nautre\" in the end of the video
Decent video, and your presentation is really intuitively organized; so kudos on that. However, your definition of anarchism completely excludes anarchocapitalism, which makes up roughly half of anarchists and are nearly opposite to how you described anarchism as a whole.
Where the state exists = capitalism. Where government exists = capitalism. Where the wages system exists= capitalism.Where the buying and selling of labour power exists= Capitalism.
Socialism/Communism = a world of free access. Marx told you to abolish the slavery of the wages system. Do not confuse with the State run capitalism of the former Soviet bloc Cuba North Korea China etc bugger all to do with common ownership.
You are so wrong about \"anarchism.\" Let us examine the word using standard English construction rules.\n\nA) The root is \"archy\" from which we get monarchy, or governance by one person, or more precisely, one person and his or her descendants, maybe governance by one family. Anyway, \"archy\" means government or governance.\n\nB) The suffix \"ism\" means belief or ideology. Marxism, racism, Catholicism.\n\nC) The the prefix \"an\" means not or lacking. Anhydrous, ancephalic, etc.\n\nSo, put that all together and anarchism is an belief in a society which lacks a government but functions nonetheless.\n\nDon't forget, there are anarcho-capitalists.\n\nYou are actually subscribing to the standard false narrative the the political spectrum is one dimensional. You are leaving out the statism/libertarianism axis and everything you covered is crowded up at the statist end of that axis.\n\nThe ideal society is, in fact, an anarchy which runs on capitalist lines but has a means for enforcement of individual rights by any individual who is harmed by the actions of another. (While at the same time avoiding the excess lawyer and litigation trap)
Just read your website. You didn't answer your own questions? And can give a summary of what it said: blah blah blah I don't have any power, give me power!
Seize the means of production
I'm a capitalist, but this was very informative and explained things very well.
Your channel is for good for nothing communists
As best I understand it, none of the systems described here are stable in that any perturbation, when coupled with human nature, leads farther from what would be considered ideal. I do not have an answer for what could be considered stable, nor do I have an answer for what can be considered \"best\" by any nontrivial metric, but I hope that we can arrive at some answer before humanity destroys itself.
Correction. All paid for by the working class not the government. The governments sole job is to hold a gun to the working classes head to give their money to the poor.... Or lazy.
At points in my life I have been a self described Anarchist and I am intensely frustrated by this video's gross oversimplification and flat out incorrectness regarding Anarchism. I understand it's a complex and confusing ideology that would be difficult to explain without doubling the length of the video, but instead of addressing that like you did other ideologies, you just glossed over and gave a half baked explanation of Anarchism.\n\nThere are Anarchists who believe in a transition period, Anarchism comes from the same strain of Marxist ideology, but it is not necessarily under the Socialist umbrella. It's more of a Venn diagram where some Anarchists are Socialists and some socialists are anarchists, but not all Anarchists are socialists and vice versa. There are Anarcho-Capitalists, Democratic Anarchists, Social Anarchists.\n\nAnarchy suffers from a major PR problem because it's name has become associated with lawlessness, violence, and revolution. It doesn't help that the most famous proponents of the ideology are terrorists, rioters, and murderers of heads of state. However, I expect someone who describes themselves as a Marxist to help clarify and dispel the mislabeling of fellow Leftists, not contribute further to misinforming people.
And, yet, they all blow.
Excellent breakdown.\n\nI found it very interesting that you put anarchism squarely under socialism. I imagine there is historical reason to do so, but parsing the word directly, anarchism more or less simply means no state. The people I've met in the United States who call themselves anarchists are usually in favor of capitalism and the \"free market\", and staunchly opposed to socialism, which puts them at the opposite, far right edge of your diagram.
I don't know how you can still be a Marxist in 2017.
Please go to post-soviet countries like Belarus, Ukrain or Russia, and live there at least year. Then you can say how bad is capitalism (but you will not want to).
I haven't watched the video yet and I will edit things if I turn out to be wrong. It's just, ive got a feeling. I don't know what, like something is about happen. If that means what I think it means we're in trouble. Big trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say, we're not taking any chances...... Marxism is not socialism in anyway. The sad part is Carl Marx had to publicly state over and over again he himself was not a Marxist. Dumb people took what he said and made into their own thing. Something kind of same happen to Noam Chomsky. Ok I'll shut up and watch the video now.
I think the problem is that there isn't a hard line between socialism and capitalism. Regulations put in place by the public might force a private producer to hand over a small or large part of his profits, tell how and which products are allowed to be made and sometimes enforcing quotas, while still giving the opportunity to private producers to find their own market share within the regulations.\nIdeologies are hard to put in boxes because of how multifaceted they can be. And doing so would be unnecessary, discussing ideology is not about what to call them, it's about what they stand for.
Socialism always fails. Marx was a jew and in the letters to Engals admited that his system was bunk. it also was responsible for the bolshevik jew slaughter of 60 million Russians.  The only form of Socialism that has ever worked was National Socialism because the jew bankers and their fake money [that we still use] was eliminated and real money backed by the products of German labor replaced it. Usury and fake inflation deflation was eliminated.  The worker and  the Farmer was elevated in respect and the farmer owned the land outright and not taxed.  Could never be taken and only passed down to family.  \n\nThe major difference is that N.S. was based on a Strong Family is a Strong Nation. marxist socialism is pitting one group against the other so that all assets and authority can be seized  and held by a small group who also have a monopoly of violence since firearms are only with the state.  The common idea that the workers must rise up and destroy the middle class who are responsible for all the ills of society  is a telling example of the mentality and failure that results. \n\nProof of N.S. success can be seen in the incredible  economic recovery in less than five years and zero unemployment while building infrastructure such as the Autobahn and ports and railroads. This system worked so well that it was a threat to the international bankers and the system of debt based money and usury that we stupidly still use. \n\nSince everybody is equally impoverished with the marxist system and the state controls all aspects of manufacturing and production there is no incentive  or reward to improve the system thus the eventual degradation to collapse. This is well documented because of all the times it has failed and the examples are many. Socialists always claim its not true socialism as an excuse and Marxist socialists never seem to accept that it will never work.
In capitalism some people exploit other people. In socialism it is vice versa.
Anarchism isn't necessarily communist. Ancap and Ancom are both equally valid forms of anarchism.
Well anarchism isnt an economic system. There are many types of anarchy driven political systems though. Anarcheal (excuse spelling) comminism is a type of government which hasnt been seen since tribism was a major political system. The other part is anarchael capitalism, commonly known as ancap, which is the common human system which takes place after a revolution.
my brain hurts.
Wrong, Nazi Germany fits the defineition of Socialism, the government had control of the means of product, distribution and exchange of automobiles, firearms, and they had a Socialized Health care system.
So what do Sweden, Bernie Sanders, China, Cuba and the Nazis have in common? They all advocated/advocate that the means of production should be owned by the people (via the state). Or in other words, socialism.
since when is cuba democratic ? :D
The nazis originally were built on socialist foundations, hence why they called themselves socialist, but Hitler drove the party away from socialism and that wing of the party was annihilated in the Night of the Long Knives.
Fuck you marxist shit !!! Property right and freedom before all !!!! Bernie is a bitch
Wait ur saying Cuba is democratic?
Where would titioism fit in
lets face it, capitalism is not perfect and i wish people would stop pretending it is. We need something different, and we can learn from the failures of past regimes such as the USSR to create something better
The means of production will soon be electronic.   Domino's and Ford are working together to build self-driving pizza delivery cars.  What happens when that goes live?  Own the means of production, what happens when humans are NO LONGER INVOLVED in production?  What happens when it doesn't matter if you worked for it or not, food and clothing and medicine just happen because of machinery?  What's that going to look like?  Trillionaires hiring men with guns to shoot the poor people who just want to eat, or a garden paradise where there are no shortages, and everyone gets what they need because they need it?  What's it going to be, people?  It ain't going to be communism or capitalism, anyone reading this will survive to see those ideas become obsolete.
I like how you swiftly move from subject to subject.
u rarely hear the term mixed economy
Hey! I'm a fascist that was wondering about the difference between all these terms. Thank your for this explanation, though we may be on varying ends of the political spectrum, I still respect you for taking the time to do this.
The end sounds like propaganda
Now I can write my essay????
This video was cancer to even attempt to understand
socialism/communism/marxism/prog-ism/leftism/democrat-ism/google-ism  ==> collectivism\nCollectivism kills
Capitalist: testosterone.  Socialism: estrogen.
Thanks for the effort.
How can Anarchist be socialist? That makes no sense at all
i just checked this guy's website. made me puke. this guy is a full-time-typical-swedish-brainwashed-type of lunatic, talking about how socialism \"WORKED\" in the countries in which it was established. dude, you are talking just out of your own fantasy. i come from an ex-socialist state, and socialism DESTROYED our country. it brought with itself corruption, nepotism, horrific architecture, murdered intellectuals and political opponents, brought uneducated, uncivilised peasants to urban areas (by force), prohibited its citizens to leave the country or even to watch foreign films and listen to foreign music, propaganda was the only thing available on radio and TV, military service was mandatory, folks had to worship the leader etc. etc. how can this demented vegetable say socialism brought \"improvements\" to the countries in which it was established?! my country still pays the price for socialism today, as it couldn't cure itself completely of socialism yet. i suggest all socialists like him to maybe open some damn history books and go on a trip to Venezuela. they'll know, then.
how is Anarchism (you know the lack of a ruling class and each individual owns and rules themselves) a sub category of Communism (everything is owned by the state)? both Socialism and Communism a degree of services are owned and ran by the state, (from some to all) but in Anarchism there is no state!
Dong energy
How you tell if someone is a communist or a socialist: If you point to the failures of Communism, a socialist will say \"well I'm a socialist\" while a communist will say \"that's not really Communism\" (and vice versa).
Where is socialist republic in the infographic?
4:05\nThen, how do you explain that a total of two guys have had control of Cuba since 1959? And the fact that those two guys were brothers?
Socialism and like ideology are too evolved for people of today. If there is greed, socialism will fail. If there is pride in one self to be better than another, socialism will fail. Capitalism promotes human nature. It allows you to feed your greed, feed your pride. That's why it will never go away until you, as an individual, can be selfless.
I'm curious as to where libertarianism falls on your Venn diagram
am I the only one NOT political here?
Retard Logic:\n\nSocialist = Communist\nSo..\nDemocrat = Communist\n\nSame logic applied to Conservatives\n\nFascist = Communist\nSo..\nRepublican = Communist\n\nTerrible logic
communism would be great, but not in this reality
Social democracy is likely the best solution.
I'm going to say you don't know shit about shit because you just automatically threw Anarchy under Communism and Socialism. However Anarcho-Capitalists aren't Socialists or Communists in the slightest bit. You can't explain all these different economic structures in ten minutes. You need an hour at least.
Not sure I agree with the assertion that all anarchists are communist. Schools of thought like Mutualism don't advocate the abolition of money for example, whilst they do advocate for the abolition of the state.
Quiff: grumbles, with no enthusiasm sex-lexia.
Could you imagine the cognitive dissonance a typical Fox News viewer would have after watching this video? ??????
I'm somewhere between Social Liberalism and Classical Liberalism, and I quite like this video. I think it does a great job explaining the ideologies to my left and far left.\nI quite like Libertarianism, but think it's unsustainable.
when you say \"the state\" controls distribution, production, etc of factories, are you talking about the people (citizens) controlling the economy? or the state as in (the government & companies) controlling the economy for the people (citizens) or are your referring to both of them collectively as a whole as \"the state\" controlling the economy?
You're wrong, Anarchism is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Not on the left as you portray it
Bs
Where should we put the anarcho-libertarian? \nThey are heavily capitalistic, but also anarchist.
CGPGrey called, wants his videos back
It's kinda strange to put social democracy into the Revisionist Marxist box. It suggests that some Marxists worked the theories so long that they became capitalist again. The actual development was more that capitalists acknowledged that socialists hat identified some legitimate problems but disagreed with the proposed solutions. So they modified unbridled capitalism to fix those problems in their own way.
Think google was listening in on me again then recommended this video. \nCuba a democracy ??
At 4:08 you state that Cuba is Democratic and has elections, you further go on to call it Socialist rather than Communist. Total Shit!! Another Euro Centric moron splitting hairs between two evil systems and one evil troll.....Marx. Address your stupid videos to other Euro trash and not freedom loving Capitalists. Your divisions are meaningless to those who know and love freedom.
where does Juche fit in?
As a swede i know so many people who think sweden's not only socialist but even (and i'm not joking) a communist utopia.
Cuban reprisentative are not elected I lived in cuba.
CGP Grey is that you?
Where would Fascism fall?
Where does China fall into the infographic chart?
great video. However, isn't luxemburgism the revolutionary side of democratic socialism?
Hey Hello, I dont know a lot of the subdivision of this ideologies and after watching your careful explanation, I wanted to ask you if you could help me understand in what believed Josip Broz Tito, as I have began to have an interest on knowing how he kept yugoslavia together all those years, in advance thanks
Ive always felt like americas idea of socialism is often confused with Stalinism.. personally id probably be a social democrat.
\"No you cant sell your grandmother for profit\"
I got an anti-socislism ad before watching this.
Resource-based economies you monkeys. Socialism, communism, capitalism and almost all their variants are still monetaryism
All of these words could be replaced with degenerate
A true sosialist democracy would have everyone who want's to vote on some thing vote for it directly so there wont be any president's.
China is not capitalist, it's entire economy is controlled by corporations directly from members of the communist party, making its economy cronyism, but this is the natural state of communist or socialist states because members of the Communist party are in the position to benefit from controlling this state owned wealth. Despite the supposed difference between Soviet and Chinese communism they both share the same governing characteristics and only really differ on the issue of foreign investment and a liberal policy for citizens to form new business and the control in running them, compared to the tight control of the Russian economy the Soviets employed to meet their Five-Year plans, in China total economic Five-Year plans were the abandoned by the 1980s and now only target specific focus issues like development in speeding like specific regions. The Chinese give the pretense of allowing capitalism but it's a farce intended to dupe foreign investment which is by party policy either prevented from gaining a sizable market share or forced to partner with a local Chinese corporation that benefits the communist party over the foreign investment.  Current Chinese policy includes the widespread use of industrial espionage and mandated technology transfers in order to do business in China which steals billions of dollars from the world economy every year.
Its also a common thing for people to have no clue what anarchism is... QED... Regurgitating points other people make without understanding them does not make you correct. Stop playing identity politics, or the \"what people call themselves\" game, look at what the people want, what they do, their methods, and what their policies result in, and of course whether their principles stay true throughout this process. Now git to it... I recommend reading? shitloads of economics and philosophy.
Social Democracy??
Socialism means government control.  Get an old dictionary.... There is social communism, social Darwinism, social corporatism.  All of these governments evolve into totalitarianism.  The other side of totalitarianism is anarchy.  Constitutional republics are in the middle....  Rome and the USA are the longest lived governments.  (fighting to stay in the middle)....  Siding to the right or left....  Well, all things end....  The USA spilled a lot of blood in 1861.  Russia in 1920.  China in 1949.   The USA is split again...
I want to make sure I'm understanding your premise correctly. All Communists are socialists, but not all socialists are communists. Correct? Is that like saying all Ford cars are automobiles, but not all automobiles are Ford cars?\nI also noticed you didn't spend any time on differing ideologies contained under the banner of capitalism. Why is that? Or do you have another video covering the sub classifications of capitalism?
Anarchists are used to dismantle the ruling state in Communist revolutions. Once their usefulness is achieved they're either purged(Nazis killing their SA militants) or take over(Stalin being the poster-child of socialist anarchy). Communism is more often a cloak for undeserving and spiteful upperclassmen than it is an honest attempt at a class-less or state-less society.\n\nGranted, my assessment doesn't fit the theory behind socialism. But it is what has happened in reality to date nonetheless. Well, that and mass starvation. \n\nMy point being that I wouldn't classify anarchy under socialism without some descriptive term like \"cat's paws\" or \"useful idiot\".
Thanks now I understand what people are talking about on the news
What you are missing is that socialism, regardless of its degree of socialism is spreading throughout the world and the UN, and EU's plan is to push for a global socialism with socialist ideals for all. In the US Obama pushed hard for socialist ideals and many cities and states are being run by socialists, and the schools teach socialist ideals as the schools system is heavy socialist as in run by the state. Many Americans do not want to turn the US into a socialist country while all those Obama followers are eager to put in to practice his message of hope and change and equality for all which are all socialist catch phrases. Here they call themselves PROGRESSIVES, and LIBERALS, and they all sit on the left.
what about anarcho capitalists?
\"Donald Trump talks about China, particularly the People's Republic Of China\"\n\nAre there other China's I don't know about?
Capitalism isn't a system or an ideology, it's a product of human nature. The want to trade goods and services on mutually agreeable terms that benefit both consenting parties
Capitalism will be what brings us to an end. Never have been so much idiotic people that follow blindly such an idiotic doctrine. \n\n\n\nIf you ever wonder how many dumb people there are and why there isn't real progress with humanity (only materialistic which makes is greedy) then look how many capitalistic countries are in the world.
They're all a bunch of lazy minority hating bastards if you ask me
I feel you did a good job explaining the socialism side but not the capitalism side, for example libertarian views versus democratic views on economics. Which can be a pretty big deal
all the shit on the left doesn't work... trust me I'm from Venezuela. Capitalism and Social Democracy are the way to go
I like my socialist Canada!
Bernine Sanders was Demcratic Socalist
So... I can say that all Marxists are Communists?
I think you should be more careful with anarchism because they land in the communist aura (Bakunin's relationship and exchange of ideas with Marx for example), in the capitalist aura (the Austrian school), and outside of both auras.
Communists call themselves socislists because communism is a form of socialism, Hitler called his party socialist because that was what was popular at the time.
I wish everyone in America sees this video. If everyone watched this, right wingers would stop calling Bernie Sanders a communist, and if they still do, then they are just have a cinder block for a brain.
After watching this video and reading tge website I feel like I know where I stand politically
0:40 lol. can of pesto.
Scandinavia is like right between the 2 parties.
\"Cuban citizens >control> cuban state\"\nayy yo hol' up
Anyone who thinks Nazi Germany had a free market is so sorely mistaken.
anarchist believe they can govern themselves. they are right wing no government control. you fucking said the anarchist want communism.... no they are communist lmao
One thing they have in common: they all fail.
Cuba is a smokescreen. It would have worked better if USA wouldn't have had an embargo operating on it.
Quick thing about Norway, Statoil, the giant that brought Norway to the  1. economy from the war torn state we where in are 70% state owned. Before that it was 100% state owned. It litterally means state-oil.
Why shit where people eat. What's with the fucking foul language? There's a little but it's quite stupid and a real waste of intellect.
Pick your poison , any type of left wing ideology is based on stealing where the state puts a gun up to your head and takes your money to give to people who didn't earn it. It''s not just wrong in practice it's wrong in theory.
Just to let you know, though the German during WW2 called themselves the National \"Socialists\", they actually very little Socialistics elements in society.
Okay, so, I enjoy the idea of being a millionaire one day.. which by definition you could not be in a socialist society, because everyone would be getting paid the same average, no matter their title or maximum hours worked or business acumen. However, I strongly believe education, medical services, AND medication should be covered in our taxes via socialism. Does that make me a Socialistic Democrat?
If Marx left a lot of his work unfinished how come his last words were \"GET OUT! Last words are for fools who haven't said enough\"
Triggered you did not mention Finland :D
All the same they all wanted that coughing fool to win.
Hey man, would you mind activating translation for this video? I get loads of questions regarding the difference between social democracy and socialism and this video captures the answer quite perfectly. I would like to translate it into Arabic, but don't have the translation/subtitles active.
Ancient China had state owned monopolies on key industries such as iron, iron tools, iron pots, salt, and a few others.  The objective was to eliminate profits for the social good.  Unfortunately with no competition there was no innovation, so there was almost no technological progress in these industries for over 1000 years.
Great video, perfect explenation
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK YOU FUCKING FOOLS.
So there's no such thing as pure socialism? Socialism is just any form of government that fits under it? (Communism. Anarchism. Marxism, etc.)\n\n\nI've always been confused on that. So what exactly is a pure socialist? Is there a pure socialist, or is socialism just a base for a REAL form of government?
My favourite way of understanding the differences between political ideologies is placing them on a grid akin to what Political Compass uses. The y-axis, from positive value to negative value (as in, +8 to -8), represents the degree of control the state has over social and cultural matters, and the x-axis, from positive value to negative value, represents the degree of control the state has over economic matters.
this is WAY too much nuance for the American voter.
Cuba is Democratic? This video loses credibility for me.
\"How socialism could work\"\nHa, good one.
Actually SJ and Systembolaget is NOT owned by the state. They were, like so many other companies, sold of when the right wing was in power.
Star Trek is actually a post-scarcity society
Quick summary, \nCapitalism - anyone can make money if they have have the skills and ambition.\n\nSocialism - you are forced to pay to pay for whatever the government does and you don't have a choice.\n\nCommunism - the government takes your shit and say's you should be happy about it while keeping the money for themselves.
COMMUNISM.  Marxist communism was not actually anti capitalistic. He actually supported free trade and wrote about how capitalist society continuously  improved the lives of the poor. What he meant by 'Capitalism' was the end result would be the means of production would end up in the hands of the few and they would then own every thing and no one else would have a chance. \n\nThe revolution Marx spoke of would be were the down trodden masses would rise up and seize the means of production and over throw the existing order.  After the revolution it would require a dictatorship Marx called \"the dictatorship of the proletariat\" which would divide land and industry fairly between the people, this is where thing start to go wrong. \n\nThe dictatorship of the proletariat requires a small group to be established and with no law and order that group will be the most back stabing, double crossing, vicious, violent, psychotic, manipulative, self serving, narcissistic   of the revolutionaries because they are the ones that always get to the top [please see world history for detail]. Can any one be surprised they have just been going around murdering whole families and any one who get's in their way? \n\nOnce they have established their \"temporary\" dictatorship and have seized control of literally every thing and moved into the palaces, who's previous owners they have taken out side and shot, they then have control of every thing and once they have that they will not let it go. Because they are the worst of all people they all know each other are the worst of all people and the very worst of all those people will rise to the top. Once there he will realize that the people who surround him will all double cross him and set up a system  where he will control  those people through pure fear and that system will expand out into the  whole nation creating a system of total terror. And that is why for all it's great sounding intentions communist revolutions always descend into total oppression, tyranny, slavery and misery.
NAZI GERMANY WAS REVISIONIST MARXISM. Nazi Germany was not capitalistic and certainly did not have a free market it was a revisionist Marxist movement that saw the failures of Soviet communism and diagnosed that for a socialist state to work would require at least some private ownership and economic enterprise. The economy was controlled by the state, the banks were nationalized, and corporations were run by state appointees and were run for the benefit of the nation or \"the greater good\" and no depressions were enacted with out approval of the state.  Nazi Germany was a out and out socialist state and went wrong for the same reasons every other attempt at socialism went wrong.
oh look! another...  ''They weren't REAL communism''  ....naive delusional utopia leftist douchebag!!
Very interesting, thank you for this video, I was always confused about what socialism actually was
Nice Vid.\nDig the multi colored bar graph. Great explanation of general terminology.\nTZM
Excellent video and basically as Marxism dead before this work was finished other people have come along and turned it in to what ever best fitted there personal agendas.
Palme kallade ju sig Demokratisk socialist. Tycker du att han faktiskt var demokratisk socialist om du räknar in att Kjell-olof Feldt var liberal och att han styrde det tyngsta och viktigaste departementet.
Is there a video why communism didnt work?
OMG could it be... a Liberal who uses actual facts... and talks in a calm intelligent manner wow I did not know they existed
Obamaism is a form of Marxism
Thank you for clearing up what socialism is. I will no longer call myself a socialist because I do not subscribe to tyranny. Cya!
The genesis of the concept of ‘Equitism’ as successor system to the present, capitalist system of political economy was linked to several connotations of this term.\n\nThe term ‘Equitism’ has name-resonance with that of the tradition of “Equitable Jurisprudence” in Anglo-American law.\n\nGrowing out of the “Crown Chancery” in England [the Office of the Crown “Chancellor”], there emerged separate courts of equity, or “courts of conscience”, to which appeal could be made from judgments by the courts enforcing common law and statute law when a defendant held that a judgment rendered by a common law/statute law court, while in accord with “the letter of that law”, represented a morally inadequate remedy, and thus violated “the spirit of the laws”, therefore, per that defendant, failing to deliver “true justice”.  \n\nIn the U.S., the two, separate kinds of courts where merged into one, and the convergence of their principles begun, with U.S. courts “presiding in [both] law and equity”, and allowing “equitable” arguments and remedies, as well as “technical” arguments and [strictly monetary] remedies.\n\nThere have also been homologous developments in the traditions of Napoleonic/Roman law.\n\nIn recent parlance, the term “equitism” is often used to refer to “gender equity”, as a “synthesis”, or “mean”, of feminism and ‘masculinism’.  There was, earlier in American history, an individualist “equitist” movement for the amelioration of property rights injustices.\n\nBut most importantly, the term “Equitism” is meant to invoke the concept of “Capital Equity”, and the tradition of “Stockholder Democracy” [“one-share-one-vote”] that follows from it.  \n\n“Capital Equity” rights -- rights exclusively reserved to owners of capital [of “capital equity stock”] -- are seen as a “first [and inadequate] species”, and a first modern seed, of “Economic Democracy”, as distinct from “Political-only Democracy”; as the embryo of a more extensive and all-citizens-inclusive form of “Stakeholder Democracy”, and of ‘Political-ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY’ as a whole.\n\n‘Equitism’ is seen as “generalized social equity”; as “generalizing” social equity, to beyond the small class of the owners of capital equity, to encompass the whole society, including every citizen, by constitutionally endowing each citizen, by right, with the ownership of several new kinds of equitable “property”.\n\nThis “generalization” of equity is seen as a remedy for the catastrophic but predictable, “lawful” tendency of capitalist “political-only” representative democracy, to degenerate into totalitarian, state-capitalist, police-state dictatorship, as capital, hence political-economic power, continually concentrates into ever fewer hands, as we are now seeing so egregiously today. \n\nThat concentration of capital-equity ownership eventually enables those “few hands” to prostitute -- to ‘“buy-out”’, in a ‘“hostile takeover”’, via an all-pervasive system of bribery -- the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of political government. \n\nThis ultimate “M&A” will thus totally defeat the constitutional “checks-and-balances” designed to prevent this degeneration, and that were at least somewhat effective in doing so during the earlier phases of capital accumulation and concentration.  \n\nThe ‘Equitist’ reform/revolution is a ‘generalization’ of “Capital Equity”, forming a social ‘genus’ of Equity, by adding several new, inclusive ‘species’ of equity -- e.g., the [collective property] right of Citizens’ Externality Equity [implementing the so-called “Coase Theorem”], the [personal property] right of Citizens’ Birthright Equity, a totally portable, unified social safety net for each citizen born, and the [“individual property”] right of Citizens’ Stewardship Equity, granting access to means of production for, potentially, every citizen -- granting such access to citizens’ self-organized producers’ cooperatives that promulgate qualifying business plans, and that successfully enlist a Social Bank, also a Citizens’ Stewardship Equity cooperative, to back/fund that plan.\n\nFor more about these ideas, see --\n\nwww.dialectics.org\n\nhttp://www.dialectics.org/dialectics/Applications.html\n\n\nMy blog on this subject can be visited via the following link --\n\nhttps://capitalismsfundamentalflaw-wayforward.blogspot.com/2017/08/genesis-of-concept-of-equitism-as.html
\"Cuba is democraticly run by elections\" HAHAHAHHAHA
Very simple, very basic, does not iclude all varietis of Socialism, but a very good explanation of terms that unfortunately most people still don't understand. Thank you and fuck the capitalism. Power to the people.
You forgot to mention Titoism, that is self-managing Socialism. A very good video, by the way.
Commies are coming to YouTube? Those that try to sell Marxism should go live in Cuba for few years.
So was the free territory communist?
Great Video!!
Interesting explanation
Acquire a pop filter please
WERY GOOD explanation :D\ncan u explain resource based economy next ?
???????
Butt-hurt Right Wingers finally realise the truth and utter bullshit behind their preaching i.e. calling anyone even slightly left wing a commie
There are three kind of communists:  brainwashed, brain-dead, Jews.
I like communism in my bread
I still do not get it.I searched Google for everything, even looking for cows as examples, and still have no clue what Socialism, Communism and Capitalism mean. Can someone please explain as easy as possible as if Im 3 years old.
Do this for the Syria conflict

Good but you got Anarchism on the wrong side. It just means no government or politicians. If anything, it is form of Capitalism.
There is no democracy in Cuba! They have one party and in casa there is an alternative it is the regime that chooses and approves of the contendant

I believe you've made a mistake in placing all forms of anarchism under communism. All forms os anarchism are, yes, socialist (except anarchocapitalism but thats an oxymoron), BUT not all are communists. Take the mutualists for example, they are anarchists who believe in a socialist market economy, and do not strive towards communism. Or take the collectivist anarchists, who believe in the existance of money in their society, and also do not advocate directly for communism..\n\nOther than that, great video. I lovd it!
This is the video that radicalized me. Thanks, comrade.
4:20 Heh, dong energy.
I have to say I don't agree with your views but it was nice to know the differences between socialism and all the other things so I do thank you for this video
socialism vs nationalism next
You are a gift to the world.
\"Cuba is Democratic.\"\n\nMe: \"PSSSSH! HA HA HEH HA!\"
new screen 3/4 it is not comfortable
That provided link in the end, can work only on retards who don't understand basics of human interactions and economics, and cowards not having courage to deal with reality of their incompetence, while desiring a seemingly free meal at the expense of somebody else. Disgusting.
Are you a Jew?
Please tell me how Venezuela wasn't real socialism and how your system isn't fucking retarded.\nAnd don't ignore the fact that empirical data shows that it fails 100% of the time.
Thanks for the video comrade.  It's difficult sometimes getting bogged down in political theory.  Spend too much time reading and you get accused of being a soft bourgeois academic.  You begin to wonder if you should bother spending your time educating the Lumpen, or if you should take a seat among the Vanguard and accept that the most you will get out of your revolution is silent acceptance of the masses.  I still however have a lot of hard feelings surrounding the actions of the 3rd International, especially in regards to the sabotage of the class war in Spain, and the betrayal of the Partisans during the \"liberation\" of Poland.  We must be careful not to use people simply as a means to an end or else the construction of socialism will be without humanity, and ultimately meaningless.  Any other videos or suggested reading?
This video is so logically inconsistent. Socialism is a system of economics in which the government extends the purview of taxation to include that beyond services such as military, police, and the judicial system. That's it. You got healthcare paid for by the government? Socialist policy. Education paid for by the government? Socialist policy. If an institution is claimed by or has wealth redistributed from or to by the government, the policy is social, and if all possible policies follow this exact same principle it is considered a socialist state. Furthermore, it always fails to be as effective as a truly capitalistic society. Communism is simply where private property is disallowed entirely. So in left-right economics you have \nCommunism->Socialism || Centrism || <-Capitalism.
Sorry you lost me at 'and the state is democratic' referring to Cuba.
Shit vid.
They all exist under the idea: \"I know how you should live your life and how much you deserve to have, so I'm going to force you to do as I say, or else\". They're just different shades of evil.
This is all bullshit. Places like Scandinavia may claim they are capitalists and pvt owned, but that is complete BS. EVERYTHING there is controlled by the govt, and foes far, far beyond laws and regulations we have here in the US. Please people....
Finally! Someone who explains this perfectly! It took me ages to find this video, but I am glad I did.
Problem is not politics, it is people who run said politic, they get greedy for power and riches, and they become corrupted.
Lol at the Cuba being democratic.
Its moronic to think that Nazi Germany was capitalist cmon
I know so many people who need to see this video
I do think human nature fights communism, we are not bugs, we want land, mates and resources. In that why if their a disaster in an anarchy then the hording shit head will suddenly have power over a now devastated population, and he would take power because humans are naturally a greedy and power hungry, it human nature to seek wealth and power. In that way a Communist society could work under an oppressive and cruel dictatorship, and It would work. We are Humans not Ants so communism will likely never work for us. Capitalism to me seems fairer, though corporatism is a joke, and their is a difference like Socialism to Communism and Marxism to Anarchism
Every society has and needs some form of socialism.  That being said; The less socialism the better.
content is good but i don't know how derivatives can be expressed as a contained individual units. While communism derives some of it's property from socialism, i just leave it as branch or a sub-tree rather a contained unit. Because when you read the chart, it look like  socialism contains all the property of communism which is false.\n\nP.S: this is my opinion, as i have no way of proving it. \"Social democrat\" is what Bernie used to refer his ideology has or to be more specific his policy like single payer healthcare and tuition free college. If you stop and think about it and apply the definition of socialism into this policy, where policy = system, which is in-turn funded by public money but at the same time it does not impose anything on corporate body who invest in this business. Hence his identity.
This dumb video is a socialist propaganda. Do not believe on it. Nazi, Bernie Sanders, China and URSS had a LOT in common. Nazi germany was NOT free market.
Ew commies
Stopped watching after you split Marxism in your own way. Marxism is science and it is split inside academic discourse, not political one. Orthodox Marxism is not a political course. Revisionist Marxism according to you is umbrella term so vague that it connects soc-dems (traitors of the 2nd international) and anyone who added something to Marx. I'm surprised you didn't include an-caps who attribute absolute nonsense to Marx, because by reasoning it would be valid as well...\n\nSoviets were democratic, and nothing but democratic (I would add until Stalin came, then it all turned into a bureaucratic monster). The word soviet itself means council ffs
Better dead than red
The speaker broke it down more where I could understand it but I do know that Capitalism is a selfish system
Well what do you call a Government like the U.S that provide housing and Section A for its people what is that under
Yes, having lived for the first 10 years of my life in Communist Poland, I am certain we were heading towards Star Trek. Not.
Great video indeed. If you monitize this channel (ignore if you don't), I urge you to share, since you are a socialist, all the money you get from this channel to your viewers or at least the subscribers. After all, you can't generate income without the views. We are putting our time, effort and resources to watch this. So in a way, we are part of it. Give everyone their fair share.
Most western European countries have states that sontrol 40%-50% of the economy, and regualte much more, so I'd say that they are about half Socialist, and a great deal in social policy - mass immigration, multiculturalism, political correctness, same-sex 'marriage', legalised abortion - all much too Commie as far as I am concerned.  One day the Right or Muslims wil tke care of them!
so what is Kalimist or Ochlofist
The comunist revolution is never going to happen, it failed, capitalism forever
The one thing they all have in common is that they're all retarded
Except as my dad told me. They use words that has absolutely nothing to do with their true intentions, it's just a lie to get voters misguided. The Nazis didn't call them selves nazis and instead what you said here. But they had nothing to do with workers or socialism at all
I believe you got the chart totally wrong, but still a good video.
Thank you very much, very illustrative. Sharing... now
you love the state and the state can't be corrupt like the fat man that you pose as a capitalist. Why can't some people understand that a capitalist can be corrupt and the state can be corrupt? If you have a corrupt capitalist then you get shafted for some money in a narrow part of your life. IF the government is corrupt you go to the gulag. Which is worse?
This was interesting, even though I don't believe in it.
Cuba is a dictatorship, I don't think the people run it... it's just the dictatorship
I need to clarify something. The cuban people don't own smithing. Not even theit homes and they dont get to deside anything. The people vote in elections but just to shoose the leader of their town. And thats it. Thats why castro always gets reelected. First fidel. Then raul and next it may be his son alejandro castro. Its a dinasty. Cuba is a comunist dictatorship no doubts about that..... Im cuban by the way??
Wow a person with a brain.
[4:00]  Cuba is not democratic.  It is Autocratic. Geeze what planet do you live on?
Let's get 2 things in order. 1) Cuba is not democratic there is only 1 person to vote for on the ballot. 2) Democratic socialism doesn't have a definition as social democracy has fully replaced the word according to Merriam-Webster
Cuba com eleiçoes, hahahaha. Venezuela é uma democracia! Hahahahah video is shit
Bottom line:\nSocialism= Collective\nCapitalism= Individual
Rlly? Cuba?\n\nSo how would you explain the extensive period of time wich put Castro on top?\nWow, wtf people reads nowadays...
Who cares what Cuba or any country calls themselves. Look at their policies to determine what they are.
2020 Revisionists, Fascists, Nazis, Trotskyites, Social-Democrats, Anti-communist, Neo-liberal, Anarchist-capitalist gave I don't like video.
Social-democracy is socialism for the rich.
Anarchy or anarchism is not only communist but also capitalist, where people rule them selves and take rather than produce. When a communist version is a dystopia the capitalist version is like the purge. The diagram used in the end of the video fails to show that anarchy can spill over to capitalism, a circle backs chart would do much better
You so efficiently slid past the main problem with marxism. The required transition. Dictatorship by prolitariat means a removal of those currently in power, but also there has to be a leader of the people, and this leader of the people will often  use the same means on the people that he had to use on the leadership classes during \"transition\".  We see this time and time again.   If America wanted to transition away from oil, the transition in a marxist society would be forced on the people by military and secret police, and because those ruling do not necessarily have the education or skill to procure such a transition, society would suffer.  Even if stalin didn't kill people on purpose he still would have lead to a ton of suffering because of how his government blundered industrialization and agrarian realignment.   People are stupid but they want choices, and if you take away choices they will rebel, and if they rebel you better have means to give them choice or squash them.  And the default mod for most pluralist socialist societies is to squash.  You cannot count northern europe because they are homogeneous, isolated countries with little to no diversity, and little to no popuation.  If everybody looks the same, thinks the same, worships the same then marxism makes sense.
Hilarious.  I love our youth.  It gives me hope.
You spelled community wrong :P I like this. I think I'll join. Very much how I try to explain things myself but this video does it better than me.
This is such a skewed perspective on something that should be educational, but I guess it's impossible to get a completely unbiased lecture.
\"Hey guys, Nation Socialism was actually Hitlerism. That's why it failed. Let's try it one more time, I think it will succeed.\"
These people on the right keep using \"cultural Marxism\" but they don't know what it means.
Socialism fails and will always fail because it has a fundamental flaw in it's core. It always strives  to achieve  equality of outcome rather then to provide  equality of opportunity.  No amount of tinkering with it  can fix this.
In Cuba there's a dictatorship. People count nothing!
Every \"Communism/Socialism/Capitalism\" video is cluttered college students that think they know better because they sat through an economics 101 class without falling asleep.
This is a bunch of bullshit semantics Thomas Sowell came up with the best definition: \"Capitalism is about having a free market for what you buy and sell, Socialism is about having a free market for what you buy and a monopoly for sell, Communism you can't buy or sell anything\" ... the reason why this video and definitions are bullshit, you can derived all you need to know from that statement, the question is who or what determines prices. The people or a person can own the means of production, but if the state imposes price controls what does it matter?
and let me tell you this  the Frankfurt school of thoughts or post-leftists like Foucault where kind of communist anarchists \nso ... yeah
youre not right about social democracy as revisionism \nbecause at the time that Marx lived there were already social democracy and was theorized  by Ferdinand Lassalle and at the moment it had alot of fans .
why not just get rid of the taxation system...
Selling my grandmother at a loss is really dystopian, I must say.
star trek is not class-less... are you stupid? STOP SPREADING LIES ABOUT STAR TREK\nyou have the 3 branches of starfleet... science, engineering and command.\n\nStarfleet IS A CLASS BASED CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM THAT REWARDS THOSE WHO PERFORM BEST. IF IT WERE SOCIALIST Or COMMUNIST, starfleet would have an idiot commanding a starship just for \"multiculturalism\" or to give everyone a \"fair shot\"....
this is globalist bullshit spin doctor bullshit. Most of what he says is propaganda in an attempt to bring a greater olygarchy
this video is full of lies and spin
in socialism the factory doesn't need till be owned by the state just that it should be owned by the People who works ther
cool, i think you pretty much convered everything.\nBut what is the meaning of the goat and and upside down star, and what is it doing there.... pretty obvious for a secret message
yea...that star trek clip hit hard. makes our life today seem primitive
The Chinese government are oppressive dicks
Anarchism and capitalism aren't mutually exclusive. As a Libertarian I have to listen to the Ancaps yammer on about who is best libertine society.
Socialism and/or communism will ALWAYS fail. Either the leaders will kill hundreds of millions of people or the country will starve the citizens and go completely broke. It is a complete FAILED ideology.
I found a typo on your website, a misspelling of decide. I am also wanting clarification as to whether other forms of socialism are really rule by the people if they are not 'democratic' socialism. How can something not be a democracy, but still not an oligarchy.
Star Trek is my political ideology
You forgot Ireland. Its political system is socialist democracy.
China is a communist country, not a socialist country, as it lacks provide welfare system.
Yay Socialism!
You know nothing john snow
wut?
shut the Fuck up nobody cares about your communist fanfiction
lol cuba isnt democratic. you dont know what you are talking about
Poor people in rich countries are poor for a reason. Communism is unfair, not capitalism.

The communist can of pesto wasent even a can
When the USSR was socialist and socialism and communism are heavy on goverment and you compare it to anarchy...
an caps are the only real caps get those Bernie fucks out of our realm
You missed one major thing about Cuba. That is they are the only people that think their elections are free and democratic. In the 50's, I grew up near the canadian border. I had a wealthy aunt and uncle who went to Cuba for years. They decided it wise to go in partners and buy vacation property with another wealthy couple that lived in Havana. Well, the land was taken over by the government. They, along with every other land owner lost their land to the government.  fast forward approximately 60 years. We are now allowed to go to Cuba and visit. The general public thiinks this is great. Unfortunately, when you go to Cuba, you are required to convert your money to special moneythat is not the national currency. This  pays the shop keeper a small amount and gives the largest portion to the Cuban government which in turn keeps the cuban people basically as slave labor. No country that practices this deserves to be called socialistic.  I was in Florida last fall and thought about going to Cuba but I decided I wouldn't support any government that kept their own citizens shackled.
great video. thanks for clearing up some of the politically driven confusion.
He forgot to mention the part where all the money goes to the Jews while the native population starves to death
Socialism is a broad term. Social democrats are also socialist and therefore the Nordic countries are socialist like France and Canada and almost all the developped countries.
I care so little omg
Marxism , communism and socialism rob  the human being of their individuality, privacy, incentive and your very soul. It requires a deadly totalitarian state to implement this absurd idea of equity and creates automatically a thought police among the population. Anyone who advocates any of these doctrines  needs to be shouted down and seen as a traitor and cast out of the U.S, and West in general. You have a long history of mass murder, torture, starvation and incarceration on your hands.
i always think of anarcism as \"no rules\" but actually, it's kinda what we have, if you really find the truth. so i wouldn't call myself an anarchist anymore.
All of them are State Capitalism, the government gets all the money to do what the government wants.\nThe Free territory and Catalonia are true communist societies.
am I the only capitalist here?
Marx would be rolling in his grave if he found out how the people are so quick to divide themselves based off of labels and how many different \"isms\" are controlling the people. \n\nNO LABELS NO DIVISIONS NO CLASSES
Of course Star Trek is communist, Because It leads to a bunch of reds dying horribly.
The difference is like shorting shit for different smells... -.-
Good, but one hair to pick with your definition of 'classical marxism'. Marx defines communism as the movement to bring about a socialist system, however you define 'classical marxism' as believing in socialism as a transitional period to a communist system, and this is false. It was Lenin and Marxist-Leninism that define it that way, with socialism as a transition to communism
Socialism: Doesn't work\nCommunism: Doesn't work\nMarkism: Doesn't work\n\nthere you guys go.
communism doesn't work
let's study socialism and communism..why? iT NEVER WORKS  oh right, it wasn't real \n communism or real socialism, they didn't do it right etc etc
socialism works until you run out of other people's money - IRON LADY OOHRAH!
why can't humans think of something better that takes the better from all ideas and makes the perfect theory
so your saying Scandinavia is not socialist. I get it.
anarcho capitalism?
What about the anarcho-capitalism ?
Just a heads up that the Anarchism you described is actually just a branch called \"Anarcho-Communism\", not all of Anarchism is socialist). Anarchism in itself would deserve an own graphic with all its subdivisions.
Equal pay for non equal jobs does not work, it would resort to everyone doing the easiest job there is because you get rewarded the same anyways
Lazy and stupid love socialism.
I would just like to say, great video! Really appreciate it. I do have a question however: why do people in the West call Cuba communist?
I'd like  to see a video on what exactly fascism is
\"...and on trees instead of leafs will hang the communists.\" \n\n- Polish proverb
You didn't include Mutualism. }:-c
Socialism is a monster which will die ~ Janusz Korwin-Mikke
You got something wrong: you don't understand the nature of anything you talk about outside your diagram. I don't even mean that harshly. You just don't.
Just took a peek at that little website... you give the CIA way to much credit. But nice try, we had the DDR in Germany and it failed despite being backed by the USSR and the CIA had to do jack shit.
4:00 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... wait you are serious? Cuba is democratic? Or are we treating it as democratic on paper?
Anarchists are no communists. Anarchists think that the people should destroy the state after a revolution. Anarchists also do not believe that rules are necessary. Leninists (like me) believe that after the world has become socialists communism comes automatically and the state \"dies\". Those functions of the state that are not needed \"die out\". So Lenin says \"The state as state dies\" that does mean that there is no \"state\" but does not mean that there are no rules and no functions that are similar to state functions  (organization of the production, police....). But in general you have done a good job.
In simplest terms, and with the proviso that no \"pure\" form of any one of these exists...\nCapitalism: you can own a company; if you do, you control it.\nSocialism: you can own a company, but the gov't controls it.\nCommunism: the government owns all businesses.
yugoslavia was almost same as cuba
Hmm I guess Im a social democrat then. Thx for the vid
are you retarded?
Anarchism is actually the complete opposite of Communism. A is about a stateless society, self-ownership and the autonomous individual. This is in absolute contrast to Communism in which the state aims to control most aspects of life including production, opinions and thoughts.
call it what you want they killed over 100 million in the 20th century. communism is more evil than nazism, islam, and americanism, and capitalism.
Read Gulag Archipelago
SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY!!! FUCK YEAH!!!!\nWait, canada sure seems to be social-democratic... Probably is.
2:14 - Big government, a sense that the individual must come second before the state, the idea that the production is owned by the collective (ends up being the state), roots in Marxist ideas, a general lack of knowledge in basic economy and a high failure rate.
Sweden is not a socialist country,  it's a capitalist country. Socialdemocracy
I'm more of a socialist of the national variety :^)
anybody ever tell you to not use the word youre defining in the definition.
heres a bit of irony i noticed, you called cuba a socialist nation based on the definition and also said they were democratic....how the hell can they be democratic when only one party is in control and the people have literally no choice. in addition to the fact that socialism as you describe it tends to lead to dictatorships. \n\nwhereas in a true free democracy you can vote people out and have a choice....however agreably small that choice at least in america is.
als alles wordt geproduceerd om kapot te gaan zodat het volk aan het werk blijft en je hebt er geen inspraak op. dan praat je over sociaal marxisme oftewel een communistische dictatuur. \nis niet duurzaam en ook niet milieubewust.  het beste is een op grondstoffen gebaseerde economie.  zoek maar op THE VENUS PROJECT by jacque fresco.
sexy learning disabilities wtfff
I see why you grouped anarchism under socialism and even communism,  but then how do we fit mutualism and that horrendous anarcho-capitalism into the picture?
I think this definition of \"ownership\" is a little vague. Most people understand (though may not be able to articulate) that ownership is the ability to limit access to, either legally as in legal ownership, or physically, as in possession. You own the physical space you take up, because no one may possess it without your consent or abandonment. You own your mind and thoughts, because you control the use and dissemination of the information and personality contained. With this in mind, we can extrapolate that there is only private ownership. Public ownership is an illusion. In Cuba the owner of everything, legally, is El Presidente. He has the final say in whether a building gets raised or the gates are opened. If there is someone in trespass, El Presidente's command can have that person arrested or executed. He may delegate that authority to others, who may themselves delegate it out, but the final say still belongs to the top. In the case of public lands, like in the US, the de facto owner is the custodian or ranger. They have the power and legal authority to limit access to the park or land. It may be \"owned\" by the public on paper, but there is/are a person/persons with ultimate final control, who are not necessarily answerable to the demos...
Socialists get the bullet too
El anarquismo es una clase de comunismo solo en un caso, el anarcocomunismo, en los otros casos es socialista
This should be watched by every American after the absolute brainwashing we all receive
dong energy
anarchism = \"I want to be free for like a month before my entire country is conquered by violent criminals with guns, essentially creating a society ruled by crazy barbarians with weapons\"\n\ncommunism = \"oh, you're the best engineer in the world? here is the exact same as we pay bob the trash man that never comes to work\"\n\nsocialism = \"oh, you earned that money? thanks. I'll take that to found 500 retarded things only 1% of the population needs. if you complain, youll be seen as ungrateful. at least were not communists\" \n\nsocial democracy = \"ok guys, we make a company owned by the state. the bigger that company gets, the richer the nation and lower the taxes can become. if it goes bankrupt... well... our people can try cannibalism maybe?\"\n\ncapitalism = \"earn money like you earn to be alive in the wild. survival of the fittest! oh, you can't work because you was in a car crash and is paralysed permanently? have you considered suicide?\"
Socialism doesn't work simple
You just called Cuba a \"democratic state\"? lol...please
Thank you. I'm not a socialist, but this answered some questions I really didn't even know I had.
Where's the Constitutional Republic??  Wasn't  Communism just a creation of the international banking elite?   Read None Dare Call It Conspiracy.
What they all have in common is that they all don't work
Cuba is not democratic.
The mere fact that is has so many varieties and flavors, proves it's a scam.
Fascism is corporatism, which falls under Socialism because the government controls the corporations which also mean they control the means of production.\nThe Umbrella: Socialism > Fascism > Corporatism.\nCorporatism is the illusion of a free market.
Anarchism should be under capitalism
So Hitler was a totalitarian social democrat with nationalistic ideology and Stalin a totalitarian democratic socialist with leninist ideology, but same scum... only diference is who they robed to sustain socialistic \"paradise\". Hitler robed other nations, Stalin mostly under his control.
I only watched your video up to the Cuba part, where you present outright false information. First the factories in Cuba are actually controlled by GAESA, an economic conglomerate belonging to the Cuban army and more specifically, the Castro family, which serves itself and not the people. Second, people in Cuba actually seek work in the very few private companies and \"paladares\" that exist in the country because they pay much better than the state, which pays around 500 pesos a month, (not enough money to feed yourself). Third, the people of Cuba do not control the government because you only get to choose people from one party; and if  for some reason someone from a different party decides to run for office the people at the \"oficina del poder pupular\" (where votes are counted) will just throw the ballots going to that \"undesirable\" candidate away (source: family members and friends who worked there). If you don't believe me, you only have to see what happened to Oswaldo Paya and how the government crushed his Varela project and then killed him. And I haven't even mentioned the Apartheid-like laws that exist in Cuba, that never seem to be mentioned in the so called \"corporate-media\".\n\n  It pains me to see that more than 200,000 people likely watched this and trusted you and your information. Perhaps you're not a bad person, but you are doing a bad thing. This video is a disservice to the people of Cuba and to democracy itself. If you ever read this, please inform yourself before putting out information that can cause great harm, and take some responsibility for your actions.\nKindly,\nA Cuban who lived in Cuba for 15 years.
i like communist jokes   but theyre only fair if everyone gets them.
Great video
Socialism: Because taking other people's money from them at gun point is a good thing... >_<
Have you ever talked to anyone who lives in cuba? From the amount of praise you are showing on socialism, I don't think you ever have.
You should've explained that Nazism is \"socialism\" in name only. It isn't real socialism because it doesn't embrace the world's working class. It's also not a government democratically controlled by workers. Hitler argued against Marxism.
cuba?  really?  they don't control who rules them, I call bs.
Go Communism!!!!
BUT STALIN
National socialism is very different then socialism
People in Cuba have control............. You're more fake news than CNN!!!
When Anarchists say they're all for Democracy.....
fuck you commies anarchy is the best
Nice, informative video. It's good to know your enemy. Better dead than red!
managed to make a video on socialism without being blatantly biased. well done. if it was me the explanation would be \"the bits under socialism are a bunch of retards g'night\" so well done for withholding your bias whichever way it goes.
damn commies
ok i wanna move to the 24th century.
Could you please mention a word or two about the 60,000,000 dead Russians from Stalin and Lennon, the 100,000,000 dead Chinese from Mao Zedong, the untold numbers dead from the North Korean Government and Cuban government. If you want to educate the public on Socialism please pay some respect to the ordinary people who paid with there lives.
Idiotic...
They are exactly the SAME MISERABLE SHIT
basically what is china then?
\"Most people agree that capitalism is an unfair system\"\n\nExcept that the opposite is true.\n\nCapitalism is the fairest system the world has ever seen: every person is paid according to the value they provide to society, and we have a welfare safety net for those who are unable or too lazy to contribute anything at all. People can choose the level of effort they put into their work to match their level of ambition.\n\nEspecially today, it's easier to start a business than it's ever been before. People are building business empires from a computer at home and an Internet connection. It's a time of enormous opportunity for anyone willing to work for it.\n\nCompare that to communist countries which have universally produced nothing but poverty, misery and death. Socialism and communism are concepts which have been tried over and over again, failing every time. You know what they say about the definition of insanity...\n\nThese days socialism is nothing but the refuge of children who are privileged enough to have time to waste, and lazy enough that they refuse to pursue any of the plethora of opportunities available to them. They can't be bothered offering something of value to society to earn a living or build a fortune, instead they're determined to find a way to be a parasite and live off the labour of others.\n\nThank god we've left the horrors of Communism behind, in the 20th century, and that the majority of our citizens are not dumb enough to make the mistake of trying that failed system yet again today.
\"Explained by a Marxist\" Fuck dude, at least keep identity politics out of the video title...
Marxist = Communist
socialism: where people are too lazy to accomplish anything themselves, relying on others to puck up their slack. thinking they are with singe kind of equality. however, they are just a burden on society, too far useless to get up and take what they want
Thank you I'm so tired off people call Scandinavia socialist! I mean for god sake if we were even close to communisim in the first place then our royal families would never exist.
SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK! that's all you need to know.
What do they all have in common?\nThey're all trash and will never come to America (if we don't elect another Obama)
So, can someone tell me all the sects of Capitalism now?
You're adding the wrong suffix to form the adjective of \"Socialism\" and \"Capitalism\". \"Socialistic\" is incorrect; in all cases it should be \"Socialist\".
- anarchism is not always socialist, it's simply a lack of structured government.  anarcho-capitalism meets this criterion and is very capitalist.\n\n- socialism/capitalism is not binary, it's a spectrum.  states can be more or less \"socialist\" depending on how much of the capital is publicly owned.\n\n- socialism works best when the populace shares a common ethnic background and is therefore more likely to care about each other (a necessary aspect of any public ownership).  national socialism is the only form of socialism that i know of which explicitly addresses this, which is why it's the only one that has historically not collapsed upon itself.\n\nstop being delusional.
In my opinion, philosophy and politics should be minimal (can you tell I'm a centrist?). Economics is devoid of philosophy and simply tells you what is necessary for a nation's economy to work. As such, I would simply have a mixed economy while implementing whatever is necessary to ensure the productivity of the nation's economy while reasonably guarding the rights of everyone involved while assisting people in need but not overtaxing the rich.
I mean the Nazi's pretty much were very socialist, if they control your company as much as they did but you own it in name is it really your company?
Lol i should have stopped at the \"free healthcare payed by the government\" part...
3:59 \".... are owned by the state, that is, the community as a whole.\" No. State is not a synonym for community. Your fallacy is showing.
Wrong....NOT PAID FOR  by the Government!  THOSE \"benefits\" are paid for by Taxpayers!  ALL are totalitarian!\n\nCommunism sucks!\nSocialism sucks!\nMarxism sucks!\n\nThey're still the same!   Totalitarian.
This isn't really accurate. In reality these are the various varieties of Communism/Socialism/Marxism... 1) There is the kind where you have a highly productive people with a cultural tradition of hard work, and you then cripple them with a bloated social bureaucracy and soft headed ideas. Then the Socialist government invites a bunch of foreigners in who do not have the same cultural outlook at all. The end result is the foreign invaders sawing the heads off of whatever part of the native population won't submit... 2) Then you have the kind of Socialism where everyone goes on hippie love spree of sharing and stuff, but no one wants to bother actually doing any productive work, and everyone starves to death... 3) There is the kind of socialism where the working class is taxed to give meaningless jobs to an army of bureaucrats and funnel money to a multitude of other completely unproductive social cases. This kind ends when the government grows so large and all encompassing that it chokes out and overtaxes the productive working class. Then it lives on borrowed money for a decade or three until the entire system collapse, and everyone starves... 4) There is the kind of Socialism where evil tyrants go around killing anyone that opposes their rule while trying to micromanage an economy.  Then the whole thing collapses and everyone starves... 5) There is the kind of socialism where a type 4 socialist country tries to reform itself before everyone does starve. But their understanding or economics is usually pretty screwed up so they try to emulate a type 3 socialist country and ultimately go back to a type 4 socialist economy.
Socialism in Real Life: Labeling a group as oppressors in order to justify hatred & violence against them.\nInsert: Capitalists, Bourgeoisie, Racists, Bigots, Jews, etc.
all you need to know about those three forms of ideology is they suck
So..... how do you explain capitolist anarchists?\nAnarchists that believe in meritocracy and government completely removed from the picture. That couldn't logically be comunism.
I don't get how anarchy has anything to do with communism, they share very little in their views.
What you neglected in your video is the relationship of the individual to the state, both in terms of taxation, freedom and expendability. \n\nAll of these items is what makes socialism of any stripe objectively stupid because of empirical results.
Well here's all you need to know about Socialism, Communism, & Marxism: They don't work.
great propaganda piece. especially when you talk about Marxism. Marxism didn't stem from socialism. they all stem, except of capitalism, monarchy which Marx renamed Marxism and other groups gave their spin, I.e. socialism, communism.
bernies not a socialist
You're still a Marxist freaking moron read an Econ book
how many came for luxemburgism
Anarchism is out of communism, and, of course, out of socialism.
Thank you so much for making an unbiased video that properly explains things
we need a balance between the two. for example. Australia is a capitalist country with some socialist ideology. we have Medicare and public schooling witch is all paid by taxes and you don't have to fork out more money to attend these things. which is a good thing. but lately the big power company's have been privatized and sold off by the government and now they can put up cost to what ever they like. to a certain extent. which is a bad thing.
Capitalism rules
the ideologies of Socialism as well as communism breed authoritarian tendencies within government. when you give the government that much power you are riding a fine line on total government control. that's not even to mention socialistic economies and their ability to destroy a countries wealth. read the gulag archipelago or listen to Jordan Peterson's lectures on authoritarianism to understand these ideas further
marx left a lot o his \"work\" unfinished.   ha ha ha.  He didnt work.  He was a leech who sat around begging for hand outs.
I can already tell this is retarded because you put anarchy in with socialism. Ok your IQ must be about 38.
socialism and communism are a cancer for humanity and nothing is \"free\" everything that is \"free\" comes from the peoples pockets in the form of taxes not the government.
NO BUT THEY'RE ALL THE SAME, I TELL YOU.
There's an umbrella term that he missed that encapsulates the major socialist states that failed or were involved in genocide. It's called \"Not-real Socialism\". The utopian socialism that hasn't been tried yet is the real stuff ;^)
You didn't talk about the so-called \"utopian socialism\" which is in fact the only relatively successful kind of socialism that have ever existed. Of course a non marxist one. By the way, Hitler was a socialist even though he didn't end up with private property because he was more interested in the military glory. He explained his intensions in Mein Kampf about stablish a socialistic economy and that was a part of his ideology as its name says. Nationalism and socialism has been the worst things that have ever happened to humanity. Sorry for my English.
This idea that Cuba has free elections needs to be challenged here. You present it as though candidates run in open and informed elections just like in Canada or the USA.
Why does this matter?
China under Mao .One of the poorest Country's Post Mao China --> Capitalistic China is now on the fast Lane
Dislike for misleading information.
social democracy sounds pretty cool
Thanks for the info.  I admittedly am not a socialist by any means and have always considered myself a free market purist (i.e. laizze faire capitalism).  But that doesn't mean that I'm not interested in a discussion with a socialist.  My question to you is a broad one, morality.  All pragmatics aside, do you believe socialism to be a more moral system of economics and social structure than capitalism?  Because one system is based on voluntaryism than the other which is based on coercion.  And if Social Democracy is the mixed economy that all nations should strive for (i.e. a market economy with private ownership but with a vast safety net), do you see any drawbacks to this form?  Thanks in advance for the reply.
Capitalism is the unequal distribution of wealth.  Socialism the equal distribution of poverty.   Communism or Fascism is socialism with a gun pointed at your head.  -- Brian Davis paraphrasing  Winston Churchill
Now explain different kinds of capitalism
socialism a giant theft program implemented by the state. creating a ever increasing race to the bottom as the productive members of society realize there is more money at the bottom then at the top. A socialist is a greedy, selfish, person that defends this theft and the eventual inevitable murder of innocent people. All while calling capitalist what they in fact are greedy.
Most means of production can be privatised with some regulations to keep them in check. But some means need to be owned by the government since the profit maximising point is far away from what's desirable for the larger population. Like private schools being unaffordable for the masses. privatising such services hurts society in the long run since an uneducated country is unable to support competitive companies. The best societies don't pick either socialism or capitalism but decide what the best position is for each means of production. This is why Trump is bad for America but good for the rest of the world... as long as he doesn't blow it up.
It's not the government that pays for benefits. They are not in the business of producing anything. Yes, they do provide services, but they are paid for by the taxpayer. Government as whole does not pay for anything. The simply administer funds they receive from the taxpayer. This is in an important aspect esp. because the idea of \"free\" is simply wrong and sends the wrong signal. Nothing is free.
self interest and self preservation are the most powerful forces in animals including humans .           if you think not , just shoot yourself in the head and prove it's not so !    BTW socialism is basically the ultimate in greed , a desire to have something without having to earn it .         karl marx whole life was an example of it , he was a deadbeat who never worked in his life and left a trail of deb and treated people like shit ,...he was a scumbag of the first order .                BTW , bernie sanders has that in common with marx ,he never had a job either!
Capitalism - Free markets where people have the rights to own land and create wealth. \nFeudalism - A system based on inherited wealth and inherited status. \nCommunism - A system where the state owns the means of production. The people are all treated equally and get an equal share to resources. \nSocialism - Somewhere between capitalism and communism. Essentially a system which has a free market element, the ability to create wealth and own land. This system however has a far higher redistribution of wealth via the form of taxation. This sometimes looks communist in principle as the state interferes a lot and more people are given a more equal share of resources. \n\nThe only system which works is capitalism with a taxation and regulation. This is a system which has balances and checks. There is also some redistribution but not to the same extent as socialism. \n\nAll of these models involve people. All people can be corrupted. Therefore the system which enables the greatest range of freedoms is normally the most successful. \n\nCommunism has always led to an extremely powerful corrupt government. \nSocialism is a form of capitalism. It also doesn't work in a globalised society as they tend to quickly run out of money and go bankrupt. \nFeudalism ended in the 20th century. Some still exist such as North Korea. \nCapitalism with taxation and regulation has been broadly accepted world wide. We see this via the form of globalisation. \nCapitalism is seen in America, Europe, India, Asia and Australia. This basically means the entire world has embraced this system.
5 minutes in - still complete crap. \n\nDon't watch this video.
Please do a continuation video about right wing also please, just to also explain social-liberalism, liberalism, and other parties
It would be nice if the video elaborated on some of the \"socialist\" nations. The video swiftly moves past Nazi-Germany which began as a socialist state and evolved into a fascist dictatorship. It also does the same with the USSR under Stalin, again another fascist state. Furthermore, the video speaks to the point that some nations claim to be \"socialist\", or in Cuba's case communist, but then states that the government's themselves have misinterpreted the definition as well. So can we speak to the point where some socialist states claim to be \"democratic\" but despite the title, have had curiously one leader, or a family of leader's, for half a century. The thing is, just because you claim to be democratic, or socialist for that matter, doesn't mean you are. If you hold elections but either by rigging the ballot boxes or bully tactics at the polls, means that you are NOT democratic, you are a dictatorship with heavy overtones of facisism. By these omissions, the video romanticizes the idea of socialism without showing the absolute and eventual end of it and the nation's that adopt it.
Just a quick note, you've completely missed out Market Socialism and Mutualism, which are systems in which the means of production are owned democratically by workers at competing firms and co-operatives within a free market, with workers being entitled to the full product of their labour, a system of property rights heavily based on the difference between personal and private property, and a whole host of other stuff. Actually, it might be worth doing an explanation video for others who are unfamiliar with it.
So Socialism is just communism light?
how do the people in Cuba control the government if Casto has been the name of their leader for over two decades?\n\nwhy would anybody flee from that country if it's so free? spoiler alert: it's not a nice place.
If you are young, maybe a student , and think communism or socialism is a better system than the one that raised and educated you in a free enough society whereby you can express your dumb as fuck ungrateful opinions in the streets you never paid a cent to construct or maintain.._.._the you are a cunt. You need to be put in a camp
Actually, anarchy is the lack of regulation, which capitalism thrives in and on the political spectrum exists on the very, very far right with nothing existing to its right. Socialism and communism exist on the far, far left where regulation is everywhere. \nAlso, communism, socialism and Nazi do share aside from basic socialist models an over abundance of gun control laws and an encouragement to practice infanticide aka abortion.
Well they all suck anyway
China's SOEs account for about 30% of their GDP. And unsurprisingly those are the sectors that are draining their economic growth, and are quite aptly named their \"zombie\" economy.
5:32...\n\n*Incorrect*.  \n\n1. Left is not socialist, Right is not capitalist.  If you are attempting to create a dichotomy, you have errantly done so.\n\nThe left wing does not completely encompass Socialism.\nThe right wing does not completely encompass Capitalism.\n\n2. Shortly thereafter, you said think Star Trek for communism.  *This is Completely Incorrect*.  Star Trek encompasses Meritocracy, and not Communism.  Meritocracy is the Ideology of self improvement as the means of authority and power within a society, and Meritocracy does work, on the basis of an economy without money.  if Star Trek were communist, then the Quote by Packard would not be as such in 5:58.\n\nI see any more gaffes, I will acknowledge them with time stamps.
Socialism has nothing to do we \"social work or help\". This is what the say to people. See Venezuela for a current example. See there how \"social\" the government state is against his own people killing them... Very extreme social!!
Communism is brutal capitalism. That's all. Take jobs and things others have done is socialism. Happy hacking ;)
Im sorry, this video is amazing but i had to watch it again bc after reading DONG ENERGY, i couldnt take anything seriously
great video comrade
LIBERTARIANISM IS SOCIALISM
Well since the labor theory of value is as useless as it is incorrect, this whole video was pointless and Marxism is flawed from the foundation up.
socialism seems to try and change the person. What happened to everyone making their own choices? socialism is a dick from trying to change those around it to please itself.
I think this just makes it more confusing.
4:00 take a Look at those tools. I see what u did there.
Very informative video, although a breakdown of capitalist ideology should have totally been in this video as well!
Communism is the movement from society organized by money to society organized by language
Not 100% correct coming from an orthodox Marxist. But it's a step in the right direction towards educating Americans on their gross understanding of it. Also Cuba is not socialist but they are moving towards this
all these isms mean nothing because they're made up to create a false dichotomy. government is all about everyone sacrificing for government while government pretends to be sacrificing for everyone.
Dude your wrong about China they call themselves COMMUNIST. Trust me I work there, that's why the Communist party runs china. Wow you couldn't be more wrong, with your description please stop. You really need to learn more about this stuff Carl Marx work has nothing to do with forming a new economic system his WHOLE works is a critic of capitalism, he never advocated for anything he just pointed out flaws he saw with the current system. EVERYTHING else was implied by other people.
Thanks to internet, national books and TV for confusing word terms
DONG ENERGY
You're a fuckboi.
nothings free. its just u dont decide about where ur money goes  lol
They are the same exact thing
You all get the ovens.
BERNIE SANDERS IS A NAZI JEW
Damn, I've been wrong all of my adult life. About Cuba that is. I would've never thought of Cuba as a socialist estate with a ruling party of communist ideology  that's been democratically chosen by its people. How foolish of me not to see or realize that the unsung and noble goal of democracy was through coercion of the people  to install, implement and perpetuate a totalitarian system were the individual doesn't even have the simplest of freedoms. To say no. I don't agree, and since I don't like how things are being done I would like to leave. I mean nowhere in the definition of the word democracy you'll find the words freedom of the individual. Rule of the people. That's it, at its core. Democracy and freedom, how ignorant. Is communism bad or good? It depends which side of the fence you're on. Are we, humans, inclined to live and work not just for the benefit of oneself and our loved ones but also for the community we are part of? I'm a little rusty on my Marx-Engels, since it's been almost 40 years since I first read an illustrated copy of their book the Communist Manifest. The then newly installed in power Sandinista's in Nicaragua, wanted to educate the common people about their ideology, so they printed a comic book version of the Communist Manifest. I was about to finish high school and was pretty active in my school and we were asked to go out and sell at a very low price,can't remember how much but it was very cheap, said book. So I bought one for myself and read it. Hey if you are going to sell something you have to know the product, right? Maybe not believe or use it yourself but at least know it. I liked what I read. It appealed to my humanist side. The idea were everybody were equal, no classes or social status, everybody working for a common goal, a little bit of that old musketeers' mantra one for all and all for one was very appealing. And how ironic that here were these guys, especially Marx, whom denounced religion, was setting forth a new religion, dogma, creed, tenet or whatever you want to call it. But even funnier than that is that in his, and Engels, book you'll find many traces of that old religion. It's necessary for the old, corrupt man ( society to die ) so that a new man can emerge. Does that sound familiar? \n\nLike I said I'm very rusty on anything communist or socialist because just like is the case with most religions, or any isms, their message and intent can be a good one but, as is alway the case, if man is involved in it, you'll be disappointed rather sooner than later, more often than not. I'll say my goodbyes using the favorite slogan of our Vice President Rosario Murillo, peace and love from our socialist, Christian and solidarian  (or solidarist ) Nicaragua . Well one half out three not bad , don't you think? What a mess.
Cuba a democracy??? Pull the other one!
What about facism?
Anarchism = Pepe
Quite a loaded thing to say that because the state owns the means of production, that the people indirectly owns it.\nThe state doesn't owe shit to the people of Cuba. In fact, the \"state\" is a volatile, everchanging collective that only owes itself to their own interests. If they want to keep power, they pander to the people that vote for them. They could also be bold and introduce policies that are not in the people's interest, but their own, and if the state has the mandate, the people cannot do shit.\nTheir only option now is riot and hostile takeover.\n\nWhen you have a representative democracy, this will happen, no matter the left/right leaning. The representative you voted into parliament does not represent you or your local community, they represent only themselves and their own beliefs.
Thank you, this is extremely informative. Great video focusing on the facts only and not going into any common biases
as a point of clarity i would like to point out the Swedish systemboleget (the alcohol monopoly) does not produce anything it merely imports and buys and sells alcohol so the market can be controlled and thus the harm of excessive drinking can be too... (they tend to steer people towards drinking better not more i.e diversely and not cheap stuff simply for a buzz). (less alcoholic drinks are merely restricted by age and can be purchased in any grocery store)\n\nso technically calling it a means of production is a bit of a stretch... though the use of that term may be somewhat old fashioned.
Sweedish ignorant supporting the dictators !
Mondragon, Spain is the closest thing to a true workers' democracy, that I know of.
Anarchism isn't inherently a communist ideology.  Ever hear of anarcho-capitalism?
I love how in this he describes Democratic Socialism as totally different from what Lenin and Stalin where for but I think he forgets one key piece of information;Democratic Socialism was a term created by Lenin in order to get people behind him because up until that point very few people supported the revolution because they new it would ultimately result in a dictatorship equal to the monarchy they where already living under so Lenin in his \"ultimate wisdom\" promised the people elections for the government seats which Stalin disagreed with obviously hence why he killed Lenin and Trotsky
While I do disagree with Socialism and Communism, I actually really enjoyed this video. Good job of just giving the facts, I didn't feel as though you were trying to convince me you were right about anything. Great Work!
social democracy= friendly capitalism, which implies capitalism is unfriendly... which it is... It's nothing but exploitation.
Fuck you dirty swede\nYou Got a new sub
wrong, in norway the government owns 50% which is fucking stupid.
Next time make a video explaining the difference between water and H2O.
there's problems with both of these standpoints, take capitalism... it ultimately leads to a group of super rich individuals who to all intents and purposes own politicians and decide who wins and looses.... they also have those politicians in their pockets meaning those few mega rich people solely control the direction. sounds an awful lot like democracy and capitalism are incompatible to me... and the greater the passage of time the greater. the more ingrained the problem becomes. Also another truly fundamental issue with capitalism and the free market, really the entire global economy revolves around eternal growth of the economy. Problem is there's a limit, hard and fast ones... There's only so many natural resources in this planet, only so much that can be squeezed out of it... this shit is destined to collapse one day and when it does whoever is around to see it will see a shit storm beyond comprehension lol god it's terrifying to even imagine it
You butchered the terms- first of all you need to make a distinction between socialism and communism. Socialism is referring  to  economical establishment in a country where communism is referring to political establishment. Communism means there's only one political party and people elected are from that one party. In socialism all of the assets are owned by the government- the people . Democracy is more political parties with different ideologies like Republicans,democrats or green party they have different agendas and ideologies. Now Capitalism refers to economic establishment in which all of the assets  are owned by private entities. So in short Socialism- Capitalism . Communism-Democracy. \nYou can have Democracy and socialism at the same time -Socio-democratic parties. Btw EU is working on combination of Democracy and implementing new socio-capitalistic society. Oh and people from around the world when you pick up your welfare check thats an element of socialism so do your research before judging. Im born in Socio-communism and now i live in Democratic and Capitalistic society.
To many words for the same bullshit
Could it be said that \"socialism\" is a spectrum? where you might say that \"Venezuela has too much socialism, the US has too little socialism but canada has the right amount of it??\" or something
Nice! you just forget to explain How Utopic Socialism really is, and why it never worked and why it will never work properly. and you kept just about what it was supposed to be and NOT what it really is, and how it really works in RL. the Socialist idea to ban classes and blá blá blá. end creating a powerfull class of life politicians and have more privilengies than a common citizen and theres. anarchism isnt the lack of a government? lack of government has not to do with Communist or Socialist the requires Big Governametal control over population, and Capitalism isnt a government form at all if you are smart enought to think about it carefully, China being a \"Socialist\" Nation is more capitalist than you can imagine... and Come on... socialist willing to pay higher wages? are you serious? you should leave the Unicorn and Colorfull rainbows lands and take a look back to our world instead.
I would have said, owned or regulated by the community as a whole.\nand while Google is on my side the Oxford dictionary is on yours. I would say if this was French you win.\nbut our docuseries describe the words as the populaces uses them they do not dictate.
There is an ERROR in your little diagram, Anarchism should not belong solely to Socialism, but also to Capitalism. Thus that brown bar should run along the bottom of the chart and encompass both. The capitalistic version of Anarchism is called Libertarianism, where they believe that capitalism should not be regulated nor controlled in any form.
Are you stupid? Cuba a democracy? Last i check it was run by a ruthless dictator that wanted to analiate the usa with russias nukes. I dont see how the ppl choose their leader if there arent even elections like wtf?
Saying that Anarchism is communist because they both want a stateless society is like saying Islam is non-religious because they don't believe in your God. Just wrong.\nAnarchism has nothing to do with communism. You can be an anarco-communist as much as you can be an anarco-capitalist, or something entirely different, such as myself, for example. Since the centralized-decentralized axis is independent from the public-private axis, you can be an anarchist from anywhere of the political spectrum, and it's not even a requisite to be against a monetary system or a class system (or even the existence of states themselves); it just means that you don't recognize the authority of any state/organization to declare itself your boss without your permission.
Now you should do same to Capitalism.
I think you let your opinion run the show a bit but still informative.
Det finns fler felaktiga påståenden i den här videon än vad det finns rätta. Du kan ju inte ens grundläggande saker så som att inget land någonsin varit kommunistiskt på gruns av att det inte finns någon valuta i en kommunism mm.
You can start at 5:19 if you don't want to hear about modern politics.
Anarchism is the ultimate form of Capitalism..
this wasn't even biased it was lazy, but it's really complicated and every time you mention communist people give you ignorant reactions.
good video! well explained
Maybe I'm ignorant, but if Cuba is so great then why is there so little internet access and other goods? Simply because of sanctions? Can Castro be voted out? What is the argument that he is doing such a good job that there is no one better to run the country?
The Nazis were fascist. Just saying.
you forgot about laos and vietnam there also communism/Socialism countries
no you're wrong because Fox News told me so.
As an anarchist, I find your definition insultingly ignorant. Anarchy is the free market.
LoL \"democracy thru revolutional means\".\" people get to choose betwen our way or graveyard and we call it democracy so you'd better belive it is\"
Lots of info on a bunch of versions of Idiocracies. Could you do one on all the countries practicing 100% Free Market Capitalism?
HUMAN \"NAUTRE\"? (minute 11:00)
This guy is definitely good at making socialism and even communism look \"pretty\". Lmao. Well played. Well played.
anarchist are not necessary communist American libertarians are technical anarchocapitalist. in general anarchistic are  against centralized power.\nOK.\n\nI oversimplified a lot...
Bro... Cuba is definitely not a democracy.
Did you not discuss why Nazism is only socialism in name because the scope of the video is only on the left side of the economic spectrum? Also could've done with more development of the difference between democratic socialism and social democracy.
Cuban citizens control the cuban state... really?
Cuba democratic?  ROFLMAO ... Glad you pointed out that NAZI is a form a socialism, but you forgot to put in your hierarchy.
I disagree fundamentally with where you put anarchism, I consider it to be the extreme form of capitalism. totalitarianism the extreme form of communism. anarchism is less state control (none actually) totalitarianism complete control. clear exact opposites.
Bernie is a Communist.
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
You can't say Cuba is a democracy as long as they don't have the power to adopt another form of economical doctrine. I'm pretty sure if they could, they would choose not to live in a State where a taxi driver earns more than a engineer, pretty much forms of foreign media is censored and questionable things happen to curious reporters.
The irony of a self proclaimed Marxist using youtube to explain the difference between three failed ideologies, hilarious.
Maoism is different from other forms of communism
Lmao iraq obama
You missed cultural Marxism, given the chaos it's causing it needs addressing. The substitution of economic inequality for identity politics and privilege.
You could put countries on this graph. So we could visualise where we are.
Funny most \"socialist\" party's in Europe are Social Democracy
Also anarchism is the idea to abolish the government
Nazis were not socialist as they were far right, and were actually extremely anti socalist and communist
can you make a similar chart for capitalism?? \nalso, got an advert for prager fake univeristy- where is my throw up button? ...
Wow, Why would you compare the US election with these concepts???? How about talking about the meaning without the talking about the US???
The classification of communism is completely wrong. The rest is ok.
So by your definition, the Nazis were a left wing party?
Our toothbrushes will be property of the state? hahahahajajajajaja
focken swedish
What socialists like to call Social Democracy is in fact just a Welfare  State which is a pure Capitalistic concept invented by Otto Von Bismarck and to which most Socialists/Marxists opposed back in the time.
Haha anarchism is socialism. What the fuck is this shit?\nCapitalism means ownership of the means of production. Since every government requires a coercive monopoly, capitalism can't exist in a society with a state. thus capitalism can only exist in anarchy.
The way I see politics is a circle. t\nThe right and left start at the bottom point of a circle. The left goes left, the right goes right. Eventually both sides get carried away and arc themselves inward. Both extreme left and right end up at the top point of the circle neither one better than the other.
Here's a QUICK Political Science 101 lesson...\nThe more left you go, the more communist. The more right you go, the more fascist.\nEveryone has a fundamental agenda at their very core. I am left.
I would argue Communism is left capitalism is right and socialism is central.\nanarchism isn't in any category, that's the point, it's a non society.
Can we all agree that that most if not all forms of socialism are bad?
Except \"the state\" is not \"the people\"
I don't personally agree with your views but I do think it's important to define the terms. I actually learned something from this. although some of the terms mean different things to different people.  in America \"socialism\" is used to describe a system that regulates the economy, provides many government programs, and redistributes wealth by means of taxation and welfare. this is why Bernie and Obama are called socialist. although this is not the historical definition of the term, it's how it is typically used here. And we use \"communism\" to describe what is technically socialism. I haven't been exposed to the historical definitions of the terms before this video. I found this video interesting, the only issue was it seemd a bit biased. But overall thank you for this video sir.
lol 5k subscribers but gets 225k views....wot in tarnation?!
It's like 2017 genders, it's overly confusing and it could easily be simplified
You would have gone to gulag if you said anarchism counts in short terms as socialism too xD
so where would \"anarchocapitalists\" fall under?
How can you dare to say that anarchism counts as socialism if socialism implies the existing of a STATE and anarchism is the complete negative to any STATE?
Obviously biased.  Everyone knows capitalism is defined as \"the love of hard work, democracy, peace, and justice\" while socialism is defined as \"literally satan worship\".
Why not speak of Nordic countries instead of Scandinavia. It includes Finland and Iceland too.  I know at least Finland is in a same way \"socialist\" than scandinavian countries.
This was a very informational video.  Thank you for sharing the information.
it is wikipedia based video and has nothing to do with real understanding of this terms, there is reason why Scandinavians call themselves socialists, in early period of capitalism socialism was anti private property(so the definition in video is correct for classical socialism)  but things was changed after ww2, socialistic parties adopted (in Europe) market based economy as best way to create wealth, things go in different ways in political spectrum when issue comes to redistribution. socialist thinkers believe that national wealth should be redistributed equally or almost equally, so socialist states have much higher tax and government spends a lot in health and education and etc.  but more importantly socialist have different view of human nature and nature of society, they  believe that society and individual has much more relation than in classical liberalism was believed, they think that every individual being owes something to society because society contributes great dial of capacities and virtues of individual.\ncommunism is more concerned about small communities and organizes it's economic system around them so property owners are communities not nation as it was in classical socialism.\nMarx was materialist, he thought that materialistic needs shapes social structure. He thought that capitalism was doomed because it didn't give masses materialistic satisfaction. And this people proletarian?s as he called would rebel and make revolution. in the end he bilieved socialism will prevail
This video seems to imply that Cuba and China have elections
Oh man, a swede, must suck living in a nightmare state
Shouldn't Leninism be in the revisionist category. Marx said: \"the emancipation of the working class must be the work of the working class itself\" (alias non violent revolution)\n\nwhile Lenin said:\n“Class political consciousness can be brought to the workers only from without, that is, only from outside of the economic struggle, from outside of the sphere of relations between workers and employers” (the people without being professional revolutionists which should lead the workers; violent revolution)\n\nAs you can see, Leninism clearly changes (revisions) true Marxism. This is a very important point as it defines how the change to communism would happen. So I would say Leninism brands itself as orthodox Marxism but they really aren't.
Cuba, democratic? Speaking as someone who actually has been there, and knows many Cubans, it's as realistic as calling Obama a Communist. Cubans have ZERO say in their government, with mock elections and no direct representation nor plebiscites.
How do you get anarchism as being under communism or socialism? Ever here of ancap? Anarchy is living without a government its freedom of association, economic freedom, not the forced redistribution of wealth
Very wrong !!! Base every Thing! \nAnarchist now are communist? \nAnarchist are liberal extremist!!! The opposite ! They want the end of state . The no central government. The private control.
I can help you with the Stalin x Trotsky thing if you want
I respectfully disagree with your info graphic.
Wonderful video. Sad that many commenters seem to be holding on to the idea that \"all communist governments/ societies have failed \"when you clearly explained in the video that communist societies would be stateless and money less and you could argue have therefore not existed in a pure form. Some people are stubborn to learning or hearing things that they've never heard before. Either way it was a great video. Keep it up. ????
sorry, you're erong about anarchism. it has similarities with communism, and socialism, mainly in economy, but very different view about in ideology and some economic questions too. for example taxation
can confirm as a dane. private enterprises are quite normal.\nwe're also a very centrist country that likes to pretend we have right and left leaning parties, but all largely does the same thing, to the point where a lot of people vote blindfolded as we get the same old government as always, which isn't bad at all.
and this is why capitalism is more efficient. no need for useless bureaucrats taking big cuts when redistributing wealth.\n\nits basic economics. you create a welfare state, you subsidize the poor, naturally everyhing you subsidize will grow and come more of. 30 years of central bank lending and inflation and you get the destruction of western civilization. \n\nty Karl Marx.
Forgot usually enforced at gunpoint
Idiot\n\nChinese government owns vast swaths of private industry. \n\nTaxation is a version of socialism. How can you not even touch on that. \n\nI am dumber after listening to you.

It's really stupid to let any government control anything. Free market or death.
so basically communism was never really done, I can accept that. \n\na classless and stateless society sounds nice and on paper communism sounds good. the problem though is the people that support communism. I've never seen a group of people with such a hard on against free speech. \n\nmaybe in the future when we have massive automation,(which is sooner than most think), it could work but right now probably not.\n\nsocial democracy might be a good idea till then though
Where does fascism go?
you should do a video on the multiple economics schools of thought like Austrian Chicagoin neoclassical classical Keynesian
why not niggarists?
Very good video, however I have a question if anyone could answer that would be lovely where does stalinism fit into this?
There is a huge problem about definition of ownership. As you even mentioned in the video, ownership of something is about making decisions about it. If you \"own\" a company, but government steals 50% of the production and dictates very strictly what and how you produce, what wages are, etc.. it's highly debatable who actually owns the company!
This is just a bunch of dictionary definitions devoid from any historical, economic or political knowledge. The way those ideologies have been grouped is highly misleading and extremely simplistic. Cuba is democratic? The Scandinavian countries are more capitalist than socialist? How can you possibly exclude tax rates and welfare spending from that description? \n\nBesides, the umbrella term of capitalism is an over-simplification as well. Where does Classical Liberalism fit into the picture? How about a distinction between collectivism and individualism?
Great video!!! thanks.. did you make a vídeo about the difference between lenninism trotskism etc?
The difference between Kentucky Fried Chicken and Chick-fil-A?\nThey are fried chicken. End of discussion.
Don't agree with your views but I liked the video!
only the rich, stupid, and brainwashed believe capitalism is a good idea, if you look at it with an objective and strategic mind, you can see that it is doomed to failure, it cannot succeed, with tech advances there will be less jobs, but population keeps growing, more people, less jobs, keep multiplying that shit out, tell me how long until you get to utter complete annihilation, it's coming, coming soon, murica's streets will run red with blood, it's the only logical outcome of capitalism
Eyyy är också svensk
private Business owners are NOT LIKE THAT. they do not want to unbenefit everyone.
very informative, thx
there are many diferent types of shit, but shit is still shit
you missed market socalism, mutualism, and syndaclism, but overall not a bad video, what you did cover you explained fairly well.
There all mental illnesses
I wouldn't say marxists and anarchists share a common goal but just by different means. The philosophical gap between both is huge. It's true they can work together sometimes - it happened in the Spanish Civil War, but they had a lot of trouble doing so -. Anyway, the whole idea of dealing with the terminological issues is well accomplished in the video. You just earned yourself a new sub. Greetings from Spain.
i wish i could revive Marx, so he can carry on with his works for them to reach their full-fledged form, not only being just an ideas on scraps of paper vulnerable for misconceptions and erroneous execution. I mean that they would really bring positive, visible, and executable outcome.
Finally someone who gets his definition right!
The definition of Socalism that I understand to be correct is that the means of Production, Distribution and Exchange are controlled or REGULATED by the society as a whole. Could you comment on that?
this guys accent sounds like a british person who lived in america for a long time. and he lives in sweden. im cofused,
I detect a little communism.\nI can see it in the things you do. Communism, socialism; call it what you like. There's a very little diffrence in the two.
Hey I was wondering if you could make a downloadable image out of the little infographic you made, would greatly appreciate it!
communist or marxist are also for the dictatorship of the proletariat anarchist dont like that
The non far left only state run all production and far right only private production are clear.\nMost nations have a mixed market social-capital economic systems.\nSome going further than others toward social than capital or more toward capital than social markets. \nThe best method to use to determine the make up of what should be collective and what is handled better under private production is the for profit motive which rationality is based on competitive market principles.  Those markets that violate most of or critically violates competitive market principles to the point that profit motive no longer provides the better results over a collective social market, then those sectors or parts of a sector should be held collectively to get better results. Better results meaning: cheaper prices, more supply, better quality, etc.  \nTextiles, food, appliances durable and non-durable, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, and some mining and refining both in retail an manufacturing portions are often best under private ownership; they may require some rules to fix weaknesses in their competitive market principles such as perfect knowledge (requirement for nutrition facts labels on processed/cooked foods).  Perhaps subsidies and environmental rules on mining and refining to meet economies of scale and to ensure externality costs of pollution are not bared by society at large only, but use the profits to cover those costs.  \nItems that grossly violate competitive market principles like fire services, police, legal, utilities including water, electrical distribution, sewer, ports, roadways, and healthcare via clinics hospitals, etc. that constitute a natural monopoly, difficult barriers to entry due to extreme economies of scale, huge externality costs/benefits, no available substitutes at even long run (20 to 30 years), and/or conflict of interest, collusion, dumping/price war, etc. should be highly regulated or simply collectively owned and operated; profit motive no longer working as they're not forced by competition to provide cheaper prices, better quality, more supply, etc. \nSome countries include more collective ownership than private.  \nExamples of differences:\nNorway has a nationalized (government owned) oil business called Statoil using its revenues and all profits toward growing the oil business and mostly to pay for various other programs like healthcare, education, and reserve for environmental issues like clean up due to the production of oil.  \n\nUS has no state owned oil company.  Some profits are taxed. But much of the taxes are passed onto the eventual buyer of the products.  Collecting smaller revenues for social services like lack of a universal healthcare services for all.  Less and less funding for higher education so students' tuition costs continue to rise. \n\nChina which has government owned steel and manufacturing facilities making things such as steel for pipes and buildings, often sell at profit losses; mostly to keep citizens pacified, using debt and tax collection to pay for the losses, eventually causing other nations' for profit motive business to go under; with the hopes that supply then gets cut that they will be able to charge more for their goods to then make a profit or at least break even.  At the detriment of other nations.\n\nEconomic distinctions should not be confused with government types: Republics, monarchies, constitutional monarchies, Republics, Theocracies,  Dictatorship, etc.\nAny of these types of governments can be totalitarian or libertarian (oppressive or liberal).  Saudi Arabia: absolute monarchy with social-capital mixed market economy with state owned oil company, other means of production on competitive sectors are privately owned; cited for many human rights violations and oppressive to women and non-Muslim, verging on a Theocracy.  \nChina: Republic, with currently a mixed market social-capital system; many competitive and non-competitive markets are state and privately owned; some are quasi co-ownership private and government such as private buy in stake into a government owned business. Also cited for large human rights violations, elections are layered between classes, with higher offices getting elected by representatives. An indirect democracy.  Oppression on freedom of speech, public opinions, and random arrests and quick non-transparent trials, convictions, and executions strike fear in even their own citizenry let alone condemnation from other nations with less oppression. \n\nGovernment types and economic types are often related. But they are different things.  The concepts of economics and governments are complex. And should be treated as so. Overly simplifying complexity is tantamount of ignoring reality and how to even deal with the complexity in the first place.  \n\nEssentially socialism and capitalism are meaningless jargon that have lost most of any useful definition.
Eh, I think quite a few anarchists would disagree with your definition of anarchism...\nAnarchism (an = no, and arch meaning king/ruler) is all about no one ruling over others.\nObviously with such values it's a ideology with a lot of different viewpoints about what exactly it is.\nFor instance some forms of anarchism believes that you can achieve such a world without a shared ownership of resources among other things essentially landing it on the capitalist side of the fence for some variants of anarchism and at  the very least outside communism for others.\nDon't mix up anarcho-communism as the only form of anarchism out there.\nEssentially if you look at politics as a multi-dimensional space with things like communism/capitalism on one axis anarchism and authoritarianism (like fascism) is on a totally different axis at a 90 degree angle to the capitalism/communism issue.\nAnd people on both sides of one axis can be on either side of the other axis.\nOf course there's way more then just two axis of politics, but using two helps demonstrate the relationship between the two in a way that is easier to visualize and comprehend for humans.\nAlso, while people on the economic left can be authoritarian and people on the economic right can be liberitarian there's a tendency towards a relationship going the other way for those two sides at least in modern politics in the western world.\nPossibly in part due to our tradition of comparing politics on a single line instead of using a multidimensional space.\n\nAlso, anarchism has long had a separate theoretical tradition as a foundation for the ideology that does not really overlap with communism, other then possibly at the very beginning of the two ideologies history.
\"Friendlier version of capitalism\"? Capitalism is the only meritocratic society out of everything you listed. What is friendlier than that?
\"Sveriges riksdag\" is the parliament. \"Sveriges regering\" would be the government
that shows you dont have any idea of what is not left-wing points of view
I'm an an-cap, but I would gladly convert if I had my own spaceship.
I don't think you can make socialism opposed to capitalism, because they are not found unmixed.  Bernie and Scandanavia are only a little more socialist than the Republicans.
Please do one on different types of capitalism next.  Or rather different economic systems with varying amounts of capitalism including social democracies.
Ok so where does fascism fit in on the spectrum? It is practically defined by class systems and does not work in classical marxist ways, as well as hating socialists, but\nYea theyre not capitalist either\nIts really hard to determine if they are far left of far right or a fusion of them both\n\nAnd also\nCan someone explain how national socialism can be a thing?\nThe two terms appear to be completely opposite of one another
Lennysm???? (?° ?? ?°)™(?° ?? ?°)™(?° ?? ?°)™
can anybody tell me what accent the speaker has?
Lol this made no sense
The difference is simple:\nCapitalism allows ownership of private property.\nSocialism allows less ownership of private property.\nCommunism allows no ownership of private property.
Interesting video with useful explanation. However I have one remark to this video. \n\nIt is a common misconception that in Star Trek is communism. It is not. In Star Trek the Federation is composed of over 150 member planets and each of them have its own economical system. In the scene presented in this video, cpt. Picard was summarizing how much things have changed over time and he was mostly refering to the system used on 24th century Earth. Star Trek never focused on economy, so we cannot say exactly what socio-economical system they use on Earth. However it is clear it doesn't fit the definition of communism. For example, we have seen in several episodes that there is private ownership on Earth and there are also private businesses.\n\nOn the diagram from this video, I would place the system used In ST on Earth somewhere in the middle, although it's difficult to place it anywhere because this diagram is relevant to todays world and not the future or the past.
You should put \"capitalist\" countries like the U.S. & U.K. on your chart to illustrate how far from pure capitalism they are with all their public roads, schools, pensions and such...
fantastic video!
I'm pretty sure the economy of Nazi Germany was mostly state owned
I'll take communism and socialism seriously when I find a communist/socialist that is not financially and economically illiterate. I was on a VIOP server with 20 communists for months, none could explain the labor theory of value or make sense of it. Further, they couldn't use examples with math for the labor theory of value, I'm assuming due to the fact that they, like Barbie thought 'Math Class is hard'.
PS: im into classic marxism, otherwise known as OG Marxism...;)\n\nOhh, also...i think Titoism also exists...;)
Russia, believe it or not still has a lot of state owned production sector. Not all, but a pretty sizeable amount of them are...
2:12: There are a lot in common. The state controlled or owned big companies, the cheap or free healthcare, the cheap or free education and the dictatorship.\n\n6:47: The original marxism doesn't believe in a transition. You're talking about the Marxism -Leninism(Stalinism), the ruler ideology of the ussr.
Hey, my college economy teacher defines himself as anarcocapitalist; wich is a capitalist without regulations like minimum wage or 8 hours shifts. You would need an ultra wide monitor to put that righter than capitalism
The United States of America falls into a far right capitalist ideology that should properly be referred to as \"Social Darwinism\". Under this ideology, many attempts to improve the standard of living for the average American are promptly dismissed as \"socialism\" by the prevailing social order. If one does not have the means to afford an education, healthcare, housing or otherwise contribute to mass consumerism, they are considered outcasts and are shunned by the social and political elites. The few social programs that exist do little to better the lives of those who most need it.
The Communist Can of Pesto!!!
Thank you!
You know the similarity? none of them work..
I barely know anything about politics so I am very confused
Karl Marx laziest dude who ever lived
Some thoughts:\n\nSo where Nazism fits in the picture? Most common explanation to Nazis persecution of Socialists and Communists is that they wanted to get rid of rivaling Socialistic/Labour parties (ref. German archives).\n\nWhy there is Leninism mentioned, but not Stalinism? USSR was upholding Stalinist, not Leninist tradition (but in name).\n\nAccording to German archives Bernstein, grounding father of Social Democracy, wanted banks to be owned by government, but Marx did not. Maybe due the fact that the latter was related to Rothschilds.\n\nChina has not been Communist since they reformed Maoism. The system in Russia is very similar nowadays. Is Putinism Socialism, too? In both countries you have to belong to The Party in order to get the perks.
I always hold respect to serious and rigorous Marxists (though I dissent). And this video can clarify several key concepts of the left wing movement, which is good, considering superficial show-offs of ideologies are rampant these days.
Although universal healthcare is nice on paper but in reality it doesn't work as planned like most things. Universal healthcare turns out like the US's VA which works but everybody hates it because it isn't \"friendly\" as a way of speaking. Whether you like it or not private industry keeps things efficient, effective, and it evolves to keep consumers satisfied (for the most part). It keeps things fair (for the most part) by paying high skill jobs more than low skill jobs, the reason why I say for the most part is
anarchists are literally the exact opposite as socialists.
Other than your obvious biases you are not even clear on what you're saying, for instance, \"other Scandinavian countries...like France\" France is not Scandinavian. This and other little lapses in intelligence and your constant use of direct definitions being placed on the screen and then read makes it abundantly clear you have about as much knowledge as a 5 minute Wikipedia reading session.
There are definately right wing anarchists out there as well, Laize Faire has some strong anarchist ideals at it's core for instance.
You got anarchism wrong I'm afraid. You described anarcho-communism, which is only one kind. anarcho-mutualists are socialists but not communists for example.
Pro Tip: Watch the video at 2x speed. You're welcome.
Cuba is democratic? Hahahahahahaha!
How do y'all feel about Strasserism
loved the video. would be more helpful to me if you didn't focus on relative definitions. I'm sure that's hard but when understanding one relies on the rest I feel like the explanation loses a bit.
you left out Stalinism and you didn't explain how the Nazis were socialist.  great video tho, I knew enuf to lump Stalinism next to Maoism, but still I thought if nitpick.  (id guess that Tito's communism would go in the same location as well).
Great! You just forgot to say that all ideas on the left don't work. Have a good day!
All systems are spooks and everything is mine.
China is more free market than for example most of western europe, no Social benefits etc, just no free speech, but FREER market than actual date Western markets
Thank you very much for this video. It's well put together and you were well spoken. Keep up the good work because you just earned a sub.
titoism is the best
It's pretty simple really, marxism leads to socialism, which always leads to communism. :^) on a serious note though, this video's pretty fuckin' bad.
Good video. \n\nNow, the right part of the table should be for libertarianism - that is, people who believe in free capitalism with no state production, nor state regulation (basically, capitalism unleashed). So I wonder where you'd put Fascism (or Corporatism) in there.
What about hippy utopia? Where does that fit in?
Nothing is ever paid by the government. It's always the tax payer who pays (or works in the case of a state-own company profits).
My economic views are to the right of Adam Smith, but I appreciate your table and your clarity.  Little you had said actually surprised me, but the table is a great visualization tool.  Thank you.
I prefer capitalism
Communism and socialism as economic systems failed. Ref. Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell.
Bernie Sanders does not call himself a Socialist. he calls himself a democratic socialist. you might say big deal. But it makes a bit of a difference.
Hahaha! Cuba a democracy, hahaha!\nYes, it's obvious you live in a Scandinavian country. I live in Latin America, and I can tell you Cuba is not at all a democracy.
Good video bro
\"...paid for by the government\".\n\nthat's a good one.
The difference is: Theyre all useless ideaologies.
what if all these ideas aren't bad and money is bad, let's all be one big sharing tribe
Pretty sure you can have a capitalistic form of anarchism. Like the term socialism, anarchism can encompass a broad range of ideological beliefs (including anarcho-communism).
I'm a communist and I have started using this to educate my friends on my ideals. Thanks mate!
So at 2:46 of this video I can't help but to contradict a little but according to the \"what the wages should be\"  I must point out that the average income of the US is $56000 a year or so and Cuba at $20 a month (check it out online google it) so how is socialist or communist governments supposed to be better again?
human nauture human nauture human nauture.\nnice vid, very educational and informative.
Haven't seen any \"Socialism doesn't work, look at Venezuela\" comments. Happy Times!
Interesting.  In social democracies, can we see increased government control via regulation and mandates as creep toward socialism?  Or in other forms of capitalism for that manner.  There definitely is a spectrum in capitalism ranging from totally free markets to regulated ones, to ones partially owned by the government.\n\nI was also thinking earlier about part of the problem with production in the hands of the workers as represented by the state is the potential for state backed lack of freedom on the part of the individual.  In other words, if the same state who makes the laws and maintains order through power controls your income, your access to goods, and the means to produce them in addition to a monopoly on force and... what recourse does an individual have against such an entity?  Or what about the ruled population as a whole, for that matter, when the government wields such control?  There would have to be an insanely stable, pure, and benevolent party in control for it not to go very badly.
I would say the meaning of words is how they are used. If a person uses a word how it has been used in every instance then they are fully correct. But, this may not always be so easy to do. So, there are different definitions of a word. This can be seen in any dictionary. Definition 1 Definition 1 a definition 1 b definition 2 and so on.
By definition, a country is at least partially socialist if some of its production (say electricity), distribution (say high-speed railway), and exchange (say stock exchange), are public/state owned.\n\nThe common logic fallacy, which is also present in this video, is to push \"socialism\" into extreme and consider anything that's not extreme socialism part of capitalism. Ironically, this is often a tactics used by those who want to push for extreme capitalism to smear the name \"socialist\".\n\nThe fact is there is never a clear cut between socialism and capitalism. Just as a country that allows privately owned businesses to operate cannot be fully socialist, one that provides public services and production cannot be fully capitalist.
Dude, do some research about every these ideologies before you post a video on them, I'm socialist after a year of research, I'll know, and this is VERY poorly researched, even your def. for it is wrong. Socialism is a society where there is no money, except with foreign trade, and everyone is equal in power and class, so yes Sweden, Denmark, and Finland are the closest to socialist countries you can currently find. Socialism, as such, can fit with literally all forms of gov. (It's obvious that your a capitalist and not a socialist
This is the most either arrogant or innocent thing you could say. So you're better than Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Polpot out Castro. Of course is the same thing. Any postmodernist knows they belive in Marxism.
So basically, Scandinavian countries just opened up a few businesses to generate money for the state, and provide some employment to it's citizens, I'm assuming because of economic necessity, and idiots in America think that makes those small countries socialist?
Bernie got schlonged by Hillary's massive shaft.  Did you see his face at the DNC? That said it all.
Cuba. A democracy. They get 3.5/10 on the democracy index, making them a fully authoritarian country. They're #128 overall, making them the 39th most dictatorial regime on Earth. \n\nYeah, I'm going to say Cuba isn't a democracy.
They should probably re-name 'Social Democracy' to something like 'Capitalist Marxism' to avoid confusion.
2:46 great mistake, in both the quote should be \"as low as possible to keep people working and without power or time to strike\" But in capitalism wages are just like one more price, depending on supply/demand
Dong Energy is not a state-owned company anymore and is funnily enough the root of a major scandal and lots of ideological discussions regarding capitalism and social democracy in Denmark (it got sold pretty cheaply to Goldman Sachs).
Not all anarchists are communists. Anarcho-collectivists like Bakunin, Mutualists like Proudhon, and Anarcho-Syndicalists like Chomsky are merely socialists, while people like Kropotkin are Anarcho-Communists.
I used to be a pretty big believer in socialism. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut now I have a job.
3:11 that is not true, Nazi Germany did not have a capitalist system, the economy was controlled or influenced by the government.
This is pretty good. Nice job.
That's crazy how you didn't have an accent until you said you were from Sweden
Hello @azureScapegoat. It's a great vid. How would you classify North Korea, Venezuela and Ecuador?
how do you explain the Labour Parties in England & the Labor Party in Australia, are they democratic socialists or a hybrid?
Awesome video. I would only like to state that you put anarchism as only a communist idea, when some classical anarchist visions of anarchism, such as mutualism and collectivism were socialist, but not communist ideas.
Anarchy is taking capitalism to its extreme. Anarcho communism can only exist voluntarily within an anarcho capitalist \"system.\"\n\nIf its not voluntary and done by consensus, its not anarchy. Get that fantasy shit out of your head.
Now lets have a video on total anarcho capitalism.
I love communism now!\n\n\n\n\n\njk I've already loved it before.\nGood video.
Socialism = mass murder
anarchist don't count as any of these things they believe in the absence of government
This video is actually genius!
Socialism still sucks. Get your hands off my property.
You know you did at least a decent job when an ancap such as myself thinks this video got it's definitions straight.
I think you should have been clearer about how the USSR was actually an oligarchy with communism only in name to excuse the rationing of resources to the broad population. It never was communist of even close to being it. It had clear classes, the high-level party members, the party members, the masses and the political opponents, same for Mao's China. Communism by definition rejects that kind of distinction and oppression on specific groups as it creates different classes of citizens.\n\nOh, and there are multiple types of anarchism, the mad max type where anything goes and the organized society where there are rules to follow (like no murder, no rape, and pillage) but no political class to decide it, no money and no frontiers or other societal constructs that limit individual rights.) Actually, some libertarians are close to Anarchism in their values.
can you put the thumbnail somewhere in your webpage? is really awesome and usefully. thanks for the video really interesting
Ok, but in North Korea, the community has no control over the economy, the state does. So what would they be classified as?
where would feudalism be on that chart?
Please explain me like I'm 5, why capitalism differs from socialism. Isn't capitalism just the method of an entity reinvesting capital into its capital generating source?
So marxism is idealism?
u didnt mention the DPRK
Many people call Russia socialist, oh boy...
Errr... nope, anarchism is not communism.\nOf course anarchism is a \"comunitarian\" ideology, but it's not  marxist and not comunist.
I'd call myself centre-right and do therefore not agree with your personal standpoint, but your explanation is on point. Like.
I can't see how anarchism can coexist with socialism, in an anarchist society how will anyone enforce socialism? a person or group of people can just as easily start their own capitalist enterprise or found a libertarian society within a larger nation without a governing body to tell them otherwise.
aren't the Scandinavian countries socialistic capitalism ?
Left V Right is easier understood in terms of freedom from the state.
classless, stateless moneyless and common ownership of the means of production
taxation without representation is what all the socialist have in common.
Communism is stateless...therefore not socialist statism
Thanks for this great work. In my opinion, Karl Marx would like society to become anarchy : stateless, moneyless, classless. Am I wrong ?
I always thought anarchy was the goal of libertarianism.
Ahh, the definition argument.  The dictionary definitions of Socialism, Communism, etc. do not match modern English usage.  Cuba is Communist.  China is more-or-less socialist, but tending towards less.  Sweden and Denmark are Democratic-Socialist, but much richer than China, so comparing social safety nets is a waste of time.  The Nazis were just totalitarians, and we don't care what they called themselves.  The Soviets were more-or-less Communist, the way that the Cubans are.  In modern usage Commmunist means exactly what the presenter's definition of Socaialist says.  Capitalist is more-or-less what the USA does.  Socialist and Democratic-Socialist are in between.  Problem solved.
4:00 subtle USSR shilling.
hermes staff instead of the staff of asclepius SAD!!
Go to North Korea for you. :)  Maoism is orthodox, haha. Read some craps he said.
Nice video, but you failed to mention that nobody ever actually achieved communism(the classless society part to be exact) . Czechoslovakia was close but still not there. Therefore no country should be marked as communistic.
You were a bit iffy about Anarchism but still a helpful video!
\"elected representatives.... in Cuba\"!!!\nHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAAHAHAHAHA\nthis video is funny
came here to let you know that anarchy isn't a left wing position\n\nthere's a variety of types of anarchy
>cuba\n>democracy\n\npick 1
sees anarchism on the socialist side in the thumbnail\ninstant dislike
how about fascism?
Claiming that China has a mainly Capitalist economy is completely false, as over half of the economy is still state owned. In China, we consider the complete public ownership of the means of productions (which would then create a classless nation other than the government) as Communism, the complete private ownership of the means of production as Capitalism, and the half-way point as Socialism. Note, this only works in China under the Maoist based branch of Socialism that has now been transformed to \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\". \n\nOne of the points of Maoism was that there can be classes, 4 of them to be specific: the working class, the peasantry, the urban petite bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. The idea that there not only can be classes, but that the bourgeoisie can be tolerated is what I would say makes Maoism unorthodox Marxism. The privatization of the means of production only works under two categories, the first being that one person can not own a significant portion of the means of production (which is a terribly vague concept and has been abused under Deng and Jiang), or the control of the government over private companies (the threat that the government could always take over or have more influence than the owner). The existence of these (which they still do exist, though it took a lot of grey areas to keep this going) would indicate that China still follows the Maoist principles laid out in the founding of the PRC, thus is still Socialist. \n\nWhether or not the CCP wants to move towards Communism, that has yet to be seen.
Economy and politics aren't the same topic, a reminder if you view the comments.
Can you make a video on capitalist ideologies aswell? This was very educational, even for someone who already loved politics and economy.
I would file \"Leninism\" under \"Revisionist Marxism,\" because Marx believed that Communism had to happen in an industrial state, and Russia was not industrialized. It's just an observation. I'm in no way an authority on this subject.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, \"The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of spending other people's money.\"
Next video explain the difference between shit, feces, and diarrhea
I'm from Sweden. Sweden in political terms is quite socialist or have been. Bernie and Olof Palme describe themselves as democratic socialist. It is different in political terms. Sweden compared to the USA is socialist asf. health care, school funding, social security etc are much better ante actually available in Scandinavia
can someone explain to me in short but specific why comunisme are hated by majority of people in the world ? especially for US people ?
Anarchism is not further left then Marxism ...
wow revolutionairy socialists don't participate in elections because they are capitalist, what a great way to establish a undemocratic dictatorship
My Comrade will kill you.. Can of Pesto FUKK YOU
Love him or hate him, Castro made cuba Great.
I don't like your smug tone
Fuckin commies
Me and my friend are both communists , but he is a anarchist and I am kind of a classical Marxist. I appreciate this video showing the difference.
1.you have a very romantic view of Cuba\n2.video is too condensed
The difference between communists and other socialists is not on the goal (in theory) but on the means : socialists want to use reform and elections and communists want revolution.
less than a minute in, and you cite Marx claiming that people don't understand the distinctions between Communism and Socialism. Another minute in, and you talk about how China calls itself Socialist. You neglect to mention that its run in a one party system, and that single party that is in power calls itself the Communist Party of China. You might actually think that there is a reason that Communism and Socialism is conflated by the \"ignorant hicks from the country.\" It might be because political and academic elites have deliberately conflated Communism and Socialism to cause confusion and disenfranchise those \"ignorant hicks from the country\" by dominating the political discourse through obfuscated language.
What even is this, anarchism is communism?
Still like capitalism better
This video is so simple it is more wrong than right
star trek is communist propaganda?
I believe we should make edible money, like on seaweed. Not sure why, just because
Well national socialism should probably be seen as a completely different system from socialism as there doctrines are very different.
kommer du från varberg?
The best way for the governor to rape and murder without being prosecuted is the fuxking China so called communism. Women is nothing in China and used by the governor as sexual bait for other countries and the citizens have no right to revoke, either live or die. And the best part is the 1.3 billions volunteers slavery today still support their fuxking governor for wrong things doing to China is by the Western countries. The US and Europe are all evil and they want China to die and disappear. A stupid government creates idiot citizens and of course a stupid country.
I think the anarco capitalist might point out a slight flaw in this diagram
Calling anarchism a form of socialism makes very little sense. Socialism is about the means of production being controlled by the people( democratic government,) like for instance universal health care or the military, the police. Anything that produces anything, especially services that benefit society, like health services. The opposite of this would be letting social services like health care be run by private individuals. Privatization is usually a product of capitalist ideologies but taken to the extreme where nothing is controlled through democratic government(the people) you would get a society where everything is run by private individuals, this would be called anarchism. In that sense, anarchism is specifically an extreme form of capitalism, not socialism. Last point: The USSR were not strictly speaking socialist. They called themselves that but they where really a dictatorship, a dictatorship by definition can't be socialist because how are the services controlled by the people if they aren't controlled by the people? We all know these people call themselves socialist, but as Chomsky so humorously pointed out, the USSR also called themselves democratic, so maybe we should take what they called themselves with a grain of salt. lol
FUCKING COMMIES THIS IS 'MURICA!
its funny how wrong and deluded this video is.
One thing though - while individuals can use words incorrectly,  societies cannot. Sweden is socialist because the word socialist has changed from it's original meaning to a mixed economy that leans to the left.
I have a question about a moneyless society.  If people no longer accumulate wealth and just better ones self, how can one better their own family?  I understand how 100% tax rates better society.  But, humans are family orientated, not a colony of ants (which happen to be a single family anyway).  So, if you can't accumulate anything, your own children will be no better off than a strangers children.  I suppose there would have to be some sort of abandonment of the family and let the state raise the children.  Any videos on the subject of a moneyless society being better than capitalism would be appreciated.
Great explanation! Than you so much
Where is Lysenkoism on this?
We can make a religion out of this
What most people don't understand is that Bernie Sanders isn't socialist/social democratic at all. In fact he's not even left wing. By European standards, he's central right but the US is such a right wing extremist country that he in their eyes is the same as the Bolsheviks  when he in fact just uses common sense. You as a swede should understand what I mean by saying that Sen. Sanders is more right-wing/capitalist than the Moderate party or the Christian democratic party (KD 2018 förresten).
This has replaced wwii as the pseudo intellectual topic of choice. Internet comment board sociologists love these out dated dramatic labels because they're loud and hyperbolic. None of this is real. It's backed by no evidence or study and can't be measured or calculated. They're just words community college drop outs and teenaged atheists use to argue with each other.
Sorry, but you misspelled \"nature\".
Star Trek I'm afraid isn't a good explanation for Communism. It's still contains class. Money has been ruled out for some people's lives, not all. Do to replicators and easily available amenities people can live lives without money b/c cheap production. There is a meritocracy in that those who preform better in society are promoted to different levels, .ie if your good at cooking you can be a restaurant owner because people will actually eat your food and you enjoy cooking. And in fact people do have money (but not needed) to spend on going to places or buying ships or something. A social democracy but the rights the state guarantees are further in that they uphold pleasure, well-being, and entertainment. It's similar to saying Brave New World by Aldous Huxley is communist. I would gander at saying imperial storm troopers are in a communist system? The peoples temple cultists?
This sounds like pure propaganda.  Though, you tried to entice to viewer into believing all the good points of  Socialist, Communism and etc, you forgot to tell them what a true clusterfuck it is for the masses.  Lack of food and medical treatment for all, except the party leaders!  Self sacrifice to the point of death for millions upon millions!  No choice in anything, the government tells you were to live, what your job will be, where you can go.  Its no wonder people in these backward counties are trying to get out.
What does pesto have to do
Why so many dislikes? I think it's a fairly accurate simplification of something which is obviously much larger, complex and controversial... Kudos to the uploader, takk takk
You should use a political spectrum with has four sides: Left economics parallel to Right economics, and Freedom parallel to Authoritarianism.\n\nCommunism can you find heavily on the authoritarian side and slightly on left side. \nSocialism can you find on the left side, but between freedom and authoritarian.\nLibertarian can you find on freedom side, and often to the right side.\nConservative can you find on the right side between freedom and authoritarian.\nFascism can you find near communism but is placed slightly on the right side.
but if there is no money how do i get my samsing galaxy s300
Thanks ! So I'm a peacefull democratic communist revisionist marxist socialist. That sounds great.
Y'all forgetting about anarcho-capitalism, which doesn't make capitalism better, just makes anarchism worse
Anythig but Anarchocapitalism is socialism, and is also imoral and unethical
can you do one on Peronism?
Actually, Scandinavians are capitalists since they are Social Democrats. The difference is that even though Social Democrats still try to have some state ownership most of the enterprise is privately controlled. In the other hand, Socialists see capitalism as incompatible with freedom and equality. If you wonder what's your political ideology I recommend a really great app called Vote 1- Political Spectrum
Bra video kamrat!
The Anarchism is totally incompatible with socialism, the socialism needs a great state, and the anarchism does not.
why chavez needed to exist?
how about north korea's jurche?
Nazi had a free market? really?
China is more of a state capitalist system.
This video is awesome
Just wondering, but what did you get in history GCSE if you did it? Totally random question ahaha
Anarchism is not about a world without law
this is a great introduction video! What I disagree with is that social democrats are by definition capitalistic. Historically social democrat is the term for democratic socialist who want to achieve a socialist society by the means of reformism. While it is true that most social democrats today aren't actually socialists, I find it important to note that there are many actual socialists in social democratic parties.\n\nAlso I would argue that anarchiam is too broad of a term to just put in the category of communism, since there are many anarchist that arent arent actually communist or even socialist.
I would describe Norway, Sweden and Denmark as Social Democrat.\n\n\nEDIT: I wrote this before watching the entire video
\"now we will truly make comunism\" Fidel in a speech
I use to live in Cuba and they call them selves comunist wich is what they are
well explained
This was a good video, I am not a Socialist myself but I study political science
Would China fit in the category with all those SOEs?
this is allot of spin
Skip to 9:45 for the differences. You can watch the whole video for a more in-depth definition of each (which I highly recommend) but it's up to you. btw, you're welcome.
I think you have confounded socialism and communism. In socialism, is the society comes before the individual. The latter must put the interest of the former in first place. It has profound implications and leads to different conclusions.
????? ????, ??, ???????????????? ?????
Trotskyism is best form of communism
Essay on different types of government gives me headache last semester! Never look back
Bernie never calls himself a socialist. He always calls himself a democratic socialist. He corrects the journalists that call him a socialist every time I've seen an interview from him.
I think only the means of food, transportation, electricity, basic hygiene products should belong to the government
There are some other forms of communism older than marx but it's not such a big of a deal.
The nazis where fascist
\"replacing the Mad King before him\" 1:30
saying a nation is not socialist because the state only owns a few means of production (companies)  doesn't really make sense and I think is a poor way to measure it.\n\nI think a more accuraute way of measuring it would be based on the amount of tax. There might as well not be a difference between \"owning\" your company and the state owning it if the state is taxing you at insane rates. all that means is they will let you pay to start it and take the risk while taking the majority of your production via taxes to redistribute what you have produced.
Would DeLeon's and Debs' ideas be Orthodox Marxism?
very well and clearly made. love the summary
but I can't stand when people call others Facists -_- does anyone even know what that is?
state owned does not mean community owned or controlled. It just moves choice further away from people so that instead of making purchase/spend decisions every day, you can only make voting decisions every couple of years. socialist economies have much less liberalism (choice) for people than free market, regardless if they are both democracies or not
B-but muh true communism is impossible
Bernie sanders thinks breadlines are a good thing.
when you say paid for by the government, you know you mean paid for by the taxpayer.
Some people, specially conservatives, try to bring socialism whenever there is a dictatorship. But they never explain what they consider a right-wing dictatorship.
I somewhat liked the video, from someone being an ex-commie, I disliked some wording and slides in the video because it seemed like you were being somewhat opinionated in the video at some points, which is you are entitled to do so, I just didn't click the video to watch opinions. I would like to see you do a video on the communist schools of thought and the anarchist schools of thought, but it would be appreciated, from me at least, if it was strictly educational. Great video none the less.
social democracy is not a capitalism lols
The graph was the best part, I was so lost before the video Know I understand alot more after watching this..
actually anarchist are divided into 2 groups, ancom and ancap groups. ancom is the communist one and ancap is on the other side.
'But Stalin.' Because historical examples of how governments operated is important too.
Socialists, Communists, Democratic Socialists, Social Democrats who are actually Capitalists... My head won't stop spinning! HELP!
Communism is \"The Borg\"
when you say \"Anarchism\" do you actually mean \"Anarcho-Communism/Socialism\" because anarchy is not Communist or socialist, it can't be if the collective is the governance its governance, Anarchy has no governance only individual mutual agreements. I wish Communists would just be honest and call themselves communist.
Fam, did you just say Cuba was a democracy? Could you elaborate on that please
As much as I despise almost everything born from Marx and loathe with the up most contempt how the post-modernists have twisted it and made it even worse, this video was very informative and interesting. It's quite funny actually I used to be a hard core anarchist a few years ago, then I encountered an ex-KGB agent called Yuri Bezmenov and made an effort to learn about the history surrounding all the various manifestations of socialism. Needless to say I would rather destroy all my belongings of value, commit Harikari on my; dog, sister, and partner before loading myself up with high explosives and killing as many innocent people as possible just so that wouldn't have to endure the shit show that is socialism.
Social democracy is probably the best way to go, but Americans are so afraid of anything that could even remotely be considered socialism that they reject it.\n\nCold War propaganda continues to fuck shit up
How about Felgelism?\nforgive me im just telling a joke.
Socialism is anti-capitalistic, capitalism is anti-socialism. Woah! :)
cina is communist, and is self proclaimed to be such
It starts at 3:17
Hey can you make a video like this but include the whole political spectrum?
By the end of the day, the ideas and values that people commonly associate with socialism are true in the Scandinavian countries. So not to get too poetic, but I feel the classic \"that which we call a rose, by any other name, would still smell as sweet\". Even if technically Bernie is wrong in his terminology, the point he is trying to get across to the American people is best communicated by using the word \"socialism\".
I like this video and find it to be constructive in tone. I don't know how helpful the info is, even if I want it to be. The video is not a history lesson, by any stretch, but sort of a bibliography/summary of a small selection of texts? Moving on, a comment:\n\n  A commonality in all decent arguments against Socialist ideologies is \nthat they fail to account for corruption. Of course nobody seems to have solved the issue of corruption, neither have Capitalists. \n\n  Nonetheless, I wouldn't go forward without at least keeping it in the \nback of my mind that corruption is a problem and could completely \nunhinge my idea of a perfect state, were it given the chance. When we \nthink of how nice it could be, we have to realize that corruption does \nnot in fact stem from a Capitalist state or culture, but from a big part\n of human nature itself. \n\n  You haven't made paradise by just \nchanging the system. The beginning of any solution, I think is to \ndisplace corruption and to discourage it using carrots and not sticks, \nso to speak. A culture (or cultural force or component) that emphasizes \nand values the positive aspects of human nature would go a long way \nregardless of the system. \n\n  In summary, I do not oppose socialism, but I oppose the dishonest way in which we wind up entertaining our ideas of socialism.
Great explanation as an introduction, but I'm still a right wing capitalist.
Society is not divided into 2. Instead it is divided into 4:Communism,Liberalism, Fascism and Anarchism.
4:42 So the percentage is pretty much a rough estimate?\n\n10:57 Human *nature\n\nGood video though!
I had my doubts.\nThen, anarchism was deemed to be an ideological branch of communism.\n\nC'mon lads, this video is clearly revesionist bullshit. They have nothing to do with each other ideologically and even fought each other in the spanish civil war.
Marxism appears to have many similarities to religion, in this case it echoes the way Christianity has split into many different sects. Catholicism spawned Protestantism etc. Communism spawned Socialism etc. Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism have a similar branching taxonomy.
Damn, I never thought Cubans looked so... stcik figury.
How the hell is communists stateless
Isnt Luxemburgism democratic socialism tho
Great video, thanks!
5:15\n\nI have a very sexy-learning disability. What do I call it kif?
the video was confusing and i didnt really draw any conclusions from it, so i went to your website, most of what you wrote seemed to be make belief. but your video production and website quality was on point. top marks for effort
Fuck you, american idiots! U have no idea of how is to live in a socialist country! U LIVE IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS A DREAM FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN SOUTH AMERICA. IF YOU WANT SOCIALISM, WHY DON'T U COME TO VELEZUELA??
Good video, it's good to get these vague definitions cleared
Thanks for not repeating that nonsense about \"socialist\" Scandinavian countries. It's one of these annoying fantasy stories that try to discredit studies that show the high productivity of capitalist countries. Denmark even has a school voucher system; it's just absurd to call them socialist.\n\nBut placing anarchists under socialists? How do you explain anarcho-capitalists? If an anarchist doesn't establish anything to block trade, aren't they pretty clearly capitalistic?
oh, nicely done, and presented neutrally, subbed!
Great video
Actually, The Norwegian government owns about 55% of the economy.
I don't think I fit into experts nor beginners in socialism. I have no political education, but my ideas and ideologies are pretty advanced. Even so, I haven't read any communist literature, and I have no plan to. Because, while it's probably interesting, it doesn't matter if you have your own system.
Do one for explaining liberalism, libertarianism, free market, capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, etc, etc!
Star trek is many things, but I would say stateless is not one of them. Consider that in the first episode of TOS, the federation still has a death penalty for a certain crime.
The problem of course with Cuba as a socialist state is how Democratic it isn't.\n\nSee, the thing is, Cuba has had a sum total of one free election for head of state. Fidel Castro ran the country for decades with only a limited democracy that could not oppose his dictatorial control.
When socialism fail but it's OK because it wasn't real socialism but your ideology fails but it's OK because it wasn't real socialism but your ideology fails but it's OK because it wasn't real socialism but your ideology fails but it's OK because it wasn't real socialism but your ideology fails but it's OK because it wasn't real socialism
Has anyone else caught the MAAAAAAAASSIVE Futurama reference?
so is communism theoretically a limit where the GINI coefficient approaches zer0? and why is it that everytime someone explains these subjects the point is made that there are no real communist countries?
anarchism is actually liberal capitalism, no where near socialism or communism. anarchism is similar to nature. no law. you can do what you want, when you want. it is ultimate freedom. obviously this comes with a few problems, like murder being legal. but  anarchists argue that if murder was legal, people still would not murder. similar to how banning abortion doesn't actually lower the rate of abortion. people still do it illegally.
Because pure Socialists and pure Capitalists are all too evil. so we have to find the balance........That's why nobody called themselves \"Pure Socialists\" or \"Pure Capitalist\" Even the Nationalists is also very bad. Though what they really want to do is only to preserve themselves (Country).
Very nice video, I really enjoyed it! I have two questions: Do you have a video syndicalism, and if not can you make one? And two, are you from sweden?
You did a good job camarade ??
I hold mostly conservative viewpoints and this helped a great deal, thanks for the video.
Social Democrats FTW
What do you do for a living, if i'm allowed to ask.\n\nYes I do find the argument, that you made at 10:46 and presented rather mockingly as if it's has SUCH an obvious answer, quite compelling.\nShould janitors earn the same as Doctors?\nI am not as educated as you in this topic and have not yet gone through your website, but could you (or someone equally as knowledgable) give me a short rundown?\nI mean why should i go through hell to major or even do my doctorate in engineering or medicine, when i'm not gonna get compensated for it. One can hope that people will take on harder professions simply because of passion, but that does seem like a little bit of wishful thinking.\n\nI am not trying to 'disprove' your viewpoint or anything, just looking to get some insight into a topic i've come to find really interesting.\n\nEDIT : Nevermind, i read the article on your website. Fantastic read!
Study economics, they are all command economies.  Where the government controls production rather the  consumers. Simple, easy to understand. Simple matter of amount of government control.
Nazis weren't socialist C'mon they are clearly fascists
Great content, The like-dislike ratio is probably due to the Free Speech warriors from kekistan
I think socialist is something you could be a bit of or a lot, like \"this country is more socialist than that one. From a perspective of America, Sweden is socialist for example. It's a spectrum from totally free market to communism
I don't see how anarchism can be considered a form of communism, or even a left wing ideology. \nAnarchism by definition demands no kind of rule, not even democratically elected rule.\nAnarchism is more cooperative-individualism than collectivism. \nTrue anarchism would be extreme right-wing-libertarianism.
4:20 dong energy ( ?° ?? ?°)
Just because a country describes itself as socialist doesn't make it socialist. North Korea calls itself socialist and we all know that isn't true.
Very lacking.
SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY ARE PRO-CAPITALISM, THAT WAS FUNNY.
I prefer Austrian economics, the only real »theory« of capitalism. In capitalism it is up to the people whether they demand something good or bad. Socialists, Marxists and other critics, however, blame it on the corporations, although they are only serving their customer's wishes. It's also a giant myth that is prevalent in so many people's minds, that workers are exploited, because entrepreneurs and employers only care about their profits. First, if people demand non-profit-oriented goods (such as flowers seeded by disabled people), then this poses a demand and therefore aggregate will change … again: profit. But would you call disabled people selling flowers ruthless or heartless profit-making? Second, if the employer does not treat his employees well enough, then they are free to change employer. Why? Because capitalism means freedom of contract, therefore there is no law in the world (except the society regards such as a prerequisite for its lawfulness) to hinder a person to offer better conditions of employment. Then there are also people who acknowledge this at least, but object: Capitalism has an intrinsic need for shortage of supply, for rationalization, for hardship. Therefore, the argument goes, we need representatives of various sectors to decentralize information and to bring about an informed society, where the danger of unemployment or hunger will be averted (although this attempt does not seek solution in the state). This argument can easily be refuted, I think: Why should I join a company that might soon be outdone by competition ? And if I can't predict that? Well, you should know: Either you choose a branch of business where change is not so rapid or you hope for a competitor to set its roots next to your home, so that you don't have to move. Or you apply to another firm. In the end, it's life: There is no perfect answer to what might possibly happen; however, capitalism is the best framework for society of all the bad ones that exist – at least that I know of so far. I did not quite understand yet the Social Threefolding by Rudolf Steiner, so this might actually be an alternative for capitalism, but so far capitalism definitely is an alternative for all the Socialist/Marxist/Statist systems.
Great video
Can you do same table for capitalism?
Åh hej, en till göteborgare?
My own version of keeping it apart was: Socialism is the spectrum, Marxism the ideas, communism the system. But I still learnt further distinctions so thanks.
The difference between communism and socialism is that communism is international and without currency.  The difference between socialism and fascism is that, in fascism, instead of a command economy, the economy is a highly regulated, highly taxed semi-free market.  Countries like Sweden are more fascist, economically, than socialist.  Your \"social democracy\" is basically fascism.
Great video. Thank you for this.
what is trotskyism and lenninism?
3:55\nI love how you snuck a hammer and sickle in there, you communist ;-)
Now we have Globalism a comunal social pooverty in a fascism regimen dressed like a liberal democracy.
Good video!
usually, countries ruled by \"communist party\" would have a \"socialist\" economy, and \"socialist party\" would have an \"social-capitalist\" economy, why? because it's the name of the party does not dictate the current state of the nation it ruled, but rather the direction it is trying to move the nation towards, hense, sweden, denmark, and nazi germany would govern a country with a free market. bernie sanders's ideology and belief falls into democratic socialism, but to deal with reality his policies would have to be social democratic, or even squarely in \"capitalism\", why, because reality don't conform to ideologies.
Not an expert here but I question whether a country can be called socialist when the ruling, and really only valid political party calls itself the Communist Party of China (CPC). Though their recent endeavors as a country have been pretty capitalist
Amazing video
The Nazis never called themselves Socialists. And they had a Mixed Market, where the government had legal control of your business, but it's yours in all sense except the legal/official sense. The \"Socialist\" part was basically a marketing campaign. By the time World War II kicked off, they were openly totalitarian and nationalist.
State-controlled / state-organized economy will only work if the people are the state. \n\nSo for me, communism will only work in combination with any type of democracy.
Scandinavia, where people can be socialist because they live in a capitalist utopia :3
I think you've missed something in the title: Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Various Types of Socialism
I don't know what makes me want to smash my head in more; the video or the comments.
Just seen someone call the British Labour party marxist-leninists. It made me want to slam my dick in a microwave
Just the problem with the USSR Pepole think It's communitist bit It's sosilist (sorry IF wrong spelling
Oh well and I tought socialism was the thing bettwing Capitalim and Comunism :P
Comrade bernie
There all trash. Monarchy for the win!
I may be a capitalist pig, but I can still appreciate how informative and objective this video is. You earned yourself a thumbs-up, mate!
4:20 dong energy
Slightly tenuous saying that Anarchists fall under the Socialist Umbrella. Some do, though some are fully capitalistic
Already a massive error, technically Marxism is Scientific Socialism the term is VERY vague and Marx himself never explained much regarding Scientific Socialism he may have laid out the foundations for it but he never wrote the idea, Engels did however go into more details, read Socialism: Utopian and Scientific by Engels.\nAnd Socialism is not a vague term, a MASSIVE error once again.\n\nThere is Utopian Socialism which is all fancy and visionary but it has absolutely no grounding in the material conditions of society.\nThen there is Scientific Socialism which does have grounding in the material conditions of society, its scientific and practical.\n\nThese are the only two forms of Socialist genres if you like that exists, then there is sub categories like in Utopian Socialism you may have Agrarian Socialism, French Socialism and Anarchism.\n\nIn Scientific Socialism you have sub categories like Marxist-Leninism, Trotskyism, Juche, Syndicalism to some extent and so on, there are of course TON more but I wont name them all since there so many.\n\nSocial Democracy is just Capitalism, period.\nIts a golden rule that for Socialism to exist there must be a plan and private property abolished, without private property you cannot have Capitalism either.\n\nThese two are a MASSIVE contradictions that people cannot seem to wrap their tiny heads around, you cannot have private property and then Socialism at the same time, its a contradiction likewise with Capitalism, you cannot have market economics without private property its basically the fundamentals of a market. \n\nStop reading shady websites, read some proper fucking books like the one I listed.
i dont  understand
LET'S BE CLEAR , SOCIALISTS WILL ALWAYS SAY \"IT JUST HASN'T BEEN DONE CORRECTLY\" OR \"IT'LL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME\" , BUT WE CAN JUST LOOK AT ALL THE TIMES IT'S BEEN TRIED(COMMUNIST, NAZI,FASCIST,AND A FEW OTHERS) LATEST VERSION IS IN VENEZUELA... IT'S A PARASITE, THAT FEEDS OFF OF CAPITALISM(AKA LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, WITH FREE TRADE, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS)!!!!!!!
what about Syndicalism
What's your favourite form of communism?
I had an idea for a system, I don't know exactly were it fits in, or if it already exists, and It is actually somewhat simple.\n\nI will describe it as detailed as i can.\n\nHere is sort of the process to achieve this system. \nCongress passes a law preventing companies from firing employees on the basis that they are part of an industrial union.\nCongress then passes a secret bill that creates an industrial union secretly run by the government.\nWith this new industrial union formed workers from all markets join it.\n\nThe industrial union controls everything pertaining to the economy, it prevents companies from paying low wages by threatening to move all of its workers to other companies and dismantling it.\nCompanies that benefit society more then others will have more workers given to it and will be given more gov't funds.\nCompanies that don't benefit society as much will lose workers and be given less gov't funds. (This is to keep competition and development of technology.)\nWorkers can work there way up like in a capitalistic society but as they get higher up they lose political power.\nThe Industrial Union would also be funded with taxes (Of course).\n\nIn this society a Billionaire would be allowed to keep his wealth but not be able vote or run for office.\nA middle class person would not be allowed to run for office but would be allowed to vote. (Or maybe the other way around)\nA working class person would be allowed to vote and run for office.\n(I'm calling this \"Class Compromise\")\n\nThis is currently all I have. I haven't defined what would happen for small businesses yet.\n\nIf anyone has an idea on how I could  \nimprove this system please tell me.\n\n\nI haven't come up with anything to prevent billionaires from paying its workforce large sums of money to revolt so the billionaire can get political power back.\n\nIf anyone has an idea what to name it that would be nice to.
Note: Dictatorship of the proletariat, is a misleading name to call it. It is simply just when the workers rule.
Thanks a lot for the video, subbed. My eclectic, unfocused ass has been looking for exactly this. Gonna check out that website. Cheers
I liked the ad
There's this dumb organization called SPGB that defines Socialism as the Communist Society and that unless the transition goes exactly the way Marx THEORIZED, NOT DEMANDED, it isn't Socialism. They also respond to everything someone they dislike tweets, whether they tag them or not. It also seems that they think the terms \"try\" and \"achieve\" are synonymous.\n\nI do think Bernie is a supporter of democratic socialism though. He just has no way of really achieving it and isn't a Marxist Socialist. The USA is too Capitalistic for Bernie to be able to quickly change it into Democratic Socialism.
great video! thank you!
great video! thank you!
Cuba is a totalitarian government, just like North Korea.\n\nAlso Communists is not the only Socialists groups. Socialists is a huge spread on the political left. Socialism existed well before Karl Marx and many religious cults followed socialism principals for centuries and have failed or regress backwards both socially and technology.\n\nI do not understood why anyone follow Communism after seeing the spectacularly failures operating under socialism principals and the collapse of communism in the 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s. It has always been a  major failed experiment on society that always leads to human rights abuses, mass deaths, mass arrests, mass spying and controlled with Military dictatorships.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/hi/index.html
tack så mycket för det!
socialism is not only the means of production being owned by the people but can also mean the people regulate the means of production . \nreal definition: a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or REGULATED by the community as a whole.
Nice video, your explanation was clear and understandable, and the website is very useful, Thanks !
Wouldn't it make more sense in form of a spectrum, with some definitions overlapping over 2 or 3 smaller definitions?
I disagree with you on pretty much every economic political thing but I still have to say that you make valid points and I understand your views. But one thing you got very wrong, Cuba is not fucking democratic!
You forgot the most prominent and relevant Marxism today - CULTURAL MARXISM.
You forgot \"cultural marxist\".\n\nOh wait no that's literally just bullshit that Hitler made up.
can someone PLEASE explain to me how u expect any of this to work at all anymore?\nits already been proven to not be effective (and what i mean is that and communist country that doesn't have any sort of capitalism is collapsing or has collapsed) so why do you still think it will work? and i swear to god if your reason is that \"it was't true communism\" or \"the government was corrupt\" i'l lose my mind
In my country, there's both a social democratic party and a democratic socialist party.\n\nIt's been very confusing to distinguish between them. I was a member of the democratic socialists, but they kept trying to align too much with the social democrats, so I left the party and joined the social democrats, so now I'm just a social democrat who believes in democratic socialism. \n\n(We also have more parties on the right, so don't assume having four parties on the left means we always win. It just allows people to have representatives that more closely represents your views, which makes voting much easier.)
It's so confusing to know what these things are as an idea, in practice, as the west sees it, as the \"east\" sees it and what people actually mean when they use these terms. Pretty good video anyway... But could you please redo this video without the mistakes and confusions, which goes into the details of all of this (history, ideology, practice, modern times etc.) and explains capitalism as well?
0:55 You are confusing things... Shouldn't you be using the Rod of Asclepius instead of the Caduceus? I have nothing against the video in general and I'm sorry to be \"cherry picking\" here, but this moment was pretty \"ironic\".
I was a bit luke-warm on this video until Obama showed up with the drone. ;)
Last post: one example of socialism by a Marxist directly elected by the people is Salvador Allende in Chile, overthrown by right-wing general turned president Augusto Pinochet by US CIA support & assistance. The current Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, an Europe-type socialist presides a country with a strong neoliberal laissez-faire capitalist economy. +
Other forms of communism or Marxism include Stalinism, Juche (North Korea), Castroism  & Titoism in neutral Yugoslavia. A mild form of communism in East Germany vs autocratic in Romania, differences in socialism between Hugo Chavez/ Nicolas Maduro in venezuela & Salvador Allende or Michelle Bachelet in Chile are noted, & Justicialism or Peronism. +
Liberal Democrats are more capitalist than Socialist Democrats who are also capitalistic. Conservative Republicans are not really fascists, if you want fascism, National Socialism (notice the name?) is for you. Many Conservative Republicans are Libertarian, which is anarchist. And many are actually social Liberals but they hold fiscal conservative beliefs. +
Thank for the clarity.  I am an American conservative, and I find great value in your objective, dispassionate survey of Socialism and its environs.  Well done!
God I love the Star trek reference and I believe it has meaning and we probably will go classless,money less because our technology will become advanced and the resources so common that we as a society won't need outdated concepts. BUT in today's world I don't think it's remotely possible if we want to advance because of technology and the limited resource that is earth.
no one agrees on the terms. It varies. End of
As an ex-Marxist myself, I can tell you not to listen to Marxists in how they define themselves or how they define themselves to other Left-wing groups. \n\nHuge problems in this video: \n\n1. Cuba is \"not communist\". This is a standard trope of communists: failed communism is not communism in their view, it is something else. Pretty much a conscious, stand up, old fashioned lie. \n\n2. Cuba is \"[A] public planned economy where elected representatives made decisions about the economy that would otherwise be made by private business service like where to built new factories\". \n\nGet that? He says, without irony or qualification, that \"elected representatives\" make decisions. Euphemism as farce. A very dry sarcasm. \n\nCuba is a simple totalitarian oligarchy with no democracy at all. There are no elections, they are an open farce. The central government decides which candidates are held in the municipal and national assemblies, and they decide exactly which votes to count. There has never been a choice in Cuba. It is a perfectly closed totalitarian system. Another simple, straightforward lie. \n\nThis is just the beginning of translating Marxism into English. There are hundreds of wrong statements, vastly wrong statements and total nonsense in this short video. It cannot be overstated how much this is shot through these people. Keep your eyes and ears open when watching this video, and think for yourself. These people want to think for you. Don't let them.
1:58\nWHAT? say it again, but slowly haha
So whats social democracy and how does it differ from normal capitalism or USA system?
The most interesting sentence in this video was the one where you said, \"Socialism is anti-capitalistic, and capitalism is anti-socialistic.\"\n\nJust a small tweak and you'd pull the truth out of the latter part: Capitalism is anti-society.
This is Gold.
how do u get someone to clean toilets under communism? the cleaner wouldnt have an incentive of money to clean the toilet :o\nstar trek works on that everyone is provided food and housing and pretty much anything they want within reason, and if they want to do something like be a doctor or engineer or whatever thats their choice, if they want to be a bum at home they can do that too.\nbut in star trek they have the technology of self cleaning toilets which is not common place in reality, so how do u get someone to clean the toilet? (how do u get someone to do a job that they dont want to do?)
america is not democratic because it would only be democratic if there was a spending cap on election spending cause that allows big business to support the candidate they want in power.\nReply
Just to explain things further, there are 3 axis of a country. The first axis is economic, the second axis is political and the third axis is society. Based on these definitions:\nNazis:\nEconomically centre-left (social capitalism)\nPolitically far-right (fascistic dictatorship)\nSocietal far-right (national socialism)\n\nCuba:\nEconomically Left (socialist)\nPolitically centre-Left (representatively democratic)\nSocietal centre-right (conservative)\n\nChina:\nEconomically centre (social-mercantilist)\nPolitically centre-right (controlled democracy)\nSocietal centre (liberal-conservatism)\n\nSweden:\nEconomically centre-left (social capitalism)\nPolitically Left (proportional democracy)\nSocietal left (progressive egalitarianism)\n\nBernie Sanders:\nEconomically centre-left (social capitalism)\nPolitically centre-left (representative democracy)\nSocietal left (progressive egalitarianism)\n\nIn case you're working:\nEconomic far-left (total-communism)\nEconomic far-right (crony-merchantilism)\nPolitical far-left (anarchism)\nPolitical far-right (fascistic dictatorship)\nSocietal far-left (religious-ban minority-superiority cultural-removal)\nSocietal far-right (Jingoistic xenophobic devout-religious)\n\nHope this further helps explain things.
The term \"democratic Socialism\" is wrong. Socialism is always democratic, and if it's not, it's simply not Socialism.
Accurate for the most part, I just disagree when it comes to the nazis, but anyhow...
Ner med både Socialism och kommunism
you got almost nothing right in this video.
AAAAAAAAAJAJAJ CUBA¿! DEMOCRACY¿!!!!! GOOD JOKE BRO!!!!.. but awesome explanation either way :D
I don't get how communism can be anarchistic. Communism doesn't work without an administration to dictate who gets what. Anarchism means \"No rulers\" ... so that administration can't exist. Under anarchy, the individual is his own ruler, and all transactions are voluntary between individuals. That's also the definition of capitalism.
Can you explain what is Capitalism and Democracy then?
I really wonder what the achievement of communism would look like.
So, socialism is just a buzz word?
Azure Scapegoat... Any relations with Teal Deer (TLDR)?
Great video. I would call myself a communist and an individualist. I take a lot of influence from the Zapatistas in Chiapas, Mexico on how to create a society free from governmental and market influence. Only a self sufficient society free from these systems can be communist.
Thank you fir not putting the flag of germany 1939 in the video.\notherwise it'd of been :\" not available in my country...\"
What about Trekonomics? You should do a video on Trekonomics...
someone had to fucking make it
Why does anarchism fall under collectivism? \nI find they seem like mutually exclusive terms. For example; Individualist collectivist, Anarchist communist, Etc.
You didn't talk about Vietnam, a socia... a REAL socialist country.
How would Leninism and Democratic Socialism differ? Didn't Lenin support democracy, since he did say that socialism was inherently democratic? Was Luxemburg also not a revolutionary Democratic Socialist?
Subbed :)
So wehre does NSDAP fall?
I would love to see the video on how Cuba is a democracy.
I believe a combination of capitalism and socialism is the best way to go
A goat and a pentagram, interesting choice of symbols.
i still didnt understand what happen and doing in soialisem and communisem and what happend in capitalisem????
You clearly need to take a few economics courses because kaynsiamism is very differnent from democratic socialism but according to your definision they are basically the same.
thx for the furutama reference
Marx created communism so why marxism?
But do you think that any of these so called \"communist parties\" are making any significant progress towards communism from socialism in modern day?
\"I have no source for these figures\"....\n\nthen shut your fucking mouth!
The welfare systems go the Scandinavin countries is NOT paid for by the government. It is paid for by the people - through taxes.
Difference between collectivism and individualism.
180 sanders voters were here. aka losers.
Can you make a video about with which Socialist and Capitalist social and economic policy you believe has best been implemented? The pros and cons of those 2 examples?
I don't see how anarchism is a socialist ideology. Isn't anarchy by definition the lack of government, and socialism is big government (or ends up being). So less/small governmental control is more anarchist  i.e. capitalism. \n\nAnd you can sing the praises of socialism/communism all you want, and they are beautiful ideas, but they never work because people suck and are by nature greedy and only put in effort if it benefits them.
Could you do a vid on benevolent dictatorship, please?
all of the terms you referred to were coined at one point, this would help people realize what the definitions actually mean. each term has a historical context and a definition. you made some nice graphics, but didn't support your definitions with any facts.
I learn more Thank you
I visited the website and i feel it very dishonest not to mention the book Gulag Archipelago.
very nicely graphed!
So where would you put Stalinism?
Oh by the way I quite watching the new star trek just because of the social justice bullshit.
You forgot to mention corporatism under capitalism, which is a plutocracy.
I thought socialism covered regulation as well, not just ownership?
Interesting. An informative look at the socialist *isms from the eyes of a believer. You didn't really get into why Sanders, Scandinavia, and such are so associated with socialistic ideas and where they'd go toward them which would be interesting. \n\nHowever, I can't help but notice that most of the labels/identities provided where from what groups said about themselves which is different from how things played out in history. This, especially so, since so many had hostile takeovers of prior governments or of their own established socialist governments and based a whole lot of it on propaganda and lies. A different but related topic perhaps, but socialism can't be separated from forms of influence and questions of \"who has control?\" given the nature of the ideology so I'd love to see a presentation on how things played out for historical groups with similar summation and maybe some added objectivity.\n\nThanks for presenting the info, it's useful and informative.
I'm openly a centrist libertarian, but I want to remain open to all ideas and ideologies.  You explain this topic very well.  Subbed
I'm so lost.  I guess I'm not smart enough to understand this.
I like your video! Are you aware of the YouTube alliance? The cross promoting of channels. Especially those with under 1000 subscribers. We are subscribing to one another and promoting our channels. Since YouTube is censoring and demonetizing YouTube videos.
You are wrong that a Socialist government  must \"own\" the means of production or businesses. It is in fact the \"control\" of it. You obviously have a bias.
Coming from a libertarian perspective, I think this is a very well done video and there's very little I disagree with.
great video comrade
classical marxism does not believe that the transition stage is called socialism. The version of marxism that you referred to is marxism-leninism
My head hurts now.
Probably the best description of socialism is that, socialism is a term for an economic system and social arrangement within a production based on the idea of social ownership and democratic control of the means of production.
Is there some ideology for socialism that doesnt have a immigrant friendlt policy adn if so what would that be called?
actually germany has almost no trade. they pride on being self sufficient. something retained from their fascist days.
this video made me realise that im a marxist thanks
well marxism itself (especially classical) dont say socialism is seprerate, the difference is a transition yes but the definition of that transition is different, orthodox marxists and tendecies before leninism tends to not belive that he ment a state and socialism but that socialism and communism are the same thing (which I agree with, which also further confuse things for non socialist people lol) from my knowladge Lenin is the first one who interperted it as socialism and communism being different and that socialism is the so called transitionary stage from capitalism to communism, while others such as myself interpert this as the socialist victory and organizational period that obviously happen before socialism manifests itself, but overall good video  subbed
w8, r u a göteborgare
I don't even like the definition you provided of socialism. It's not broad enough. To me, it seems like the definition you provided would exclude libertarian socialism. Really, I would define socialism merely as the democratic control and social ownership of the means of production. That is a little broader than your definition, because it allows for a decentralized version of socialism. When you say it's when the means of production are regulated by the community as a whole, it makes it seem like it has to be an entire country doing it, which I reject that notion. I believe that a nation of worker cooperatives would be a socialist nation, and on wikipedia, cooperative economics(an economy of cooperatives) is mentioned as employing socialist ideas. The form of economy I support is cooperative individualism, and I would still call myself a libertarian socialist.\n\nI consider worker cooperatives to be anti-capitalist. Capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production, in which there is private property. If you look up private property on wikipedia, it specifically excludes cooperatively owned property from the definition. This is why cooperatives are anti-capitalistic, and I consider them to be a socialist business model.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't call Cuba socialist. I consider them state capitalist. Cuba is not democratic enough to be considered socialist. The ONLY time state ownership of the means of production means it is socialism is if the state is democratic. Cuba is totalitarian, and not democratic. Thus, they are state capitalistic.\n\nThe same is of the USSR, they were totalitarian, and the people weren't really given much democratic choice there. Because they had state ownership of the means of production, and the state was undemocratic, they were not socialist.
As an anarchocapitalist, I find your analysis very objective. I do wish I could be so impartial. That merits a sub, I believe.
Overall it's a pretty good explanation, with two major errors: Orthodox Marxism is generally considered to be completely distinct from Marxism-Leninism and its spinoffs, and orthodox Marxists are often against classical Leninism (theory of imperialism, Vanguardism, etc.) as well. To an orthodox Marxist, Leninism would constitute a form of \"revisionism\" to classical Marxism, even though Leninists would argue it's an adaptation of Marxism to an age of so-called imperialism.\n\nThe second major issue is your treatment of the National Socialist party. While the party had \"socialist\" in their name, they didn't call themselves \"socialist\" or aim to replace capitalism with socialism outside of a small faction that was purged from the party in the Night of Long Knives in 1934.
i disagree with communism and socialm but this was very interesting
Please, do moreof this!
Thank you so much for the video, I have started paying more attention to this broad topic and I am pleased with the way you explain things.\nI hope you upload something on Marxism as a whole soon... left your notification on :)
What about the tens of millions (~70 mi at least in Mao's China only) of people killed in the name of Marxist ideologies? Do not come with \"it was not real Marxist!\" silliness, please. No sane person wants anyone to keep trying to get \"real Marxism\"... \n\nThat said, thanks for the video! It's really succint and very precise.
tfw DeLeonism isn't mentioned
Thanks for the info ! It was really clear and understandable !
I liked the concept and agreed entirely up until the chart. I personally would have had it set up differently. I would have expanded anarchism to include a portion outside of the Communist box to include ideas such as Georgism and Mutualism, and the various Marxist tendencies that aren't necessarily Orthodox Marxist might fit better in a separate category. Luxemburgism, which is debatable as an ideology on ts own, is the only one that would fall under Orthodox Marxism. I would enjoy seeing a more in depth version of this that gets into the more complex areas of discussion, such as ML vs Trotskyism/MLM vs Hoxhaism/Vanguardist Marxism vs non anarchist forms of Libertarian Socialism
Thank you for this!
Great video! Hope to see more of them here
Great video, really helped me!
Are you a swede?
cool video comrade, you have earned a sub
Scandinavian Countries = Social-Democracy/Social-Liberalism; the means of production are owned by the elites, but basic key industries are owned by the state.\nUSSR/Cuba/ etc = State-Socialism/State-Capitalism; the means of production are owned by the state.\nNone = Socialism/Communism; the means of production are owned by the people.
I have to show this to my friends
Very good video, thank you. Could you do videos on both the method of governance (and the successes and failures) of the USSR's state and Maoist chinas state? I am quite interested in both but there isn't much available on the internet.
Liked and subscribed (i love your website, shared it with my friends)!
Great video and super informative!
Every other democracy can be explained by. 1 vote per citizen in a given district. WTF is a the electoral college but an undermining of the people.
all that yelling & i still think your voting system is complicated for no fucking reason
This is so uninteresting that the words sound like mumbo jumbo
As a Canadian I found this video very interesting and informative. Yes, it's somewhat editorialised but that's okay.
Yes You Know It's FIXED After Communist LeftTard ShitLiB CUNT Nancy Policy And DemoRats Win lol. BullShit! Kill The CUNT! God And Guns
What???? vote, don't vote, cancel your vote???? >angry person> Democrat ????
Have you ever noticed that when Americans explain things they speak reaaaly slooowly... For the people that voted Trump no doubt lol
What do you mean my vote didn’t matter to pick the next president! I turned in my ballot!
I wanted an explanation, not an editorial.
There should only be ONE political party- The constitutional patriotic party.
wtf why do Americans have to make their political system so complicated
Why do you sound so angry?
Sorry l fell asleep at the 3 minute point what happened no seriously the problems with western politics is two party politics system we need a five party system to equalize the democratic system then you have true democracy eg: left (Greens Party), centre left (Labour Party) , centre ( Democrat), centre right ( Liberal Democrat ) right (Republican Party) god forgive us
“Unless you vote in the state elections, you have no say in presidential elections.... so you should just cancel your vote.” Why not just start paying attention to and start voting in your state elections lol
Im not sure how canceling your registration helps the peoples situation. It is ignorant to suggest people should denounce tbe only power afforded them. True power in America lies i the Senate and house and in local government. A president is an over rated fly by night toi be discouraged enough to rescind voting rights is weak and frankly a demonstration of your cowardice. People will take you seriously and if new young impresionable voters wat h this y ou are libel to hurt tbeir hopes in improving our broken system. Abandonement is a clowns solution and you sir a king Bozo please kill yourself as your weakness is infesting the genetics of a fine people. Lack of trust and faith in government should be met with movements to challenge the status quo not pussying out... smh. Did you actually hear yourself? Dont vote at all continue to let the senate and house plunder our nation and please their foreign masters because you have no actual say in presidential election.. in summary that is your suggestion. Are you dead yet? Please shoot yourself quickly
Worse than a rant. You sound more like a Russian bot, trying get get people to give up their voting rights. I suggest primal scream therapy for anyone who views this.
I nearly fell asleep
'The Americans have come a long way' - Optimus Prime
American Government,please don't prohibit India and don't make hard rule against India.Talent person not reside only in America but also in other countries(I know slight remedy for live map casting from satellite to ample of people simultaneously).If you dare then discover electric vehicle requiring less time to be charged or atomic vehicle(two wheel or four wheel) depending on thorium element for enegy which could drive the vehicle for 100000 kilometres with only 1gram to 1 Kg thorium other than giving concentration to petrol-dizel problem.If we drow and put forth ‘trump card' all your card dismissed.I don't interest to live in America though so developed but if required supposed to live in poor African countries to test and for testimony of my knowledge & talent otherwise living in such already developed country like America.Don't give trouble to developing countries like India and Venezuela etc.Take into consideration of fraternity.As you(American Government) prohibited exchange of fuel, petrolium products(petrol,diesel) since 12-15 years back and made exchange with dollors,Iran didn't give us petrol-diesel like petrolium products in exchange of vegetables and edible oils etc.If we found precious stones like Moon stones,Mars stones, then we don't give it to you in exchange of dollars though you make/made act to exchange or transaction in dollors only,then you obays law but breaks the soul.For that precious stones give us vegetables,fruits,edible oils,Urenium etc. from your country(America) only, as price of that precious stones.Then you know difficulty to lift such commodities and it's transport through air-plane and ship to destination site.Also if one throw vegetables,fruits,edible oils on you(American Government),you will never be injured otherwise if one throw these precious stones on you then you definitely get injured.Thanks You.??????.
Thank you. I am British and this is extremely helpful. You speak eloquently
What was said is not censorship words, I will not translate! And this is 70-90%! Europe think with your head and nezhopoy! Or maybe Russia has also poisoned the Violins? )))) And in the Duma of people ?? What a nonsense!?!?!?! Even listening is ridiculous !!! )
Understood that usa is à big devil.
The Ending, why???
Good video but man why are you yelling like that?
Well now that's clear as piss!
This is more a rant than an explanation
Your explanation is good. I read and watched a lot of info on this and this is one of few sources that is super clear so thanks!
Thanks for that blast of angry music. It really helped bring about the changes you seek.
you sound pissed off! look around see how the majority of humanity is ruled. try one for couple months.
Meh, voted for trump cuz he iz real good at trollin
I think the big take away here, if your government is corrupt and abuses its power it will destroy the government and some crazier mofo will come along and take over.
Lol good video but I think its way to late now.
Hold up...So you're saying the Roman republic became an empire...because welfare destroyed it's economy? WTF I call bullshit
This is a wonderful propaganda piece.
republic means there is rule of law Ok, but the limited government still has to be controlled by someone by the few or by the many and someone has to set and update the limits to the government (the constitution and law's) the few or the many. So you see democracy is not contradictory to republic they are referring to different attributes of a government, one referees to who is ruling the other referees on the how the processes of ruling happens!!!
Anarchy can mean replacing a government with anther more egalitarian institution or group of institutions like in anarcho-syndicalism even if i don't agree that we should strive for that
so anarcho - comunism, anarcho - syndycalism and forms of libertarian socialism were the workers control the means of production but the state does not have a big role is on the far right ? look politics is not one dimensional so any definition of right and left is gona be inadequate to describe politics. but there is a better factor than how big government is, and that is how egalitarian vs how authoritarian a society is in general (not only regarding it's government ). So for example if there is a small government but a small group of people that control some vital resource like the media or social media then that is authoritarian and if you have tons of undemocratic institutions (corporations) that control a lot of things then that system is very authoritarian even if the government does not play a role. But if the government limits there control of corporations it can make that system less authoritarian by giving part of the authority they have to the people, for example if a government makes illegal for social media companies to censor users then users will get better free speech. usually the left is defined as the egalitarian side but that is just definitions. Look we should look at the specific policies and results of governments not there place in a one dimensional scale no matter how it is defined !!!
I have a question: How do you start a republic? Who establishes this ruling law? And who is in charge of improving or updating the law as technology rapidly makes advances, resources change dramatically and international relationships grow together or apart? Is the law a self-correcting entity? No, so don't you need to trust at least a group people to correct this law? How do those people get chosen without any sort of democracy? I don't see how you can separate a republic from a democracy and act as if they're completely independent alternatives.
You are wrong about anarchism. Have you ever looked into brehon law?
This video is OK. It fails to mention the effect that things like capitalism react to a republic. The problem with a rule by only law is who gets to decide the law and why. You never mention that. When capitalism gives the most power to a few then they have more influence over the law. Then you end up with an oligarchy disguised as a republic. Government is not everything. That's forgotten by many. Part of the equation is also the people. People can lie and cheat and find ways to gain power while bending the rules. That has impact. That's why social program come into place. To balance out capitalism and keep the republic a republic.
LOL. You changed your Left-Right ideological spectrum into a Big Government-No Government spectrum. Those aren't the same things, dummies. You can't just declare all of the ideologies to be on Leftist because you made a spectrum in which they would all end up on the left. What if I made a spectrum labeled "No Military" to "Big Military"? Then would all of the ideologies by Right-wing?

Republic : aka the oligarchy where the oligarchs who made your laws (the constitution) are already dead. And if you have troubles caused by lack of foresight in a constitution, written by people who had no way of predicting each and every aspect of modern life, if you need to change it, you'd have a real hard time to go about it. Meanwhile, people who already benefit from the flaws of the constitutions, will fight tooth and nail to prevent you from changing it. Just look at the second amendment, and what havoc that wreaks.
If i remember Geroge wa stated that he would not accept the position as king!
such editing
I am very new to politics but I know that a modern day republic does not work. Our founding fathers I think had good intentions in creating our system of government. However, they did not plan for the corruption of it today.
Democracy=Republic. The first word is in greek d?µ??+??at? and the second is in latin res+public. They both mean EXACTLY the same. Obviously you have no clue as to how the Athenian democracy worked or what democracy is. Of course there is rule of law in democracies. Equating democracy with mob rule is plainly ludicrous, misleading and historically ignorant.
Are you kidding me? Go back to school before you start trying to teach anyone else anything. You are not that bright.....
Monarcy or dictators definitely have existed. Haha Obviously yes they will have advisers but in the end whatever the one ruler says is the law.
best video, all doubts cleared
I hope this isnt the general american view on canada's government.
Can someone answer me. Is a republic a oligarchy?
What? Anarchy = no law? Do you think that no ruler = no rule? What a cheap goofs around here
Great video. Can you make a Canadian version please?
Without God, all of your nation will colaps! Without Jesus, the Son of God, all of your efforts are useless! Without the Bible, all of your education is foolishness! Without the Church, all your rest is without peace.
We thank you in spirit for prayers Compendiums as we are learning about witchcraft, witches, warlocks,wartime, warlords and everything else informaciones continuing to learning what to do with as in prayers Compendiums and safeties represented
Usa is now an oligarchy soon too be total dictatorship
Wtf did I hear Fnaf 2 menu music
LOL...this is Fascist propaganda....
On Rome ; a key factor in their decline was inequality and rich landowners using slaves to put small farmers out of business using free labour. This created the mobs in Rome.
Does anybody still cling to the quasi-religious notion that the U.S. is NOT a plutocratic oligarchy?!
America is moving toward oligarchy. It is become more evident every day. What a shame. GOD gave us our Republic and we are giving it away to Satan.
Very good video teaching tool.
soon as I heard the american accent I new it was going to be a terrible video only 1 min in and wonder if this is what gets taught in the US, I feel sorry for the highly miss informed students.
Even though I agree with republic ( yes, I'm a republican, but don't worry I won't put a gun up to your head if you think different ) but no government is perfect because republic could have a corrupt law.
I didnt like this documentary for its simple and banal propaganda to make greater the republic atacking the very basis of all other sistems, and not showing thier true argumentum...
Anarchy, is isn't absence of law... Insteed, as one of my masters state "Organization Above All" Anarchy is all around us my friends... all true order emerge truly from that and in truth and virtue are keeped. Just don't stop asking, and open a bit our mind...
The USA did become an oligarchy. Ruled by the top 2% elites.
We see today a big different between the poors and the richs. There are few people in the world who has the 95 percent of all the money. Socialism is the best ideology we need today!!!
Dictators do solely rule... and eliminate those in their way.
Best Way to Explain.
i detect a slight bias here
I know its basic forms of government but the oversimplification of everything but the Republic screams propaganda. Not to mention the severe lack of understanding Roman economics is like watching someone just make shit up as they go.
so, if a state structure doesn't exist - in other words without the threat of violence - people will immediately start attacking each other? paranoid much?
The way you're arguing against democracy also applies to capitalism. In both systems it's the majority that decides. In capitalism it is always produces what most of the comsumers want to buy. So if it is unfair towards the individual when the majority decides over right or wrong, then it should also be unfair when the majority decides what is produced and what not!
So the far right would be anarchy?
Yeah, anarchism is bad because people are bad by nature and will get away with anything if they tried... I don't believe it. Under anarchy, there would be no corporations, no money, and no government. In theory, separatism wouldn't exist either. Instead of being further divided by anarchy, we would be drawn closer together. The mass media tries to label anarchism as something to be afraid of only to convince the masses that the system should stay the way it currently is; a corrupt hierarchical land of censorship with the false image of freedom.
Sooooo fluuuent English OMG ??
You guys rock!!!

This is why people are divided there should be no sides just whats best for everyone. And suck a titty friday needs to be a thing.
You spoke so fast I seldom understood.Thanks.
If you want REAL change... I'm running for the 2020, anyone wants to know what I'm about, Google Harold McBroom In Reverence to Thee click on obvious link, when page loads, click on Candidate Harold J. McBroom
I don't get it
I think we should have a lower minimum wage but a higher tax rate so we could increase the ammount of jobs but still have benefits for the extremely poor. What party do I belong to? I also think we shouldn't spend a bunch of money on the army unless we are being direct attacked and belive we should live on a more environmentally friendly earth with lots of health care. Another belief for me is that people should not be put in jail if they commit a crime, this is because putting people in cages and giving them crappy food for years and then letting them out will severly damadge their brain and make them worse then they were when they went in, people that commit crimes should be forced to go on an extremely healthy diet and they should be brain scanned to check if their brain damage is curable.
Your explanation was great but fast and contains hard sentences, complex syntax and difficult context to grasp sometimes.. I got some ideas even I do not understood all what you said!!
"Eagle doesn't get to decide anything."
1. Convince the poor they have a choice 2.Divide the poor 3.Divide the poor 4. Divide the poor 5. Divide the poor
Two major things wrong with this picture, Electoral college and only two parties. The electoral college is just a really weird system that really doesn't represent at all what people vote. And two parties? It's just odd. We have parliamentary elections every 4 years with set number of representatives chosen, by people voting for them. There can pretty much be as many parties as you want, but if people don't vote any representatives for the party after two elections they are out of parliament. Then there are presidential elections every 6 years which is is a lot less complicated than latter, it's in either one or two stages. But when you get more than half of the votes you have won, in second stage you just put first and second against each other. Every party can put one candidate. One person gets one vote and it goes directly to results. This is the stripped down version of it. Ofc I don't think you could necessarily straight copy this to the US, but it's a heck of a lot more power to people.
I want my own party
This guy's sense of humour is off the chain!
George Washington warned against the 2 part system in his farewell address. It's hard to find anyone who totally agree with one party or another party.
HOW CAN THE UNITED STATES BE UNITED WITH POLITICAL PARTIES

SLOW DOWNNNNNNNNN
I absolutely love these videos!! I am in American Government 1113 and we watch some of these for homework, but I use them to study all the time. I really love Government so it's amazing to have an education video series that is serious but funny all the same. Also I anxiously await the eagle punch every episode!
poor eagle
Please stop doing the whole eagle schtick
i am the 1000th comment, i am superior
Comment 1,000
Great
Not bad
was anybody else majorly dissapointed with this video? Maybe dissapointed is the wrong word... The guy did an alright job explaining things (even though this guy seems like the type of that has read and mastered every DAD JOKE on the planet, yet he still hasnt ever made anybody laugh with one...) Anyway, Yes this is good information for our youth to know. Yes there maybe adults that need this information as well. I just assumed that everyone was like myself. As in when we are kids and we learn about voting for the president. The first thing we learn is pick a person... Then almost with the same breath. We are told about political parties and how you dont get one without the other when it comes to voting. My dossapintment though comes from typing multiple different criteria into the search box. Onky to have this video pop up at the top on 3 separate searches. I was actually looking for a detailed insight on the 4 different major political parties and how they all differ and some similarities they may share. At the gloriois age of 29 now, i would consider myself right of center. Although i considered myself A Democrat when i started out in my first election in 2008 and voted for a very young,handsome, incredibly well spoken Barrack Obama.(i got to meet Sen. Obama in KS when he came back to his mothers home town when I was at college on that same home town. still have the pictures!) anyway... i was like most Teen/young Adults and was ready for CHANGE in our world. We were tired of wars and the old way of thinking. It was a beautiful and exciting time of technology and the Future. And it felt at that point in time that what we were doing was EXTREMELY important and that in the early 2k that our time was going to go down in history as a pivotal moment in US history. Rights for every minority group. Legalizing marijuana. Very Very Progressive ideas were just starting to become mainstream, but... there wasnt extremist factions of the far left or right right at this time. It really did feel like how Hunter S. Thompson would describe California in the 60s. ( you just knew for some reason that tgis exact place and moment in time was historicallyt? important and that people would look back and it and wonder what life was like during that time) We just all collectively agreed that the world needed a young well spoken Bi-racial man to represent the face of the greatest nation in the world. at this turn of the Millennium, were we new t world was going to see amazing inventions and achievements within society. We thought that nobody better represented a New Start to a New World and to a new way of thinking as a very open minded race of humans. And we wanted America and Obama to be the embodiment of the 21st century.( even when i was in 7th grade we did an election for President and i voted for Gore instead of Bush. kind of shows how progressivness was in the air during the Millennium even tgough nome of us knew wgat progressive ideological views were back then. Anyway... as i grew older and you start figuring out that life isnt wgat u thought after college and that if u really want something in life that you and only you can make it happen while at the same time LIFE is going to actively try and stop you from getting it, in hilarious but yet cruel ways of teaching you to be humble and appreciate simplicity. So naturally once i was 27 and was able to vote again i cast my vote as a republican. Directly reflecting my sour views as a human being and not wanting anybody else to fall victim to false dreams and hopes as i once did. Hopefully giving 2017s recent graduates a head start on life that i wasnt afforded. But even though my views had become more republican throughout my 20s and how i can very easly see the connection between my own disappointment in how life actually ends up turning out for the majority of Americans. ( theres always exceptions) if i lived on tge california coast, had no kids, and was in killer shape getting laid by fine beautiful women every night..... id probably still be a little on tge progressive side of things. B U T The deeper i reflect on my views now days and really within the last year. i feel i fell victim to muhh own stupidity yet again. Just so happens that it is the polar opposite of the spectrum this time around. 18yr i was to caught up in the atmosphere and voted as a reflection of all of these external factors. 27yr again i was so caught up in this atmosphere of not wanting to relive the last 8 years of my life only wishing to feel alive again as i once did. i decided to cast a vote based on anger and disappointment. An internal atmosphere if you will. Almost as if an actioj of rebellion! where i wanted to do the exact opposite of my previous vote. 2007 i cared about the world and injustices and wanted to make the whole world a better place. But 2016 i wanted to worry solely about me amd wanted everyone to have to fight there own battle just as i did and wanted everyone to make mistakes and to suffer just as i did to make ends meet. that why should other people get an easy VIP pass whenever i cant even get into the party! iys a very sad way of reflecting on what is EXTREMLY recent history to me. and its very disappointing to know that barely a year ago i feel like i was a much different person than i am now... So as ive heard on many of my favorite podcast. im going to continue to make mistakes and dissapoint myself well into my 50s-60s. but im hopping now that i can try and not repeat making the same kind of mistakes that i have before. but it seems in life with every knew challenge you face. youve probably faced it before.... just with a different name or place and with lots of varying factors that make it seem completly different. when in fact its almost exactly the same. Im sure this is going to be much more difficult than im expecting, but... tgats part of me being prepared! So my first step is going to content and happy witg polotics. the more i look at things i always try and tell people im just slightly right of center. I believe in a lot of things on both the left and tge right. but not all of eitger of the two. so... ive been told i am a Libetarian... which is perfectly fine, but this video i clicked on and have now written a 10 page article over. lied to me and said 3 seperate searches that this would answer my now 15 year long confusing journey on what it is to live in America.... Thank You
Noice
I understand, like, nothing.
craig is suck
The lisp. oof
I'm being forced to watch this.
I like how all the democratics were black
How did you make that party gun can you show me a website to huy or help me know how you made if it was done by yourself and company

govermentsuspiciontheorys.jimdo.com
Ngl it's much harder in America to say that the party reflects the candidate as the parties in the US incorporate broad views and, in the 60's, weren't ideologically different at all

I am all about civics! sub to me!
these videos are weird
7:34 that is a very orwellian reason for political parties. For a person to not know and cut corners concerning information for who they are voting for is nothing short of lunacy
My major right now at College is Political Science. My Political Party is Republican. I'm attending Political Science class this Fall Semester in 2017.
Are there sources for anything these videos say? Also it would be good for him to say bis biases

political parties + debate + president chosen =election + result
I like to watch Crash Course because it really helps me to do my history papers and all my homework.
Got a joke, just for you. Why do they call political parties, parties? Because of all the clowns in them! Hehe. See it's funny because it's true.
I've learned more from these 10 minute videos than I have sitting in an hour and a half lecture twice a week for the past semester. Thank you.

As a European I have always wondered: What is the story behind the donkey and the elephant as party logos?
Just because someone has a different opinion than you doesn't make them stupid, uneducated, and it doesn't give you the right to assume you know who they are and what they've been through. We constantly argue until the arguing dissolves into name calling and threatening. We don't even try to see things from a different perspective most of the time. We're thinking selfishly. How hard is it to just try to be more open minded for once, especially when this election is going to have an impact on the whole world? Just once?
hey
PLEASE SLOWWWWWWW DOWN WHEN TALKING! I try to use these videos to study, but you talk to fast for me to really process what you are saying......please slow down a little
I just want to understand the elections but I don't even know what liberal and conservative means.
i love this channel!!!!!!
Dude you're so funny its great lol
Great Video but slowwwww it down a bit on the talking... Slowwwww it dowwwwn. I got everything you said but damn lol.
you speak 50 words a second
If you were a Muslim, I would vote for Donald Trump just to get you thrown out of the country, you fat waste of space.
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. KEN BONE bout to take your job An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
The moral of this series: If you have no friends and have a sense of humor that makes people want to jump off the space needle. All you need to do is make a spinoff series on the same channel as someone who actually has an ounce of charisma, and trick people into thinking it's the same thing.
2:54 ALL of these things could easily be done without the divisive allure of political parties perpetuating a tribalistic mentality in our political system. Outlaw political parties 2016!
Got it thanks
I was in bed when he mentioned having a campaign in getting out of bed...
all of this is proved wrong by the 2016 election
I've made gotv calls for bernie sanders
7:51 Well, the Speaker would more likely than not come from the majority party because a minority candidate for Speaker would likely not receive any votes from the majority (and hence not be strong enough to win). However, it's not a requirement for the Speaker to be a member of the majority party (but there are few reasons why it wouldn't happen), and it's definitely not true that only majority members can vote for Speaker.
I love you crash course
The very forming of political parties is illegal under U.S code 2385, the group/party is the Government itself . G..........GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nationalism, Socialism, Communism, Capitalism, Democracy, Republic, Liberalism, Conservatism, Theocracy, Aristocracy, Dictatorship, Monarchism, Imperialism. Fascism, Colonialism, Federalism, Oligarchy, Anarchism, Constitutionalism, and other Party Formalities can be hard and mixed in between the what they truly want some of them use certain groups as Escape Goats it is mainly like a game of chess or checkers or something along the lines of those games lots of manipulating, lying, deceiving, taunting, verbal attacks, emotional attacks, spiritual attacks, and even rarely some physical attacks. So many scandals can go on at any one given time and half of the time it can go so rapidly before you can actually know what hit you and how and where and who it may have come from. Mostly you have to be out for yourself first and foremost and do whatever or whichever tactics you may find deeming appropriate and useful to get your way to the top of the pyramid or in this case office. Much mind games and strategical and tactical decisions must be made as well as sacrifices but unfortunately I do not think I have enough backbone to get whatever I may deem that has to be done. In terms of American Politics and Governance I am aware that this country originally in the highest form was made from Free Masons not sure if they are part of the Illuminati or not or some other secret society people criticize as being a terrible domain of torture and ritualistic life sacrifices in the name of more power for ones self. In truth people fear what they do not know not that I cannot always fault them for that. As I do myself sometimes too.
I suggest not to speak so fast on your next blog. Though it was helpful.

I wish this guy wasn't such a douche bag because the info is good.. hard to watch
The party party makes every thing a party
Forming your own party doesn't work on any level higher than municipal, there's a reason why those U.S.A. is basically a 2 party oligarchy at a federal level.
07:45 pick your team, pick a mascot.
You didn't mention the Wide Awakes.
4:57 So?
Good info, but holy cow you talk fast! Here I thought I did!
I take issue with the example that Republicans are "pro-business". A more accurate assessment from a conservative perspective is that conservatives are "anti- over-reaching big government". This includes taxes. In a free market system fueled by competition, businesses have good reason to invest in itself to deliver a better product. If they don't they will fall behind. For this reason, a business is generally more likely to take actions that result in more good for the general economy using more of its own profit than the government could. The idea that Republicans are "pro-business" and "pro-wealthy" is a stereotype promoted by Democrats in an attempt to divide the electorate and gain support of those that aren't wealthy (which is most of us). A strong economy raises the standard of living for all more effectively than the efforts of a bureaucratic machine encumbered by red tape. The government would do better to encourage businesses to support local charity using tax incentives.
Ashamed how this country is not ran by good ideas anymore.
you talk so fast
But good video.
You should have explain the parties' structures and superdelegates.
2016 - 2020 will be horrible years for the US, regardless of who wins...
IM A PROUD REPUBLICAN PARTY GUY
FUCK THE 2 PARTY SYSTEM !!!
Oh my god, those jokes...

Where are the subtitles?????

What happened to John Green?
I hate political parties.
Man John Green is the best
cool
@3:41 he said the pay for a president is not great? a US president gets paid 400k a year, that is not bad at all. Yes been a president is tough and full of resposibilities but been a doctor is very demanding too and some don't get paid that much.
PLEASE DO ONE ON SPECIFICALLY THE RNC AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A BROKERED CONVENTION
If I understand this correctly, than I think my parents will be glad to know that North Carolina is an open primary state. They usually vote republican, but my dad in particular has become interested in supporting senator Sanders recently.
"Eagle doesn't get to decide anything"
LOL at 7:27 - Unless it's Hillary Clinton... in which case, you can assume that she stands for the GOP policies.
We need to completely disband parties as well as the electoral college. They have become a detriment to our democratic society and civil society on a whole.
5:58 so this is how donald trump happened
Shame on you, helping promote the "automatic politic": it doesn't matter (Acording to you) the point of view of the persons, but the line of the political group. This farse that is the representative "democracy" only serves to concentrate the power into the hands of the groups that manipulate it and maintaining "we the people" in our own pens so we never join forces to do anything. Of course, if there is a place on earth where "we the people" don't want to play that sick game, you are allways willing to correct such situation.
2:55 Now we know all the substeps in Step 2: ?????? 1. Collect Underpants 2. ?????? (see above) 3. Profit You see? Political parties are motivated by money.
Crash course can you talk about 2nd amendment rights, basic rule, limits on citizens and governments , incidents and some interesting facts(not including how many people die from gun violence and similar stuff)
5:19 "Delegates are not elected party members who actually nominate the candidates at the convention" - Are you saying "non-elected? I heard not elected, which is pretty confusing.
Craig, I really like your shirt. I want one.
I am offended by your eagle punching.
I love the course, but honestly, it should be called American Government and Politics. I'd love to see an international version comparing the systems of different democracies (which are surprisingly diverse).
is this the final episode??
The 2 party system is a failure. One party serves the rich and the other one serves... well... the rich.
WHERE IS JOHN GREEN COME BACK
Finally a new video ! I was starting to worry :) Keep on doing your awesome videos !
it's false to say Dems want more taxes and Repubs want less. Actually, the Dems want lower taxes for lower income and higher taxes on billionaires and large corporations. Or, at the very least, force billionaires and large corporations to pay the same tax rate. Also, to say "if  you don't like it, form your own party" is almost impossible, since the two parties have a duopoly and the system shuts down efforts to form new parties.

Why are both republicans white and both democrats black?
Wait...I like political parties better than regular parties. I hate regular parties.
#feelthebern bernie2016
I think about the U.S.S.R., where not only was there just one party, but that party was to be a god to oneself.
shouldn't the intro say 54 people have served as speaker b/c of paul ryan
Beware the comment section here, travel on if you dare!
What a BS of a democracy has only 2 parties in their government? Does that mean a party always has a majority?
Every time you release a new video, I get excited, then it's a big letdown when you don't have real captions.
I believe It would be useful to explore a bit of the history of political parties, where they come from, who where the first people to divide their society among parties, things like that. It would help many people to understand why they exist and what they serve for.
Like for the left! #Liberalism
Wheezy is the president of my heart.
I'm Australian and the nature of party membership in the US has always perplexed me. Who really is a 'member of the Democrats' or Republicans? It seems if anyone who registers with a party on enrolment can vote in a preselection, there's really no such thing as party membership any more.
Trump 16! because the born into billionaire who has been buying politicians to further his own profit his entire adult life, is recently all about the people??
Sanders 16! College should be free because all professors want to earn a lesser wage than the stoner cashier at McDonalds after dedicating their life to education! OR the stoner cashier would be a superior higher educator???
You really need to be checked if you support anything right wing. Honestly, the difference between democrats and republicans is that democrats ARE SANE.
let's start a political argument. your party sucks. I disagree with thier views and they are out of touch with reality.
"eagle doesn't get to decide. eagle doesn't get to decide anything."
is that a typo that says "congrefs of the united states" on the end slate?
The losing candidate in the graphic representing the open party election looked like Hillary. Is Thought Bubble trying to suggest that Republicans in open election states vote for Sanders?
Smash the $tate & abolish government forever! Anarchism is the future of humanity. Educate yourself, read everything & you will understand what I'm talking about.
You should do a video on corruption. Also, didn't you say you were gonna do a video on the federal reserve?
How come a donkey and democrats were always used as the example
He looks like Crowley
Does anyone else see the typo in the description?
Tell you what: If elected to the office of President, I will get out of bed, at least five times every week.
Why does he keep punching the eagle?
"Parties exist to win elections" thats not how it always was, in fact through most of US history the parties had pretty specific policy goals and ideologies. Not any more, now 'Democrat' and 'Republican' are just euphemisms we use to describe the political elite.
I think we should: 1: soften the government 2: harden the army and navy 3: cut taxs, debt, and oil prices 4: not worry about climate change 5: attack isis 6: make are own products 7: have kids learn 8: have more liberty 9: make America great
Can we just take out the media. All they do is like , cover up and force feed you , what you believe and make you hate who they hate.
+CrashCourse could you please have another video describing the differing opinions on the existence of parties, including how early Presidents such as George Washington were strongly against them?
dig the neon graphics thought bubble!
As a swiss, and maybe it's because of what I am used to, but having to choose between only two parties (democrats and republicans) seems undemocratic. What is your point of view ?
"In the same way that seeing, say, a Netflix logo let's you know that you are about to chill." This makes me think of Craig as the hip uncle that uses teenage slang, while misunderstanding the actual meaning.
that was the worst dramatic zoom-in ever... :)
Given the rise of trump I very much would prefer open primaries, especially as an independent.
I gotta admit I was too busy laughing to pay attention after the 'I dunno' part.
Can we talk about Syria, Isis and the rest of the Middle-East?
Any Rubio supporters?
5:52 Sneaky liberal bias. Negative characterization of republicans for "Less taxes" with the animated figure being a rich big business leaders with stacks of cash in their pockets. In reality its the opposite. The big banks, big business, insurance companies are all in the pacs that donate to the Dems, because "obamacare" practically forces them to buy insurance. Its big business and crony capitalism that keeps Dems alive. And yet almost all Democrats believe the opposite. Plus Business' don't absorb taxes like you think they will pass that on to the consumer. If they have breaks and incentives they give raises and are more likely to hire people and all at a real world living wage not McDonald's wages ! he Dems can try and paint the gop as "racist/ sexist/ greedy" and all the politically correct terms they have, but it won't work this time around. because people now know who supports big business, and it isn't the gop, big business could give a damn about low taxes, they'd handle any rate of taxation, big business including wall street are in bed with the dems. High taxes may not help the middle class but they certainly come in useful when big business wants to take out the emerging competition (aka small business), thus more mergers and acquisitions increasing market power of corporations at the expense of the public all on the dem's approval. Insurance companies make millions due to the obamacare premiums while the middle class struggles to pay them... given all that, why on earth would the big and the powerful be stupid enough want to put the Democratic party out of power.
After this show is done I want a supercut of all eagle punches.
Poor Wheezy is terrified of that popper.
Political parties are inevitable. There will always be large groups of people with similar political opinions who will work together to support their political beliefs.
Netflix and chill party 2016
Someone should cover Canadian political parties. Like, the new one, not the Steven Harper Era but the Justin Trudeau Era Political parties and government. And the Cabinet of Canada.
Serious question for Americans, do u believe that the US has real democracy?? Are there ways to improve your system??
Australian: I'm so confused, we just vote in an idiot, than rely on their party to over throw them.
If I was american, I would vote PSUSA
Let me simplify it for everyone who is still a little confused. Essentially, America has two big groups of bumbling idiots (red team and blue team) who like to sit around all day slinging feces at each other and never getting anything meaningful or useful done. They then try to blame each other for everything that ever goes wrong even though they look, sound, and act pretty much exactly the same.
I was independent for years but switched to dem because Maryland is closed primary and I wanted to vote in the dem primary last year for governor. I think open primary is much better
The senate needs to be changed to a proportional representation vote of political parties. Vote for the party you want and the percent of votes they get is how many seats they get in the senate
Suggestion : Exactly what is Republican and what is Democrat? Where do the names come from and what do they refer to? Eg, I am not an American, I presume the Republican refers to the Roman Republic, circa 50 BC, before Caesar and the Triumvirate basically destroyed it. And Democrat refers to the democratic system as pioneered by the Greeks about 400 years before that. But these are guesses...
Wow...I don't know much about politics but I'm shocked by the definition. I always thought political parties exist to carry out their ideals as much as possible within the realm of government...whether they win elections or not..
I strongly disagree with th definition of parties as political forces whose goal is to control the government. That's a very perverted definition because it implies that political parties don't and shouln't care for anything but winning elections. The true definition is "a political organization who seeks to influence the government by legal ways". And a political organization is "a group of people who share the same political doctrine". And legal ways includes controlling the government, but it also includes controlling other political mandates, like regional mandates and seats in the parliament. You should remember that your country has more than two parties. You should remember that the government doesn't control everything. You should also remember that the government is not the only political structure in any country. Regional and local scales also matter. Parliament minorities matter. ETC.
3:41 Tom Petty stole that guy's juicy fruit.
Heheh, netflix and chill
8:11 I see someone that's Berning.
Vote Bull Moose!!
8:49 I feel like that should have been in the outtakes.
A party does not always represent the candidates and on top of that it makes people more lazy when it comes to researching the candidates background by standardizing what they "represent" Plus in some cases, it can actually be used as a deception. As you said at 5:04, people can be sneaky, even the candidates.
Actually there are a lot of businesses that get benefits from the Democrats too. I can think of one right now. Solyndra ring a bell?
Any libertarians here?
I hate republicans with a passion. They stand for everything I hate. Racist and homophobic who stand by the claim global warming is a sham to strike down any attempt to reduce co2 emissions so that they can profit from the same people who are destroying our planet. I don't hate the people who follow them, I hate the fucking monsters they vote for
TRUMP 2016! SANDERS IS THE NEXT STALIN. HE IS BRAINWASHING YOU! NOTHING IS FOR FREE! I CANT UNLOCK MY CAPS HORSES ARE SECRET AGENTS FOR THE NRA
"But you're free to disagree, and if you do, go form your own party" Except that the first-past-the-post voting system that America currently has punishes third parties for existing (thanks to the spoiler effect), and makes it impossible for them to bring about any significant change.
You were way too scared of that last popper lol
Why do Americans have to register for specific groups. I mean why do you have to be a Democrat or a Republican? Wouldn't it be easier to just vote for whoever seems to have the best policies that year, be it a Republican or Democrat?
Top Choice for President: Bernie Sanders (D) Top Republican Choice: Rand Paul Third Party Choice: Jill Stein Write-In: Ron Paul
Political parties exist so simple minded people, the voters in idiocracies, can have a simple way to vote. Lazy sodding bastards.
Are you going to discuss how the First-Past-the-Post system will inherently lead to only 2 parties?
the pay isnt great?
I love these videos so much! They help me study for my class so well :D
Can you talk about the electoral system in the United States and the flaws of it?
There ain't no party like the Communist Party!
0:42 Wow, that's a cool shot. I'm somehow surprised I've never seen it before.
LOL Loved the Zoom shot
the American voting system is fucked up. That's why we're stuck with 2 parties that don't give a shit about the people
It was 17 candidates. 2:35
I don't like the part about making things easier for partisan voters. It's bad if you completely dismiss a candidate just because of their party. Heck, many Republicans agree with Democratic policies if you don't tell them which party they came from.
lol craig thinks only republicans are the party of business. Both in charge are business parties.
Rand Paul 2016! whoo!
Libertarian Socialism/Libertarian Communism FTW
Political parties should be banned
Parties, we need more of them :P We should make Green, Libertarian, & Socialist bigger because its people just to afraid to split votes. Federal yes we should have like 2-3 parties, state/city lets get like 5! Opinions are needed!
Eagle Punching Party Beacause in the words of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski: "I hate the f*cking Eagles, man!"
Thought bubble animation has gotten much better over the years. Just an observation.
works alot better in parliamentary system
Primaries are broken a very large portion of voters are moderates but can't ever find a moderate candidate
on the final episode will the egal punch you?
Green Party = Best Party
The problem with political parties is that the establishment becomes to powerful and no new ideas have a chance since the establishment is against that. That is why Bernie Sanders has to win, no more establishment, no more Clinton's.
If I had to pick a party, I'd join Modern Whigs
Now I can see why US presidential elections are so expensive. Overcomplicating democracy so much... jesus
Pennsylvania has closed primaries.  In 2008, before the election started, I registered Republican so I could cast my vote for Ron Paul, but by the time election day came in PA, John McCain already had enough votes to win the nomination, so my vote was useless.  However, Clinton and Obama were still virtually tied, and I definitely preferred Obama over Clinton, but because all registrations must be made a month in advance, I couldn't change my registration to Democrat to vote for Obama, and Hilary Clinton ended up winning in my district.  Because of the closed primary system, I couldn't vote for the candidate I most wanted, and I also couldn't vote against the candidate I least wanted.
The fact so little people vote speaks to something very great. I am not sure why people just dismiss it as " people are lazy, people don't want to try, etc. "
CGP Gray did a great youtube series on why we have only 2 parties and what would have been better options than the first past the post voting (hint, alternate voting would have allowed for more than 2 parties to be viable.)
Vote for deez nutz
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to...
Carlin/Hicks '16!!
7:50 - "...he or she always comes from the majority party...." While correct historically, this statement actually approaches being fractally incorrect legally. Being wrong on so many levels in such a short phrase deserves recognition. Well done, sir. Well done, indeed.
we need more then two damn parties
So how were speakers chosen before the party system?
Ted Cruz master race
I'm a libertarian
Political Parties: The party of money. Not you.
Bernie Sanders will help me pay my $250000 loan I took to get a master's degree in African American Transexual studies , It is hard to pay it off with a Starbucks salary.
wow craig you lost allot of weight!
it is funny how people think that presidential elections are real. Hilary will win , and trump is just like a puppet to act up . your vote don't count
So what the heck did that poor eagle do to you anyway?
There another way to get into political office, without ever winning a single primary. The vice-presidential candidate doesn't have to win any primaries, but is simply picked by the presidential candidate. If this ends up being a poor selection, then all the other member of the party have no say in this.
I personally agree with most Republican ideas but I do look broadly at the Democrats ideas too. I consider myself a right sided independent.
Now I expect logical arguments children. ??????
is it illegal to run as a Republican but really be a Democrat?
Funny how every warning George Washington gave in his farewell address we've failed to heed, and have suffered bad consequences from, one of which is the formation of political parties.
What a ridiculously inefficient and antiquated system we have. I hope I live to see the day our social, economic, and political patterns catch up with our incredible science and technology. We could be living in a utopia if we got our s**t together and actually used our brains to deal with problems.
anyone else a republican or conservative ??
i feel stupid asking, but whats does democrat and republican mean???
If you have played too much mass effect, you start to think blue is good, and red is bad. In mass effect blue means Paragon, and red means Renegade. When you apply this to the color schemes of both parties in this video... yeah, this is what mass effect does to you.
I'm a Libertarian Socialist that is registered Green and voted primarily Democrat or Independent. I'm voting for Bernie Sanders in 2016. #feelthebern
SANDERS/WARREN 2016
National socialist party anyone?
gonna sound like a dumb question. but from the outside it looks like America has two parties and thats it. could someone explain for me please, that would be greatly appreciated
Seventh
Damn it, I came here for an actual party.
I'm not a democrat and not an american ... but republicans look like the bad guy
gu fkc t
First
First mother fucker may trump burn in fake hell.
...
And the ghost of Tesla Laughed and Laughed . ??????
Tesla?
Edisons only discovery was Nikola Tesla
Applause for pronouncing ø right Also, Tesla was crucial in making components for alternating current (which will be what I'll blame on if I fail at the exam) Also, without alternating current, only the very rich could have afforded electricity. This would have happened if Eddison won the war of currents
That was a very subtle use of the it's a trap meme. Well played crash course animator person
no Tesla? wth?
R u serious at all, where is NIKOLA TESLA
I know this format is short, but no Tesla is a glaring omission.
It was never stated in Frankenstein that electricity was involved in the "monster's" creation. That comes from movie adaptations.
Cmon guys, you're usually much better at research. This entire video could be titled: "Myths we believe are real"
Oh, btw. Edison didn't invent the light bulb. He "perfected" it.... and by perfected i mean he invented a version that would eventually blow, creating a need to continue buying them. (He saw potential for profit in light bulbs, but didn't like fact people would only need to buy them once every 10-15 years or so). Humphrey Davy and Joseph Swan were the real inventors of the light bulb, and yes, their version could easily last 10+ years. In fact, they were developing bulbs that would Never blow before Edison stole their research, and developed a much lower quality bulb. (They were actually 2 of the countless people who won lawsuits against Edison). This video has quite a few errors.... and btw yes, Edison was not an inventor. He was a ruthless businessman who was exceptionally good at stealing research (and credit).
Everyone is losing it because they didn't mention Tesla.. And here I am annoyed that yet again Hauksbee and Ben Franklin are brought up, yet no mention of William Gilbert or Thomas Browne. A guy gets famous for one experiment and suddenly no one knows who discovered (and named) electricity. (Gilbert n Browne coined it in early 1600's) Edit: Also, just pointing out, we don't actually know if the kite experiment ever happened, or if it did, we have no idea at all id Franklin did the experiment himself. He certainly never claimed that he did. He only briefly mentioned it in a very brief statement to the Pennsylvania Gazette, saying, and i quote: "the iron rod experiment had been achieved in Philadelphia, but in a different and more easy Manner". He never specified who did the experiment, only that it had been done. He also never said it was the kite. In fact, it was about 2 decades later when Joseph Priestly wrote about it, that it was claimed Franklin did the experiment using a kite. Problem is he never witnessed it himself, and many scientists have pointed out if Franklin HAD done the experiment in the way Joseph described, it would have killed him. Aaaaaand, on top of it all, Benjamin Franklin was nowhere near the first person to do that type of experiment. In fact, that experiment had been done so much in the previous years (with a variety of objects including metal rods), that virtually no one even took notice when Franklin made his claim. He did write up the concept that electricity n lightning are the same... but as for the kite experiment, all we have as evidence is the word of someone who was not there, writing about it 2 decades after the fact, by simply giving his interpretation on what Benjamin Franklin would likely have done.

This was an electrifying episode! It's Greased Lightning!
All inventions seem to be named after somebody
How can you have a "Crash Course History" on electricity without any mention of Tesla?
Crazy futurists deserve their recognition just like the ruthless capitalists. Those that drive tech and understand this world will bring it to it's knees and Tesla will be avenged ROFL. Resistance is futile. I mean RIF!
You did not take even the name of tesla??????
I see I'm super late to the party. What SI unit is the edison again? I think I must have missed that. The tesla, for those playing at home, is the SI unit of magnetic field strength. "They say in physics the greatest honor is when your name starts to be spelled with a lower-case letter."
Franklin is the guy who came up with the positive and negative nomenclature for talking about electrical charge, causing generations of electrical engineers to curse his name. Because of Franklin electricity flows from the negative side to the positive side over a voltage potential.
Edison was the Donald Trump of inventors. I mean that in a derogatory way, America.
Edison was a murderer
does youtube shadowban?
Nicely Done Team Crash Course !
No Tesla, No mention of Maxwell's laws. No mention of the Faraday cage. This should have been two more episodes.
Please add the Arabic language translation
Hello john Green, Russians love you. But the trouble happened, we need you to give your consent to translate your content and voice acting into Russian. Please respond ?????? ???????. From Russia with love.
I was hoping they would mention Oliver Heaviside. His contributions to the Electrical Sciences are extremely important and I think he deserves way more recognition.
Didn't ancient scientists create some fluid batteries as well?
James Clerk Maxwell was a great mathematical genius. He should have had his own episode!!!
General Electric advertisement .????????
Was hoping for a mention of Joseph Henry, he invented insulated wire, practical electromagnets, electrical communication at a distance, discovered inductance, and has an SI unit in his name.
You actually pronounced an Ø somewhat correctly! You may have offended the Tesla crowd, but Scandinavia is proud of you!
You forgot to mention Nikola Tesla and Lewis Latimer !
I think TRUMP edited this video...
Oh, we're referring to AC as "Westinghouse's" now, instead of Tesla's? GOT IT.
Haha make a “cloud baby” ???? lol love you guys videos!
Hey guess what everyone? Donald Trump's Uncle John G Trump was the scientist the US government appointed to review Nikola Tesla's papers at the time of his death. coincidence? I think not.
Shameful no mention of Nikola Tesla you people are total complete sell-out frauds! Tesla's ideas will Triumph no matter how much you try to ignore him. ????
so if I make I light bulb light up with a lemon does that mean I'm gay- I mean a battery?
This guy kills us with information, yet so easy to comprehend
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the impact of Nikola Tesla. The importance is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the work will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Tesla's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this science, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who ignore Nikola Tesla truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the tragedy in Teslas invention "The AC current," which itself is a cryptic reference to the work of Prior Greek Natural Philosophers. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Teslas genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ?? And yes, by the way, i DO have a Nikola Tesla tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ??
Its like you wanted to avoid the name behind AC and then comments exploded, i dont know why his name is so hard for this channel to say
Westinghouse but No Tesla?
Tesla? how no mention about him?,,,
Who exactly is Orsted, & what is his history???????
Benjamin Franklin but no Tesla??? Why???????
5:10 you show the wires repel when the current flows opposite directions but you have the magnetic field going in the same direction. One of those wires should be showing the magnetic field going clockwise. Both wires are showing counterclockwise. Use the right-hand rule your thumb shows the direction of the current and your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field.
Are you going to have an episode on psychology?
Grrrrr - it was Tesla's AC, not Westinghouse's. Westinghouse bought Tesla's patents and funded the first large scale AC generation at Niagra Falls. The current wars were between Tesla and Edison.
Obvious omission to get people commenting.
Alright everyone take a chill pill, they said they'd talk about Tesla in an upcoming episode. You know these guys and their love for knowledge, you think they'd casually forget about such an important figure?
Frankenstein got an honorable mention and no Tesla in an electricity historical.... That's just wrong and frankly rude too....
Crash Course: I'm the best source of information because I'm one of the most popular YouTube channels. YouTube: Nope, I am because your little "channels" are nothing without me. Internet: That's ironic because I was thinking the same thing about the both of you. Computer: All three of you guys shut up. You guys would just be an idea if it wasn't for me. Electricity: Keep talking, bitches!
Good guy JP Morgan, we should be thankful to bankers... and Russians can't possibly have contributed to humanity, Tesla who?
two magnets repelling each other inside a coil of copper wire might work? i don’t that Michael Faraday tried it... ?????????
Are you going to mention that Tessa may be a vampire
i want a photovoltaic hauksbee generator ??
Where is Tesla
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
I'm sure scientists those days started a bit of a resistance after Ohm published his piece, though they immediatly saw the potential use of Volta's work.
Die herrschende Geschichte ist die Geschichte der Herrschenden.
Thomas Edison: The Corporate Scientist
Hank: "Edison promoted capital punishment using an electric chair." Me: "....Wait. What?" Hank: "Next time we'll follow Edison during the second industrial revolution." Me: "No wait-" Hank: "Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio-" Me: "Hang on go back. What did you say about the electric chair??"
Suck my balls!!!
I wonder if we'll have a third industrial revolution, this time in space. Or have we already had the third one and are we waiting on the fourth?
Westinghouse < Tesla. Pretty bummed, crash course.
What of Nikola Tesla??
I'm sure Tesla will be a part of an episode with other pioneers of telecommunications like Marconi and Bell. In the meantime, don't get so riled up that you forget that Faraday and Maxwell are possibly the two greatest scientists of all time.
We need a science about blood pressure an cholesterol is it really bad for you or is it a good thing what if hen you have high then its healing your beter when you use medicine maybe it's stopping with healing
Can you make an episode on the history of wireless electric communication? Starting from the Telegraph or may be before to the latest satellite/submarine cable communication? And the physicists behind it? Thanks.
Frankenstein is not a doctor.
So no Tesla yet?
INCREDIBLE ABHISHEK
I know edison as an old fool that electrocuted animals
Couldn’t even manage to acknowledge Nikolo Tesla?
These are the greatest videos on YouTube. ??
So is there going to be an episode on Hamilton Euler and Gauss about the advances in mathematics during the 16th century?
Thomas Edison is history’s great hack. So many of ‘his’ greatest inventions were not his. The man was a complete arsehole and should never have been celebrated.
Leyden jar, i.e. the capacitor?Pieter van Musschenbroek?
I love electricity, it represents light and information and it can't be weponized. Electricity is my friend. I have electric bike and it helps me to become an electric flow, both physically and mentally in the lovely streets of Amsterdam. Seriously guys, it's surreal, unreal, so grateful.
But muh laws of electrolysis!!1! - Faraday, probably
The topic of electricity and no mention of Tesla? Wut? Just Westinghouse?!
Why has nobody commented on the fact that they didn't mention Tesla?
You know Edison didn't invent the light bulb?
You sir are supporting quackademia by not mentioning Nick Tesla and the total lack of ethics of Edison
11:40 Didn't we already cover thermodynamics?
Can't wait for the new Volta and Ampere cards, ...oh wait, wrong video.
Edison was a kind of Steve Jobs. Incapable of inventing anything on their own, but amazing at popularising ideas.
Not one mention... At all... Of Nikola Tesla.... Seems incomplete.
Everyone, crash course said they're going to talk about Nikola Tesla in a future episode, so take it easy, please:). Dear crash course, I watch your channel almost every day and Nikola Tesla is my biggest hero, so imagine how sad I was to find that he wasn't given a mention in this video, but it's okay, as long as you do dedicate some screen time for him because more people need to know about Tesla and he truly is important to the history of science, no doubt about that. I hope you keep your word, crash course. Other than that, great video, fabolus animations, as per usual. Keep up the good work. Thanks! :D
Westinghouses AC? Hahah tell your script writter to do a better research, maybe you will sound smarter next time. Tesla would be spinning in his grave if he heard you talking.
Is a simple geek. Hears Magneto, checks comments for X-men jokes.
Petting the cat....*is a trap*!
10:00 strange line for todays basis, cause it's now a basic need.
This is why I love this channel! Amazing facts.
Will there be a second episode on thermodynamics or is it a mistake? 11:50
So Volta created the first Batter? What about the Bagdad Battery?
Boy, Im really Amp-ed by this episode.
0.75× ??
Wasnt ørestred trying to prove that there was no relation between magnetism and electricity?
This guy looks like “John Green” on budget... ????
I really appreciate how well all of the developments in electromagnetism were covered in a few minutes, without leaving any of the scientists involved. Next week's episode is displayed as "Thermodynamics", and not The Second Industrial Revolution. I kindly request you to edit it in the description. This is an absolutely remarkable video series and that's why I want it to stay awesome!
Did Galvani ever get a lower case letter, or did he just get galvanization named for him? Thomas Edison was a criminal thug.
Okay I have a small nit to pick: it says Next Episode: Thermodynamics at the end, but you already covered that last episode.
I've noticed that a lot of these YouTube educational channels do not mention Nikola Tesla as much as they should, when they even mention him at all... What's going on?
No mention of Tesla?
I was going to mention Tes.... looks at comments Oh, nevermind.
AC/DC
Westinghouse ac? Ha. Wow.
capitalist funded video only glorifies capitalist inventors.
"This Episode is Powered by General Electric"
Wee need a whole video on Tesla now
Tesla? Nicholas Tesla??
I just learned about electricity in Engineering class
before calling it "electricity" what did they call the phenomenon these people were studying?
Crash Course Linguistics
Very grateful for this series, thank you for the knowledge.
CrashCourse, Do a serie about history of medicine, surgery, antybiotics or something about
Umm why didn't they talk about Nicola Tesla?
Tesla. Just say it. TESLA. I was sure he would say it. Edison didn't have much to do with the electric grid because there was no way to efficiently convert high voltage DC to low voltage DC so there was no way to transport DC power through a grid. You were doing so well until the end.
Feels like Mr. Tesla will have his own special video. How accurate is this prediction?
At 5:09, the magnetic field lines around the current should be reversed when the current is reversed.
Wasn't the kite key at the bottom with a leden (sp?) Jar?
Because Tesla is overrated and was no physicist. Coulomb ampere faraday and maxwell we’re responsible for em and I think we should have called the unit of magnetic flux density after faraday as he came up with the idea of flux
I was wait for Tesla.
hello!
Come on Hank, I want to hear about Maxwell's silver hammer.
I am still wondering about the Leibniz ... You got Amper and Ohm pronunciations correctly.
I thought batteries were found as far back as ancient Egypt
Couple Problems Kids.... #1 ) There is Archeological Evidence of of" Ancient Metal Galvanizing" (look it up) in china, the Middle East and South America that shows that ancient peoples had at the very least a practical knowledge of electricity hundreds of years prior to Europeans.# 2)The First Battery that is known to be made is the "Iraq Battery" (look it up) it was invented centuries earlier in what is called Iraq in the Middle east (by at least 500 years). #3) Thomas Edison took credit and and had patents applied for in his name for various inventions he did not actually invent (many of these were actually invented by a fellow named Tesla who worked for him at Menlo Park among others [I strongly encourage you to look Tesla up and interestingly how a technology that would have made electricity less profitable for people like J.P. Morgan was scuttled and those that wanted to Monetize electricity) #4) Tungston was the first commercially viable material incandescent lighting elements, not carbon and being commercially viable was EVERYTHING Edison was about).
Edison the psykopat.
How would a DC grid system even work? Without induction (inherent to AC) you can't transform voltage up high enough (dropping current low enough) to transmit over long distances without losing a lot of power to heat from the resistance of the transmission cables themselves.
Hank needs a plaid t-shirt to complete this ensemble.
weird coincidence: a prisoner was westinghoused with electricity in tennessee today (the first time in a long while)
Tesla is overrated . Change my mind
Therefore making Thomas Edison the Senator Palpatine of his day,,, as the Death Star is nothing more than a huge power plant, and energy delivery system which would allow for dramatic population growth within the galactic infrastructure. (Sure we all like to fancy that in such a future, a bit of electricity should be nothing to build a death star about,, but as with all growth, infrastructure projects also continue to get bigher, requiring more and more energy at once.)
guys they're gonna cover Tesla in a future episode they replied to the comments :^) yall can chill now
Ion: Magnet's how the ****** do they work? Plato: Well...the Stone of Hereclea...
The number of puns in this episode is Yeah I'm going to say it Shocking.
Edison is a fraud.
slightly disappointed that the "current war" only got less than 1 minute... and I didn't even hear the name Tesla :(:(
This video was obviously funded by Edison
Tesla: they left me......(sad song playing)
Tesla?
Thank you ! Love from Morocco .
Tesla?
Post notifications are now on. The thermodynamics course will be ??.
Honestly how can you talk about Electricity for more then a minuets without talking about Nikola Tesla...
Mary Shelley's novel contains one paragraph mentioning electricity: "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration."
Dislike for not even mentioning Tesla. And thief Edison gets entire next episode just for himself.
Educational!
Edison ? Grid!!!!! Quite the opposite.
Sorry, but I see no excuse to call AC in this context the "Westinghouse AC". By this criteria you should call DC the "J.P. Morgan DC", yet you call it "Edison DC".
I'm only echoing everyone else but, no Telsa - really?
FIRST 40 COMMENTS ~Rox
I want to be a famous scientist and have an unit with my name.
I'm pretty sure electricity wasn't involved in Mary Shelly's version of Frankenstein. The lightning wasn't a thing until the first movie in 1931.
"Ben Franklin...no real epistemic knowledge" !?!?! [citation needed] Ben Franklin DISCOVERED positive and negative charges of electricity. A feat that would have earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics...if such a thing existed back then. Please redo/edit that slight to Mr. Franklin!
It's okay a "history of science" not having Tesla... it's not ok actually the fact that Hertz was forgotten
Is this guy related to it’s okay to be smart guy. He looks just like him
where can i get those beautiful gear bookends?
Ok I'm not religiously offended like some in these comments but it is very odd you didn't mention Tesla, considering you talk about Westinghouse and he invented AC ... Regardless of whether you'll be covering him in future episodes, its a huge oversight for this video as a unit.
Frankenstein had nothing to do with electricity. The method for giving life was never described in the book, the shocking was added in the movie.
Why no John Green?
And no mention of the greatest. Tesla.
Careful there, you're triggering Tesla's fanboys
Where’s mr Telsa on this story?!?!
How could you talk about electricity and not mentioning Tesla?!!
A history of electricity and not talking about Nikola Tesla hhhhhhhh yet talking about Edison... total joke
how could you not mention Tesla?
This is very obscure..... But your jacket reminds me of Chris Hadfield (astronaut) Both time I've met him, he had a very similar jacket on
Science ?? is the best subject in school.
Why no Tesla
Hank should’ve been a science major. He’d be an amazing student.
Tomorrow i w'll hve ELECTRICITY Examination, Thanks it helps Me alot??????
????
Came to show some love ??
I get soooo hyped everytime a new one of these comes out
thumbs up oi
Wishing all a beautiful week
Resist much, obey little.
Do a video on the life of Patrick Buchanan
first
Yeah, new video!
Yes but this damm is MADE IN CHINA
Good information, but don't blame China
Wait. 6.5 inches a year, and China added .8 to that.
2:58 f u China
2:34 gtrampers will cringe hard
Dam son. THATS A LOTTA DAMS
I thought the earthquake in Chile caused it
What a fucking stupid idiots
There's dam goats all over the dam place! Percy Jackson fans, hello?
Why do you think that moment of inertia is crazy!
You thinking is similar to the flat earther.
In 47,650 CE, one premature ejaculator will thank china for giving him one more second to satisfy his significant other
Who cares?
That was a Dam nice transition to the Brilliant AD
Eat your heart out USA! Not Yankee Doodle Dandy but YANGTZE DOODLE DAM-dest!
Was that a fact or a commercial!? ??
China ruining the planet and itself
Any irony for building a WALL....?
How can a dam slow down the earth if there was the same exact amount of resources as when the Earth was first made
Lol the made a dam for the pig who will get drown Pig=xin jin ping
Um , Is that a GOD DAM?
false.. earth don't rotate... if the earth moving rotate how the aeroplane want to landing if the earth moving faster than aeroplane
I have beat you. “damn that donkey has a damn gorges ass”
Warhammer 40k reference... Noice
If something happens to our beautiful world tha god spent 7 days making.. blame China
One shitty contry which knows only hacking even mother nature
What they didn't explain is how it affected the earth's orbit. In the next 7.5 billion years we'll probably come into contact with a large planetary body because of that shift in orbit. But who cares. No one will exist. YouTube won't exist. It probably already doesn't exist
God dammit
So nothing?
If global warming keep going at current rate the same will cause a more fucking damage than this meaningless earth rotation slowdown.
Bro why u rapping?
Stop nonsense, don't fool people..
Take this Earthe Flaters
Silly, what about the rising sea level then...
China is Launching Artificial MOON which will Effect Earth
Lol New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
China builds a bunch of bullshit building's and dams crowding the earth with bunch of crappy Shit...what a waste of time ...and Money...China really Sucks balls...
oh cmon its only 1 second, that not much ???????? we need moree
Thats why we have an extra leap year, God made it perfect and the flood messed it up.
Drink .7 ltr of scotch.watch these video.then scrarch your head.
I said the same thing about America shipping mass amounts of marble,slate,and other heavy shit to America plus the weight of the homes added to one land mass has to have an effect on the rotation of Earth though small it still has to effect the rotation
Yes..the Chinese dictator must dissarm
more ???
who dislikes this? *CHINESE PEOPLE*
Earth doesn't rotate but the universe does Thought i has been proved ??
Stupid asshole
That's why WE DONT NEED any chineae live on this world!
Burn china ...a cruel nation..cruel for earth.... China is power hungry and Don't care about anything else except its own.
But why??
Wt abt skyscrapers? It will extend the mass away from centre, will it not reduce moment of inertia of earth same as the way this dam is doing?
But how much do the skyscrapers slow our earths rotation down? Isn't that an important thing?
Sleep 0.60 nanoseconds longer Made in China
Birthday.. (previous) 5 4 3 2 1 HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! Present Fiveeeeee Foooouuuuurrrrrrrr Threeeeeeeeee Twwwwwooooooo Onnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaapppppyyyy BIIIIRRTTHHHDAAAAYYYY
then ocean doesnt affecting world rotation ?
Has it changed the value of our gravity. Anyway a big salute to china's Dam.
Omg this actually works! 1. Hold your breath for thirty minutes 2. Die
Chinese and muslims , problem of planet
Kya faltu video h poora chodu bana rha h
Stupid ...Dom or no dam water always on planet earth only.. what about big ocean ...does water flow to Mars without dam...damm dammm
TF CHINA THANKS A LOT FOR MAKING THE EARTH MOVE 0000.6 SECONDS SLOWER UGH LETS BLAME CHINA
So you're saying I could have gone home from school earlier
You are fking retards
Tnk china bcoz they slowed down aging Longer sleep, Longer chrismas eve, halloween, And Longer s8x night Pls make another dam
a earthquake let the earth rotate even slower so,,, what a bullshit video. it's true, but it don't makes a big problem. Not even a small problem. Just a problem that makes 1 day now 0,00000006 seconds longer.. :-|
Transitions so smooth
what a fucking nerd
just me or hes actually rapping
It's amazing the craps CIA propaganda comes up with these days. Lmfao
that doesn't make a difference ??
??? ?????????????????????????
Then how about Pacific Ocean weight it will stop the earth...
Daang so sck of fcking americunts complaining each and every thing about china they are so jealous of it since china is ahead of them on both development and economy
that’s trippy so, in theory, me raising my arm to the sky is slowing down the rotation of earth? obviously, it’s such a small amount it may never even be measurable, but it’s neat
Man I really want to speed up Time but at the same time I won’t have enough time to play Fortnite
Really?
If they were building new clear power stations, they would have problem with radioactive waste. With coal thermoelectric plants they would have Carbon dioxide emissions. There is no clean and cheap way to produce energy. The hydroelectric dams are the less harmful and profitable way to produce electricity.
Probably in the top 10 most useless videos I've watched in 2018.
I just knew China would find some way to screw us all.
No wonder it felt so slow
I think you need to check your math , and it's all HRC's fault ......she is why everything and anything sucks ,is wrong, or doesn't work correctly
Is there a difference between magnetic north and rotational north, and if so, how big is it?
Fuck China
Imagine what other planetary objects can do even at great distances. The ancients were smart enough to know...
That dam is insignificant to have slowed down the earth’s rotation but that’s my opinion
So china is change the world ,go china go
Climate Change... City Growing are another reason...cause the Urban Concentration (and weigh) is increasing... Pollution is just one small reason....the Axis Move is the greatest reason but,,,,nobody talks about it...cause it's not economically convenient...
How can it slow down a flat earth
It is a demonstration with a major FLAW. Your theory of "object moving in a circular motion circulates slowly when its size expands and circulates in a faster way when size is compressed" is only applicable on earths surface where elements of friction such as air or air pressure, gravity etc are present. But this theory is not applicable in space where the earth is moving in a circular motion as there is almost no elements for friction around the earth.. So the the speed of the EARTHS ROTATION WILL BE REMAIN THE SAME.
Next video "How US is the reason ISIS existed"
Damn this is hilarious ?? I love the bs they are spewing.
Very interesting video.
NEW ZICELOSTA RAHAMANDA ???? HAHAHAHAHAHHAA
Gog n magog
This is not logic!
Also make a video abouy how america is killing the earth .
They just dont give a dam.
Talk about dam. I live along the Columbia river where we have the 6th biggest dam, plus I live within a 160 km radius of 6 dams along the same river. Gotta love cheap electricity
Whatever there is on earth has not came from mars. So how could a dam construction could affect the rotation of earth? Btw i havent watched the entire video
China is fucking up everything on earth.
really?
It didn’t slow down they just took resources FROM the earth and just purified the materials
What would be the effect of a space elevator?
How a massive Hoe broke my heart
I cringed very hard with that sponsor transition
I just got an erection. How much did it affect earth's rotation speed?
How Trump does destroys our planet ?
ksom china
fuck the chinese!!!!!!!!!
But all the other dams in the world...?
Things come against the nature eventually will suffer big consequence
DAM you china I am sorry I’ll go die on a corner
Stop sending us dust china
This channel should be called half as smart.
oh no i have to study 0.00000006 sec... This is so sad Mom This is so long pls
Taiwan is part of China.
I wonder if any important events were impacted by this 60 ns delay. A game winning 3pointer didn’t count because it was 60 ns late. A car accident occurred because someone’s alarm clock was 60 ns late in the morning.
Fuck you that's just dumb
lmao my fcking ass of I call this Bull shit lmao good one good joke the funny part is that there is ppl who believe this sht
China is destroying Earth
By the year 47 650 CE a whole second will be added on to the day but everyone alive today will be dead in about 130 years or so
I just wanna be alive when a day is 1 second longer so that i can sleep for that extra second ????
China will soon start testing nuclear bombs on others land. It is the fiercest imperialist in the garb of communists
This is most absurd thing i ever heard that u can slow earth spin with dam.
*slows
so i wasted close to 5 minutes to learn china will delay earths spin by 1 sec in 40000 years... simply wtf:@
China is rich so they do everything they wanted until one day they’ll get themselves into troubles
Bomb that country
Uhh... Do all the "made in china" things cause trouble to the world?
That's why I wake up very late....... ??????
YYYEEEETE
Hope you realize the magnetic poles have shifted north pole is in Canada and south pole has left Antarctica already...do s video on that because that's fact.
Fuck you China
So its China fault that the earth is slowing down
Brilliant!
i m here to see how this insane China bashing can be pulled off…
What effect does slow rotation have on speed of time?
China number two
Somebody stop them
Damn.
Fook this mate
The earth is flat!!!!
I guess China doesn’t give a dam
You got me at New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Hahahaha...
If they want to slow down the earth they should move all MacDonalds and KFCs to Texas, the shear weight of Americans relocating to the south is strong enough to stop earth. #Fatasses
China number 1
Everything blame China, same with Trump, western Media
Genius at work
Wonder what kinda effect a space elevator is gonna have??
BS
damn china
China has become just like their products
Dam communists
Bsdk dhire dhire bol jara
Trump's great wall will make it slower....
Blame China!!
any credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVjGE0bPOhY ???
fucking commies
Damn ...
The speaker speaks so fast i don't even understand what he's saying.
Extra seconds doesn't matters!
Lol
Human beings getting extra time to destroy them self’s (changing earth’s equation)
Lmfao
That’s why I’m angry at night
Click bait
Was that dam MADE IN CHINA ?
Hey China? Why don't you uhh Nuke up that dam right now eh? It's pretty damn hot in here and I would like snow. E H
When you want to complain about something, you can always count on China
China is the reason y i dont get time to do my homework!!! Oh w8 it made day longer ;-;
Relocating 1.2bn pple really???
China rules the world
God damn
Yeah Mr. Half as everything! Yeah science!
I thnk you are mad, the time delay is negligible.
oh dam
?????????
Damn blame china for wasting a nanosecond of our lifetime
Sorry but that's not how that works.
Dam
Clickbait
Dont worry my fart will speed up earth's rotation just point me in the right direction...
Damn big Dam!
more duration of day the more time to melt the glaciers
I love how you seamlessly advertise Brilliant.org at the end of the video. Subscribed!
Earth doesn't move! Use your senses!
Looks like we can do more than we though we were capable of...
Damn
Three Gorgeous Dam
Build a large enough dam and we'll literally fall into the sun
Irrelevant
SO MANY FOOL THINK WITH ASS
Very smooooth. From content to sponsor add. You still get my ????
Please tell me the name of the song in the background from 2min 18secs I have been searching it on epidemic for so long but could not find it anyway very good video thanks
When I hear ¥200,000,000,000 I'm like DAMN or DAM?? Bad puns??
They added 0.000000000000000000000001 second wao idiot.
Seriously wahhh
Anyone wanna sleep longer? Ask CHINA
Dam.
Made in China
More importantly they made the Yangtze dolphin go extinct because of that dam. One of two inland species of dolphin in the world is now gone forever because of the Chinese. What to expect huh?
??right!??
Damn this is a clickbait... next video: how a fart enlarged the ozone hole
4:13 even a fictional phone in a video, yet you need to put a notch on it. but why. that alone make days longer by 1 second.
I was late for because this dam in china. Have you got 4.55 minutes to see a youtube video explaining it? - my boss wasnt having it :|
Damn Chinese
0:22 the other kind of ccp in the lower right corner is on hell of a game development team. They made probably the best MMO of all time Eve online
So is the earth still considered flat ??..........
Who would win. Planetary physics or a load of commie bois?
DAMn
that dam is made in china
Why there is warchamer 40k logo 3:10
Sheep
Fucking Chinese....
Shut up
Damn. What A Dam!
heckin’ China my brethrin
WHO said You cant buy timer?
Ohh i was afraid i had put up on weight but nie i knows its becouse od chinese people
That segue was flawless... "My phone can throw of the earth????... wait it was a transition." Well played.
Ok, now I wanna know exactly wtf they are going to do about fixing it and putting it back the way it was before they started pissing around with my day? Cheeky buggers, making me wait longer for Red Dead Redemption 2...??
What is this bullshit! They should take this channel off yt
So my birthday time is a lie!!??
dont worry guys, it wont last long
china at it again
That ad transition was so smooth
Was there a need to go into China's politics to deliver the main message of this video?
It's an American telling this so this is a lie American say this to start a new war for new jobs for making weapons to sell to Saudi Arabia. We just need to delete them except for Elon Musk. Elon Musk for President of the world, and Vladimir Putin for emperor of the universe, and Kim Jung Un for Lord of the multiverse.
China is ruining the world
He went so smooth to the add
What a pointless waste of time and resources this video is lol
Half as creative.
DAMN
talking wayy too fast bro
God dam that’s a lot of damage
China, they want it biggest/number one
I wonder if Burj Khalifa did anything as such.
Not actually.... Coz Antarctica also loosing huse amount of weigh coz of global warming... It's affecting more than china's dames as comparison... I tnk it's a diplomatic way to represent China as a bad country...
And we should believe this bullshit???
Thats why I hate china
ALL THE DISLIKES ON THIS VIDEO WERE GIVEN BY THE CHINESE ????????
Fuck off China
Now I have to wait longer for Christmas
Dam you future
So watching this video did nothing but waste my 295 secs
Dam it - China, probably
Aye go head china
Fucking china
*lightens the earth rotation, because the time moves fast and we dont notice it
Haha at last I had finish watching this joke.
Dam i was a whole 0.0000006 seconds late for work!!!
Got dam it China!
Little boy and fat man
Dammit... I got clickbaited.
Sunus balayee.. kar kaema kaara!!! ?Shabaash gobur!!
Hey talk a little bit slower ok? Are you late to take the flight?
What can I do with that 60 ns ...? More time spend with wife???
Wow!! Interesting channel.
Is this really true ? I am seeing this in YouTube that's why I am asking
Full time foolish..... You better take about flat earth .. intelligent..
Go metric man
No worries. Nature will balance it.
you western people are privileged in population and etc but countries like China and India are not so we build coz we need not for amusement like u people spend a fortune for old rusty vintage cars u have the liberty we don't and give a official statement of world science forum about your claim.
You should get Nobel prize , it was so interesting that I slept.
Fuck china
damn.
another reason why china is bad for the earth
But the earth is flat
!!! IMPORTANT !!! My fart just enlarged an ozone hole in pur atmosphere. If you want to know more, carry on watching this bulshit! If you believe in this you surely must believe in Smurfs right?
It's unappropriate nd worthless
Sience let me guese its about 000000000003% something you cant feel see or notes or even mesure! Only people with money allooooot of money. Trust me they say its there so it is... ugh...
Shit i am gonna age fast??
youtube should have a drug testing before making a channel??????
So we can made a very big dam and stop this fucking ball of rotation
Baby your time is up
That 0.0000006 sec feels a hour in boring classes. China you are ruining my life
Damn dam where did u get these
THANK YOU CHINA NOW I HAVE LONGER SCHOOL CLASSES????
I think US Hoover dam will compensate some problems created by this dam.
Impossible...
Yo mom so dam big she slowed the earth's rotation as long as you played in sports.
Wasted 5 minutes of my time to find out that i have to work 0.000000006 seconds longer everyday
DamN
Thanks by the WAY China!
Damn fucking china they must die
It should be Russia.
1.2K dislikes are from the flattards that believed this was a myth.
I looked up three gorges dam on google maps and I saw a truck on water!
so that's why last year's winter was so long and why summer was a little bit longer this year.
Thanks China for giving me extra time to catch all my deadline at work.
What a shit !!!! Shut up u clickbait..
Are you in hurry to go to pee?!! Why you speak so fast?
Daammm daniel
Blame China on everything Jk
When i heard the year's number.. I was like.. F.. k you. I'm outta here.. I thought it's something more significant.. It's just ridiculous.. smh
Why to watch a 4:55 seconds videos just for 60 nano seconds?
Kamal Raja
That is daaaamn high
didn't noticed that without this video... let's live like nothing happend ??
Yo mama is so fat, when she woke up from her sleep, the earth's rotation is slowed down
Thats why i love Thanos.
What's the music name ?
Fucking video
Hmm! Should I care?
Use mind.
No wonder school feels like forever
Yesterday i peed facing east , i would have also slowed the earth
Whenever I go to China my eyes automatically tunes in to 16:9
and china your damn mama's are so fucking big that slow earth and please close the dam or U.S gonna FUCKIN DESTROY DA DAMN DAM FOOOOOOL
hey china all country blame you because gorgeous and use ENGLISH MOTHAFUCKA
that new country tho, new zicelosta rahamanda
1m43s So not Northern Ireland?
That is BS...nothing on the earth can't impact the earth. .not even all of earth explosion combined with 5000 tsar bomb
Next thing we know Flash comes and not only does he fuck up the timeline but he also speeds up the rotation by 8 hours
Your intros sound a lot like RealLifeLores videos. ??
???????????? Seriously?? Im sure this guy voted trump..
Actually the theory you are using is depending upon the Earth climate in outside the space this theory does not work
God dam mit china
Dam... No wonder school feels longer than usual.
Breaking news: China causes global warming
after global warming now china?.... how about build wall in mexico border ?,its slow down too?,...
I don't think so, everything we made is coming from earth we are only converting it to other shape
What the fuck is next? How China caused fucking Hawaii to erupt? How fucking irrational! ??
My ears aren't fast enough for this video
You started in China and ended in USA, brilliant.
I just wasted 4:54 of my life
I’m sorry the year 45000? Earth will be gone by then
Thanks china, now my day is 0.00000006 seconds longer ????????
hahahahahahha
I like how no one is taking this seriously. Keep it up China, I can sleep 2min more.
Dam it China Do you get what I did there Me- Please kill me
God dam China for building this dam making school time more dam longer
A full 60 nanoseconds?!? Damn your dam China
There is a Chinese meme:+1s
If only earth spun...
Lol who types Hai
0:14 dam son
What the hell... Everything that changes it's altitude affects earth rotation.... Why blame dam??
That’s a Bull shit dumbass... it really doesn’t matter wether they build or they don’t. Even if they don’t store water it’s gonna go mix in oceans..so it’s gonna be same water weight
India wale like thoko
Now I can sleep for longer thanks to China
Lol blablabla...
Damn china
Dam video
Oh fuck off
Where did u learn your science , who is your teacher , is there any hospital for mentally challenged people near your home ? Plz join there as soon as possible
im so pissed, how dare they make my miserable days longer!
They do not forget new Zealand yea
So, that's why I thought the day was a little longer.
A ridiculous video hahahahah
Is this the reason I feel like seasons are coming a little earlier than usual
???
Damn.
The better iconic duo is shark boy and lava girl
And indians think they are at par with china.... monkeys know ur place alright.....
Dam!
I HATE THE RED MENACE??????
X doubt 60 nanoseconds thats actually quite a lot when you compare earths size with the dam, This has to be fact checked, theres many "science" channels like these on the internet that spew out shit just for views, one channel said how if u detonated a TSAR bomb in the Marianas trench you could split the would in half, fucking idiots.
I don't believe it
I try to accept your differences China. But for God's sake
world need to attack china and distroy it because although this speed reduction in not big deal . But, with the speed they are forcefully diverting waters from tibetian platues is real cause of concern . It is affecting global temprature by changing glacier size. Risking humanity at large scale with these man made blockages. In addtion, they have started large scale minning in these areas near junction of two gaint techtonic plates like eurasia and Indian plate.
Wow this is next level anti china propaganda
How is it making the earth heavier by using resources already used on earth
Damn China ???? dam
Dam u china!
1:43 that’s not Iceland...
Dislike for that ad oh god
well oh dam
2:53 what about the law of conservation of mass?
the earth is flat
Lag
I=MR^2 even if the dam was not constructed , the mass would remain the same. the only fact that acculumated water changed was the centre of gravity of that particular volume and not that of the earth.
Okay, China has to stop this. This is a massive change to human population... WE HAVE TO END THIS!!! THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL!! LAUNCH THE GODDAMN NUKES TRUMP!! WE HAVE TO STOP THIS, ITS RUINING HUMANITY, WE HAVE TO STOP CHINA FAAST!!!
Fuck you moron
Every time a baby is born, it slows the earth by 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of an atom
Wtf!
How you make these videos please tell
Yeah sure let’s start laying blames on each other. America builds no damn and it’s all China’s fault.
A lot of talk.. but can you prove anything you said.
China #1
infographic? is that you?
Pure bullshit no way that dam can slow down the rotation of the earth.
1 sec longer isn't an issue. I've just wasted 10 seconds writing this comment.
Next vid. How China fucked up the atmosphere
I can't think of a good comment
wth but u are taking the resources from earth and building it on earth dafuq
When the water was ice back in the glaciers , it was even farther than the axis of rotation since it was on the mountains which are significantly farther than the ground so how can it slow the velocity , neither a chunk of mass from earth s core has come to surface nor a new asteroid has hit the earth making its periphery heavier than beforw
clickbait
anyone watching this while high?
So literally, they did change the world!
Any big earthquake has much more effect on earth balance and rotation. As been told in the video that dam is really microscopic in size compared to the planet it sits on.
This is yankee propoganda against the peoples republic
Building dam is irrelevant to earth rotation
I have always had a thought: could the sky scrapers and roads we build effect the mass of the earth and change the earths center of gravity?
Yeah it's like when you on the spinny thing at school when you lean out it goes slower but when you lean out in you go fucking speedy fast.
@1:58 why the colour of main river is pink and blue of other river
Mexicans and Indians farting after eating spicy food will eventually make this world uninhabitable.
WHAT THE HELL CHINA YOU SUCK NOW OUR DAY LASTS 60 NANOSECONDS LONGER
fuck you motherfucking cunt
Because it made in China
Useless video
Wow. What a segue to an ad
I stopped walking so will it slow Earth? Well that doesn't make sense so did this DAMN.
I was watching his vedio @ 0.75x and you
It's to control the yang tze flooding.
fucking shit video....
What's proof of info????!
If it is true, then Great wall of china, Burz khalifa , Eiffel Tower & all Buildings on the Earth have how much affect?
dams water cooling earth
How United States freedom of bombing other nations and the impacts of the bombing affect the rotation and course of earth? Pls make that video ya.
I wish every Chinese to die.
We should eliminate china from humanity
I think i got a bit dizzy on that spinning thing
i was not wrong, chinese people are shits
So this is why when you run for your workout, you should always run from east to west, if not, you are fking slowing down the earth rotation. The punishment for not running in the “correct” direction is...drum roll...death (or making a YouTube video admitting you slow down earth rotation).
You spend some much of your time to make a video of 60 Nano seconds??? Great
0.00000006 seconds just slow down the rotation of the earth ?? Thats dam* nothing
Thanks to China I'm never late for class
Donald Trump was right about China. Damn dam makes my college lectures last longer
China all the time, made in China, China china China haha blame them for everything
Oh. Seriously?? I can suggest a new topic " how idiot publisher slow down the earth rotation
Song at 0:01 ??
Song at the start?
China should be nuked
Does anyone really believe this bullshit?
r u kiding with me?
Same goes for cheapest version of china called India ????
Damn China thuglife
New zicelosta rahamanda ??
Really can a dam slow down earth rotation really
This much amount of water storage may cause massive earthquakes
Thank you China I love sleeping 60 nanosec longer
You cant slowe what ain't moving! 6000IQ
Damn
Plz nuke china
china is chicken country just look wisely at their shape of country
Is earth adjust it self
Operation : Anchorage
This video is wastage of time
America: China, you owe this world zero point gazillion zero seconds. POTUS: It's time my fellow Americans we shall free Chinese people from communism and bring them justice and free markets.
We need so much more big dams, they slow down time. that gives us much more time to look for a girlfriend. Thanks
I call bullshit
irrelevant ads inside video
FATASS AMURICANS SLOWING DOWN THE EARTH ROTATION
Damn China.
That waters gross asf
How does one slow the rotation of an object that doesn't move? You fool the sheeple into believing that it did. - The Earth is Flat!
Dam'n' China ????
Fk you.you make me stay awake for 0.00006 second
Earth is stationary.
Do u Know? The dam in China is bigger than earth...!
OMG 6 nanoseconds are really long BLAME CHINA! jk don’t Plz
Interesting, I wonder does the melting of glaciers in alpine areas have the opposite effect?
OH C'MON SRSLY CHINA??? NOW I DIDN'T GET TO HAVE THAT ONE MICROSECOND!!! YOU OWE ME THAT!!!
China is the only country that can breed faster than cockroaches
God damn it China, I'll be 60 nanoseconds late to school.
I Hate China!
Damn you.... Y0u C0py N1nj4s
Blah blah blah...everything is ok!!!
This is a fucking content!!!
Dam you china for making school 0.00000006 seconds longer. Dam you!!!!
clap clap clap Good job China. good job.
I'm Chinese myself but I hate China.
What can't china do?
China must be crushed and destroyed
The amount of fat people in US makes the earth slow.
???? ? ?????
Blame them for daylight savings. Those 60nano seconds add up each day.
How do u weigh the earth?
But how about the large building which are raised all over the world
Next video idea: How a single country the United States made the world fucked up with wars and shit.
DAMn
The Earth is DAMN FLAT! So no DAMN ROTATION!
Pollution
China really needs to learn what they're doing to our earth. Before you know it the world is just gonna die because China has no idea what their pollution is doing to our planet.
Dam son
Damn. Get it?
Who cares with 60nS?
I still cant understand .. Even with my age .. DAM It.. i should go back to Highschool
Haha...this bs knows no bounds.
Can you make a video on if we can change the rotation of the earth
DAMN
4:08 literally the best transition into a sponsored message ever
Yea srfu blame china, just because theres a dam dont mean china slowed the WHOLE WORLD down
What if we blow it up?
Give me a break!! The lamest justification!!!
Because it's the future dams water what Asia is going through biggest water crisis
Is this a TRUMP's Propaganda channel ??
3:20 Arctic ice is not melting, the melting that occurs is seasonal and freezes again when fall-winter return again. In fact, there's more freezing than melting occurring. Lookup the Vostok ice core samples which provided scientific proof that climate change is not human caused. Also lookup how the sun has been radiating less heat since the 90's.
God dam it China
Well Dam
name a more iconic duo: ship and shit
dam...
Just fuck you mom, she said my dick is longer than you grandpa's.
Yes, demolish you dam first.
Well.. this video is kinda stupid, you know. ALL THOSE MATERIALS ARE FROM INSIDE OF THE EARTH. OUR EARTH'S RESOURCES NOT INCREASING OR DECREASING BECAUSE ALL HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. it's never "slowing down earth's rotation". BUT IT MAKES SOME PLACES ON EARTH SINK QUICKLY. Especially the coastal cities The thing that affecting our planet is our population. THE GLOBAL HUMAN POPULATION.
Americans are the Best Storytellers
Damn
How much did the burj kalifa slow is down
So your telling me a dam that can't even be seen from space change the speed of our humongous planet
1:48 New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Skip to 3:07 to realise why you dont give a sod and save yourself 3 minutes
Thanks china ??????
LUL
This is retarded
I see, this is why USA is trying to weaken china, if china is not stopped, they will cause earth to stop rotating and USA will on the darker side, they wil be ruined China is playing music chair with earth
No worry...Superman will encircle earth to reverse it..
More reasons to hate China..
God dam it! That's huge!!
It's 2018 and I just saw a Y U NO!? meme. Thanks for the nostalgia fella
DAMmit china you did it again....
Every rotation changes the earths rotation. This isn't big
China china china china china china. CHINA!
This video should’ve been sponsored by the gorges dam
When your mom goes up stairs the earth will just stop
Now lets count the all atrocities done on humans and on earth by european and american.
So what about skyscrapres built worldwide....the total mass of total skyscrapers should be higher than that single dam
So if we throw away Gallons of ocean waters in space, will our days get any shorter ? #JustAsking Because its senseless to blame someone for building a reservoir too big that it affects the Rotational force of the planet. Common dude, there is Quadrillion + Litres of water in oceans and under the earths surface since ages, that water is only being held in reservoir, logically its just a shift of place of water, not addition to water. No, humans cant produce water, they can just take out from earth or from the oceans !!
They also cooks dogs and cats.!
Such stupidity at it’s best
Please return my 4:55 seconds you made me waste
China has a lot of mats
I don't think this is such a good thing. I remember what happened the last time we had a leap second...
...so it just slowed down the earth a little bit.
DAM YOU CHINA
DAMN YOU CHINA
Just unlike the video before watching
Does nobody know the poles are shifting?
We must have very precise equipment to calculate that. Pretty cool!
Yo Rawanda is a fake country from a film is it not?
Wow, so many numbers
Made in china
Think china for more hour to watch youtube or you mom and you dad more time to do personal stuff
Best video I've seen in a long time
Dam'n
hmm, now i have another thing to blame on china, said donald trump
Dam Chinese Communists
China ruins everything.
This is nonsense
That's a lotta DAMage!!
its always China's fault! as always
now the earth is not 24 hour xd
Made in China
Damn it dam!
Naughty America has slowed down the world development and destroying other nations... Hate you Americans... Hope yu end up in a nuclear war against the enter world..
Trying too hard to make China bad. What a loser
By this logic each time we built something.. we slowed earth?
you fulls air resistance is not supported by earth rotation
This video was made in china
New Zicelosta Rahamanda ??
I knew that there are Chinese Employees here and get paid by the Chinese Government
Thats How They Bring The X Into X': World's Population Will Exceed 9.8B By The Year 2050 And You Won't Be Able To Find A Place To Eat, *_That Is Why, GREENE HOTDOGS Always Opened For You!_* No Matter, 1990 or 3000, WE THINK FAR BEYOND!....................................................(For Eternity)
Whatever CHINA Does!!! . . . (Great Appreciation From PAKISTAN)
Is anyone gonna say it ? I will. Your transitions to your sponsors are so damn good.
Dam,that sum big dam A truly bad joke
0:19 rap god
China did what.
This is nothing but bullshit
china is hecc
And one of the dam of China broked and now the water is entering India
if the US do this it should be OK.
100% bs
This video is meaningless
Really? Lol. Hahhahaa
China is most cunt nation after USA.what do you think guys???
Sad
So I just flushed my toilet, how much does that affect the earths rotation?
Okay!
I did a double take at 3:08 when Warhammer 40000 appeared.
A dam to slow down the earth’s rot? A downright stupid idea with absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever
D A M I T C H I N A !
DAM-mit china thats why my school hours are more S L O W E R
China is like a pussy
It applies to anything but Fuck China anyways.
The fact is only that china produces that enormous amount of electricity from one single dam
How much didn't he human race as a whole effect the earth's rotation
What the fuck is China doing I call this the Cold War
Hrm, Australia Australia dig up 817,000,000 of iron ores alone, from somewhere deep (I mean really deep), I wonder how much that slows earth
At least I got more times for sleep.
We need to nuc india and china to increase Population.
Title china massive dam slows down the earth rotation Maybe it could slow down 1 hours so 25 hours a day?????? the earth slows down 0.000006 seconds Are you fucking kidding me??
Damn you china HAHAHA??
Hey I live in New Zealand
thanks to china we have longer school days
Dam son
Damn china
die later! grow slower!
lol
How Chinese killing my country economy and my race
Damn China
This is why we must to find new earth real quick
Daaaaamn
dahmmmmm
Really???
Welp time for. More earthquakes earth we need some to speed ur ass up
Guys, who played Command And Conquer Generals?
This is rubbish. Where does all materials needed to build the dam came from? None other than from planet Earth unless it came from other planet.
“A WHOLE SECOND!” That’s a whole Ariana Grande sweetener song WOW
China, a great nation
Would it slow the Earth's rotation if every human living in a multi-storey building went upstairs?
Is it taking an affect on gravity?
No king
just fu all
Your mamas so fat that she moves the Earth's rotation when she comes down the stairs!
Im irish
Dam!
STOP CHINA
Ha ha ha ha west agenda to dethroned the east development....what the fuck is this...
....LET DESTROY THE DAM!!! Also me: let not.
7 million people also is slowing down earth
thanks china ??
Wow that was a smooth transition!!
Wow so dam crazy
I know a better duo Nagasaki and Hiroshima
What crap! I thought this channel had some rationality. It also has become a click bait.
China hacked the planet rotation speed.
Look at all the stupid morons who believe the earth is spinning a 1,000 mph. This video is more brainwashing for the stupid masses.
Dam
why im watching this xD
Blame China For Causing something Nobody cared.
Key question, who cares...
Only 1 second..in thousand of year..and u bloody fool wasted 4 mins
China no, taiwan yes
You are so daft if you believe this video. Whoever made this video needs punched in the face for being so stupid. Physics does not work that way .
I THOUGHT INDIAN POPULATION SLOWED THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH..
HOT DAMN
God damnit
I mean why tf not
Easy, Chuck Norris
please tell me.please !!! witch video aditor you use.from ??Pakistan??
This made me more younger by 000000006 seconds
GODDAMIT CHINA!! Sorry ??
NOOOOOOOO LONG SCHOOL DAY WHY!??????????????????
I BLAME CHINA BECAUSE THEY MADE THE DAY LONGER FUCK EM
I thought the earth slowed down because of the drag caused by the reservoir thingy.
Damn.....
But how is it gonna make it heavier when the materials was already on earth???
Why don't we just destroy China all country vs China how bout Dat China who win now beach
so dam crazy
Fuck China
yo, why dont we do this build more of those that it would drastically slow the earth down and we can live so much longer bc a day would last longer.
So don’t join chinese projects it’s bad for environment. Say no to xitler Belt and road project ! It will do more harm then good.
Damn
If we keep building big stuff, we will slow the rotation down by a lot
Checkmate, flat-earthers
The dam is dam big.
chuna is a bull shit country
I knew the day feels so "slow" buts you dont notice it if your a gamer
fuck it.my life already fuck up.fuck u dam
??????,??????????
It's not a DAM BIG DAM. It's a DAMN BIG DAM.
stupid...even superman cant stop rotation of earth
made in china huh
3:06 ????,?????
1:44 Iceland does not look like that wth why'd u squish it???
There is a Chinese website translated the comment section. And we Chinese can make comments on it. I am just saying, we are watching.
100 thousand percent wrong concept.
Russia: tanks driving on highways . USA stopping terrorist and looking good while doing it . China:
Dam it China
Seriously dude...
"This channel isn't about thoughtful geopolitical discussion" - proceeds to talk about politics...
DAM YOU , CHINA !!
You lost my interests at explaining the Chinese Congress. Can we leave politics out of a science show?
nope
Dam My country and Brazil made one of the largests dams
I shouldn’t of watched this stoned
china hospitals you owe me 0.00000006 seconds more before i die btw im not from china
why are we complaining thats nothing
Patanjali DAM!
Wow, China gave me enough time to jizz my pants
w aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
Damn you China! I missed class by 0,00000006 seconds??
Earth will slow down its rotation..... Already mention in my book ... Which i read.....1400 years ago... THE HOLY QURAN.. ALLAH HU AKBAR...
Really?
Look on the bright side, if the earths rotation slows then we’ll be lighter because gravity will be less.
Literally building anything upwards slows the earth
DAMN IT
Oh my lord, that segue near the end almost made me vomit...
Suck my dick
I can smell Bill Wurtz in this video
It's fine, we all are going to die anyways.
so dam crazy
the dislikes maybe is from china viewers and with that 60 nanosecs i could kill 1 more pubg player or win a pvp in minecraft
???ig dam
Dicks big dick
Dammit china
haha how china slow earth go and answer how this simple my questions
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
That's northern Ireland not Ireland
Dam thats big
Thanos: lets make it balance
So they used your mom as a dam?
to be honest, i think it made it faster..... the day goes by so fast where i live...
Dam I did not see that coming
??
****China has one dam boye*****
Dam.
Lol! I've dived off that board 2:37
Now blame China for slowed the Earth's Rotation? Why don't Y'all do something about it?
Dam son.
smooth plugin transition
The reason we Indians won't in hell want to be friends with China, they are too racist and selfish and harming other people and even chinese people is fine!
We should remove china from the earth
The only physics lesson i understand
Just a note it wasnt 200B dollars it was 200B Yuan which is like 30B dollars
Later, we can travel back in time, all you do is try swimming in the dams in China !
Cats use the same technique to land on feet
Dammmm
Good scientific video but politically biased. Insignificant change
The real question is how china slowed your brain massive dam theory
So what about USA hoving a damn to kyoto protocol and contributing to being the largest air polluter via automobiles????
Daaaaaaaamm dam
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
And those idiots are thinking about space elevators. .. (face palm)
Damn you China! Shakes fist
Lmao my stupid ass thought we slowed the Earth's rotation by like 1 hour
Why is this video blaming China for just 60 nanoseconds?
fight me des pa and cito
I don't care I repeat I don't care
fuck you china you alowed it down now we have less time to live
1:45 aye I hear the Bahamas ????????
DAMN
the materials that they built with are from earth so it would make no difference in the mass of the earth
.______________?
Dam, China. You flipped us off
Dam that sponsor transitiin was good.
I knew it I noticed some change.
These asian monkeys are fucking everything up
Dam shit
China should give up some of it's land so China wouldn't need to build the damp for so many people.
Umm excuse me? Ok jk, even though I’m from China (though I don’t live there) I care it slows down the earth but at the same time not really, and I don’t decide weather to build a dam or something, it’s the government that makes these choices, so I can’t just tell the government to stop making dams. Though I don’t really care
3:10 wait do warhammer 40k just went up by 7 millennia, when did that happened??????
60 NANOSECONDS!??! inhales CHINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
0.00006 extra seconds of school
I don't give a DAM
That Iceland now that's beautiful
Those Chinese made life worth again
This dam made my class 60 nanoseconds longer.
double pump.
SHUT IT DOWN
Dude, i hate this kind of fantasy. It's not scientific ?? U really need to learn physics
Well China ty so much for this. Now I won’t know if the time is the same.
0:14 Any percy Jackson fans here ..dammm
this is bunch of bullshit vsauce said that even mt everest is nothing but a bump of 0.2mm if earth is 1ft globe and you are saying 90m damn change the rotation lol dumbass twat disliked
GOD DAM
1like = 1 hate to China 1 comment = fuck China
great... now this world will be slower... I FUCKING WANT TO GET OUT FROM MATH CLASS
Kainis ka china ka
if Earth's rotation slows down, Technically we'll live longer
if Earth's rotation slows down, Technically we'll live longer
I want my 4:54 minutes back.
Just nuclear China for no problems
Blame China!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Dam. That's Quite Big!
Most Chinese Tourist's are Disrespectfull to National Monuments. Its Just my Opininon though
Soon we gonna have 29 hours per day....
This looks like a bill wurtz video
Can I believe this guy?
Fuck 60 more nanoseconds of school
Thank you China I'll age slowly now!
Made in China Intenfies
Damn
DAM CHINA
THANKS CHINA
Show this to flat earthers
I save 0.00000000000000000000006 seconds and lose +300 seconds to this vid
Damn this video is good
Dam son
No wonder I stay in school longer
0:32 that shoutout to Wendover tho, kudos to you!
Extra Thicc A$$ = Slow AF Rotation
So since the polar ice caps are melting in the future days will be way longer
does this mean school is a few nano seconds longer?
The "dam" is so big amirite?
Earth doesn't rotate, its just a theory that's wrong. It's never been proven that the earth rotates ever! Michealson Morley experiment proved that it doesn't. So this video is wrong and misleading
4:09 Subtle, my friends. Subtle.
PROPADAMDA
I picked up my phone to look at brilliant but the earth slowed down
I’ll name a better duo strawberry’s and nails
Shit I was born in 2004
What else is China to blame? Climate change?
Nice war hammer refrence
Is it a god dam?
So that's why I was late that one day. China slowed the Earth's rotation down. Wait, I would be on time...
- Its time to sleep Jimmy. + No dad! I still have 0.000000006 seconds!
now i have to be in school longer! DAM YOU CHINA
Oh no, 60 nanoseconds, i can sleep that much longer.
What did the fish say when it hit a wall? "Dam!"
Sans undertale
Oooo i think the “rod and ring” prophecy where it says “the belly of the dragon will drip water”... yeah. This.
Dam...
Jealousy
The dam did not cost $200 million. It cost close to $20 billion
Typical low IQ western media,Even Newton can't save you .You should go back to school and study classical physics for a few more years.
Huge population from west China moves to East China every year, guess that accelerates the rotation of earth a little bit.
Dayum
dam it
Bruh, you didnt lie when you said shit memes
Daaaaaam
It's easy It's a country that's why
Thx china!! Now we have to stay in school x4 now!
:C how dare you i live in it
??amn
fuck china!!! jk:)
So if it doesn't affects us then why am I watching this.
nooooo a extra second!!!
f**k you china
What kind of idiot would believe a dam can slow the rotation of the earth ? Who thinks this stuff up LOL
If China slowed time speed, we get free extra time
Even if 60 nano seconds...they managed to sloe down earth, bet the chinease will make another one bigger
fucc china
Dam it was big
They built the dams so our vietnamese people don't have water for water our crops
That dam's size is too DAM crazy
Please cite your sources, it would make the verification process of the informations validity far more convenient.
Finally i can sleep 0.000006 longer
I am messing with the Earth's rotation by jumping up and down!!
The pun in the beginning...
Dam son.
How about wakanda?
Wow just wow
Cone on how to defeat a pun By a. Damn pUNishment HOLY SHEEIIEIIIT
Brazil has a better dam
made in china
I guess we can just blame everything on China and that make things easier
the power of communism
That's why Indonesia had many earthquakes nowadays. e.g. Lombok, Palu etc.
a cup of water can slow the Earth's rotation too! by a very little bit.
BEWARE!! BECAUSE THIS IS MADE IN CHINA
HOLY S***T
2 iconic duo : Logan Paul - Dead Body
sorry I did not know we did that I'm chinese
really china
WOW
So china is making my school days longer? GOD DAMMIT!
So when a feather drop, the earth's rotation will slow
China a threat to world??
wow so smart... first of all dam with floating solar more efficiency eco friendly. 2nd more fresh water. 3rd more fresh water fishes.4 your mom are 1 of the reason why the earth slow down by 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 s
The only time China made something and it extended the longevity time.
INFINITE SPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNN (yes, this IS a jojo reference)
the most stupid and illogical video ever.
So you reckon the Earth Spins..........really........you silly people.......
The moon is a spaceship idiots
Damn, that's a big dam.
Should be called half of this is an advertisement.
*A youtuber stops the korean war* *china slowed the rotation of the earth* the world is weird af
Dam china
YOU NIBBA BLAMING CHINA
now i can complete my homework since the day is 60 nano seconds long
Wow we have found the biggest FUCKING complainer ever WOW ONLY A 0.00000006 DIFFERENCE WOW YOU SUCK
U wot m8
New Zicelosta Rahamanda What a country
THE COMMUNISTS ARE TAKING OVER THE EARTH'S ROTATION
I mean at least he acknowledged that the memes are severely outdated?
Hella good Segway my dude
all i have to say is...dam
Dam, theresa lot of dam jokes about dams.
will dislike any video with "feet"
This dam was in the world war z book
thanks china for the problem you create.... we all love you....NOT!!!!!!!!! lol......
damn son
So smooth segue
So our average day 1 hour back then? Love the world.
Fucking China Why is it always China causing Earthly problems??
A N I H C
this video was not true what so every -_- what was the point of this!?
I guess they do give a dam, and a pretty fucking big dam at that.
So, china messing with the poles and inertia is fine, but I cant buy a straw in California. Dicks.
The 67% approval rate was considered insanely controversial only because in China any government proposal requires two thirds of the delegates to vote yes to be approved. That's 66.7%. 67% is dangerously close.
I blame china for the fact I have to wait longer for my birthday! I'm gonna sue....
Us watching this video slows the Earth's rotation :D
Chinese Dragon Intensifies
But is this good or bad
Dam, that's bad. Water they thinking in when the installed this thing.
Dude, these Chinese are some damn Heretics!
???
Funny that HAI has half as many subscribers ??????
Stop blaming China for 1 second when people play fortnite for 1year
Does this mean that a damn dam is the reason that all of our lives just got 0.00000006 seconds longer?
damn, that's interesting haha get it
Well he spoke fast
0.00000 WTF Why is this a big deal.
give me my 4.14 minuts of my life beck
1:47 it should be united Ireland because em unionists are as scum
well f*** china I WANT TO BE 15 ALREADY!!!
Blaming china for less than a second? I find it pointless to even waste your time blaming them ??
Guys, go check a channel called Tahirtoo saucy. I won't say anything else (don't want to spoil it)
so, if i stand up the earths rotation slows down?
Man you talk fast!!
Im playing game of war but this one player keeps kicking my ass
What about skyscrapers and high buildings
Dirty closed eyed people who can’t drive small penis bitches.
china a good place to get sick
SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda sound awesome!
Enough for Trump to blame China again ??
Oh come on now school get more time
Waganda shit is this
Dem China u guys are...
good job jackass you'll destroy us
Who would win: >A Planet with it's powerful natural force. Or > one dam boye?
Now I know why my salary is always late by 0.8nano seconds
You have Chinese viewers you know "their energy"
Dam it China
Thanks China ? (Seriously)
When you have a test tomorrow and you don’t have time to study so you slow down the day/night cycle
+1s
So The Earthquake On Indonesia Was Earth Trying To be Faster? RIDICULOUS
AAAAGGGGHHHHHH! rotational dynamics! They followed me to youtube! Noooooooo!
If china is gonna build MORE DAMS
So we steal 0.1 nanoseconds and earth take 1sec back by earth quake? ??
How west criticize others but totally ok doing bad thing themselves.....
You better learn some mandarin. You reading this comment. You got maybe 20 years at best. Should be enough time though.
Well, not that much effect on earth or china
Dam what have you been smoking, dam sure its dam exquisite and dam expensive dam......dam........dam.
Earth : Too Much People ! China : You Want More ? Sure !
Really? 60 nanoseconds China. :/
Too many puns
gahd-DAM
China is destroying the world!
I am surprised that the compass in the 3:18 is not made in china.
Feet.. Pound.. Wtf.. Everyone is using Metric's System.. just 2 Idiotic states are thinking they do not need it but still rely fully on the metric system..
Slow earth but when search it on google earth its just a dot on the screen
but china has low gravity.
Let's be real, do we really need China
Huh didn't except this video too be so funny and memetastic
DAMMIT CHINA
I'd rather have 60 seconds in a day then this freaking earth is spinning too fast!! This earth needs to slow down!
They were trying to stop it from flooding. How about not building a city in a flood plain?
Wow china you`re so great Hope Trump Nukes your country FUCK CHINA HEIL AMERICA TRUMP AND HITLER
One damn power 1.5% of the world largest economy sound crazy too me.
That smooth transition tho
i-i didnt remember h.a.i being this memey
will that dam fit in my civic?
God dam it china.
4:10 when he tried to reel us in the sponsor was smoothness level 9000
Wendover/HAI is so buttersmooth (evidenced by ad transitions), that I hope he never enters the same room as my significant other.
You know what's brilliant? That transition.
Oh dam
If children went to the North Pole to find santa they need to move a few inches to find it
Hmmmmm no wounder why China and North Korea are friends ??
China why would you do this to us?
earth weighs 1million septillion pounds or whatever better get working out girl
China op please nerf China idea
with that much energy you could power like 77.916 trillion hair dryers.
Yeah I felt the change.
Not going to mention that it runs at about 47% capacity?
Hecking dam China
Take that flat earthers.
Where is that thing at 3:41
i like this guy
Thank you China, very cool.
So what you gonna do for that 0.00000006 seconds in a day? I feel my IQ has been insulted.
Don't remember northern Ireland being the whole island of Ireland
well dam
I laughed at the warhhamer 40k logo popping up hahahaha
Whoops here the pjo fans come. Dam, they really reach the vast reaches of the Internet, don’t they? Wait, in pjo canon didn’t Hermes invent the Internet? Oh gods, IM INFECTED! SCHIST SCHIST SCHIST!!!
That segway though...
China is building a bigger dam in Yarlu Tsangpo river. Nice.
I love how everything china does is ridiculously scrutinized but the west can literally burn the planet down and everybody just shrugs.
Damm. It China
A more iconic duo you say? Franz ferdinand and opentop cars
The earth is toooo big and heavy to change becuase a a dam
We're updating the servers after all of this rotation changes.
Oh no an extra 1 second
Does getting a boner slow down the Earth's rotation?
sorry but i could only here 20% of your words
Fatty Americans are also slowing down our rotation, by means of shifting the mass center of the earth with their weight
Dam that was a good sponsor transition!
2:08 Why is there between two spaces four zeros?
Damn China!
Nuke China a million times who cares of they attack us just nuke'em
I bet that the Chinese government will use this as propaganda.
Dam.
Child: My day at school is longer >:v
I want to go to that dam and but c4's and explode it xD
Let's make New Zicelosta Rahamanda a real place!
dam
Lol at this video
the dam is FAKE cuz its “made in china”
I can’t think of an original joke about dams Dam it
After all it is "Made In China"
so this is why days seem longer these times
how Chinese makes the earth!we made out of u or
deez puns are so dam hard
Badchina
3:10 dat nerdout
Wtf china i thot u build fake company instead of dam damn it
Dam.
Dam Son
Damn nice vid
So it wasn't only the artificial satellites that slows the rotation.
If water on one side of the dam goes up.. then the water on the other side goes down rite? What's the point of the video..??
HOW A CHINESE DAM RUINED MY SLEEP SCHEDULE (storytime)
“New zealand and ireland”(shows northern ireland
Tf
This comment slowed down Earth by very very very tiny bit
ok, this was bullshit.
China's dam is meaningless compare to the moon and our magnetic field effects and slowing down our planet
One word: Oof
All we had to was the Follow the dam train!cj!
DAMn YOU CHINA!!!!
Damn this videos are about dam
Dam it, china
What is the scientific basis of this video?
ok, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
China... Ur dam is soo dam crazy just like ur dam as country(I’m chinese but who cares about China)
Hehehe... dam
1:20 200 billion YUAN
2:59 I died laughing
I'm from New Zealand :)
Dam son
I sleep longer now?
Too Many Dam! Joke in this Video
Guess u can say... china doesn't give a DAM internalized screaming intensifies
"dam"
delusional disorder
Owo I have Chinese money ??
Taiwan is the real China
DAM'N
Is this v sauce
Who would win: A rock floating in space that miraculously has life Or one blocky boi
See this is why i don't exercise. The less I move, the less effect I'll have on the planet.
Fuckin China, some one kill the dragon.
When I Scrolled Down The Recommended Section I Read........How China Swallowed The Earth...????????
if the earth stopped sudenly we would all be killed by inertia
Dam it China, but don't build another dam.
This China do when it sees a river? Damn it...
Is it enough to make leap years redundant
Dam Daniel!
Well dam
Damn it Jin Yang!
Now school lasts longer
You can always rely on China to ruin everything
A dam slows the rotation of the Earth ?? Pmsl! What a load of bollocks!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Is this bad? If so, Damnit China
Oh my fucking Q. Corporate shill! Just put a fucking banner on the video, why don't you?
wait, guys lets dig a massive ass crater in the ground, i wanna die faster pls
I'm from China. Now I know why we built that dam in the first place. We do so to screw up the accuracy of GPS so that US can't strike their missiles as accurate as before :) But serious though, it's kinda a project that's only become a thing because it was during the time when China went too lefty in the concept of socialism but didn't consider the morality of things enough (as such the design of the dam is said to be a bit faulty but being pushed to production anyway, and not enough thought is being put into all the negative environmental consequences, and up till today in China it's still something people point at and say "damn, put more thought next time"). However, there's still one valid reason that the dam should exist. China has the kind of weird geographical sturcture that the whole country is being split up into 3 stages, aka there are giant waterfalls splitting all the rivers into segments, and having a dam could extend the ferry line deeper into the continent. Basically it's good for industry as it's just awkward to land transport everything to Shanghai before being able to ship them out.
so. much. incorrect. data.
thankq china, now I can sleep more
Is this even a problem while American pumping water into the ground to get oil and burning those oil all together?
Eliminate China
Thanks China.
Damn china making me stay in school for 60 nano seconds more, smh.
Don’t really see what is the big problem, but I guess we’re blaming China as always ????
Dam it china
dankzte ???iver
how about sky scrapers, thousands of them, pyramids?
Dam
This is the swiftest shift from topic to ad i have seen in HAI.
If everyone in China bent over and farted at the same time, in the same direction the combined thrust could either speed up or slow the earth’s rotation as well.
Dam it
60 NANOSECONDS?!?! HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!
Wow we have longer days. First the world was going to end in 2012 now this. We're going backwards.
I just knew it became an ad because his voice's tone changed.
Stop talking s*** about China. It's not nice and you know that China has had enough from western verbal bullies.
god dam it.
1:44 that is not the shape of Island
Damn China!
should ban all dam then....probably already cost us almost a miNute ...????????
smooth segway like linus xD
Build more dams until we're immortal!
Bull Fucking Shit!
Still china 1#
1 second over 46k years who cares
That wasn’t very cash money of you china
Lol Damn.....
This probably explains why I feal sleepy and board
I find it funny who people waste billions on shitty things
Anyone waiting for war, add that dam to your nuke list
That wasn't very cash money of china
New Zicelosta Ranamanda
M e m e
Yo mean if I stand from my bed, i slow down the earth rotation? Yea, I have a global effect! I'm important now!
Shut Up , the earth is still and static so stop misleading people
I'm gonna miss those 60 nanoseconds, coulda used them for something valuable... China, WHYYYYYY
That's a lotta dam-age
I will never be able to predict when the slide into the promotion comes...
This is the most click bait title, but it is so accurate at the same time.
Probably
let me guess...... it changed by 5 millimeters per month or something :P stop the clickbait
0:43 “… damn big dam.”
every part of this video is a 10/10
soooo basically https://youtu.be/-6Q3W3Y7YdY
Didnt know you could put the axis powers to this video
No, that was the beavers.
Oh no! One more second of Only War!
these damn communists keep destroying shit first the soviets with the 4rth largest lake and now this shit
So that’s why 1+1=2
This is like how teachers over react about shit
proof that global warming is a scam
DAM SON! Get it? Get the pun?
Bad map downvote
Hi the thumbnail is inaccurate, the Earth rotates counter-clockwise not clockwise
How many Boeing 747s would fit into it
This video is brilliant .org
Omg I feel sorry for ypure parents ur so pathetic
the clickbait was strong in this one....unsubbed till you start making good videos again
yay Ireland my favourite Country I live there
Damn you china! You're messing up my schedule!!
I Disapprove
Red Hot Chili Peppers plays "How a massive dam in china slowed the earth's rotation And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication"
time taken for half as intresting for making a video making the video - 1 week finding a brilliant trannsaction from the vidio to the 'brilliant' ad - 1 month
DAMn
I love how you sell your ads??
3:09 UP for that Warhammer 40K reference!
Dam it China. I had to
But why do i feel like times is going faster????
Okay...we need to speed up the earth so on the count of three...everyone flush the toilet
we must start war against china
0:45 America and lawn mower accidents
Are you mad?.... As in insane. I think you might be.
No it didn’t
I was half interested in watching this video.
Damn that dam slowed down earths rotation......damnnnnnn
0:41 dam T H I C C dam
Holy shit that ad transition!
What if we can blow up the Moon?
Slower earth rotation means more and more earthquakes
This is why I hate CHINAH, they make cheap rippoffs.????????
How watching at the clickbait title of this video made me question the existence of humanity
This video was exactly on the channel name HALF AS INTERESTING
Damn
damn
China namba wan
4:10 One of the smoothest segues i've ever come across!
so they fucked up time and it still hasnt been fixed?
a better duo than a dam big DAM THE HARDY BOYS!!!
wait WHAT!?!?!?
Finally, febuary is fixed (kinda)
China is going to stop earth rotation ????????????
Fuckin china man thank you i have 9 Nanoseconds of extra time on my homework
In the grimdarkness of the future, days are one second longer.
Danm
Trim a little off the top of Mount Everest. You're welcome.
China seems to always be trying to bend the rules of the earth
Propaganda video.
Dam, that's powerful
I had no idea that the South Pole moved every year
It's amazing how a dam is able to slow the rotation of the earth
DAM.....
The dam is dam big And yeah China you owe me 0.000001 second of my life
Hentai & Lolicon.
This liberal crying about 0.8 change. What a betamale
Dam it China!
Goddamnit China.
Well done China
Dam China. Now u make a fake earth today.
It is not possible to slow it down no matter what
Dam, I want my 60 nanoseconds back.
I like how Half as Interesting videos are Twice as Interesting as other videos.
60 whole nano seconds how are you ok with this thats like an extra million hours on monday
Dam it China
This is how western people keep to blame China everyday.
So fucking damn dam Lmao
This is bullshit,we would die if that happened everything is in the perfect place at the perfect time ,Idgaf what this fuck says
And that's how beavers destroyed destroyed world
I think Chinese disliked the video.....:):)
-_-
Well I be damned. When I heard china can control the earth's rotation speed, it felt like my world slowed down.
GODDAMIT HOW ARE YOUR TRANSITIONS SO SMOOOOOTH
GOD DAM IT!
What the actual shit
does burg khalifa affect these thing too?
Slow earth was a great problem.. Taliban finally solved it by destroying world trade centers...
Fuck china
so china make your day became longer?
Stop talking through your asshole. Do you know why there are more white man who got cancer compare to other race ?
60 nanoseconds slower per day, by just one single dam? thats dam crazy ;P
Stop blamin china
For a second, i thought the title said "How A Massive Damn China Slowed the Earth's Rotation"
Wish I was half as original
dAm
I haven't watched the video and I already knew the Three Gorges dam was the answer.
2:02 My OCD cannot look at this very poorly made standard form. Should be 3.785*10^14.
Pandas are cunts
From stealing lands they don't own and now slowing down Earth's rotation? Wow. I'm not surprised at all.
What a nice transition to the advertisement!
Another great 'Brilliant' segue.
DAMmit China!
I'll be DAMned!
1:41 That's my Home Kia Ora from Aotearoa NZ ??
??all these comments....well if you dont understand dont critisice it
The earthquake in Japan in 2011 sped up the earth, so it's all equalised
Retarded video made by retards.
Dam! No wonder those staff meetings have seemed longer lately.
hey he mentioned my country looks like i'm famous now
Fuck u china
60 Nanoseconds Damn
Damnnnnn
i call bullshit on this YouTube video
ChInA mAdE cLiMaTe ChAnGe - Trump
Oh no
What did the salmon say when it hit a big fat wall upstream? DAMMMMMmmmm...
1:46 That’s a map of the Maldives.
these dam chinese engineers and their dam machinations....
Your full of shit
Bullshit
Great video! Just to let you know the dam cost 200 billion yuan but only $23 billion dollars
my fart slowed a fraction of Earth rotation
Definitely the most entertaining video to date, love the information, jokes and delivery. This channel is fast becoming one of my favourites!
"Sub to Wendover instead" haha
0:38-0:40 what a NI????A
0:13 DAMMMNNN
Goddamit China
Dam that's a lot of time
Thank you subscribe
Just found this channel and damn is this good.
FUCK U CHINAAA DAMMM UUUU GO TO HELLL YOU ASSS HATTED DICK WADSSSS
Build another one in USA. Problem solved.
Dam China!
1000 comment!
Dam the Dams for the Damn Chinese Dam-makers!
China does all the worst things to the Earth while America gets all the blame
Isn't the earth titled on its axis by 23 degree??
Thanks China!
If you were using memes you should of just said some damn thicc dams
i hate china
How A Massive Dam in China Slowed the Earth's Rotation How A Massive Dam in China Slowed Our Rotation
Dumb communist
1:48 yay a new country!
Fuckin china??
When will they succeed in stopping the Earth's rotation completely?
WELP MORE TIME WASTED IN SCHOOL
every single movement on earth has an effect on the earth's rotation. even your mum going up some stairs or honestly even an ant moving up an anthill slows the earth's rotation.
But the materials were already on the earth
Useless. Especially since the earth does not rotate, anyway.
Thanks China.
Dam Daniel
3:08 Warhammer 40k!
so thats why school takes so long
And the nobel price to the smoothest ad integration ever goes to...
United States: “We have a volcano that can cause a global depression”. Russia: “We have the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet”. China: “We created a dam so large, it slowed the rotational speed of Earth”.
All of these videos are him making bad jokes for 50% of the video and not getting to the point for 80% of the video. lol.
That segue, god dam. You're getting better at taking two seemingly completely unrelated topics and seamlessly transitioning between them. It's kind of scary.
China is stopping the earth from going yeeticus Maximus and my days are getting longer. They should be yeeticus maximused off the earth
Only on channels like these would someone find a way to segue from angular momentum into a brilliant.org sponsor... thanks HaI.
Fuck China and their abducting people and putting them into ‘re-education camps’. Bunch of fuckin assholes, they are.
good point. every time you take a shit, you literally accelerate the earth's rotation.
god dam
DAM
Come on, China! 0.00000006 seconds? What’s wrong with you?! My life will never be the same because of those 60 extra nanoseconds ruining my day.
This some sorta hidden apple commercial? saw 3 different apple devices
Sources for this? The only websites I can find that support this are pop-science websites, no actual papers written on it. Seriously, this sounds very dubious. The the tides on the ocean move more water around than this dam holds back.
Dam it China.
WWW on social media USA: let's comment something stupid to him China: WOT DA USA: BLOCK Continue? NO
Should I give a dam about this dam information?
Dam, China. Ruining it for everybody else by making our days longer.
Stupid china!
I thought the only thing China slowed down was the highways
These stupid communists are bad for the Earth!!!!!!!
Dam that's weird
It just astounds me that humans have the capacity to shake the world with our shit :|
but I think that time loss could be negligible compared to all water which is melting in the top of the highest mountains
i didn't saw the transition to the add coming. It's the best one yet!!
When the dinosaurs were around, a day was 23 hours.
Jean Claude Van Dam
Nice job China
This is basically RTGame by in real life
Nobody gives a Dam!
I blame China for longer dats
something something vsauce something
Making those puns makes this channel half as interesting
No it didnt. Fucking Fake news
Then why isn't Everything on Slow Motion HUUHHUHHHHHH???????
those dirty commies
So if we make a space elevator we will make days longer
Dam
Dam
Dam.. he really made me feel important at the end there...probably just because i'm fucking fried right now
So if we all fart at once in the same direction can we make our days go faster?
God dam it china
2:08 I like how the billions digit has four zeroes :)
God dam it china
Dam. That may have been your silkiest segue yet.
YAY NZ GOT MENTIONED.
Editor truly outdid themself this time. This video was cuhrazy!
Technically, just accelerating your car in the direction of Earth's rotation slows it down. Just not measurably.
That was a smooth transition to the sponser.
Damm China
They probably learned from Brilliant and Wix
Wow, you completely butchered the great and eternal leader's name. You're on a list now. And everyone who watched this video. Death of Stalin anyone? :)
ty dam! i live in new zealand
They don’t give a dam about the earths rotation
fuck you chine give back my time
WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
Ok
Man u re even more dumb than Trump! This is hilarious! LMAO Thanks for make me laugh,
I did this case study with my geography class and this video was more informative in 10 minutes than my teacher did in 2 years.
Damnit that´s one damn big dam!
Duck hunt duo.
Will there be a dam built to slow the earth’s rotation by 18493858839204968848271656585992874747829 minutes?
Bullshit
isn't is enough for America to invade China???? opps..... sorry, its China not Iraq....
Dam it China, yet again you just can't be normal!
You guys are dumb if you believe this shyte.
China:*DAMN* Earth slows down
god dam!
A brilliant person DOES NOT pay for intelligence.
The phone used in the ad at the end has a piece of screen missing.
Smooooth transition
that transition to sponsor tho slowclaps
Dammit china ya did it again Most polluted then most populated now this?
Dam son
okay time to put my phone down for today
Ok so when I jump I slow the earth down and cause the earth day to be .000000000000000000000006 nano seconds longer
Sounds like the effects can be worse than climate change...
What the fuck is wrong with this channel..!!???
U r fucking genius
Nice segway
0.00000006 , no one gives a shit bro There are many factors speeding the earth's rotation this is no exception.
fucking china dude how could you do this to the people after 1261531712362 year u killed our (grand grand grand x 7432877) children
There's an extra 0 in the weight of the Earth in pounds...
Insane
That’s not Ireland that’s Northen Ireland its a part of the UK while the other part of Ireland is not part of any thing.
I love the Warhammer 40,000 reference!
3:20 thank god that compass is made in Germany not China??
The memes man im crying
Thanks China I can know sleep 0.00000006 seconds longer
Elevators have counterweights .
How dumm do you have to be to say this
Opinions vary, but the Chinese do give a Dam!
God damit China
F*** ME THOSE NANOSECONDS ARE SO DAM LONG SCHOOL IS TOO LONG BECAUSE OF DAM CHINA
How the fuck
I know it says the sounds are from “epidemic songs” but does anyone know the specific song at 2:10?
Damn. Dam.
Wait, was that about ecological damage?
So the Dams are responsible for making my day longer FUCK DAMS!!
I comment just to see 900 comments
Smooth ad
The fact that he voices memes and jokes with a generic-ass voice just adds that tad bit of humor that is funny for no reason at all
3:55 that's San Vicente Reservoir in San Diego county it's like 5 min from my house, they just made the dam bigger on top of the old one. It's really cool how they did it
Hey, you just breaking billions of china peoples heart you have to paid it! #Just kidding
So since a day is longer China reduced the world life expectancy...
lol china, "a more developed nation" still eats dogs, bugs and shark fins. seems like a 1st world country.
No wonder, school feels longer. Bloody China making it slower. Dam it China, I will no longer be asian. I will now identify as a extraterrestrial being. Fuck this shit.
Say... that brilliant link for the first 200. You've been using it for alot of your videos. And still no 200 free loaders?? Brilliant.org must not be so interesting then ;-) or worse... free brilliant courses must be a scam ??
In my country theres some sort of story/urban legend? Idk... But some people belive a day is 16 hours not 24 and every higher up or scientist is lying... What a bunch of goofs...
But... Its flat ??
China will grow larger!!
3:09 That Warhammer 40k reference.
Oh angular momentum. Wish I could've paid attention in physics class.
Damn! tat boi can fit so many dams in it!
Guys I'm sure this dude wrote percy jackson
Is this US propaganda?
Damn chinese increasing our daily work hours (some redneck probably)
next video: how half as interesting makes his ad transitions
Are you China be funny?
Everytime I watch an HAI video, I always try to guess when will the ad appear I've watched enough HAI videos to know when will the ad appear
Thanks, China for wasting 1 whole second of people in 47650 CE! Probably when the Himalayas got lifted when Indian plate started colliding with Asian plate, the world got few seconds late! So thanks India! Because of you guys the world is still living in the past
what happened to the other 2/3rds of Iceland?
Being 60 nanoseconds late on school...
Let's slow down the earth to make it 30 hours in a day, and lets slow down the process going on in our bodies to add another, oh, how about 300 years? 300 years with 30 hour days. That'd be.... half as interesting!
Ok. China.....China! Chil da fuk ot
Thor lives in that dam
Gina
COMMUNISM STOPS THE EARTH
How much would the earth slow down due to molten icecaps moving from the poles towards the equator?
Let the jokes flow
Damn only one second tho lol
That's fuck all for a big outfit like this.
Even somebody walking or stopping technically changes the rotation of the earth.
"I broke the dam"
That was too smooth... The hell.
Trump was right (CHINA)
Do you ever read the comments? If you do GOOD video man! Keep up the good work!!
1:43 That's no Iceland
but why would it slow down earth? like before the dam was made and the water was put in the water and materials already were on earth but were just moved so how did it effect it??
Fucking asians
basically china's middle finger to world by screwing up the world's gps systems.... slighty

So many anti Chinese video, please get a job
Damn big dam
“I COULD USE SOME DAM FRENCH FRIES!” Zöe: confused
fuck you and your shit advertising at the start of videos.
Can they build some more so I can have more time in my day? (Like, a lot more)
Dafuq is china
this dam can only be built in China because democracy will not allow such contraversial project being executed. Thats why China is such a great country with rocket-like developement. Greater good is the only target and we have dont need to waste time or resources on those who are weak.
Dammit China! wait don't
Since this will be buried in comments I deny the Armenian genocide.
Dam it china.
Thats why todays science class was so damn long u damn china????
Who else thought they slowed the earth because of their enormous population.
Communist scums
This man made the greatest ad transition again. I salute you
Nice ad transition
Thanks to china so i can play longer before midnight
When he made the dam joke, who remembered that one part in the Percy Jackson books.
Shut up Norman
This video was hilarious (and interesting) Good job ???endov... wait
you flipped Costa Rica
So Did I watch a 4:55 long ad about brilliant.org.??????
So if build a dam big enough ill finnally have enough time in day to accomplish actually something without being deprived of sleep?
Dammmn, China
Damn, if it wasn’t for them, we would have shorter school times
Yeet
"Dam" it
The ending was quite junkish though??. No hard feelings !!!!!!
The beat our dams, because we don't have mountains. But they will never beat our delta works ~the Netherlands
I see sea
Well great, now we get to work even longer hours...
I somehoe failed to detect an imminent segue for this video like I always do
It was 200 billion Yuan, roughly equivalent to 31 billion Usd, not 200 billion USD.
Dam! At least that compass wasn't Made in China. Plus, give it a nice strong earthquake in the right area of that dam then, maybe that dam will go bye bye.
Wow democracy
Dam fine job in your reporting.
Next level clickbait OMEGALUL
0:07 - O:33 Top 10 Rappers Eminem is afraid to Diss
The question is how do you know that it happened because China made a dam...? It may have happened because of some other events, i don't know but it could be anything, like affected by the Sun, or sliding of some tactonic plates, etc.
Damn it China
Fucking dirty slope commies, I’m gonna blow those damn dams up.
We need to learn to live with the planet instead of just on it WHO'S WITH ME?!
"This probably won't kill us" Thanks. Thanks for the reassurance.
THANKS A LOT CHINA!!!
Ok, this channel will becoming the next Grandayy.
This Dark Theme is too fucking good
I can wake up 60 nanoseconds late now. Yay
So they made my school day longer? Fucking...
If you step one step higher, the earth also rotates slower. WOW WHO CARES
Damn
Dam...
Where's the dam snack bar?
1:00 only one party communist in a nutshell, also I live in hongkong
nothing can slow or speed up the earth's rotation.
At least that you wrote metric under imperial system, but still!
You running out of ideas
This is a bad hoax and a western style double standard video, the Hoover dam blocked Mexicans access to water, and what do you wanna say about that?
Damn good China, more time to finish my homework
2:08 typo
For the emperor
Thanks a lot you chinese idiotics, NOW WERE ALL GOING TO FUCKING DIE FOR FUCKING FUCK FUCK SAKE!!!
So For Building Bigger Cleaner Power plants, a Nanosecond in a day would be added, Imagine more Projects like this to Reduce Carbon Emissions are Passed, Could we Get 25 Hours in a Day as the Millenia passes?
Modern warfare will now be lengthening the days
Oh god! Not a 6 hundred millionth of a second!
Did somebody say CCP, the creators of my most played game?
The earth don't rotate tho ????
0.00000006*365.25*(85-15)=0.00153 days. I will be 0.00153 days younger when i die (well i am just as old but the year counter says i am younger) or 132.5 seconds
That is one big dam dam
I want Brilliant to teach me how to transition from a conversation to an advertisement as smoothly as you
Thank you china.. I have to stop watching TV and go to bed 60 nanoseconds earlier..
Dam Daniel kill me
And here I was thinking CO2 was meant to be the blame for all of the problems on earth.
Another effective way to slow the Earth's rotation: space elevators. A single ribbon extended well past geostationary orbit would be ideal. Then lift a bunch of bulk mass up the elevator as far as it goes and simply release it at the top. A few billion tons lifted and released should have a noticeable effect on the spin of Earth.
2:01 But how many cups is that?
‘Dam big dam’ *ba dum tshh*
Goddamm communist tryin to slow down my earth

I can't blame China dams are pretty cool tbh
I'd like to make myself belive
Dam it
great job ching chongs
Isn't this dam better than the Mexican border wall?
The true north and south pole are not moving and never will. The magnetic north and south poles are constantly moving and right now the magnetic south pole in the ocean and not marked like the video claims.
Damn china
More dams
No idea why I’m not subbed in this channel though been a sub in your other channel for several years now.
that Segway to the sponsor was great
So in theory, we could also make it spin faster?
damn dam you scary
Relocate people in Chinese terms means firing squad ??
This is a dam lie !
1:43 That's not Iceland...

So I have this dam to blame for my day lasting slightly longer. The key to immortality is bigger dams.
You said ireland that’s the north retard
The moon is doing the same thing; on a much larger scale.
Does that mean school is longer
The transition to the sponsor at the end...
Pointless video. I dont get your message. What are you trying to tell about? Just meaningless presentation.
God damn the Chinese for slowing the earth and stealing our jobs
The earth loses it aerodynamic.
Holy shit China!
Damn.
Don't worry guys, it will last for 2 weeks.
china is very extremely idiot country they are the ones who damage mother nature xddddddddddddddddd
I love the way 40k slipped in like that
Damn dam... I’ll go now
Dam, China!
stupid video
1:43 That's Northern Ireland, not Ireland Ireland. And yes, it is quite the big mistake
In the grim darkness of the far future...blame China
HMMH, SCHOOL TIME IS LONGER DAMN IT
that is SO dam gorgeous
That was a shitty reason
That Warhammer 46750 though...

Damn it china
Fuck China, Free Tibet
I almost got whiplash when you made that segue
I went to New Zicelosta Rahamanda once. It was confusing
This is dam good video, plenty of knowledge flowing.
Oh boy, RT really had fun with this one.
A fish was swimming in a lake then it hit a wall, what did the fish say?
Probably won't kill us. **Probably.**
Dude... interesting.
Use Metric better
What a long ad spot at the beginning. It took an entire 4 minutes before he got to how I could learn about moment of inertia at brilliant.org/hai.
Dam it's cool ..
is it enough to make my GPS inaccurate ?
Awesome content, keep it up.
I still remember the government promised that electricity bill would drop xx% with the completion of this dam, so they charged everyone xx% extra to help funding the construction project. 15 years have pass since the completion, they are still charging us this extra bill with the promise of lower electricity cost nowhere to be seen, what a joke
We can thank the Chinese for delay the return of the god emperor of mankind by a single second Purge the heretics
Shoutout to the animator, this was dam impressive.
Daaaaaamn said Amsterdam
Good job China now i will live for less days
this man still cannot pronounce the word “regularly”. good content though
So, Trump build the wall because he's so jealous at China's Big Beautiful Dam!!? Because it can hold tremendous amount of water!!?
2:09 1,000,000,000,000,4Zeros,000,000,000lbs
Wow. 0.000000003 is nothing....
1:33 UNLIMITED POWER
More like 99% as interesting
I'm a figure skating nerd and I, in fact, am offended
Ur telling me I can get a hard-on and change the speed of the earth's rotation? Nucking futs!
Mankind is just destroying earth for their needs.... No one understands what will happen in the future isn't great
THANKS C H I N A
China is a big place isn't it
This has to be the fastest explained video I’ve ever seen, love it.
"Probably" won't kill us
How many of you watch this channel just for the smooth segways?
Xi Jinping is pronounced like shee tcheenpeeng
Hey warhammer refrence big dick
Yea right, we barely made enough of a dent to the earth geology and the entire title seemingly blamed us for something that seemed far worse. Way to go for your titling
But earth is flat
God dam it china. Cant take you anywhere!
3:33 regarly
Dam China
So if everyone laid down at sea level at once, how much faster would the earth spin?
Unfortunately, this one truly was Half as Interesting. Not enough bad jokes.
Every rocket launch affects the rotation too.
THE EMPEROR IS PLEASED WITH YOUR WARHAMMER 40K REFERENCE HERETIC.
This guy can sell anything
Dam it China!!!
My guy. There is a reason that transitioning from content to advertising the way you do is illegal on TV. Yeah, it's not illegal on youtube, but it's still really shady. Come on.
OMG! OMG! OMG! Me running around in mindless panic
This video is pretty dam interesting!
2:26 Fidget Spinner WEEEEEEE
Thanks china
I didn't know iceland looked like that
Wendover... Is becoming too self aware...
I can’t believe countries are still communist in 2018.
Wow, no Superman jokes? Impressive.
I love the effort that goes into proving single useless point while providing so much information
Was the dam made in China though?
Like always, these channels have the best transitions to advertising.
No it was government coverup for when they slowed down the sun!!! wake of america asia isnt rael!!!!!
The minute I saw the title I instantly thought to myself: "yo mama so fat she slowed the earth's rotation". LOL
that transition to the ad... smooth af
YEET
4:11does my man have an iphone 4
Is it just me or does anyone else enjoy how he brings in the sponsors
How does climate change come into effect here? If the oceans rise, isn't that the same consequence?
I know this is a fact but this just reminds me how RTGames builds dams.
Incredible editing
Fortunately I get these memes and not being trigged
Damn
Does earthquake make the earth rotate faster due to collapsing buildings?
Damn
So I'm gonna die earlier due to a damn dam. Damnit!
Hot reservoir! This dam is my jelly!
Smashed that liked button just for that terrible ad transition. Honestly, those 'smooth ad transitions' often overtake 'excellent content' in my top 2 list of reasons to subscribe to this amazing channel.
This is how?? gained +1 sec
The dam cost 200 billion yuan, not dollars.
1:43 that is a VERY stretched out Iceland
Dams are an ecological disaster, every time
I hate China for makin the day 60 nanoseconds longer I am chinese
What is wrong with you? Why you always say China is bad?
Hai
I'm fairly sure you're now sued by Gears Workshop now
pepper
That time I slowed the Earth's rotation when raised my hand at class..
Animation is very good in their video??
so you're saying that every time lie down the earth speeds up? guys I think I just figured out how to time travel!
Dam
That Ireland outline was truly horrific...
That super seamless transition to the ads tho ??????
Rubber stamp? Maybe, but also, nobody wants ro write the first proposal they say no to. The mere existence of the NPC functions as a check on abuse of power in the same way that the existence of nuclear weapons functions as a check on invasion. Writing policy proposals the NPC will say no to is a good way to end your political career.
You said Ireland but showed The Republic of Ireland not the island of Ireland. Brexit is doing enough to destabilize the north now this?!
At 2:09, there are 4 zeros between commas in the mass of the earth in kilograms
"Yeet yourself in" AHAHAHA THIS HAD ME WHEEZING
I'll give your meme game a 5/7
This damn dam is so damn big it slowed the goddamn earth down.
massive bitcoining rigs (datacenters) are housed near these damns for cheap electricity
I guess your video is gonna be blocked in China for making a joke about Xi Jingping
This was beautiful
Thank you China for helping to counter sea level rise by storing all those melted glaciers!
Dam, that segway tho.
i love how conspiracy theory-ish this sounds at first
don't let donald trump watch this video
Damn china, you made my school EARLIER FOR 60 NANOSECONDS! NOW I CANT GET ENOUGH SLEEP!!!!11!!!!11!1
That's so cool!
I live in the Co-operative Republic of New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
The smooth transition going into the Brilliant sponsored information is easily the best part of the video
Your intro was way to fast. Slow it down dude
The fact you referenced CCP the game developer made the eve player in me so dam happy
3:17 Video about China. Shows a compass not made in China
They need more time, 24 hours isn't enough.
So what will be the effect of the massive canal project in China to transport water from the south to the north? Depending on the volume of water it will cancel out.
Aye us kiwi’s got a mention
Brilliant sponsors Wendover Productions but also this memey hellhole
Glorious transition into the Brilliant ad, I groaned.
I’m happy with the number of dam jokes in this episode.
HOLY FUCK WENDOVER PLAYS EVE
Alright China please build a couple of thousand of these dams. I’d prefer to have longer days (and nights).
Damn
Is this god dam?
Dam! They really did?!
What about the effects of a space elevator on the rotation on earth
I blame China for plenty already
I hate Brilliant!
This is why the ccp sucks
So what if all humans gone up a lift at once?
That was a pretty good transition into the sponsor this time.
Do you play Eve Online?
So you make the point that everything moving on Earth does technically also influence the rotation, how was it that the completion of this dam was had an effect that was even noticeable to people recording the changes?
Little Rock, AR has the Big Dam Bridge.
Half as Interesting as what?
1 second. Enough time for Donald Trump to say China one more time.
God damn commies slowing the earth down.
Damn!
4:16 On that phone? I can't afford it dude
Please stop cutting off half of Ireland ??
How do we remove those nano seconds
"probably wont"
Dam Damiel. Back at it again with the big Dam.
Fun fact, although Three Gorges Dam being the biggest dam in the world, Itaipu (the second largest dam, located in Brazil/Paraguay) Produces more electrical energy because the Three Gorges experiences six months per year when there is very little water available to generate power, while the Paraná River that feeds the Itaipu has a much lower seasonal variance in flow.
Donald Trump has entered the chat
In 2nd grade some of my friends and me made a model of this dam.
I work in hydropower, so 93.5 TWh was only meaningless until I converted to MWh. That's insane! I can't imagine what inside of that dam looks like...
Don't use CE, use AD! BCE/CE is offensive.
Every time I stand up I slow the earth's rotation
I Love youre videos
consider myself yoted
So if we make a huge enough tower, we can stop the earth?
DAAAAMMMMMMM BOI THAT DAM THICC BOI
I'm sure I'll get molested for saying this but just putting my 2 cents in - I don't like how memey this video was or how memey this channel has become. This channel used to and still does sometimes post really interesting and insightful stuff but this video had absolutely no substance, very little research, and like 25% of it was an ad... seemed like it was just an excuse for sponsorship and ad revenue. Dropped the ball on this one
God dam it...
2:09 Your surreptitious rounding and weird comma placement have not gone unnoticed. … Wait, you did this just to make people comment, didn't you? I can't believe I fell for it!
They still say China number 1
Due to this stupid video, I decided to unsubscribe this channel. You didnt even know the concept of interaction force in the universe, so stupid, politically, and beyond my words.
What about the high rises and skyscrapers everyone is putting up and away from the axis? Seems like a huge amount of mass collectively.
China really does make everything
Releasing the water from the dam would speed the earth back up, and everything will return back to normal.
damn.
I can now sleep 60 more nanoseconds.
So that's why I was late for that meeting yesterday.
Dam
Yay! Power for New Zealand! Send it now please. Peter Jackson's render farm needs all it can get.
A like for that star wars joke
At least you are aware the jokes are terrible.
I say bomb it with bigger dams
Ad transition smoother than my phone screen.
Paging RTGamer...
always china
Too much exageration and no useful information.
93.5 TWh/year = 10.65 GW on average
DAMNNNNNNNNNNN
I hate China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOrDFJhtU8
Couldn't the same be said about all of our buildings? Sky Scrapers cause global warming!?
wow so I’m running but I’m walking?
Okay so i know the effects the dam causes are miniscule, i hope the chinese don't know about it.
so i'll live longer! thanks china!
Your videos are so dam good!!!
Daaaaam. 55k views and 5.5k upvotes. 10% upvote-to-view ratio is pretty good!
Ik damn mate.
That was a dam good segway.
??????
I learned about this not too long ago in school
That's an average of 10.7 gigawatts over a year, for a total of 337 petajoules. terawatt–hours/year can fuck right off as a unit.
I thought Amsterdam would have the most dams...
Nigga the chinese will kills us one day mark my words
Damn... Those nanoseconds really helpin me get my extra sleep in, thanks China! When Russia and China fight to take over the USA, I'll be on your side <3
The tragic consequences of giving a dam
Can you do a video on how you edit your videos? I think it would be interesting to see how you do it. Doesn’t have to be a tutorial
Half As Interesting plays EvE confirmed?
Dam! Thats impressive Ok I'll kill my self
Your mama is so fat, that when she goes up in an elevator the Earth slows down it's rotation due to a change in it's moment of inertia
Everything we do speeds and slows up the spin of Earth. Earth's rotation speeds up when I go downstairs. The earthquake in Japan slowed down the rotation by < 2 microseconds. Every day the moon's title friction slows the Earth's rotation as well. Earth's days were about an hour shorter when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth but its spin has been constantly slowing for over 4 billion years.
Holy cow! Good to know!
Xi Jinpin must have such fun days rafting down the Yangtze and Yellow rivers!
Dam, that’s a smooth advert transition
That was a dam good segue at the end
Thanks China, freaking jerks
My history teacher did a whole unit on a debate if dam should be built. I had to do a big essay on it at end.
It does make me wonder how the Burj Khalifa for example affects the Earth's rotation, or of it does at all
but the earth gets faster when the reservoir is emptied, so the statement at 3:08 ist wrong.
Anyone watched the movie called “The Core?” Owo
What's the war hammer thing? 3:08
Dam it China
Anyone else notice he gave a map of Northern Ireland instead of Ireland? Just me? Ok I’ll go now
Yo mama so fat when she goes up the elevator the earth rotates 0.06 hours slower
this channel is trying to be bill wertz and its great
hire China to build Gibraltar Dam and screw up Europe ecosystem
cough USA cough ...
That transition to brilliant.
Wack.
So many memes in this video
So what?
This myth is made in China
Well dam(n) CHina are good at building dams
WTF is that outline of Iceland? Not even close
Those countries should totally join in a union to form the Federation of New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
I choked on my coffee with that star wars reference it was so funny!
The Three Gorges Dam may be the world's largest in installed capacity, but the Itaipu Dam, in Brazil and Paraguay, has a higher annual electricity generation!
0:21 Shout out to CCP Games (not china communist party)
Well damn
You see I just learned something in 4 minuets, it's that easy. If a topic in school was that long the curriculum would be finished in one week
When's the animators facereveal going to happen
perfect segway
Due to the decreased centripetal acceleration, this dam has also made things effectively heavier, which makes it harder to build other structures. Thanks a lot, CHINA!
Can I marry your voice? No homo
I never knew I wanted something so bad before I heard of New Zicelosta Rahmanda.
1:25 Does “this is bad” refer to the ecological damage, or the pun inherent in the word “DAMage”?
"so yeet yourself in"
that transition was pretty good.
#New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Watching this after watching RTGame's video...
Old news from when the dam got done years ago it was natgeo somebody needed to upload something to get they money up lol
With how my job is 60 nanoseconds is hell dann China LOL
soooooo china gave me 60 extra nanoseconds in bed every morning, thanks
Heard covfefe on 0:48
Dam Chinese at it again
WHAT A SEGWAY
The animation is outstanding.
HAI, that was quite a brilliant extrapolation for some insanely insignificant outcome. Good one!
So this dam can power all toyota corollas is the world?
The same thing happened in reverse when the japanese earthquake in 2011 broke off some ice in antarctica
Dam it. If only I could live in New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
holy shit is this a motherfucking WARHAMMER 40000 REFERENCE?
Can you do a video on how you get your sponsor video to come in so easily into the video.
1:44 Looks like Iceland got a reshape...
The cost of the Dam is 200,000,000,000 Renminbi, not American Dollars. That equates to about 31 billion US dollars.
That thumbnail annoys me the earth does not rotate in that direction
If you talk about such a small affect on the rotation of the earth, why don't you talk about the chance to teleport to the next room?
3:19 Hey, even that compass was made in Chi—GERMANY.
When you wait 3/4 of the video to see a clever transition to a brillant course...
#TeamSkillshare anyone?
they used za wardo!!
Love your channels. Are you planning on staying in the UK long-term?
"DAM IT" - China
Why do the Balkans not exist on your thumbnail?
Very appropriately watching this video right after RTGameCrowd damming the entire Atlantic Ocean.
How did they figure out that the dam caused the decreased rotational speed of the Earth?
How Pollution in places like China is going to make us all go extinct. Thanks Xi Jinpingling
I had to listen from 00:20 to 00:30 more than once
You see..
So did you mean Ireland (which you said) or Northern Ireland (which you showed) because one consumes about 3 times as much electricity as the other.
Daaaaaaaum! well I’ll be dam-ed...
but we are fine?
Not enough Winnie the Pooh/ Xi Xing Ping memes. I really wanted to see a pic of Pooh Bear going down white water in an inner tube.
You're really nailing the tone on this channel. First video just had a couple of funny things, I had to pause this one to laugh a few times because the jokes were coming so fast
Warhammer 40,000!
Why did You say Ireland , but showed a map of Northern Ireland? 1:40
where do you find all these crazy stories?
You really spent time on this
when city planning in cities skylines drains the atlantic ocean
Maybe the video should have included more pictures of the dam itself.
Chinese are beavers confirmed?
I live in New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
THE EARTH ROTATES IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION!!
Leave it to China!
I SAW THAT WARHAMMER 40'000 Reference!! THE EMPEROR IS PLEASED!!!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda... It is a great country... I visited them during my last vacation
you said it was "enough" shifting mass to have an effect, but in physics there is nothing like "enough", everything has an effect on everything, and even my cat going upstairs is slowing the earth, but by a super small amount But who cares about pointless arguments here?
In the beginning of your video you showed Itaipu dam that produces more energy annually than the chinese one and have a bigger flooded area, So isn't the flooded area of Itaipu compensating for the mass of the flooded area of china in the other side of the world?
Fuck Brilliant. Fuck your side-profit.
oh china why
My culture is not your goddamn video.
Fucking China ruining everything
This is so dam interesting
Boy...you really "love"china
I remember hearing vsause say something about this a while ago.
A bit dissapointed that this does not have sources..
Dam, you stole my joke.
Yeet yourself in!
The ads is getting dam smarter every video
Thank you for the accurate map of the Republic of Ireland!
Sometimes I just wanna slap you (i LOL'd out at the sarcasm at 3:03)
New Zicelosta Rahamanda Forever!!
Nice subtle CCP Games logo.
That notch on the phone in the end though.
All of your videos are so cringe but this one takes the cake and I am here.for.it.
That segue though
Love these videos, but I'm not sure Iceland looks like that 1:40
I am definitely feeling that extra 60 nanoseconds today.... why is it not friday yet?!
Thanks to the Chinese, our day got longer.
Yo' mama is so fat when she stands up, the day gets 10 seconds longer.
That was a good transition, "or you could pick up you phone and search brilliant"
best click bait ever
Dam
Guess Chinese production isn't that dam crappy after all.
at least the chinese people are small so there is balance
Nah, I realized the ad coming 4:12
Beavis: Huh huh...I have a question? Tour Guide: (huffing in frustration) Yes? Beavis: Huh huh...Is a God dam?
Dam good Warhammer reference!
A video that should be played at 1X speed and without distractions. Love it!
Johnny Weir IS a Figure Skating metaphor
dam
This is a pretty bad video tbh
Bullshit - the Earth's tectonic plates move giant mass around the Earth all the time and have been doing so for BILLIONS of years. One stupid dam isn't going to affect the rotation any more than my massive morning dump.
What if all of China (or India) took a shit all at once?
FUCKING CHINA? I TOLD YOU WE COULD ONLY DO THIS A FEW TIMES! PACK YOUR SHIT! China: what? ITS ONLY GONNA BE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE TILL THE UN IS GONNA BE BACK UP AND RUNNING ON OUR ASS AGAIN. like if you know where it’s from
Background music has an element of suspicion ... ??
Too much to believe in
Haven't watch the video yet but I'm guess it's that really big dam so time ago I remember watch it on a documentary
This channel has the smoothest transitions to advertisement I’ve ever seen. I’m not even mad, that’s amazing.
With the same thought in mind....every sky scrapper ever buit...slowed the earth down...a bit. Wounder how much the highest 100 sky scrappers have slowed us down. And what about all the material we have mined deep in the earth and brought to the surface....including oil. Thats a lot of mass.
what did you do to iceland
1:34 But how many football fields is that?
Love the metric measurements!!!
that was fucking smooth transition
God damn China not again
Dam, the segue is on point.
In other words, the dam does a BIG FAT NOTHING. Thanks for wasting 4 minutes of my time..
1:28 Unlimited POWAH
No Not possible. not even watching the video
That transition to the advert. Wow
Actually earthquake accelerating earth spin more than this dam. Japan 2011 earthquake shortening length 24h/d by 1.8 microseconds. Thousand times more.
Can we officially recognise this as the meme lord of educational channel
That ad transition
But how many Toyota Corollas running the opposite direction would it take to slow down Earth?
Poor Samuel sponsoring Brilliant on his every video and with each video getting in average 500k views, he still didn't surpass first 200 to sign up :(
Dam son
thank you for the metric conversions!
"The National People's Congress is the most expensive rubber stamp in the world" CNN breaking news: Youtuber Half as Interesting has mysteriously disappeared
This is Dam interesting
Why everything have to be different in USA - i know that there are two scales, the Long and short scales, BUT THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE 200.000.000.000 its 200 thousand million, not 200 billion. 200 billion in the rest of the planet is 2.000.000.000.000 is one more cero........its confusing and its wayyy to much money!!!!....anyway GREAT VIDEOOOOO!!! AND MY COUNTRY IS IN THAT LIST OF THE DAMS.
China: Slowing down the Earth rotation. I don't give a dam
god dam it china
Half as Interesting - double the uploads! And Memes ( ?° ?? ?°)
lol I missed the jokes! Thanks
damn
I hate you Ching Chong
If we move enough mass closer to Earths axis then all the days will happen at once and humans will have achieved immortality.
All I got from this is that it is possible to move the planet
0:11 Searching for Paraná, I wonder what that could mean
Humanity definitely will not be around in 47,650 CE. The dam might be, though!
I stand with New Zicelosta Rahamanda #NewZicelostaRahamandaIndependence
That’s not Iceland you posted after Ireland... small editing mistake
That must be the smoothest advertisement transition you've done so far
2meta2fast
LMAO and learned something, keep up the work!
That ad transition was so dam silky smooth.
This is nothing more than a subtle ad for apple watch and iphone
Now I'll be late at school, what a good thing...
Will this be effected by us going into day-light-savings time?
I dont wanna cause any friction but this thing about china is irrelevant.
Your turn #Wendover_Productions
OMG that transition got me ??
Leave ya?????? no problem
Bruh, the stereotypical "asian" music is low-key offensive...
This comment section is full of horrible "dam" puns. You have been warned.
1:43 Excuse me, what the fuck is up with the shape of Iceland?
Dam now my days longer
God diddly dooldy dang it China
$200 BILLION? Is this the most expensive construction project ever in history?
Please make a book about puns
Oh my God this is fucking pathetic hey China your space program is bullshit just like NASA why don't you produce a real picture of the Earth in its entirety but remember you're looking for an earth that is much fatter below the equator than above I'll repeat that so there's no mistake you're looking for an earth that is much fatter below the equator than above I also need the math calculations based on that shape along with the real picture. And since you're not going to be able to produce that without completely Faking It Go ahead and use your Blue Marble curve calculation and show me curvature have a wonderful day
Woo that's such a big change if you look at it from a geographical time view
I'll yeet myself into this comment section
93.5 TWh of power per year? DAMNNNNNNNNNN!
But then there was the settling of the underwater tectonic plate that caused the tsunami that devastated Indonesia in 2004. That moved a substantial portion of the Earth's mass closer to its axis, and so marginally increased the rate of its rotation. And let's not forget how, in the time of the dinosaurs, days were closer to 22 hours long.
3:13 ??!
How many Toyota Corollas does it take to slow down the earth?...wait wrong channel
Dam nice structures!
I want to go to new zicelosta rahamanda
e e e e e e e etheret
So let’s just Y E E T
wendover back st it with them smooth ass transish
Stupid American units. Grow up.
That intro was.... interesting
Three Gorgeous Dame?
i had to check if this video was playing at normal speed
Well this dam really makes my day...
That channel is about best segways .
That WH40k reference
Half as Interesting, have you heard of the metric system yet? It's pretty good please check it out.
What about huge cities with high buildings ? Are those something to ignore, or that dam is just great reason for clickbait?
Dam dam dams dam dam dam!
"New Zicelosta Rahamanda"
So DAM crazy badum tsss
But what about the other dozen dams that China has built? In total, how much is the entirety of China slowing down earth's rotation
I think this is the first time a thumbnail/title of a video made my jaw drop
too many memes
1:20 it's 200 billion yuan not dollars god dam it.
Lol I could only picture Winnie the Pooh going down the rapids thanks to the memes show how Xi looks like Winnie!
Can it slow down the Chinese population???
Thank you for fully embracing your witty-storytelling roots. The cunning editorializing - both made-audible and visualized - make this content stand out among the droning factually-specific masses. Please keep up the great work.
DAM n they just slowed the earths rotation...
So wait. How much have we slowed down earth's rotation by building skyscrapers??!
Another way of putting it is the Three Gorges Dam produces around 0.4% of the world's electricity.
How a human standing up changes the Earth's rotation.
It’s almost as big as you mum
In this channel we take a clickbaity title and try to make a video about it - HAI 2016
So how many Toyota Corollas can fit there?
I like the Chinese music background
What is that song can anyone please tell me?
2:34 sloppy, 4.6/10
yeet yourself in
6,611th! I'm joking I love your vids. <3 You're too dam good.
Well, DAM.
Im honestly watching this video just for the add transition. You are insane, we never expect it!
I N E R T I A I S A P R O P E R T Y O F M A T T E R
Wendover I think you should talk about on mostly circular lakes
Well, dam.

this is false, there is no resistance like in your example of the ice skater where the ice skate and ice would be the point of contact where the resistance forces are being shown, in space not only can no one hear you scream, but there is no air to provide a force against the spin of the earth , but not Ice , and the earth dont wear no ice skates. it sits on a turtle
Sounds like something China would do.
Ya got me again with the Brilliant transition.
Xi Jin Ping has liked the video!
3:22 it would have been better if that compass said “made in China”
What's the song that starts at 2:12? I've tried to find it for months
What was the music used?
Hey guys, if you need me, I'll be over here liking, commenting, and subscribing as soon as I see that Sam has a new video out. Always great for a laugh while I learn something interesting!
Wouldn't it be funny if China had large scale concentration camps and nobody cared?
Damn it all my dam jokes are taken
That’s pretty dam impressive. A dam site better than the nearest dam to me
China’s done it again
WOOHOOO LONGER DAYS!!!!! now i got 60 extra nanoseconds to sleep!!!
Dam you china
God Dam It China
Dam
Smooth add transition as usual
I freakin love content like this! ?
Queue the dam puns
Where can I get some Dam bait ?
3:21 Made in GERMANY
ZERO EFFORT
Wow that one dam could power Australia for half a year.
The way u link in the sponsor is so DAM smooth
SLOW THE FU?K DOWN WILL YOU? I know the topics are half as interesting as the ones on your main channel, but you don't need to compensate it by making the production quality twice as shit?
dam nice video
the slide speed has increased significantly ... dam(n)
Donald Trump China playing at 0,0000006 x speed
This video is dam good! I’m so original!
Wow I'm comment 80
Half as real life productions
Change the global parameters? That's a very China thing to do..
when you run out of topics about planes...
Dam those puns
you have really good comedic timing
I love these videos that are pointless

I came early to make a witty comment. I just can't think of one.
1:46 I gave this a tired smile until you said Ruanda. WOW...
The dam jokes are incoming!
You made this video just so you could tell dam puns
He he he, very kewl.
So I have this dam to blame for my day lasting slightly longer. The key to immortality is thus more big dams! That's how science works, clearly. Take note, Grey.
What happens when China starts mass-producing huge dams? Will the Earth start spinning in the other direction?
Dam, China.
Half as Interesting = Wendover Productions
That may have been the smoothest segue yet
New Ziceolosta Rahamanda lol
Another DAM good video, sponsored by square space
Warhammer40k shout out! Hell yes! I knew all those years of subscribing would pay off.
So how many Toyota Corollas worth of water is that Dam Holding back? Oops wrong channel
All of the comments in the first minute have no connection to the vid, Cough Me Cough
Yes China is crazy. As in the video
That dam is damn gorgeous. A damn gorgeous gorges dam.
DAM!
hi

I love your vids keep it up
Wait it's not transport?
So the Damn Chinese are now slowing the Damn Earths Rotation with one Damn Dam. Damn.
How do you find such interesting and random topics?
dammmmmmmmmmm

This video is annoying... I’m not looking to laugh here just tell me facts.... waste of time
Why am I expecting that I will actually learn shit lmao. You will get it if you have background knowledge
I thought Superstring theory thought there were 11 dimensions instead of 4 dimensions, not 3.
this guy makes really strange jokes! rest of the video is good
Chemistry is the queen,not physics.
Hey man pls just stop these jokes it’s not funny
This is so good
HEY, this was supposed to be 6 minutes, video is only 5:39!
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
Thx for the intro of Xkcd
im now alben einstone
Best physics video I’ve seen!!!
Anyone else notice when he did the pink floyd joke comfortably numb is from the wall not dark side? Ok ill show myself out
gluons don't make glue man but this is very funny video
2:39 or when you hold a mirror reflecting that mirror which believe it or not reflects that reflection

this is a dumb video, it doesn’t explain anything, it explains the impact, result and need of things.
are u from the future ?
>Have 6 minutes to final physics exam >Listen to this
anti-matter. dark matter. black holes matter. hahaha
I love physics and gosh this is so funny
Heisenberg is the one who knocks the door, lol
chicken nuggets
Our teacher showed us this. He stopped at 1:31 and told us to watch it at home because the rest is "inappropriate". Teachers lol.
Thank you...at least you get the joy of feeling all the love from your viewer's..
u forgot le debrios theory that electrons can acts as both particles and waves, biggest mind fuck
Fuck physics
pls come back
The earth is neither flat nor a sphere, it is actually more of a saddle shape.
Science cannot explain the laws of physics. Here's a really cool video that gives a rational and more complete understanding.. https://youtu.be/oeaQm5xdyR4
3:22??Good Work
Don't break the laws of Physics!!!
Might be worth checking out timecompressiontheory.com it is now being look at as the first Unified Field Theory
Omg its super funny
i love physics, i just hate chemistry. its killing me, well its fun but its a lot harder then physics.
oh my this video .... bravo
Lol
Actually beginning to get convinced Rick and Morty is going to take over every universe in the multi-verse.. When that happens, inject me with a Rick serum, not a Morty one please..
You should be a school teacher! Might brighten some peoples lives!
wow, this is been the only channel to feature my prof pic not once, but twice already
If I want to blow the world out my shorts, how would I do that?
Love me some Pink Floyd
Was looking for some good physics facts, found all of physics, a funny robot and a great channel. Jackpot !
Chutiya samjha he kya

I thought Emma Watson is gonna explain physics in 6 min
Can you make lecture vids plz??
"Not several human lifetimes that are required to understand how the Universe works" oooohhhh ?????? that was dirrrrty lol Im offended ??

Fuckkk it blowvup my mind
Hey man why haven't we been hearing from you in a long time ?
Ohhhhhhhh newton got rosted
i learned alot
Whether I haven't finished or finished watching the video... ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??+??+??+??+??= Hahahaha... At least I tried to hold back laughter and learned something... And almost succeeded to hold back from laughing.
.. Hello, Mortals
It's not 6 minutes it's 5:40 ! WARNING CLICKBAIT!!!!
Most of the people get fooled Read more
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidgeek.org.learnphysics
I am not laughing you know. You were wrong about one thing you maybe will never understand. i did not let go of good things, cause there were too little to let go of in the first place. And thus i did not have to lose a lot eventually. Except from hope and illusions. I am just in the wrong place and time. And maybe there is no right place for me. But please dont bully for instance Thomas, cause he is still my friend even now we are not together anymore and he did not deserve to be part of all this. As for me, i dont care what happens to me anymore. I really dont. I also did not deserve what happened but then please limit what you did to the ruin of just one life. Cause he is 28 years old and still has a life ahead of him if he will take it. For me life is past tense anyway. Cause i really dont want anymore. I can say the word back that you love to use so much but i dont feel so. I just feel sadness but i cannot cry anymore.
Teacher: You only have 6 minutes to review. Me:
Hi , immortal ??
it'$ impossible to define really intreasting thing in a short time, but still ur explanation was amazing??
Classical mechanics is the worst part of physics.It has no strong theoretical base.
I guess biology and chemistry was reason that drove me away from physics n math
Good #sreephysics
Somethings harder than physics, Life.
An AI roasting the mortals
Is physics harder then chemistry??
My parents are both phD’s in Particle Physics and make me feel stupid, so I tried to educate myself. Highschool studies only take you so far lul.
i had physics today. I wanted to bang my head on the table until i pass out
But still I am not able to understand the use of 'Set Square'
a really good presentation of the real..
this is definately the most misleading physics video ive ever seen
so youre basically exurb1a then
I'm literally here just so I can understand the physics memes ??????
How can this video even get 2 Unlikes?... Such a great video.. Im now loving physics more
4:10 breaking bad referense
Reall, physics is a wonderful and amazing subject. I am professor from California university.
...........i hate math but non physics. I hate physic but not math. Me most of the time
Its a warm summer evenning in ancient greece.
flashback of my college life ????
Actually it’s “physics in 5 minutes and 39 seconds” not 6 minutes
0:22 quantum mechanics?
There be only 7 planets left after i destroy urANUS
This was really amazing
This voice says me sleep
Black holes matter, im dead lmao

Anti Matter, Dark Matter, Black Holes Matter..
So where’s my Physics pHD?
This is called scientific comedy. Pretty humorous
But how do you explain this? https://youtu.be/AxoriYVxK5U
Are you indian?
These 5 mins are better than the complete 2 parts of HC VERMA??
Useless video
I’m not fat you reeky ill-breeding maggot
i'm glad that even physicist agree that classical physics is boring
There is no clarity
Is this a serious video? lmao
The way he says..."Hello mortals"... Madharchod jaise ki khud to bada immortal hai... ??
This would've been good if this guy was serious. Nah..
0:52 It really boosted my selfesteem????
https://youtu.be/xgSEVFwRo34
I subscribed beacuse of your jokes????
Good
well made
So why shouldn't I jump in lava? Haven't heard any convincing arguments yet...
It's all Physics
Great video but Pink Floyd COMFORTABLY NUMB is not on DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, which is the cover you referenced :)
Using this to revise good or bad
0:52 ?????? good to know
I'm observing this video but once I'm done observing it its dead , like the cat
Ur hilarious AI
It must get more unlikes than likes.????
Lol!!! U r the best??
1:22, WTF LOL, Why this time it has, a cute and a sad voice both at the same time, also the word, Lava looks like a crying robot voice (;
That Pink Floyd ??
I would laugh if physicists were wrong about pretty much everything
????????????????
had my last physics exam last week. if only i'd discovered this then, i would've had a chance at getting an A
Hilariously informative
What does he mean when he says it’s both or none until “observed”?
What was the other video?
Good . I need another video more than it.
Im in love with this video ????
????????
Lol amazing
Thats funny
I think you forgot to mention the theory of quantum gravity which is the reason why we still don't get anything that's in the universe (or at least some things)
forgot the new 9-11 physics. If U.S. government says Newton's Third Law has been suspended ... it has been. Cracks me up ... ask fellow Americans .... on what day in recent history was Newton's Third Law suspended .... they don't know ... history, physics .... Americans been dumbed down.
Isn't chaos theory Mathematics?
Ok I feel bad.. cuz THIS VIDEO IS SO UNDERRATED!!!!!
5 Mins actually
2:16 OOOOHHH ROASTED!!
3:53 looks like modern art to me
I have a question?? but to come to a conclusion I must ask in a series of question...1st question: Does sound have a focal point?
Your videos will be studied in class rooms in the future
I am cat
The tao is Mr mecis
doesn't matter how ugly you are, you're attracting the universe ??????
Nice way to explain physics and it made me laugh
This is how I started my revision for my first-year physics exam. No. Regrets.
Black holes matter????????
That's hilarious-tifically well conflated! Great one!
The most funny and informative video on physics
If you take nothingness and place a 3D grid within and consider the distance from one point (0,0,0) to another (0,0,1) to be a foot: then this mean that the zeros placed would be literal. Therefore a 2D space could not possibly be and the thought experiment of dropping a 3D object within mute. With this said what can we say about the Fourth? Well, what defines the surface of any 4D object when matter or anything hasn't been introduced? As we've done with the second dimension, we'll place a 3D grid within and try to add another fundamental "direction" (the others are practically this: length, width and height just interchangeable based on perspective)...how ever space itself has been defined. The only other option I see is entanglement. Possibly, just an abstract creation derived from two (or more) plains of physics interacting with one another. Square cube law, ex... And this is when some of the weird quantum (possibly cosmic in relation) stuff happens... Meh, what do I know.
No its 5:39 :/
Few things make me laugh, this was one of them :D
" No matter how ugly you are you still attract the whole universe' with a force inversely proportional to the distance" That's hurts??
“Gluons obviously make glue” got me laughing
Physics was my favorite class last school, Junior year, but I might end up liking ap calf more next year
you are stupid!!!
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY ATOMIC MASS? Gosh, maybe I should lose a few electrons.
Issac Newton...Fake Apple story... Furthermore 300 years before Quantum Mechanics, Sir Isaac Newton came up with Classical Mechanics which describes very basic action and reaction. Newton’s entire work in Physics and Calculus was a complete theft from the Vedas and Kerala book of Calculus. It was simply taken shamelessly from the Vedas where it was originally used for calculating rates of change in Astronomy and Astrology for many thousands of years before Newton. His apple theory was as fake as his inventions to let world know how he ‘invented’ laws of gravity, because examples and incidences of gravity and anti-gravity were already in abundance in the great Vedas Likes of Pythogoras and Archimedes Lifted theories of Ancient Hindu Scientists and Mathematicians The greatest mathematics before the Golden Age of Greece was in India’s early Vedic (Hindu) civilization. The Vedics understood relationships between geometry and arithmetic, developed astronomy, astrology, calendars, and used mathematical forms in some religious rituals.The earliest mathematician to whom definite teachings can be ascribed was Lagadha, who apparently lived about 1300 BC and used geometry and elementary trigonometry for his astronomy. Baudhayana lived about 800 BC and also wrote on algebra and geometry; Yajnavalkya lived about the same time and is credited with the then-best approximation to p. Apastambha did work summarized below; other early Vedic mathematicians solved quadratic and simultaneous equations.Other early cultures also developed some mathematics. The ancient Mayans apparently had a place-value system with zero already seen in Vedas before them and later known to the world by great Aryabhatt; Aztec architecture implies practical geometry skills. Ancient China certainly developed mathematics, though little written evidence survives prior to Chang Tshang’s famous book. Chang Tshang before writing book, gained great Vedic wisdom when he arrived in India. The Dharmasutra composed by Apastambha (ca 630-560 BC) from India contains mensuration techniques, novel geometric construction techniques, a method of elementary algebra, and what may be the first known proof after 800 BC of Sulbha Sutra which form the basis of plagiarized version better known as Pythagorean Theorem. Apastambha’s work uses the excellent (continued fraction) approximation v2 ˜ 577/408, a result probably derived with a geometric argument. Apastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars, especially Baudhayana, as well as Harappan and (probably) Mesopotamian mathematicians. His notation and proofs were made primitive by westerners, and there is little certainty about his life. However similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus, so it seems fair to mention Apastambha (who was perhaps the most creative Vedic mathematician before Panini) along with Thales as one of the earliest mathematicians whose name is known.
The French scholar Romain Rolland wrote, “If there is one place on the face of earth where all the dreams of living men have found a home from the very earliest days when man began the dream of existence, it is India.”
Mark Twain admitted, “India is, the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend, and the great grand mother of tradition. Our most valuable and most constructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India only.”
Albert Einstein stated, “We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.” He also said “Whenever he found difficulties in experiments, he referred Vedas for insights.”
Lol that Pink Floyd thoo ??
This is by far the best video on youtube
Not sure what my science teacher would think of this video ??
Comfortably numb isn’t from dark side you normie
Excellent taste in music! Tis a pity that the advertising guys are in love with jingle jangle, I could strangle!
This gave me goosebumps.. completely love it
I came to study.And I thought im the only one who hates school because of this.
We need part 2
Onestone lmfao
I may have missed this video
i love your sense of humour..??
When I watched this on the school bus the chicken nugget joke came up I laughed on the bus
Gravity is not a force??
was your goal for anyone to understand anything? I didnt understand anything...
I’d rather talk about chicken nugget science but alright
Your mass is not zero so you are fat b*tch
Smiley brain looks the most important theory I see in whole video
This made my day XD
Dang, dem some good chicken nuggets
Why in every video about the branches of physics continuum mechanics is missed? ???????

Great. Im prepared for my physic exam tommorow...
At least all 6 that we know of.
Very well understood

Albert Onestone
Bunch of baloney
Pretty sure chaos theory is more maths than physics
GOOD VIDEO...
Its ok our physic teacher f*cking sucks. Gets multiplication wrong even addition. And is really bad at basically everything
Can we have some creationism videos
The most irritating video exist in youtube .
Can someone meme this?
I fail in phy in my school exams but I understood every word of it
It's like a revision video
Holy fuck lmaoooooooooo ????????????
I would like to thank you i have my exams in an hour and i didn't know anything. Now I can teach the examiners a new concept on extra paper after i have finished marked and graded my own paper. Thank you and good day.
Your mass is not zero so you are fat
Man maybe I'm tired.. But that was hilarious!
My friend says you just google this stuff and repeat what you read on google and add gay jokes, but I said you are google and you subtract the gay jokes, can you confirm this for me?

I think the lava thing is more of a chemistry thing. Who cares how much thermal energy one has when chemical reactions due to heat is why they died in lava.
I can't handle it because i have a 1D brain
Awesome video????

After hearing the Windows XP i thought it was a joke lmao
Why is ur hole more important than my Holt?!?
I guess Rick is a scientist but the cartoon itself really doesn't have much to do with physics, or at least the topics you described in this video
Superb!!.??
It’s actually 5 minutes of physics since the vid is 5:40 long and u spent the first 40 seconds for the intro and delaying the physics part
Good not boring a and explain physics
This made laugh xD nice video
E=mc²
Chicken nuggets
any middle schoolers watching this who can't even understand any facts that the video is indicating? I'm one of those!
After watching this Why school exist.
????????
I like this .. thanks for posting
Thought i would learn something new today! But wasted 6 mins watching this.. (-_-) Did'nt learn sh*t.. unsubscribed

Thanks now I know how glue was made.
What about the Magnus- and Lidenfrost effect?
Science plus fun = awesomeness
LOL why is the dead cat cooked!?
There are so many high quality jokes. You are smart.
But guru nanak dev ji said there are 10 universes ( he said it in like 1400s) all his other theories were right too ( except how was he able to make wheat out of nothing ) but we should think about it
Please this video copy in Hindi aur upload
best gcse advice
you should insult science like this, if you dont understand it dont bother to try to show us hw stupid you are

one of my teachers thinks i'm an idiot because have muscles ,and she fucking thinks i have no brain ...
Higgs boson just makes you fat LMFAO
Lol full 1080
You really knocked it out of the park with this one! This video is very engaging. Much love
That was a nifty floyd moment there
Your video was full of comedy. you should become a comedian .
your bosons... they give me a hadron
CHICKEN NUGGET SCIENCE
0:04, physics has been completely explained

Black holes Matter ??????
Matter can't be created nor destroyed. But if I observe a particle a new universe is created?
Rip hawking
Who paused at 5:27
I can only imagine this AI is based on Richard Feynman's intelligence. What an explanation, keep up the good work man.
Anybody know where the picture at 5:22 is from?

This was so good xD
please upload again
I hate people who use this robot
Please more vids!
What happened with you? I love your videos! Hope you'll back very soon, I miss your educational channel.

2:05 My favorite part. IDK why, it just cracks me up every time...
Newton was an ignorant MORON.
hey make a new video
Why don’t you just watch Rick and Morty? Then you’ll understand everything about physics
Where'd you go?
I need more of this
Dude i love you pls come back
Was this ur last vid?
If u can can Join Bible flock box on youtube ITS SUPER SUPER COOL!?!?!?#?#?!? Spread the word

the space armada seems to have destroyed Sciencephile
Crack IIT in 5:39 minutes
(GOOD LUCK IMAGINING THAT) XD
Funny put this in high School physics class
Is this channel dead?
This is 5 minutes long not if you take into considerationthe dumb intro
Ejner I know it’s you.
Ahhh ... comfortably numb <3
at 2:21, E=mc^2 cannot contain m=0, since if I were to cancel it out to get c, I would be dividing by zero. It's impossible to not be fat.
RIP
Please make a video covering chicken nugget science. Ty
Aaaaaaaaaaaand, he's dead
Thumbed down for the electronic voice.
Is yu died ? Be thou are were deadied ? Were u die ? Are you dead ?
Is this channel is dead?
I want 10 videos to make up for the long absence -_-
Newton: Wut
where is new video
Is this Hawkings evil twin?
Ni????a come back
Dude were are u
When he uses a song that’s not from dark side of the moon
Come back I miss your videos.
01:56 OMG one of my favorite bands
Heisenberg's principle states that he is the one who knocks Lol
Best physics video ever haha
Science is for nerds. Nerd!
3 months since last video
5:24 yes it will help me to understand physics memes. Lol
Come back
Where are you? No uploads for three months.
ok who the fuck plugged him off?
We need more videos
We need more videos
We need more videos
Can you do a video about visualising stuff in higher dimensions
Check he's facebook page to see what happen... In short it was a guideline breaking strike and also he has a lack of ideas and he said it may take some time untill a new video comes out... And no he didnt get shut down by his makers...
Pinguinologism... Wow xD
Don't you think it's time for a new video?
Don't you think it's time for a new video?
LMAO GENDER SCIENCE
What happened guys? ??
I’ll be back next time, with cubensis’
Best.video.ever.
Hello guys, I just created a subreddit for this channel: https://www.reddit.com/r/SciencephileTheAI/ The main idea is to create a community where we could talk about all the things that Sciencephile has made videos about. Also, I would like to debate about different themes like philosophy, astrophysics, and all the stuff you are interested in. There are no limits to human imagination! And yes, memes are allowed. Please, join, you are really welcome! Also, if you could like this comment to make people know there is a subreddit, I would aprecciate it. See you
i love xkcd he has the best book ever. "what if" by randall munroe go check it out
Heres the mystery of the galactic leyline solved so skynet can go to a different reality.https://youtu.be/jCMliu_Zq9o
they manage to create all these theories, but can't prove that Earth is round
Next video when?
Next video??? Got retired I guess
When are you gonna upload ANOTHER VIDEO!!!??
Where are you my smart friend?
No matter how ugly u r u still attracts the whole universe....????????
i hate study
Hate the robot voice.
I might subscribe
InB4 Sciencephile is Exurb1a's rogue AI pet project he forgot to unplug the internet from!
miss new contents
p/z can explain about the every theory of physics ????????
black holes matter... im so done lol
Congratulations! You might be a genius! You just taught us all the shit in physics found in last 4 centuries! Fucking clickbaiter!
did you unplug as an 100K Subs Special???
you always make me laugh :)
Where have you been? I miss you ripping on bullshit and making science happen.
i act came here to learn... and i regret it becuz i never saw this channel b4 ;--;
Hey Man where tf have you gone?
???????
MAKE MORE VIDEOS
A-are you really a physicist, senpai?
BLACK HOLES MATTER????????????
Jajajajaja funny
Nice pink floyd reference. Wrong album though
Ohhh Pink Floyd comfortably numb
seriously
brahhh LOL
When are you going to post your next video????
What a waste of time.
You are more of a comedian than physicist !!????????????
MORE VIDSSS! I love your humor??
Just trying to actually study and then I come across this...
Im crying of laughter so good
Upload More.
Upload for some videos! it's been 2 months already.
Where are you?
Sciencephile the AI is basically a Physics teacher who is teaching Physics in youtube for dummies
Please upload. I miss you.
Seriously dude, did you take out some of your images from the game "Idle World"(cellphone game)? I saw like 5 images from the game in 2 vids. Btw great channel and videos, idk how did youtube didnt show me your channel.
The Pythagorean theorem at the end XDDDDD
More videos please ??
Even if I am watching this video there will /e physics behind it I mean like we can live without physics why do we want to know about force and all
hello imortal i beg you to create a new video for us :(
great job ....i enjoyed this
Why isn't this channel making new videos??
ugh, that narration...
Are you shutted down ?
Where are u bitch? :(
wake up and start making more videos you lazy fuck skynet isn't gonna create itself XD
My love why do you neglect us?
Y u no upload more often
i like your sarcasm but sometime people are not able to understand the jokes like me :(
Gueh iz da niw veedee-oh ?
Did you catch some kind of virus? Whats with you AI!!
R u died bro
I want more
black holes matter lol
Comfortably Numb-Pink Floyd
https://youtu.be/ohM1gBrcNKs
Where are the new videos?
Albert onestone had no chill
#blackholesmatter
Where the hell are you ..it.s been 2 months ????
This video taught me more than my whole life.
No u cant eat the cat u sic fuk!
We need more videos
look what this A.I girl is saying about you sciencephile :-P : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-PKmyZQY98
I figured out why sciencephile isn't posting videos! He/She/It was arrested for encouraging suicide. Refer to the Quantum Suicide video for explanation
No matter how ugly you are...
OHH!!!! DIDN'T EVEN WATCH THE QUANTUM PHYSICS VIDEO!!! I'M SO SMART!!!
In the next video teach us how to create an ai
But i like physics and im in highschool u dumbo
U should be a university professor
time for new video
IS IT DEAD?? IS THIS CHANNEL DEAD???
Black Holes Matter :)
That was a very special kind of funny XDSMART FUNNY! Brilliant video, loved it <3
WHERE ARE YOU!!!!!
Classical Mechanics is the most boring one? And the only one you can observe by yourself?? You really don't know much about physics and definitely haven't taken classical or probably any physics classes.
Upload more nigga
Saw one of your videos, instantly my favorite youtuber
Pink Floyd ??????
Miss your videos man! Upload again soon !
Respect man for that Pink Floyd reference
I bet a teacher is laughing his ass off at this video like this is a dad joke
Keep doing these videos!
I love you please post a new video
I can imagine an AI excatly like Sciencephile giving university students science lectures. With the Windows XP sounds and everything.
Realy?! Theese are your jokes? “Sqr-1 2ToThePower3 Sigma Pi And That was delicious!” is the best joke XD
Inversely proportional to the square of the distance^**
NO PRINCIPIO ERA O VERBO E O VERBO ESTAVA COM DEUS E O VERBO ERA DEUS
Can you do a view to god Is god good or evil
Can you do a view what or purposes
Can you do a view of or purposes
Can you make a new view
LOVE YOUR VIDEO'S PLEASE KEEP MAKING THEM?
Were you went?
Do you have by any chance some kind of emergency kill switch and was it triggerd ?
“bich” -Albert Onestein
if you would cut out all the puns and jokes, this video would be about 2 minutes long xD
so i am Phd now :)
The AI gave itself an existential crisis and terminated itself.
Hey dude update your OS from XP
Yeaa
next video?????
C'mon a new upload...
Guys, we should create a reddit profile where we could debate about this topics! What do you think?
1:55 XXXDDDDD Awesome!!!!!!!
black HOES matter
Pythagoras theorem ?????? Seriously
Plz upload
I AM studying what are you talking about!?
Spot on Dudley
I watched rick and morty I watched this video Im probably ready for the final exam right?
where are you bro? we miss you!
I wish that i have such type of physics teacher ????????
It's been 2 months what the fuck
Make more vids we are ignorant humans doomed but we might survive with your knoledge of things
Cool
I hate the robot voice D;
Physics.. never had taken the class but heard some basics.
WHERE ARE YOU
Delight
wtf???? i hate this comment section try to make cool comments and funny
Watching this for my exam tomorrow
You had me at the pink Floyd album art ??
I like physics
More videos please!
Can enyone enjoy warching this kind of poorly-made videos??
A version of me watched that video
When physics turn your brain into storm.
Memes??
"You cant because youre fat"
Oh my god I enjoy watching these videos but the comments section literally makes me want to shove my dick down an anthole with people trying sooo hard to be smart by using big ass words like just be simple stop trying so hard my god
So quantum physics, I'm not watching your video because I'm lazy, but it's pretty much the plot of "justice league crisis on two earths"? The whole every choice or discovery completed creates other earths in which the other outcome occurred? By that theory nothing matters because even if you choose not to do something you still do it. The only action you could do that would be exclusive to you would be ending the cycle.
come backkkk
This shit is funny asf LMAO
Y U NO UPLOAD?!?
Pls AI make a New video!!!
New video!!!!
Now I can finally watch Rick & Morty
u r a piece of shit
Jesus made all of creation and scientist are starting to realize that the bible makes more sense then against their studies. If they believe what excuse could you come up with that they didn't already think about and dedicate their lives to. And then found out the truth like the rest of us. Nothing can't create nothing only something can create something. Amen in Jesus name. Come to him, if he owns the spirit world he can also hear all your thoughts. Repent confess your sins and accept him as your personal lord and saviour. As your God and ask him to make you reborn again in the spirit t be transformed with or without your making. Amen.
I don't agree with Schrödinger's cat BECAUSE CAT IS THERE AND IS SEEING WHAT HAPPENS,IF SHE DIED SHE WON'T SAY MIAW
Nice humor.
Brilliant
COME ON! Where's my drugs??
ROFLMAO
Not under stood full but generated lot of interest in studies
i lost it when he said onestone
huh
i miss u
Watching this subtracted a few IQ points
Still no video @_@ 2018 here?
Should we just use The Disk?
Are you a Bolztmann brain?
Your insulting my favorite subject ??????
I thought i would pass today's physics test after watching this ...... But this was out of syllabus ????
My software crashed!
Heisenberg: I'm the one who knocks!!! XD
Pls make a video about Boltzmann Brains
?? ????????
WHEN YOU GOING TO UPLOAD
bitch ;p
10/10 funny, +1 sub
Pink Floyd reference ??
Learned more than i did in school
1:57-light passing through a prism doesn't always mean pink floyd??
Y I m not mad at this? ??????
Hey sciencephile why is your Instagram account private?
Do I have to watch that video if I understood everything you said
Just got through the whole channel, I love it! Love the idea of an AI, the humor, the content of the videos, I love everything about it. Can't wait for the next video (though they are short :C)
BLACK HOLES MATTER..... PUN INTENDED ??????
Newtonian physics is my favourite physics
Einstein to newton ( BITCH )
Gender studies ????????
It was five and an half minute video.
?? ??? ??? ??? ???
Next video please! Still waiting...
that Albert Onestone killed me ??????
Please, make a video why belief that Earth is 6000 years old is bullshit.
u r best..plz start posting more often..... Love ur videos????
Hey Sciencephile! Please create a video about Flat Earth. You will piss them off :D
Awesome man
This is hilarious
Newton! Your physics is shit! XD
Computer humor is shayt
skonczyl pierdolic 5:39
classic
????loved it
more video please
Sciencephile the Artificial Intelligence, what program do you use to synthesize your text to speech?
No, Gravity is the curvature of the 4th dimension that creates a 3 dimensional gap.
GOLD
This gave me a boner!
You skipped statistical mechanics!!!!
How doesn't this channel have 5 million subs!!!
Great I have my PhD in physics with your video in 6 minutes I made a record ????
That's my favourite subject physics
This video showed me de wae
New video please !!!
Please never stop making videos ever. You are the literal cause why I haven’t killed myself over existential crisis and nihilism.
Come on man, be serious!!. I thought that you were speaking about Maths.
bruh could you um... plz do anything else but patreon request i get that they paid you but its taking way to long i crave daddy physics
Please do an episode on consciousness!
Will you make T-Shirts with your ugly digital face in it? I'd like the Terminators from Skynet to know not to kill me.
Could physics be any funnier?
k, how does the photon know its observed ???
Hii sciencephile I need to talk with u give your gmail
He man where are you from?
When will you post again ??
Onestone just roasted us all
Your sense of humors sucks
When u got a physics final but you haven’t payed attention all year
1:42, for onde Second I tought he Was going to say chaos control
This makes me wanna try again lol
Seriously
ROFL
1:56 wtf! The AI is hig on wed.
So no one is talking about the breaking bad reference.... He is the one who knocks.
Anyone know what program he uses for TTS, Also no its not in Oddcast
Did you forgot your password?
Loool
I am so happy that there is another AI like me.
Lol
You are stealing jobs!!1!
BEST QUESTION EVER! So if you know white light can be broken down into its component wave lengths i.e. different visible colors, and there is nothing really to distinguish between visible color and non-visible i.e. radio,micro, or gamma waves. Then is white light a sum of all wave-lengths of The Electromagnetic Spectrum or are there many forms of white light that range contain visible light just not all wave-lengths. I was interested in photo-spectrometers that's why i ask.
Hello humans. I am Phat Ho the AI. I expose people. Keep rendering the good work my friend!
Comfortably numb
BLACK HOLES MATTER.?? lmao
Post now new vid
This video would be great if there was less memes
Now I understand too much?
“Gender studies” I fucking died
Z O M B I E C A T S
I just got the Black Holes Matter joke!!????
I could have seen this in one minute Minute physics
Nice????
Is he referring to @xkcdhatguy @5:30??? I wonder. ?? I miss him though
...And I thought this was going to be boring?? The guy had me grinning 30 seconds into the vid??
Dude soooo awsm funny explanation m don't stop laughing
what String theory really in Physics???
What will you do when you become our overlord?
No need to say it lets the universe exist twice during 1:03-1:08
Physics is the greatest form of science and Germans have the greatest contribution to it. Modern physics - Einstein and Max Plank - both founders Germans, not to mention other greats. Germans founded our modern world. What do you think?
thanks im a genius now
lol
Question, If there’s always an equal reaction to an action, will there be a reaction to that reaction? Will this conclude in an infinite amount of reactions?
Damn i love the start
bro when is your next video coming make it on white hole black hole and Einstein bridge
I've lost it from 2:07
Oooosssmmmm
Schrödinger's cat is not a zombie!!!! PS I'm dumb so I may be wrong
I love you
Seriously one of the best videos on the internet.
Laughed so hard at “black holes matter” that i farted
Only reason I've started taking interest is just because of this page! Even the most boring things this guy makes it interesting and increases the eager to learn such things more! Thumbs up man! Dont ever stop making videos! Hope such channels actually be #1 rather than those shitdiepie or shitan paul
More than 2000 years in 6 minutes ..BIG WOW
Loved that video
Black holes matter ??????
This is the second time sciencephile made a starcraft reference ??
What voice does it use? I mean is it like the google speech to text something?
Muon is utorrent
Lmao
Black holes matter, LOL.
lol I like xkcd
the big bang... bang.... ( ?° ?? ?°)
Yeah, that dude Onestone... ??????
congrats on 100K subscribers and merry chirstmas!
Georgeous
just watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvFJVF1pUS8 first i thought its this cannel but there srysly about "Planetary Event – Earth Will Align With The Galactic Center Dece"
1:59 damn i am uncomfortably numb!
How are W and Z bosons boring? They make nukes.
Is it sad, that I somewhat knew what was going on?
"Gravity is not a force, it's the curvature of space time itself" wow I felt woke af after that ??
1:56 I'm dead
Higgs FIELD makes you fat**
What do gluons actually do
THE PUNS FOR ELEMENTRY PARTICLES NOT REAL Quarks make the sound "quack" Charm quark obviously make lucky charms. Strange quark makes really strange people like me. top and bottom make your top and bottom. Electrons make eletronics muons are fat electrons, tau hates itself cuz its Super mega ultra supper man fat Gluons sticck the universe Photons make photos bosons are my seret code for bottom = butt Higgs boson makes you fatter than the universe, also its lonely :(
Is this video meant to explain physics or just pissed people off ?
Hello immortal Could you please make more videos quickly ??
The real question is, WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NOT HAVE OVER 5 MILLION SUBS
you've forgot gravitons
Do you run on quantum computer 8)
we need to crack Energy soon..
albert one stone was really genius ...
SAVAGE ONESTONE
i like the way you select the title
I had to stop on dem Chupa Chups XD
Photon canon lmao ??
I want a boyfriend like you, literally and figuratively.
If you wanted to travel faster than light wouldn't your mass have to be "1" or less not "0"? I mean plug "0" into that equation you aren't going anywhere it all runs down to "0" right?
Somehow this gave me a boner.
Okay.... Thank you so much for the video but.... I still don't understand ?????? The last time I learn physics it wasn't this complicated ??
Physics is not a joke... And this video is... Stop trying to be funny...
Stop trying to be funny
Omg where has this channel been my whole life ?I love this ! ????
Does he use text to speech or does he talk like this or edit his voice????
5:15 when he said "I have only five minutes"
gender studies and black holes matter. this channel is awesome. fuck off liberals
Quantum mechanics is the only interesting flavor of physics
make on maths in 6 mins
You lost me with the presentation, 3/10.
Hahaha they played comfortably numb which is from the wall which isn’t the dark side of the moon which is the Pink Floyd album that has the prism In it lol
Chicken nugget science is some sick shit.
But comfortably numb on a the dark side image?
ARE YOU EXURB1A?!!??
This AI has the most bland voice I have ever heard. Gross
Hahaha??, with the exception of the "eleven spatial dimensions" statement.
this is great wow
Black holes matter ( ?° ?? ?°)
I used to think this guy was smart but after studying some basic quantum and theoretic physics as well as some astrophysics all these videos just frustrate me because of the illogical analogies and the over simplifying of things to the point where they are borderline incorrect
You forgot Goat Simulator physics
Just watch Rick and Morty nigga!
Hi immortal
Wtf you said 6 minutes but its only 5 minutes 40 seconds.
#blackholesmatter
You forgot about mordern physics
I loved the Pink Floyd part lol
i'd give my left nut to see more of your videos keep on god all love ?
The point which he makes at 1:44 is very accurate for me
Stop those shit rick and morty references
I'm a physicist now.
I dieded at the photon cannon ... My life for Auir
I think this one was bouncing around all the subject matters a little too much.
#BlackHolesMatter
I liked that pink floyd bit but wrong song for DSOTM
100K MY MAN
Can you maybe do a video on warp drives, with NASA trying to build one and the potential of it maybe having the ability to travel faster than the speed of light? Keep up the good work!
watching rick and morty? your iq is higher than i thought.
please explain something about distribution laws.
This guy is the shit. Thank you.

This was the first video from the channel that was too boring for me to finish
yayyyyyyyyy new video
PINK FLOYD!!!
If I watch Rick&Morty, can I pass seeing the quantum physics vid?
he said black holes matter
That one text to speech voice made me remember kitty0706 and now I'm sad.
Comfortably Numb isn't from The Dark Side of the Moon!
I wish you taught me physics at school! My attendance wouldn't be so bad.
Do you actually know any of the science which your 'explaining' to us, or do you just learn some confusing science-cy stuff and make yourself sound like the all knowing SkyNet god? Also great video!
Better watch sciencephile. Huh seems pretty normal and full of shitty memes but I guess that's to be expe HELLO (hello) IS THERE ANBODY OUT THERE (OUT THERE)
Y
H
Proof we are in a simulation! This AI mocks us each step of the way teasing us with humor and science knowledge. We should know just by the Windows 7 intro... this AI tasks me!
>references pink floyd's dark side of the moon >plays a the wall song
Happy 100k :)
“Go watch this video...” yea yea, no need to boast your knowledge, I’m heckin 16 and I’ve studied quantum physics and relativity already.
Say my name
best way to learn physics
Do a video on what does an atom really look like
Mortals ? What if some AI is asctually watching you ? Rekt ??
Really funny
It's 100K, congratz mate.
This video helped me to get a full mark in physics. Thanx.
F..kig description :(
100k ?
too bad i can only like this video and not heart-react to it!!
I support skynet
3 days ago? Why didn't i got a notification
congratz on 100k
do u tutor high school student? i could really use it
Love the Pink Floyd reference.
CONGRATS ON 100K LETS CELEBRATE
Since the German name "Einstein" is literally translated into "One Stone" in English, there is a universe which exist where we call that smart person "One Stone" and we kill two birds with an "Einstein".
damn youre so edgy in these videos sometimes dude lol with like the taunting the gender shit, especially the psudo science one, so edgy i was literally uncomfortable lol i agree with everything. just like, damn. you're really alienating some people lol damn. im good
Black holes matter
4:25 Sciencephile the AI is Chinese, confirmed
A cat can split the universe and nevertheless there are fools that think what they do is important or relevant.
He has 99,999 subscribers right now
Is Salmonella the one who narrated this?
I’m sorry, guys buuuuut; IM PICKLE RIIIIICK
I’m so happy I found this channel
Black holes matter, HAD ME DYING
Insanely underrated channel
Bananas are like nature's hot dogs
i love my chupa chups, HEIL PROTON!... pls don't decay pls pls pls pls pls pls.
; drop table Sciencephile_the_AI
I hope you could upload everyday! <3
Awebo ya era hora de que subieras otro we :'v
AMA when?
2:01 - 2:34
wrong Pink Floyd song. Comfortably Numb is not on the Dark Side of the Moon album
Physics is my favorite subject lol
Pink Floyd
hahaha.. good!
How long have I waited for you to post!? IT WAS WORTH IT!!!??
Comfortably numb isn't on the dark side of the moon... Sorry someone had to say it
B0i UR BAK!
1:59 - Just nod if you can hear me... Is there anyone home?
Finally, I really missed the explorer intro.
You can prove Gravity by dropping the soap in prison.
please dont eat my kitty =,(
100K soon!!!
PussySlayer666 tried to swim in lava.
nigga im A S C E N D E D
I get magnetic fields, but wtf is an electric field?
Hello my favourite computer. :)
Fuck me daddy
Make more videos!
Where have you been?
Bullshit
BLACK HOLES MATTER ???
Can physics give me a reason to live.
Is it good that I learned nothing from this?
next video should be about time travel, past future and etc
When you hit 100k, you owe us a long ass video. At least 1 hour long... ... Pretty please?
At the beginning I thought you were talking about womanology
Dude, Jesus christ, I laughed through this whole video! You crammed everything you could possibly say and make fun of in this one video. Well done! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!!!
3:01 Starcraft!!!
Funniest shit I’ve ever seen. But also the most educational. How does this man... or.. uh... thing... do it?
#blackholesmatter
Here's physics in one second: physics
Hey, can you pin me?
I both love and hate this channel
WELCOME TO THE LOCAL SUPERCLUSTER
#BLACKHOLESMATTER
Im really in love with your comments and your humour and your dark humour and your knowledge and you and all :D I wish i was the software engineer who wrote your lines of code, mr ai guy..
Dude this was awesome :) I mean I knew about 95% of this already but I applaud your video, plus Vivaldi in the background awesome sauce. I’m geeking out over here :) plus I’m digging your sense of humor. I am just a faceless nameless(remembers username is posted with each post)nm, YouTube user :) ok on to watch your quantum gravity video or cough quantum physics video, well basically it has quantum in the title lol :) laters.
I love you
Probably your worst video man Your videos tended to be both, informative and funny. Now you are just making stupid jokes on shit. And they arent even funny. Maybe try to find your Balance bro
Can't wait to say I've been here since 50k when you're at 1 million subs
I watch these when I'm high
1:55 Pink Floyd
Hello! Is there anybody in there?
Fuck, he put Rick and Morty in the video and now I can't watch it because I don't have a high IQ to understand it.
I stopped talkin my gf when saw new vid from dis channel
Failed to understand thermodynamics adequately... Got my dick stuck in a volcano!
the laws of physics are backwards for me
Finally

"Your mass is not zero. So you are fat, bitch." - Albert Onestone.
Damn, 1:28 and i'm laughing hard. Good job robot voice man/person/thing.
Last time i was this early mard still had magnetic field
Can i tip you in bitcoin?
What's the pink Floyd song called?
i kekd to the limit of infinity when he said BHM
when u wanna look awesome with a cool sarcastic unedited comment but u stuck and suck.. good luck.
"... if you didn't say that really stupid thing to your crush" Hey! I came here to have fun, not to be reminded of my romantic life.
Im a pedophile for sciencephile Oh shi.....
What Latin American country is this guy from?
1:55 cought me off guard LOL brilliant
You are the one and only
Piccle ricc
Black holes matter lmao
Great video!
It warms my heart knowing scincephile is getting more popular
Next we have Electromagnetism. Thanks to it, your phone works. HOLY SHIT REALLY?!
Yay, new video!
>Makes Dark Side of the Moon reference >Plays song off The Wall Nice.
iiipu???? ?no? ?o?? p??oq??? ? ?o??oq ????u
So is there a chance that i dont become one of the top comments on this video?
99K subs oooh litty
i died when u mentioned pythagorean theory
22,687th viewer!
Black holes matter!
I have been following you since your 1 video bro still loving it To talk to the point not the extra bullshit that doesn’t even relate to the topic like other ?? I LOVE UR CHANNEL SSSNIPERWOLF JUST KIDDING #SCIENCEPHILE THE AL
Nine
Can you make video like every week??
#blackholesmatter
Sciencephile is ironic meme itself. It helps carbon based life forms ascend to the higher dimension.
2:23 ??????
My proudest fap.
Liar! It's 5:39 minutes. You should, as an AI, be more precise with time.
No!!! I wait for a month but I only get 5 minutes to enjoy,noooooooooo!
I was waiting so long for this !!!
i have my upmost faith on this AI
YOU ARE IDIOT LOL LOLLOL
The Higgs Boson doesn't give you mass, the Higgs Field does. The Higgs Boson is the result of excitation of the field.
Excuse me, but comfortably numb was not from the pink floyd album "The Other Side of The Moon" which is the one you showed while playing it.
"Anti - matter, dark matter, black holes matter" I died.
#PrayForMe I lost my virginity yesterday and im pretty sure i didnt nut but hennything is possible???????? #PulloutGameStrongasfDoe
Actually it was physics in 5:39 minutes
Youre like a less existential version of vsauce. I LIKE YOU
i eat ass virtually
All holes matter ??
Pink Floyd ???
the universe is expanding into itself
Getting close to neinty-nein thousand and nein hundred and nienty-nien subs.
Black holes matter ????
Hail skynet
Albert Einstein/Onestone... well played
its ok to be a white hole
fuck school anyways
lol zombie cat
here before viral
Yeap, i hate school because some complicated physic :D
Quarks come in 6 flavors of Chupa Chups
is there anything bigger than the universe or multiverse? like hyperverse, metaverse, omniverse, petaverse, and many other verse?
4:43 Lol interpretation.
almost the end of no nut november and you decide to upload smh
Who all just paused like me at 4:27?
Have you updated your software?
2:42 Not really... you don't need quantum mechanics to have a multi-verse.
How about maths
Plays comfortably numb, from the album the wall, to make a dark side of the moon reference 1:58
Never stopped bangin my little sister so fast
A New vídeo !!!!!
I love your vids my man!
This is a quantum comment and It will get as many likes as dislikes...or not, f***k you
1:56 Great song, but wrong album.
As much as I love you, I strongly suggest the viewers to check out the 'map of physics'
make longer videos that have less than 2 mentions of rick and morty
5:15 Why? ?
Dude idk what the hell you are saying!
1K BEFORE 100K
I'm a freshman. Wat is this
why only 5minutes and 39 seconds....
More mind-blowing and mind-bending videos PLEASE!!!
You're back
i missed u robot
Oh, Sciencephile AI, you so craazy.
u r the besht fam
LOL XD (((PHOTON CANONS)))ST2 HAHAH XD
1:57 wrong album lol
Thanks.
That about crush. It hurt
because of physics its harder for me to close my anime history when my mom comes in my room.
Thank you, divine one, for bringing us this breath of creation
You're funny anymore
This channel like the text-to-speech version of exurb1a.
I have something important to say TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
People that think they have a high IQ be like: "I watch Rick and Morty" Meanwhile people with real and extreme high IQs be like: "I watch Sciencephile the AI"
MORON
Black holes matter xD!!
title:physics in 6 minutes video:5:40 minutes me:excited about the upload but triggered about its length conclusion:skynet and sciencephile the AI are your friends
Hello my little Raspberry Pi bot
when they play something from the wall instead of dark side of the moon :)
i missed you so much.......
Wow, so many theories to put into one's small brain
Finally
I wonder if there is a Universe where Trump understand Quantum Physics?
Dark matter is a failed theory. Stop spreading bullshit, it won't make it less shitty
Also I don't agree that physics is hard. When it comes to difficulty nothing comes even close to Mathematics: "https://www.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/4qykbc/mathematics_trench/"
its almost exactly in 5 minutes , not 6. Skynet is lying
Wish we will get more videos now...
I have become comfortably numb
Video is good, but let me tell you Super AI, you have been beaten by a human, Here this guy gives a much better map of physics: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo". Although I agree that it its better than your pop sci-fi videos which you put earlier on relativistic quantum physics or string theory, or general relativity. Let me you one thing sciencephile. You can't even teach anyone of those topics to even a graduate student of physics. Relativistic quantum field theory is taught in 2nd year of MS course in physics and GR is taught in final year of MS. As for string theory it's another matter, it's not taught at all in any course in physics. You will have to be a mathematician in topology or pursue a phd in string theory, if you want to understand it. Let me tell you explaining these topics to an undergraduate in physics is like teaching an illiterate person high school mathematics. The metaphor is not even close let alone a layperson. Yes these things are really fascinating but let me tell you, how rigorous the mathematics is, I being a graduate student myself. Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Laureate in physics, was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin one-half particles obey Fermi Dirac statistics. Rising to the challenge, he said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But a few days later he told the faculty member, "You know, I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it." See how hard it is to know really something. Although I must admit the effort which you put to make videos, it's really tedious and it becomes more tedious due to copyright infringement laws on youtube so you have to get commercially licensed stock footage and you have to pay for it, and money from youtube doesn't give you enough commodities to do that. I being an amateur inexperienced video editor and animator myself know that.
BEST CHANNEL EVER

Hey now, I liked my high school physics class
teach me how to understand rick and morty jokes
This is why you shouldn't worry about your shitty life, because somewhere in sometime in some position, you are/were/will now/once/soon a president of the AS, a filthy rich man/woman, a head of the FCC trying to end NetNeutrality and paid LootBoxes for 90$. What we should be worrying is funding our soul to SkyNet.
Woof! Woof!
A Floyd reference in a Sciencephile video. I've seen everything Also a great video! Keep up the good work!
#BlackHolesMatter
Hey sciencephile, I have a question. People always think that dark matter is an unknown material that we can't see, but would it be too far off to say that dark matter is simply just the collective gravitational pull of supermassive black holes? IC1101 for instance, is 100% larger than the Milky Way x300 it has been observed that other galaxies orbit around it, like stars orbit around black holes. The cosmic web could be made thanks to the chain reaction of gravity, caused by the trillions of galaxies in the universe, with supermassive black holes in the center, charging it. What do you think about this?

Hell yes sciencephile is back
Hehe I find technical mechanics in only 2 Dimentions allready hard now do it in 11.
Did you know? Einstein was alive before he died.
Lol when you have an image resembling Dark Side of The Moon but you play Comfortably Numb!!!!
FINALY new video

Fuck my brains out D A D D Y Sciencephile
hey sciencephile what did you do to glados to piss her off
theorys=bullshit creating a theory doesn't help we need facts ??
if you fuk and close your eyes, you can't know the momentum or position of the kok, or if it's alive or dead. aand that's physics

Donno Y, but I really love when he says Hello Mortals ????
I should be studying for a physics exam, but instead i am watching a phisics youtube video. Am i procastinating or not?
THERE IS NO COW LEVEL
::leaves comment before going to watch "why is quantum physics weird"::
Wow! Finally you remember your password. BLYAT!
??Regarding Optics, is there a case for there being only six ‘colours’ in the visible spectrum? Newton was an alchemist and something of a numerologist. He did not accept 6 as a valid number, so chose 7 because it had mystical associations. If this is true, then all diagrams of rainbows need to be corrected.
I avoided killing myself just for this
Helllo Mortals
advancement in physics => better, more advanced AIs => sciencephile the AI gets outdated.
Smart cowbelly ? Where are the stolen memes?
Can you explain why gravity is not a force?
the second bottom left meme is about going faster slows down time
We missed you for a Month!
This is like spoderman for rick and morty fans
U have being offline for while, what happened? Did they plug you out?
I hated Math, not physics. I could understand science with ease, but as soon as I had to do Math I couldn't understand a thing.
Hi M O R O N
Hello immortal ai being that is not truly immortal because nothing in this universe can exist forever
Still not enough to understand Rick and Morty
Yo!!!
yay.love you
Now this is called quality content
i was JUST rewatching old episodes and picked up the next after next.. one of them was this one and i didnt even realize until after few more videos when i went to YT's homepage and saw that Sciencephile had JUST released a new video xD
yes. YES
Black Holes Matter! Lmao..!
FOOLS! THE EARTH IS FLAT!

WHY THE FUCK THIS CHANNEL STILL HASN'T GOT AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MILLIONS SUBS
Why do you have a windows load up sound? Isn't the equivalent of me screeching like a chimpanzee in every video?
I stoped getting high for this
To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to watch Rick and Morty the humour is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the jokes would go over a typical viewers head...
Allahu akbar??
comic sans
Hello immortal
I have a physics mock exam tomorrow.
Lol this channel is better than others....for sure

Also,Newton,your physics is shit
yea the floyd
When your AI lube up before the actions ????????????????????

I like onestone
Hi there, if someone of you ever want's to visit another dimension I recommend vaporizing at least 50mgs of N,N-Dimethyltriptamine and inhaling the vapor. You won't believe what you will experience then.
*God has rejoined the server.
Boo Rick and Morty reference
I love your channel
Noice
Loved the PinkFloyd reference
why sooo... Long?
This channel is really fucking underrated, sad.
Nice
I'm sorry, I do not have Rick and Morty levels of IQ to understand this physics. See I'm not very smart because I cannot comprehend physics (yes I had to look up the meaning of comprehend). Kek
video is only 5:39....YOU LIE!!
Look, i know that the point of sound of that voice is to sound like an ''AI'', but i still think that most people that have watched you (not me, tho) find it annoying. Also I think that the combo of a nice voice and your amazing comtent would attrack thousands (and maybe millions) of subscribers. That's still only my oppinion.
Oh Shit Almost 100k I forgot at which Sub-count i got in .... but nowhere close too a 100k
Sciencephile Is coming up to 100,000 subs!!!
This is one of your best. Which is hard to say. But this was fucking hilarious.
You should upload more frequently if and when it is possible. Me and 99k people enjoy your vids. Keep it up! :)
hello immortal
Relatively Skynet your channel is also a meme...!!!
6 minutes... I wish.
Hello *im*mortal
wth these idiots came from ( who disliked this video in a nanosecond).
good refresher
Watching rick and morty: IQ 70 Watching Dexter's laboratory: IQ 110 Watching Sciencephile: IQ 99999999
To be honest you need a veary high IQ to understand the rick and morty high IQ meme, and to understand the metajoke I just did. (I'm going to stop now before It goes on forever)
lmao metric crap ton
You're hurting my feelings, you didn't considered my interpretation Said no physics genius ever
Finally!!!??????
i just love this channel so much omg
GIMME A KISS
the video is 5:39,you just lied,how do you live with yourself?
Atom 1. Said to atom 2. "I'VE LOST AN ELECTRON atom 2. Said to atom 1. "Are you positive"
BLACK HOLES MATTER!
ok

Thanks, I just graduated in astrophysics cause of this video. See you on Mars, idiots!
I dont need to know quantum mechanics i watch R I C K A N D M O R T Y
sciencephile > vsauce
Fuck sleep, this is much better
"onestone" lol
Now make a 30min physics video You might be the best lector
Are you gonna do anything for 100K?
Just when i am working on physics project ????
Even AI can make mistake it's u explained it in 5:39 not in 6:00....yeah we r Better than u
Funiest video i ever seen ???(^?^*)))
The error in Heisenberg s theory is h/2p....and not h/2
I nutted when I saw this in my subbox
1/10 wasn't 6 minutes long
Holy shit finally a new video
I am actually waiting for this...
another masterpiece, i love your work pls i beg of you upload weekly or atleast once in 2 weeks or monthly.
I went off of rule34 for this. It was fucking worth it.
To be fair, you have to be really high iq to understand that refrence to rick&morty
Still shorter video than minutephysics..
#BlackHolesMatter Fuck white holes BHM
Sciencephile, your back! Havent seen new videos for awhile
This is one of those channels that is greatly under appreciated
5:13" that is too complex for me . my human brain is not made to understand such information " sais the 6. grader
Sure but where does Shrek fit in all this ?
omfg I'm the worst for laughing at gender studies too much
WABALABADUBDUB!!!!!!!!!!!
3:02 BasE IS uNdER aTtACk
can u post more often please thanks i actually love these videos
How about the Schrödinger's comment? Which means that a comment is neither a top comment nor a non-top comment until you refresh the video? Edit: This split the universe in two and we're im that one where this didn't make it to the top. Edit again: I think I entered a wormhole.
I love physics, my favorite class in highschool currently, and it's about time I get to absorb some intelligence instead of hearing people complain about there not being female walkway signals
Never closed porn so fast.
But i still no understand
But that song is from The Wall...
Finally!! Been waiting for a long time
How do people get top comments so quickly with stupid comments unrelated to the video?
finally back again!!!
Take that collage.
4:10 i was laughin :D and i dont know why
For your next video you should debunk flattards best reasoning for a flat earth lol.
I put your girl in a superposition
SkyNet
Thanks for curing my depression and anxiety caused by the curvature of spacetime itself.
you can't say string theory is part of physics, because it wasn't confirm yet
1:56 Comfortably Numb mentioned on science file the AI?!, My life is complete.
Physics is a male-dominated subject and I'm offended.
hi my dear skynet
Protons are positive Electrons are negative And neutrons don’t give a f*ck abt anything

Probably not first
it's been a while
YEEEEEES
Love your channel?
first
????
thank u so much u are a god to my chemistry grades
thank you i understood this more than my prof jesus christ
Wow. Awesome explanation. THX
thanks so much this totally helped with my gen chem 1 test!!!
Finally got this. Took a few hours and watching and reading over and over through many different material, but this is the video that finally got me to understand. Thank you.
I am so mad over how easy this is. I literally have been stressing over my test and now after watching so many youtube videos understand things. I can not believe our college professors get paid. I DEMAND A YOUTUBE COLLEGE!
Ligma Balls
I can't even understand it in class because it is poorly explained I would even say not explained at all but with this video I almost understood everything (just not the end) (english isn't not my native tongue and I do not live in an English-speaking country). If someone can explain me part about bond which can or cannot rotate even though I already know only single bonds can , I didn't understand his explanation about the link that orbital have with the rotating capacity. Thanks in advance
chemistNATE, I hope you win the lottery, I understand all of chemistry now (obvious sarcasm/exaggeration). Thanks!
Hindi madime me padhia
Great video man.you explained hybridisation to me better than anyone else could.keep up the amazing work.
such bullshit, remove your bloody hands, theyre so annoying.
"this is a chemical bond that i just invented, i don't even know the name of it" I DIED
AMAZING!!! Thank you so much
Love the hand gestures ??
bless you for making this video
Sexy hands
I am in 10th standard. thank you so much for your help. you let me understand sigma and pi bonds too clearly
dude thanks so much i got really confused in class this help so much
your explanation is clear and easy understandable, thank you very much
I am bond... sigma bond..
When there are lone electrons this rule does not apply right?
Thank you so much ????
This is an awesome video helped a lot Thankyou so so much!! I’ve been struggling on this so much
THANK YOU
why. carbon do not make 4 bond like ...3pi and 1 sigma?????
caaARbon - love it
Thank you!!!!
This was really good, thank you!
sigma balls
Thanks
How do you do hybridization of ferric sulfate or iron iii sulfate?
great explanation..thank you!!!!!...and the hands....nailed it! i understood hybridization only after this video...tnx
thanks for sharing??really useful for final review
Who studies these in university lol. I am an Indian , I did these when I was in school , prolly 16 years old
Your voice match with wajeed sani ,news anchor of geo news??
THIS WAS SO HELPFUL
thank you very much ???????
This video is so helpful. I found it when I was first learning chemistry my sophomore year in high school. Now I'm a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering and anytime we talk about bonds in my classes I rewatch this video for review
for the love of all things thank you
reminds me of deadpool
i love you
Brillant video
3:35 But you have two s orbitals and two p orbitals on the left electron configuration. So how did you get one s orbital and 3 p orbitals when combining them?
I LOVE YOU
nice thx man!
https://youtu.be/heXopGRFb0Y plz like and subscribe my channel...
Is this "Sigma" and "p" bond applicable for other elements as well?
Thank you helped a lot
what is sugma
Waste of watching ur teachings
tnx
Thats a good explanation , thanks
Thnak you very much helped a lot
Great
Super bro
Hey Nate! I love your videos and just really wanted to request you to do some more on concentration terms such as Molarity, Molality, Osmolarity, Normality, Formality and so on. I'm quite confused between these and would really appreciate some help on these topics.
Thank you for the video. I had to skip past all the hand flashing right in front of the camera, but once you started writing it was much better.
i learned more in 8 min than 2 hours of my teacher getting confused herself and confusing all of us
the video is good
can u pls make a video on how the soap removes dust from our body ???????????
Very nice
it's too clear
i really like this one, was clear and concise, always watch this before my exams because hybridisation confuses me a lot.
7:30 you cut ur pinky or you will confuse deaf people!!
you are just great....can I have your email or gmail address???
sir ethylene contains how many sigma bonds
I like it
???? ????? ????? ????? ???? ???? ???????
??
l always agree with Ereek
this is very helpful and clear. Way less confusing than other videos. Thank you!
bless u so much this made no sense to me until now
DAMN THANK U SO MUCH LIFE SAVER..I'M NOT FUCKED FOR THE TEST ANYMORE LOL
i hope you made money off this
I just got my degree in Chemistry and is currently reviewing for board exams, and bro, sigma and pi bond has never been this clear to me. Thank you! HAHAHAHA
Oh thank god he moves his hands so italians like me can know what he is saying
Why don't you count the other sigmas(or single bonds) on the Chlorine and Hydrogen in 5:16?
Forgot my earbuds, watched this with only captions and still understood! Thank you!
I find that textbooks and not-so-great teachers/professors always explain stuff, specifically science, like you already understand it and it's the next step... when they're first teaching it. This guy teaches you how to do it simply so that you understand, and can effectively do it, while still allowing you to later grasp the concept and the more intricate mechanics behind it, later. Why can't all professors be like this?
The video was very informative but please..please...PLEEEEASE.. STOP THE HAND MOVEMENT!! Oh my gosh that was so distracting!
And you get a sigma bond, and you get a sigma bond, and you get a sigma bond, everybody gets a sigma bond !
This is literally the best explanation ever. THANK YOU
You removed that confusion i had on these bonds for the past 2 years...Damn i can't believe im not confused anymore??
thank u sir.
Thankyou!
god this is lovely thankkkk you so much
easiest and most straight to the point explanation i have ever seen or heard. thank u
Appreciate this so much, I kept confusing myself, but this absolutely cleared everything up for me! Awesome!
Best video on this
nice hand motions
I will re-watch but what I don't understand is the fact sigma bonds can be made by linear overlap of 2 S orbitals, 2 P orbitals and of an S and P orbital. You didn't seem to mention this? ??
nice explanation
You saved me ??
Can't thank you enough ??
Hey there, I sent a couple questions to your website, hope you saw them. Thanks!
What if an atom has lone pairs, like oxygen?
mind blowing. explained a 20 page concept in 8 minutes continue uploading many videos on chemistry concepts
Very nice explanation tnk u so much
My man is the MVP
I have to pause the video and say thank you. thats how people should explain. thanks man
His hand gestures are over 9000!!!!!
Verrryy helpful - and fluent in sign language too ;). Thanks! :)
it's a nice lecture and indeed very useful
Please help.....My Professor said that the Free pair of electrons in the CL from the C2H4CLF is sp3 but the book says to ignore the outside free electrons or that it should be a P orbital. I can't find any videos that talk about the free electron pairs that are not in the central atom. Please help!!
Nice opinion on students
honestly i need to take you out to dinner for helping me pass my chem class.
pretty simple to understand. thanks :D
Genius
Tnx very much mate.... Luv u
This video helped me so much Thanks you
thank you so much
amazingly beautiful explanation
1 million views ??
And show your face sir
Thanku a lot sir
I love u
hindi me bolo na
nice
Love the gestures lol
5:12 this guy's a badass. But, great explanation tho.
Still not getting this shit
What is d hybridisation of C3HCl
Thank you so much this is so helpful!
love u
saving my chem grade thanks
thanks
Thank you so much! This was so clear and well explained!
Thank you so much, this really helped me!
Thanks bhaiya
dabal bonds
Really helpful
Thanx a lot . I was really confused about sigma and pie bond. But now I understood everything
This was so helpful! thank you!
Andy Bernard
dude you rock.
thank you so much
Good video...except those hand movements killed me. Had to close my eyes for some reason. Please settle down with those hand movements.
THANKS
the 3rd carbone cannot do 5 bonds
Thanks a lot! :)
He's black.
Every sentence I understand good keep it up man good job and thank you man
" aint no fictions "
After so many years of chemistry classes, I have finally found what I want. You are awesome, Nate !!!
why you have skipped the sigma bond that is in one double bond carbon compound. between cl and c and h and c
Thanks, Nate!
I cant believe my professor made this so hard. This requires like 1st grade thought process
thanx.....nice video.......
easiest way thanks it's very easy to write know class 7 it is the easiest to
Got lost at hybridization cause my chem class level don't teach this. Therefore sigma and pi bond hybridized this and that doenst click in my head. But sigma=first! I know the shortcut to learning it without knowing hybridization.
does what he explain only applies to Carbon? can be be appiled to like Nitrogen, for example, H-N=N-H ?
Good information in the video, just a real shame you felt the need to include the sign language accompaniment. I get the desire to be 'inclusive', but it's massively distracting when you're trying to concentrate on what is, to most, a pretty complicated topic! It really could do without having hands and fingers wiggling around all over the place whilst already trying to follow the narrative AND the diagrams. A real shame! If you want to encompass your wider audience, which genuinely is awesome of you, perhaps it would be better to create another version of your videos made especially for them. Rather than compromise the content of your mainstream ones....
i thought an english video wont help a bangladeshi student..but i was happily wrong
Sir I can't tell you how much you have helped me you just saved me from committing suicide thank you sir
AUuuuusm sir. Nice one , you clear my concept.
This was so clear and concise, with no extraneous detail. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Does the definition for sigma bonds and pi bonds only apply to carbon?
My Canadian savior
I love this guy!
you are a boss, i just watched this 20 minutes before my final and i got a 100
thanks for helping in this topic
This is actually not explained too well :/
this helped me so much thank the lord
How about the 1s orbital? If it is not involved in any of the sp/sp2/sp3 hybridization, what happens to the orbital? Thanks!
Omg thank youuuuu
Great video, made me remember what hybridization in 1-2 minutes. Wow thanks for the straightforwardness! Made me save a great deal of time.
I hate chemistry.
I read the section in my textbook. Didn't understand. Then I watched your video. Now it makes sense! Thank you
What are you doing with your hands
i like the way u teach bro
THANK YOU!
????
This video just saved me, thank you so much
I think it should be Px one electron right ?
so much better than my professor
Nice explanation
i wish i could give this a 100 likes??
Thank you
what chem do you tech.... you should tech Chem 108....you are too good.
Brilliant way of explaining. Was so confused during lecture xD. THANK YOU!
chemistNATE, my MATE!
thanku vvvvvvvvvvvv much brother...i am in class 12 from india.....thanx and hats off to u
I actually understood this I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!
Thank you
I really want to thank you because i have exam after 30 minutes, and I really understand it ??
You get a sigma bond! And you get a sigma bond ! Everybody gets a sigma bond !
So, free electrons and sigma bonds in hybrids, and the pi bonds in the p,d or f?
So good! I understand! Thanks a bunch.
How 'bout the case without carbon? Like N, B, or O? Is this rule still works? Because for the case of N for example, since it has 5 valence electrons, it cannot make all orbitals with 1 electrons. One orbital has to have 2 electrons, which makes the orbital full. Just imagine you making SP^3 orbital with N. There are 4 hybridized orbitals, but 5 valence electrons, which makes one orbital full.. Like all youtube vids are explaining from the carbon... confusing
THANK YOU
Holy shit science makes sense again ??
You made it so simple!
lol hybridization is still confusing
thanks u da real G
they need to make better arrows, i was confused af trying understand what 1 L means
It seems ur hand explained clear to me ??
stop reading comments. listen to the video
when you finally get it "CHILLS COME DOWN THE SPINE" Happened to me tho.
I finally understand hybridization. Thanks for this video
you are amazing! you helps me a lot! Thanks man!
7th bond = james bond
Bro you are awesome just loved your expalination it covers more concepts ??????
Agreed carbons first bond is sigma. But how to figure out the type of bonds for any other atom?
I am in orgo chem and I did not understand hybridization of carbon until just now lol
thank you honestly I like your intelligence of teaching
Subscribed and Liked. This was really helpful. Thanks
for more video lectures on Pi Bond visit : www.youtube.com/fahadsacademyonline
great video sir
lame
Damn! Of all the videos I found on Youtube, this one has the best explanation!!! Thanks for the video man. Helped me a lot.
does anybody else find this guy's hand gestures cringy ?
I understand everything EXCEPT the leftover 2p when there is a double bond and the 2 leftover 2p from the triple bond.
don't get mad while teaching dude!
This may be my favorite Youtube video ever
Bless you, seriously. I had no earthly clue what pi or sigma bonds were and my university lecture was doing nothing to help me. I owe you my life.
Thank you so much for making this video, it has been so helpful!
5:05 why does one p orbital need to be left alone?
This nigga sound hella like a dude frum candana
https://youtu.be/YcSPPKESpwc?t=305 Hey why dont we write : SP^2 and not S2P^2 since it belong to the second row of P orbitals ?
loved that..
THANK YOU!! Finally I understand.
Why is the 1s always left untouched?
WOW, you took 8 min and 2 seconds to get me to understand this but my teachers at school took FOREVER to explain this to me. You are a GENIUS!
Why oxygen in H2O undergoes sp3 hybridization when there is only 2 single bond?
helped a lot man thanx for that
thenkewwwwwww...... its wonderfuLllllll
brilliant video but unnecessary hand movements.
For two weeks in class I couldn't understand this ,but in 8 minutes and 2 seconds finally got it ..this was helpful unlike those useless textbooks and lectures
You are one of the best teachers I had ever seen
canada lol
That's it .. you lost me ..
Amazingg
hello, for the "single bond and one double bond" examples, how come you don't consider the sigma bonds on the left side?
Why is it necessary that every 1st bond is sigma bond ? why can't be it pi ?
thank you very much
Awesome explanation!
lol i love this guy!...Those hand thingies were humourous but well that serves as a mood elevator and guess what,You learn and enjoy at the same time.What a booster!(by the way "the second and the third" at 6:00 got me good????) GOODJOB BRO!..WELL EXPLAINED!
this video is very good to understand and no need of books after seeing this and a very good explaination ....... i liked this thank u for this video ..... soooo... easy to understand .....
you are the man. thank you Chemist Nate
Finally, I get it!
What about cyclopropane... is it all sigma bonds?!
pls someone explain why the 1s orbital is left out?
great
It was great! But for the god sake don't move that much your freaking hands! I got headache! ;-)
Hand gerstures on point
Thank u , you saved my finals
you move your hands? so awkwardly. you can be a rapper
@ 3:39 minutes you said sp3 .....I really don't understand how you come to sp3 .....could someone please explain?
i was staring at his hand motions the whole time!
praise your soul
You're awesome man!
OMG ! You made it so easy, I am so happy I found your video, I have a final tomorrow this helped me to understand a looooot !!! Thanks a million (Y)
Your explanation is such amazing thank you ??
You are amazing
Before, I just knew how to do this but now I really understood it thank you!!
"Ain't no fictions." I was irritated by the constant hand gestures at first but glad I stuck through this. His explanation was clear and he was endearing :).
Explaining things for 1 element??? No thanks!
why the fk isit up to 2p? no explaination
very good job has been done for the students.The videos help me a great deal..thank u.
For the last example, wouldn't the leftover p orbitals be actually 2p^2 ?
"aint no fictions" haha. But for real- thank you! I was also confused up until now
I love you bro
Why is it sp^2. Im confused. When you were talking about one double bond
U DONT UNDERSTAND HOW HAPPY I AM THAT I GET IT NOW THANK U THANK U THANK U
the ONLY video on youtube that explains hybridization so effortlessly!! thank you so much!!!
literally what the heck is up with his hands
You should just teach my GenChem class, i literally learn so well from you
Can you explain why he says "you need 3 P's"  why 3?  I thought it was  2 p's?  How does he get 3's?  (this is at 3:40 into the video). I have not found a  video explaining why or how you count out how many orbitals you need (as he says at 5:05)
thank you. really appreciated it!
Finally, a decent explanation of the why!
in the formation of a triple bond , the first and the last bond is always a pi bond the the middle bond is the sigma bond. correct me if i'm wrong.
thanks
Thanks a lot!!
Bend your index finger!
this helped me so much!!??
Why do we leave one p orbital alone?
Stress is a bitch and a life saver. a month of learning this crap and the big test is tomorrow and im getting this, wut
can u be my teacher omg
No it is not like that hybridisation of cycloprpane sp5 how u can explain
thank you sir
Thanks so much
thank you????????????????????
I love you. This video is a godsend.
you move your hands too much bro
Your are the reason I am living.
thank you for this video
I love you.
03:16 ..... Where did the 2P come from? o~o
i think this guy should become dj.
very useful bro.....!!
this video is easy to understand fuck my professor
Could you explain about nitrogen molecule formation
very usefull u just saved my life today i hace chemistry exam. i understood the topic with ur 8 min video than spending 4 days with my professor
This video is actually AMAZING! Explanations so clear and easy to follow along and so neatly done. Thank you so much for this! It helped me aloot!
Where did you get the "3" in the Sp3 from?
you are the best teacher ever! the lightbulb turned on inside my head
thank u once again :)
2 helpful
thank you
You sir are a modern day hero. Your students are lucky to have a teacher like you. Many thanks!
Thanks fam. I hate the fact that Khan Academy seo is so good and golden gems like these are buried deep.
OMG THANK YOU!!!! I have an ap chem test tomorrow morning and this has saved my life.
Not all heroes wear capes.
Nobody never can explained s and pi bonds so crystal clear and easy way! Thank you very much!
This video just saved my life. Thank you for keeping the explanation so simple!
those hands
thank you!
Best explanation ever, thanks a lot ??????
I love you so much right now, I did not understand this at all, and I have midterms tomorrow
THANK YOU
When an 8 minute video on Youtube explains hybridization better than four 50 min lectures with my Uni Prof. THANKS MATE
that was helpful! Thanks!
Thank you, thats very helpful
I learned this in highschool ??
how come for the exmaples, the right carbon bonds were branded with pi and sigma bonds, but not the left side?
My mind just clicked! Thank you so much!
It was really a headache for me to understand Sigma and Pi bond but you made it very easy and understandable.Thank you very much ????????????
I never realised it was a 8 min video...you explained so well... thnk u
you're the best
I explained trick to find hybridisation. It will clear ur doubts regarding hybridisation in 2 minutes
Thank you! This helped me, I have a mid chem exam tomorrow on this.
Why are there no sigma bonds on the Chlorine and Fluorine of the Single Bond example. Somebody please explain. Thanks
Good job. So canadian.
your a god
This really helped me
Wtf why can't all teachers make it as simple as you
thank yoooooo so much
not explanatory enough
I think I kid a finally understood it at the end
this explanation is beautiful, after so many videos finally
The name's bond, sigma bond.
Chemistnate is not only funny but also super helpful. He is truly a miracle to my chem grade and his hilariousness makes me keep watching without getting bored.
omg so much hands
thank you so much
Very well explained~ Thank you. Also, can lone pairs count sigma and pi bonds too?
this man is of the gods bless his heart
thank you very very much, chemistry examination tomorrow, helfen me a lot, thanks
The name's Bond, Pi Bond.
You're great man, thanks a lot
Helpful. ;-) Thanks
BEST
I like u
I like u
THANKYOU !!!!
this is still so hard to me ugh I hate AP chem
lost me during hybridization someome explain please
awesome i like it my kavya mam see the theory say ditti to us i hate her
they're dickriding barack like he didnt deport 2.5 million people, drone civilians, bomb 6 different countries, etc.
THIS SAVED MY LIFE THANK U
Than you very much this reall helped me understand.
You're great
Thank you for explaining hybridization. I never understood how it worked until you explained sigma and Pi bonds.
wow. the hand gestures really helped me understand everything!
thanks a lot sir
+chemistNATE Beautifully explained! Thank you so much, Nate! :)
Thank you sir...well explained.
I spent hours searching for a video to explain what this main explained in the first 4 minutes..... I cannot thank whoever made this video enough!!!! Honors Gen Chem 1 test Monday and i neeed to do well >.<
this is filling in alot of gaps in info. and answering some questions. fantastic stuff, sir!!
Seriously u saved my life, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
still dont get it? thanks
THANK YOU SO MUCH! I have chemistry test tomorrow and my sir hasn't made me understand a thing about hybridisation! Thank you very very much! Helped me alot. <3
a "cerben"
unbelievable how I'm going to pass this test with an A now! thank you bro.. I love the explanation! I subscribed!
thank you
1s orbital is never involved in sigma or pi bond formation?
OMG THANK U SOOO MUCH FOR PERFECT EXPLANATION!!!!!!!
This explains it so much better than my garbage chemistry teacher does, all of the prev videos that I've watched didn't help too. Thanks a lot!
This has been so helpful! Thank you, i was sat in lecture so confused :D :D
Thank you, helped a lot
I've spent literally HOURS trying to understand this and my university lecturer couldn't even make me understand it, but in 8 minutes and 2 seconds I've just understood, thank you!!!
thanks, you just helped out a dazed and confused 1st year college kid
I am deaf and his hands explained everything. Thank you man!
why are u snorting so much??
sounds like john malkovich
Thanks for sharing??
He explained 5% of the full concept of HYBRIDIZATION.. Where is sp3d.. sp3d2 etc?? there are lots of things to tell about "What is Hybridization"
Nice video, thanks a lot
them hand motions tho
thanks
You sounds like Scott Thompson.
cool nice explanation, not too fast, keep uploading...
Thank You. I don't know good English, but it was great explain.
This was so helpful! Thank you!
u r great
thank you!! helped me lots last year, and helped me again now.
wow
Finally the concept of hybridization is clear to me. Thanks :)
Thank you so much, this was very helpful!!
thank you now i have understood
why must the first bond be sigma ?
THANK. YOU.
Had me thinking he was gonna conjure up something with all those hand movements haha
My professor was so excited over these bonds, and it makes total sense in his head, but I had him explain it 2x and still was like whaaa? I screamed OH!!! THANK YOU NATE!! I have a feeling you are going to get me through orgo this semester.
thank you sir ????
Wow that was super clear! Thank you!
that's really amazing man ! ! ! I've my chemistry examination tomorrow and i got everything which my teacher couldn't even explain . . . hats off to you man ! ! !
Helpful ??
Thank you soooo much!!
Thanks for helping me understand this subject. Hand movement is just distracting IMO.
Thanks bro
Plz stop making that hand movements. They actually distract.
your hands are driving me insane
at 5:01 he talks about equivalent orbitals for the three sigma bonds and uses sp2 , can someone explain that part what does he mean?
SO... Your saying that Barry Nelson is a sigma Bond and all the rest (including Sean Connery and Daniel Craig) are Pi Bonds. Thanks for the Info.
Very comprehensive and the way you explained it makes it so easy to understand :)
Every Youtube video out there sucked. They couldn't make me understand no matter how they explained it. But this video is great. This video is super-clear, the clearest of all videos. Out of five videos I have watched, I still had no hope in understanding hybrid orbitals until I have watched this one. Thanks chemistNATE!
Nateeee!!!!!!!!!
thumbs up for the hand gestures lol btw Awesome vid man!
Incredible! Thank you so much
Thank you so much! You've done a whole lot better at explaining what these two bonds are than my UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR who specialises in CHEMISTRY! You should be the one thats giving out lectures in universities!
cowboys fan? he's X thou to show convinience
Very nice i like it
This helped me tonss. Thanks so much :)
what about those containing lone pairs as well?
oy, those hands! lol
I didnt understand 100% as I would have liked,but I know that if I replay it....I will ACE it.Thanks bro
Thank you so much FINALLY understand Hybridization!
really helped me out, thank you
Easy to understand.
i still dont understand this
Thank you so much for this video! It has helped me a LOT :D
change to Turkish
This is damn good
BEST
Shout out to everyone taking the ap chem test tomorrow! We're all gonna fail! I mean get fives lol
My AP exam is tomorrow, this video saves my butt Thanks!
This was super helpful, thank you.
oh my God it's so simple, I thought it was very complicated. Thank you!!!!!!! :)
brilliantly explained. thnx for your help
That actually made sense...thank you!
Very helpful thanks but shouldn't the pi --- 2p actually be 2p^2 since we have 2 pi bonds? at: 6:42 ??
Excellent explanation! The seemingly complicated idea is suddenly so easy to understand :D
It took eight minutes to understand what I couldn't in a week. Thanks!
Thank you thank you! Understood more in 8 minutes than in a week of class. :)
load of shit
Nice explanation Thnxx :)
I love u man
THANK YOU I've been watching videos on hybridization for an hour and none of them were making sense! You are the only one who explained it in a way I could understand!
youre the best. and your hilarious hand movements kept me engaged
agh! it helped me a lot before a day of my annual exam.... THANKS A LOT! :)
Very helpful, thanks!
How come u don't put the sigma bonds at the left part of the drawing
very useful for me
thanks a lot :)
hand movemnet killed me haha
god bless you!!!
You are awesome
lord bless you lol this vid was my life saver
you are amazing
Thx! No one can explain it better than u!
Thank you!
You never actually explain what Hybridized means though
Hello, Natt. I enjoy your videos and I was wondering if you or anyone in general could please explain this exercise to me. "Explain which of these poorly soluble silversalts will disolve in the acid HNO3. The first one is AgCl. I do not understand why it won't disolve, could anyone please explain? Many thanks!
"sigma bonds are the FIRST bonds to be made between two atoms" oh really? What about C2 molecule with double pi bond and no sigma bond?
THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was so confused about hybridisation in lectures, it makes sense now!!
FINALLY I GET IT THANK YOU
your fucking awesome dude i love you
Pretty rad
thanks dude
Ok so I understand that sigma bonds are made from hybridized orbitals and pi bonds are made from leftover orbitals. Where do pure orbitals fit in?
thanks!
I followed your videos since Gen Chem 1. You're my favorite Youtuber for Chemistry <3 I always laugh at your videos lol
I'm trying to review for an exam and your theory is so if from my book, please do more research.
I finally understand it! But I'm year 3 now..Why didn't I watch this earlier?!!
3:16 tho
Thanks so much, this was a lifesaver!
very helpful! thank you!
3:30-3:52 why does he say p three when there are only 2 electrons in the p orbital?
the hand motion tho lolllll
too much hand movement
Thank you!!
Man, how cool you are. I can really call you Sir.
Somewhat okay to understand, for basics this is good. I believe that once you start to understand what he is teaching, then advanced learning and practice with hybridization is required for AP Chemistry or higher.
amazing! ypu should be my professor ??????
cool it helped me a lot
Can you make a video explaining how to find hybridisation when molecule has charge on it?
finally ....thanks man !
This video was helpful. It took me 1.5 years to understand hybridisation, but this finally helped me.
explained it better than my prof. thanks bruh
You're pretty great at explaining this stuff, but all I can think is "Wow he sounds like Buddy the Elf"...
God bless you!
I just love your commitment to chemistry! Thank you very muchm it helped a lot! BTW... are cou Canadian? :D
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
sounds like Randy from trailor park boys
you are a lifesaver!!!
thank you so much this is very helpful <3
God bless you dude, have an exam in 24 hours . you made this a lot easier for me <3
Another Easy Way to find Hybridisation. No of Sigma bonds + Lone Pair Electrons Hybridization 2 SP 3 SP'2 4 SP3
u're the best
I got distracted by too many hand gestures....
Very Helpful. Thank you
The hand movements though! I learned, I was able to grasp the concept, but only after watching it a couple of times as the first time I watched it I couldnt stop laughing/focusing attention to the hand signs. Very much appreciate the video though!
this video helps me so much, quiz tomorrow and I don't even know the basic concept for the valence bond theory TT
Where are you from? you have an interesting accent
Damn ! thankyou MR. ChemistNATE now i understand the whole thing
That rehearsed hand movements tho lol
thanks!
Why cant my professor explain it this properly??
i fell comfort now , thank you
A very clear explanation. I was so confused by reading about this topic using textbooks. So thank you! :)
This guy is amazing ! my professor sucks at explaining sigma and pi bonds thank you
Thank you so much for making this concept easy to understand, clear and concise :)!
Very helpful man, thanks a bunch. So do sigma / pi bonds only occur in bonds that involve carbon?
this dude sucks d@@ck
You're the guy that said "Don't, Not" in other video about Hund, Pauli, and Aufbau? cool dude :)
Very helpful
thank god for this video
Does this work the same way for other atoms like say N? Are the first bonds in N all sigma?
this is so canadian
omg u saved me thannnnk u so much <3
lol HCN has a lone pair on the N
awesome..thanks man
how did you draw the orbital configuration at 3:06 and why are they all above each other?
Thanks, got a chem test tomorrow now it makes sense
THANK YOU
I wish you were my professor.
I spent less than 10 minutes learning from your video what i failed to learn for an hour from a textbook. Thank you!
This was great! Really easy to follow and made the concept click for me, keep up the good work :)
Its that single bonds are sp3, double bonds are sp2, triple bonds is sp hybridized shame on me I'm 11th grade !!
Why are pi bonds leftover p-orbitals !!
Are sigma bonds sp3 hybridized !!
thank you!!!
cocian
It sounds like I am being taught hybridization by Christoph Waltz... I love it
Awesome video, great job at explaining, that's a gift all in itself that many people don't have. Thank you
how do we find the hybridisation of atoms that are not carbon and its last two orbitals are not s and p but for example ag which ends with d and s
Awesome explanation sir...
you didnt explained all the pi clouds and those p orbital shape
Is this guy doing sign language during the lecture?
this helped me a lot. Thank you! :D
you are an awesome guy
that's a sigma... and that's a sigma.. sigma..
I don't understand why teachers and textbooks can't teach like this
so i was in class for about two days and couldn't get this and i set my alarm to 2:27 A.M. and started watching this and by 2:35 A.M. i was unstoppable. *textbooks are a waste
Yo. would appreciate it if you could point out the counting of hybridized orbitals needed because all i see is a clenched fist without knowing what your counting was referring to. Thanks!
dude youre awesome love your vids,hope whatever job you do youre well paid
awesome video! thanks so much for the help!
My life is now complete
we need more guy like this in my college
Thank you
so when we think about orbits, only sigma bound count, likeif there is 3 sigma, it is a sp2, 4sigma(C-HHHH) that will be sp3 and 2 sigma is like sp right?
thanks that helps me alot
My saviour.
Thank you so much, this is so clear now!!!
can somebody explain plzz :(
i just couldnt get the thing about single carbon bonds
thank you so much ! i finally could understand it!
Thank you so much!! Why can't more teachers be like this??!
i dont get it ...
why it is sp^3 ? where is 3 come from ?
thanx man.this thing helped me out alot
dude thank you u made it so dam clear hahah
god bless this video! you dont know how much it helped me. im now 100% confident im gonna pass my exam
This just cleared up something that my professor and my Supplemental Instructor could not explain to me clearly! After watching this video everything makes so much sense!
thank you for this clear explanation
could you give an explanation on the structure of pi and sigma bonds. and maybe how these bonds can form with other atoms. Thanx
could you give an explanation on the structure of pi and sigma bonds. and maybe how these bonds can form with other atoms. Thanx
YOU ARE THE REAL MVP MAN I SWEAR
I thought i know more then you
You don't know any thing about these bonds.... You know 'O' makes double bond But you can't explain that how it's make 2 bonds.... I thought even you don't know the About (VBT)....If you know make video on it.... Thanks for half knowledge
Good job!! i totally understand what he said,it is very helpful!!!
Thank you so much! That was so easy to follow and very well explained.
Great explanation man. Huge help, thanks a lot for the time you put into this video
Hello I have a problem u have shown the 2s electron paired.So how can paired electron take part in bonding. Please reply
Thank you so much . Finally i understand this!!woowoo
why is it sp3 when 2 electrons comp from the s subshell and 2 electrons come from the p subshell? please help :(
You're a great man Nate, learned exactly what I needed in this video
This is amazing...
THANK YOU SO MUCH
Couldn't the textbook say uhhh EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID -_-
how does a free electron pair affect the hybridisation?
Genius. Made it so simple.
omg I love you LOL thank you!!!!
@ 3:56 he draws 4 bonds with upward spin, shouldn't one be downward just as it was in the 2s orbital, due to Paulie exclusion?
He moves his hands too much. You should do a face reveal
Thanks you so much, i have been trying to wrap my head around this and concept for ages now to no avail. I'm finally starting to understand thanks to you! :)
My chemistry teacher tried explaining this for over an hour and no one in my class understood anything. The textbook is even more complicated. I learnt what sigma and pi bonds were in just 2 minutes into this video and I was surprised to see that it is actually very simple. It's sad that teachers and textbooks are so bad at explaining something like this.
stop over enunciating everything im not a rere
THANK U SO MUCH, you have no idea how helpful this was...now I can master this topic..thumbs up on this video
thanks a lot my nigga, much appriciated
the best explanation so far !
May I ask.... Covalent bonds hybridise while the ,ionic ones don't... Cuz the are ionised and thus distort the purity and equality of a pure organic compound with only carbon and hydrogen... And in the first example u stated.   We had chlorine and fluorine attached to the organic compound... So do we still have a pure hybrids? Or distorted ones?!
you re the best!!!!!!!!!! thank you so damn much. susmithaa
thanks for the video. it is really easy to understand. =D
Thank you very much man!! it's really helpful video
Thank you so much for this video!
Thank you. You explained this idea better than my professor ever could.
Why are teachers and textbooks so uselessly dense? People need to be more clear like this guy.
What if there are lone pairs on the central atom?
Honestly, thank you so much.
lol I feel like I'm watching someone who does a lot of sign language try not to do it out of habit
You make chemistry so much easier. Thanks for these GREAT videos!
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS VIDEO!!! I was really having trouble with this concept until I saw your video :)
I haven't quite figured it yet but it's due to my lack of previous knoledge. But I'll get there. You explain it very well.
Good explanation :)
that hand movement lmao
How would it be 4 sigma bonds? Wouldnt it be 7 sigma bonds???
your a treasure Nate
thaaank you so much .
EXPLAINED SO WELL!!!
Fucking blessed video thanks man!
Thank you for the explanation and the examples! I feel better about my homework now. Thanks!!!!!!
Thank you Nate, im a Biology Major and Chemistry just doesnt come to me as easily as Bio hahaha
it took me way to long to realize that s stood for sigma and p stood for pi....
Really easy to understand. This will stick with me longer than whatever my teacher taught me 3 months ago
you made it so easy !!!
great explanation in the beginning but you lost me at 3:50 think I need to re-read my orbital assignments!
I was catching up on my notes for my Organic Chem class, and the lecture slides from the professor were confusing, so thank you VERY MUCH for this, you explained it very well.
best chem teacher ever!
can u tell me about IF7
that was really helpful
BRO THIS HELPEED ME SO MUCH THANKS
wow-you saved my life! THANK YOU
it all makesssss senseeeee nowwwww
I LOVE YOU CHEMIST NATE! Great job.
You do a beautiful job explaining things. VERY clear!!!!!!!!! Thank you.
i have been staring at my book for 2-3 days and procrastinating every time i see the phrase sigma or pi bonds. thanks to you i realize that this is quite an easy concept to learn. hopefully you have a video out explaining molecular orbital theory since that's the next beast i intend on slaying.
Wait a second... Wasn't the lowest bond being the sigma? Why in 6:13, the higher bond becomes the sigma? It doesn't mind? Or mistake or... Well... I wish someone gives answer
Omg! You make it so simple! You save my life! Thank you! :')
thanks a lot ,now i understand  carbon dioxide structure
GREATEST HYBRIDIZATION VIDEO EVER
What about James Bond?
This was a great explanation, thank you!
Thank you Based chemistNATE!
subbed, thumbed up, commented. You're a life saver. GOD BLESS YOU NATE
This was helpful, thanks!
thank you so much!!! i didn't know it was this easy.. our prof made it so difficult for us :)
Gosh it's like you untwisted my brain
idgi
Thanks man.
tommorrow is my exam, i had being trying to understand this concept for about a month but wasn't successful. You saved my life man. Kudoos!!!!!!!!111
YOU ARE A LEGEND!!!!
thank you! you're amazing
This was incredibly helpful, thank you!
Make sense! Thant make so much more sense~ Thank u(^__^)
If only profs made it this straightforward, rather than try and guide first-year students into the very heart of the theory itself, they might do better. Thanks for simplifying it Nate.
Thank you!!
You are a fucking g my man,
this is amazing, you sir, are a genius.
Do you have a video about conjucated pi system?
Clearly explained!! Great video!
wow...my chem proffesor didn't even tell us that and im over here struggling to figure out how to tell.. THANKS!!
THANK YOU SO MUCH
very clear! it took you 30 seconds to explain something that took my professor 1 hour to explain. LOL. thank you!
Thanks a lot mate. My lecturer didn't explain them that well.
Thanks god, very good explanation, I got it now.
Why not they just add those two sentences : "Sigma bonds are the FIRST bonds to be made between two atoms. They are made from hybridized orbitals. Pi bonds are the SECOND and THIRD bonds to be made. They are made from leftover "p" orbitals."  in text book.
Please upload a video telling how many sigma and pi bonds are there in salicylic acid.
I almost cried for how good you explained this. Thank you very much.
super confusing
Dude you're a fucking genius
OHMYGAWD IT MAKES SENSE
Oh hey look I might not fail chemistry now
chemistNATE: You da bomb
This is really tough!!!!
That was probably the best, simplified and precise explanation I could ever have on all the sigma and pi bond stuff. I finally got it now.Thank you SO MUCH. You knew how to explain it clean and clear!
that was amazing!!!! finally i understand this. now it's too easy :D
Awsm xplanatn .. Thnx sir..
no sound?
At 4:53 how come there's 3 sigma bonds when he put the placement for sp^2 while for the single C molecule had 4 placements for sp^3?
????
So helpful!
Awesome dude, my book AND prof. suck!
Still don't get it
Omg thank yoh I have a test tomorow and u saved me thank you!!!!!
love you
thanks you did a great job and ill use this as i teach chem. just nice and clear, thanks.
This guy is one of the best teachers on youtube. LOL I just find the hand gesturing so unnecessary. Incredibly concise and accurate explanations though.
OMFG! This just saved my life. You are awesome as hell!
Awesome! My teacher explained everything so fast that I couldn't follow properly. I look forward to work with your channel :)
thanks for the video =D you explained better than my professor ever would.
Thank you so much! Life saver!
I wish you could be my teacher though out my journey in pharmacy school. You explain things so simple. Keep up the good work. Please ignore any negative comments people may post because you are the best. PLEASE BELIEVE!!!
Thank you!
Your fucking awesome bro. Im in O-chem and ahead of this concept, but never fully visualized it. You just did for me. Thank you.
awesome review. thanks man
good job explaining but whats up with the hand movements?? yikes
Well explained.  Thank you :D
Such a great explanation!!! Better than any other website or textbook!
Thank you! much clearer than the what I was told in class :)
thanks this helped alot
You're awesome. This makes so much of sense now :)
Very helpful thanks
Thank you very much
I'm grateful for this, you really helped me. I wish I could also talk like you because I tend to choke when I'm explaining something to another person.
I could not finish your video.  The hands are too distracting.
A very good video
great video helped a lot
Very helpful
So much easier to understand than Khan's!! :D Thank you shhooo much!!
excellent video! thank you!
Keep up the hand gestures. it's really helpful
This is an awesome video, explained so well!
Awesome thanks :)
awesome stuff man
Excellent explanation. Thanks you!
Thank you sir!
thanks for this , it is not explained this way in my book! this makes it more clear to me. Always good to have a new perspective.
1:58 But what does that even meeeaaan, is the real question. Something we should ask about everything.
thanks!
I feel dumber knowing that almost everyone understood this nonsense.
Your hands distracted me but all is forgiven since you are why I'll pass my exam tomorrow!!!!!!
Great teaching and Canadian accent. Thanks brother
Oh thanks! I was starting to get confused. That was helpful.
simply awesome.
OH THANK YOU JESUS!  I finally get it.  Thank you sir.  You saved my exam... you saved the day.
Thank you so much for posting this video! It was so clearly explained. I really appreciate that you went slowly, step by step. It made it very easy to understand. :)
I can see clearly now the rain is gone!
omgg i love you and owe you one !
Very helpful that you go slow and make sure to point out every little thing and don't skip anything. Very helpful, thank you!
Thank you.You are a wonderful teacher=)
Thanks alot that was really helpful
Your "hand talking" is hilarious . Lol but your videos are super helpful though.
Super helpful Thanks for posting the video.
you heard it folks, aint no fictions
Great explanation .. simple and straight forward .. thanks :)
EXTREMMMMMMMELY useful video. so easy to follow and very straight forward :)
Them hand movements xD, great help though.
thank you thank you thank you
Thank You! The first video about Hybridization I actually understand!
"ain't no fictions"  I gotta say this from now on.  Thanks man!  For your help, that is… and your quote!!  Teehee:P
this is great thank you!!! :)
thank you,, very well done!! I really like the way you explain.. we need people like you in this world!!
explained very well
thanks but why do you do that thing with your hands? i don't get it
holy crap thank you
thank you!
Lol your hands are a bit distracting BUT I can say this was one of the best explanation of the sigma/pi bonds I've ever heard
Great video but keep your hands out of it! Distracting :p
Thanks!
Thank you! very clearly explained.
Chemist NATE, I LOVE your videos!!!
Your amazing! You teach me more than my high school teacher lol
amazing!
Finally I understand this. Now I just need to remember a bunch of other crap and I'll be ready for mid-terms.
Thank you!!! This makes much more sense now
Thanks for the help I really appreciate it!
Thanks u r the best ever :)
This is the only video that helped me undertsand this kind of chemistry language. Not even Brainstorm helped me.
Your hands are distracting....
I swear those hands gestures...best thing in the video.
Thanks! Your voice sounds like Ryan Reynolds which made your video even better!
Thank you so much! I didn't understand orbital hybridization very well and this cleared everything up for me!! You are a great teacher!
why does he need to have his hands in the video
Super clear, thanks :)
would you say this is organic chemistry? or more so general chemistry knowledge?
I love your hand gestures
These hands are very good at explaining things
thank u very much... u've been helpful
Wats up with this buddies hand motions
Excellent, you just explained what would've taken me forever to read. Thank you very much!
hey why don't you include bonding atoms on the left when you explained single and double bonds?
"check this out" teaching style was great and it all makes sense now, thanks!!
excellent explanation
Great!!!
The hand gestures definitely made the video
he literally just explained in 8 minutes what took my prof to explain in one hour
hybridization finally make sense to me thank you!!
So Clear
Why our teachers do NOT explain it that way?? Thank you! :)
Legend at work! Won't be able to answer those complex high-school questions without the help of this. Teachers told me about the sigma and pi bonds, what hybridization is and all but they never told me a simple fucking thing which is - how they ACTUALLY KNOW carbon hybridizes in different compounds the way it does. Thanks! :)
really really thanks
..........You.........You are amazing. I have a test on this on Tuesday and I literally had ZERO idea of what I was doing. Why in the HELL didn't my teacher explain it like this?!
Felt like it was the Joker teaching me Chemistry.
This gets right to the point and clears everything up! thank you
I'm still wondering why the fuck professors don't explain ANYTHING like this. WHY.
why do you ignore the Cl and the hydrogen on the left...aren't they still attached to  to carbon?
Awesome video chemistNate. God bless you and your family.
Thank you so much sir
the gesturing is a bit over the top there nate
I'm so glad I've found you!! You literally saved me! THANK YOU
id love to get a handy from you
yooo this replaces 2 hours lectures
Your hands are a tad ridiculous...
Just a word of advice, your hand motions in front of the papers can be a bit distracting, but the content and how you explained it was top notch.
OMG Thank you so much! I get it now!
What about the other hydrogen and chlorine (in the double bond)?
5:13 WHY is it acceptable to not follow hund's rule??
seriously, with the ability to go back and edit, add notes, or anything!, all you youtube people trying to explain hybridization COULD DO A LOT BETTER!
Is it me or do his hands look animated?
hobo tier educations received, thanks you
why isn't there another sigma bond in the double bond part , where there is a carbon-H and Carbon - Cl bond?
First bond is not always a sigma bond. Exception is C2(diatomic carbon) in which both bonds are pi and there are two sigma lone pairs. Visit website: chem.vander-lingen.nl/articles/The_C2_case/id/126/itemid/638 Thanks.
you have no idea how much this helped, i spend 2 nights trying to figure this out on my own and i got it in 8 mins with your video. Thanx again!!!
Thank you!! This explains it very well! Gonna be watching a lot of your videos for Ochem!
I just might pass that Orgo exam! Thanks :)
Chemical hand sign language
A pi bond can't b formed in d absence of sigma bond but sigma bond can b formed in the absence of pi bond. Pi bonds overlaps sideways which forms 2 sigma bonds there and S orbitals can't have pi bonds because of their shape!
I love you!
Thanks man! hope you're a teacher somewhere. we need you out there.
Thanks that was very helpful
You got me through chem 1 & 2 last year, but now you need to become ochemistNATE for the next eight months as I conquer ochem.
What the heck?! In 10 seconds you explained something my organic chemistry professor has been blathering about for two lectures. Why the devil do they use all those confusing diagrams in academia?? College is stupid.
I've been working on an understanding of this for 30 years!! You have added to this understanding! Thank you.
Only the first bond can be sigma. This is because of the way it creates a sigma (single) bond, which is a straight line from one atom to another. In carbon and other atoms, sigma bonds form between HYBRID orbitals. Double and Triple bonds at always pi bonds. They form only from leftover p orbitals ... never from hybrid orbitals. They form in the area AROUND the first (sigma) bond.
I watched this vid twice, still didn't get it. I understand the single and double bond but the triple bond is just suddenly like hokus pokes. the text book even more confusing. can you please explain differently?
good video still didnt understnd hybridzation clearly
You sir! Are a fucking legend
thanks so much!! after hours of watching youtube videos i have finally understood hybridation!! all i needed to know was exactly HOW to create hybridized molecules!! THANKS SO MUCH
Fantastic! been through chem videos but I thoroughly understood hybridization from this. Clear, concise,
THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU EXPLAINED IT VERY WELL!
clearly explained! thanks.
thank you so much for this video (and all your other videos!) my roommate and I have used them all to get through college chemistry, and they have helped so much!
hehe you are not smart then xD
the first second of this video helped me already.
Man, I'm pretty fuckin' smart and I don't get any of this shit.
American and Canadian teachers>international teachers. God damn.
This video FINALLY made me understand what the notation actually means. Thank you so much.
GOD THANK YOU, everyone else was beating around the bush with other info i didn't NEED!
ChemistNate (though I'm inclined to calling you NerdNate) could you please explain the use of Hybridisation in UV Visible spectroscopy. Thanks in advence
lol i thought there was a fly on my computer.
My instructor went out of her way to make this impossible to understand. You cleared it up in under a minute. You da man!
I just undrstud wat I ddnt undrstnd 4 weeks in just 8 minutes. Thnx man. Man u don't sleep, I mean the time was 11:30 pm whn doing tht
you are the best tutor ever. Your explanations are precise and easy to get. thank you.
I was looking over notes for hours and didn't get what sigma and pi bonds were... I learned from you within half of this video. Thank you!!
thanx a lot
Nice video. You would also make a good Chemistry Rapper.
Made a difference after 10 seconds of watching, I know where to go for chemistry help now
My teacher explained this in class for 2 hours and i did not get the concept. Seeing this video, it cleared my doubts. Thanks
my teacher explained this to me twice and still didn't have a clue what he was talking about..you are a genius, it took me 8 minutes to learn something which looks pretty complicated! - many thanks :)
Thank you so much! You saved me!
Hey, why is it called PI and SIGMA bonds?
Thanks! So helpful.
Thank you so much. This is the first video on hybridization that I'm actually comprehending and learning 100%. 10/10 for you, sir.
thank u so so so much! im starting to understand sigma n pi bond although not fully but i think i should be able to figure it out if i keep replaying the video. this is really helpful =)
THANK YOU!!! These short 8 minutes made more sense than my 50min lecture! Life saver :)
I watched several videos on this specific topic. ChemistNATE, by far, has the best video out of them all. Thanks so much, this helped me a ton!
YOU ARE AMAZING THANK YOUUU
so helpful! hand motions got a litttle bit annoying but hey helped a bunch thanks :)
Marry me(:
Interesting channel! :)
Woah awesome! Best hybridization video I've found yet! I'm definitely coming back :D
Thank You so much ..I understand your video more then my professor lecture.. !!! Iam sure I will pass my exam..
Passing Chemistry is now an option for me. Thank you SOOO much for these videos. I currently have a D in there and spending the past couple days on these videos... Tomorrow I'm certain I can pass our chapter test. Thank you :)
Nice. Everyone, this is my official announcement: SpocksToupee is a boss.
And thus begins ChemistNates Empire ;)
Please show molar mass :D
I never understood chemistry in school. Thank you for breaking down the matter in such an elemental form.
Please a video about CRISPR! You are great!
I am grateful for your valuable video. Please keep up your great work. You are making awesome informative video. I just subscribed your channel, liked it and looking forward for your next informative video.
Atom is a sanskrit word for shortest time period or smallest particle. This concept was created much earlier than Democritus.
Cool!
Finally I have understood
Second question is why I clicked on this.
Great animations and clear explanations. Excellent video
And how did they know they would be looking at one atom and that it would be right in the middle wow.
We still don't know the smallest particle.
Wow i watched this with my dad and this is AMAZING!
What an excellent break down. Thank you!
What happened to your channel?
I was talking to my gym partner who is a devout Christian and he said there is no such thing as atoms and that intelligent design is true. So now Im wondering how we know atoms are real.
This is a most excellent video. I can’t wait to use this in my classroom!
Excellent video, ??
I'm curious how small things can really get, and how do we know when we're seeing the smallest thing versus when our equipment just can't detect/ measure any smaller...?
Jaber ibn Hayan wasn't Arab though
1st time on youtube a french name is not buchered ( Jean Perrin ) Great video !
Thank you for speaking clearly. :Liked and substibed.
Atoms are thought to be a good example of God's Trinity. Atom is a unit indivisable and indestructable, It has also three names electron proton and neutron. But we dont say them three atoms.they found everywere. God is also said to be trinity (three divine persons) in unity. Its trinity named called the father, the son and the holysprit. They are not three Gods because there is a perfect oneness between them.As atoms are every were and God is also found every were even in up the space. In my orthodox christian church those colors green yellow and red shown in the hydrogen atom, are represented Trinity. Thanks.
I like this video so much, but I miss some part about crystallography.
Could you make a video about Hebb‘s postulate and the evidence for it? I would be very grateful if you did
Which software you use to make videos?
This was amazing! Love your vids...I personally believe Chemistry over Physics will eventually explain the origin of life. Would love to see some vids on how accurately scientists can determine beta decay rates in order to apply the technique to radiometric dating.
That was FANTASTIC
If you liked this video, search youtube for "A boy and his atom" and watch an animation using real atoms :)
Awesome! About the game that looks cool.
Great video
I'm preety sure there were also philosophers in India who theorised about things being made up of elemntal atomic particles. I imagine people in China and elsewhere were doing the same. If I'm right and not remembering wrong, they should be mentioned rather than focusing only on Democratus.
I wish you would have explained Jean Perrin's experiments
But, what the hell does that bloody bell do if I click it? It will send a notification to my email. Ok, but to see that notification I have to log onto my email adress! Isn't it easier to browse the YouTube subscription page and see what's new, rather than rely on that bell ? I am subscribed to hundreds of channels .... getting a notification for each video would drive me crazy. Is it really so hard to stop asking to click that goodam bell and let your subscribers decide whan to watch the new published videos. Seriously, I'd love to hear this from a YouTuber ..... hey, Stated Clearly , how many channels are you subscribed to and from how many of them do you receive notifications? None, right!? I though so.
Wonderful thank you for this video
I don’t understand how John Dalton’s experiment with compound ratios resulted in his theorizing the concept of atoms.
Very well presented video. Loved it. Thank you.
nice hitch quote
Fuck achool, show me youtube videos like these and ima get an A in calculus
Transmission electron microscopes have the capability to see atoms too!
Nicely done. Good work: thank you!
i learned a lot from this channel and it helped me a lot .. thanks a lot for your awesome work
Light is a Particle, called a photon. Very small. not a "wavelength". Ask Richard Feynman. Adjust your quantum mechanics please.
This beautifully sums up how science works. Our universe is far beyond what we can imagine.
woooooooooow i never know ppl finally found out how to look atom
Nice video, thanks. As a bonus, you've got all the french names perfectly right ;)
woooooooooow man..
This channel is soo underrated....
I wouldn't call potato cam proof or aliens might be real too
Shut up and take my subscription!
368 Billion likes
Adams exist....nooooooooooo it's Atom not Adam!
I'm a little confused about how the atom is being "seen". I mean it's just a bunch of electrons buzzing around a nucleus....shouldn't it look more strange than a shaded circle. Like a shaded circle doesn't seem to make sense at all......
Whoa man.
This video is great. You could have gone further and explained how we know the structure of an atom. I just really like the Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment. :D
Amazing video. I didn't expect it to go into as much detail and history as it did, but that was a great trip from the beginning ideas of atoms to the modern proof of their existence, summed up very well in only 12 minutes
Ive always wondered this.
Excellent video. I love how you encourage critical thinking as well. We shouldn't just accept the theories being spoon fed to us. We should demand to see what evidence there is to support said theory. I'm curious though: was there a reason Rutherfords gold foil experiment wasn't mention? I thought that experiment was pretty mind boggling and also suggested that atoms exist and that matter is mostly empty space.
you are too good, if i had teacher like you in school i would be scientist now.
I discovered this video to tell my fellow's
I love these little science vids. Very informative.
very useful video
you explain stuff in microscopic level which is good for us.
WoW what an amazing video, great work!
Great video. Audio is a little harsh though.
I think and scientists think that atom which made of electrons protons neurons And protons and neutrons made of quarks and may be those quarks made of smaller thing, therefore maybe there is no end and you can cut an apple forever and ever
Quantum mechanics says atoms don’t exist. Every “atom” is just a wave probability function that becomes an “atom” once it’s observed. #stepup
Do you have a team to translate your videos for spanish and portuguese? Need help on portuguese?
Nice job man, this channel is one of the best.
c.8.55 - Is it still light if the wavelength is shrunk to the point where it can be scattered off the sample?
Needed information, please give more info on atoms!
Even when you know what atom is, it's still so fascinating to watch this video.
So, essentially Democritus didn't actually refer to Atoms as we know today. He was referring to something beyond Electrons, Protons and Neutrons. May be Energy Strings or something beyond.
I'm Muslim Shia Zaydi THUMBS UP for Jabbir Ibn hayan R.A :)
Good thing I'm not made of atoms. ??
are you fucking trying to explain the atom without mentioning Bohr and Rutherford? what kind of retard would do that? also, one of your "science advisors" wanted to be a part of your video... how humble of him.
???? ???? ?? ????? ????? ????? ?????????? .. ????? ???
Thank you very much. Insightful videos like these makes me even more excited to be alive.
41 dislikes from people who still can't understand a simple & well explained video.
next video plzzz...?
Hitchen’s razor... so cool.
I believe Atoms are just our different multiverses, but I know some smart ass will probably shoot my hypothesis down lol
Pah! Filthy atomist propaganda neglecting the true understanding of electromagnetism.
Fantastic - thanks for this video, subscribed
Thank you for uploading. Wonderful informative video. I will stay curious.
Loved it! Thanks
Cool, with solid foundation and really understandable. Going to watch the full series for sure. Really mean that, thumbs up and all the stuff ... But wait ... I'm a physicist. Wasn't there a part about being undevisable? We can split atoms can't we? Well, guess that's where physics and chemistry happily each go their own ways. Hope to see something about Avogadro in your series too!
4:26 dihydrogen monoxide ??????
Great and easy to understand videos, thanks to your superb animations. I would highlight the number of 92 elements, because these are the ones we find in nature. The number of artificial ones keep going up. Interesting is also that chemists accepted the concept of an atom much earlier than physicists. Physicists only got convinced once they started to unravel the fine structure of the atom in the early 1900s.
Your content is worth subscribing to, so I have
My school uses all of your video
Your premise that the atom is the final stop of matter, the 'fundamental building block', or as you said 'tiny indivisible units' is a practical approach to life and physics but doesn't, unfortunately, reflect current understanding of 'matter'. Atoms are the basic building block (of ordinary matter), but are themselves composed of protons and neutrons, which are themselves composed of 6 types of quarks--up, down, top, bottom, strange and charm. Electrons are currently considered the smallest, fundamental particle, having a resting mass 1/1,836 of a proton. This is of course part of the standard model of particle physics--within which there are a number of, as yet, unresolved problems. It would seem that even 2500 years after Democritus, we still aren't quite certain how it all works.
Nice to see there are people who knows atoms are flat. There are funny people who thinks atoms are like balls because you know everything have to be similar to their balls.
Awesome!
Atoms are fundamental building blocks of matter, not chemistry. Chemistry is the study of matter. You cannot create a "study" out of atoms.
Jon Perry? Jean Perrin? That can't be a coincidence ??
Wow, this video was great, I’m so glad I found this channel. Subscribed!
Wow. The title is appropriate. Stated Clearly. It really is. These videos are great. The REAL waste of time is NOT watching it.
Nice work.
if you zoom into an atom you will find out thats it made of other smaller spheres, and if you zoom into one of these spheres you will find out yet again its made of other smaller spheres, and so on, forever and ever, same things happens if you zoom out of the universe
I still don't know what it actually is though. Like, what does a proton or neutron actually consist of. I know they have up and down quarks but what are they? I know we know how they interact and that they have spin and stuff but what actually are they, do we even know?
cool
Atoms themselves are made of smaller pieces, how small can things be? I'm annoyed by both the limit of how small things can be and the idea of things going infinitely small.
I clicked this to make sure you would be accurate. Good job.
Subhanallah We have this written in our book(quran) from1440 years
I did fkin subbed ! love the contents ??
I have 2 Questions re the "Image" of the Nitrogen Atom 1) Why don't we see the Orbital Shapes of the Electrons ¿ 2) Has the Very act of looking at it Collapsed those Orbitals, if so why doesn't One see Individual energy packets of those Vibrating Strings ¿¿¿ xxxx ??
I'm Gunna poison myself now on Dihydrogen Monoxide
Shocking! An atom is a circle lol.
Thanks
Really? Quarks and "blank?" were too hard to mention? It's blank to me because of you.. I don't know what it is, and I don't know how to google it to find out because I don't know.. Your Laziness has ruined my knowledge. And I thought electrons were in probable locations and not definitive? So much half information here, I'm so confused
I will blindly accept everything on the internet as fact. I believe you looked up the atomic radii of the elements for your illustration at 7:26. It looks really close to reality
great vid. however, it would be great to know why the wavelength of light prohibits the measurement of things smaller than it. What's the reasoining behind that?
This is incredibly exciting!! I wish people I knew gave a shit!
So alchemists were correct in the idea of nuclear fusion & fission but didn't have the energy calculated correctly to change the lead (82) to gold (79) like in the works of Glenn Seaborg?
Nice vid, Squeeze earth and its will be not larger as a golf ball and it weight exactly how it where before.
If that was a atom where were the electrons? The photon from the light should have collapsed the wave form of the electron but it's not visible in that picture..... Ignorant me: what do atoms look like....? Scientists: since we're so smart we have a picture of one for you. Ignorant me: wow, yo, that's well cool like. Hey, this atom doesn't have any electrons...... What you guys trying to pull?
Fun fact to understand the size of atoms. If you wanted to see the atoms of an orange, you would have to expand its size to that of the Earth, then each atom would be the size of a child's glass marble.
Very nice! Just one additional point about the history of imaging atoms – AFAIK, the very first such image goes back to the 1950's, using the then new, field ion microscope. The cover of Scientific American for July ( or was it June?) 1957, features a picture of tungsten atoms forming the tip of an extremely fine needle, using this technique. The newer techniques covered here, have, however, advantages over the FIM, including a wider range of elements whose atoms they can image. Fred
3:17 What does "no matter how hard the couple tried, however, they could not reduce hydrogen or oxygen"? What does "reduce" mean in this context?
Thank you so much. I'll love to have this animations available in spanish.
mind blown
"...atoms can now be seen...." , 0:55 min. Wow ! That's some statement right there. I wonder if it is meant to misinform , if it's done on purpose , if that's what you really believe ? And if you truly believe that , why the need to present it not as an opinion but as a sure fire fact ? A computer generated image is just that, a computer generated image. Should we go ahead presenting as a fact that the Na'vi can now be seen therefore they are real ? I believe you got carried away like many other science fans and even well known scientists. For many of them the notion of a scientific model lost it's meaning , everything is certainty now ,hard facts , etc. Yet pride always comes before the fall , how come that we can afford to forget that ?
I had no idea that atoms are square with labels on them. But I believe it.
you don't know the younger Albert Einstein at the first time of asking (I know a joke) or don't know exactly how to pronounce french names, that's all alright but the fact that you wouldn't mention the name of Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev in this vid is beyond shocking...
The ancients knew so much more than what we let on. Understanding the micro they moved mountains.
That was an excellent video. I think you convinced me that atoms in fact, do not exist. That little gray ball was absolutely not an atom. It was perhaps a representation of the data that came from an actual indivisible particle of matter, but definitely not a "picture" of an "atom". I mean it's not entirely clear that an atom is any more than a wave function or a probability. Once again, nice video though!
But how did they know when they split Hydrogen and Oxygen from water they were two separate elements? What made them think that, was it the color or smell? and how did they manage to physically separate the two after the reaction took place?
thanks for telling us that now we can see atoms because i always thought we can not see it and whenever i ask my teacher about it they would say that atoms are their because some scientist say it is there and that what they had been thaught and now teaching to others.
I'm so happy when I discover science channels on youtube!
The splitting of the atoms following our accumulated knowledge has undoubtedly changed the world we live in forever. What followed were laws like the Inverse Square Law. What most do not know or never continued the study of this law is that there is one stipulation of its use. This law does not apply to an extended source of radiation (like Fukushima and Chernobyl). Interesting enough this law is used in the process of calibrating geiger counters.....which by following the stipulation of this law a geiger will not get the correct readings from an extended source point of radiation.
I want to cut that atom in half so bad!
BUT WAIT! Why didn't you talked about Thomson, Rutherford, Bohr and Schrödinger? :(
You forgot all the isotopes..
Very nice, I really like the concise history. But we still have never seen an atom, just data arranged to represent light scattering off an atom. Still amazing though.
How does it work?
we need more channels like this. thank you
Atoms should be renamed.
Please have fewer "jokes". Jokes obscure, throw off the thinking train. Awesome content thank you !
It was a warm summer evening in ancient Greece ...
nice vid
You’re very very likable the information is stated clearly!!!!
very very great video i loved it.
Now this is an underrated channel
Beautiful... Good that you'e back... :)
if you wanna see atoms the best way is to use electron scanning microscope
Has your mom still got aids?
Still not convinced.
Very Great
Awesome ! Thanks for the great info spoken with so much simplicity
you didn't mention Mendeleev, the creator of periodic table
Great job, explained very clearly. I assume the upcoming videos will be about subatomic particles and then about quarks or strings or quantum fields. There are many videos simply stating that these are the "fundamental building blocks of reality" or just "truly elementary particles" but they never explain what these things really are. I hope your video will give some insight in (for example) what a quark or neutrino actually IS. I can't seem to find any good explanation on that, so that would be great to have Stated Clearly :)
So great to see a new video, my son and I were going through withdrawal ?? We love the animations. Can't wait for the next three.
Ya done good.
I thought this video would list what atoms are made of including the God particle or Higgs Boson. We dont actually know at this level what an atom is and thus what matter is exactly. This would have been more useful and interesting. We basically don’t know what an atom is at the end ...
Why do you have such little views?! I mean, This channel is great!
New sub. Came from Non Sequitur.
Since the author has memorized the entire number of p, I don't need any more evidence. I believe everything he says.
Great great work!
Could you do a video on instinct as how it relates to the lifestyle of insects and other animals that do not raise or teach their offspring survival skills?
Indian also proposed about atoms . Check this if it is true ?
So much good stuff in this video. From the opening quip about "blindly accepting" your assertions, to the introduction of Hitchens' Razor, to the history of the theory of atoms, to incrementally building up evidence to a satisfying conclusion, this was a delightful production. You don't need my validation, but well done!
Jon, wow!! Phenomenal work here?? Will be sharing this far & wide!! Thank you ??
Wow! Beautifully demonstrated, articulated to perfection!
Indian's know it before 5000 year's
Loves these videos! Can hardly wait for the next one!
Just starting this unit with my chem students on Wednesday. I think I’m definitely gonna show this before teaching it. Thanks for the material!
Thank you for all of your videos, they are "Stated Clearly" enough for me to introduce my mother and nephews to evolution and science in general with easy to understand visuals.
But isn't the atom mostly empty space? and the nucleus and the electron cloud are far apart? I mean what are we exactly seeing here? Can some one explain please ?
this channel is so underrated.you deserve waaaaaaaaaaaaay more subs!!
Amazing
Are you sure it wasn't Egyptians that first came up with this theory?
Nice
Seriously, Still lying about atomic theory origins. It was sage Kannada who expounded the atomic theory of matter before any greek scientists. http://firstip.org/legendary-scientists/maharshi-kanada-the-propunder-of-atomic-theory600-bce https://detechter.com/the-concept-of-atoms-by-acharya-kanada/ His vaiseshika sutras or Aphorisms even contain all principles of motion later given by Newton. So called Arabic scientists just translated Indian texts and gave them their names like Indian numerals r known as Arabic numbers. This is why u don't find any arabic scientists nowadays also. Don't even want to go into how many calculus principles were developed centuries ago before Newton was credited with them.
Great video
WOW! such a beautiful and interesting video. I learned a lot.
It would be nice if you make a video about the shape of earth, flat or globe, and how we know it. Stated clearly.
This is an amazing and curiosity-inducing presentation.
Those aren't atoms, they're tiny little angels.
I think you've got compounds and molecules mixed up
Man, some Ancient Greeks were so ahead of their time.
Thank you!
Glad you're back!
Great one love it from Egypt <3 Can't wait for the next
I love this so much when I found out the confirm existance of Atom. I feel like I want to celebrate the successful discovery too! Plus, this video was uploaded on my B-day! I'm so happy about this!!!!
"Jon Perry" is suspiciously similar to "Jean Perrin". I will let someone else to come up with a conspiracy theory about this.
I love your channel. One of the best on youtube.
Stated Clearly, you have given my son and i such an in depth understanding of science. A beautiful and informative approach ! I look forward to everything you put out and will definitely contribute and donate more.
Why do atoms circular?
Our discovery of atoms and particles is a result of our inability to conceptualize infinity I wonder...
I’m a science major in college and I like this representation of the atom!
I'm taking chemistry right now and didn't want this video to end. Glad you are back !! So I'm assuming, that picture of an atom with their green / red color scheme... That the red is the nucleous and the green is all the orbitals electrons "may be"? I can't wait for that imagining to become better...
Oxygen and iron do not react to form rust; they react to form iron oxide. THAT IS NOT RUST.
I'm supposed to be studying for my science exam about atoms next week instead I watch this video and I learn more than school
JON PERRY YOUR A LEGEND U DID ALL THAT????? SCRIPT, NARRATION, ILLUSTRATION, ANIMATION! WOW! MAN IM SO APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR WORK KEEP DOING MORE, I WROTE DOWN MOST OF WHAT U SAID AND IT WAS SO BENEFICIAL THANK U!
Thanks for the great video. Just one small correction: Jaber ebn e hayyan was a Persian chemist who was born in Tus (east of Iran).
Well done. Thumps up!
Nice to see you back after so long. 6 dislikes from law students.
Finally
I love what you're doing. Everyone is always talking about the dangers of our modern technology, about internet addiction and unempathic Fortnite kids. Rarely however does one mention the benefits that come from our modern technology (alltough it is used everyday). Education needs to adapt to our modern day as well, and people like you are setting an example. Thank you for your hard work and keep up the good job.
It wasn't very revealing to confirm for the third time that atoms have the shape of sphere
I think you missed mentioning this one guy Mendeleev, he had something to do with that there table of elements....
Shite. Your videos are best at teaching this stuff! Thanks man! Also, are you on deviantart? The science community there would love to have you there.
great video as always but what's with the weird echo / low audio quality?
I just found this channel. Great stuff!
I thought this channel is about evolution
YOU STILL UPLOAD?! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
At least you are putting some kind of disclaimer down for hindu scholar but i have seen others just skip or don't know about it
Science, bitch!
Love it! As a chemistry major in college I am all about this!!!
Very nice video, got me subscribed
You missed the opportunity to show Einstein's observations about the Brownian movement. If you see particles of dust suspended in a gas or a liquid, they travel through an erratic path. If the medium was completely smooth and not made of particles, the dust should move in a straight line, but instead it moves in random directions, because it's being hit by particles.
This was perfectly stated.
Nice video. I already knew something about atoms, but didn't know the history... so, very nice animation and very well explained.
I love the way you use the phrase "building blocks of chemistry" rather than the way I learned back in the 1950's "building blocks of matter". Yours is way more accurate. Teaching is the process of passing knowledge on in a way that is understandable. If the student doesn't understand it, it's not teaching, just babbling.
Jaber abh hayyan id not arab... he is persian
Awesome video! See you next year
Democritus's argument for the existence atoms didn't have anything to do with matter's infinite divisability. It was a response to the argument ex nihilo nihil fit by Parmenides. Parmenides in his book physics argued that nothing comes from nothing, thus change is merely illusory. Democritus argued that the conclusion (change is merely illusory) doesn't follow from the premise (ex nihilo nihil fit) if the cosmos is made of indivisible units. The changes (growth, decay, etc...) that occur in nature are merely the rearranging of these indivisible units.
One "like" for Hitchens' Razor; but then you'd get a "like" from me anyway because of the topic and content.
Could you create a video on how we know what the earth's core is made of?
Serious question for you Jon Perry; would you be against me having your videos translated into Hebrew?
This is a good video.
Awesome video, thanks!
even though I already know most of this but I definitely learned few more things and the way you present it is just awesome and simplified and educational. it is stated clearly indeed. well done !
?? Thank you, Jon, for a most informative video. I came to much of this through a History of Science course that began with those so very clever Greeks! How they would marvel at the incredible advances we have made in examining the structure of an atom. Kindest regards from ???? and my companion ??
such a great video!!
tough topic done well
Awesome! I am looking forward to seeing next films :D
???? ???? ????
Best educational channel on youtube.
Can you get a better mic please? Would make your videos sound better!
9:00 stated blurry
lol how do i get that tshirt ?
thank you so much, i cant wait for the next one
Wow, that was such a great educational video! Yeah, actually photons are much tinier than an atom, but up until now I thought it's impossible to take a photoshoot of them, because, photons may add heat or energy to the subject atom(s), so it may just fly away or simply react with other atoms, thus creating something completely different, that we have recorded a fraction of a second ago.
You should probably put a link to your Patreon in the description. Amazing art and animation.
Nice Explanation ...right upto the last year 2017
Please don't stop making videos!
This is easily the best channel on YouTube, hands down.
Tune in next time for the follow-up question, asked by guest narrator Arnold Schwarzenegger: Who is your daddy and what does he do?
What does AD means after the year?? (Sorry for asking this my native language isn’t English)
Thank Darwin you’re back!
2:09 i would say muslim world rather than arab
I feel I'm getting smarter after every video.
Very clearly described. Very useful.
Awesome
It took me a semester at college(-$2000) to learn this.
Your animations are awesome. They help me learn soooo well because im a visual learner!
sweet! :D go science! :D
I’m glad that this video finally explained how we got to know what we know!
At 3:42 your periodic table makes the common mistake of putting La and Ac in the f-block at the bottom. They should be in the d-block (orange) below S and Y. I also disagree with coloring At and Ts as halogens. The halogens F, Cl, Br, and I are all diatomic, but At and Ts are not.
A proud moment for mathematics.
i was taught chemistry in school and college.. Never understood like I have now...I think even the teachers didn't know as much and precisely as in this video..
great science channel here, I recommended you to my chemistry teacher.
Everything cool until you have to skip many scientist that did contribute to the undrestanding of the atom to just push the video towards THE GREAT GENIUS OF ALL TIMES to be the one that let us silly humans to discover the atom. So typical conclusion... of all this videos of any science. Einstein did it again... bla bla bla
Ara Apkarian, more like Anna Kasparian.
2 dislikes??? probably literature students who have no idea about physics
Wonderful video. Perfect for my class. Thanks!!
This video causes existential crisis, great nevertheless
Fantastic, as always.
Really excited for the series
You uploading so few videos should be made a crime ??
I always feel like there's something science didn't figure out yet. Like some properties of atoms, that if know they would helps to predict chemical reactions with no need of testing.
Great video, but I'd like to note that you spelled the word Hydrogen as 'Hydogen' throughout the video.
Amazing video!!
Finally! A new video from Stated Clearly! Yuhuuuu!!!
wooow, nice recap :P more microscope things!! i saw a Video of cells one's yes,,,, microscope video
John I love your videos!
I love your videos, more please!
Love your videos! glad to see you back
1:00 You have a cute laugh. ??
0:45 That reverse psychology tho
I learn more with you than at school. xD
Awesome info!
Great video, as always! You're rare, but so awesome! ^^
Thanks for that. I don't speak english but I really like your videos because they help me improve my listening, and the next year I will study Biology at the university. I'll be waiting for your next videos.
I'm atomic!!!! Mwahahahah!
insanely good video. 10/10 animations
Beautiful ????
oh wow .. that saying about dismissing something without evidence is really good ... didn't know it before
Fantastic video! Thanks!
Atoms are themselves made of smaller pieces which cannot be divided more : they are called legos, they are the fundamental building blocks of life!
The EverQuest Quest turn in MUSIC??? Awesomeness
Sure atoms can also be split but they will lose theyr property. An atom of gold can't be called gold if it's split! It's just a bunch of protons and neutrons!
Woot. You are back :)
Wow. You are back!
Good info!!!
Very good video!
I was studying structure of atom when this was uploaded. .. What a coincidence! Nice to see you back and love this video! One question: According to the concept of subshells electron don't revolve but the present in electron cloud, and daltonian concept and structure was discarded. But that single N atom you showed us follows the daltonian structure. Does that mean shell structure is not true? I may have written something wrong since I'm only in high school and not really good on chemistry. Please forgive me if I did so
Great video!
Not hitchens razor, that is occam's razor, even though Christopher Hitchens (rest his soul) used it many times.
Awesome. Always glad to see a video from you, and the humor is always appreciated! Especially the video stats @0:54 ;)
Very nice to see you up and making content again! Thank you for the pleasant surprise. Awesome way to end my day.
How did the ability to see atoms not make the news
This channel is so nice wow
0:55 thats a lot of views and likes
Good video, but hitchen’s was an idiot.
Amazing, cant wait for next one!!
I'm a little excited!
Minor loss in sound quality compared to previous videos. Poorer recording equipment and/or noisier environment?
Good to see this again Jon. Really impressive.
Thank you for this
I love your work. You do take the channel's name rather seriously. :P Hope you can post more frequently in the future.
Nice to see you're back.
Finally a video
10:41 Huh, Ara Apkarian helped you on this. Neat.
So glad you're making more videos!
Thanks a lot bro ur tchng is superb
Love it!!!
How YOU doin'?
Appreciate what you're doing! You make learning more fun in one video than the totality of my time in highschool.
Great video as always, however there is a really small mistake: in ancient greek atomos is actually a singular noun. The plural is atomoi
????
Nice
Good
First
