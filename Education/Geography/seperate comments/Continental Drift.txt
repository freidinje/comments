In case any of you guys missed the post, I am current in the process of making yet another version of Continental Drift, this time it's the long-awaited reversed AND labeled version. In order to render the actual shapes of the continents without distortion (as presented in a projection such as this video's Mollweide globe) the video will be in VR and of course, 8K. It's the closest YouTube is getting to a website with an actual globe. The version will be based on paleomagnetic data wherever possible and a best guess if no data exists, as a result everything before 1 billion years will look different compared here. This is a developmental screenshot showing the reconstruction at 2.1 billion years. This is not how it will look in the final version. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/284792709846138882/480576663625793557/unknown.png

1:43 look up to the all green that like revresed britain
What the last period says?
4:54 this is how India was formed
Himalaya?
Crazy how India was part of Madagascar
Where asia but i saw my country
When Rodinia formed, Antarctica was landlocked continent.
Love It Names India
Agar.io
i call the continent at 1:00 britain in its big boy pants
Wait You Say White Parts Do Not Exist But Antarctica One Is White
Well,it's great My videos is is is Bad

How did Scandinavia form into such a weird place?
Miren a África... 4:40 Look of africa... 4:40
4:54: Madagascar is born.
Philippines didn't break on Indonesia it emerged 70mya and running towards asia
For viewers who have the time, follow Ur from 0:19 onwards. It contains pieces of Africa, Antarctica, Asia and Australia. Just keep your eyes on that little piece of land until it splits up at at 4:45 Why am I telling you this? Think about it, those 4 pieces were connected together the whole time for nearly 3,000,000,000 years and only then got separated. That's nearly two thirds the lifetime of the earth. That duration consisted of practically the entire history of multi-cellular life on Earth. It survived literally every supercontinent that ever existed in history! That final separation was kinda heart breaking.
Supercoll
Wow, so before land on earth is only 89%
The best ice age film of all
Bruh de earth isnt FLAT
Creating pangea
Great.
THAT WAS A FANTASTIC JOB! YOU MADE THE EARTH AND THE COUNTRIES ATTACHED TO IT!
Those are not continets you f**k! They are countries and you see my family where they live,australia,taiwan and philipines!
I didn’t know you made Columbia
4:57 and the dinosaurs are gone

Maybe my favorite video in all youtube
DEJA VU I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE HIGHER ON THE STREETTT
I forgot to show my class in grade 1 this video, because grade 1 term 3 is learning about history, now I’m grade 4
Why I love the song: •Fasanating •satisfying •relaxing And most importantly: SO JURASSIC Btw myr = Million years And idk what the r stands for
DEJA VU
no country has connected to the plate so that’s why it moving that quick
Pangea Split In To the 7 continents
vaalbara ur none kenorland arctica none atlantica atlantica/nena columbia none rodinia pannotia gondwana pangaea laurasia/gondwana laurasia none

North America looks like Iceland
666k views?
3:08 hey team what lets attack this little part of africa ok o shit africa run yes oh no they got me oh no they got me too africa gets raped by europe million years later
4:45 africa looks thicc
At 4:03 Africa formed.
4:20 plants started living on land. before that, all the continents were deserts
desinformacion. timo. buscad mejor teoria de la expansion de la tierra. expanding earth theory is the true
Pangaea supercontinent
eurasia it is just called asia and europe ;P
6:14 So all continents come back again?
Ur cool, Algol.
Biggest countries: 10: Algeria :9 khazthztan 8: Argentina 7: India 6: Australia 5: Brazil 4: China 3: USA 2: canada 1: Russia
When Afro-eurasia became supercontinent
I love that ending especially the music ?????
2:55 heh
4:41
Good animation
Earth is oblong , not circle..
That L shaped mass from Vaalbara hung around for a long time.
The music makes me cry joyful tears
1:41 was year 0 and the super continent was alantica
How to make this?
Kind of like Slither.io
Vaalbara,the smallest supercontinent
How long did it take you to research this?? I know it’s a hypothesis, but still, How’d you work it out?? I’m impressed! Going back 3.3 billion years!
So land is just mold on earth like milk?
ey man smart is the new sexy used your video without giving you credit just wanted to let you know
What is MYR?
4:45 Africa: Hey India! India: Sorry! Gotta Go Africa: No wait! India drifts away
The animation of 750 to 0 mya looks like a mixture of Chris R. Scotese's animations and the classic paleo animation.
What program do you use to make these vids?
This is good stuff
2:07 italy with no boot just a foot
What is Myr?
?????
Okay I’m not Australia I’m Thailand.
It's like watching fluids move around
Australia is emu at 4:53

FYI this video "Smart is the new Sexy" youtube channel used two of your animation without giving you credit here: https://youtu.be/0CMkwdv8d6U

Not real
Why not in future?
I dont understand why in the past all continents form a shit and now the form is very symmetrical, the continents now have specific form in much time.
The song reminded me of the 2012 Minecraft background song... Nostalgia
NANI?! CONTINENTAL DORIFTO?!
?? ?? ?? ? ? ? ? ??? ? ??? ? ? ? ??? ?? ? ??? ? ??? ? ? ? ??? ?? ? ? ? ? ? ??? ??
Great Video ??????! Keep up the good work!
Myr??? What dose “r” in myr mean
And in the in milions off years
what is your source for making this animation? Where are you sourcing the data?
Thanks so much I will the
Bruh you forgot asia
how about some predictions for the future
earth is sooooo young
Supercontinent U R i wonder what U R
I showed this to my class & teacher, they loved it!
the contient drift because of the moon moving away from earth slowly and its spin is slowing down
DEJA VU!
The Story of Ur- The Longest Surviving reconizable landmass. R.I.P. Ur: -3300 Myr - -1065. Sad Face.
1 Myr = What?
When that island on the SW joins Columbia at 1620 Myr, it looks like a pair of disembodied legs kicking.
I kept track of Ur; it became Sri Lanka, and these parts of Mozambique and Antarctica..
Canarias no esta en el mapa
bullshit
This one is better.
Olha o Brasil chegando
* tokio drift music *
What does myr mean
The earth is flat ??????
0:51 the first continent... Woah Edit:nvm 2:07 Is huge
Who else attempted to watch vaalbara the whole time?
Dpg mundo, mandou abraços
I like it, this is a fun video to watch!
Great
Haha Yeet.
Water: /exists/ Land Niggas: its free real estate
I directly paused at -0 Myr
1:04 Continental Dorifto
how do you play this on reverse?
1:59 The large North American and Eurasian chunks colliding in the middle look like North Korea and South Korea lol
Supercontinent is Afro-Eurasia
This is proof that the earth is flat!
this was acutually good tho tbh
i love playdoe
Next time make it round as earth is not flat ??
yeah, some of the people think that every continent is actually standing in one place, which is wrong. They do move from one to other and connect into one or cut into more, but we can't see it, because they move REALLY SLOW.
Before the France and UK was paste
They see me rollin'…
Imagine if humans were around when the first continent was being formed.
*Deja Vu by Initial D starts playing*
Can you put together this and the animation of the future......
What data are you using to construct this simulation?
this is amazing
Imagine if modern day science institutes existed back then. "Humans are contributing to continental drift, we need to start enforcing taxes upon everybody and shaming them for existing to stop this horror that could potentially wipe out all life on Earth!!!!! but before we do that, I need to fly half way around the world for the fifth time this week to lecture those fuckers in Europe about their carbon footprint."
Cool af
4:56 rip dinosaur in -68 years ago
if you cant drift the continent, then you are no drift king
Reeeet
How do they find where pieces pf our continents were that long ago
so Indonesia used to be a peninsula.
Where did all of that land come from after UR?
Very beautiful, thanks for sharing
America fuck yeah
The Philippines consists of over 7,500 islands. How many times has it been hit to break into those many islands!?!?!?
what other people says "THE EARTH IS FLAT"
DEJA VU !!
Where's the eurobeat
If you ever make another one of these please make Eurasia just Europe and Asia
NOW: Afro-Eurasia (Africa, Europe an Asia)
DEJA VU I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
Za za za za za za za za za
My social studies teacher told me that India used to not be a part of Eurasia.
Look!!! Earth spawn a land... Damn i love god
5:03 supercontinent euafrasia? europa + asia + afrika!
Vaalbara sounds like a province in the Elder Scrolls
flat earth confirmed
I would like for someone to create a spherical version
That indian subcontinent when collided to asian continent it formed the himalayas?! So thats the impact of collision of two land massess?
DEJA VU
5:02 1 myr..
Love the music! But especially the work that put in this!!
Antarctica antarcti
Columbia looks like Pangaea
God said: let there be dry lands.
if you want to chill , just watch this.
1:35 Great New Zealand
2:50 lol the "None" supercontinent
NANI?! CONTINENTAL DORIFTO??!
but im Christian. L0L
If time machines existed then i would send humans to -1021 myr ago
any og's from vaalbara here
4:28 SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA BORNS :}
nevermind
you forgot Pangea
Hoever,it got a cancer...
kew;
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this is NOT anything close to truth.
1:44 1987
My science teacher showed this to the class and I’m happy to find it :D
The earth is flat
If 'myr' means myrillion our earth is very very old
'Deja vu plays in the background'
Pangea?
IN THE FUTURE/UK: I win I never stuck to Pangaea /South East Proxima Pangaea:Aststralia will rise again some day
0:21 mom
Song name?
Where is panganea
1:10 the green looks like a guy with purple hair and a collar
The continent it's called America, and it's just one
All history of humankind is a pale flicker when being compared to the story of the planet.
L
This video makes me feel something....
0:18 when you cant think of a name for a supercontinent.
0:12 supercontinent: vaalbara
Fake lol and dumb this vid is only for kids
Cool
Astralia:No Way I am the first country in the world/ 1903 UK: Get killed Astralia/Astralia:NONONONONO /2019 UK:HELP ME /Astralia:Nope (:
What if you used Black as Europe, Algol?
Do you like my car ?
lmao wut they think the earth is an oval
2:00 Atlantica: Can we unite into 1 Continent? Others: Sure! Atlantica: Let's unite! The supercontinent Columbia is formed.
How does this work on flat earth?
Now that was wierd as fuck
From before the?
deja vu
Remember this for your history and science tests; North America was once larger than Eurasia.
I've been looking for this. Thank you!
Aglol, Please pangaea proxima #2
...never happened.
The earth is flat
Where is the eurobeat?? Because it says drift
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMuJxd2Gpxo Shoulda played this song.
Looks like, in the future, Africa will separate from Eurasia
5:00
Deja vu!!!
What did he use to make this
DEJA VU
omg its a flat earth...flat earth confirmed ohhh yeah!!!!
Make it a 3d video
??? ????? ??? ????? ??????
big lie
this is so relaxing
G L O B E
What if this Pangea was just 1 of the continents of a bigger planet that got hit and parts flew of into space, leaving a distorted gravity center and for that reason forced the continent to split and form like it is now around the new gravity center?
deja vu intensifies
can I ask: where are the north china block and the south china block
Can I use screencaps of this for an online lecture I'm doing? And if yes, how would you like me to credit your work?
Continental Drift but no walking it out like grannies
Eurasia? Do you mean Europe?
Song at begining?
now lets imagine the whole thing breaking apart again
How do continents drift? If they float, why don't sea creature swim under them.
That was beautiful.
the earth is flat ( ?° ?? ?°)
2:28 ??????? ?????? ?? ???????)
Australia used to be in the artic... what...
I am glad he didn’t skip from 3300 mya to 2250 mya.
So our super continents name today is none?
2:59 Supercontinent : First D*ck
R u an flat Esther?
you were meant to say at today Eurasia And The Americas.
This video is absolutely amazing, and then it seems like some people had translated your video into Chinese and used for commercial purposes, at least some parts of your video. I'm wondering whether that guy had ever asked for your permission, and whether his commercial usage has infringed your copyright. Maybe you should go and have a check, here is its Youtube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwgVuy0EKt0&t=42s; some other URLs in Chinese social network: 1. https://www.bilibili.com/video/av21422168; 2.https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35140043 . Best wishes and expecting more amazing videos.

The continent of Australia doesn't exist. Australasia is an alternate name of the continent of Oceania but still... IT'S AWESOME!
It all started with Africa and Australia (and a bit of Antarctica)
CONTINENTALYU DORIFTO?!?!?!!???!!!?!?
0:19 UR GUN, GIANT GUN CONTINENT, AN ISLAND WAS A BULLET OOOOOOOO
Nani? Continental dorifto?!
The Video : shows about the HIstory and story of earth , Me : WOOOAAAHHH IS THIS A NEW IO GAME?!? EARTH.IO!?
Islands began to form on earth and become continents.
Imagine if all this were to happen at the speed of this video?
4:09 Laurentia, Siberia, and Baltica are moving up.
3:09 It looks like a head
Maine!
Vaalgara???
Fast and furios xdcfxdxdgkvg
Looks like all lands of the earth are playing around. Lol
Fantastic!
Did anyone realize that indonesian have island shape K
DEJA VU!
I thought it's gonna be OZMA's song ??
This is proof the earth is flat.
very interesting ?? also 2:57 very inappropriate ??
We can see Africa correctly(kind of) at 600 million years ago (4:03)
and could you make the same, but with the colors of the original landmasses, so that at the end you can see the origin of bits that form the current continents?
Bounces like jelly
2:56
DEJA VU
NANI?! CONTINENTORU DORIFTO?!?!
5/10 -no eurobeat
Program?
Not gonna lie, when i saw the title i was expecting eurobeats. Still, great educational video.
Decided to follow a point in the animation from the beginning to the end to see where it ended up. Turns out it was Nome, Alaska.
I really enjoyed this video , Thanks
The little part that departed itself from Ur at 0:19 reunites with the exact same part at 3:53 and later becomes part of Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Tsjad (and obviously tiny little parts everywhere else as well)
This shit never happened.
Crazy to see how much our planet has changed from a couple tiny islands to 7 huge landmasses.
Music?
Drifting without eurobeat isn't drifting.
9999
Think i heard this off of futurama
0:18 Ur famous! ur cool! UR !!!!!! ????????
4:50 LOOK SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA ARE THE LAURASIA COUPLE MARRIED! ????????????????????????????
0:15 supercontinent: VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LBRA that's what it sounds like
Earth 2: Continental Drift
is Eurasia a combination of Asia and Europe?
GOD FORM ALL THIS
Wow good job
It appears the first recognisable feature is The Great Australian Bight, appearing in -1448mya and it grows from there.
None is not a supercontinent none is none-continent
600 million years ago 4:03
2:53
So it started with vaalura
The world is a Agar.io server
So there is no such landmass as Europe.
Tokyo drift
4:43 this is the original pangea
4:50 Britain left the EU in Europe
0:23 mom gay
.
Very cool good job
Yea They Were All In One Island Named Pangea
When you said drift, I thought actually drifting a car Disadvantages of being a car guy
The see me rollin' they hatin'
2:35 It's a hint
Now someone add some eurobeat in the background
Most people remember only 1 super-continent. It’s Pangea because of the dinosaurs from 66MYA.
Two super continents America and Afro-Eurasia
Eurobeat?
How do some land have "no modern counterpart"?
What does Myr mean?
I wait until it become looks like Tamriel
Vaalbara 0:12 3300 Myr Ur 0:18 3099 Myr Kenorland 0:33 2706 Myr Arctica 0:47 2562 Myr Atlantica 1:32 2112 Myr Atlantica/Nena 2:01 1823 Myr Columbia 2:01 1823 Myr Rodinia 3:16 1073 Myr Pannotia 3:49 742 Myr Gondwana 4:06 573 Myr Pangaea 4:30 332 Myr Laurasia/Gondwana 4:46 172 Myr Laurasia 4:50 133 Myr Today 5:03
This didn't seem right were Australia and Indonesia not connected to each other a few thousand years ago?
AWESOME
what a video dude
Awesome!!!!!!
Woah
At -388 Mya it starts to become familiar
*Eurobeat intensifies*
DEJA VU
And all of human history takes place at the end of that very last note! Makes you think.
nice
Deja Vu!
Este video me la sirvo para enseñarle a mi profesora en mi colegio ;v #HailLH
What do creationists say about continental drift, it sort of negates the flood story doesn't it?
I think you need yo take away Antarctica's ice sheet.
I thought it was the song
Algol dude which country are you from?
Ded earth no man 000000000000000000000000000000
in 2600 myr started
in 3300 myr earth was so heat and had no water and had ony lava and plasma fire and heat stone in 2000 myr earth started the water and oceans and sea and gras
Super continent today: russia
Philippines -10 Myr 5:02
the first year of the columbia supercontinent was my favourite -----------------> 2:01 4:29 was the best of real continental drift
4:03 Africa is starting to form
at 4:03 I noticed africa's modern shape
3:56 666 Million Years BC
lolwut i dare u to click read more kill me
MINUS NOT NEED!!
Why do people still call Australia as a continent? The correct is Oceania
Supercontinent ------------>>>. Nonecontinent
Yay I can learn more about da past
Vaalbara ----> Present Day 2017
What Is Myr
Too much information per today So Cuba is from us, Cuba is not nothing they do not have identity in your face Cubans of shit
i came by DGP MUNDO
Nice
So how is it that there was so little continental land mass back then (as far as we could tell)? More water or continental crust hadn't developed as much?
This is Awesome!
It flat
It flat
Shit, thought this was the next Fast and Furious
Fantastic ??
no eurobeat
Top effort. Ever thought about making a G-Plates Model for public use?
Thanks a lot, SQUIRREL!
Sick, this would take a lot of studying.
Anyone got the eurobeat version?
Gondwana looks dope.
De ja vu
now do every year...
So in this video, 1 second equal to 10 million years
2:07 only i see a lego man?
4:57 that's pretty much how earth looked like when the meteor struck
Shaped into something beautiful
No Initial D music?
so now we know that it's going to be 300 million years from now and which we all would be dead by then :/
I like how big Australia was for most of the earths history.
Vengo por el robot de Platón :v
wait islands can move everywhere in the ocean in dinosaur year? also i have dino rock
Looks like when mixing clay
And zealand?
Africa and Australia were the oldest continents?
BTW, the colours seem slightly off on the last frame.
The Philippine islands were separated from the borneo island
You copyed fron dpg mundo and puts a music or you putt it
DEJA VU
Have you seen Professor Scotese's video that goes back to 1.5 billion?
Continental DRIFT, DEJA VU!
Great animation, Although It would be great to have lines of lat and long included. Good job!
??????? ??? ?????????!!!
I love how at 4:54 India's like 'screw this, I'm off'.
Its good but where’s doggerland?
I come here to listen GAS GAS GAS... DRIFT!
The amazing part of this is that throughout the majority of it, there is no life on any of the continents.
what Myr
Amazing how much our world has changed. I wonder what it'll look like in 100 million years.
Looks like someone left their milk out and this is a time lapse of mold growing on it. #EarthIsMoldyMilk
the super continent of 0 MYR is eurasia
Supercontitent: ur
The content Ur lasted untill 2:46 or -1366 Myr
The Earth is only 6000 years old. What book series is this map based on?
”ur” kidding me.
2:01 even 1818 million years ago, no one could spell Colombia correctly Why did a Brazilian make a joke about no one knowing how to spell Colombia lmao
Eurobeat intencifies
I like pangea
Algol myr=?
The Earth's history is such a wonderful topic to cover, from beginning to now, so beautiful. :)
So wrong
Pls combine this with the Pangea Proxima model animation
Pls combine this with the Pangea Proxima model animation
Bro how do u know dis stuff
I'm here from DGP MUNDO :)
Myr=?
vaalbara 3.3 billon 9
Way more emotional than I thought it would be.
This was shown in my Social Studies Class at West Middle School in Nampa Idaho, you have a whole School as a fan!
So beautiful!!
I like Alfred Wegener´s Theory Of Continental Drift, and I think It would be a really great interest of mine to learn more about it. Good job.
Awesome!
2:36 Super sized NA?
He took me back to -2031 Myr oh half of the earth is a tectonic the earth is banana havan
1:41 bottom right
Whats mean MYR?
Whats mean MYR?
I think it would have been better if the entire tectonic plate boundaries were shown, not just the visible land.
Very well done! I like the timer and the names of the supercontinents.
I love the music (infinite perspective)
make 300 million pangma proxima version 2.
Today, we still have Afro-Eurabiasa.
Where are the Moose?
2:36 Columbia does the groundpound
Algol, I kindly want to ask that is your novopangea model coming out yet
4:19 - NOT ANYMORE THERE’S A BLANKET
I cant wait for the United kindom to leave europe
What music did you use?
Did anyone noticed that in 1:59, a part of NA and a part of Eurasia formed the Korean Peninsula?
But... wouldn't there be a super continent today? In europe, Asia and Africa? They are all combined after all.
Lol. This is a broken theory. Just look how they look like they willl fit nicely together before they meet. Feels backwards at times.
I'am tukish
What will happend 4000 yearscago
How the Continents formed and broke apart
3:45 earrape YA ass
that does not look like anything ????????
2:54 That was not even funny
Dude! Amazing! You should call yourself amazing Algol!
The first ever land was so pleased to see all of His species
4:32 who saw Mexico
You could argue that we do have a super-continent in africa, europe and asia, as they are all connected (Afroeurasia)
What's the name of your song
I like india piece from africa to asia
Fun fact: Ur technically wasn't separated until Pangaea split up, which means it lasted for 3 billion years.
This has to have the most relaxing music on planet earth (no pun intended)
Pause at 4:57 and this where Florida didn't exist and this where the asteroid kill the dinosaurs
2:45 God: oh no, Earth what are you doing? EARTH?? WHAT IS THIS? NO EARTH YOU'RE GROUNDED
So where was Atlantis, and when was it completely buried by water?
4:54 "woah"
At 4:45 North America said yikes
4:56 India car crash
How does land just join together like that?
Umm...i already know... when i was in 2th grade
You forgot include the meteor strike that hit when America and South America joined.
Shouldn't it show boy sides of earth?
What music was this?
Please like and subscribe share comment the Algol ????????????????????????????????????????
Great Algol l like this ??????????
Amazing agol
Who's watching this from —3300 Myr 0:11

Fantastic Job
Algol, you are make new model Earth 1 billion years from now?
4:55 Here comes an asteroid, And the Dinosaurs are gone....
Nani !? Continential dorifto !?

And now a moment to acknowledge the history of the great continent of Ur. -3100 Myr 0:18 Ur is formed -2990 Myr 0:20 African Island (later became present-day Egypt) separates from Ur -2660 Myr 0:38 Ur combines with Kenorland -2480 Myr 0:55 Ur leaves Arctica taking parts of Australia with it -2320 Myr 1:11 Southern Australian peninsula separates from Ur -1960 Myr 1:47 Southern Australian peninsula reunites with Ur -1800 Myr 2:02 Ur combines with Columbia -1785 Myr 2:04 Ur separates from Columbia -1560 Myr 2:27 Ur reunites with Columbia -1500 Myr 2:33 Original Ur island separates from Columbia -1320 Myr to 1250 Myr 2:51 Ur greatly increases its land mass and moves to the North Pole -1060 Myr 3:17 Ur (now known as North Rodina) combines with other continents to form Rodina -749 Myr 3:48 North Rodina is renamed to North Pannotia -572 Myr 4:06 North Pannotia is renamed to North Gondwana -510 Myr 4:12 Eastern parts of North Gondwana fall apart into separate islands -330 Myr 4:30 North Gondwana drifts south to become South Pangaea -130 Myr 4:50 South Pangaea (now renamed back to Ur) separates from Gondwana -117 Myr 4:51 African and Eurasian sections of Ur separate from Ur -60 Myr 4:57 Ur separates for the last time to become present-day Antarctica and Australia And Ur's great story ends here in the present, but it will always live forever in the special spot in our hearts. Long live Ur. ???????????????? Note: not all of the events above are historically accurate! I was just trying to make a fun story about a continent a few million years ago!
Nice flag design... mine has the same design but the background color is orange, the y-stripe in the middle is dark red with a fire symbol to the right side, and the line surrounding it is blue
I'll tell you a secret how videos like this are made: the author was just on crack, what make 'em look amazing.
Columba looks like a man falling
4:54 India's just like "I'M COMING IN BOOOOIS".
0:13 Vaalbara 0:17 Ur 0:32 Kenorland 0:46 Artica 1:32 Atlantica 2:00 Atlantica/Nena 2:00 Columbia 3:15 Rodinia 3:47 Pannotia 4:05 Gondwana 4:29 Pangaea 4:45 Laurasia/Gondwana 4:48 Laurasia 5:02 END!!!
4:43 Pangea
DGP Mundo
Fantastic animation :) :) :) I like the music!
0:11 Global warming effect?
4:40 Pangea
Ur kept it's shape from creation to -1435 myr lol
DGP Mundo
Weather update: VOLCANO ALERT THATS LAND
God dammit dinosaurs
What means "MYR"?
R.i.p Vaalbaara ? To ?
Finally I found! Really nice animation mapping!
Multi-continental drifting?!
This is so bullshit so for 2000 years the world changed so much and then for 2000 years almost nothing changed BULLSHIT
Hi, Algol. I think your great! :) But i do have 1 question. In the frames you use for this video, i move for from frame to frame, but it changes dramatically from the last frame. But in this video, it's animated. How do you do that?
Its american actually
greenland is green so greenland is american?
And also, when Columbia formed, it looks like an anglerfish about to eat it's prey :):):)
Arctica kind of looks like a grandma wearing a baby's amplifier :):):) And when the amplifier is pulled out, the grandma dies...
I wont to visit each continent and live in each era just to see all beauty of that nature and to see that what hadn't been seen by anyone and maby find mountains which is higher than everest and oceans which is deeper than pacific and really that must be really amazing!
4:43 is 200 ma
4:22 Woah Awesome
2:55 lmfao look at the thing in the middle ;)
There are 6 continents. AFRICA, ANTARCTICA, AUSTRALIA ,EURASIA, NORTH AMERICA and SOUTH AMERICA.
is the earth still moving like this?
2:53 is -1300 ma
The picture at 0:00 is amazingly beautiful!
I liked it
m
Really impressive animation, thank you!
vaalbara to Ur to kenorland to arctica to atlantica/nena to Columbia to rodinia to pannotia to gondwana to Pangaea to Laurasia/gondwana to Now
Beautiful! Thank you!
That took a long time but IT WAS AWESOME!
4:39 Africa 's shape
4:03 = 600 mya
hey omgggggggggggggggg noooooooooooo the enemies falling in the water this balls here 3:43 to 3:55 these ice
gooooooooooooooooooooooood
is it real??
Nice!
watching this in 2x speed is fine
Make Earth in 1-2017
Very nice job! Thank you! I experimented with playing various types of music for accompaniment. That was fun!
YSytyfu
Jsfoo
Just a theory
2:42 that looks alot like baby pangea
2:16 and that's why they say Colombia, to not be confused by the supercontinent Columbia 1,660 million years ago.
i wish i was born in -8 MYR when britain was still a part of france and when poland and germany were conjoined with sweden norway and finland
Love these globe videos you make! Do you have a business email I can reach you at?
How do you do this?
UR be like: bitch, im on my own
who doing 2 times speed with me?
Sometimes, it looks like the countries are melting, or are they?
2:22 south america looks like the one today
gasps!!! u forgets beemooda!!!1!1! how der u!!!1!1
1.?????? 2.?????
Im having science clus now nice
How is continent are growing
i would think today's supercontinent would be Afro-Eurasia
Where’s Pangia
Great work! :D
4:38 - Pangaea
amei esse vídeo, bom saber como o mundo começou. adorei??
Primeiro brasileiro a comentar o vídeo kkkk
The music is so relaxing.??
DGP Mundo brought me here, i liked the channel
Is there music for this I can hear it but what is it?
This is good tho,very accurate!
There are seven continent thought.
How do you now all off these?
I came from dgp :D
Earth was beautiful until humans are here chopping trees lawn mowing and throwing drinks/Foods What are we doing to our home planet protect earth #Earthislife
Amazing work :( i always wanted to make one of these but i get too many dislikes. :(
the fuck is a myr
-1815 Myr Never knew Columbia was a continent. Now it's a country.
Hawaii?!?
0:11 to 5:04
This was kind of beautiful to watch.
4:33 it's barely starting to look like the world we know rn
Great job, fantastic editing and super educational!
The story of 4:50 : South America: Africa? Africa: Yes? South America : I'm sorry to tell you I've been cheating on you with North America. Africa: Screw you! I'm running away with Eurasia!! (floats away)
Vaalbara simply became Antarctica, Madagascar, idk what part of Asia, And all of Oceania.
Awesome job algol!
So it is possible that earth used to be a huge water planet?
so africa and australia are the oldest parts ??????
burt i dont get it.it massses of land are fixed to the bottom of the sea, how do the continents move?
Wow!!!!! A awesome job!!!
5:05 best of the best
Love this video. Great job!
it is cool
? ? earth viewer ?????????? ?????? ??????
fantastic lol
0:11 Vaalbara 0:18 Ur 0:32 Kenorland 0:47 Arctica 1:33 Atlantica 2:00 Atlantica/Nena 2:01 Columbia 3:16 Rodinia 3:48 Pannotia 4:06 Gondwana 4:30 Pangaea 4:46 Laurasia/Gondwana 4:49 Laurasia 5:03 2017
Why Greenland can be american
Eurasia is my favorite continent
Good Job
Is this for apollon
you are so smart, i think this took days and days of work and documentation, hundreds of hours!
Wow! fantastik gratulasion!
Wonderful Vid, But did you know, the continents did not break, dissolve, or anything, the just got merged under the water!
Why does the super-continent look like a baby in 2:23. It is probably just me.
AAALLGGOLLLL
This is so Fun to watch. Our planet Really has Gone through much change.
3:57 ok this is interesti- and oh my god
awezone video
4:57 AND THE DINOSAURS ARE GONE
4:15 THE SUN IS A DEADLY LAZER
4:09 IT'S THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION
vim pelo canal TOPlista
Faz o ur
DGP TOP LISTA ME TROUXE :v
Congratulations
They forgot erope
Incredible animation ! I love it!
in 5:03 this is the current form of the continent if you know a lot about geographic in egypt there is a Peninsula that not in africa like whole egypt its a part of asia and its called sinai and in the video you labeled it as african Peninsula if you dont know what is sinai search in google : Sinai Peninsula and also not only sinai that you labeled as an african land also israel (palestine) you labeled it as african land and its asian
Now it's clear that God really created the oceans first before lands...as said on Genesis..
0:12 boring
How do we know this!!?? I mean I can understand that we could go back pretty far but how do we know 3000mya? Can anyone inform me?
This is amazing ?? thanks Algol
At aus it split colide split
Fantastic Job Algol
Look this 666 myr
when being white is a bad thing
Great great great work! Thanks for sharing too.
Algol! There some copiers of your video! I'm going to edit this later to send you all the links. EDIT: https://youtu.be/unBYpDZTCPY https://youtu.be/nFP2k7-ZiRY
Oh my. That's us.
Try this 4600 myr
Can You Do An "Updated" Version Of This? It Would Be Cool If You Made -3300 Myr (Vaalbara) To 300 Mya (Pangaea Proxima)
4:47 to the present India:Hi madagascar and africa i will go to asia Africa& Madagascar:Why? India:Because i want to join with country that not black people Africa: :( India: BTW i will make white mountain range not black Africa:what's DAT India? India:I will make Himalayas with the highest mountain in the world Asia: Thanks India Africa:But bu but why And today the himalayas was form Thats why Africa hates india
little island bye bye Ur Ur:no problem just leave Little island:this is dangerous! Ur: little island where do you think your going? Little island:back! Ur:n sorry yes not no (-3300Myr--3150Myr) Arctica: come back head Head:no Arctica:otherwise i will die Head:no Arctica:Ok :( aah i am breaking up! The islands:i dont care lalalalaallalalalalalal not a supercontinent anymore:what an i doing?
4:44 pangea
Mu
the world is cat easter egg
It's unbelievable how much work you put into this. The work was all worth it. Great job. You earned a sub.
2:55 When Australia was on top of everyone.
4:54 Brexit!
'mazin
Strongly Agree
this was a good channel sad to see it go..
Deja vu, I have been in this place before...
I like how Antarctica began at the top
Hallo im new to this channel ALgol im a subcriber now i saw some of your video on your channel *likes the video
And 200 years of driving cars is gonna fuck this up. Okay.
No i will not lose my 5 mins for watching continents moving
The ending was so beautiful and satisfying!
3:53
good you made the whole history of the continents
-1291 myr looks like a pee pee :)
4:09 world's most Giant Antarctica
1:31 find a giant Idiao and Vermont
2:54 hey look a dick har har har
what pangea
This is soooo well done. It teaches something and it's soothing. Glad to have found your channel
Newzeland*
News eland is a sunkin land mass
That was amazing video EVER!
this song was amazing
I noticed now that from kenorland the north american plate stayed the same, even if the islands were seperated, but rhodinia really started to shape the americas.
As much as I like the video, I am colorblind and unable to really distinguish the progression of some of the landmasses.
5:01 florida is born
i love music
woah that looks like witch's head LOL!
No way!
most of antartctica strated at the northern hemisphere
You know in Minecraft but is none history of county world
:(
Good Job Algol
I like that song
I like how the boomerang shaped continent Ur managed to remain intact and survive in that shape for over 1.5 billion years until it was merged with a series of supercontinents and it only finally broke apart when the last supercontinent Pangaea split up.
Mega Job
I thought Afro-Eurasia was a super-continent.
Apparently Italy ???? is not the only boot in history.
2:57 Im thinking of all the possible names the land in the middle would be called :D
Scrat's at it again.
Algol can you do a animation that if the sun's super nova never happens can you do a animation the continents moving after the construction of Pangea Proxima please
Wow how did you make it move so smoothly?
There were only fish at 3.3 billion-374 million years ago
1:41 is 2017 !!
It's amazing how Vaalbara remained a distinct landmass for about 1800 million years.
Meant "around"
I can't believe you did this because at first glance it look shapes floating Aron an oval but it is actually real life a long time ago. WOW
nice vid (music scares me for some reason)
HOW DID THIS PLS TELL ME
salty creationist flags video
4:29 Not recognisable 4:39 Recognisable ish 4:57 ooh.. 5:05 And guess who's here!
4:56:REST IN PISS,FOREVER MISS.
UR continent is so small! get it?
1476 Ma Me: about to see my people 1000000000 generations ago... 1000000000th great-grandfather: *wiggles* Me: ?? OH MY GOD ?? A MULTICELLULAR ME?!
Hey Guys Look trying to build a precambrian era
im going to have avantage on you
It's somewhat confusing that there is no difference made between deep sea (oceanic crust) and flat sea (continantal crust). I would recommend to use two different colors (e.g. light blue and dark blue).
Panguea is still happening!! Earthquakes happen everyday so... 74% chance of Panguea
This helped me a lot with answering my questions. A lot of effort put into this. Job well done. ;-)
FANTASTIC!!!! IM LIKING AND SUBSCRIBING!!!!
Something wrong with Triassic and jurrasic
why is afro eurasia a thing when they are together????
don't confuse ur with the biblical city xD
Amazing
South America first formed 2.27 Billion Years Ago at 1:16
Building a pangaea
it splits and half
240 million years ago
wegener called pangaea
200 million years ago
I heard some youtuber said "stop it the earth is flat" jeez if the earth is flat the continental is still moving still move but who know globe or flat?
Do you ever plan on creating one with modern day country borders and/or majour city locations? This could show how the continents became themselves over time.
Very good
A+ Algol A+++++++
if someone is saying "Ur dead" then your correct because WE DONT KNOW IF THE CONTINENT "UR" EXISTS
when god made this planet
later algol...where are you now :(
Fantástic
5:03 There is a Supercontinent: Afro-Eurasia.
4:37 About time South America!
Would be great on a CG Globe that could be rotated in real time.
Holy shit Columbia is a giant Denmark.
I like Thailand
the little chunk that breaks off of Vaalbara is part of modern north africa
why Vaalbara is a supercontinent? is so little :3
Imagine if this was real time
YOU FORGOT ZEALANDIA
How you did it?
Nice!
Africans: We wuz first!
The entire thing was like 'world make up your mind'
00:21 looks like a gun shooting
so satisfying
2:34 1492 (maybe incorrect)
Do more videos please they're great!
the music is so relaxing
backwards version please?
I was like "HEY INDIA YOU DROPPED MADAGASCAR "
2:50 the penis continent
When the great historian mapping gods EmperorTigerstar and Ollie Bye approve your video, you know you've done a good job.
no modern counterpart (white)
/???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????
kenorland
I was just watching one area on Vaalbara the whole time and it became southwest Australia
Very nice video. I will waiting for future continental drift video. Very far future. ;)
Isn't Afro-Eurasia the supercontinent as of now?
Good Work Ancient Earth continental drift
And then to think that for the first four minutes of this video, there were only bacteria and protists. So certainly no land creatures to enjoy all this open space on the ancient continents.
Amazing
Afro - eurasia super continent
????
Great job! It is so difficult to explain that in a blackboard!!!
Im disappointed that there is no initial D playing in the background
Lol!!!??????
4:42 incase you are wondering here is the jurrasic period aka dinosuars
2017 years Springs February 17 to June 19 Summer June 20 to August 9 Fall August 10 to November 2 Winter November 3 to February.16,2017 years Winter November 3 to February.16,2018 years
2:11 It's a boy!
Now do the past and the future in one video
Show it to your teacher and she will be amazed so much her mind blows up
Also I am saving this video because I like it
When I watched this video I saw a penisland
Great job :) Can i use it for a scientific divulgation video?
4:07-Africa as stretched out Australia
It's really interesting how Pangea is so popular, yet it looks like the longest-lasting supercontinent was actually Columbia.
how you create this?
Meu Caro, isto é Extraordinário!
south america looked like present antarctica at 4:12
If this video was named "Continental Drift" then you should add the future drifts. Spoiler!
I like this Happy ?? day guys and all of the ?? world
the "Pangea" Spells Wrong....im verry sorry to Said that
awesome
Is this based on Christopher Scotese's Paleomap Project?
2:59 dickland FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
If you dont know what Myr means it means million yers
good but right at the end, new zealand came apart from austriallia not randomly appearing
3,300 million years in the making
wery biriful
What earth in 73737373737272 years look like all water is gone the end
0:11 1-year-old continents! 0:52 8-years-old continents! 2:17 18-years-old continents! 3:55 29-years-old continents! 5:05 Really real continents that are 90-years-old Continents!
4:05 I found North Africa.
If you need any information on these time periods, ask Bernie Sanders. He was probably there for most of this.
Wish you had current states overlapped
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS?!
For earth at between 850 to 750 million years ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C18OdhL6AGo
The continental drift, and we do it just like this
nice agar.io game...
I thought the Supercontinent today was Afro-Eurasia.
The scale of time becomes clear when you realize that in one life time they move about 2-3 m and even after a thousand human lifetimes, the continents have barely moved more than a couple of miles. Real changes are noticeable after about a hundred thousand lifetimes and it takes a million lifetimes for a supercontinent to split. Assuming you lived a hundred years between births and deaths, You'd have to be born, live and die 33 million times to experience everything in this video. That's a hundred million generations !
Awesome!!! Thank you for that. Be well.
how do you make this???
HOW DID YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS!??!?!!? DID YOU JUST TRAVEL FROM THE PAST AND WENT UP TO SPACE AND SEE THE EARTH LOOKED LIKED!??!!??!!?!??!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!?
australia was more like borealia
3:23 stopped right in 1000 part!
+Algol Make a Novopangaea drift
that's so cool ^_^
N.America:I miss ur, she was the greatest supercontinent of them all. Europe:Me to I was part of ur and you to,but I was smaller back then.. S.America:I feel bad. N.America:You wasnt even there back then!
1511 ma Amazon: I just got huge! 1400 ma Amazon: Bye Laurasia
Pangea = getonera = nasaeaaaa
this is what i wanted a perfect video thank you Algol for making this video
Rodinia: Congo no!!! Congo:But we need to get to the main course.
2.4 B.yrs Younger north America:Superior what are you doing?! I'm breaking away you lousy lump of land! Younger north America:??
2645 m.a Ur: Younger north America lets unite!
What does MYR mean
I'm pretty sure the first one n became India Madagascar and the middle of antarctica
the song in this video, sped up to 2x speed, sounds like it could have come straight out of a Donkey Kong Country 2 level o3o
the 1 africa part being chased is god making fun of us? so hilarious
You have EXACTLY 4000 subscribers... What is with the accuracy?
I can make this
1.8 billion years ago, antarctica was above everyone
Wow. That is pretty rad. It seems as if the water is disappearing, though; why?
1279mya OMG AUSTRALIA FORMED
Hey hi algol Look this For Earth in 1 billion years from now : http://dragonthunders.deviantart.com/art/TFiF-the-continental-dance-630470153 I think at 0 to 283 is wrong +North america should be glued with africa to 349 million years from now! For Eon in future : http://dragonthunders.deviantart.com/art/TFiF-Geological-Timescale-V2-555809308
Awesome video. It was nice to have the age of the depiction in M.Y.A on the side as reference.
Hey, where's that guy who was arguing for expanding Earth? I was going to reply to him, and link him to several papers, but the whole comment thread disappeared. If you know where it went, let me know: that's my weekend distraction you're talking about! EDIT: Found it. But it won't post. I'll just make a video or something.
1460mya UR IS FREE!!!!!!
Amazing... just one or two points - the British Isles came from a landmass known as doggerland, which connected it to Europe; the North Sea and Irish sea, and I suppose the English Channel were created after the last ice age melted... Also, Iceland didn't "drift" from Greenland, it grew out of nothing, a volcano on the mid-Atlantic fault.
arabia and india are their own tectonic plates
forming
3300mya-870mya music that reminds me of the calm seas flowing and everything that's going on in these scattered tectonic plates 870mya-0mya music that tells me of the present
what's the music for this?
4:56 R.I.P. Non-Avian Dinosaurs
180mya pangea already broke apart
I was keeping track of Ur and it landed in the middle east
Is it just me or are the colors for Eurasia and Australia almost indistinguishably close?
Do you make "Continental Drift: 3.5 Billion Years of the Future World" !
Why is Europe combined with asia not a supercontieniet?
At the end it's supposed to be AFROEURASIA?
Can you do continental drift videos in rectangular projection?
Rodinia was so big!
2:30 0:54 1:08 2:02 Ur, how many times do you need to break off of other islands?!
Bravo! Good job!
I cannot say why Antarctica looks like a big continent but it is only a big island

What music do you use here?
WHERES TIMELINE OF FLAGS OF ASIA
I'd like to point out that there is a slight problem with counting new zealand as part of Australia.
Very interesting, I always wonder what it was like before 3 billion years. Did meteorites have a significant effect on the continents?
This is so beautiful on so many levels.
Amazing job what is the program you use for this?
You should do a Alternative Future of the World Mapping Series.

Continental drift is driven by New Age music. However in the real world, continental plates cannot slide about willy nilly. They are firmly rooted in the ground. What makes them APPEAR to move apart is the expansion of the earth and the rifting and spreading which this causes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfBSc6e7QQ&t=213s
You have a discrepency when you reach the modern world, Super Continent: Afroeurasia
You still list that the present day has no supercontinents. I feel that Eurasia should be classified as a supercontinent. If not, then Afro-Eurasia surely is.
4:50 Like a jigsaw puzzle in europe
Are you gonna map this one onto a globe like you did it with the previous version?
the best! Awesome, fantastic! Wow!
Nice!
Greece deserves constantinople. the landmass is older than the rest of the land it owns. and constantinople has gold. gold that should never have been owned by a conservative country. hey that reminds me. conservative nations are cheaters.

NOT THE LABELLED VERSION!!! This had to be made before. This fixes some inaccuracies, and everything is reanimated since I did a sloppy job the first time. New stuff -3300 Myr to -2100 Myr, and -1380 Myr to -750 Myr.
