This was the first episode filmed in my office, to answer your question, yes, it was due to the whole Maldives episode issue thing (now resolved! Fair use win!) ANYWAY this was actually a really fun episode to film with just Ken. We literally rigged the mic on a broom and taped it to the wall for support. Enjoy this episode of #Monaco!
Best geography Chanel
I really love the animation in this episode. It's probably because you can show the entire country in the animations, but it's still really great animation.
Damn you Ken...LOL
Can't wait until the Mongolia episode, do the nomads proud!
Europe’s version of Macau
I expected him to bring up Grace of Monaco
Why no UK? you've done France and Saudi Arabia. And tiny nations like the Maldives, I don't get if you want to rip into us that's ok just seems a tad odd is all to leave us out?
I LOVE THIS SHOW
11:49 why did you choose these 4 and not, for example Nico Rossberg, WHO IS A WORLD CHAMPION (while 3/4 in this frame aren´t)!
Don't interrupted Barb, let Ken do his thing thanks.
YESSS FINALLY MONGOLIA
reminds me of florida but with farm land and more crimes
I'm actually from monaco and am living there but i've learned so much stuff in this video wtf
All 2 km of it XD
The ë letter exists in French. In Noël for example (Chrismas)
Do Morocco please?
I flew past it when I flew to nice, it was 1 min til landing
More micro nations =more war
Are you ever going to do the UK ?
Hey Paul, be less of a prick and could you please respond to my email? Thanks
Dude, its not that hard to respond to an email
Thuis series just keeps in tanking in quality
I love your videos. Please include kilometers since most of the world uses the metric system. Thanks you :)
EY! It's an Indonesian Update V- wait a minute
oh, you have indonesian subtitle!! terimakasih !!
Anyone thought it's Indonesian flag?
Next is mongolia
Okay so the zooming in and out map graphic stuff is AMAZING. so cool.
Do Serbia in the near future plez :(
I hope tsunami hit Monaco :)
um these GRAPHICSSSS
If one square meter is worth $45k, than a square centimeter is worth $4.5... This is why you really should learn metric system...
hot take Ken > Noah, let him out more!! :D
Poland ?
I thought that you make indonesian episodes twice :v
So, Monaco is a Rapture that made it.
Hey GN can you guys do a QnA video too... pls pls
Monaco: Hey Indonesia Can I Copy Your Homework Indonesia: Sure But Change A Bit Ok Im Just Kidding Man
So Monaco is a monarchy... a Monarcho?
Poland still has a way to go before it's on the show. :/
Yeah Mongolia, my country!!!
Wow! That flag same as Indonesia
“So I must leave, I have to go, to Las Vegas, or Monaco , to win a fortune, win a game, my life would never be the same!”
don't say the disgusting "soccer" word, it's FOOTBALL
Wait! What about the flag?!?
So much knowledge...
Monaco's flag is exactly the same as Indonesia's flag.
Click the link idiots https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtDgmPeydE&t=3s
How many time did he says formula 1.
when your country is basically Genovia
As a reward for supporting them in the Italian War of Unification the King of Piedmont and Sardinia ceded the province surrounding Monaco to France in 60. The cash-strapped Prince of Monaco sold 95% of his principality to France. The area including the city of Nice was Italian-speaking, a Ligurian dialect.
Oh look, it's Indonesia again. . . . Wait a minute.
11:49 you missed Alonso, Hamilton, Hulkenberg, verstappen (recently), vettel, raikkonen, rosberg, etc
Yay! Leclerc!
When you gonna cover The Netherlands ?
So.. you are more like a geography teacher.. well.. there is a word for that.... my mom!! ??????????????????
I really wanna see Romania
You can literally fit Monaco 8,550,000 times into the whole of Russia (17,100,000 sq km) EDIT: The Vatican City (0.44 km sq) can be fit 38,863,636 TIMES into the whole of Russia. MIND BLOWING!
Love your channel!! would you consider doing former contries? like USSR??
There's a little mistake at 8:26 : "ë" does exist in French, it's highly uncommon in particular compared to "é", but it does exist. From the wikipedia article, it's there to say that the previous vowel is pronounced alone, mostly in "guë" cases where you're supposed to pronounced both "g" and "u" (like in "aiguë"). It's also used in the French word for Christmas : "Noël" and in some first name such as Chloë.
Never fails to put a smile on my face . Thanks men!
That farmer lady is actually Swiss xD
A big hug from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
This video is so unnecessarily long. It's bloody Monaco, not China.
Teacher: how Monaco looks like? Me: Like a praying giraffe
Almost the whole grid of drivers of the 2018 or any season live / own something in Monaco
The city animations are amazing! Looks like a drone shot almost
Switzerland pls!
DO THE NETHERLANDS
Its incredible to see how much history a place smaller than my neighborhood carries.
It feels like we have been on M since January :D (just joking)
A French town called Nice? nice name
Is this the brother of Masaman? They both have the same pseudo mongoloid looks, like they are from Turkmenistan.
Ë does occur in French though.
Basically the country from the princess diaries
Fun Fact: as a french guy I'd like to point out that a fair share of french people just think Monaco is a french city (they don't see it as an independent country - even if they actually went there!).
When will you do a video about the glorious country taht's Tanou Touva ? ^^
The moneybag republic
Love the editing in this one
AHHH IT WILL BE TAKE SO MUCH TIME TO "T"...
Oh Monaco, the country paid for with stolen tax dollars from the rest of us.
1 square meter is actually 10 000 square centimeters. the right price would be $4,5 for a square centimeter, assuming a square meter of $45k.
Ken the real MVP ????
Who loves Monaco?
A square cm in Monaco would be $4.50. There are 10,000 square cm in a square meter
I didnt know Monaco is a country itself. I thought it was a province/city of France.
Pakistan geography?????
STAY TUNED MONGOL--- Ad starts -- LIA IS COMING UP NEXT
btw ü and ë exist in french, you're wrong, for instance the french word for christmas is Noël xd
Pls do morocco
The bus in 2:25 is an Israeli bus. EGED bus!!!
8:32, actually, its pronounced bon-jor-no
4:08 Monte Carlo casino, a friendly reminder that gains of gambling trend to 0 as the number of time you gamble increase (Monte Carlo method)
Damn do we get to hear about Genghis Khan next time?
AS Monaco Football Club has 8 championship titles since they have won the last in 2017* ;)
The Google Earth Map graphics are so awesome. Show us how you do it please.
Oh, The exceptional episode is coming.
Ken was like: Yassss
Actually it's 4,5 Dollar for a square centimeter ??
WILL WE EVER SEE SERBIA??????
BROOO, I’ve BEEN WAITING THREE YEARS FOR YOU TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT VENEZUELA AND I AM STILL WAITING
Ken, you've got some hay on your hair.
A french speaking country but no french subtitles...
82 more weeks until UK
are those animations from google earth? looks amazing
Do mongolia next
ü and ë exist in french. not very common but exists
Thought it was Indonesia for a sec.
That's not Monaco, that's Indonesia! ??
Monaco belongs to France.
Do Poland now :D We have almost the same flag as Monaco, just the colours are reversed :D
1 sq cm is 1/10000 of 1 sq m, that would make it worth 4,50$, which is still way too much
Waiting for philippines......
Hot and humid as hell. Went there in July and got positively drenched in sweat. Also expensive as hell, but you knew that already. It's also a pedestrian's paradise. Would recommend.
Aww... Why not the black background?
???? ? ?????
If one squate meter is $45.000 then a square centimeter is $4,50 not $450, there are 10.000 cm2 in a m2
Okay, Leclerc made it in. I'm satisfied now.
Please do Sweden or at least some scandinavian country
casino royale is in montenegro according to the film, while the actual location is in prague
What geography? The Its a city lmao, The closest thing they got is the Larvotto beach
What about it's educational System? Are there any Schools in Monaco?
It's $4.50/cm². A square metre is 100²=10000 square centimetres. Still very expensive but much more reasonable
i love ken : )
The current Princess is a South African
Minus the closet, this background is superior.
Is it just me or does Indonesia, Poland, Greenland and Monaco have every similar looking flags.
Don't judge a video by it's thumbnail. Indonesian be like "Wow, it's indonesia again... Wait, nope"
You forgot about the Italian invasion of Monaco during WW2
Monaco ke?? Ingatkn Indon tdi????
Imagine the next Geography Now episode being filmed in a backyard
I want Ken & Noah together!
Why France didn't ever take over? Why does France prefer to conquer a little island in the middle of oceania instead?
$45,000 per square meter equals $4.50 per square centimeter, not $450. A square meter is not 100, but 100 × 100 = 10,000 square centimeters.
Ken is sooooo adorable. Cant wait for the Philippines episode. Lol. He should make a great appearance there.
When I was in Monaco in 2010, a Polish guy said he liked my Polish hat...It was Monaco hat... Same colors Poland/Monaco , pattern is reversed!!! :)
Fun times: I had a Geography project last year and I decided to do it about Monaco, in the style of your videos. And I did good, which is fantastic. I was damn near hoping you'd start off with the way I started off, "Monaco, let's MonaGO!"
8:50 - Didn't Prince Albert end that law?
1:03 Once you see it, you cant unsee it
I can't unsee that praying giraffe
MONEY
Kens nips are protruding.
Dat editing thou ????
Can you please do Sweden?
Barbs, would you be doing Montenegro or Serbia? :)
Hope you can do the geography more, at least until flag Friday began or when you started including additional info in flag Friday.
I hope Noah is alright and I wished more people could've joined ya'll, but it so cool to see Ken on screen more :)
Lily Safra got her fortune By marrying a millionaire and investing her (his) money In property, then he died In a fire and she inherited his fortune. After that she married another rich guy and invested his money In real state as well, her other "job" besides being a real state broker is a socialite, that is someone who frequents parties and gets famous for it.
You missed Donetsk
Finally Mongolia Next.
Trains are my thing!
Why did you include gutierrez but not massa or verstappen?
1:56 I heard that's a pretty nice airport.
Indonesia ??
Wow the Animation.. Thank you Ken!
The oceanographic museum in monaco is the best aquarium i've ever been to.
It would actually be $4.50 per sq cm because you can fit 10,000 sq cm inside a sq meter
Monaco is one of the three European countries where the monarch has powers with day to day politics. The other two being Liechtenstein and the Vatican.
I love when you speak. You talk fast(makes u Sound smart, lots of facts, u r so clever and funny! Way to go. Good video :)
8:50 So, if France wants Monaco, all it has to do is kill off the Grimaldi family, and then legally Monaco is theirs?
Oh boy, Mongolia is coming. After such a boring country, we're getting a big boy next.
actually a square cm would only cost 4.5 dollars...
ken sucks! <^.^.>
Khagan is coming!
What was going on in Monaco during ww2? , must've been a bit tense as to who they would ally with ?
Indonesia , Poland , Monaco “We have the real FLAG!!!!!”
Thank you. Very nice video Waiting for Ukraine ?? if you will need any help in gathering information - text me.
Hyped for Mongolia, was a Mongol historian in college and can't wait to see what you do for them :)
indoNesia is just copying Monaco flag stupid indon
Monaco = Crime state. Nothing fancy about it
I’m from Montenegro, how can I help you make a video?
What about turkey ?
I can not stop thinking in the cute pregnant giraffe <3
Monaco couldnt add blue to their flag cuz they would have the same flag as holland
Monaco's business tax is actually 33.3%, which is kind of high
Charles Leclerc
But Sir Roger Moore is dead...
This is the ferst country that iv been to all the sights mentioned in the video (yay geography now bingo)
11:22 Charles you legend
AS Monaco has 8 championship titles not 7 their last one was in 2017
why this country exist ?
I don't think that Roger Moore lives there anymore...
Make one for Portugal plz
nice :)
Why can't you do NORWAY OR NICARAGUA!!!!???????
Casino Royale was In Montenegro. I hate to be so pedantic, but your channel is called GEOGRAPHY NOW. ^^
Soon, Monaco will reclaim all of the Mediterranean. mwhahahahahahahaha and its real estate will STILL be expensive.
3:18 no, that would be $4.5
I’m from Monaco ???? !!!
I'VE BEEN THERE
So from the most densely populated state to the least huh?
Ah, Monaco. As Somerset Maugham so aptly put it: A sunny place for shady people.
I kind of thought Monaco was a region in France because AS Monaco is in Ligue Un
I love Ken lmao
Ken is hot.
6:25 only 2 percent more than Israel
I thought monaco is part of France
3:13 No. It would be $4.5.
Can't wait for Mongolia!
WTF!! the bus at 2:22 is an old isareli bus (egged company ???
I demand more Ken
Is there a Serbian Episode?
Yes, Mongolia! Genghis is excited
Bruh... This country is so cheap asf, Sili in the Philippines is more expensive. By the way I use the term Monacan to refer someone from Monaco. I don't even what Mona... Whatever you say this, before I watch the video.
It made me so happy to watch this episode as I got to live my childhood in Monaco! Recognising (and even learning about) the principality made me strangely nostalgic. Thank you for the video! :)
I think i can take over monacco with ez. If the french protect it
You better talk about Mongolias navy next episode
8:33 so, yeah Just like italian but french
very cool broo.. thumbs up!
13:00 why dose monaco look like it has a mouth?
welcome to mobile legend. ????????
Singapore = eh, cute
nearly 3 years in, Still waiting on Zimbabwe
Chaaarrlll Lecleerrrr
Everything on polandball amino has indonesia/monaco
I have seen that flag before......
Soo... It's basically the European version of Dubai
One of four countries without an airport
ken can like... get it
@1:03 I can't unsee it now
Hey, as far as I could see, you used the image of Israeli green bus here ?? from the "Egged" public transport company! Was so funny to see it in Monaco! :) Great vid though, as always! ??
6:22 Isn't the VAT 20% now? 19.6% was like 4-5 years ago.
imagine if monaco have a embassy in indonesia or vice versa , people wouldn't recognize most likely ??????
In 2:20 when describing the bus routes, why did you use a photo of Israel's Egged bus company? :O
WHY don't you make a Turkey?
Or you could just walk into Monaco.
I will make a video. That video is "It's time to learn GEOGRAPHY NOW!!! 1 hour "
I like to see all those animations!!! I really appreciate the additional work that you guys put into it and I am even happier because it means that the show is going great!!!! Keep up the great work!
Lol! 1/3rd people are millionares, rest billionares and trillionares.
Money, Money, MORE MONEEEYYY!!!!
I am eagerly waiting for #Nepal episode
I'm from Monaco and thanks for this video. I don't know anyone who isn't a millionaire, besides workers.
My wonderful country. Here we have an utopia.

Merah putih
10:10 barbs lookin fine as hell
Can you make quizes that go along with your videos?
Why isn’t this country just a part of France it’s a city
do somalia
Monaco flag similiar to indonesian flag
5:10 wait can i do it? 5:12 NO 5:21 takes over
Why there is no Kings & Queens in Monaco?
Anyone else notice the unit conversion error? If it costs $45,000 per square meter then it costs $4.50 per square centimeter (1 meter = 100 centimeters so squaring these we get 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters) not $450 like they said at 3:06.
Too bad they're going to get relegated this season
Senna premerio . Mansell segundo. Ayrton, Ayrton, Ayrton sennaaaaaa dó Brasil.(Tema do victoria plays)
Monaco actually seems like a pretty dope place.
DO MOROCCO ????
e??l? ??u ????ppo
Monaco: Hey can I copy your homework? Indonesia: Sure, just change it a bit.
Wow! I could recognize the F1 track once Port Hercule showed up (of course, having a dedicated pit zone helps)...
Isn't Casino Royal in Montenegro, not Monaco?
I get confused between Monaco and Morocco
Unless you're crazy rich, it's impossible to get the citizenship to be monegasque as both of your parents have to monegasque and their parents as well and so on
I went to Monaco last year. Beautiful country!!! The changing of the guards is a absolute must watch!!!
Monaco flag cheating on Indonesia
Who do we have to talk to to get Geography Now shirts that just say "ANYWAY" on them?
Ken ???? ???? ????
Well, I guess we know why it's called Geography Now and not Math Now. :) A square centimeter would be $4.50, not $450 (there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter. METRIC CONVERSION FAIL).
" Money, money, money and money" Cool bit of history there
Roger Moore is dead guys
PHILIPPINES PLS
Money.. money.. money... more money.??
the ë does exist in french, for example noël (christmas),
is this gaston
FFS LEARN AREAS 1 sq m = 10000 sq cm
Ken and Barby. How cute! You guys Rock!
Pretty sure they changed the whole "the country dies with the Grimaldi family" in 2002.
You can see “ë” in French
Wait, how do we know ken isn't the one who broke noah's car so he can replace him in this episode??
my backyard
Money money more money
Monaco looks alike Indonesia flag .. Indonesia claim everything ??
Honestly you're kind of a douche lol
Finally to Mongolia next week! I’ve been waiting for you! Also can’t wait for the Switzerland episode.
Hey guys, sorry the others bailed on your but really good vid. Made me smile!
Monaco’s club team is doing terribly this season. They’re in 19th place and getting smashed by everyone they play.
Really stretching to inject as much muricuntism in Monaco as possible ??????
Its funny cus this year in f1 12 drivers out of 20 lived in monaco and 8 on the same road.
Yo Barbs, I came across a person named Barbato on YouTube. Any chance he is related to you?
A cm is 1/100th of a meter, but a SQUARE cm is 1/10000th of a SQUARE meter; so it would be 4.50$ per cm, not 450$.
5:40 she’s pretty
Was I the only one who thought Monaco was in Africa no just me ok
Where you hide your money...
please do Philippines!!!!!!!!!
Wait so Monaco is Sovereign? i thought it was like Puerto Rico of French
there’s a monaco joke and it’s a video of fan giving something to rihanna
haha even tho he's not in the normal studio, this is one of the best ones yet. :)
I’m guessing there are no border checkpoints so if you want the passport stamp I’m guessing you have to arrive by sea at the expensive ports
If France takes over Monaco if there’s no heir... France: Let me do my thing... MONACO PRINCE DIED!!!!! BREAKING NEWS France: hon hon hon hon.
I legit like this background better than the usual all black background.
So glad to have stumbled across your channel a while back. Always very fun and informative videos presented in such a nice way that makes you always want to come back for more, and left sad when you don't find a country your looking for in your past. (I am sure you'll get them all eventually! :-).) Looking forward to a future episode on the UK hopefully. Keep up the great and very enjoyable work!
Love that 3D illustration of the buildings
One of the reasons I subscribed Geography Now is that they use metric system

Funniest Episode so far :D
1:19 Indonesia Enclave
2:54 :D
Can I work for you?
Sadly Sir Roger Moore (James Bond) is no longer resident as he died in May 2017
little mistake on the sq m conversion, and noël (chrismas in french) contains ë, but meh .. awesome video and thank you !
Can't wait for Mongolia! I've been waiting since Hungary!
Man...I really wanna go there now.
Mona Co. is a fantastic business.
I'm going to need to put on my monocle for this one.
I didn't really know that Monaco existed because it is not really mentioned a lot in the United States of America. :( :)
#RICH
Ahmm, Your math skills aren't exactly impressive. Cringy
Pakistan please.
the way he pronounced grand prix oof
My very rich uncle and aunt live in Monaco while it is fully the most expensive city to live in in Europe
I actually kinda like it being filmed in your office as that wall is a awesome backdrop
Question: How easy is it for residents of nearby French towns to get work in Monaco? Obviously the country needs workers to take jobs not typically associated with millionaires (e.g. cleaners, hotel staff, school teachers etc.), so do they presumably commute into the country on a daily basis since it's so expensive to actually live there? Do they need any sort of specialist work permit to do that since Monaco isn't an EU member?
Where're the subtitles in Other languages?
3:04 there are 10,000 square centimeters in a square meter, 100x100. So the price of 1 square cm of land in Monaco would be $4.5
that moment when ken makes barbi look small
Can we make it to S before I grow old and senile?
I love ya ken
10:06 you can tell the skit has been attempted before because there is already water on Paul's t-shirt lol
Why is no one talking about the excellent animation of this episode?
Why the hell does monaco exist.
YES!!! MONGOLIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and great episode as always.
Mongolia, YES!!! I'm so excited I ran around town yelling Mongolia with my arms waving through the air
A key relationship was not mentioned in the FriendZone bit: RUSSIA. There even is a Wikipedia entry about that: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco–Russia_relations
I work in Monaco. I walk to the office. I live in France. You start walking and at some point you’ve changed countries. Sometimes you bump into the prince who’s just doing prince stuff.
More of ken
World: so what kind of topography do you have? Monaco: Um, we got this hill.
Daghe munegu!
Turks and Caicos Islands
3:18 - 1 m^2 = (100cm)^2 = 10000 cm^2. 1 cm^2 is 4.5$
you didn’t say a word about princess Stephanie :((
3:18 absolutely wrong 4,50 per square centimeter
Yay Ken!
You should the micro nations like sea land, mollosia and ,Liberland
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down.
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Dude! You're way too hyper. Tone it down
Yay. I had a vacation there! :D Me and my family went there. Then we drived to France, and then to ITALY!!!! ( If any bad english, then its cause im Danish. Also, loved your episode about Denmark :] )
You're awesome Paul, both you and your crew. I've watched most of your videos and i like it and i also love your explanation skills. Keep up the great work, mate.
8:27 Well yes you do find them in french. Although nowadays you barely see those letters in actual french words (I could only think of one for each) they were more present in an older from of the french gramar in wich the letter "ë" would be repaced by "é".
wow nice animation! way to go
Back to school again guys ! A square meter equals 10000 square centimeter ( 100 * 100 = 10000; remember ).
Next video UKRAINEEEEEEEE
Raaah ting! I thought Monaco is a region in France??
More Ken!
Is montengro next???
A square CM would be 4.50$...
Well, the language of Monaco is actually Genoese with small variations and some French loanwords. Proof is that I can understand every single word (I'm from Genoa). As for Monaco's economy... well, better not to dig too much into certain transactions. His Most Serene Highness wouldn't approve.
So... they just stole indonesia's flag?
Imagine barby being a geography teacher
Reminds me of the city on just cause 3
Hey Barbs do Poland!
I cringe everytime he tries to pronounce a name with a local accent. Notice how he pronounces Qatar
That's the best joke i've ever heard ?????? am gonna tell it to everyone
Native monagasques are technically Italian (like people from san marino). That would make 40% of the population Italian.
so man, stop making us wait for Ukraine, we can be emotional, you know.
I love how you pronounce the french words :3
Monaco: reclaims land Netherlands: Laughs in Dutch I am so much looking forward to that episode
@10:54 Lann the Clever real world inspiration?
Something is up here....how can there be a miss-schedule a few episodes in a row.... Even im not that disorganized...
Casino Royale’s setting is in Montenegro not Monaco.
Do New Zealand
Barbie, you and I have the same phone case
8:53 The country would not fall to France. That was changed in 2002.
Can you do Montenegro geography now
I am very good at geography (country's) but never new that Monoco is a country!!!
Gr8 episode! I don't know a lot about this country (even though I'm really good at geography, but I live in NZ) I have estimated you'll release the New Zealand episode around 11 January 2019 with no delays or filler weeks. With all of the filler weeks & delays taken into account, it will take you until around mid august 2020 to reach the Zimbabwe episode. Sorry to all 16.6 million Zimbabweans! PS: My best friend loves your videos too Barbs
Fun fact: The stadium of monaco is inside the university.
Actually ë does exist in french langage words like noël ( christmas )
Apparently the current Princess of Monaco(prince albert’s wife) grew up in the same neighborhood as I did in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe - so technically monaco is the only country in the world with an active African monarch(or technically wife of a monarch), so that’s pretty cool. There are so few white Zimbabweans left that the chances of that are almost zero
11:47 About that "Philanthropist" thing: I noticed that when you look at the Wikipedia pages of all top millionaires it also always says next to their professions that they are "philanthropist". I guess that's just an easy way to make someone look good, no matter their past or their actual profession (maybe they just inherited all the wealth and did like one charity thing).
when you can count the buildings from the country's satellite image. lol
Do one on senegal i need it bro for school please
Most geography now videos have the same demand unless you are ... wait for it... Mongolia.
Again...?
Go Charles Leclerc and Forza Ferrari
Monaco has Greek etymology... can't believe it...
It's rather interesting that following alphabetical order the country with the lowest population density comes after the country with the highest (having 50x the population of Monaco but 1 million times the area)...
I am so happy that you have mentioned Charles Leclerc:)
Is Ken straight?
I kinda like the background. Please, don't order the YouTube room :D This is much fancier.
Are you this guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HixR68sYGI4
In the summer it's full of tourists but in the winter it's like a ghost town. Lots of people own property in Monaco simply to avoid tax.
Please make Turkey
What kind of weird Indonesia is this ?
Monaco is like that aristocratic small center of town, where all the nobles with unimaginable riches live, in unimaginably expensive homes
"A se revede" sounds like Goodbye in Romanian
You forgot Daniel Elena, the famous copilot of Sebastien Loeb
but 1 sq meter is 10,000 sq cm ... so 1 cm^2 would only set you back $4.50
Ken's hot. Topless vids pls haha
The train station is not located in the middle of the country but at its border, anyway thanks for the video!
Yeah, Monaco... lost of Bruges home lol get rekt
???? Monaco ???? Poland ????Singapore ???? Indonesia Only Indonesia had a different flag!
When will The Netherlands be at the N or the T?
That's the flag of Indonesia.
Love Monaco I was there for Thanksgiving day where the Prince met us personally. They have a feast on that day for Americans. Funny to watch the waiters grabbing the small American flags before guests could take them home. The casino is very intimate so you're elbowing with the very rich. Harry's (owned by Cipriani) bar our favorite serving my husbands favorite steak tartare. The hotdogs sold on the street are delicous and their hot mustard clears the sinuses. Although small in size there's much to do and see there.
yes, Indoneisa ! oh wait,
Casino Royale took place in Montenegro not Monaco!
btw you could take lewis hamilton or nico rosberg instear of Esteban "another arrogant driver" Gutierrez
reee louis chiron
Monaco looks alot bigger in Plague.inc
Dude ur high? Nice!
Yaas mongolia
Ken is Now Free..... yey
Geography Now iron patches!
Ken is here.
Maths, gentleman -- There are 10,000 sq. cms in a square meter, not 100. It would $4.50/square centimeter
1 sq meter = 10000 sq cm
fail on the maths guys, thats $4.50/cm2
Waiting for my country for 4 years by now, Montenegro. 2 episodes away so Im so excited
It's amazing how you managed to keep the usual quality of your videos, despite the improvised studio!
If your a native monegasque youve won a lottery in life
Hercule not Hercules! They're not Greek!
Actually, there is an ë in French
Can You do Norway??????? like if you agree!
Will the Uk video be longer as there's 3 counties, as you covered Northern Ireland in the Rep Ireland video?
But why is it independent?
Sir Roger Moore is no longer a Monaco resident. God rest his soul.
You forgot Vietnam
Hey Paul, I have a tip if you can’t pronounce the words. If you can’t pronounce a word, go to google translate, search the language the word comes from, type the word, then listen to the word
Do Morocco next
I literally LOVE your Channel!
little mistake: casino royale was in montenegro.
Hey Barb actually we use ü and ë in French in a few words like "ambiguë" and... "ambigü", as odd as it may seem! Oh also, we use ot in "canoë" and "capharnaüm" :P
You made a mistake at 8:29 , the 'ë' is French (in Raphaël for instance) ^^
I like Ken tho.
Uuuuh,finally,what is different monaco flag and indonesia flag
You'd think hard pressed with land more high rise buildings will be there...here in Dubai it's abundant for some weird reason (cool tho cos during peak heat seasons a mere peasant like me can find shade in them....sigh)
Do Pakistan and Tanzania plis
MONGOLIA HYPE
Monaco also known as Indonesian't
Ken does a clever job at placing the eyes to make the countries have full faces.
12:19    S I N T E R K L A A S   C O N F I R M D
The flag are totally same as indonesia how ?
Dude what software do u use to explain the geographies?
NEPAL next please.
I have 300E in savings, 499.700 to go before I apply for citizenship
It's lovely to see Ken on the camera But I love him stay at his dungeon more
Geography lessons in 2300, Monaco was once the second smallest country, and now it is not.
WHEN YOUR LARGEST BODY OF WATER IS A SWIMMING POOL
can you do the netherlands next?
I've been so excited for Mongolia!
And F1?
Monagasque sounds a little bit romanian to me..
Monégasque is a variant of the ligurian dialect (genoan) of northern italian though heavily influenced by neighboring occitan (the traditionnal language of southern France) dialects (nissard, mentonasque). Fun fact : french citizens are very limited at applying to monégasque citizenship. This was decided, along with other fiscal deals in 1963 because french government was fed up seeing its uber-rich nationals and businesses expatriating themselves a few yards away to avoid paying taxes (among other issues). De Gaulle pressured Rainier Into accepting the deal by establishment strict custom control at every border of the principality (it is said that De Gaulle even threatened to cut off power, gas and water supply). Mutual relationships after De Gaulle leaving his office improved dramatically.
Roger Moore died last year...
Great races all the time
Isn’t that Indonesia’s flag?
Why Monaco is even a thing? Why they're not become a special state of france
I can't wait for you to get to the letter p > Philippines!
The "Im reading wikipedia, IN ORDER!" show!
Why u didnt make video about Serbia?
The "no heir, passes to France"-thing was reversed in 2002.
Conveniently for your upcoming Montenegro video: Casino Royale was actually set in Montenegro, not Monaco.
i miss you, my handsome ??????
it's finally here
Marathon in Monaco? How does that work? Twenty loops and you're done?
The prices are high to keep the undesirables out.. As best as possible.. No homeless, Single mom ,petty crime, employment Stoner issues Getto's..Wana bee's dont last long.. Need sustained Cash flow to.jsng in there.. Good job Monaco, so far..
he is lying about the studio isnt he
Sokka? Sokka?! SOKKA!
Monako flag like Indonesia flag
Hi Paul , Happy Deepawali ( Diwali ) ????????????????????????????????????????????????
Money money more money
It always surprises me to hear it's 2sq km... seems much bigger. But that's probably partly because it's long and thin - it's 4km if you walk from one side to the other. And when you go from the sea to the edge of France (ie. the narrow part) it seems further than it is because you can't walk straight up. For one thing it's steep and for another it's all roads snaking around and you can't walk it in a straight line.
Is AS Monaco's stadium even in Monaco?
$45000/sq. meter 10000 sq. cm = 1 sq. meter 45000/10000 = 4.5 Real estate is $4.5 per square centimeter, not $450.
Hey this was a good job and despite working in the building with the swimming pool near Chemin des Révoires I learnt some stuff (about the springs and the vegetable grower, for example). Here's some points I didn't agree with though or find questionable: The airport is 14 miles away and not 5 Foreign residents are never referred to as Monégasques and from what I've heard it's super-difficult to get the nationality. I haven't met any foreigners with it. You have to have had at least 1 grandparent born there or be given it by the Prince and normally it's not just a question of asking nicely, you need to be so to be they think brings prestige to the country, like famous chef Alain Ducasse was offered it after running the country's ritziest restaurant for years. Also you have to give up your original nationality. Benefits include the right to cheap places to rent. On tax, basially French nationals declare income to France and pay French income tax, full stop, as far as I know. You surprise me if that stops after 5 years, I'll have to double check that. I guess France didn't like the idea that thousands of its wealthiest people could just live over the border paying no tax. You can kind of see their point. As you said, being allowed to live there is mostly a question of can you afford it, so if you're very rich it's a no-brainer due to the no income tax etc (no inheritance tax too I think). I wouldn't really call barbajuan a ravioli because its crispy and also bigger than ravioli. Nice though, usually has spinach cheese and pine nuts in them.
So Monagasques are Saracens??? Come now boys, time to remove kebab.
i would like to visit Monaco
Philippines pls..
Hey guys, love your vids, but 3D units have larger conversion factors than 2D units. That means that if a m^2 of real estate costs $45,000, a cm^2 costs $4.50.
Please do the netherlands i want to see if someone finale makers a good video About the netherlands
I am excited to see how you'll wind up conveying Mongolia and their sudden decision to build themselves a large capital city... in the middle of the frozen steppe haha. Hoping for plenty of wit in it!
0:14 - because they have so much money...co. I'll see myself out.
NIGERIA?
Heaven defense not won a war since 1812??
Hey Barbs! Love you guys, and I know that the channels not Math Now, but the price per square cm in Monaco is actually $4.50 because 1 square meter = 100 cm * 100 cm or 10000 cm^2 and divide 45000 by that and you get $4.5/m^2. Love your videos still though!
Small mistake, both ü and ë are used in French language. For example, "acute" can be written as "aigüe" or "aiguë" in its feminine form.
Your content is interesting but man it really hurts see you trying so hard to be cool and funny, its OK if you're not charismatic, seriously isn't that bad if you're not charming just do your job and let your content flow
Can’t wait for Mongolia, I work at a Mongolian grill
I like the feel of your office compared to just the plain black wall. Been watching since Canada
Except for, wait for it: the mongols
I remember watching this in 5th grade. And back then our entire class would sing to the theme song... once we sang it too Loud, the teacher next door complained that we were too loud. Our class loved your channel!
5.23 rofl
I thought I knew a lot about Monaco but today I learned about the only farmer in the country! I love this channel!
This is Netherland a MFXIV. This it UAE a MFXIII.
WTH? WHO IS MONACO THIS MFXIX!!
Hei Barb, 1sqm = 10,000 sqcm, that makes land in Monaco will cost $4.5/sqcm. Still astronomically high though.
I love the animals part NOOOOW .
There are 100 cm in a meter, so there are 100^2, or 10000, square centimeters in a square meter. So each sq cm is worth about $4.50, not $450. That's still horribly expensive though.
Uh 1cm2 will cost $4.50 since there are 10,000cm2 in 1m2 :)
At 3:18, the price per square cm would be $4.5 (not $450) because one square metre = 10,000 sq. cm.
So basically a family was so rich they were like "I think I will go found a country today, just for kicks"
Finally! I can’t wait for my country
One Euro, Fifty Cents? Wouldn't it be 1 and a half Euros?
Julien Medecin won an Olympic arts medal, not an athletic one. He was an architect.
Prince Albert's ancestor, Albert I, married an American heiress, Alice Heine.
When did Ringo Starr become a resident of Monaco?
Ken did a really good job!
wait they are super rich and the first guy in their dinasty tricked his way to the crown, they are basically real life Lannisters lol
Finally! Monaco! I was blown away when I conducted my own research, but even the Monegasque language managed to pass under my radar. Thanks for the lesson!
Wow! Ken nailed his part this episode! Pretty cool.
Why did you choose a picture of an Israeli "Egged" bus?
Most important question is, do they have a working class?
Monaco's natural resource is money.
I really wanted someone to come out the closest and say there lines
It will be a long wait, but The USA and Vatican City will be quite interesting.
I love the 3d views effect!
Great episode! All I knew was its name and now I've learned so much about Monaco
Honestly, I kinda like the videos more without the YouTube space
USA IS MY COUNTRY....TRUMP
Ahhhhh, finally a video with millionaire Poland
I really love how when showing Monaco in the friend zone you can literally see buildings in the country
Next on Geography Now: Wait for it......Mongolia.
Just Monaco
Waited for this episode for too long
Hey what do we want we want Morocco ask us want we want Morocco
Genghis Khan is charging ahead
Monaco is Indonesia! ANSCHLUSS!
MONGOLIA IS NEXT
by the time Barbs gets to South Africa, Cape town will run out of water
I enjoyed this episode ... it reminded me of the early episodes from your apartment between dog walkings. LOL. keep up the great work! love how far youve come too!
"The flight only takes 7 minutes long"
scheduling issues
my favourite part of that episode was 'MONGOLIA' i cant wait
that's pretty Nice
Yeah mongolia!!!
Ken, he’s soooo awesome and cute ?????????? thanks ????
We need to start a campaign to ban micro states. They are just tax havens and shouldn't exist.
Yeah I love this country because it’s a literal race track and the car museum well you can go there and see cars you never seen before however you can see exotic cars all over that area.
I thought that you want Do Mongolia but ok
Casino Royal was set in Montenegro, not Monaco...
Omg the USA is involved in everything... they friends with everybody
Monaco just reminds me of a wealthy city
I’d better monago to bed. Get it!!
Ken, I love you. Ur so cute. ??????????
Imagine if America was run like this... We can only dream!
I asked myself: “He can’t do 15 min on Monaco. Can he?” I have been proven wrong
5:20 that awkard moment when you forget something important
You missed Ayrton Senna - F1 Brazilian Legend
My favourite Tekken character is from here! Only like this if you know who I'm talking about... :p
I'd rather live in South Sudan
Who else loves Ken?
Imho, this setup looks better except for the closet on that side. I know it broke the continuity but I liked it better.
The real question: will we ever get another episode from the YouTube Studio again?
I once wanted to call an Uber in Monaco because I didn't know they don't have Uber in that country and the app was literally like "We can't go there but just walk up the next road and you're back in France and we can pick you up there" XD
ë is also used in french
Ken actually did a pretty good job, id like to see him do some micro hosting again.
What they do with the poop?
Why are you so hot?
1 meter = 100 cm, but 1 m^2 = 100^2 or 10000 cm^2. so $45000 per sq. meter is actually $4.5/sq. cm.
Is monagasque a combo of Italian and French pretty much? Cuz up to Nice was italian until the French took it over so that would make some sense? @geographyNow
So you're telling me that Monaco is more demse then Manhattan.
Ëë is in French, in words like Noël.
love you barbs and hate to break it to ya but 1 sq meter=10000 sq centimeters not 100...so it's $4.50 per square centimeter which still seems pretty expensive
It should not be a really good place to live if you like to jog long distances
Saraceans and Geonoa, eh?
Hey, I'm a georapeep, I have a Serbian passport and my name's Novak but not Ðokovic! :-P
Does anyone know why he looks low-key angry/annoyed in this episode? Well, maybe it's just me.
How can they do a 42 km marathon if the country is only 4 km long?
A little bit of mannaco in life a little bit of Manaco rest of the song
"Native Monegasque"
Can't wait for Mongolia, the strongest empire in the 12th-13th century, yet become a barren land with so few people now.
I don't mean to be rude but for the Mongolia episode can you please make a reference to the definition of "mongoloid" on Urban Dictionary
22% of 38 Thousand is barely 9,000 indigenous citizens that live in Monaco!
3:10 a sq cm is 10,000 times less than a sq m.
I feel like Poland should've been this week considering it's turning 100 this Sunday.
Hello, I am from Monaco. Greetings!
Can you do Turkey next pls?
Really? Monaco? Are we really doing this?
that joke¡¡ where was the punch guy?
Can I please ask how you do the 3d map/satellite graphics? It looks really good and I want to use it for a travel video I'm doing.
Only 80 weeks until Turkey! :D
I've visited Monaco, its incredibly beautiful, and for being such a small country it doesn't feel that way. Most streets are considerably steep. I stayed at the Novotel in Monaco and for such a small country the hotel didn't make it feel that way. I highly recommend visiting it is by far the best place I've been in Europe. I recommend staying for two full days. See Monaco, Nice, Cap D' Ail, Cannes, Antibes, and Ventimiglia Italy. My only complaint about staying in Monaco is we took Uber to the hotel from the airport. But you cannot request an Uber in Monaco. So we ended up having a 100 Euro taxi fare to the airport. You can walk to France easily and request one otherwise the trains are amazing. Also cell carriers often charge additional fees for Monaco even if you have an international plan so do watch that. Also it is considerably cheaper to go there in the "winter" months. Europeans (the primary tourist group) doesn't go there during the winter as they view it as too cold. If you live in North America (I live in Minnesota) you'll be wearing shorts there in the winter months (unless your from Florida or socal). Although the temperature says its 50-60 degrees F it feels much warmer because it is still constantly sunny and some will notice its basically on the same latitude as Minneapolis but because the polar winds change by where the landmass is positioned it is much warmer in Europe on average than in North America; in other words it doesn't snow much on non mountainous parts on continental Europe.
Yay! The Netherlands finally popped up somewhere ;) Water,
#kenforhost
You didn't say what language they spoke. I'm sure its French, but how much English and Italian are spoken?
With all that land reclamation doesn't that mean their Exclusive Economic Zone in the Mediterranean increases? If so, how come this is possible?
No 3rd world fake refugees. Must be nice.
I kind of like it in the office better than the YouTube space because the background looks nicer (other than the random empty closet)
The only thing you got wrong was when you said that France will take over Monaco if the Grimaldis don't have a male heir. A treaty signed in 2002 between Monaco and Frnace ended that ridiculous clause. Monaco will stay Monaco and the billionaires and multi-millionaires of Monaco will be free from those poor French peasants.
There is always one Richy boi in every continent. Singapore, Qatar, this boi...
casino royale was set in montenegro
Indonesia = Monaco = poland = Greenland
YAY
Would be $4.50 per square cm, becuase the ratio is 1/100^2 not 1/100
3:10 someone doesn't know how area works. When has there ever been 100 cm² in 1m² ? 100x100 is 10000. 45,000 / 10,000 is $4.50...
Would be $4.50 per square cm, becuase the ratio is 1/100^2 not 1/100
QUE THE MONGOLTAGUE
3:12 $45 per square cm, area units divide up differently.
IVE BEEN TO MONACO. sorry just wanted to tell someone that
French does use both ü and ë
Why was one of your episodes taken down?
I never knew the Monaco's flag were similar to the Indonesian flag. They're quite triggered when discussing about their flag and I dont blame them.
3:14 Nope! There are 10 000 cm^2 in 1 m^2 (100*100), giving a price of $4.5/cm^2. Still, that's like Vancouver real estate on steroids o_o
Morocco is next??
I think Ken did a really really good job. He did better than I expected.
This episode was so quick.
3:15 FIRE KEN!!! Lol no, but The reason why i say this is because $45K divided by 1meter squared (10,000 cm squared) actually equals $4.50 for each centimeter. Either way I still couldnt afford it. Great video nonetheless!????????????????
Geography now PAKISTAN. Please!
Actually "ü" and "ë" both occur in French words, although they are rare. For example: "aigüe", "ambigüe", "Noël" ;)
CHARRLLESSS LECCCLLEERRCCC
Ken is like half of this channel.
From the MOST densely populated country to the LEAST densely populated country!
Actually the letters ü and ë exist in french. Examples : ciguë, ambiguë, Saül, etc
ahh i can’t wait for mongolia
Surprisingly cheap parking fares
The display at 0:25 is partially incorrect. While Meghan Markle (top-left) was in fact made a Princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to the Duke of Sussex, Wallis Simpson (top-right) was explicitly forbidden from using the same style upon her marriage to the Duke of Windsor because, as a divorcée with living ex-husbands, she was prohibited from marrying into the British Royal Family.
Love this alphabetical order thing. Super ritsy, urbanized and tiny Monaco and then vast, empty, enourmous, and crazy rustic Mongolia right in the next episode
Hate to burst your bubble but small blunder Roger Moore has died this year. But he will will live on forever as one of the best James Bonds.
I LOVE YOU KEN...
The Monocan language kind of sound like sounds like French pronounced like English and with more separations between words.
Small but expensive
No, if one m2 is 45 000 $ then one cm2 would be 4.5 $ , not 450 $ since 1 m2 is 10 000 cm2s.
The visualss????
$45,000 per square meter works out to $4.50 per square centimeter. It's time to learn arithmetic... NOW!
12:52 Those are not Leclerc tanks.
Last time I watched this, it was 7AM and couldn't understand anything Lesson: Don't watch videos right when you wake up
I think Ken should be fired just because he wore a dirty t-shirt, yucky.
Ken did a great job! Don't be too mean to him lol
Didn’t roger moore die? And i think bono lives in villefranche-sur-mer
Casino royale poker scene was filmed in Montenegro not Monaco, just saying
Wallis Simpson wasn’t technically a princess and neither is Meghan Markle... honest mistake lol
Of all of your sidekicks Ken is def my fav by far. Good to see him get more time on show other then one line puns. Good episode btw. Loved the sarcastic remarks very much. Cheers! Santé!
Man, square cm would be $4.50 because is is... well... squared. So, in square meter there is 10 000 of them.
France should just annex them. Tax havens like this should be criminalized by international law.
Rih-Rih do you remember me from Monaco? I gave you one like this? Yes! I still have it! aw
Yay! Ken's not in the dungeon today! ??
Hey, Geography Now! Please explain the provinces and territories of Canada for the next Filler Week episode.

In 1971, Monaco won the Eurovision Song Contest for the only time in its history. However, Monaco had no suitable venue to host in 1972, and also couldn't provide any of the other requirements. Instead, the honor of hosting went to the UK again, where it was held in Scotland.
From most densely populated to least densely populated we go
12:15 Monaco has a mouth with broken teeth lol

Things I hate 1. People who make lists 2. people who edit their comments 3. people who ask for likes 4. people who over excessively use emojis ??Like if you agree ??????????????
Btw that’s not how conversion from square metre to square cm works.. 45000€ per square metre equals 450€ per square decimetre equals 4.50€ per square centimetre.
Barby! Flag Friday - error to correct - there are 10000 square cm in a square m, not 100. Therefore it would only cost 4.50 per square centimetre.
2:21 that's an Israeli bus of "Egged", I didn't know they started operating in Monaco ??
6:39 isnt this channel supposed to be family friendly?
Casino Royale is in Montenegro in the James Bond movie.
Don't wanting to be the douche, but being one, the square centimeter in Monaco is actually only 4.5 Euros.
0:27 it’s so we can get a bunch of personal unions when they don’t have an heir. I’m sorry I play too much eu4

My hometown which is 5 miles long, and is an island, has more people living here than in monaco. This town’s packed with 82,000 people.
You find the ë in french...like in the name noël
Please note: the correct standard SI and NIST symbol for kilometers is "km", not "KM".
You can find Ë in French, by the way! Some names & Noël have it.
While I love the way you spelled Grace Kelly as Kelley, her spelling was, sniff, sniff, Kelly.

Where are you from anyway
I am pretty much sure no one in the comments will thank you for doing their country on this episode.
yeet your business into Monaco ????
Finally Mongolia, I have been waiting for this country for a long time. I am Chinese but I know nothing about our closest neighbor.
This is offensive to Indonesian :v
12:21 Monaco = Sinterklaas!
It's somewhat strange that a wealthy place have a noisy F1 racing around the country which is dense anyway, yeah it's almost 100 years old, but still.
Wow amazing and such a small country
We do actually in French use the letter ë, like in Noël (Chirstmas)
"The country is also shaped like a praying giraffe" Now that you said it,I can't look at it in another way.
"Now this is gonna be pretty interesting because you would think, 'Monaco is so small, how on Earth could they have any natural resources or landscape?'" Well, you already told us that they are reclaiming land from the sea which makes real estate a resource. In a world with rising temperatures, subsequently melting icecaps, and subsequently rising sea levels, that much is pretty impressive. That suggests to me that resources on the sea floor are something becoming increasingly available to them. You also mentioned a fishing yacht club which would suggest fishing as a resource.
So this is the first time I've watched a video from you and now you got another sub.
Barbs, we're talking about the world outside the USA. So it's not five miles. It's eight kilometers.
11:44 Nole
1 square meter = 10000 square cm
Yay Ken wohoooooòoooooooooooooo
I knew my country wasn´t the only animal shaped one. (Costa Rica)
"so that means that the current prins is half american" that doesnt make sense
I believe 1 sqm equals 10000 sq cm. 45,000/sqm, then 4.5 /sq cm. Am I right?
Wallis Simson was never styler a princess or her royal highness. She was instead styled Her Grace the Duchess of Windsor
12:06 nice teeth Monaco
Please, don't do Morocco, just skip it. I've seen a lot of your videos, enough to know that you will get a lot of facts wrong. And if you do (I know you will), 1 . don't oversimplify everything about western sahara and berber culture? 2. don"t make jokes about anything (you are not funny) and 3. make sure to mention that we have the best cannabis in the world.
Well, A square centimeter would be $ 4.50 because 10 000 square centimeters fit in a squre meter 1 m^2= 100^2 cm^2 and, $45000/10000=$4.5. Still, it is the cost of a good meal in Portugal so, quite expensive.
AND PORTUGAL MAN?
Sorry but we have ë and ü in French too :)
Plz we want more of Ken
The mongols!
4.5$ / cm^2
OMG! At 2:25minutes into the video, You used an EGGED/??? bus (the main bus company in Israel)! Very funny but I caught the mistake!
"ë" exist in french for some words like "Noël" (Christmas)
45.000€ / m² 1 m² has 10.000 cm² (100x100) soooo.....a cm² is not 450€ but 4,50€. Youre welcome. ;)
Technically Thierry Herny or kylian mbappe both played in club Monaco but born in France ???? and ????
PEE NUT BUTT HER
I like the informality of the background. Sometimes a blank background doesn't give enough color or personality, meaning all you see is Paul talking. Ps. More Noah please.
Ken you are asuwm
Wait for it .... THE MONGOLS *que Mongoltage Can't wait
Poor noah.. i hope hes alright
Why these tiny states exist? Healthy people from big state to keep their money there? Just wondering.
Imagine there was a GeographyNow during the time of the Holy Roman Empire
about time mongolia com next i wast waiting for this one C:
Wallis Simpson didn’t really get to be a princess
Hey Barby! To my knowledge, the Dutch hugely contributed to the land reclamation projects in the UAE, so not sure if the joke is the right order there. Also Flevoland (the biggest project carried out in the Netherlands) is of bigger landmass than things like the palm islands in UAE. I love watching your videos, keep up the great content.
How can there a such thing as a “native” to a 2 square km area?
Yeah but what’s the 1st most visited Grand Prix track?
It seems like Barbs needs to hit the gym again. Those fat layers were accumulating.
This is actually a pretty cool video. Like it’s funny and very informational and I’ve been watching for A WHILE lol, but this ones a keeper! Saying hi from Downey and Disneyland!
2:22 ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ???????? ?? ????
I don’t like Monaco at all, not the episode, Barby did a great job. It’s just that this richfuckistan for billionaires doesn’t appeal to me, common people basically don’t exist. Just a 4 km strip of ultra luxury, royalty, casinos and massive spending. No thank you
Hey Geography Now, there are a mistake in the value of the sq cm of Monaco. If the value of the sq meter is 45,000, then the sq cm has only 4.5 dollars, not 450. That's because a sq meter hasn't 100 sq cm, but 10,000. So that's the real number you have to divide it for
Land of hoity-toity.
I don’t think they’ve realized it yet but the Maldives video got taken down
Is it bad that I like the office background better?
Dubai has NOTHING on the Netherlands....we MADE Dubai! :)
I love this video so much!!! I can know about a gardener in the whole entire nation. And I'm so sorry that Noah had a car accident. Well, you have a great day and I can remember about Monaco. See you on the Fan Flag Friday video. Bye-Bye!!!
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY : It's a very long street with tall buildings. Moving on to the demographics!
There is no such thing as a french monegasque citizen. This tax thing applies to french citizens living in Monaco.
I think Monaco has the French added value tax rate of 20 %
The best episode ever
"by law if there are no heirs to the Monegasque throne the rule would pass to France" France sharpens guillotine
Paul & Ken, name a better duo, I’ll wait.

Lily Safra was married to Edmond Safra, who founded the bank Safra with his father. Today many in the Safra family are listed at the top20 richest people in Brazil.
8:28 French actually has the Ë. Example: noël (christmas)
Of course you can take a plane there. Just mask it as skydiving lessons.
I can't wait for the Mongolia episode
Can you make an geography now of the Netherlands?
How is it that you’re getting handsomer by every video? ??????
3:03 The UAE might be going meh, but it's the Dutch that got them all those specially shaped islands.
Nice processed video ?? ... Pleaseee next SLOVAKIA ????
There's 10000 square centimeters in a square meter so a square centimeter would actually only cost $4.50.
“What ever keeps me employed!” -Best Joke ever
Finally , mongolia is up next. Waited for my country since china episode
Menton and Roquebrune are probably kicking themselves for seceeding.
8:53 I think it's over. New constitution revokes an ultimate transfer to France
To sum up the history.. Money money money money and more money!!!????????????
Hate to correct you but Casino royale was in montenegro, not monaco.
There are 10,000 square cm in a square meter, so it "only" costs 4.5 dollars per square cm... Still ridiculously expensive, though :D
This will probably be the only episode withouth the "I'm from this country!" comments - they're just too rich to watch youtube :D
I went to Monaco to meet my lawyers and flew back in a helicopter
Please keep Ken and give him more lines! He's great! :)
As a Brit, I am personally disgusted that you referred to Mrs. Wallis Simpson as a princess. Firstly, she was a duchess (she became the Duchess of Windsor almost as a courtesy title for marrying the former Edward VIII, who only got the title because he was the new King's brother), and secondly, she was a right b** who took advantage of the Royal Family's wealth and status and spent it frivolously. Apart from that... good episode.
how are these google maps 3d shots made?
Monaco's a country?
Hi there! We do use letters like "ë" in French, like in "ambiguë" (ambiguous) or "Noël" (Christmas). And even "ü", seldomly. Thanks for the video!
There are actually 10,000 square centimetres in a square metre as a metre is 100 centimetres. If you multiply the two sides of a metre by metre square to work out the area, you get 100cm x 100cm, so 10,000cm^2. This means the actual cost per square centimetre is actually $4.5.
5:50 Diz nuts
Or, in a nutshell, it is a financial gangster country for tax evaders who are damaging the prosperity of the EU.
btw Saracens=arabs :)
Barby with another AWESOME Video
????...????...???? yeah
Square cm would be worth $4.5 not $450! Still insane. Love your vids xx :)
Praying Giraffe. I get ypur joke because ots Christian. What I am dissapointed about is SOOOOOOOO Good
3:17 incorrect it would be 4.50
Please do a video of Spain
Monte Carlo !
Can u be my geography teacher?
Can't wait for Netherlands !
8:02 : POP
Ken!! <3
10:06 That was a damn funny skit XD
What if we have no Land but only water and some islands and the ocean floor can get REALLY deep. (Subnautica)
This video was excellent, I think the only things it missed are the how many Russians are living there, which I'm pretty curious to know. I lost count of the amount of supercars with Russian registration plates I saw back in May and a number of the AirBnb listings were Russian owned as well. You can even take a train to Russia from Monaco once a week via Nice Ville. Although it's pretty expensive and the required transit visa for Belarus and Russian tourist visa out it out of reach. Other than that, there's also lots of cool underground tunnels and elevators that are a little bit hidden, but make getting around even more interesting. Especially if trying to cross the road at Saint-Devote.
Awww... you totally glossed over the circus. Monaco doesn't have "just" a circus. They are holding a yearly festival in it and give out the equivalent of the academy awards, but for circus ring live performances! (also the tv coverage of the event is waaay more interesting, because they show the performances and cut all the award ceremony and "thank-you" sobstory BS to a minimum)
my computer froze at 10:10 and at first i thought its a special effect, but then it restarted
2:22 As a cultural Jew, I cannot help but to love that you used a stock photograph of an Israeli Egged autobus. Nice. Or should I say “Nice”? Ehyehyehyehyehye (even though you cannot tell which pronunciation to use with which word: the English adjective or the French proper noun)
I wonder though can duel nationals gamble there? Or is it a case of you still have our passport so no.
snob mode on 45,000$ per square meter = 4.5$ per square centimeter ( (1/100)^2 ) snob mode off And as usually great job!
How is this over 10 minutes long?
Loving the motion graphics and map work on this one...
You made a conversion error : 45000 per m² makes 4,5 per cm². Since it is an area, the value must be divided by 10000, not 100 ;)
3:22 ISRAELI BUS SPOTTED
If that woman has 1,400 square meters of land and real estate is worth $45,000 per square meter. Doesn't that mean she's working on $63,000,000 worth of land?
I cried when you said 'monaco has a ton of pools but no natural lakes????????
Damn monaco fc ! its poor club,shaming its city, selling good players and now hammered 4 goals at home! Every local should donate them money!??
Je suis monégasque
correction: you can find both ü and ë in french. Examples include: ambigüe, noël
How many square centimeters go into a square meter? ...
Finally! MONGOLIA is next! ????
Now I will never be able to unsee that praying giraffe
guys ken is so fking cute CHANGE MY MIND
Monaco to Mongolia is a pretty dramatic shift in population density.
A square meter is (100 cm)(100 cm) 10,000 square centimeters. That would make Monaco real estate cost $4.50 per square centimeter.
a cm² will cost 4,5 euros not 450
Cassino Royale takes place in Montenegro, not Monaco
Roger Moore is dead
Love the channel, but triggered by your maths. 1 square centimeter would cost $4.50, not $450
Never clicked so fast.
Really nice video, even if it's not to the YT space. Nice sound and I like this background (maybe, do something for the door, but... It's a minor upgrade). I stay tuned ;)
4:59 When your house gets randomly mentioned in a Geography now video.
Poland upside down.
Monaco: Hey Indonesia, may I copy your homework? Indonesia: Sure thing man! Just change it up a bit so that the teacher won’t find out. Monaco: Nah, fam. I’m sure nobody would ever notice.
Only people from US call football "soccer" xDD
Ut Uberiores Divites
Oh Ken, you're my fav!
I live in Monaco ???? and what you say was true and it must had been a difficult job for all those research
The funny (or maybe sad) thing about Ken's involvement in this episode is his usage in this actually seems like the greatest insult to him so far: Locked in a cage in the basement - obviously a joke. Getting fired for practically no reason - obviously a joke. Generalized an expensive burden - obviously a joke. Being needed in the episode because nobody else showed up - actually kinda seems like there's a little bit of truth to that.
OMG!! what a basic mistake you made!! 1 square meter = 100cm × 100cm = 10000 square centimeters. Therefore 1 square centimeter would be $45000/10000 = $4.50 (still quite expensive...) You should remake the episode Geometry Now! and explain how surface and volume units work!!
From the most densely populated country to the least densely populated... this is going to be interesting.
Charles Leclerc will be the most famous person from Monaco when he gets those WDC
But do they have an independent foreign policy?
Awsm videos... I absolutely love this channel even though the fact is I don't have geography as a subject in my stream...! I love his content... I am ever waiting for your episode on the United States.... ??
Flag stealer
Every country should be a tax Haven.
Indonesia ...!!! Indonesia ...!!! Oh ... Wait!
1 m2 = 10,000 cm2 , son you are off by a factor 100
I am so looking forward to the episode when you guys will cover my home country, Norway. Great episode by the way.
I am hyped for Mongolia! I was in Monaco myself quite a few times. It's a nice place but definitly not where i would want to live. Way too many snobs ^^
Ringo starr*plays Thomas the tank engine theme*
I prefer this background lol
13 minutes about a country smaller than most villages
I honestly like your office background with the postcards. It's really not that bad lol
Roger Moore passed away in May 2017...
I can't stop seeing the praying giraffe now
lol you could find your house on the map of your nation
Hey Barbs, love your work....but...(there is always a but)...dude you are looking really tired. I hope the new house isn't working you to death.
If you do another filler week, can you do Kosovo?
Regarding food specialties, both socca and fougasse are also from Provence and from Nice. With different places claiming they make the right one.
i actually like this background better
One nitpick. There are 10,000 cm^2 in a square meter. Therefore the average real estate costs is $4.50 per cm^2.
I think you made a mistake in the video. 1m^2=10000cm^2, not 100cm^2
I subscribe because all of you guys are hot lol
11:56 What happens to me when I ask my female friend out.
He’s a hot guy (and intelligent)
Sees Mongolia in the distance
So why did you used a dutch Sinterklaas head for Monaco on 12:18? kinda funny
Great Episode as always! Just one small thing: actually 1 sq m = 100x100cm = 10,000 sq cm, making one sq cm a 10,000th part of a sq m, so the price for one is 4,50€ and not 45,-€ as mentioned in the episode ;)
i love the way you explain history
I visited Monaco last month. The Oceanographic Museum is amazing!
A square meter has 100x100=10,000 square cms in it, so 1 square cm is worth "only" 4.5$
A square meter has 10000 square cm, thus a square cm is 4,5$ ;)
Lol you keep running that soccer/football joke even though 90% of all countries in the world agree on calling it football.
Bad math - 1sq meter is 10,000 sq Cm = $4.5 Now I need to wait quietly to Friday
2:24 An unintentional commercial to Israel's largest public transportation company, Egged :-D
There are 10 000 cm² to a m², not 100. So a cm² of land would be 4,50$, not 450$.
I never heard of anyone hanging a picture in their closet.
Square meter is 100cm x 100cm = 10,000cm squared, so $45,000 / 10,000 = $4.5 per square cm.
1 cm^2 would be 4.5$ if 1 m^2 is 45.000$. I advice you to stick with the Geography there Barby! Geometry clearly isn't your thing :D
Novak Djokovic has a houses like all around the world he is hella rich ik he is best in the world and he is a serb like nikola tesla
Could you explain you’re release scheduled, cause I don’t understand it. PS they should show this at school because it’s so much more interesting, love it.
Money money money money money
Awesome video. I have to see the Grand Prix in Monaco one day. I think every Formula 1 fan wants to
*4,5 dollars for one cm2
They hate us cause they aint us.
man the vatican city episode is gonna be amazing.
I once visited Monaco for 6 hours maybe ... ironically I saw almost all the top notable sites. I loved this country actually
top 1%? more like: TOP 33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333%
Wait for it! The mongols! Do a collaboration with john green!
As always great episode. However 3:00, which country created land in the sea for Dubai look it up :) greetings from holland!
12:18 Thats actually the hat of sinterklaas. The guy everyone hates on except Dutchies. The best people of course??
3:15 the math is wrong, it's supposed to be 4.50$!
well 45000 euros for a square meter is 4,5 euros for a sauare cm but whatever
Mongolia!!!!
I actually like the fact that this is filmed in your office! The postcards provide a really cool background. Now you just need a closet door. ;)
So interesting. I taught in France, near to Monaco, and the French people I met do NOT consider Monaco a country - maybe, nation at best. I was told Monaco is incorporated into the French educational system, and that teachers (who are placed around France when applying to work in public schools) could be posted to Monaco. Not sure if misinformation, but everyone I spoke to was very surprised to hear Americans consider Monaco a separate entity.
I thought it would be a great place to live in ...but then I learned that Bono lives there.
Ken FTW! Woot! woot!
Wait for it... THE MONGOLS! INSERT MONGOLTAGE
Well you should actually get some guy to schedule your filming studio... Like, for example, me....
blue flags mate
If it's $45,000 per sqr meter, would it not be $4.50 per sqr cm?
NOT MONTENEGRO!!!!!!
OK I admit I was looking forward to this episode because of the Formula 1 :)
ALRIGGGGGHTTTT
once you mentioned Mary Poppins I was like "This episode is absolutely amazing!!!!"
Where's Gretchen, a singer of Brazil? ????
When one handful of soil in Monaco is higher than my salary...
moni moni moni many moni
DO GEOGRAPHY NOW NORWAY
8:26 ë exists in French though
Only micro nation to win Eurovision! In 1971
Mongolia ha... Interesting... There is a monument for Genghis Khan with maps of great nations of steppes : Xiongnu Uls, Turk Uls, Mongol Uls...
Plz make geography now vedio on Pakistan
Me as a kid:Nah just a small country! Me as a adult: Wow very interesting country!??. Edit:thanks for 400 like ??
oh god not the mongolians??
Money,money more money.....that is true! when I was 17y old back in 1998. I was in Monaco(it is a state but capital is Monte Carlo which Barbs you have failed to mention) there were no such skyscrapers but still it was expensive....0.33l coca cola can was 15 franks.... when i tried to enter casino dude did not let me in...so i asked why? well you dont have a tie....???....we invented it!!! no!..and so i do not know how it looks like from inside.Hotel de Paris was 3 nights during the grand prix 13000DEM....I am sure that it is money money more money nowdays! one more thing IF SOMEONE HAS PLANS TO TRAVEL THERE THERE ARE NO THEFT IN MONACO!why? soon as you scream THIEF they close the borders....unless the Robin Hood is Usain Bolt with turbo jet in his behind there is no way he will be able to run away.... and one of the residents is Goran Ivaniševic too,besides Novak. Griteengs to all the Geography Now comunity from Croatia!
Do somalia please
Monaco "Ravioli Ravioli, give me all your money-oli!"
1sq meter is 10 000 sq centimetes not 100. haha..
Dude I love Mongolia. Can't wait for the next episode
I prefer this setting over the YouTube space
How on earth do they fit a Marathon into Monaco? The entire country is 4k long!
3:16 NOPE. It’s $4.50. Do the math. If a square meter is $45000, a SQUARE CENTIMETER is $4.50. Not $450
Honestly I kinda like Barby's office as a set.
can t wait for tunisia
I went to Monaco when I was living in Bordeaux a few years ago. The country was alright but it just seemed like any French city. Marseille and Nice are much nicer in my opinion on the French Mediterranean
Hahahaha you’r pronouncing novak djokoviv so bad
Does Monaco have much of a military?
Marvellous to see Ken taking such a positive and significant role in his show these days. Sorry to hear about Noah too by the way. Hope he didn't have to wait too long for help.
Mongolia is gonna be epic!
Awesome episode as always guys, just one question How is there government departments like? Eg do they have a health department and if so is it like Australias where the government pays for most of it or like the USA where if you can't affordit then your stuffed?
Washington DC has larger GDP per capita and x20 larger population than Monaco
11:22. Charles Leclerc spotted. Where's Matt?
I guess the people who go there have no qualms nor misgivings for an “adjoining helicopter transfer”. ———Husband: “Honey, lo and behold, a helicopter. It’s only 1000.00 dollars for 5 minute ride. Forget about the cab. Let’s go!”
I will never unsee the giraffe
As a Brit, I can't wait for the UK episode. Maybe you'll teach me a thing or two ;-)
From most to least densely populated
wow Monaco is so rich love from india
yee my country is nextt
I kinda like it better in your house than in the youtube studio.
I prefer the postcard background as opposed to the black boring one
Monaco: Less of a country, more of a country club.
Mongolia after Monaco. How much more different can countries get from one another?
I like your t-shirt
first time Ken appeared i thought he was pretending to be Keith
This was one of your best episodes (yet). It's a shame that the rest of the team wasn't available; But honestly the episode was better without them. Ken was a pleasant delight.
Nice closet.
A few days ago I found a guy here in the comments on YouTube who doubted that Monaco is a sovereign state...
Mongolia is next? Excited throat singing
I really look forward to new country videos from this channel. The editing of this video, with the 3D aerial views was particularly impressive. And Ken's segment was very cool - he deserves more non-island screen time. But, for crying out loud, *Fontvieille (1:20), *Fontvieille (2:11), *Fontvieille (2:54).
8:25 Technically the letters "ü" and "ë" also exist in the french language, like in "ambigüe" or "Noël", but they are quite rare.
Is the Monegasque Prince Albert I THE Prince Albert, of genital piercing fame?
You forgot to divide by 100 twice
Wait a second, how do they have an international marathon if their country is only 2k wide... something doesn’t add up here ??
Dang, and here I was hoping to refer to the peoples of Monoco as Monocles. I guess that Monegasques works too...
45000 per square meter wouldn't mean 450 per square centimeter, it'd be 4.50
Office shmoffice! This is the best show on youtube, and possibly in the world! I might be overstating things, but you get what I mean. You guys are the ginchiest!!
Sitting here still waiting for New Zealand
I watched this just because I love Formula 1. ??????
What app is used for the 3d maps
Monaco more like MoneyCo
My favourite part of history is $$$$$
hey I love your series and started following so many countries ago I don't even remember. I binge watched almost all your episodes and they're so much fun and entertaining and educational. have you ever thought about what your long-term plans are, after you finish all the countries? I imagine you might revamp some older videos, but what are you thinking about doing after all the countries? keep doing what ur doing barbs + amazing team, yall rock
Why does the UAE get the "cute" comment on land reclemation when the Netherlands are king in this area?
1:02 "The country is shaped like a praying giraffe" HAHAHA You made my day!
Hey Paul just a little side-note: I've been following your series for I-can't-tell-how-long time and have always appreciated the content you have put in all of your videos. However, coming from a Ligurian-speaking family, it did bewilder me hearing you say "Genoese dialect of Italian", since the Ligurian Language (all the different dialects) shares enough differences from the Italian language to be classified as a totally distinct, full fledged language. Ofc the Ligurian language devoids of a grammar nor does it share a common writing system used by the different dialects, yet the ligurian language ( Monegasque included) retains quite a rich literature, especially Barocque, which would/could save the language from extiction provided it were taught in schools. The dialect issue came into place as soon as another language I dearly love, Italian, took possession of much of the writings (from literature to even pieces of legislation) even before Italy was even formed. Therefore, as Italian became the prestige language, it wasn't even put much of a fuss to standardize Ligurian( let alone in Monaco and France). By and by Italian grew stronger and it is well known how it ended up. Aside from that, gz for all the effort you put into your work, you deserve way more both in views and appreciation.
Wait, Casino Royale was filmed in Montenegro am i right?
Isn’t this the country that the Madagascar crew trashed!
Concerning the ü and ë, in french we have both of these
Very nice video ! Just a short comment about sports : - The football club deserved further description. The club remains among the big European clubs, they reached the final of the Champions League in 2004 and they recently had very great players such as Kylian Mbappé, Radamel Falco or Thierry Henry (current coach). - Monte Carlo Master is one of the famous Masters in the world but it doesn't take place in Monaco, the tournament is in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin (France).
I saw a Doug Demuro video where he went to Monaco... iT hAS SomE seRiOus caR cuLtUre...
It is a religious rich Giraffe!
from Nice airport to Monaco Ville is some more than 8 miles. It is around 20 km, so 16 miles ;)
Charles Leclerc - F1 World Champion 2019
If it's $45,000 per square metre.. it would be $4.50 per square centmetre... But centi stands for 100.. yes .. but squared it's 10,000. There are 10,000 square centimetres in a square metre. ..and i'm like only a cat.
FIRST!!!
Was by far the strangest place I have ever been, there were shops selling yachts, like a corner shop
Hah! Prince Albert, I know a guy with a Prince Albert
8:55 So if Monaco would have no heir, would it become a part of France or would the President become King? Then it would be similar to Andorra.
What is this perfect country? man wish I was born there :(
Oh boy, trade your luxury car for a wild horse before next episode ^^ Also I confirm that we baguettes usually think of Monaco as just a city of in SE France... Only when we drive there, we get to be like "oh, huh... it's actually a country" x)
Are there Monaco geographers?
What videos will you do if you have covered all the countries recognized by the UN?
You forget to say that between 1793 and 1814 it was integrated to France, whith the name of "Fort Hercules" :)
Yes for mongoloa next
I just will say that your office is amazing and if you said "this is were we will record all episodes from nos on" i wouldn't be mad at all
I can't wait mongolia mongolia MONGOLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
ken ken ken ken!!
11:46 she does nothing, but the safra name indicates correlation with a brazilian bank.
Looks like an Indonesian flag
ü and ë letters do exist in French
Hi
the reclamation efforts of the U.A.E. use Dutch companies to do them, so yay Dutch.
If La Jolla in San Diego CA became its own nation, it would be much like Monaco. Yes, San Diego has the richest communities by zip code in the US (Rancho Santa Fe, unincorporated but along the city limits). And in the winter, they spend it in Palm Desert (my town I live in). +
I live in monaco but i speak Italian
Mongolia next! Badass! Don't forget your horse milk and vodka! Hot damn!
Have a drink every time Barbs mentions Genghis Khan in the Mongolia episode. ??
Indonesia... Oh sorry
5:48 I am proud to be the first author of Russian Wikipedia article about socca (although it is named „farinata“ with mentioning „socca“ and „faina“ inside)...
Other than the actual information about Monaco, what have I learned today... 1. Ken is really hilarious (Barby.Don't.Fire.Ken.Please.) 2. I really wanna go to Monaco and explore now
Everyone loves Ken!
Is that True Monaco Grand Prix every year also held inside French area? From what i know, Start and Finish line inside French area.
Is grace Kelly Irish at all her surname is very Irish
at 2:22 , is this an Egged bus? like the ones in israel?
wheres kens dungeon tho do a house tour and show us
Ken was really good
Wait, you're telling me my University is bigger than this entire country? Sweet
Do yemen
Ken is awesome
Cannot wait for you to get to Mongolia just because they’re the exception
still just waiting for my country, who else is?
I love the new graphics and visual effects like zooming in and showing the buildings
Damn, Lily Safra is from my home state and I never heard of her.
Ken doing great job ????.
Didn't Casino Royal play in Montenegro?
Get into Monaco....!? Challenge accepted.
I dont think the Youtube studio exists!
Convenient that the most densely populated country is followed by the least densely populated country
2:22 is that the eged bus company from Israel?
And they said European nations do not have kings and queens.Ha!
Your office isn't that bad of a studio, looks quite in-theme! Looking forward to Mongolia BTW.
I went here at the age of 3 :p
When can you please do Northern Ireland as its own vid and not part of the uk
That moment you realise you've just been trolled 14:21 ????
so im 21 and i didnt even know up to this video ( and the 0-4 battering of As Monaco by my team) that monaco was actually a country lmao , not to be racist but i really tought monaco was just a really rich part of Nice XD
Love From #IKhulna_Bangladesh.
Hi I am a subscriber and I love ur channel
MONGOLIA YES! Been waiting forever for this!
The country is shaped like praying giraffe = ROFL ??
Hyped for Mongolia!
Out of all Formula 1 drivers who resides in Monaco, you chose to mention Esteban Gutierrez?! Bruh...
friggin love this show XD
I love Ken, he's so cute????. I wonder if he's single ????
I hope there's a clip of Tulga a Mongolian strongman from AGT in the Mongolia video
You did not mention the Rally Monte-Carlo
sounds like the san francisco of europe.
Why do I always think these videos are a waste of time and yet I get stuck watching them to the end ?? I now know too many random things about random places ... thank you for this
isnt the "e" you have shown used in Noel?
Do one for Somalia ????
????? ??? ??? ?? ????? ??? ???. ??? ????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ?????.
Can you do one video on NEPAL.. THE LAND OF BUDDHA... please... ??????
Small correction - Wallis Simpson never became a princess, just a Duchess. Otherwise, great stuff as always!
10000cm square =1sqm ..... Barbs failed math
I’m so excited for Mongolia I’m gonna go watch the one on Kazakhstan
Cote d'azur (costa azzurra) belongs to italy
Little Liechtenstein vs Mini Monaco
45000$/meter^2 would be 4,5$/centimeter^2
Ah.... All of these familiar Formula 1 drivers ??
First view!!!
Casino Royale was on Metenegro
MONACO IS INTERESTING
more of ken please
it's time to learn geography NOOOW
Ken rocked his segment!
The animation in this episode is amazing
ë letter exists in french Great video!
Hehe Micro-states are fun to talk about??
Great work! Worth the wait!
3:04 The dutch made the palm islands in the UAE
IMO, they should at least throw a seaplane base there, where the heliport is.
Novak Djokovic speaks eight languages? I'm pretty sure that's Roger Federer
So.... you tried to bash the sh*t imperial system, but epically failed, cause you don't know how to calculate area properly.
bendera nya kurang panjang dikit mas
I was literally just thinking about Mongolia wondering if you had a video on it.
So excited for Montenegro
Mongolia : The guy who had a glorious past and now is a shadow of it's former self.
10:12 hahaha funnyest moment
i guess we can say, Italy is Monaco's mother, but when it hit the right age, it was from then on raised by its father, France
Monaco is almost like Poland If you know what I mean... :)
I'm excited for the Philippine episode with Ken
It's free expensive real estate
Money money more money
"Shaped like a praying giraffe" I cannot unsee that anymore.
You outdid yourself with these animations. Kudos to the team!
Sup Barb, i'm Mongolian and if any question for a next one i'm happy to answering questions(in case of if you got any)...
Great video. But the letter ë exists in French. Just look at my name :)
I like Ken's segments :)
m is the most boring
Film more episodes in your office, it looks so good!
French subtitle for a french country please
Can you please do Oman
I was supposed to be born at Monaco but it was too expensive now I am a nicois
NEXT COUNTRY!! ::Mongolia????????
12:20 Monaco = Sinterklaas
anyone from Monaco here?
AC Monaco is struggling in football
As a F1 fan, I really enjoyed this video.
Damn the animations, love it!
At 3:00 ; the land reclamation in the UAE is literally done by Dutch companies, although I don't understand this little sketch anyways as the Netherlands has the largest reclaimed landmass on earth (Flevoland)
We go from the most densely populated nation in the world to the least
I went to Monaco once and hated it.. srsly ppl. there are bossy af, but they have nice police officers at least. Tho I met monagese scouts, they were cool Also Monaco betrayed it's Italian ancestry by franconising, which Grimaldi who found the country wanted to avoid under all circumstances.. well done not
I like this way more than the ones with black background, this is more personal :)
I am waiting for "T" so because I from Turkey!!???????????????? And.. ????????????My Turkic brother Turkmenistan!
Barbs, at 13:18 you wrote Patrons, not Patreons
I've been to Monaco, and it is like going to a theme park where you watch rich people do stuff honestly. We even brought our meal, because everything there was crazy expensive. You could see the rich in the biggest yachts I've ever seen, in some of the craziest luxury cars of the world... It was surreal, it was like going straight to a different world. I also noticed that all the workers came from bordering towns in France. I mean, it's quite ugly, nothing special but like something freaky. However, I would recommend the old town, it's italian-ish and really cute, almost the same as Nice's old town!
NO TAXES!
YYEEEEEEEEESSS!!!
You do find the ë in French, it's in my name Raphaël And as far as I am aware I am a "pure" French
I went over the Summer whilst I was in Nice. It is an interesting place and worth a one day visit, but overall it was kind of uninteresting. Also love the channel.
Can 20 million people fit in iceland,tonga,samoa and singapore??????
3:20 It would be $4.5 per sq cm.....not $450
Sounds cool
Charles LeClerc future WDC!
Ë this letter is used in French
Ce pays est une grosse blague ! :)
Nice! is a city in italy
Does Monaco have a Police force or Law enforcement authority or do the French help out with that as well?
Can I get a like it’s my birthday
square metre is 1 times 1 and 100 centi times 100 centi that means sq metre is 10 000 square centi that makes 45 000 divided by 10 000 so its 4.5 bucks per sq centi just wanna be clear you always have to divide area with area not length edit I still love you guys though just wanna make sure
Money money more money! :)
"ë" does exists in french, it is used, for example, in the word noël, meaning Christmas
I was thinking Morocco even the first minutes of video
Monaco is absolutely my favorite European nation! Would love to visit again.
Marrying a Prince doesn't make you a Princess.... Meghan Markle is a Duchess. You have to be the Daughter/Son of a King or Prince/Princess to become one.
Happy diwali to all the geography now subscribers
Cool! I would really like to go to Monaco. But meh, I cannot afford it.
They finally mentioned formula one. ?????????????????? Now all that's left for me is Philippines and South Africa
I thought Monaco was part of France because on the map I couldn't even find Monaco when I saw it I thought it was a place in France but I can't believe Monaco is a country could be that small and rich
10:14 loooool!!! XD
Monaco is basically the Las Vegas of Europe. But like 10x smaller and richer at the same time.
The animations are looking amazing! Good job to Ken.
Fun fact monaco is the only micro state that has won eurovision
Will you make a Netherlands video
Am I the only one who actually digs the office setting for episodes? It reminds me of Crash Course!
I LIVE IN MONACO! Ask me any questions and I will try my best to answer them!
This reminds me of tapakapa.
Yeah GREAT episode but..... don't film in front of a Closet...
WOOOHOOOOOOHHH!!! Ken acted a Dutchman????
50 years later: It's time to learn Geography OW! MY BACK! Where's Ken?
The least-densely populated country (Mongolia) is alphabetically right after the most-densely populated country (Monaco)... that's a cool coincidence !
Make a video about URUGUAY!!!!!!
New episode is here! After many centuries, the dream came true. (just kidding, don't take it seriously, haters)
the shirt from Czech republic episode is back
Saracens? You know, "Saracen" is just an old big European umbrella term for all Muslims...
r/Giraffesdontexist
Nice graphics
Oh you did not show Wallis Simpson at 0:26 ??
Tbh the Netherlands is king in defending against the sea so stop it with the mention because we are the kings noone else is.
During the Friendzone part, the marina looks like a wide open, smiling mouth with very bad teeth.
Barby, you’ve gotta crack at least one except the Mongols joke a la Crash Course History.
Yeah ringo you know, that guy who did something in the 60s........
Ken is the best. Yeah even better than Noah.
I always whistle along to the outro without even thinking haha
Wallis Simpson was never a princess, she was the Duchess of Windsor. Megan Markle isn't a princess yet she is the Duchess of Sussex until her brother-in-law becomes king.
Incredible! You have made 10 minutes video about Monako without answering the question: Why are they independent?
Mabuhay! Monaco from the Philippines. Hello to all Filipinos who live there ??
When is coming romania???
KEN! And "money money more money"
Looking forward for Mongolia ??
Forgot that's a country. That'd embarrassing.
LOL, why is there an Israeli bus ("Egged") going from Nice to Monaco at 2:23?)))
Yay Novak was featured????????????
Turkey,Please
This episode is about the most densely populated country in the world... and the next one is the least densely populated, where you literally have heavy trucks driving through the desert. Lol
I had to look up more photos of Charles Leclerc... what a beauty, I am now thirsty XD
That's Indonesian flag. LOL
Please do SLOVENIA!!!!??
Oh, look! Poland!
You spelled FONTVIEILLE AS FONTVIELLE there is an "i" between the E and the L
Finally!!!
Respect your'e bus line suggestion featured the Green Israeli Egged Bus ??
????MOOOONNNNGGGGOOOLLLLLIIIIIIAAAAA????
I love you Ken!!!
Who are from MONACO.
Keep the good work handsome
Daniel Riccardo is the king of Monaco until next Grand Prix.
Where do they get the dirt for the reclaimation?
Wallis Simpson was not a princess she was a poster model for the gold digga that almost made it but didn't,   Camilla parker bowles is the is the one that made it. but it took a very very long long long long long long long time gold digga that is
Are you going to do a The Netherlands episode
Pretty good video Actually, that treaty that states that the sovereignty will pass to France if there is no Grimaldi heir was abolished, so if there is no Grimaldi, Monaco will stay independent
Am I the only one that is not comfortable by the fact that the closet is open?
U.A.E. doesn't seem to be impressed, but actually the reclamation of the land from the sea at U.A.E. also was done by a company from the Netherlands XD
Maaaaaaaybe should not have used an American Abrahams tank when mentioning the French military. *triggered Frenchmen in the comments?*
Great episode and very informative. Just two small corrections, if I may. First. the agreement with France about the male heir was made in the early 1950s but cancelled sometime in the 2000s. Second, Socca comes from Nice and can only be found there. Even if it is being sold in Monaco, it certainly does not originate there. :) Also, fun fact: I think that helipocter transfers start from 250€ per person.
why does the flag look like my country's Indonesian flag
I've seen a good chunk of Monaco and been to the exotic garden. It was... alright.
talk about sweden
OFFENDED ! YOU DIDN'T PUT MAX VERSTAPPEN IN THE F1 RACERS THAT OWN PROPERTY THERE
Apparently you can't walk into Monaco.
We Greeks USED to call Monaco "Monoikos". And it was a long time ago...like in ancient times
There's 10000 square centimeters in a square meter, not 100. So the value would be 4.50$, not 450$
Next : Mongolia Montenegro Morocco Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nauru Nepal Netherlands New Zealand
I'm still waiting for a Geography Now for Singapore.
I need more ken videos!! XD
Grace.Kelly.
Yay im here before 50K views
God damn, they're rich.
4-0
Now The opposite of Monaco - Poland ????
I don’t think it was 8 kilometres?
Kindly make one about the Philippines. ??
I was in Monaco a few years back, took an early train from Nice, and when I arrived, you could literally feel the wealth because of pure sunshine, the cars, and the beautiful coast. Also the Oceanographique Musée is Amazing.
French has the ë with the word Noël for example, which means Christmas.
What about Anomaly
Nice visual effect on the map... LOVE u Ken.. :D
Ghengis Kahn: “The entire World is coming up next!” ???? ??
What’s the outro song
i like how mongolia is right after monaco and its the least densely populated nation in the world
So many typos, Barb. Most especially... Grace KELLY. No second ‘e’... Please work on your production in the area of text—not just filming quality. ??
A square centimeter is not one one hundredth the size of a square meter. It's one ten thousandth. So a square centimeter would cost 4.50.
Wow Im very early! Too bad this is one of the video he did in his office...
Still waiting for the Pakistan episode
Ah, Monaco, the place that used to be culturally Italian and linguistically Ligurian until it was surrounded by France. Anyway, a beautiful place, I live in Italy, but it takes me, like, 30 minutes to get there by car, so I've been in Monaco more times than I could count, and it really is great in everything
So small yet so interesting! Great episode Barbs. Next up is the great exception, the MOOOOOONGOOOOOOLLLS
5:20 That pause ??
The next episode, wait for it...THE MONGOLS
??? ????? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ?? ???
Monaco was a Greek colony too? Nice
He didn't mention Thierry Henry
Woow! This episode was pretty organic. Good jop as always. Greetings from Puerto Rico.
yeah my country !! finally :)
is there a diffrent betwen monaco and indonesia flag ?
From most densd country to least densd
Better setup than usual
Do Pakistan next please
Just got back from a trip here two weeks ago, you should have mentioned the other option to reach Monaco: A $200 taxi! I wish I would've known about the $1.50 bus.
Can't separate F1 and monaco ??
Wait for it...
Jos jedna epizoda pa Crna Gora!
Ahh, football. Great sport. Also, great video! Ken did a good job
HE MENTIONED CHARLES LECLERC Now I'm happy
Apologizing for wrong pronunciations throughout the whole episode but not acknowledging how you absolutely butchered 'Saracens'! JK, great video, Barbs!
I feel so poor after watching this video. Lol
I’m here because of SENNA
Its better you filmed it at your office because of its postcard, maps and flags background. Nice! ??????
Your french is strange.
Hmmm, not sure about the maths on that sq m to sq cm conversion
????????????????
The math is incorrect, if 1 sqaure meter is $45,000 then 1 sqaure cm is $4.50, are 100cm x 100cm = 10,000 cm sqaured not 100
Actually monaco was a greek colony during the roman era :)
None of those American women became princess's they are dutchess's because they dont have any high class blood
Wow, Monaco has more yearly events than the entirety of Russia!
I burst into laughter at "money money more money." That's probably my favorite line y'all have had thus far
Wait wasn’t ken fired
DAGHE MUNEGU
now to patiently wait for Montenegro
SECOND (of course after Paul B.)
Actually Ken did it better than Paul.. oh wait ... pls dont kill me!!
If a square metre is $45.000, that means a centimetre is $4,50, since it's no regular units but squared units, so the conversion is quadratical
Sharlllll
I can't unsee the praying giraffe
@geography now do one about Nepal
Why not one episode on Hong-Kong ?
But the ë & ü are in french if i'm right. I have french classes and i know that these probably are language. Or i have witnessed something stupid that i believe now.
It's nice to see you more berbs... And I'm super hyped about Mongolia episode!!!
am i the only one waiting for russia?
Ken knocked it out of the park. MORE KEN!!!
Hey, I have my Geo channel and all the countries we're done
"The flight only takes 7 minutes long" I loved that. Great video! :)
They stole my flag, kurwa!
I think you meant 'ligue 1 champions' instead of "champions league". Because they never won that one.
Kirain Indonesia........
13:13 Hungary*
Real excited for Mongolia! I recently watched a documentary and I really want to visit!
Aragón is not Spain
I like that you have used the Israeli "Egged" old city bus at 2:24
Lool UEA saying that’s cute but the Dutch build that land in the UAE so shut tf up UAE??????
You can get two-150sqm for that price in iran
Please make an episode about russia..
Lily Safra married a billionaire (Edmond Safra), that's how she got rich pretty much
...and the French are secretly hoping that the royal family won't have a male heir so they can take over.
So how Monaco survived when France got capitulated in WW2?
Monaco and San Marino are like remnants of that Feudal City State past.
JUST -MONIKA- MONACO
Woah woah way to just gloss over the money laundering seems like it’s kinda important to talk about no?
why ken have an eye higher than the other one??
Monaco: Money, Money, Money and more Money
First to comment ??????????
NO NOAH JUST KEN
You forgot some money at 11:10
Interesting, Monegasque language seems to me,a Romanian sounds more familiar than French A se revede literally means to meet-again in Romanian
Hi.
Monaco isn’t the second smallest nation, San Marino is.
well done! Mongolia is next... wow!
I thought I was happy and anxious to know more about Monaco.... until Barb said that the next episode is Mongolia............. and I'm an Iraqi ??.......... living in Poland??
What are you gonna do once you are done with every country are you gonna make another channel or stop YouTube or something?????
Monaco = leech
Imagine if a Indonesian Foot ball team is playing againts a Foot ball team from Monaco, lets see how confused they get when they see the flag.
Money money more money
So Monaco's the Clown Car Country, is what you're saying.
Early.
Wow, don't tell Ken, but he did quite well ??
Monaco is interesting but because is mainly for very rich people...I say a NO NO. :) I prefer to have fun with cool regular people. But if I had few millions...hmmm...maybe I will have a different opinion :):):)
Do not say soccer. It is FOOTBALL.
the only thing i know about this country is that the flag is the same as ours
Can somebody put a brazilian portuguese in this video???
Damn, those graphics!!!!
Gotta admit the non-black background was a bit hard to get used to and a bit distracting, but well, you literally had no choice. Anyway, great episode as always Barbs!!!
Slight correction: the French do use "ë". For instance, Christmas is "Noël".
if that performance doesn't get Ken a raise i don't know what will.
Royality??????
Republic of Molossia!!!!
Go Geography Now best channel on YouTube ????????????????
Make Turkey Please
ooooh i've been waiting for this one! just a quick side note, at 10:51 you wrote "Geonoa" when it's actually "Genova" or "Genoa", but otherwise great video! :)
#kenforpresident2020
You forgot Mbappe!!!!!
?? The Monaco flag similiar with my country flag (Indonesia). Oh man, this country very small than Jakarta capital region ??
Chhhhaaaaarllllll- Matthew Gallagher ??
????????????????????
Monaco is Italy.
Love to Monaco from us rich people who don't like payin' taxes! :-D
So monaco from the ancient Greeks means "One House" ? is this some kind of game of thrones reference?
Depending on the season; the national food of Mongolia is either Huushuur(summer) or Buuz(winter)
Hey nice video, but Casino Royale is in Montenegro, not in Monaco
so it really easy for France to get it back just make sure the prince ends up in a hospital somehow when he needs surgery and give him a bonus vascetomy before he has children offcourse
It's such a luxurious place that I'll most likely never afford to travel to. Hahaha
Thank you. I'm going to Nice next winter and now I'm gonna have to add one or 2 more days to my trip to explore Monaco. Perfect timing lol
Mongolia is a land of alcohol, pride and drunk alley fights at 3AM that won’t let me sleep.
Mongolia!!!! Fuxxin finally! ??
what! Indonesia?! oh, that's Monaco...
France, Italy, Germany, even Equatorial Guinea... Is time for Spain!
I can’t wait to see the Mongolia episode!
Grace Kelly is spelled Kelly not Kelley
Actually surprised that you managed to make a video about Monaco last more than 10 minutes ??
Great episode but Casino Royale lies in Montenegro (filmed in Czechia) in the movie and the fictional town of Royale-les-Eaux in Northern France in the original novel.
7:58 Monaco Ethnicity - Poland and Indonesia
Monaco to me looks like an elephant head. Also how do they use the euro as their currency if they are not part of the EU?
Letters ë and ü are found in French words! Technically they are e and u with a diacritic like à, è, é, ç have diacritics in French as well as you can see
first thing I saw in Monaco was Karl Lagerfelds big ass white Villa
Mongolia !!!
half of mongolias populations lives in the capital city which caused horrid air pollution due to yurts. the government is almost relient on china however alot of mongolians want closer ties and trade with the west. the birth rate in mongolia is the highest in east asia. but it struggles with child abuse and making young children ride horses which had led to, i mean alot of death due to the heads being crushed. culturally mongolia follows the tibetan branch of buddhism with the tallest indoor buddhist statue. however some people still practices shaminism. Islam is predominant of the kazack minority
Money money and more money xD
Money money and more money
Hey so why are monaco’s billionaires so scared to... Oh wait he said the joke first...
And you can also walk the entire length of Russia in 1 hour right?
Does the Prince of Monaco have US citizenship and have to pay tax on his global earnings ?
Your show is amazing. Keep it up!
Awesome
This episode you could say you had a micro-cast for a microstate
13:11 Distant throat singing
Novaak Djokovic
OH YES MONGOLIA WE HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS ABOUT
Hey Barbs! I'm looking forward to the Mongolia episode, it seems to be quite an intriguing country. Expecting to learn some cool stuff. Hope you live up to the expectations.
Amazing phisical geography
forgot to mention they got rekt by club Brugge 0-4
The netherlands next?
When you know the whole country blindly because F1...
I hope Ken does the Philippines episode. ????
Half-American KING ? I THINK WE NEED TO LIBERATE MONACO
Hey, you included Meghan Markle in the American princesses and she married into the British royal family not Monaco's . Love the videos!!
11:09 Money, Money, more Money :D
Again an amazing knowledge about tiny country . Make one on my country Pakistan ???? ????????????????????????????????????????
From the most dense to the least dense
I was twice in Monaco, really chill place. My dad even met Prince Albert while waiting for me and my mom outside of a shop
I do not understand the scheduling problem. Can't Noah just beat someone up in order to fix the issue?
F1 fan anyone?
finding answer for, why it's flag are the same as indonesia. seems like barb didn't know it,
from the most densely populated country to the least for next week
Barb do more episode about francophone countries("Québec",The Carabeans,ex-French Africa etc...) cuz it's really cool and interesting as always....... DO THE FRENCH REGIONS NEXT PLEASE!!!!!
So small you see regular sized buildings on the map. Wack
I was named after Prince Rainier!! I was happy you didn't slaughter the name. Great episode!
Oh boy I can't wait for Mongolia!
You can tell how pissed Barby is in this episode haha
Hello ?? I'm living near Monaco so I can give my experience about this place : - walking in ???? is very impressive. there are so many buildings built really close to each others. - Bc of the lack of space, there is so much underground tunnel for cars but also for people only. these tunnels are very clean - globally all the country is very clean, the path is colorful (compared to France) and being in Monaco give you this felling when you are in a very luxurious Hotel. - The most popular place is probably the Casino. If front of it, there is a little roundabout and Sooo much luxurious cars are parked : Maserati, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Jaguar, and a lot of Rollce-Royces. - The train station in completely build underground but not like the big cities : to go out you just have to take a little tunnel and without taking stairs, you find yourself on the road. - During Summer the city organizes some Fireworks with a theme (I watched the Portugal one) - Globally the whole French Riviera is very rich, especially the cities in front of the see. The houses are very luxurious, and some are gigantic. I visited the house of the Russian n°3 of gaz and he had: one parking with around 10 magnificent cars, 2 buildings (3 floors) with one smimming pool for each. One of the smimming pool was literally around 200 square meters ?? - The littoral is deserved by 4 roads : three are along the mountain who faces the see and the Highway is impressive : we surfed between sky, see and mountains bc there is tons of tunnels, bridges above the valleys. - This region is very cool, the climate is very soft especially during winter. I'm going to school with only shirt and sweat whereas we are in November. So if you visit Europe one day, don't forget to chek the Mediterranean cost. if you like luxous and altitude, French riviera is made for you but if you prefer big cities and spaces : The Spanish cost is nice and the Italian one too (near Roma). if you have any suggestion, say it ^^
Yo why doesn't he have 2M subs yet?
So you can buy a square mm for 45 $ still cant afford it
Haha... they got the title in 16-17 and then got absolutely DESTROYED by PSG 7-1 XD Well that was dreadful XD AND 16-17 THEY EVEN WENT TO THE SEMIS IN THE UCL XDXDXDXD
YES Hannover was mentioned
???When France protects Monaco
Ken did a great job hosting
So, let me get this straight, we will get from the smallest functional nation, with the highest population density, to the nation that was responsable for the greatest continous empire world that the world has ever seen, which today has the smalest population density in the world?
3:18 Wrong. There are 10000 sq cm in a sq m.
At 8:26 you said that the letter ë is not in the french langage or the italian langage, but In French, we use it. (For exemple, the word Christmas in french is: Noël)
Monaco FC ain’t so hot this season
This is ... ummmm..... interesting
I will never be able to unsee the praying giraffe
In Monaco you find the hottest farmer ever!
Can't wait for flag Friday ???? ???? ????
Monaco to Mongolia. A place that is packed with people to a place that seems like nothing
Wrong barbs in French we have an e that has 2 dots like ë
Hey, today we are celebrating Diwali (Or festival of lights) and this is a good gift. ????
ü ë should be also in German
LOVEEE
Ya boy got that israeli bus
I’m not good with Math but the calculation in 3:15 isn’t it a bit odd? Correct me please...
YoU fOrGoT StEfAnO cOlEtTi Basically, He's the crappy Version of Charles Leclerc
"whatever keeps me employed." I like his attitude.
Yo Barbz, funny fact: The Palm island in the UAE is made by a Dutch company...
Monaco and Indonesia have the same flag's colour but different size. Give like if you are Indonesian and Monageques :)
Geography now, Vietnam Reason: im a Vietnamese.
Indonesia its way more better then monaco love from japan
2:23 hey! this is an Israeli bus!
I had been waiting for this since the letter M started.
Hey hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco Hey Monaco hey [Swedish] Monaco
Ken is so adorable ??
Rich country
10:29 I looked away for a sec and heard that they’re celebrating “princess hangover”
Please Monaco, take Bono for yourselfs. Thanks from all of Ireland.
GG Ken..
When will u do singapore
INDONESIA PANCASILA!
I have been there, not to boast. Beautiful country! I was in Monte Carlo, or Port Hercule. I landed in Nice and took the train with my family. Very expensive apartments I remember, in the real estate street businesses.
Ken is cute ??
Bro Roger Moore doesn't live there anymore... He died last year
Cyprus doesn't have an all-time circus... and Monaco has... HOW? WHY? I HATE MY LIFE!
8:29 these two letters do exist in french ! In words like Noël (Christmas) or capharnaüm (mess).
My fav episode.
Well done bruts.. Cheers 2 the assistant
Ken > Barby
Lily Safra is a very peculiar figure (she is a philantropist, social activist, like many billionaires who don't really have a real job, but want o appear prodcutive): she has married three or four times with millionaires or billionaires. Her last husband died in a very mysterious way in their Monaco penthouse, he was one of the billionaire Safra Brothers who have built a banking empire in Brazil. Altough controversial she has donated lots os money to charity and is specially reagarded by the Jewish community in Brazil and abroad. There is an unathorized biography of her called "Gilded Lilly" that is not really well written, but has all the salacious details of her very sercretive life.
Holy cow! It was going to be released today?!
I Love Monaco???? And I Love Poland???? I am From Indonesia ????
the netherlands!!!!
The flag though
Is the Netherlands going to go under the T or the N?, I would personaly put it under the N because the dutch name for the country is Nederland. Keep up the great videos!
Monaco is an awesome place! So busy but very pretty.
Fitting that you have uploaded this less than 24 hours after AS Monaco's 4-0 defeat at home to Club Brugges
Can't wait for ?????? ???? (Mongol Ulus.
How long have you and ken been friends?
The Brazilian lady you don't know what she does... Her late husband had banks and she invested in real estate herself.
MONGOLIA!!!!!
Anyone here speak the Monegasque language?
Wallis Simpson never was a princess though
Any one noticed that when ken put the water on him he already was wet?
Can't wait for the Ukraine episode
Does Monaco have more reclaimed land percentage wise than the Netherlands
I hope Noah’s okay
if i ever go to Monaco it would be Nice but only a day trip without spending any money lol
Thanks for football ??
can’t wait for Mongolia????????????????????
I was Monaco, pretty country and most of the stuff you mentioned I saw, would recommend anyone who has time and money to visit this place. (Though Nice is the best town)
I'm waitin to change ricciardo with Charles LeCrelc as a f1 fan you pissed me off
I hear "Prince Albert", I think "Prince Albert piercing" ?? sorry folks
After Mongolia is Montenegro write ?
Another Great video! Thanks
Finally mongolia When i first watch Geography now I thought i can watch it in july But 4 months later we are finally here lol proud ????
2 square kilometer area yet 4 kilometers of coast - IMPRESSIVE! ??
go Ken!
Barby, Saracens are Arabs. The Europeans back in the day called Arabs Saracens.
Didn't find you cheerful in this episode which you generally are.
I bet 5 imaginary Austro Canadian pesos that Barb won't pin or reply to my comment
They should change the country's name to Moneyco
It's remarkable how there is always a significant amount of Belgians in those luxurious coastal cities. Especially in Spanish cities, such as Marbella, Benidorm, Ibiza ...
0:58 ha... this video is only an hour ago
Monaco football team is one of the most succesful french team. (Well, not this year obviously). They are part of the "big four" of the league with PSG, OL and OM. They are reputated to be one of the most succesful football formation center (I don't know how you call that in english, I just merely translated word by word from french). Stars like Henry, Trezeguet or more recently Mbappé came from ASMonaco
What about Morocco?
Flag look like indonesian flag.
Love your channel
I actually quite like the postcard background
Background TOO COMPLICATED
In Indonesia, some people still debating about which one the first country to use Red and White flag. ?? But I think Monaco first.
Wallis simpson is NOT a Princess
From most densely populated to least populated. It's gonna be wild next episode. Also, love to Monaco from Luxembourg! Micro buddies!
Europes little Singapure
2:20 Didn't know Israeli buses go to Monaco
Mongolia episode: Yurt gonna love it
Do Kanye West next
Flag of Monaco similiar to flag of Indonesia. The different is in scale ratio of the flag
definitely not Indonesia
I'm really sorry Barbs but you did not just say that the U.A.E. is better at land reclamation than the Netherlands. We invented it, we have the largest and oldest artificial Island and pretty much the entire western half of our country is reclaimed teritory from the sea. If there's anyone good at dealing with water it's we Dutch.
When I visited Monaco 14 years ago, there was no McDonald's :D
roger moore died by the way.
Flag of Monaco is similiar to flag of Indonesia. But, the different is in scale ratio
fan flag friday will be really fun, greeting from your twin flag country
only countries that must be bombed are these micro nation tax havens
Monaco : What if Central Park had a King and a Casino.
I was able to visit Monaco in July of 2014 (although it rained hard that day). It's amazing how surreal it all seemed to me. I got to visit the Buddha Bar! Also I'd like to point out that the next episode will be the exact opposite in terms of population density which I find fantastic... for some reason. EDIT: I forgot to mention that they have PUBLIC TOILETS by the port.
I've been to Monaco. Visited the cathedral, oceanographic museum, Japanese gardens and saw Prince's Palace (outside). Nice place. It was day tour from Nice.
Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Turkey please Im tired to asking for that come on!
Monaco Monacan make a lot of Monomoney $€£¥ ??
Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken. Do it now or your fired.. KEN I SWEAR
Where is geography now turkey
I actually like the office setting it's colorful and pleasing to the eyes. The black background was okay but I think this one is actually better. But except the closet at the back i hope put something to cover that. Haha. I kinda really like this background. Maybe put some more interesting things like maybe a statue? Or a globe? I dont know anything perhaps something thatll rep the country you're discussing. Hehe. Ive been watching since the A episodes haha. Still gonna watch even after my country the Philippines! Hehe I'm trying to write something too to send to ur email. Hope it could help for your research for the the Philippines episode. More power to GN!
“Oh and the country is shaped like a praying giraffe” only fact need to know facts here on Geography Now
I'm always fooled whenever you show Monaco's flag thinking it is Indonesia
indonesia again?
Can't wait for the mongolia episode!!! I like mongolia!????
SACCA THESE NUTS
MONACO!
2:21 israely bus HAHA
As a mongolian i waited this news for 2 years.
Yay Mongolia!!im not even Mongolian or a citizen but Yay!!
So france managed to get a county of itself outside the EU to escape regulation and create this lil rich tax haven? Got it.
12:22 dang Monaco needs to brush they're teeth
The letters ü and ë are actually uncommon but used in French (but the accent is considered a modifier, so not a full letter): they serve to indicate that two letters should not be pronounced together if they are usually. For example "Aigüe"/"Aiguë" (=acute, both variants exist), or "Cigüe"/"Ciguë" (=hemlock, idem): the "u" is pronounced ([egy] and [sigy]), as opposed to "Aigue" or "Cigue" ([?g] and [sig], the first is an old word for water, aquamarine = "aigue-marine", the second does not exist). And for the ë, it is one of the four e accents with é, è and ê ("Noël"=Christmas, "poële"=stove)
Hong Kong: Hold my beer on the skyscrapers and my reclamation Macau: Hold my beer on my casinos Btw, I do hope that you do Hong Kong and Macau even if they aren't countries. So that people know they aren't just skyscrapers and/or casinos
RESTORE THE QING!
I’m waiting so much the Poland video
Time for Poland ??
Monaco looks like an amputated sea horse to me
9:57 Looks perfect =D
Anyone else want to know why there is a picture frame hanging on the wall in the closet?
please make something about the Philippines
HM
Every RECOGNIZED micronation (No, not you Liberland and Sealand) in Europe is tiny principalities that still existed a millennium or more ago, but they were bigger in those days.
Excellent video. However you made one small mistake at 8:27 The letter ë does exist in French, like for instance in "Noël", which means "Christmas"
in 2:22 the 100 bus line is Israeli Egged city bus?
Like the new background barbs
It's funny that here in France many people consider Monaco as a French city rather than as an independent country
I thought the city was called Monte Carlo
I would rather you record videos in your office than in the studio. Stay cool stay tune????
I am excited for every new episode
I've had the pleasure of visiting Monaco about a month before the Grand Prix in 2010. Probably the most humble (price wise) place in the country is the ironically named "Casino" Supermarket. Believe it or not, there's not only a car park but also a tourist shop within the famous tunnel under the Hotel de Paris. The funny thing is the car park me and my family parked in had toilets (bathrooms) had what I think of as "flattering lighting", in other words the lighting makes it seem like everyone has a healthy sun tan ??
What? I think it is Indonesia.. You should remake the Indonesia episode, it was too simple
CANNOT UNSEE THAT PRAYING GIRAFFE
I like ken Though he’s been out of your dungeon to much Barbie
Also I suggest you should have had mentioned why is Monaco so small
You should’ve mentioned the Grimaldi curse that the monks allegedly put on the royal family for disguising themselves to take the fortress.
Cool
Monaco looks like a knight Chess
The difference between Monaco and the next county, mongolia, could not be bigger.. :)
Happy Diwali to all my friends ??
I swear, Paul looks more and more like a snack every video. He’s hot. ????
Thank you for saying football as well ^^
Yay, Indonesia again
Monaco
501th!!!!
I went bankrupt from just watching this episode.
1:05 A pray giraffe country shape, very intersting =D
The only time I think Olivier Beretta will ever be featured in a video above 1 mil views...
What is soccer?
Can you do sweden some time
I didn't know Indonesia had a second name
Shoutout to my fellow peeps who cannot afford a sq cm of Monaco!
Oh Mongolia, my favourite history subject!
Boy I love ken, can we get more of him. He’s great
Oh, I’m a little early I guess, do Uruguay u hear nothing about it lol
12:45 France is their best France...
Dang it I forgot this was Geography Now and not Formula 1
Nice video i want to go to monaco
a n y w a y
YAZZZZZZZZZZ GEOGRA-PEEEEEPSSS
Ken got his maths wrong, there are 10000 square centimetres in a square meter (100 × 100) meaning a square centimetre of real estate is $4.50 on average
Monaco's flag looks exactly like Indonesia's lag :P
Wasn't Roger Moore dead?
The green bus is egged bus in Israel lol
My country <3
MONEY MONEY AND MORE MONEY
Monaco fc played in the Champions final against Porto at home and lost the game????
As Indonesian, i'm going "hmmmmmm"
Close to Philippines episode
So does Ken just hang out on the floor for every episode? 3:13
11:22 Charles Leclerc Matthew Gallagher intensifies
No Prince Albert in a can joke, denied.
kiko
Pls.. Do the Philippines????
"it looks like a praying girrafe" I can't unsee it
11:22 SHAAAAAAAARL
Je me amor monsgasques
You messed up the history, its Ligurians then Greeks (then Romans and Franks but no matter) and then Saracens
If you have so high real estate and commodity prices, what's the need for taxes. Just like Dubai.
Oh US people and the metric system...
A shady place whose only purpose is enabling the one percent to avoid paying any taxes. Crap like this is why poverty exists.
you should have a video about the international system of units and the body parts the US has to measure stuff
kenny got hot. when? ??
Ahh my 3 least Favorit contry after Luxemburg and Lichtenstein
Can you please do Yemen next please
A very informative video about a very rich micro state and you have nailed it again, Barby. Keep it up! My suggestion for your next video is the Netherlands, I hope one day I will see that video on your channel.
#JusticeForKen
We want more of Ken in Geography Now!
We do use ü and ë in French though
1:04 that looks more like a gun
video about nepal please
10000 sq cm = 1 sq m so land actually costs $ 4.5 per sq cm
I really liked Ken's section. He's gotten better at presenting
I'll be honest, when I saw the thumbnail I thought, "I already saw the Indonesia episode" and then I checked the preview title. "Oh right, Monaco." clicks
Need Indonesia Subtitle Please ????
two little sidenotes: - AS Monaco (the country's football/soccer team) is basically a talent farm; for example, Kylian Mbappé played for the team before going to PSG. - on the famous people, i would also mention Daniel Elena which is the co-driver of the famous french rally driver Sebastien Loeb (they won nine world rally championships between 2004 and 2012).
Monaco has the ugliest denture
"Whatever keeps me employed!" Next episode: "Ken, you're fired!"
Yes, Mini Monaco has been covered!!
I actually can't see anything except a praying giraffe staring at me now. Geography Now teaches you what you want to know and what you NEED to know!
french subtitle please
Finally
1 cm2 is worth 4.5 dollars then..... Yeah, check it....
Very informative video, probably as close as I will ever get to Monaco. Thanks for the info. Now please give Ken a raise or a new place to live...like the garage. ;-)
One day I will live there or Luxembourg
Oh yeah Mongolia!
10.2k views ready? Guess I'm late. Oh well
No caption lol
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE!
It looks more like a lobster, honestly.
With those googly eyes Monaco looks like it's stupidly grinning, with very bad teeth.
que que
monaco history ..... money, money, money, money, more money <--- lol !! Moneyco oops i mean Moneyco .... errr .... Monaco yea ~
WHO LIVES IN A ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF ITALY? ...
Wait for it....
Step 1. Hire a mercenary army Step 2. Invade Monaco Step 3 ....... Step 4. Take all the cash and get the hell out of there before the French arrives Step 5. Profit?
Ken is love, Ken is life
Loving the 3D graphics of Monaco in the vid!
FINALLY A NEW EPISODE
It's 3:45 in the morning no biggie
Getting hyped for the upcoming throat singing
Just Monaco
A thing that make me interest with this video is...flag. Love Indonesia from Malaysia.
I want Ken to spunk in my mouth
If you are a crazy hitchhiker like me, you can also go down from the gas station on the highway over Monaco, winding road without a shoulder (medium safe, but it is possible) :D
somehow the video is not availible for me there is an error code "Watch-ID: SCG1bz3YKnsk256D"
now i cannot see monaco, without thinking of a praying giraffe
Casino Royale is Montenegro, not Monaco
YES DANIEL RICCIARDO, JENSON BUTTON AND CHARLES LECLERC GOT MENTIONED YES CHARLES GOOD LUCK AT FERRARI NEXT SEASON... but Felipe Massa didn’t ??
finally early !!!!!!
If this place was next to america the americans would tax the crap out of it and try to get rid of the prince if he didnt play ball.
U just forgot that Monaco was not always this small It was big but France just occupied 70% of the land
sorry bro quality of this episode is not that good
Good
Je ne comprends pas l'anglais, ça serait cool des sous-titres en français merci.
1080p when
Imagine what would happen if u put a bomb in the middle of the monaco...
Hello brothers and sisters from another.... uh.... flag! ????????
Keep giving those small descriptions in famous people segment! I appreciate it very much!
Why don't you use a black curtain as the background like you did it in the last episode
Il live in Monaco and everything was pretty accurate, good job!
Indonesians will be not impressed with the similarity of the flag...
About the brasilian bilionair: the Safra family owns a huge bank here.
Wow Indonesia is this rich (Sorry JK)
I love your French pronunciations! ??
why is the quality so bad
why won't they just join france?
“The French army protects them” so their defense sucks
6:30 Or you could have duel citizenship.
THEY CHANGED THAT!!! "if there's no heirs the rule would pass to France"
So Monaco has almost the same amount of people as this video has pixels? Hehe
Please do a video about my country Nepal
Free advertising for Formula One, lol.
The country that is almost the same with indonesia (flag)
12:30 Hah, Monaco has bad teeth
I love this place
First when i saw the thumbnail, i think this is Indonesia Episode. When i Check the Title oof it's Monaco. And why only in 360p
Sq cm would be 4.5$ btw.. 1 sq m = 10000 sq cm
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????
Casino royale, occured in montenegro, not monaco
Guyz, Plz Fix The 360p only Problem
12:10 It shape looks like evil-laughing person...
Is it just me or its stuck at 360p ?Do i need to sacrifice Ken to get 1080p ?
I am Cambodian and i study with a north korean and they are actually friendly but rather quiet and they actually use gmail facebook and live freely like normal freshman.
MONEYYYYY
$45,000 per square meter = $4.50 per square centimeter 1 square meter = 10,000 square centimeters
can't wait for Saudi Arabia
Money talks!
"If you're on a budget" Then you're in the wrong place!
Thanks for getting me on 90 in my Geography Test
0:14 Casino Royale was in Montenegro.
Isn't Monaco a French city?
Now am I early or not?
F1 monaco gp
Yay! You guys mentioned F1! In Monaco episode!.. Which really shouldn't be that surprising.. :/
The episode I've been waiting for!!
Actually ü and ë exist in French Before the reform of French orthography from 1990 ü didn't but it now does — even if it's not always used. Ë always existed though and is constantly used.
Happy diwali
>Representative of the Holy See >Has massive casino Lucky
So did you talk about the Prince's children?....
11:48 Can we just take a week or so to appreciate the beautiful chin of Coulthard SO square, so sharp, just amazing, absolutely incredible
11:22 SHAAAARLLL
no comments except for replies? neat!
so low quality
yo did you just reupload the Indonesia episode?
Je comprends toujours pas pourquoi Monaco n'est pas une part de la France (Ah oui,les taxes mdr) Nan mais plus sérieusement il manque juste du bleu derrière le blanc de leurs drapeau et on est bon
Mongolia finally!!! Been waiting for Mongolia almost all of my lifetime
this is the original red and white flag of Monaco. Indonesia flags is edit copy paste of red and white from monaco .
Monaco ????????????
When you are literally the entire agricultural sector.
45000€ per m² would equal only 4.5€ per cm²
Hey look, it's still 360p I'm early Edit: here's some jokes "Is iT InDoNeSiA?2?2?2??2"
Great presentation as always
The flags of Poland, Indonesia and Monaco always confuses me.
No puns in the episode DISAPPOINTED
Dude it 360 quality yo
The quality i-
I love Barb & Ken, they're Batman & Robin or Del Boy & Rodney. ??
You know you're early when 1080p isn't available yet
Indonesia!!! Oh wait...
Micro states are alway interesting
All this time I thought monaco was a city in france now I know what it is ??????
You know Geography Now is not Geography Now without Barby making Ken's life harder or is it the other way around...? ????
Finallyyyy
Love Monaco from France :)
Ah finally new episode!??????????????
M O N E Y M O N E Y M O R E M O N E Y
oh ok
Ken, at least for now, is not fired!
????????
So basically if a Manhatten apartment was a country
For a second I was shocked if you remake the Indonesia episode from the thumbnail ????
So waiting for the Mongolia episode
poor barbs, first you find out on a live stream your friends are having a party and your not invited, then, you have to awkwardly film a video, and all your friends bailed on you. its alright mate, i know its not that big of a deal, but its alright, the postcard wall adds character to the video anyway
3:03 what country is that?
There are 100cm in 1m, however there are 10,000cm² in 1m² (100*100=10,000), so it costs more like $4.50/cm², and not $450.
Yay love the dutch reference!
I clicked so fast on the video that the HD option isn't available yet xD
Heart this comment or lose 1.2 M subs
I love microstates
When u thought it was Indonesia part 2 lol
Let us build a replica of monaco in mongolia! Yay!
Yay! Indonesia in Europe.
As mechanical engineer it really annoys me that you got the square centimeter price incroerect it should have been 4,5 euros. Apart from that keep up the good work barbz
Charles Leclerc is a future world Champion.
Finally
why dont they just join france?
omg u posted this on my mom's birthday I hope everyone will say happy birthday to her! including you barby! :)
Cannot be played on mobile devices.
Rich countries speak French: Monaco, Western Switzerland, Luxembourg. Poor countries speak English: South Sudan, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somaliland, Malawi, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Fidji, etc.
Dude, if 1sq.m is 45000 dollars, then 1sq.cm is worth of 4.5 dollars
It's 5:25am but its worth it!
Flag is looks like Indonesian flag ????
Whoa... for a really small size ...Monaco is a really interesting country
"The country is quite diverse" Shows only white people. Leftists : REEEE!
That’s a lot of money
omg i'm so early it's only 360p
I bet if Geograpeeps living in Monaco looked closely enough they can see their house in the thumbnail, crazy
As an avid F1 fan, I have been waiting for this episode for AGES. Awesome video GN!
0:15 the laugh I give to my brother when it's my turn to play with the Xbox
Video on the regions of Italy?
3:02 Oh you didn't. We dutchies get mad haha
Just putting it out there... all running gags aside (as a subscriber since Australia), Ken has a much nicer "on camera" persona and method of presentation than Noah
???? ????
It looks more like a Giraffe taking a picture with a phone
why just 360p?
Finally. Don't repeat it again, Barb.
HEY, DATS OUR FLAG Copy Cat milionarss
Indonesia flag omg
Ah, the beauty of a free capitalistic nation.
Barby, in preparation for the Mongolia episode, don't forget to mention Malaysia in the friendzone segment, because it involves the relationship between the Malaysian government and the murder of a Mongolian citizen.
I’m never looking at Monaco the same again ??
Yehey Another Episode ! ??
Ah 144p we meet again...
Is this the last principality
AWESOME CHANNEL!!! IT'S TIME TO LEARN GEOGRAPHY NOOOOOOOOW!!!!
I have heard of this country many times but never really knew where it was
Ahhh Monaco , the country with the toughest Grand Prix racetrack and the one where Iron Man 2 was shot. Huge love and respect to them from India
I'm Early bois
hey, Barb. 45,000 dollar/sq.m lead to 4.5 dollar/sq.cm since 1 sq.m. is 100x100 = 10,000 sq.cm.
I hope Noah is okay
how u treat Ken shows us that you are really good friends :D Keep it up Barbs
Nice episode, Happy diwali world
$45000 per square meter is equal to $4.5 per square cm.
so early for the first time
And all these years I thought Monaco was part of Italy.
I like this Ken guy better than Noah, he's actually funny and endearing. Noah comes off as arrogant. Sorry Noah.
It's tiny ??
Its like 5 AM, odd upload time haha.
yay
WHOOHOOO I'm not from Monaco but I was so excited for this episode since I don't know much about it. Love your videos Barbs, Love from China! -Aidan
Barby will soon be living in Monaco, and he'll invite all the Geograpeeps to his mansion

YAY new GN video!! i get so AMPED for GEOGRAPHY!!! LETS GO. oh btw its 6am.

Anyone new to this channel, the series is ALPHABETICAL. Wait until your country's initial letter episode comes out
I Prefer The New Setting & Space :)
1 square metre is 10000 square centimetres. not 100
Woow
too early
One thing making me upset geography now is giving nice detail about geography and paul and is friends making nice work and also doing extreme hard work to sum up details and video recording but why on earth subscriber not increasing atleast it should have 30million subscriber for his wonderful channel .i think people are not interested in geography . To make channel promote larger im going to tell my friends and collegues watch this channel compulsory . I was searching for geography related channel some time ago but this 1000 percent wonderful . I think those watched this channel will agree. Good day paul. ????
For me, Ken can execute well than Noah. Just saying.
Hi from Malaysia
Monaco is a french garden
Indonesian Normies be like :wHaT tHe HeCk WiTh ThE fLaG
Actually you need 4.5 $ per cm2, because there are 10 000 cm2 in a m2, not 100.
Indonesia's Mirror Image
360P ! why ?
The first 100 comments are lucky
I want to hear somebody's story attempting to travel to Monaco that gone wrong due to how ridiculously expensive it is And tbh the video is longer than i expected (i expect it to be around 10 minutes lol)
Omg some dude in my French class named Ken did a project on Monaco lol
