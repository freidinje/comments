The crooked "E"
Enron sounds like L. Ron. Therefore Scientology is a rip off. Change my mind.
Twenty 0 6

Great movie!
lol his subscribers are at 401k right now xD
Could you do a video on WorldCom? It is regarded almost synonymously with Enron in the accounting world in terms of fraud that would go on to change the landscape of public accounting and financial reporting.
Can we get an Arthur Andersen video
Well now I understand that Robin Williams joke about Arthur Andersen ??????
There is no such thing as lost money. Someone made money. And probably a LOT of it.
do something on dot com bubble stuff. like pets.com
What was their real number? You didn't show their stats number. This was a sort of ELI5, a bit desappointed.
Chanos is said to make a killing shorting Enron stock.
Read the book...
"We play by all of the rules. We stand by our word. We mean what we say. We say what we mean." - an asshole
Perfect informative vid.
I'd be interested in your take on the rise of Qualcomm and their current controversy with monopolization and licensing practices
Twenty O one? Wtf thats fucked up man, its two thousand and one!
I rarely celebrate someone’s death but with Ken Lay I did, he and Skilling caused huge personal harm to thousands of regular employees, they triggered divorce, bankruptcies and suicides. I hope his heart attack was painful and terrifying to him. They represent the perils of ultra capitalism where greed is not just good but justifies deception and theft.
The video really starts at about 4:30, everything before that is padding to hit 10 minutes. You're welcome
Please do a video on marchFirst...
I wonder if Jeff Skilling's brother will get him a job as a coffee boy at WGN TV when he gets out of jail
Lay and Skilling were lying sacks of shit that encouraged a culture of evil corruption.
I'm addicted to your videos lol.
They made so many laws after all of this. Now accounting is alot harder and the standards change constantly. You can have studends only one year apart and all of them will be practicing diffrent GAAP. It sucks as a student, you might be taking accounting one, next semester you have to relearn how to do somthing because they decided the last way wasnt transparent enough. This is supper annoying and i want to smash my head through a window more then i want to even when im making a statement of cash flows.
Damn i want to subscribe but the thing im intersted in you only made 2 videos for this one and the bernie madoff
0:00 "this is the most complicated shit ever" aand it's just a ponzi scheme
Does the E in Enron remind anyone of the E in Evil Corp in Mr. Robot?
I'm willing to bet most people under the age of 25 don't remember the Enron scandal.
Fuckers got my college money...
Houston was devastated because of this... it’s influenced our culture and infrastructure. The building is now occupied by chevron
Thanks Obama
You sound like Walter Jr from Breaking Bad
3:04 Just shut up and take my money! lol
President George W. Bush’s close personal friendship with Ken Lay is one of the reasons why I’ll always harbor a dislike for him. As Enron was responsible for a long series of rolling blackouts in California in 2000, the electricity bills of the state’s residents went through the roof. The cost of electricity was too expensive and the blackouts ultimately cost the state $30 billion. Energy executives and California’s governor knew something was wrong and so too did President Bush who publicly stated that the best way to manage that crisis was to be good citizens. Translation: “California is a blue state so why should a Republican bother to help?”
We have a former Arthur Andersen employee on our team and she is the most difficult person I've ever had to work with by a WIDE margin
I hate it when my 'mircophone' is too high.
I watched that movie at school
The Great Depression comes to mind. So much wrong doing and all the changes - Yeah, right
I would say no because they were closed down in 2007 3:00 Also no company expands that fast or booms that fast...
Work a few normal jobs, don't party, don't spend and you'll be a millionaire by your 30s, and stay away from women.
I hope if I was asked by my investor about getting Enron stock I would've said "Nah, gimme some of that Apple stock, and maybe some in this Amazon bookstore thing"
I like whoever this company man is and his videos but the background music in this video sucks
its not "twenty oh-one" you weird fuck. It's "two-thousand one". Say it like a normal human
"Two thousand one", "Two thousand six" Sorry, don't mean to be a jerk.
My professor just played your vid for the whole class as part of his lesson. Props!
Hi! I work at EY. More specifically, the Assurance area. That means I'm an auditor. So I have a small correction to make: Contrary to popular belief, auditors don't chase fraud. We don't actually care about it. We only have one procedure to detect fraud (Journal Entries) and even it isn't guaranteed to work every time. An auditor job is to cross a company internal financial and accounting records. If both say the same thing, we sign on to those records. There are SOC audits (System and Operation Controls) that audit the inner functioning of the company. The main thing is, we work on the assumption that the company isn't lying to us. And 99% of the time, they aren't. Auditors work based on materiality and sampling. We don't go through every account and record to look for fraud. That is why you will never see an auditor to guarantee 100% accuracy on our statements. We only guarantee "an reasonable level of accuracy". A 100 billion company can have a few million not accounted and be completely ok for it's auditors because it's not material.
TL;DNR they lied their tits off.
Sounds like Sal O’nella
Enron fucked California bad.
I still remember the rolling blackouts here in Cali in the early 2000s from the mismanagement of power due to Enron's tactics.
Capitalism DOES NOT WORK!
Do the Hudson’s Bay Company! They have such a cool history and we’re one the largest landowner in the world.
Here's a video idea: the Bre-X scandal. It was a Canadian mining company that specialized in gold and other precious metals. They claimed they had aquired the minera l rights somewhere (I think it was in Tailand, but my memory might be wrong). The company's geologist claimed that the area was tbe highest consentration of gold he ever saw. The company's shares sky-rocketed. Then, the news leaked that the geologist was completely wrong, and the shares dropped below 5 cents.
I know Republicans will howl to the moon, but you see the answer to this is GOVERNMENT REGULATION of the right kind. Imagine if the government had said "no you don't get to pick who does your audit. there are five major firms. they will each do your audit every year in turn". As I learned from watching "The Big Short" if a rating agency or accounting firm has an incentive to lie to appease their clients, they will. Forcing rotation will ensure they can do their job, because they know they will get paid even if they tell the truth.
Just bought some blockbuster stock!!!
Big oof
Enron & 9/11 are connected...
Honestly
I want to commit fraud too!!!
The documentary about this company was incredible! I couldn't believe the turn of events. I don't think the best writers in Hollywood could have done better.
rambling presentation
The audit firms should be criminally liable for any variances or discrepancies of the financial and managerial accounting of the companies they audit.
The Enron Scandal was used to drive up the cost of Electricity; any thing else loss or gained was just a side show.
twenty-O 1 that kills me a bit XD still an interesting video
After Enron, Lehman Brothers. When Fortune says you’re a top company, you’re a scam.
I used to work at a chemical plant and Enron had a unit in our facility. When this all went down, we watched them all walk out with their belongings. Was really sad to watch so many people lose their jobs and pensions.
Jeff Skilling got out of prison today. Thought you might want to know.
Crazy to think that there are kids learning this in high school today who weren't even alive when it happened. I remember the problems with the power grid that summer. There were ripple effects along the entire Western grid. Seattle's skyscrapers turned out their lights at night that year to conserve power.
Ah, the good old days when Company Man called the years by their correct names..
You said "twenty oh one" and "twenty oh six" instead of "two thousand and..." lol what a goof
my grandparent invested with them. and got fucked over by them. i still have some coffee cups and pens somewhere.
Hopefully Arthur Anderson auditors that are responsible did some time.
@8:22 Twenty oh six? Do you mean two thousand and six? Back to high school for you.
"20 year contract with blockbuster" Lmao
Got a "get rich quick" scam commercial during this video. The irony...
One can say a major part of the scandal has to do with stock manipulation. A number of inside executives probably knew what was happening. They were first to own Enron stock and first to exit before the big downward spiral and made millions in profits. The rest who didn't sell in time lost their investments.
Enron makes me look like Mother Teresa!! - Lucifer
Enron is exactly what you get when you give big business exactly what they want and what they all want is to do whatever they want when they want with absolutely no oversight.
I live in Houston and I knew 2 people who work there and they told me it was great to work there before the collapse
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
What was the Jewish role in this?
Something went enron-g
My porn name is Ken Lay
Twenty-oh-one? wtf ??
Another brilliant video, I have 2 questions - 1. Didn't Enron realize that putting fake numbers in their books, etc crash someday.. There is no way out of it? 2. Were the audit company CEO punished? Given jail time? Anything?
I seen the movie, it’s a good one. Also check out “the big short” about the housing market bubble. Good work man, new sub
M. Yass
I'm sorry, I fell asleep through most of this video.
didn’t they buy a nuclear reactor in india or something?
This review is very partisan
As someone going to school for forensic accounting, this is so fucking interesting to me. Great video.
THE GAIN ON THE MICROPHONE IS TOO HIGH!!!!!!!! OMG OMG OMG WTF
bruh whats ya accent?
I bet on Blockbuster back in the time they did this deal with Enron. I thought streaming + brick and mortar locations would make it much better than Netflix at the time. It's unfortunate that Blockbuster went under but Redbox and Netflix thrived.
Read the book while in prison, I think it was something like a 1500 pages, god it was dull but man was it crazy to watch it burn to the ground. Feel very bad for the employees
Nortel Networks would have never gone bankrupt if not for Enron. The Enron scandal freaked out and scared the board of directors of Nortel Networks. So they hired a law firm, WilmerHale, to check over the books. In about a month WilmerHale came to the wrong conclusion that the books were cooked. The CEO and CFO were then fired and were charged with fraud. This ultimately led the stock to crash and for everyone(customers, creditors, investors...) to loose confidence in the company. Thus Nortel went bankrupt. Several years later the CEO and CFO were found innocent of all charges that had been brought against them.
Great video but I had to watch this on 1.25x speed ??
My mom worked at Arther Anderson
I'm going to call it now - Tesla is showing a LOT of signs that Enron had in the late 90s & early 2000s.
Let me guess...company man is a CPA
Do you think 9/11 was created to divert attention from this and how a trillion was missing from the octagon?
“Twenty oh-one”
Enron Ascending: the Forgotten Years will be published next month covering the beginning of Ken Lay's career as CEO through 1996. Some surprises about how precarious Enron was during the Lay\Kinder era.
E. Corp (Mr.Robot)
Can you discuss Goldman Sachs?
Soo, what's the song playing throughout the video?
Can you name a single crime committed by Arthur Andersen? Because 9 Justices on SCOTUS said they didn’t commit any. Just curious.
Not really complicated it’s very simple. They changed the laws LITERALLY - they actually didn’t break any law. They just rigged the rules & completely manipulated the rules of accounting BUT were completely within “the law”. They did legally bribe elected officials by giving their spouses high money contracts. BUT that’s NOT illegal.
Enron was basically run by criminals. A close friend worked for Ma Bell, (AT&T), for 30 years, and was hired away by Enron to be a mid-level manager. He took his SBC, (one of the Baby Bells), retirement in a lump sum, over $400,000.00, and was convinced by Enron to put it ALL into Enron stock, (just before the crash). Yep, he lost his entire life’s retirement over-night. I also worked for SBC at the time as a power tech, and Enron was our power provider. As Enron started going under, they told the upper SBC management that if SBC would use its Emergency Generators to produce our own office power, Enron would pay us for every KW we generated, then they could sell the power that we would have used, to other customers. Of course this would have been VERY illegal, because SBC was only licensed to generate power in case of a power outage. When an SBC executive sent an E-mail out asking all power techs how much fuel we had on hand to generate our own power, (and get paid by Enron), I forwarded that E-mail to the our local Air Quality District, and THE CRAP HIT THE FAN! When the dust finally settled, SBC got a reaming by the Air Quality people, and did not follow through with Enron’s hair-brain, (and highly illegal), scheme.
These theives should have been murdered. So many people lost everything because of them.
Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is one of the most fascinating documentaries I've ever watched. My capstone made it required viewing.
I love videos like this. Content made for adults with a working brain.....not like pewdiepie....and sorry for comparing this amazing channel with that content cesspool. Keep up the great work.
Well-structured, informative videos with nice background music. You just got a new sub.
Aannd it's gone!
E Corp
what the heck is a mircophone??
"IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN" Fast forward about 7 years to the 08 collapse "SHIT WHAT ARE THE ODDS" I hate people sometimes.
“twenty oh six”
Crikey....Even after watching this and having lived through the scandal, seeing Ken Lay making his pitch in the final moments of this video has me wanting to dig up his carcus in hopes he's still alive to find out what new investment strategies he has. He was quite the bullshit artist. Totally believable even after the fact.
The Enron scandal makes for a good reminder of how easily corruption can run deep, far, and fast.
I thought ENRON was a rapper... it sounds like a rapper name! “Hey man! I’m gonna go see an Enron concert on Friday!”
Twenty-oh one? Seriously?
couldn't you find a better song for the video? jeezzzzz 10 min listening the same rhythm.. like 80s porn. damnn..
Evil corp
Do a video on Takata airbags! The worlds LARGEST recall almost 5 million airbags recalled, 3 high executives have been jailed due to neglect
Please do a video on Takata airbags!!!
PWC is a piece of shit shady accounting firm too...they pulled the same scam in India with satyam computers...almost like a blueprint of Enron... But got away Scot free... They still operate unhindered & god knows how many such scams they're helping pull off currently!!
What does Enron mean?
Biggest bankruptcy, eh? Oh boy were they wrong.
10 Minutes was 9:30 too long. They were allowed to do "mark to market" accounting. Count your potential profits 10 years from now on this year's tax return. Bush, Clinton, Bush 43...all the same. They allowed it. Corporations aren't the problem. The fucking government is the problem! But let's pass gun laws that allow the gov't to take citizens' guns, cuz that'll give the gov't less power, right? Dumb ass fuckin liberals
"well respected, has incredible revenue growth, low debt, and a solid history of unheard stock growth" Me: Incredible as in not credible, as in not to be believed; unheard of growth because it shouldn't be possible for a company to grow that quickly - seems a bit suspicious... "and if you said no, that's a foolish answer at the time" Me: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
bush started selling his stock before the enron crisis. i call it BUSHRON
So many enrons still exist. I work for one.
can you do one of TD (Toronto-Dominion) bank
I am a day trader. And I have been investing the last 4 years. Tge question is How does Enron make money? How. Dont give me the oversimplified amswer. But describe to me in depth and detail how do they make money? In Enrons case nobody knows. Hmmmm seems to good to be true. I think I will short Enron amd buy some put options no need to hedge against them. They are Enron. They cant even tell you how they make money.
everyone knows ken lay is not dead. he is partying on some carribean island with whitman, price, and haddad
So mark to market is just lying.....just posting fake numbers right?
I remember Lewis Black has a really good joke about Enron. (Don't remember the exact wording so I might be paraphrasing a bit.): If you have a company... and you can't explain in one sentence, what it does... it's illegal.
To be honest, "Enron - The smartest guys in the room" shows it's age a bit in it's understanding of the scandal (which was fairly recent at the time of the documentary's production) If you're interested in getting a more comprehensive understanding of the events, I recommend reading "Conspiracy of Fools."
I point out that Ken Lay died on an island so he got off
I liked the video, but what I was hoping for was an in depth explanation of how Enron manipulated the California Energy market. Starting with 1) Enron's core business: Natural gas, and expansion into energy trading. -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron 2) The changes in Californian law: Partial deregulation (California) vs Full Deregulation (Pennsylvania) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis#Effects_of_partial_deregulation and the parts of the law that other states had that California did not. - California lacked a California Electricity First policy, where generators of electricity could sell to other states, but first had to meet California's energy needs. - Like every other state that deregulated. 3) Yes, Megawatt laundering, Over scheduling, and Market manipulation: However no one delved into how/why Enron controlled not only the price of Electricity, but the price of Natural Gas, and How the increased price of natural gas (manipulated by Enron and other Natural gas pipeline owners) unlocked price caps on the whole sale market. 4) Also which other companies had to help Enron achieve this: * El Paso Corp. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso_Corp.#Criticism * Reliant Energy: http://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/16/business/fi-reliant16 * Dynegy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynegy#Dynegy_history & https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2002/11/18/weekinbiz.html * Duke: https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/us/california-power-failures-linked-to-energy-companies.html * Other companies: http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-energy-crisis-reparations-2014jun18-story.html * Other sources: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/blackout/ 5) Or the bankruptcies of SCE - Southern California Edison: https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html & https://www.elp.com/articles/print/volume-79/issue-11/features/industry-news/southern-california-edison-dodges-bankruptcy-bullet.html 6) Near bankruptcy of PG&E - Pacific Gas and Electric: https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/07/us/california-s-largest-utility-files-for-bankruptcy.html & https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Files-for-Bankruptcy-9-billion-in-debt-2933945.php & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company#Bankruptcy 7) Or how SDG&E - San Diego Gas & Electric avoided the financial harms that came to PG&E and SCE: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-electricity-ferc-ruling-idUSBRE87Q13K20120827 8) Or How a minor player in electricity market of California, Enron, could manipulate the market owning PGE - Portland General Electric - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_General_Electric 9) Or how California's Energy prices were linked with A) Not In My Back Yard, attitude B) Drought in the Pacific North West, C) California's reliance on Energy imports. 10) Or how the California Energy Crisis happened during Winter in California, when they had excess generating capacity. Anyways, Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room was an excellent movie, but they didn't dig deeper into the reasons why California was ripe for manipulation. PBS Frontline: Black Out California Energy Crisis did a pretty good job in film, but online is where it really thrived. Anyways, I hope this actually gets read at some point by someone, and do your own research. I think you will be blown away how simplified the movie's explanation is. 11) They didn't even explain which wall street firms helped Enron created the "Black Box" or what the "Black Box" actually did for Enron.
Watch Enron. The smartest guys in the room. It’s soo good. And u see how shady they really were.
Thank you for you video. I have never heard of mark-to-market accounting until now. I am not finish with learning accounting but i was taught accrual and cash accounting was mention.
Yes and no. If you look at the pre 2001 paperwork from enron then sure they looked good. If you asked what they did not so much. It was a hollow shell. They didn't produce anything. They didn't provide anything. They sold others services at a markup. The granddaddy of all middle men. So what did enron do? They were the front end for other companies just dead weight to be cut.
What company was more fraudulent, Enron or BreX?
9/11 attacks happened to destroy all the Enron evidence the Feds had stored in WTTC 7. Bush was VERY connected to all this. Trump. Knows and he is going to disclose the entire Scandal soon.... Very very soon.
Please do a Video with Bright sun films on his bankrupt series or your what happened series
It was Walpole.
Comment on anything? It's "two thousand six," not "twenty oh six." I have heard people say "oh six" for brevity, but you really don't accomplish a syllable reduction saying "twenty oh six," do you? Instead it just sounds dumb.
Why were the people that profited from the dirty dealings not required to repay the people who lost their pension money and the investors who got cheated?
Expect further scandals from the fracking industries who have been issuing huge amount of debt to cover their losses. Some of this debt goes well into the 2020's with no guarantee that oil will still be being produced. So how are they going to meet their debt obligations. Also our friend Donald is deregulating banks so expect even more scandals on the finance side. The World is perched on a huge debt bubble - it's going to go bang very soon.
KPMG is going the same way
So I'm not a financial person, but from what I understood of this video: Enron promised to mow the yard, but only filled up the mower before getting tired. They then claimed that since the smallest first part of the chore was done, the whole yard was basically done. They also claimed the yard would always be mowed in the future, because their imaginary friend had agreed to take over the chore. I know that's a gross oversimplification, but did I get the gist?
I'm sure Trump will hire that guy when he gets out of prison next year...
At least they had a good logo
Enron: "We are on the side of angels"
The short answer is that they "cooked the books." But that's not accurate. What they did was not report the hundreds of millions they were spending on paying people with stock options. This was 100% legal and when Congress considered changing this rule there was a major lobbying effort to stop it, and they were successful. So when people acted shocked about Eron's fall, it was seen years in advance and Congress allowed it to continue.
I think the first line in The Smartest Guys in the Room sums Enron to pretty well: “It had taken Enron 16 years to go from $10 billion in assets to $65 billion in assets. It took them 24 days to go bankrupt.”
The only comment I have is that, at the end there, you said "in American history" way too many times. Love ur vids!!
Killuminadi
Much as I hate to admit it, the best, comprehensive history on the ins and outs of Enrons rise and fall is Ken Eichenwald's book. You throw words like fraud and crime around, but the sad fact of the story is that all of the "crimes" committed were technical violations of accounting limits and interpretations of arcane relationships. Just like the mortgage crisis, 99% of what they did was legal, sanctioned and even encouraged by the government. Funny how the government is never held responsible though.
Sounds like MCI. I was there near the end and got fired i was relieved and ran. All we did was lie with word play even at the lowest of sales levels.
I’d say “we can all look back on it” as an interesting example, sure, but don’t forget there are families still affected to this day by the crimes these men willingly and knowingly perpetrated - they were the major victims of this scandal and they left with, in most cases, nothing, which meant many people who were on the brink of retirement were then forced back into the workplace to work out the remainder of their years. Meanwhile people at the top, including Jeff Skilling, knew what was going on - they engineered it. And those who paid were working families, and taxpayers, electricity consumers — the general population — and they bore the brunt of the pain their actions caused. Meanwhile that piece of shit Skilling gets a reduction of his sentence while men incarcerated for far less or even in some cases, nothing at all, spend far longer in jail than he or his class ever will.
9/11 happened
That “unheard stock growth” reminds me of Boeing today. Ditto Amazon. And gosh knows how many others.
I didn't realize that Ken Lay was dead. I remember the Enron scandal as I was a freshman in high school and in one of my classes we got Newsweek and I remember reading about ti some back at the time in Newsweek.
I'm now convinced that the inspiration for Arrested Development came from the Enron scandal.
Great video. Just want to add a few points: 1. Faking revenue is a small portion of the scandal, the big part is recognizing revenue through related party transaction where the cost and loss were literally ignored. 2. Maybe it's a good idea to bring up the SOX act as a direct consequence of this scandal, which changed everything in public company financial report. Executives are now required to sign off the financial report, so in case things go wrong they cannot argue on the court that they didn't know about it, like Skilling did.
Please do not say Twenty Oh-Six. Its pronounced Two-Thousand Six
Ahhhh Conservative personal responsibility...
Jeff Skilling is my hero.
Great videos! Keep it up :) !!!!
mark to market, you are welcome
I'll tell you what happened, something went enwrong I'm sorry
You didm't explain shit. You went over a general overview, thats it mate.
I find this video very informative. Practically speaking, despite changes in rules, this type of thing can happen again and probably will. I believe there is really only one way we can really know a company is sound and not cooking it's books – dividends. Enron, I think started to pay a dividend right before everything blew up (probably as a ruse or distraction of some sort). But when you look at a company such as Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble which have been paying dividends and raising those dividend amounts for over half a century, it means only one thing – financial soundness. Companies like Amazon and Tesla concern me. They are well respected, have lots of hype, but don't turn profits and cannot pay dividends. I hope that they don't turn out to be the next Enron.
Arthur Anderson is now Anderson Global.
see www.apfn.org/apfn/rule.htm
Then they formed EOG...at least the exploration side of their energy division did.
Maybe you really watered it down,, but it doesn't sound complecated at all. They fudged there numbers to look more appeling, and opened up side companies as a type of money laundering but with debt. meanwhile lying about their profits and stocks to investors and auditors, and pocketing the money they could. Thsts not complicated to understand at all
The Smartest Guys in the Room is also a 400+ page book that goes into WAY WAY WAY more detail and is a fantastic book.
Liz phair has a song call fuck and run. The chorus is "fuck and run" But to me it always sounds like "fuck enron".
His coffin was closed... I don'r believe that Ken Ley is dead. Probably on a private island in the Grenadines with his own 5 hole golf course.. Curious that his ill gotten gains went to his family.. If I robbed a bank and died, would my family inherent the loot?
We had a family friend who had a high level position at Enron. After shit started to hit the fan, he was found dead in his car as a supposed “suicide”. Most of us who knew him have a REAL hard time buying that Suicide explanation as he just wasn’t that type of individual. We’ll never know for sure what happened but all of us believe their was foul play afoot.
Wood U invest. -Hell no, I don't trust anything that seems too good to be true Sometimes I dont reap fat cat rewards butt I also don't get sucked down I make moderate gains with low/mid risk investment spread around.
"Whenever something seems too good to be true".....
Enron for dummies
Enron was a pack of alpha males who saw what they wanted and took it. Then, of course, all the snowflakes started whining about a bunch of ham & eggers who lost their life savings--savings that amounted to peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Ken Lay is vilified for one reason and one reason alone: he was a real MAN.
Enron was a horrible company, and it somewhat destroyed the Republican Party in ways the Republican Party has yet to recover from and may never recover from.
several years ago,I was working at a Re Power Trash to energy project. the steam turbine & generator was destroyed in a fire, so my union hall called us to do the replacement, what arrived at the job site was all the necessary items to build a new power plant. along with a group of engineers from Germany's Siemens Westinghouse, because the generator,Steam turbine had to be converted to run, I had no Idea Enron had an international arm. because all the crates were stamped "Enron Panama" our joke on the job site to the German Engineers was "At least you & us Will be getting PAID ! ! ! A year later,You know what happened. As far as I know, the power plant is still running,(At least I still see steam venting from the plant that was back in the beginning of 2018
Something must’ve went en-wrong
Great video. I’ve read the Blockbuster deal rort was under a mark-to-market accounting rule but it would have been useful to describe the exact mechanism. According to the NYTimes article they “sold” the future profits and so counted it as a financial transaction and thus classified it as revenue, with AA’s approval. The bank they sold it to had a “no loss” contract so they considered it a loan. Dodgy as frig. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2002/01/30/business/enron-s-many-strands-the-accounting-fuzzy-rules-of-accounting-and-enron.html
Funny but true, upon retirement from the Armed Forces, Enron offered me a job not sure why but my gut said no and I excepted a lower paying job at another company. I might have dodged a bullet and didn't realize it because like the other employees I would have been buy the stock as well.
what's the song?
I worked for a company in 2001 that did an analysis of Enron's publicly available financial statements for the 1998, 1999 and 2000. They concluded you could not assess their financial condition. That is always a red flag, and turned out to be true. They found the same for GE and AIG, both of which like Enron were darlings on Wall Street but needed to be rescued in the financial crash. And GE has been a poor performer now for over a decade. Lesson: If you can't understand the financial condition of a company from its public records, be careful. You are buying a guess.
Crime does pay
Hey I rewatched this video cause some one on the news mentioned Enron and compared today's current Theranos scandal, its really insane how companies can get away with lying to us until hell breaks open.
Do a video on the fall of MF GLOBAL. will learn how shady democrats were under the Obama Regime by allowing the CEO off the hook because he was the former democratic NJ Governor, and OBAMA campaign contributor.
Mark to Market accounting was the beginning of the end for that company. That was when the fraud started. Then to cover up for the fraud, they fleeced California and engineered an energy shortage to drive up prices. Ultimately, even that scam came to an end and they began stashing debt in fake companies and then that scam could not keep going and the top CEO's began selling off stock.
FUCK SOX its such a pain in the ass
I highly recommend reading the book (same name as the documentary). Goes into much more detail of the rise and thundering crash of Enron

Might be a small/odd deal to look into but what about tech website TigerDirect and Newegg if possible.
Twenty o six ?? What the fuck
at 3:22 "practically anyone who knew anything about the stock market would say to jump on it" ... and that, right there, is crux of the problem. Everyone who invests needs to finally realize, that all the stock market is...is gambling. Stop trying to elevate it like it's something more sophisticated or certain than a casino or the horse races. There is really nothing else any deeper to it. It's legalized gambling. Period. And stock brokers are just glorified bookies who give you tips based on what they THINK they are seeing, which is not always what's actually going on. Otherwise, no broker would have advised "betting" on Enron at all. And even In horse racing, a horse might APPEAR to be the fastest horse on the track based on past performance. That won't tell you a thing about how that horse will perform on the day you finally choose place bet on it. Stock Market = Gambling.
“And Ken lay is dead”
Two things. It's shocking how many people continue to put all of their money in one thing. Secondly, I hate how the leaders of major scandals like this often only get a moderate to light prison sentence. Especially the banking leaders prior to the financial crash.
Good info!
they should be execuated for the frauid
Would have made a fortune if you shorted them
the EA scandal please
...just love your videos.. ????
blockbuster was about to beat netflix to it but they got fucked over by enron, then they went out of business
Whoa.. Enron orchestrated blackouts?? This is better than a movie
I was an employee of Northern Natural Gas Company and we purchased Houston Natural Gas because we had too much money and were a target of corporate raiders. The first name chosen for the new company was Enteron which was discovered to mean a digestive track. They decided on Enron. The new company eventually severed us from the company and we were forced to sell our Enron stock. It seemed at the time it was splitting every year. I cashed in my Enron stock and reinvested it elsewhere. Some friends of mine rolled over their 401k’s back into Enron. They lost everything. I had 1/2 half of a share that eventually was worth about 1200 dollars. I never did sell that share and it went down to about a buck. I still remember Kenneth Lays wife on television complaining because they had to sell one of their homes in Vail. Unfortunately Lay was never sentenced because he died prior to his sentencing. He was never convicted because he was never sentenced. His number 2 Skilling is the brother of Tom Skilling a Channel 9 weatherman in Chicago. He is still in jail.
lol had to watch this again
Twenty-oh-six.
This is why I always look into someone or the company just to see if they are legit.
Something went Enwrong - Barbara Punkelman
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling were crooked as they come. But they weren't stupid by any means. They were actually brilliant if you consider what they managed to pull off for so long. Now, if they just would have put all that brain power into running a legitimate business....
"Enron is a company . . ." [pause in which I thought, in response]: "And we are a society."
did anyone else hear him pronounce 'money' as 'mone-y?'
Sadly, the lessons of Enron didn’t stick. The next one is just waiting to happen. Makes me worry about Bitcoin.
"We mean what we say and we say what mean." Good one.
M
My mother worked for Enron. She always talked highly of the company but due to this scandal our lives and many others were changed.
My finance teacher talked about how his old boss' company made a huge investment in Enron and his logic behind was "fellas, it's Enron". And nobody could come up with any reason to not make the investment
>twenty-oh-six You mean two thousand and six?
4:04 Twenty Oh-One??
I remember the enron scandal breaking in the news in july & august of 2001, so I have the question, is it true that the paperwork/evidence for the enron collapse was kept at the offices of (iirc) the securities & exchanges commission in WTC building 7 at the time of 911 ----- as finding that george w. bush had "ties" to enron in combination with donald rumsfeldts (iirc) televised announcement of a "black hole" in the military /pentagon accounts on september 10th, either very coincidental or somewhat suspicious.
EOG....
"Twenty Oh One" that's a funny way to say 2001
That guy who didn't invest in Enron is no longer kicking himself.
There's a book called "Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron." Maybe it'll be a good read for y'all
What really makes the whole Enron thing disgusting is that they were turning off the power to drive up the price of electricity, and people were dying because of it. There are many tainted souls belonging to Enron...
rallys and checkers
President Bush had Ken Ley killed to cover his ass. Ken was about to blab to the feds to stay out of prison so Georgie had him killed to keep any wrongdoing he did from coming out. They made it look like a heart attack. Bush got a lot of money from Enron during his campaigns for governor and president and was close friends with Mr.ley.
Should do a video on Beaufort securities fairly recent scandal
Sounds like bitcoin and all the crypto currency crap
When your company has the nick name Crooked E perfect......there was one guy who got away and took $350million with him he is now the second largest private land owner in the state of Colorado...he left 1 year before shit hit the electric fan
Ken Lay faked his death to get out of the punishment. He bought off whoever he needed to. Absolute scum, deserving of a painful death.
The book "The smartest guys in the room: The amazing rise and scandalous fall of Enron" will give you the full scope of the fraud better than the movie or any other book. You may have to re-read the middle section involving the machinations of Enron's CFO. Very byzantine financial transactions.
Wonderfully? done..I'm going to binge watch your other videos and I subscribed... great job..
I had a session based on Enron & Arthur Enderson fraud, when I joined KPMG, and they told me about the Independence and Risk trainings, etc which is quite important for these audit firms now.
That movie you mentioned, Enron the smartest guys in the room, is beyond jaw dropping. What these guys did is almost completely inconceivable!
"You don't want another Enron? Here's your law: If a company, can't explain, in one sentence, what it does... it's illegal." - Lewis Black
Can't believe my broker (at the time) talked me into Enron and WorldCom, I was in my 20's and was hoping to make lots of money off those stocks smh
When Enron started to fall apart I had a long talk with my boss about the business aspects. Was it an innovative company that hadn't worked out? Was it a scam? And what was the difference?
I still refuse to buy into my enormous company's stock plan because of the Enron scandal. I just stick with the S&P500 index fund. If I go down, we all go down!
"In 2000, Enron signed a 20 year contract with Blockbuster." HAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH Yeah, "profits".
Do you have a video on circuit city? If not. Make one.
I must say thank you for posting this. It gives me an idea of my reaction paper in 10 minutes i have my 2 pads of reaction. Thank you.
Going through all of your videos. You do a great job! Keep it up!
Evil corp
I lost everything I had
do a video on Worldcom :D
I get perverse pleasure as a bit of an anti-capitalist watching videos of these failing enterprises.
10:25 shit like this is why nobody really cares about a company's vision or mission statement, its all just bologna to look wholesome
Valient was worse
my dad hates Enron. he's an accountant so he was mad because they caused a bunch of rule changes and stricter regulations that would effect his work and any other accountant's work
Make a video about the auto company bailouts
In twenty oh one
It's En-Enron.
Thankyou so much. This would help me a lot for my presentation!
Wait, I still don't get how people found out? What caused these shady tactics to be discovered.
Never heard of Enron
Video rated E for Enron
Energy speculation........how is that even a business?
Thanks for the info
From what I've read, George w Bush would have been in huge trouble over this if not for 9/11.
I think something went enwrong :(
the end .. lol
South sea company but in the 20th century
its crazy to think 2006 was 15+ years ago... Feels like it was 2010 was just yesterday. geez time flies.
The strict rules from the accounting errors from ENRON worked out really well for the maddoff caper :)
amazing video & channel
I had a cousin who worked at Andersen. The day they went belly up they were actually selling the furniture at their NYC offices. Ironically, because she was a singer and not someone looking to move up in the company she had a better chance to recover than others. Also there's nothing worse than to lose your name off an NYC office building.
Greek term for digestive system or intestine Eneteron, and exit of biggest scandal in america history was Shit.
The smartest guys in The room is one of my favourite documentary of all time.
Other companies were in on it and got away.
You sound like a fucking weasel
What a Bitcoin
Tesla did that same shit to hide their debts.... Tesla said they paid off their loan when they haven't even made that much money yet... do some digging and you will find that the loan wasn't paid off BUT transferred to another company....
Was Enron really bigger then Apple or Microsoft? That is what the video says right?
Didn't Kenneth Lay allegedly fake his death?
its a fascinating documentary. Well worth the watch.
I love your youtube channel, its so entertaining!
Q: When Enron closed, what was it's most valuable in-office asset? A: It's Risk Management Manual which were selling on eBay for $1,000 each.
It took down Arthur Andersen.
Twenty oh six
So basically, they pulled a lot of the tricks that other companies pull sometimes, but just went crazy with it.
They helped get rid of Governor Grey Davis, thank you Enron.
Cool logo though! Who designed it?
Ken Lay. Hope he is roasting in hell!
Thanks for this condensed version about the Enron fiasco.
If you really want an in-depth look at this company's shinanigans, give the book "Conspiracy of Fools" a read. By Curt Eichenwald. (I don't know how you spell his name and I'm too lazy to look it up) It's shocking.
spooky
All the executives involved in the scandal should have faced a firing squad for their crimes!
so kinda a off topic trading but in your mock up you use there shareholders reports as evidence to invest. wouldnt that be insider info?
I worked for Arthur Andersen, consulting division which became Accenture before the ship sank.
Its called mark to market because you're a mark if you act on it
Background music sounds like a knockoff version of Watermelon in Easter Hay, by Frank Zappa.
Please do Nortel
very well explained
someone should hire a team to eliminate ALL the enron execs. They crushed people's futures and way of life. Others at the top need to be taught a lesson.
Something went EnWrong
it was the equivalent of bitconnect
Investing in Enron the original bitcoin?
E corp
Iam a management student, I have learned that failure of expansion and lack of making strategies caused its down fall, to what extent is that true???
You should make a video on Napster
more content please... this channel is awesome. thanks in advance
What's the difference between this company and insurance companies?
I was born and raised in Houston. Despite being 13 at the time, I remember watching all of this go down as it happened. We had family friends who worked for Enron come and stay with us because they went from making upper five to lower six-figure salaries to being essentially homeless. You're right about one thing: there were many, many victims in this scandal. This was a good video and you did a job good summarizing the intensely outrageous monstrosity that was Enron.
Holy shit it's E Corp
the smartest guys in the room is one of my favourite documentaries. Enron was totally freaky crazy shit. it is amazing how they fooled and tricked the market to take it so far before collapsing. STRONGLY recomended
I was in charge of IT for a smaller energy company during this time that went down in flames as well in the aftermath due to accounting 'irregularities'. The way that Arthur Andersen operated was that if you had an auditor who got too close to the flame, you would simply complain to AA about them and they would be pulled off of your account. Our investigation resulted in a few people losing their licenses & ability to work for publicly traded companies, but stopped short of going all the way down the rabbit hole to the utility companies who were complicit...smaller version of too big to fail...too big to indict. It's disturbing to see how some people will trade their souls for dollars (executive bonuses were tied to profits, CEO was remodeling a golf course mcmansion, CFO was doing an 'Envy' converting the ranch house in his neighborhood into a mcmansion...he finally cracked when Deloitte came to town to clean up and unburdened himself...ended up losing his new job when the charges were announced). Sadly, none of this is uncommon.
I remember living in Houston when Enron fell off the cliff. Actually knew a guy that left Texaco to work for Enron two years before the disaster. He was all giddy and excited to work for them. It was sad to watch him have to pick up the pieces afterwards....
Serious question, why did Arthur Andersen get penalised so heavily when other auditors get away with this? ?? Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC) is completely banned from auditing in India at the moment and a company they audited was fined $6bn by the SEC for their auditing practices but they still have a business. I could point to numerous other examples by the same company of course. So...what did Authur Andersen do that was so egregious? ??
How was it discovered.. Make a video pls
Do dawoo car
Something went En-Wrong
Whose history did this happen in again?
My street is named Enron st lol??
Can I blame them? Yes, greedy people deserve to lose everything. That's poetic justice. The stock market is a manifestation of that greed so anyone that invests there by choice deserves to lose everything invested. Should I also feel sorry for someone who gambles away their life savings at the craps table? Same thing.
Sounds like the South Sea Bubble (thank you Extra Credits)
I'd love to see a what happened with Home Depot and Lowe's!
Enron what happened? Criminal enterprise, run by scammers and criminals. Plain and simple The whole crew should have gone to jail.
Yeah, somthing went enwrong
All he had to say was they signed a deal with Block Buster in 2000 lol
SOMETHING WENT EN-WRONG
I actually watched that Enron movie because of you :) It was disgustingly scary.
I remember this going down, so many people were left completely ruined by this event, it was awful.
I was so frustrated by all the California blackouts I hated the whole idea of privatizing utilities.  My anger was the only thing that saved my tiny little 401k.
when i got my series 6 license we had to go over the prospectous this list the company goals and other bussiness they owns and stocks they own. eron named some of the bussiness after starwars characters ( since starwars is copyrighted the S.E.C. should of known somthing was wrong)
Gold Horseshoe loves Enron.
You should do a video on Stratton Oakmont
I'm not a financial analyst, but when I saw the size of that revenue jump between 1999 and 2000, all sorts of red flags went up going "That just can't be right. It just can't be."
You're obviously not a financial advisor (I am, fee-only, fiduciary-only). I would NEVER advise someone put a lot of money into a single company, no matter how good the company looks. Today we try not to let anyone hold more than 3-5%, at the high end, in any one company, such as Apple or Google or Amazon, even if the client is in love with the company. Better yet, we generally recommend broad index funds of various asset classes (different types of equities and debt/bonds), to get total diversification at very low cost. People who put their entire 401k in Enron were completely foolish. Good financial advisors don't condone gambling.
I just found out that Enron was based on Houston, I never knew that cause I'm from Houston!
“Let’s see how you did.” click
I remember when Enron was running those bizarre ads on TV. Even as a kid a knew the ad made zero sense.
So that's where "Evil Corp" comes from.
Bloody hell. remmember the sign (solar).Bridge
Knowing is half the battle.
A report I saw on this scandal addressed other shady practices going in within their business model itself, in which a mechanism first developed by a Harvard graduate was utilized that was on its face fallacious, but did work and generate great revenue, but only so long as the company maintained an A+ rating, and as soon as that rating moved even the smallest margin off from the top, the whole thing would crash. And there were those in the company who understood how this mechanism worked and how wreckless it was to use it given the great risk of it collapsing. They were able to use this mechanism because it was so new and hence no legal regulation had been developed to curtail its use. I wasn't aware of all the more blatant illegal practices that you described here. So you are correct, there is so much that was wrong with this company, it would be hard to tell it all in any single forum.
Entertaining and easy to understand? How about "Enron Scandal for Dummies"!
Evil corp logo
Something went Enwrong
I have literally never heard anyone say “twenty oh-one” for 2001 before
My dad knew a guy who cashed out about a week before the crash. I don't know how much he made
Favorite YouTube channel keep up the good work
Enron taught us that : Statistic never lies, but liar use statistic.
"We take your money Enron"
With your sports videos like the NBA VS. ABA and the short lived XFL! Could you do a video on the old World Hockey Association (WHA). Also, something else that is growing in Europe like crazy is Professional Darts! These would be interesting topics.
You need to do a full explanation of the accounting fraud in Washington and the federal government called baseline budgeting.
“Sell all shares of a small company called Google. It’s worthless. Invest heavily in Enron.”
cfo of enron is speaking at my school, should be interesting
Revenue "increased" by 150% from '99 to '00 and somehow that wasn't a red flag to investors or regulators.
My name nah owuwewe wowewo osas
Health South or the Collapse of Colonial Bank.
The Decline of Sears and Kmart.
Good job explaining this. I am a finance professional and I've also watched the Enron Movie, and I must say that what you have done here is a pretty decent summary/highlight of the main points. I also applaud you for constantly re-iterating that there is a lot more to the story, so people don't get fooled in to thinking that they are now experts on the matter thanks to just watching your 10-min video. New subscriber btw.
Enron and uranium one deal connection. Somewhere on the list of the guys who walked away with millions didn't just go away...
this video doesnt even talk about what happened he just keeps filibustering
Very basic and easy to understand. Good work
Something went Enwrong
Clinton's had connections to Enron. They were involved in some deal overseas and were in a separate plane when Ron Brown plane went down. Also, when someone loses money, someone else gains it. Stock market money doesn't just disappear into thin air. In flows into Simone else's hands.
1:00 Bill Wurtz can...
business as ususal in america
You might want to think about doing a segment on scandals. The top one that popped into mind is the Olympus 12.5 billion dollar scandal that spanned decades. The other "falls" would be worldcomm (Verizon), Yahoo?
This reminds me of Arrested Development
Hopefully those Arthur Anderson guys got theirs. Its my understanding that something that also brought them down is they tried to invest in India and because of corruption they lost everything and couldn't complete the project that they put so much into.
Twenty Oh One
Can you do a video on jcpenny
Listen to the way he says job
Omg i actually frikin love this channel
Due to new net neutrality rules this comment is unavailable. #savenetneutrality
What the accountants did was break the conservatism characteristic, which states expense recorded when probable and revenues only when certain or received (im an accounting student) which means Enron calculated what revenues they would make or what they did generate but not yet received (for example a phone bill, the revenue has been generated but not yet paid until the customer has paid at the end of the month) hence what they did was predic what they would make and record it as funds they have made
This is really interesting, can you do a video about Yamaichi Securities and Tobashi? :D
background music?
My uncle worked for Enron
I enjoyed this video so I went and watched that documentary he mentioned. I found it on Hulu and it was quite fascinating. The stuff about the California power crisis was mind blowing.
I'm just trying to find a Bronze video...

Ken Ley faked his death
Something went en-wrong
And the favorite book of the Enron executives was?  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, which shows you what a world completely devoid of Christian values looks like... so at least we can thank Enron for a terrible glimpse into hell.
Should have invested in Bitcoin
it all went enwrong
Could you do a list of the biggest business scandels
A poor idea to invest your retirement in the same company you're relying on for the here and now, regardless of how booming it is. An ode to central planning fans (Sanders, Clinton, et al) is how Enron would put California power plants offline when demand peaked in the heat of summer because government (knowing best, ha ha) allowed power providers to charge more whenever a shortage occurred. And finally, companies cooking the books like Enron actually pay taxes on their income lie.
I have a question: who was the whistle blower? How did the CEO and the other executives know to sell in 2001?
I have a question: who was the whistle blower? How did the CEO and the other executives know to sell in 2001?
Still not as complicated as the South Seas Company.
The day enron was raided and exposed ..m auditors shredded more then a 1.2 tons of paperwork ... consist of balance sheets debts and all that things ... people were not even looking at company employees were looking for shredder to shred papers
Thanks for sharing!
if there's a hell hopefully they burn in the darkest pit of it
get rid of the awful background music wtf. feels like im in a funeral
The Enron scandal is a socialist's or a communist's W. D. :P
All of the Partners involved in Enron's audits should have been indicted under RICO, had the book thrown at them, and had all of their worldly assets taken away except for the clothes on their backs. I'm glad Blockbuster went down. The few times I went there, the clerks were nasty! They didn't seem to realize that they weren't doing me a favor by waiting on me. I was doing them a favor by walking into their store. No problem, I just went to their competitors.
EOG Resources, i.e., Enron OIl and Gas still exists to this day.
What is a Enron
After Enron went under the Houston Astros held a job fair at their ballpark for the screwed over workers. The ballpark was named Enron Field. The one bill that the company paid so they could keep the naming rights. It was like one final kick to the balls for those poor people. The Astros wound up paying Enron back to get rid of their toxic name. The ballpark today is now known as Minute Maid Park.
Can you do a video on Adelphia ( my dad worked there )
Video Suggestion: "What is Accenture?"
Funny thing is , the ENTIRE STOCKMARKET is doing the exact same thing ! Only they hide it better. The us Stockmarket is basically running off confidence and ignorance of the investors. That's why it's called the bull market. Experts keep saying it can't last for a reason, soon people are gonna wise up and see that all their stocks are just paper and promises !
More enjoyable at 1.25 speed.
3:25 looks good for me 3:31 fuck
You don't know what happened to Enron? No one ever told them a bird in your hand is worth two in the bush.
Dear company man. You should do something on the Penn Central Railway. One of the biggest collapses in US industry. That will should be an interesting video.
Darn those mircophones! (0:08)
Enron.. entertaining and easy to understand... alright i have my guy
... and Ken Lay is dead.
This was a well explained and very informative video. Great job!????
American History...
Informeded decisions?
I will tell you what happened something went enwrong.
0:34 pretty good film.. I do remember "that long ago" and they had their theoretical ideas about expanding the Internet through data traffic on the power grid, which was definitely creative but as we've seen.. not viable..
XFL would be a good one
They were earning huge profits by remaining true fair and honest. If they hadn't done any fraud it might become the world's BIGGEST giant uptill now.
Remember when Playboy did "Women of Enron"? They weren't that bad. Im pretty sure they all got spray-tanned before the shoot. Lol
So what I'm hearing is that unprecedented growth and a lack of clarity on what a company actually does are gigantic red flags going forward.
Buy options or stop loss orders. This limits your losses.
Can you maybe do a video on the decline and fall of Pan Am?
Seems like Financial advisors forgot about the rule TGTBT.
The whole USA is corrupt.
What about a video about the housing bubble?
My landlord had a butcher shop with 6 employees. It was forced out of business by enron's outrageous electricity prices and the blackouts. One blackout cost $5000 in spoiled product.
They cost Grey Davis the 2004 election
When you were acting as a Financial Advisor... ...were you being a Fiduciary?
Thank you for this video, but did you seriously just say "Twenty-O-One"? No. Two-thousand One.
More like. En Wrong... I’ll show myself out.
The moment I heard financial advisor I was like, let me see your credentials and check your history to see if its legit and anything you say is legit
do pricewaterhousecoopers
This guy is a liiiiittle bit annoying.
So magically fast growing company with almost no debt and a nebulous purpose that no one really knows? And you are telling me no one was suspicious?
I remember the power outages in California when I was a kid in school. Our state had a budget crisis from all of the debt it accrued trying to procure emergency electrical power from neighboring states' grids. It was over a year before we found out that it was because of Enron's market manipulation, and then it was too late to get compensation, because the company evaporated.
What's the music you used during the video?
How exactly is "Some shady guys took advantage of lax laws to cook their books, boosting their gains and hiding their losses/debt, and bribed the inspectors to keep it all under the rug." hard to explain or complicated?
'Enron is a company. We do what we say. Say what we do.' Promises, promises.
Company Man. Could you do a video on Lehman Brothers? Thanks
Sounds like something went enWRONG I'm sorry.
I would not call this an interesting scandal. This really hurt millions of people.
So they were like a modern South Sea Company (though maybe not that crazy)? Interesting.
Not only American history, world history in general.
Anybody in the stock market never put over 10% of your investment into one company.
tbh I kinda wanna meet the enron guy when they get out of prison
My parents had some Enron stock. Not too much though, when it busted they lost about two weeks wages. I can remember when it busted, interesting business.
Ah, Enron. That thing I hear about that I have no idea what it is . Hahah. Was born in '92.
This video is well done. I just subbed.
Imagine if it was real though. The economy would be great. I hope
My uncle lost close to 500k he died damn near broke I hope the all go to hell the bastards
I can recall when Enron went bust, a friend of my mothers was on the front page of the Houston Chronicle due to him losing everything.
If I remember there were some that sounded the alarm because no matter how good the books looked, no one was able to find out how they were making money. There was no identifiable business plan.
I really enjoy watching your videos. Looking forward to new videos.
I felt bad for the employees who not only lost their job but their retirement also...Ken Lay got off easy
Jeff Skilling is a huge POS. At least Ken Lay had the decency to die. He'll be released in 2019. If I were him, I wouldn't feel safe for the rest of his life with all the people he wronged possibly looking to get even.
It's hard to trust big business. They know the game a whole lot more than the average joe. Investing for most of us would be akin to learning poker from a card shark. Good thing I have no money to invest.
The book is waaaaaaay more detailed. Read that instead.
This video was on my home page and I instantly subscribed to your channel
Check out Enron commercials on YouTube. So cool in that era.
The book "The Smartest Guys in the Room" is terrific. It's a must read if you want to know more about Enron.
Ken Lay's "death" was awfully suspicious. We never did get to see the body.
Hi " Company Man" - I am not a business man but this is now my favorite YT channel. I just finished watching. "ENRON - The Smartest Guys in the Room", Netflex./ Still a complex issue to understand. But maybe: I think a high school accounting student could have seen this coming. Gary ??
Hey Company Man you should do a video about Orion Films
I will never forgive that company for what they did to California.
but did they earn 100 million from the deal?
That's a really nicely made thumbnail.
Thxs !!! for this video I knew about the scandal but never knew what exactly happened
The part where Enron went into business with Blockbuster for bandwidth and Internet Streaming. If Blockbuster would've went into streaming instead of staying with brick and motors, would Enrons predictions for their mark to market helped them from going under or were they in too deep over their heads?
I REALLY like how you proposed the challenge yourself to provide a Youtube video to explain what happened with Enron. That to me takes guts and passion rarely found for other investigative journalism. I saw MBNA as #3 on that magazine list and worked there for 10 years. Anyone who worked at MBNA knows why the company was ranked so highly because of the CEO's positive & Customer-focused ethics policies. The message got diluted in middle & lower management perhaps. I'd really like to see your take on MBNA. I'd be glad to collaborate in order to bring to light such an epic corporation.
Of course many of the people responsible walk away with millions with nothing, but a slap on the wrist. This wouldn't be the biggest financial scandal though. That goes the 2008 housing crash.
Do one on Bernie Mae and Freddy Mac
Ken Lay deserves what is awaiting him post judgment day and Skilling is just the same. You cost so many people so much and did not even care enough to come clean after the fact. I find pleasure knowing that you will suffer worse and for a much longer period of time for what you knowingly did and did not do.
What is funny is that this is still being done today. Microsoft released Windows 10 for FREE so that it will boost their quarterly earnings report about the number of computers running Windows.
I wonder if that Ken Lay guy really died? You know rich people will fake their death to avoid stuff then live in a foreign country under a new identity
After watching this video I believe I found your calling in life. You should become a stockbroker ??
I like your videos bud but im not feeling the ad in the middle...
Is this the South Sea Company all over again?

good video
It's pronounced two-thousand one, not twenty-o-one!
Damn you Enron!
Enron lookin like E for everyone
Enon employees were so arrogant it was unbelievable .
I want you to know that I'm becoming a huge fan of yours. Keep up the good work :)
Insanity. The whole lot responsible should have been hanged.
It STILL pisses me off - the top execs walked away with millions, and the people who spent decades working for the company lost EVERYTHING. Their jobs, their retirement, their investments, everything. And what really burns me is that I'm sure this sort of shit is STILL going on, we just don't know about it (yet). The will be another Enron at some point.
Taking accounting in high school. Have to right a paper about an accounting scandal. Got an idea
So this all started when they tried to beat Netflix to the punch.
Did Enron contribute to the crash just a few years later
"twenty o six"???
Wow! Thanks company man, I can't believe I didn't know about this.
This is my first day checking your videos..i am instantly hooked. Well written and produced. Gonna do a little binge watching now....keep up the great work!
Dude you gained 35k subscribers since last year? And there are countless stupid YouTube accounts with over 2M subscribers? Keep up the good work!
Heart attack? That dude is sippin margaritas right now
Never trust financial advisors. Always ask if they are a fiduciary. Fiduciaries are legally bound to work in your best interest while financial advisors are free to advise you in ways that benefit themselves
You should do a video on IBM
Do adelphia cable
Hey make a video on commodore please (was a computer company)
Enron hurt the local houston economy for years. Also at the time the new Astros stadium was gonna be called "Enron Field" but later Minute Maid stepped and took that spot and we have "Minute Maid Park" which IMO so much better and I love Minute Maid Orange juice.
Realy love your videos. Can you do Sears (stand alone version ). I know you spoke about them in the K-mark video
I know Andy Fastow. He played a big part in structuring the debts off the books in vehicles he called the raptors.
Looks like evil corp from mr robotto
More scandals would be awesome actually, VW emissions could be cool, and some of the other large scale security frauds would be great
The problem with external auditors is they are paid by the auditee. BIG conflict of interest
Ken ley was assassinated by G. W. Bush because of his ties to the bush administration and ken was trying to make a deal to stay out of prison. Ken was gonna rat out George so George took him out!
So much is wrong with this video. Arthur Andersen for example was brought down by a wrongful conviction not by crisis of confidence.
Seems like the South Sea Company to me.
do you think it was an accounting scandal or an abuse of the rules that let hide stuff? off balance sheet debt was permitted - go figure. mark to market accounting is dangerous, should be balance sheet only. AA routed in so many scandals but how much could AA find if senior mgmnt colludes to conduct fraud. AA was far more culpable with Worldcom - balance sheet growth but shrinking ROI sounds like capitalizing expenses - and should had been caught.
also sorry for the gaps in posting cos when i spend any sort of time on utube i keep an old version of it which isnt capatible with adverts hence iget to watch what i want uninterupted but the downside is that yr posts are restricted in size, so like everything, its really good but far from perfect . rAyZoR. And note, the lastime i mentioned this i had a flood of emails from peeps wanting to buy it off me, soz2 dissapoint but iwill never part with it and iwill just refer you to utube red instead
. . .3rd . . stood4 was also wrong, which i think is why when you try and change a persons view you can show them a mountain of evidance but does nothing, but show them where an error in judgement may lie and its like a,get out clause,they are willing to accept that leading 2a change of view without accepting they may have been wrong.But lets face it societies do evolve this premis may,lets hope become part of history.rAyZor.
. . .2nd post, a continuation . . .This result of us finally agreeing, highlights another problem in society.u c my wife and i are both not,lets say uneducated,yet we both studied the same subject matter,Enron,and came up with different opinions and instead of trying to marr these views in2 one answer we Both just blindly defended r own view.Now we both c how draconian that was,it seemed 2us at the time that ifwe both backed down over this 1subject itwud somehow show that everything we . . .
hi this my 1st vid but WOW unailed it wivyr simplistic approach.u c my wife uni both held difering views un Any argueing we had about Any subject ended up Enron based unNot the real subject matter. iheld the view that Enron were the problem,she held the view that The System was at fault allowing the birth of the problem.NOW we both agree that the Enron problem highlighted a problem with the system,both were faulty and it took a marriage of faults 2highlight an even bigger1,so we were both rite.
do one on bernie madoff
So its cooking the books, bribery and greed boom got it lol already knew that and did not need an advance class to figure that out obviously everyone was involved to cook such a scandal there is no one single person to blame duh

Why you don't fund the majority of your retirement plan with the stock of 1 company.
Gangsters in white collars
I don't understand why those involved, who weren't the victims, we're able to keep the millions they made by selling the stocks at "just the right time". Shouldn't that money have been used to repay the duped? There are records of who sold what and for how much. There are records of who had what stocks and what they lost. Wondering if some judges weren't paid off just like the auditors.
I wish you mentioned the mysterious Lebanese financier Mr. M. Yass.
dude why didnt you tell everything :(
thank you
I hate to repeat myself but Karl Marx is right!
How's this for messed up. Ken Lay died of a heart attack and was "cremated" before anyone from the government saw his body. His nick name was Kenny boy. Given to him by his good friend George W Bush. A man who happens to own a huge ranch down in Paraguay. Put 2 and 2 together.
Do one on Wachovia!!
I'm curious as to how they were involved with Schwarzenegger. I didn't hear about that before.

Can you do Fred Durst? I find the rise and fall of him interesting.
I just found your channel by my recommendation's and I gotta say. Your videos are top noch. I'm not bluffing. Your really good at doing your research. I'm about 15 years old watching this and I love this series. I would like to recommend you do What happened to target. They haven't been in business lately and i'm wondering what's happening to them.

How about doing a video on Eastern Airlines. My father worked there for 22 years .
I herd Ken Lay is alive & living in South America.

I and my friend were unsubscribed from you, i think many others have been also.
The book Smartest Guys in the Room is what the film was based on. And it's the first place to go to understand this scandal.
You're right you cAnt say Everything that happened in this short video. If you're bored a part 2 would be good
I absolutely love the time you take to make these videos great.
By the way, I've never understood why the big four accounting firms are held in such high esteem. I'm under the impression that the big four are mostly staffed by inexperienced young adults right out of college. The firms have extremely high turnover because they work their employees half to death. I'd have much more trust in financial statements made by experienced auditors rather than a bunch of 22 year old kids.
The Decline of Myspace!
Can you do a video on Ames??
What happened with Arthur Andersen? Why did they just switched to Accenture?
You know what's funny? I never heard of Enron until today.
Yeah, I remember all of this. My dad lost pretty much his entire retirement and caused him to go into a spiral of health problems and forced retirement. My dad's company was bought out by Enron and even at the time he said that he could feel things just weren't right. They locked all of the employee's accounts so that no one could sell any stock unless they had stock options. He had half a million dollars in his retirement and was left with about $20k.
Ahhh, how the blockchain will revolutionize the world...
I vonder vere all ze pension money vent.. ah ah ah!!! Enron-tastic!
What about malls Haven't been in one for a while
Enron was a symptom of and contributor to the rot that still pervades our global economy. Companies acting in bad faith to enrich the powerful and connected to steal what little the rest of us have left. It is the end stage of capitalism given form.
great video.
They're "laser focused on per-share earnings" Sorry, bruhs. I only accept GAMMA RAY BEAM focused. That shit turned a scrawny loser into the fucking HULK.
Enron reminds me of Evil Corp from Mr Robot. I think it's the logos and stuff.

Do you have a basketball related channel?
You could definitely do a part 2 of this.
"Twenty oh one". Lol wut? No one says that
Should do some railways!
bernie madoff still puts them to shame
So basically it was a case of SCREW THE RULES, I HAVE MONEY then forgetting you don't actually have that screw the rules money. I too have experienced such realizations. The world of accounting didn't change as a result but I can't be trusted in Best Buy now.
"Nowadays, I just get my news listening to white people in elevators. You gotta be careful with that, though. I thought Enron was a brotha I went to high school wit'."
"They were making money and growing at a rate that no one had ever seen before." That's always a bad sign. Sustainable growth is never rapid. Things are always growing fastest where they are fastest on their way to ruin. The housing market soared before it collapsed. The tech market soared before it collapsed. The entire stock market soared before it collapsed. Explosive performance is always a prelude to disastrous performance.
Yo your vidoes are actually really interesting :) thanks for the entertainment!!!!!
You should have made the video longer I enjoy this story being a Texan myself. Please make a more detailed one. Touching on Cliff Baxter and his guilt and heartbreak because of the fall of Enron. He really was one of the good guys.
Enron is a great reminder of one of the cardinal rules of investing; if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.
capitalism wild
Take your cushy severence package and get out here ya filthy corporate criminals!
If you want a better understanding read the book.
The fact that anybody profited from the scam is just nuts.
Please do the decline on toys r us.
I worked in Public Accounting. The Arthur Andersen partner in charge of the Enron Audit should have all lost of his Worldly Assets and been forced to live in a cardboard box. THAT'S where the buck stops.
Is this you, BrightSunFilms?
Cant wait for the VW episode!
Enron went full retard
You should take a look at the rise and fall of Howard Johnson's brand. For a short while it was one of the biggest companies on earth and operated in several different industries. Yet not a whole lot of people even know it existed.
Keep doing these videos. They are amazing.
I would say no to investing because you didn't list any innovations to suggest why the number is increasing at that rate
I remember when we persecuted white-collar criminals and when companies grew.
Enron's blew up kaboom??
I said no to the offer because I can tell the future lol
I bet the guy who was kicking himself started to brag that he got to keep his money
Your vids are so informative keep up the great work!
Answer: Pure unadulterated GREED. The documentary that he mentions is GREAT. Although, after watching it and seeing the financial DEVASTATION caused to Enron's employees and other shareholders, all Enron upper management that knew about and PROMOTED Enron's shady "accounting" should have been put to DEATH. Those were some REAL serious assholes...
My parents were rather conservative with money in the 90s/early 2000s. My dad worked for Motorola, and even THEY pushed to invest in Enron. My parents lost a good chunk of money when Enron crashed and burned. Many, many people did; I remember how shocked everyone was
The one thing that I would say is that Sarbanes-Oxley (the changes that were discussed to accounting) has not added a lot of value to the investing public. If you look at the 2008 crisis, note that none of the companies involved (for example Lehman) were reviewed effectively to catch the problems nor was anybody prosecuted under the rules of Sarbanes-Oxley. That to me is a big hole in the changes. I would also say that the new rules did not make companies more transparent to investors. This is particularly true for the rules around Revenue Recognition - which is all about your Mark to Market Problem. This has settled out a lot since the Rules went in place, but I think it is possible to create a company that never recognizes revenue from a product - until that product is canceled. I am not saying that this is a good idea. I just wish we could be a lot clearer to the investing public on how that works and what it means.
Enron killed blockbuster.
Half this fucking video is roleplay
In American history...
Do a video on the "Lehman Brothers" bankruptcy!
Best commercials.
I wish ISIS would handle our CEO problems. Yeah that would be awesome TV!
It's funny to think that what's now Minute Maid Park in Houston was Enron Field. Because it opened up in 1999 or 2000 when Enron was huge.
GREAT VIDEOS! You deserve a lot more subscribers! :)
Notice Kenneth Lay, all buddy buddy with the Bushies...old Kenny Boy. Six months after the biggest corporate collapse in history, 9/11 conveniently redirected the public attention somewhere else. Hmmm....
Do a video on the DreamWorks scandal
This is really all the Wall Street businesses. Enron with a different name.
I'm an accountant and I got to say I understand why people where fooled. What you got to look at really is cash flow as it shows how good the company actually is good at getting money not just 'earning' it. Thats a bit dificult to do sometimes though.
I watched the documentary you mentioned months ago and it was certainly an eye-opener. The saddest part was when they were deliberately causing brown-outs in California in order to raise the price of energy -- a sick company, to be sure.
Oh, by the way, I don't work for shady companies, either.
Ouch, I knew Enron was in big trouble (during the late 90's).....but I didn't realize how MUCH trouble Enron was in. Thank god I didn't work for them (even though I was probably 12-13-ish during that time).
Great vid. Do Bernie Madoff
9:15 ENRON did not cause those power failures in California but they did exploit those incidents
But who stole the Jack Ruby?
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Since you did a video on Enron's scam, would you do one on Bernie Madoff?
Why does this video not have any ads?
crazy
"Honestly this concept is so hard to explain, a 2 hour film isn't enough to grasp the whole idea" They said they made more money than they did. Pretty easy to understand.
bronze56k made a video about enron already
Do a decline on circuit city please
Huh, so this is what Mr. Robot's Evil Corp logo is based on. Nice.
Fucking unchecked capitalism.
That was a great documentary! The governor of California (Jerry Brown) made an appearance in that documentary. I really enjoy your channel!?? "OOPS!" I meant (Gray Davis).... honest mistake, they do kinda look alike!??
Your gain is fine.
In a few years: "YouTube/Google: What Exactly Happened?"
Enron is quite dead. There is a company called EOG (Enron Oil & Gas) Resources which is what was left of Enron that does a lot of oil and gas Exploration & Production. If you do work for them, don't call them Enron.
Thanks for explaining shit to me. Im pretty dumb.
Im geeking out by this, I graduated with an Accounting Degree and am glad this was covered!
Pretty sure the Clintons had Ken Lay killed. ;)
Yes,things were going to be different but what is that over the horizon company man? Its Bernie Madof!!! Things sure were different.
Now do MCI / WorldCom. I worked there the day it was announced that Bernie Ebbers was using the place as his personal piggy bank. Stock went from like $40 to nothing almost over night. The company was giving stocks to vested employees as bonuses, and allowed employees to purchase stock as their 401k investing option There was a wife-husband duo I worked with that tossed all their money into Worldcom stock in their 401k's, and pretty much lost it all overnight. This was around 2000-2001, when the internet boom and MCI / Worldcom building out fiber made everyone think the economy would just keep taking off (when actually it was forming a massive tech bubble that popped).
Jews happen
The stupid company I worked for in the 1990s that almost went chapter 13 were audited by Arthur Anderson and had stock in Enron.
Worst part was people 401k who had their companies bought out by enron and they lost their entire retirement. No fishing its work until you die. At least one enron guy killed himself. Emphasis on "at least" or "At least..."
Blame it all on the church of scientology that was founded by Enron Hubbard. Oh wait, that was L. Ron Hubbard. No matter, they both operate on the same principles.
this reminds me of the movie "Boiler Room" with a young Vin diesl

Evil Corp.
1.25x you speak so fuckin slow, are you smoking?
I had no idea about this and their logo looks like the one from Mr.Robot
I looked into Ken Lay a while ago because they had a joke about him on Supernatural.
Yeah, Ken Lay "died" all right. Heart attack then instantly cremated and immediately issued a death certificate. Not suspicious at all...
Did Kira kill Ken Lay?
Great video - Even got me to watch the documentary you mentioned, which was fascinating.
Because of Enron, Accounting is a major field of study. Numerous companies nationwide began hiring a larger number of accountants to more closely protect against fraud. If executives can go to prison for signing off on bad accounting (knowingly or unknowingly), it creates the perfect incentive for them to ask all the hard questions and find people they can trust. Where I work, our Controller, CFO, and CEO sign off on the financial statements. They notice the slightest abnormalities in an ocean of details and thoroughly investigate/interrogate the matter. It's not fun being asked the hard questions from people whose freedom, reputation, and economic prosperity is on the line to get it right. As such, I have learned some very interesting accounting things from my superiors over the past several months.
All Enron did was change their name.
They got eaten up by the tumour known as globalism. From the inside out, they were completely destroyed by fanatics and heretics to business and trade everywhere. When it all went wrong, the big dogs decided they wouldn't put their own companies through the same thing.
"Enronic" that they said they played by the rules lol...sorry
Enron started in Omaha Ne. then moved to Texas. At the time it was a major blow to Omahas economy but in the long run, we dodged a big bullet.
Hundreds of Thousands of people lost out because of the dishonesty at the top. Why should big corporations be trusted? We, the great unwashed, don't matter to those at the top, we can go into poverty, live the rest of our lives regretting we believed the man in the suit........... That is uncontrolled capitalism, that is corporations. Deregulation allows this to happen.
Do a Flux capacitor
We know what happened, a bunch of fuckwads conned the state (AND EVERYONE IN IT)
Twenty o one
My brother was a trader at Enron in the late 90s.
Who is going to be the new Enron in the coming financial collapse now gathering momentum?
Still patiently awaiting circuit city
But if Enron was bankrupt due to this scandal, what became of the company itself? Did some other organization buy the building?
What a time the year 2000, when things that always seemed to be.. actually were not as they looked. When big ideas failed and where the whole market required a re-evaluation. Ah, good times.
The track is to exit the stock before it was too late.
Good
wasn't Ken Lay allegedly in Costa Rica or somewhere like that?
And I think I remember that McKinsie Consulting had a lot to do with this
Do BORDERS
Great channel, but you really need to work on the first minute of the video
Love the new intro keep it up please
YES
Can you be my financial adviser?
I bet it was Walpole.
shEnron
As a state auditor I can say it's easy to audit Enron. Since the auditor helped make the financial statements. Lol
I have to admit you have the best dam youtube channel even better than mine.
The Jim Carrey movie "Fun With Dick and Jane" was based on the Enron scandal, it was definitely one of his better movies
mircophone
Auther Anderson accountants took a big loss--they had to change careers or start their own firms because no one wanted to hire an accountant linked the Auther Anderson. All the employees were declared dishonest by the business community.
Do one on Daewoo pls
I was an auditor at Arthur Andersen back in 2001 right before this happened. The auditors themselves where frauded by the company, but the rules were so lax back then, that they didn't really have to do too much digging. I worked in the NY office and was let go right after 9/11, along with a bunch of other people. It was really strange that people were getting laid off at the time, cause we didn't think 9/11 had that big an effect on the audit firm itself. Two weeks later, the Enron news came out, and I guess they knew it was coming. I made out on the deal cause I got 2 months severance and a new job in like a week. After Enron hit, people got at best two weeks severance. Andersen didn't actually go under all at once, and was telling some of the employees I kept in touch with in December 2001 that things were going to be fine, that it wouldn't have an effect on them. I was trying to let them know that it was a sinking ship but people still held on tight. Regardless, all the rules in the world won't matter because companies will always be able to commit fraud if they want in the current system. The penalties are way too minimal for the upside of being insanely rich.
The Federal Reserve which is not Federal but a Private Bank backed by shadowy figures, prints money and sets interest rates, all because we trust them and their mystique. Investment banks closely tied to the fed use fractional reserve banking which means they can lend money they don't have. It is in every way a House of Cards like Enron but is perpetuated by people who are too big to fail, too persecuted to ever be held accountable again. Until the end of days.
The book A Conspiracy of Fools is crazy detailed about Enron's goings-on.
Anyone who know anything about businesses wouldn't have touched those stocks. Too good to be true means not true.
Could you do whatever happened to baby Jane?
"Shocking", I guess they didn't have the Skill.....ing to pay the bills......... ? that joke...... was a waste of "Energy".............? did someone fart? I can smell "Gas". What has Enrons stock and the Titanic got in common?............. they both sank.
Fun with Dick and Jane... Thats what happened lol
"Twenty O One"
Looks like I'm going to lose an hour or two watching stuff, now I've discovered this channel.
People who say 2001-2009 as "Twenty o _____" cant be trusted.
The Enron scandal was a "one of a kind" scandal, mainly because it would be almost impossible to do the same today. First of all, no company would want to be "the second Arthur Anderson." Second of all, there are a lot stricter laws nowadays that were applied the day the scandal happened.
The E reminds me of Evil Corp from Mr Robot.
The logo looks like evil Corp from Mr Robot
Southwest, Goldsman Sachs, and Enron... Freaky...
Tesla
Ahh the good old times when financial fraudsters were imprisoned, unlike now...
I definitely should look more into this. I know you usually stick to more large-scale businesses, but I wonder if you'd ever take a look at what happened with 38 Studios? I have friends who were affected by that directly from working there, and I think it'd make for an interesting topic for one of these videos.
Arthur andersen amazingily still exists under anather name. I think the consulting side of the business is under anotehr name
I guess the internal auditors that okayrded this accounting is still working
I know this story all too well. Being a native Houstonian, this was the biggest news story in town. I was in kindergarten at the time.
Haha getting involved with Blockbuster.
Subbed for that quality. I don't know but the quality of your videos seemed to increase.
Haven't heard anyone say "twenty oh one" before lol
I've read many places that the Enron files were lost in building 7 on 9/11. Alot of important files were lost for many investigations.
What an interesting channel. Subscribed.
What wENt RON
Yet despite the constant lessons the majority of Americans can think of nothing better in life than licking the ballsack of the rich.
ur annoying
good thing i invest glododyne
Could you please explain the Bernie madoff scandal? Which was similar to the Enron scandal right?
I've never heard anyone refer to 2001 as twenty-o-one Two thousand one would be the standard way of pronouncing it, right?
I own the movie & it's intriguing. I subscribed also...

I love your content keep up the good work!!
you should make a video about the Pen Central Railroad disaster and how it almost took down the entire North East railroad network in about 6 years.
Nothing has been done to prevent more Enrons from happening. IMHO there are many more out there waiting to happen, especially now.
The "Smartest Guy in the Room" missed the point and failed in telling the whole truth. I worked there BEFORE Ken Lay. He flipped management in 1985 and overthrew better management and it took him fifteen years to destroy a once great company. He began massive fraud in 1986 and sold off assets to coverup failures. They Lay hired Skilling who was an expert in fraud to help him. The sin of Ken Lay was pride. He could not admit his failures.
Crazy to see all this again my aunt was the auditor who stepped foreward. Ended up doing my senior project on Enron and this scandal. Nice video brings back allot of memories.
if you want to clear cut version, enron was a smoke screen company that was being used to fund a CIA operation that the bush cronies was coordinating, it was generating fake revenue to bring in investors, then took that money to fund the whole operation to steal money from global markets, they proved that in court
Do the decline of The great Atlantic and pacific tea company
...they paid off accountants with money they didn't have?
Thanks for covering this one! I love Smartest Guys in the Room, glad you mentioned it. Basically Enron was a house of cards, a masterful bluff. But they kept buying themselves time in the short term at the detriment of their long term health, similar to a Ponzi scheme.
@ 8:24 two thousand and six
@ 4:06 Two thousand and one. =)
Do Myspace!
Never heard of it! Is it because I'm Australian? probably...
Boop boop boop boop boop booop boop boop boop boop boop booop
The thing about Enron is that they used a technique that EVERY company was doing.....they just abused it way more than they should. A company that knew they were going to gain revenue would place that on the books as leverage for their liabilities, and when it came in, it would be a wash......what Enron did was create revenue based on the wrong data. For example, an electric company would be known to make upwards of 2 million on average across America, so when Enron built an electric plant in China, they put 2 million as the revenue on the sheets.....not understanding that the outskirts of China wouldn't be able to afford the electricity at even a penny cost, which lead to a flop return. With constant flops on market decisions while the books just kept getting more and more cooked, eventually it all slipped. If Enron hadn't done what they did, companies would still be doing it today. Between Enron and the real-estate crash, it ruined stock market trading for a lot of us commoners...increased capital requirements and other restrictions kills the very notion of a free market.
Arthur Andersen was also the auditing company involved in the MCI-Worldcom scandal. That was the other main reason they ceased to operate.
Jim chanos first called enron as a scam
Right when I was thinking when this channel was going to upload another video, you appear ^_^
Look at Enrons chart... Classical Pump and Dump chart... It's crazy to think that if Blockbuster would have tried harder they could have been Twitch, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Redbox...but alas they are no more...
Do THQ
2:23 I can't see the debt and equity figures. Hmm...
I'd also recommend reading this: https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Fools-Story-Kurt-Eichenwald-ebook/dp/B000FCK1SO It was written a bit later than "Smartest Guys" and has a lot of updated information.
Nice video, I've never even heard of Enron. I think you should consider doing Yahoo's decline. I have used Yahoo since 2005 and I have seen the decline, it's decision not to buy google, I think, and it's eventual sale to verizon. Another Idea is to go over restaurant's like dennys, apple bees, sizzler, and others who have seen decline. I'm curious to see what video you make next. Keep up the hard work.
When I was studying microeconomics and financial accounting, this was a really hot topic. 0:25 I admit, the teachers were using it to explain simple accounting principles that they violated to cook the books.
What happened with Lehman Brothers?
If you're doing scandals and fraudulent corporations, you should consider doing a breakdown of the '08 Financial Crisis. I know it's more well known after "The Big Short" came out but it should be more widely spread.
The robber barons responsible should all have gotten the death penalty and lost their assets altogether. That wealth should then be redistributed to the 99%. Enron is proof that unfettered capitalism is bullshit. Democratic socialism is the future. Bernie Sanders in 2020
good videos bro
Only Americans can be this full of shit.
Never invest in a company that doesn't have a quality product, and or service. If you're buying crypto coins, Enron is a good example of what to avoid. Emotions be damned. You want money? Then follow the data, results. Years before Enron collapsed they had a reputation for being shady. They can't hide who they are.
Do Tesla, and how it collapsed after Elon left earth for Mars to escape killer AI.
SEARS SEARS SEARS
Love your vidz! It's like watching a mini documentary movie!
I have never heard exactly what Enron was supposed to be selling. Their business model was never clear; you were just expected to look at the numbers. But there was a lot of that in the 90's.
You should do the 2008 Financial Crisis.
My next door neighbor was tim belden
You are amazing at explaining things. Very interesting video! You just earned a new subscriber. :)
awesome short cut on a big subject...now I just wonder what role they had in Arnold getting elected. Oh well I will watch the movie when I have more time now.
Can you do circuit city
Duuude I remember I found you when you had just 700 subs
I really loved fun with Dick and Jane where the other guy mentions his great new job Enron.
Sprint wireless?
You really need more subs
Your voice makes me watch these videos over and over again. It's captivating.
Another great video, thanks for posting...
Please do a part two.
The big auto company bailouts would've interesting since we're coming up on 10 years post-recession.
Enron is actually a pretty cool name, like a science fiction character or something.
Enron is actually a pretty cool name, like a science fiction character or something.
I can't recall his name but I remember at the time reading in the WSJ about one of the key executives who blew his brains out in his Mercedes shortly after the scandal broke because he knew there was no way he'd escape going to prison.
I've never heard of Enron then again I was born in 2001. This just seems bizarre
you will get a lot of subscribers lmao
i dont understand how annyone whit half a brain can look at the way they conduct themselves and think it's not even a little suspect the best example is the way they cut of electricity to jack up the prices tell me that's not a sure way to see a company is not on a long therm path of succes (and that was something known)
Omfg! Thank you for listening! I remember asking you for this and HERE IT IS!!!
if its to good to be true...
take the money and run (that's what happed)
Do the rising of nike
enron has one of the best commercials I've ever seen. I never was aware of enron until after they died so I found out about them on an old commercial collection. I realized I never heard of them, so I looked them up on wiki and found out about the fraud. You of course had way more about enron then wiki did and I always love learning more about enron! Maybe one day I'll get to watching the movie when I have more time on my hands.
The documentary is good but the book The Smartest Guys in the Room is the definitive account of what happened. It can be dry when talking about the chicanery that went on in the accounting but it is best when it details how the rest of the utility industry thought about Enron. There is one point after Enron Oil and Gas (based in Omaha) broke away from Enron proper, an executive from Enron sent a bouquet of flowers to the CEO of EOG. The CEO sent back a biting comment, "I know we did the right thing but you have to remember I'm from the Midwest and I think this means we're engaged." My dad was a CEO of a utility but not of EOG and he would have sent back something equivalent being a man who worked himself up from being a meter reader in the 70s. The utility industry is fascinating and my research into it has shown me why the Internet should be considered as an utility.

"if it's to good to be true, I stay away." What goes up must come down!
This channel is amazingly fascinating. I wouldn't really care about the history of companies but every time I see your videos in my sub feed I click instantly.
I wonder if he faked his death
Oh man I have always been confused by this ordeal, thanks for some insight!!
Do why GameStop is dying
What happened? Scumbag Ken Lay. Took total advantage of all of his employeees and customers and screwed over thousands of employers
Thank you! I remember this being in the news, but I never really cared enough to know what actually happened. Suggestion: Bernie Madoff.
Circuit City
you're one of the only youtubers that deserve to make 10 minute videos in order to get extra ad revenue.
State farm knows that for every one of these moments, there's one of those.
actually there is a simpler version explained watch "FUN with DICK & JANE" (jim carry movie)
Remember that one time when we prosecuted corporate criminals?
Can the company man do a video on the company man
Here in my hometown of Houston TX they even built a baseball field and named it Enron Field, God knows how they even got money to built that. After the scandal it got renamed as the Minute Maid Field.
Once again, another well put together and informative video! You never cease to amaze! Keep up the good work!
"Enron is a company."
Sorry, they WEREN'T victims....they played the game and Lost. The stock market is a RISK, period. Doesn't matter how big the company is, there is no guarantees. Yes the company was a fraud, but WELCOME to America!!! Even if the company Wasn't a Fraud, you could STILL lose money over time with them!!! It's an Investment, but Not a guarantee... Look at Any companies Filings and Disclosures....oh wait, you Can't! Because only the Top 1% Wealthy insiders have information to that with blue chip stocks!!! RED FLAG!!!
I was in Houston when Enron went under and myself and several of my friends ran down to Smith street to watch the employees being walked out.
Good job on the video. Could have used more Fastow though.
You should do a video on Death Row Records
I actually did photography work for Arthur Anderson a few years ago. It was a big reunion party! Lots of big wigs with deep pockets. It felt like they were celebrating the company's failure.
The opening line of The Smartest Guys in the Room is my favourite. “It had taken Enron 16 years to go from $10 billion in assets to $65 billion in assets. It took them 24 days to go bankrupt.”
I don't think I'll watch the DVD movie about it. My blood pressure would probably break record highs.
You need to make a video on Theranos when it goes bankrupt.
Please do PanAm
Love this channel !
The book "the smartest guys in the room" which the movie was based on goes into much greater detail. I think the audiobook version is 14 hours long.
I mean maybe it seemed like a smart choice to invest at the time but to me this smelled fishy just from how great it sounded. I would much rather buy a cheap stock that looks promising instead of $80 for something that seemed incredible. It seems foolish. But the risk is much lower like what happened here. Sometimes playing between safe and risky is the best.
You forgot to mention Ken Lay died while vacationing in a ski resort in Aspen: he never set foot in jail and effectively escaped justice.
If something appears to going unbelievably well, it probably is unbelievable.
I'm sorry, i love your channel but most of the major details you went into were wrong/not accurate. Do more research next time!
This YouTube channel is going places.
We get it. It's "complicated". Normal people, unlike yourself, can't understand it. Blah blah. Who would want to be an expert in enron? If you can't explain such a thing easily, you failed.
Do a video presentation on Worldcom. It was an even bigger scandal that took place the very next year.
this situation sounds similar to the 2009 General Motors bailout. nice vid. could come in handy!
Do the AOL Time Warner merger!
Jeff Skilling got violently booty slammed in prison so often and so hard he had to have his intestines repaired. Hope he made them use protection.
Enron also changed the MBA course curriculum. Every class had sessions in ethics.
Wait till Mueller gets done with Trump. You think Enron is evil? We're talking Russian mob here.
Enron was fucking terrible but they were not as big as a piece of shit as AIG.
I really like these videos. They are very informative and entertaining! Thank you Company Man
Evil Corp.
Pretty good vid. You could eliminate that last sentence with the third reference to "American history" it's awkward. That movie is good indeed. The bottom line seems pretty simple, just some crooked people who used scam accounting techniques to imagine profit and cover up debt in shell corporations. Their power came from their amazing abilities to hype their flavors of snake oil, you have to give them credit as the slickest of con men.
It's 2017 and I don't remember them.
heh, last video currently uploaded. i don't know if i'm glad that you don't have any more videos for me to comment on because i'm sure you're tired of receiving my streams of consciousness on your content or that i'm sad that you don't have any more amazing well researched videos. oh well. i've heard of enron before and the controversy surrounding them but i didn't know it was THIS deep and convoluted! guess it proves that if it seems too good to be true than it probably is, but how can you live by that if you are an investor looking for the most successful companies to invest in? things either seem too bad to be true or too good to be true and i don't know what would the in-betweens look like. well, until next time! oh yeah also good job selecting the most important information. peace!
I love this channel, keep up the good work!
hahaha! Enron still exists; it is now called EOG Resources!!! Just like Arthur Andersen is now called Accenture. Don't believe me? Google "EOG Resources" and "Arthur Andersen."
Ken lays heart attack was suicide pill I bet
Before you explained how Enron's numbers were fudged I totally thought it was a Ponzi scheme
Bastards
Can you pls do the decline of my space or kodak
talk about mad catz
...twenty oh-one? i have never heard anyone say 2001 like that
WorldCom? Tyco?
Well,it only goes to show that some companies are really too good to be true.
Awesome work, as always. I'm renting the movie tonight!
I love this channel so much. It's interesting as hell and entertaining low key. Also, it helps out with my economics class. Keep the videos coming.
The government should have learned their lesson from the Penn Central catastrophe. They did the same things as Enron pretty much.
Please say "two thousand and one" not "twenty O one" please??love the channel bro????
I don't even care about most of these companies, I just love the way you talk about the subject.
any1 elses ears hurt from his intro music?
Ironically skillings brother is a well respected media celebrity on wgn in Chicago
Enron and other scandals around the time led to the birth of Sarbanes Oxley and the creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). GAAP rules are definitely more strict, but now auditors are obligated to test for weaknesses in internal controls and provide an opinion in the annual reports in a paragraph supplemental to the opinion of whether the financial statements are reported fairly in accordance with GAAP.
Could you please talk about what happened to Pontiac?
That ending was perfect lmao
As an accountant , I love this video. I have studied Enron many years and you did a great job of explaining in 10 minutes
IT'S TWO THOUSAND ONE NOT TWENTY O ONE
What Happened - The bankruptcy and Decline of A&P (Atlantic Pacific Tea Company), one of America's largest grocery stores until 2015/
Nice, now do Lehmann Brothers next
You've GOT to watch that movie if you are at all interested in this scandal. It's a great movie! This short video is a very brief gloss-over of the scandal -- the movie goes into a lot more detail, simply because it has more time available to go into the details.
Damn man nice video when i was last here you were at 37k nice growth hope it isn't faked just kidding have a good day man
This is awesome, my accounting professor was literally discussing Enron in class today.
Mark to Market accounting. I'm sure it started small, but once Enron saw the stock rise, all bets were off.
Southwest Airlines #2 company to work for...
They even swindled most of their own employees by conning them into buying Enron stock with their retirement accounts. And I never quite believed that malarkey about Ken Lay supposedly dying on the day he was to be sentenced. The higher-ups at Enron were nothing but a bunch of ruthless thieves.
What's Enron?
I bet that guy that didn't invest went from kicking himself, to buying a nice lobster dinner when the stock crashed.
Playboy ran a "Women of Enron" pictorial. I thought the pilot chick was hot.
Have you considered taking a look at professional sports? Not on a team level but like the NFL, NBA, etc. and taking the financial angle and what the owners and commissioners did to make the leagues where they are today?
Wrong, that's not the primary purpose of an auditor. Source: BIG4 Potato
"Oh, what a wicked web we weave, when first we practice to deceive." And the didn't just practice, they carried it off, much to most people's detriment.
Willl you ever do a video about the boac bea merger ? Maybe too obscure ?
why more regulations went into place to protect investors and workers. it leaves a broke up trail and by the time it's revealed it's damage control from there out. remember boy's & girl's crap till this day flows downhill if you don't see it, there's a reason for that! you weren't looking for it.
Do pan am please!
Awesome video. Really informative. Good job !
Do a video on Hot 'N Now!
Actually it takes 30 seconds or so to explain they were booking profits that didn't exist.
(((They))) got all your money
You should do a video on the 2008 stock-market crash and the people responsible.
Another good one, Company Man! Enron was a case of some uber serious scumbaggery. Amidst their various egregious acts, the fact that they put the thumbscrews to their own employees is the very worst in my humble opinion. Amazing that they did this. I bet there are some folks rotting away in prison today that seriously regret what they did.
hint: if you ask "what does this company do?" and that can't be easily explained, RUN.
There's a book with the same name (The Smartest Guys in the Room) that goes into greater detail. The following are some of the highlights: 1. the exit of Rich Kinder (and the foundation of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners). 2. Transitioning the company from oil and gas delivery to a financial instruments company. 3. Close call(s) on financial solvency of the company in the 1980s. 4. Ambitious development projects overseas that eventually turned into huge losses.
Good. Saw the movie. I could skip this.... muh I'm bored go on
Back in the day there was an old proto-meme with the "Dell Dude" that said "Dude, you're going to HELL" (with the E being the Enron logo). Tried to find it again but alas it must be lost somewhere in the outerspace of interbutts.
Also, my wife's on Thalidamide and we just love New Coke.
I think the most fucked up thing was the employee retirement funds being tied to enron stock. Because at the end the executives stopped stock trading to pull their own money out of the market when shit hit the fan. Once they opened trading again it was worth only pennies. Those executives basically stole all the employees money!
I remember in high school having the stock market Davy kids tell me how good Enron was and I thought they were too over hyped for it not too be a fraud, I was right. And the movie is definitely worth a watch.
The sheep got fleeced, so what else is new
no matter how you do it, you can't make losses "disappear". somewhere in the accounting process the truth will present itself. hiding "bad numbers" is a temporary solution. ....
sounds like Micheal kelso
Wow, I finally get that joke in the Simpsons! ...... but it was past season 10, so that's not as cool, but oh well, still thanks :)
I have a suggestion for a video: the disaster that was Target Canada. There was so much hype but they did literally everything wrong
Yay! I new Video! Love the Series!
That halfway ad cost you a sub. Maybe you should make a video on greedy youtubers?
I was little when this happened, but I remember it well haha
So..."Toilet and Douche" is now just "Deloitte?" WTF did they do to Touche?
It sure was go-enron
Cease to exist hahahahaha EOG you dummy's they are still around Eron oil & gas
Man i love this channel. Really goes to show there is no such thing as boring topics just boring presentation. Its always exciting finding niche but extremely high quality content. Keep up the presentation.
If only someone could make a video on the topic of Enron
I guess they had to..... (Insert pun that I don't want to think of)
Sees a company man video,likes then watches the video
I'm still also waiting for y2k big to take effect
fsociety happened
Your videos are so interesting, I e-mail every new video of yours to my father who enjoys corporate history and we discuss it when I meet him over lunch every Sunday.
This is the kind of video people want to see, very old companies or new companies and their difficulties or failure not a fidget spinner video.
When did this happen?
Great video. Keep it up.
Always a great video, the quick rise and fall of Steve & Barry's would be another great one.
I wouldn't have invested, this shit was too good to be true. like bitcoin, that shit was true but nobody did that, so no impact.
"twenty o'one"
Sounds a lot like Penn Central, the railroad that joined the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central, except PC simply made the numbers up to look good.
Next stop, PEPCO.
Based on the info at the time Some red flags should have gone up! If something seems too good to be true, IT PROBABLY IS!
You do a great job so keep up the good work! Also, I think you should do an episode on Time Inc, the publishing company.
I believe there was an American greed episode also
This just popped up on my homepage and I exclaimed "YESSSSS!" I've always wondered what happened to Enron, but have been too lazy to simply research it. Thanks!
Enron = Evil Corp younger brother. Logo is still same ;)
Do one one Hudson Soft
I wish I could have shorted Enron...
Damn, this is terrible yet so fascinating.
Don panam airlinesOr twa
Feel free to follow this video up with a detailed, 5 hour long advanced student college course version.
This is by far you best and most interesting video. I'm a business student and I have to say that your content shows the fascinating side of what most people consider mundane business. Keep up the good work. I guarantee you that if you keep putting out content like this you will see your channel get to the size of Wendover Productions or Real Life Lore. Keep up the good work!
I was pretty young when all the Enron stuff happened. I ember it being a big news story but had no idea what was going on. Nice video. Might look into it more to get the full story.
Ken Lay clearly faked his death.
You make a seemingly boring topic very interesting
Crooks...fucking crooks...All! And worst of all, they never produced anything!
Great videos man
YAS
Mike, this channel is probably one of the most informative I've seen in a while. I can't imagine the amount of research you put in every video. Great work. Also, I was wondering if you'll do a video on CBS's 'Rural Purge' of the late 60's. It's a pretty interesting topic imo, mostly because it was the first time a TV network tried to appeal to a younger middle-class audience.
I watched the movie. It says they jacked up prices for their Cali customers during peak hours. I never knew they cooked the books as well! Scandalous for sure! Thanks for the vid!
I don't even know this company but I liked all this guys other videos so I might as well watch
Good choice of topic. I'm a big fan of "The Smartest Guys In the Room" and am glad to see you tackle the subject in a concise manner for those who aren't familiar with it.
i was so young when all of this went down and had no idea how far this rabbit hole actually went. Thank you so much for this...as it has sparked an interest to research more on the topic. great video!
I felt sorry for the thousands of people who lost their jobs because of this. A good friend worked for Arthur Anderson, software not accounting. One day a good job, great pay and benefits. Then, nothing. Even as Enron was flaming out, AA was telling it's people that they had "only lost an account", nothing to worry about. My sister was recruited by AA coming out of college. She seriously considered it, but decided she didn't want to move. In hindsight, she dodged a bullet.
My BULE class covered this
Enron: Ask Why, Asshole
I'd like to see a video on Penn Central!
I did a proyect about this case for muy fraud accounting class. I read over 150 pages minimum and that was a short overview about this case.
What was the dividend? Was there any? It's easy to show earnings if you don't pay dividends.
You do an excellent job of explaining how interlocking or overlapping issues can exacerbate a problem. Have you considered doing a video on the savings and loan collapse?
As disgusting what they did was. I can't help but be impressed how well and for how long they were able to keep up the facade.
If your subscriber count and average views per video continue growing, will you consider increasing the average length of each video? They're very interesting to watch!
George bush homeboys! Lol!
The head hancho was a sleeze ball
I think you should do a series on this and similarly complex subjects
Your videos are great all trying to find new people to watch!
This sounds like that one 4chan post where the guy's like "If a stock goes down to $0.01 per stock, why don't we just buy a shitton. It can't go any lower, and if it goes up to $0.02 per share, you doubled your earnings. What's the catch?" and someone replies "It might not ever go up, and just because you want to sell, doesn't mean anyone is going to buy it." And he responds with "Wait, people need to want to buy it? I thought you just hit sell and you were good to go?" Just a bunch of idiots pretending to be growing. Then again, who's the more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows him?
i watched a little of the documentary in economics class, made me very fasinated in the story of enron i might watch it in its entirety now. also id love to see a video about the rise and fall of cable tv. cable tv has been losing the niche channel focus lately and pay per view programs like wwe have just moved to streaming rather than TV to even cartoon network focusing more on their apps than their channel. the mtv effect is starting to affect other networks more and more.
How do you have your mic set up? I find having the mic gain low and being close to it works best.
Ken lay was killed because he knew more. Like the scum George Bush and dick the cock Cheney knew about this in advance. Fuck them.
What the fuck is Enron?
Been waiting for another video from this channel. Happy days
>still pronouncing it "twenty-oh-six" How many rage-filled comments must it take for this error to be corrected?! yes I mad
Jeff Skilling is the brother of Tom Skilling, meteorologist in Chicago (WGN-TV), was wondering where I've seen that face before...
Dat EVIL CORP logo. I see where they got their influence!
Does anyone remember the Enron guy who killed himself? That was so horrible and sad.
There are also a couple of books that I've read that tell the whole story from different viewpoints. I am a CPA. So, I clearly understand the illegal accounting that went on. The average laymen would never understand. In summary, they got away with their illegal accounting because Arthur Anderson signed off on their financial statements. The illegal accounting indicated they had plenty of cash, plenty of revenue, and very little debt but none of that was true.
I majored in accounting during college, and the subject of the Enron, WorldCom, and HealthSouth scandals--all of which occurred at around the same time--was brought up frequently. The U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley act shortly after the first two scandals. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now regulates the audit of publicly-traded companies through the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).
I was living in Houston at the time. It was very tragic and all anyone could talk about. It seemed everyone either was directly affected by the collapse or knew someone who was. There were also a lot of small energy trading companies that dealt primarily with Enron that went out of business as well due to losing their primary customer.
You should make a mini series about this scandal and corruptions that would be cool
I really want to see a video on Apple's history and possible future. I think that would be a cool concept.
1:37 My inner Southwest Airlines fanboy is engaged
Another amazing video! I heard a little bit about Enron in an accounting class I took but never knew exactly what happened before now. I can't wait to see what you post next!
You should do something about Eike Batista
do one on myspace
It'll definitely be interesting to see videos on companies that have dealt with fraud. It also makes me want to see videos pertaining the the late 2000's meltdown and the subsequent bail outs (GMC etc.) seeing as that period was also proliferated with scandals.
I always thought Enron was an electronics company, I remember when I was younger but I'm definitely checking out that documentary...
Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme... That's another one you should do a video on.
The hypothetical you provided at the beginning, I wouldn't invest because it looked like their bubble would burst. The growth was just too fast for it not to happen, much like what happened shortly before entire industries crashed.
And the moral of the story for investors is don't put all your eggs into one basket. That basket might just catch fire.
E corp
My wee-wee is 9000 inches long.
I couldn't help but laugh at the deal they signed with blockbuster even though at the time it seemed like a sure fine thing. Both companies are now, for the most part, non-existent.
Its 2006 not "20 06"!!!
Do Circuit City
The Bre-X Sttory is very similar and equally as fascinating.
Hope he gets rape in jail
a part 2 maybe??????? I simply wish not to watch the movie good sir
"it's been a while since the company man has uploaded." 20 minutes later..
Great video!!!!!! I noticed you didn't upload on your other channels. ????????????????????????????????????
Do worldcomm please
Aint no black or brown faces in this video, dat dude at 10:01 was the janitor
Mr. Skilling is my god
Approved
Always love the quality of content of this channel! Keep it up!
It's worth noting that because of the legal principle of "abducto ad initio" legally Ken Lay is innocent despite being convicted.
I like how you fail to mention the Clinton administration ties to Enron in the 90s up to 2001. I don't doubt the Bush involvement but not mentioning Clinton is a little partisan
I studied this topic extensively when I earned my associates degree in accounting. It's really crazy how they were able to manipulate their books. They were really good at faking their business. Basically their entire business model was to sell stock.
fuck those first comments goddamn your channel doesnt deserve this
We had an entire unit on Enron in a financial advisory class in which we watched the movie, watched the trial videos, and learned everything about the scandal It was probably my favorite unit in the class!
Love the substance and style of your work seen all your work fast and insightful.PEACE...
Nice video man and, thanks for the movie recomendation. i love business movies
I actually watched that documentary. I actually have a family friend who was one of the regular employees. He's still mad about what happened. He lost his entire 401k and a lot in stocks. The movie explains what happened really well.
Suggestion? How about you talk about how target flopped in Canada? Its an interesting story, and I'd like to hear your side of things.
im gonna call it this is the one
Enron, that's a name I haven't heard of in a long time
Consider your like button smashed.
If I rob a bank, I'll be given at least a 30 year sentence. If I rob investors of billions in dollars, I get less then 20 years.
You dun messed up En-Enron!!
Good god i love this show
I'm a simple man. I see a company man video, I click, I click like. Also I watch Smartest Guys in the Room yearly.
I like how he's uploading weekly now
I loved this video. I have a few friends who will need to watch this
Being fairly young and not being American, I hadn't really heard of Enron before, so it's fascinating. Makes me wonder whether other companies - Apple, Alphabet inc, Facebook and the like - do this sort of stuff, and to what extent. Cayman Islands are the one everyone knows, and it makes me curious whether there's more going on under the hood, so to speak.
Very well explained. Great channel.
Big fan of your channel keep up the good work :-)
I'm currently studying Accounting and Business Administration, and I can honestly say ENRON changed everything. The very rules accountants operated on for decades changed overnight, massive changes were made to audit procedures, and the consequences executives face for deliberate fraud have increased to levels never seen before.
Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room is one of the most interesting and Insightful documentaries I have ever seen. It is definitely one of my all time favorites. You did a great job with this video Company Man, keep up the great content.
Enron led to the Sarbanes Oxley Act
Yes do PanAm
Basically if you invested 1 million dollars and then it became 10k... EDIT: I might be wrong. 2ND EDIT: I just guessed.
Something went Enwrong.
I love your channel man. You really do a great job and I thank you for that.
I remember when minute maid park use to be enron field
Is it too late to buy Enron stock?! i'm going to love this episode!
Enron had some of the most corrupt motherfuckers to ever run a company. Those guys do not deserve to be called executives. They should be called (and be remembered as) fraudsters. Those excuses for guys that ran the company are an abomination to capitalism.

Seems like whenever Rome might finally find its footing, someone murders another and ruins it. Rome in a nutshell I guess
"That was a lie. I'm sorry." Lmao.
Too fast
Wow gee guys don't try to fix the empire or anything!
“Soon after which he died...of being murdered!”??????
These are so good!
You should use a different color other than light blue for your videos. It makes it hard to distinguish around the oceans/seas.
The jokes with the characters dying....quite amusing. I'm looking forward to an episode with a historical character saying 'you're drop-dead gorgeous!' and than ......well...that should be obvious. xD
The influence of the Roman Empire on Europe is very understated but a great video all the same, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
My favorite part is when I get lost by how many people there are.
So... gladiators killing one another is un-christian like. Well then, let's raise an army and start slaughterin'. Just fine.
Be gone GOTH!
The empire didn’t keep expNding, which paid for much of empire.

This is easily the best historical site on utube . More reality/facts in 10mins than others manage in an hour . No nonsense or BS ???
"He retired and by that I mean he died"
Maybe you could talk a little faster.
I just saw your Twitter. I live in Cambridge too!
7:22 Ten Minute History's new tagline
Rome was also used as a basis for many of our modern laws and legal system.Their Architecture was also influential and can still be seen to this day.I'm a carpenter who worked in the trades my whole life and I doubt any of the big projects I worked on will still be here or be admired 100 years from now let alone several thousand years from now.
Do the second sino japanese war
Clickbait 9:59 not 10:00
Press F to respect
Nepos held out in Illyria for 5 or so years though
Finally
The first video of yours I was your second video and I don't think I can get enough of your channel it's actually one of my favourite history channels out here.
Do one about the rise of Rome, and furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed.
I love this episode!!! p.s. You guys should do an episode on the Third Century Crisis.
404: date not found. Quite the reference kkk
The RCC. Enough said.
Then everything got better. I lied. He died soon after by murder. He celebrated with death
Whats up with the decreasing views last weeks/months? Something with the infamous youtube algorithm? Or something else we don't know? Shame to see this channel, who puts alot effort to teach us history, like this.
404 gladiators not found
You didn’t really give Stilicho the justice he deserves. The man was everywhere serving and emperor who couldn’t read or write properly. Stilichos daughter married him and his death I believe was the accidental suicide of the WRE.
Rome definitely wasn't the largest city by this point. It's population was plummeting
My dicks small.
Really wish you would do more episodes on Rome.I just find their history so fascinating and interesting!
Great, im crying now.
I would like to recommend the book "How Rome Fell" by Adrian Goldsworthy. Very nice read imo
Fall of Constantinople next!
Fantastic as always.
* data not found
so two in a row about world history, does that mean British is coming again soon?
the fall of rome is so surreal. Thanks for the video.
Da pacem, Domine, in diebus nostris.

ROMA INVICTA
Get ready America. If we aimlessly tear ourselves apart, making ourselves appear weak to outsiders, keep bumbling along with no long term plan, allow our infrastructure and services to continually fall into disrepair, and continue to ignore the growing wealth gap between classes then we may very well face a civil war as bad as this. I'm not sure we'll have invasions by groups of people like this, but it's conceivable.
BEGONE GOTH
LMFAO the horses ?????????? They're perfect
Some of the information here is false. Emperor Diocletian split the administration of the empire into east and west, not Theodosius. And the eastern half of the empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.
"He died… of being murdered" Rome in a nuttshell
I meet a lot of people who dislike and dont know history because throughout school they had bad teachers. And although you do a lot of name dropping for a ten minute video I firmly believe that everyone who is a "noob" in history would remmeber something from the video. It is done in a professional and entertaining manner and graphics fit perfectly with style of the story telling. Hats off to you sir
Atilla: Hun-ey I’m home!! One of Atilla’s Wives: Yes? Atilla: Do you get it? One of Atilla’s Wives: What? Atilla: Hun-ey, you know course we’re Huns? One of Atilla’s Wives: I still don’t get it. Atilla: Nevermind, I’m gonna go kill some more Romans.
404 'date not found' Bloody hell ????
Fall of west rome you mean
But after 404...*Date not found. chuckles Love it. :)
Funny that we call this the fall of “Rome”
these help me so much in school thank you!! PS today is the anniversary of North Korea so i'd love to see The Korean war
The fall of Rome makes me shed a tear every time. :’(
Date not found. Love it :)

He is risen!
We have horse!
14bc-476ad? Shouldn't it be 27bc-476ad
Hi
You die now
You're gonna sit there, with a straight face, and tell me it took 100 years for Rome to fall. No. Took 3 months.
I said it once and I'll say it again. Horses= ??
5 minute history!?
People forget how fucking long Rome lasted. A country that big and diverse has rarely lasted as long.
I highly recommend the YouTube channel "the fall of rome". It's a small chanel but it is run by a historian.
Hilarious and informative as always. Thanks.
I feel bad for the Flavius Stilicho guy now.
When someone sais that Christianity ruined the roman empire on its own...
Fuck Valentinian
Even today nations aspire to be like Rome. I wonder if our civilization will inspire future ones as much.
Hold up this is fake news, It's only 9:59 not 10:00.
7:29 Switzerland neutral as always!!
HORSES!
Horseeeeeeees!!!
Caesar Augustus looking at a ruined Rome in 476: YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! AH, DAMN YOU! GOD DAMN YOU ALL TO TARTARUS!!!
I like how you use horses now
Let’s be honest. The western roman empire fell because of immigrants who didn’t want to integrate
Moral of the story: Outsourcing soldiers is a terrible idea
The title alone brought me to tears.
Fall of Mongol Empire? With breakup of Golden Horde and Illkhanate. Red Turban Rebellion. And rise of Timur and Moghulstan.
This video is so sad
oh i love your dry wit so so much
Where’s that mongol episode?
it was pretty much a sure thing when they abandon their religious roots one of the key things that made them Romen from their they stopped gladiator games witch inspired strength that was gone after with Christianity and made them relay on barbarian cause a barbarian and Roman both can be christian and that's what made their end inevitable. cause Romen archaic religion was the foundation of the mos maiorum, "the way of the ancestors" or simply "tradition", viewed as central to Roman identity. During the transition to the Christian Empire, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus argued that Rome's continued prosperity and stability depended on preserving the mos maiorum, and the early Christian poet Prudentius dismissed the blind adherence to tradition as "the superstition of old grandpas" (superstitio veterum avorum) and inferior to the new revealed truth of Christianity.
Another great documentary. You are truly talented
My life is enriched by the sarcasm and laconic humour in these videos.
Good thing Italians are done with the whole violent imperialism thing, huh?
You meant Constantine the Great.
Im disappointed that Attilla didnt die with a horse
"Xeno would of course have other plans" Xeno: I have other plans The best
you should do an episode on Justinian
If you are worried about the age of "The World of Late Antiquity" I highly recommend Brown's latest publication on the subject: "Through the Eye of a Needle: Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West 350–550 AD" It contains some important updates, chief among those being the notion that the barbarian invasions were a scapegoat conjured by Roman writers. The barbarian proto-kingdoms did play a part in Rome's downfall of course, but more through drawing talented romans away from Imperial courts to their own and thus becoming a valid alternative to the Respublica.
+1 for the hopping horses. Can't wait for the Mongol Empire episode.
This one was bit late but a good one
You forgot to mention about the rump state of soissons up north? The piece of normandy around 476 AD
The first episode featuring horses
This is your best one yet.
A new video on a Sunday! Great!
What is your opinion about calling the part of the empire centred on Constantinople the Roman Empire after the city of Rome was captured by Odoacer? I continue to call it the Roman empire until 1453 until obviously the Turks have a say in that idea. And I have conflicting views about other potential Roman emperors too, like if Charlemagne should be called Roman (he did have control over the physical Rome eventually).
More please

When u gonna finish the British series
‘We gave it a go’
RIP Western Roman Empire, you will not be missed.
History's repeating itself
The iron age collapse
It wouldn't be a 10 minute history video if at least one guy runs from left to right on fire. I also love the new touch of horses running from left to right while facing forward.
Another book recommendation, "The Fall of Rome" by Adrian Goldsworthy. Basically a detailed history of the Roman Empire from the death of Marcus Aurelius to the death of Justinian I.
could you make a video specifically about the japanese war ??
I don't know why but the way you drew the huns eyes creeps me out
Sassanid empire , sassanian dynasty
I think it's worth mentioning now and then that Theodosius didn't come up with the idea of dividing the Empire. During the 4th century, the periods when the Empire was not divided were the exception (326-337 under Constantine, 353-364 under Constantius II, Julian, and Jovian, and only 392-394 under Theodosius), usually along very similar lines. The division between Arcadius and Honorius just happened to be the last one.
it's geiseric not geinseric
I saw the first version
Roma Invicta! But fun fact: No

Great video! It is incredibly difficult to put the very complicated process of the fall of the roman empire in 10 minutes, but you did a good job! At 4:30 you mention the Romano British asked the roman empire for defence against the celtic raids. Dont you mean Germanic raids? The Saxons raided Britain the most, and it isn't sure if the Picts were celtic either. Furthermore it is interesting to think about why the Romans needed to put barbarians at their borders to defend them. 2 centuries earlier they fought stronger barbarians and were able to repel them successfully. You don't give much background to Alaric and his Goths but it is important to know the roman problems had started before this.
Wow this is a great video, keep up the awesome work!!! ??????
Salazar's Portugal please
Why re upload?
Those horses are terrifying
I like anyone who hold signs, so I can understand it. Nice videos Ten Minute History?? Second comment: When is the Mongol Empire video releasing?
I love the dry humor. It's how I talk about history too. 'Everyone died, and there was finally peace.' 'No. That was a lie.' Also... HORSES! Whew hoooooo!
Really tho Last time i was this early British monarchs considered abdication
This is what happens when you ally with people who don’t cook their meat
YAAAAY ! :D
I don’t have very many good things in my life right now but whenever I see a notification for one of your videos I know for at least a few minutes I have a reason to smile.
My favorite history channel!
My favorite part is whenever someone holds a Soon sign.
(???,)
I’m back bitches
Aw yeah, I've been waiting for this one!
Why reupload?
Whats up with the reupload
I liked the first version more
Uh ok
Hello
Hey guys, sorry for the re-upload. This one took a long time to make- glad I can finally release it... More on the Assyrians later... If you're new here then welcome to History Time! Hit the subscribe button for new videos weekly on Ancient, Roman, Early Medieval & High Medieval history. & Let me know in the comments what you'd like to see covered in the future!
All of this ! From what is arguably the oldest part of the world of mankind. This was EPIC ! Great job HISTORY TIME !??
You are really doing fantastic work. Your videos are so watchable and narrated perfectly!
I really like the narrator’s voice, specifically the tone and tempo. I am also incredibly impressed by how the material is presented. By slowly magnifying the image, I learn so much more detail than I have in more audio focused pieces. Thank you for your hard work!
iraq has the best history and your channel is the best history channel on youtube
Lots of pictures of horse archers. But I associate horse archers with IE speakers. And assyrians and sumerians and the like are semitic speakers, no? Or?
Cruelty, hubris and, short sightedness of humanity reaffirmed.
Interesting relief carving at 14:43-45 of some type of siege craft destroying walls. With what looks like a battering ram that pivets,no less! Great video!
Best history content on youtube. Thank you so much.
Why watch television, which is mostly a wasteland, when you can watch History Time?
were the neo-Assyrians descended from the Amorite Shamshi Adad? Or were they natives of Ashur? They were the ones referred to in the Bible...Senacherib and pals.
Shamshi Adad rocks! Is there one on Tiglath-Pileser III too? He was a mighty conqueror...King Pulu
Great video sir, would like to see a video on Byrhtnoth and the battle of Maldon one day.
Interestingly enough, Shamsi Adad's name means My Sun is Adad who would later be known as Hadad and The Baal.
Quality content right here
It's History Time!
22:31 lol, his son must really be disappointing.
I love the details!
You sir, are a badass.
It's amazing how they still venerated Sargon even 400 years after his reign. You would think with all the empire changes records and names would be lost but Sargons name went on
is this from the guy behind ancient architects?
nice job!!
How you doin ? Yeah Ammorite
awesome. i was hoping you'd return to the early early history eras. thank you good sir
great work
I always found it interesting how a lot of these ancient empires seem to have a “part 1” and “part 2”
And the Assyrians still live today! Amazing people and history.
Great video, thank you
awsome vid ....great work mate !!
SO MUCH CONTENT I CAN BARELY KEEP UP I LOVE THIS CHANNEL GIVE ME MORE HISTORY TO LEARN!!! IT NEVER ENDS WOOOOOOO!!!!
Damn, that's some good stuff!! Well researched and awesomely presented, good job!!
I'm from Iraq, thank you for making videos about the middle east and the orient. It seems that YT history videos are heavily focused on the west and the ancient Romans and Greeks. Glad there are content creators like you who are less Eurocentric. Anyways, If you want help with ancient Arabic texts you can hit me in the DM's :D
Pete, what happened to the video? Also, your decision to become a follower of mine on Twitter is surprising but also it's a honour for me.
Oh Great! We haven't had one on the bronze age in 6 months!
Always love these ancient history videos! They give so much more insight into those mystic era's
Assyrians>Babylonians>Sumerians
Please check out Micahistory, it would mean a lot!
So Sumer to the ancient Middle East was what Rome is to Europe.
I never even heard of this guy. i had no idea he founded Assyria
i'm glad that you are once again making videos about the Middle East and ancient history both of which aren't talked about too much
Once again interesting but you need to make these videos shorter.
Thank you for the great videos.
Love the ancient shit.
Good video, well done!
You can tell you're a writer, you're brilliant at crafting these historical narratives. Awesome stuff!
That moment when you want to watch a video ao bad that you spend you'r data on it because the wifi is so bad. Grate video!
Great video, I love the diversity of visual support (which was one of the only flaws I could find with this channel). I love the storytelling style and the obviously the story for is there any better story than history.
Yayyy!
19:17 LOL
Thanks good sir. Please cover these earlier times, 2500 - 1000 BCE if possible, in future. These very ancient times at the beginning of Civilization, despite their scant records, are very intriguing & interesting.
awesome! truly impressive :)
Best channel on YouTube. Always solid videos, with great information.
Finally Assyria pls don't let go of this subject haha
So amazing a really acient documentary.
As always, a great and unique video. thank u :)
Dang city dwellers. Thinking they’re so great with their sewer systems.
Amazing !
Love your vids! Thank you so much!
yes!!!.Another 32 min. [THIRTY TWO!!! ] of excellent example how to do videos.Its truly very impressive every time.And the length-just watched yesterday Kings and Generals last one about Rome and Hannibal and it felt unfinished-kind of like a hollywood films when U have to wait 2 years for another part.History Time-rules.All the best,I think U r the best history channel on You Tube at the moment and I subscribe them all.Keep going!
How 'bout making a video on Crimean Goths.
More ancient world stuff please. These super ancient civilisations are so often overshadowed by the classical civilisations.
Would it be Possible if you can make Videos on Southeast asia?
Agricultural gods/religions are failures. These communities were built for the gods. Moses’ god says his name is Ayah Ashur Ayah, which is the Assyrian god EA, which is ENKI (Lord of the Earth) the New Testament devil. He’s not even a Semite/Shemite! These fools worship a Sumerian god.
Great as always, I'm glad you cover the ancient bronze age, so few people do.
Truly an impressive video. I really appreciate you're effort. Please make a biographical video on Berke khan and golden horde. Many people want to know about this mongol khan and khanate and how they became islamized
Please could you make a video on the epic of Gilgamesh
just more bronze age and their architecture ,warfare etc ..
Great.

As a British person I didn't know what happened before
China: we have invented tea and we will be famous for it. British Empire: I shall be taking that. * gets famous for using tea* China: excuse me what the fu- British Empire: gets most of China’s population addicted to opium Think it is good to say that is Brits have not always been the good buts in life. But it feels so good to be bad sometimes
Love a bit of brexit
When English people think they're British, lol.
U put a German ww1 song for napoleon why
U
Seems pretty similar to GOT, 7 kingdoms, A wall to keep the Picts out, there was a land bridge, not to mention that got map looks like Ireland flipped upside down and Great Britain reversed
Mention the African slave trade but failed to mention the Barbary slave trade....convenient.
CE? wtc... you mean BC? I mean that's kind of silly.. you're still using the same point (Before Christ and Year of Our Lord ... it's STILL Jesus's suposed birth) Using CE is silly
13:08 you forgot that the Treaty of Versailles (not for WW1)was that Spain gave up Florida
The Tudors were Welsh.
AMERICA???????????????? And BRITAIN???????????????? We Are Brothers My Friend
I can see you take inspiration for oversimplified, and very well too! Also, Prussians gloria plays for Napoleon... Better than anything French....
I love the UK, and I say, you did a fine good work! I know it's the history of Great Britain(Britain is England and Wales) But I wish you would have put the Anglo Nepali war, for that led to the recruitment of the Gurkhas in the UK. Well done though!
We wish the world was different. But you'll get what you worked on one day.
Poland cracked the enigma code not Britain
End it on a high, why don't you!
I’m Scottish and I’m the 12 th great grandson to Robert the bruce
I legit love Britain more than the most british person there. Its history, culture, language and traditions as an egyptian guy this seems weird but I'm learning everything about its history hopping one day it would be my second country to live in and defend.
9:55 Why does everyone think that Guy Fawkes led the Gunpowder Plot? He was just there because he was a gunpowder expert. Even on the first line of Wikipedia it says the leader was Robert Catesby.
Becase this is UK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so Normans fucked the hole British Isles up
You forgot to mention about Charles 1 escaping to the Ilse of White with clann MacDonald
DNA tells me I owe my gratitude to Great Britain, this I am thankful.
I LIKE UR BREXIT! Ihope u all happy on ur basted island ur ducking monkeys heheehehe and yes im GERMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Doesnt even mention the 4 Dutch-English wars ( Me being Dutch and very proud of the fact that 'we' won 3 of the 4 wars. Makes me sad you didnt cover any of it (apart from william II.)
A lot of people focus on the bad bits of our empire because they 1. Are jealous 2. They look for a reason to try to get money or preference. Both of these things are working too much too.
Good video however Elizabeth was very reluctant to kill Mary only doing so after Mary proved to Elizabeth that she wanted her dead
Thanks for mentioning Canada!??? WTF.
That was Prussian glory you nit!
Interestingly they play Prussian marching music at the introduction of Napolean.
God save the queen
Very accurate! Well done. Usually people forget that Britain was the first to create concentration camps and that they exported tonnes of food from Ireland during the famine there.
Arthur is a girl,proved by the japanese

Actually, we’re at 1550 again before you bring up Scotland, wtf?!
What you meant for the first third was the history of England.
Yorkshire known for there cotton !!
Are you really trying to say that all the atrocities that England committed are okay because it’s all good now ? Wow that’s messed up and rather arrogant tbh
Why did you played Preußens Gloria when You mentioned Napoleon
I don't know if you know, but Portugal and Spain are two different countries
East India company founded by Elizabeth? I thought It was founded by the Dutch republic as the Verenigde Oost-Indisch compagnie
What the Hell is he talking about, that's Westeros.
14:30 lmao
Proud to be british also im subscribing to this great channel after one video
the most horrible Empire on the world remains to this day.
All countries have done bad things. All. Swedes norwegians killed the sames in northern and forced them to be mordern, USSR killed over 20 million of their people. China 60 million of their people. And the fact of the slavery in america. How americans and spannish treated them and britain treated others. How germany killed 6 million jews in ww2. How america nuked japan. How japan mass murdered chineses and killed millions and inslaved people in asia. The french conquest of europe. No country have done "nothing"
Woe woe woe u can’t use that song from Bazbattles ??
Thank you! brief and easy to understand! Keep up the good work my man!
Like any major power in the history of the world, Britain committed a whole lot of atrocities.
Brexit will finish the once great empire of briton as lies and reduculouse campeigns lay waste to out minds of what was true and what was false. The people wanting the uk to grow will make the uk crumble #teafortheending
The Cornish pasty is in fact from Devon! They stole it, arseholes!
Wales and Scotland are England’s last colonies, not Hong Kong.
19:28 you did not mention the role of Poles in breaking the enigma code
HK is Britain's last colony? How about Gibraltar.
(2:05) because of ancestry I found out that I am a descendant of Ida, a king of Bernicia
Free Northern Ireland!
You forgot to tell about the mass Muslim invasion of the late 2000s
As the UK economy says, “ More trade, more colonies equal... Economy increased” Oh and NOTE: This is for fun not to be mean or offensive, so don’t hate me. If you want me to take this down i will only if the comment is nice!
You missed Aethelflead lady of Mercia
you played prueßens gloria...over a montage of napoleon...in a video about the british isles....k
I'm british????????????????????????????????????????
What is an example for an english Word with Nordic Roots?
Did I get it Right Dublin was found by vikings?
You mention roanoak, it is Said that the whole colony disappeared. Can you do a Videos on that please?
So was guy Hawks a catholic martyr?
Did the Vikings really found Dublin? Do some People there have Vikings Roots now?
What is a Charta can someone explain shortly
Did the Vikings found Dublin? For real? What the hell
Enjoyed thank you
Thank you so much for your presentation.It was illuminating yet concise. Three cheers to you!
The first convicts arrived in New South Wales in 1788 not 1778
What a proud history we have.

Greetings from across the pond. It's absolutely amazing the effects the Brits had on globalization given the fact that they themselves were subjected to it. The influence of the British Empire continues to this day.
The greatest beverage of all time is Orangina.
While most of your video is historical accurate to some degree, I have to correct you on one fact. Australia was colonized by Governor Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet on the 26th of January 1788, not 1778. Sorry, but as an Australian, I felt the need to correct this error.
3.5 million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars. We got theft and famines in return.
The Commonwealth of Nations is cool, proud to be a part of the commonwealth!
Even though the atrocities of the British empire can't be forgiven because of their influence on the Sub Continent I know English really well and I am in the UK at the moment because of this haha
Cheers mate
Thats why the scottish number one team is called celtic
Ok but why play prussian military music for napoleon on a history video for britain?
I usef to live near were the Magna Carter was signed.
Never underestimate the power of Cornwall.
NSW was colonised in 1788, not 1778
Really good vid, being British myself I thought this was really accurate
And we protect our nation from british empire ..that's our proud history ... Love from Nepal ????
Why a Prussian march for Napoleon?
I mean, Robert the Bruce flopped sides multiple times but sure, I guess you could just call him a hero to Scotland.
16:58 Ah, home sweet home!
BC and AD > (politically correct) BCE and CE. Aside from that, very good vid.
But if u.s. didn't had civil war then British empire wouldn't even exist by 1900. ;)
I had trouble understanding everything. All I learn in school is just American stuff. America is just so selfish. "Oh America is the greatest country ever!" Yah right.
18:38 this is disturbing
I really thought trial by combat was just a game of thrones thing lol
That song at 18:30 is from ancient architects channel.
What does CE mean?
I started watching and I am hoping to see the Easter Rising and what actually happened in the Famine and how badly the Irish were treated.
Damn Britains an asshole
You skipped Owain Glyndwrs rebellion. Great video other than that though
I like how you mentioned brexit but not the scottish independance ref that threatened to break the country
"RIP Headphone users" Haha! Nice touch. 14:27
Excellent!!
UK the oldest democracy in the world
13:04 when looking at the British territory, it makes you wonder why the rest of them didn't rebel either. The taxes didn't go solely to the 13 original colonies did they?
I hope the UK will exit the EU. We do not need a racist little island within the EU. Get out and stay out
How could you not mention Robert the Bruce!?!?!?!
I’m not sure if we have recovered from 2008. At least in NI, wages haven’t increased etc
The Napoleon intro was quite a mishmash of... not all Frenchy elements! ??
It's B.C. and A.D.
"Gwineth". "Grav-eleen".
Game of thrones is based on British history. 7 Kingdoms, a giant wall, not mention the map looks like Ireland turned upside down and wales and England turned right stacked on top of each other.
England the one country to help birth many others.
Intruducing Napoleon Bonaparte with the military march "Prussias Glory" ... that's humor
Now rise for the English national anthem????????????????????????????????????
Love for our brothers in Great Britain! Coming from the USA
???? once a great nation that ruled the world ?? Now the Laughing stock of the world ?? that arselicks the world ???? ?? ??
A bunch of Europeans deciding, who owns what parts of Africa ???? bruh
So Preußens Gloria with Napoleon???
In the long run, the British are the greatest colonizers in world history. Unlike the French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch, they left majority of their former colonies with the education to flourish on their own. Just look at the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong - all economic giants because they used the knowledge of business and commerce they learned from the British. In contrast, the Mexican, South American and Philippine economy is a mess because the Spanish and the Portuguese made the inhabitants too dependent on religion, while the former French and Dutch colonies were practically never educated at all.

The thing I learned from the British is there is no good in being good in this world. Valuable lesson. Thanks.
Soon the only native cuisine in the UK will be kebab.
The 'beaker people' are thought to have come from what is now northern Spain, according to sources I read years ago.
Where are our reparations!!!?
It also exported the rule of law, democracy and freedom.
Dont forget how much americans helped you. But i do love me some british badassery
Pretty accurate. One or two things I'd change. For instance, after Henry VIII split from the Catholic church the English mostly remained Catholic, they just weren't governed from Rome any more, Protestantism grew, but it was Henry's daughter Elizabeth I who established the Church of England in an attempt to unify the country under one (English) religion, which put the monarch, Elizabeth, at the head of the church rather than the Pope, and made some compromises on the key differences between Catholicism and Protestantism. Also its pronounced Grav-el-een, not Grave-lines, hehe.
2:21 I guess I live in Northumbria
God I love my Country??
I'm a dumb American who didn't learn a lot of this, so here I am trying to teach myself.
Your information regarding the history of Ireland, in particular, the Irish Famine is incorrect. There was no deliberate starvation of Ireland by the British government. In fact, grain, maize and other food products were imported in huge quantities by the British Government to relieve the famine in Ireland. One of the major factors in the famine being so disastrous in Ireland as oppose to the rest of Europe (the blight of the potato crop occurred all over Europe) was that mainly due to the problem of subdivision of land amongst tenant farmers in Ireland and their subsistence on the potato crop as the staple food of their diet along with buttermilk. This was mainly a problem in Leinster, Munser and Connaught where wealthy Irish landlords like Daniel O'Connell did little to help their tenants. Ulster was not affected to anywhere near the same degree because of factors such as the difference in diet and that subdivision of land was not as prevalent in Ulster. I have a masters degree in Irish history. I could go into much more detail. The idea of Ireland being starved by the British Government is a myth without any factual basis.
As someone who is half English and half Scottish, and who identifies as British, this video pretty much sums up why I hate petty nationalism. In the past, everyone invaded everyone else, lots of people died, and we're all equally descended from invaders and invaded, colonisers and colonised, oppressed and oppressors. It all happened ages ago, let's not bicker and argue about 'oo killed 'oo. Let's just move on and focus on making Britain a better place for everyone in the here and now.
Scottish independence is yet to come
Your channel can only get better from this point. It really reminds me of oversimplified and simple history.
Hmm ?? I always wondered the history of The United Kingdom ?? thanks
I want to visit scotland that place looks nice
wonderful, thank you
Really the UK is located in the British isles lol
Right thats it you've done it now. Im going to have to fire up Attilla Total War again!
I tried fish and chips when I was in London. It was ok but not great
I’m not gonna say you copied him but you at least had to be inspired by oversimplified
How am I supposed to believe u if u lie aboot how long the videos on for ?!??
Make one for france
Stop right there: The British Isles is formed by England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Eire.
17:10 What about the Steel City of Sheffield?
The US and UK are the greatest allies
You didn’t talk about the Falklands war
14:35 playing Prussian Glory on Napoleon... I’ve never been so disappointed
Am I the only one who got the joke with Prussian Glory being played over Napoleon?
Magna Carta signed 1215, not 1216.
Talks about bonaparte PLAYS PRUSSEN GLORIA
Respect ! Dieu et mon droit - Honni soit qui mal y pense - God save the queen !
The last time I visited Britain my poop became liquid because of the low quality of food. But with great football teams especially Liverpool (my favourite) and the will to fight for their country. The U.K. is a great country love it
17:35 Greatest British invention ever. Fish and Chips. lol
Easily the best history of the UK video i've ever seen. Well done!
YOU DIDNT MENTION STAFFORDSHIRE OATCAKES
Artillery only
A bunch of migrants coming together on an island from what I can understand out of this vid.. everything was imported even their language..
Under the Berlin confrence Cyprus was basically put under de facto British rule whilst it was still de jure under Ottoman rule, in the WW1 countries map you show Cyprus as Ottoman when Cyprus had been annexed. Brilliant video otherwise
21:06 which street is this?
William Wallis was a legend made to rally the Scottish, We only see traces of him in books and they seem a lot like storys
Romans are weak Scotland for life
The Isle of Man is not part of England or even the United Kingdom.
i have a small irish blood in me which means i have some celtic blood in me
Awesome video! Why’d you play a Prussian March for Napoleon though?
And in 2015 the UK shit their pants in the EU cup.
2/10 Not enough negros.
Do you work with oversimplified or is it just a coincidence because your characters look the same
I wonder what it would be like if nobody existed in the emerald and British isles except for the beaker culture
??????????????+??????????????= ????
Cool video. I am an American with a lot of English and Scottish heritage. It’s cool to learn about some family trees. I do have relatives from Australia and I did not know for a while until I took a DNA test.
Where are the reparations for the Scots, Welsh and Irish I wonder.
I hate to break it to you but that song you played for Napoleon is called PRUSSIAN (Germany) Glory
3:08 Danish vikings? There were also Norwegian vikings participating in these attacks
Oh yeah!?! Well I can do the history of the United States in 2 sentences.. We fought the British for Independence and became a country in 1776. We have been at war since 1776.
I approve the ear rape
9:51 "V"
MR TRUCULENT SAYS !!!! The UK does not include the Isle of man and the channel Islands. They have their own elected parliaments. Like Greenland and Denmark . Don't forget the UK was not the first country to leave the EU. Greenland was. It is time to take our second biggest tax cut by leaving NATO ! France wasn't in NATO from 1966 until 2009 during the Hight of the cold war. We are no longer a supper power and need to take appropriate action, like when the CCCP returned to Russia. We don't have the money for Imperialism.
If it's not British....KILL IT!!
21 minutes and 38 seconds! LIES!!!
Prussian march with French soldiers? ABSOLUTELY HARAM!
20:52 Subscribed because you mentioned parmos <3
Tea has been used in india several drcades before china,a merchent from china fascinated by tea and took the recipe to china
Anglo-Norman language? I think you mean Norman French
R u Argon of Sakad?
It's Motte and Bailey, not Moat. Cheers
Is it Britain anymore .
Left out the part where African Kingdoms sold their own people into slavery for money.
A small economic recession that we've recovered from?! Hahahaha
Mohandas Gandhi. Really?
Say what you want but I have mad respect for Britain
This channel reminds me of Oversimplified... hmm
Hong Kong isn't the last empire - I think you'll find we still own Scotland and N.Ireland
1:04 I know that song, lol. My men literally march to that specific song
14:31 dude plays preussens gloria talking about france, smh.
4:30 Why are you using Prussia Gloria which is a prussian song not a French
MAGA!
Hey thanks for the video. Looking forward to future posts.
woh woh woh woh woh woh woh. you cant talk about the tran atlantic slavery and Britain without mentioning how we also fucking abolished it. dont make us look like arseholes
I think this channel is going to grow very very fast. It's great, it makes history a lot more enjoyable to more people and that's very nice ! A lot of information easily presented with very nice graphics Love it !!!
Many countries say us Brits are all divided in being either tea sipping fancy dressing snobs or drug taking gang thugs. But just know that the same isles you countries put snarky stereotypes on were the ones that let you live how you are. Think about that next time you call a Brit a snob.
Great video. Thank you :)
The hell is a C.E?
Great video. You missed the most important invention of all time for the British colony and the world which is the Tractor. Also the bicycle was invented in Britain which is the most efficient form of transportation in the world. The industrial revolution was the greatest event in history from this little Island started by Tomas Newcome and launched towards by James Watt. Without out it we would be living a very hard life like our ansestors.
We are still in an economic recession
im british, welsh, scottish, and irish. im a proud man.
Rule Britannia Britannia rules the waves England will never ever ever ever be slavesss
Neat video, sir, but da heck was up with that random Napoleon montage using Prussia's Glory? lol :D
England can go fuck off up,the rah
omg this is so sad alexa play rule britannia
This video was greatly done.
Ireland : the one who got away
i hear world conqueror soundtrack ..!
Dude, the Spanish empire never held Portugal and never held the eastern coast of South America. That was some extremely wrong history-ing right there. I am from Brazil and I most definitely not speak Spanish, as the Spanish most definitely never held most of the Atlantic coast of South America.
Whoooo. Slow down, Portugal was not a part of Spain as your map showed
Your pronunciation of places and names is truly awful.
The Union of Scotland and England was because England had no heir and Scotland could provide one. Although the debts incurred by Scotland on trying to settle parts of North America are seen as a reason for the Union, it is actually an excuse to give the English the upper hand historically. There’s a reason why Scotland have a legal right to leave the Union (Act of Union 1707) and that’s because it was Scotland who established the United Kingdom and not England, even if the Scottish landlords of the time allowed the government to be based in Westminster (They were paid for this). It’s an important aspect to note and the reason why Scottish independence is now increasing in number.
Sunderland made better ship than Newcastle
RIP headphone users :''''D
You see Britain I see Westeros
Im an iranian and truly These 2 islands are the best...
America. The land of the rebels.
The first British man to recognise what the British government had done during our famine, leaving us with nothing even though we were a part of their empire. It was disgusting how they treated us. Not just at that point but for the 600 years beforehand and the tens of years afterwards. We’re such a small nation and Britain managed to take 1/3 of the world but notice how they could never take and keep Ireland. We’re some fierce celts aren’t we.
eye i am from Lancaster
14:34... what the hell was that... Napoleon with Prussian Glory under the images!! How can you mess up lile that?! Informative video besides that
Didnt they buy alot of slaves from African leaders...
Hmmm... Welsh cakes
I live in the place we’re the battle of Hastings it swashbuckling not in Hastings
Proud to be an Englishman
You included the IOM as part of the UK. reeeeeeeee
Recovered from 2008? Depends on who you are. The bankers who caused it certainly have. They were paid off handsomely by the tax payer. But the rest of us??? You certainly don't watch the news, do you! Also, it'd called the "Great Recession" for a reason, not because it was "small"...
God bless England. What an incredible heritage we Americans have with this rich and innovative empire.
the beaker people where black with blue eyes
14:27 that woke my sister up
The Scottish people were kicked out of Scotland after the 1746 Jacobite rising and fled to Nova Scotia which was very much a Scottish majority province even in modern times they did not fail to colonize Nova Scotia and I didn’t even know they tryed to colonize panama P.s I live in Nova Scotia and I am very much Scottish also I believe that I got the year right for the rising not 100% sure
hyped to be able to comment "was here since 13K" when you hit a million! keep it up!
God bless the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland. I love our country, may our citizens live well, and may we remain prosperous in these difficult times. ??????????????????????????????????????????????
15:57 Many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast. ?
Ireland was helped during the famine, by the ottoman empire
You borrow the art style from someone?
I am less than four minutes into this video and I am already impressed by what you have said. You actually did what the title said and have so far mentioned ALL of Britain and it's people and not JUST talked about England as most "History" channels seem to do despite their video being called "History of Britain". You have earned a subscriber, keep up the good work.
Although our country is devided on this matter I believe we will prosper and become a greater more unified nation and people
What About Norwich
Ireland plummeted from near 8 mil to around 2 mil. That's 75% not 50%
2:38 Pronunciations: Gwynedd- “Gwin-eth” Powys- “P-ow-is” Dyfed- “Dof-ed” Sorry I’m welsh and I understand how annoying it must be to pronounce, (there’s literally a place named “Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch”.)
this is game of thrones
Best part 4:30 since it, Uk and England were under French king and French domination during 300 years, check house of Plantagenet.
No spoilers alert for vikings wtf
Still not better than America's history.
Very diplomatic calling liverpool a major trading centre! haha

Thank god it wasn't an American doing the dialogue ??
No mention of cromwell in Ireland?
Mup Ireland
Bohers? It boers, like 'boo'rs
Alan Turing: the man who hacked the Nazis.
English are so mean how dare you say you britian cracked the enigma code when it is was the polish who cracked it im so proud to be polish????
Thank you for the warning at 14:30
BCE = Politically correct muck.
Great vid
this is a good channel but you need to read about ti more, because you would know that England still has the British empire but its now called "british overseas territories"
Fish and chips, Mary Popkins and shit whether - gb.
Middlesbrough gets a mention! Lovely!
Why did you play Prussian Gloria on Napoleon oh wait forgot that Napoleon the 3 got rekt by Prussia and the northern German States
Long live the ANGLO-SAXON'S and THE CELTS !
this took me straight back to school, i loved learning our history people dont realize how entertaining it actually was.
Scientists say the first British person to step foot on Britain was an Iranian with blue eyes and black hair and caramel skin and there was Neanderthals where the first but that doesn’t count, they were cannibals
Please colonize India again and give us a better life.
Polish immigrants cracked the enigma code
Stop mentioning things that were missed people. This is 5000 years in a 20 minute summary. Of course not everything is covered!
Did I just hear “mahanda Ghandi” ??
.
Well. Brexit means Brexit
P L A Y A R T I L L E R Y O N L Y IN H O I 4
What about the Jacobite uprising? That was a big part in Britains history.
May my ancestors rest in peace. The Campbell's betrayed Scotland and its people by murdering my kin in their sleep.
Great video. I liked the way you focused on the good and the bad aspects from the 19th century and up. Keep up the great work.
Come on where's Henry VII?
Wow, this is a great video, but maybe just talk a little faster. It will probably help quite a bit
My ears hurt from listening to 8d audio
Britons never never never shall be slaves
Most faults of the British empire is high taxes
2:15 MERICA
Very good, but you missed out King Arthur
Irish famine in a nutshell Ireland: Hey England, our potatoes have a disease, can you help us? England: No Ireland: Please? England: Here's an Indian dish you can't afford Ireland: How can we afford it? England: We'll pay you if you build roads and work in workhouses Ireland: We're barely getting paid. We're all starving to death England: Uh whatever, we're too busy making an empire and being cooler than France Ireland: Screw this, we're moving to America
Frickin best place to live....England is meh, Scotland I don’t even know , and Wales just I don’t know either finally Ireland is OMFG yes I’ll happy live there
I enjoyed this thank ou good job.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECCLES CAKE?!
Great video, but maybe add some more music, animations or emotive voice acting/light heartedness to help make it more entertaining
All those poor potatoes
PLAYS THE PRUSSIAN ANTHEM WHILE MENTIONING FRANCE REEEEEEEEEE
12% of British troops deployed died in WW1, many loved the war as it was a chance to travel and fight for what they were proud of, still loved the video and am proud of my british heritage
Failing to mention the Famine as genocide, from plantations to starvation of the indigenous population so the land could be used as an agricultural island for exporting food to other British colonies around the world. And no mention of anyway of the rebellions over the 800 years of enslavement not to mention 1916?
England didn't hand its empire over to Hong Kong for no reason they saw china's fire power and communism how they fought off the Japanese that's when they started to leave
18:38 SCP-106
malta they ruled
Just came for the bit about the American Revolution. It's the best part of the video, innit? Coming from an Irish bloke.
Preussens Gloria while mentioning Napoleon Bonaparte my history boner just got killed
God save the Queen. Haha jk she sucks
the northern isles didn't appear on the maps but the western isles did :/
Ugh, ????
"Wait i thought you're the bastard" "Dude" "Uncool"
So sorry for the brutal Viking raids
Do one for France and Spain! This was very good.
Why do people always focus on the bad parts of the empire, yes they did do bad things but they did the same amount or possibly more good things, without Britain the world would of been much different.
India wasn't peaceful at all..... Very very violent... Millions died... !.!.!.!.!.!.!.!
There was a Palmer carbine used in 1866, bolt action rifle's were around before ww1 .. just saying....
You did...... Well done....
And glossed over the Boer war, and why in 1880 the Dutch had other colonies...I wonder if you'll mention the concentration camps, of all the Dutch fighters families....!.? Let's see....
I thought this was about Britain...?.?.? Seems more about southern England to me......
Glossed right over the Potato famine there..could have been prevented though, by simply shipping food over, but it's only the Irish right...!.? And you never even mentioned the 'Highland clearance' but as your English...!.!.! .... But moved swiftly on to the brutal destruction of India......money greed and power....
You said that slaves were brought over from Africa in 1607...? That's not true at all... The first slaves taken over to the America's were white Scots and Irish know as indentured servitude..... Slaves...... Recorded in 1621, kids as young as 6 being sold by starving patents and pressed by the government, who wrote a charter, stating all those traders embarking for the America's, clean the pubs brothel's and roads of rats and vagabonds....
B.C./A.D, when talking about a history of a Christian culture, you would think this channel would show some respect for the peoples history that it depicts. But hey I'm a dick.
You played Prußens Gloria for France, that is a Prussian march, not French.
Better off in:'( I wanna stay in the eu. Awesome video :)
just to say I am a South African and u pronounced the word Boer wrong its pronounced Bu-er the one is pronounced as a uu sound as the vowel sounds in Afrikaans are pronounced very differently compared to English
This video: History of Britain in 20 Minutes Next video: History of China in 20 Hours Video after that: History of the USA in 20 Seconds
I live in Newcastle and I am sad that we no longer make ships for the uk
lol why use a prussian song for Napoleon??
Your butchering of Welsh Names Is Painful
11:29 Me: BEER 11:31 Me: Oh...
Love your very informative video but when you introduce Napoleon you played "Prussian Glory". Um, no.
Bizarre how the crown passed from the Stuarts to the German Hanovers in the early 1700s. Must have been a very unpopular decision at the time
You mentioned Middlesbrough, you mentioned parmo's. You just gained a subscriber buddy.
Monmouth rebellion?
You mis-pronounced welsh words so hard lol. Just to notify you. F is pronounced as v and ff is pronounced as f
No mention of Owain Glyndwr?
Good analysis of complex history. You did forget Liverpool v Man U and Tottenham Arsenal in the seventies but I will forgive you... :D
Napoleonic War : Opening Königgrätzer Marsch German rulez
Playin that thrones of brittania theme I see
And wasn't William supposed to be called William the Bastard?(after be conquered England he was renamed into WIlliam the Conqueror).
Why do you mark the isle of man when you mention England. It's not the same
Glad that Middlesbrough and the boro parmo was mentioned
What's the difference between America and yoghurt ? Leave yogurt for a long time and it will have a noticeable culture
‘Small economic recession’?????!
Forgot about Owain Glyndwr's uprising
some parts of South east asia was once a British colony
Winston Churchill is responsible for the end of the British Empire. He was a filthy little sell-out and traitor. We didn't "stand strong" under him, we got involved in and encouraged a dreadful war which has been the death of us as a nation. The only Victor was the international Jew.
why is there no mention of the Jacobite rebellion
The real britain did not start with the beakers it started with the stone age men around the time of 5000bc then as you say 2500bc was when the beakers with religion and celts with metal art and tools and weapons.
"The East India Company, founded by Elizabeth the First".........are you sure? I think that's Rowlocks, old son.
"Boer" is pronounced b(who)r in afrikaans
life
There is a dispute out there over a theory that the Jutes never existed and that they were actually just a small subculture of one of the other groups
14:30 Prussian Music.... Over France...…... FUR DAS KAISER!! FUR DAS VATERLAND!!
6:53 Yaaas wit a boy
This guy sounds like Spugesdu
Also, loved this. The history is so vast and crazy! Nicely done!
So, can I make claims for reparations? I want to be just like modern day American kids!
I thought I clicked on oversimplified
We haven't begun to peak!
I like the video a lot but I'm just gonna be that guy and say you skipped over Canadian independence, I know it didn't happen like the Americans or the Irish and Indian but with Canada being a Dominion it set a new course for the empire in terms of governance that would culminate in the 1931 Staute of Westminster and later the Commonwealth.
Great video extremely informative thank you very much!
I’m Welsh and I find the way you pronounced the welsh names most amusing????????????????????????????????????????????????
Be butchered the Welsh names
I love British history!
Jesus dude jumped from like ice age to roman empire like it was nothing
i may not be British but as a former subject i would let them back in with open arms. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
Northumbria ??
The way you pronounce the Welsh kingdoms makes me want to jump off a cliff.
HOW DARE THEE PLAY PREUSSENS GLORIA WHEN N A P O L E O N IS ON SCREEN. HERESY AND BLASPHEMY I SAY
Britain has a glorious history. Too bad it wont be around much longer.
Mention the stuarts but not Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Scottish rebellion against the English? :(
If you squint your eyes you can see Samoa
Mahandes Gandhi. Lol.
2:18 It's pronounced "murica"
Great vid mate, although you butchered the Welsh haha
Gaylic ????????
Great video but damn you butchered those welsh names!!
You missed the invasion of England by the Welsh/French, led my Owain Glyndwr.
Couple of points on early stuff - the Beaker people/culture was imported in, there were people before them and the idea that there was a huge Anglo/Jute/Saxon invasion is wrong - a big change in culture yes but not particularly of peoples, add in Richard didnt "defend" Britain, he actually hated it and just viewed it as a piggy bank for his crusades
So in other words. Was just war
really interesting seeing how much game of thrones is inspired from our history
Always a negative with British history isn’t there - other counties have done just as bad if not worse things but I bet it won’t be mentioned
Brilliant summarisation of British history, learnt a lot about my country that I didn’t know
Polish matematics broke enigma code and handed the results to britain
You forgot Bulgaria was apart of the central powers
Like if you watched this video with a good cup of tetley tea in hand
You do know half the Spanish fleet got into a fight with the ottoman navy which helped the British there was Evan a letter of thanks to the sultan from Victoria
Glyndwr's Rising is missing.
Living in Amesbury, these stones.... are the cause of the dreaded A303.... Where fun loving tourists love to take pictures whilst driving past. Also, you're mis-pronouncing "Llewellyn" It's a "Cla" sound. not "El"
No Isle of Man isn’t England. It’s its own country
Preussens Gloria with Napoleon lol. Funny when we know how Napoleon wiped the floor with the prussians
Magna Carta was signed in 1215 not 1216.
In a series of coalitions napoleon was defeated... well that’s fucking cutting long story short aye
Britain's God against all odds became Christian
Would be nice to give more credits to the dutch tho, like the 'dutch armada' and shit
**YOU MISSED OUT RHODESIA**
Rhodesia was the best colony. Don't @ me
I love watching history videos, this one was presented beautifully except for a couple pronunciations butchered, but was overall interesting. Keep it up :)
The Falklands and Gibraltar?
Super Anglo centric version of history
Great history of uk
Where's Glyndwr?
It just goes to show how shitty Americans are when they won't even help pay the government that protected them
Fun fact:the taxes for the 13 colonies were not even higher than taxes in other colonies and even in Britain they paid more than the colonies
Nice vid, like the Civ V music lol. But (and I hate to be that one guy) the English did in effect conquer France as after Agincourt (1420 i think) the Treaty of Troyes made Henry V and his heirs kings of France after the death of (I think0 Charles VI , and in effect did rule over France during this time. Sorry to be a pompous prat but I'm studying Agincourt atm for a documentary. Keep up the good work
Only the puritans in Plymouth had come to America for religious reasons, the point of the colony in Jamestown was for monetary gain
Britain, once a pagan country under Roman rule and then became pretty much the new tyrant Rome. Too bad for them that they couldn't keep their claim on America and got their asses kicked in our war of Independence and again in the War of 1812 when they started their shit up again. Just like the Roman empire Britain proved to be a bitch in the end. I just wonder when they are going to give up that outdated royalty shit and fully come into the current day and age.
1607 to 1833 = 300 years ?
mahandus Gandhi? It's Mahatma Gandhi , if you're going made a video about history maybe try learning the correct pronunciation before? Still good video ^_^
Bolt action rifles were used 60 years before the first world war
Up the Boro
I’m from Middlesbrough ??
THE PARMO. You sir, just earned a sub.
Thanks Germany for fucking up our empire!! ??. Seriously though, why are us Brits so proud of our empire? It was the bloodiest and most brutal empire in history.
Europe is annoying damn ????????
Brilliant video! You've gained a new sub!!
can you please do France next?
FREE CORNWALL!!!!
Gibraltar is still a British colony on the southern tip of Spain right?
Good video, although left Northern Ireland out at the end when talking about regional dishes. NI always forgotten about ??
It feels so good to be British! Who’s up for tea and scones?
Why didn't you include the trade between norway and the uk to hand over some british isles shetland and orkney as a wedding gift
Didn’t mention Canada or its involvement as a dominion of Britain throughout history particularly its defence against the us the invention of the codes used in ww1 by most commonwealth forces (cree “code”) or the exploits during ww1 to turn the tide of war in important battles (vimy ridge/Ypres)
You sound like Sargon
You miss pronounced mote it's mot not how it's spelt. And it's not the ditch around the castle it's actually the hill the castle is on and the Bailey is the town below.
Wait. Did was American just named after MERICA?
When u said Britain in global dominance I laughed out loud. I’m American
Prussian music you absolute mug
Why u play preußens gloria over Napoleon?
You're very anti British imperialism aren't you
I still shit myself when i hear the name napoleon
Every single one of these vids talks about the fierce viking danes. What about the other vikings in norway and sweden who actually started it all
Kernow Bys Vyken, Onen Hag Oll!!
Who else read merica as merica?
Mon the picts, get it ryt up em roman wankers.
Make History of Ireland ????
Just a quick question, why did you use the preussens gloria?
Well put together video. But like countless ones before it, it tries and fails to recognize the extent of colonial destruction. Ends on the same note of globalization as an effect of colonialism. While this might hold truth for the americas, the rest of the world did not benefit for colonialism one bit. Also Churchhill caused as much death and destruction as Hitler. One of the villains of the modern world.
You pronounced Alba wrong
And then in the future there will be a civil war about multiculturalism.
Really enjoyed this mate. Thank you
The dutch mostly did much of the slave trade but yes the British did create the market for it
I mean, you somewhat glanced over the Roman genocide of Britain. They kind of decimated their culture.
Well actually John put up the taxes to pay for Richards expensive wars
Inspired by oversimplified?
i' ve got seven kingdoms to rule! fear and blood keeps them in line!
Once again people try pronounce Welsh names,but fail miserably. You may as well use Google translate to say it.
You missed out the Jacobite revolution
This channels gonna blow ????
Subbed
nice one
Brilliant video. Not heard of the pound currency before, locally it's called sterling haha.
You played Prussia glory for the nepoleon part
Beginning is wrong the settlers where already there didn't sail from Europe to britian
Please don't depict Portugal as being Spain. Despite the Iberian Union at some point in time, Spain never really had a grip on Portugal.
6:35 "They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"
Thank goodness they’re out of the EU
Bit of a morbid note to end on
Why does Napoleon use Prussian Glory as a soundtrack?
My reaction to Britain’s whole history is the exact same as what you think when you first meet a Brit. “oh”
Nothing about the terrorist invasion ?
Where the sun will never set
Fucking balamory intro
It’s always been England trying to fuck with Scotland, arseholes
You also forget the rebellion they had tp stop in 1916
You forgot the 1798 rebellion by the irish
Oh God, I don't even know where to start on your Welsh pronunciations.
Hearing Prussia's glory during the Napoleon scene gave me cancer.
The only way to keep a united kingdom apart, is to make it one. We should be one country, and a united people. Not this old fashioned Napoleonic era patriotism for countries inside countries, layered upon many more layers.
Oh god don't mention brexit, was a stupid fucking idea that was decided for us by all the old people who've now fucked our future, but they don't care because they're gonna die soon ?????
'When the romans left....' Um. Why did they leave?
you say powys like POw is now poowys im welsh btw
pronounced the welsh kingdoms wrong, but nice try
Your gonna blow up
Eat a fucking carrot u Irish fuck. I jkjk
4:47 I love how the technology is still inferior to the Romans.
Ahh jah didn't put in the raid on the medway oh wel
I’m off to make a cup of tea
History of Britain in 4 lines They hate the Spanish and the Irish They praise pirates as national heroes and sack half of the world They smuggle drugs into China after sodomizing them with their army They think they deserve any kind of national pride when they have no sense of honor
'History of Britain' - Concentrates FULLY on ENGLISH Monarchs and ENGLISH History. Worst of it is, there will be people watching this taking it as read. Do some research people, the history of Britain is a hell of a lot more than England.
Yes britian did some bad things but so did every other nation
So basically Celtic people’s then the Romans came in and controlled them. After the Romans left the Anglo-saxons came in. And a few centuries of Germanic peoples. Lots of kings, wars, and an empire, WW1,WW2, the Cold War. And here we are present day talking about Britain.
very interesting i enjoyed this video
You left out parts
MAY THE SUN NEVER SET ON THE BRITISH EMPIRE, GOD SAVE THE QUEEN ??????????????????
Lol whenever someone says I’m British, I’m like “Nah, IM FUCKIN SCOTTISH M8”
No mention of Culloden (last battle fought on British home soil) or the Falklands?
WHY IS NORTHERN IRELAND BARELY MENTIONED LIKE THE TROUBLES IS SO INTERESTING
It is not Mahandas Gandhi it was mahatma Gandhi but Idc Indians are bitches
It's like Game of thrones ??
how can you cover British history and not mention the battle of Trafalgar
Whats this prussian parade music?? 14:29
You pronounced Gwynedd horribly
Rule Britannia!
i hate to be picky but the music played for napoleon is a march called "Prussia Gloria" who were one of the many Germanic states who sided with Great Britain and who turned the tide of victory at The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 :p
That song you played for Napoleon os actually german.
stupid that we're a tiny island but massively divided. next we'll have cornwall pushing for independence lol.
Napoleon, great Prussian leader
Should’ve put more in WW1 where Bulgaria was part of the central powers and Greece and Romania were part of the Entente.
You sound suspiciously like 40k theories
Thx for mention abit bout Ireland, its appreciated
E
"History started at 1776. Everything before that was a mistake." -Ron Swanson
You forgot about the Jacobite rebellion.
Fucking CE. Why
*Shows the french, plays Prussian Glory
Napoleon boneparte... Then Prussian Gloria ?? ?? ??
So proud to be British ????
10:08 West Virginia was part of Virginia then
19:49 Is that countryball porn?
I wish nothing more than to go back in time to 1066 with a mini-gun and plenty of ammo so I can rid England of the Norman filth WERIAN SE ANGLECYNN
I know the US is relatively new compared to England and it’s history but I think it would be interesting for a video , especially if you spend time talking about forgotten wars it participated in
I love how when you talked about Napoleon, you used the Prussian anthem as your music. I don’t see any relationship between Prussia and France, except the Franco-Prussian war. It is funny and I love this video a lot. It is really useful for English knowledge. Just hearing it made me laugh
Mary queen of Scots was executed in England after many years in prison.she was writing to a man plotting to kill Liz and a point Mary as queen of England as Mary was realisticly the next in line due to Liz having no heirs, Mary's letters were intercepted and she was charged for treason and killed. There wasn't much religion behind her death apart from if she did become queen she would turn England back to Catholicism. But the had nothing to do with her reason for being killed.
Napoleon Bonapart.... plays Prussens Gloria.... love the vid but please...
19:51 don't know the comic but India was having fun with Bangladesh
Great video, very nice! My only grumble is that the Picts were pre-Celts, not a Celtic people or culture.
The UN will be the death of all nation's who stand with it
Why use BCE & CE over BC & AD?
You forgot how slavery started by britian giving africa muskets in exchange for their prisoners of war (which were other africans)
0:35 So that's why you need to research "Calendar" in order to build the Stonehenge in Civ 5... Edit: I got a heart! :)
Intermission about Napoleon: "Preussens Gloria" ("Prussian glory") plays. Makes total sense. Umm, how about you play the Marseillaise, you german spy.
bitch pls this is fucking click bait, it says specificly in the title "in 20 Minutes" but then you look on the video time and it's FUCKING 21:38 LONG! DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY!
English were slaves to the Chinese
Long live the queen!
I'm from Glasgow in Scotland and we went through a period where a lot of the old sandstone buildings were knocked down (not all of them were, the people trying to redevelop our city got their act together), and I went to Edinburgh for a job interview a couple of weeks ago and realised that we are the only city that done this but they also managed to sort of blend the old and the new together and it looks fantastic, where as in Glasgow you get beautiful sandstone buildings that used to be tenements that are now just rows of flats with normal bricks covering up the holes they made in the large restoration of the city that wound up failing and with the creation of several new towns including Drumchapel in Clydebank and Cumbernauld in the middle of fricken nowhere.
Britain still has one colony THE MIGHTY FALCONS ISLAND
How dare you use Preussens Gloria for a slimely snail like napoleon
Great video!
14:31 that's prussian national anthem
Prussian music, Napoleon on screen. HERESY!
Stonehenge, Paris's greatest natural landmark.
Make the history of Romania ???? please
Thank you for the great video!
This is very educational. I hate history classes but if this is what they teach I would love to learn! :)
The Best Video ever by VC3 Productions !! ;-)
u forgot the anglo dutch wars...
Great and long video! super nicely summarized! And be thankfull to the portuguese for your beloved tea!
We not going to mention the Commonwealth realm?
You used the Prussian March for France...
Why is Prussian anthem played when Napoleon is on screen
????????
This hasn't been done yet! Good on you!
I loved this video. As a British person myself, I am surprised how much of this I didn't know.
I'd link to the video, but I'll just transcribe what I wanna get across. Britain: "This civilization was founded on fuck ups, and you know what? That makes me proud! We are more belligerent, more stubborn, and more idiotic than you could ever imagine! Just leave us to our own devices you intergalactic assholes! We wanna be free. We wanna be free to do what we wanna do! We want to get loaded, and we wanna have a good time! And that's what we where gonna do! [God Save The Queen Plays, Chorus Swells]"
Great vid man keep up the good work
Amazing!
I will happily watch 4 ads to make sure this vid doesn’t go unrewarded
Ty
RULE BRITANNIA! BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES!! lol jk We've missed out some events and people like the opium wars, Anglo dutch wars, Maori, etc just for the sake of time. And edit it was 1788 that the convicts arrived in Australia ???? Hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching!!!
This is mainly the history of England
I predict bright future for this channel.
Nice but French ear rape in Napoleon is weask what is that bitch ass
Second!
I'm first
We got more Serial Killer videos coming! Which one should we do next?
Scammer gets scammed
Do I know a serial-Killer more gruesome then holmes? Yes, I call Mengele, der Todesengel! (Angel of Death)
3:39 IS THAT MUTHERFUCKING LOSS??
Holmes would sale some of the bodies of his victims to science in a scam as well, a lot of people forget about this
Do Richard ramirez next
Im the only one from supernatural-
It's an ironic name for a serial killer
My grandma met this guy... her friend was killed by him
Fun fact he inspired the saw movies
We don't really know who's Jack the ripper, so we can't possibly know who is descendants are
What's a chiminy ??? Oh, a chimney !!! Got it.
James Patrick March
Am I the only one who thought of the hotel Cortez
According to The Devil In the White City by Erik Larson the third child was stuffed into an oven pipe at a house they stayed at while he was on the run from the police. If I remember correctly that is.
H.H Holms means HHH means Triple H
H H holms is not jack the ripper
Hey i was born on May 16th
S-Sherlock Holmes had enough
I'm a killer I chop them up and sell it
Leonardo Dicaprio is going to play him in a movie
Why did I read "Homeless"? Lmao.
I thought it said Sherlock Homes for seeing homes
What's the instrumental song?
Its pretty ironic that his name is Holmes.
Yes you forgot to mention that he was fucking handsome lol
I know there is a lot of debate over who is the worst of the worst serial killers in history, but no matter what I hear, I can't get past Albert Fish. Everything about him is horrifying to a profound degree. Especially as a parent.
Isn't Holmes a investigator?
'' chimmeny's ''
I'm pretty sure Ed gein is the most horrific
0:56 In the top right hand corner theres a picture of a guy, am I the only one who thinks he looks like bread
Was H.H. Holmes the brother of Sherlock Holmes? ??
But I live in New Hampshire
I love the serial killer videos, but they scare me a lot
That Albert fish guy is a real jerk
Could have done better with the video. ".....his home being a massive torture chamber.Some skeptics though, have said that this has been greatly exaggerated". They know his house was such because the police investigated his house and found all the bodies/remains, devices and investigated the house. There should be no room for argument here. I'm skeptical of these so called "skeptics" who are doubting this ever happened. There's some misinformation in the video as well. The chutes were used to send bodies down to the basement so he could do whatever he wanted with them, etc...
You should do a video on the toy box killer
He wasn’t actually the FIRST documented serial killer... the Harpe brothers were (I hope I’m spelling that correctly)
I wonder what his desendent Jeff mudget think about his ancestor
Bj
Do a video on Gary Ridgeway
H.H Holmes = the original Triple H XD
timeless season 1 episode 11 covers this
He also owned a small concrete business now from his castle. They did some research and found that he most likely chipped the body’s up and put them into concrete. He would then throw them into the river. A team in Chicago took a underwater rov and scared the bottom of the right and say dozens oh concrete blocks. Right near where the hotel should have been. He also had a early cremation oven in the basement. But then later turned to selling his victims skeletons to hospital for a educational scam
Thanks, I just got a visit from the local FBI for watching all your videos on serial killers.
Why are women soo gullible, naive and stupid?
Wait Isnt that Herlock Shomes and he was a detective (sorry for da English
The animation is so cute lol
I got scared really easily, thanks god you made these videos animated
Plot twist: This is Sherlock Holmes brother and he knew what was he doing but he never wanted to arrest him cause he had pity PS: this is just a joke so ummmm... have a nice day
Supernatural brought me here.
chimineys
TWENTY EIGHT STAB WOUNDS
"you eat a couple of people and a good agent spins it as a 'life choice' "
Is this what ahs hotel is based on?
Toybox Killers
Lmao my uncle is Richard Ramirez’s doppelgänger and whenever he goes out in public people always say something. One time a police officer had went up to him and told him “WOW I had to come up to you, to really see if you were really him” he then told my uncle that he was one of the officers who had captured the real serial killer and had to interview him.The officer was literally in the same room as the killer
May I please have the name of the backround Music?
Can you do a video on Gary Ridgway aka "The Green River Killer". They say he is the most profilic American Serial Killer with 49 confirmed kills.
So the guy that came forward claim to be HH Holmes ancestor? Or Adam Werth? Werth is assumed to be Jack the Ripper by many.
Dude, I guess I'm a psychopath confirmed. When I found your serial killer series, I can't stop watching and am enjoying them. Wtf is with me dude?
h h Holmes sounds like jigsaw
What's Chimeny
H.H Homeless H.H House H.H Hell
Always the mefia, who is overreacting too much to get a big story...
Do ivan milat
Are there no reliable floorplans and police reports on what was found in place?
Do Albert Fish
Who whould eag kids what was the world back. Then
The third brother... Sherlockians know what I'm talking about.
I really enjoyed the Supernatural episode with HH Holmes, especially since that's the first time I heard of him
Oh my goodness in love with your channel! ?? keep up these documentaries love em !??
I am related to h.h. holmes
is it bad to binge watch these serial killer videos? lol
You glossed over it here, but what he did to the Pitezel family was horrific. After murdering her husband, he convinced the wife to let him take three of her children. Then he led her on a wild goose chase around the country, assuring her her husband was hiding in London. He locked her two daughters in a trunk and fed a gas through a hole, killing them. Later, he poisoned her son, chopped him up and burned him. He put the mother through hell, leading her around, giving her false hope, and murdering her children as he went. I don’t think you can pinpoint a “worst serial killer” and H.H. Holmes’s hotel may have been exaggerated, but the horror of what he put the Pitezel family through is usually thrown away as a footnote, but it was much more than that.
It's odd, because I've watched a few different HH Holmes docs on Youtube and none of them mention that he also got money by murdering people and selling their skeletons to Medical schools. I believe he also kidnapped the children and traveled with them for some time before killing them. these were mentioned in a full length documentary that was on Netflix which I suggest, it was quite good.
yo albert fisher is from my town
Psychopath
Reminds me of the Winchester house
Is there ANY solid information in this video?
These videos got me not trusting people
Wanna see my torture room?
Jeffrey Dahmer
American Horror Story: Hotel :3
Not gonna lie, but I'm here because of Culverton Smith.
chimeneys? CHIM EN EEES? ITS CHIM-NEES
Welp we got the same bday
That beginning animation tho... Thats even worse than being killef by Childish Gambino... Lookin like he saw dat fine foxy booty and still cant get straight.... Freakin YARR
Waiting for someone making an awesome horror movie of it from someone like James Wan. American horror story season 5 is a bit like it.
he stuffed a child up a chimney and put two girls/sisters in a trunk to die
He is triple h....its time to play the game ??
4:25 CHIMINEYS??? ??
Sherlock Holmes in an alternate universe
Is this Sherlock Holmes?
usa... a collection of rare and defective forms of DNA that collected itself together in the 18th and 19th and 20th centuries in a brave effort to save the normal humans from being exposed to the problems it might cause among the normal humans.
pesteados tem q matar mesmo pra livrar
PeePee PooPoo Man
Honestly. I'd be so susceptible to a serial killer. I'm an extremely trusting and empathic person, so if someone asked if I wanted something with an anesthetic inside I'd likely trust them and die
Sherlock homes needs to get on this case!
More evil? Joseph Mandela
Sherlock Holmes
HHH and for some reason i felt the need to see if H was the 6th letter of the alphabet lol alright goodnight.
He bad air tight rooms that he could pump carbon monoxide into and then he would prepare the body to sell as a skeleton to the medical community for a good deal of money or use the body in some sort of insurance fraud. I have done a good bit of research on the man and it is clear that he was a narcissistic- sociopath who had the charm and the wits to lure very many people to their death. I believe that that he cared nothing for human life and although a sadist, no doubt about it, many times money may have be the greatest force that drove him to kill as he did.
Albert fish??
If he wants to cause people pain and suffering, he should become a dentist.
Pretty sure he had vats of acid in the basement which would explain why most of the victims were never found
Bgm?
actually, america's first serial killer was Columbus.
He died from hanging
H.H Holmes ? H.H.H Triple H
i first read H. H. Homeless
Is he saw
This may sound crazy to you , But I may be related to Jack the Ripper You see my great great (I don't really know how many greats) grandfather was Queen Victoria's main Doctorate , his surname was Jee which is my mother's surname , I took my dad's surname before they broke up . Anyway , her doctorate was highly suspected of being Jack the Ripper , if not the most suspected . But because of his position in the royal household he couldn't not be searched .
He is the inspiration for American Horror Story: The Hotel
Most of H. H. Holmes kills are mythologized. Deep Fat Fried did an episode on serial killers and discuss a good portion of their history.
Who burnt down the murder castle
Triple H
“Chiminies”
I think you're slowly turning into Captain Spaulding
still think I'm related to this guy
Richard Ramirez looks like Michael jackson
Me when I heard C H I M I N E Y S Me: (This is going to be annoying) ????????????????????
The Green River Killer, Gary Ridgway. The man who murdered so many women that he's forgotten his body count! He was charged with 71, that's all he could remember. :/
“What makes a serial the worst of their kind?” Umm.. maybe that they’re a killer???
Not only him knows how the house works, but the people he hired to build this too
If he was on dota of league of legends, he would be legendary having killed many heroes.
Damn how long has Sherlock Holmes been a murderer
Do John Wayne Gacy?
We need Sherlock Holmes on this one!
Fun fact the iron maiden never existed
I read "The Devil in the White City" Holmes did have a gas chamber in his house that he used to kill some of the girls he seduced. He built his hotel using laborers who came to work on the world fair in Chicago but couldn't find work because everyone had the same idea at the time, he would promise to pay them but never did. Some died building his castle. His hotel took up a whole corner of the block, and a segment was a pharmacy that he owned.
Can you make a video about albert fisher?
Who also came here because he was watching or remembering the 2nd season Supernatural episode ''No exit''? Lol I found a lot of interesting things about hh holmes from that episode
90% of the comments: "haha he has the same last name as Sherlock" 5% : "chim in eys" 5% : random
Do Charles mansion
I legit feel like I have a problem, I am so interested in murderers and watch videos about them a lot. But I can't handle seeing blood at times and sometimes I'm okay with it. I dont fucking know ??
nice animations
This guy really sounds like he just lost a 1v1 in FortNite
Subscribe me i will subscribe you back.
When I was little I was in bed and I heard a documentary of this hotel I’ve had nightmares ever since
Are we ignoring the fact that he is Triple H?
Sounds like the inspiration for hello neighbor
It always annoys me with these stories that they never know for sure. Did he kill 29 people? Or 200? Big difference, fella’s.
I thought it was h.h homeless??????
I am a CEREAL killer
One thing is for sure that serial killers just love killing women ??
please make a video about Philips pudkin the founder of blue whel game..............?+!:'&$&$%&&%&%&
John Wayne gacy
Our country never had a serial killer
This is what makes me firmly believe in judgement day there has to be justice for everybody in this world you find killers like this one get away with numerouse murders and some one has to asses them and it's GOD belive it or not i rest my case.
I call that hello neighbor.
H.h. holmes? More like h.h. homles
Uh oh no I live in new hampshire
SHERLOCK!
Name of the song, please?
The toolbox killers definetly top this H.H. in my charts..
hej
He's a god damn genius
You filthy humans are sweaty, dirty, filthy and smelly.. meow
sherlock holmes' evil cousin XD
The original Triple H.
Do a video on Peter Kürten aka the vampire of Düsseldorf
I heard that he sold the bone structures of his victims to teachers, scientists and universities.
In the murder of Susan Smith, Pearl, and a few others, he sold their skeletons to medical schools after a friend articulated them.
Do a video on Peter Tobin. Scottish Serial Killer
It’s a chimney not a chimerny
Do doctor death
This guy did many trap eliminations and I’m struggling with one ??
I thought he was a detective?
was the hotel cortez in ahs based on his hotel? there’s body shutes, rooms with no doors, doors with no rooms, and torture chambers in both.
sherlock H. H. Holmes
Hang-Geeng room.
Jigsaw, indeed.
My last name is Holmes lol
Maybe H. H Holmes and Jack The Reaper are buddies.
your mom
From the cradle to the grave!
I thought he was a good guy because of cartoons but now I'm ruined and shooked
Theres like 20000000 serial killer vidios
chimmuney??
Title looks like the writer stuttered
H.H.Holmes is Holmes Holmes Holmes
Ah,the "good old days"!!!
How you get into a room with no door?
Chiminees
So how did he get away with this? Police were this terrible?
Unfortunately this is incorrect. I'm from the UK and the famous Jack the ripper we all knew who he was, as the police had all information about him but couldn't say anything as he was apart of our royal family in the past, and because due to that we could never prosecute him due to what might happen when people found out.
Holmes was a genius.
You should do Herb Baumeister. Where he killed gay men while his wife was away.
Just binge watching his vids on serial killers
This channel loves serial killers. Good news; so do I.... ??
Nah fam the worst serial killer was dad from bastard on webtoon
I thought it’s Sherlock Holmes lololol
1 question...... Whats your deal with serial killers???????????
I have hemophobia, why am I even watching this...??
he has the same last name as me......
????????
O
This serial killers story is also seen in the amazing television show Timeless.
Qoute of his:"Pleasure will be mine when I throw you in my sick mind hahahahahah.Even if you want to escape you won't,my mind is my house."
Is it just me or do all serial killers have a diary how bait is that
There is also some evidence that Winston Churchill’s grand farther was Jack the Ripper. He was a known member of a satanic Freemason club (as they all still are to this day) and the women were used in rituals. Hence the mutilation. Churchill is also suspected to be the real father to the queen of England. It was well documented amongst royal friends and associates that he was sleeping with the queens mother for quite some time. Check it out. Look into it. Even if you thinks it’s bollocks it’s still fascinating to read.
“At the time, newspapers were known for their exaggeration.” Nothing changes. ??
They called the building gay lol XD 10 gamer likes I’m so edgy I eat ass so hilarious
The Sherlock comments are gold!
Am not from the west and hence I had no clue who was this H H Holms . I really feel this video is not up to the mark as I didn't get to know anything cruel about his murders!!!
U didn’t have to mention the animal part
Animals in the video ?! I will not watch ????
i keep on watching this kind of videos.
i’m suddenly very confused with the stuff i already know about this guy
Pls make more cereal killers vids
I think Ed Gein was worst. While not a huge body count, the nature of the crimes is beyond anything. I wouldn't look him up if you got a weak stomach.
Go for albert fish next that monstorsity needs a bit of spotlight
It was a very anticlimactic ending to this video... ??
Why the hell did people said he is the worst serial killer in history !!??There are way many more serial killers who are more cruel and gruelsome than he is..
Holmes fired contractors regularly to prevent anyone from fully memorizing the layout of the building. Clever beast. Brutal and deserving of the worst punishments, but clever.
American History ??
I love the music
Make more I’m out of buzzfeed unsolved videos
... I was born on May 16th uhhhhhhhh
The hotel like the Winchester house
So basically the real life jig saw
ngl thought of sherlock holmes at first
The 3 murderers! South Park reference. Lol.
Pearl didn't die duh! She went missing and rebelled against the diamonds
I think Jack the Ripper was more infamous than HH Holmes.
Just call him Triple H
American Horror stories - The Hotel Season was loosely based on him and his hotel.
I’m confused. The killer doctor or ted bundy?
The first thing that must have striked in most minds would be Sherlock Holmes.
It is the amount and complexity of the premeditation that goes into their acts that makes it so chilling. The other end of that spectrum is how depraved and gruesome they are.
When you find refuge in comments.
Jeffery dahmer
“Chiminies”
Knowing someone truly experienced getting tortured by him like I would experience getting tortured by him is chilling
Isn’t it interesting that most if not all of them didn’t use guns? It’s almost like the tool doesn’t matter if a person is hell bent on killing someone/multiple people.... Fascinating
American Horror Story season 5: Hotel remember James Patrick March
:P
Always wondered what it's like to be girl ??... Flick flick
chiminey cricket
Oh rip
BRO!! I'm eating and it said that someone ATE CHILDREN
Now that they've dug him up Sam and Dean can finally salt and burn his body.
ahh i remember when i used to stay up late rereading wikipedia about Albert Fish a lot of times.. haha
girls sure do like bad guys lmao
Jerffey Dahmer.
It's said when the trap of the gallows opened he said "I am Jack" before the noose tightened. And he is recorded saying he was born with the devil in him. He was one of the first people to be recorded on Edison's phonograph.
the way this dude said chimneys chimineys
Amen
Belle Gunness is definitely worse than Holmes by a mile.
So H H Holmes initials would be Triple H.
Keep this series going!
I have the same birthday as him.
Do a serial killer video on planned parenthood!!
mao and stalin were more heinous serial killers than holmes
One of the kids bones were found in the hotel the son and the two daughters were found burried in a rental house basement in another state
This is why I have a pistol on my nightstand
Comment section 75% (Sherlock Holmes And H H Holmes is related) 25% (Woah this guy is messed up!) 0.1% (Woah this is a really cool video i love the animation nice job! Teach me your ways)
no evidence then it's a lie. Too many chinese whisperers in this world
John wayne gacy ?
Chimernies
Why are people so cruel?
Didn’t he have a massive cremation chamber?
The house is like in the game Hello neighbor
Probably the most manipulative to women as well. He could get young women fall for him and do anything for him
wasn't that the AHS guy
I love how all these kinds of videos have longass intros
Oh birthday twins May 16th??????
Do Richard Ramirez
Chim-i-nies
rooms with no doors? how do you know that it's a room ?
Interesting how so many women fall for serial killers
nibba said h before it was cool
What is that dude that was charged for murder and a whole bunch of other things name Joseph something something something
Do Peewee Gaskins.
I need you guys to do the DC snipers!!
You sound so happy describing the gruesome killings lol
I was born on a serial killer's birthday. Fear me ????
I remember building a model of his place once in high school, still have it I think.
What about the Chinese communist leader who killed 20 million people by accident. I think his name was Mao. (Correct me if I’m wrong)
Y is it that people think Jack the Ripper is American he’s British americans stop claiming everything as yours
Are you trying to tell us something with this bunch of serial killer videos? lol
Ugh!
Kill one person and you're not a serial killer but you suck one dick and you're suddenly gay.
No shit Sherlock Oh... it's the wrong Holmes
Anyone thought of jigsaw when they saw the house
Chimanee
Hamilton Hamilton Home Owes Love Memes Everyday, Sucker
CMON HOLMES WHY DID YOU DO THAT HOLMES
is it bad that I'm unaffected by everything?
I have a friend and their last name is Holmes
We filmed the H.H. Holmes murder castle location on our channel and picked up some interesting readings.
What was the music in backround
Why do i like these videos?..........
Here cause of timeless
H. H. Homeless
H.H Holmes, Reminds Me Of Sherlock Holmes.
I like imagining his name was H.H. Gregg and that magazine mascot thing did all of it.
He married a flesh soap maker jk
Can you do BTK
If you’re a serial killer, WHY THE F#%K WOULD YOU WRITE A DIARY AND WRITE ABOUT YOU’RE MURDERES
The Murder Castle would make an excellent setting for a horror video game
this show would be way cooler if they tell us how they got caught
He's related to Jack The Ripper aye?
I know a worse serial killer. Pedro Alanso Lopez, also known as the Monster of the Andes. I honestly lost some of my faith in humanity when I learned of this guy.
I love the series, Keep it up!
I love how you make these videos informative yet they aren’t scary. Thanks.
Hannibal
These videos make my day and idk why ??
I was born in new Hampshire and still live here
I think Ed gien was pretty bad also. He would cut off people's faces and wear them, use their skin as appolstery, a film was made to portray him. The texas chainsaw massacre (based off Ed gien )
He murdered the Puh ????
I knew triple H was bad .-.
What if you call this guy an H.H.H
Why would you eat kids !!!!!!!!
What about in THE WORLD
Original Triple H. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!!
Sherlocks homes brother is the opposite to this guy
I think Albert Fish more heinous then H.H. Holmes
Me. I killed billions of microorganisms. Im also fastening the death of the universe by spreading the entropy faster which means it would reach thermal equillibrium faster
a documentary i watched said he took skeletons from people her murdered and sold them to universities?
(Insert Sherlock joke here.)
"CHIMMENNY"
Humans are truly the cruelest and most evil creatures to ever walk the earth. I thought Jack the Ripper was the worst but this guy seems to take the cake.
He will die by age
You forgot my 187 killstreak
chim-a-neys....
This is public shaming
Russian sleep lmao
I live in Chicago ????????????????????????????????
I heard Albert Fish and instantly remembered Secrets of Wisteria, which is a song based off Albert eating Grace. If you listen to it backwards, you can hear a bit of the letter he sent Grace's parents...
Speaking of Albert Fish, can you do a video on him? You guys are really good at covering this stuff and I wanna see your take on it.
Cannibal
poor cat
Sherlock Holmes Brother?
You're confusing us with Sherlock holmes
Have you done an Albert fish video?
make video on thug behram
“And ate children” wow just wow
“Chimineys” XD chimineys omg
Chimineys
Ted Bundy?
"CHIMINY"
The tombstones were about 40 something not 200
Sherlock??
HIS BIRTHDAY IS ON MINE
Am I the only one that noticed cartoonnetwork captioned this in spanish lol
Satanism had nothing to do with his crimes
It's good to know that my state consists of Franklin Pierce, Alan Shepard, Sarah Silverman, Robert Frost, John Stark... And this guy...
When I was little I used to think drug stores sold fucking cocaine
i think hes relaited to sherlock holmes
No dip sherlock
Donald trump he’s gonna nuke the Middle East and kill millions of people while they suffer from the blast. The government will allow it and he won’t be caught.
Ted bundy was the one that had the most kills
Regardless of how many they've killed or how they went about killing, they are all assholes!! ??????
“Chimineys”
The New Orleans axe-man was a notorious serial killer that was never founded, caught, or officially identified
Hey Infographics, can totally notice the difference in your narrating. Sounds so much better than your older videos! Great job, love it!
Something very messed up about recreating murderers/victims in these cutie infographic styles. :/
Jeffery Dahmer is worse
this looks like reigns 3
5$ says I can beat hem
American horror story season 5 is based on his hotel
Well. Time to hide in my closet. For the rest of my life...
Sherlock Holmes's Long lost brother.
Will you do a video on the son of Sam
JeeJ da killa
wtf? 666k views?!?!?
I'm watching this and it has 666k views lol
Isnt holmes the detective
I believe he was (to an extent) "evil" and did "evil" things however it is wrong to portray him being born "evil" such as giving the baby a maniacal face and the stork being red and black . Humans are not made "evil" and only become "evil" through social conditioning or mental disabilities.

I've seen a documentary about him and that told that he used to go to forest as a young boy and examine dead animal bodies
Well I eat cerial everyday soo......
I watched the discovery and they had the same killing style but its only a theory. All though it's a theory but I believe Jack the Ripper is HH Holmes.
Worst serial killer in the world was stalin Killcount: 20 million LEGAL kills
you mean the best?
Hah Sherlock holmes
Marriage between 2 races like you showed was likely illegal so yeah.
I'm sorry but.... Holmes story is kind of tame when it comes to serial killer stories. I mean... he killed a shit ton of people but he wasn't like... wearing human skin or feeding other people human flesh. Something tells me Holmes wanted to buried so no one would dig up his grave... that was a fail. :/ I believe Holmes just didn't want anyone else to know exactly what was being built so he'd "not get along" with people. No one will ever know what the Murder Castle actually looked like. The one thing I believe people know about is the fact Holmes had a basement that stretched past the building.
If a serial killer was a Christian..that had strong faith to Jesus and prayed to Jesus everyday but still killed people..would he still go to heaven for believing in Jesus?
James March inspo
Wtf
I used to kill geckos and other larger lizards, rats, cats, chicks and hens, bats for fun.I like chopping their heads off, burning them while still concius , or just plane old staby di stab stab....I kinda like watching them suffer while slowly dying...is this a bad thing?
CHIM EN EES
Albert fish....
Hello Neighbor.
He killed his victims, removed all the meat off their bones, and would sell the skeletons to medical schools. I think you forgot to mention that.
I wonder who is behind Holmes all along is it Benedict Cumberbatch or Robert Downey Jr?
Winchester lmao
You've heard of evil morty Now you've heard of... Evil sherlock
I once read a book about Albert fish and it freaked me out
I live in Chicago :(
HH Holmes' wife was Leonarda the soap lady? lol

These killer videos shud be made into movies
My cousin ate my lucky charms damn what a serial killer
I think that killing someone in general is a horrible feat
Gary Ridgway
American Horror Story?

Sounds like the inspiration behind the Saw movies
What a waste, the devil isnt even real.
Be carfeul a serial killer is on lose welp dont breakfast do this for safety

Oh my God, he’s the one that made the world fairs hotel. That’s why people say he’s the worst. Now I understand

Albert Fish is my favorite. Watch the Secrets of Wysteria video
Raman ragvan india worst serial killer
I was born in May 16th ._.

H.H. Holmes isn’t the serial killer. People should stop talking crap. He was very erratic, and curious. Not a killer. Not a thief.
chimenees

Thank you for the tips.
Represent!??
This guy is triple H
People like this remind me of the guys from se7en or saw.
i beileave that all the rumers about his house were true, i actully read a book about him and his murders and according to what i read the stuff described in this video didnt even scratch the surfaace.
No. The worst is either John Wayne Gacy, or Jeffrey Dahmer. One killed over 30 little boys and one tried to turn men into sex zombies by pouring acid inside their brains through a hole that Dahmer drilled himself. He is pretty horrific though.
Can't wait until the movie gets made! The book (Devil in the White City) was really great.
The Infographics Show should be next :D
Is it ironic that his name is Holmes
AHS
I got the same birthday as him ??
Michael Myers is I think the worst serial killer
Isn’t that Triple H?
“Chimineys”?
"a house of horror that makes no sense to people" ooh, i wanna visit it now
Please do a video on Albert fish
You guys do so much research, it's fantastic!
Hang-ginggg
Nature makes serial killers to keep the population low...
Do a video on Albert Fish and mention Secrets of Wysteria
Who IS the worst "killer" of all time? Just wondering..
Do another serial killer,Light Yagami also known as Kira xD
I am the worst cereal killer of all! I have cereal for breakfast every day!!!! Mwahahahaha XD
Please do videos on every sk you’ve mentioned in this, the zodiac, and ripper videos. Some of them sound interesting as hell. True stories are the scariest to listen to while working during the day.
He's my 3rd cousin
Gary ridgeway did nothing wrong
What abt black hood
There was a guy who ate children?!
Probably shouldn't be watching this before bed..
Well i can't sleep for the rest of the night
Make a dr death vid
Eating children!?!? Even crazy people should have boundaries.
Holmes, a detective and murdered. Detective Murder!
Woah, chimaneys
So scary
what about ed gein? he made all tons of shit by actual human body parts and ate their organs.
Nah albert fish is worse
Chimmeneys?
he just got sick of the sherlock jokes
What's the background music?
what's creepy is the amount of serial killer videos you've made
Can you please do the murder of that little cheerleader girl
You know what’s funny I’m reading a book about H.H Holmes in English class

American horror story ^^
HE WAS BORN ON MY SONS BIRTHDAY ON MAY 16 2008
And my b-day is may 15 and the last day of school and that means no presents because of EXAMS
American horror story: hotel ???
This is so fascinating! Lol I found out a few years ago that I’m actually related to him! (He’s like my great great uncle or something) Might explain my morbid curiosity about this kind of stuff.
No, Albert Fish is the worst, even if he killed less people.
It's crazy that i lived in the town he was born at. The house he grew up in is still there and pretty freaky, also the town has a lake called Sawyer lake(name of the family from Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Crystal Lake(Friday the 13th) also has Elm Street. Also the Book Peyton Place was set in Gilmanton which is insane.
Jack the Ripper!
H. H. Holmes made me think of Sherlock at first sight
Omg our birthdays are one day apart!
There is a book i read called, "The devil in the white city." An there is evidence Holmes did not act alone. The worlds fair was taking place during the peak of these murders. The elitist an wealthy men of the world were all in the city during the time and it seems like some would pay money to go torture and kill in Holmes Hotel.
Nah Bayharbor Butcher
What music is being used in the video
There is one killer who is silent but deadly. It's very known. It is... Carbon monoxide
I do realize that he was the worst serial killer but still y'all have to admit that the background music is on point
Sounds like real life jigsaw
the walls of the hotel rooms were filled with copper pipes that would blow poisonous gases while his victims were asleep. He advertised the hotel to appeal to tourists coming to chicago for the world fair. his hotel was burned down and now there is a post office there
Could you make a video about the Zodiac killer?
I'd say that Jack the Ripper is the worst killer, because he would cut out women's uteruses and wombs. He even said in a letter to the police that he would send them an ear from a woman that he was about to kill, but someone had walked by before he was able to finish and he ran. That woman's death was the least brutal since only her throat was slit.
Bizarrely enough I trust Wikipedia’s depiction of him more. The going theory on there being that he suffocated the victim and then dissected them, selling their skeleton for medical science.
Why would he have to be born on my birthday
He was born on my birth day so creppy
Woah
Was American Horror Story inspired by this guy ?
LMAO my best friend is related to this guy
I like the serial killer things in this channel
Why do they think that he is Jack the Ripper if he is then why don’t they find the diaries again and compare them to the letters he sent to the police saying what he did to his victims
the monster of the andes is probably more heinous. and he is possibly free right now.
heres one thats not real: Jason Voorhers
H. H. Holmes? Who the fuck would name their child HHH ?
"Chimenies"
That's ironic, the most famous detective shares a name with the most horrific serial killer
Funny how Holmes is also the last name of a fictional detective
I was born in NH
There was once a women who killed people and cooked them into stew and cookies, then gave them to the neighbors. Idk her name, but fuck that's wrong. It was some european women. I believe.
Axe man of new orealn
I live in a place were a serial kill was born yyayy Send help
Jack the Ripper is beloved to be part of the royal family so how’s he related to this American dude?
Imagine read the title as Sherlock Holmes the worst killer in hisssstory
Is he the brother of sherlock holmes ?
ceral killer
I know one thing about this guy, he was exceptionally charming. And women couldn't keep 'em paws in place, in front of him.
next you should do btk
Nah the worst serial killer was a killer bear from the 90s
You wanna name of a serial killer, Eisenhower. Yes, that Eisenhower.
Wait sherlok holms
He didn’t dismembered the bodies. It was likely that he sold the skeletons of his female victims to a university. That’s why a lot of the bodies he killed weren’t found.
When they mentioned about the ‘hotel’ Holmes designed, my first thought was the Winchester House.
Holy hobo holmes
What if his brother was Sherlock Holmes.lmao
I live in the same city that a serial killer was in and people made a famous movie about him
Wow. His name is H.H.H
Chimeneys
The Axeman Of New Orleans
I think its a great video but I would like a more family friendly video but very informative none the less.
Anyone click on this cause of Timeless
He killed people at the Chicago world's fair. The building is a post office now . He is the first noted serial killer in America he missed a whole bunch of stuff
When you said Harold Shipman I thought you said Harold Shitman lmao.
I like this types of videos
We might even get a movie of it in the next couple years with Scorsese as the director and screenplay writer, starring DiCaprio as H.H. Holmes!
You all should do one for the black dahila
holmes is 100% british just look a the clothes
I kinda admire jack the rippers way
This was posted on my bday
anyone getting hello neighbor house vibes?
Can you please do a video about Atlantis?
I love these serial killer videos from the infographic show
Reminds me of AHS: the hotel
fuck, why do i keep watching shit like this?
Yes, I know a more insane serial killer than him. His name is Janák Jeno József. He is a convicted bisexual pedophile. He is a coffee cup poisoner, who was trained in Toxicology by the Hungarian forensic, he used to work in the Judicial morgue as a Coroner, so he is well trained in how destroy all evidence. He still alive and lives in Berlin, working for a religious organization and as a police informant. Because he's a rat, they don't mind that he is a criminal.
What do you use to make your videos?
I just saw an episide of timeless about it
I think we should take a moment to actually appreciate how well written these videos are.
Girls love mysterious guys!! HMM
Well, I am the most terrible serial killer cause I can eat 100 boxes of cereal in one hour Oh wait...
I'm stressing how many irl serial killers (or potential ones) have contributed to the 252,504 views of this video?
Sherlock Holmes ??
Holmes. The irony.
Indias stoneman
What's a "say-in-ist"? Is there a T in that word? OH. You meant "saTinist". Just like you meant "wriTTen", not "wri-en". And "cerTainly", not "cer-inly". Worst voiceover person in YouTube history. Learn how to speak...
My last name is Holmes...
This guy is the real life Saw !!!
Chimineys ????
Miau
Wow. Out of the few famous people in New Hampshire one of them has to be a sick serial killer.
Ted bundy
Yes, Holmes was Satan on Earth.
North Korean Leaders... IL Sung and his son... They're one of the worst killers and don't forget, Adolf Hitler.
ummm no Jeffrey Dahmer always be the king lol
stalin was worse serial killer
To me personally I think the worst serial killer was Albert Fisch
Man, i just love your content.. Thank you for making an infographic about serial killers. Keep it up guys.
I know one ! in 2018. They or he killed least 25 child girls whose age is around 7 to 13 ! They have still lots of child girls. He or they are still alive !
Because of the chemical attack that happens in Syria tensions are high between Russia and America,UK do America and UK v Russia because that's what it'll.
do i hear 'River Flows In You' in the background? xd or is it just me
chimehney
Aaron Mahnke did two phenomenal episodes on Holmes on "Lore."
I don't know.....Albert Fish was a fucked up individual. But HH Holmes was far more calculated and crafty than most other killers. The murder castle is now a post office, Chicago is fucking awesome, and that makes it better.
I did a project on H. H. Holmes and theirs somethings that are missing. And also the child missing part he wasn't an adult, he was maybe six or seven are the time. He had gone fishing with a friend and his friend never returned. He also started torturing and mutilating animals at a young age. As he moved around the country he would kill someone along the way.
Pls make a video about gary ridgeway, the green river killer. Police maged to confirm 200 of his kills. He cut off his victims head and pther body parts and raped them. Now thats cruel
Plot twist: He is related with Sherlock Holmes M I N D B L O W N
yea another one i m interested in these kind of stories ??
Is that hotel still standing? If so it would be interesting to go there someday
US a nation of sick
I wish you wouldn't have given any plug to Holmes realitve. Let's go back a bit, it wasn't 2017 when he announced Holmes was Jack, he's been stating this for quite a few years, he only got History involved because they felt it would be a good story. Holmes' relative is just in his own world who thinks they're related, basically to draw attention to himself try to be the "great man who solved the greatest murder mystery of our lifetime." His information has been inconsistent, it's changed throughout the years, he's basically trying to make evidence fit. There is no substantial evidence linking Holmes as Jack... None what so ever. Their motives are very different, how they went about their murders were very different, even how they felt about it was very different. No... And I repeat NO Ripper-ologist believes, even entertains the idea of Holmes and Jack being the same person. People who've studied Jack for decades, their life trying to learn the truth... No one has ever legged these two men as the same man. It's crap. I wish people would stop giving attention to Holmes relative. He's delusion. I believe HE believes he's right... But he's not. Then people get misinformed based on another's opinions, then this conveludes the stories and their history for the future. Like Flat Earthers. Some idiots believe it, and they are able to bend the weak minded into believing their crap, which just causes more and more problems.
Reminds me of American Horror story.
Gary Ridgeway or John Wayne Gacy
It's disgusting how you visualize these horrible events as cute cartoons.
Do Edmund Kemper or Jeffery Dahmer
Did he just call it Chimuny
I have a friend who's related to him.
Loved this although I think Jeffery Dahmer was wayy worse than Holmes Also can you guys make one on Elisa Lam? It a very baffling and creepy mystery
This man inspires me to be the very best SK.
Is He the real triple H?
Ed Gein. Nuff said.
Why is Sherlock Holmes so famous
Headless Horseless Holmes
Ur videos are so good and freaking have perfect citation I love this channel
this is so darkk
make a video about notorious mafia men pls <3
I love these videos, but you guys should also make a video on facebook and their privacy rights, and other social medias and stuff in general. Would be super interesting. Love your stuff!
Welcome to Chicago, we have the best murderers, nobody can best us there.
It's hard to take the video seriously with the cutesy looking animation.
It used to say worst serial killer but now horiffic
The worst serial killer is the one you haven’t heard yet
Holmes vs Holmes
I'm majoring in criminal justice and watching these videos you learn a thing or two. Thanks. Maybe try making a video on the DC Sniper
I am so much in love with these serial killers videos ???. Keep them coming
Albert Fish
He is born after my birthday that’s why I’m called a psychopath
Why do I watch these at night!?!?
My birthday is may 16
Make a video on why the crew of Infographics is being held hostage by "Deep-Voiced Man"
H. H. Holmes: the first thot slayer
You guys should do the "Punisher" next. He's the only good serial killer that's out there
You should read "The Devil in the White City" if you haven't yet. It's all about H.H. Holmes. My aunt read it and explained it to my dad and then he read it and told me what it was about (H.H. Holmes during the world fair) and the things he did. I plan on reading it in a few years :)
Top 10 saddest anime deaths science still can't explain
John Wayne Gacy was another Gruesome serial killer, also committing his crimes in the Chicagoland area
Whoa whoa whoa! I love torturing animals(mostly little dogs) when i was still a kid, does it mean that im a psychopath?
According to, “The Devil in the White City” by Erik Larson, Holmes actually had a crematory built in the basement of the hotel, where he would dispose of the bodies by cremating them.
TRIPLEEEEEEEEE H
That was a pointless video
The way you pronounce depravity, is very odd to me.
Wouldn’t it be the BEST serial killer??????
"And ate children " WHAT THE H
Do Russia serial killer next
huh sounds like a jerk
We manage to catch Jack the ripper
The problem with H.H. Holmes being Jack the Ripper was Holmes was more organized than Jack the Ripper. While Holmes might have been a serial killer he was also the type who sought to profit from his murders either by insurance fraud or else selling their skeletons to medical schools as he supposedly did with one of his victims. Jack the Ripper on the other hand was more impulsive with his murders and generally left the bodies where they were killed, an organized killer is more likely to move the bodies or try to hide them, but Jack did not.
when i clicked on this there was 666 comments ;-;
No it’s not KKK it was HHH.
I got a dream about him about his castle but didn't know him

Hentai Haven Holmes
Sherlock ,we found your evil twin brother!
Did you change the title?
Quicklime was commonly mixed with glass shards when used as a weapon creating an inescapable dust in the air causing you to suffocate and burn while the dust would combust from the heat around you not to mention the glass shards ripping your throat apart while you breath it in.
Hentai Haven Holmes?
Wasn't he in American horror story?
We read his story in lit... Chilling
Yeah I can name one, me. Great thing about YouTube I learned Is that nobody sees or reads your comments. God bless you Rodger stay safe brother. I’m doing your will.
Who built that house? He certainly could not do it himself.
Homework is A U T I S M
It’s hh he’s evil
Ruined it but before it said 666 comments lol
O SHEET WHAT THE FUCK
666 comments?? Now it's 667
This should be a movie
Japan turned Jack the Ripper into a cute little girl. So she's my favorite.
This man was on 27 kill-streak in Fortnite until a dude named Mortality had to ruin it.

chim-er-nee...
I listened to the Lore podcast episode on this guy last year, but I’m probably still gonna be too scared to sleep
Do a theory on why twats think the world is flat
The fact that if I had no self control and would possibly be on this list is kinda scary.
Christopher Columbus was a worse murderer, towards the fact of americas freedom
Can you do the worst dictator in history.
I would call all the black people lynched and killed in America as the worst serial killer in America... Not this guy...
“Hmmm”
He is a hero
Oh I know who he was. I thought I didn't for a bit
H.H. Holmes - The Most Horrific Serial Killer in US History? closes curtains locks door turns on light I'm listening....
I'd HIGHLY recommend reading "The Devil in the White City." It is perhaps one of the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of Holmes' life and crimes, as well as an in depth exploration of the process by which the Chicago World's Fair came to be, and it is written like a narrative, really pulling the reader into the scenes discussed. Like his victims you'd find him charming and captivating, but then the lengths to which the author would go on to describe Holmes' would leave you with a feeling of utter rage and disgust. And the book only reports on incidents generally considered to be the most accurate to the actual events, as analyzed by the findings of the time and modern day expert interpretations. All the specific killings discussed in the book are one's known to be true.
Damnit. I not only love these video's so much, but I respect them to. You, unlike many, many other channels that cover similar content, acknowledge that Holmes could have only killed 9, instead of fantasizing about the man and making him seem as horrific as any human being can get. I fucking love these
Jeffery Dahmers.
You forgot to mention that he used to strip down the bodies of flesh and sell the skeletons to medical schools, which was a booming underground business at the time as many medical schools were short on cadavers for their students.
John Holmes died of aids.
HHH
It was also rumored that he murdered his 9yr old younger cousin by drowning her near a creek.
Weird, He is indeed H. H. H
I like his hotel
How about the human minds?
Axeman of New Orleans
Ayy I live in New Hampshire. Also born in it too
The Cleveland Torso Murderer (aka The Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run) was probably the most violent and disturbing serial killers in my opinion, especially since they got away with it.
I bet with the right mindset a man or woman could challenge and kill holmes in his home. he would have the field advantage ofcourse, but give me a weapon if i was born in this time id be down to pretend to be the unsuspecting victim, its worth the risk to prevent his future victims from dying.
I fainted, this is horrific.
H H doesn’t even look like a killer, he looks like a employed 1800’s white guy with three wife’s
Why would he want a coffin full of concrete?
chimineys
This dude was a boss.
Easy quick killing ! wanna know ? Do mass shooting Like vegas !
He needs to make a video on Albert fish(not his real name)!! It's a creepy cool story
chim-e-nies?
URAL (NOT ORAL)!
It’s a useless video . 90 % of the data you present is speculation/exaggeration/alleged things in your own words. He could have done this or that this or that was never proven etc.
Ed Gein
69 Dislikes ( ?° ?? ?°) Nice
Do more of these, they are interesting.
This guy was Jack the ripper
I just can’t rape my mind around this. Why would people do such a thing. ??
buriedxinblack YES
So, you’re really into serial killers.
You would think after so many murders in a hotel people would oh I don't know not be white and go there anyway
Well that's another hotel that's I am never going to
I think he was one who like to eat his victims my question is did he?
the white angel is my pick.
Introverts vs Extroverts
I would say the worst in history was the swamp murders or the mad butcher of kingsbury run
He was featured in NBC’s Timeless
Also expected Pogo the Clown to be mentioned.
So basically it's the Winchester House but with an actual demon in it?
I hate his voice but love video content
Holmes has nothing on Albert Fish. Fish is S tier in "Fucked In the Head"
chimeneys
Satanists these fucking days
Infographic? More like tabloid graphic
Am I late, cos I am too lazy to click the video from my recommendations
Chiminies
Jeffery donner
That's crazy man how u find this stuff
A killer never mentioned, the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run! Aka Cleveland's Torso Killer of the 1930's. I've always thought he was the most grisly and macabre serial killer in US history. His reign of terror lasted several years. And the worst part... He was never captured or identified. Look it up!
What am I doing with my life
Let me nominate Winston Churchill who killed 16 million people in India.
The most horrific serial killers are the ones you never know exist
There is a serial killer in Tacoma rn that no one is talking about The police aren't even aware that this recent string of murders is connected
Obviously Hitler and Stalin arent mentioned at all.....
Some people are F*cked up...
What's the theme song of the music that's playing in the background of the video, commet if you know the name of it thank you..
stop it, get some help.

If you kill someone we will kill you back
It is said that first Jack the Ripper knock out his opponent. He had a statute of 6.3 and about 109 kg. Women were no match to Jack the Ripper. He used chloroform or sometimes a heavy instrument to knock out his target.
I find it harder not to believe the horror stories about him. By now, we all know the wretched things we humans can do to each other--why bother trying to soften Holmes up and rationalizing his evil?
Bitch please I killed thousands in GTA

Do a video on nithari killings from India
So I was watching a photoshop tutorial and on the recommended panel there was a new video from It's Okay to be Smart about the origins of life on earth. I clicked on the link and watched the video. But when I scrolled down to comment, the comment section wouldn't load. So I reloaded the page but then it said the video was unavailable. I checked other videos on YouTube and they were loading fine. Would someone mind explaining what happened? This happened just now BTW.

No, H. H. Holmes was not a serial killer. I don't care how loose or expansive the F.B.I's definition of serial killer is – a true serial killer is one who murders primarily for sexual satisfaction. Whatever murders H. H. Holmes committed, he did so in furtherance of fraud and other financial crimes. While we're at it: Charles Manson was not a serial killer either; the murders he committed or had carried out were for the purpose of exercising control over his cult. So, remember, just because someone kills three or more people over a period of time, they are not necessarily a serial killer.
Take it slow please
Holmes certainly was NOT Jack the Ripper. His relative is simply wanting to cash in. Neither was he the worst American serial. He mainly killed through gas, which often can be somewhat painful. Still, compared to other killers like BTK, Holmes wasn't that sadistic. Unlike most serial killer, Holmes usually killed for profit. He killed to get people's money and sometimes sold their skeletons to medical schools. It's likely the number of victims are greatly inflated, even by Holmes himself. It wasn't until he was nearing his date of execution that he began admitting to many murders, even those that were later known not to be his victims. He was a narcissist who loved attention, and endless confessions guaranteed visitors. Also there was no evidence linking him to the boys, as you pointed out. My guess is that if he killed more than the nine known victims it wasn't many more. If the count was over 15 I'd be very surprised.
Ive figured his real identity
He sold the skeletons of his victims to universities for profit
Wouldn’t H. H. Homes be known as the best serial killer since he was very good at it.
If i was to guess who jack the ripper really was id say it wasn't just one man but a group of aristocrats killing people they found to be the bottom of society at that time.
rooms with no doors?? how do they know??
"Chimeknee" XD
there monument round constantly grandfather used why independent.

A brief about videos topic will be appreciated
Legend says.. that to this day he is still stuck inside a circle of salt...
I like how these videos they give you theories and facts so you can make you own theories.
BTK was pretty bad. However Albert Fish was awful. Just horrible what he did to children.
I can't explain maybe it's cause of the subject of this video. but I suddenly realized this is the guy from Crash Course Media Lit. And a strange chill oozed down my back. It sounds insane and when I read it I thought 'that's not how we experience cold but low and behold... I love novels
This guy is the best at fortnite
I didn't know triple H could do all that
Geez
I love the part "in ths part of the infographic show"
Sorry but you didnt actually say what he did to his victims. Yea, he was sadist and tortured people, but what (supposedly) he did?
Welp
(unpopular opinion) Jack the ripper is an overrated serial killer.
The Zodiac California
Holmes? Pretty ironic
Uh... H.h.holmes DEFINITELY did those things. No question about it.

Not knowing who the first killers you mentioned..... Jeffery Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy are my top two.
The warwolf of hannover. He was a sick freak...

Obama killed tens of thousands when he dropped over 100,000 bombs and still managed to get a peace prize...He cause the displacement of millions and ruined many nations. I know who my vote is for, for "The Most Horrific Serial Killer in US History"
Probally sherlock Holmes solved this
After listening to the first 36 seconds of this video its hard to believe there's a god that would allow shit like that to happen.
Do a face reveal like if you agree.

Do Charles Manson.
.
Could you cover Belle Gunness?
HAHA BEFORE 4,409 VIEWS
I though Sherlock Holmes xD
why is he a taurus? damn...
It's unlikely he was Jack the Ripper, as the rippers victims were all prostitutes, his other alleged victims were not. This guy seemed to kill for profit and to get out of difficult situations. Many people have lied about or faked evidence about the Ripper. Info graphics should look at Richard Kuklinsky. He was a mafia hit man who killed, by his own admission 150+ people. There's a documentary about him called The Iceman Interviews, which is just him talking. The guy was chilling, it's well worth a watch if you're into killers and what make them tick.
This guy looks like Sherlock Homes.
ayy it's my favourite serial killer
Mein gott this is creepy.
Infographics show can you please do top 10 militaries 2018?

When you said "worst," I thought you meant someone who isn't good and hardly got any victims.
This is like real life saw
Love the ep but he did have lyme pits to get rid of the bodies and he never used the same building crew twice
I thought "worst" here meant shitty. But TBH that would actually be a good video.
