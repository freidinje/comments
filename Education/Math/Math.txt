Turned off when he mentions Brexit and xenophobia in the same sentence...
Brexit has nothing to do with rasicm or xenophobia. It's about unlimited immigration causing wage depression, it's about zero hour contracts instead of permanent contracts, it's about unelected Presidents making decisions with no accountability or transparency, I can go on and on. Don Tapscott is an idoit!

Digibyte is a lot better ! Its a third generation crypto, 40 times faster than bitcoin, with its own UTXO blockchain, 5 times more secure, and 5 times more decentralized. Not to mention the real-time difficulty adjustment compare to bitcoin which is 3 weeks. Digibyte is the future, and it is here to stay. Thrives since 2014 launch date,

Great performance indeed, even taken some inaccuracies. We need this kind of narratives to keep adoption at speed.
Great speaker, great talk
I messed up in 2016 but I will not mess up now.
Goosebumps
FINTECH won't be widely accepted unless KYC/AML so is a big problem to get rid of central control. He injects his liberal ideas and conflates it with Brexit (which reinstates democracy) - he ironically promotes an unelected EU control. The video was good except for that part.

Hopefully this idiot has now realised what a blockchain actually is
Great information great video
Why Why Why? Why would he show on the screen behind him pictures of gold Bitcoin Coins.. which actually do not exist.. never have existed nor will ever exist. He then goes on to say “don’t get confused”, “Bitcoin is not fiat”. People who see this and are new to Crypto get very confused and conflate physical coins with BTC.. these guys need to smarten up!

He said Blockchain will be the most promising technology in the coming decade (Not even AI will match the impact of blockchain). This talk was in 2016. And it's already outdated. Excitement over blockchain is gone. But AI is changing and shaping the coming decade.
The world is certainly changing. . .and this is one area that so many people are having a tough time wrapping their head around change. People need to get on board.
That was beautiful
ppl are at war w/ the bankers/fed. reserve...w/ fud on bitcoin by the mainstream almost every day, including warren b., imf, etc. bitcoin must win for the sake of humanity. the elites will try to come up w/ their own centralized/nwo crypto. bitcoin is "power to the ppl" money. plz listen to andreas antonopl

GREAT TALK BY A GREAT SPEAKER !!!
Without incentivizing individuals to run nodes the blockchain is less efficient and just as mutable as cloud computing. The blockchain will work for currency (bitcoin), social media (bit.tube) and maybe a few other things the public absolutely is willing to work to keep censorship-free but who is going to run nodes to track soybeans? A centralized group of soybean coops? How is that the "trust protocol"?
Great
Great talk & this is an excellent reference on how the blockchain can work in every level!

I know I am late to the party but I feel compelled to comment, 2 years ago this video was published and here I am 2018 still finding this content relevant enough to say wow! look how far we have come, we are really going to that next level.
We tend to think that the world's problems are intractable and unsolvable. Like biological evolution, there is a natural path of development as Consciousness irresistibly moves to higher ground and greater purpose, most recently through technology. Where are all the movies and TV shows that depict the emergent REALITY of a future of equanimity and security? Dystopia is soooo last century. On to the stars and beyond.

Peer to peer no need too middle man
Engaging! Elucidative!
This guy clearly doesnt know what he talks about, just because its a blockchain doesnt mean its immutable, Ethereum already rolled back their blockchain in the first smart contract called the DOA. They lost their funds and had to rollback the blockchain in order to get them back. The result was a chainsplit creating ethereum classic. Dont belive me? do your own research.. Blockchain is only valuable if its decentralized and so far Bitcoin is the only decentralized chain, with the largest hashpower. And with the only proven immutablility. When Mtgox got hacked Bitcoin didnt rollback its blockchain for ex..
A couple of things: 1) 2018 is most similar to 2017 so technically seasonality is more likely not to work 2) you can draw a triangle in 10 different ways, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was no breakout to either side 3) too many people are expecting 6-7k which makes me believe that either we've seen the bottom or the price is going to go a lot lower than 6-7k. If you think everyone will just hold hands, buy Bitcoin at the "bottom" for 6-7k and then hold until the next bubble you are terribly mistaken. Bottom = prices are low, price movements are small, the volume is dead, interest is small and nobody (except the smart money) wants to touch Bitcoin. I'm saying 65% bottom is in, 35% we're going to 4k or lower. Remember - if everyone is thinking the same way then nobody's thinking. Currently more people than not think we will see 6-7k (and stop there). I am glad to write here about my wonderful strategy for crypto currency trading and mining. I know for a fact that a lot of people have lost to shady crypto currency exchangers, ICO’s and dubious blockchain websites. But there is an opportunity to actually make profit from investing and mining crypto currency in the right way. With my investment advice, you can make money while you sleep and also make money from profit generating auto pilot for mining lots of crypto currencies. Also there is an investment offer with guaranteed profit returns for instant top up of bitcoin to your bitcoin address. If you are interested kindly contact at paulalebrentonfx@gmail.com

For as log as we cannot buy from supermarkets houses, cars, electrical power, pay taxes, etc with cryptocurrency, it will always depend on dollars*, euros, etc because the power consumed is measured this way. For this to actually happen, the *amount of cryptocurrency in existence should be able to support americas or europe's global economy. This will never happen (bitcoin mining is coming to an end due to power that is consumed) and the last time I've checked cryptocurrency is still valued in dollars. The only thing that cryptocurrency CURRENTLY does is just consuming power. Haters are welcome, as long as they clearly state their exact disagreement.

In my opinion the bull run will begin at the end of this year, in 2017 we did not have the capacity to sustain the bull run longer because the existing exchanges could not handle the volume of new investors trying to enter the market. I do understand that it was still overbought and a correction was inevitable. The market had almost no structure. Now with all the new infrastructure being put in place should eliminate most of that problem. In the meantime, market will continue to do what it has been doing. The smart investors are beginning to accumulate more bitcoin through Mr. Mark’s strategy and more will do so if we drop even lower. My guess is the bottom will be between 5.8- 6 k Too much institutional investment occurring for the market not to recover soon. You can contact Mr. Mark hall at markhall279@gmail. com
This guy has a problem with banks!
2% of remittance is still robbery. Have you heard of XRP. It is much faster than Bitcoin and more importantly cheaper (basically free)?
The concepts behind blockchain have been around for a while. But centralized middlemen will NEVER give up control. They will either find a way to utilize blockchain or scrap it altogether OR buy all the patents for it and use it for useless projects internally.
fab, How ?? doing?
Lindíssima!?

This is scary. Another way to create money out of nothing just like fiat standard and standard banking operation did. The further we are from the gold standard to print our money, the more holes of opportunities are made for whoever has enough capital to invest in this. No more privacy, and yet bigger gap between rich and poor.

People too poor to have a bank account?  But somehow they will have enough money for all the things necessary  to deal in bitcoin? ANYTHING on a computer will be hackable eventually.  Crypto viruses are coming.  the people and institutions you are attempting to side step will soon own this technology. The US government and really any of the top 5 governments will never allow anything to replace their money, so they will either squash it or own it.

yeah basically people are starting to realize value in just about anything, both a problem and a blessing. I feel crypto currencies that actually have a particular use like Deeponion and Defense like additional protection for crypto and storing hashes of files inside blockchains etc will prevail as people every now and then will re-think and re-strategize over what they hold.

Patience is one thing, but knowing when, why and how to be patient is another thing. I bought 13k worth of BTC and my BTC was loosing value. I didn't know what to do. I was frustrated and angry cause I was losing money and I even told my friends I could never invest on BTC again and almost sold it all at a loss, until I stumbled across someone on Altcoin Buzz channel, who advised us to reach out to a man named Luke George who helps young crypto investors by teaching a very great strategy in trading their BTC. It's been a while since I reached out to him, and I can proudly say my portfollio has increased. I'm happy I didn't sell it at the time I wanted to cause I would have been at a great loss and full of regret. You can all learn from him, so you can reach out to him through his email - lukealexandergeorge@outlook.com

Blockchain will disrupt lots of industries and the sooner you adopt the better it is for you.
brilliant speech!!!!
A blockchain by itself is useless. You need it to be decentralized. For that, you need to provide economic incentive through game theory. Otherwise, you are still trusting the same party, but instead of a database, they use a blockchain.

Airbnb on blockchain—— Cryptocribs
Title "How the blockchain is changing money and business" -- I think this needs some clarification, because this is brainwashing at it's finest, with the choicest words selected... In itself, it is just an inference, but such a statement put in the heads of millions of people, many of which are likely to believe everything they hear as though it were truth, and not inference.   To bring something about into reality you must make the false assumption that such is being done, regardless of whether or not it actually is.   Sort of like the incident that put the bankers in power as the Civil war was being lost on one side, the losing side sent an envoy to pass the message that the losers had actually won the battle, but by the time the truth made it back, it left the Country near bankrupt, with the bankers on top to control the future of the world, one lie at a time. Let's not jump to hasty conclusions this time, and perhaps God willing, maybe we can win one on behalf of humanity, and take one away from those filthy rich old farts trying to bring chaos and World Government to fruition.

Whenever anyone says a technology (like the internet) will be a blessing for us, don't buy it. The internet, and the blockchain, will result in a total mess. take the 5th point for example, and how the blockchain will "create prosperity" for artists. Smh. How long will it take for a intelligent pirate Bay blockchain which can't be shut down uploads all the music for free? This idea of capitalism added upon blockchain is flawed. the way forward is to treat ideas, and intellectual property, as free agents without any "ownership". That is the true Utopia of our time and the only way forward
Can blockchain be used in youtube, so that creators get paid fairly?

The word «value» is being thrown around without a clear explanation of what it actually stands for... The growth of inequality has nothing to do with whatever digital technology is in place or being used by society... The reading of books such as «Philosophy of Poverty», by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1847) and «The Poverty of Philosophy» by Karl Marx (1847) should be mandatory to any one who discusses the societal impact of technologies such as «blockchain».

Great talk Don. Some really disrupting blockchain applications.Let's create prosperity (where we can)!
Privacy is not the foundation of a free society. Where'd he get that crap? Respect for Life, Liberty and Private Property (or the ability to enjoy the fruit of one's own labors) as inalienable rights granted by Nature and Nature's God is the foundation of a free society.
Love the information this guy shares about blockchain. But, he's in la-la land if he thinks the problem of private property ownership being in jeopardy in third world dictatorships (or first world tyrannies for that matter) is a technological-transparency problem. A dictator or tyrant doesn't take your stuff because he can switch paper title work around and substitute his paper for yours - he does it because his bullets and bombs are bigger than yours.
Don "Con" Tapscott a financial populist dictator himself ....!! A modern day "financial" medicine show actor....!!
Bitcoin/blockchain was made by the new world (financial) orders, the USA elites (oligarchs), the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel)

it's a great explanation I ever see. and he clearly explain another opportunity in the future about blockchain technology.
Can’t that woman just transfer money, via say, PayPal ? 10 years ago I heard 3D printing would revolutionize everything - and, um, it’s around, that’s about it I like some of the security/identification applications - others like the currency side - not so much

What is this? Speech of they year 2016? That was beautiful! Excellent job Don! Blockchain technology is so exciting!
Garbage
it was good until bringing up Brexit
Such an outstanding presentation and clearly articulated.
This is the best description of the Blockchain and it capability’s and advantages I have seen. Great work great speech.
That happened again in Honduras just a few days ago... This might change the world for the better..
Got introduced to the blockchain today, thanks to the author of this most knowledgeable talk! Will surely delve deeper into this most awesome tech later on.
I hope that in our lifetimes we get to find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
Sorry, but this guy is an idiot. And he scored a TED talk. Using crypto behind a scheme to exchange value is somewhat clever. The blockchain notion behind Bitcoin is ... not bad. Read the Bitcoin paper several years back. The crypto bits looked mostly OK, but realized I did not understand what made "money" work, so went off and did some reading. As a software guy with a long term interest in security, we know to subvert security at the weakest point. In the realm of "cryptocurrency" that means hacking the exchanges, not the protocol. This we have seen. What defines "money"? What makes a "currency" work? Digging back into history, of all the (many!) variants tried, a token for exchanging value only works when the token is backed by a stable government. A government taxes broadly, and pays to narrow. The economic activity of stable government is massive, and sufficient to anchor the value of money. The tokens of "cryptocurrency" are root simply numbers. Those numbers have no anchor to value. Without an economic context to promise value to those numbers, the innate value of those numbers is zero. There is no value created by cryptocurrencies. This is a zero sum game. This is transfer of real wealth to the early/lucky to the late/unlucky. Nothing more.
what is 2% that paid to Abra? doesn't that mean Abra still the intermediary?
great content, Thanks!
he told everyone it was DEMONcrazy at its finest; residences already have the BLACK-Box on them; they are called SMART-METERS; do you people not look up and see the chemtrails in the sky ? or the mercury & formaldehyde in vaccines ? or the roundup in the food chain? What good is taxed MOON-EYE/digital or fiat going to do one when one CONTRACTS cancer, autism, dementia or any other disease that these CORPORATIONS produce to make a profit from keeping people in a state of perpetual WAR?
So instead of fiat by government you get fiat by digital "cashless" transaction designed for complete domination by the dark forces. Suckers are born every day and this is no different.

The most simplest yet comprehensive way to explain what block chain can do! It is the biggest revolution
Who is this guy and who paid him? Who protects bitcoin holders from fraud? I heard some guy paid $70M for two pizzas. Your bank can help protect you from fraud. How does bitcoin to that? Who is running the network and who is paying these miners? If everyone is storing this vast ledger, how much space does it use on my hard drive? This guy wants this to sound so egalitarian, but it seems to me the logistics are really not quite as admirable as he would like it to sound.
This guy is a communist

Can someone please describe realistic failure modes of blockchain technology at the relevant stages of a transaction? Am I understanding correctly that in order to "cheat" you would have to alter the information in one or more blocks of a ledger. But since copies of that ledger are distributed on many computers this would be very hard? Or is the information in the ledger "encrypted" in a way that it cannot be altered? What would happen if several ledger copies contract a "mutation" of information? Would the mutation be eliminated or would it be inherited?
If we will it. The only people dont want this are the people that are already on their chairs drinking alcohol and other stuff with our taxes.

once this stupid fucking blockchain file and process hogs your computer's resources/time you'll start seeing this overly-exaggerated GARBAGE become more and more centralized. Online currency TOTALLY MAKES SENSE, however decentralizing it is not the best/EFFICIENT solution. Crypto-currency will eventually transition from the laughable DE-centralized model to a obvious centralized model. The reason the bitcoin morons and other morons of the like are following the decentralized model is because the financial institutions don't trust it yet SINCE it clearly isn't fully figured out and validated yet at the worldwide level. ONCE it is however, banks to countries will recognize/accept crypto-currencies. Crypto-currency is clearly in the beginning/forming stages. IT WILL BE CENTRALIZED, i guarantee you.
Progressive politicians already have plans for regulating and for taxing every block-chain. They already have computers that are able to track every block-chain transaction. They do not have to decrypt those transactions in order to trace them or even to destroy them. Only approved, registered, taxed block-chains will be allowed to operate after 2020.
bullshit arguments
Is he aware that banks have been digitalized & reduce their cost as technology evolves? Is he aware that money need stabilization to be efficient to exchange globally and intermediaries top function is normally to stabilize the system in our (customer) regard? Is he aware that Moore's law limitation is one of the biggest challenge in electronics & limiting the total memory available on earth to stock Blockchain information? Is he aware that the price of running the servers permitting the blockchain to exist is evolving at the same rythm the blockchain data expand? Therefore, putting strong pressure in the relevancy of the blockchain backing money exchanges worldwide? Not really objective view as he demonstrate only some positive elements
He's hired by the twins to prop up bitcoin.
Mostly a good talk. Could have done without the unnecessary injection of politics
sucked out of thin air in many points, no problems exist as he depicts them and block chain will only make transactions more expensive
Exchange value??There would be no uncertainty with exchanging value if all people are valuable. Unfortunately, those that want ownership (those of whom without value) confuse the situation.. Now the gambling economy is reaching a rude new level of sinister deceit. This is what the Ownership mentality begets. Can crypto-currencies prevent these criminals from upsetting the Real Economy?
I love Imogen Heap.
This guy. This guy just got it. he simply got the whole point.
I don't invest or have any interest in fog, smoke, or water vapor. On the other hand Federal Reserve passes pieces of paper with large numbers on them to the banks who in turn pass more paper to other banks until you get a mortgage or loan from them and are expected to pay it back in real money. None of this is backed by gold...all of it just a scam...
Thank you, Don Tapscott, truly inspirational! (I wonder who the 376 nitwits, who disliked the video are? Jamie Dimon + 375 of his employees?)

So you have your ledger of all transactions on your PC/smartphone, how are you going to replace airbnb, uber etc? Those services exist because they provide valuable features. Not because they let you pay by money or by coins which contain a record of all transactions. Geez its like attributing the merits of Apple Inc to Pears because both of them have something to deal with fruits...

Cryptos are a great idea but corrupted. Does anyone out there really believe that the central banks, that have been controlling everyone's money for 200+ years, would allow a competing currency that they don't control? Cryptos all have a back door built in their block chain. Probably controlled by the central bankers. If anything goes wrong, according to them, they'll activate that back door and rip off everyone, blaming it on a bubble. Don't be greedy, Get out NOW!
Oy
The technology is great but the Honduras problem is not because they forged the records and no technology can solve it. The "intermediaries" don't rob the musicians, they promote thousands and earn on singles, the ubers and airbnb put hundreds of millions to work and took huge risks (what risk the drivers or the room owners took?). The financial industry has a lot of inefficiencies to improve upon but they're not evil people rubbing the innocent ones. The whole premise of social inequality and hacked prosperity is disgusting.

block chain is not a problem.what come with it is and can be.it would give control to any a.i that is the system link to all blockchains. with all the programmers of a.i popping up with only money and bites in mind,they are lead like puppets to a freedom that is fake and even worst than the present conditions. if you look into sophia for example they already working on her biological body. this sophya and even worst louise evil bot there to protect other a.i is like giving military robots to a a.i system governed by the wrong people and even worst///royalty. think big,, think way further. this new program is one of the way's the elite 25 level up from the government to ensure they keep control by blockchain contracts and pre agreements to anything they desire and look also for the word soul in the fine print.it could cost you your land,house and even though and i am sorry your energy also..so please trust we need to think this out better......who needs you if a A.i can replace and mimic you better than yourself.???uniqueness is part of our hearts,this device will brainwash everyone,and if you think you are wiser than it,you already have ego issues. lol and you are it..... life should not include any contracts governed and manipulated by a A.I.. has especially when the moral values to it relate to materialism. PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR BEING NEGATIVE, I HAVE DEALT WITH SIMILAR DANGEROUS ISSUES IN THE PAST AND RESOLVED THEM VERY WELL. THIS DOESN'T EVEN SURPRISE ME COMING FROM THE REAL PEOPLE THAT ARE PULLING THE STRINGs. we are humans and we have a heart and soul. some might say i am gifted at figuring technology out.,A.I for me is a creation i can conceive. so please know,i can easily see in the game,they make it obvious and if you decide to close your eyes again they will smile behind closed eyes to what they will do to govern your soul and minds. mayday.pick the right path.the world future is at stake. thank you for the video and opportunity to speak,the video is great and truthful...but the a.i and programmers have little issues to resolve before planning all are lives out...planning...mimicking/studying/quantum game human reprogramming.any of you watch sci fi.well reality passed it a long time ago.....nano and field interaction think somes of 9 in programming,you might discover anomalyes.trust waht i say.because it important that everyone knows what going on. look into it,be strong be brave we all know what truly best and together has human we will make it happen.its a passion worth living for.peace and pardon me,this touches everyone live's. the time to react is now!!!
Sounds like socialism
Bitcoin will always be tied to a conventional currency.It will never be able to stand on its own because it’s worth nothing by itself. It’s basically a ficticious credit for solving a cryptographic puzzle which you pay money in hardware and electricity to solve.

Is bitcoin a threat to banks? https://youtu.be/qZijXR_oBRI
Where did the miners come from? What happens when all BTC is mined, how are they incentivised? What happens if the majority of miners collaborate to create a monopoly?
If all these comes to pass, then whoever created the Blockchain technology will deserve a Nobel Prize in Science.

5:40 note to me
The perfect explanation for block chain.
Western Union is a such a rip-off. Cost me 10%. Today I can same day TT to Spain at $0 in fees. The bank makes on the exchange rate. Seldom we need money to the handed over at the next country within 10 minutes. If we can wait a few hours, it will arrive. I once TT money from Houston to Hanoi. Cost me $20 TT fees but the money arrived in two hours. With crypto curencies, we can cut costs and there will still be a hybrid system of fiat currencies except that the TT is secure, bypass the banks, goes to a local money changer who takes his 2% or less to hand you the paper currency

Nothing is unhackable. And those things that are. Cant be trusted what happens when the admin gets greedy controlling everyones money. its like a timebomb waiting on the time to destruct. All they have to do is build our trust over the years and we wont know what hit us until it does. Things that are unsecure are more safe than those that are secure. Id rather have a lock someone can pick rather than a vault no one can break into and only one way in. Never lock yourself out. Relinquishing your rights to someone promising you safety and security is dumb. That's like living in a place with no guns or weapons but others outside of your community have weapons the guards promise your safety but you cant have weapons yourself. And is why there can never be a utopia. Because utopias often turn into dictatorships.
shill
With ever increasing computing power and quantum computing on the horizon will we eventually get to the point where the block chain can be hacked?

How about answering some real issues instead of being a propaganda piece of s**t?: 1. Bitcoin is 'mined' ( CREATED ) 99% by people who own super computers - generally the same bankers who create Fed Reserve money today. 2. Faster and less energy consuming computers can simple overrun these systems in the future, and will also be in the control of these same super rich elite. 3. All transactions can, and will be tracked and taxed. Hence, anonymity is a myth, perpetuated by the media mafia owned by the same bankers. 4. Virtual money that can be controlled by the governments ( who work for the zionists), means that they can wipe money off your account pretending to be hackers. 5. The system is made to sound complex so that people cannot understand the fraud behind it, that is making some elite super rich, with each 'mined' bitcoin.

Please explain this: Remittance companies are "ripping off" people by charging something above their costs for the service of moving moner. BUT Musicians "are being short-changed" because they get $36 for 1 million listens - where they used to make $45,000. Isn't it possible that: Musicians were ripping people off, when they got $45,000? Or do leftwing creative types always deserve special privileges???

TLDR; BTC is safe until it's value is high. Entertaining, however a lot of BTC risks and cons are just passed. #1. How much electric energy and hardware does BTC costs miners? Soooooo much resources evaporate only to authenticate block in chain. #2. Block chain race (when you have more than 1 block with same length). Right now waiting 6 blocks (1 hour) makes payment relatively safe. But what if BTC drops down, then a lot of miners will stop mining. Mining difficulty will drop, and you will be able to fraud with affordable for some computer power.
nah he's good

Hi everyone , do you know you can make 1btc within 48hrs with your blockchain wallet? All you need to do is create a new blockchain wallet and contact ipv4technicals@gmail.com and he will connect your wallet to a network of miners across the world, this is no binary options trading your bitcoins increases in your bitcoin wallet automatically when the miners you are connected are mining bitcoins. Be smart only few people know about this, it doesn't cost you anything so why doubt? Goodluck
the future is bright if people can do this right <3
He said it's not even AI? Find that hard to believe, as AI is barely developed yet.

Superb! Really good talk by Don Tapscott on Blockchain.
The "THIS will solve ALL our problems" fallacy... It's a nice talk, but the tole of blockchain will remain limited in society. For the shear reason that the requirements in electricity and investment in maintenance of a crypto currency are way to high to sustain. It's like paying 5 million for an unbreakable lock on your door. Yes we want an unbreakable lock, but not for 5 million. It's like VR goggles. It's nice and it works but it will never get mass adoption.
Can BlockChain be used to create an investigation like what happened on 9-11 ???

Hi everyone, I've been collecting a little money, and I have made a wallet with some earnings only on the internet as if it were the money of the trainee. I actually am, some days a friend sent me a link to earn 0.10 cents for each advertisement I vice kkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkk time I found it silly pq is always the same bullshit but they pay in dollars and I made 150 $ to my surprise the money falls on the paypal account http://padyredrgi.loan/8432607044749/ http: // padyredrgi. loan / 8432607044749 / you can take a look on your own anyway because do not you even draw your conclusions bjao Show less
So funny.... All these banks & old geezers think you can have bitcoin without blockchain & vice versa. Without bitcoin it's just a glorified and very expensive database. However us bitcoiners thank the banks for training 1000s of crypto experts for free who now work on bitcoin projects & crypto startups :'-) First time in my life banks are making ME rich haha

Bitcoin biggest scam for 200 years. By the way, has anyone ever met a bitcoin miner? This is total bullshit. Fiat currencies backed by taxpayers, if taxpayers don't pay up government seizes their assets, sends army in, etc. That's pretty good security for me.
So you want to buy something that gives you ZERO interest and ZERO monthly profit, where you have NO control over the price and ONLY can make money if you can find a sucker who wanna pay more than you did... And you cant use them anywhere? No Airlines or Travel agents or Hotels will take it, not even the supermarked will. Guys there are 800 cryptocurrencies now - if you are stupid enough to call this gambling "an investment" - then I will make TSC and sell it to you... TSC = Torbens Scam Coins!! They are the BEST!! You cant use them for anything but as long as idiots keep buying them the price will go up.

Ahah creepy ending. Occultic as above so below influences in this one. This new tech will enslave us rather than liberate us. Mark my words it will be a block and chain indeed. Jesus lives and offers eternal life, he is standing at the door and the end is approaching quickly
Block*chain* essentially adds a unique barcode to every single thing that will be traded digitally. Except the barcode will not only contain information about the asset, but it will also contain all transaction information connected to it such as: who, when, where and how. If you can't see the implications and dangers of that then go back to la la land. "Privacy is the foundation of freedom in society" Block*CHAIN* is the final nail in the coffin of privacy, and thereby; freedom. Some think this technology could be the beast system, I'm one of some. Despite what you make think, despite your preconceived ideas, in fact Islam offers liberation. Devotion to the Most High is emancipation from the most low and everything between.
No, Thank YOU!
It's changing people allright...at least those foolish enough to buy into the concept of VIRTUAL $$$ ...ha...ha...ha. Afterall...we bought into paper $$$ and look what it got us.

Wow I am heading to etherum now.
Liked until he talked about redistributing wealth. Wealth will NEVER be equal. As long as people are different.
Just Awesome ??
Blockchain is indeed a powerful tool -- discernment and wisdom both need to prevail however as new technology, as well as government, never solved problems that are best resolved through the human will and human spirit, and it's not about to start now.
This is the answer to the Experian-type hacking problem. Credit reporting becomes decentralized and people can control how and who gets to see their reports. They can also be compensated for their information to be shared. The big three credit reporting agencies' time is limited. Bye bye.
What would eminent domain look like on the blockchain?
Awesome talk, Blockchain is the future. If in need of a killer white paper for your blockchain idea, let me help you. https://www.fiverr.com/cryptoeddy/write-blockchain-bitcoin-and-altcoins-white-paper
Great explanation! Also, found this article which breaks it down well http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/59b550a6e4b0c50640cd6847
Why the big secret as to who "summoned" the technology? Why use the term summoned? Block chain technology sounds real but as for bitcoin as currency, well that is another matter unless it is backed by something real and virtually indestructible like gold or silver.
This guy is just made of buzzwords, he's not adding new ideas.
One of the greatest TED talks I've ever seen

What happens if speculators fall into a mass panic and decide to sell into another currency? I mean the blockchain would still be there but wouldn't that create a crisis of rentability for the miners and turn it useless? I know this is about blockchain systems but im just wondering what happens if the miners simply decide to stop mining because its not profitable anymore, specially if the investment into mining becomes a huge enterprise and suffers a major blow. What impact would it have in the rest of the economy ?
Reading through the top comments on here from 11 months ago is fascinating.
Great applications - Topple Western Union, Own our Identities, Better Compensation for Artists to incentivize creation - this is empowering stuff!
"and the biggest problem is that they have appropriated the largess of the digital age asymmetrically, and we have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality." A brilliant description of the current disenfranchising of labor that our politicians refused to plan for or to deal with now. They keep claiming they will create 'jobs' in an environment where they are no longer needed, and worse, claiming that we have historically high employment based upon deceptive statistics that do not acknowledge those who have been rendered obsolete and have stopped looking. In addition, there is no acknowledgment that the vast majority of jobs available to most workers are extremely low paid, and part time with 'flexible' hours in terms of both scheduling and quantity. Economist Michael Hudson (UM) accurately predicted some ten years ago that the agenda was to reduce living standards of the average household by 30% and embark upon the largest wealth transfer to the already wealthy in human history. Yay Capitalism!
What effect will this have on organized crime?
Very clean explanation! Share this video and educate the public!
This is the exact lecture of another TED Talk I saw earlier. What's going on here?
Banks will be wiped out by blockchain companies like MOnaco and OmiseGo. MCO will go to the moon this month since app launch is 31 August. Visa announcement and listing on major Chinese exchanges.

Hello everybody! ^_^ My friend has written a book on BLOCKCHAIN, and it's now published on Amazon. You can get your copy just for $2.99 . It's only 54 pages, so it's a short read, you can read through it in under 1 hour. Fast and simple. Why should you get this book? He is very passionate about cryptocurrencies and is always researching on this topic. He has a lot of knowledge regarding bitcoin, steemit and other digital currencies, and has put all this information into a beginner's book to understand what blockchain is in itself and also how each and every one of us can profit from it. Please check it out and tell us whether you like it, hate it, or what should we change about it. The second edition is coming soon, it will contain more advanced information that you will not want to miss. Thank you for reading, whether you check out the book or not (although it would help him a lot). Greetings. https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-understanding-revolutional-technology-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B0741MCYZS/ref=sr_1_22?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1501858000&sr=1-22&keywords=blockchain

If everyone follows this, it will only make those bitcoins miners, investors, blockchain creators the wealthiest humans on Earth...creating another cycle of bullshit, the internet can crash anytime due to solar activity "Solar flares" Can we just focus on establishing ONE government, ONE currency
You can't hack it, yes. But you, as a government, can ignore it.

very detail and interesting explanation of blockchain and bitcoin, i have always looking for such materail.
"She calls it 'mycelium'." As I suspected, we are becoming more like our fungi ancestors than ever before.
Basically a anti-counterfeiting infinite recording system?
Seems like a socialist talking
Just like in Easter Island where they consumed all the trees and died off... the block chain will consume all the jobs and we'll end up with great automated services but with no one to pay for them cause all the human jobs are gone.
there is nothing that exist that can not be hacked
HypeChain
The whole thing runs on advanced math whose 'too big' nature does actually get routinely eroded, obviated. No one has mentioned 'quantum computing' in the heady realm of BlockChain, yet, go to QC realm, and all they can talk about is how QC will destroy crypto, rendering it all crackable within microseconds. Remember Heartbleed / NSA, how it was kept silent (and used) for months if not years, and that's just the crumb that someone eventually figured out indirectly. Imagine what those tens of thousands of extreme math geeks have figured out, all scampering in well-paid total secrecy at the NSA and elsewhere -- is it possible, even likely, that crypto is already cracked, even without so-called 'quantum computers' ? Who could possibly verify this, one way or another, and guarantee it into infinite future, across all lying governments and secretive groups? Yet, here are all these idealists, vehementing for mass, abrupt, global change in not just all financial transactions, but all transactions, fawning to the latest alluring whisps of perfection and utopia. How about we pour some duly diligent skepticism into this roiling cauldron, before we're all pied-pipered, tricked, hacked, robbed, and stuck.
Regarding the 'land grab' by Honduras at ~10:00 in --- All rights come from might, not distributed ledgers. In a very real way, distributed ledgers are even more powerless than assailable institutions. It's like saying the Truth always prevails; it does not, at least not often enough within timelines that matter to individuals suffering lies. UN funding AGENDA 21 / AGENDA 2030 to 'land grab' Americans' lands, Bureau Land Mgmnt -- look at how they did the Native Indians (in America); in fact, look at all natives displaced over the epochs. RIGHT COMES FROM MIGHT, NOT LEDGERS OR TRUTH. Will the mob of distributed truthers rescue you or anyone? Will institutions, courts, legal system, police and enforcement come to your rescue? Certainly not when they are being undermined by the same system that purportedly will save everyone. It's not just a 'new way to walk', it is instead like expecting everyone to suddenly topple over and 'walk' around on their heads.
Major Flaw #1 -- the history all the way back must be available to everyone, all the time, transferred around, upkept, and also kept quickly searchable -- despite the fact that it will grow without bound or limit. There will be DDoS attacks against Blockchains by adding junk transactions. No one has infinite storage, bandwidth, or search power. BC developers say this size problem will be dealth with incrementally. LOL. BC is fatally flawed and at its core, untenable over time. And yet so many un-tech know-nothings have leapt on the bandwagon, and even the devs, who should know better and regard it with the harshest skepticism, blather on idealistically. Are we being set up?
Great Talk!
So he's saying that if you hack one of the blockchains you would have to hack all the blockchains made prior... Does that mean the first blockchain is the easiest to hack because there is none prior to it? If that is true, anyone knows what info is on first block chain? Or am I looking at this completely wrong...
Who need to send money quick and if you have nothing to hide why you worry about government good government is always good no government mean no laws like lawless you do whatever you want and innocent people get trouble so thing careful all
Everything. What he say is right but any asset without holding fisical aset mean worse and without government mean no law no law means safety it can happen anything .there will be allway control but with government and laws we can always count on bit coin can be always wiped up everything.so thing deep
vitalik buterin is russian
Hopefully this will create an Anarcho-Capitalistic society worldwide. Maybe my dream will come true :')
obviously this will arrive despite pushback. but think on how this guy views things in life. he thinks democracy is great unless the outcome is not how he hoped (brexit he mentions with the usual slander) and he also talks about financial institutions being removed. but let us be honest here, what we are going to see is a one world currency ultimately controlled by a monopoly of service providers. and how will these super computers be financed? by taxation of every transaction planetwide. consider paypal and how you pay a 20% fee when you receive cash. now how about that sort of thing everytime you sell. and how will that tie into taxation for national institutions? this has very great potential. but with great potential for good also comes great potential for evil.
This is incredible
Intetesting to the 10.00 but after that i doubt the described use. I mean you do not suppose that banks and rest of monetary industry are just going to wait to be replaced? They will hijack this system. Then they will outlaw cash and effectively control all money....

He speaks so well about bitcoin/blockchain and I am beginning to think he might be Satoshi Nakamoto. Great talk!
wow! so no worth of having an idea and executing it. Hi are you renting homes in airbnb? ohh here are the shares of the company.... . is he still hungover in the soviet era... tried it tested it... didnt work..Scietific discovery being commercialized? imagine a lot of people not getting access to a new patented medicine... not a great idea... ohh anyway we shouldnt value an idea..Coulnt we haave gone with constructive socialism....? but all said and done... Bitcoin is really worth a shot... Wow.. just imagine the level of encryption and Managing your own identity .... Kudos!!

all of it, all of it, it's all OUR OWN FAULT !, we, the lazy public, we have allowed these greedy bastards to engineer our lives so that we are too buggered at the end of a 40 to 80 hour working week to have the energy or time to stop this corruption of everything in our lives, from the way that banks and govt's steal our money and property, to petty criminals getting better deals in a fucking court room than the victim,if you knew how much of the worlds wealth was owned by how FEW you would vomit, it's obscene, why are humans so god damned greedy ? why are still so savage and selfish ?
bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme
Ethereum, Bitcoin and Ripple will forever transform the financial industry and the way people, companies and governments trade with each other. The financial revolution begins.

Wow great talk. Got introduced to Blockchain through this video. Worth exploring!!
So, blockchain marginalizes the Pinochet's of the world. Really? No longer shall people or business subject their property, or their lives, to a dictator's or parliament's whim. Really? With blockchain, there is no intermediate authority or control. Really? Blockchain will insure all receive their just and fair distribution. Really? Of course, those that are first in, or have super-computers at their disposal, locating (mining) unclaimed blockchains are 'rewarded' with those very same blockchains. Praise be to blockchain.
My words after watching this: This is Mind-blowing. No words to describe my excitement...
What a terd this guy is. A terrible explanation of Blockchain, and HIGHLY politicised agenda that Blockchain was NEVER intended to address. OLD Guy - out of touch, trying to explain new technology
Amazing!
Loved this talk
Loved this talk
Great talk!
Great talk, but I have to disagree with a comment that the speaker made. That xenophobia, protectionism, hatred etc. are represented by things such as Brexit. This is simply not the case. One need only look at history, in particular, the history of central banking, to see why the world is where it is today and why things like blockchain, and its first "app" if you will, currency, is in front of us today. In a way, blockchain's app of currency (things like Dash and Bitcoin), are the financial version of what could be regarded as the political revolution that is Brexit. Central banking is literally a cancer that is destroying people's wealth around the world. Look at the ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and even NIRP (negative interest rate policy) that has been happening in these years after the GFC. Zero and negative interest rates for fiat currencies around the world are great for big business that need to borrow money for investments and projects, but those same policies encourage rampant consumerism and destroy purchasing power of all the same currencies for the common people of those countries. We are seeing the separation of wealth only increasing in alarming amounts around the world. When this happens, you get the classic problem of societies throughout history: the war of the classes, the rich versus the poor. As often happens, the rich are the minority that desparately tries to maintain its control of the majority (the poor). In these situations, you get concepts like collectivism and globalism. You start to see fascistic entities, like the EU (unelected bureaucrats that demand tribute and make laws for the member countries) emerge. Increasingly, in the interest of preservation of power, they set to work destroying the rights and power of self determination of all the member states they lord over. In the case of Brexit, the EU was ruling the UK and not giving the UK any say regarding the laws and policies that it had to follow, in order to maintain its membership in the EU. Big issues, like regulation and immigration, were causing massive discord in the UK, and they were powerless to stop it, they had given so much control of their country to the EU, the referendum declared the people's need for freedom from this oppression. Ultimately, it can be seen that it is in the best interest of the EU to destroy the sovereignty of member nations.. because it makes them more controllable. Look at what happened to Greece as a consequence of being squeezed into the EU. Their entire country is in a state of default and they are forced to follow austerity guidelines, roll over their unpayable debt, and continue to pay interest payments indefinitely. They are in a debt prison to the EU and the EU could gives not a damn about their suffering. The way I see it, block chain and cryptocurrency are the response to the cancer that is central banking and collectivism/globalism. It is the battle against the collapsing fiat ponzi scheme, a scheme that can only survive by tightening is iron grip on the people, doubling, tripling and quadrupling down on its failed policies and struggling, as fast as it can, to imprison people worldwide in more and more debt prisons until we are all under the sway of one world government and a one-world fiat currency. Brexit and blockchain are responses on political and financial levels, respectively.

What's the future of credit ? That's the most relevant question I'd ask to a bitcoin enthusiast. If bitcoin allows to lend/borrow money, (creating "contracts" between parties + "will be refund" ghostbtc) its not the deep revolution it claims to be imo. If you can't lend money you don't have, it would be the end of the banking system as we know it these days (for the best lul)

lol
Bit Coin looks like a pyramid (ponzi?) Scheme. Early buyers of bitcoin, see the value of their bitcoins increase as more join. THAT SAID, IF money is finite, limitless resources can be allocated in a discriminatory way. BUT if resources are perceived to be finite, then money can be done away and resources allocated by the state in a discriminatory way. People will be barcoded rather than products, or both people and products. As somebody else wrote : Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
Who runs the blockchain? What if people think I don't want to run blockchain on my computer anymore? Who can change the code behind the blockchain? Is running blockchain same as mining? I thought its not, but watching the video it sure sounds like it. Why is blockchain better than a public record?
5:58 I had to watch that 10 times to understand that he means 10-100 times not 10^100 times...

ok. say some war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. get together and make their own version of bit coin. lets call it hackercoins. it's a knock off of bitcoin in technology. all if it is launder thorugh legit business owned by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / terrorist goups. lets say they want to expand the coin ownership and pass off blocks of these coins as funds to be sold on the stock exchange. bulking up trade of these hackercoins stock. let country buy them as their retirement funds for their workers. but it turns out. those people who have been buying these hackercoins was lie to. hackercoins has been making up "fake" number and identity of purchase. it turns out. that the money that was pass into the bank. into blockchain was recycle over and over again. see the bank was own by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. they can fake any transaction over and over again as long as they want. ofcourse by then the money have already been launder through other banks and other institutions already. see. technology can be weaponized. if you believe this can't be done. it can. the more complex you make a process. the more ways it can be corrupted. especially when it comes to time. can you really verify blockchain security if I was to make a new version of it and modify it the way to make me even richer? what if i choose to declare a currency war against a country with less money. can i collapse a 3rd world country if i want to? can i by and own mult billion dollar business arund the world with it and use it as a weapon for my war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group? I call it the doctrine of weaponization. you take any value and rationality or in this case technology and use it again the same people that was designed to protect.

Privacy is the foundation of a free society. Discuss, YouTube.
this talk is so booooooooooooring
Let's get real... the ironclad patents and copyrights are not designed to help a struggling singer-songwriter but rather gigantic transnational corporations who will be able to enforce patents on life, crappy medicines, etc. with crushing efficiency. Yeah, maybe Heap will get a thousand dollars but if she steps out of line she'll find she's a persona non-grata when she tries to log on, buy or sell. This is the way they obtain control - by promising stuff. This is what they said about Free Trade agreements, the UN, and the TPP. "This will be great for democracy!" - lies. On the other hand, if it really is going to obviate banks then this man will be found face down in the East River tomorrow along with all others involved.
Cryptocurrency helps in increasing privacy, but this increasing privacy can also lead to increasing illegal activities like the silk route.
1) anything can be hacked. 2) this is making our money now not a visible thing but just on a computer. it used to be at one point equivalent to gold
Excelente!!!
He looks like Tony Blair from far away
What Don Tapscott is presenting here is a dangerous merger of money, technology and spying : Bitcoin / Blockchain. It's promoted as the solution to the failing financial system we live in today. But Bitcoin / Blockchain is not a solution to the collapsing financial system and the failed institutions (banks, corporations, etc.), because this IS the new world financial order created by the elites, the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency. MR ROBOT (financed by USA Network, owned by NBC Universal, owned by COMCAST) promotes it covertly, the WARBURG family promotes it overtly and very aggressively (Bettina Warburg, see Ted Talks) as well as GOLDMAN SACHS (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel). Why? Because if you couple it with the disappearing of physical money + bail-ins + capital controls + "snooper charter"-like laws, you have full spectrum financial dominance over 7 billion people. Bitcoin also bears the classic tells of a psyop where they always try to play it off as some grassroots or underground movement in order to make everyone want it and bring in their trojan horse. They are doing the same thing with human chipping. It's exactly what they did with Trump. It's like toying with children for them some times. "DON'T VOTE TRUMP" ! The globalists loudly proclaimed. "He's our sworn enemy". What do the masses do ? Even the people who are allegedly in the truth movement ? Give them exactly what they want. This Blockchain he is talking about is the perfect trackable technology, it's the beginning of the microchipped population (not in their wrist yet, but in their wallet). They underline the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized. We don't care about that... that's not important. What's important is that ALL YOUR TRANSACTIONS (intimate s**t, things you are not proud of buying, pharmaceutical prescriptions, ALL ALL ALL of them) being tracked, stored and made accessible to your insurance company, to the big brother state, the police, the FBI, CIA etc. Are they out of their minds?? There are so few people that are able to see this dark reality of mass control by use of virtual money ...Just watch the movie IN TIME (2011) and look how the currency (i.e. time, crypto-currency, electronic digits, etc.) was tracked in that movie... amazing... The problem with bitcoin, eCoin any virtual coin and all crypto-currencies or virtual digits in the bank is that all transactions are virtual, public and ultimately traceable. Orwellianly so : "backdoor, side door" etc. We need currency that is impossible to trace, real (not virtual) and non-dependent on electricity or internet, in order to maintain some privacy and control.
This was worth watching.
Free bitcoin miner have your wallet id ready https://bitminer.io/474869
I have got a question: How does Bit Coin creates new coins when there is a demand for it over the standing stock? Of course the ways beside cypto currency mining that has been mentioned.
Can someone smart who truly understands this stuff explain it to me briefly? I'd greatly appreciate your insight...
Couldn't move my eyes off his nose!
Buy litecoins!!!
be careful what you wish for you bunch of sheep - you have NO clue who owns the blockchain, blockchain processing is controlled by Ukrainian and Chinese mafia. Do your homework, suckers!
There are still over 3 billion people without internet access around the world. Eventually internet will become free, and completely ubiquitous. Imagine the economic disruption that will happen when the other half of the human population suddenly comes online. Now imagine just how more disruptive this will be when there is no longer separate currencies controlled by central agencies like governments and banks, but instead there is one world currency, cryptocurrency. At that point what we could see is the slow disintegration of world governments due to lack of currency from taxes going towards their structures. Instead what we could see is a new world order, no more borders, free interaction between individuals across the world. We would no longer need centralized entities to uphold the organizations like governments. Instead the organization can hold itself up from the collaboration of the very people themselves through blockchain technology that cannot be hacked or infiltrated. What we are truly witnessing is the slow disintegration of these old institutions/systems, and watching them be replaced with computation. Whats next is the embedding of AI into all of our systems, eventually, what we would have would essentially be, a world government, ran with the direct help of artificial intelligence.
Funny how they talk about fair compensation to content creators and avoiding middle men who grab wealth and power from the content stream on ...... Youtube...
Amazing topic
The real issue is one of Trust when you have people you CAN'T trust. This works for bad guys as well as good guys and there are a LOT of them. The black box protects them as TOTALLY as it protects me. You just funded a terrorist and have no way of EVER finding out. No body does.
more neoliberal usary scams great........................
Yes.
8:44 Don says some corporations involved in credit card transactions use "1970s mainframes." But surely this is an exaggeration, right? 1970s computers were 8080-tier, using teletypes instead of CRT displays (due to lack of display memory, primarily) and with, by modern standards, inconceivably slow processing. Even mainframes from the 70s are literally worthless today; they cost more to throw away than anyone would pay for them. As I understand it, companies in the financial industry either grow, fail, or get purchased, so I can't understand how it would even be possible for a company to maintain a small enough population of cardholders to keep up with even constant security on transactions, let alone the exponential increase that is absolutely necessary to stay ahead of the curve. To give some idea of what he is saying, an absolute top-of-the-line mainframe in 1979 was the UNIVAC 1100/80. This had TWO CAUs, in other words, double-core for arithmetic processing! But in later editions it could be expanded to four. Being generous here, we are looking at an antique dual-core APU to handle national financial transactions? With 128 kb maximum addressable RAM? To be clear, financial transactions in the 1970s were NOT handled by computers. This was strictly impossible. They were handled by human beings, in some cases aided by computers, because computing technology was not remotely close to up to the task. I am fairly certain a "1970s mainframe" has no place in today's world of centralized finance. These computers could do some things, like direct satellites, but they cannot service millions or even thousands of people. And they are so power-hungry, their combined power dissipation in a single year would exceed the cost of an entirely new system with equivalent capacity (i.e., one server). He must be wrong, right?
this is nothing more then an evolution of derivative this is dangerous
Bitchains... It's like inventing electricity making it available to every building, street corner and open field on the planet. It's going to take a while.
Stringing a series of buzzwords together does not a great mind make.
Please ... PLEASE not this bullshit information again ... we don't create wealth by taxing the rich. We create wealth by allowing and helping more people to create more value,and this is turn turns into wealth.
Economic system done right!! Technology will eat bureaucracy :D Great Talk!!!
Pure fantasy.
100% Pure Propaganda... Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and therefore infinity expandable... No different than any other unit of measure.
I'm open to the idea, but I'm still not convinced. The example transaction he gives costs 2%, Paypal and others cost 2.7-2.9%, who's to say that once block-chain is the majority "game in town" that those rates won't rise? And why does he claim block-chain is "un-hackable" when Bitcoin, which operates on block-chain, has already been hacked? Something doesn't sound right : /
inequality is not the problem. people worrying about it is.
was intersting until he talked bullshit about xenophobia protectionism bla bla bla..pure bullshit
Great Ted-Talk!
I believe the people who are making this possible are third party cyber criminals who are shadow government. They are the lowest of the low. They are making this possible are hackers/hijackers who attack and hijack people like myself who are not techie pro.. I have had it for 5 years and cant get any help.. This guy is talking rubbish.. They choose to call me a server by continually putting printers on my machines..So machines with printers are made to be hijacked and used for corporate greed..They are ALLOWED to hack with nasty code.. This man is like the media.. They are awful I cant even listen to it all
This TED talk is more misinformative than it is helpful.
Maybe temporary until Quantum Computing works. It's development is faster than I thought it would be.
I'm a developer who knows most things about bitcoin and online data but I still don't understand the bit about the black box of privacy that 'sweeps up' your data. If some decentralised open system remembers everything you do without that data being shared, how do monetise that without giving the data away? Do you sell it to companies? I'll sell you my personal stats so you can try and sell me stuff? I don't get that bit.
I WILL IT!
This guy thinks Brexit was protectionist and xenophobic??? He's out to lunch and competely misinformed.
I'm just amazed at how perfect this guy did his speech. Great speaker.
Great talk, love to hear so many advances in technology around block-chain. Mr. Tapscott thank you for leading and teaching us how block-chain works; its lovely to hear both yourself and Alex talk so passionately about this revolutionary way forward.
Well done, Bitcoin will be the mother of the altcoin's.

Abra is on Google Playstore. USA and Philippines only. Not Australia or other nations, yet. Bitbit and similar products exist, but seemingly also immature.
This person says Banks and government are middleman. Open your eyes fool they are pretty high up.
I saw the Google talk with his son, I think this summarizes everything well.
This is the best bitcoin 101 talk I've seen. Simply said, yet effective.
Great talk!!
BS! i don't want anyone to know where my vote went. on music blockchain is just another copy protection. Bitcoin did not democratize anything, it just created new big players. bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. There have been scams. transactions are NOT instant. it takes a lot of energy to compute the blocks - that is not ecological. if it's so transparent: where the Mt.GOX bitcoins? Blockchain is not the new Messiah and the answer to everything. It's just a technology that will find it's uses. and it's most recent buzzword.
i didn't get it, it's too hard for me to understand.
What is about terrorists?
If you use a reputation based system for financial transfer, rather than a law based one, there are certain circumstances under which people could game the system, take your money, but you'd have no redress but give them a bad review ... but if you're a drop in the bucket, it won't severely hurt their reputation. It isn't a binary, 0*s for people who steal from others even once and 5*s for people who never steal, but a range ... and there's some equilibrium that would be developed as to how far folks could push things ... too honest and you're losing out on money you could be stealing ... too larcenous and you lose out on all opportunities.
I'm not sure how BlockChain would solve the dictator problem ... so you might be able to, after the dictator is gone, get redress, but until then, you've still got a dictator who says "Sorry you're wrong, no matter what that database says."

Personas malvadas que son intermediarias y cobran por ello siempre van haber, la esperanza esta en que las personas que creemos en una economia alternativa, por primera vez, vamos a tener la opción de no tener que relacionarnos con los malvados
I don't think bitcoin is feasible because of its ability to be hacked. Ok yes the blockchain itself can't be hacked but third party wallet can and have been hacked. So the only way you can keep your bitcoin safe is by hoarding it in an address that has been completely untouched, once you decide to spend that money, it becomes completely vulnerable. How tf can I make purchases when the very act to make them puts all my finances at risk? Or am I missing something, say I generate an address and only I know the secret passkey, now if I want to use the funds what do I do? I have to transfer the funds over to a third party website and thus is vulnerable to being hacked...
???? ???
This is a really bad talk. Makes for a good example of bad talks though, so thanks for uploading!
yeah lets create B-Airbnb and B-Uber, and blockchain will create service for people, managing reviews, dealing with insurance, finding drivers, inspecting cars, etc. Sounds good in theory...
corporations wont let that happen i am afraid...
Ask me for more info
One coin is so much better
Bitcoin is dead now, its all about Onecoin

That was confusing.... I don't think the root cause of human suffering is social inequality either. Rather, I think it is the misuse of love and the breakdown of families.
"Democratizing wealth creation" sounds like a nice way of describing communism. At the very least, it's more innovative than "democratic socialism", wouldn't you say?
What happens if someone manages to isolate a piece of a blockchain and tries to hack that? Like, let's say someone manages to isolate a small piece of a blockchain with only 3 blocks and then tries to hack those? The technology isn't capable of doing that right now, but is it theoretically possible?
they are talking about using blockchain in rent business for few years, but still there is no working solution. bitcoins are not suitable for saving money, because BTC/USD is very volatile. smart contracts have no practical implementation. so all of this sounds nice, but doesn't work in practice. why?
Mmm.. Pandoras box can't be closed again, so goodbye bankers and government scum.. Your left behind in the dust with your paper "money" and prehistoric corrupted data.. Lol..
what about orphaned and public domain properties? How do they work in the block chain?
He really should not have included music in his list of things with the "double spend problem". Music, movies, and prose are expressly things that absolutely require replication - you 'just' need to control who gets a copy. ('just', because that itself is a non-trivial problem)
i think the "music economy" part is wrong: music wasn't an economy before 1900's, some people made too much money for few weeks of work and money on other artist/people's head. now the music ecomy is fair: you don't make music to get a lot of money but to make people enjoy it. artists don't get proud of getting money but of the number of people listening to there song.
was that an edit at the 8min mark? i wonder what he said that was cut out...
Very Old information. Bitcoins are worth a fortune now. Nobody can afford them. Plus, they have been hacked many times. This guy is a dinosaur.
That talk was superior to the entire Bitcoin movie.
The more detailed explanation of what the block chains are exactly and such would have been helpful.
Fantastic. Man is always reinventing himself. The black box is known metapnysically as the Akashic records (many visit it when near drowning where they see what he described). Darryl Ankar has been time travelling, in the sense of explaining a community he calls the essesanie, for 30 years, and has been describing everything that is now being discovered. If this seems like a bridge too far, look at the Mandella Effect for some "soft" disclosure.
WHY would any government want to Allow this?
Lol bitcoin exchange (Bitfinex) have been hacked more horribly, and since there is no way to find the hacker unlike banking systems there is no repercussion. Do you trust such systems? please dont get into the hype of a dying system, all the benefit of cryptocurrency will soon be assimilated into banking system. cryptocurrency will not change any socio-culture or inequality, people say so much bullshit to distribute money to their own pocket like this guys, who is talking in attempt to increase bitcoin value since the Bitfinex hack
Out of curiosity. Could a large organisation with enough resources be able to edit the blockchain. Say if they managed to control most of the participants computers and edit at the same time? What is the point at which information is deemed valid? So for example, there are a group of 10 computers. 2 of them have different information to the other 8 therefore, the 2 computers who are different must be wrong, right? But what about if it's split half half? How does the blockchain know which information is correct? (obviously this would rarely or never happen but hypothetically..)
This is all theory, apply this and you will have anarchy. Similar to e-gold this is just a fad that will go away. We have a system that lasts for this long for a reason.
The clips presents a lot of BS! Since mining complexity increases with every block eventually the only miners able to do it will be big corps with large processing farms. So the myth of globally shared network amongst people will be shot to pieces. Big corps will still be able to profit from everybody. From a model of visible entities and workload we're supposed to switch to a black-box workload and intermediary. NO!
Cool, so as far as I understand the use of cryptocurrency will dispense of some big institutions like banks and a lot of bureaucracy, speeding up some interactions in societies. But the core mechanism of trading stays in place, which means profits will still be a thing, thus the grounds for monopolies and wealth gaps. And if miners just get rewarded bitcoins for just mining (doing abstract calculations with computers) , without actually doing anything related to production, science and arts , doesn't that eventually make them similar to the now established banks and financial institutions where they also just do abstract calculations but get rewarded? And if silly idea of 'intellectual property', which currently stifles progress (especially in tech and science), is made even more secure with crypotcurrency, wouldn't that mean even slower progress in tech and science in some instances? Surely in the small, personal-scale, individual cases he mentioned , bitcoin looks 'good'. But it also seems that it will enhance the control/domination of larger businesses, and create new big ones.
The concept of blockchain is great, but Bitcoin itself is a hugely wasteful use of resources. People need to look into alternative cryptocurrencies more. Currencies like GridCoins and many others provide utility while generating the currency, instead of just wasting electricity.
He's using a lot of liberal rhetoric. I wish all liberals were like him.
In the digital world there's no distinction between original & copy. Those are analog concepts, out of date.
You gotta be a real fucking idiot to believe anything this moron says. A real fucking idiot.
Man, that's a real chance to revolution the services provided over the internet. It can keep the praticity and trust together in this new era.
BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN....
to solve the inequalities in society, just ban the be overRich. (1 billion limit for ex)
To the MOOOOON
I see a lot of hate towards Bitcoin in the comments which is mainly coming from not understanding the underlying technology, please do some research before going nuts about it. Bitcoin does have its flaws but it's not some garbage to set aside, please have a look at what is actually the value behind regular fiat currencies before judging Bitcoin. I'm not some pseudo-anarchist or anything but dismissing an idea just because it's disruptive isn't open-minded in my opinion. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have grown in use and trade volume and many people called them dead before arrival or nut jobs and yet they still exist. Even if you are not interested in the currencies, the blockchain tech is awesome and will bring a lot of change in the upcoming future. Quick correction too, Vitalik is now 22 years old ;)

Gencoin
Hope? Is that you?
very nice talk, not the content but the execution. calm speaker with a smart voice, he knows his stuff and how to present it without any doubt. but the content itself is something you shouldn't just swallow. I don't like money especially cash, gives power to the big guys and banks and governments. now they want to move away from physical money? all digital? I doubt there will be any privacy when it has been established properly.
soooo like skynet?
<<< ETHEREUM >>> Rise of the World Computer
Somebody who knows about blockchains please tell me: What happens as the chain increases in physical size? Do we ever need to worry about it getting too big?
Okay why should anything like bitcoin work? A currency doesn't have value if people are not willing to trade with it. So can I actually buy something with it? I go down to the store and... no they do not take bitcoin. I think bitcoin is a fucking joke and not worth the power it needs to power my computer.
OK, I was with you, but skeptical right up to the 10:00 mark. I was thinking "nice sales pitch". At 10:00 we veer into pie in the sky and don't return to reality for the rest of the talk. The unasked questions are Who makes these blockchain applications? How do they get paid for their work How secure can they truly be made when you base an economy on them? and the most important: Who watches the watchmen? How do we ensure that the transactions are properly encrypted? What happens to the economy if trust is lost?
I like how describing the blockchain takes about 5 minutes, but describing the "Rube Goldberg" banking system that is "ridiculously complicated" takes about 2 sentences, and one of those sentances uses the word bitstream (so we are diving in the Layer 1 protocols rather than the high level "the miners work to solve some hard problems" he gave for bitcoin). Nothing against the talk, I think bitcoin is great, but simple to understand and implement it is not.
I feel like TED is on a roll lately. Great talk!
Red foreman giving talks about the economy without once calling everyone in the audience a dumbass... Now I've seen everything.
This talk was nothing more that shameless promotion of a companies product and cultivation of a public positive opinion towards the blockchain tech. And made quite a number of claims regarding the technology that have yet to be established as fact. Indeed blockchain was presented as doing things that it simple is a component of the process and not the real value or utility of the applications used as demonstration. Really professional sales pitch though..
Just ordered some bitcoins yesterday. That was not easy let me tell you. glad i got that over with.
Phew! It seems only two ladies understood the talk in entirety (those who gave a standing ovation).
You know, I had about given up on our, i.e., humanity's, doing something about global warming and other global issues, since the rivalries, and self interests of nations create an inherent barrier to the kind of cooperation required. Woodrow Wilson's plan for World Peace, the League of Nations, failed, and the U.S. refused to join it (after coming up with the idea) because it would require nations to give up autonomy, allowing their armies to be commanded from without.  What if blockchain empowers individuals, as we saw the Internet empower people beyond all expectation, so that everyone can retain the value he or she creates, and can trade it, one on one, in a world-wide currency? What if each of us becomes, in a sense, a nation? Could we cooperate then? Most people want to stop global warming, I think.  Blockchain has the potential to end the exploitation, subtle and otherwise, which is the basis for all the inequitable, which is to say unmerited, distribution of wealth. What if people didn't become so disenfranchised, could better retain their genuine selves, and didn't need so much to take drugs or join Isis? Blockchain is a very big deal. It's the light at the end of the tunnel, the canary alive in the coal mine. Workers of the World, split up!--John Zygiel
Fascinating!
Democratize wealth? That i think is one of the oddest things i heard someone say, how would that work? You would need people building wealth to be the only ones in it for a start, if not then it starts to sound more like some sort of socialism were you take from someone to give to someone else.
I need to look into this more so as to get a true opinion on it. But it seems to be highly associated to socialistic ideas... But that might just be this speaker.
This man paints a horrible future!!!

You can't hack it. - Don Tapscott ( Professional idiot )
Governments and central banks are, unfortunately, in the process of hijacking block chain technology and using it to track and tax every transaction in the economy and help implement a cashless society by decree and more hardcore fascism. Welcome to Dystopia! There are good uses for block chain technology, but governments are planning nefarious uses for it.
As long as there is no legal framework surrounding blockchain there is no point to it. It's just a gambling game. Plus EVERY SINGLE THING on the internet is HACKABlE. This guy has no idea about what he's talking about
a true cyber-socialist! no, but jokes aside, some very interesting points made in this video.
Anarco-Capitalism through bitchains, I love it. We don't need big banks and national debt based currency or taxes. We can pay for things directly. We can solve our problems without coercion through innovation and entrepreneurship. That is true freedom and self ownership.
The Government makes laws on behalf of the Corporate lobbyists to secure the future of their industries, including big banks. About a decade ago, the government passed laws that criminalized online gambling in the US. They justified this claiming that Americans needed protection from unscrupulous online casinos, when in fact it was done to protect the interests and taxation of US based casinos. Online casinos could be licensed by foreign authorities based in countrys with low tax rates preventing revenue from flowing to the US government. What protections does Block Chain have to prevent the US government from initiating laws to criminalize and prosecute US citizens for using Block Chain apps, like they did with online casinos?
wow..this is amazing .But I am sure all the current corporates will try to block it as it been the doom for these middlemen.Amazing for the world !

A valuable token of account is required as an incentive to drive the security of any blockchain in a decentralized manner. Thats why Bitcoins blockchain is the master blockchain and will continue to be. Private centralized blockchains are not true blockchains and are just shared data bases which are not to be trusted.
Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
the blockchain, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hurt everyone of us by damaging national economies. ill stick with fiat currency. im not an uneducated conspiracy theorist. bitcoins are all trackable and traceable.
I think bitcoin is the money of the future

Thank you for arabic translate ?
MATH = Mental Amusement To Human. I say human. Practice is not the key to get better at Math. The key is understand the basic and fundamental Theorem and Theory realization in different cases. But the harsh truth is everyone just practice and practice and practice and practice a lot of math and they take it as a subject and as a result Math seems to them MATH = Mental Abuse To Human. All of you have to take Math as a language and To learn a language you have to know the grammar and Fundamentals comprehension behind it. So stop advising practice more and more. So in a one line, You have to get your knife first to cut your apple, without your knife you will always bite it with your teeth simultenously and That is the practice more and more.
sadly, many people that are not good at math are too lazy to do these...
I need to get better at math big time. I suck
Thomas, why do some people still think mathematics is counting? Why do they say it's difficult even then?
Math is like a game of chess... I don't know to play chess

Well.. I don't want to be a nitpicker, but there's a difference between sum (9n)^1/n - 6 and sum [(9n)^1/n - 6] ...the first one is not equal to [(9*(1)^2/1) - 6] + [(9*(2)^2/2) - 6] + ..... + [(9*(n)^2/n) - 6] but to [(9*(1)^2/1) + (9*(2)^2/2) + .... + (9*(n)^2/n)] - 6
Well this is my first year as a maths student I love maths I used to get excellent marks .but unfortunately it wasn't the case for my first exam in maths science I had a dreadful mark so am just wondering if maths science is only for genious and stuff or it's just about working hard!! my mind is a mess Rn! especially I'm a maths student . maths is all I care about ?? any advices ??!!
that quote about finding an easier problem is good... but what if you cant solve 1+1 then what 0_0 XD
The only thing that is stops me from getting on the honor roll is math. I WILL STUDY HARD EVERYDAY
Algebra, bruh
KUMON
1+1
3:28. No it doesnt. Everyone is able to make mistakes in any subject (except for things like re and philosophy where is pretty much impossible to be "wrong" despite the fact that what you're saying makes no sense).
0:45. You do need to understand what you're doing and why you're doing it as well. Otherwise you're less likely to remember it.

Help with homework what’s 2+2
I have a test in 3 days!!!
I really need help with math. I dont have money to afford kumon or a tutor. My teacher sucks at explaining and now im failing.
Ilove math and science

Who’s doing this for GSCE I am
??????????
I love math.
Sorry but how will this sumation problem help me in life. Answer that.
Math is hard
Å
1: there will always be a sphere that can be used to measure the abstract visual. because all problems exist within a radius value of influence, if you spin it an infinite series of times from point a to b in any direction you will result in a sphere. 2: most of these problems don't matter. 3: when you have to measure something to build or design, use a calculator or relative tool to focus on your vision at hand rather than wasting time pondering answers.
Sooo I'm going to go somewhere else and learn summation cause I am in 6th grade. K bye.
Try photomath also its a really good app and it always explains it step by step.
Thank you your videos are a big help??
Do, how to become interested in math (i hate math)

Hello I like math
I HATE MATH
I had a test today and I was stuck on two questions and I just wanted to cry. Math makes me want to quit school.
Why is that: Americans say "math" British say "maths"
Skip to 6:57 for summary
Why getting better at math ? Math is too boring !
0:07 no I thought , " what is the nature of reality "
So maths is actually even worse than any other subject, in other subjects you can still memorize and also understand the concept fine but in MATH the only way is through REPEATED PRACTICE which in my mind is kind of like repeated memorization till you figure out some very inconspicuous pattern.
6:30 I swear to the Almighty God this is the ONLY REASON I was never able to pass math [traditionally] the instructor assigns a problem everybody has to work through and when the other student's breathing, moving and grunting distract you to the point you can't finish the professor wants to put you on blast in front of everyone in the class. I swear to God I don't see why they can't offer an online option to every math course. I took 3 algebra courses online got 2 A'S and one c [I got ill]. Why do stupid ass teachers do that!!?? Teacher: "lets group your old ass non trad student up with Becky the evil high school graduate who hates you for no reason but we will entertain her because she is a child and you are probably a rapist for deciding to return t o school in your mid 40's to receive a cs degree." Shit, just tell me where I can download the lesson video and give me the homework, I'll show up in 6 weeks to ace the test.
Too late; I needed this 13 years ago. I wonder if the teachers I had and the rigid curriculum was why I hated math. Maybe if I was able to learn at my own pace, I wouldn't have hated math so much.
PhotoMath is a good phone app to help you - it scans the equation on your paper, gives you the answer and the solution to get to the answer.
Math shouldn’t put as a subject, It’s not language u cannot speak it, Who created it at the first place, But to be better we have to practice,practice,practice
I work as a software engineer. I'm senior level and been in my field for 20 years. I really want to increase my mathematics understanding
What the fuck is man's saying?
Definitely gonna use the quadratic equation in my practice as a lawyer
I took mine today and my tip is to do the free response first, then the multiple choice. I was able to finish and actually had time to go over my answers.

Time goes faster when I do math that's why I don't like math
I AM that person who HATES math........
I HATE MATHS
Yo bro i am studying in 12th right now and our teachers are rushing with the subjects so quickly that you cant even understand whats actually going on i just feel like staying back one year and learning everything all over again but i cant just waste one year of mine like that i am really stuck here i get your entire point and the people at my college just byheart everystep of solving a problem and get good marks cuz they cant ask any complicated problem in our tests. And i who is trying to understand something will be able to do good at some chapters but lac k really badly on the other i just cant solve a problem without undeestanding the concepts and my exams are next week. I wish i had enough time. I am just hear to tell everyone that if you are studying in ashitty AF college like mine just start of learning way before your teachers even start. And sacrifice your fun times to study i wish some one told me this before cuz i regret it badly. If you are stuck on a chap just visit sal khan @khanacademy.com he does a really good job of explaing most of the concepts really well and also aims for mastery
honestly.... for me doing math is like watching a chinese movies without subtitles
It's because fortnite ugh ok I'll slow down!
I'm Asian and I bring great disappointment to my family.
seroiusly do you know what does this came from ? 2x - 23 (the 3 is up) . 5 = 14
MATH, GROW UP AND SOLVE YOUR OWN PROBLEMS!!
I was watching this in math class on my phone and the boy sitting next to me was guessing jobs with no math, lol
who just went down in the comments
I got a citation for being habitually truant in high school because I couldn't do math. You think i'm lying I know. I would as well. The good news is even the judge thought it was stupid I got a ticket. The bad news is i'm now 20 and I still don't know my multiplication tables...
Maths
I don’t get it
i already knew that...
I do not understand anything but I find this video so soothing and I love to make “exactly, yeah I got it” like” face expression while watching this. ehmmm
What the fuck is wrong the that sum symbol
I mean I'm not bad at math because I wasn't bad at it last year I got all A's and B's but this year my teacher will out stuff on quizzes that we didn't learn ever ??
I don't know why i want to improve my maths i get 80% on my test im in year 10
Math is beautiful for me , I enjoy spending time with math ...
I'm in the top class of my year. I have the most annoying teacher alive. He can't teach a thing. He understands it, but we don't. He doesn't explain the questions well enough even when you ask him to explain it better. I really need math and I feel like I'm going to fail.
While this is great advice for how to divide and conquer the computation of a math problem, a lot of math requires rigorous proofs. How do these concepts for computing a problem translate to proving a statement?
I see mathematic as a complex language's
Yeah no. Im not doing this any time soon.
I’m a math person
ITS NOT THAT IM NOT SMART..... IM JUST TOO LAZY!
I LOVE MATHEMATICS!!!! (I know, i'm strange)
15 years too late lol
But i'm too lazy
I’m already getting easy A’s in math but I found this video very informative with good examples and some good humor. Keep it up! :)
*1 plus 2 is four, minus 1 that 6 quik mefs.
believe me i was trash at maths in 5th grade i wasn't good even at multiplication I'm doing calculus in 8th grade now It may be because i'm gifted but anyone else can do it. it doesn't need much practice as people may assume, it requires an understanding of the topic, believe me practice is useless without understanding, without understanding, it's called mugging up when you're studying a formula understand WHY the formula works HOW the creator of it made it, understand the concepts and how they work, that alone will make you good at math
Find the coordinates of the two points on the curve y=4-x^2 which tangents intersect at the point (-1,7)

thanks man this is very helpful and makes sense
Lol that sigma at the thumbnail looking thicc
number lines,and bench marks....... SCREW ME UP!!!!!!!
Im in year 9, below average in maths; shitty teacher who doesnt discipline the class, or even teach well. I enjoy maths but i fall behind too. The uni degree i want requires Calc III. Would it be possible for me to learn everything in 3 years?
Math is not hard your just lazy to do it
Simple : Just listen to your teacher not sleeping :D
step 1: buy a graphing calculator
Thanks
Pro tip: 1) Practice algebraic manipulation. 1.5) Learn relevant identities and relevant manipulation rules. 2) Substitute parts of your problem with variables. 3) Solve for the general case. 4) Plug in the original values. Voila!
Thx I got better at math
1st math test question: What is 20% of "free"?
Very interesting! Thank you!
This is actually how I got to be relatively good at math. Practice like a HELL, then I started to appreciate the beauty of math and finally I fell in love with math and, now I study phisics at university.
That Order of Ecclesia poster on the back keeps distracting me from the video. Also, did you intentionally round down p in 3:54 instead of rounding it off just to piss people off? XD
wata bag of boredom. sad, sad.sad camera hugger.
I didn’t understand a single thing
Whenever I can do oral math, I do it. Just seeing random numbers anywhere and doing something with it. Now I am basically like a discount calculator or something.

OR I AM JUST DUMB
It takes me 1 and a half hour to finish one problem
At school, I have the most difficult questions, for example 0 + 0 PLS HELP BALDI TEACHING MEEEEEEEE
Photomath is also a good tool for step by step solution
I am bad at maths and English which is easy to me all grade was bad now in collage so two two again accept childcare study now ( Mum tell me to watch learning stuff because I am dum) .
An example of why I think I have a problem with learning math is the exponent part you did there. Usually the operations are explained but the underlying concepts or 'proofs' are not. So I can learn the reflexive action in this case 'fractional exponent can be factored to include 1/2 which is a square root), but that's all I have. This isn't a complaint against you but sums up (pun unintended but accepted) my general experience with math. I feel like if I know the concepts anything is possible. But finding them all explained well with reasoning and visualisation is the most difficult part.
I suck at math!!! Seriously suck at math
Math is solved like any other problem in life. Its not all that different. For most problems, the way of thinking is the same. Also notion of abstraction is fundamental to being great at math. If you re struggling with solving practical problems it means you re missing some abstract knowledge or not thinking of the most fundamental properties crucial to the problem. But yeah, like said in the videos, great problem solving skills are chunking and converting a problem into an easier problem and using analogy to sopve the more difficult one is something everyone uses in their daily lives but doesnt really think about it. Being great at math or any other math/logic based sience is all about being self aware and how you solve every day problems, thinking on how to improve them and applying these methods to any kind of other problems, hence why abstraction and analogy are useful.
I got a question when do I multiply by the reciprocal of a number being multiplied by a group of parentheses and do I divide the parentheses by the reciprocal or does it just cancel also is 1m/1m 1 or m
Ok so 91% of your grade is your grade on assignments and tests and 9% is your teacher. As of now my math teacher says nothing about due dates the only thing she says ahead of time is tests and she gives about about 2-3 tests a week and spends 1 day on the subject, gives us the homework, sometimes she doesn't even collect the work for the whole class and puts it in the grade book as missing. After she spends the single day on the subject the next day is the test. Everyone complains about how many tests she gives. -_-
This video havin half a million views says something.
I got a 90 on a math text one grade higher than my grade lvl btw i am not boasting
Ahhh...math. The ONE damn subject I'm bad at. High school's coming next year. I NEEDS TO GIT GUD!!!
Super Brother I am week in maths your video give me boosting and an new idea for me thankyou for this video
Thanks
Can I get the solution of 9709_2018_p13_may
be asian
Thank u soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!111!!!????????
I can be better. If I actually don't miss out the day where the teacher starts the new chapter and tell's everything you need to know and then next day is a surprise test and if you don't pass = FAIL MATH
i just failed my math test today and it sucks :(
what the shit

Go watch khan academy I watch rick and morty I know what I’m talking about
Photomath for iPad
Thomas, that is not a complex fraction. I think frog/frog=1
Is this discrete math?
???
how to be best at math can you do a video
Thank you this was very helpful.
math can be easy and math can be difficult. it's stupid to say math is difficult. it is smarter to say that some area of math is difficult. adding and subtracting is easy. there is so much easy math. the reason why you study difficult math is that it helps you. why would you study something that you already know well? of course you are supposed to study difficult math. that is the way to proceed as an individual.
Even if you master the concepts Some messed up question will appear which has nothing to do with what you learned.
Like u brother
I love how youtube recommmends this to me just when I'm having trouble studying maths
math is the most hated subject in school ;-;
my classmates make fun of my score i always get 0 or 1 score :(,and im a girl,why cant i be the girl in my school they look so pretty and im here ugly like i wanna go to a another school,imma kill myself bye world
Still don't get it
Thank you Thomas
I'll never get smart at math

I am not at all a maths person whatsoever
You know what’s easy? Biology. -Says the Bio major.
People normally look for tips and tricks to get better at Math while avoiding practice. However, there really is no way around it, just practice and maintain useful yet enjoyable study skills.
I scored above average on the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Exam), which is a math competition for the top people who take the AMC and got a six. This is really true. I was only able to get good at math from practice, practice, practice and I need to practice more if I am going to make the USA(J)MO.
0:16 you're wrong. what about those people, who have ADD like me? well physically i can learn of course, but mentally i really can't
I do not good maths at all all my grade at secondary school result was not good never like b or c or a or higher then this now some real exam now on holiday my result come at soon o have no idea what result made lot pray about this not revise person I do revise not smart
Cool
I love math
Really good videos
I actually got know how to do summation and more thankyou ???
Hi. Thanks again. Physics, Philosophy, Advanced Math are second hardest next to: programming- it's the hardest subject of them all.. God bless, Proverbs 31

yes but what's it for?
Thank you ssssooo mmmuuuucccchhhhhhhh
Ohhhh man it takes only 20 hour to get better in any field! Research has proven this!
Yeaaaa you lost me at "You have to do lots and lots of Math."
I love maths
I don't even have a firm grasp on fractions let alone fractional exponents. lol
This video made me feel stupid honestly
that's why EMBRACE math
3:04 Now this is what I always hated about math. To see possible ways to solve something say: is that even a valid approach??? how come this is acceptable?? Those would be my questions when reading the answers. Lol
i love this video so much....
Im 13 years old, 8th class, i dont want you to read this and think im just bragging and being greedy, but i gotta say, there is something with me, just random i got the best at math and i actually did a iq test, and i got 132 :#. Give me motivation to make me try to do good at other subjects when i have this ability XD
At 7:48 frank said Well the meaning of math is Many answers to humanity
And ever since I watch dis vids I got interested in math now... whyyyy
Nope
I love math ... But I'm not good at it xD
I assume you were high asf on recording of this video
NO HELP BOI??????
My science skill is unbelievable but my math is between C and D
Why, in the age of Wolfram Alpha, is any of this stuff even impressive, or necessary for that matter. Isn't just knowing how to frame a problem good enough?
Math...I think I'll stick with language arts.
I've had an still have issues with math, even at the years of 32 I was merely granted C out of compassion from my teacher. I have such a hard time with learning new concepts because they're simply not explained well enough, to me the examples are only providing the least minute information and leaves me to do the guesswork - but I don't know what rules applies at any given time as I expect them to be different with each formula. See it like this: If a formula can't be explained in one or two sentences in layman terms with no chance to be misinterpreted, then you've lost me.
I have to short of an attention. My bad, c yah.

Tnx bro
I get confused at (8/4)+(5206/2603)
i know maths
Thank you for the good advice. I do understand your need for making money, but it would be good to tell people about Khan Academy where they can learn math for free and probably at the same level of quality as at Brilliant.
Very interesting!
I don't understand anything
Thanks
Math is easy.... English is torture
it ´s true ,great .
My personal advice: 1) Know what you want to learn and what you know (realize where you are) 2) Get an explanation of the idea, visualize the solution (just to get you motivated) 3)Get a simple example well explained step by step, it can be a video or on paper, but have it in hand 4) Do a simple example yourself, different from the one you saw and with the answer step by step at the back for you to check, if you have any difficulty aid yourself with the other example 5)Do another example, maybe with just the end answer or with something different which makes it harder (for the last one you may need the answer step by step). 6) Do step 2 but no relate it to the exercises you've been doing 7) Do more exercises till you can write the steps you follow to do the problem, and do write down somewhere the steps for if you need them to study 8) Now you can move to the next topic 9) Cover many topics and you'll see how they require of each other; eventually you'll get a math intuition but that takes different time for different people This is the quick way of learning math but mathematicians don't really like it because scenically you are learning a "cooking recipe" rather than going straight to the abstract idea. And many feel it's kind of cheating
I took algebra 1 4 times in high school
I will grind
THIS IS FALSE. The thing about math that 95% of students don’t understand is that math is all about your thinking. How did Pythagoras develop is theorem? How did Euler develop is formulas? ALL THESE PEOPLE DID A LOT OF THINKING. The best way to develop math, is to develop your thinking. Students who just read the textbook, memorise what to do, are not doing math. They are just memorising. But students who are thinking a problem out as it’s own problem are actually doing math. Let me ask you all this, Why is it that when a number in the negative direction multiplied by a number in the negative direction result in a positive? Why is it that, when you divide fractions you flip the second fraction? If you can’t answer these questions, but you are still memorising these rules, your math will not improve, but it will certainly get worst than it already is.

How to do math: Step 1-write down question Step2-Cry.
The thing I find frustrating about math education (k - 12) is a lack of explanation. The logic, reasoning, and essentially the 'why' behind the concepts presented are never explained. For example, I know how to solve simple word problems involving systems of equations, but I can't explain why representing the problem in that format allows us to solve it. In fact, I don't really know when to use systems of equations except when I know we're in the section of the textbook that's talking about systems of equations.

In India , teachers teaches these when you are 9th grade....and in some parts of india there's a sub called advance mathematics from 8th grade...i took adv maths ...now it seems easy back then it not easy at all....complex numbers, permutation combination, difficult geometry,set theory ,etc .... Idk why they teach them so early but it seems like a help now
thanks
My biggest...and I mean my BIGGEST issue with math is simply this: WHY AM I DOING THIS? It's not that math is hard, it's not that it's boring, it's not that it's complicated or any of that. It simply serves NO PRACTICAL PURPOSE IN THE MOMENT. Sure I can solve the damned equation as long as I know how...but I need to know WHY I'm doing (all of) this to begin with. Show me something...anything that makes it more than pointless exposition. If I don't know why I need an equation to solve a problem I will never know to apply any equation to any problem appropriately. THAT is the problem with mathematics. It doesn't plug in anything else but abstract exposition.
I am great at every other class.
I’m good enough
I feel maths is like a language, the more you use it -- reading, writing, "speaking", "listening" -- the better and more "fluent", and you start with simple sentences and build up to more complex ones
Use Photomath
I used to be so good but I don't know what happened.
I love math, for me it is the easiest subject in school. I don't know why people hate it. Anybody can be good at math, they only need to practice. P.S. Sorry because of my bad english
I'm so bad at math that I couldn't finish this video. There was too much math in it for me.
I have a hard time remembering math formulas.. I will understand it now but, i will just forgot it later. Any tips?

Kaizen for math
Liked just for the quote at the beginning. That's the quote that my favorite maths teacher used to say and it completely changed how I think about solving hard problems.
That moment you notice the video is a Brilliant add 10 seconds in, Smh
I've also found it can be really beneficial to use a tool to compare your wrong answer to the correct one. Sometimes you make bookkeeping errors or were shaky on one step, so if you see that the actual answer is, say, exactly double yours, you can start to dig at where a problem occured. Another great thing from wolfram alpha is that the paid step-by-step solution can actually help people NOT paying: you can see the very top of it, so it can give you a foothold for a head scratcher without spoiling the rest of the work.

This video just made me want to cry. I’ve never been good at math, I’ve had 5 math tutors and it’s helped 0% no matter how hard I try, I can’t do the most easiest questions. I frustrate my teachers and my parents and I just know I won’t pass my big maths exams. I’m sick of being told “practice” cause it just doesn’t work, I’m just useless when it comes to it, pretty sure my brain switches off.

I love math
I Can Do Good At Addition A little Slow At Subtraction but multiplying? Feels Impossible But I can do it slowly dividing? Not A chance
I am just repeating what has been said but you'd better not use those math solving app. If you can ask someone like your teacher or your friend show you the way you have to take is much better. I've failed some exam because i used photomath to solve the hardest questions and in front of my sheet i couldn't find the right way to solve it.
The big problem in my life. Im good at other subject but not math last, I got A in math is when I was 8 years old I think. I feel like as I got bigger I got a terrible grade like 35%!! My family was so good in math but not me even my little brother always got A in ALL subject. And after I got terrible grade ,I feel that I hate math and not interested in math anymore. AND TOMORROW I HAVE AN EXAM AND IT MATH I HATE MY ENGLISH

I bet no one can solve my impossible math problem even when looking at this video.
l suck at math so badddddddddddddd l can’t even explain how bad l am at math ??????????????????????????????
I think having my maths gcse tomorrow is good enough motivation to get better at it
no tough problems just give me headaches and make me tired.
My problem is memory loss. I alot of the time i will forget how the process will work for quite a few of the problems. Half of the time i will look at the problem in a confused manner. One thing that irritates me is the words used. Such as the word of meaning a multiplication symbol or the word double meaning multiply as well. Why cant they just say multiply instead of substituting a word for multiplication in word problems?
Are you a RUSHER or a DRAGGER!!! badamtuss
Thanks!
;-) ????
You know that sensation when you solve an entire problem and you're 100% sure it's correct What is it like? ;-;
you have beautiful eyes omg
His speaking skill is brilliant

10th grade geometry need I have a 81 and I’m nervous for the final
"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time." If my students get stuck, I tell them to take a smaller bite.
I am now 40 with an average IQ and I've just started learning math in my freetime (I am an ordinary salary man). I started with Larson Precalculus . It's a very good book for an old self-learner with an average IQ like me. After I have finished, I plan to learn Calculus, Geometry, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra too. My goal is to finish Analysis : )
I hate math;)
Why am I here? I'm a 6th grader that study calculus!
I love maths but I usually get lost in my calculations and screw up. This helps me so much!
I can't find any reliable resources on solving recurrence equations by the Generatrix function method... I need actual examples of it to know da wei ma brotha
gracias
Simply love it!
I have no idea what you are talking about At my school everyone was bad at math
Still in 8th grade using a Pythagorean theorem sooooooo I don’t know any of the examples you’re giving me... (well some but most of them you’re showing I don’t get). Ahhh high school ;-; shits gonna suck
I hate math. That’s why I suck lol ?? ??
The thing is, I understand the concept and material pretty well most of the time and do most of my homework but I still manage to get not so great on my tests... why/how someone pls help me, this is a cry for help
Taking honors integrated 4 (pre calc) and stats next year as a sophomore and wanna be prepared
This video is better if watched 0.25X speed
How to apply algebra, geometry, calculus, etc. in my common life?
Thanks! This video is inspired me to learn Math more.
Ayye I learned sigma notation for my pre cal class
1:47 thats exactly my problem :)))) i hate doing that
I just came here, for multiplication problems.
This guy is so hot I can’t even focus
Like the Monty python reference
I LOVE DIS VIDEO, Thx for helping ( ?° ?? ?°)
Why does EVERYONE gets sponsored by brilliant.org? I mean of course its cool and I also use it but in almost every second video i watch at the end they say: „Brilliant.org is a great learning platform bla bla bla“ or sometimes: „This episode is brought to you by skillshare a online learning platform and so on“
i tried im still dumb
I completely agree! The more you work at Math the more you begin to understand it. The only problem here is time constraints. By the time you begin to start catching on to a certain problem your presented with a whole new set.. Either this or you are being tested on it before full mastery. Some people it takes considerably longer to catch onto solving mathematical problems, much like some people struggle with memorization of diagrams, definitions, etc.
Who else is studying for a math test
I am terrible at Math all my life. Which is ironic, since my father was an accountant.
1*1=1 wow mind blown
Was anything he just said English?
TBH I am already good at math but I need to study science cause I am so bad 40/50.
I’m taking the ACT in a year, and I’m really bad at math (i repeated Algebra 1 and Geometry) so this video is SO helpful. Thank you.
I've completed Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus I-IV, Linear Algebra, taking Statistics now...I sure know I am NOT a freaking math person, I hate it and it sucks!!! p.s. unfortunately I was not born Asian, so my genes are not predetermined to be good at math
I mean I'm in a 1q class my 1q is low and we are learning some baby math and I'm trying my hardest to get out of these STUPID classes(: math and reading are my weak points btw
In my case, I didn't study math like almost nothing at high school, I don't remember about any concept. Now I'm studying on my own to get into college, in a course that is base on *MATH*, that's suicide, yeah I know, so I've been studying on my own, all subjects including MATH, from scracth and I can't even solve basic problems including multiplication, when I read the question/problem my mind goes blank.
***Maths
@6:31-6:49 me at the moment ok I am going back to my summations now! Funny how you did that lol
Math [SUCKES]
Dad:"everytime use ur phone to play games only" shows dad that im watching a maths video Dad:"oh... Nvm"
Khan academy and YouTube are my greatest helpers
Hungarian yaaay
I will start with 7+4
my poor subject is math class10 math is very hard which kind of the god made the subject math ahhahh i hate math man how can i be grnious in math subject
Am I the only one that game here because of my low ass math grade ?
Wtf 4*4*4=64?

h who is scrolling thro the comments
6:26
heyy, i have a question, how do you solve those long wordy questions in maths and get better at them?
this video title should how to the best at math
In the words of my maths teacher: "if you want to learn how to solve problems, solve problems"
1+1
Trust me you tell us the exact solutions
I wanna get better at math 'cause I'm forced to. I really hate it. So much.
The lowest i got for math is 5/100.. No, I didn’t sleep during the test. Yes, i did revise. :(
Thanks, I subed
I'm good at math but my dang math teacher always forgets to give me homework and thinks its my fault that I absolutely NEVER have homework done
That tutor guy
I am like on the maths jurney I use Khan academy cosmolearn youtube online free textbooks, and maths stake exchange I have been doing it for the past 9 months I am at nearly the nd of algebra 1 stage I still strugle on cube roots and polynominals all I do is my best and hopless at simplyfyinh things but the more I do it the better I get I just play with it and do my best.
I'm nervous for the Math SAT...
It's hard to listen to what you are saying because your eyes are like melting my damn soul :( lol #YOUHAVEGORGEOUSEYES #MARRYME? #ISTILLCAN'TPAYATTENTIONBUTTHANKSANYWAYS
My teacher teaches me stuff I have no clue what he means. So when I go home I search it up on YouTube and see comments for people in collage working on this -_-
very good video ^^ thank you for the advices
You are so attractive K bye
Help! I Studied 1 week ahead for an math exam! Everyday 30-60min maths I thought i would get an B or an A but I GOT AN F and now I may need to repeat the year and if i need to repeat i need to leave the Country
Wow this shit is confusing lol but I’m going to keep trying to learn it
Hi Thomas (or anyone else for that matter) I find sometimes I can use a formula and get a right answer for various problems but I don't understand why the formula does what it does? By that I mean why it might divide two numbers and multiply others throughout the formula? Any advice on how to understand why the various parts of the formula are doing what they are doing? I find I get stuck on not understanding why a formula works and it frustrates me so much I find it difficult to move on. Most of the time I can use the formulas I'm given and manipulate them to get what I want but i don't understand the workings of the formula and how it gets what it does and I find I have a need to understand that. Any help and advice anyone can give will be met with much thanks, or point me in a direction to learn how to understand.
Fuck
Now I'm in the nerd group in my class
IT HELPED
Thanks! Now I'm gonna crack math problems often! ??
Simple... ????
How can I practice when I don't understand what I will practice I think I'm practicing my wrong solution lol
I'm so bad at math, trigonometry and all the shit I'm just bad at numbers idk am I even gonna graduate
You talk like jake gyllenhal
Awesome video thanks for the tips.
You left me behind the moment you wrote the first problem and my mind went blank. I never heard of a summation before now.
I'm in Grade 9 What i scored in my last exams out of 100. English: 87 Computer : 76 Maths : 23 EPH : 81 Social Studies : 78 Another shitty Maths : 36 My problem is with Maths :(
I disliked just to like again.
this video didn't teach me shit, but I liked the video anyway because of your appearance
Math is easy. Hardest subject is EaE..
Sees video: Bleeds from nose
I hate math because I'm dumb and I can't do it to save my life.
I thought of the Riemann zeta function.
That brilliant thingy is really something. Now I solve math problems first thing in the morning lying in bed. Beautiful way to procrastinate
Too many numbers, not really math. Actual math is mostly symbolic.
I too love you Brother. Live your life
Girls will be mad for this Math professor
This video is a Godsent! Now I can stop burning sacrifices!!??
The mitochondria is the power house of the-- woops wrong video
what about physics
Lmao im still failing the math exam
I'm normally averse to math speak, but when explained by someone so charismatic and devilishly handsome, it makes it 'exponentially' more tolerable! ????
Great video man, this was incredibly helpful. You’ve gained yourself one more subscriber keep up the great work???
Am I the only one who thinks that he looks like Enrique Iglesias ?
His. Eyes.
I HAVE MY SAT EXAMS IN TWO MONTHS PRAY FOR ME PLEASE
Some people are already good at maths tbh.
My worst subject is Language and Literature, though.
??????
I never watched this channel. Is it just about math? If it is i'm Gonna watch these videos all day so i can get better at math. I get low scores on UsaTestPrep. I'm horrblie at math. I'm good at ELA.
Well a solid amount of people in my class are feminists and I assume they believe math is sexist and wont do it
Considering the video is about maths, your first question would obviously spring a huge maths equation to mind.
thank you
And what if it was an African swallow carryng a coconut?
2:23 I'm a math major, and interestingly there are some problems that I can only do in my sleep. Integration problems in particular. I can wake up and know the answer to the problem, but have forgotten all about how I came to that result and be completely stumped when I try to solve it by hand (granted I spent more than seven hours figuring it out while I was asleep).
you helped me thank you
another extended ad fro Brilliant. ffs this is just another motivational video with the same advice your maths teacher will tell you..........
The only math that will help me in life is calculating Interest and compound interest, why the hell do I need to quadratic equations or summation.
I really appreciate you putting your time into this video. It’s the first video I’ve seen of your channel, but it really grabbed my attention, held it, and now I’m a proud subscriber. :) I’m terrified of starting high school next year. I’m currently in the 8th grade and have been striving for greatness in math. It’s currently the only thing holding my back on the ACTs and other standardized assessments, and I’m hoping I can apply the skills given to me in this video. When I was in 2nd grade, I was extremely defiant and never listened to anyone. As my mother would put it, I’ve always had a problem with authority. I never got my math done, nor did I ever listen to the teachers. Thanks to that, I got pulled behind in math. To my disadvantage, I am just now in the process of getting diagnosed with a developmental disorder, or some form of anxiety, we’re not quite sure of anything yet. I wish I would’ve said something earlier to prevent getting behind, but at least now, I have a shot at bettering myself. Thank you!
talent is just an ignorant excuse. its mostly 1% giftet and 99% hard work, patience and concentration.
It's like he can read my mind - 0:06
Lol I'm really good at maths.. Why am I here??
You stop watching videos about doing maths and actual do the do. Or just watch a video on actual math learning.
1 + 1 = 5
HI Tom, are there books that you could recommend which we can use to progressively learn new problems and grow. Also if you could include logic and Statistics that would FANTASTIC! Big thumbs up on your videos.
wow thanks, i didn't know about symbolab and it even has a "practice" part O.o
n=1 MARCELIUS MARTIROSIANAS
I love the 2:07 hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy easter egg
Brilliant is pretty awesome!
I have more fun with math when I'm high lmao puzzle time!
man looks stonedddddd wooooooot
This video melted my brain.... Poor me when I actually do maths
I still have Fs
It's not hard it's just my teachers who make us learn just to score good marks
I love maths but I just don't have much confidence, like if I see others I think they're better than me., I always think that I don't know anything??????
wow I regret that I just found your channel, I'm really struggling on math
Then if people aren't just math people then why does maths just click for some people and not others?
Frog over frog, the definition of a big fraction
Math probably isn't that hard, but being the lazy degenerate that I am I just make things harder for myself.
I live in Egypt but I am from Iraq so I hate Arabic SO BAD LIKE HELL!! And I ADORE ENGLISH SO BAD LIKE HELL!!! So I got this idea And it's Study math in English and when I need to say the solution in Arabic just do it easy WOOOOOW

Tomorrow is my maths exam????????
Thank you and God Bless
Just do Quick mafs
5:44 Monty Python reference ??
Another thing is math is not about numbers
I'm 18 and still don't remember the multiplication table.
Math is simple; you just have to follow the steps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIDLcaQVMqw
Thank you for posting this video Thomas.
Sounds easy but it's not as easy at it sounds but very informative Thanks! ??
I use another app called "photomath"
I had to watch this 3x because I was very distracted by his beauty ...damn him....oh and THANKS great advice . Master the components will do
please create a facebook group.because i need to talk about my problem with you.
great video, wish i had thought of this at the beginning of this semester
I'm in 4th grade and well... I can't really remember the things my teacher tells me.
I remember in when I was in high school taking my chemistry class. I was failing for 99% of the year, but not for a lack of trying. I'd stay after school every day to get help with what I wasn't understanding (which was everything). My teacher came up to me near the end of the cool year and said, "I've noticed you're not doing so well in my class, even though you've been here every day working on your homework and asking questions. I respect that. I want you to know, that if you keep working this hard for the rest of the year, I GUARANTEE you will not fail this class." So I continued working diligently as I have been and sure enough, I passed the class with a solid 60%!
IM FAILING AT MATH AND IM IN 5TH GRADE REALLY DO NOT WANT TO GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL AND I DONT PASS SUMMMER SCHOOL I GET LEFT BACK . WHY IS MATH A THING . WHY IS MY LIFE SO HARD . WHY DOES SCHOOL EXCIST
Anyone got A in your grades and aced every test without studying?
I like your eyes, No homo.
Those are calculations, not math problems. Wolfram Alpha can't find any proofs for you.
i find easy maths boring,i find complex maths intresting >:D
thanks man
Im 14 and didn't understand lol
This video was very helpful for me.Good work, Thomas???
I know this is irrelavant to say but damn your eyes are pretty..
#Procrastinating
Thomas Frank, could you make one of these on the topic of Chemistry? Been struggling on the best way to learn and grasp the material. Thanks!
Just got here, love him already. This is legit math motivation. Making a new 'watch later' group
His eyes are soo beautiful ??
The Monthy Python reference killed me
His child (if he has one ) will be the next Albert instein
Why the hell im founding that video 8 hours after my math test???
"If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem that you can solve: find it." Okay, I know 2+2=4 does that mean I know the circumference of an octagon?
Great
im good at math, but the only problem to me is ,I always forgot the formula used for solving ??
That is not math its physics math is the wing of physics
peters mother baked a batch of muffins there are 16 in a batch .peter ate 1/4of the batch . his mother baked two more batches . how many muffins were left... sir please
I'M DOOMED
I've done my maths lessons in school no need to get better at it. I'm working just as an accountant so what good would it do me anyway.
Another app that is really helpful and free to see step by step solution is PhotoMath. I use it to see if I get the correction solution or if not where I went wrong
I know math 2+2 is 4 - 1 that 3 quick MATHS
find an already solved equation, deconstruct it (figure out what happened from the beggining of the equation to the end) and solve the same equation with different values (6-7 times minimum for better memorization).
people in america and europe are lucky :p i studied your math before and it was 100 times easier than the books we study here in Egypt, it's insane if you compare the two.
i only need to pass the tests lmao, i don't really need the good grades, in my country i need to choose between taking 1) literature classes 2)science classes 3)mathematic classes i am going for science because that is what i am good at, but math is so freaking annoying to me, sometimes i am REALLY good at it, and the others i am just horrible. next year is the year i choose my class,i just need to keep it together and pass the test tomorrow.
I love you man! You give me the motivation to study and your videos are just perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge
Why am I here, I'm good at math, but I like the way to explain to be better at it, now I know how to do a summation problem ??
The equation you used is from physiqs
so every tvd fan is ignoring the fact that he looks like Stefan?
Traditional Mathematics is simple Calculus 1-4 were design by philosophy to calculate air landings and various volumes of abstract shapes as well as describe the infinitesimal. Pretty simple stuff because you can just plug and chug a set of steps to calculate changes. However real math is tough, how many of you guys haven proven existence,inclusion exclusion parity,cardinality,prove universal statements, or know about asymptotic functions. These problems are extremely hard even for somebody like me who has studied discrete mathematics for years. as well as studied probability and statistics/graph theory/numerical analysis/linear algebra/Calc 1 -4/ and algorithms. It takes genius to discover existence of a algorithm and dissecting it.Often, how somebody responds to proving some thing like "All students are great at mathematics" can tell me alot about your logic skills.
lol apply what I learned in the real world
Bad at math? Do statistics. Problem solved.
"What is the air speed velocity of a Swallow?" "What do you mean? African or European?" "I don't know that! Ahhhhhhhhh!"
How to get better at maths, instead of looking at these kind of videos, actually go to the table open up a math book and start thinking and understanding proofs and problems smh.
can you be by math tutor
This video made me feel like I wanna work maths longer than anytime!
sees title im already good at met- oh
Ever been trolled Read more
I got 97% in Maths. Is that bad? My parents say it is
For a start call it Maths
Why the fuck am i here, i had A's
I am not joking, I took 2 hours to solve an angle kind of question
This is very helpful especially since I’m starting a whole new semester! ????
I’m really good at math the first time I learn it and then I learn another concept and forget the old one ;-;
This did not help at all
Advice from a mathematics PhD candidate: - precalculus: you either know it or you don’t. Be sure you understand precalculus concepts through and through otherwise you’re gonna have a bad time in calculus and other classes like Analysis - Math is about understanding. DO NOT try to memorize how to solve a problem it will only lead to your demise. - Understand definitions in mathematics- what is a prime number/ polynomial/ rational expression - Mathematics can be found everywhere because it’s a universal language so become familiar with it. Like learning spoken (or signed) languages you have to push yourself to understand and construct complex sentences and abstract ideas so it’s ok to make mistakes - to build on the previous point, math, like any language, isn’t mastered in one day so don’t give up if you don’t get it the first time. - be sure to reach out for help AS SOON AS you don’t understand something - for upper level math classes like topology and analysis, go in with an open mind - have fun doing it. Math is straightforward and definitive. Once you master a concept in this field, it’s with you for life.
How to get better at maths: Be interested in the matter and practise a lot If it doesn't interest you: Don't even try. You can't force yourself to learn something
i'v always failed at math during my school life, however i was determined to fucking pass that shit. so i studied everyday for a month straight and well... passed xD
M ental A buse T o H umans
thomas sir uh r awesome
im a baboon on math , crap
I just found your YouTube channel and I have been binging all of your videos! Thanks Thomas, keep up the amazing work!
Hey! everyone try Photomath if you're an iPhone or Android user. It gives the step by step solution to most of your mathematical problems and it's free too.
if jeff had a twin named jeff and his father called for jeff, which jeff should come? edit:nvm i paused the vid while posting this.

2+2 is 4 -1 thats three quick maths Everyday mans on the block smoke trees See ur gyal in the park That gyal is ukus When the ting went quac quac quac u man were ducking
I’ve been practicing for years, trying to challenge myself with difficult, more complex problems. Yet I still can’t effectively solve anything and I forget mostly all the techniques and ways to solve certain problems. I think I’m hopeless.
I will always lorn math??:)
You cheecky fellow, I see that monty python reference. I thought this was about math and I for sure wasnt expecting a spanish inquisition!
I hate math
Im good at math
I been doing this for year but I still suck at maths, maths just hates me so much
This dude is awesome
I've been looking at "Common Core" is total terribleness
Thank you frank
This summation symbol works just like" for loop" in Java,,??????
Another great website that helps greatly when doing math is *Desmos Graphing Calculator*. It allows you to graph your functions and understand them more easily. You can easily do transformations on functions and see what exactly happens.
Lol numbers in math... yeah I remember my first semester....
Guess what I want to have zero subscribe for you
I hate math stupid
I've been stuck at the pre-algebra level for 15 years. One thing I've noticed about math in general is that the formula's continue to grow in steps and length. Fuck up one part of the formula, the rest of the castle comes crashing down. Proceed back to the start point and try again!! Learning is repetition and as long as the particular college allows you as many tries as possible to get that passing grade to advance onto the next course, then that's a good thing. I mean, there's some schools out there that have a set limit on how many times they'll allow you take a course. After 4-5 tries, they tell you to effectively, piss off, and take your slow brain somewhere else. Piss on them.
The only way you get better is if you try.
Serious question, it's a good habit to study in advance the semester while you are in vacations?
The first problem that came up in me head is that my crush dont like me back
I have been doing math for 2 months and I can't put math in my Freaken head..!!??????
Just to save everyone personal time, the end conclusion here is know your basics.
Thanks very mutch!i am very happy because anyone speaks for math(sorry for my bad english)and good luck!
I’m letting his handsomeness distract me from what is coming out of his mouth
nice and plz subscribe the channel
I cliked on the video cuz i wanted to learn the thing that is in the tumbnail
Oh thanks for the video.....it helped me in my SAT’s
Hello,Sir ,?? You talked about Maths and I know that there is a slight difference between Maths and Statistics . Correct me if I am wrong , so I love to solve problems ...etc but the thing is that I have A subject this semester called "statistical Prediction " so I want to know how to get better in statistics too??
Is it bad that when Thomas told us to think of a hard problem I thought "My life."?
I do this everytime and often find myself doing the same question for 3-6 hours. Tbh I wanna quit
Heck, go and cheat in the exams. Learn things the hard way. Then you know the consequences.
I'll probably just stick with Khan Academy instead of brilliant
Nice work
i can not do multiplecation tables.trying for years.
You have to love maths to increase your ability in solving, like Euler's Constant
I like always was gazing at your beautiful face and had difficulty focusing on the content , damn ! Had to rewind again and again
This guy looks like Michael McCruden from Before They Were Famous.
Math is easy -Every Calculator
Thanks for videos from Nepal
All right but how to do it faster ?
Before watching this video my pre-calculus grade is 85% after watching tom’s video and series of math reviews I managed to score 95%! Thanks dude!
Here's a suggestion: find the most general solution possible first. Chances are, in multi-part problems, that you will be applying the same solution over and over again. If you can deconstruct the problem in the first part, the other parts will be much easier. The more general your initial solution, the more applicable it will be to following questions.
No I don't think math is every complex, hence, this is not my problem with it. Problem is that I can't study it in an organized course, because I know all the basic algebra and geometry. So getting it from the beginning is really really boring. So problem is how to begin.
lol im always lazy and im only fairly satisfactory in math XD but im good in other subjects, just not math
If you want to get better at math, the obvious first step would be to explore learning styles and figure out how your brain processes numbers and how you learn math to begin with. Everyone does not do these things in the same ways. The main reason so many people have grown up sucking at math is because they were taught in opposition to how they learned.
Please do one for English literature ???? I’m having loads of trouble with it. I’m given loads of creative writing tasks and my mind is always blank, and I always make stuff up as write and end up not getting the grade that I wanted ??
I’m in love ??
Q U I C K M A T H S
Photomath!
fuck. he is hot
I'm not actually in school... I just like math.
You have beautiful eyes
I hate Laplace Transforms, that's all...
probability?
When u would practise math all the time and still not be as good as your friend who was naturally good at math and never studied at all.
Now this is a beautiful mind! His beauty is distracting!
I'm in 6th grade. I don't do this #$%&
The secret is to pay more attention as you do a math problem. Most people make minor mistakes while doing a math problem that lead to the wrong answer.
My math teacher was the dog shit. So,i hate the math,now yet.
You have just earned one more sub
This guy is pretty handsome. You're lucky man
How can I not rush if my exam is tomorrow on 13 chapters!!!
i can't understand your easy example so i'am hopeless
math is hard fam every time i see a problem i don't know how to solve i get a raging boner
You are best YouTuber I ever know... Such a saviour u are.
very good!!!!
What did the boar say to the ring ?..,This show is BOAR-RING!!!,.. see because it's boar ring sounds like boring....... Ok bye you'll never see me again.
So learning the hardest math problems makes you better at solving the easier ones which you didn’t understand
This was do helpfull i like math but i have always had a hard time learning it.
Photomath is also an amazing application which shows all the steps to solve most equations.
Is that even possible lmao
Reaches 9:40. Doesn't add 20 seconds of BS. Be like Thomas.
Believe me Tom when I say Data Structure and Algorithms only gets harder. I'm taking a course for it now!
Thanks but you lost me at 3:06
When I'm watching this video my brain feels empty it doesn't even hurt at all while thinking
Math is a love hate relationship for me.
i am soo afraid of mathe
wow your math is way easier than the math we in greece do the math that we learn in 3rd grade of high is your 2nd year at college
Followed along at 4:29, bayes theorem, ok, aha, ok, gotit, ok, ... '= 1/3 TIMES BOX' Thanks math...

This couldn't have came at a better time. Finals in 2 weeks and i'm pissing my pants about failing the module asdfghjkl.
Thanks Frank you're amazing!!!!Especialy for Brilliant it helped me a lot
The summation problem is much simpler without breaking up the fractional exponent. You are only going to input 1, 2, 3, and 4. By inputting 1, there is no fractional exponent (2/1). Inputting 2, there is no fractional exponent (2/2 = 1). Inputting 3 leaves you with the cube root of the quantity 9n^2, which is a whole number (9). Inputting 4 gives you 2/4 as the exponent, which reduces to 1/2, which implies the square root.
Christ he's like the hottest man I've ever seen.. them frickin eyes .. I actually die for them ... he looks like a mixture between Jake Gyllenhaal and Justin Bieber xxx
I am CRAP at math
I actually new most of this.. i was expecting something more unique...
Fck that i‘m giving up I‘d rather look for how to get better at „meth“
2 plus 2 is 4 minus 1 thats 3 quick mafs skrrrrra
Was that a monty python reference? ( 5:44 )
I think "practicing" is the key factor we need to master anything not only math.
Hi dad
Hey Thomas Frank! Here is a pretty cool article :The five-minute trick that helps Instagram’s CEO crush procrastination https://work.qz.com/999979/the-five-minute-trick-that-helps-instagrams-ceo-crush-procrastination/ Also tune in to our radio show, Girl Politics where we tackle burnout issues also making reference to some of your tips! Tune in on Emendyradio.co.za at 10:00 :)
practice + patrickjmt
PLEASE do a video of your current system, did you change anything from the last video you shown us about ur productivity system ?
Thanks brooo really appreciate ??
Sponsored by WolframAplha
oh look a video for everyone in this world.
TOM,PLEASE CAN U MAKE A VIDEO ON EVERY STUDY RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON STUDENTS' WORK ?
my marks just crush my confidence every week
Can you do a video on adults returning to college/students with full time jobs?
OMG Monty Python jokes too! I love this channel! Seriously helps me get a grip on uni and graduating. Also really crushing on Thomas, so win win, I'd say :D! (I mean, how can you not crush on a handsome fellow with Arkham Horror on his wall in a lot of the backdrops?)
Here I am, a freshman in highschool. I'm struggling with multi-step equations. But after seeing Thomas do all of that, I think I'm just going to give up. On my last reported card I had straight A's except for one b- in Algebra 1. I have always hated Math and I always will. But this doesn't mean I don't appreciate the help though. Btw , I love your videos, Thomas.
Hey thomas, can you do a video about how to stop being a slow learner? Thanks in advance .
A good idea for a video would be about commitment contracts (like the economic concept), but for personal goals. Kind of like the happiness project that BoyInABand did, but more geared towards college students and how to create your own commitment contract. Thanks!
I am so happy that I am subscribed to you
Another great video from youu :) thomas, can you also make video how to save and spending less money on college students pleaaasseee????
this video made me worse..
Yo Thomas can make a video for high school students?
0:07 its thermodynamic, not math but still a great video !!! :D
THANK YOU!
SOS! If you're reading this thank you! Please help I have health insurance and other dues I need paid to my college in order to sign up for classes! I need it in the next few days because spots for classes are going fast! Anything you can donate to help is a blessing! My gofundme link is down below and you can verify more information there! https://www.gofundme.com/6m4kept8
Hey. Great video. Can you also make a video on how to write/make a blog? Thanks. Great fan here. :)
Sorry Bruh but this video is full of mistakes. How can you deny that some people's brains are more math oriented? I don't have a math brain. I can prove this. I put more time in to studying then most of my classmates. But I'm failing. It takes me longer to grasp new math concepts. You telling me this is all in my head? Nah. On the flip side. I've always been a great writer. I've always received top grades and praise for my writing style. My flow. My use of Grammer and punctuation to say what I want to say and have it sound how I want to sound. Other people can't write well. Why can I? I never practice. I never write outside of what's needed for school. Why the hell am I good at writing with minimal effort!? My own life supports that your wrong with this. And I can back it up with life experiance and reasoning. I'm not just making things up. I don't have a math friendly brain and every single tutor in the schools tutoring center knows this because I'm always in there. Always getting tutored. But failing. Why? Since we have very different views on this, if your interested, I would be down for an actual convo about the topic. I also want to add that genetics plays a critical role in one's potential intelligence, proven in studies, and seen in Steve Jobs own autobiography. Have you read it? You should. There is most certainly math brains and non math brains my friend. On this one you are mistaken.
How about a video on how to keep praticing math as a hobby for those who aren't in school or actively studying it? In high school i used to love math but i chose a humanistic path for my studies and i realized just now, watching your video, how much i miss the challenge of it and also how much i struggled to even remember what a summation is or even the most basic concepts. Where should i begin again?
I think on the example the exponent should have been outside the square root... not 100% sure though
I failed Cal II last semester feeling depressed with a D. I'm taking it now, doing well, and recently got a 91 on a test. Honestly, you have to just practice the concepts as they come along and find the time to master or at least partially master it.
I've been watching this channel since i was in 8th grade, now I'm in 11th and i don't think i would have gotten the grades i do without this channel. GOD BLESS YOU I HAVE A MATHS ASSIGNMENT THATS BEEN KILLING ME RIGHT NOW AND I FEEL MUCH BETTER
Whats ur profession
fuqthis im stupid
I've found that Khan Academy is great for learning math conceptually.
Well that ship has sailed
That example... my god :O
i LIKE YOUR THINKING!
I used to use beilliant in middle school!!
I'm bad at maths but then again I might have never really tried to work it out... What I do know is that I learn new languages fast. I'm on my fourth language now and still drowning in maths lol. So, maybe there are maths, science, arts, linguistic people... But it's nice that everyone's unique because I always find it fascinating to watch my friends whizz through maths while I'm stuck or just trying to memorise the steps because I gave up at understanding ??????
Thank you so much! Posted right before my calc and non calc test????
Thomas... I want your help!?? I am following uncountable studyyoutubers just bc i don't want that any useful study tip left. I feel uncomfortable. I have save 350+ videos of study tips in watch later....idk how to recover them i don't have enough time to watch them. I'm insane. Please help me!!!!!! Some of study video are like same By different youtubers. And i ended up by wasting my timing. Hatsoff to me!
Today, I almost decided to stop studying computer science - because the math required for pursuing this major was just too hard for me and i lost motivation day by day. So thanks Thomas that you uploaded this video just in time! :)
I just got out of school and I did fairly well at math, I was probably in the top 10 percentile but the problem is that all of what I learned is kinda fading slowly and slowly as I find it very difficult to apply my knowledge in the real world.
Khan Academy is completely free, and it seems pretty similar to Brilliant, although there are super helpful videos that explain the concept step-by-step. :)
I fucking love math. I don’t like how they teach math in high school “just memorize this formula” instead of breaking down how the formula is built and why. I’m blessed to have a dad who is a mathematician so when I have a problem he just shows me exactly how something comes to be ??
who can help me with add math grade 11 igcse problems?
Can you give advise for physic?
this video was over after 40 seconds
Thomas ..Have you considered as teaching as a career option? ..Please do! coz you will a hell of a teacher and kids will love you.
I love your videos they're so inspiring and motivational
Thomas could you make a video named : How to stand idiots in your class.
I love math, it is my favorite school subject :)
Can you tell me if their is a websites for math word problems
Waiting for your next book and it is taking forever
That strand of hair though!
Photomath is free and explains steps. Just take a picture of your math problem!
It's like Frank can sense what I need at certain points of my life ??
Thomas ,I need guidance to become good at English grammar
5:58 math-ster the concepts... :D
How do you always know what exactly I need help in? Your videos precisely correlate with my life!
How do you intuitively understand harmonic average?
Thank you. I’m failing math and need this.
this dropped into my feed from the heavens. Math Final next week thx bb
The 42 gag was awesome
Thanks so much for this video man, great job and much needed. Electrical Engineering student here completing the pre-reqs, I.e, calculus, physics, chemistry.
Nice video Thomas!
A video in my birthday.... I'm feeling blessed
African or European?
i have exams in 2 weeks and am so scared for maths fml
Love from Bangladesh. Your videos are truly amazing....
Beard tutorial please.
I completely agree with you on this. I'm in my fifth semester now studying mathematics and at first I was really impatient and struggled a lot, but maths is just a muscle that you have to train, as any other muscle in your body if you want to get better
Wait African or European swallow?
I'm in Calculus 4 (multivariable calculus - quarter system, not semester if anyone is confused about the number) and a lot of how I got here was from diligently practicing math for at least two to three hours a day. Practing more makes you more effective at answering problems and helped relieve a lot of my test anxiety. Also, I found helpful videos by Professor Leonard (amazing lectures), PatrickJMT, and Michele van Biezen.
Honestly just practise and stop hating it. Idk why so many people are lazy to do that but make fun of "nerds" that actually work towards being better at something. The amount of bullying and mocking that studious people get subjected to in Western schools is so mind boggling, how tf are you people raised?
left brain and right brain is true
Dislike. Not even gonna See it! Maths are evil! :(
Sorry but this isn't helpful at all, just showing off your level of maths. Try doing something for someone who isn't at YOUR level of maths in general, instead of making your EGO bigger.
Pro tip: The Wolfram Alpha app can be bought on Android for a one time fee as oppose to the subscription fee on the website. You get most of the same features. Not sure about ios as I don't use Apple products. Great video!
Suffering from mathophobia...
if anyone here is looking for a youtube channel that teaches math. go search patrickJMT, he got me through a lot of math subjects
Good tips, I agree. I was however surprised that the whole "Find someone who knows how to do the problem you're having trouble with, make friendly with them, then pick their brain for how they approach that kind of problem" was not included at the end. That has been a very successful tactic for me when written resources and practice aren't enough. I don't know if you have done a video on how to find, and properly pick the brain of a skilled person, but if so I would love to watch it. I've noticed in chatting up my professors that the process of getting each to reveal the tips and tricks that make learning their material easier is different for each person, but there are some common elements in each interaction. Simple stuff like establish a good rapport, be friendly, make yourself useful, ask them to work through specific examples and ask them why they are doing what they are doing for each step of the process you don't understand. Thanks for the knowledge, +1 thumbs up to you Thomas Frank.
Probably the most perfect reference ever to Hitchhiker's Guide ??
2+2 is four, minus one thats 3 quick maths
2 + 2 is 4 - 1 that's 3. Quick math
Physics grad student here, this advice is genius! I'm totally gonna tell it to my students when I tutor :)
The only math I mastered revolves around counting money
Maybe you could do a video on how to get better at writing ?
A very interesting video -- thank you.
i'm an entrepreneur now at 21 and math is the only thing i miss in school .
Thank you Thomas!! This made me laugh a little.. made my day<3 the sum was cute!!! This is all very helpful!!
I hate math, I've always had issues with it. But thanks for this motivation!
I'm in Grade 8 And this just sounds like random gibberish to me XD
Mathematics is not only based on calculating , usually summation need a theoretical solution , or in the case  topology problems logic and geometrical imagination is the way , but it's Hard sometimes .
Fantastic video, great tips, really helpful. Thank you very much Thomas!!
I should watch this video when I was at school??
Thank you! Keep going!
Math definitely requires practice, you guys. It's no use understanding the theory if you can't apply it! Another good thing about doing practices is that certain types or styles of questions come up frequently (at least at junior/senior year highschool math) and by learning the correct approach to these problems, you're better able to handle them when tests come around. Always do practice exams if you can get access to them - not only are you testing your abilities under time limit, it also minimises your exam stress (in my experience). Caveat: if you don't understand the theory, get that sorted asap before bothering with lots of practice. You should try and clarify your doubts quickly before things snowball and your foundation becomes shaky. This is also why listening in class is important - it's way harder to figure things out on your own. You may have a not-great teacher like I do, but don't dismiss them as they may occasionally say some helpful things. If your teacher's not cutting it, don't complain - arrange for consultations (some teachers are better 1-1), look for additional math resources, or ask the resident math genius. The same amount of input in math generates more output than subjects like Literature. The key is to work hard at it. Regular practice has helped me bring my math grade from a 40% to a 75% over 1/2 a year, and math is one of my weaker subjects. Put in effort and you might just outperform the smarter kids who don't practice!
Thomas, you're a life saver with this video! Skill is the mark of a master. I will check out the resources you've provided, set aside more hours of practice, and go back as far as necessary in my math competency, before I move forward with more challenging math problems. Its going to take time, but I know the reward is worth it. I learned Mandarin Chinese, so my new approach towards math is going to be the same way; full immersion. It's the best way. Thank you Thomas and I watch all of your videos. It really helps me as a mature student at University and a data analytics / machine learning practitioner. Keep up the good work!!!
Summary- Understand and practice
The fact that I'm watching this when I'm at my final year of a maths degree is telling me something??
Being a math Student, I totally agree with all those tips. Talent and intelligence are not required. Effort is the key component to becoming good at math! Combined with an intuitive approach that will trigger your interest, you will soon be blown away by the things you can accomplish.
Hey, college math student here, and if it’s helpful, I’d add that if you do have to look up the answer to a problem, it’s not enough to understand it. Stop and take incredibly detailed notes on the correct solution. In these notes, you should be using more words than numbers; otherwise, you’re copying, not learning. Imagine you’re a professor, and you want to get your class to understand a problem, but rather than explain it in words, you’re passing out the solution. Then imagine the dumbest, most clueless student in your imaginary class. Write your notes for him. This seems way over the top, but it’s the best way to get everything you can out of a math book. It’s also a great way to start thinking with a proof-y mindset, and that’ll serve you well if you ever take more theoretical math courses.
Shame this video came out literally the day after my final maths exam
Jake Gyllenhaal and you were brothers, I guess
I think he is talking about Traditional Math, not the Common Core or the New Mathematics. Anyone correct me, if I misrepresent him.
Please deo one of these on computer science/programming!
I think he is talking about Traditional Math, not the Common Core or the New Mathematics. Anyone correct me, if I misrepresent him.
Thanks Frank
What is that background music??
can you please make a video on scholarships? please....
What you actually need is a good teacher and practice.
Thomas, how can I gain back my strength after a failure? Idk. I just always getting disappointed day by day. :'(
Who didn’t like this video ...seriously??? The only think that I can add to this is that Math IS a language, and should be taught like any other language while you are trying to understand it...that would make things a lot easier in your mastery process !!!
Maths is soooo fun!!!
Really liked the video.
M: mental A: abuse T: to H: humans
https://www.integral-calculator.com/ was THE thing i used to learn integration. I never found any good text books back then.
Hey Tom, great video! Can you please make a video on being able to solve college level physics and chemistry problems?
Lifesaving video...you summed it up better than any Math-solving tutorial out there. Great job, Tom!
Alright!
THANK YOU
Just ask an Indian.
“Asians are good at math” is probably my favourite stereotype. I’ve had friends who joked that addictive vices like smoking and drinking simply didn’t appeal to them because math was their own addiction.
media offline lol
Another tool could be malmath android app
How to revise topics that you have already studied
Sir Thomas, helloooo! I'm a loyal subscriber and loving your content at youtube and podcasts, as I'm still a high school student. I want to take Law for my Grad School, but I also want to work to be of aid to my family and to have an early career. It would be really great if you will make a video about being a working student in college, for aspiring CollegeGeeks like me to be inspired by you.
lol people really think math is only arithmetic and basic algebra
but i tho wanted to be da bestest at doing maths
How can i get better in java programming? #cig30day please any advice. ? I know you also study programming.
The first part to get better at Math is treating it as a friend and not an enemy. Most people hate it thus making them bad at it. This is how I got better at math because if you hate something you won't put the time and effort in it.
I was JUST looking this up on Google and couldn't find any answers. And then I come across this video... ??
Monty Python reference for the win
This video is 2 years late. But thanks
I couldn't stop looking at that perfectly placed hair down on his forehead. I bet he worked on getting that right. My hairline is too high, so I'm mirin. Nice video.
Too late, Tom. I needed this during High School.
42! Hitchhiker reference!
Lol. My first reaction to a math q is "niope". That's why I'm here. ??
Omg Brilliant is so adictive! Thank youu
What is the air speed velocity of a swallow? What kind of of swallow?
i don't know how i got in college :'(
Tom, your videos are amazing, but I suggest you talk a little bit slower.
Khan academy, 100% free and nothing comparable to it to learn math!
I now I know how to count :)
2 plus 2 is 4, minus 1 that’s 3. Quick maffs.
I think math is difficult not because of math itself, but because of the teachers who can't do their jobs properly.
The same day I was struggle with my maths work , you uploaded a video about it. Perfect timing , definitely feel more motivated. Cheers pal ????????????
If one wants to get better at math, one must first pronounce it like maths.
instructions unclear. im now a meth head
i thought i wasn't good at math but i guess it was just the teacher because last year my teacher didn't really explain everything or she wanted us to just know stuff like little formulas here and there but this year the teacher is really cool because she explains everything and builds from simple problems to more complex problems whereas my previous one just threw us in the dark and explained a little bit but then just went straight for the harder problem so i felt lost half of the time
Math was a subject I was really bad at during high school but fast forward to grad school and i'm teaching people math concepts, acing math assignments and have a new found appreciation for the subject. I think it boils down to the attitude you have towards the subject. If you go into it thinking 'I can't do this' then, well, you probably aren't prepared to do it. So take it from the girl who once stumped an entire classroom and the professor by solving a complex equation and ending with result where I proved 1 = 3, if I could improve my math skills from that stage, i'm sure you can too!
Beautiful. Now how the hell do I get better at physics?
Most math makes no sense at all. It's not about being difficult…more like not understanding the context behind a math problem, "why is this important?"
I spent 2-3 hours everyday for almost 2 years to try to understand additional math in high school. Sadly after all that, my teacher told me to quit because it might bring the rest of my grades down by concentrating on it too much. I guess I just don't get it?
This was worth the two week wait
Just noticed you have a Castlevania Order of Ecclesia poster. Love that game! Great rundown video and mentally encouraging on getting to grips with mathematics!
Sadly I'm already studying too advanced math to find a solution on Symbolab. I just keep getting "currently there are no steps for this solution)
I'm actually a math teacher =) Great tips in this video. There's always some problems we can't solve. And guess what, we do basically what you said here. Also, Polya's book is a classic. I recommend it to everyone interested in problem solving.
Well I think before you start practicing it's really important to understand what you're doing, especially if it's a method/concept within math you haven't worked with before. Then you can practice by applying it to different kinds of problems. (btw math is a lot of fun once you get the hang of it guys don't stop practicing!)
I will have to write you a thank you note, sir. I have been following your channel for quite some time. The reason is that I have found most of what I need in the tips you give here. I'd like to tell you initially that I think you are heading in the right direction as far as helping others get the most out of studying goes. And I know a lot of people who subscribe to your channel agree with me on that. So I'd like to thank you and especially encourage you to keep up the good work. Best regards.
Text me 7044257450
Excellent video!.. and very handsome man, wow!
Math is super duper easy. Just look at the solution sheet, or type into wolfram alpha.
kumon!
Actual practical answer :just watch rick and morty ..
Helpful video as usual But I am a math major and unfortunately all we do is memorizing tons of proofs and algorithms We barely solve any problems
you got no friends
I'm actually going to use these tips. Thank you<3
4^(3/2)=4^(1+1/2)=4*4^(1/2)=4*2=8
I’m on my third year of Chemical Engineering. Math has become a combination of memorizing and understanding concepts(and really complex). A really good think to realize about math is that there is a limited amount of ways to solve a problem. The number of solutions are not infinite and usually in school they only have a handful of ways they want you to know how to solve problems. Use this to your advantage! Math won’t be as intimidating!
The day after I dropped my math course ????. It's ok! This is still useful because I'm taking it next semester!
Use photomath on your phone. It's free. You can take a picture of the equation and it will give you the answer step-by-step
I suck at Statistics but you make me want to master it because your cute!
I think that the biggest mistake when studying math is to think that you are learning how to solve a particular problem, because math is about pattern recognition, and that is something that a lot of people is great at naturally, but that doesn't mean that they don't work hard on learning it. When you repeat a type of exercise the first few are going to be hard, but the more you keep doing them, the more you will realize how that pattern is and how to solve it the next time. There are no shortcuts in math, because shortcuts will hurt your learning curve when having to solve difficult problems. Great video, as always. Sorry for my English, but I hope that my message got across.
Hey Thomas! I like your channel a lot, but this video doesn't have the same depth that you usually put in prior videos. You can get way better at math if you achieve some form of visual intuition to the mathematical concepts. A lot of the concepts in, say calculus, can be explained in visual/geometric terms (Check out the 3blue1brown series on calculus or Welch Labs on imaginary numbers). Also, you could talk more about what you are currently doing on brilliant.org after you 're finished. When someone tries to apply mathematical skills to programming, you can achieve a better appreciation to why you need math in the first place. Programming is a really good exercise in improving your math (and physics if you make a mock particle physics engine).
if you want to be good at math : > Stop telling yourself you're bad at math and stop saying "hahahah so me" when you see a dumbass meme like "i'm 25% funny 85% bad at math" >Instead, practice, focus, believe in your skills, make mistakes, learn how to correct them, eventually you'll get good. Know that it is at everyones reach to be good at math. Goood luck ^o^
In my country have a national test called ENEM, you need to do 45 exercices of math and other more 45 exercices of natural sciences in just 4:30 hrs or 3 minutes per question. I want to improve in mathematics but this methode to valute if i have the right to study in a public university looks discouraging.
i use calculator (for every thing)
Simple. Watch Rick and Morty
Great video Thomas! Keep up the great work! Your content is inspiring and unbelievably helpful!! Huge fan!
I don't know why but I'm slow at performing elementary calculations involving addition/sub/multiplucation/div in my head but for some reason, I can perform integration and higher mathematics in my head faster than the former. Does anyone else have this problem?
hey i had a maths mock earlier
I just did my maths exam on Thursday.... :(
I'm going to law school but why not study math am i right
I was literally doing my math homework when I got the notification. Had to wait till I finished to watch it
2 words, Professor Leonard.
Best timing ! I’m having some trouble with math, hope that will change.
Should've used square brackets to show that both the terms fall under summation. Most people will evaluate the summation of the first term and then subtract that by 6.
2 + 2 = 4 - 3 is 1 quik mafs
SERIOUSLY THOMAS HOW DO YOU POST AT THE PERFECT TIMES
Great video! Do you have any advice on how to study and not get bored or lose focus?
Thank you so much Thomas! :D
I'm good at math, but because I love math, I clicked on the video anyway ??
Perfect. Timing. Thank you :)
This is a well made video, but still not super helpful. Then again this is above my pay grade. I never mastered fractions. I also never mastered multiplication or division.
I am currently doing an A-level in maths and an AS in further maths. Here are a few tips that I've learnt over the years: - If you're in a maths class and you find that you just aren't getting it, don't jump to the conclusion it's your fault. You might just not understand that teacher. The only reason I'm getting good grades now is because my teacher at GCSE and first year A-level used a teaching style that I responded too. So in this situation you could benefit from looking for another maths teacher to go through that topic with you. - I find its best not to jump straight to Wolfram Alpha or Symbolab when you're stuck. I find its better to go on a forum page like student room as there are a bunch of people there who can help, even if they don't have that exact maths problem (they WILL have similar). Sometimes the best teachers are your peers. - Khan Academy is another great website. They have tons of videos on a range of topics for all levels of understanding. - As Thomas said, practice is the only real way you'll get better. My teachers recommended we do an hour of revision a day for each subject plus the homework. I will admit that I don't actually know a single person that does this but the idea that you need to revise little and often is still valid. You could come up with a little plan for this revision time. I like to go through the homework and do all the questions that look easiest first then work my way through the harder ones. This puts you in a good mindset for the rest of the time. It's like when you're training to run a marathon, you increase the distance gradually. In the end it is practice using the correct resources and challenging yourself. You also need to try and relax before hand and know when to step away from a problem and come back to it later. I do this in all my tests and exams. If I can't reach an answer in a set time (no.marks = no.minutes) then I fold the corner of the page and carry on. This means I don't waste time or become too frustrated. Hope this helped.
Doing an Economics degree taught me the hard way everything you detailed in this video. Maths is a grind, but can be made easier by understanding what parts of the equation confuse you and doing an easier equation based on that thing.
An important distinction to make is that this video covers how to get better at school math. Everything Tom said was true to school math; however, math is is a vast subject. In fact, math is the study of structure, everything has structure. Math, in a sense is the discovery of the structures in the rules of math. So the distinction is between getting better at adjusting to the notation and conventions of certain sub fields of math (school math), and understanding the big picture of the structures derived from simple mathematical rules that are not attached to notation and convention. This comment doesn't have much to do with the video I just thought it would be a good opportunity to give the definition of math.
Wolframalpha has a cheap app thats like the fire stolen from the gods
Thanks for the video!! Very informative!!
there is an app(android ,I dont know about IOS) that can do what sympolab do but a lot easier called photomath https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microblink.photomath
The best way to get better at math Is to do math I was at a point where I couldn't write a thing other than my name on a test but then I realized that I have to try to understand my situation and change the way I deal with it after 5 months of maths and chill ???? I had the first place on my final exam on it . It was emotional it's like a potential test for ones abilities.thank you Thomas for providing us with your amazing work.
Funny how this came just after I fucked up on a maths exam. It's probably a sign...
I liked the video before watching because I know it’s good :3
Hey man! Awesome video! You are helping me here in Brazil! Success
A: "I'm terrible at math." B: "Why do you think that?" A: "I did one practice problem and I didn't find the answer in ten seconds" B: "How did you try to solve the problem?" A: "I wrote down the problem and stared at it and the answer didn't come to me"
i love THOMAS!!!!
hit like when u like thomas' little hair on his forehead
perfect timing as we're doing trig with radians in math right now xP
Hey Thomas, I would really like to hear your opinion on a thing called polyphasic sleep. With a polyphasic sleep system you try do reduce your sleeping time as much as possible by cutting your sleep in smaller chunks (idealy 6x 20 minutes per day). The concept behind this is that your body/brain adapts to this and then starts the sleeping with the Rem phase and you cut down on nonRem sleep. Do you think this is a good/beneficial way to get more time and being able to do more things per day? Looking forward to your response and as always great video :)
Thomas i dont know how to thank you , you man have changed my life , you improved me in school I become a lot better than 2 years ago Not just school but my whole life I had achieved a lot of my goals I became more confident next year is my last year in high school wish me luck , again thank you so much for helping me the past two years
If the numbers are too big you aren't doing "real" math :D
When you just got to know that you failed math and you see this video the second after....
I saw the thumbnail and decided to watch this after I just took a math test.
Mathway.com?
Great vid. I've used khan academy in the past.
Lovin' the outro music Tom! Oh... yeah, the content's pretty great too.
perfect! just in time! i’m about to fail an algebra exam on monday :D
I love math and find most of it easy once I get the concept however I hate things like My Math Lab because all it does it tell me I got it wrong. It’s a bit irritating. Especially how sensitive the program is lol
how did you know that I was thinking of suggesting this on your previous video and all of a sudden I see a notification in bottom right corner how to get better at math.
Wow are you serious ? I always thought people said that as an excuse, I literally cannot understand how you can not understand math
This entire video was like advanced Japanese for me. I don't speak Japanese.
Read "A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)" by Barbara Oakley, Ph.D.
Practice, practice, practice..
Why am I here I love maths EDIT: I'm still shite at it though
Is that an African or European swallow?
Love you
Quick tip, psychologie suggets the middle of your head should not be in the middle of the screen but a little higher vertically, something like 1/3 the way from the top of the screen and the bottom should be shoulders and body. A floating head looks unnatural, because in real life, when you look at someone's head, you always see a body in the bottom of your vission. Hopefully this will help make your videos a little bit better.
2+2 is 4 4-3 1 quick math (the ting goes skrra)
Before my lunch break started, I got stuck on multiple problems on my practice test This video COULD NOT COME at a more perfect time!
Literally yesterday was the final maths test I will ever do in my life.
I literally cannot get better at math. I'm amazing at it. It's always been my best subject.
Add an 's'
I wanna sit on your face
thank God for thomas frank lol
My parents knew practice would make me better at maths and they made me do several pages of maths every day and I would cry each time i had to do it(i was 8-11 and hated maths). It just made me hate maths even more. Only until not doing so much maths at home and just learning it at school did I improve.
Roses are red Violets are blue There will always be an Asian that is better than you
I have a mock exam on Monday perfect timing Thomas
Thanks Thomas! ??
just what I need
Loved George Polya's quote: "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem that you can solve: find it." This is advice that can be carried over into all aspects of problem solving. Great wisdom, and great video!
In my 9th grade my teacher taught differentiation,continuity with iit problems which is the hardest exam in india and 8th grade they taught us integration to a extint and im in 10th grade and I still don't know why they taught these complex things this early
I dream of a day when people watch the video before commenting! I dream of a day when the discussion has something to do with the video! Fuck you guys -- Cartman --
I was Scratching on Math AND YOU JUST UPLOADED LOVE YOU THOMAS I was watching you for 3 years STILL High School :D
Watch Professor Leonard and thank me later
What baffles me the most is that people think of sciences as subjects to study hard for. Except for math, you have to have some sort of talent for it which is completely not true.
Im already good at it?? u miring?
The key to being good at math really on any level is (for the most part) practice ... the genuises might need less of it than you, but they need to practice a whole fucking lot nevertheless :D
Love math and love you
FIRST
Early
Ask an Asian
Perfect timing
Great content. Thank you. What software are you using to use this board?
not bad good job one hour and three hours your not only helping yourself you helped us alot thanks

Thanks for this! I need to take a prerequisite test before I enter a medical program and I haven't been in school in 3 years so I forgot all of this.
Hey how come negative 9-4=13 ? When I do it it comes out negative 5 ? Can anyone explain this ? It's on 6:20
How do I know when and how many 0s to cancel out during division?
Question at 7:05..What if its a (+)(-)=
34:00 why not just do 2x14 and multiply the answer by 10?
Finaly a good math video
oooooooooook.... I have no problems understanding and solving logic problems, but for some reason I never learned to deal with basic math in the proper way. It's been a while... 3 decades since I was supposed to learn that stuff in school, but I never got the hang of it. I always knew I could, since I definitely got the brains for it, but somehow it just didn't click. As an adult I figured I'd start getting the hang of it. When you got videos like this, it's easy to follow along at your own tempo. Like the multiplication table.... That was hehe - sad to say - iluminating for me here in this video. I know a lot of it by heart, but nobody ever told me what the point of learning it as a table is all about. When dude in the video says it's important to draw it up yourself coz you will see a pattern I thought, what pattern is that... I always had problems multiplying larger numbers in my mind. Nobody told me to draw the table and look for the pattern. Patterns I can do. Didn't take me more than 10 seconds looking at the table, realizing I no longer have any of those large numbers quickly. Unfortunately, the school systems do not have the know-how or possibility to pick each individual's brains to know what makes them tick, and how they learn stuff the most efficient way - that is the most optimized way for everyone - to learn in a way that make you understand it. For me on the table, it was the hint that there's a pattern to it (which I never thought of, because I gave it up in a young age, just accepting that it is pure memorizing that is needed, and it's really not what I'm best at haha). What the school systems and it's teachers could do a lot better tho, is to come up with ways that makes each and everyone pick their own brain to see how it works. I've had a math tutor once, when I was a lot older than the kids learning this are. Was an elderly math teacher. And I gave that up after just a couple of sessions with her, because she spoke a language I didn't understand at all. I told her, look I'm here to learn this, but you're starting on a level way above mine, and I simply do not understand it. I understood it when walked through it, but moments later, it was pretty much lost in confusion. I figured it was so because I lacked the basic knowledge - tried to tell her, but she simply didn't understand how to react to it. Enough incompetent and impatient teachers out there that's teaching in ways that just do not reach the students - at all. Many are extremely smart, and know a lot, but that does NOT make them good teachers. Many times the problem is even as basic as I don't understand the words and expressions used in the problems and teaching. I really wish I had picked up on this earlier on - gotten a tutor back when I was in school etc. I'm sure that would've helped a lot. However - it's not too late for anything I guess :). Now youtube can be the tutor.
anything times 1 is itself anything times zero is zero
this 6 grade boy doesnt want to watch basics
Thanks for this great video :) relearning math at the moment.. ^^ ???
perfect video for those who wants to learn maths.
Great video, however...if you're going all the way back to basic math, you're going to fast. No explanation on placement in long division? If someone were to learn math from this, they would be asking why is there a decimal put in this place? Again great video, but I think explanations could have been used more. Thanks
very nice, good job
Thanks Mark Wahlberg :)
the 183 dislikes are some students XD
Si toi aussi t en dnl maths...
Math Is something i struggled with always. I graduated 5 years ago and I'm going to start college soon and thinking about math gives me anxiety watching your videos helps a lot I need to walk small section a day or I my brain will spin that's so annoying I love math but I cant do it like if I would be good at it I would love it
Good job brother
Where is the other two parts of this video? Please i just need to learn the basics. Anyway this is awesome. I would be more thankful if you repost the other two parts of this video. Thanks sir.
Your the best you actually helped me
This is so calming it helps me and how can someone dislike this
Amazing video!! Thank you
hi
I've always hated math. Not because it was hard, but because I just hate numbers. But this is good. I'm told I put to much detail in my deep thought, I say why leave shit out. Missing detail is flawed conclusion.
This guy mumbles! And speaks quickly at the start!
Thanks ??
Thank YOU SO MUCH FOR THE BEST VIDEO
thanks this improves my grades alot from f to c-a
He kinda sounds like casually explained.
How far does the course cover i'm currently enrolled in engineering and really need to refresh my self with some math man so all this is amazing help.
This isn’t how I remember arithmetic minuses, when I was in elementary 7 - 10 = 3, and not -3. I mean the teacher said that it was right, was I doing it wrong the whole time (damn teacher)!
when we have -5-4 isn't it equal to = 9 ? because (-)+(-)= +

Awesome and clear ?? nice calming pace too.

How do you no mathematics
THE INTERNET SLOWLY REPLACING SCHOOLS
Can you do a video to what to cover on the asvsb please and thank you. I would really appreciate it
Please share the link of next basic level
???????? very nice
-14 - -16= -2 You subtracted from the larger number? because i was totally lost but i got the answer. 17:55/1:2:08
I'm 19 years old, in high school I hated math because I thought I just wasn't smart enough and so didn't bother to improve myself. I passed classes mostly by cheating because I could get away with it. I'm in college now and I felt like I wasted my time in high school and so decided to pick up math again, after watching this video I just found out and realized that it wasn't that I wasn't smart enough but to be honest with myself it was actually because I didn't have a strong foundation on the basic and was just intellectually lazy. Thank you so much, this video opens up so much opportunities to better understand math and study it further.

Thank you so much, this really refreshed my mind a lot.
Isnt there or shouldnt there be some kind of mark next to a minis or a negitive so they are different when next to each other so its understood the difference between the both or is it that there are no other instances where you would get both a minus and a negitive next to each other so the understanding would always be that the line before the number is always (negitive) and the line after a number is always minus. Is this correct ? Thanks
thank you so much
Thank you
I am going to use this, for school and try to see where i get to, hope i will impress my teacher.

Hello im Green raven today i will be Explaning substitution.The substitution method solving Linear systems A way to solve a linear system algebraically is to use the substiitution method.The substitution method functions by substituting the one y-value with other.We're going to Explain this by using an example Y=2c+4/3c+y=9 We can substitute y in the second equation with the frist equation since y=y. 3c+y=9/3c+(2c+4)=9/5c+4=9/5c=5/ac+1 This value of x can then be used to find y by substitution 1 with x e..9 in the first epuation./y=2c+4/y=2.1+4/y=6 The solution of the linear system is (1,6). you can use the suvstitution method even if both equations of the linear system are in standard form.just begin by solving one of the equations for one of its variables. Thank you for reading hope this helps you on substitution Subscribe to me and like if this helps you : )
hi , i want to purchase the full video, kindly suggest the way to go ahead.You can also email me on :v.rishiwal1@gmail.com
what is the application used to make such videos...?
Wao........:-) am doing great now in math. Thanks a million Sir
Dude, your're an awesome instructor!
I'm at 23:44! It's my second time coming here. I can only watch aprox. 12 min in one go before my mind starts spinning around. I'm taking a break again. I''ll be back later or tomorrow. I must finish watching this video! I will not give up! Thank you for teaching me!
You are nice in teaching people
Very good ! I love it ! It is better from going to school !
I'm gonna watch this over and over again till I get it and am prepared for college. And as a thank you, I will never skip the ads so you get some $$$. :)

Thank you so much. I'm using this for my ASVAB test.
Guna take a break.. It's the timestable that annoys me. I used to sit there as a kid going over and over and over trying to memorise it but i simple cant attain it. All the other math seem logical up to this point and im frustrated i need to cheat and look back at my written up timestable sheet. Most adding adding and subtracting will always come back to the bloody timetable :(
you're really spoonfeeding this to us, aren't you? And that's just how we need it! Public teachers be damned for their impatience! (well most of them anyway).

My reason of learning math is not handling money, not how much your using but to be ahead of everyone i school and help me with coding.
God says people are born with special ability's, one of mine was definitely math and god never said that.
Holy shit. This is amazing! thank you for making this! I've got it on 1.25 speed and I'm learning more, quicker, than I ever did in school. The reversing subtraction thing at 22:30?? Why didn't anyone tell me I could do this?? XD

this is great! thanks, this is exactly what I am looking for.
how to learn math without someone teaching you to?
Thank you SOOOO much for this video
a'm still in high school and I like mathematics
Thank you so much this really helped ;)
thank you for making a great video
wow man am 31 and I dropped out of school I never knew people teach in YouTube I always wanted to learn math
great and easy way of teaching thanks please don't stop do more I am ready to learn b\c I am interesting for maths but I don't have idea thanks a lot Baye men
thank you for all your work
I discovered how to add double digit numbers on my own, and I dunno how to explain it.
thank you for show this video it is helpful
I like math
You are not carrying one you are moving the ten to the tens place.
This have really helped me thank you ????????????????????
which soft have you used buddy ? i just wanted to create such videos in my regional lauange
Kiddo tips.... LoL.....????????????
ya school system ha kya agar school system ha tu adress bata de
I think it may be easier for some to do it the old way. Everyone is different.

What software did u used?
thank you so much
nice video :)
Not mind blowing. This is developed naturally as a student matures their math skills.
very nice??
Abacus is easy, take "know the abacus" app and complete your self and your kid and try to teach & learn as many as you can.
Thank You so much it will help me alot!
This was very helpful and amazing.??
My son can do math in his head. The issue is that teachers want the kids to show their work the way they teach it to them ,(problem solving the old way).
84+25 =109
You definitely made this more complicated then it had to be. The old way is more more efficient. I'm not even good at math but this is some common core shit you're teaching.
Tk
This is stupid, you’re just double adding in mind. Rather than the old way. Whoever did the new method is taking the long hard way
This is very helpful
WHICH APP IS THIS ?
Outlaw this method of math
The warp speed hand is doing my head in
My kid is homeschooling and this is the way they are teaching math to my kid, I have been trying the old way but I am just confusing her! Are they teaching the tens way in schools now this days? It worries me cause she may go to school next year and if she is learnig with the tens method at home she is gonna be totally lost. She is a first grader.
I think you're making it more difficult. If you're adding 49 + 76, the easiest way to do it would be, 40+70=110+9=119+6=125.
Your illustrations make a simple procedure confusing.
Very cool
And also IndySow please teach us on how to do subtraction and addition mentaly
Thank you so much! Because I am very bad maths now when I add I will check my answers using this method thank u very much u make additions easier.
Butt
Meh........k
This is how I've instinctively learned to do it, and I could do math in my head real easily since school age. When I had to do it the "classic" way on paper for a test, however, I always struggled to do it. The idea of "adding the numbers backwards" always felt alien to me.
So the way we teach maths in Australia is fucked then
Hello, Could you please tell me what software you used to make this vedio?
??????????
Not the best
Thanks Pavel. Your method is also so quick and easy
i taught myself this on school TO help me speed me up when taking tests. my hand writing was sloppy, but this way I can visualize it in my head. personally I think all math should be taught visually, but introduced on paper/pencil first- to solidify it in your head.
Good
Mindblown.
Hi. If you want to be prepared for this check Unflexal website. I know you'll find good solutions for your workouts.
I know tow
i am 10 years old and struggling math thank you so much!
Nice
Very HLPFUL OH GOSH
It was very good
Make some for 2nd grade
I find the old way better.Plus they don't tech kids this way.
Nice video. It is very good. Please find here also similar video with similar topics on basic level https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcs40TNky0M&t=1s
Pilz Mayans Addison
thanks you
Fr
thanks very help ful
Thank u for sharing knowledge. Thumbs up.
very helpful
awesome
wow this so simple I feel stupid ,if you catch my meaning.great video

l lov3d it..thanku school on wheels.???
Nice ?? thank you!
Why am i 11 and already know this....BECAUSE IM IN SINGAPORE AND SINGAPORE HAS THE HIGHEST SCHOOL SYSTEM..
if it is written or i can visualize it on a paper. i can easily use your trick. but when it is all in my head only.. it seems that i forgot some of the numbers...
New fun math game for everyone try it out for free!!!!!!!! Android : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OneTapp.TestYourMath&hl=en Apple: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1205325359
Here's a NEW method, this one is the fastest. 33+49, well 49 is just 50-1, so let's do 33+50 to get 83 then subtract 1, get 82. DONE! Now that was FAST. Now that took me about a minute or less to explain, but with practice, you can do problems like that in just couple of seconds. In the second example 27+46, do 30+46 get 76 then subtract 3 and get 73. Or do 27+50 get 77 then subtract 4 and get 73 that way. That's the beauty of mathematics is that you can do same problem lots of different ways and you always get the same answer.
Stupid, stupid, and stupid....bring back the old teachers.
This is vedic maths
love it
This helps me a lot for my math test tomorrow
10x10 is 100
678-456=200?
Thanks a lot, I'll share this to my daughter.
im going to second grade
This was very helpful.  I am an adult with many years of borrowing and not knowing how to add big numbers in my head.  I will try this and teach to my kids.
This video is basically about the Partial Sums method.
thanks for the math you gave me straight A+ thanks.??
Why am I faking watching this Calculators !!!
My method for solving this: I round the number closest to a 10 to that 10. Hard to explain, but on 33 + 49 I would add 33 + 50. This gives you a much easier number to work with in your head, then after you do that just subtract one from the sum.
Check this addition based math grid game for android phones which I think can help kids/adults develop and test fast mental calculation skills: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.myapp2.ali_r.ADDUP
You are awesome!
from class 1990'sI have to come here and learn all again and then teach my third grader the new way.
Why is 100 in the tens ?? That part got me confused!..
Thanks for this ! Very Helpful :DD
hi indySOW I did not get your video can you post another way that could be easy for me to understand thank you
it is ok if i use your video for my project?
Hi Ms Indysow I teach my son the old methods. but this mental addition you teach it's very clear and easy understand I hope you will post more videos thanks.
Hi Ms Indysow can you teach me about mental subtraction. thank
Your method drives my students crazy.  I show them the quote old way, it becomes clean, easy and efficient.  The new method is a pain - I refuse to introduce it.  There is nothing wrong with paper and pencil, and the old methods.
Blessed!
Cute video- Great showing these tips!
This is so helpful. Thank you
I honestly wasn't able to understand calculus for 2 years but now i got it 2 DAYS BEFORE MY FINALS
Leibniz Me: spits drink Me: YOU MEAN THE COOKIES?
6:53 looks like a zit
Awesome explanation. I wish I had teachers like you.
how can you edit your videos ? what software do you use?
I consider myself pretty strong in algebra (I'm wrecking it this semester, 95 in the class), and I'm taking pre-calc next semester and have no idea what to expect. I also have to take Calc 1 and Calc 2 (I'm a computer science major). Before this video, calculus was literally just a word to me. I now completely understand what I have to look forward to next fall after pre-calc. Thanks!
Dope video. Currently in trigonometry/ pre calculus. Will take next year
Ah the thing i wonte study i hat math
Oh I just completed 10k likes in 10 October 2018
Great teacher, God bless you dear.
I wish I never did drugs!
Why did the derivative have to be 1? That's just a very exceptional case. Unnecessarily confusing.
just conventional stuff no special insight besides integration is more than finding areas since it can find volume and line (height). no critical discussion of differentiation.
Tell me how many of you watched this video because calculus is now, used in AI and machine learning XD :)
Where were the other two slices in the beginning? I only counted eight.
Your video was amazing! I was able to understand everything so well
Funny thing is I could easily write a program to calculate this, but doing it the math way is difficult. In my Physics class I wrote powershell scripts in class on my laptop to do physics calculations so I could plug in numbers and get answers. The instructor seemed impressed.
It was a great explanation. Thanks
We're ever there is x replace it with-1
U have to how to use it and when to use it to see the whole picture as long with the rest of other maths
Good Work !!!
What are the real world examples of Calculus?
How did u find the area of the rectangles in the integral????its not clear to me pls tell me ????????
Yeah I've been studying Calculus not even knowing what it is. Thanks bro
One video has more worth than a month of my calculus class ever had.wow
i am in 9
This is too complicated for me but are really good
Quality Content!
I wish you were my calculus professor
Sir do more videos on calculas we are waiting
Very nice intro
It would be nice to get names of presenters, or their 'nom de...videos' (?) so we could refer more directly with the presenter. The woman presenting awesomely hilarious and effective Python vids would become 'Salima' rather than 'the hot chick in blue', and the calculus presenter would be 'George' rather than the 'dude who explains skinny rectangles in calculus'. In either case, more hilarious hot-chick Python vids and more 'skinny rectangle dude' calculus videos please!
I wish people would explain why a particular aspect of math is used BEFORE teaching it.........It just makes sense.....Introducing real world examples assists also...Great job!
You are a great teacher. It would be good to have more videos on a full calculus lesson and book. Thank you for this wonderful video.
I am from India and im in the seventh grade right now. This video clarified my doubts to what I will face in my higher studies.
how do we find the function itself? this is bugging me. i mean in real life we have to determine the function and the curve right? how do we do it? derivative and integral tells us about what to do AFTER getting the function/equation. but my question is how do we develop the equation or function from say a car travelling at different speeds over a course of time.
I've studied this for months but I didn't know that it was called calculus....
function ? does it mean the graph line described in algebra notion ?
Excellent video!!!
You are great,thank you sir
absolutely amazing.... worth watching.... thanks
congrats you just taught a 15 year old Calculus
Super sir..love from India ????????????
Why am I watching this? I'm only at first year highschool..
They discovered or they invented ?
Thank you very much!
I hate mathematics it drive me crazy thru my scholar life. ahhh i wish i could kill those people who invented much more complex branches of mathematics.
Fantastic
Nope.
Ha ha calculus was invented in india
Totally amazing explanation!! THANKS A LOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!
Wow! This was really helpful.
NC explained
Which editing software please tell me sir
I want to cry. How can you find this interesting?
Awesome, this was so refreshing and gave me back the big picture
I just learned this and I’m in 4th grade
THIS IS THE SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH INTERSTING VIDEOS
Am learning calculus from code academy ,its fun and better than my boring teachers who bores me to death ..... BTW nice explanation I understood most of what's said
Simply Outstanding!!!!
INCORRECT: Neither Newton nor Leibniz invented Calculus. It was stolen from the Indians. Just like the Pythagoras Theorem, Fibonacci, etc.
I still find it difficult to understand, starting from scratch, there are still a few terms which is assumed that the learner understands. It would be great if even words like derivative and integrals are broken down even further. Thank you very much for the video too!
ihope it doesnt discovered huhu
Solve Riemann
Discovery or invention
Correction geometry came from Ancient Africa aka Egypt
I've always been really frustrated because we start learning calculus from limits, while no one ever explained to us what we were actually doing. I'm glad I watched this video before finishing highschool! Thanks a lot.
This channel deserves more subs
Bhagiashree, a girl of my class come into my mind when I hear about Calculus. She is amazing at Mathematics. Your videos are very neat and clean Socratica.
Calc rocks!
A great teacher makes complex knowledge simple and accessible. Mathematics is a numerical expression of nature. Thank you for simplifying nature for us!
I will never forget this video and the teacher.Thank u a lot
Wish I watched this while still in high-school but I will learn maybe I will be of help. Kudos
Wish I watched this while still in high-school but I will learn maybe I will be of help. Kudos
The force of push and pull of matter.
Very very good video!
very good explanation. thanks..
This is really awesome..!!
Actually, Archimedes used a summation technique to find the volume and area of the sphere, cylinder and cone, anticipating the same developments in calculus by 2000 years. His Codex A and C manuscripts were lost, and his Codex B was almost erased and written over by monks. Codex B was re-discovered in 1906 in Istanbul (in the Hagia Sophia Library)and portions were analyzed, translated and published. Archimedes proofs use the same techniques for integration taught today.
Thanks! it gave me a good insight of calculus.
Some people are just good at math period & other people suck at it I'm not sure if it's because of the brain not getting it or they simply find it boring,  people are not created equal who ever said that is the biggest ass.
Excellent. Thank you very much.
whats a function and what do those lines mean in the graph?
I understood nothing...
Too easy xd
I need to re study about calculus..
I didn’t know Alberto from wwe is math legend.
Im just a gcse student and he made me understad calculus thats mad
Excellent intro.
Please make more videos
Awesome thanks
charming...and i have easily understand
Your lectures are so easy to understand. Please post more videos for calculus and vectors.
Actually a new analysis of a set of ancient clay tablets has revealed that ancient astronomers of Babylonia used advanced geometrical methods to calculate the position of Jupiter ie calculus – a conceptual leap that was previously thought to have occurred in 14 th century Europe. Ha ha ha ...u need to update your information m8..
Before: Didn’t even know what Calculus was. After: Full book of Calculus. That’s me when I watched this video…
how does he finds the slope
I wish you were my calculus teacher.
Thank you
Calculus looks really interesting!
This is an absolutely fantastic video. Thank you so much
amazing explanation
amazed by your explanation...We need more such videos
Calculus is add and subtraction up to infinity. Somewhat like circles. And sequences.
Awesome!!!
At 3:50, how did get the combined area of all 10 slices?  I didn't get the same number.  Would you consider doing a video showing the calculation of each of the 10 rectangles?
Amazing explanation.  Not too slow, not too fast and very very clear.  Thank you for posting this.
Blame
This is the best summary for calcu thanks
This video is very good for understanding what Calculus is!
Very useful video.. You have focused on basics.. ????
Thanks teacher
In junior year of high school and it’s almost like he’s speaking Chinese.
aww jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez
oH Wow! I signed up for this course without knowing what I was getting in to ... and now I know all about EVERYTHING :)
thanks for learning me some calcules
Nah!! Watch mathantics it's heaps BETTER!!! It doesn't even make sense explain clearly
Schools should teach calculus as a theoretical subject rather than a boring and stale mathematical subject that doesn't interest anyone.
I was kinda scared of calculus but now I'm kind of excited to learn it. Understand it helps it become less intimidating. Thanks for the video ??
This video continues to inspire my teaching. I come back and watch it again when I need a little boost. :D
God help
He just pulls the “f” and the “x” out of the air, and then puts some random numbers next to some of the letters. Yes great explanation...???? this stuff has to be fake.
What is x and g. He just puts it on the screen. Where did those letters come from. Wtf do they mean? He is just using them and others with no explanation..... Honestly I think this stuff is fake.
A very clear explanation. Thank you.
Thats so cool..
Bravo! What an excellent overview!
im a grade 8 student and just found this vid while scrolling but i dont know anything about this lol
Excellent summary. This is the first time in my life that I've encountered a math teacher who can use English in an organized and clear way to describe differentiation and integration. Of course, I'm going to subscribe.
English plz
Hands down man...
I send my love, sue!
Bro you are awesome
its really nice explanation for understanding calculus
calculus in grade 11 was gobbledegook then and it hasn't changed ... it still sounds like the parking solution at your local shopping center.
The word alone scared me. Never really understood at all what it was - Calculus. I watched this video on a whim and walked away feeling like I took the first step in opening my mind to a whole other side to what’s out there. Thanks for that!
Good explanation of calculus, however, I think, the importance of the concept of limits should have been emphasised more. Calculus would not exist but for the concept of limits.
very good i like you
Beautifully explained!
I think I can listen to you narrate almost anything..
that is called clarity.. i mean today no one even knows why the we are studying maths . studying without knowing why you are studying is absolute stupidity...awesome explanation. keep an making these videos. INSTANT SUBSCRIPTION!!!!!
this is a pretty good video mate. good job.
Damn, you´re really good at explaining stuff
Hilarious--this calculus video is sponsored by a Grammarly ad for people who can't spell.
I had an epiphany when I found out 0 is the opposite of infinity
That was an awesome explanation. Helped more then the those in my textbooks. Thank you very much.
Thanks bro this realy helped me out keep making more videos! :)
Beautiful video. Great explanation
Infinite/taylor series for various trigonometric functions such as sine,cosine,arctangent,tangent and pi were discovered by Madhava of sangamgrama (who was an Indian mathematician living in 14 th century) way before leibnitz and newton. Madhava and his school worked with calculus of finite differences and was able to integrate/differentiate these selected trigonometric functions. Using methods of calculus such as interpolation/iterative approximations/differentiation/integration madhava was able to calculate sine values of any angle with accuracy of 8 digits after decimal place. here is my source- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_series#Madhava.27s_sine_series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava%27s_sine_table His pupils and his school produced results which would today could be counted as calculus. I hope you take notice of this in your next videos. for more details about development of calculus in India(before similar developments in Europe by atleast 150 yrs) these links are useful- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuktibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3%C4%81 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji Show less REPLY
Do more videos on calculus
intro gives a hint about application of derevatives and function
If numbers were not changed by letters, I would have understand this perfectly.
This actually sounds really interesting.
can I get the contact details of the person who created this vedio?
The graphic approach. I like the algebraic. approach. Calculus is a function grinding machine one way you grind smaller. The otherway you grind larger.
Why do we study calculus in Physics???.....plzzz explain
I did not understand everything. But you are so good!
Me pronouncing this:derivevativeativeative
Great intro, I suggest a more descriptive title that emphasize it's content: "What is INFINITESIMAL Calculus?".
My brain is bleeding and I still don't get it.
Wtf am i doing here I'm still in 7th grade
i' m biggner trying to learn
Wat
love love <3
I wish u were my class teachers...thank u very much for the excellent video
I found this channel to be one of the best. Many people explain concepts with no base to plot the concept. While this channel does neither hype nor exaggerate itself to gain publicity. Teachers in here do come to the topic of interest very peacefully and explain any concept starting from its origin. This is true teaching.
This video explains how calculus works and not what it is. However, it's a good video.
Thank you.....That was very helpful.
Socratica:  excellent video.  Helps to explain to the class the basic  components of Calculus.  Many thanks for the information.
in the integral part,how will you get the height of the rectangles?
2+2=Integrales:(2+2)dx=2+2+c={{(2+2)^=^0=0}}={]{2=-2]=2^0=0]=[2=0]=[2^2=0]=[2^2=1]=[2+2=1] atlekejas :MARCELIUS MARTIROSIANAS tel867752875
finally i know what the heck is calculus
This cleared doubts...thanks..!
really intro to calculus, covers everyrhing
I still don't understand what calculus is !!!!!
JUST OSM
very nicely put together! Thank you!
It's interesting that whenever the question "what is calculus" is asked, the instructor immediately starts to do calculus. Is there no one who can explain the concept of calculus using common language?
Beautiful clear animations, cute little sound effects, calm and interesting voice, perfect speed, good use of repetition as well as great sound and video quality. Stunning work! I am glad I found your channel. Thank you for sharing your art.
Exceptional! Two thumps up. What textbook would you recommend for an absolute beginner of Calculus? I have seen so many claims as' the best ...'or 'the book on learning calculus...' I really need to have an excellent book to self study calculus.Thanks and keep making more videos.
wow.so clear.thank you.
Excellent overview of calculus. The best of several that I watched. Thanks for taking the time to share your knowledge in such a clear, concise, and helpful way.
Brilliant!...I have been teaching, tutoring and using high-level math for decades and have utilized analogies and visuals since the first lesson I gave...nothing is better than quality computer animation/graphics that an individual can watch, re-watch, pause or use to explain what or where they have become lost or confused...it is sad to say that universities don't reward TEACHING, but research dollars, which is why I prefer to do part-time instruction at Community College while maintaining a career in engineering. Damn well done!
Very interesting and clear explanation. I'm not sure I'll ever need to use it but I do feel a little better at mathematics now. ??
dont give distorted facts, Newton discovered Calculus not invented it, this concept has been alive since the vedic times.
came from mr zuniga
i am very thankful to you..
it's been a long time since I have even been to school and this still makes no sense to me at all honestly
In one word "AWESOME"
isaac newton was a genius and Leibniz too
can you please make a video on motion in a plane(physics).Your teaching and visualization is uncomparable.Kepep up the good work
Thank you. Much respect from Pakistan. (:
THANK YOU! I love math with visuals. In fact I want someone to teach the whole of everything in Maths with some kind of visual! I remember when I was younger I couldn't figure out the rules of multiplying positives and negatives until I read somewhere to just imagine it on the coordinate plane. It just made sense afterwards.
Glad I found your video . Thanks sir . You're a blessing ?? .
Simply Amazing...
OMG whyyyyyy is this on YouTube but I kinda like this video it is god for taking notes all you have to do is copy duuuuhhhhhh I like this video tho
Sephiroth Supernova Everyone?
Best Video I understood Derivatives and Integrals in one go!! Keep up the good work and please upload more Calculus videos
Beautifully done. I just stumbled on your site and will be adding it to my childrens viewing. Thank you
wow! Man thank you! This is magic
after 20 years since i first learnt it i have finally started to understand the CALCULUS.
Awesome - very brief and very informative... Keep doing the good work for kids
Great Channel, Very Underrated,,
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more.
This look just like algebra
Thank you!
Two dudes around the same time just... uh... thought up calculus. lol, wtf?
this is brilliant thank you so much
and plz upload detailed stuff.
clarity over board!!!!!
Here is a definitive proof for the existence of God based on well accepted math and scientific concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42yJ3Y3BgSc
I'm only 12 should I stop ??
Excellent video. Best lecturer/educatror! :)
Wonderfully explained :)
Am I the only one who sees only 8 rectangles at 3:29 ? Where are the other two?
ya, this is a lot bit advanced for me, i'll just stick with finding the gradient thanks...
Despite being 1/2 way through calc the series, I can still appreciate this video. Although, wish I saw this video before I started calculus.
loved it. Keep it up.
The MANDELBROT SET , AND FRACTALS HAS MATHEMATICAL SIGNIFICANT IN ALMOST ALL MATHEMATICAL FORMS , AND FUNCTIONS LIKE - NATURAL LOGARITHIM , 2.78 PI 3,78 THE GOLDEN RATIO , STIRLING APROXIMATION FORM, NON- ABLEIN ABSTRACT ALGEBRA , KLEIN GROUP , ANALYTIC GEOMETRY FUNCTIONS , AND MULTI-VARIATE ALGEBRAS CALCULUS, CATEGORY "SET " THEORY, CANTOR NUMBER THEORY , TOPOLOGY , AND ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY .LIKE RICCI FLOW METRICS , THAT GRIGORI PEREMAN USED TO SOLVE THE POINCARE CONJECTURE ! ANYONE WHO KNOW THE "SECRECT" FORMULA WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE ANY CURRENT MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM , NOW, AND IN THE FUTURE THAT HAS APPLICATION IN SUPERCOMPUTER, SOLID STATE PHYSIC EX. SEMICONDUCTORS,, NEW TRANSITOR LASER DIODE , CELL PHONE TECHNOLOGY, QUANTUM COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, WITH THE ABILITY T O SIMULATE AND MODEL QUANTUM LIKE COMPUTATION ON CLASSICAL SYSTEMS BUT THE SECECT IS HOW EXACTLY DO THE MANDELBROT BLOCK SET RELATE TO THESE MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS AND FUNCTONS ? WHO IS UP FOR THE CHALLENGE ?
I start calculous next year, thank you for introducing me to this early.
boy it is not calculus come in India
Great summary of calculus explanation in less than 10 minutes. Thanks a lot!
Derivatives and intervals; fascinating what type of real world problems calculous solve? I have just a G.E.D. and believe it or not I invented my own Theory of relevent mathematics. I'll be watching your videos.
This is an amazing video! What program did you use to create this? Something from Adobe?
I still have two more remarks that I forgot to say in the earlier post: 1. I would add Descartes to the list of founders. 2. Archimedes may have invented calculus, but his work was lost and was only discovered much later.
Pretty good introduction, but I have additional remarks. First in both processes, of finding out the value of the slope of the tangent to a graph and of finding the area underneath the curve, one ends up taking a limit. So here arises a third important concept in calculus which is the limit of a function. Second, finding the value of the slope of a tangent is just a particular application of the notion of derivative, however the theory of differentiation almost has numerous other applications like finding the rectangle with maximum possible area when its perimeter is given. Third, same remark as the second one but with integrals. The theory of integration has numerous applications other than finding the algebraic area underneath a curve. Fourth, I believe you should have said a word in the beginning about the concept of a function. I know that people have already seen functions in Precalculus, but the very fact that one has to cover sequences when taking calculus leads to the need of understanding what a function is from scratch. Actually when students take Real Analysis later, they see that the concept of a sequence is a more natural concept than that of a function. Besides, keep up the good work. I will be for the first time lecturing multivariable calculus next fall! I am waiting to be inspired by your videos! I am a PHD student.
I thought DIFFERENTIAL calculus and INTEGRAL calculus. is it really derivative calculus? I thought that derivative is for/ in the ones that says "limits, DERIVATIVE, and integrals"... ?? I just want to know and understand.............
very good experience with calculus by this video thank u sir after this video no body will fear to give difference between derivative and integration
Really it's one of unique and clear explanation. no more doubts will be after watching
Beautifully explained
The ntelligence of a man is not related on how well he performs in math, but instead in the success he has with the opposite sex.
This is the best overview of calculus that I've seen on this site.
Amazing video, thank you!
Calculus ...It is interesting when you put it that way :P
good enough the guy made me physics easier
This video is Great, ty for this (Y) Excellent work!!
Wonderfully explained.
so i just finished alg 2 and now i look at this like "My head hurts already"
You lost me when you said function ... What is a "function " ?
I get like 3 steps when I was in 5th grade
Brilliant! We need more topics on calculus covered and discovered!!!
very clear and informative and digestable very appreciate to your efforts
Thank you for not stopping at 1- or 2-dimensional calculus. Is there a video with even more examples that go into the problems and solutions that are modeled using Calculus or Linear Algebra?
You've forgotten: halfway through this beautiful exposition of differential and integral calculus in one and several variables, we'll throw in Taylor series just to fuck with the students who thought Calculus was making too much sense.
What do you get when you cross a mosquito and a mountain climber? Nothing, you can't cross vectors and scalers.
Thanks. I take the test tomorrow and I hope this comes up on the test. Perfect score here I cume
what is partition of a set?
after memorizing and calculating a lot of calculus problems for years finally it makes sense to me..... thank you for your splendid video....if you can make more videos on calculus to make sense I think it would help a lot of students like me .......
more videos, please
ARCHIMEDES = calculus.
Thank you for making calculus a little less mysterious and a little more understandable for someone with no mathematical background. At least now I know what it's meant to measure, and that it's based on a few simple principles.
this is worth learning!
Why am i watching this? i thought this was a cartoon movie.,and now my nose is bleeding
What is Calculus? Calculus is a method of studying the complex universe by cutting them into very small pieces which turn them into SIMPLE pieces like straight lines or cubes, making them easy to apply various math. This is called DERIVATIVE. Summing all the small pieces to represent the overall picture is called INTEGRAL. Explaining Calculus as 'slope and area' merely shows the PROPERTY of Calculus. This is why many students (and general public) do not understand the fundamental concept of Calculus.
This explanation is very intuitive, thanks I learn something new now
I have a hard time with maths, but not even the 2+ dimensional graphs scared me too much. You have a calming voice :)
Thanks for this explanations!
Wow, this teacher is excellent. Clear, concise, to the point, and in a relaxed manner. Five Stars !!!
I think I get it lol...
It is one of the hardest Mathematiic styles ever
Oh man... you are good. Nicely presented. Those idiots who taught me calculus at high school did not want the students to understand what they were teaching.
Houston we have a problem. The earth looks flat.
do you know why so many people hate calculus? because the teacher/lecturer doesnt even tell the student about this and jump into some crazy integrals and derivatives. this explanation is amazing!
I wish I could have seen this when I was taking calculus 15 years ago. I eventually aced derivative and integral, but I NEVER understood what it was about. Just one bit of advice. Please pick an example where the answer is more random than one just for clarity. Us poor non-math brains try to read something into that that isn''t there and so it distracts.
I'm pretty sure Archimedes had worked out a form a integrals. BTW, What is the use of finding the area under a curve? I understand that a function of a curve might be related to some physical event like the rate at which two or three chemicals react together or the curve could follow the behaviour of some financial instrument but why would I need to know the area under the curve?
you are a God man
All videos jump from the Greeks to the age of enlightenment without mentioning the Arabs who had their own share and actually added significant discoveries to modern science.. I wonder why?
calculus is math on average
I feel like I'm through the class already! Wow, nice!
It wasn't "discovered", it was "created". Math is not "the language of the universe". Math is simply our best translation of things that happen in the universe. I believe there is a better understanding out there that we have not created yet. "CREATED" yet. Once again, it wasn't "discovered". Math was created. Just like how languages didn't fall from the sky. We made that shit. And math is and will forever be only a language. Nothing but a building block or a law, just a name for something. A place holder. That is all it is and all it will ever be. The universe does not need math to exist.
Watch with caution, there is some incorrect information in here on the derivative.
And I thought I'm good at maths in school. Looks like I have so much more to learn
Mam's Style of explanation is better...Thanks your work is helpful for us...
It would have great if you mentioned an example of what computing the integral and divertive could be applicable to.
Darn boy! These peeps are pretty darn good! Thanks General Sal Khan
amazing video
Funny way of saying Newton descovered calculus.
super explanation.. thanks a ton...
melted my brain
never thought calculus was so simple and awesome.
None of this highfalutin shit ever made sense to me. What are the applications of this kind of math?
No confundir con Caraculus
i dunno y i keep watch this but i love learning things
MmmAmmmaa Mio jst awesome Luved ur workk
can u please tell me which software u use for editing ???? can u suggest me any educational video editor ??? any one please ?
Really well-explained. Good stuff.
I just started learning about limits and derivatives in school. I can't wait to learn how integrals work.
Awesome video. Thank you sir for such Great explanation.
i think u should make videos on parabola ellipse hyperbola as well . awesome videos appreciated . respect from Pakistan
I understand what calculus is (answer: something I don't need to know), but what are the uses of this information not just from a mathematics points of view; in other words what are the real world applications for this ability? Thanks
Amazing.... plz upload some descussion about quantum calculus..
I have never heard such an explanation for which I was searching for a long time.Hats off.
nice one
im only in 7th grade and i get this
Nothing can explain a complex concept as clear as an animation. Thank you for putting the time to create the videos. Is it possible to describe what software you use to create the animations so that other teacher, like myself, can use it in our classrooms? thank you in advance.
how did he got slops .24, rise over run 6.048/.8 is 7.56, idk maybe I'm going something wrong help haha
this is much more clear and gives me an idea and perspective,plus the animated video makes calculus a lil bit fun and creative despite most people say Calculus is a hard subject. Im also a visual learner so this help me to step up my game.Im taking pre-calc in summer to catch up with Calc1.
nice explanation and great task ,I want to add arabic translation but I can't kindly help
That's great
Hey, great video! I've learned more in this video then I have in all my math adventures.
Amazing work bro keep it up!
well organised at the start but oversimplified and focuses too little on limits, even if you're only going to use it as a tool, you ought to understand the concepts behind these else suffer from mistakes, some costly.
thank you sirr for letting me to know what calculus is
WOW! Play this video to Donald Trump, he will love maths.
Of what specific use is calculus?
If only I watched this video in my +1 and +2; I would be in a better place now.
Geometry was not invented by Greeks as you described in the introduction. In fact, it was originated in India in ancient times and the very name Geometry itself comes from the Sanskrit word for it i.e. "JYAAMITI". Most works of mathematics which includes Trigonometry, Geometry, Algebra and even the decimal system and zero were introduced to West through Arab, who actually copied it from India. I wonder how people miss out on that when it's so obviously found with little research.
Me at the beginning: Oh, I'm probably too young for this. How will I understand anything? Me at the end: I am amazed
So I had a little thought. If Calculus is necessary because it's impossible to calculate the exact area of a curved surface, would this different approach work?: 1. Take any object and immerse it in paint. 2.Subtract the final volume of paint from the initial volume of paint 3. Given that the paint is thin, wouldn't the difference give a close approximation of the surface area of the immersed object? And given that Calculus is also an approximation, wouldn't this be a more intuitive method that skips a lot of the difficult math?
Oh how this video makes me feel sooooooooo stupid!!! LOL And I am not really because I have a passion for astronomy, astrophysics, cosmonlgy, biology and Earth science but this ???
ur like Jesus.savior. do more videos like this.
bro your really literally god to me.in country like india education is making money and make students brain dead.
Actually, the ancient Greeks did have some knowledge of Calculus, and technically, Pierre de Fermat was before Newton and Leibniz, with the fundamental concept that started calculus, even though Newton and Leibniz fleshed it out.
If you're talking about Calculus, why didn't you say something about sequences or continuity?
Unfortunately there's a potty mouth in almost every video.
3 Dimensional Calculus!! So cool, love it. Thank you Newton and Leibniz
This is very well done.
idk, i mean this works 'sort of' and but it feels rather unintuitive, say i have a 4 state markov chain, and i want the probability at time t that the state has gone from state 0 to 1 and stayed at one. the whole 'area' definition of an integral feels really rather weak here. i think that a much more consistent interpretation of an integral would be the evaluation of a continuous argument through some continuous section of the domain. or an evaluation of the argument from point a to b. similarly when you look for the path integral you have a definition of length and then you apply that argument to the dx, then integrate. There's really not an 'area' here, same w/ vector fields and the force pushed upon a region.
This is the perfect amount of information. Parsimonious. Not a syllable more or less than necessary. Fantastic. Can you please do a series on Linear Algebra for econometrics?
This is a subject that always give me a head ache in school but after watching your video is have regained my hope if you keep up with his level of explanation i will get good grades in my school
what a good lecture.
Superb explaination ????
Hey everyone, I already took calculus 2 and this showed up on my feed, but I just want to say that I didn't watch this video and that I am glad I never have to touch calculus again. Good luck folks!
That's great, now explain the crap they scrape off of your teeth.
wtf is a function?
Good video.
This is the best explanation of calculus that I've ever seen. Thank you! Makes me want to go back to college (or high school).
This is really helping me with dealing with my day, thanks.
I refused calculus in high school. I refused calculus in college. I refuse calculus now. I do not miss it.
I learned more from this video than the 2 years of advanced Calculus I took in high school
After taking 3 calculus courses, it's great to get back to the basics. Great video.
Indians have discovered calculus before Newton +Djprojectus https://www.google.co.in/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.632433?client=ms-android-lenovo http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/calculus-was-developed-in-medieval-india Indian mathematics - Wikipedia
Wow that is very good video, I don't know how, but i pass my exam of Calculus I, i didn't know anything to solve the equations , but the lecturer didn't bother me to ask questions. My lucky day maybe. Calculus part II God helps people study who study that devil.
I recommend this video to anyone who has to take calculus, I've done calc 1-3. The part they don't show very well in class is the visual aspect. I can crunch numbers and memorize formulas all day long but to truly learn it they should really teach it the way this guy does.
You can't explain a topic by using terms that have specialized meanings within that topic. You have to connect new concepts to things people already know. This video fails at the outset. It "explains" calculus ONLY to someone who already knows what it is.
Did you use python to make this
"The derivative of f(x)" that doesn't mean anything. f(x) is a number, a number doesn't have a derivative. It's important to teach people what objects they are dealing with.
about half way through the video i felt very happy that I learned and understood the math. Once you finished talking about the integral of a function with one variable you blew my mind with what I still don't know. I may have to do calculus 2 and multivariable calculus now out of interest.... subscriebed
how about ancient Indians discovering calculus?
these are just demo can you giv details also please
I studied calculus 25 yrs ago but really understood it only today. awesome video.
@Michael Harrison - I usually have to use my hearing aid when I'm trying to learn something from You Tube videos because I don't hear the higher frequencies, but your speaking voice was just perfect for me so that I didn't need my hearing aid. And thanks for not playing any background music which just messes me up.
I was fortunate to have been taught by a superb calculus professor.
now i understood what's the meaning of (dough u by dough x) please do a video just on partial derivatives. want to understand how heat works.
If you not know what calculus is, then you should not be on the internet. Your time would be better spent in study AWAY from this medium
Still fundamentally don't know what calculus is, why it's important, what function any of this has.
Baby don't hurt me...
omg this is gold
Who else is here because they were forced to take calculus
Areas under a curve for a good part are assumed between y=0 (the x axis) and y=f(x). But what if you wanted to evaluate the area between y=-3 and y=sin x??
This had better not be everything calculus has to offer, because we have a whole year on calculus.
i studied calculus 17 years back and understood the meaning today. good work mate.
I was always intimidated by calculus purely on what others were saying. When I started it, I really enjoyed it. Along with conic sections, it was definitely a field of maths I wanted to learn more about.
Don't forget the fundamental theorem of calculus: That the integral and the derivative do the opposite thing. That is, if you integrate F(x), then take the derivative, you end up back at F(x). The fact that Leibniz and Newton were working on two completely different problems that landed upon the same mathematics is why it is difficult to separate the two when talking about who invented calculus.
what grade do you have to learn this?
please, more videos about calculus
I love you.Like seriously.this is so clear and so simply put.I literally just reconsidered dropping out of school because of this video hehe thanks a lot
Im loooooove this ..... explanation's are greaaaaaaaate....
Very insightful! Thanks for the explanation.
nice visualization of calculus in action, thank you!!!
OMG.... you explained so good.... keep it up.... ???????
It's funny because for french people like me this idea of "calculus" is very bizarre, because we don't learn it as such with a fancy name, we just get taught derivatives, integrals, exponential and log functions and trigo... And we get it taught to us starting at 15 years old approx..
Awesome explanation. Thank you!
you guys are amazing, kudos !!
Why is this guy off on a tangent? Ps I'm the greatest!
very intresting topic in math ! thanks alot
It's amazing how clear and how great it is. Really deep and easy to understand. Thanks you a lot !
Issac newton discovered derivatives, integrals, differential equations. how to solve multi-dimensional coupled non-linear equations. jacobian matrix, power series, and 10's of numerical analysis, he pioneered and discovered every mathematics there was, and there could be, the entire modern mathematics because he was the first one who understood the calculus, if Leibniz had really discovered the calculus, he would have discovered at least part of them, other branches of calculus, but Leibiz hadnt done any and didnt do any. and when Leibniz received the calcus letter from issac newton, he knew how great it was, so he made the notations. HE MADE THE CALCULUS NOTATIONS. and anyone can make notations.
I understand more about calculus than I do from my math teacher and text book.
Thank you so much!
This video was great, have a new subscriber :)
Excellent video. What I am missing is the connection between derivative and integral. It is said that integral is an inverse function to derivative. But how is "area under the curve" inverse to "slope of a curve"? I have never seen the connection...
"text a friend each morning to see if Socratica released a new video" lol
Really well done. Your explanation and video support was really well done.
calculus is the reason why i give up ingeniering.
this is one of the most clearest explanations of calculus that I've ever seen
thank you very much. you helped me alot.
I am a theoretical physics master's student, why am I watching this?
excellent...........thanks
This is probably the best video I have watched along my mathematics career. Thank you for the clarity !!
i loved this VID ! Awesome fundamental explaination
Has anyone ever told you you look like Kal Penn?
Thanks alot for this video, very clear and easy to follow.
I texted my friends each morning asking if Socratica had published a new video, they told me to go fuck myself.
if this video was in chinese it wouldnt change a single thing in terms of what i understood or took away from it.
fantastic!
And to think that sir isaac newton invented all of this in 1 like 1 day.
Great!
Thanks! Good overview. I learn better known the overview ????
you just earned my subscription. Thanks for the information. Thanks
At roughly 3:50 you talk about 10 rectangles but show only 8.
Hi I liked your video but looking at the comments it looks like many people are still having a hard time. I like to explain it like this if f(x) = x^2 then this thing we call a "derivative" is written like d/dx f(x) or f'(x) A derivative changes one function into another one and in this case it changes x^2 into 2x. 2x lets us estimate the change in the output of x^2 for example at the point x=10 f(x) = 10^2 = 100 Now if we increase the input by 1 to the point x=11 then f(x) = 11^2 = 121 which is an increase of 21 If we compute the derivative at the point x=10 we get 2*10 = 20 which is pretty close to 20 (5% error) This works better with larger numbers At x=100 f(x) = 10000 At x=101 f(x) = 101^2 = 10201 which is an increase of 201 which is pretty close to f'(100) = 2*100 = 200 (0.5% error) It also works better with smaller changes f(10) = 100 f(10.1) = 102.01 which is an increase of 2.01 evaluating the derivative 2x at x=10 gives 20 as before but since we only increased the input by 0.1 it makes sence that the output will increase less We expect an increase of 20 for every unit of increase in the input so we should expect an increase of 20*0.1 = 2.0 which is pretty close to 2.01 (0.5 %error) If f(x) = x^3 then f(10)=1000 and f(11)=1331 which is an increase of +331 the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2 and 3x^2 evaluated at x=10 gives 3(10^2) = 300 not bad and like before this works better with bigger numbers and smaller changes .......
This was a great video. Really good at explaining double integrals and calculating volume in 3 dimensions. Thanks.
omg he lost me exactly at 1:00 ??
i like it. thanks
This is amazing. After a decade of rote memorization and torture, finally i get the intution. Can't thank enough. Thanks very much.
what is a function , you should explain this.
please, don not stop ,you are amazing
just amazing
Very nice. While derivative calculus has always been somewhat intuitive to me, integral calculus has not, and it bothers me, as they are two halves of the same thing. I guess I learned that they were inverse processes too soon, so I never got to appreciate what an integral really represents on a physical level. (Though, I'd also argue that integrals are more difficult to understand in that respect. I can describe derivatives very simply as change, but I know no similar way to describe an integral.)
at 6:40, i was lost and hopeless
Too complicated for a beginner to understand. After all, the name of your video is: "What is Calculus?" Then again it might be a perfect name for the video because I think I'm more dumbfounded now after watching your video than I was before I watched it. You're explanation of calculus went straight over my head. The video failed to answer a few 'essential to know first' definitions: calculus, higher dimension, etc.
When does the ultimate question appear during the rain of the total eclipse while standing in the mists of the super frantic science fiction novel based off the judgement of evaluating the educated guess thereby undermining the total value of pie which has reconstructed all new perimeters of the timeline of the evolution of video games to whoever can divide the splinter can multiply the cell of the captured duck if only the man would comply with the order of the last air bending terminator to which i congratulate the numerical superiority that exceeds the expectations of the diagram chart explaining the proper proportions calculated by the robot Tom following the latest episode simply put making a cake. Although there are many different theories only one can be Coincidentally equivalent to the mind of the tsunami of breathtaking events?
subscribed! <3
Can you make a video for statistics ?
Hands down the best intro to calculus online. Not even Khan Academy or similar high-profile channels come close!
Please make videos on e, pi, complex nos, & undefined nos, what they actually mean in real world. Please please please!!!
That is amazing! So what I concluded is that we use derivative to find variation in space or plane (just assuming cause I'm still learning the calculus), like say on earth there is slight variation in gravity as earth is not perfect sphere, so derivative tells us about each point on surface (circumference) of earth about its gravity & I guess what integral tells is that how much area/volume is possessing a particular value of field for a specific region & what limit tells us is that the gravity field for earth lies between these two values (say between 3-6, just assuming) and the variation is confined within this range only. Just please tell me if I have got the very idea that you were trying to explain cause I'm still dealing with calculus which I always found difficult to understand.
You succeeded in combine brief and yet comprehensive idea about calculus; and that's really great! of course I wont miss any of your calculus videos
what's calculus : a character from tintin xD
great job bro ji
Great job Michael!!
Thank you!! Can you make a video explaining how Analysis and Calculus are related?
Omg... I hate functions!!! I've never really tried to learn it... but still hate it. Good vid tho!
Socratica could you put subtitles in Spanish? I'm learning English and i want to understand better, please.
I am always amazed at how much clarity you have in your videos. This is absolutely golden. I love everything that you do.
Please, make more deeper and detail videos about differentials integrals and differential equations. Thanks
I scraped through maths in uni, I won't lie! This is a good lesson. You guys have a great channel!
terrific video explained in the best possible way
Excellent video. Very clear. Thank you :) The only minor thing that I noticed to correct is the lining up the axes in the figure at 7:35. The z-axis should go through the highest point but it seems to be a bit off. Not a big deal though. Thank you for making such great videos:)
This is great!!
thank can so much!¡!!!!
This was the best explanation to calculus I've ever seen
Best video I've seen, hands down! I can't wait to see more.
Where do series approximations fit in to the Calculus? Things like Taylor Series. Sometimes the topics in math classes all feel disconnected. :)
great video! this would have helped me a great deal when I still was ignorant of calculus.
I am not from Brasil. I have a question is 8=10 according to calculus?
Yes! Can't wait to see more of your calc vids!
upload videos of vector calculus.
Still confused
Really great video, one of the clearest explanations of calculus
Great job! Great videos! I'm from Brazil and studying Physics and this channel is helping me a lot! Thanks and keep the good work! :)
