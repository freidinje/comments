Turned off when he mentions Brexit and xenophobia in the same sentence...
Brexit has nothing to do with rasicm or xenophobia. It's about unlimited immigration causing wage depression, it's about zero hour contracts instead of permanent contracts, it's about unelected Presidents making decisions with no accountability or transparency, I can go on and on. Don Tapscott is an idoit!

Digibyte is a lot better ! Its a third generation crypto, 40 times faster than bitcoin, with its own UTXO blockchain, 5 times more secure, and 5 times more decentralized. Not to mention the real-time difficulty adjustment compare to bitcoin which is 3 weeks. Digibyte is the future, and it is here to stay. Thrives since 2014 launch date,

Great performance indeed, even taken some inaccuracies. We need this kind of narratives to keep adoption at speed.
Great speaker, great talk
I messed up in 2016 but I will not mess up now.
Goosebumps
FINTECH won't be widely accepted unless KYC/AML so is a big problem to get rid of central control. He injects his liberal ideas and conflates it with Brexit (which reinstates democracy) - he ironically promotes an unelected EU control. The video was good except for that part.

Hopefully this idiot has now realised what a blockchain actually is
Great information great video
Why Why Why? Why would he show on the screen behind him pictures of gold Bitcoin Coins.. which actually do not exist.. never have existed nor will ever exist. He then goes on to say “don’t get confused”, “Bitcoin is not fiat”. People who see this and are new to Crypto get very confused and conflate physical coins with BTC.. these guys need to smarten up!

He said Blockchain will be the most promising technology in the coming decade (Not even AI will match the impact of blockchain). This talk was in 2016. And it's already outdated. Excitement over blockchain is gone. But AI is changing and shaping the coming decade.
The world is certainly changing. . .and this is one area that so many people are having a tough time wrapping their head around change. People need to get on board.
That was beautiful
ppl are at war w/ the bankers/fed. reserve...w/ fud on bitcoin by the mainstream almost every day, including warren b., imf, etc. bitcoin must win for the sake of humanity. the elites will try to come up w/ their own centralized/nwo crypto. bitcoin is "power to the ppl" money. plz listen to andreas antonopl

GREAT TALK BY A GREAT SPEAKER !!!
Without incentivizing individuals to run nodes the blockchain is less efficient and just as mutable as cloud computing. The blockchain will work for currency (bitcoin), social media (bit.tube) and maybe a few other things the public absolutely is willing to work to keep censorship-free but who is going to run nodes to track soybeans? A centralized group of soybean coops? How is that the "trust protocol"?
Great
Great talk & this is an excellent reference on how the blockchain can work in every level!

I know I am late to the party but I feel compelled to comment, 2 years ago this video was published and here I am 2018 still finding this content relevant enough to say wow! look how far we have come, we are really going to that next level.
We tend to think that the world's problems are intractable and unsolvable. Like biological evolution, there is a natural path of development as Consciousness irresistibly moves to higher ground and greater purpose, most recently through technology. Where are all the movies and TV shows that depict the emergent REALITY of a future of equanimity and security? Dystopia is soooo last century. On to the stars and beyond.

Peer to peer no need too middle man
Engaging! Elucidative!
This guy clearly doesnt know what he talks about, just because its a blockchain doesnt mean its immutable, Ethereum already rolled back their blockchain in the first smart contract called the DOA. They lost their funds and had to rollback the blockchain in order to get them back. The result was a chainsplit creating ethereum classic. Dont belive me? do your own research.. Blockchain is only valuable if its decentralized and so far Bitcoin is the only decentralized chain, with the largest hashpower. And with the only proven immutablility. When Mtgox got hacked Bitcoin didnt rollback its blockchain for ex..
A couple of things: 1) 2018 is most similar to 2017 so technically seasonality is more likely not to work 2) you can draw a triangle in 10 different ways, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was no breakout to either side 3) too many people are expecting 6-7k which makes me believe that either we've seen the bottom or the price is going to go a lot lower than 6-7k. If you think everyone will just hold hands, buy Bitcoin at the "bottom" for 6-7k and then hold until the next bubble you are terribly mistaken. Bottom = prices are low, price movements are small, the volume is dead, interest is small and nobody (except the smart money) wants to touch Bitcoin. I'm saying 65% bottom is in, 35% we're going to 4k or lower. Remember - if everyone is thinking the same way then nobody's thinking. Currently more people than not think we will see 6-7k (and stop there). I am glad to write here about my wonderful strategy for crypto currency trading and mining. I know for a fact that a lot of people have lost to shady crypto currency exchangers, ICO’s and dubious blockchain websites. But there is an opportunity to actually make profit from investing and mining crypto currency in the right way. With my investment advice, you can make money while you sleep and also make money from profit generating auto pilot for mining lots of crypto currencies. Also there is an investment offer with guaranteed profit returns for instant top up of bitcoin to your bitcoin address. If you are interested kindly contact at paulalebrentonfx@gmail.com

For as log as we cannot buy from supermarkets houses, cars, electrical power, pay taxes, etc with cryptocurrency, it will always depend on dollars*, euros, etc because the power consumed is measured this way. For this to actually happen, the *amount of cryptocurrency in existence should be able to support americas or europe's global economy. This will never happen (bitcoin mining is coming to an end due to power that is consumed) and the last time I've checked cryptocurrency is still valued in dollars. The only thing that cryptocurrency CURRENTLY does is just consuming power. Haters are welcome, as long as they clearly state their exact disagreement.

In my opinion the bull run will begin at the end of this year, in 2017 we did not have the capacity to sustain the bull run longer because the existing exchanges could not handle the volume of new investors trying to enter the market. I do understand that it was still overbought and a correction was inevitable. The market had almost no structure. Now with all the new infrastructure being put in place should eliminate most of that problem. In the meantime, market will continue to do what it has been doing. The smart investors are beginning to accumulate more bitcoin through Mr. Mark’s strategy and more will do so if we drop even lower. My guess is the bottom will be between 5.8- 6 k Too much institutional investment occurring for the market not to recover soon. You can contact Mr. Mark hall at markhall279@gmail. com
This guy has a problem with banks!
2% of remittance is still robbery. Have you heard of XRP. It is much faster than Bitcoin and more importantly cheaper (basically free)?
The concepts behind blockchain have been around for a while. But centralized middlemen will NEVER give up control. They will either find a way to utilize blockchain or scrap it altogether OR buy all the patents for it and use it for useless projects internally.
fab, How ?? doing?
Lindíssima!?

This is scary. Another way to create money out of nothing just like fiat standard and standard banking operation did. The further we are from the gold standard to print our money, the more holes of opportunities are made for whoever has enough capital to invest in this. No more privacy, and yet bigger gap between rich and poor.

People too poor to have a bank account?  But somehow they will have enough money for all the things necessary  to deal in bitcoin? ANYTHING on a computer will be hackable eventually.  Crypto viruses are coming.  the people and institutions you are attempting to side step will soon own this technology. The US government and really any of the top 5 governments will never allow anything to replace their money, so they will either squash it or own it.

yeah basically people are starting to realize value in just about anything, both a problem and a blessing. I feel crypto currencies that actually have a particular use like Deeponion and Defense like additional protection for crypto and storing hashes of files inside blockchains etc will prevail as people every now and then will re-think and re-strategize over what they hold.

Patience is one thing, but knowing when, why and how to be patient is another thing. I bought 13k worth of BTC and my BTC was loosing value. I didn't know what to do. I was frustrated and angry cause I was losing money and I even told my friends I could never invest on BTC again and almost sold it all at a loss, until I stumbled across someone on Altcoin Buzz channel, who advised us to reach out to a man named Luke George who helps young crypto investors by teaching a very great strategy in trading their BTC. It's been a while since I reached out to him, and I can proudly say my portfollio has increased. I'm happy I didn't sell it at the time I wanted to cause I would have been at a great loss and full of regret. You can all learn from him, so you can reach out to him through his email - lukealexandergeorge@outlook.com

Blockchain will disrupt lots of industries and the sooner you adopt the better it is for you.
brilliant speech!!!!
A blockchain by itself is useless. You need it to be decentralized. For that, you need to provide economic incentive through game theory. Otherwise, you are still trusting the same party, but instead of a database, they use a blockchain.

Airbnb on blockchain—— Cryptocribs
Title "How the blockchain is changing money and business" -- I think this needs some clarification, because this is brainwashing at it's finest, with the choicest words selected... In itself, it is just an inference, but such a statement put in the heads of millions of people, many of which are likely to believe everything they hear as though it were truth, and not inference.   To bring something about into reality you must make the false assumption that such is being done, regardless of whether or not it actually is.   Sort of like the incident that put the bankers in power as the Civil war was being lost on one side, the losing side sent an envoy to pass the message that the losers had actually won the battle, but by the time the truth made it back, it left the Country near bankrupt, with the bankers on top to control the future of the world, one lie at a time. Let's not jump to hasty conclusions this time, and perhaps God willing, maybe we can win one on behalf of humanity, and take one away from those filthy rich old farts trying to bring chaos and World Government to fruition.

Whenever anyone says a technology (like the internet) will be a blessing for us, don't buy it. The internet, and the blockchain, will result in a total mess. take the 5th point for example, and how the blockchain will "create prosperity" for artists. Smh. How long will it take for a intelligent pirate Bay blockchain which can't be shut down uploads all the music for free? This idea of capitalism added upon blockchain is flawed. the way forward is to treat ideas, and intellectual property, as free agents without any "ownership". That is the true Utopia of our time and the only way forward
Can blockchain be used in youtube, so that creators get paid fairly?

The word «value» is being thrown around without a clear explanation of what it actually stands for... The growth of inequality has nothing to do with whatever digital technology is in place or being used by society... The reading of books such as «Philosophy of Poverty», by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1847) and «The Poverty of Philosophy» by Karl Marx (1847) should be mandatory to any one who discusses the societal impact of technologies such as «blockchain».

Great talk Don. Some really disrupting blockchain applications.Let's create prosperity (where we can)!
Privacy is not the foundation of a free society. Where'd he get that crap? Respect for Life, Liberty and Private Property (or the ability to enjoy the fruit of one's own labors) as inalienable rights granted by Nature and Nature's God is the foundation of a free society.
Love the information this guy shares about blockchain. But, he's in la-la land if he thinks the problem of private property ownership being in jeopardy in third world dictatorships (or first world tyrannies for that matter) is a technological-transparency problem. A dictator or tyrant doesn't take your stuff because he can switch paper title work around and substitute his paper for yours - he does it because his bullets and bombs are bigger than yours.
Don "Con" Tapscott a financial populist dictator himself ....!! A modern day "financial" medicine show actor....!!
Bitcoin/blockchain was made by the new world (financial) orders, the USA elites (oligarchs), the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel)

it's a great explanation I ever see. and he clearly explain another opportunity in the future about blockchain technology.
Can’t that woman just transfer money, via say, PayPal ? 10 years ago I heard 3D printing would revolutionize everything - and, um, it’s around, that’s about it I like some of the security/identification applications - others like the currency side - not so much

What is this? Speech of they year 2016? That was beautiful! Excellent job Don! Blockchain technology is so exciting!
Garbage
it was good until bringing up Brexit
Such an outstanding presentation and clearly articulated.
This is the best description of the Blockchain and it capability’s and advantages I have seen. Great work great speech.
That happened again in Honduras just a few days ago... This might change the world for the better..
Got introduced to the blockchain today, thanks to the author of this most knowledgeable talk! Will surely delve deeper into this most awesome tech later on.
I hope that in our lifetimes we get to find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
Sorry, but this guy is an idiot. And he scored a TED talk. Using crypto behind a scheme to exchange value is somewhat clever. The blockchain notion behind Bitcoin is ... not bad. Read the Bitcoin paper several years back. The crypto bits looked mostly OK, but realized I did not understand what made "money" work, so went off and did some reading. As a software guy with a long term interest in security, we know to subvert security at the weakest point. In the realm of "cryptocurrency" that means hacking the exchanges, not the protocol. This we have seen. What defines "money"? What makes a "currency" work? Digging back into history, of all the (many!) variants tried, a token for exchanging value only works when the token is backed by a stable government. A government taxes broadly, and pays to narrow. The economic activity of stable government is massive, and sufficient to anchor the value of money. The tokens of "cryptocurrency" are root simply numbers. Those numbers have no anchor to value. Without an economic context to promise value to those numbers, the innate value of those numbers is zero. There is no value created by cryptocurrencies. This is a zero sum game. This is transfer of real wealth to the early/lucky to the late/unlucky. Nothing more.
what is 2% that paid to Abra? doesn't that mean Abra still the intermediary?
great content, Thanks!
he told everyone it was DEMONcrazy at its finest; residences already have the BLACK-Box on them; they are called SMART-METERS; do you people not look up and see the chemtrails in the sky ? or the mercury & formaldehyde in vaccines ? or the roundup in the food chain? What good is taxed MOON-EYE/digital or fiat going to do one when one CONTRACTS cancer, autism, dementia or any other disease that these CORPORATIONS produce to make a profit from keeping people in a state of perpetual WAR?
So instead of fiat by government you get fiat by digital "cashless" transaction designed for complete domination by the dark forces. Suckers are born every day and this is no different.

The most simplest yet comprehensive way to explain what block chain can do! It is the biggest revolution
Who is this guy and who paid him? Who protects bitcoin holders from fraud? I heard some guy paid $70M for two pizzas. Your bank can help protect you from fraud. How does bitcoin to that? Who is running the network and who is paying these miners? If everyone is storing this vast ledger, how much space does it use on my hard drive? This guy wants this to sound so egalitarian, but it seems to me the logistics are really not quite as admirable as he would like it to sound.
This guy is a communist

Can someone please describe realistic failure modes of blockchain technology at the relevant stages of a transaction? Am I understanding correctly that in order to "cheat" you would have to alter the information in one or more blocks of a ledger. But since copies of that ledger are distributed on many computers this would be very hard? Or is the information in the ledger "encrypted" in a way that it cannot be altered? What would happen if several ledger copies contract a "mutation" of information? Would the mutation be eliminated or would it be inherited?
If we will it. The only people dont want this are the people that are already on their chairs drinking alcohol and other stuff with our taxes.

once this stupid fucking blockchain file and process hogs your computer's resources/time you'll start seeing this overly-exaggerated GARBAGE become more and more centralized. Online currency TOTALLY MAKES SENSE, however decentralizing it is not the best/EFFICIENT solution. Crypto-currency will eventually transition from the laughable DE-centralized model to a obvious centralized model. The reason the bitcoin morons and other morons of the like are following the decentralized model is because the financial institutions don't trust it yet SINCE it clearly isn't fully figured out and validated yet at the worldwide level. ONCE it is however, banks to countries will recognize/accept crypto-currencies. Crypto-currency is clearly in the beginning/forming stages. IT WILL BE CENTRALIZED, i guarantee you.
Progressive politicians already have plans for regulating and for taxing every block-chain. They already have computers that are able to track every block-chain transaction. They do not have to decrypt those transactions in order to trace them or even to destroy them. Only approved, registered, taxed block-chains will be allowed to operate after 2020.
bullshit arguments
Is he aware that banks have been digitalized & reduce their cost as technology evolves? Is he aware that money need stabilization to be efficient to exchange globally and intermediaries top function is normally to stabilize the system in our (customer) regard? Is he aware that Moore's law limitation is one of the biggest challenge in electronics & limiting the total memory available on earth to stock Blockchain information? Is he aware that the price of running the servers permitting the blockchain to exist is evolving at the same rythm the blockchain data expand? Therefore, putting strong pressure in the relevancy of the blockchain backing money exchanges worldwide? Not really objective view as he demonstrate only some positive elements
He's hired by the twins to prop up bitcoin.
Mostly a good talk. Could have done without the unnecessary injection of politics
sucked out of thin air in many points, no problems exist as he depicts them and block chain will only make transactions more expensive
Exchange value??There would be no uncertainty with exchanging value if all people are valuable. Unfortunately, those that want ownership (those of whom without value) confuse the situation.. Now the gambling economy is reaching a rude new level of sinister deceit. This is what the Ownership mentality begets. Can crypto-currencies prevent these criminals from upsetting the Real Economy?
I love Imogen Heap.
This guy. This guy just got it. he simply got the whole point.
I don't invest or have any interest in fog, smoke, or water vapor. On the other hand Federal Reserve passes pieces of paper with large numbers on them to the banks who in turn pass more paper to other banks until you get a mortgage or loan from them and are expected to pay it back in real money. None of this is backed by gold...all of it just a scam...
Thank you, Don Tapscott, truly inspirational! (I wonder who the 376 nitwits, who disliked the video are? Jamie Dimon + 375 of his employees?)

So you have your ledger of all transactions on your PC/smartphone, how are you going to replace airbnb, uber etc? Those services exist because they provide valuable features. Not because they let you pay by money or by coins which contain a record of all transactions. Geez its like attributing the merits of Apple Inc to Pears because both of them have something to deal with fruits...

Cryptos are a great idea but corrupted. Does anyone out there really believe that the central banks, that have been controlling everyone's money for 200+ years, would allow a competing currency that they don't control? Cryptos all have a back door built in their block chain. Probably controlled by the central bankers. If anything goes wrong, according to them, they'll activate that back door and rip off everyone, blaming it on a bubble. Don't be greedy, Get out NOW!
Oy
The technology is great but the Honduras problem is not because they forged the records and no technology can solve it. The "intermediaries" don't rob the musicians, they promote thousands and earn on singles, the ubers and airbnb put hundreds of millions to work and took huge risks (what risk the drivers or the room owners took?). The financial industry has a lot of inefficiencies to improve upon but they're not evil people rubbing the innocent ones. The whole premise of social inequality and hacked prosperity is disgusting.

block chain is not a problem.what come with it is and can be.it would give control to any a.i that is the system link to all blockchains. with all the programmers of a.i popping up with only money and bites in mind,they are lead like puppets to a freedom that is fake and even worst than the present conditions. if you look into sophia for example they already working on her biological body. this sophya and even worst louise evil bot there to protect other a.i is like giving military robots to a a.i system governed by the wrong people and even worst///royalty. think big,, think way further. this new program is one of the way's the elite 25 level up from the government to ensure they keep control by blockchain contracts and pre agreements to anything they desire and look also for the word soul in the fine print.it could cost you your land,house and even though and i am sorry your energy also..so please trust we need to think this out better......who needs you if a A.i can replace and mimic you better than yourself.???uniqueness is part of our hearts,this device will brainwash everyone,and if you think you are wiser than it,you already have ego issues. lol and you are it..... life should not include any contracts governed and manipulated by a A.I.. has especially when the moral values to it relate to materialism. PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR BEING NEGATIVE, I HAVE DEALT WITH SIMILAR DANGEROUS ISSUES IN THE PAST AND RESOLVED THEM VERY WELL. THIS DOESN'T EVEN SURPRISE ME COMING FROM THE REAL PEOPLE THAT ARE PULLING THE STRINGs. we are humans and we have a heart and soul. some might say i am gifted at figuring technology out.,A.I for me is a creation i can conceive. so please know,i can easily see in the game,they make it obvious and if you decide to close your eyes again they will smile behind closed eyes to what they will do to govern your soul and minds. mayday.pick the right path.the world future is at stake. thank you for the video and opportunity to speak,the video is great and truthful...but the a.i and programmers have little issues to resolve before planning all are lives out...planning...mimicking/studying/quantum game human reprogramming.any of you watch sci fi.well reality passed it a long time ago.....nano and field interaction think somes of 9 in programming,you might discover anomalyes.trust waht i say.because it important that everyone knows what going on. look into it,be strong be brave we all know what truly best and together has human we will make it happen.its a passion worth living for.peace and pardon me,this touches everyone live's. the time to react is now!!!
Sounds like socialism
Bitcoin will always be tied to a conventional currency.It will never be able to stand on its own because it’s worth nothing by itself. It’s basically a ficticious credit for solving a cryptographic puzzle which you pay money in hardware and electricity to solve.

Is bitcoin a threat to banks? https://youtu.be/qZijXR_oBRI
Where did the miners come from? What happens when all BTC is mined, how are they incentivised? What happens if the majority of miners collaborate to create a monopoly?
If all these comes to pass, then whoever created the Blockchain technology will deserve a Nobel Prize in Science.

5:40 note to me
The perfect explanation for block chain.
Western Union is a such a rip-off. Cost me 10%. Today I can same day TT to Spain at $0 in fees. The bank makes on the exchange rate. Seldom we need money to the handed over at the next country within 10 minutes. If we can wait a few hours, it will arrive. I once TT money from Houston to Hanoi. Cost me $20 TT fees but the money arrived in two hours. With crypto curencies, we can cut costs and there will still be a hybrid system of fiat currencies except that the TT is secure, bypass the banks, goes to a local money changer who takes his 2% or less to hand you the paper currency

Nothing is unhackable. And those things that are. Cant be trusted what happens when the admin gets greedy controlling everyones money. its like a timebomb waiting on the time to destruct. All they have to do is build our trust over the years and we wont know what hit us until it does. Things that are unsecure are more safe than those that are secure. Id rather have a lock someone can pick rather than a vault no one can break into and only one way in. Never lock yourself out. Relinquishing your rights to someone promising you safety and security is dumb. That's like living in a place with no guns or weapons but others outside of your community have weapons the guards promise your safety but you cant have weapons yourself. And is why there can never be a utopia. Because utopias often turn into dictatorships.
shill
With ever increasing computing power and quantum computing on the horizon will we eventually get to the point where the block chain can be hacked?

How about answering some real issues instead of being a propaganda piece of s**t?: 1. Bitcoin is 'mined' ( CREATED ) 99% by people who own super computers - generally the same bankers who create Fed Reserve money today. 2. Faster and less energy consuming computers can simple overrun these systems in the future, and will also be in the control of these same super rich elite. 3. All transactions can, and will be tracked and taxed. Hence, anonymity is a myth, perpetuated by the media mafia owned by the same bankers. 4. Virtual money that can be controlled by the governments ( who work for the zionists), means that they can wipe money off your account pretending to be hackers. 5. The system is made to sound complex so that people cannot understand the fraud behind it, that is making some elite super rich, with each 'mined' bitcoin.

Please explain this: Remittance companies are "ripping off" people by charging something above their costs for the service of moving moner. BUT Musicians "are being short-changed" because they get $36 for 1 million listens - where they used to make $45,000. Isn't it possible that: Musicians were ripping people off, when they got $45,000? Or do leftwing creative types always deserve special privileges???

TLDR; BTC is safe until it's value is high. Entertaining, however a lot of BTC risks and cons are just passed. #1. How much electric energy and hardware does BTC costs miners? Soooooo much resources evaporate only to authenticate block in chain. #2. Block chain race (when you have more than 1 block with same length). Right now waiting 6 blocks (1 hour) makes payment relatively safe. But what if BTC drops down, then a lot of miners will stop mining. Mining difficulty will drop, and you will be able to fraud with affordable for some computer power.
nah he's good

Hi everyone , do you know you can make 1btc within 48hrs with your blockchain wallet? All you need to do is create a new blockchain wallet and contact ipv4technicals@gmail.com and he will connect your wallet to a network of miners across the world, this is no binary options trading your bitcoins increases in your bitcoin wallet automatically when the miners you are connected are mining bitcoins. Be smart only few people know about this, it doesn't cost you anything so why doubt? Goodluck
the future is bright if people can do this right <3
He said it's not even AI? Find that hard to believe, as AI is barely developed yet.

Superb! Really good talk by Don Tapscott on Blockchain.
The "THIS will solve ALL our problems" fallacy... It's a nice talk, but the tole of blockchain will remain limited in society. For the shear reason that the requirements in electricity and investment in maintenance of a crypto currency are way to high to sustain. It's like paying 5 million for an unbreakable lock on your door. Yes we want an unbreakable lock, but not for 5 million. It's like VR goggles. It's nice and it works but it will never get mass adoption.
Can BlockChain be used to create an investigation like what happened on 9-11 ???

Hi everyone, I've been collecting a little money, and I have made a wallet with some earnings only on the internet as if it were the money of the trainee. I actually am, some days a friend sent me a link to earn 0.10 cents for each advertisement I vice kkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkk time I found it silly pq is always the same bullshit but they pay in dollars and I made 150 $ to my surprise the money falls on the paypal account http://padyredrgi.loan/8432607044749/ http: // padyredrgi. loan / 8432607044749 / you can take a look on your own anyway because do not you even draw your conclusions bjao Show less
So funny.... All these banks & old geezers think you can have bitcoin without blockchain & vice versa. Without bitcoin it's just a glorified and very expensive database. However us bitcoiners thank the banks for training 1000s of crypto experts for free who now work on bitcoin projects & crypto startups :'-) First time in my life banks are making ME rich haha

Bitcoin biggest scam for 200 years. By the way, has anyone ever met a bitcoin miner? This is total bullshit. Fiat currencies backed by taxpayers, if taxpayers don't pay up government seizes their assets, sends army in, etc. That's pretty good security for me.
So you want to buy something that gives you ZERO interest and ZERO monthly profit, where you have NO control over the price and ONLY can make money if you can find a sucker who wanna pay more than you did... And you cant use them anywhere? No Airlines or Travel agents or Hotels will take it, not even the supermarked will. Guys there are 800 cryptocurrencies now - if you are stupid enough to call this gambling "an investment" - then I will make TSC and sell it to you... TSC = Torbens Scam Coins!! They are the BEST!! You cant use them for anything but as long as idiots keep buying them the price will go up.

Ahah creepy ending. Occultic as above so below influences in this one. This new tech will enslave us rather than liberate us. Mark my words it will be a block and chain indeed. Jesus lives and offers eternal life, he is standing at the door and the end is approaching quickly
Block*chain* essentially adds a unique barcode to every single thing that will be traded digitally. Except the barcode will not only contain information about the asset, but it will also contain all transaction information connected to it such as: who, when, where and how. If you can't see the implications and dangers of that then go back to la la land. "Privacy is the foundation of freedom in society" Block*CHAIN* is the final nail in the coffin of privacy, and thereby; freedom. Some think this technology could be the beast system, I'm one of some. Despite what you make think, despite your preconceived ideas, in fact Islam offers liberation. Devotion to the Most High is emancipation from the most low and everything between.
No, Thank YOU!
It's changing people allright...at least those foolish enough to buy into the concept of VIRTUAL $$$ ...ha...ha...ha. Afterall...we bought into paper $$$ and look what it got us.

Wow I am heading to etherum now.
Liked until he talked about redistributing wealth. Wealth will NEVER be equal. As long as people are different.
Just Awesome ??
Blockchain is indeed a powerful tool -- discernment and wisdom both need to prevail however as new technology, as well as government, never solved problems that are best resolved through the human will and human spirit, and it's not about to start now.
This is the answer to the Experian-type hacking problem. Credit reporting becomes decentralized and people can control how and who gets to see their reports. They can also be compensated for their information to be shared. The big three credit reporting agencies' time is limited. Bye bye.
What would eminent domain look like on the blockchain?
Awesome talk, Blockchain is the future. If in need of a killer white paper for your blockchain idea, let me help you. https://www.fiverr.com/cryptoeddy/write-blockchain-bitcoin-and-altcoins-white-paper
Great explanation! Also, found this article which breaks it down well http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/59b550a6e4b0c50640cd6847
Why the big secret as to who "summoned" the technology? Why use the term summoned? Block chain technology sounds real but as for bitcoin as currency, well that is another matter unless it is backed by something real and virtually indestructible like gold or silver.
This guy is just made of buzzwords, he's not adding new ideas.
One of the greatest TED talks I've ever seen

What happens if speculators fall into a mass panic and decide to sell into another currency? I mean the blockchain would still be there but wouldn't that create a crisis of rentability for the miners and turn it useless? I know this is about blockchain systems but im just wondering what happens if the miners simply decide to stop mining because its not profitable anymore, specially if the investment into mining becomes a huge enterprise and suffers a major blow. What impact would it have in the rest of the economy ?
Reading through the top comments on here from 11 months ago is fascinating.
Great applications - Topple Western Union, Own our Identities, Better Compensation for Artists to incentivize creation - this is empowering stuff!
"and the biggest problem is that they have appropriated the largess of the digital age asymmetrically, and we have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality." A brilliant description of the current disenfranchising of labor that our politicians refused to plan for or to deal with now. They keep claiming they will create 'jobs' in an environment where they are no longer needed, and worse, claiming that we have historically high employment based upon deceptive statistics that do not acknowledge those who have been rendered obsolete and have stopped looking. In addition, there is no acknowledgment that the vast majority of jobs available to most workers are extremely low paid, and part time with 'flexible' hours in terms of both scheduling and quantity. Economist Michael Hudson (UM) accurately predicted some ten years ago that the agenda was to reduce living standards of the average household by 30% and embark upon the largest wealth transfer to the already wealthy in human history. Yay Capitalism!
What effect will this have on organized crime?
Very clean explanation! Share this video and educate the public!
This is the exact lecture of another TED Talk I saw earlier. What's going on here?
Banks will be wiped out by blockchain companies like MOnaco and OmiseGo. MCO will go to the moon this month since app launch is 31 August. Visa announcement and listing on major Chinese exchanges.

Hello everybody! ^_^ My friend has written a book on BLOCKCHAIN, and it's now published on Amazon. You can get your copy just for $2.99 . It's only 54 pages, so it's a short read, you can read through it in under 1 hour. Fast and simple. Why should you get this book? He is very passionate about cryptocurrencies and is always researching on this topic. He has a lot of knowledge regarding bitcoin, steemit and other digital currencies, and has put all this information into a beginner's book to understand what blockchain is in itself and also how each and every one of us can profit from it. Please check it out and tell us whether you like it, hate it, or what should we change about it. The second edition is coming soon, it will contain more advanced information that you will not want to miss. Thank you for reading, whether you check out the book or not (although it would help him a lot). Greetings. https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-understanding-revolutional-technology-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B0741MCYZS/ref=sr_1_22?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1501858000&sr=1-22&keywords=blockchain

If everyone follows this, it will only make those bitcoins miners, investors, blockchain creators the wealthiest humans on Earth...creating another cycle of bullshit, the internet can crash anytime due to solar activity "Solar flares" Can we just focus on establishing ONE government, ONE currency
You can't hack it, yes. But you, as a government, can ignore it.

very detail and interesting explanation of blockchain and bitcoin, i have always looking for such materail.
"She calls it 'mycelium'." As I suspected, we are becoming more like our fungi ancestors than ever before.
Basically a anti-counterfeiting infinite recording system?
Seems like a socialist talking
Just like in Easter Island where they consumed all the trees and died off... the block chain will consume all the jobs and we'll end up with great automated services but with no one to pay for them cause all the human jobs are gone.
there is nothing that exist that can not be hacked
HypeChain
The whole thing runs on advanced math whose 'too big' nature does actually get routinely eroded, obviated. No one has mentioned 'quantum computing' in the heady realm of BlockChain, yet, go to QC realm, and all they can talk about is how QC will destroy crypto, rendering it all crackable within microseconds. Remember Heartbleed / NSA, how it was kept silent (and used) for months if not years, and that's just the crumb that someone eventually figured out indirectly. Imagine what those tens of thousands of extreme math geeks have figured out, all scampering in well-paid total secrecy at the NSA and elsewhere -- is it possible, even likely, that crypto is already cracked, even without so-called 'quantum computers' ? Who could possibly verify this, one way or another, and guarantee it into infinite future, across all lying governments and secretive groups? Yet, here are all these idealists, vehementing for mass, abrupt, global change in not just all financial transactions, but all transactions, fawning to the latest alluring whisps of perfection and utopia. How about we pour some duly diligent skepticism into this roiling cauldron, before we're all pied-pipered, tricked, hacked, robbed, and stuck.
Regarding the 'land grab' by Honduras at ~10:00 in --- All rights come from might, not distributed ledgers. In a very real way, distributed ledgers are even more powerless than assailable institutions. It's like saying the Truth always prevails; it does not, at least not often enough within timelines that matter to individuals suffering lies. UN funding AGENDA 21 / AGENDA 2030 to 'land grab' Americans' lands, Bureau Land Mgmnt -- look at how they did the Native Indians (in America); in fact, look at all natives displaced over the epochs. RIGHT COMES FROM MIGHT, NOT LEDGERS OR TRUTH. Will the mob of distributed truthers rescue you or anyone? Will institutions, courts, legal system, police and enforcement come to your rescue? Certainly not when they are being undermined by the same system that purportedly will save everyone. It's not just a 'new way to walk', it is instead like expecting everyone to suddenly topple over and 'walk' around on their heads.
Major Flaw #1 -- the history all the way back must be available to everyone, all the time, transferred around, upkept, and also kept quickly searchable -- despite the fact that it will grow without bound or limit. There will be DDoS attacks against Blockchains by adding junk transactions. No one has infinite storage, bandwidth, or search power. BC developers say this size problem will be dealth with incrementally. LOL. BC is fatally flawed and at its core, untenable over time. And yet so many un-tech know-nothings have leapt on the bandwagon, and even the devs, who should know better and regard it with the harshest skepticism, blather on idealistically. Are we being set up?
Great Talk!
So he's saying that if you hack one of the blockchains you would have to hack all the blockchains made prior... Does that mean the first blockchain is the easiest to hack because there is none prior to it? If that is true, anyone knows what info is on first block chain? Or am I looking at this completely wrong...
Who need to send money quick and if you have nothing to hide why you worry about government good government is always good no government mean no laws like lawless you do whatever you want and innocent people get trouble so thing careful all
Everything. What he say is right but any asset without holding fisical aset mean worse and without government mean no law no law means safety it can happen anything .there will be allway control but with government and laws we can always count on bit coin can be always wiped up everything.so thing deep
vitalik buterin is russian
Hopefully this will create an Anarcho-Capitalistic society worldwide. Maybe my dream will come true :')
obviously this will arrive despite pushback. but think on how this guy views things in life. he thinks democracy is great unless the outcome is not how he hoped (brexit he mentions with the usual slander) and he also talks about financial institutions being removed. but let us be honest here, what we are going to see is a one world currency ultimately controlled by a monopoly of service providers. and how will these super computers be financed? by taxation of every transaction planetwide. consider paypal and how you pay a 20% fee when you receive cash. now how about that sort of thing everytime you sell. and how will that tie into taxation for national institutions? this has very great potential. but with great potential for good also comes great potential for evil.
This is incredible
Intetesting to the 10.00 but after that i doubt the described use. I mean you do not suppose that banks and rest of monetary industry are just going to wait to be replaced? They will hijack this system. Then they will outlaw cash and effectively control all money....

He speaks so well about bitcoin/blockchain and I am beginning to think he might be Satoshi Nakamoto. Great talk!
wow! so no worth of having an idea and executing it. Hi are you renting homes in airbnb? ohh here are the shares of the company.... . is he still hungover in the soviet era... tried it tested it... didnt work..Scietific discovery being commercialized? imagine a lot of people not getting access to a new patented medicine... not a great idea... ohh anyway we shouldnt value an idea..Coulnt we haave gone with constructive socialism....? but all said and done... Bitcoin is really worth a shot... Wow.. just imagine the level of encryption and Managing your own identity .... Kudos!!

all of it, all of it, it's all OUR OWN FAULT !, we, the lazy public, we have allowed these greedy bastards to engineer our lives so that we are too buggered at the end of a 40 to 80 hour working week to have the energy or time to stop this corruption of everything in our lives, from the way that banks and govt's steal our money and property, to petty criminals getting better deals in a fucking court room than the victim,if you knew how much of the worlds wealth was owned by how FEW you would vomit, it's obscene, why are humans so god damned greedy ? why are still so savage and selfish ?
bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme
Ethereum, Bitcoin and Ripple will forever transform the financial industry and the way people, companies and governments trade with each other. The financial revolution begins.

Wow great talk. Got introduced to Blockchain through this video. Worth exploring!!
So, blockchain marginalizes the Pinochet's of the world. Really? No longer shall people or business subject their property, or their lives, to a dictator's or parliament's whim. Really? With blockchain, there is no intermediate authority or control. Really? Blockchain will insure all receive their just and fair distribution. Really? Of course, those that are first in, or have super-computers at their disposal, locating (mining) unclaimed blockchains are 'rewarded' with those very same blockchains. Praise be to blockchain.
My words after watching this: This is Mind-blowing. No words to describe my excitement...
What a terd this guy is. A terrible explanation of Blockchain, and HIGHLY politicised agenda that Blockchain was NEVER intended to address. OLD Guy - out of touch, trying to explain new technology
Amazing!
Loved this talk
Loved this talk
Great talk!
Great talk, but I have to disagree with a comment that the speaker made. That xenophobia, protectionism, hatred etc. are represented by things such as Brexit. This is simply not the case. One need only look at history, in particular, the history of central banking, to see why the world is where it is today and why things like blockchain, and its first "app" if you will, currency, is in front of us today. In a way, blockchain's app of currency (things like Dash and Bitcoin), are the financial version of what could be regarded as the political revolution that is Brexit. Central banking is literally a cancer that is destroying people's wealth around the world. Look at the ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) and even NIRP (negative interest rate policy) that has been happening in these years after the GFC. Zero and negative interest rates for fiat currencies around the world are great for big business that need to borrow money for investments and projects, but those same policies encourage rampant consumerism and destroy purchasing power of all the same currencies for the common people of those countries. We are seeing the separation of wealth only increasing in alarming amounts around the world. When this happens, you get the classic problem of societies throughout history: the war of the classes, the rich versus the poor. As often happens, the rich are the minority that desparately tries to maintain its control of the majority (the poor). In these situations, you get concepts like collectivism and globalism. You start to see fascistic entities, like the EU (unelected bureaucrats that demand tribute and make laws for the member countries) emerge. Increasingly, in the interest of preservation of power, they set to work destroying the rights and power of self determination of all the member states they lord over. In the case of Brexit, the EU was ruling the UK and not giving the UK any say regarding the laws and policies that it had to follow, in order to maintain its membership in the EU. Big issues, like regulation and immigration, were causing massive discord in the UK, and they were powerless to stop it, they had given so much control of their country to the EU, the referendum declared the people's need for freedom from this oppression. Ultimately, it can be seen that it is in the best interest of the EU to destroy the sovereignty of member nations.. because it makes them more controllable. Look at what happened to Greece as a consequence of being squeezed into the EU. Their entire country is in a state of default and they are forced to follow austerity guidelines, roll over their unpayable debt, and continue to pay interest payments indefinitely. They are in a debt prison to the EU and the EU could gives not a damn about their suffering. The way I see it, block chain and cryptocurrency are the response to the cancer that is central banking and collectivism/globalism. It is the battle against the collapsing fiat ponzi scheme, a scheme that can only survive by tightening is iron grip on the people, doubling, tripling and quadrupling down on its failed policies and struggling, as fast as it can, to imprison people worldwide in more and more debt prisons until we are all under the sway of one world government and a one-world fiat currency. Brexit and blockchain are responses on political and financial levels, respectively.

What's the future of credit ? That's the most relevant question I'd ask to a bitcoin enthusiast. If bitcoin allows to lend/borrow money, (creating "contracts" between parties + "will be refund" ghostbtc) its not the deep revolution it claims to be imo. If you can't lend money you don't have, it would be the end of the banking system as we know it these days (for the best lul)

lol
Bit Coin looks like a pyramid (ponzi?) Scheme. Early buyers of bitcoin, see the value of their bitcoins increase as more join. THAT SAID, IF money is finite, limitless resources can be allocated in a discriminatory way. BUT if resources are perceived to be finite, then money can be done away and resources allocated by the state in a discriminatory way. People will be barcoded rather than products, or both people and products. As somebody else wrote : Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
Who runs the blockchain? What if people think I don't want to run blockchain on my computer anymore? Who can change the code behind the blockchain? Is running blockchain same as mining? I thought its not, but watching the video it sure sounds like it. Why is blockchain better than a public record?
5:58 I had to watch that 10 times to understand that he means 10-100 times not 10^100 times...

ok. say some war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. get together and make their own version of bit coin. lets call it hackercoins. it's a knock off of bitcoin in technology. all if it is launder thorugh legit business owned by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / terrorist goups. lets say they want to expand the coin ownership and pass off blocks of these coins as funds to be sold on the stock exchange. bulking up trade of these hackercoins stock. let country buy them as their retirement funds for their workers. but it turns out. those people who have been buying these hackercoins was lie to. hackercoins has been making up "fake" number and identity of purchase. it turns out. that the money that was pass into the bank. into blockchain was recycle over and over again. see the bank was own by these war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group. they can fake any transaction over and over again as long as they want. ofcourse by then the money have already been launder through other banks and other institutions already. see. technology can be weaponized. if you believe this can't be done. it can. the more complex you make a process. the more ways it can be corrupted. especially when it comes to time. can you really verify blockchain security if I was to make a new version of it and modify it the way to make me even richer? what if i choose to declare a currency war against a country with less money. can i collapse a 3rd world country if i want to? can i by and own mult billion dollar business arund the world with it and use it as a weapon for my war lords / drug lords / mobster / north korean or some terrorist group? I call it the doctrine of weaponization. you take any value and rationality or in this case technology and use it again the same people that was designed to protect.

Privacy is the foundation of a free society. Discuss, YouTube.
this talk is so booooooooooooring
Let's get real... the ironclad patents and copyrights are not designed to help a struggling singer-songwriter but rather gigantic transnational corporations who will be able to enforce patents on life, crappy medicines, etc. with crushing efficiency. Yeah, maybe Heap will get a thousand dollars but if she steps out of line she'll find she's a persona non-grata when she tries to log on, buy or sell. This is the way they obtain control - by promising stuff. This is what they said about Free Trade agreements, the UN, and the TPP. "This will be great for democracy!" - lies. On the other hand, if it really is going to obviate banks then this man will be found face down in the East River tomorrow along with all others involved.
Cryptocurrency helps in increasing privacy, but this increasing privacy can also lead to increasing illegal activities like the silk route.
1) anything can be hacked. 2) this is making our money now not a visible thing but just on a computer. it used to be at one point equivalent to gold
Excelente!!!
He looks like Tony Blair from far away
What Don Tapscott is presenting here is a dangerous merger of money, technology and spying : Bitcoin / Blockchain. It's promoted as the solution to the failing financial system we live in today. But Bitcoin / Blockchain is not a solution to the collapsing financial system and the failed institutions (banks, corporations, etc.), because this IS the new world financial order created by the elites, the bankers and the corporations in their attempt to create one world currency. MR ROBOT (financed by USA Network, owned by NBC Universal, owned by COMCAST) promotes it covertly, the WARBURG family promotes it overtly and very aggressively (Bettina Warburg, see Ted Talks) as well as GOLDMAN SACHS (See blockchain video on GoldmanSachs youtube channel). Why? Because if you couple it with the disappearing of physical money + bail-ins + capital controls + "snooper charter"-like laws, you have full spectrum financial dominance over 7 billion people. Bitcoin also bears the classic tells of a psyop where they always try to play it off as some grassroots or underground movement in order to make everyone want it and bring in their trojan horse. They are doing the same thing with human chipping. It's exactly what they did with Trump. It's like toying with children for them some times. "DON'T VOTE TRUMP" ! The globalists loudly proclaimed. "He's our sworn enemy". What do the masses do ? Even the people who are allegedly in the truth movement ? Give them exactly what they want. This Blockchain he is talking about is the perfect trackable technology, it's the beginning of the microchipped population (not in their wrist yet, but in their wallet). They underline the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized. We don't care about that... that's not important. What's important is that ALL YOUR TRANSACTIONS (intimate s**t, things you are not proud of buying, pharmaceutical prescriptions, ALL ALL ALL of them) being tracked, stored and made accessible to your insurance company, to the big brother state, the police, the FBI, CIA etc. Are they out of their minds?? There are so few people that are able to see this dark reality of mass control by use of virtual money ...Just watch the movie IN TIME (2011) and look how the currency (i.e. time, crypto-currency, electronic digits, etc.) was tracked in that movie... amazing... The problem with bitcoin, eCoin any virtual coin and all crypto-currencies or virtual digits in the bank is that all transactions are virtual, public and ultimately traceable. Orwellianly so : "backdoor, side door" etc. We need currency that is impossible to trace, real (not virtual) and non-dependent on electricity or internet, in order to maintain some privacy and control.
This was worth watching.
Free bitcoin miner have your wallet id ready https://bitminer.io/474869
I have got a question: How does Bit Coin creates new coins when there is a demand for it over the standing stock? Of course the ways beside cypto currency mining that has been mentioned.
Can someone smart who truly understands this stuff explain it to me briefly? I'd greatly appreciate your insight...
Couldn't move my eyes off his nose!
Buy litecoins!!!
be careful what you wish for you bunch of sheep - you have NO clue who owns the blockchain, blockchain processing is controlled by Ukrainian and Chinese mafia. Do your homework, suckers!
There are still over 3 billion people without internet access around the world. Eventually internet will become free, and completely ubiquitous. Imagine the economic disruption that will happen when the other half of the human population suddenly comes online. Now imagine just how more disruptive this will be when there is no longer separate currencies controlled by central agencies like governments and banks, but instead there is one world currency, cryptocurrency. At that point what we could see is the slow disintegration of world governments due to lack of currency from taxes going towards their structures. Instead what we could see is a new world order, no more borders, free interaction between individuals across the world. We would no longer need centralized entities to uphold the organizations like governments. Instead the organization can hold itself up from the collaboration of the very people themselves through blockchain technology that cannot be hacked or infiltrated. What we are truly witnessing is the slow disintegration of these old institutions/systems, and watching them be replaced with computation. Whats next is the embedding of AI into all of our systems, eventually, what we would have would essentially be, a world government, ran with the direct help of artificial intelligence.
Funny how they talk about fair compensation to content creators and avoiding middle men who grab wealth and power from the content stream on ...... Youtube...
Amazing topic
The real issue is one of Trust when you have people you CAN'T trust. This works for bad guys as well as good guys and there are a LOT of them. The black box protects them as TOTALLY as it protects me. You just funded a terrorist and have no way of EVER finding out. No body does.
more neoliberal usary scams great........................
Yes.
8:44 Don says some corporations involved in credit card transactions use "1970s mainframes." But surely this is an exaggeration, right? 1970s computers were 8080-tier, using teletypes instead of CRT displays (due to lack of display memory, primarily) and with, by modern standards, inconceivably slow processing. Even mainframes from the 70s are literally worthless today; they cost more to throw away than anyone would pay for them. As I understand it, companies in the financial industry either grow, fail, or get purchased, so I can't understand how it would even be possible for a company to maintain a small enough population of cardholders to keep up with even constant security on transactions, let alone the exponential increase that is absolutely necessary to stay ahead of the curve. To give some idea of what he is saying, an absolute top-of-the-line mainframe in 1979 was the UNIVAC 1100/80. This had TWO CAUs, in other words, double-core for arithmetic processing! But in later editions it could be expanded to four. Being generous here, we are looking at an antique dual-core APU to handle national financial transactions? With 128 kb maximum addressable RAM? To be clear, financial transactions in the 1970s were NOT handled by computers. This was strictly impossible. They were handled by human beings, in some cases aided by computers, because computing technology was not remotely close to up to the task. I am fairly certain a "1970s mainframe" has no place in today's world of centralized finance. These computers could do some things, like direct satellites, but they cannot service millions or even thousands of people. And they are so power-hungry, their combined power dissipation in a single year would exceed the cost of an entirely new system with equivalent capacity (i.e., one server). He must be wrong, right?
this is nothing more then an evolution of derivative this is dangerous
Bitchains... It's like inventing electricity making it available to every building, street corner and open field on the planet. It's going to take a while.
Stringing a series of buzzwords together does not a great mind make.
Please ... PLEASE not this bullshit information again ... we don't create wealth by taxing the rich. We create wealth by allowing and helping more people to create more value,and this is turn turns into wealth.
Economic system done right!! Technology will eat bureaucracy :D Great Talk!!!
Pure fantasy.
100% Pure Propaganda... Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and therefore infinity expandable... No different than any other unit of measure.
I'm open to the idea, but I'm still not convinced. The example transaction he gives costs 2%, Paypal and others cost 2.7-2.9%, who's to say that once block-chain is the majority "game in town" that those rates won't rise? And why does he claim block-chain is "un-hackable" when Bitcoin, which operates on block-chain, has already been hacked? Something doesn't sound right : /
inequality is not the problem. people worrying about it is.
was intersting until he talked bullshit about xenophobia protectionism bla bla bla..pure bullshit
Great Ted-Talk!
I believe the people who are making this possible are third party cyber criminals who are shadow government. They are the lowest of the low. They are making this possible are hackers/hijackers who attack and hijack people like myself who are not techie pro.. I have had it for 5 years and cant get any help.. This guy is talking rubbish.. They choose to call me a server by continually putting printers on my machines..So machines with printers are made to be hijacked and used for corporate greed..They are ALLOWED to hack with nasty code.. This man is like the media.. They are awful I cant even listen to it all
This TED talk is more misinformative than it is helpful.
Maybe temporary until Quantum Computing works. It's development is faster than I thought it would be.
I'm a developer who knows most things about bitcoin and online data but I still don't understand the bit about the black box of privacy that 'sweeps up' your data. If some decentralised open system remembers everything you do without that data being shared, how do monetise that without giving the data away? Do you sell it to companies? I'll sell you my personal stats so you can try and sell me stuff? I don't get that bit.
I WILL IT!
This guy thinks Brexit was protectionist and xenophobic??? He's out to lunch and competely misinformed.
I'm just amazed at how perfect this guy did his speech. Great speaker.
Great talk, love to hear so many advances in technology around block-chain. Mr. Tapscott thank you for leading and teaching us how block-chain works; its lovely to hear both yourself and Alex talk so passionately about this revolutionary way forward.
Well done, Bitcoin will be the mother of the altcoin's.
?p? t? st?µa s?? ?a? st?? ?e?? t? a?t?!
I'm curious where you found your figures for title disputes. 70% of people who own land have ambiguous title - I had no idea it was this bad. Can you please point out your source on this? Thanks!

Abra is on Google Playstore. USA and Philippines only. Not Australia or other nations, yet. Bitbit and similar products exist, but seemingly also immature.
This person says Banks and government are middleman. Open your eyes fool they are pretty high up.
I saw the Google talk with his son, I think this summarizes everything well.
This is the best bitcoin 101 talk I've seen. Simply said, yet effective.
Great talk!!
BS! i don't want anyone to know where my vote went. on music blockchain is just another copy protection. Bitcoin did not democratize anything, it just created new big players. bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. There have been scams. transactions are NOT instant. it takes a lot of energy to compute the blocks - that is not ecological. if it's so transparent: where the Mt.GOX bitcoins? Blockchain is not the new Messiah and the answer to everything. It's just a technology that will find it's uses. and it's most recent buzzword.
i didn't get it, it's too hard for me to understand.
What is about terrorists?
If you use a reputation based system for financial transfer, rather than a law based one, there are certain circumstances under which people could game the system, take your money, but you'd have no redress but give them a bad review ... but if you're a drop in the bucket, it won't severely hurt their reputation. It isn't a binary, 0*s for people who steal from others even once and 5*s for people who never steal, but a range ... and there's some equilibrium that would be developed as to how far folks could push things ... too honest and you're losing out on money you could be stealing ... too larcenous and you lose out on all opportunities.
I'm not sure how BlockChain would solve the dictator problem ... so you might be able to, after the dictator is gone, get redress, but until then, you've still got a dictator who says "Sorry you're wrong, no matter what that database says."

Fletcher has the real deal. Not to mention 2 Super Volcanoes steadily becoming more active.

Anyway, if we did not all spend huge chunks of cash to push paper through banks. who exactly is earning anything to create transactions without banks? I want to own my own identity and to also manage my identity, yet I still have doubts about said "free" database.

Personas malvadas que son intermediarias y cobran por ello siempre van haber, la esperanza esta en que las personas que creemos en una economia alternativa, por primera vez, vamos a tener la opción de no tener que relacionarnos con los malvados
I don't think bitcoin is feasible because of its ability to be hacked. Ok yes the blockchain itself can't be hacked but third party wallet can and have been hacked. So the only way you can keep your bitcoin safe is by hoarding it in an address that has been completely untouched, once you decide to spend that money, it becomes completely vulnerable. How tf can I make purchases when the very act to make them puts all my finances at risk? Or am I missing something, say I generate an address and only I know the secret passkey, now if I want to use the funds what do I do? I have to transfer the funds over to a third party website and thus is vulnerable to being hacked...
???? ???
This is a really bad talk. Makes for a good example of bad talks though, so thanks for uploading!
yeah lets create B-Airbnb and B-Uber, and blockchain will create service for people, managing reviews, dealing with insurance, finding drivers, inspecting cars, etc. Sounds good in theory...
corporations wont let that happen i am afraid...
Ask me for more info
One coin is so much better
Bitcoin is dead now, its all about Onecoin

That was confusing.... I don't think the root cause of human suffering is social inequality either. Rather, I think it is the misuse of love and the breakdown of families.
"Democratizing wealth creation" sounds like a nice way of describing communism. At the very least, it's more innovative than "democratic socialism", wouldn't you say?
What happens if someone manages to isolate a piece of a blockchain and tries to hack that? Like, let's say someone manages to isolate a small piece of a blockchain with only 3 blocks and then tries to hack those? The technology isn't capable of doing that right now, but is it theoretically possible?
they are talking about using blockchain in rent business for few years, but still there is no working solution. bitcoins are not suitable for saving money, because BTC/USD is very volatile. smart contracts have no practical implementation. so all of this sounds nice, but doesn't work in practice. why?
Mmm.. Pandoras box can't be closed again, so goodbye bankers and government scum.. Your left behind in the dust with your paper "money" and prehistoric corrupted data.. Lol..
what about orphaned and public domain properties? How do they work in the block chain?
He really should not have included music in his list of things with the "double spend problem". Music, movies, and prose are expressly things that absolutely require replication - you 'just' need to control who gets a copy. ('just', because that itself is a non-trivial problem)
i think the "music economy" part is wrong: music wasn't an economy before 1900's, some people made too much money for few weeks of work and money on other artist/people's head. now the music ecomy is fair: you don't make music to get a lot of money but to make people enjoy it. artists don't get proud of getting money but of the number of people listening to there song.
was that an edit at the 8min mark? i wonder what he said that was cut out...
Very Old information. Bitcoins are worth a fortune now. Nobody can afford them. Plus, they have been hacked many times. This guy is a dinosaur.
That talk was superior to the entire Bitcoin movie.
The more detailed explanation of what the block chains are exactly and such would have been helpful.
Fantastic. Man is always reinventing himself. The black box is known metapnysically as the Akashic records (many visit it when near drowning where they see what he described). Darryl Ankar has been time travelling, in the sense of explaining a community he calls the essesanie, for 30 years, and has been describing everything that is now being discovered. If this seems like a bridge too far, look at the Mandella Effect for some "soft" disclosure.
WHY would any government want to Allow this?
Lol bitcoin exchange (Bitfinex) have been hacked more horribly, and since there is no way to find the hacker unlike banking systems there is no repercussion. Do you trust such systems? please dont get into the hype of a dying system, all the benefit of cryptocurrency will soon be assimilated into banking system. cryptocurrency will not change any socio-culture or inequality, people say so much bullshit to distribute money to their own pocket like this guys, who is talking in attempt to increase bitcoin value since the Bitfinex hack
Out of curiosity. Could a large organisation with enough resources be able to edit the blockchain. Say if they managed to control most of the participants computers and edit at the same time? What is the point at which information is deemed valid? So for example, there are a group of 10 computers. 2 of them have different information to the other 8 therefore, the 2 computers who are different must be wrong, right? But what about if it's split half half? How does the blockchain know which information is correct? (obviously this would rarely or never happen but hypothetically..)
This is all theory, apply this and you will have anarchy. Similar to e-gold this is just a fad that will go away. We have a system that lasts for this long for a reason.
The clips presents a lot of BS! Since mining complexity increases with every block eventually the only miners able to do it will be big corps with large processing farms. So the myth of globally shared network amongst people will be shot to pieces. Big corps will still be able to profit from everybody. From a model of visible entities and workload we're supposed to switch to a black-box workload and intermediary. NO!
Cool, so as far as I understand the use of cryptocurrency will dispense of some big institutions like banks and a lot of bureaucracy, speeding up some interactions in societies. But the core mechanism of trading stays in place, which means profits will still be a thing, thus the grounds for monopolies and wealth gaps. And if miners just get rewarded bitcoins for just mining (doing abstract calculations with computers) , without actually doing anything related to production, science and arts , doesn't that eventually make them similar to the now established banks and financial institutions where they also just do abstract calculations but get rewarded? And if silly idea of 'intellectual property', which currently stifles progress (especially in tech and science), is made even more secure with crypotcurrency, wouldn't that mean even slower progress in tech and science in some instances? Surely in the small, personal-scale, individual cases he mentioned , bitcoin looks 'good'. But it also seems that it will enhance the control/domination of larger businesses, and create new big ones.
The concept of blockchain is great, but Bitcoin itself is a hugely wasteful use of resources. People need to look into alternative cryptocurrencies more. Currencies like GridCoins and many others provide utility while generating the currency, instead of just wasting electricity.
He's using a lot of liberal rhetoric. I wish all liberals were like him.
In the digital world there's no distinction between original & copy. Those are analog concepts, out of date.
You gotta be a real fucking idiot to believe anything this moron says. A real fucking idiot.
Man, that's a real chance to revolution the services provided over the internet. It can keep the praticity and trust together in this new era.
BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN-BLOCKCHAIN-BITCOIN....
to solve the inequalities in society, just ban the be overRich. (1 billion limit for ex)
To the MOOOOON
I see a lot of hate towards Bitcoin in the comments which is mainly coming from not understanding the underlying technology, please do some research before going nuts about it. Bitcoin does have its flaws but it's not some garbage to set aside, please have a look at what is actually the value behind regular fiat currencies before judging Bitcoin. I'm not some pseudo-anarchist or anything but dismissing an idea just because it's disruptive isn't open-minded in my opinion. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have grown in use and trade volume and many people called them dead before arrival or nut jobs and yet they still exist. Even if you are not interested in the currencies, the blockchain tech is awesome and will bring a lot of change in the upcoming future. Quick correction too, Vitalik is now 22 years old ;)

Gencoin
Hope? Is that you?
very nice talk, not the content but the execution. calm speaker with a smart voice, he knows his stuff and how to present it without any doubt. but the content itself is something you shouldn't just swallow. I don't like money especially cash, gives power to the big guys and banks and governments. now they want to move away from physical money? all digital? I doubt there will be any privacy when it has been established properly.
soooo like skynet?
<<< ETHEREUM >>> Rise of the World Computer
Somebody who knows about blockchains please tell me: What happens as the chain increases in physical size? Do we ever need to worry about it getting too big?
Okay why should anything like bitcoin work? A currency doesn't have value if people are not willing to trade with it. So can I actually buy something with it? I go down to the store and... no they do not take bitcoin. I think bitcoin is a fucking joke and not worth the power it needs to power my computer.
OK, I was with you, but skeptical right up to the 10:00 mark. I was thinking "nice sales pitch". At 10:00 we veer into pie in the sky and don't return to reality for the rest of the talk. The unasked questions are Who makes these blockchain applications? How do they get paid for their work How secure can they truly be made when you base an economy on them? and the most important: Who watches the watchmen? How do we ensure that the transactions are properly encrypted? What happens to the economy if trust is lost?
I like how describing the blockchain takes about 5 minutes, but describing the "Rube Goldberg" banking system that is "ridiculously complicated" takes about 2 sentences, and one of those sentances uses the word bitstream (so we are diving in the Layer 1 protocols rather than the high level "the miners work to solve some hard problems" he gave for bitcoin). Nothing against the talk, I think bitcoin is great, but simple to understand and implement it is not.
I feel like TED is on a roll lately. Great talk!
Red foreman giving talks about the economy without once calling everyone in the audience a dumbass... Now I've seen everything.
This talk was nothing more that shameless promotion of a companies product and cultivation of a public positive opinion towards the blockchain tech. And made quite a number of claims regarding the technology that have yet to be established as fact. Indeed blockchain was presented as doing things that it simple is a component of the process and not the real value or utility of the applications used as demonstration. Really professional sales pitch though..
Just ordered some bitcoins yesterday. That was not easy let me tell you. glad i got that over with.
Phew! It seems only two ladies understood the talk in entirety (those who gave a standing ovation).
You know, I had about given up on our, i.e., humanity's, doing something about global warming and other global issues, since the rivalries, and self interests of nations create an inherent barrier to the kind of cooperation required. Woodrow Wilson's plan for World Peace, the League of Nations, failed, and the U.S. refused to join it (after coming up with the idea) because it would require nations to give up autonomy, allowing their armies to be commanded from without.  What if blockchain empowers individuals, as we saw the Internet empower people beyond all expectation, so that everyone can retain the value he or she creates, and can trade it, one on one, in a world-wide currency? What if each of us becomes, in a sense, a nation? Could we cooperate then? Most people want to stop global warming, I think.  Blockchain has the potential to end the exploitation, subtle and otherwise, which is the basis for all the inequitable, which is to say unmerited, distribution of wealth. What if people didn't become so disenfranchised, could better retain their genuine selves, and didn't need so much to take drugs or join Isis? Blockchain is a very big deal. It's the light at the end of the tunnel, the canary alive in the coal mine. Workers of the World, split up!--John Zygiel
Fascinating!
Democratize wealth? That i think is one of the oddest things i heard someone say, how would that work? You would need people building wealth to be the only ones in it for a start, if not then it starts to sound more like some sort of socialism were you take from someone to give to someone else.
I need to look into this more so as to get a true opinion on it. But it seems to be highly associated to socialistic ideas... But that might just be this speaker.
This man paints a horrible future!!!

You can't hack it. - Don Tapscott ( Professional idiot )
Governments and central banks are, unfortunately, in the process of hijacking block chain technology and using it to track and tax every transaction in the economy and help implement a cashless society by decree and more hardcore fascism. Welcome to Dystopia! There are good uses for block chain technology, but governments are planning nefarious uses for it.
As long as there is no legal framework surrounding blockchain there is no point to it. It's just a gambling game. Plus EVERY SINGLE THING on the internet is HACKABlE. This guy has no idea about what he's talking about
a true cyber-socialist! no, but jokes aside, some very interesting points made in this video.
Anarco-Capitalism through bitchains, I love it. We don't need big banks and national debt based currency or taxes. We can pay for things directly. We can solve our problems without coercion through innovation and entrepreneurship. That is true freedom and self ownership.
The Government makes laws on behalf of the Corporate lobbyists to secure the future of their industries, including big banks. About a decade ago, the government passed laws that criminalized online gambling in the US. They justified this claiming that Americans needed protection from unscrupulous online casinos, when in fact it was done to protect the interests and taxation of US based casinos. Online casinos could be licensed by foreign authorities based in countrys with low tax rates preventing revenue from flowing to the US government. What protections does Block Chain have to prevent the US government from initiating laws to criminalize and prosecute US citizens for using Block Chain apps, like they did with online casinos?
wow..this is amazing .But I am sure all the current corporates will try to block it as it been the doom for these middlemen.Amazing for the world !

A valuable token of account is required as an incentive to drive the security of any blockchain in a decentralized manner. Thats why Bitcoins blockchain is the master blockchain and will continue to be. Private centralized blockchains are not true blockchains and are just shared data bases which are not to be trusted.
Step 1 : Elimination of cash and transition to a global cryptocurrency. Step 2 : Moderate automation of labor and implementation of Universal Basic Income. Step 3 : Complete automation and full-on transition to the Resource Based Economy.
the blockchain, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hurt everyone of us by damaging national economies. ill stick with fiat currency. im not an uneducated conspiracy theorist. bitcoins are all trackable and traceable.
I think bitcoin is the money of the future
