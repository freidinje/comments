Yes but this damm is MADE IN CHINA
Good information, but don't blame China
Wait. 6.5 inches a year, and China added .8 to that.
2:58 f u China
2:34 gtrampers will cringe hard
Dam son. THATS A LOTTA DAMS
I thought the earthquake in Chile caused it
What a fucking stupid idiots
There's dam goats all over the dam place! Percy Jackson fans, hello?
Why do you think that moment of inertia is crazy!
You thinking is similar to the flat earther.
In 47,650 CE, one premature ejaculator will thank china for giving him one more second to satisfy his significant other
Who cares?
That was a Dam nice transition to the Brilliant AD
Eat your heart out USA! Not Yankee Doodle Dandy but YANGTZE DOODLE DAM-dest!
Was that a fact or a commercial!? ??
China ruining the planet and itself
Any irony for building a WALL....?
How can a dam slow down the earth if there was the same exact amount of resources as when the Earth was first made
Lol the made a dam for the pig who will get drown Pig=xin jin ping
Um , Is that a GOD DAM?
false.. earth don't rotate... if the earth moving rotate how the aeroplane want to landing if the earth moving faster than aeroplane
I have beat you. “damn that donkey has a damn gorges ass”
Warhammer 40k reference... Noice
If something happens to our beautiful world tha god spent 7 days making.. blame China
One shitty contry which knows only hacking even mother nature
What they didn't explain is how it affected the earth's orbit. In the next 7.5 billion years we'll probably come into contact with a large planetary body because of that shift in orbit. But who cares. No one will exist. YouTube won't exist. It probably already doesn't exist
God dammit
So nothing?
If global warming keep going at current rate the same will cause a more fucking damage than this meaningless earth rotation slowdown.
Bro why u rapping?
Stop nonsense, don't fool people..
Take this Earthe Flaters
Silly, what about the rising sea level then...
China is Launching Artificial MOON which will Effect Earth
Lol New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
China builds a bunch of bullshit building's and dams crowding the earth with bunch of crappy Shit...what a waste of time ...and Money...China really Sucks balls...
oh cmon its only 1 second, that not much ???????? we need moree
Thats why we have an extra leap year, God made it perfect and the flood messed it up.
Drink .7 ltr of scotch.watch these video.then scrarch your head.
I said the same thing about America shipping mass amounts of marble,slate,and other heavy shit to America plus the weight of the homes added to one land mass has to have an effect on the rotation of Earth though small it still has to effect the rotation
Yes..the Chinese dictator must dissarm
more ???
who dislikes this? *CHINESE PEOPLE*
Earth doesn't rotate but the universe does Thought i has been proved ??
Stupid asshole
That's why WE DONT NEED any chineae live on this world!
Burn china ...a cruel nation..cruel for earth.... China is power hungry and Don't care about anything else except its own.
But why??
Wt abt skyscrapers? It will extend the mass away from centre, will it not reduce moment of inertia of earth same as the way this dam is doing?
But how much do the skyscrapers slow our earths rotation down? Isn't that an important thing?
Sleep 0.60 nanoseconds longer Made in China
Birthday.. (previous) 5 4 3 2 1 HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! Present Fiveeeeee Foooouuuuurrrrrrrr Threeeeeeeeee Twwwwwooooooo Onnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaapppppyyyy BIIIIRRTTHHHDAAAAYYYY
then ocean doesnt affecting world rotation ?
Has it changed the value of our gravity. Anyway a big salute to china's Dam.
Omg this actually works! 1. Hold your breath for thirty minutes 2. Die
Chinese and muslims , problem of planet
Kya faltu video h poora chodu bana rha h
Stupid ...Dom or no dam water always on planet earth only.. what about big ocean ...does water flow to Mars without dam...damm dammm
TF CHINA THANKS A LOT FOR MAKING THE EARTH MOVE 0000.6 SECONDS SLOWER UGH LETS BLAME CHINA
So you're saying I could have gone home from school earlier
You are fking retards
Tnk china bcoz they slowed down aging Longer sleep, Longer chrismas eve, halloween, And Longer s8x night Pls make another dam
a earthquake let the earth rotate even slower so,,, what a bullshit video. it's true, but it don't makes a big problem. Not even a small problem. Just a problem that makes 1 day now 0,00000006 seconds longer.. :-|
Transitions so smooth
what a fucking nerd
just me or hes actually rapping
It's amazing the craps CIA propaganda comes up with these days. Lmfao
that doesn't make a difference ??
??? ?????????????????????????
Then how about Pacific Ocean weight it will stop the earth...
Daang so sck of fcking americunts complaining each and every thing about china they are so jealous of it since china is ahead of them on both development and economy
that’s trippy so, in theory, me raising my arm to the sky is slowing down the rotation of earth? obviously, it’s such a small amount it may never even be measurable, but it’s neat
Man I really want to speed up Time but at the same time I won’t have enough time to play Fortnite
Really?
If they were building new clear power stations, they would have problem with radioactive waste. With coal thermoelectric plants they would have Carbon dioxide emissions. There is no clean and cheap way to produce energy. The hydroelectric dams are the less harmful and profitable way to produce electricity.
Probably in the top 10 most useless videos I've watched in 2018.
I just knew China would find some way to screw us all.
No wonder it felt so slow
I think you need to check your math , and it's all HRC's fault ......she is why everything and anything sucks ,is wrong, or doesn't work correctly
Is there a difference between magnetic north and rotational north, and if so, how big is it?
Fuck China
Imagine what other planetary objects can do even at great distances. The ancients were smart enough to know...
That dam is insignificant to have slowed down the earth’s rotation but that’s my opinion
So china is change the world ,go china go
Climate Change... City Growing are another reason...cause the Urban Concentration (and weigh) is increasing... Pollution is just one small reason....the Axis Move is the greatest reason but,,,,nobody talks about it...cause it's not economically convenient...
How can it slow down a flat earth
It is a demonstration with a major FLAW. Your theory of "object moving in a circular motion circulates slowly when its size expands and circulates in a faster way when size is compressed" is only applicable on earths surface where elements of friction such as air or air pressure, gravity etc are present. But this theory is not applicable in space where the earth is moving in a circular motion as there is almost no elements for friction around the earth.. So the the speed of the EARTHS ROTATION WILL BE REMAIN THE SAME.
Next video "How US is the reason ISIS existed"
Damn this is hilarious ?? I love the bs they are spewing.
Very interesting video.
NEW ZICELOSTA RAHAMANDA ???? HAHAHAHAHAHHAA
Gog n magog
This is not logic!
Also make a video abouy how america is killing the earth .
They just dont give a dam.
Talk about dam. I live along the Columbia river where we have the 6th biggest dam, plus I live within a 160 km radius of 6 dams along the same river. Gotta love cheap electricity
Whatever there is on earth has not came from mars. So how could a dam construction could affect the rotation of earth? Btw i havent watched the entire video
China is fucking up everything on earth.
really?
It didn’t slow down they just took resources FROM the earth and just purified the materials
What would be the effect of a space elevator?
How a massive Hoe broke my heart
I cringed very hard with that sponsor transition
I just got an erection. How much did it affect earth's rotation speed?
How Trump does destroys our planet ?
ksom china
fuck the chinese!!!!!!!!!
But all the other dams in the world...?
Things come against the nature eventually will suffer big consequence
DAM you china I am sorry I’ll go die on a corner
Stop sending us dust china
This channel should be called half as smart.
oh no i have to study 0.00000006 sec... This is so sad Mom This is so long pls
Taiwan is part of China.
I wonder if any important events were impacted by this 60 ns delay. A game winning 3pointer didn’t count because it was 60 ns late. A car accident occurred because someone’s alarm clock was 60 ns late in the morning.
Fuck you that's just dumb
lmao my fcking ass of I call this Bull shit lmao good one good joke the funny part is that there is ppl who believe this sht
China is destroying Earth
By the year 47 650 CE a whole second will be added on to the day but everyone alive today will be dead in about 130 years or so
I just wanna be alive when a day is 1 second longer so that i can sleep for that extra second ????
China will soon start testing nuclear bombs on others land. It is the fiercest imperialist in the garb of communists
This is most absurd thing i ever heard that u can slow earth spin with dam.
*slows
so i wasted close to 5 minutes to learn china will delay earths spin by 1 sec in 40000 years... simply wtf:@
China is rich so they do everything they wanted until one day they’ll get themselves into troubles
Bomb that country
Uhh... Do all the "made in china" things cause trouble to the world?
That's why I wake up very late....... ??????
YYYEEEETE
Hope you realize the magnetic poles have shifted north pole is in Canada and south pole has left Antarctica already...do s video on that because that's fact.
Fuck you China
So its China fault that the earth is slowing down
Brilliant!
i m here to see how this insane China bashing can be pulled off…
What effect does slow rotation have on speed of time?
China number two
Somebody stop them
Damn.
Fook this mate
The earth is flat!!!!
I guess China doesn’t give a dam
You got me at New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Hahahaha...
If they want to slow down the earth they should move all MacDonalds and KFCs to Texas, the shear weight of Americans relocating to the south is strong enough to stop earth. #Fatasses
China number 1
Everything blame China, same with Trump, western Media
Genius at work
Wonder what kinda effect a space elevator is gonna have??
BS
damn china
China has become just like their products
Dam communists
Bsdk dhire dhire bol jara
Trump's great wall will make it slower....
Blame China!!
any credits to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVjGE0bPOhY ???
fucking commies
Damn ...
The speaker speaks so fast i don't even understand what he's saying.
Extra seconds doesn't matters!
Lol
Human beings getting extra time to destroy them self’s (changing earth’s equation)
Lmfao
That’s why I’m angry at night
Click bait
Was that dam MADE IN CHINA ?
Hey China? Why don't you uhh Nuke up that dam right now eh? It's pretty damn hot in here and I would like snow. E H
When you want to complain about something, you can always count on China
China is the reason y i dont get time to do my homework!!! Oh w8 it made day longer ;-;
Relocating 1.2bn pple really???
China rules the world
God damn
Yeah Mr. Half as everything! Yeah science!
I thnk you are mad, the time delay is negligible.
oh dam
?????????
Damn blame china for wasting a nanosecond of our lifetime
Sorry but that's not how that works.
Dam
Clickbait
Dont worry my fart will speed up earth's rotation just point me in the right direction...
Damn big Dam!
more duration of day the more time to melt the glaciers
I love how you seamlessly advertise Brilliant.org at the end of the video. Subscribed!
Earth doesn't move! Use your senses!
Looks like we can do more than we though we were capable of...
Damn
Three Gorgeous Dam
Build a large enough dam and we'll literally fall into the sun
Irrelevant
SO MANY FOOL THINK WITH ASS
Very smooooth. From content to sponsor add. You still get my ????
Please tell me the name of the song in the background from 2min 18secs I have been searching it on epidemic for so long but could not find it anyway very good video thanks
When I hear ¥200,000,000,000 I'm like DAMN or DAM?? Bad puns??
They added 0.000000000000000000000001 second wao idiot.
Seriously wahhh
Anyone wanna sleep longer? Ask CHINA
Dam.
Made in China
More importantly they made the Yangtze dolphin go extinct because of that dam. One of two inland species of dolphin in the world is now gone forever because of the Chinese. What to expect huh?
??right!??
Damn this is a clickbait... next video: how a fart enlarged the ozone hole
4:13 even a fictional phone in a video, yet you need to put a notch on it. but why. that alone make days longer by 1 second.
I was late for because this dam in china. Have you got 4.55 minutes to see a youtube video explaining it? - my boss wasnt having it :|
Damn Chinese
0:22 the other kind of ccp in the lower right corner is on hell of a game development team. They made probably the best MMO of all time Eve online
So is the earth still considered flat ??..........
Who would win. Planetary physics or a load of commie bois?
DAMn
that dam is made in china
Why there is warchamer 40k logo 3:10
Sheep
Fucking Chinese....
Shut up
Damn. What A Dam!
heckin’ China my brethrin
WHO said You cant buy timer?
Ohh i was afraid i had put up on weight but nie i knows its becouse od chinese people
That segue was flawless... "My phone can throw of the earth????... wait it was a transition." Well played.
Ok, now I wanna know exactly wtf they are going to do about fixing it and putting it back the way it was before they started pissing around with my day? Cheeky buggers, making me wait longer for Red Dead Redemption 2...??
What is this bullshit! They should take this channel off yt
So my birthday time is a lie!!??
dont worry guys, it wont last long
china at it again
That ad transition was so smooth
Was there a need to go into China's politics to deliver the main message of this video?
It's an American telling this so this is a lie American say this to start a new war for new jobs for making weapons to sell to Saudi Arabia. We just need to delete them except for Elon Musk. Elon Musk for President of the world, and Vladimir Putin for emperor of the universe, and Kim Jung Un for Lord of the multiverse.
China is ruining the world
He went so smooth to the add
What a pointless waste of time and resources this video is lol
Half as creative.
DAMN
talking wayy too fast bro
God dam that’s a lot of damage
China, they want it biggest/number one
I wonder if Burj Khalifa did anything as such.
Not actually.... Coz Antarctica also loosing huse amount of weigh coz of global warming... It's affecting more than china's dames as comparison... I tnk it's a diplomatic way to represent China as a bad country...
And we should believe this bullshit???
Thats why I hate china
ALL THE DISLIKES ON THIS VIDEO WERE GIVEN BY THE CHINESE ????????
Fuck off China
Now I have to wait longer for Christmas
Dam you future
So watching this video did nothing but waste my 295 secs
Dam it - China, probably
Aye go head china
Fucking china
*lightens the earth rotation, because the time moves fast and we dont notice it
Haha at last I had finish watching this joke.
Dam i was a whole 0.0000006 seconds late for work!!!
Got dam it China!
Little boy and fat man
Dammit... I got clickbaited.
Sunus balayee.. kar kaema kaara!!! ?Shabaash gobur!!
Hey talk a little bit slower ok? Are you late to take the flight?
What can I do with that 60 ns ...? More time spend with wife???
Wow!! Interesting channel.
Is this really true ? I am seeing this in YouTube that's why I am asking
Full time foolish..... You better take about flat earth .. intelligent..
Go metric man
No worries. Nature will balance it.
you western people are privileged in population and etc but countries like China and India are not so we build coz we need not for amusement like u people spend a fortune for old rusty vintage cars u have the liberty we don't and give a official statement of world science forum about your claim.
You should get Nobel prize , it was so interesting that I slept.
Fuck china
damn.
another reason why china is bad for the earth
But the earth is flat
!!! IMPORTANT !!! My fart just enlarged an ozone hole in pur atmosphere. If you want to know more, carry on watching this bulshit! If you believe in this you surely must believe in Smurfs right?
It's unappropriate nd worthless
Sience let me guese its about 000000000003% something you cant feel see or notes or even mesure! Only people with money allooooot of money. Trust me they say its there so it is... ugh...
Shit i am gonna age fast??
youtube should have a drug testing before making a channel??????
So we can made a very big dam and stop this fucking ball of rotation
Baby your time is up
That 0.0000006 sec feels a hour in boring classes. China you are ruining my life
Damn dam where did u get these
THANK YOU CHINA NOW I HAVE LONGER SCHOOL CLASSES????
I think US Hoover dam will compensate some problems created by this dam.
Impossible...
Yo mom so dam big she slowed the earth's rotation as long as you played in sports.
Wasted 5 minutes of my time to find out that i have to work 0.000000006 seconds longer everyday
DamN
Thanks by the WAY China!
Damn fucking china they must die
It should be Russia.
1.2K dislikes are from the flattards that believed this was a myth.
I looked up three gorges dam on google maps and I saw a truck on water!
so that's why last year's winter was so long and why summer was a little bit longer this year.
Thanks China for giving me extra time to catch all my deadline at work.
What a shit !!!! Shut up u clickbait..
Are you in hurry to go to pee?!! Why you speak so fast?
Daammm daniel
Blame China on everything Jk
When i heard the year's number.. I was like.. F.. k you. I'm outta here.. I thought it's something more significant.. It's just ridiculous.. smh
Why to watch a 4:55 seconds videos just for 60 nano seconds?
Kamal Raja
That is daaaamn high
didn't noticed that without this video... let's live like nothing happend ??
Yo mama is so fat, when she woke up from her sleep, the earth's rotation is slowed down
Thats why i love Thanos.
What's the music name ?
Fucking video
Hmm! Should I care?
Use mind.
No wonder school feels like forever
Yesterday i peed facing east , i would have also slowed the earth
Whenever I go to China my eyes automatically tunes in to 16:9
and china your damn mama's are so fucking big that slow earth and please close the dam or U.S gonna FUCKIN DESTROY DA DAMN DAM FOOOOOOL
hey china all country blame you because gorgeous and use ENGLISH MOTHAFUCKA
that new country tho, new zicelosta rahamanda
1m43s So not Northern Ireland?
That is BS...nothing on the earth can't impact the earth. .not even all of earth explosion combined with 5000 tsar bomb
Next thing we know Flash comes and not only does he fuck up the timeline but he also speeds up the rotation by 8 hours
Your intros sound a lot like RealLifeLores videos. ??
???????????? Seriously?? Im sure this guy voted trump..
Actually the theory you are using is depending upon the Earth climate in outside the space this theory does not work
God dam mit china
Dam... No wonder school feels longer than usual.
Breaking news: China causes global warming
after global warming now china?.... how about build wall in mexico border ?,its slow down too?,...
I don't think so, everything we made is coming from earth we are only converting it to other shape
What the fuck is next? How China caused fucking Hawaii to erupt? How fucking irrational! ??
My ears aren't fast enough for this video
You started in China and ended in USA, brilliant.
I just wasted 4:54 of my life
I’m sorry the year 45000? Earth will be gone by then
Thanks china, now my day is 0.00000006 seconds longer ????????
hahahahahahha
I like how no one is taking this seriously. Keep it up China, I can sleep 2min more.
Dam it China Do you get what I did there Me- Please kill me
God dam China for building this dam making school time more dam longer
A full 60 nanoseconds?!? Damn your dam China
There is a Chinese meme:+1s
If only earth spun...
Lol who types Hai
0:14 dam son
What the hell... Everything that changes it's altitude affects earth rotation.... Why blame dam??
That’s a Bull shit dumbass... it really doesn’t matter wether they build or they don’t. Even if they don’t store water it’s gonna go mix in oceans..so it’s gonna be same water weight
India wale like thoko
Now I can sleep for longer thanks to China
Lol blablabla...
Damn china
Dam video
Oh fuck off
Where did u learn your science , who is your teacher , is there any hospital for mentally challenged people near your home ? Plz join there as soon as possible
im so pissed, how dare they make my miserable days longer!
They do not forget new Zealand yea
So, that's why I thought the day was a little longer.
A ridiculous video hahahahah
Is this the reason I feel like seasons are coming a little earlier than usual
???
Damn.
The better iconic duo is shark boy and lava girl
And indians think they are at par with china.... monkeys know ur place alright.....
Dam!
I HATE THE RED MENACE??????
X doubt 60 nanoseconds thats actually quite a lot when you compare earths size with the dam, This has to be fact checked, theres many "science" channels like these on the internet that spew out shit just for views, one channel said how if u detonated a TSAR bomb in the Marianas trench you could split the would in half, fucking idiots.
I don't believe it
I try to accept your differences China. But for God's sake
world need to attack china and distroy it because although this speed reduction in not big deal . But, with the speed they are forcefully diverting waters from tibetian platues is real cause of concern . It is affecting global temprature by changing glacier size. Risking humanity at large scale with these man made blockages. In addtion, they have started large scale minning in these areas near junction of two gaint techtonic plates like eurasia and Indian plate.
Wow this is next level anti china propaganda
How is it making the earth heavier by using resources already used on earth
Damn China ???? dam
Dam u china!
1:43 that’s not Iceland...
Dislike for that ad oh god
well oh dam
2:53 what about the law of conservation of mass?
the earth is flat
Lag
I=MR^2 even if the dam was not constructed , the mass would remain the same. the only fact that acculumated water changed was the centre of gravity of that particular volume and not that of the earth.
Okay, China has to stop this. This is a massive change to human population... WE HAVE TO END THIS!!! THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL!! LAUNCH THE GODDAMN NUKES TRUMP!! WE HAVE TO STOP THIS, ITS RUINING HUMANITY, WE HAVE TO STOP CHINA FAAST!!!
Fuck you moron
Every time a baby is born, it slows the earth by 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of an atom
Wtf!
How you make these videos please tell
Yeah sure let’s start laying blames on each other. America builds no damn and it’s all China’s fault.
A lot of talk.. but can you prove anything you said.
China #1
infographic? is that you?
Pure bullshit no way that dam can slow down the rotation of the earth.
1 sec longer isn't an issue. I've just wasted 10 seconds writing this comment.
Next vid. How China fucked up the atmosphere
I can't think of a good comment
wth but u are taking the resources from earth and building it on earth dafuq
When the water was ice back in the glaciers , it was even farther than the axis of rotation since it was on the mountains which are significantly farther than the ground so how can it slow the velocity , neither a chunk of mass from earth s core has come to surface nor a new asteroid has hit the earth making its periphery heavier than beforw
clickbait
anyone watching this while high?
So literally, they did change the world!
Any big earthquake has much more effect on earth balance and rotation. As been told in the video that dam is really microscopic in size compared to the planet it sits on.
This is yankee propoganda against the peoples republic
Building dam is irrelevant to earth rotation
I have always had a thought: could the sky scrapers and roads we build effect the mass of the earth and change the earths center of gravity?
Yeah it's like when you on the spinny thing at school when you lean out it goes slower but when you lean out in you go fucking speedy fast.
@1:58 why the colour of main river is pink and blue of other river
Mexicans and Indians farting after eating spicy food will eventually make this world uninhabitable.
WHAT THE HELL CHINA YOU SUCK NOW OUR DAY LASTS 60 NANOSECONDS LONGER
fuck you motherfucking cunt
Because it made in China
Useless video
Wow. What a segue to an ad
I stopped walking so will it slow Earth? Well that doesn't make sense so did this DAMN.
I was watching his vedio @ 0.75x and you
It's to control the yang tze flooding.
fucking shit video....
What's proof of info????!
If it is true, then Great wall of china, Burz khalifa , Eiffel Tower & all Buildings on the Earth have how much affect?
dams water cooling earth
How United States freedom of bombing other nations and the impacts of the bombing affect the rotation and course of earth? Pls make that video ya.
I wish every Chinese to die.
We should eliminate china from humanity
I think i got a bit dizzy on that spinning thing
i was not wrong, chinese people are shits
So this is why when you run for your workout, you should always run from east to west, if not, you are fking slowing down the earth rotation. The punishment for not running in the “correct” direction is...drum roll...death (or making a YouTube video admitting you slow down earth rotation).
You spend some much of your time to make a video of 60 Nano seconds??? Great
0.00000006 seconds just slow down the rotation of the earth ?? Thats dam* nothing
Thanks to China I'm never late for class
Donald Trump was right about China. Damn dam makes my college lectures last longer
China all the time, made in China, China china China haha blame them for everything
Oh. Seriously?? I can suggest a new topic " how idiot publisher slow down the earth rotation
Song at 0:01 ??
Song at the start?
China should be nuked
Does anyone really believe this bullshit?
r u kiding with me?
Same goes for cheapest version of china called India ????
Damn China thuglife
New zicelosta rahamanda ??
Really can a dam slow down earth rotation really
This much amount of water storage may cause massive earthquakes
Thank you China I love sleeping 60 nanosec longer
You cant slowe what ain't moving! 6000IQ
Damn
Plz nuke china
china is chicken country just look wisely at their shape of country
Is earth adjust it self
Operation : Anchorage
This video is wastage of time
America: China, you owe this world zero point gazillion zero seconds. POTUS: It's time my fellow Americans we shall free Chinese people from communism and bring them justice and free markets.
We need so much more big dams, they slow down time. that gives us much more time to look for a girlfriend. Thanks
I call bullshit
irrelevant ads inside video
FATASS AMURICANS SLOWING DOWN THE EARTH ROTATION
Damn China.
That waters gross asf
How does one slow the rotation of an object that doesn't move? You fool the sheeple into believing that it did. - The Earth is Flat!
Dam'n' China ????
Fk you.you make me stay awake for 0.00006 second
Earth is stationary.
Do u Know? The dam in China is bigger than earth...!
OMG 6 nanoseconds are really long BLAME CHINA! jk don’t Plz
Interesting, I wonder does the melting of glaciers in alpine areas have the opposite effect?
OH C'MON SRSLY CHINA??? NOW I DIDN'T GET TO HAVE THAT ONE MICROSECOND!!! YOU OWE ME THAT!!!
China is the only country that can breed faster than cockroaches
God damn it China, I'll be 60 nanoseconds late to school.
I Hate China!
Damn you.... Y0u C0py N1nj4s
Blah blah blah...everything is ok!!!
This is a fucking content!!!
Dam you china for making school 0.00000006 seconds longer. Dam you!!!!
clap clap clap Good job China. good job.
I'm Chinese myself but I hate China.
What can't china do?
China must be crushed and destroyed
The amount of fat people in US makes the earth slow.
???? ? ?????
Blame them for daylight savings. Those 60nano seconds add up each day.
How do u weigh the earth?
But how about the large building which are raised all over the world
Next video idea: How a single country the United States made the world fucked up with wars and shit.
DAMn
The Earth is DAMN FLAT! So no DAMN ROTATION!
Pollution
China really needs to learn what they're doing to our earth. Before you know it the world is just gonna die because China has no idea what their pollution is doing to our planet.
Dam son
Damn. Get it?
Who cares with 60nS?
I still cant understand .. Even with my age .. DAM It.. i should go back to Highschool
Haha...this bs knows no bounds.
Can you make a video on if we can change the rotation of the earth
DAMN
4:08 literally the best transition into a sponsored message ever
Yea srfu blame china, just because theres a dam dont mean china slowed the WHOLE WORLD down
What if we blow it up?
Give me a break!! The lamest justification!!!
Because it's the future dams water what Asia is going through biggest water crisis
Is this a TRUMP's Propaganda channel ??
3:20 Arctic ice is not melting, the melting that occurs is seasonal and freezes again when fall-winter return again. In fact, there's more freezing than melting occurring. Lookup the Vostok ice core samples which provided scientific proof that climate change is not human caused. Also lookup how the sun has been radiating less heat since the 90's.
God dam it China
Well Dam
name a more iconic duo: ship and shit
dam...
Just fuck you mom, she said my dick is longer than you grandpa's.
Yes, demolish you dam first.
Well.. this video is kinda stupid, you know. ALL THOSE MATERIALS ARE FROM INSIDE OF THE EARTH. OUR EARTH'S RESOURCES NOT INCREASING OR DECREASING BECAUSE ALL HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. it's never "slowing down earth's rotation". BUT IT MAKES SOME PLACES ON EARTH SINK QUICKLY. Especially the coastal cities The thing that affecting our planet is our population. THE GLOBAL HUMAN POPULATION.
Americans are the Best Storytellers
Damn
How much did the burj kalifa slow is down
So your telling me a dam that can't even be seen from space change the speed of our humongous planet
1:48 New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Skip to 3:07 to realise why you dont give a sod and save yourself 3 minutes
Thanks china ??????
LUL
This is retarded
I see, this is why USA is trying to weaken china, if china is not stopped, they will cause earth to stop rotating and USA will on the darker side, they wil be ruined China is playing music chair with earth
No worry...Superman will encircle earth to reverse it..
More reasons to hate China..
God dam it! That's huge!!
It's 2018 and I just saw a Y U NO!? meme. Thanks for the nostalgia fella
DAMmit china you did it again....
Every rotation changes the earths rotation. This isn't big
China china china china china china. CHINA!
This video should’ve been sponsored by the gorges dam
When your mom goes up stairs the earth will just stop
Now lets count the all atrocities done on humans and on earth by european and american.
So what about skyscrapres built worldwide....the total mass of total skyscrapers should be higher than that single dam
So if we throw away Gallons of ocean waters in space, will our days get any shorter ? #JustAsking Because its senseless to blame someone for building a reservoir too big that it affects the Rotational force of the planet. Common dude, there is Quadrillion + Litres of water in oceans and under the earths surface since ages, that water is only being held in reservoir, logically its just a shift of place of water, not addition to water. No, humans cant produce water, they can just take out from earth or from the oceans !!
They also cooks dogs and cats.!
Such stupidity at it’s best
Please return my 4:55 seconds you made me waste
China has a lot of mats
I don't think this is such a good thing. I remember what happened the last time we had a leap second...
...so it just slowed down the earth a little bit.
DAM YOU CHINA
DAMN YOU CHINA
Just unlike the video before watching
Does nobody know the poles are shifting?
We must have very precise equipment to calculate that. Pretty cool!
Yo Rawanda is a fake country from a film is it not?
Wow, so many numbers
Made in china
Think china for more hour to watch youtube or you mom and you dad more time to do personal stuff
Best video I've seen in a long time
Dam'n
hmm, now i have another thing to blame on china, said donald trump
Dam Chinese Communists
China ruins everything.
This is nonsense
That's a lotta DAMage!!
its always China's fault! as always
now the earth is not 24 hour xd
Made in China
Damn it dam!
Naughty America has slowed down the world development and destroying other nations... Hate you Americans... Hope yu end up in a nuclear war against the enter world..
Trying too hard to make China bad. What a loser
By this logic each time we built something.. we slowed earth?
you fulls air resistance is not supported by earth rotation
This video was made in china
New Zicelosta Rahamanda ??
I knew that there are Chinese Employees here and get paid by the Chinese Government
Thats How They Bring The X Into X': World's Population Will Exceed 9.8B By The Year 2050 And You Won't Be Able To Find A Place To Eat, *_That Is Why, GREENE HOTDOGS Always Opened For You!_* No Matter, 1990 or 3000, WE THINK FAR BEYOND!....................................................(For Eternity)
Whatever CHINA Does!!! . . . (Great Appreciation From PAKISTAN)
Is anyone gonna say it ? I will. Your transitions to your sponsors are so damn good.
Dam,that sum big dam A truly bad joke
0:19 rap god
China did what.
This is nothing but bullshit
china is hecc
And one of the dam of China broked and now the water is entering India
if the US do this it should be OK.
100% bs
This video is meaningless
Really? Lol. Hahhahaa
China is most cunt nation after USA.what do you think guys???
Sad
So I just flushed my toilet, how much does that affect the earths rotation?
Okay!
I did a double take at 3:08 when Warhammer 40000 appeared.
A dam to slow down the earth’s rot? A downright stupid idea with absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever
D A M I T C H I N A !
DAM-mit china thats why my school hours are more S L O W E R
China is like a pussy
It applies to anything but Fuck China anyways.
The fact is only that china produces that enormous amount of electricity from one single dam
How much didn't he human race as a whole effect the earth's rotation
What the fuck is China doing I call this the Cold War
Hrm, Australia Australia dig up 817,000,000 of iron ores alone, from somewhere deep (I mean really deep), I wonder how much that slows earth
At least I got more times for sleep.
We need to nuc india and china to increase Population.
Title china massive dam slows down the earth rotation Maybe it could slow down 1 hours so 25 hours a day?????? the earth slows down 0.000006 seconds Are you fucking kidding me??
Damn you china HAHAHA??
Hey I live in New Zealand
thanks to china we have longer school days
Dam son
Damn china
die later! grow slower!
lol
How Chinese killing my country economy and my race
Damn China
This is why we must to find new earth real quick
Daaaaamn
dahmmmmm
Really???
Welp time for. More earthquakes earth we need some to speed ur ass up
Guys, who played Command And Conquer Generals?
This is rubbish. Where does all materials needed to build the dam came from? None other than from planet Earth unless it came from other planet.
“A WHOLE SECOND!” That’s a whole Ariana Grande sweetener song WOW
China, a great nation
Would it slow the Earth's rotation if every human living in a multi-storey building went upstairs?
Is it taking an affect on gravity?
No king
just fu all
Your mamas so fat that she moves the Earth's rotation when she comes down the stairs!
Im irish
Dam!
STOP CHINA
Ha ha ha ha west agenda to dethroned the east development....what the fuck is this...
....LET DESTROY THE DAM!!! Also me: let not.
7 million people also is slowing down earth
thanks china ??
Wow that was a smooth transition!!
Wow so dam crazy
I know a better duo Nagasaki and Hiroshima
What crap! I thought this channel had some rationality. It also has become a click bait.
China hacked the planet rotation speed.
Look at all the stupid morons who believe the earth is spinning a 1,000 mph. This video is more brainwashing for the stupid masses.
Dam
why im watching this xD
Blame China For Causing something Nobody cared.
Key question, who cares...
Only 1 second..in thousand of year..and u bloody fool wasted 4 mins
China no, taiwan yes
You are so daft if you believe this video. Whoever made this video needs punched in the face for being so stupid. Physics does not work that way .
I THOUGHT INDIAN POPULATION SLOWED THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH..
HOT DAMN
God damnit
I mean why tf not
Easy, Chuck Norris
please tell me.please !!! witch video aditor you use.from ??Pakistan??
This made me more younger by 000000006 seconds
GODDAMIT CHINA!! Sorry ??
NOOOOOOOO LONG SCHOOL DAY WHY!??????????????????
I BLAME CHINA BECAUSE THEY MADE THE DAY LONGER FUCK EM
I thought the earth slowed down because of the drag caused by the reservoir thingy.
Damn.....
But how is it gonna make it heavier when the materials was already on earth???
Why don't we just destroy China all country vs China how bout Dat China who win now beach
so dam crazy
Fuck China
yo, why dont we do this build more of those that it would drastically slow the earth down and we can live so much longer bc a day would last longer.
So don’t join chinese projects it’s bad for environment. Say no to xitler Belt and road project ! It will do more harm then good.
Damn
If we keep building big stuff, we will slow the rotation down by a lot
Checkmate, flat-earthers
The dam is dam big.
chuna is a bull shit country
I knew the day feels so "slow" buts you dont notice it if your a gamer
fuck it.my life already fuck up.fuck u dam
??????,??????????
It's not a DAM BIG DAM. It's a DAMN BIG DAM.
stupid...even superman cant stop rotation of earth
made in china huh
3:06 ????,?????
1:44 Iceland does not look like that wth why'd u squish it???
There is a Chinese website translated the comment section. And we Chinese can make comments on it. I am just saying, we are watching.
100 thousand percent wrong concept.
Russia: tanks driving on highways . USA stopping terrorist and looking good while doing it . China:
Dam it China
Seriously dude...
"This channel isn't about thoughtful geopolitical discussion" - proceeds to talk about politics...
DAM YOU , CHINA !!
You lost my interests at explaining the Chinese Congress. Can we leave politics out of a science show?
nope
Dam My country and Brazil made one of the largests dams
I shouldn’t of watched this stoned
china hospitals you owe me 0.00000006 seconds more before i die btw im not from china
why are we complaining thats nothing
Patanjali DAM!
Wow, China gave me enough time to jizz my pants
w aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
Damn you China! I missed class by 0,00000006 seconds??
Earth will slow down its rotation..... Already mention in my book ... Which i read.....1400 years ago... THE HOLY QURAN.. ALLAH HU AKBAR...
Really?
Look on the bright side, if the earths rotation slows then we’ll be lighter because gravity will be less.
Literally building anything upwards slows the earth
DAMN IT
Oh my lord, that segue near the end almost made me vomit...
Suck my dick
I can smell Bill Wurtz in this video
It's fine, we all are going to die anyways.
so dam crazy
the dislikes maybe is from china viewers and with that 60 nanosecs i could kill 1 more pubg player or win a pvp in minecraft
???ig dam
Dicks big dick
Dammit china
haha how china slow earth go and answer how this simple my questions
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
That's northern Ireland not Ireland
Dam thats big
Thanos: lets make it balance
So they used your mom as a dam?
to be honest, i think it made it faster..... the day goes by so fast where i live...
Dam I did not see that coming
??
****China has one dam boye*****
Dam.
Lol! I've dived off that board 2:37
Now blame China for slowed the Earth's Rotation? Why don't Y'all do something about it?
Dam son.
smooth plugin transition
The reason we Indians won't in hell want to be friends with China, they are too racist and selfish and harming other people and even chinese people is fine!
We should remove china from the earth
The only physics lesson i understand
Just a note it wasnt 200B dollars it was 200B Yuan which is like 30B dollars
Later, we can travel back in time, all you do is try swimming in the dams in China !
Cats use the same technique to land on feet
Dammmm
Good scientific video but politically biased. Insignificant change
The real question is how china slowed your brain massive dam theory
So what about USA hoving a damn to kyoto protocol and contributing to being the largest air polluter via automobiles????
Daaaaaaaamm dam
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
And those idiots are thinking about space elevators. .. (face palm)
Damn you China! Shakes fist
Lmao my stupid ass thought we slowed the Earth's rotation by like 1 hour
Why is this video blaming China for just 60 nanoseconds?
fight me des pa and cito
I don't care I repeat I don't care
fuck you china you alowed it down now we have less time to live
1:45 aye I hear the Bahamas ????????
DAMN
the materials that they built with are from earth so it would make no difference in the mass of the earth
.______________?
Dam, China. You flipped us off
Dam that sponsor transitiin was good.
I knew it I noticed some change.
These asian monkeys are fucking everything up
Dam shit
China should give up some of it's land so China wouldn't need to build the damp for so many people.
Umm excuse me? Ok jk, even though I’m from China (though I don’t live there) I care it slows down the earth but at the same time not really, and I don’t decide weather to build a dam or something, it’s the government that makes these choices, so I can’t just tell the government to stop making dams. Though I don’t really care
3:10 wait do warhammer 40k just went up by 7 millennia, when did that happened??????
60 NANOSECONDS!??! inhales CHINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
0.00006 extra seconds of school
I don't give a DAM
That Iceland now that's beautiful
Those Chinese made life worth again
This dam made my class 60 nanoseconds longer.
double pump.
SHUT IT DOWN
Dude, i hate this kind of fantasy. It's not scientific ?? U really need to learn physics
Well China ty so much for this. Now I won’t know if the time is the same.
0:14 Any percy Jackson fans here ..dammm
this is bunch of bullshit vsauce said that even mt everest is nothing but a bump of 0.2mm if earth is 1ft globe and you are saying 90m damn change the rotation lol dumbass twat disliked
GOD DAM
1like = 1 hate to China 1 comment = fuck China
great... now this world will be slower... I FUCKING WANT TO GET OUT FROM MATH CLASS
Kainis ka china ka
if Earth's rotation slows down, Technically we'll live longer
if Earth's rotation slows down, Technically we'll live longer
I want my 4:54 minutes back.
Just nuclear China for no problems
Blame China!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Dam. That's Quite Big!
Most Chinese Tourist's are Disrespectfull to National Monuments. Its Just my Opininon though
Soon we gonna have 29 hours per day....
This looks like a bill wurtz video
Can I believe this guy?
Fuck 60 more nanoseconds of school
Thank you China I'll age slowly now!
Made in China Intenfies
Damn
DAM CHINA
THANKS CHINA
Show this to flat earthers
I save 0.00000000000000000000006 seconds and lose +300 seconds to this vid
Damn this video is good
Dam son
No wonder I stay in school longer
0:32 that shoutout to Wendover tho, kudos to you!
Extra Thicc A$$ = Slow AF Rotation
So since the polar ice caps are melting in the future days will be way longer
does this mean school is a few nano seconds longer?
The "dam" is so big amirite?
Earth doesn't rotate, its just a theory that's wrong. It's never been proven that the earth rotates ever! Michealson Morley experiment proved that it doesn't. So this video is wrong and misleading
4:09 Subtle, my friends. Subtle.
PROPADAMDA
I picked up my phone to look at brilliant but the earth slowed down
I’ll name a better duo strawberry’s and nails
Shit I was born in 2004
What else is China to blame? Climate change?
Nice war hammer refrence
Is it a god dam?
So that's why I was late that one day. China slowed the Earth's rotation down. Wait, I would be on time...
- Its time to sleep Jimmy. + No dad! I still have 0.000000006 seconds!
now i have to be in school longer! DAM YOU CHINA
Oh no, 60 nanoseconds, i can sleep that much longer.
What did the fish say when it hit a wall? "Dam!"
Sans undertale
Oooo i think the “rod and ring” prophecy where it says “the belly of the dragon will drip water”... yeah. This.
Dam...
Jealousy
The dam did not cost $200 million. It cost close to $20 billion
Typical low IQ western media,Even Newton can't save you .You should go back to school and study classical physics for a few more years.
Huge population from west China moves to East China every year, guess that accelerates the rotation of earth a little bit.
Dayum
dam it
Bruh, you didnt lie when you said shit memes
Daaaaaam
It's easy It's a country that's why
Thx china!! Now we have to stay in school x4 now!
:C how dare you i live in it
??amn
fuck china!!! jk:)
So if it doesn't affects us then why am I watching this.
nooooo a extra second!!!
f**k you china
What kind of idiot would believe a dam can slow the rotation of the earth ? Who thinks this stuff up LOL
If China slowed time speed, we get free extra time
Even if 60 nano seconds...they managed to sloe down earth, bet the chinease will make another one bigger
fucc china
Dam it was big
They built the dams so our vietnamese people don't have water for water our crops
That dam's size is too DAM crazy
Please cite your sources, it would make the verification process of the informations validity far more convenient.
Finally i can sleep 0.000006 longer
I am messing with the Earth's rotation by jumping up and down!!
The pun in the beginning...
Dam son.
How about wakanda?
Wow just wow
Cone on how to defeat a pun By a. Damn pUNishment HOLY SHEEIIEIIIT
Brazil has a better dam
made in china
I guess we can just blame everything on China and that make things easier
the power of communism
That's why Indonesia had many earthquakes nowadays. e.g. Lombok, Palu etc.
a cup of water can slow the Earth's rotation too! by a very little bit.
BEWARE!! BECAUSE THIS IS MADE IN CHINA
HOLY S***T
2 iconic duo : Logan Paul - Dead Body
sorry I did not know we did that I'm chinese
really china
WOW
So china is making my school days longer? GOD DAMMIT!
So when a feather drop, the earth's rotation will slow
China a threat to world??
wow so smart... first of all dam with floating solar more efficiency eco friendly. 2nd more fresh water. 3rd more fresh water fishes.4 your mom are 1 of the reason why the earth slow down by 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 s
The only time China made something and it extended the longevity time.
INFINITE SPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNN (yes, this IS a jojo reference)
the most stupid and illogical video ever.
So you reckon the Earth Spins..........really........you silly people.......
The moon is a spaceship idiots
Damn, that's a big dam.
Should be called half of this is an advertisement.
*A youtuber stops the korean war* *china slowed the rotation of the earth* the world is weird af
Dam china
YOU NIBBA BLAMING CHINA
now i can complete my homework since the day is 60 nano seconds long
Wow we have found the biggest FUCKING complainer ever WOW ONLY A 0.00000006 DIFFERENCE WOW YOU SUCK
U wot m8
New Zicelosta Rahamanda What a country
THE COMMUNISTS ARE TAKING OVER THE EARTH'S ROTATION
I mean at least he acknowledged that the memes are severely outdated?
Hella good Segway my dude
all i have to say is...dam
Dam, theresa lot of dam jokes about dams.
will dislike any video with "feet"
This dam was in the world war z book
thanks china for the problem you create.... we all love you....NOT!!!!!!!!! lol......
damn son
So smooth segue
So our average day 1 hour back then? Love the world.
Fucking China Why is it always China causing Earthly problems??
A N I H C
this video was not true what so every -_- what was the point of this!?
I guess they do give a dam, and a pretty fucking big dam at that.
So, china messing with the poles and inertia is fine, but I cant buy a straw in California. Dicks.
The 67% approval rate was considered insanely controversial only because in China any government proposal requires two thirds of the delegates to vote yes to be approved. That's 66.7%. 67% is dangerously close.
I blame china for the fact I have to wait longer for my birthday! I'm gonna sue....
Us watching this video slows the Earth's rotation :D
Chinese Dragon Intensifies
But is this good or bad
Dam, that's bad. Water they thinking in when the installed this thing.
Dude, these Chinese are some damn Heretics!
???
Funny that HAI has half as many subscribers ??????
Stop blaming China for 1 second when people play fortnite for 1year
Does this mean that a damn dam is the reason that all of our lives just got 0.00000006 seconds longer?
damn, that's interesting haha get it
Well he spoke fast
0.00000 WTF Why is this a big deal.
give me my 4.14 minuts of my life beck
1:47 it should be united Ireland because em unionists are as scum
well f*** china I WANT TO BE 15 ALREADY!!!
Blaming china for less than a second? I find it pointless to even waste your time blaming them ??
Guys, go check a channel called Tahirtoo saucy. I won't say anything else (don't want to spoil it)
so, if i stand up the earths rotation slows down?
Man you talk fast!!
Im playing game of war but this one player keeps kicking my ass
What about skyscrapers and high buildings
Dirty closed eyed people who can’t drive small penis bitches.
china a good place to get sick
SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda sound awesome!
Enough for Trump to blame China again ??
Oh come on now school get more time
Waganda shit is this
Dem China u guys are...
good job jackass you'll destroy us
Who would win: >A Planet with it's powerful natural force. Or > one dam boye?
Now I know why my salary is always late by 0.8nano seconds
You have Chinese viewers you know "their energy"
Dam it China
Thanks China ? (Seriously)
When you have a test tomorrow and you don’t have time to study so you slow down the day/night cycle
+1s
So The Earthquake On Indonesia Was Earth Trying To be Faster? RIDICULOUS
AAAAGGGGHHHHHH! rotational dynamics! They followed me to youtube! Noooooooo!
If china is gonna build MORE DAMS
So we steal 0.1 nanoseconds and earth take 1sec back by earth quake? ??
How west criticize others but totally ok doing bad thing themselves.....
You better learn some mandarin. You reading this comment. You got maybe 20 years at best. Should be enough time though.
Well, not that much effect on earth or china
Dam what have you been smoking, dam sure its dam exquisite and dam expensive dam......dam........dam.
Earth : Too Much People ! China : You Want More ? Sure !
Really? 60 nanoseconds China. :/
Too many puns
gahd-DAM
China is destroying the world!
I am surprised that the compass in the 3:18 is not made in china.
Feet.. Pound.. Wtf.. Everyone is using Metric's System.. just 2 Idiotic states are thinking they do not need it but still rely fully on the metric system..
Slow earth but when search it on google earth its just a dot on the screen
but china has low gravity.
Let's be real, do we really need China
Huh didn't except this video too be so funny and memetastic
DAMMIT CHINA
I'd rather have 60 seconds in a day then this freaking earth is spinning too fast!! This earth needs to slow down!
They were trying to stop it from flooding. How about not building a city in a flood plain?
Wow china you`re so great Hope Trump Nukes your country FUCK CHINA HEIL AMERICA TRUMP AND HITLER
One damn power 1.5% of the world largest economy sound crazy too me.
That smooth transition tho
i-i didnt remember h.a.i being this memey
will that dam fit in my civic?
God dam it china.
4:10 when he tried to reel us in the sponsor was smoothness level 9000
Wendover/HAI is so buttersmooth (evidenced by ad transitions), that I hope he never enters the same room as my significant other.
You know what's brilliant? That transition.
Oh dam
If children went to the North Pole to find santa they need to move a few inches to find it
Hmmmmm no wounder why China and North Korea are friends ??
China why would you do this to us?
earth weighs 1million septillion pounds or whatever better get working out girl
China op please nerf China idea
with that much energy you could power like 77.916 trillion hair dryers.
Yeah I felt the change.
Not going to mention that it runs at about 47% capacity?
Hecking dam China
Take that flat earthers.
Where is that thing at 3:41
i like this guy
Thank you China, very cool.
So what you gonna do for that 0.00000006 seconds in a day? I feel my IQ has been insulted.
Don't remember northern Ireland being the whole island of Ireland
well dam
I laughed at the warhhamer 40k logo popping up hahahaha
Whoops here the pjo fans come. Dam, they really reach the vast reaches of the Internet, don’t they? Wait, in pjo canon didn’t Hermes invent the Internet? Oh gods, IM INFECTED! SCHIST SCHIST SCHIST!!!
That segway though...
China is building a bigger dam in Yarlu Tsangpo river. Nice.
I love how everything china does is ridiculously scrutinized but the west can literally burn the planet down and everybody just shrugs.
Damm. It China
A more iconic duo you say? Franz ferdinand and opentop cars
The earth is toooo big and heavy to change becuase a a dam
We're updating the servers after all of this rotation changes.
Oh no an extra 1 second
Does getting a boner slow down the Earth's rotation?
sorry but i could only here 20% of your words
Fatty Americans are also slowing down our rotation, by means of shifting the mass center of the earth with their weight
Dam that was a good sponsor transition!
2:08 Why is there between two spaces four zeros?
Damn China!
Nuke China a million times who cares of they attack us just nuke'em
I bet that the Chinese government will use this as propaganda.
Dam.
Child: My day at school is longer >:v
I want to go to that dam and but c4's and explode it xD
Let's make New Zicelosta Rahamanda a real place!
dam
Lol at this video
the dam is FAKE cuz its “made in china”
I can’t think of an original joke about dams Dam it
After all it is "Made In China"
so this is why days seem longer these times
how Chinese makes the earth!we made out of u or
deez puns are so dam hard
Badchina
3:10 dat nerdout
Wtf china i thot u build fake company instead of dam damn it
Dam.
Dam Son
Damn nice vid
So it wasn't only the artificial satellites that slows the rotation.
If water on one side of the dam goes up.. then the water on the other side goes down rite? What's the point of the video..??
HOW A CHINESE DAM RUINED MY SLEEP SCHEDULE (storytime)
“New zealand and ireland”(shows northern ireland
Tf
This comment slowed down Earth by very very very tiny bit
ok, this was bullshit.
China's dam is meaningless compare to the moon and our magnetic field effects and slowing down our planet
One word: Oof
All we had to was the Follow the dam train!cj!
DAMn YOU CHINA!!!!
Damn this videos are about dam
Dam it, china
What is the scientific basis of this video?
ok, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
China... Ur dam is soo dam crazy just like ur dam as country(I’m chinese but who cares about China)
Hehehe... dam

Fuckin China, some one kill the dragon.
When I Scrolled Down The Recommended Section I Read........How China Swallowed The Earth...????????
if the earth stopped sudenly we would all be killed by inertia
Dam it China, but don't build another dam.
This China do when it sees a river? Damn it...
Is it enough to make leap years redundant

Well dam
Damn it Jin Yang!
Now school lasts longer
You can always rely on China to ruin everything
A dam slows the rotation of the Earth ?? Pmsl! What a load of bollocks!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Is this bad? If so, Damnit China
Oh my fucking Q. Corporate shill! Just put a fucking banner on the video, why don't you?
wait, guys lets dig a massive ass crater in the ground, i wanna die faster pls
I'm from China. Now I know why we built that dam in the first place. We do so to screw up the accuracy of GPS so that US can't strike their missiles as accurate as before :) But serious though, it's kinda a project that's only become a thing because it was during the time when China went too lefty in the concept of socialism but didn't consider the morality of things enough (as such the design of the dam is said to be a bit faulty but being pushed to production anyway, and not enough thought is being put into all the negative environmental consequences, and up till today in China it's still something people point at and say "damn, put more thought next time"). However, there's still one valid reason that the dam should exist. China has the kind of weird geographical sturcture that the whole country is being split up into 3 stages, aka there are giant waterfalls splitting all the rivers into segments, and having a dam could extend the ferry line deeper into the continent. Basically it's good for industry as it's just awkward to land transport everything to Shanghai before being able to ship them out.
so. much. incorrect. data.
thankq china, now I can sleep more
Is this even a problem while American pumping water into the ground to get oil and burning those oil all together?
Eliminate China
Thanks China.
Damn china making me stay in school for 60 nano seconds more, smh.
Don’t really see what is the big problem, but I guess we’re blaming China as always ????
Dam it china
dankzte ???iver
how about sky scrapers, thousands of them, pyramids?
Dam
This is the swiftest shift from topic to ad i have seen in HAI.
If everyone in China bent over and farted at the same time, in the same direction the combined thrust could either speed up or slow the earth’s rotation as well.
Dam it
60 NANOSECONDS?!?! HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!
Wow we have longer days. First the world was going to end in 2012 now this. We're going backwards.
I just knew it became an ad because his voice's tone changed.
Stop talking s*** about China. It's not nice and you know that China has had enough from western verbal bullies.
god dam it.
1:44 that is not the shape of Island
Damn China!
should ban all dam then....probably already cost us almost a miNute ...????????
smooth segway like linus xD
Build more dams until we're immortal!
Bull Fucking Shit!
Still china 1#
1 second over 46k years who cares
That wasn’t very cash money of you china
Lol Damn.....
This probably explains why I feal sleepy and board
I find it funny who people waste billions on shitty things
Anyone waiting for war, add that dam to your nuke list
That wasn't very cash money of china
New Zicelosta Ranamanda
M e m e
Yo mean if I stand from my bed, i slow down the earth rotation? Yea, I have a global effect! I'm important now!
Shut Up , the earth is still and static so stop misleading people
I'm gonna miss those 60 nanoseconds, coulda used them for something valuable... China, WHYYYYYY
That's a lotta dam-age
I will never be able to predict when the slide into the promotion comes...
This is the most click bait title, but it is so accurate at the same time.
Probably
let me guess...... it changed by 5 millimeters per month or something :P stop the clickbait
0:43 “… damn big dam.”
every part of this video is a 10/10
soooo basically https://youtu.be/-6Q3W3Y7YdY
Didnt know you could put the axis powers to this video
No, that was the beavers.
Oh no! One more second of Only War!
these damn communists keep destroying shit first the soviets with the 4rth largest lake and now this shit
So that’s why 1+1=2
This is like how teachers over react about shit
proof that global warming is a scam
DAM SON! Get it? Get the pun?
Bad map downvote
Hi the thumbnail is inaccurate, the Earth rotates counter-clockwise not clockwise
How many Boeing 747s would fit into it
This video is brilliant .org
Omg I feel sorry for ypure parents ur so pathetic
the clickbait was strong in this one....unsubbed till you start making good videos again
yay Ireland my favourite Country I live there
Damn you china! You're messing up my schedule!!
I Disapprove
Red Hot Chili Peppers plays "How a massive dam in china slowed the earth's rotation And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication"
time taken for half as intresting for making a video making the video - 1 week finding a brilliant trannsaction from the vidio to the 'brilliant' ad - 1 month
DAMn
I love how you sell your ads??
3:09 UP for that Warhammer 40K reference!
Dam it China. I had to
But why do i feel like times is going faster????
Okay...we need to speed up the earth so on the count of three...everyone flush the toilet
we must start war against china
0:45 America and lawn mower accidents
Are you mad?.... As in insane. I think you might be.
No it didn’t
I was half interested in watching this video.
Damn that dam slowed down earths rotation......damnnnnnn
0:41 dam T H I C C dam
Holy shit that ad transition!
What if we can blow up the Moon?
Slower earth rotation means more and more earthquakes
This is why I hate CHINAH, they make cheap rippoffs.????????
How watching at the clickbait title of this video made me question the existence of humanity
This video was exactly on the channel name HALF AS INTERESTING
Damn
damn
China namba wan
4:10 One of the smoothest segues i've ever come across!
so they fucked up time and it still hasnt been fixed?
a better duo than a dam big DAM THE HARDY BOYS!!!
wait WHAT!?!?!?
Finally, febuary is fixed (kinda)
China is going to stop earth rotation ????????????
Fuckin china man thank you i have 9 Nanoseconds of extra time on my homework
In the grimdarkness of the future, days are one second longer.
Danm
Trim a little off the top of Mount Everest. You're welcome.
China seems to always be trying to bend the rules of the earth
Propaganda video.
Dam, that's powerful
I had no idea that the South Pole moved every year
It's amazing how a dam is able to slow the rotation of the earth
DAM.....
The dam is dam big And yeah China you owe me 0.000001 second of my life
Hentai & Lolicon.
This liberal crying about 0.8 change. What a betamale
Dam it China!
Goddamnit China.
Well done China
Dam China. Now u make a fake earth today.
It is not possible to slow it down no matter what
Dam, I want my 60 nanoseconds back.
I like how Half as Interesting videos are Twice as Interesting as other videos.
60 whole nano seconds how are you ok with this thats like an extra million hours on monday
Dam it China
This is how western people keep to blame China everyday.
So fucking damn dam Lmao
This is bullshit,we would die if that happened everything is in the perfect place at the perfect time ,Idgaf what this fuck says
And that's how beavers destroyed destroyed world
I think Chinese disliked the video.....:):)
-_-
Well I be damned. When I heard china can control the earth's rotation speed, it felt like my world slowed down.
GODDAMIT HOW ARE YOUR TRANSITIONS SO SMOOOOOTH
GOD DAM IT!
What the actual shit
does burg khalifa affect these thing too?
Slow earth was a great problem.. Taliban finally solved it by destroying world trade centers...
Fuck china
so china make your day became longer?
Stop talking through your asshole. Do you know why there are more white man who got cancer compare to other race ?
60 nanoseconds slower per day, by just one single dam? thats dam crazy ;P
Stop blamin china
For a second, i thought the title said "How A Massive Damn China Slowed the Earth's Rotation"
Wish I was half as original
dAm
I haven't watched the video and I already knew the Three Gorges dam was the answer.
2:02 My OCD cannot look at this very poorly made standard form. Should be 3.785*10^14.
Pandas are cunts
From stealing lands they don't own and now slowing down Earth's rotation? Wow. I'm not surprised at all.
What a nice transition to the advertisement!
Another great 'Brilliant' segue.
DAMmit China!
I'll be DAMned!
1:41 That's my Home Kia Ora from Aotearoa NZ ??
??all these comments....well if you dont understand dont critisice it
The earthquake in Japan in 2011 sped up the earth, so it's all equalised
Retarded video made by retards.
Dam! No wonder those staff meetings have seemed longer lately.
hey he mentioned my country looks like i'm famous now
Fuck u china
60 Nanoseconds Damn
Damnnnnn
i call bullshit on this YouTube video

What did the salmon say when it hit a big fat wall upstream? DAMMMMMmmmm...
1:46 That’s a map of the Maldives.
these dam chinese engineers and their dam machinations....
Your full of shit
Bullshit
Great video! Just to let you know the dam cost 200 billion yuan but only $23 billion dollars
my fart slowed a fraction of Earth rotation
Definitely the most entertaining video to date, love the information, jokes and delivery. This channel is fast becoming one of my favourites!
"Sub to Wendover instead" haha
0:38-0:40 what a NI????A
0:13 DAMMMNNN
Goddamit China
Dam that's a lot of time
Thank you subscribe
Just found this channel and damn is this good.
FUCK U CHINAAA DAMMM UUUU GO TO HELLL YOU ASSS HATTED DICK WADSSSS
Build another one in USA. Problem solved.
Dam China!
1000 comment!
Dam the Dams for the Damn Chinese Dam-makers!
China does all the worst things to the Earth while America gets all the blame
Isn't the earth titled on its axis by 23 degree??
Thanks China!
If you were using memes you should of just said some damn thicc dams
i hate china
How A Massive Dam in China Slowed the Earth's Rotation How A Massive Dam in China Slowed Our Rotation
Dumb communist
1:48 yay a new country!
Fuckin china??
When will they succeed in stopping the Earth's rotation completely?
WELP MORE TIME WASTED IN SCHOOL
every single movement on earth has an effect on the earth's rotation. even your mum going up some stairs or honestly even an ant moving up an anthill slows the earth's rotation.
But the materials were already on the earth
Useless. Especially since the earth does not rotate, anyway.
Thanks China.
Dam Daniel
3:08 Warhammer 40k!
so thats why school takes so long
And the nobel price to the smoothest ad integration ever goes to...
United States: “We have a volcano that can cause a global depression”. Russia: “We have the largest nuclear arsenal on the planet”. China: “We created a dam so large, it slowed the rotational speed of Earth”.
All of these videos are him making bad jokes for 50% of the video and not getting to the point for 80% of the video. lol.
That segue, god dam. You're getting better at taking two seemingly completely unrelated topics and seamlessly transitioning between them. It's kind of scary.
China is stopping the earth from going yeeticus Maximus and my days are getting longer. They should be yeeticus maximused off the earth
Only on channels like these would someone find a way to segue from angular momentum into a brilliant.org sponsor... thanks HaI.
Fuck China and their abducting people and putting them into ‘re-education camps’. Bunch of fuckin assholes, they are.
good point. every time you take a shit, you literally accelerate the earth's rotation.
god dam
DAM
Come on, China! 0.00000006 seconds? What’s wrong with you?! My life will never be the same because of those 60 extra nanoseconds ruining my day.
This some sorta hidden apple commercial? saw 3 different apple devices
Sources for this? The only websites I can find that support this are pop-science websites, no actual papers written on it. Seriously, this sounds very dubious. The the tides on the ocean move more water around than this dam holds back.
Dam it China.
WWW on social media USA: let's comment something stupid to him China: WOT DA USA: BLOCK Continue? NO
Should I give a dam about this dam information?
Dam, China. Ruining it for everybody else by making our days longer.
Stupid china!
I thought the only thing China slowed down was the highways
These stupid communists are bad for the Earth!!!!!!!
Dam that's weird
It just astounds me that humans have the capacity to shake the world with our shit :|
but I think that time loss could be negligible compared to all water which is melting in the top of the highest mountains
i didn't saw the transition to the add coming. It's the best one yet!!
When the dinosaurs were around, a day was 23 hours.
Jean Claude Van Dam
Nice job China
This is basically RTGame by in real life
Nobody gives a Dam!
I blame China for longer dats
something something vsauce something
Making those puns makes this channel half as interesting
No it didnt. Fucking Fake news
Then why isn't Everything on Slow Motion HUUHHUHHHHHH???????
those dirty commies
So if we make a space elevator we will make days longer
Dam
Dam
Dam.. he really made me feel important at the end there...probably just because i'm fucking fried right now
So if we all fart at once in the same direction can we make our days go faster?
God dam it china
2:08 I like how the billions digit has four zeroes :)
God dam it china
Dam. That may have been your silkiest segue yet.
YAY NZ GOT MENTIONED.
Editor truly outdid themself this time. This video was cuhrazy!
Technically, just accelerating your car in the direction of Earth's rotation slows it down. Just not measurably.
That was a smooth transition to the sponser.
Damm China
They probably learned from Brilliant and Wix
Wow, you completely butchered the great and eternal leader's name. You're on a list now. And everyone who watched this video. Death of Stalin anyone? :)
ty dam! i live in new zealand
They don’t give a dam about the earths rotation
fuck you chine give back my time
WAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
Ok
Man u re even more dumb than Trump! This is hilarious! LMAO Thanks for make me laugh,
I did this case study with my geography class and this video was more informative in 10 minutes than my teacher did in 2 years.
Damnit that´s one damn big dam!
Duck hunt duo.
Will there be a dam built to slow the earth’s rotation by 18493858839204968848271656585992874747829 minutes?
Bullshit
isn't is enough for America to invade China???? opps..... sorry, its China not Iraq....
Dam it China, yet again you just can't be normal!
You guys are dumb if you believe this shyte.
China:*DAMN* Earth slows down
god dam!
A brilliant person DOES NOT pay for intelligence.
The phone used in the ad at the end has a piece of screen missing.
Smooooth transition
that transition to sponsor tho slowclaps
Dammit china ya did it again Most polluted then most populated now this?
Dam son
okay time to put my phone down for today
Ok so when I jump I slow the earth down and cause the earth day to be .000000000000000000000006 nano seconds longer
Sounds like the effects can be worse than climate change...
What the fuck is wrong with this channel..!!???
U r fucking genius
Nice segway
0.00000006 , no one gives a shit bro There are many factors speeding the earth's rotation this is no exception.
fucking china dude how could you do this to the people after 1261531712362 year u killed our (grand grand grand x 7432877) children
There's an extra 0 in the weight of the Earth in pounds...

That’s not Ireland that’s Northen Ireland its a part of the UK while the other part of Ireland is not part of any thing.
I love the Warhammer 40,000 reference!
3:20 thank god that compass is made in Germany not China??
The memes man im crying
Thanks China I can know sleep 0.00000006 seconds longer
Elevators have counterweights .
How dumm do you have to be to say this
Opinions vary, but the Chinese do give a Dam!
God damit China
F*** ME THOSE NANOSECONDS ARE SO DAM LONG SCHOOL IS TOO LONG BECAUSE OF DAM CHINA
How the fuck
I know it says the sounds are from “epidemic songs” but does anyone know the specific song at 2:10?
Damn. Dam.
Wait, was that about ecological damage?
So the Dams are responsible for making my day longer FUCK DAMS!!
I comment just to see 900 comments
Smooth ad
The fact that he voices memes and jokes with a generic-ass voice just adds that tad bit of humor that is funny for no reason at all
3:55 that's San Vicente Reservoir in San Diego county it's like 5 min from my house, they just made the dam bigger on top of the old one. It's really cool how they did it
Hey, you just breaking billions of china peoples heart you have to paid it! #Just kidding
So since a day is longer China reduced the world life expectancy...
lol china, "a more developed nation" still eats dogs, bugs and shark fins. seems like a 1st world country.
No wonder, school feels longer. Bloody China making it slower. Dam it China, I will no longer be asian. I will now identify as a extraterrestrial being. Fuck this shit.
Say... that brilliant link for the first 200. You've been using it for alot of your videos. And still no 200 free loaders?? Brilliant.org must not be so interesting then ;-) or worse... free brilliant courses must be a scam ??
In my country theres some sort of story/urban legend? Idk... But some people belive a day is 16 hours not 24 and every higher up or scientist is lying... What a bunch of goofs...
But... Its flat ??
China will grow larger!!
3:09 That Warhammer 40k reference.
Oh angular momentum. Wish I could've paid attention in physics class.
Damn! tat boi can fit so many dams in it!
Guys I'm sure this dude wrote percy jackson
Is this US propaganda?
Damn chinese increasing our daily work hours (some redneck probably)
next video: how half as interesting makes his ad transitions
Are you China be funny?
Everytime I watch an HAI video, I always try to guess when will the ad appear I've watched enough HAI videos to know when will the ad appear
Thanks, China for wasting 1 whole second of people in 47650 CE! Probably when the Himalayas got lifted when Indian plate started colliding with Asian plate, the world got few seconds late! So thanks India! Because of you guys the world is still living in the past
what happened to the other 2/3rds of Iceland?
Being 60 nanoseconds late on school...
Let's slow down the earth to make it 30 hours in a day, and lets slow down the process going on in our bodies to add another, oh, how about 300 years? 300 years with 30 hour days. That'd be.... half as interesting!
Ok. China.....China! Chil da fuk ot
Thor lives in that dam
Gina
COMMUNISM STOPS THE EARTH
How much would the earth slow down due to molten icecaps moving from the poles towards the equator?
Let the jokes flow
Damn only one second tho lol
That's fuck all for a big outfit like this.
Even somebody walking or stopping technically changes the rotation of the earth.
"I broke the dam"
That was too smooth... The hell.
Trump was right (CHINA)
Do you ever read the comments? If you do GOOD video man! Keep up the good work!!
1:43 That's no Iceland
but why would it slow down earth? like before the dam was made and the water was put in the water and materials already were on earth but were just moved so how did it effect it??
Fucking asians
basically china's middle finger to world by screwing up the world's gps systems.... slighty

Damn big dam
“I COULD USE SOME DAM FRENCH FRIES!” Zöe: confused
fuck you and your shit advertising at the start of videos.
Can they build some more so I can have more time in my day? (Like, a lot more)
Dafuq is china
this dam can only be built in China because democracy will not allow such contraversial project being executed. Thats why China is such a great country with rocket-like developement. Greater good is the only target and we have dont need to waste time or resources on those who are weak.
Dammit China! wait don't
Since this will be buried in comments I deny the Armenian genocide.
Dam it china.
Thats why todays science class was so damn long u damn china????
Who else thought they slowed the earth because of their enormous population.
Communist scums
This man made the greatest ad transition again. I salute you
Nice ad transition
Thanks to china so i can play longer before midnight
When he made the dam joke, who remembered that one part in the Percy Jackson books.
Shut up Norman
This video was hilarious (and interesting) Good job ???endov... wait
you flipped Costa Rica
So Did I watch a 4:55 long ad about brilliant.org.??????
So if build a dam big enough ill finnally have enough time in day to accomplish actually something without being deprived of sleep?
Dammmn, China
Damn, if it wasn’t for them, we would have shorter school times
Yeet
"Dam" it
The ending was quite junkish though??. No hard feelings !!!!!!
The beat our dams, because we don't have mountains. But they will never beat our delta works ~the Netherlands
I see sea
Well great, now we get to work even longer hours...
I somehoe failed to detect an imminent segue for this video like I always do
It was 200 billion Yuan, roughly equivalent to 31 billion Usd, not 200 billion USD.
Dam! At least that compass wasn't Made in China. Plus, give it a nice strong earthquake in the right area of that dam then, maybe that dam will go bye bye.
Wow democracy
Dam fine job in your reporting.
Next level clickbait OMEGALUL
0:07 - O:33 Top 10 Rappers Eminem is afraid to Diss
The question is how do you know that it happened because China made a dam...? It may have happened because of some other events, i don't know but it could be anything, like affected by the Sun, or sliding of some tactonic plates, etc.
Damn it China
Fucking dirty slope commies, I’m gonna blow those damn dams up.
We need to learn to live with the planet instead of just on it WHO'S WITH ME?!
"This probably won't kill us" Thanks. Thanks for the reassurance.
THANKS A LOT CHINA!!!
Ok, this channel will becoming the next Grandayy.
This Dark Theme is too fucking good
I can wake up 60 nanoseconds late now. Yay
So they made my school day longer? Fucking...
If you step one step higher, the earth also rotates slower. WOW WHO CARES
Damn
Dam...
Where's the dam snack bar?
1:00 only one party communist in a nutshell, also I live in hongkong
nothing can slow or speed up the earth's rotation.
At least that you wrote metric under imperial system, but still!
You running out of ideas
This is a bad hoax and a western style double standard video, the Hoover dam blocked Mexicans access to water, and what do you wanna say about that?
Damn good China, more time to finish my homework
2:08 typo
For the emperor
Thanks a lot you chinese idiotics, NOW WERE ALL GOING TO FUCKING DIE FOR FUCKING FUCK FUCK SAKE!!!
So For Building Bigger Cleaner Power plants, a Nanosecond in a day would be added, Imagine more Projects like this to Reduce Carbon Emissions are Passed, Could we Get 25 Hours in a Day as the Millenia passes?

Oh god! Not a 6 hundred millionth of a second!
Did somebody say CCP, the creators of my most played game?
The earth don't rotate tho ????
0.00000006*365.25*(85-15)=0.00153 days. I will be 0.00153 days younger when i die (well i am just as old but the year counter says i am younger) or 132.5 seconds
That is one big dam dam
I want Brilliant to teach me how to transition from a conversation to an advertisement as smoothly as you
Thank you china.. I have to stop watching TV and go to bed 60 nanoseconds earlier..
Dam Daniel kill me
And here I was thinking CO2 was meant to be the blame for all of the problems on earth.
Another effective way to slow the Earth's rotation: space elevators. A single ribbon extended well past geostationary orbit would be ideal. Then lift a bunch of bulk mass up the elevator as far as it goes and simply release it at the top. A few billion tons lifted and released should have a noticeable effect on the spin of Earth.
2:01 But how many cups is that?

I'd like to make myself belive
Dam it
great job ching chongs
Isn't this dam better than the Mexican border wall?
The true north and south pole are not moving and never will. The magnetic north and south poles are constantly moving and right now the magnetic south pole in the ocean and not marked like the video claims.
Damn china
More dams
No idea why I’m not subbed in this channel though been a sub in your other channel for several years now.
that Segway to the sponsor was great
So in theory, we could also make it spin faster?
damn dam you scary
Relocate people in Chinese terms means firing squad ??
This is a dam lie !

So I have this dam to blame for my day lasting slightly longer. The key to immortality is bigger dams.
You said ireland that’s the north retard
The moon is doing the same thing; on a much larger scale.
Does that mean school is longer
The transition to the sponsor at the end...
Pointless video. I dont get your message. What are you trying to tell about? Just meaningless presentation.
God damn the Chinese for slowing the earth and stealing our jobs
The earth loses it aerodynamic.
Holy shit China!
Damn.
Don't worry guys, it will last for 2 weeks.
china is very extremely idiot country they are the ones who damage mother nature xddddddddddddddddd
I love the way 40k slipped in like that
Damn dam... I’ll go now
Dam, China!
stupid video
1:43 That's Northern Ireland, not Ireland Ireland. And yes, it is quite the big mistake
In the grim darkness of the far future...blame China
HMMH, SCHOOL TIME IS LONGER DAMN IT

I almost got whiplash when you made that segue
I went to New Zicelosta Rahamanda once. It was confusing
This is dam good video, plenty of knowledge flowing.
Oh boy, RT really had fun with this one.
A fish was swimming in a lake then it hit a wall, what did the fish say?
Probably won't kill us. **Probably.**
Dude... interesting.
Use Metric better
What a long ad spot at the beginning. It took an entire 4 minutes before he got to how I could learn about moment of inertia at brilliant.org/hai.
Dam it's cool ..
is it enough to make my GPS inaccurate ?
Awesome content, keep it up.
I still remember the government promised that electricity bill would drop xx% with the completion of this dam, so they charged everyone xx% extra to help funding the construction project. 15 years have pass since the completion, they are still charging us this extra bill with the promise of lower electricity cost nowhere to be seen, what a joke
We can thank the Chinese for delay the return of the god emperor of mankind by a single second Purge the heretics
Shoutout to the animator, this was dam impressive.
Daaaaaamn said Amsterdam
Good job China now i will live for less days
this man still cannot pronounce the word “regularly”. good content though
So, Trump build the wall because he's so jealous at China's Big Beautiful Dam!!? Because it can hold tremendous amount of water!!?

I'm a figure skating nerd and I, in fact, am offended
Ur telling me I can get a hard-on and change the speed of the earth's rotation? Nucking futs!
Mankind is just destroying earth for their needs.... No one understands what will happen in the future isn't great
THANKS C H I N A
China is a big place isn't it
This has to be the fastest explained video I’ve ever seen, love it.
"Probably" won't kill us
How many of you watch this channel just for the smooth segways?
Xi Jinping is pronounced like shee tcheenpeeng
Hey warhammer refrence big dick
Yea right, we barely made enough of a dent to the earth geology and the entire title seemingly blamed us for something that seemed far worse. Way to go for your titling
But earth is flat
God dam it china. Cant take you anywhere!
3:33 regarly
Dam China
So if everyone laid down at sea level at once, how much faster would the earth spin?
Unfortunately, this one truly was Half as Interesting. Not enough bad jokes.
Every rocket launch affects the rotation too.
THE EMPEROR IS PLEASED WITH YOUR WARHAMMER 40K REFERENCE HERETIC.
This guy can sell anything
Dam it China!!!
My guy. There is a reason that transitioning from content to advertising the way you do is illegal on TV. Yeah, it's not illegal on youtube, but it's still really shady. Come on.
OMG! OMG! OMG! Me running around in mindless panic
This video is pretty dam interesting!
2:26 Fidget Spinner WEEEEEEE
Thanks china
I didn't know iceland looked like that
Wendover... Is becoming too self aware...
I can’t believe countries are still communist in 2018.
Wow, no Superman jokes? Impressive.
I love the effort that goes into proving single useless point while providing so much information
Was the dam made in China though?
Like always, these channels have the best transitions to advertising.
No it was government coverup for when they slowed down the sun!!! wake of america asia isnt rael!!!!!
The minute I saw the title I instantly thought to myself: "yo mama so fat she slowed the earth's rotation". LOL
that transition to the ad... smooth af
YEET
4:11does my man have an iphone 4
Is it just me or does anyone else enjoy how he brings in the sponsors
How does climate change come into effect here? If the oceans rise, isn't that the same consequence?
I know this is a fact but this just reminds me how RTGames builds dams.
Incredible editing
Fortunately I get these memes and not being trigged
Damn
Does earthquake make the earth rotate faster due to collapsing buildings?
Damn
So I'm gonna die earlier due to a damn dam. Damnit!
Hot reservoir! This dam is my jelly!
Smashed that liked button just for that terrible ad transition. Honestly, those 'smooth ad transitions' often overtake 'excellent content' in my top 2 list of reasons to subscribe to this amazing channel.
This is how?? gained +1 sec
The dam cost 200 billion yuan, not dollars.
1:43 that is a VERY stretched out Iceland
Dams are an ecological disaster, every time
I hate China for makin the day 60 nanoseconds longer I am chinese
What is wrong with you? Why you always say China is bad?
Hai
I'm fairly sure you're now sued by Gears Workshop now
pepper
That time I slowed the Earth's rotation when raised my hand at class..
Animation is very good in their video??
so you're saying that every time lie down the earth speeds up? guys I think I just figured out how to time travel!
Dam
That Ireland outline was truly horrific...
That super seamless transition to the ads tho ??????
Rubber stamp? Maybe, but also, nobody wants ro write the first proposal they say no to. The mere existence of the NPC functions as a check on abuse of power in the same way that the existence of nuclear weapons functions as a check on invasion. Writing policy proposals the NPC will say no to is a good way to end your political career.
You said Ireland but showed The Republic of Ireland not the island of Ireland. Brexit is doing enough to destabilize the north now this?!
At 2:09, there are 4 zeros between commas in the mass of the earth in kilograms
"Yeet yourself in" AHAHAHA THIS HAD ME WHEEZING
I'll give your meme game a 5/7
This damn dam is so damn big it slowed the goddamn earth down.
massive bitcoining rigs (datacenters) are housed near these damns for cheap electricity
I guess your video is gonna be blocked in China for making a joke about Xi Jingping
This was beautiful
Thank you China for helping to counter sea level rise by storing all those melted glaciers!
Dam, that segway tho.
i love how conspiracy theory-ish this sounds at first
don't let donald trump watch this video
Damn china, you made my school EARLIER FOR 60 NANOSECONDS! NOW I CANT GET ENOUGH SLEEP!!!!11!!!!11!1
That's so cool!
I live in the Co-operative Republic of New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
The smooth transition going into the Brilliant sponsored information is easily the best part of the video
Your intro was way to fast. Slow it down dude
The fact you referenced CCP the game developer made the eve player in me so dam happy
3:17 Video about China. Shows a compass not made in China
They need more time, 24 hours isn't enough.
So what will be the effect of the massive canal project in China to transport water from the south to the north? Depending on the volume of water it will cancel out.
Aye us kiwi’s got a mention
Brilliant sponsors Wendover Productions but also this memey hellhole
Glorious transition into the Brilliant ad, I groaned.
I’m happy with the number of dam jokes in this episode.
HOLY FUCK WENDOVER PLAYS EVE
Alright China please build a couple of thousand of these dams. I’d prefer to have longer days (and nights).
Damn
Is this god dam?
Dam! They really did?!
What about the effects of a space elevator on the rotation on earth
I blame China for plenty already
I hate Brilliant!
This is why the ccp sucks
So what if all humans gone up a lift at once?
That was a pretty good transition into the sponsor this time.
Do you play Eve Online?
So you make the point that everything moving on Earth does technically also influence the rotation, how was it that the completion of this dam was had an effect that was even noticeable to people recording the changes?
Little Rock, AR has the Big Dam Bridge.
Half as Interesting as what?
1 second. Enough time for Donald Trump to say China one more time.
God damn commies slowing the earth down.
Damn!
4:16 On that phone? I can't afford it dude
Please stop cutting off half of Ireland ??
How do we remove those nano seconds
"probably wont"
Dam Damiel. Back at it again with the big Dam.
Fun fact, although Three Gorges Dam being the biggest dam in the world, Itaipu (the second largest dam, located in Brazil/Paraguay) Produces more electrical energy because the Three Gorges experiences six months per year when there is very little water available to generate power, while the Paraná River that feeds the Itaipu has a much lower seasonal variance in flow.
Donald Trump has entered the chat
In 2nd grade some of my friends and me made a model of this dam.
I work in hydropower, so 93.5 TWh was only meaningless until I converted to MWh. That's insane! I can't imagine what inside of that dam looks like...
Don't use CE, use AD! BCE/CE is offensive.
Every time I stand up I slow the earth's rotation
I Love youre videos
consider myself yoted
So if we make a huge enough tower, we can stop the earth?
DAAAAMMMMMMM BOI THAT DAM THICC BOI
I'm sure I'll get molested for saying this but just putting my 2 cents in - I don't like how memey this video was or how memey this channel has become. This channel used to and still does sometimes post really interesting and insightful stuff but this video had absolutely no substance, very little research, and like 25% of it was an ad... seemed like it was just an excuse for sponsorship and ad revenue. Dropped the ball on this one
God dam it...
2:09 Your surreptitious rounding and weird comma placement have not gone unnoticed. … Wait, you did this just to make people comment, didn't you? I can't believe I fell for it!
They still say China number 1
Due to this stupid video, I decided to unsubscribe this channel. You didnt even know the concept of interaction force in the universe, so stupid, politically, and beyond my words.
What about the high rises and skyscrapers everyone is putting up and away from the axis? Seems like a huge amount of mass collectively.
China really does make everything
Releasing the water from the dam would speed the earth back up, and everything will return back to normal.
damn.
I can now sleep 60 more nanoseconds.
So that's why I was late for that meeting yesterday.
Dam
Yay! Power for New Zealand! Send it now please. Peter Jackson's render farm needs all it can get.
A like for that star wars joke
At least you are aware the jokes are terrible.
I say bomb it with bigger dams
Ad transition smoother than my phone screen.
Paging RTGamer...
always china
Too much exageration and no useful information.
93.5 TWh/year = 10.65 GW on average
DAMNNNNNNNNNNN
I hate China.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgOrDFJhtU8
Couldn't the same be said about all of our buildings? Sky Scrapers cause global warming!?
wow so I’m running but I’m walking?
Okay so i know the effects the dam causes are miniscule, i hope the chinese don't know about it.
so i'll live longer! thanks china!
Your videos are so dam good!!!
Daaaaam. 55k views and 5.5k upvotes. 10% upvote-to-view ratio is pretty good!
Ik damn mate.
That was a dam good segway.
??????
I learned about this not too long ago in school
That's an average of 10.7 gigawatts over a year, for a total of 337 petajoules. terawatt–hours/year can fuck right off as a unit.
I thought Amsterdam would have the most dams...
Nigga the chinese will kills us one day mark my words
Damn... Those nanoseconds really helpin me get my extra sleep in, thanks China! When Russia and China fight to take over the USA, I'll be on your side <3
The tragic consequences of giving a dam
Can you do a video on how you edit your videos? I think it would be interesting to see how you do it. Doesn’t have to be a tutorial
Half As Interesting plays EvE confirmed?
Dam! Thats impressive Ok I'll kill my self
Your mama is so fat, that when she goes up in an elevator the Earth slows down it's rotation due to a change in it's moment of inertia
Everything we do speeds and slows up the spin of Earth. Earth's rotation speeds up when I go downstairs. The earthquake in Japan slowed down the rotation by < 2 microseconds. Every day the moon's title friction slows the Earth's rotation as well. Earth's days were about an hour shorter when the dinosaurs roamed the Earth but its spin has been constantly slowing for over 4 billion years.
Holy cow! Good to know!
Xi Jinpin must have such fun days rafting down the Yangtze and Yellow rivers!
Dam, that’s a smooth advert transition
That was a dam good segue at the end
Thanks China, freaking jerks
My history teacher did a whole unit on a debate if dam should be built. I had to do a big essay on it at end.
It does make me wonder how the Burj Khalifa for example affects the Earth's rotation, or of it does at all
but the earth gets faster when the reservoir is emptied, so the statement at 3:08 ist wrong.
Anyone watched the movie called “The Core?” Owo
What's the war hammer thing? 3:08
Dam it China
Anyone else notice he gave a map of Northern Ireland instead of Ireland? Just me? Ok I’ll go now
Yo mama so fat when she goes up the elevator the earth rotates 0.06 hours slower
this channel is trying to be bill wertz and its great
hire China to build Gibraltar Dam and screw up Europe ecosystem
cough USA cough ...
That transition to brilliant.
Wack.
So many memes in this video
So what?
This myth is made in China
Well dam(n) CHina are good at building dams
WTF is that outline of Iceland? Not even close
Those countries should totally join in a union to form the Federation of New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
I choked on my coffee with that star wars reference it was so funny!
The Three Gorges Dam may be the world's largest in installed capacity, but the Itaipu Dam, in Brazil and Paraguay, has a higher annual electricity generation!
0:21 Shout out to CCP Games (not china communist party)
Well damn
You see I just learned something in 4 minuets, it's that easy. If a topic in school was that long the curriculum would be finished in one week
When's the animators facereveal going to happen
perfect segway
Due to the decreased centripetal acceleration, this dam has also made things effectively heavier, which makes it harder to build other structures. Thanks a lot, CHINA!
Can I marry your voice? No homo
I never knew I wanted something so bad before I heard of New Zicelosta Rahmanda.
1:25 Does “this is bad” refer to the ecological damage, or the pun inherent in the word “DAMage”?
"so yeet yourself in"
that transition was pretty good.
#New Zicelosta Rahamanda
Watching this after watching RTGame's video...
Old news from when the dam got done years ago it was natgeo somebody needed to upload something to get they money up lol
With how my job is 60 nanoseconds is hell dann China LOL
soooooo china gave me 60 extra nanoseconds in bed every morning, thanks
Heard covfefe on 0:48
Dam Chinese at it again
WHAT A SEGWAY
The animation is outstanding.
HAI, that was quite a brilliant extrapolation for some insanely insignificant outcome. Good one!
So this dam can power all toyota corollas is the world?
The same thing happened in reverse when the japanese earthquake in 2011 broke off some ice in antarctica
Dam it. If only I could live in New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
holy shit is this a motherfucking WARHAMMER 40000 REFERENCE?
Can you do a video on how you get your sponsor video to come in so easily into the video.
1:44 Looks like Iceland got a reshape...
The cost of the Dam is 200,000,000,000 Renminbi, not American Dollars. That equates to about 31 billion US dollars.
That thumbnail annoys me the earth does not rotate in that direction
If you talk about such a small affect on the rotation of the earth, why don't you talk about the chance to teleport to the next room?
3:19 Hey, even that compass was made in Chi—GERMANY.
When you wait 3/4 of the video to see a clever transition to a brillant course...
#TeamSkillshare anyone?
they used za wardo!!
Love your channels. Are you planning on staying in the UK long-term?
"DAM IT" - China
Why do the Balkans not exist on your thumbnail?
Very appropriately watching this video right after RTGameCrowd damming the entire Atlantic Ocean.
How did they figure out that the dam caused the decreased rotational speed of the Earth?
How Pollution in places like China is going to make us all go extinct. Thanks Xi Jinpingling
I had to listen from 00:20 to 00:30 more than once
You see..
So did you mean Ireland (which you said) or Northern Ireland (which you showed) because one consumes about 3 times as much electricity as the other.
Daaaaaaaum! well I’ll be dam-ed...
but we are fine?
Not enough Winnie the Pooh/ Xi Xing Ping memes. I really wanted to see a pic of Pooh Bear going down white water in an inner tube.
You're really nailing the tone on this channel. First video just had a couple of funny things, I had to pause this one to laugh a few times because the jokes were coming so fast
Warhammer 40,000!
Why did You say Ireland , but showed a map of Northern Ireland? 1:40
where do you find all these crazy stories?
You really spent time on this
when city planning in cities skylines drains the atlantic ocean
Maybe the video should have included more pictures of the dam itself.
Chinese are beavers confirmed?
I live in New Zicelosta Rahamanda.
THE EARTH ROTATES IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE DIRECTION!!
Leave it to China!
I SAW THAT WARHAMMER 40'000 Reference!! THE EMPEROR IS PLEASED!!!
New Zicelosta Rahamanda... It is a great country... I visited them during my last vacation
you said it was "enough" shifting mass to have an effect, but in physics there is nothing like "enough", everything has an effect on everything, and even my cat going upstairs is slowing the earth, but by a super small amount But who cares about pointless arguments here?
In the beginning of your video you showed Itaipu dam that produces more energy annually than the chinese one and have a bigger flooded area, So isn't the flooded area of Itaipu compensating for the mass of the flooded area of china in the other side of the world?
Fuck Brilliant. Fuck your side-profit.
oh china why
My culture is not your goddamn video.
Fucking China ruining everything
This is so dam interesting
Boy...you really "love"china
I remember hearing vsause say something about this a while ago.
A bit dissapointed that this does not have sources..
Dam, you stole my joke.
Yeet yourself in!
The ads is getting dam smarter every video
Thank you for the accurate map of the Republic of Ireland!
Sometimes I just wanna slap you (i LOL'd out at the sarcasm at 3:03)
New Zicelosta Rahamanda Forever!!
Nice subtle CCP Games logo.
That notch on the phone in the end though.
All of your videos are so cringe but this one takes the cake and I am here.for.it.
That segue though
Love these videos, but I'm not sure Iceland looks like that 1:40
I am definitely feeling that extra 60 nanoseconds today.... why is it not friday yet?!
Thanks to the Chinese, our day got longer.
Yo' mama is so fat when she stands up, the day gets 10 seconds longer.
That was a good transition, "or you could pick up you phone and search brilliant"
best click bait ever
Dam
Guess Chinese production isn't that dam crappy after all.
at least the chinese people are small so there is balance
Nah, I realized the ad coming 4:12
Beavis: Huh huh...I have a question? Tour Guide: (huffing in frustration) Yes? Beavis: Huh huh...Is a God dam?
Dam good Warhammer reference!
A video that should be played at 1X speed and without distractions. Love it!
Johnny Weir IS a Figure Skating metaphor
dam
This is a pretty bad video tbh
Bullshit - the Earth's tectonic plates move giant mass around the Earth all the time and have been doing so for BILLIONS of years. One stupid dam isn't going to affect the rotation any more than my massive morning dump.
What if all of China (or India) took a shit all at once?
FUCKING CHINA? I TOLD YOU WE COULD ONLY DO THIS A FEW TIMES! PACK YOUR SHIT! China: what? ITS ONLY GONNA BE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE TILL THE UN IS GONNA BE BACK UP AND RUNNING ON OUR ASS AGAIN. like if you know where it’s from
Background music has an element of suspicion ... ??
Too much to believe in
Haven't watch the video yet but I'm guess it's that really big dam so time ago I remember watch it on a documentary
This channel has the smoothest transitions to advertisement I’ve ever seen. I’m not even mad, that’s amazing.
With the same thought in mind....every sky scrapper ever buit...slowed the earth down...a bit. Wounder how much the highest 100 sky scrappers have slowed us down. And what about all the material we have mined deep in the earth and brought to the surface....including oil. Thats a lot of mass.
what did you do to iceland
1:34 But how many football fields is that?
Love the metric measurements!!!
that was fucking smooth transition
God damn China not again
Dam, the segue is on point.
In other words, the dam does a BIG FAT NOTHING. Thanks for wasting 4 minutes of my time..
1:28 Unlimited POWAH
No Not possible. not even watching the video
That transition to the advert. Wow
Actually earthquake accelerating earth spin more than this dam. Japan 2011 earthquake shortening length 24h/d by 1.8 microseconds. Thousand times more.
Can we officially recognise this as the meme lord of educational channel
That ad transition
But how many Toyota Corollas running the opposite direction would it take to slow down Earth?
Poor Samuel sponsoring Brilliant on his every video and with each video getting in average 500k views, he still didn't surpass first 200 to sign up :(
Dam son
thank you for the metric conversions!
"The National People's Congress is the most expensive rubber stamp in the world" CNN breaking news: Youtuber Half as Interesting has mysteriously disappeared
This is Dam interesting
Why everything have to be different in USA - i know that there are two scales, the Long and short scales, BUT THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE 200.000.000.000 its 200 thousand million, not 200 billion. 200 billion in the rest of the planet is 2.000.000.000.000 is one more cero........its confusing and its wayyy to much money!!!!....anyway GREAT VIDEOOOOO!!! AND MY COUNTRY IS IN THAT LIST OF THE DAMS.
China: Slowing down the Earth rotation. I don't give a dam
god dam it china
Half as Interesting - double the uploads! And Memes ( ?° ?? ?°)
lol I missed the jokes! Thanks
damn
I hate you Ching Chong
If we move enough mass closer to Earths axis then all the days will happen at once and humans will have achieved immortality.
All I got from this is that it is possible to move the planet
0:11 Searching for Paraná, I wonder what that could mean
Humanity definitely will not be around in 47,650 CE. The dam might be, though!
I stand with New Zicelosta Rahamanda #NewZicelostaRahamandaIndependence
That’s not Iceland you posted after Ireland... small editing mistake
That must be the smoothest advertisement transition you've done so far
2meta2fast
LMAO and learned something, keep up the work!
That ad transition was so dam silky smooth.
This is nothing more than a subtle ad for apple watch and iphone
Now I'll be late at school, what a good thing...
Will this be effected by us going into day-light-savings time?
I dont wanna cause any friction but this thing about china is irrelevant.
Your turn #Wendover_Productions
OMG that transition got me ??
Leave ya?????? no problem
Bruh, the stereotypical "asian" music is low-key offensive...
This comment section is full of horrible "dam" puns. You have been warned.
1:43 Excuse me, what the fuck is up with the shape of Iceland?
Dam now my days longer
God diddly dooldy dang it China
$200 BILLION? Is this the most expensive construction project ever in history?
Please make a book about puns
Oh my God this is fucking pathetic hey China your space program is bullshit just like NASA why don't you produce a real picture of the Earth in its entirety but remember you're looking for an earth that is much fatter below the equator than above I'll repeat that so there's no mistake you're looking for an earth that is much fatter below the equator than above I also need the math calculations based on that shape along with the real picture. And since you're not going to be able to produce that without completely Faking It Go ahead and use your Blue Marble curve calculation and show me curvature have a wonderful day
Woo that's such a big change if you look at it from a geographical time view
I'll yeet myself into this comment section
93.5 TWh of power per year? DAMNNNNNNNNNN!
But then there was the settling of the underwater tectonic plate that caused the tsunami that devastated Indonesia in 2004. That moved a substantial portion of the Earth's mass closer to its axis, and so marginally increased the rate of its rotation. And let's not forget how, in the time of the dinosaurs, days were closer to 22 hours long.
3:13 ??!
How many Toyota Corollas does it take to slow down the earth?...wait wrong channel
Dam nice structures!
I want to go to new zicelosta rahamanda
e e e e e e e etheret
So let’s just Y E E T
wendover back st it with them smooth ass transish
Stupid American units. Grow up.
That intro was.... interesting
Three Gorgeous Dame?
i had to check if this video was playing at normal speed
Well this dam really makes my day...
That channel is about best segways .
That WH40k reference
Half as Interesting, have you heard of the metric system yet? It's pretty good please check it out.
What about huge cities with high buildings ? Are those something to ignore, or that dam is just great reason for clickbait?
Dam dam dams dam dam dam!
"New Zicelosta Rahamanda"
So DAM crazy badum tsss
But what about the other dozen dams that China has built? In total, how much is the entirety of China slowing down earth's rotation
I think this is the first time a thumbnail/title of a video made my jaw drop
too many memes
1:20 it's 200 billion yuan not dollars god dam it.
Lol I could only picture Winnie the Pooh going down the rapids thanks to the memes show how Xi looks like Winnie!
Can it slow down the Chinese population???
Thank you for fully embracing your witty-storytelling roots. The cunning editorializing - both made-audible and visualized - make this content stand out among the droning factually-specific masses. Please keep up the great work.
DAM n they just slowed the earths rotation...
So wait. How much have we slowed down earth's rotation by building skyscrapers??!
Another way of putting it is the Three Gorges Dam produces around 0.4% of the world's electricity.
How a human standing up changes the Earth's rotation.
It’s almost as big as you mum
In this channel we take a clickbaity title and try to make a video about it - HAI 2016
So how many Toyota Corollas can fit there?
I like the Chinese music background
What is that song can anyone please tell me?
2:34 sloppy, 4.6/10
yeet yourself in
6,611th! I'm joking I love your vids. <3 You're too dam good.
Well, DAM.
Im honestly watching this video just for the add transition. You are insane, we never expect it!
I N E R T I A I S A P R O P E R T Y O F M A T T E R
Wendover I think you should talk about on mostly circular lakes
Well, dam.

this is false, there is no resistance like in your example of the ice skater where the ice skate and ice would be the point of contact where the resistance forces are being shown, in space not only can no one hear you scream, but there is no air to provide a force against the spin of the earth , but not Ice , and the earth dont wear no ice skates. it sits on a turtle
Sounds like something China would do.
Ya got me again with the Brilliant transition.
Xi Jin Ping has liked the video!
3:22 it would have been better if that compass said “made in China”
What's the song that starts at 2:12? I've tried to find it for months
What was the music used?
Hey guys, if you need me, I'll be over here liking, commenting, and subscribing as soon as I see that Sam has a new video out. Always great for a laugh while I learn something interesting!
Wouldn't it be funny if China had large scale concentration camps and nobody cared?
Damn it all my dam jokes are taken
That’s pretty dam impressive. A dam site better than the nearest dam to me
China’s done it again
WOOHOOO LONGER DAYS!!!!! now i got 60 extra nanoseconds to sleep!!!

God Dam It China

Wow that one dam could power Australia for half a year.
The way u link in the sponsor is so DAM smooth
SLOW THE FU?K DOWN WILL YOU? I know the topics are half as interesting as the ones on your main channel, but you don't need to compensate it by making the production quality twice as shit?
dam nice video

Donald Trump China playing at 0,0000006 x speed

I came early to make a witty comment. I just can't think of one.
1:46 I gave this a tired smile until you said Ruanda. WOW...
The dam jokes are incoming!
You made this video just so you could tell dam puns
He he he, very kewl.
So I have this dam to blame for my day lasting slightly longer. The key to immortality is thus more big dams! That's how science works, clearly. Take note, Grey.
What happens when China starts mass-producing huge dams? Will the Earth start spinning in the other direction?
Dam, China.
Half as Interesting = Wendover Productions
That may have been the smoothest segue yet
