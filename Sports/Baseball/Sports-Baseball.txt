Still waiting on that Yankees “wrath.”
thanks for making my team lose 6:33 smh
The jinx is real wow!
Dodgers in 6 over the sox
Brewers were so close to going to the World Series but than Urinating tree had to curse us with that prediction
URINATING TREE ILL FUCKING KILL U, U DESTROYED THE BREWERS CHANCES, DONT PICK US, THATS WHAT GOT US INTO THE POSTSEASON
Well you where right Rockies got swept
regarding your world series prediction... YOU BLEW IT
AAAANNDDDD you jynxed it... Brewskis and Astros lose in CS Sox and Dodgers
Milwaukee and Houston? Instead it's Boston and LA. Oh dear, his jinxing is still real....... Who will be the unlucky pick in his hater's guide? (Or maybe he'll be right like last year again lol)
Dammit Tree. Not only did you jinx my Astros, but you also jinxed the Brewers, the second team I was rooting for this postseason. Your predicting skills are making a return to form.
Tree jinxed another World Series, eh. GO DODGERS!!!!
dodgers v sox god still hates us but at least i'm a dodger fan
Damnit Tree! You cursed us all to suffer through Red Sox-Dodgers
6:35 Well. Their opponents made it.
milwaukee vs houston. Riiiiiiip.
6:29-6:36 JINX!
CONGRATS TREE, YOUR JINXING HAS CONDEMNED US ALL!
Prediction jinx meter: halfway there... C'mon Brewers....
Conglaturation Houston
6:35 Red Sox are in the World Series.
Good news is both your predictions made it past the LDS. Bad news is both are one game away from being eliminated in the LCS.
So far it seems like you've jinxed the astros and the brewers.
If Houston loses, I'm not blaming you. I saw game 3, thank you very much.
That Red Sox one really aged well my guy
Yup! Houston & Milwaukee
The dodgers will, once again, choke
I can tell you really love f-zero from the music in your vids.
Astros and Brewers are currently in their respective championship series. The prophecy has a chance.
Looks like it's going to be Dodgers and Red Sox in the World Series due to the jinx.
"Luke Voit saved the management's insatiable boner for Greg Bird" It's too much, I'm dying...
Wrong
2:45
The Yankees wrath lost them a game 16-1
Giancarlo Stanton sucks!!! Lol. Prepare for the Yankees wrath huh? ????????
Bye bye Yankees!!
Dodgers vs Red Sox World Series
I thought I clicked on death battle on accident...I had to check twice
This was hilarious. Go Dodgers!
Well, so far both the Astros and the Brewers are still in it (and the Yankees are out), so you might yet be right.
As a red sox fan I have to say that was extremely fair. all hail the Tree!
It’s gonna be dodgers Red Sox
Red Sox vs Dodgers, more ratings that way. Who the hell would want to watch Brewers vs Astros???
And u were right about the Indians and Rockies soooo good job
Well yankees are out so gods dont hate us
You should really watch INDIANS games and it will change your mind so easily
Well, looks like the Yanks went down. So thats that.
I'm an astros fan. Yeah I'm scared. Why did he pick us!?
Let's go Dodgers!!!!
Rip the Rockies man ????
2:17 lmaoooo ??????
Yes... the Yankees... HAHAHA
I think I saw Kyle Seager strike out 10 times in this video.
As a Marlins fan, hearing names like Stanton and Yelich being great for their playoff teams, it hurts. Why Jeter, WHY?
Don't call yourself the "HATERS." So many people would watch you.
this is hillarious
UT is a Steelers fan but deep down he cheers for the Pats ??
The Curse is broken YANKEES LOSE
Start doing college football
If Houston doesn’t make the World Series I’m still blaming it on Ken Giles
Please do a Debriefing for the 20 teams that failed to make the playoffs like you did for the NHL. And rip the mariners apart. Pretty Please.
As a Colorado fan, GODDAMMITTTT!
Cleveland is already out. What a shocker.
Go Astros
WIN IT ALL FOR UECK!! GO BREW CREW!!
This was fucking spot on.
would love to see the milwaukee brewers get their first world series win, they will have to go thru boston, houston is hot but they played cleveland, they and their racist mascot are gone. boston will beat the astros in a great series. brewers beat the dodgers because the dodgers are too inconsistent. boston will probably beat the brewers but i will be rooting for the brewers regardless, and maybe, just maybe if they can get a couple close ones... i'm just glad i don't have to listen to 50,000 red necks playing indian with their little plastic toys.
As much as I love Yelich and Cain, they aren't the sole reason for our success. We have a deep roster and a talented bullpen. Everybody on the team isn't a Bryce Harper or a Barry Bonds but they are good ball players who have all helped the team in some way.
As long as Houston gets eliminated that's all that matters. No Verlander celebration this year...I guarantee it.
Hey, what sport is this? Is this some type of alien football?
So when do you admit that your dumbass was wrong about the Braves?
- Urinating Tree picks Astros vs Brewers in the World Series...which means...it's gonna be Yankees vs Dodgers instead! Go Dodgers!! ;-)
RED SUCKS BIAS HATERS and the BOSTON old media are the most ARROGANT fans on baseball ??. FACTS
It will all come down to brewers and bosron
My home team, Royals and the Orioles have had a rough year. Next year will be better but no playoff run
update the rockies lost in a sweep
5:59 - Well, you got THAT right. The Rockies fell apart and got swept. ??
lmao the Clint Hurdle Invitational
Lol cubs
Forgot to mention the A's
I wish this boi had his own segment on Sports Center rating would go up
So hey the Rockies fell apart and got swept
Urinatingtree well one of the outcomes for the Rockies did happen.... the sweep. But I did not expect a sweep where one of the best hitting cores in the league goes MIA for 3 games straight against a team that was carried by 2 players and made there pitching look like God teir
The Astros one was surprisingly not that harsh, compared to all the others.
I just hope the Lastros lose this year because of their cocky-ass fanbase
I want to see Front Row Amy in the World Series
Dodgers vs Red Sox for world series and the Dodgers win
I can’t stop laughing at his comments in the Rockies.
Geez he went off on the yanks
Indians only make playoffs bc of the A.L Central being horrible they cant beat someone like the yankees red sox astros bc they dont have a good solid team
Dodgers Houston is going to be boring ws. I think I woulda had my whole bracket correct if the damn Cubs didn’t lose the wild card with Hamels, Kendrick, and Lester ??????
I'm picking Dodgers over Astros this year. I picked that last year and was nearly right. Maybe I will be right this time.
4:43 la dodgers
Since the Mets decided to blow let’s go Brewers.
Better than ESPN
The Dodgers are gonna give whoever comes out the AL a slugfest. They are much better than their record.
My prediction for the super bowl is that one of these 8 teams will win
Two words.... Love. it.
Fucking Cleveland
Smoked them in the standings? They were only 8 games above.. Ur acting like they finished 20 games above
The F-Zero GX music makes playoff baseball far more intense
Can’t think of Yankees fan who hates Stanton more than Sanchez. He picked it up and we recognized that but yeah most Yankees fans would take Hitler over Sanchez.
Surprised I haven’t seen “Congrats Cubs!” Yet
Got Damn Nailed the dodgers correctly A world series win is the only acceptable outcome.
Not to mention that, fuck, it's 2018 why are they still called the Indians and why tf is their mascot still Chief Wahoo?
This guys is actually funny.
I prediction Milwaukee Brewers vs Houston Astros for this world series.
Chicago Cubs: How to choke in Cubs Fashion
??
That last clip brought flashbacks...
the Brewer's are coming for that World Series!
Brewers over Red Sox in 7
I'm blessed to be an astros fan of 17 years..... I'm sitting hignmh and might right now..... I'm also about to nut considering UT drop 3 vids in 2 days..... Thats legendary
Rockies just blew a chance to tie Game 2 in the 7th. Looks like your prediction for them is a done deal. Prove me wrong, Rocktober
I love these
You dare disrespect the Bronx? You've finally crossed the line. Unsubbed
That Robert Osuna made me laugh so hard
As a Red Sox fan I have high hopes this year but you know.....October
Nice
Go Cardinals ;-;
Was that even hating on Houston xD
Dude Sportsball week 4 it's friday
We're in week 5 now! You don't even have NFL week 4 uploaded!! Please hurry up.
If any AL team went to the NL the AL team would make it to the WS every time
RIP Cubs, A's, Braves, Rockies, Cleveland. I also have NYY V LAD in the World Series, with LAD choking again
LA Noire is an excellent video game.
Well I'm glad he didn't say red sox and jynx my favorite team
I can't watch this. My heart is still hurting
You're right we have no expectations ???? #ChopOn
I predict the Astros & Dodgers in the World Series for this MLB postseason.
Seattle Mariners LoF when?
Urinating tree when ever you post stuff about the Indians never stop using Chief Wahoo in thumbnails
Good vid. you doing sportsball this week or nah?
Someone subscribe to my channel 1239 studio
1:46 and fuck you, too, good sir. You're not wrong that they're a colossal sack of choking hazards and inconsistent to the point you don't know if Ramirez is going to hit the ball or himself in the back of the head but fuck you anyway. Thank you and have a nice night.
I’m an indians fan, but I gotta say, everything he said is unfortunately facts...
I was so happy when the Astros traded Ken Giles for Roberto Osuna to the Blue Jays. They jettisoned a lot of blank weight by getting rid of that choker. Here's for lots of whistles and movement from Minute Maid Park's train above left field! I'm hoping you didn't jinx my Astros! I'm still aching for this week's episode of "Days of our Steelers" and 2 more legacy of failure videos for the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals/Montreal Expos.
Boy, as. Braves fan, I'm just happy to be here. Imagine when the rest of >our farm comes up to the Show. I'm ready to be back on top for another 2 decades, hopefully they can actually manage to get more than 1 ring this time.
Let’s go Braves!
"The Clint Hurdle Invitational"... brilliant.
I just want the Yankees to beat the Red Sox again. It's been too long
go tribe!!!
World Series is gonna be Indians vs Brewers
I have been waiting for this...
I resent the notion that my Boston Arrogance ever rises. It's Peak Boston 24/7.
Well uh...that...that was certainly an interesting take on the Dodgers.
Still loved game 5 even though we lost
“The Braves somehow managed to get through the ridiculous traffic jam on 285...” ??
Boston sweeps Colorado in the WS just like 07
Been waiting all year for this
So proud of my bravos. #ChopOn
Arizona Cardinals: a legacy of failure
Thx for not ripping the Braves like i thought u would
Your videos on baseball are more entertaining than baseball, congrats on getting me back into a sport I havent cared about in a decade
What do you have against Milwaukee? I struggle through 36 years of pain only made bearable by the Uecker, Just to have you pick them this year for the WS. I guess I have some solace in knowing the Packers won't get the PissTree Curse with McCarthy and His Legend killing coaching abilities. What's that you picked GB for the WC........... God Fucking Damn It.
Houston will win back to back
Where is sportsball week 4
As a Yankees fan: we are all angry at Sanchez he can’t block a ball behind the plate and he can’t fucking hit
Pittsburgh fan talking shit on Cleveland. Who’s surprised lol
I sincerely wonder how this guy can watch literally every game of Baseball, Football and Hockey and still have time to eat or take a shit.
Houston loves destroying and embarrassing the Red Sawx for some reason. If they can get by Cleveland (underrated!) they got the AL. Milwaukee is the best NL team. Dodgers have slipped a bit, but institution matters. I see the Dodgers sneaking by Milwaukee. Rematch of '17 except Houston got waaay better since last year and L.A. dropped a peg. Houston repeats but this time in 5. Houston is too good. Verlander, Cole, Morton, Keuchel, McCullers and now a bullpen with an unhittable Pressly and two closers. And then bat after bat after bat: Altuve, Springer, Correa, Yuli, even little Bregman hitting 30 homeruns now.
Im going to my first playoff game this sunday. Just like the avalanche last season. We know were not going very far in the post season. But my goal is already reached. Go ROCKIES!!!!!!!!
Ryu and Dodgers shutout and blew out the Braves 6-0 to take game 1
How dare you play FSU's war chant for Atlanta? They stole it from the Noles cuz of Prime Time who ya know went to FSU, and their fans act like its their thing.
AAAAAAH GOD DAMMIT OAKLAND
I thought Oakland made the playoffs...
May the Evil Empire reign! Go Yankees!
Yankees vs. Dodgers LET’S GO!
The only thing we’re missing is sports ball.....and another chapter of days of our Steelers...
The A’s and Cubs made the postseason where are they
Hey. How about you don’t pick Milwaukee cause I wanna seem then go far.
I’ll root for the Brew Crew this year.............also.......wish the Expos were still here
Tree you asshole. You have cursed my team. You will now be punished with death (or rewarded. I don't know you)
Where is this week in sportsball nfl week 4?
I'm really mainly into the NFL highlights but the fact that you've been able to put out this much content in so little time to reach many fan bases is absolutely incredible. I'm not even bummed, respect to your hard work man. Keep on doing yo thang
Why did you pick the goddamn Astros?!?
You're in the minority in genuinely hating the Cubs. But if you're wrong about this, I think you ought to make a Haters Guide to the Haters Guide if you fuck this up. It's the only thing we can hope for, since you're a Cubs hater. Now excuse me as I cleanse my mouth of salt after seeing my NL Pennant pick lose the Wild Card game and the Mariners, my actual favorite team, miss the playoffs for the 17th season in a row.
I’m a red Sox fan and I strongly believe the Yankees will smoke us
I dont mind other fans shitting on the Red Sox. Thats normal. Its their own "fans". The Red Sox have so many doubtful fairweather fans. They won 108 games ffs and all the "fans" do is bitch. God its fucking annoying. GO RED SOX!
makes sportsball videos, monkey
You jinxed the two teams I like the most in each league. How dare you.
Fuck you for picking mke. Id be happy to see them in the world series, and you had to ruin it
Go ‘Stros!
Please Tree, don't jinx my brew crew!
Hoping the Indians win since 2016, by the way I have no team I support all
From a brewers fan, why the fuck did you have to pick us?
The fuck is this retard talking about?
Wheres sportsball week 4?
I like your videos. Keep doing what you’re doing
fuck i would like to see The Rockies go on that 07' run....but we already know what was the outcome.....
“The only thing Roberto Osuna is beating is batters with his wicked stuff” LMAO
philidalpha eagles Wins Superbowl Philidalpha Flyers lose first round Philidalpha 76ers lose east semifinals Philidalpha union lose open cup finals, qualify for playoffs Philidalpha phillies miss playoffs one of these teams is not as good as the others....one of these teams does not belong. one of these teams is too mediocre, too inconsistent to for the long haul
These playoffs are gonna be fucking good.
Hey, UrinatingTree! Where's the obligatory "Congrats, Cubs!" video? Tell me you're not viewing the Rockies as a joke!
I can’t tell if he just jinxed us (braves) or not
Dodgers vs Yankees please lol
As an Indians fan, I cry.
"Feel Our Pain" playing during the Yankees overview. I see what you did there =_=
Bro, I had so much hope for my Brewers to make a deep postseason run and you threw it in the trash. ????
Sox vs Rockies Fuck.
That All-Star Baseball music though.
Sox
No why I am a Milwaukee fan
So, going by UT Jinxing logic, the Indians will sweep the entire playoffs because you've trashed them all year and count them out in round one. Realistically, even as a fan, I can tell you this isn't a playoff team. If the Astros don't sweep them, I"ll be shocked. If they go 2-0, only to go 0-3 against the Astros like last year, or even worse, 3-0, then 0-4 against Boston, I'll be disappointed.
WHY YOU CURSING MY TEAM URINATING TREE!!!!!!
WHERE IS SPORTSBALL WEEK 4.
rip oakland
So much Urinating Tree, guess is the golden showers era.
U R I N A T I O N B E G I N S
Finally when Baseball matters
In the Rockies-Brewers series, the winner may be determined by which manager over-manages the best, with the top meddler losing the series for his squad. Counsel has stiff competition in Black, who let Shaw keep pitching during the season and takes out starters when he doesn’t need to. Also, he leaves relievers in for too long. You ask the Rockies, “WTF are you?” I ask myself the same question every year.
Good God mlb is so fcking boring - when the most interesting part of the game is a runner hugging the 3rd baseman
I'm down for Yankees vs Dodgers for the billionth time :D
dammit tree in supposed to be asleep
4:01 You forgot Orlando Arcia dabbing after finishing off the Cubbies
Why would anyone watch baseball?
Where is fickimg football
NOOOOO! DAMNIT TREE YOU JINXED US! R.I.P ASTROS!
My iPad won’t let me watch this in 720p, so I’m not watching this (thanks, ScamPad)
Yelich is the baby bruth of the league rn
Brewers have to much magic rn to blunder
So I am assuming there will be this week in football upload tomorrow??
God dammit Tree, I had Brews and Stros pegged for the WS since before the season started. So much for that dream...
Indians vs braves
No sportsball this week? Aww that blows.
FUCK YOU SPANOS
I'm basically going to root for the National League from afar (no way i'm watching this overall shitshow with hockey season starting.) 3 of the 4 NL teams have former (and freshly traded) Orioles players and seeing someone from our long-suffering organization get a ring will actually be nice.
It would be cool to see the Rockies win.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOU JINXED THE CREW GOD FUCKING DAMNIT
Congratulations Athletics!!!! you let the yankees win 2 wild cards in a row
I say Houston vs Milwaukee too. Thanks for not mentioning the A's btw.
Damn he’s really distancing himself from that Steelers L
the AL is so fucking boring this year. literally the same teams. NL though is very interesting. hopefully it's either the braves or brewers.
Love My Yankees & Indians but I can’t Believe Boston isn’t more hated then us none the less they’ll probably win the World Series sadly
Thanks for picking the Brewers, Tree. May the jinx streak continue. Signed, a Colorado Rockies fan. <_<
I'm from Pittsburgh and I hate every Pittsburgh team, and every since 2005 I've cheered for the astros and its playing off! Also you should make a vid for the Washington wildthings if you know what they are. Local baseball team for a small as league.
Yes! He didn't pick my team to get to world series. Thank goodness because he's never right.
How have like half of all NFL teams had videos but still no Mariners?
HAHAHAHA all star baseball music!!!
Loving the Baseball All-Stars 2003 music!
As long as New York, Boston and LA don’t win I’m good (especially LA since Cali)
Hate on the Indians but fail to mention the horrible amount injuries they have had during the end of the season/postseason the past 2-3 years. When they went to the World Series in 2016, they weren’t even supposed to make the playoffs... also saying that all cleveland has is Jose and Lindor shows your lack of knowledge. The Indians have one of the best starting rotations in all of baseball. 2 Cy young caliber pitchers in Kluber and Bauer. I really try to like you, I really do even if you are from Pittsburgh. Yes the Indians have not WON anything besides the central division, but please tone down your displeasure with the Indians for once Jesus Christ.
I love the Indians banter ?? Yes, we only made it because AL Central decided to suck ass.
Love the ending clip ??
Astros vs Brewers Astros in 6 ???
Where's the NFL Week 4 upload?
I'm an Indians fan. And I agree completely.
You really hate Cleveland man. Kinda sad. Not the teams fault the division is weak. Can’t just say 1 nice thing
Go brewers
Make a mls video please
Why would you pick the Brewers? Thanks for jinxing my hope away... :(
Thanks for not jinxing thr Dodgers ??
"A cool breeze and some leaves rustling about"
Anticipating a Reverse Jinx after what was said about Cleveland...
The Cubs are worthy of a congrats video...
YOU FORGOT THE A'S YOU DICK
Go Go, Astros!
Fuck the Yankees.
Fuck why did you pick the Brewers. Now we are fucked??????
Chop on baby
Tree, I had the same exact Fall Classic prediction. We must be blood brothers or something.
Based on your explanations i'm guessing Clevland is going to win
my bet is astros/red sox vs brewers WS
Acclaim all star baseball theme in the background? That’s some DANK music
Eh no starters just bullpen for the brewers
>cusb
New microphone?
And where is week four nfl
As a Braves fan, I can rest easy knowing that UT has jinxed the other teams.
Well, you picked Houston to win last year and it worked, why stop now?
The ending triggered me
UrinatingTree ignores the bullshit that is the wild card game and waits until its over so he can pretend it doesn't exist
Brewers!
Maybe a couple days late
I miss the Cubs
Corey graves voice YES 1000x YES
Sportsball?
I may eat my words on this, but are you high UT? Brewers vs Astros in the WS? Fucking bold statement.
From a rockies fan, Our offense has taken a nose dive down into the Royal Gorge. If the bats don't wake the fuck up it's going to be all to easy for the Brewers to sweep us.
"Congrats, Cubs!", "Congrats, A's!" are next.
20$ its gonna be cleveland rockies cause of this video
Thank God he didn't mention the Red Sox for it all. Now we have a chance
“Because god hates us all it’s probably going to be Dodgers Vs. Yankees” lul ??
Astros repeat on deck. When we win championships in Houston, we win at least two in a row. Rockets 94 and 95 Oilers in the AFL 60 and 61 And yes I’m counting the Dynamo 06-07 and Comets 97-00 ??
As a Yankees fan I mist say I completely agree, Giancarlo gets shit for no reason. He has performed great in his first year and people call it a terrible trade, I don't even pretend to understand.
no tree the braves r better then they were supposed to be :)
Cleveland vs Milwaukee DONT @ ME
...work on that high jump lad
"whatever will we do...laugh at you if you fall apart? Oh yeah that."
Everyone shut the fuck up about Sportsball! It’s coming! Give tree a break. We had 3 uploads in 2 days. Just be happy that at this time of year, we have all of the major sports being played at one time!
A baseball team’s window is never closed. The game is too sporadic.
Braves vs Yanks
You jinx the Brewers, Astros, Yankees, and my Dodgers... I blame Spanos PUTA SU MADRE SPANOS!
If the World Series is Dodgers vs Yankees it’s the battle for Brooklyn
Where’s the A’s
Fuck the yankees
I watched two full ads for you tree. That is how much I love your shitposting
WHERE I NFL WEEK 4 SPORTSBALL!
Week 4 edition?
YESSSS
"Ginger beard of doom"
Machado and Markakis kicking ass on other teams...SIGH...
Respect for using x to doubt
I demand an Indians legacy of failure if they get swept by the Astros.
World Series: LA vs Cleveland. Wahoos last stand
Thanks for the SeatGeek discount, Tree! Used it for Dodgers/Braves Game 2 tickets!
Thank you for not picking Boston so we have a chance
wtf spoiler warning before that last clip
Where are the Orioles?
Where is this week in sportsball
Yankees vs Brewers is a lock
If you wonder why we've complained about a 100 win team. it's because the Yankees front office marketed this team as the next multi WS dynasty. They promised us a run like the late 90's. Giancarlo was marketed to us as the 2nd coming of Ruth. Ticket prices were marked to reflect all this. As the season progressed what frustrated us most is how we can roll into Houston, Cleveland, and Boston and run the table but then turn around and get swept by Toronto and Baltimore. If you look at the team match ups this year Baltimore's best record was against NY. So yes any one would be thrilled to have 100 wins in a season, but how they got them just made no sense.
Braves vs Astros, Braves win
At 1:01 WAHOO'S LAST STAND.
So many funny quotes. my favorite is "Atlanta, finally able to get out of the traffic jam on I285 and reach the promise land of the postseason"
Most boring sport ever
Yes!! Your outro should be you saying f u Spanos
My Rays got gypped
I gotta root for the brewers. Not only because I got to visit the stadium this year, but I can identify with them as a mariners fan. Let’s go brew crew, don’t collapse like your city’s budget
UrinatingTree is the Kenny Florian of Sportsball. ??
You know Ken Giles since his trade to the jays has a perfect save record
Atlanta Braves - We're just happy to be here.
So many empty seats, I knew there was a problem.. BUT DAMN
UrinatingTree predicts Houston vs. Milwaukee I say: YAY, MY TEAM ISN'T JINXED!!! RED SOX ALL THE WAY!!!
I love your content but MLB is unwatchably boring. Where's NFL Week 4 edition?
Red Sox for the love of God don't pull a 2004 Yankees on us fans. Edit: Also no 2001 Mariners bullshit.
using the All Star Baseball video game soundtrack...love it
Ehh, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a World Series rematch this year. Personally I'd like RedSox vs Dodgers. I think that'd be a good one. I wanted RedSox/Cubs but the Cubs lost in the Wildcard so ???????. Yankees/Dodgers would be good too but it'll be a nightmare for me since I hate both teams. Also Brewers/Astros would be a fun series. We'll see what happens! Update: My RedSox beat the Astros in five and are going to the World Series! ???? ??.
The difference between the AL and NL is black and white in the DS round. The AL playoff bracket is literally exactly the same except Cleveland is playing Houston as opposed to New York. 1 team grand total from last year's NLDS bracket made the DS.
Please god! No Yankees vs Dodgers series. Please let something incredible happening instead like Cleveland winning.
You forgot he beat the case to
Urinating "Jinx King" Tree dismissing Cleveland the same way he dismissed Atlanta at the beginning of the season... ??
Where the hell is this week in sportsball week 4
Clint Hurdle invitational Oh so wrong, yet oh so funny.
Good lord if it’s the Dodgers vs Yankees I might die from the amount of cancer radiating from both of the fan bases if they play each other.
Just because I think it’d be funny to see in a World Series, I’ll say Boston vs Rockies lol
Rockies, Yankees, Indians, Red Sox, Dodgers, and Braves fans are celebrating that Tree didn't pick them
The A’s made the playoffs. As a bitter Mainer’s fan, you and your jinxing powers have failed me.
Go Brew Crew
Braves and Indians
Fucking kill me if it winds up being Dodgers/Yankees.
I am both Red Socks and Rockies fan together. I am rooting for both of these teams. Good luck to both of you!
Because you have the best predicting skills, it's gonna be Rockies vs Indians. And the Rockies will win. Thanks a lot.
So suddenly the Wild Card game isn't a bunch of bullshit when it sticks it to a Pittsburg division rival? Hmmmm...
Watching this while watching that Rockies Brewers game in the background. TREE TAKES PRIORITY
On an unrelated topic, holy shit thats alot of empty seats.
Never had chills like I did at the game 5. I always thought when people said that the air was electric that they were just trying to be hyperbolic, but damn if that atmosphere wasn't then I don't know what electric is. Thanks for the reminder Tree! Let's Go Stros! :)
I don't care about baseball, I just love hearing UT talk shit. He's hilarious.
Either Dodgers vs Yankees or Dodgers vs Red Sox will be cancerous and kill everyone so instead of virgins being sacrificed for Dodgers let’s sacrifice virgins so this doesn’t happen as a virgin I am willing to make the sacrifice like if you agree
Why are the Yankees called the evil empire we haven’t done much for like a decade
Damnit you jinxed my brewers
As a braves fan, all I have to say is "fuck you" xD. I mean you're probably right, but fuck you anyways lol
Remember, the Yankees and Red Sox got about 15 wins each from the Orioles. Gotta put an asterisk next to their records
I told ya Baltimore wasn't gonna make it
Hope the Braves get it done
"clint hurdle invitational" lmfaooooooooooooo
Go Astros!
RIP A's :(
Thanks for fucking the Brewers asshole
I’d take anyone but the Red Sox this year. Yankees are fine with me for McCutchen. really wanna see Colorado or Milwaukee win it all though
Redsox v dodgers redsox win :(
Congrats Cubs video?
yankees Dodgers Donald Trump nukes Yankee Stadium game 7
As a cubs fan just roast us. We deserve it. We got complacent
Oh god what a boring sport...
rip athletics season
Ik you're busy but please, I need sportsball week 4; I am a biochem major and the only fun I have is watching your videos, pls help
This is the nationals year!!! #NATITUDE
Pekka Rinne will sweep the Astros
Please in god all mighty don't let it be Dodgers vs Yankees.
dodger haters on suicide watch
Dodgers Red Sox. Dodgers will win
Red Sox bullpen will probably be the major cause in losing. "Oh, but the bullpen has the best WAR of any bullpen." God that stat is fucking worthless. Hembree, Kelly, Barnes and everyone else in there have no balls outside of a knuckle baller who's a coin toss with every pitch and Brian Johnson who throws 90mph max. If Rodriguez or Eovaldi (they said they'd be switching them, stupid) can take up some innings then maybe, just maybe....
Dodgers this year?
Fingers crossed for an Astros dynasty!
Fuck you, why would you curse my Brewers? We already have no World Series titles, lay off tree
Thanks for jinxing the Brewers Tree. Now it's all but inevitable that they get destroyed.
Uh oh. I also called Milwaukee vs Houston in the finals. And hours before this video was published in a tweet. Is that good thing or a bad thing?
The Brew Crew have a bullpen now.The Fanbases in Beertown now have something to watch other than the Packers and Badgers.
Fuck Chili Davis...
Stil waiting for the congrats, cubs video
The Empires ready to commence a new 5 year reign. New fans are always welcome and remember you can't be a bandwagon Yankee fan because everyone's already a fan they just won't say it outloud.
So u get an invite to the next nfl combine yet?
The EXACT SAME teams have reached the ALDS. It's almost entirely new blood in the NLDS with some of those teams having not been in the NLDS in a while. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if an AL team won again this year. Just look at the gap between the Brewers and Red Sox. But it depends on which version of each team shows up. On a tangent, with the NLDS beginning today, the ATL/LA series will either be the Dodgers crushing the Braves to win the series, or the Braves win the series 3-? and all their wins are by 1 run.
It will be Boston vs Los Angeles.
Where’s our congrats Cubs and As?
I want the dodgers to win only because Chase Utley is in the team, Go Phillies!
Red Sox gonna win it all unless they pull a Bruins and just shoot themselves in the foot. From an Orioles fan, I rather have neither Yankees nor Soxs in the conversation. I can feel some sense of gratitude after suffering through 115 losses.
This is better than watching tree run and dang watching tree run is fun
Tree: There is a solution to my relentless dismissal of your team... win Was I the only one expecting a SeatGeek plug here?
Fuck I-285
Be a Braves fan Have zero expectations coming into the season Be surprised/happy the team WON THE DIVISION LOL WHAT Gets matched against the Dodgers in the first round of the playoffs Probably lose 4-0 on some dumb ass "infield fly" rule I DIDNT HAVE EXPECTATIONS SO THIS IS ALREADY A WIN FOR ME GO BRAVES OOOOOOOooooooOOOOOOOoooooooooohhhhhhhhh oooooooOOOOOOOOOOoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHH chops himself to death Fin.
I want Brewers v Indians since neither team has won it recently but also so we can hear about World Series Ratings being so low without big market teams. Yet a Former NL team against a Former AL does sound pretty sexy.
If the Brewers don't win the World Series, they are a Legacy of Failure.
WHERE'S THIS WEEK IN SPORTSBALL?!?! WEEK 5 IS ABOUT TO START!!!
Been looking forward to this video since last years
please don't forget about nfl week 4
UT you Been playing f zero gx?
I would pay to see you do a haters guide to college football
Yanks are going to beat Sox’s in 5
Tree back on the baseball diamond is always fun to listen to. I’ll take Red Sox vs. Braves in the World Series personally. I don’t hope this, but I think it’ll happen as Boston is granted yet another champion as they throttle Atlanta. Go Tribe!!
Go stros!
I’ll jump off of my school bridge if the World Series is Dodgers vs Yankees
Go away Houston!
Haters guide to nba season?
The yankees and Red Sox are basically the patriots and stealers of the MLB
Thanks Tree. You jinxed the only two teams worth rooting for this post season.
make next video on sportsball
WHY DID YOU CURSE MY TEAM WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Why does he always pick my teams astros and saints it never works
Stahp UT STAHP! 3 vids in 3 days!! I can't handle all this W I N N I N G
My pick for the World Series ROX vs SOX: The Revengening
Week 4 highlights... It will be heaven if there were 4 uploads in 2 days
Dead after saying god hates us and will be Dodgers vs Yankees ???? that would be the worst
Rip my rangers
Boi what do you mean Stanton did good this year
Do Yankees fans really still hate Stanton?
I'd love for Indians vs Braves but it's going to be either Astros Dodgers or Red Sox Dodgers
CUBS TAKE THE L YESSSSSSS
I hope Houston losses
I just think that the Rockies pitching is too good right now
This is a bad sign.. three videos in three days. Tree may have succumb to some terminal illness.
Stanton is not hated at all anymore by yankees fans if anything hes been a fan favorite
The New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers are just TOO GOOD right now.
Should have just said Dodgers vs Yankees as you predictions
I’ll be impressed when I get this week in sportsball
“The Clint Hurdle Invitational” ??
He has cursed us whyyyyy I thought it was our year
Are you trying to avoid Nfl Sportsball bro cause I basically only watch football seriously
C'MON MAN, I JUST WANT WEEK 4 SPORTSBALL. YOU'RE GIVING ME SPORTS BLUEBALLS OVER HERE
Best case scenario: Braves vs. Indians. The Tomahawk Chop vs. The Last Ride of Chief Wahoo. Much like in 1995 The Braves come out on top
When is sports ball nfl week 4 coming out?
Chicago cubs oofed themselves into infinity
FINALLY doing some baseball again!!! With so much going down to the wire in the regular season it seems like there was plenty of fodder for you long before this though.
Yesterday just wasn't a good day for Bay Area sports. The Sharks losing opening day to the Ducks 5 to 2 which I was at that game and earlier the A's getting destroyed by the Yankees in the wild-card game 7 to 2. I guess I could at least say that the Raiders finally got their first win earlier on Sunday. But it was against the lowly Browns so......
Do you feel the Pain..Yay... Kill me.. . Good luck guys, your gonna need it...
I'm so excited about the MLB Postseason! Among MLB, NBA, and the NFL, IMO, it's the best postseason. I'm definitely rooting for the Yankees, but Houston is probably the AL's most complete team. I have no idea who's going to win the NL.
nah dood dodgers gonna take it all
Hes gonna go off on Atlanta ??
Why does he hate Cleveland so much?
Don't pick the 'Stros... Don't pick the 'Stros... Don't pick the 'Stros...... ...FUCK
Braves are winning the world series
Watch it be the Brewers and Dodgers in the National League Championship series
Ooooooooooo mah Astros are crused :D
Goddamn Tree stop teasing me with Fire Field music and just make an F-Zero GX video already
I'm hoping for brewers and astros too
Thanks for jinxing the Brewers (hopefully)
Where's Days of Our Steelers so I can get a laugh at them? Ravens fan here
Do you feel the Pain..Yay... Kill me.. .
No, no, no... there is only one season right now, the NFL.
Either the Dodgers use the Capitals as a role model to quit choking or they lose in 5 to Atlanta or 7 to Milwaukee. I don't see them making the World Series and losing again or else Los Angeles is just going to cry tears of the smog that fills their atmosphere.
Noooooo. Why couldn’t you jinx the dodgers and the Red Sox
Red Sox lose to the Yankees in four. Book it.
So, if blue is the main color for the Dodgers, why are their seats yellow?
Fuck, I was feeling confident about the Brewers too
Can we please name the play in game the Clint Hurdle Invitational. Low key best part of this video
You had Cleveland and Arizona last year. About that...
Where is Sportsball week 5?
ORANGE CRUSH!!!!!! Let's go 'Stros!!!!!!!
Seriously, though. What is 38HR if you strike out 221 times?
Lol Cleveland is gonna choke again ready for another heartbreak
I'm quite happy with the 3 uploads in 2 days. I'm guessing with the hockey season and the baseball playoffs starting at the same time, he was in the giving mood.
Just glad that the Cubs aren't here. Play ball.
If it’s Yankees vs Dodgers then the league is rigged
I think Cleveland will make it to the finals but I'm probably wrong??
Been waiting for this, good work Tree! Keep this up!
Lol funny you awesome
My poor Cubs... What a bunch of idiots...
Lets go brewers
Tree has been one busy boi this week.
I hope he showed the shitty yankee's fan pouring beer on an Athletics fan at the yankees game.
It’s been a great season brewers but tree picked you to win the nl you’re fucked
There’s 10 teams in the baseball playoffs not 8...
Indians: Legacy of failure coming soon??
BTW Micheal Brantley and Yan Gomes are both all stars. Same with Kluber and Bauer
ROCKTOBER
DAYS OF OUR STEELERS???
I'm glad people still think your picks are poison. It's not as if you've ever made correct picks or anything. Will definitely be a fun series if you nailed it.
At least he'll have a breather in November. His NBA Haters Guide is pretty much "If you're not the Warriors, you're fucked."
Sounds dumb but Sox and brewers. Sox in 5.
Rip Tampa bay rays
Where is Week 4 NFL Sportsball? But this is cool!
I picked Astros and Brewers too
4,400th view 548th like 166th comment
i hate you, my brewers finally make it to the playoffs with expectation and you pull this shit, Im so annoyed Tree
After Cleveland suffers an inevitable defeat in the playoffs, can we expect a Legacy of Failure on the Indians? Their historic futility deserves to be covered.
Let's Go Cleveland!
Next time on days of our steelers
Let’s Go Yankees!
Please do legacy of failure video on mariners, they deserve this kind of video more than any other sport team
Pity you didn't mention the spectacle of this year's most improbable Cinderella team waltzing right into a buzzsaw in the wild card game.
Dodgers v. Yankees would be amazing, just for the simple fact that it’s a stale matchup in the World Series
Welcome to St.Louis! Where both of our major league sport teams lost a wild card position in the last game
Where’s sportsball!!!!!!
You were right about the Astros beating the dodgers.
Shitattle out again.
No sportsball week 4?
WHERE THE F IS SPORTSBALL
STILL waiting for last week's NFL review...
You predicted the Astros would win in 7 last year so I’m not nearly as worried as I should be
Tree? No! You picked my Brewers to finish third at the beginning of the season, and I knew your jinx assured them of an NL Central title. Now you've picked them to go to the World Series? Hopefully you're right this time.
https://deadspin.com/the-haters-guide-to-the-mlb-playoffs-1829512646 dead spin ripped you off bro
Hey guys Guys Hey guys Guys Fuck NFL, we have swingy smashy postseason
Are you going to a Hater's Guide Declassified for MLB like you did for the NHL? As a Phillies fan still crushed by our collapse it's the only thing involving baseball that can give me joy right now
Aw jeez why'd you pick the Brewers? Now they're hosed.
Imo soxs astros. And rockies and dodgers
I’ve had the same prediticion as you for 2 years now... we are all screwed
As a Tigers fan, if Boston does lose sometime, please do a Dave Dombrowski Legacy of Failure.
Yakees fans are pure scum. I'd personally spit your face. Throw shit on me? I'll slit your throat
Come on Rockies
Clint Hurdle invitational ????????
I hope the red Sox lose in the first round so I dont have to listen to the cancerous commentators and I can listen to real talk radio shows i like
U FUCKING JINXED MY ASTROS!!!!!
Lets go indians! just wait till we beat the astros in 5
Thanks for not jinxing my red sox
The Marlins at one point had Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, and Christian Yelich. This team will never ever succeed. Worse than the Cleveland Browns. Baseball's true factory of sadness... Go Yankees
Oh fuck you, Tree. Astros vs. Brewers is the World Series I want, and now because you said it, it will never happen.
Braves vs. Yankees would be interesting
Seattle Mariners: A legacy of failure
UrinatingTree: The World Series will be Milwaukee vs. Houston Me: Better luck next time you two EDIT: UrinatingTree does it again
Dude. This week in sportsball? No? Nothing? Come on man, this could've waited for tomorrow morning. I wanna see what you got to say about my titans taking down the world champs!
Place your Sox yanks predictions here:
Red Sox vs Dodgers World Series.
is patiently waiting for the next episode of Days of Our Steelers
Is it bad that I’m still in shock that the Braves made the playoffs this year? P.S. I have the same World Series predictions as well ?? hope my Braves can prove me wrong tho ??
Sportsball?[?]
My desired matchup: Atlanta vs. Houston My expected matchup: Boston vs. L.A. Dodgers As the Mariners add a 17th tally to their postseason dry spell, I'm going to go sulk in the woeful corner. Don't mind me. I just want to see the M's play October baseball, darn it! >_<
Fuck the Dodgers. Yankees Red Sox are the same team. Braves Indians are racist. Astros already won. Brewers suck. Go Rockies.
I think Houston will lose the ALDS because the Indians can hit their starters very well, but I don't really see them making it past the 2nd round.
I don't care who it is. As long as it's not Colorado or the LA Dodgers.
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? (I'm looking at you Atlanta Braves)
Let's go Braves Chop on to a World Series!!!
I really wish you said dodgers yankees
"Wipe that shit eating grin off your cheesy ass logo's face! You're pathetic!"
Let's go Dodgers!!!!
Astros and Dodgers
When UT blesses us with 3 uploads in 2 days but all people can talk about is sportsball
Did you have to jinx my Astros?! Damn you, Tree!!!
WHERES OUR SPORTSBALL NEWS!? WHERE DAYS OF OUR STEELERS
Drop the nfl vids
If the Indians choke again, you NEED to make "The Cleveland Indians: Professional Baseball's Choking Hazard."
Go Astros
THIS MUSIC!! ALL STAR BASEBALL 2003
What did we do to deserve 4 videos in 2 days, Tree?
??????????
Dodgers Astros again
Fuck he predicted the brewers to get to the world series. Welp, RIP our chances.
We need sportsball!!!
Oh boy I can’t wait to see who urinating tree fucks this time
Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now
I have a question, I understand the Wild Card game is bullshit but why don't you include the WC teams in your "Haters Guide To The Postseason" but do include them in the "Haters Guide To The World Series"?
S P O R T S B A L L ? ! I NEED IT TO TREAT MY CANCER! lol cubs lost. This heals us White Sox fans once more.
Yanks Braves
When you nut and he says "Fuck you spanos" ????????????????
I can't believe my cubs imploded like this lol. Guess you can say, first collapse of the post curse era lol
The Indians are one of the worst teams to ever be in the postseason. Because of this, there pitching will go scorched Earth and they'll win the world series over the Dodgers.
UrinatingTree is my favorite sports Youtuber even though he shits on my teams. Still love him.
Still waiting for Days of our Steelers.
As a fan of the White Sox, I’d love nothing more than to see Chris Sale win a ring. I hate Boston, but with the best pitcher in the MLB, maybe in MLB history at the hill, it’s hard to argue they won’t rape and pillage this offseason.
Now THREE videos in THREE DAYS!!!?!??! I may have just cried.
NY YANKEES!!!!!
Bruh where’s the new Days of our Steelers episode?
Suicidal Cubs fan reporting in
Yankees are going all the way
All I'm saying is this astros vs brewers world series and good job rockies.
And... Where is Sportsball week 4?
That was a good Osuna joke
Who I want to win: Braves over Indians in the World Series Who will probably win: Red Sox over Brewers
Another video??? My god!!!!
This week in sports ball?
Cam you do a video of the upcoming midterms please?????
:( cardinals suck
And do a lolcow for a Portland trailblazers
Never forget, the Indians blew a 3-1 lead.
Dear Cleveland: either win or lose in four so the Astros have a chance against either the evil Empire for the Sox
Regardless of what happens: power is firmly in the AL's hand. If the NL pennant winner wins the whole thing I will be shocked.
Im juat waiting for another choke by cleveland??
Thank you for ripping the Indians. I needed that today. Turns out Maple Leafs fans are extra cancerous this year.
FUCK SPANOS
Now for a Haters guide to the Nba- Oh wait that’s right the league is fucked!
When your favorite baseball team is not one of these teams :(
wait until next year when the cubs get harper and (hopefully) darvish does something
Ahahahahahaha. You thought the A’s could successfully overthrow the MLB overlords? You make me laugh. Long live the evil empire
2 runs in 22 innings for the Cubs in the division tiebreaker and the Wildcard game. What a dynasty they have!
GO ROCKIES!!!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!!
Thank God. Finally I can stop waking up to texts telling me how much traffic it is due to a fucking Orioles game. As if anyone even goes there WHAT TRAFFIC!?
I see tree, i come. Life is tree, tree is life.
Yankees Red Sox get in the bunker until someone wins 3 games in the series the two fanbases are gonna spew cancer all over the internet
Week 4 of sportsball I'm waiting
3 uploads in 2 days. So this is what heaven looks like
Where is nfl sportaball
This year is yankee year.
My prediction that I’ll probably jinx Yanks and Rocks
Here comes 19 people saying “first” like a bunch of morons
Angry Nats fan reporting in
The Yankeeeeeeesssss win
Tree just pumping out videos.
What happened in Dallas, UT?!? ??????
Where's NFL Sportsball highlights week 4 tho
Sox winning the pennant don’t @ me
Yankees let’s get it
the NBA Season is upon us brothers.
First
Yeet yeet
Yesss!
Go dodgers
ROCTOBER
NOT SPORTSBALL
rip the A's :(
first comment
Finally
Holy shit back to back uploads
Let’s go Yankees!
The title is a definite overreach. No mistake , a terrific, filthy slider, but not the best. During his playing years? Perhaps. For the last 5 years, Chris Sale, imho, throws a better slider. Two of the greatest to ever play the game.
Thanks lots for the video. :D
Would you get into a snowball fight with pitching great Randy Johnson?
Diamondbacks best pitcher thats why i have a RJ jersey
From a dbacks fan Randy Johnson has always been the GOAT
Also Full LEGIT.... Didn't need no Juice to get to the HOF. Him along with the Braves Pitchers and Chipper, Last ones you don't have thoughts in the back of your mind about.
Without the slider he would have been a below 500 pitcher. Anybody can time a Fastball.
Ever hear of Steve Carlton or Ron Guidry?
I'd legit be scared to stand against him in the batters box
WHAT A BEAST!!!
THE BIG UNIT
A bunch of these were curve balls
Reminds me of Sale's slider.
These guys re big leaguers and miss the ball by a foot
search up randy definition on google
HALL OF FAMER !????
I watched him pitch in veterans stadium as a kid. I remember it was the 7th inning and I was sitting right behind home plate and 4 guys had radar guns up a few rows in front of us. He had to know it was likely his last inning and he was getting clocked at 100-103mph on every fastball he threw that inning.
Have you seen the highlights of Steve Carlton’s? That’s the filthiest I’m sorry. Love Randy’s but Steve’s is better
Lou would've taken him deep to win the playoff for the Twins on one of those sliders if fucking Ken Griffey Jr. didnt Rob the homer
Chris Sale slider is more filthy imo. But Randy Johnson the most dominant pitcher I've seen in my lifetime.
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HIT HIS SLIDER WAS .......A BIRD ????
I hate sale. But I think his is better
JR Richard had a nasty slider that clocked at 94 mph
Steve Carlton would be a close second
J.R. Richard had the best slider.
Became a star in Seattle. Became a legend in Arizona.
Goose Gossage >
Since when did Johnson pitch for the Giants? I feel like I should remember that
It was a split finger
The split finger? John Smoltz The changeup? Greg Maddux. Fastball? Dwight Gooden. 4 seam? Mariano Rivera.
Do Kershaw curve Edit Nevermind
roblox death sound
The Big Unit at his finest
So glad I got to see this monster play in his prime. Definitely the meanest slider of all time. I remember that slump before he went to Arizona and then him coming back even stronger.
You have at least three repeats in here.
Steve Carlton, Ron Guidry, and Sparky Lyle have to be considered also...
If you can foul tip him, you’re probably a BEAST.
Pls do best 2018 walk up songs, loved the 2017 one
Why o' why did the Expos trade that guy... I know hindsight is 20/20, but damn, i bet there would still be a team in MTL had he been there in his prime
Watch a steve carlton video. No one will ever come close
The most unhittable pitch of all time.
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve typed “Randy Johnson slider” in the search bar... You’re a saint.
Honestly a top 3 starter
I hate that on most of these camera angles you can't even see the movement
Now that he is retired he still slides into DMs
See these are true sliders. They break a lot horizontally and some vertically. Most guys now just throw sliders the look like cut-change ups
When I think about those days all I can do is sit back and smile, as that was when sport was a sport. -----John Cougar Mellencamp.
IN MY HONEST OPINION, Chris sales slider is filthier
When my sliders pitched down from 9 feet 7inches high aren't visible from home plate. His mechanics trashed his body since he was a teenager. Mister Snappy is a joke compared the lightning terror pitches from hell which are not visible from the batters box. The world series teams coming up I could slaughter them with six outs an inning of a baseball game against both teams. Four games punkx
Degrom slider??????
Some stats and some explanations would have made the video better.
4:36 of nasty
I want to see the home runs hit off of this pitch.
It is confirmed: Randy Johnson is Chris Sale’s father
THE BIG UNIT. I miss that guy.
this isn't Andrew Miller????
And do "the best Cutters"
Threw at least high 90’s and had this, basically unhittable when he was at his best
Randy wasn’t human
Rumor has it that his slider is still breaking
The big Unit.
Randy GODson
All the steroids in the world wouldn’t be enough to hit that slider
Sale?
Do "the best changeups and curveballs"
Johnson had one of the best sliders ever, no question. Maybe the best ever, although I think Steve Carlton has a pretty good case too. Right handed pitchers... hmmn, think I'll go with Bob Gibson.
Why do left handed pitchers have this wide angle that makes the ball "swoop"...i cant put it into words.
I go to the same high school to randy Johnson
This video could be 3 hours long.
Notice no one snapping on the ump for looking 3rd strikes. Good times
Steve Carlton
Don't know which is filthier, Johnson's slider or his mullet
Adam Ottavinos???
Hall of fame pitchers vs hall of fame hitters
One of the best pitchers ever
Do a video of Kershaws 12-6 curveball and change-up
The wing span Randy Johnson had made that pitch start so far out or behind batters on top of that he had amazing break no wonder it seemed unhittable
Looks so effortless
I'd put Bob Gibson up there too
Wrong slider pitcher... BRING ME SPIDERMAN OTTAVINO
Denis Eckersley should be in contention
Dave Steib had a wicked one too
This is Chris sale before Chris sale
Max scherzer
Mr Snappy!
Garit coles slider is insane also
I just sub like
Randy definitely the slider GOAT Great to see more of these - such a wonderful pitch and always looked so damn hard to hit
my dick is the goat slider :O
best player ever bartolo colon
2nd place would probably be Chris sale
Hey great content keep it up
Smart play by Baez.......
Do homeruns out of stadium
4:28 doesn’t even show what happened...?
1:28 That's why u should always run on a foul
I’m confused what happen at 2:25
How were those high iq? Pretty sure people taught them to do that. They didn’t come up with it themselves. Look a base, let’s run around
Isnt 4:50 infield fly
2:06 am an amateur can someone explain this
What about Daniel Murphy taking 3rd on a walk in playoffs against the Dodgers?
Infield fly rule?
What about the infield fly rule?
The pump fake to first by Atlanta though....
Do most passionate players/ plays
Locain is the smartest player on the ENTIRE field!
2:48 this wasn't a high IQ play? I would argue it's a low IQ play. Bautista didn't have the situation awareness to realize the runner might try to go home. Nothing smart on Cain's part
Food baseball
Where is the in field fly rule for some of these?
How do you not have Utleys deke in the 08 World Series against the Rays?
@2:51 so how is this a high baseball IQ i just see a good base hit that resulted in a rbi
2:33 When the O's weren't hopeless and helpless.
Next do a low baseball iq moments
I'm noticing most of the "high IQ plays" on offense are just terrible defense
Several of those are just the umpire failing to call infield fly.
Hey Kids! This is how you win baseball games.
It would mean a LOT if y’all checked me out ??????
THE BEAUTIFUL GAME FOR REAL MEN.
Reminds me of when I played SS. Super stardom all the way baby, Praise the Lord for ALL my talents, gifts and abilities !!!!!!!
At 2:10, how does the infield fly rule not apply?
I do not understand this sportart
What's with the Holliday one?
Lady cow actually demand bone hunt entity vital grand successful iron.
0:32 where he go lol
All of these High IQ videos have the same plays
When I saw the title "Baseball High IQ" the first thing that popped into my head is "Javier Baez." Sure enough the first highlight features none other than... El Mago.
2:08 This was about Anthony Rizzo but I love it when lazy guys - Matt Harvey of the Mets at that time - get thrown out for lack of hustle.  There is no way this would have been a double play if Harvey had run out that bunt.  Rizzo is a an excellent player, he saw Harvey give up and stop dead in his tracks a couple feet out of the box, and played the double play.  Only after Harvey watched as Rizzo let the ball drop did he decide maybe he should be running to first.  You might think just maybe Harvey would want to protect or build on his 1-0 lead in the seventh against the Cubs.Same deal with Swisher at 1:23.
combination of smart plays, and inattentiveness by the other team...
Machado psyched the the camera man
What happen at 2:21 ? Oops.. I didn’t see the tag at third
Really nice plays here. BTW, in the video thumbnail, "Let's" should be "Lets", without the apostrophe.
Low IQ moments: ""Let's" ball drop"
Man, run to first...you’d think by the pro level, guys would realize this
RIP Fernandez
Do MLB best reads off the wall
I would have included the play on the sac fly where arenado leaped to cut it off and threw to third
2:47 - what’s the deal here? The base runner realized the throw was going to 2nd?
dude u really gotta fix ur audio
I have been watching since 1000 subs
2:48 WOW this is so smart !!
ALWAYS RUN HARD TO FIRST!!
Báez ??????
I tried to drop the ball at short and the ump yelled at me
I love these plays, it shows that there is still some players out there that play hard all the time and don't just take things for granted.
1:23 everytime i watch these videos i still try to figure out how that counts as an out lol
first
I saw that Miguel Cabrera inside-the-park "home run". It was hilarious!
Oof
I can tell u are a Sox fan , so m i
1:05 um this is actually the most beautiful play in baseball history
im surprised the astros vs pirates walk off error wasnt on here
i never understand how a pitcher can fuck up a infield assist.. you pitch 90+ mph for strikes but you can't throw the ball properly that doesn't need to hit 90
100% CRINGE??????
0:43 that one was probably the most cringe worthy one for me ????
Wouldn’t The last play be a close play if Castillo threw directly to home base?
so why are these called plays?
??????
??????????
"Here's the shortest throw you'll ever see ".... "Just missed the cutoff man by a little bit". That made my day.
Damn that Ian Kinsler for making us all have to watch a 7 and a half hour game of baseball.. smh
I’m a Sox fan and once I saw it was made 5 hours ago I just had to see if Kinsler was on there and sure enough, I was right.
I saw the first one live it was retarted my grandma could make that play
Never show that 86 world series play again
The thing is, we laugh but these individuals train for years and years to get this good. It could happen to ANYBODY..... ....except Manny, this stuff always happens to Manny :D
How is Ruben Rivera's base running blunder not on here?
Betance’s throw had to be the worst play I’ve ever seen
Castillo should hang his head in shame forever for that play
Click bait with Bregman
5:02 Scully is a national treasure.
3:12 Segura and Braun were both on the bag meaning Braun is out, HOWEVER, Segura comes off the bag to head back to first and gets tagged while off the bag and the ump missed it
Jayson werth losing it in the lights game 5 of the 2017 NLDS
Puig is dumber than a bag of hammers.
That first play tho. If Kinsler makes that throw, the Red Sox would have swept the Dodgers in the WS.
Needs more Ruben Rivera.
1:10 ... As a Red Sox fan, that clip hurts a lot less than it did 15 years ago...
The ugliest plays the last 20 years but not in history. A lot of missing plays here.
See its mostly infielders making theses plays??
everybody giving kinsler shit but look at what pedroia did lmao
As an Orioles fan I'm surprised there weren't more orioles clips.
No u
Should have had the two plays involving the Nationals in 2015 where a base hit got by the outfielder and then went all the way to the wall for an inside-the-park home run -- once as the team at bat, and once as the team fielding (same playing doing the hitting and then fielding too, IIRC).
Manny's play never gets old??
Slow roller gets me every time????
Definitely the string of errors from the Dodgers. U-G-L-Y. Hello again Made The Cut. I’m a proud subscriber, and also a Cubs fan
Commentators are kinda being assholes
I lost my mind as a Red Sox fan when Kinsler made that stupid error. Still world champs!
Im getting ptsd from the first clip lol
How the hell do you lose the ball while throwing like dude did in the outfield. Retarded
i jsut got here
hey made the cut!
Hail Donald Trump!!!!
First comment and hi Made the Cut!!!.
If you include "just not bothering to run" as a true outcome, Machado wipes the floor with Dunn.
ðŸðŸðŸðŸ
It's like a competition about who can be the laziest.
I guess I donâ€™t know anything about baseball, because I couldnâ€™t decide if they were saying he was good or bad
Get chart party going
Took clayshaw to the woodshed
Lmfao Barry bonds â€œ eating well balanced breakfastâ€ do you mean steroids ?
Breakfast actually means steroids...
"I just hit ground balls and run like hell
 

most of the time I somehow get to first"
I'm sorry, but the least Adam Dunn person of all time would be Juan Pierre. Someone who leads the world in the opposite of 4 true outcomes.
I don't watch sports, but this is great
Why is the music always so much louder than the spoken word!?
The vid not even attempt to explain what the heck happened to him against lefties from 2011 on. Did I miss something?
Adam Dunn, Dave Kingman and Joel younblood have a lot in common. Look it up
Standing around and getting paid= the average government worker.
Wait, what?
Fuck Pujols
I would like to see an all-time 4 Outcomes lineup.  Does Joey Gallo have the necessary credentials to make the team, or does he need a minimum number of plate appearances?
Damb that music gets annoying
5:41 He talks about how crazy it is that Dunn was so good against Kershaw, but at least Dunn was a very good player. I wanna know how the hell Brad Hawpe is 4th in career slugging against him.
Martin Dihigo had the weirdest career. Best player to never play in the MLB (because he was black AND cuban during the "no black people allowed" era of baseball.) He basically played every single position in all the different teams he ever played in. The most impressive thing is that he was good at every one of those positions. He has impressive numbers both at the bat and at the pitching mound. He played in 17 different teams in 4 different countries (USA, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela), sometimes he would spend the summer season on one team then go to another country on the other side of the Equator and play the summer season on ANOTHER team the same year (because, you know, summer is on December on the  southern hemisphere), then travel back up north and play the next year and so on and so forth.
At 5:40 is it suppose to be Gary Sanchez cause it says gabby Sanchez
Ah yes the big donkey being a donkey against Lefties
could alex keep speak a little quieter, or can yâ€™all turn down his mic? dude is gonna blow out my eardrums
Cool video. Very interesting about Dunnâ€™s 2011 season and just killing Kershaw.  Bryce Harper is turning into an Adam Dunn type player. Of course he is better than Dunn but his game is getting very similar. Look at their age 25 season which was Harperâ€™s season this year and their stats are virtually identical.
I love the content but câ€™mon guys can you possibly be any more monotone and uninspired? At least pretend you want to be there. Letâ€™s spice it up a bit fellas, I could use this to help fall asleep. Lol but seriously, great content just need some enthusiasm.
I have Adams bobble head for the bats in AAA
Disappointed I didn't see a clip of a player hitting a home run and driving to home base.
I kinda disagree with the pointless labor thing haha
I dont understand what they are talking about
Let's not forget that Adam Dunn's nickname was Big Donkey ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I guess playing injured is never taken into account.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
so this is cricket for overweight people?
Pujols is never gonna catch bonds on a team like the cardinals... needs to go to the Astros or something
Is there any science behind momentum in sports? I mean, when a team catches up from a 4-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth, you kinda have a gut feeling that they will keep the momentum and go on to win, and for me, that happens every time, whether I like it or not.
I worked at Adam Dunnâ€™s house. Remodeling business.
That Bonds joke. lol.
2011 was a terrible year for everything
Every person mentioned in this video is a roidhead.
Eather your intro is way too loud or your mics are too quiet.
"Nobody plays baseball for fun. They play because they are contractually obligated. 

And nobody... actually plays... when Adam Dunn is at bat"
Lose the annoying "music".
Versus, dude, versus.
Very Millennialish.  Full of oh-so-funny irony, and also very Jew-soaked.
I remember the Mendoza line being 192. And thatâ€™s without using google. Youâ€™re welcome.
Fun fact. Adam Dunn once had to sit out several games because he stabbed himself trying to open a package containing a movie.
Gaby Sanchez.
Why is this formatted like a religious apologetics video
Ate a well balanced breakfast lmao can't stop laughing at that line
I'm a die hard Reds fan & you guys definitely nailed Adam Dunn's career by saying weird. As much as that guy drove me crazy I always loved him. I kinda miss watching the Big Donkey lay into a baseball. He definitely had power. That's about it.
Can you balance the volume between the mic picking up and the intro. Ouch.
5:38 Gaby Sanchez ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
His divorce, which led to depression, which led to a lack of working out and eating unhealthy was a big reason why his 2011 season was so bad. He really never bounced back to the old Dunn after that.
"lol

Well I was trying to get likes but Iâ€™m not getting 5.3k cause Iâ€™m not MLB"
I miss dorktown
how about an entire team that stands around and does nothing, The San Diego Padres, the Cleveland Browns of baseball.
"*versus 
It's pronounced that way too... ""versus."" Not ""verse."""
"Something that occurred to me, it'd be really easy for any player with exceptional power to turn themselves into a ""3 true outcome"" player.  Just only swing at pitches you feel you can crush, and then swing as hard as you can.

Though honestly it's easy for anyone to turn themselves into the perfect ""3 true outcome"" player.  Never swing."
SB nation
yo the audio levels are all over the place in this video
"For a brief moment, they turn baseball into golf" lmao
Yo speak louder into the mic
Nice
Pretty good, but not PRETTY GOOD
Person on the right sounds like Tyler Joseph
The backround music sounds like an alarm
I donâ€™t have a ton of great memories from the Reds at the time Dunn was on the team, but one that has always stuck is Dunn hitting a walkoff grand slam to win by one run. Legend.
This guy in 2018 would be a 30 million a year man. Homers. .360+ OBP.  Lefty.
Incredible
three true outcome players make baseball boring though...
YOur like Rhett and LINK
Please please please talk about Joey Gallo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Itâ€™s honestly garbage and I donâ€™t know how people deal with it. And Iâ€™m certain it doesnâ€™t have any real advantage at all, 99% of the perceived difference is all in the playerâ€™s head because some streamer told them it definitely, totally makes them better. This game isnâ€™t nearly precise enough for a slightly larger hit box to make a difference at all, and even in games like CSGO, it still isnâ€™t going to mean the difference between getting a kill or not.
Home run, or a walk , or a strikeout
What about Jimmie Foxx? The fastest guy to 500 home runs (at the time) but ended his career as a pitcher.
Even without steroids bonds was a great baseball player
"Dunn was just fine in DC after his time in Cincinnati and Arizona.

Wish heâ€™d stayed there or at least in the NL. That emergency appendectomy took a toll before he even took a swing for the Sox but it was a disappointing last few years other than HRâ€™s."
where do they get their adderall
The three true outcomes players are ruining baseball but I like Adam dunn idk why just something about him I find entertaining.
versus, not verse
As someone who isn't interested in baseball at all, I'm surprised I watched almost all of this video. Kudos.
please make a video about mr joey gallo in the future
When Adam Dunn was a Cincinnati Red he not only hit the ball out of the park he actually hit it into another state. It bounced off of Mehring Way,( a street that runs along the south side of the stadium) then rolled down a slope into the waters edge of the Ohio River,  which is the state line between Ohio and Kentucky.
Adam Dunn reminds me of Mark Bellhorn. He had a similar tendency to be a true outcome "hitter". He was nearly a 50% true outcome in 2004.  He was really the first Sabremetrics impact player in the playoffs where a player with poor traditional stats (batting avg.) was effective on the right team and didn't break the bank.
Come on. Bonds took steroids
Strange audio mixing.
Mr. All or Nothing.
ADAM DUNN HITS DINGERS
I remember when the white soxs got him, I was so excited... then he started playing.
Coaches should have placed the infielders/ outfielders on top of the wall to give them a shot at catching a dinger Lol even though he had his fair share of 450ft plus bombs
I remember meeting Adam Dunn at soxfest a couple years ago and he was a great guy to meet but damn he had an interesting career
Also this guy retired because he couldnâ€™t bring his son into the dugout with him during games anymore
he had a huge dick too
Guys, you may never read this, but Adam Dunn had his appendix removed right after the very start of that season. In 2012 he mashed again. He didnâ€™t take time to heal.
Wgas?
The music in this is the absolute worst. It would be so much better without it.
So basically he was a predecessor to the modern game?
Bonds breakfast was one from the blue and two from the red pills..
kyle schwarber
well balanced breakfasts = HGH
You didn't explain the thumbnail
Barry bonds also took PEDâ€™s
Pinteresting
If Adam Dunn and Rickey Henderson ever come into contact, they'll annihilate each other and release an amount of energy sufficient to destroy the planet.
He is a hero, isn't he? ðŸ˜œ
Not that weird, Bryce Harper is doing a pretty good impression in 2018
would Fouling Out result in a 'True Outcome'? you don't have to run to first
â€œBut then thereâ€™s Dunnâ€
Xd Barry Bonds "exercising and eating well balanced breakfasts" cracked me up.
Iâ€™m a total math/stats geek an LOVE your guys videos! I often find myself looking up your stats and checking them for myself. Keep up the great content!
Can we get a re-upload without that god awful background music? I couldn't get past 3 minutes b/c of it.
I want to meet the 1.3K people that have disliked this video and simply ask why they didnâ€™t like it, cuz this shit is awesome
I feel like this video couldâ€™ve been made in about 2 or 3 minutes.
"Another Anti-Dunn is Victor Martinez, at just 23.6% (8000 PAs, 242 HR, 721 BB, 874 SO)
In 2015 alone, he got the number down to 19.4%"
Did he stop taking "roids" in 2011?
Didnt mention barry bonds steroid problem?
A 3-toed sloth? OMG.
DO MORE DORKTOWN
He also hit exactly 40HRs 4 years in a row
Awesome vid. How in the hell did he hit Kershaw that well?!? Also, Dunn was a pretty great athlete in hs. He was a 3-4 star recruit as a run first qb. Imagine that...
There was one season that Rob Deer didn't get his first single until September.
Bonds CHEATED He used steriods
why am i watching this? im english, ive never even seen a Baseball game
Again. You do not relate your topic with a player of that era.   How did he compare to Bonds?
This is gonna be Chris Davis
What happened to Austin Kearns?
LOL
Dunn was the prototype of the modern Home Run Derby player.  (they don't play baseball anymore; it's home run derby now).  As A Reds fan for 60 years, frustrated the hell out of me.  There should be a stat for how many times a hitter bats with a runner on 3rd and less than two outs, and see how many times Dunn got the runner home.  When all it would take was a ground ball to the shortstop to score a run, Dunn would strike out.  Typical year for Dunn was 40 home runs and 90 rbi.
This was amazing.
Anyone that not baseball fans understood what they were talking about?
Sad...
Between the two of you have you ever picked up a bat?
Purest 3 outcome hitter of all time.
The soundtrack now available on itunes
Ted Williams also missed all of 52 and most of 53
people say Americans are dumb. they should take a deeper look into their favorite sports. this could be taught as a subject in school. fuck me this is so complicated. and Americans understand it...
How could you NOT talk about his long home runs...dude has hit some of the LONGEST bombs ever...come on guys!  Has to be part of his story in every conversation...
That Rob Deer stat is amazing
Remember that time Dunn pitched the 9th inning?
Wow, you guys should think about entering data politics. Seriously, it would help Congress actually work and pass laws
You made an error, the home run king is Henry "Hank" Aaron, not Barry "my head grew 37 sizes" Bonds.
And he quit baseball because he couldnâ€™t bring his kid with him into work... talk about weird
Joey Gallo is going to give Rob Deer and Dunn a run for their money this year lol
1.2k statistical weirdos hated to press the like button!
Adam Dunn: stud AND dud?!
"Speak up, 'blonde narrator'! Sorry idk your name
But you're too quiet."
"versus
[vur-suhâ€‰s, -suhâ€‰z]

You can go here to hear the correct pronunciation as well. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/versus"
I'm not even a baseball fan and I thought this was hilarious.
hilarious.
This video is fuckin amazing.
Whatever we may say, he's one of the most powerful hitters ever. A terrific slugger in his prime
He sucked and he was great
You two should kiss
He's my step cousin so does that make me cool?
Steroids Barry Bonds went from speed guy to canâ€™t run HR machine
As a White Sox fan, fuck Adam Dunn. ðŸ˜‚
"9:00 made me burst out laughing.  
Oh to watch a game of two full teams of Adam Dunns... guess it's called the PGA tour."
GET A POP FILTER PLEASE!
Barry bonds roided. I know you were joking about the breakfast, but just wanna remind everyone the facts.
"From where your sitting, it probably looks like a 24k streak of bad luck. Truth is, it was rigged from the start."
Some of their comments are so dumb, people can say that about any sport. You obviously have to be athletic to play a sport
*sense
Baseball makes zero sens, LMFAO wtf
Some of those guys used steroids to get those homers
Well balanced breakfast of roids
This is awesome.
Bryce harper is quickly turning into adam dunn.
I just remember him and his damn kid with the White Sox. What an annoyance.
Here's a thing that could be done. How many home runs could Mark McGuire had should he kept in the game another ten seasons? Hint: McGuire had the best home run record per at bat in history. He averaged 1 home run  per 10.6 at bats. The next best was The Babe at 1 home run at just 11.7 at bats and Barry Bonds at 1 home run per 12.6 at bats.
This why I don't watch baseball
is it sad that i knew the answer to the least Adam dunn player ever?
I don't watch or know anything about baseball yet I watched the whole thing.
Lol dunn might of had a weird career but he hit some of the farthest home runs I've ever seen
this would be watchable without the creepy music
1:37 he took roids u dud
"You guys gotta learn to mix audio lmao
You almost blew my ear drums out"
I think most baseball players donâ€™t like to run
I can't watch this video cos the background music sounds like my alarm
How many people clicked on this thinking a player actually brought his car on the field????
Lets look at it like this: He had so much power and such a beautiful swing that all he needed to do was touch the ball a little for it to go over. Downside is that he was obviously visually impaired.
The Dude CARRIED 3 of my fantasy teams. I refuse to say anything bad about him.
Jon bois is nothing but consistent, alright. Every video he has a hand in has out of wack audio levels. That's Pretty Good.
Now compare this to Chris Davis' 2018 season.....
I never played baseball...
F
Ruth did it with hot dogs and beer. Aaron did it with class. Bonds did it by exercising and eating a well-balanced breakfast. ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…
Why are people disliking - pure unadulterated stats ? Literally the most non biased video on sports you could possibly get ... so people dislike the absolute truth - pathetic
Ahhh Adam Dunn. As a Nat, he was amazing. Here's a thought for you guys though, if they ever make a movie about Adam, who agrees with me that Will Farrell should play him? Seriously, they look so much alike.
I was watching spiders and Hornets fight and now I'm here. This was awesome though.
I farted
Iâ€™ve met this guy. Heâ€™s pretty cool
Bonds was Juiced
I remember booing him at US cellular
My all time favorite Red!
Also if they didnâ€™t sign them then what would happen when they played other teams idiots
They said that the other 7 fielders are doin nothing they actually are they have to stay in ready position unless itâ€™s caught a strike a ball a strike out and the outfielders and backing up the infield of a ground ball so are other infielders also the outfielders are moving to see if thereâ€™s a chance for a catch even if it looks like a homer there moving towards it
JON!
Note: Hank Aaron if the all-time HR leader, with 755. Bonds and his 760 doesn't count... How many of those HRs need to be taken away because he was juiced up and hit "illegal" HRs.
What's so weird about it? He was an all or nothing hitter... He's not the first, and certainly won't be the last. You know why? Cuz chicks dig the long ball.
1:38  Yeah, well balanced breakfast of Steroid-O's.
fun fact, he went to high school in my home town i knew several people who knew him, great athlete but huge ego. Hope he matured after going pro.
So, what what you're really telling me is I should exercise and eat a well balanced breakfast if I want to hit home runs...
I thought at the start of the video they were saying "The Story of Adidon" and i was like wait a minutes this was made on May first
Dude, fix your mics.  One is loud, and the other is barely audible. Normalize them.  And get rid of that crappy, crappy background music.  Itâ€™s crap.
Weirdest career only having to run to 1st base half the time? Never having to field either? Should call it the "smartest" career.
You mean he took damn steroids many years of his career
Man, sabre metrics are like a nerds version of classic art. It is simply amazing that you can take that much out of baseball stats when I can barely figure out the first 3 stat lines in the batting order from each team in the news paper. Well done lads ðŸ˜€
He practiced Satanic rituals.
"Well balanced breakfast"
lol eating well and balanced steroid/hgh %
you guys...
Adam Dunn was easily the worst outfielder and base runner (on the rare times he was on base) I have ever seen.
I can sum up Dunn's carrer in just 2 words.  Strike 3.
not a sport
So he is the best worst hitter??? Or is he the worst best hitter???
So what does this have to do with a car on the field?.....
The audio sucks.
dork
No way Albert catches Bonds. Not even close man
Adam Dunn went to my high school so this is pretty cool ðŸ˜‚
Your intro is way to loud
lol this used to be a COD team I was in.
Aaron Judge 2K17?
Subbed
Subbed
"HR, Walk, or Strike out -- very very true in his career.
500+ ft HR distances -- several of them  -- he didn't sneak them over the fence.
I think with Dunn, he knew the strike zone very well.

Dunn's operation -- 
1.  He knows when it's a strike
2.   But he can't hit it 
3.   But when he does, it goes out of the park a very long way.
4.   Subsequently,  he puts up numbers that nobody else can (or even wants to) match."
Next up â€œJoey gallo and the worst 50 homer seasonâ€
The video is awesome as usual, but the background music!!!! ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨
Awww man. I held onto such a sick twisted hope when the white sox got Dunn.
MLB players arenâ€™t really paid for their fielding.
Cool video. Also that was the best Bonds was on steroids explanation I ever heard lol.
So the point is Adam Dunn is a communist?
"Explain to the folks at home" https://youtu.be/5r9LsHF71UQ
"Well balanced breakfast" = Anadrol, Decadurabolin, test-400, etc
"9:26 
what do you mean by he's a hero and there's nothing more heroic? and the pointless labor comment?"
5:24 Madison Bumgarner is apparently good against Kershaw
Rizzo pounds Kershaw
"Well balanced breakfast"
Bonds. Steriods. Cheater. Fake.
Lol
This was extremely interesting. Good job guys!!
Madison Bumgarner up there casually slugging .500 against Kershaw
1:42 "exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast. Is that what they're calling steroids now?"
I really like this video, but I hate this music. I cannot italicize anything on my phone, but just imagine hate in the previous sentence is italicized.
Who in the hell has the time to sit down and figure this out.
An American hero
Gaby or Gary Sanchez
GOAT
Babe Ruth is still alive and I ask these guys to make a video on how that's possible.
It says gaby Sanchez not Gary
What happened  to hin
Bonds should be striped of all records no cheaters allowed
7:56 I love Judge and heâ€™s a great player, but heâ€™s going to be on that list one day lol
Adam Dunn is my favorite of all time. Going to the reds games was always exciting when he was playing because I knew there was a good chance he would hit a hr....or strikeout....but he kept it exciting
penis
"He started eating a well balanced breakfast" lmao yeah barry
we need a dorktown bar, where people can go to talk about the most obscure trivia.
i feel like these guys are the voiceover voices for a lot of videos I have watched on American sport.
"Come on guys Bonds only eats a hearty breakfast of Wheaties







And Steroids!"
My dad hated Adam Dunn (die-hard reds fan), said he only ever tried hitting homeruns
5:27 Gimme a moment... I'm just trying to wrap my head around how a guy was able to record a 170% slugging average
1:37 LMAO OOOOOKAY LETS GO WITH THAT....
i wish i could do half of what adam dunn...
"And that's without even talking about his defense.  I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the 2009 season.  How often do you see a player notch 4 wins above replacement at the plate and manage to be a worse-than-replacement-level player?!

That whole Nationals outfield was one of the most amusing 3-ring circuses I've seen above the single A level.  All three outfielders had negative dWAR with Adam Dunn alone costing the Nationals a wopping 45 runs in the field."
Hmmm...I wonder how Dave Kingman compares.  He hit a bunch of meaningless home runs.
too much math for my hangover
Damn Kershaw is a beast
This is the video you show to your girlfriend to explain why you love baseball so much -- right (?)
â€œHe started exercising and eating a balance breakfastâ€ HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This background music is so unnecessary
Chris Davis would be able to put a dot even further on the outlier as DunnÂ in 2018 but he can't hit home runs any more.Â  As of now, 166 PA, 4 HR, 14 BB, 60 K.Â  78/166 comes out to 47%.Â  He was above 50% a couple weeks ago but decided to ground into the shift a bunch of times rather than swing and miss.Â  And the Orioles still owe him over $100 for the next four plus seasons.
1:45 Cough, Steroids, Cough
Rickey Henderson...hell yeah.
I love his name Jon Bois
I dont think alberts on the same nutritious diet Barry bonds was ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’€
The new series is good but I miss the dramatic music and incredible graphics of chart party.
This is awesome
Now Kershaw is straight doo doo
Would like to see it, but don't see Albert passing Bonds.  He looks like he is playing without his legs under him.  Shame. Still one of the Best hitters ever.  He has the most intentional walks of any other member of the  3000 hit club.
Bumgarner hitting .500 off Kershaw and has 2 homers
Two words - Herb Washington.  WEIRDEST. CAREER. EVER.
Adam Dunn: A true hero.
Pujols didnâ€™t take PH Drugs like Bonds did either
WOW! great stuff guys
Adam Dunn once went two calendar years without a sacrifice hit. In all the times he came up to the plate, not once during that perod did he hit a fly ball out that advanced the runner.
"You wanna talk all-or-nothing type players?

Two words: Dave. Kingman. Thank you and drive through."
That 40-100-150 Line May be broken by Aaron Judge right? I mean last year he went 52-127-208. This year he is on pace for 43-142-221 already tying for 2nd place on that list.
Rick Ankiel is up there...
The meaning of life is 42. Just read hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
"I don't even watch baseball, and I came here from a youtube channel talking about Ed, Edd, & Eddy but this was fascinating.

thank you."
I often wonder what sort of numbers Rob Deer would have had if he played now.  He didn't get to play as much because when he played, K's were frowned on,  Now, they're just a part of doing business.  Deer would have played more, and would have put up some impressive HR and K numbers.
Iâ€™m a White Sox fan and his 2011 season was horrible to watch, him and Konerko were suppose to be a power combo but Dunn was horrible, he came back and made the All Star team in 2012 though. Biggest letdown in White Sox history.
I'm waiting for the Henderson video.
Double dorks definitely
Less silliness please.
Donâ€™t forget the fact he didnâ€™t have a sacrifice fly the entire 2004 season when he hit 49Hr. I went to a ton of games that year, it drove me mad!
the music is horrible and distracting
Adam Dunn was also one of the worst defenders ever.
Enjoyed the video
the money saved is a bit of a stretch dont you think. i mean if there were nobody on the field then he could have took a different approach than to homer or strike out... like getting on base with a solid bunt down the 3rd base side... i mean there would be nobody on 1st for the pitcher to throw it too...
Honestly Dunn was ahead of his time. Hitters are trending more towards the "three/four true outcomes" and the launch angle revolution has everybody hitting more fly balls than they used to. Even his career strikeout rate of 28.6% wouldn't be that high today but was very high for his time.
Where does Jack Cust rank on the HR/BB/HBP/K rank on the list, especially when he was with the A's?
The LEAST like Dunn would be a high average, low power, low strikeout, low walk hitter. Ichiro, perfectly.
That chart completely disregards the number of games in each season, you should compare homeruns per game or per at bat!
Iâ€™m subscribing just because of this video
Jon Bois could chart and narrate the science of paint drying and I'd watch with rapt attention.
barry bonds joke was hilariously deadpan
Adam Dunn career was ruined by the infield shift. No that complex.
What they said about Barry Bonds made me laugh out loud in my classðŸ˜‚
And then there is our old buddy Barry Bonds who towards the end of his career learned how to work out (and ingest PED's)  to go along with a well balanced diet.
did you make a new one yet
The fact that Jay Bruce hit 2 homeruns in the same game against Kershaw is amazing!
cant be weirder than charlie sweeney.
For the first 3 minutes I had him confused with Aaron Boone
I like Adam Dunn and I don't care what anybody says and/or thinks. 'Nuff said ...
U WROTE GARY SANCHEZ WRONG AT 5 MINS AND 40 SECS
Two more things to add -   The guy had only 40 career sacrifice fly balls..   14 years, 40 sac fly balls..   Also he played over 2000 games, and never appeared in a postseason game
He also got randomly dissed by a GM of a team he wasn't even on (Toronto) on some radio show when a caller mentioned him as someone they could trade for. The GM went on a tirade about how Dunn was basically a beer league caliber player. Then claimed he called Dunn to apologize but Dunn said he never did. Strangest thing I've ever seen.
So where's this Ricky Henderson episode??
What on Earth was that thumbnail
Dad always said he had a piano strapped to his ass when he would run
Jon Bois is the only person who can make baseball interesting
"Weirdest baseball career since the inception of the sport" - lol and we forgot all about Rube, would up and chase fire trucks mid game.
:')
baseball is alout more than you guys think I play AAA baseball so im not the best but I know baseball isnt just duing nothing
Bonds is the GOAT. Pujols exercised and ate just as much breakfast as Bonds. Just like everyone else in that era. There's is/has/always will be guys who are much bigger than Bonds who hit way fewer home runs than him. But Bonds was a jerk to the sports media so a bunch of pencil necked jagoffs who couldn't hit a 75 mph fastball are getting their revenge. He disgraced the game? No, a bunch of hacks who names no one knows keeping him out of the hall of fame is the disgrace to the game.
BOIS
Very well done! Great dimensional analysis and hilarious conclusion. Loved the balanced breakfast jab.
exercising and eating "well balanced breakfasts" XD
these guys know nothing about the game. this is pathetic.
Joey Gallo is basically the Adam Dunn of this era
Haha, "Poo holes"
I LOST IT AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY MLB TEAMS WASTED LMFAO
The Mendoza line is .220.  Just thought you'd like to know.
This channel is phenomenal.
Gotta love Big Donkey
"Adam Dunn? If you're watching".  The end of civilization.
Well balanced bowl of roids
This was great!!
Could you guys turn the volume up a little on your intro card? My left eardrum didn't quite explode.
All fastball hitters hit Kershaw well just look at the list itâ€™s not perplexing at all
did you really do one on Ricky Henderson, or was that a joke?
LMAO 1:37
As someone who lives in Baltimore, I feel like Chris Davis has got to be somewhere high on that chart of the 4 outcomes
What a great video. I love doing nothing, its my favorite thing to do. I could have been an infielder for those 55 games, i woulda been great at it.
That was awesome!!
This is good. Your sound mix sucks
Adam Dunn was always one of my favorite players. He either walked, homerun, or struck out. This video just reinforced my opinion.
Every Jon Bois video has the loudest intro music on the face of the planet. It's literally twice as loud as his speaking voice.
I have no idea about baseball. I only watched this video for our Lord and Saviour, Jon Bois! Hail Jon!
Hank Aaron??
Bonds started exercising and eating a balanced breakfast ðŸ˜‚
Guys please turn down or choose less distracting background music. Its particularly distracting 230-245
If you not going to insult the guy you don't need to apologize.
This was pretty good...
WTF was up with Eddie Mathews in 1964?
is he good or bad haha
I read somewhere that Dunn actually made a legend come true.  Playing for Cincinnati, he hit a ball out of the park which, with the help of a parking lot and a concrete plaza rolled into Ohio river (which geographically begins the state of Kentucky).  Adam Dunn once hit a ball into the next state.
The background music had me in a wicked trance! Now I feel like a lubricated imbecile .. thanks
BONDS = ROIDS
Career .237 BA. 2,379 Strikeouts in 14 seasons. Sadly, he probably made more than $100,000,000.
These guys dress as girls
â€œExercising and eating well-balanced breakfastsâ€ lmao
interesting video
Barry bonds.. started exercising and eating well balance breakfast... you said STEROIDS wrong
The planetarium music really brings it all together
"Funny stuff.
That game where Jay Bruce homered twice on Kershaw was an epic Sunday night duel Homer Bailey won 2-1, in a weekend sweep..."
Porter Texas baby
Between a drunk penguin and a blind sloth? Thats still better than me.
how about some Dunn highlights fellas?
Great video, terrible sound editing.
Fans in Cincinnati used to ream the crap out of Big Donkey  because he sucked in left field and struck out alot. He made Manny Ramirez look like a gold glover.
Nice to see rizzo at the top of that lefties vs Kershaw list
it was fun playing with adam dunn on video games especially when he was with the reds
So wtf happened in 2011???
Watching this while drunk as fuck
VERSUS not verse.
that was good, thank you, i wouldnt even mind if you dropped the humor next one. the humor in this one was great tho
The quintessential all or nothing ball player. Good player,  nothing more.
Soriano and Rizzo tho
Barry never failed a drug test
He also has a Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club.
So like the mlb just lets players who were found positive for steroids or other enhancing drugs  keep their records?
Loved it
That's what Aaron judge is too
Bruh he from outside of Houston
This just proves baseball has a stat for every thing
Tim Kurkjian, Buster Onley, Jon Bois.
This music drove me bonkers
Donkey
i was at the game when Dunner hit his first home run, 2001. he had the kind of stroke that looked effortless when he made contact...............WHEN he made contact.   the rest of the time he looked like a little leaguer.....at the plate and in left. i'll never forget his walk-off grand slam against the indians
I'm in awe. Absolute unit
What if every baseball game ended in a walkoff??
Watching this video without skipping through it over and over is just not possible.
Fascinating.
HÃ¤? Can anyone explain what these numbers mean?
Lmao pujols is natural bonds wasnâ€™t wouldnâ€™t even compare the two
Barry Bonds is a cheater
Bonds was juicing dumbass I hope youâ€™re playing dumb
Dunn also played a lot of his career batting behind Griffey JR.
Well balanced breakfast ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
Adam Dunn consistently hit 30-40 dingers every year.  You can't do that!
i hate baseball. and most sports.. used to come on and replace saturday cartoons.. bs
Bonds started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast lol,  nice
the barry bonds one at the begining cracked me up
Always hated players like Dunn.   I didn't know that stat vs Kershaw tho.  That's pretty wild.
Chris Davis must be in the four true outcome group...
Exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast...epic.
NO CAPES!!!
AKA The Big Donkey. his 2011 season with the white sox was the worst of any player that season. It wasn't necessarily his fault, management kept saying, send him out there he has to get hot one of these days. NOT.
5:22 I like how Bumgarner is at the top of the list against Kershaw
Ted Williams lost 5 years to military service, 3 in WW2 and 2 more in Korea
He refused to run after a ball in right field that he could have easily gotten to. Because he did not get to the ball it ended up a ground-rule double breaking a guys nose the section over from me.
I loved Adam Dunn. He hit 40 plus homers for 7 straight season. Give or take
Lol Barry bonds starting exercising more and eating a more balanced breakfast, thatâ€™s what caused hat size to grow well after his 30th birthday of course
Stupid music in the background, I couldn't watch it all
Adam Dunn was my favorite player growing up in Cincinnati. I cried when I accidently broke his bobble head the night I got it. He, to me, really was a hero, because he gave me an early love for baseball that I still have today.
Good video but i was expecting them to give a reason why. Why did his career fall off? Why is he a 3 true outcomes player? Why does he destroy Kershaw?
9:51 - 9:57 I wish someone would look at me the way Alex looks at Jon.
this video needs to just get to the point. why is he weird? bc he didnt run bases just hit home runs or struck out. the end.
Any speculation on WHY 2011 was such an outlier?  I literally thought that would be the topic of the entire video and it wasn't mentioned.
jon bois...MORE VIDEOS PLEASE!!
"Hi, Humans. Magic is as magic does. Does magic create more Magic? Does a fire make magic more magical? The flames from a fire, grow to a new form of magic. Everything magical leads to something without magic.

TERRANCE OUT"
Gaby Sanchez
Ah the steroid usage yes the well balanced diet
Bonds also did steroids
When is pretty good returning?
What was Barry Bonds eating for breakfast?
Not every strikeout means no running to first. Don't forget about dropped third strikes. But I'm guessing that he was so unaccustomed to having to run to first that he never beat the catcher's throw.
john 3.16
John Bois is my Waifu.
That was awesome
Adam Dunn became the prototyocal for.mlb now. Walk home run or strike out
gREAT aMERICAN bALLpark is a shallow low 404
BOIS BOIS BOIS BOIS BOIS
At 5:40 you put gaby Sanchez instead of Gary Sanchez
greater sound mixing. the sound effects are at least twice as loud as the speaking audio
"God, he could have broken that strikeout record. He was READY to do it.

When he retired, I was so upset for that reason."
Trending BAYBEEEEEEE
Bonds only beat the HR record because he used PED.
barry bonds didn't eat well balanced breakfasts, he just used steroids
RIP my headphones when the music came on....
Former CHATTANOOGA LOOKOUT! ðŸ‘€
I was a little disappointed in this, I thought it was going to take a closer look at his mysterious futility against left-handers.  Overall, still an interesting video.
"Creator of pointless labor." Haha
As a Reds fan, I have to love Dunn.... how can you not though...
"Baseball is the one sport where is you play it right, you don't have to do anything." That might've been the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
"Oh dear...I love Adam Dunn. And I love Jon Bois.
And now I get to listen to Jon Bois talking about Adam Dunn?

I'M NOT READY."
fucking dorks
After watching this I feel like I need to go sign up for nasa
And with this video, the entire "Nerds are cool" construct has been demolished.
"dunn was not only one of the best home run sluggers in history, but his walk ability (not shown in the video as it relates historically) also had him in the top-40 all-time when he retired.
here is one to ponder:
who was better at the primary concern for a baseball hitter, getting on base, between adam dunn and ichiro?
.364 dunn
.355 ichiro
you read that correctly. if you needed a guy to get on base, dunn was just plain better than ichiro. now throw in the fact that dunn had 460+ career homers in only 14 seasons, and it isn't even close. dunn was just as good as ichiro in getting on base AND had legendary power.
FACTS"
Are the hosts married to each other? Seems do.n
This video is so low key, yet somehow interesting.
joe panik clayton kershaw
Well balanced breakfast! ðŸ˜‚
I love the content, but the music is too loud
Bonds was juicing. He was taking PEDs. Bonds was taking Steroids. His teammates didnâ€™t congratulate him when he reached his big milestones, so that says something.
Gaby sanchez? Isn't it Gary sanchez
this is like.. my new favorite video
It's obvious what happened in 2011: Adam Dunn stopped exercising and eating balanced breakfasts.
If Jon is consistent wrong about everything then Iâ€™ve never been right about anything in my life
"5 singles + 1 double = 7 bases.




Sounds good to me."
If Dunn had spent his career as a DH he would've been a great, great player, bc his offensive value was tremendous. Endless walks and power. His defense - which was truly terrible, people think Schwarber who is actually mediocre rather than atrocious in the field is bad, they talk about him like he's Dunn, but no, Dunn was Dunn - was such a liability that over the long haul it significantly cut into his value. He still ends up a player with like 16 or 17 WAR but if you park him in the AL his whole career he plays longer and doesn't have the negative D value and is a 40+ WAR player.
1:42 yeah thatâ€™s what it was....
Exercising and eating a well rounded breakfast lol
One of the great natural sluggers of our time! Mr. Dunn, I'm sorry I greatly under-appreciated all you did for the sport
Jon Bois is the degree that separates Griffin mcelroy and Chapo trap house. Idk what this signifies
Albert Pujols is probably the best Homerun hitter
Will Ferrell
Background music is terrible, ruined video.
this is amazing
I miss chart party
Hey it's Jon Bois!
Can we go back to Chart Party?
â˜º
Standing around doing nothing 90% of the time is the definition of baseball.
He should be arrested for the money he stole while in Chicago
Gaby sanchez
What a video
Slugging percentage does not properly weigh extra base hits....
Iâ€™m shook
Barry Bonds "started exercising and eating well-balanced breakfasts"  hahahahaa
Who's Gaby Sanchez?
Stat nerds. The least fun nerds
Hysterical!!!!
Barry Bonds started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast towards the end of his career lol!
Please say the entire word "versus," not just "verse."
Good gravy.Â  I finally ran into a guy who's wasting their life more than I am.Â  Wait!Â  TWO guys wasting their lives more than I am!
He was my favorite player when I was a kid.
This is beautiful.
The fielders were hardly pointless.   If you remember later in his career,  they were all stacked on the right side of the infield.  Since I don't consider a Bb and hbp to be a different outcome,  he really had 4 outcomes.  Walk,  strikeout,  hit directly into the shift or homerun
But why did he start sucking?
This was great. You guys have entirely to much time on your hands. Lol
Hahahahaha exercising and eating well balanced breakfasts! Love it!
Ted Williams lost 5 years to war basically. 3 to WWII and 2 to Korea. He hit 13 homers in just 37 games in 1953.
What is this spa music?
CAN YOU MADE ONE FOR SADAHARU OH? HE CLOBBERED 106 MORE DINGERS THAN BONDS.
As a Brewer fan, I never expected ROB DEER to be mentioned in these videos.  Well done!
Aaron Judge was a Four outcomes player last year.
Bond's "Well balanced diet " should be recommended for everyone.
" E X E R C I S I N GÂ  A N DÂ  E A T I N GÂ  AÂ  M O R EÂ  B A L A N C E DÂ  B R E A K F A S T . "
The neckbeard ruined him
lol
"Speaking for myself here, I played the game up to 92.  My last game that I played was in Cooperstown over Fall Ball in College.  Now during my short but very satisfying baseball years I dominated one particular HS baseball team in Upstate NY.  I had more success over that team than lets say half the teams I had faced. For some reason I hit more Home runs off their pitchers and all I can say was that at that time I could see the ball better, my batting stance was corrected by my father before the season began and it paid off.

Now just guessing here, and not relying solely on Advanced Matrix to try to define the game is that in the case of the Dodgers Ace vs. Adam Dunn perhaps he saw the ball better off the Lefty than others.  It could be the Arm angle of the pitcher where Adam could see the ball better.  There are so many dam factors on why he could dominate one pitcher vs. the rest.

Do you know if Adam and Clayton played before, perhaps in College?  So while it might seem odd to you, for those who played the game even at the HS and College Levels we can tell you that the story of Adam isn't that strange to begin with.
I'll give you this on your opening;  BABE would have hit over 800 if he didn't pitch first.

Now for your comment on ""Pointless Labor""  it's comments like this that makes me believe you never played the game."
He was the chosen one!  It was said he would be the strike out king of all time!  You retired to early, I was counting on it!
Funny story about Dunn. My hitting coach played with him briefly in Chicago. Dunn went 0-4 with 4K in spring training. Came back to the dugout and looked at the sky and saysâ€that fucking sucked, oh well. Still a millionaire.â€
I got to watch Dunn play single A ball in Dayton. he was freakish even then, his balls would leave the park regularly.Â  After he left the Reds Is when I saw a decline though.
I remember when he was on the nats. I was listening to the car radio. "A routine flyball... and dunn cant make it to the ball"
The meaning of life is 42.
Lmaooo that bonds comment
How many of those strikeouts were dropped 3rd strikes?, which would require fielding.
I donâ€™t even like baseball why am I here
my first ever mlb game i was 11 years old, ill never forget, it was Cincinati  at  Phillies, and Adam Dum hit 3 home runs in that game
Also lol
Nice, that was a great rundown.
Judge was 392/678 that's 57.8%
"How about judge
52hr 127BB 208k"
I like you dorks because you're cool and like baseball. You forgot one thing in your equation of 54 games- the outfielders craning their necks as a Dunn -hit baseball sailed high over their heads into the bleachers. HRs can't be factored into the equation of watching a game where no ball is fielded because HRs are exciting.
I'm coming around on this format. The three of you have really great chemistry.
Hey back in the early days of the Washington Nationals Adam Dunn was one of the coolest if not the coolest thing about the team. He was the "big donkey"
5+1=6
Like kershall and Dunn were bffs before MLB and they said when I face you let me hit good
1:41 Right...
White Sox fan. I remember how bad that Adam Dunn season was.
One problem with your idea of wasted money on paying guys not to field: in baseball, position players are paid to hit, not field. Iâ€™m a Red Sox fan. Do you think Jackie Bradley Jr. will ever make what J.D. Martinez makes? No. Yet Bradley is a far better fielder than Martinez but canâ€™t hit a lick (except for the occasional Eutaw Street shot). Good hitters who are bad fielders are forced to play the field (well, unless youâ€™re David Ortiz), so yeah, Iâ€™m not buying your point there...
Barry started exercising at the end of his career? LOOOOOL if you kept watching this joke of a video after hearing that you are probably a Trump supporter.
â€œHe started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfastâ€ lol Barry loved his breakfast
Slugging Pct does not "properly" weight extra base hits.  It weights them, yes, but wOBA is the one that does it properly.
Joey Gallo is the first major leaguer to reach 50 HRs before 50 Singles, he struck out 300 plus times already, talk about all or nothing.
You remind me of jim from the office
Joe McEwing owned the big unit Randy Johnson, at least during his Mets tenure.
Love Jon.
Exercising and eating a healthy breakfast. I'm weak
Man that Kershaw stat blew my fucking mind
i couldn't play with a guy like dunn, he would drive me nuts, the number of runners he left stranded must have been high too.
Sort out your volume levels!!
Your full of shit about Barry Bonds. He was on roids!!! Started working out and ate a well balanced meals lol!!! Your a douche!!!
I at least wanted some theory of why.  Was it lefty vs. lefty yips?  Did his contract with the devil expire?
"Are you looking for more great content like this? That's good. Hope you find it. Bye." - Jon Bois' best sign off ever. No sub begging, gets 200K views and 247K subs anyway.
I donâ€™t even watch sports but damn this was interesting
What is the name of that music in the background?
Can't wait for the Rickey Henderson episode!
8:23 - 9:45, one of my new favorite Jon Bois moments.
Weirder than Jeff Franceur?
Great video. Interesting
When Dunn was with the Dayton Dragons (A) I saw him rob a home run.
Also, if the umpire calls infield fly rule, then the fielders are unnecessary, except for just being on the field for the rule to apply.
Adam dunn is my life goal ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
The first player to ever hit a home run into another state!
O
1:45 AMAZING description of Barry Bonds! Nice work, fellas....great video!
Barry bonds also used steroids ðŸ˜‚ you forgot about that
Adam Dunn went to my High school New Caney High school
How does the clock jump several hours in the middle of the episode?
That balanced breakfast does it
just sent this video to the dunn family - I know adam's dad, the sheriff of a town near me - gonna update this comment on what adam says
I have a practice used bat from Adam Dunn
JON BOIS
Russell "The Muscle" Brayan is another good 3TOs player.
"He started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast" ..... LMAO
5:32 Gaby Sanchez?
I can only laugh lmao the only memory I have of Dunn running is absolutely running over a catcher at home plate like the 18 wheeler that he is
Lol I have a Adam Dunn White Sox jersey. He was my favorite player.
Will Pretty Good ever return
Ground rule double is a true outcome
JON
Did yâ€™all factor in dropped 3rd strikes that ended in strikeouts were he had ran to first instead of getting tagged at the plate? I wonder if There would be enough to skew the numbers to below 50% of not running to first.
You had me at Rickey Henderson.
Ah, Jon Bois and you're goofy, charming editing
yes, Ricky Henderson is the antithesis of Adam Dunn.I was recently comparing statistics of Th Cobb(who's been my favorite player since I was a little kid), and looking at some of Henderson's records(especially in regards to stolen bases) are just mind boggling. in many of them, he is just miles beyond the next closest competitors.
awesome video.
I remember Adam Dunn got booed all the time at the Cell
MLB never wanted Adam in the ALL STAR HR Contest.  He would have kicked Bondsâ€™ roided ass EVERY time.
wheres the fuckin car
As a Reds and Adam Dunn fan. Thank you for this
please do jeff locke!
Legend has it that Adam Dunn was also a very good basketball player capable of dunking, and was recruited by Mack Brown (as a quarterback, not a safety)
Gaby sanchez?
This is the best version of this show keep it like this.
Who here doesnâ€™t even watch baseball?
love this
Gaby Sanchez?
Kershaw just felt bad
Aaron judge is going to kill these numbers
Wow
I only clicked on this video because of the terrible Photoshop on the thumbnail
JON BOIS
this was published may 1st.....but you show a picture of pujols as a card. LOL
No google earth? or was it just extremely subtle :(
9:36 "He's a creator of pointless labor." ....... Yup. I'd say the guys who made this video know a thing or two about pointless labor.
" Barry Bonds started eating healthy"?!?!? He started juicing on steroids you morons
.074 batting average? That sounds like my entire little league career... might even be a little high
S T E R O I D S
How did you not mention that Dunn had four seasons in a row of exactly 40 HR. Such a satisfying stat line. Such a minor complaint though, I friggin' love anything Jon Bois does. Great episode!!!
Great video
Way to ruin shit w analytics. Nerds
"His 4 years in Chicago he stunk up the place.

In 2012 he was AL Comeback Player of the year for batting. 204. He won because he stunk in 2011 for hitting. 159.

When he did hit a home run it was a pointless shot.

If he came to bat with RISP and 2 out, it was a near automatic strikeout. 

He struck out 704 times. One season he didn't play for most of the last 2 weeks of the season. Supposedly an injury. Most people thought it  was so he wouldn't set record for strikeouts .

Everyone was so happy when he left. Wish we could have gotten more for the  $64M he was paid."
talk quieter please...
Adam Dunn is da real MVP.
lmao that's great stuff, absolute nonsense
"Ted Williams missed more than 3 years in the military.

He flew in Korea and missed games from April 31 1952 to August 1953"
hit AN home run?
Please...stop the willy wonka music. Great video though
Barry Bum Bonds
Of course he started sucking right when the white sox got him.
Your lighting fucking sucks
I got drafted by Stl., and although injury prevented me from making it up to the majors, I played a while in the minors....so I know my shit. And let me tell you: For a RHP like me, a dude like the Big Donkey presents a pressure situation. On the one hand, locate some good pitches and you can earn a K. On the other hand, get too much plate with a dick-high fastball, throw a flat change, throw a frisbee slider or spin a flat curve and The Donkey can snap your head straight backward and send your manager to the bump with his hand out and palm open.
Rickey Henderson says that Rickey Henderson can't wait for the Dorktown about Rickey Henderson, cuz Rickey Henderson ain't no Adam Dunn!
I don't know if this is just for this video or what... but please turn the audio up on your microphones!
where is Jon?
When they said "least Adam Dunn", my immediate guess (before they said the name) was Rod Carew.  One of the weirdest ever stances, but his BA proved he was right.
I'm gonna watch this video every night before bed because I have trouble sleeping and I think this will help
He was certainly the bright spot on some very bad Bowden-era Nats squads.
You guys gotta fix the audio. I keep changing the sound level when the different guys talk.
I really wish he had played a couple more years...just because
Uhmm... I donâ€™t really get the point of this video
I might be preaching to the choir since I see a lot of fellow die-hard Jon Bois fans... but seriously you need to go check out 17776. Like right now.
dropped 3rd strike? catcher & 1B needed for this, eh?
Baseball sucks. So boring
Every time I thought they were going to go into something interesting they moved on. Iâ€™ve never been had a video leave me with a more empty feeling
lol
This isn't chart party
Pujols needs to start taking more vitamins to make sure his line doesn't cross other peoples' lines. Crossing lines is not fortuitous!
Is this the Bon Jois everyone's always talking about?
Anyway twist yield God disaster head relevant influence plain climate sauce
HOW do you not mention he went from the most home runs in the NL to the most strikeouts in the AL in 1 season lol
I wanted to hear more about his 2011 season...
Bonds and Pujols are steroid users.
Well this was stupid.
Video does not go anywhere
He was from my home town we went to the same high school
Jon looks like Freddie Freeman
I thoroughly enjoyed this video, and can't wait for the Rickey Henderson counterpoint.  I also wonder how Ichiro stacks up.
I enjoyed the conversation. Everyone in a three-mile radius of my speakers enjoyed the theme music.
Only Reggie Jackson and Jim Thome struck out more than Dunn...and Reggie had 7 more years and Thome 8 more years than Dunn did. Only early-career Mark Reynolds keeps Dunn from having the most strikeouts in a season. Right now, it'd take Reynolds 573 Ks to catch Dunn, and seeing as how he's currently not in the majors, but with the Syracuse Chiefs, it doesn't look like he's gonna get that chance, especially since he doesn't have the power that Dunn did.
JON BOISSS
What about the Rube? Isn't he weirder?
Work on the audio levels please. the music is blasting, but i can barely hear you two talking.
"Breakfast" really had Barry Bonds smackin the ball huh hahhaa
Google Earth must be updating...
Big Donkey!
Not all heroes wear capes, but this one happened to wear a cap.
My favorite Adam Dunn moment:  when Dusty Baker told him to bunt and Dunn said ... "We'll just see about that."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE0R3O1-xGE
Haha. We win. They let Bois out of his cell!
I'm a big baseball fan and this was a truly extraordinary video. Well done, boys.
I knew Dunn would be statistically weird. And you guys really talked him up. But my God...I never expected this
Love the context of the video. Did not like having to adjust the volume every 30 seconds. Get an audio engineer or fire the one you have lol
Lmao breakfast of roids
"Where is did chart party???







Really tho John bois is my favorite YouTuber ever"
God has returned
Very Good Video
RICKYYYYYYYYYY
intro was super loud
"Just making sure I understood this correctly: Adam Dunn was absolute garbage against left handed pitchers during some time of his career. But against that one particular left handed pitcher who absolutely dominated left handed batters, he was exceptionally good?

Also, please turn down the volume of the music!"
It was interesting at the beginning but the end with the salaries was kinda stupid.
Why why why and why ??? Do you think playing the music in the background is a good idea ???
I need some john bois basketball
JON BOISSSSSSSS
Bonds started exercising and using roids
Where's Mark Reynolds on these charts?
Omg you totally made baseball make sense to me when you talked about the four true outcomes. Iâ€™m fine now. THank you.
And the other 50% were ground rule doubles
Baseball champion
Yeah... it was exercise and a well-balanced breakfast that was the reason Bonds hit so many home runs at the end of his career... that is just as likely as me shiting a leprechaun holding a bowl of Lucky Charms
I'm pretty sure Barry Bonds was doing more than just eating healthier and exercising.
Oh the reds....we are the Cleveland browns of baseball but still my home team. But hey we still got the cyclones and fc Cincinnati!
All Pujols needs to do to hit more bangers is go see Bonds' dietician and personal trainer, right?
The meaning of life is 42.
Love the video guys keep up the great work
Adam Dunn is the fucking man
where's jon
Ricky still hit dingers, but bruuuuuuuuuuuuh this gone be fun!
You can't fool me! This is Chart Party in disguise!
honestly great vid
Damn Bruce Chen gotta feel awesome!
"Kinda want pretty good back
:( but this episode was better than the first"
Great insights!
Anyone else notice Madison Bumgarner at 5:23? .500 SLG% vs Kersh.
Joey Vottoâ€™s game ages like fine wine.
Surely this is 'Pretty Good', no?
This was awesome
Dunn once hit 41 HR with a .204 BA.  Not to be outdunn, Mark Reynolds hit 32 HR while having a sub .200 BA (.198).
He also smoked crack but...
Much better. Actually bringing the charts from chart party into it! Don't make dorktown a budget chart party, you're better than that, Jon.
Gaby Sanchez
Hahahaha Bonds started hitting more homeruns because he started eating a balanced breakfast! Yeah, hormones balanced with steroids lol
Eating a well balanced breakfast!!!!!! Youre killing me Jon. HAHAHAHAHH!!
Adam "The Big Donkey" Dunn is the only player in MLB history to hit a ball across state lines. In 2004 smashed a ball off Jose Lima that left Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, bounced off the road and into a section of the Ohio River that is part of Kentucky.
This year Aaron Judge has 132 PA, 1 HBP, 7 HR, 25 BB, and 41 SO. That puts him at 56% if anyone was wondering.
I am a simple man. I see Jon Bois in a video, I like.
I love your vids but the audio is always too low.
Jon Bois is the GOAT
Great video. Adam Dunn was my favorite Reds player when I was younger. Everyone thought he was terrible because his batting average was never particularly high. However,  after looking at his his stats today and putting more emphasis walks and slugging, I am convinced Dunn was one of the more underappreciated players in baseball. Dunn posted an OPS slightly above .900 during his eight seasons with a terrible Reds team. The only other Reds player I've seen to produce comparable hitting numbers is Joey Votto.
The AL eats people alive
Rickey Henderson is the real GOAT of baseball. Imo
Only like 4 years late on this topic but Iâ€™ll take it
PLEASE do more of these.
I feel that the fact that Bumgarner has a.500 slugging percentage against Kershaw needs to be noticed
1:42 by "started exercising" you really mean taking steroids.
This video was good, not Trump getting impeached good.
That Barry Bonds joke was hilarious ðŸ˜‚
This wasn't Pretty Good... but it was close.
You guys realize the word is pronounced verSUS, right?
His 2011 season he played 122 games with 11 homers and batting 159... that's crazy
You know, growing up watching Dunn, I always knew there was something different about him
Damn it now I'm going to have the scour the MLB rule book to see if there is any rule against players wearing capes.
The meaning of life is to live.
Make a Rob Deer video
Jon Boissss
Forgot about Gaby Sanchez. At first I thought it was a typo. Hhaha
Socialist slant at the end doesn't go unnoticed.
5:22 ayyy, jeff francouer made it to Dorktown! Say hello, everybody!
Return of the king!!
We want chart party back!
What's with the masseuse music
Funniest thumbnail Iâ€™ve ever seen.
What's The music being used in the background? Really liked it.
Like if you wanna give Jon a peck on the cheek
Thanks for checking on me dad.
Also hit the second longest homerun in Chase Field
He was great on the Nats, but 5 years later you might say his career was â€œDunnâ€
I am a Reds fan so I like Adam Dunn... He's getting elected to the Reds HOF this season...
Jon I love you but learn how to mix your dang audio
bro what r u guys talking about lol
Everybody should read 17776.
I once attended a baseball game when the Baltimore Orioles played the Chicago White Sox, and the whole time the 2 guys sitting behind me were just yelling at Adam Dunn, making sure he knew that there was an 18% chance that he would get on base.
Bois is just Ginger speak for BOSS
Adam Dunn was also pretty much the strongest player of his era. Check out his homerun distances.
I'm going down to Dorktown, the dork's a friend to me.
Jon has an amazing twitter
Bc anything with Jon bois is amazing so
Lol actually good I just like chart party better and pretty good. Will those return?
Remember the time Adam Dunn literally hit a home run into a different state
Rob Deer! My dad caught one of his home runs in the left field bleachers at County Stadium back in like 1992. He made the highlight reel on the local news, and I was so bummed out because I missed it because I went down by the Brewer's dugout ball hawking, bugging Mike Fetters for a ball, lol
Matt Adams homered off kershaw In 2014
THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND JON BOIS
Adam Dunn was the player that originally got me a baseball fan
"I still remember... ""The Nationals fortune rest on the broad shoulders of slugger Adam Dunn""
Great times..."
Adam Dunn was one of my favorite players when I was a kid.... now he's my hero
Wait...he hit 169%? He it 69% more than he was thrown? I don't understand baseball.
You have given us so much to like about this video! Thanks for posting! Alex's use of the word "verse" is like fingernails on a chalkboard throughout the narration. And the word you want is "versus." That change would make this video go from good to pretty good.
I wonder why SB Nation doesnâ€™t have more subscribers?
My all time favorite player lmao
Didn't Adam dunn hit a 535ft homerun
i see jon, i click like.
Anyone know the song that plays throughout? I really dig it.
this is............PRETTY GOOD
One ofbmy favourite athletes every guy made bank never ran put in minimal effort true hero and role model to all
SB nation is finally giving the people what they want
I love RH! Can't wait. The music sucks; make it quieter. I like these videos, because the absolute absurdity makes me laugh for 5+ minutes straight.
Pujols is what 38 he'll be 42 at the end of the contract he can still crank 17 to 21 long balls but 762 ain't happening definitely hall of fame caliber but he's at 619 and 4 years left in that 240mil contract i don't think he'll make it. Come on 4 years left i say AP finishes at 690 career home runs
Make Chart Party Great Again
The king has returned.
I had hoped that Adam "Mutant Will Ferrell" Dunn would stick around for two more years so he could break Reggie Jackson's strikeout record.
Do a video on the Rube.  That would make a pretty good pretty good episode
So by healthy breakfast he means roids
Hey Jon, Upload much?
More fun facts about Dunn, he is in two other rare list. One, he is one of the only people to hit an ultimate grand slam, a walk off grand slam weâ€™re the home team is down by 3 runs. Two, he is in the over 500ft homer club, where he has 2 of them. Since the Cincinnati stadium is right by the Ohio river and the Ohio river is land of Kentucky for some reason, Dunn hit the ball in to the Ohio river which means Dunn hit the ball into a different state
Like this comment if you want card show back.
When Adam Dunn started with the Reds he either struck out or knocked the cover off the ball.
YEAH THE BOIS
Always liked Dunn as a kid because i loved baseball but i only wanted to hit homers that was kinda his thing he either struck out or hit a bomb ðŸ˜‚

"My brothers name is Adam dunn 

Not this person 
But has the same name"
I watched Adam Dunn when he played for the Reds.  I remember joking around that it was always either a home run, strikeout, or fly out.  Those infographics were insane.
I'm a reds fan. Adam Dunn almost drove me to suicide so many times.
Comrade Adam Dunn instituted the universal basic income
Here's a statistical outlier for ya - in baseball right now 12 out of 30 teams have a better record on the road than at home.
Adam Dunn is not watching , but continue
Posted on my 19th birthday! Thanks Jon and Alex!
I LOVE DORKTOWN (I did scream that)
Our messiah has returned to us!!!!
"Adam Dunn is a weird beast.
Thing is, in video games, he was a MONSTER. But he was just like real life: Jack, K, or Walk."
Adam Dunn was also only on only one playoff team in his entire career, the 2014 Oakland Aâ€™s that lost in the wild card game to the Royals. This was the last season of his career, and I believe he was the only position player for the Aâ€™s to not appear in the game. He retired soon after, never being able to play in the playoffs.
He signed my Emperors New Groove DVD years ago when he played for the Dayton Dragons. I asked him to sign my bat but he said he would only sign that DVD case.
jonnnnn
Who the fuck are these two hipster douchebags?
My sentence is: From groundouts to dingers.
Dunn sucked
You are doing the right thing
JON THE PRODUCTION QUALITY IS TOO HIGH YOU NEED TO GOOGLE EARTH LO-FI IT FOR US NEXT TIME
Dorktown is very good.
Great vid!
The other strange is Adam Dunn went over 1000 at bats without a Sacrifice Fly.  Dunn went the entire 2004 season without a Sac Fly.  How is this possible???
Kind of off topic... But who bought the season 4 battle pass
Chart Party Only. I don't like change.
Matt Carpenter owned kershsw
Adam Dunn was one of my favorite Reds players...
I like Adam Dunn.
The Big Donkey!
This was great. Can't wait for Rickey Henderson.
I went on a Wrigley Field tour about 10 years ago.  One of the visitor's clubhouse attendants told our group that Adam Dunn would eat 10 McDonald's cheeseburgers before every game.
Gonna be the same video about Joey gallo after he retires
Jack Cust https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/custja01.shtml was a 53.47% 4-outcome hitter
He went to new caney high school.
Ruth also played less games per season compared to modern players.
Great vid
Great video
I might be the only one but I liked the big lumberjack guy
Awesome series keep it up! Also all the Jon Bois stat shows are great too.
Regardless, it's always fun to watch a mammoth of a human being hit balls 500 feet
I love this channel.
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHART PARTY
Go Reds!
I canâ€™t believe he hasnâ€™t played a single playoff game
WHERE IS JON
"THIS WAS GOOD BUT NOT, PRETTY GOOD"
Is it just me or is the audio in the dorktown videos extremely quiet?
The greatest ambition any athlete can have is to have their story told by Jon Bois.
This was a complete waste of 10:28
Jon I thought your favorite player was Jeff Francoeur
More!
I miss chart party
I don't understand, why do you guys respect Bonds so much knowing he did steroids?
Make chart party great again
"I think Jon Bois knows when one of his followers is extremely sad. Every time I even contemplate my own mortality Bois is there to save me.

Thank God for Saturday College Football."
This was a show but it wasn't Card Show.
Geektastic.
Adam Dunn is the first, last and only dude BORN to play DH....
This is really cool and all, but where is chart party. I need some more smooth jazz in my life.
praise be
that was pretty good
I love it when Jon bois and Jon bois 2 come together to make a video
Rickey is my favorite player ever
Gaby Sanchez
This is one of my favorite channels on youtube. I love how detailed your research is on these stories. Keep it up! Can you make a video sometime focused around the mariners, or griffey or edgar or something?
Every one of these videos Jon makes is time hes spending not making Pretty Good and Chart Party
Jonâ€™s not dead.
So this is like Pretty Good but way worse
As a sox fan I can confirm he was unwatchable in 2011
Show is good. But itâ€™s the worst name ever given to anything ever.
Can y'all just make a playlist with every Jon Bois video so I know I didn't miss anything
HE'S BACK
Ah, that good old unmixed audio is just music to my ears
"""So if you think about it, Dunn's a hero. He forced baseball teams to pay guys a total of nearly seven million bucks to just stand there. He's a creator of pointless labor. There's nothing more heroic than that.""

Happy International Workers' Day! â˜­"
why do you keep putting people who arent jon bois on screen, i dont get it
I'm a simple man, I see Jon Bois, I upvote
Hi, the music is a lot louder than the rest of the show, if some leveling or other audio magic could be applied for future eps it would be very nice please
"there was this mlb player in the early 1900s who would wrestle alligators and follow firetrucks.
Heres a couple of his sites:
https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/waddell-rube
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Waddell"
"DORKTOWN!!!

YES!!!"
this is the best video about a single baseball player since your Franceour spotlight
Hail to the Bois!
This was good, hell iâ€™ll say it. This was pretty good. Also didnâ€™t touch on his power. Of the 10 longest home runs hit in the MLB 2 of them belong to Dunn. He hit a ball 535ft one time that started in Ohio and ended in Kentucky (look it up).
Please bring back Chart Party!
Jon Bois looks like a gnome from the side
WHERE'S JOHN BO...... Oh thanks SB Nation
Not as good as chart party or Pretty Good
I'm starting to enjoy these as much as Pretty Good/Chart Party. I hope the injection of other personalities and the added outside research and perspectives helps these come out more often.
I didn't watch this video but I heard it had Jon in it. Hey, Jon.
Where's chart party?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Adam Dunn quoted saying something along the lines of "I don't even like baseball, I only play because I'm good at it and I get paid a lot of money to do it" ?
Alex may be the mayor of Dorktown but we all know he's just a figurehead for Supreme Commander Jon Bois.
Jon Bois is the true hero.
"B O I S
O
I
S"
This was party but it wasnâ€™t chart party
Bois!!!
this is good...but it isnt...
welcome to College Football Saturday
I literally stop whatever I'm doing when I see that a video bearing the visage of Jon Bois has been uploaded to the World Wide Web.
Thank god you ditched that sad, brown couch.
Does this count as a Pretty Good episode?
If by â€œwell balanced breakfastâ€ you mean â€œinjecting himself with horse semenâ€ then yes.
B.o.i.s
You can see a preview of Ricky Henderson on one chart from their 8 runs on 9 Pitches (Fernando Tatis half-inning video).  The guy was an INSANE base stealer.
1:37 "he started excising and eating well balanced breakfasts" lmao
Ah, good ol' 'No-run' Dunn.
This was way better than the first episode.Almost pretty good.
This was OK but not Pretty Good
Itâ€™s yo Bois
JoN bOiS
Oh my god that was an amazing video.
Yeah, he ate that special brand of cereal called Roid-O's.
This was pretty good... but not Pretty Good
I'm new here can someone explain the Jon bois meme to me lmao
Great Video again as always. #Dorktown
"he started exercising and eating a healthy breakfast" Roid-Os
Joey Gallo literally set a higher record for "four true outcomes" last season.  532 PA, 41 HR, 75 BB, 196 K, 8 HBP = 60.1%  THE NEW GOD.
John Bois sneaks in. Good thing I chose to watch this
*Adam Dunn has reasonable to nice hair
BOIS
'well balanced breakfast' that makes you double in size
you know a Jon Bois video just by the thumbnail
As a reds fan, I always said Adam Dunn either hit a home run, struckout, or walked, just by watching him on a day to day basis. Cool to see that my idea actually is confirmed in statistics
ALL HAIL JON BOIS !!!!!!!!!!
The GOAT. Great research and excellent presentation. Can't get better than SB Nation
Daddy is home #saturdaysareforthebois
Hey this is pretty good!
JON BOIS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR
this was good, but not Pretty Good
Oh hai John. You aren't working on any special projects are you?
YEAH BOIS
Is there a John Bois podcast? Because I would watch the hell out of that.
Bring back chart party.
"Towards the end of his career he started... exercising and eating well-balance breakfasts". :D
This isn't Chart Party or Pretty Good so I'm unhappy
This is pretty good
Drunk penguins and blindfolded sloths hit very well
Dunn and my baseball classmate were #1 and #2 in steals in the Houston area
God bless Jon Bois
8th
JON GODDAMN BOIS
Like if you love Jon Boissssss
Boiiiiis
BOISTIFICATION SQUAD!!!
All hail the King!
JON!!!!!
Yay more jon Bois
HES BACK
BOIIIIIIISSSSSS
