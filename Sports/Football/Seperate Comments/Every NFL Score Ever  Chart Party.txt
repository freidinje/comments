Then explain why the nfl put out an article saying the patriots almost scored the first 1 point safety against the bills on 10-29-18
Awesome video mate!!!!

I've got a significantly better scenario for the 6-1 game.  It might even be borderline plausible.   First of all, we're gonna put the game in very poor weather conditions (rain/snow/sleet).   Now, after one team scores the touchdown, they go for the extra point, which is snapped from the 15 (13 yards closer to that safety than going for two).    Maybe we tack on some extra yards for a penalty or two.   Now we can get some kind of chaos on the PAT (bad snap, blocked kick, etc).   The defense recovers the ball, tries to return it for two, and a fumble occurs near the goal line (in part due to the ball being wet and very difficult to handle).  We get a recovery by the kicking team and a retreat into the endzone with a tackle for a one point safety.
This video was awesome
Um you can score 1 point it is called a feild goal safety it is when you try to score a field goal and get it back all the way to your own end zone
Hear me this. I Cordell Erskine bring of sound mind and good faith do solemnly swear, if 6-1 scoragami is ever achieved, I promise on that day I will begin the process of getting a sex change.
"Washington NFL Team" Perfect.

2018 Scorigamis: 48-40, 29-29, 43-40, 37-5 GGGGGG
What would suck is if a team actually scored the 1 pt defensive safety, but then also scored a fairly rare regular safety in the same game, and ended with 3 points. That would kill every Scorigami lover out there.
Another scorigami on 10/22/18 between the Colts (37) and the Bills (5)

Most interesting video I've seen in months
Ik I'm almost 2 years late but you win a game 2-0 on a forfeit because nobody gets credit for a safety
Who else could see the Browns losing 6-1
I just realized how close the bears had gotten to that last year against Pittsburg it was a pick that he ran all the way back and fumbled in the end zone but it ended up going out of bounds
Cmon chiefs you almost had it 40 - 43 so close to making it happen again
"That was sad, let's keep it sad."
I don't get it.
My team made scorigami last night 42-54
The only reason the scorigamis got higher is because black people started to play in the nfl
I LOST A GAME IN HIGH SCHOOL 4-3. I feel like nobody ever appreciated it so this video makes me very happy.
WE NEED AN UPDATED VERSION!!!
I like to revisit this gem from time to time. #HeresToYou4-4igami

This is such a 2 am YouTube video
A 1 point safety is possible look it up it’s super hard and awkward but it’s possible
this video keeps appearing in my dreams. idk why, but i cant stop thinking about it, its so fascinating. i need updates on scorigami after every season. please, someone. if you see this, do it for the children, we need this.
How am I just now finding this video
Wonder how much Doug Pederson will get for going for two quite often
I think I watched this like month after this came out and I’m back lol
Always knew there was something special about 43-8
There is a one point safety, yes, you can get 1 point.

For some reason this reminds me of a hypothetical super bowl of The Packers vs The Patriots when both teams were 1 and 2 Offense...and 31st and 32nd Defense. Analysts were joking the score was going to be 98 to 91 with over 900 total yards on offense.

Pats-Chiefs 43-40 Anyone?
"I never considered how unlikely a 14-8 score would be just strategically. There's no natural scenario where it'd make sense to go for two when it's 0-0, 7-0 or 14-0, so it'd have to be a situation like a team is up 11-0, the losing team scores and goes for 2 to make it within a FG, and then the winning team tacks on a FG at the end.

Either that, or it'd have to be a situation where a team goes for 2 regardless of the score. This commonly happens in adverse weather, which then makes the other team getting 14 points less likely. The remaining scenarios are like the kicker pulls his groin missing the first FG attempt of the game, so they just go for 2 the rest of the game."

Cfl you can get one point for missing a field goal
How much do I have to pay you to make basketball videos like this
Why are you even including the odds of an overtime game in your 4-4 calculation, by assuming it's 4-4 you are already assuming that it does go into overtime so the odds should be 260x less
But youre scenario for the 1 üoibt safety would be a touchback... Team a would have had tonrecover the ball before the endzone then run it back and the get tackled.
"15:11 ""...because it's a word I made up""
Lol"
"I'm in the severe minority here, but I'd love to see you do a scorigami for rugby. Like american football, there are plenty of combinations. You've got the 3-point penalty goal, the 5-point unconverted try and the 7-point converted try. 
Its cousin rugby league (no they are not the same) is even better for scorigami because you have the 6-point try, the 4-point unconverted try, the 2-point penalty goal and then the 1-point field goal. That last one makes essential any score possible, if not extremely rare. I've seen scores in top level rugby league of 8-1 or even 2-0."
Ive watched this before but i love this vid cause i love the music at the end.
What is a 5 point play in basketball?
"Was the AFC division playoff game between the Steelers vs Chiefs in 2017 Scorigami? It was 18-16

Edit: Nevermind, it isn’t."
I love this video so much and often come back to rewatch it. Probably my favorite part is that observant fans come back after every new scorigami and comment about it. Also my one hope is for Jon Bois to reappear and save us all!
11-4 is my ultimate scorigami!
Can I have a part 2???
I would like to know what the most common scores are through NFL history like top five
6:26 Washington NFL team?  Oh....you mean the Redskins.  The Washington Redskins.  The team from Washington that is called the Redskins. I don't know if this was a mistake guys, but it seems you forgot that the NFL team in Washington is called the Redskins.

How do they score one? A blocked extra point ran back for a score?
I like the idea of the NFL adopting the one-point rouge. Somebody should start a petition!
I’m confused about the 2-0 Akron safety. So did Akron block the punt, then the ball hit the fence at the end of the end zone, and then an Akron player picked it up?
I thoroughly enjoyed the Seahawks segment. Go Hawks!
There actually was a one point field goal made in college in the 70s, didn’t watch the whole vid so idk if he said that but just sayin, cu. of that any score should be possible
Nice music 10x louder than voice.

Why is it impossible to get 1,2,3,4,5,7 to one?
1-0 is possible lmao
Can score 1 point by safety on 2 pt coversion
I have no interest in American football, but this video was really interesting and well made
You said "Until the day [the defensive 1 point conversion] is done, there will always be one hole on this board," but actually there will always be one ENTIRE ROW on the board.  Even if the 6-1 happens, we'd still have the like 13-1, 16-1, 20-1, 27-1 (etc).  And those are the easy ones.    8-1 would be the 6-1 plus a safety.   10-1 would be the 6-1 plus TWO safeties.    10-1 might be the most impossible of the achievable Scorigamis (i.e., not something ridiculously high scoring like 1807-1800).
So the bears have sucked since the beginning?
Bravo if you’re watched this whole thing

Isn’t a pick six on a two point conversion two points as well?
Scorigami Week 1 2018 Bucs vs Saints 48-40
The rouge is stupid, I hope the NFL never adopts it.
It's one thing for that 6-1 score to happen, but for it to be only highlight of the game is another
"Week 2 2018: two scorigamis already this season. Packers tie Vikings at 29; Bucs beat Saints 48-40.

Here's to many more this season, including the elusive 20-11."
This is my entire reason for loving football.
The rouge is cool but being how the NFL doesn't want kick returns, it won't happen.  I have seen a CFL game where teams kept punting it back and fourth on the same play.  The game was tied with no time left and if the team backed up didn't get the ball out of the end zone, which by the way is 20 yards deap, the game is over and they lose.  There was one time where a team was kicking off right before half time.  They kicked it short and the player who received it instantly punted the ball back.  It landed in the kickoff team's endzone with no time left for 1 point.  I posted a picture on Facebook where a game started at 1-1.
so youre saying that we, seahawks fans are unbelievably loud? damn right we are!

How much time did you spend on this. Love the vid btw
I think it can happen. All someone has to do is get too cocky and then the ball gets stripped and then recovered and then the tackle and all that. The hard part would come with keeping the game scoreless till the end.
You can get a point by making a drop kick

I don’t think that would be a safety it the team recovers the ball in the end zone I think it would be a touch back. Not if he recovers the ball at the 1 then runs into the end zone and is tackled it is a safety

6-1 is going to happen week 1 2018
About that 6-1... LA Tech vs MS State
Forfeits are 2-0 because that’s the lowest possible score.
So 6 to 1 is possible, but that means that ANY NUMBER to 1, 8 to 1 or above, is also possible..
It doesn't help that its the dumbest sport in the world. Running into each other at high speed to get hold of a weird looking ball that you can't kick (unless the rules allow) across a line or in between two poles.
Well the chart says...
Found this video with no views, incredible stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawcHSpzRLk
you are forgetting about the very obscure 1 point safety
Canadian Football League is better
Why did this give me chills?
I dont understand what it takes for a game to be a scorigami game
There is actually a 5th way to build up 8 points exactly. It would have to be 8-6 in order for it to happen. A touchdown with a missed extra point, then an opponent touchdown with a blocked extra point, fumbled two-point attempt, or intercepted two-point attempt for a defensive two-point conversion. (6-0 then 6-6 and finally arriving at 8-6)
Idk if I’m proud or ashamed I watched this whole ridiculous thing. I was entertained, I must say
Yo. Good job with all the research. You worked hard. You deserve more views because you actually worked
Washington "NFL team?"  No, they're the Washington REDSKINS!!  No "PC" please!

In madden like 2011 or 12 me and my brother accomplished the 1 point play a couple of times on purpose.
At Syracuse, Donovan McNabb threw an interception at the goal line that was returned to the opposite goal line.  McNabb chased the defender down and forced a fumble.  It would take a s in molar play to get that 6-1 score. Does anyone remember that mcnabb play? Cant find it on youtube....
What software was this made in?
Bro you forgot that rugby can also work for scorigami, what with the 3 point penalty, the 5 point try, and the 7 point converted try.
This and the Barry bonds video are my favorite Jon bois videos
Scoragami CFL?
5-0 Browns vs Eagles
We just got a 5-0.
His good idea of a game is no defense?
3:20 you say "2" but your chart clearly shows four games that fit the criteria
Isn't 1-0 the official score of a forfeited football game, and therefore possible?
This video needs an update on the what's happened.
Scorigami Thursday 8/23/18 (yeah yeah ik it's pre-season) but we have an 0-5 with the browns beating  the eagles!
Miami (the U) defeated Florida 31-4 in 1987, the only college game I know in recent memeory where a team had four points
The 1970 Cowboys had two scoragami games in three weeks: 6-2 at Cleveland and 5-0 vs. Detroit in the divisional playoffs
The only people that dont like shutouts are casuals or people that never played. Watching a defense impose its will is just as exciting as a great offense
4:37  I'd guess the odds aren't exactly like that, considering teams that don't score in regulation probably have a LOT higher chance of remaining scoreless in overtime.  Also,  a team that gets a safety is probably significantly more likely to get another one than random chance.
Watched this again just to see if the Browns 5-0 win last night was scorigami
The browns just beat the eagles 5-0 in preseason
Browns just beat the Eagles (in preseason) 5-0!!!
When some coach is just styling on kids and up 30+ to nothing late, they should go for two and tell the RB to book it all the way to his own endzone to give the other team exactly 1 point.
5-0 SCORAGAMI TONIGHT
Idk if preseason counts but the browns just beat the eagles 5-0, which is a scorigami
44-33 Jags Niners last year
5:17 today we call them soccer fans
I spend hours a day on Pro Football Reference
Me 16 minutes in: JUST GET TO THE GODDAMN 6-1
This is literally my favorite video on YouTube
I kinda want a new updated version for 2018-2019
Raiders blew a 34-14 lead
I am going to find a way to force a 6-1 game in madden 18
Louisiana tech
I love a good defense, so the idea of a 4-4 game with only safeties would be a dream come true. For me, that says two perfect defenses fighting it out.
So, 4-4 or 6-1 which is less likely?
How about we change the rule that it's a touchback if you fumble the ball into the end zone. Let's call it a rouge and unleash more opportunities for scorigami!
College Football Scorigami?
1-0 is possible the college blocked safety could happen on a field goal attempt
Just try to imagine an 8-1 game
"Hey Jon, someone on the CFL subreddit made a CFL scorigami, there's a link here

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFL/comments/6v8rje/i_tried_my_hand_at_making_at_cfl_scorigami_sheet/

Cheers"
"Uh the closest thing to a 1 point score is louisiana tech vs Mississippi State in college 




You know the play"
Did it on backyard football!
Bears steelers 2017 thats how the one points gonna be scored
Will there ever be an update to the scoragami video?
I can see Jim Marshal Running the wrong way for a 1 PT safety.
At least give /r/nfl some credit for keeping up with Scorigami
This is one of the best things on Youtube.  Seriously brilliant.
jon is a very special bois
can we get an updated chart!
5:16-5:29 1980's Arsenal fans
Make chart party happen again!
Song in the beginning?
"@SB Nation +SB NATION
""or Tyer"" ? i know someone with the family name Tyer ... now for real tho, what did Tyer mean on the chart?"
How does this not have millions of views?!
13:28 They should've kicked Chris Gardiocki in the balls
BRING BACK CHART PARTY!!!!!
Has there been an updated scoregami chart uploaded anywhere?
They should update this video with the scoragami of the past two years
"The 6 to 1 score reminds me of Leon Lett and Don Beebe. Obviously it is super unlikely, but to say that it could only be drawn, but couldn't happen, would also have to say that Leon Lett could not possibly have been chased down and stripped by Beebe. At that point it would only require an unusual bounce, which is common place.
I remember that ""Fail Mary"" game on Monday Night Football a few years back too. The Packers refused to come out and line up for the extra point after that bad call, and if they had not sent anyone out there on that play, would they have reversed the score on that game to be a 2-0 win for the Seahawks, or would they decide that the score already dictated a Seahawk win and wouldn't need to be changed? You mentioned that rule, and I was wondering if it has a clause for if the team decides not to play after Half time or something."
There was 6-4 game in college in 2004. Iowa 6 Penn State 4. Look it up.  No wait, do yourself a favor and dont look it up.  Worst offensive game ever!
Obviously this gets vastly easier with high school and college games.  A friend of mine from a Missouri high school ran back a blocked extra point to score one point.  So 6-1 was possible under their rules.
I'm sure this has been said but when Jon describes the 6-1 game, I always imagine a Leon Lett type situation. doesn't seem that impossible for someone to get cocky & not hear footsteps behind them.
imagine... that BOTH teams get the 1 point-defensive safety in the same game, and the game score was 7-7. a very common score that was achieved by accomplishing the practically impossible, twice
What are the songs in the beginning and end
A masterpiece!!! The only good YouTube video
This was so much more interesting than it had any right to be.
Actually you are wrong on a 1-0 score. Theres one way it could happen, during a field goal, the defence can grab the ball before its kicked and get a 1 point safety if downed trying to loop around back in their endzone
You forgot the drop kick which I think is 2 points.
Football is for air heads
If a play like the Louisiana Tech 3rd and 95 can happen, the 1 pt safety could happen
The dark scorigami music makes me uneasy
I don’t even watch football. And I’m like woah haha
Anyone over the age of 60 want to fill me in???
10-1 would be more rare
This is what religion used to do for people.
Make an update to this
The NFL needs to adopt a rule from rugby to help cut down on scoring.  First, have a second set of hashmarks five yards either side of the regular ones.  Second, wherever a touchdown is scored, that's where you have to kick the PAT.  If you score up the sideline, the kicker gets a very sharp angle, which means more misses.  Or, players try to enter the end zone on the middle of the field and risk being tackled or fumbling the ball.  The same goes for field goals, they have to kick from a wider angle.
9:12 that’s happened before
This guys videos are legendary
What about a 1 point safety you crackheads
This is a great video very interesting
Chart Party is so creepy but it’s so interesting.
2:12 I feel like Jon placed that 4000-3000 X mark exactly to scale.  I seems like something he would do.
What is more unlikely of a final score? 6-1 or 4-4?
fantastic video, fantastic animation.
Love the video but you should have made it a heat map.
can someone explain the college 1 pointer? I didn't understand what that was about.
don't worry Jon Boi I'll continue scorigami for you
Do a chart party about how shitty of a franchise the bucs have been, could call the video the 'Bad luck Bucs'
1 Point safety?
music is on point. what is it?
"A 1-1 1-2 1-3 and so on are possible through the dropkick it is a when the quarterback drops the ball on the ground and kicks it either after it bounces or while it is on the ground through the uprights and it counts as 1 point 

The last dropkick was made by Doug Flutie on January 1,2006"
Are you keeping this chart up to date somewhere?
I live in AL and there was one game a couple years ago between Spain Park and Austin that ended 5-3
This is SPORTS AMAZING
SB Nation’s VSauce
"There is a chap here in Australia who does a similar thing with the final scores of games in the Australian Football League - an example of his work can be seen here:

https://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Micro%2BNoises%2B195%253A%2BBring%2Bback%2Bthe%2B90s%2521/2912"
The most unlikely score I can imagine is 10-1. It's just like the 6-1, but the team that scores a touchdown also needs 2 safeties.
I think the 6-1 could happen if a defender celebreated early and then the ball went through the back of the endzone on an interception or fieldgoal block
OK scoragami is probably my new favourite stats thing. We need to find more sports with weird point increments and do somethin similar to those sports.
cant forget the college football 98 yard safety
Pretty sloppy statistical analysis, but I still love it.
The Os were up 3-0 that game
Brilliant. Magnificent.  And brilliant.
What about the 1 point drop kick?
A score of 1-0 is possible in the CFL (Canadian Football League).
Not since I started listening to podcasts like 99%invisible have i wanted to quit my job and do what you do.  Only, I could never ever approach your artistry.  i bow to your content made all the more awesome by the way your painstakingly nonchalant delivery ( that saxaphone!) I know you know that was an oxymoron I know this b/c You sir, are brilliant.  This i like my 10th thing of yours that i've watched and it is awesome...I don't think anyone else I know would enjoy this...except my 4 year old because for now he likes whatever I like, o i'm kinda in my own echo chamber here.  Anyway, good job and thank you.
"Wait... other than 6-1, why isn't the entire 1 row blacked out? You can't get a score of 21-1, can you?

edit: not sure why I felt that this video required a third re-watch, but here I am."
Seahawks still should have ran the ball
@7:13 bad memories ... we were up in the 3rd inning too. 3-0.
What is the most common NFL score?
Hey, there was a college play that led to something like 3rd and 93 from scrimmage. Granted, it wasn’t on a PAT, but I still hold out hope for the one-point safety.
i want to see a 6-1 now... just for the highlight reel... just for the refs standing on the field confused and staggered, except for one, hes the one who watched the sb nation video on this, he gets excited and starts celebrating before he calls the 6-1 scoreline
The Rouge Rule seems like a good idea, WAAAY too many touchbacks these days, so what the NFL should do is move the kicking team back another 5-10 yards and if the receiving team fails to advance the ball out of the endzone or the ball lands in the endzone without going out of bounds it results in one point for the kicking team. It would stop a lot of the useless special teams appearances these days during kickoff and make the game a bit more exciting.
4:45 Our Solar System makes a complete orbit on the Milky Way galaxy about once every 230 million years or so. So that means we would make about 7.3 trips around the galaxy before that 4-4 game ever happens.
That transition at 1:00  lol
you made this seem like an old legend
"Honorable mention: 5-0 scorigami in the playoffs.  Dallas beats the Lions.  I forget when -- the 80's?  The Lions are in the playoffs so infrequently (and they've won only one playoff game since, oh, I don't know, 1958?), that this deserves some kind of honorable mention.
And actually, I don't know whether it was the first time that score happened, what with all the weird low scores early on.  But it's probably the LAST time that score has ever happened.  (A reverse scorigami?  Or a imagirocs?)"
That 1922 season looks awesome to me. Go defense... which is why I sometimes find it hard to watch
"I think a 6-point play is possible (might've been done)

3 pointer
and 1
misses, catches own rebound, another 3 pointer"
Did you make this in prezi?
4-0 is the best possible football score.
Can someone link me this music ??
Can someone explain the "5 point play" he has listed for basketball?
I thought I was going to hate this video....the core concept / first minute was just confusing to me.  I had to restart it twice but I really like what you did.  Lots of hard work obviously went into this.  Great job.
10-1 is the scorigami holy grail
7:02 Basketball 5 point shot???
The most likely way to hit 6-1 is either a coach or player deciding to do it on purpose. Snap the PAT and run straight back through the endzone.
The oddest score I ever saw was in 1970 when the Dallas Cowboys beat the Detroit Lions in a playoff game, 5-0 !!!!!!!!!!!
What about an extra point conversion when the defence takes the ball, and then goes down the field and drop kicks it for 1 point?
Music?
God my homework is gonna be late but this is so much superior
What about the 1 point safety?
Rugby union is interesting, too: in the modern game, scores of 1, 2, and 4 are impossible since scores only come in groups of three (penalty/drop kick), five (try without conversion), and seven (try with conversion). However, scorigami is harder to come by since conversions can be a LOT harder than extra points in American football, meaning otherwise “unusual” scores are not only possible, but common.
Oh it can be done. Ray Claybon on his way to the first New England Patriots' kick off return for a touchdown spiked the ball on the five yard line. Oh it can be done.
We need a yearly update on this chart to see its progression through the years
"0:45

Can someone tell me or send me a link to what this song is called?"
A 1 point safety is possible but has only has happened
That 6-1 type play sort of almost happened in a college football game in the 2017 season
There is a 1 point safety. Look it up.
It's Jim harguagh dammit
What is that song at the beginning? I love it!
You can't have 0-0 because there would be an infinite over time?
I think 10-1 is the score we should all aspire to
I dunno what it is. I’ve never been the biggest football fan, but stuff like this makes me endlessly fascinated with the game. Good on you, Jon. May the scoragamis be plentiful.
I’m a simple man. I hear Jon Bois I click like.
I've heard the reason a forfeit us 2-0 is BECAUSE a safety is the only score not attributed to any one player, but rather, a team.
is there a current scoragami chart i can download? I have to do this now
I was at a high school game where a team went for the 2 point and fumbled and the defense got it to the opposite end zone, if the ball had been fumbled again it could have been amazing.
This deserves more views
Steelers vs Ravens 39-38 this past year
That "search YT using 'img ####'" is the best thing ever! With one number combination alone, I found videos of a beautiful dark brown horse in a deep green meadow, absolutely the cutest cream-colored kitten in the world, and an iso of someone opening a can of Chicken of the Sea tuna, all only seconds long. To maintain their highly pristine condition and keep these videos "wild", I did not like or unlike them, nor leave a comment. Amazing bits of digital ephemera.
I knew the Seahawks would be king at this
instead of being winner and loser for the two edges of the board, couldn't you extend the board by making it home and away? nearly doubles the board
You should do this with the CFL scores!
There was a scoragami in 2017 when the Texans beat the Titans 57-14.
Liking just because of the tip at the end
This is my favourite video on the internet so far

"That was sad.



Let’s keep it sad."
Your videos are always interesting. However, you very often make quite harsh judgments about sports fans of the past. It comes across as if you expect fans 100 years ago would have had the same sensibilities as modern people. This attitude in turn seems to make you take some things out of context. Sometimes you sound like a modern person making fun of cavemen for not driving cars. On top of that, it's all based on numbers and data crunching, which to me feels soulless. It's all very interesting though.
whats the song in the beginning?
I can't believe I actually watched this whole thing
Your probability calculation for the 4-4 game assumes all the events are completely independent, but that is probably not the case.  A team that scores a safety is probably much more likely than average to score another - perhaps the quarterback is sick or a guard is injured or a defensive coordinator as found a way to predict the play.  Still very unlikely though.
I'd LOVE to see scoragami for women's football! PAT's are a crapshoot, and the talent disparity can be VAST!
I did the IMG 4 numbers thing and I found a red haired girl in a church on a piano playing under the sea from disney's the little mermaid
Would a 6-1 game not be possible by the much more likely situation where team A scored a touchdown, then their PAT is blocked, taken back for one point?
I was made extremely uncomfortable by img 5148
What about that Doug Flutie dropkick ? That was 4 points wasn't it ?
Please like this comment comments that comment here are for the new 2018 nfl season scorigami
10-1 is mathematically impossible too, and others
More like this
Im so happy to have watched this. Im sure if you scorigami Division 1A Football you would fill out the whole chart
Long live Scoreagami!
A 4-4 tie can be 2-2 or 0-0 score at the end of regulation, and then both teams can can score 1 or 2 safeties in overtime to make a 4-4 tie.
As long as you could get 6-1 couldn’t you get 8-1 9-1 11-1 so on 10-1  if the rule is what he said it was
Nice vid 😁👌
Is the one point safety only in college?
1-0 is possible, but it's basically impossible
Now do it as percentages.  For example, if you score 0 points, you win 0% of the time, but if you score, 73 points, you win 100% of the time.  Ignoring ties of course.
You are talented!
Damn you little white boxes! Your lack of productivity has resulted in no one ever winning a squares pool with your numbers.
That 1 point on special teams was made in me on Madden once...
"Who are these people that go to 0 - 0 games in the pouring rain??" Ahem. Soccer fans.
Part 2 plzzzzz
can anyone do me a favor and let me know what software he used to make the animation? A lot of the 3D effect and transition looks really cool
What about 8-1
how is 7-1 possible? for one team to score just one point doesn't it require that the other team fail to convert the PAT?
Anyone know the name of the song he uses in the intro? That soft jazz track
"9:56

i hope you choke"
Unfortunately, the 41-33 super bowl was not scoragami. In 1954, there was another 41-33 game which the eagles won. The scariest part, the Browns were the 1954 champions later that year
I wonder if Super Bowl 52 was added to scoragami
There's been no 11-9 score dammit
that one point safety play has the smell of cleveland all over it
What if a field goal gets blocked into the teams who’s kicking’s field goal. I know it’s ridiculous but it is possible so what would be ruled?
So the only time we will get 6-1 is when a play like Louisiana Tech happens on a 2 point conversion
If you kick a fieldgoal in overtime. The other team turns the ball over. In the same play the losing team is able to score a safety. Who wins?
4 to 4.  So you're saying there is a chance.
The reason forfeits are two points is because when a team surrenders the other team is given a saftey because its the only score that isnt awarded to an specific player(s)
Wtf is the Washington NFL Team? That's really what they were called?
The rouge is the greatest rule in football!
My kink is using it to create pathetically regular scores. Missed extra point and two safeties vs 3 fg and 2pt con td. 10-17.
I heard that the NFL is thinking of changing the safety to account for 4 points instead of 2 since they're so rare
I did a defensive 2pt conversion in madden twice in a row
4 point field goal
I’m not a super huge football fan. But damn was this interesting. This makes me want to go watch some games of teams that I don’t even like
single point scores are possible thanks to the dropkick. Flutie attempted the last one
👍🏼
Wonder if this guy ever things … so?
Please please please update this every season!
a 1 point safety is possible, has happened in college, i don't know if it's in the NFL rule book
The best way for the 6-1 final score to happen is if a team scores a touchdown and then fumbles the 2 point conversion and the ball is picked up by the defense and taken all the way except the guy slows up at the end, and gets tackled and fumbles the ball with the kicking team recovering in the end zone for a 1 point safety
49ers jags 44-33 was the first time that score ever happened
So there was a game in 2017 between my outrageously ignored team, the Texans, and the outrageously overhyped Titans. The score was 57-14, which is a scorigami. This game is what the future will be for BOTH my Texans (with Deshaun Watson) and the Titans starting in 2018!!!
wouldn't 8-1 be more rare than 6-1
1 point is possible if a safety happens on the pat
10-1 I think is the most unlikely score, considering you need the extra point safety for 6-1, AND two safeties on top of that for the next 4 points
A 44-33 score from the Jags 49ers in 2017! Scorigami!
There was a Bucs-Lions game that was tied at 11 at the half in 2000 I believe. I remember that was the only time that happened.
Ever since I watched this for the first time, Scorigami is the only thing I care about
A 1 point game is possible
I feel like one day in the future, the 1 point safety will actually happen, but the team will pair it with other scores so it just looks like a normal score and doesn't achieve Scorigami, and Jon will just implode
This graph is unnecessarily complicated
NFC championship game stl 11 tb 6
Answer: Cleveland Browns.
a forfeit end in 2-0 because a safety is the only score that can be attributed to no specific player
What’s the first song
4:44 Imagine how tragic it would be if a 4-4 game went to overtime, and we think we'll see our second-ever 4-point score...only for the teams to go FG, FG, FG and finish with a perfectly mundane 10-7.  Or the first team with the ball gets a touchdown, resulting in another final of...10-4.  I think I'd cry.
49ers Beat the Jaguars 44-33 I’m pretty sure and that’s new
Fantastic!!
I think the methodology used for the odds of a 4-4 tie is somewhat flawed. Instead of using the overall odds of a team taking a safety in a game, you should’ve used the odds of a team taking a safety in a game in which they’re shut out on offense. A 4-4 tie would obviously mean that neither team scored any offensive points. That implies really bad offenses and high-quality defenses, which would seem to raise the probability of the teams taking safeties.
In the cfl you can win 1-9
Didn't realize the statistics behind the sport.
49ers jags finished 44-33 which is scoragami
10-1 would be the ultimate Scorigami. Two safeties, a touchdown, and a safety off the point after somehow, someway.
7 to 1 is possible isn't it, 7 from td with pat and 1 from 3 fg with a safety.
"15:40 ""Harbaugh was a noted Scorigami artist""

Literally 2 minutes before: ""Nobody tries to achieve Scorigami because it's a term I just made up in the making of this video"""
This is stupid.  You can get five points because Safety = 2 Points and Field Goal Attempt = 3.

"I can't believe I just witnessed one on my Christmas Eve, with Jaguars @ Niners ending up 33-44. Earlier in the season, I speculated on that comment section that a match like JAX-HOU could give us one, as they were the kind of atypical teams that could do it, but it ended up being with the Niners instead xD.

EDIT: Well, I just stumbled on the SBNation article about that Scorigami, and I saw that this one is the 8th of the season so I should cool off a little bit, that's not something that happens as rarely as I thought."

Jon's collection of discordant piano music has inspired me to amass such a collection.
It took me until like sixteen minutes in to realize that a scorigami was just a score that hadn't happened before. that made everything a lot simpler.
This is great work. Thank you for all of your considerable efforts on these videos.
Is there a way to add the dimension of commonality to these scores?
your suggestion did not disappoint. Img 5239 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7IQ1tElb5s
Wow just, wow
Did the Ravens & The Steelers make a scoragami last Sunday? Score was 39-38

Scoragami update?
"Here is a mathematical proof that the only impossible number of points a team can achieve is 1 (obviously ruling out that 1 point defensive safety):
Take any number n and divide by 7 to get a remainder of r, that is n=7m+r where m is an integer (which can be zero) and r is a number in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, there are thus seven cases to consider:
r=0) if n=7m then scoring m touchdowns gives you a score of n.
r=2) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and a safety give you a score of n.
r=3) if n=7m+3 then m touchdowns and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=4) if n=7m+4 then m touchdowns and two safeties give you a score of n.
r=5) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns, a safety and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=6) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and two field goals give you a score of n.
The tricky case is r=1. We must divide into two ""subcases"":
  n>+7) if n is greater than or equal to 7, then m must be greater than or equal to 1 (otherwise m=0 so that n=r=1<7 which is NOT the case). Thus n=7(m-1)+7+1=7(m-1)+8 so that (m-1) touchdowns and another touchdown with a 2-point conversion gives you the required score of n.
  n<7) if n is strictly less than 7, then m must be zero (otherwise n=7m+r>7 which is not the case), therefore n=7(0)+1=1, the impossible score!
Conclusion: for every number n>1, there is a way to achieve that score in football by conventional means (given sufficient time obviously); the only score that cannot be achieved in an ordinary manner is n=1."

IMG | MVI | MOV | DSC | HDV"
I’d be curious to see this for college football
This is retardedly awesome
Why make things difficult by diluting the equation with keeping regulation and overtime scoring separate? Also, "games in which the offense was shut out" is the incorrect variable as it doesn't factor in defensive scoring. In my opinion, the equation for the probability of a game ending in a 4-4 tie should look something like this:  "Odds of a team scoring 2 safeties in a game" x "Odds of a team not scoring any points other than those gained from safeties in any game", then multiply that by itself to get your value for both teams doing it in the same game. All variables should include all regulation and overtime scoring combined rather than splitting it up, it seems much easier that way as it's removing an unnecessary variable and calculation from the equation.
November 19 2017 produced two scorigami. NE 33 Oak 8 & LAC 54 Buf 24.
A single point can be very easily scored in Canadian Football. :D Also baseball and the rest of the world (soccer) disagree about low scoring sports. Finally, I believe the 2 point drop kick is still on the books... so there is that.
If the eagles kicked the extra point, it would've been scorigami.
17:32 that game wasn’t played at the Seahawks stadium
4:45 You can't have a tie in a playoff game man... it would be 256 games rather than 267 because the 11 playoff games can't end in a tie of any score. This is the only part of the video that really bothers me.
"I have to clarify the 6-1 possibility you detailed. It would have been a touchback how you described it. After the defensive team fumbled the interception into the end zone, the recovering player would have needed to attempt to advance the ball or have intentionally retreated into the endzone and then downed/tackled for it to be counted as a safety. Simply fumbling into the end zone and an offensive recovery is not a safety due to the change of possession. 

I'm a stickler for the rules. Especially NFL rules. Thus, I hate Dean Blandino.

Great video though."
So what's the  music used when talking about the Dark scoragami? It's come up in a bunch of videos but I don't know what it is
In the end I thought of Jim Marshall (guy who ran the opposite direction to score an offensive safety for the other team)
But how are the other x - 1 scores possible?? 8-1, 9-1, 13-1 and so on? are they all based on the same 6-1 process?
I'm getting a 1 point safety in Madden, hold my beer
"Why 2-0?

I don’t know."
Anyone know the music that starts at 9:58?
lol pick 2 just a few days after he made this.
A scorigami board should be published and updated every time a new one happens.
In the calculation for a 4-4 game you included playoffs. But playoffs games can't tie. So the it should happen every 1,839,795,140 years.
This guy doesn’t earn enough
0:00 its called the 1 point safety
The defensive 2 pt conversion isn't super rare in college.  It happened to Notre Dame at least twice in 2016.
How many Scoragamis have we had in 2017 so far?
I'm extremely disappointed because he said "8 is a weird number" right at 7:59
Shout out to Jimmy Grapes and the 49ers for putting a slot on 15 (15 - 14 vs Bears)
Fun fact: I got an entirely natural 1-point safety in a game of Madden. I'm assuming it was a glitch. Link to a clip will come if anyone wants it/cares
Is this man using prezi
i dont know how you got that much time and mathematical knowledge to do all this. but you surely grab my attention every single time, even though my math is bad and my footbaal knowledge is kinda mediocre =D goof freaking job sir! @SB Nation
Scorigami 33 8
2 to 1 is possible
1 point safety?
Can someone tell me the the name of that last song
Woah he said it’s nov 30th and today is November 30th 2017
"Still lots of scorigami left in rugby league. All of the usual scoring methods are even numbers. A try (the equivalent of a touchdown) is 4, or 6 with a conversion, and a penalty goal is 2. A field goal is worth 1, and it's usually only used to break a tie, or to gain a lead of 7 (or 13, etc.)
I remember one game where one guy thought a conversion missed when it was actually good, and kicked a field goal, thinking it was for the win, and his team lost by one, I think 20-19. One-point margins where the winning team scores an even number are super rare. It could also happen by scoring a field goal to take a one point lead, followed by conceding a penalty to lose by one, but it hardly ever happens."
"I think that the best bet for a 1 point safety would be this:

1 point kick is blocked. Defense scoops and up and runs 97.9 yards. Offense is fast on their tail. To make it in they have to dive. They fumble on the dive before crossing the goal. The ball squirts out the back of the end zone. 

Boom. Defensive safety."
That 40-39 score is the most stereotypically Browns thing I've ever heard.
I only watch your videos for the background music
Grandparental permission XD!!!
Isn't a forfeit scored 1-0?
There can be a 6-1 game easily in Canadian football because the rouge rule which means a touchback and a missed field goal that goes through the end zone is 1 point.
Strangely enough a long time ago playing in the yard with friends and  we somehow had a 1 point safety on a long scramble gone wrong resulting in a 20-33 score.
They should have said what the chance of a 6-1 score is
1 point safety
I think a lineman catches the kick and laterals it to a speedy guy and there 1 point touchdown
What about a 1 point safety
That IMG #### thing actually works! I randomly vote this random fact of the day
Would the 6-1 game be possible if a punter punted the ball backwards into his own end zone and that team falls on it?
This is honestly one of the best YouTube videos I've ever watched
There’s actually a 1 point safety it’s during an extra point and has only happened three times
Fun fact: if you block a PAT and take it all the way, you get 2 points. What happens if you fumble the ball, the other team dives on it in the end zone, and you down him. Is that another case of the 1-pt safety?
I wish I could give more than 1 thumbs up.
1 point safeties only exist in minor leagues
19:05 yes. Yes it can. Player A doesn't stop running, and Player B gets cocky. They celebrate. Player A strips the ball away. Somehow, the ball bounces in a way that keeps it in the end zone. Player A jumps on it, and Player B downs him in the end zone. There's also Player B mishandling the ball, Player A maintaining possession and somehow losing it out of bounds, and the 2008 Detroit Lions :)
There are 1 point plays though they are rare

I love low scoring games! As long as it’s the result of tenacious defense, and not trash offense. Those games are intense!
“That was sad. Let’s keep it sad.” 😂

"""i like offense""
nice opinion, pleb"
When he says "That was sad, let's keep it sad."
what about drop kicks?
What happens if you have a PAT caught by the defense (either missed kick or two point PAT),  and then the defensive player carries it back, but opts for the drop goal instead of the touchdown? Obviously only Drew Brees would try this, but still

*Forgets about 2 point conversions
About the potential 6-1 score, I feel that a fumble recovered in the end zone would be counted as a touchback rather than a safety, so you would have to recover at the 1 yard line and then be tackeled into the end zone.
I love the way football has its scores.  It makes the game very interesting!
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW_lcUYMasE

the img i searched up"
"1:07

Looks like bowling scores"
I had to turn away after 8:45 (as per Jon's request) what did I miss
That damn Bears vs steelers game I thought I was gonna see a 1 point safety
Team A scores a touchdown, gives up a 1-pt safety. Then team B does the same. It's 7-7. I think that's the worst thing that could ever happen in a football game.
Steelers and bears almost did get the 1 point conversion
If Mississippi St. vs Louisiana Tech proved anything with that 80 yard fumble, it's that the 1 point safety could be possible!!!
There needs to be a website that’s constantly updated
you could also catch an extra point and return it lol
Hey Jon, in your example at the beginning of a 14-14 tie you drew the vertical line crooked and put the X in the wrong place
theres actually something called a 1 point safety
Actually, 6-1 can also happen if the defending team on a PAT attempt scores a dropkick goal. Since there hasn't been a dropkick-attempt in the NFL pretty much since the dawn of time, Idk if its more likely than a offensive safety, but hey, double the options right?
"No 9-9 games,  interesting. 

And no 46-0 or 50-0. USC beat UCLA 50-0 in 2011, and beat Colorado 50-6 in 2012."
There was a college game this year where the players kept kicking the ball from one goal line to the other and it ended up as like a 3rd and 92. If that happened on an extra point it would be 1 pt
I bet I’ve reached almost all of these on madden because I always go for 2 but rarely make it 😂
wait... how can basketball make 5pt play?
Here let me help you out with this scorigami thing: watch high school football
“Washington NFL Team”
REDSKINS! THE TEAM IS CALLED THE REDSKINS!
9:00 He's using 7 point bars instead of 6 point bars.
Why can't a game end 7-1? https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/sports/football/a-1-point-score-in-the-nfl-now-its-possible.html?referer=http://www.google.ca/
Jon Bois Spotify playlist
If someone pulls a fumble like the Miss St vs La Tech one that happened this year on an extra point, 6-1 might happen
Hi
The Chicago Bears fans that enjoyed the scoreless ties must have been soccer fans.
No wonder why sentient space crafts like football.... This crap is crazy.
"Isn't 10-1 a harder score?
That would require that 6-1 bullshit
Plus
2 safeties"
Your 6-1 example isn't even correct. That would just be a touchback. Team A would have to recover that fumble, run it out of their own end zone, and then run back in their end zone and be tackled. I am disappointed you got it wrong after all of that waiting you made us do. Sad stuff.
Awesome video :)
Madden is about to get broken 😈
there is a loophole to win a game with less points then the other team
6:28 *Washington Redskins
You forgot all about the 1 point safety
ever heard of the drop kick? look it up. doug flutie 2007
1 to 0 can happen because of a one point safety
"I just looked into this, and I found that Belichick is also 7-0 in Scorigami with the Patriots (yes, I know Carroll is 8-0 now), but according to Pro Football Reference, Belichick has won these 7:

2004 vs. Rams (40-22)
2004 vs. Browns (42-15)
2012 vs. Colts (59-24)
2012 vs. Jets (49-19)
2013 vs. Steelers (55-31)
2014 vs. Colts (43-22) (playoffs)
2016 vs. Bills (41-25)"
Who else remembers Rams vs. Bucs in the 99 playoffs? 6 to 5 at the half. Ended 11 to 6.
I think 8-1 would be far less like ly
The 1 point safety nearly happened in the Steelers Bears game just a few weeks ago.  Blocked extra point, run back for almost touchdown, Marcus Cooper had it punched out and into his own endzone.  Very nearly happened.
How about college football?
"We're not quite at the halfway point of the 2017 season, but we've already matched last season's total of five Scorigami games.

Week 1: Rams 46, Colts 9
Week 3: Rams 41, 49ers 39
Week 4: Texans 57, Titans 14
Week 4: Seahawks 46, Colts 18
Week 6: Saints 52, Lions 38

Some takeaways from these games:
• In all five games, the winning team scored more than 40 points. By comparison, the league-wide scoring average is just shy of 22 PPG.
• The Rams and Colts have already been involved in two of these games. LA won both, while Indianapolis lost both — allowing exactly 46 points in each.
• By recording only the seventh 57-point score in NFL history, the Texans broke their single-game scoring record by double digits in their Scorigami. Houston's previous high was achieved in Week 13 of the 2014 season, in a 45-21 victory against... the Titans.
• Pete Carroll continues his statistically-unlikely sorcery (scorecery?), notching his eighth consecutive season with a Scorigami win. At this point he has to be doing it intentionally."
The reason why a forfeit is 2-0 is because the safety is the only way of scoring points that isn't attributed to a single player.
Why can't 7-1 happen?
Fun video! Have you considered that some of these events may not be independent? For example, in the 4-4 situation, a low scoring offense and opposing safeties have an association with another, so multiplying those probabilities may not accurately estimate the overall probability of the event occurring?
I can't watch an NFL game anymore without thinking of this video.
We need more vids😭😭😭😭
18-9 in minnesota right now
To add to the unlikelihood of a 6-1 game, why on earth would a team go for 2 if they're 6-0 up?

About the only interesting thing about the 2nd half of tonight's Colts-Seahawks game: "Okay Seattle, you gotta score a touchdown, not a field goal here, 'cause 42-18 has happened before." First 46-18 score confirmed!!!! Pete Carroll, you've done it again.
SCORIGAMI RED ALERT:currently Colts 18 Seahawks 25 in late 3rd quarter
The defensive 1 point safety can also happen if the team going for the conversion turns around and runs all the way to the back of the other inzone, you can see for yourself in Madden

Steelers vs Bears game on Sept 24th, 2017 almost did that. Cooper blocked the kick, returned it to just outside the goal line, then the Steeler knocked it out of his hands and came damn close to falling on it in the endzone. Ended up knocking it out kind of. Weird play in an of itself which took far to long. Long and short of it is that the Bears got it on their 2 yard line. Not a 6-1 score mind you, but a 1 point safety could have happened.
This may be the best video on YouTube
Time to move the PAT spot to in line with where the TD was scored, like in rugby?
Although the 6-1 score is nearly impossible, a similar event compared to the explanation of scoring just one point happened between Mississippi state and Louisiana Tech on September 9, 2017. LT was 2nd and goal from the opponents 6 yard line, and the ball got snapped over the head of the quarterback. MS players kept trying to pick the ball up, and ended up pushing the ball backwards even further until a LT player fell on the ball at their own 7 yard line. LT was 3rd and goal, 3rd and 93, from their own 7 yard line. They lost 86 yards on one play. So although it would be hard to score just one point for a team, the event just described shows that it is possible.
This is the best sports vid on YouTube highly underrated
"14:35 the one chance for the browns to win- they blew it 
Sounds like something the bills would do 😰"
You can get 1 point off of a one point safety right
Rams made history. The first team to ever get 2 scorigamis in 3 games
"I stopped the video when the chart at 6:26 referred to ""Washington NFL team"".

Lame."
This sounds like an 80's movie to me. Especially the end. I love this content.
It just happened again! For the first time in over a year!!!
Interesting fact: no team has ever scored 50 points and not won
Scorigami this weekend! 41-39!
Craziest scoragami I've ever seen was in a college football game that ended 6-4. Penn State v Iowa 2004.
18:23 - It wasn't a safety and it was on a field goal instead of a point-after, but the Bears today basically did the closest thing we've ever seen to what you described here.

41-39 SCORIGAMI!
17:33 Need an update 41-39
There was that LSU game where they were 3rd and goal from their own 7. Something like that could definitely happen on a 2 pt attempt.
I would love an update video.
Happened last night. 49ers and Rams scored 41-39, a new score that’s never happened.
Why doesn't he count the APFA the first version of the NFL 1920 -1921 because 66-0 has happened why ??????????
A 6-1 score is possible but the example of the safety following the conversion return is not correct. If Team A fumbles the ball into the end zone and Team B recovers in the end zone, it's a touchback, not a safety. In order for a safety to be scored, the actions of Team B would have to cause the ball to go into the end zone. This could happen either by the person who recovered it running into the end zone or by a player from Team B batting it into the end zone during a recovery attempt.

Could you do this Kind of Video about Rugby Union?
Seahawks did one in their 14-5 loss last season.
I did some rexearch in Finland, and a finnish maple league (top level) game has ended once with one team scoring four points.
I would like to see the chart with a third height dimension to show frequency. Somebody make it happen.
That last example wouldn't even be a safety. The A player would need to advance the ball back out of the end zone, then either run back in or fumble it back into his defensive end zone, where it would have to either go out the back or side of the end zone or be recovered in the end zone by team A
I remember watching the first ever 11-10 game I think it was Chargers vs Steelers
I was more impressed with your graphics than the information itself.
Mind blown... also go hawks
The fact that Marshawn Lynch caused an earthquake...
Except the drop kick exists so it is possible to score one point
I hate these so much. Not Because they are bad, or because of the creator, but because there are so few! The way you put these Chart partys and Pretty Goods together always has be super excited to watch.
This honestly blew my mind

https://twitter.com/nfl_scorigami"
We need updates every season on whether there were any scorigamis. I know that this year, there was a 46-9 scorigami in week 1 and a 30-2 in the preseason, though that does not count.
I love how there was a game-winning defensive two-point conversion return just a few days after he made this video. It's perfect.
I actually like low scoring games because I prefer defensive battles, tough thing about that is being a Packer fan
Not aware of the "new" conversion rules?
Eric berry got a defensive 2 point conversion in 2016 against the falcons
1 point safety's
I'm sure there are lots of lower level scorigami scores, but maybe this is rare; I played in an 18-4 game. They scored 3 TDs, attempted 2 point conversions on each, the same player on our team intercepted & ran back 2 of them. (Game played on a 70 yard field on a hill. Not high quality. Match report; http://sabres.union.shef.ac.uk/club/history/0506-season/ )
"That was sad now let's keep it sad"-john bois 😂😂😂
Last week, Louisiana Tech came just seven yards away from the sequence of events required to give up a 1-point safety (although this occurred during regular play and not on a conversion attempt).
Would 12 to 74 be scoragami? #Maddenlogic
Extra point intercepted
This guy must have been really really really really really bored
SB Nation what software did you use to make the graphics?? It looks great! Also, nice vid btw!
Lol I went 98 yards the other way for a safety on madden one time that's how I knew the rule
15:09 technically they are combinations but awesome video though. I never knew I wanted anything as much as a 6-1 score.
The six to one could happen though...look up Louisiana Tech' 3rd and 93
Someone make 6-1 happen on madden and upload!
In singing high school they blocked a 1 pat and they returned it best moment ever
1-0 is absolutely possible, you get 1 point for a "Drop Kick", Doug Flutie Pulled it off in 2006 for New England as the extra point after a touchdown but this can be done outside of extra points.  Nobody in their right mind would do this instead of a field goal but it is possible.
"Though the probability of a team scoring exactly one point in a game is astronomically remote, it must be noted that in today's NFL, with the extra point located at the 15-yard line instead of the 2-yard line, the kicking team would have to lose 85 yards on an extra point attempt for the 1-point safety to register as a score for the other team. While ""Scorigami"" correctly proclaims the play to be nearly impossible, it is not entirely inconceivable. 

Despite the extremely low probability of a team losing 85 yards on a play, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Louisiana Tech lost 87 yards on a single play against Mississippi State this year (2017). The play did not result in a safety, but it certainly could have if the line of scrimmage was further back than where it was (the Mississippi State 6-yard line; 2nd and goal). The ball was recovered by the Louisiana Tech offense at their own 7-yard line. Remember that the line of scrimmage on an NFL extra point is nine yards further back than it was for the aforementioned play. If an NFL team were to lose 87 yards on an extra point attempt, they would have to recover the fumble two yards into their own end zone.

Further, the chances of losing 87 yards on a field goal (or extra point play) is more likely than losing that much yardage on an offensive play with the quarterback in the shotgun. When the Arizona Cardinals gave up a touchdown to the Buffalo Bills last year (2016), the snap traveled 26 yards behind the line of scrimmage before it was touched. This is more than the 21 yards lost by Louisiana Tech before the ball was touched, only increasing the likelihood of the defensive 1-point safety.

In conclusion, the one-point safety is not at all inconceivable. If a bad snap on an extra point kick attempt, followed by an egregious number of fielding errors strikingly similar to the former play mentioned above were to occur, we just might witness the first defensive 1-point safety in football history. But even if this cosmically rare event were to occur, the 1-point total score by a team could only exist if their opponents were able to hold them scoreless for the remainder of the game."
There's a 1 point safety on field goal attempts that are easier to get, look it up
There is something called a 1 point safety. For a example, If Justin Tucker were to have a kick blocked and Ray Lewis (opposite sides..) catches it. IF Ray were to run out and was tackled back inside the end zone, its a 1 point safety..
What if u block the extra point and take it to the house
1 point is possible
This would make football squares so much easier to bet on knowing which squares have the best chance of happening.
Sloppy probability calculations, but I guess you were just going for 'approximate' answers. But things like 'what is the probability that there are 2 safeties by each team AND each team is shut out offensively' will not just be the product, because those are not independent events.
Super Bowl 24 was Scorigami 49ers 55 Broncos 10
That was awesoem
You can technically score intimate amount of times if the kicking team (on kickoff) recovers the ball and scores it's a touchdown with no time of the clock it happens to the bills in 2016
1-0 is possible.  If a really rare thing happens in college football (yes this is nfl but it can most likely still happen) a 1 point safety will be on the board.
Would 6-1 be possible with a drop kick by recovering team on a conversion attempt after a blocked PAT, fumble, etc.?
Someone needs to try and make a 6-1 game on madden
"Colts vs Rams Week 1 2017
New Scorigami: 46-9"
"You should post the chart on twitter or something so we can see if any current NFL games are new scoragami
EDIT: After looking at week 1 scores, the Rams-Colts game filled the 46-9 scoragami"
For anyone curious, Jon Bois is NOT counting preseason as part of the Scorigami chart. He said this on his Twitter on August 31.
rams 46-9 colts....scorigami
Imagine the blood vessels this guy would pop if a play to make a game 6-1 happens then the losing team kicks a field goal to make it a more common 6-3 game
Pretty close to a scorigami with the 29-19 Vikings vs Saints game. 29-12 (no Drew Brees TD pass in the final few minutes) or 32-12 (Vikings want to get a scorigami, so they kick a field goal at the end of the game instead of taking a knee) would have been scorigami.
does this count preseason?
Colts 9 X 46 Rams in wk1 is a scorigami!
Another hole is filled on the board. 46-9
You're 6-1 game may be easier to obtain than you think. A rule change in the last few years (I'm not sure if it was before or after this video) makes it so that if a PAT is run back by the defense, it only counts as 1 rather than 6.
The 4-4 odds tho
Newest scorigami today (9/10/17): Rams vs. Colts, 46-9!
There are now 1 point safeties in the NFL and NCAA
Just ask Louisiana Tech about losing lots of yardage on long fumbles.
I like your articles Jon, do you still do breaking madden?
Running an extra point kick back for two happened like two or three times last season!
Mind blowing vid 💥
4000-3000 is possible the kicking team just has to grab the ball in the end zone for a touchdown over and over again because the clock doesn't stop
The editing is amazing great job!!
You should do literally the highest score possible. So let's say there is a 10-yard kickoff and the other team tries to return it as fast as possible. Let's say  like the fastest kickoff return possible is 8 seconds. Then, if u can go for two in 2 seconds, there would be eight points every 10 seconds. That's 720 points a quarter; 2480 in a game.
Look up, 1 point safety.
Also the fact no one would go for two on their first score when they're up
"Ehhm, what about the one-point safety? 
edit: jumped the gun when he showed the Lego's."
pleaaaase do this with college football. this is such a good video but i'd love to see how crazy the scores get with the massive amount of games
"The whole time I was watching this I wanted to see this chart as a heat map.
So I made one: https://goo.gl/XGuPtF
Red = only happened once
Yellow to green = less frequent to most frequent

Top 5 most frequent scores are wins by 3"
I thought 28-24 was very common
Can I please get a scoragami sheet that I can fill out while playing football like Bingo?
What about the bengals browns 2004 58-48 game or the 2007 bengals browns (again) 51-41 game? Those were very interesting scoragamis. The bengals won both. The browns know how to loose.
why won't he say Washington's full name?
"I don't like it when people praise Pete Carroll.




But that's just because I'm a 49ers fan :)"
if preseason counts Broncos just beat the Cardinals 30-2 so that would be scorigami
Does this include preseason? Idk if he mentioned it.
This is the best video on the internet
I NEED THIS MUSIC
Instead of Winning team-column, Losing team-row, why don't you do Home team-column, Away team-row? Then you have the full board at your disposal instead of just half of the board.
6 to 1 explanation at at 18.25
What about a game that is 2-2 at the end of regulation, and 4-4 after overtime?
gawd, you must have been sh%ttin' lego bricks during SBLI
"Gets a 6-1 score...






Ends up 21-20"
You can get a  1 point safety  look it up  I think Texas  A&M  did it
When you mentioned NYG vs. WSH was the highest scoring game, what about GB vs ARI?
Amazing  video
The song is Flying Dragon by Dieter Reith in case you don't know.
Isn't 8-1, 9-1 10-1 etc also impossible?
You should sell scoragami boards
A score of 1-0 is possible. Conversion safety
your graphic at 9:20 has a 7 block and a 2 instead of a 6 and a 2
your math is off. the likelihood of scoring a second safety is dependent on how safety prone an opponent is.
Is 6-1 capable in Madden??
football is great
Do you think Ten and Juice ever saw a 4-4 game?
um there is other sports where scorigami could be a thing
The music and editing are off the charts! This is so enjoyable to watch
Why did you call them, "Washing nfl team."
Jon's scenario at the end for the 1-point safety is actually incomplete and the real thing would be even less probable. A safety is only possible if the team has possession of the ball. However, if the defense intercepts the ball on the two point conversion, they would officially have possession. So if the ball was fumbled in the endzone by the defense and recovered by the offense, it would only be a touchback, resulting in no score. In order for the 1-point safety to happen, the defense would have to get possession of the ball (e.g. interception), lose the ball in their endzone (98 yards away), have the offense pick up the ball (thereby regaining possession for the offense), carry the ball OUT of the defense's endzone, and then somehow get tackled back into the defense's endzone. For all intents and purposes, it's basically not possible.
You can score 1 point in the NFL if a field goal is blocked and then recovered in the end zone by the team who blocked it you get a 1 point safety ik crazy right
"""No team has even come close to a 73-0 win...""

2009, week 6. Patriots beat the Titans 59-0.

Probably would've been worse since it was 45-0 at HALFTIME. 45-0 AT HALFTIME!
Pretty damn close if you ask me."
This is just one really long shower thought
Never seen your channel before but this video was incredibly interesting
I'm watching this at night and the rare rules terrified me
wew boi
Now I wanna see a 1-0 game
Great video, learned so much! Thanks! How about 100 likes for no reason
Every work of Jon Bois' I've ever seen has given me a weird surrealist feeling while simultaneously assuring me of my place in the universe.
Note that Team A would also have to bring the ball out of the end zone and then go back in for it to be a safety; otherwise it's just a touchback.
You spelled Redskins wrong.
This was in my recommended, and it was incredibly interesting! Earned yourself a sub my good sir.
There can be a 6-2 game with no safeties!
And I thought I had no life researching NFL history...this is next level, bro.
Welp, a game just happened between the Bucs and Jags then ended with a score of 12-8. Is that scorigami for you?
Another banger
Is the one point safety only a rule in college?
In Seattle there's a good chance in Seattle your eardrum could be ruptured as Seattle fans have gotten so loud they've been just 12 decibels away from rupturing eardrums.
I love how the Dark Scorigami segment was genuinely unsettling to watch. Or maybe it was just because I watched this at midnight with the lights out. I'll give Jon the benefit of the doubt.
What if you had a computer simulate future NFL seasons based on historical probability taken from previous seasons, kinda like how Jon did in this video? Would we get some crazy fractal-esque patterns at the end?
This the best video I've seen on YouTube this year... And I watch a shitload of YouTube.
Wait, isn't a blocked PAT returned worth 1?
Rugby Union scorigami
Except a safety on PAT is a one point play
With the new PAT rules, idk about a 6-1 game, but I think a team scoring 1 point is very possible. We've seen it happen before on INT returns, albeit rarely.
Seahawks!!
i tripped balls this entire video,
I won a 10-1 game of Madden 07 with a friend, so I guess I'm pretty much a scoragami expert
Are there any other videos similar to this one, or about scoragami? I want more lol
i want to see an 11-4 final score before i die
What's a 5 point game in basketball?
The Eagles had a scorigami of 54 to 11 vs The Bears.
I don't even like football but this video is amazing
Please someone make a Scorigami board on Google Docs or whatever, so we can follow it this season!
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball
this should be a tv show
What's wrong with low scoring games? I love defense.
Scoragai as you put it could also work in rugby Because in that you have 2 ways to get 3 points and one way to get 5 and one way to get seven so it doesnt work in order of magnitude like most other sports
Even in 17776, there's probably never been a 4-4 game. lol
why did you put on that annoying noise around 9:30 ? shits horrible
Straight facts
5 zero-zero games?! The NFL used to be FIFA.
There is some cases where there is a 1 point safety so there could be a score with 1 in it
what am I doing with my life why am I not watching these videos
this makes me want to start a game with multiple ways to score different amounts of points, and the goal isn't to score the most points, but to get the closest to a certain number.
What happens in the NFL if a blocked FG is brought back to the EZ and is downed by the defense?
I'm surprised that 4 was in a score before 5!
I got scorigami in Madden 25! It was 25-9. The AI scored a TD with a missed 2-pt conv., and kicked a field goal. I got a two 7-point TDs. a safety, and three field goals. (EDIT: Let me put the scoring in order: Me: 7-point TD AI: FG Me: 7-point TD AI: 6-point TD Me: FG Me: FG Me: Safety Me: FG)
Me and a bud once played Madden with 15:00 minute quarters, I threw like 14 pics, still won the game like 200 to 150. The announcer called the final score as "a bunch to a bunch."
The 6-1 play happened,Texas vs. Texas A&M
8:55 it's 2-0 because no single player gets credit for a safety
How would you get a 5 point play in basketball
Greatest video ever?
There's a 1 point safety
Wouldn't a 6-1 score block also occur if after team A scores a touchdown they kick it through team Bs goal?
All these chat party videos are so good. Very interesting
18:50 Wouldn't that be a touchback and therefore unsuccessful try? For team A to give the impetus to put the ball in its own end zone it has to get the ball in the field of play and carry it into the end zone, or bat or kick the ball into the end zone. If team B fumbles the ball into the end zone, the imputus is on team B.
Under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks have had a scorigami each year, and even better won all seven
This dude is a G.O.A.T😂😂😂😂
I wish that Jon made more videos
That was pretty good
Where's the jazz music from?
AYY K-STATE
Jon Bois is a gift to this Earth
Wait am I totally wrong, or can't you make a 6-1 win also by returning a blocked PAT?
Just a reminder to any uppity Seattle fans that KC took the noise record back the next game.
Did the image search with a random number thing... first try, see a turkey fight, seems about right...yeah, let's not do that again.
Jon Bois is a national treasure.
the word scorigami got funnier the more you said it
What's the music at 5:29 please?
Before starting as a Seahawks fan I know SB 48's 43-8 is the only time that score has happened.
One time in the 1970s, the Rams scored two safeties in a game. The same player, Fred Dryer or Drier, made the scoring tackles.
You're stupid! How could you forget the most obvious 6-1 situation of a defensive interception on a PAT attempt, in which the defense decides not to run it into the endzone, but instead do a 1 point drop kick. Maybe watch a football game sometime. You should know that.
Would a 6-1 game also be possible if, on the extra point attempt, the defense runs the ball down the field and drop kicks the ball through the uprights?
That was sad. Let's keep it sad. 😂
do this with the nba
1-0 is possible in the cfl
a forfeit is 2-0 because a safety is the only score not attributes to any player
my favorite SB nation video by far
5:28 I don't understand people who waste their time making a 20 minute video about NFL scoring statistics
This was insanely interesting
What's the creepy music sound from?  Sounds like a Silent Hill scene.
I still love all these videos. And also the fact you can see the mouse move across the window at the very last second.
Look at the rock island independents of pre NFL pro football they only played 4 games in 1908 and had 2 scoragamis till this day, 4-0 and 8-2 Jon I'd love to see you make a scoragami board that includes all pro games from 1890s on
Will there ever be an 8-1 game?
This video deserves my like. Great job!
Hop up, how is the numbers past seven to one possible?
So is 13-1 possible?
Guess this was made before the Bucs beat the Hawks 11-5
Personally, I think your "odds" of a 4-4 game are wrong.  After doing my own seperate calculations, I've determined that the true odds are: once in 471,078,670,372 games, not once in every 470,897,555,931 games.
6-1... challenge accepted
Chart Party! Woot, Woot!
There was a 58 - 0 game john, you didn't mark it on the chart
What did you use to make the chart?
can i print this out?
Two teams in the preseason need to make a 6-1 game
At 5:27 when Jon says "Who are these people?" I decided to look up Lon Warneke and he was a pretty good pitcher in his day! He had a 192-121 W-L record and played in 5 all star games
Why couldn't 6-1 just happen like in the college game?
Canadians what is a rouge in the CFL?
does anyone know what is used to edit this - wanted to use it for a class
5points is impossible in basketball?
THIS HAS TO BE THE DUMBEST ISH LOL
18:14 - For those not familiar with the "rouge" of the Canadian Football League, that's one of the big differences between the leagues; another is that there are no touchbacks in the CFL.  If the ball is kicked into the opponents' end zone, it must be returned.  If they can't get it out of there, the kicking team gets that single point, or "rouge".
I imagine BB might in a situation where he scored a TD on the final play... he would probably say kneel. or Put the fastest guy there  and tell him run out the back of your own endzone. just because he likes to have fun sometimes.
I like this but at 7:03 there is no 5 point plays in basketball
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do Scoragami for College Football. PLEASE
Why are you afraid of the team name "Redskins"?
This is amaxing
This was the dumbest video I've ever seen
Is your name pronounced "boy" or "bwah" Because of your name sounds like Jon Boy that's awesome 😂
The One Point Safety has happened twice in the history of College Football I believe.
Jon Bois is that you? upload more on your main channel
im too high for this video
No offense but a blocked xp returned for a touchdown is a one point score it has happened
I dont particularly like football but that was insane
This was the most interesting thing i have seen in a while. 😂😂😂😂
"9:08 thats a 7-block you used there

oh so is 9:47"
Damn. One of the best videos I've ever watched
What NFL game occured when the losing team scored 8 points? I wonder.......
this was actually pretty good
But what is the odds of the inventor of scorigami saying "scorigami" more than anyone has ever said "scorigami" before? Hmmm? Is THAT a scorigami?
Where can I find the music that plays in the Chart Party videos?
such a cool video
I have a question about that 1-pointer. If it's fumbled, recovered by the other team while in the endzone, and then he's tackled, why wouldn't that just be the equivalent of a touchback? In other words, in order to give up a point, wouldn't he first have to venture out of the endzone and then step back in and be tackled?
Lol did I really watch this whole thing just to find out how a score of 6-1 is possible...
You also see far more safeties in the CFL.  If a team's set to punt out of their own end zone, chances are they'll just take the safety.  For a variety of reasons (longer field, shorter series,  uprights on the goal line), field position is very important.  It's often worth giving up two points to push the opponent back 20-ish yards.
if you fall on the opposite teams fumble in the end zone it's a touch back
I knew 6-1 Since I did it in Madden
I thought this video was going to show every NFL score that has ever happened...
When was the 11-10 score?
Genius...
can't believe I watched this :)
what did i just watch
"Have to point out two mistakes.
1) Any high score is possible both technically and physically because on a kickoff time doesn't start until someone touches the ball. So if you kick it into your opponents' end zone and recover it there, you score a touchdown without wasting a moment of playing time. And PATs, of course, are untimed.
2) For it to be a safety, you have to carry the ball into the end zone yourself. If your opponent fumbles forward and into the end zone and you just fall on the ball, you are awarded a touchback."
pete
need moar
What's the song?
Washington Redskins. Washington Redskins. It's the Washington REDSKINS.
Hey im new to this channel and ive Gotta say, your channel is awesome
can somebody tell me what program was used to create this video with 3d animations and all that? It's like a virtual world
that is one way to get 6-1 but if team A got a touchdown and team a's kicker missed the extra point off the goal post or for whatever reason it was short... a player from team b could catch the ball in the air and run it back to his own endzone resulting in 6-1

Now this is what I call hard work. Congrats, dude.
This seems like something i would do at 2 am
your statistical analysis seems lacking. use conditional probability. for instance, a scoreless overtime is much more likely to occur in a game between two teams with poor offenses than in a game between teams qith average offense. you essentially double count the poor offense. a 4-4 is probably 100 - 1000 times more likely than you state here.
the 1 point play hooked me but the video was good enough to keep me watching regardless.
19:09 isn't that a touchback?
I got a 1 point safety in madden before. So, the dude went for 2 and I intercepted it ran back to like the 2 yard line, fumbled, the other team recovered and I tackled him in the end zone
this video was amazing
this is exactly what I needed to watch to distract myself from my physics homework #procrastination
I'm from Canada and I've won a high school game 2-1
I feel like I am watching a conspiracy theory
Very enjoyable!
what has my life come to
Wasn't there a defensive 2 pt conversion this past season?
Why do I love watching this?
i dont know about exact math, but i think he messed up the math about a 4 to 4 game. he added that the other team has to be shut out, but they arent shutting them out. it should be probability of a 4 point score time 4 point score times scoreless overtime. otherwise cool video

The score can also end 6-1 if the offense goes for 2, the defense somehow gets the ball, and just before the defensive player crosses the goal line they drop kick it through their up right. This is another fairly new rule. (new being added in the 60s i believe)
Blocked extra point offense picks it up in end zone? 6-1
all scores above 11 are possible with only 7 points for a touchdown and 3 points for field goal
so doesn't that mean 13-1 and 20-1 and so forth could be possible?
One of the most interesting Youtube videos ever. Loved it. Thanks :)
music at the end gave it away...scorigami? more like illuminati!!
Go hawks!
This is my favorite video ever
Let's say team A gets a TD, then they go for the field goal. It's blocked, then ends up in the hands of team B, who runs it all the way back. Would that result in 6-1 game??
This has got to be the best football video on the internet
I did the defensive 2 pt conversion on madden mobile but it gave me no points?
Scorigami can also work for rugby but admittedly not as well as football
Wow this is very interesting!
1-Mar
What if a 2pt conversion gets intercepted and instead of running it back into the endzone you kick a fieldgoal..? I mean nobody would do that but is it allowed to kick the pat on the other site?
your videos are so good I love stats and numbers so much xD
Whoa
I've scored 1 point in madden 16
Could the game end 6-1 if on an extra point or two point conversion by team a, team b instead of running it into the end zone kicks a drop kick? Or would that even count?
that 1 point safety soundtrack really spooked me out
Is the one-point safety only in NCAA rules?
I have just wasted almost 22 minutes on convoluted bullcrappage by a guy with a great voice...
This is one of the best youtube videos I have ever seen
scorigami is fantastic! thanks!
This was awesome
i like how he made us wait till the end
Epic video, man. So awesome.
I feel like every time I watch a football game now, I will be wondering if it was a scorigami.
seeing how little amount of 8 pt plays there were makes it all the more impressive that the patriots had 2 back to back in the Super Bowl to win
"""that was sad, let's keep it sad.""

me_irl"
"His likelihood of a 4-4 game is a little off.

Although this would be hard to calculate, in reality, the chance would be lower:
When one team scores a safety, they need to kick it off to the other team.  Usually this kickoff gives good field position for the other team making it even more likely that they would score, and less likely that on that drive they would get a safety.

A reason why it would be more likely to happen than he calculated:
His statistics that he used for how many overtime games end in ties is based off of statistics from before the overtime rule change.  It used to be that the first team that scored won, no matter what.  Now if you score a field goal, the other team has a chance to tie or pull ahead.  This makes it more likely that it will be a tie because a field goal on the first drive doesn't automatically end the game.

There are a few other things that don't make as much of a difference, but are still a factor.  An example of this is that now on kickoffs the ball starts at the 25 yard line on a touchback, not the 20, which makes it harder to get a safety."
Quality
the fact I can't skip ads make me wan a delete YouTube app think I will and find some where else to watch random crap
This is literally one of the most interesting well made different videos. The way the scenes flow and change, the animations, music, creativeness... o give this 10/10 it just impressed me alt
Does vox not give you any money at all? Interesting topic but oddly written and choppy editing made it rough on my stomach. SB deserves better than this.
That was fascinating. Thanks Jon Bois!
the defensive 2pt and 1pt conversions only entered the NFL in 2015 when they moved the PAT back.  But I doubt anyone will ever get a defensive 1 point conversion
the research tho!! the amount of work you put in this video for a 100k sub counts is amazing. i subbed just for the efforts! but the music... WTF
There is more than a 5-point play in basketball, a 17 point play has happened before... Which was also a 5 point play for the other team. http://deadspin.com/5152216/high-school-basketball-team-pulls-off-rare-17-point-play-for-the-win-update
What a well made and superbly edited video
You don't understand people going to watch the 0-0 game? Soccer is pretty popular worldwide! haha!
Boycotting your videos now... Who the hell is this Washington NFL team?...
How long did this video take?
This is incredible.  Great video!!!!
My mind was blown
Surprised 21-14 had never happened
My head hurts
Teach us the arts of scoregami
Of course that happened to the Browns 😂
wtf that was sick
Not sure if it's the voice, the mystery of "scorigami" or the music, but this video has some serious anime vibes to it.
Could they also get that single point by drop kicking an extra point during the conversion try by the defense running it back 98 yards? I fully understand how hard would be, just wondering if that would count.
This is fantastic. Should've talked about Steelers Chargers, 11-10 a few years back. Troy Polamalu returns a desperation lateral by the Chargers back to the house only to have the touchdown called back (even though it was clear that the pass was backwards and the score should've been upheld). The call preserves the scoragmi in the only 11-10 game in history. As a kid, even as a Steelers fan, I remember rooting for them to overturn the call just to witness history! haha
I should be doing a lab right now due in less than two hours..
Next season it's gonna get done now that you said it can't
A 1 to 1 score is possible however. The chances of that happening are absolutely nearly impossible.
Ok, so 1 point is possible in any game where the other team scores a touchdown?  So its not just 6-1 that will keep scorigami going on forever, right?
I loved this video
Good video but Washington has a name. REDSKINS!!! Dont be afraid to say it proudly.
Great vid. However, on 6:37 you crossed off the Buffalo Bills as they should've been included with the three other teams. Sorry for nit-picking.
This video sucks
On Tecmo Super Bowl I beat the Raiders with the Seahawks (Cortez Kennedy) 2 - 0  in OT. I thought it was the best game of TSB I ever played.
It'd be interesting to see a College football scorigami with schools that are in the FBS right now
what. the hell. lol
I guess the people who disliked, thought this was click bait, has cancer, is autistic, or somehow thinks this guys logic is autistic
Why arent the superbowl scores in here? Huh? you said ever
how do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
This video inspired me to go on to madden and win a game 6 to 1.
If you add college scores you could have a crazier scoragmi
Really good video I must say.
"A crazier stat is that in 1905, 19 players were killed during play, due to the lack of helmets
Source: http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/19-football-players-died-in-1905-but-calls-for-reform-1277528900"
Solid video, kept my attention for the full 20 minutes and I'm not incredibly interested in football.
0-0 game, Team scores, time has expired, decides to go for two anyways, purposely runs it back for a safety.
awesome chart
one point safety
Jon Bois Editing and Production is A1
how about the 6 to 6 Seahawks tie with cardnails on Sunday night football now that game was crazy!
18:27 is rhe 6-1 game
In high school you can end 1-0 if you don't score in overtime because they go off of who goes the farthest
You can score 1-0. It's a 1point safety.
If you want proof that the one point is possible look at Brian Boddy Calhoun who in 2016 fumbled ,what would be a pick six, into the end zone resulting in a safety
nice video
This is very interesting and all and I love the concept of the video but you lost me after 4 min. I wasn't going to watch the whole 22 min of this. It's a shame, on my part. But I'm really not interested in finding out about the possibility of 6-1 score. Your amazing video made me sit the first 4 min.
This video was incredibly well done
nice video very informative
IF EVER THERE IS A 6-1 GAME, BROWNS WILL BE ON THE LOSING SIDE OF 6-1
What's the song at the end?
awesome video man
This video was pretty spectacular. Very informative and fun to watch.
Awesome video
I think the fact that there are not a lot of "good" games makes the actual good games that much better because they're rarer
The music made this video amazing lol good stuff
Someone make a video of them getting the 6-1 score in Madden. It'd be interesting to have people pre-enact some of these crazy scorigamis in Madden, considering Madden is a tangible thing we can actually visualize. That is considering Madden would have some of these peculiar rules such as the 1-point safety. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't tbh.
my high school once won a game 2-1. safety> rouge
I love the sports reference websites for years. They have literally every single statistic ever, and I love it.
This was incredibly interesting. I enjoyed every single minute.
Falcons 43-22 Packers, a new Scorigami.
This video was amazing
who knows about the game last year (2016) when the buccaneers beat the Seahawks 14-5?
Extremely well edited. Well done.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
lets go seahawks
I can't believe the bears have the highest score
Why isnt 2-1 possible
MIND BLOWN
8-0 browns win
Lol Pete is the wizard
You can have a one score if you get cancer and watch Andrew drinks water #1
KC vs ATL had a 2-point defensive conversion. It actually won the Chiefs the game.
17:16 Actually, the first play of Super Bowl XLVI was a safety.
Why was this recommended to me? I've never even watched anything relating to football, nor do I watch or really enjoy it. GODDAMN IT YOUTUBE!
Gotta give this guy props
Actually for the 1-point safety and the 6-1 game, A falling on the ball in the endzone wouldn't be a safety. A would have to recover, run it out of the endzone, and then fumble it back in again (or run backwards into the endzone again) and be tackled.
My brother and I scored the one point on an old game of NCAA. He fumbled the two point, I ran it back and fumbled on the one
if an extra point is blocked and run back, is it one or 2 points
you didnt go back to the college game
There are actually new rules implemented to where now a pat can be brought back for one point. And a pick six on a 2 point conversion gives the defending team 2 points. So 1-0 isn't possible but 6-1 is possible in 2 different ways now. They used to call a play dead on fumbled pats and fumbles or interceptions on 2 pt conversions. But not since the new rules for the 2016-2017 season.
Just thought I'd inform you that the Washington, DC based American football team is called the Redskins.
this just made me whole
Original Video
This was amazing! Great editing and animations
I'm such an idiot that I got on Google Maps just so I could find out where he zoomed in on at 16:22.
For the one point safety, let's say team A scores the touchdown, and team B intercepts the two point conversion attempt and takes it back almost all the way then fumbles.  If team A recovers the fumble in the endzone and gets tackled, is that a one point safety scored to team B or just a zero point 'touchback?'  Do they actually have to recover it outside of the endzone and then move backwards into the endzone while trying to advance the ball for it to truly count as a one point safety?  This video implies that the 'touchback' situation also counts as a one point safety.
Now I know why it's called the quake run
Not only can't it be done. It's not a safety! They would have to recover on the field and then enter the end zone to be tackled there.
The Patriots could win a game 14 to 17.
I love this video
The Patriots beat the Titans 59-0
Phenomenal video! This has got to be one of, if not, the most interesting video I've ever seen about football. Thank you so much for your dedication!
What if the extra point bounces off the post and goes into the opponents goal post thus making a 6-1 game
wow that was probably one of the beast 21 minutes of my life
awesome video!
Whoever you are you need to play Light Yagami in the American live action deathote
"Honest question: Can anyone ever see a woman conceptualizing this, writing this, filming this and editing this? 

Men are just smarter than women. Facts are all around us."
AMAZING video idea dude!
For defensive 2 pt conversion, at 9:10, you should have shown a 6 point lego block. great video overall man. edit: this is really good, and I like the ending
neat
Thank you for including the rouge.
A rouge can happen, it's very rare.
Having trouble pronouncing the word "Redskins" I see... smh
That was a beautiful video
The 1-pt safety can also happen on an extra point on a fumbled snap where the kicker has to kick the ball backwards out of play, I think.  That scenario happened on a punt in a Pats-Colts playoff game.
The background music from 7:20-8:30 and at 9:57--> (and others?) sure does it for me..  Oy!
I enjoyed this video a lot more than I probably should have
what the hell did I just watched? is this autism? I like it. I imagine a new trend in making internet fuss everytime a possible socrigame might happen and people celebrating it cheering back and fort on teams to achieve it,. this is nice... certain imageboard might like it.
This man just made football interesting.
Awesome video
there is a way you can get 1 pt in football, but rare
Good-ass video
"Washington NFL Team"? wtf is that?? Is it because of the name being 'racist'? This is just sad now.
great vid, almost delegitimized by "Washington NFL franchise"
Could someone explain me how is 6-1 possible but not 7-1? A TD and 1pt field goal would give 7
What about a TD then a Blocked Extra Point that is returned????  6-1????
this was a great video.
If I could ever use one video to sum up my life, this would be it.
The one 11-10 game mentioned during this was Pittsburgh and San Diego in 2008.  Remember it like it was yesterday.
My mind is blown
that is cool
This is super interesting. You should create a website or blog or something detailing the "scorigamis" in the current season, would definitely watch it to get deeper into the game.
"Scoragamis this year according to the graph

Seahawks 37, 49ers 18
Patriots 41, Bills 25
Panthers 46, 49ers 27
Falcons 45, Saints 32
Falcons 48, Panthers 33"
mind blown
Great video
There is such a thing as a one point safety...
in 1922 you can see a 62-0 win, jesus
yo i know this is prp realy late but i kinda want a pdf of the chart
"If you search IMG 0001 you will actually see a video that has like 9 views that is of a deer eating some leaves!

Maybe that's what he was talking about at the end"
awesome vid
Technically 1 point could be scored if the defense gets a turnover on an extra point attempt and drop kicks it.
This was actually really cool
good video
Nice video man
If teams tried for a scorigami then wouldn't Goodell investigate for gambling purposes?
What's the score that has occurred the most?
Amaizing video!!!
This was a really good video....
I'm surprised Tomlin doesn't have more Scorigami games given how often he goes for 2.
He should do rugby
Greatest video ever
This needs to happen with college football
For the defensive 2-pt conversion...there's a 7 block not a 6 block.....
Where is the Seahawks 58-0 win against the Cardinals? I don't see it on there
I believe it but this doesn't work in madden
Titans in 2013 got a safety Vs the steelers on the kickoff. The dude caught the ball and took a knee but he had part of his foot out of the end zone so when he stepped back in and kneed it, it was a safety
I  could not stop watching this..
"IMG 3288

thank me later"
Very cool video!
this is my favorite football channel on youtube
my brain hurts
How do ties happen?
American football is boring and always will be.
Ok that was cool
I'm not much of a football fan, but I love these sort of statistical analysis videos. This was very interesting and well made, great video!
sooo this could have happened in the pro bowl?
This was an AMAZING presentation.  Was the slideshow made with Prezi?
Wow not even really a fan of football.. But i sat through all 20 minutes of this, i guess i really like this whole over analyzing thing.
as far as i know there is no 5 pt play in basketball even if you make a 3 and they fould you plus technical then you will have 2 chances to score 1 free throw.
18:24 Explanation of 6-1 score, finally.
Good job on 100,000 subs. At this moment im typing this he has not even 101,000 subs but over 100,000 subs
This is a true masterpiece
7:56 42 of them were scored by the Steelers.
only video about the NFL i'm interested in.
Fascinating video. Thank you.
I was pretty sure you could get a 1 point Safety without scoring a Touchdown.... not sure tho
the 2-0 score is due to a safety being the only score not attributed to a player
i like the part after 8:34
the 63-0 does not have a square, however the patriots beat the titans 63-0 in either 2010 or 2009
Great video, lots of effort
If I play in the NFL I will make the 6-1 game just for you
"International Rugby Union is another sport that Scorigami could work with. Tries (touchdowns) are 5 points, Point after conversions 2 points and penalty goals/drop kicks 3 points. But what shakes it up is than tries have changed in value from 1 through to 5 points over the life of the game, conversions 2-3 points, an briefly dropkicks were worth 4 points. 

Yep, in the early days of rugby the PAT was worth more than the touchdown."
What am I wasting. My life watching.
what program did you use to make this?
Has anyone tried the 6-1 game in Madden?
Really interesting video. The one thing I would have to say is that the calculation for the probability of a 4-4 game is a little incorrect. You're assuming that each probability is independent of each other, where in real life, if two good defenses were to play each other, the actual conditional probability of the 4-4 game happening would be higher than the number calculated. However, calculating that might be quite difficult, and I'm just nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking.
This video is lit
the two point defensive conversion in Madden lol
The look on the ref's face at 9:40 is priceless: "how the hell am I supposed to explain this to everyone watching?????"
That one time in the NFL...
This is the only good YouTube video thanks jon
This is entertaining
The scenario you posed for 6-1...wouldn't the kicking team have to pick up the fumble OUTSIDE the end-zone, and then run it back into the end zone? Falling on a fumble that's in your own end zone doesn't result in a safety, since the impetus came from the player who fumbled.
"And I promise we will get to it." -Audeince: Ughhhhhhh
didnt know math could be fun
if you play Madden you should attempt to get scorigami
6-1 could also happen if a missed extra-point were to remain in the field of play, be recovered by the opposing team and run all the way back to the opposite endzone. Right?
This is the most interesting video I have ever watched.
Where can I buy that poster?
at 6:30 were they really called the "Washington NFL team"?
Btw, they have the forfeit be 2-0 because a safety can be a stat where no player gets it, such as running out of the back, so they have it be 2-0 so no player gets any stats.
You earned a subscriber great video
Can a win of 10-1 happen?
"I know a great deal about football and I found this video to be really informative.

About the 6-1 scoragami scenario you presented though. I'm pretty sure on a regular play, it would result in a touch back where team A would have the ball on their 20 yard line instead of team B getting a safety. So I think to truly get a 6-1 game, you would need a panicked or confused team A player to take the ball all the way back to their own endzone without turning the ball over to team B."
you're math was way off. if there's a 86 % chance of a scoreless ot, you don't multiply by 86. because if there was a 100 % chance then the odds would be bigger (?) that doesn't make sense. can I work at SB please? I'll do the math to start out with but it will be so good that I'll get to write op eds. these are my dreams.
im lost
John Boise you forgot to mention the odds that both times a 1 point safety happened in college football, the same announcer was there.
(Commenting about the end of the video) Most videos with no views on YouTube are just listings for houses, cars and other junk.
Can't you get a one point play if you block an extra point and run it back?
What a good video
This guy changed my life
this is brilliant
Someone knows how to use Prezi, watch out :o
1-0 is possible if the score is 0-0 and one team forfeits.
9:21 this can also happen by blocking the point after touchdown. Unfortunately, my team actually went through this rare scenario when kicking an extra point to win the game because the now former special teams coach of my team was insanely inept.
you should mark Scoragami's that have happened in Superbowl's in red.
This is amazing! I don't comment often but I really appreciate the work you put into this - how you made numbers & scores so interesting is beyond me but it was fun to watch!
this is an excellent video, you deserve more views for the work that went into this.
Doing a scorigami for the CFL would be crazy
So... Totally random: but you say that no team has ever ended a game with 4 points... but there is a green square in one of the 4's (like 14-4 or something, didn't quite see what the opponents score was).
Why isn't a 1-1 game possible, drop kicks are worth 1-point there for because NFL games can end in ties there can be a 1-1 score
but there are 1 pt safeties
6-1 can also occur by having a touchdown by team A followed by a blocked extra point, fumble, or pick which is returned almost to the endzone, before the team B player carrying it, for whatever reason, drop-kicks it through the posts.
The alternative 6-1 scorigami is if the extra point is blocked and the ball somehow makes its way into the scoring team's end zone with them on top. An 85 yard block is unlikely however, and would also likely require a return that is fumbled and recovered in the end zone by the scoring team.
this is the most elaborate uselessness I've ever witnessed.
why does this not have a million views this is amazing
12:46: The most Browns thing to ever Browns.  And there have been a lot.
Isn't there another way to score 1 point or is that just college?
you keep on talking about how the nfl was able to last because all the games were "boring". You have the privilege of being able to watch a leauge that has had almost 100 years of history. The rules have changed so much since then that defenses are able to do much less. You have the context of what a "good" game is, people back then didn't.
@19:11 you can also get 1 point as defense, if the extra point kick, is short, and a defensive player catchs its and return it 100 yards.
Falcons blew a 28-3 game
What about the one point safety?
6-1 happened to me in madden
This is literally the best video I've ever watched
The reason the game ends 2-0 if a team forfeits is because a safety is the only score that isn't recorded to a specific player
need to remake this cause Pete Carroll Struck again witha  6-6 tie.
My ideal game is a defensive battle that ends like 5-3 or 7-2 maybe 13-7.
Did I just spend 20 min watching this?
lol i did this in madden like 5 yrs ago and won 6-1
coach of team a tells all receivers to run backwards, QB throws int the instead of attempting to tackle the defender, they just punch the ball, let it roll into the end zone then team A picks up ball in end zone and "falls" out of bounds
IDK if it fits here but what about the seahawks 6-6 tie with the cardinals in October 2016?
Wouldn't a 6-1 also be possible if a conversion was intercepted or fumbled and then a drop kick was scored by the the defense??
That's not that bad
amazing
How about the defensive two point conversions where if the defense gets a TD during a conversion their team gets 2 points?
Coolest vid ive seen in a while nice work!
14:00 explains the browns organization in one play
The team with 1 can score 7 and get 3 safety's resulting in a 6-1 score
I have you a like, just because this took an insane amount of research
CRAP! at 14:23 I thought my screen was falling to its side I literally grabbed my monitor XD
Fantastic.
Related: Probability of winning the final score in Super Bowl Squares http://tabsoft.co/2ko8AIK
"Here's what I wonder... how close would Madden scorigami be to NFL scorigami? Are you more likely to see a Madden simmed game end 6-1 significantly before 1.7 billion seasons pass. What other differences are there? Are there scores much more likely to happen in Madden that have never happened in the NFL?

Seriously... is scorigami... ""in the game""?"
"There was a game that I went to where at one time the score was 11 - 10 Iowa. (Iowa ended up winning 14 - 13)
But this is possible by:
Michigan: 1 touchdown, 1 Field goal.
Iowa: 1 safety,  1 touchdown (2 Point conversion failed), 1 field goal."
I love how he makes scoragami sound like this famous historically important thing not something he made up 20 minutes ago
I'm not a football fan, at all, but that video was amazing!
The Steelers just scored 6 field goals in a game
10-1 try and calculate those odds. One touchdown plus defensive 1 point convert plus QTY 2 2 point converts.
Might be fun to play pro Scoragami every season with just scores from the season so that first game of the pre-season the board was 'empty'. You buy scores based on probability or some such.
2-pt conversion on Falcons...
will you be updating the chart after the Super Bowl?
I think it's kind of nuts that 14-8 hasn't happened.  Winning team gets 2 touchdowns (simple), losing team decides to try for 2 pt conversion on their sole touchdown to be in better position to win.  That's kind of an insane move, since a failure puts them in crazy bad position, but I could see it happening.
Early football was pretty much one or two powerful teams and then like 6 garbage teams, many of which no longer exist. It was also running based before the forward pass was even legal. 3 yards and a cloud of dust football.
werent field goals originally 5 points?
Forfeits are scored as a 2-0 score because safeties are not awarded to any player but instead to a team
Eric Berry made a defensive 2 point conversion this season
I wonder if Madden would accurately reflect the 1-point safety on conversion attempts. Probably not, but someone needs to try it.
this video was pretty good
But there's a one point safety when the defense recovers the ball over any type of turnover and retreat back into their own endzone and get tackled.
You deserve way more subscribers.  These videos are great!!!!!  Keep up the good work!!
That was like...cool
This stuff is better than Matlock.
How do you score 5 in 1 basketball play? I guess you could make a 3, get fouled, miss the free throw, get the rebound, and score 2. But this isn't a 5 point play, it is a 3 and 2 point play. 7:03
I'm surprised 8-7 has never happened
Some kicker,maybe Tucker, this year suggested 1 point for kicking the ball through the uprights on a kickoff.  So there may actually be hope for 1-0 after all!!

At 14:03, only the Browns could lose a game that way.😂😂😂
Amazing video's Jon. Keep em coming.
2016 Week 14 TBvsNO got close. With 16-11 Tampa lead late, Bucs had the Saints deep in their endzone, forcing Brees to hurry a pass. Didn't quite get the sack, which would have gave us 18-11, and if it held (as 16-11 held with no safety) would have had a scorigami. But no dice...16-11 only happened previously in 2014 Week 15 NYJvsTEN -- and now its twice in 2 years
Bucs and saints on scoragomi alert
Ennui pretty much describes what it's like to be a Bears fan.
As a statistician, I'm not sure about your probabilities for figure 7; you can only multiply probabilities like that if the chance of each thing happening is independent, so the probability of one thing happening doesn't affect the probability of the other thing happening, so you can multiply the probability of a die landing on 6 and a coin landing on heads, but you shouldn't multiply the probability of one person in a family having a genetic disease by the probability of their sister having it, because if one of them has it the other is more likely to. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about the rules of football, but I'd suspect that a team who gets two two-point safeties is likely to not be very good, so they're more likely to be shut out, but then if both teams get two safeties, neither are likely to be very good, so a scoreless overtime is more likely... Your numbers probably aren't far off, but the calculations aren't particularly rigorous.
If Jon ever made another episode on NBA y2k, he could do an episode on breaking the record for lowest scoring game by having the final score to be 1-0. How? Bump all the player's attributes to 0, but keep Jon's players free throw at 100 and the AI's draw foul attribute to 100. Make one free-throw and miss them all, and that's it
I wish there was more dark scorigami tbh. It's cool, and kind of scary. I hope the NFL makes weird rules that give teams like 100 points for something stupid. god I love the Chart Party music
If you like high scoring games so much, watch either college or arena. The NFL is at its best when it's lower close scores.
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
this had better be the only jon bois video exclusively posted on this channel, or I am in for a long night
If the Seahawks ever have the ball near their endzone at the end of a game up by 3+, after giving up a safety (say holding in the endzone, this'll happen with their Oline), you know what Pete is gonna instruct Jon Ryan to do
i dont know anything about american football, why did i watch this
Unbelievably awesome video. In-depth, well paced, and interesting throughout. A tour de force of NFL scoring. 10/10 would watch again.
Damn SB Nation great video, cool mix of history and wacky stats. Honestly you guys deserve so many more views and subs, because no one is making videos like this. Also I bet the research for this episode was a nightmare, keep it up!!!
wtf did i just watch
Hey jon, when you are calculating the odds of a 4-4 game and you consider the offense being shut out, how are you accounting for other defensive scores, like a pick 6 or fumble return TD.... (or dare I say a 3rd safety, but let's not go there)?
The ground rule safety at 3:30 was weird as hell
This video was incredibly well put together and inspiring. I'll be taking notes.
Isn't blocking an extra point and returning it for a TD worth one point?
I really want to know why the teams were terrible at the beginning?
jon bois is back, he is my favorite filmmaker
6-1 would probably only happen with a team deciding to do something weird. I don't know, last play of game, scoreless, team scores TD (why not a FG? I don't know, I'm making this scenario up). They get the snap for the PAT, and run it back all the way, intentionally taking the 1 point safety. It's not likely, but it's more likely than it happening by chance
Also Jon by adding the rogue you could get a 1-0 game
Excellent video!
i love this
This is so retarded .... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have to ask: Where's the updated Scorigami chart in picture form so we can play along? Last one on SB Nation was posted back in 2012.
Another Seahawks Scorigami two weeks ago: the 5-13 vs. the Bucs
Once again, absolutely brilliant.
Now, do scorigami college football. That would be hell considering how many college games have been played, but it would be cool
chiefs - falcons week 13 2016 ending in a pick 2
Pretty good.
This was great
I'm waiting for the day of an 0-0-16  season by every team... what would happen?
Jon, you blow me away every time with your videos. May I ask how long it took you to do this one? Thanks for the content. You have a huge future ahead of you.
I hate to say it but I believe you guys are wrong about the ability to score 1 point. I believe the rule is that if you get a safety on a 2 point conversion or a extra point attempt then it awards the team who got the safety with 1 point. Rule 11-3-2-c. "If a try results in what would ordinarily be a safety against either team, one point is awarded to the opponent.
Don't underestimate the masochism of bears fans
Very cool
9:14 that's the wrong piece!
What about the 10-4 score you have marked on your board?

this is pretty good
