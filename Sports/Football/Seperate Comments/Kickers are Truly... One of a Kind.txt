Sad..... but I'm a saints fan lol
These videos are so so good. Glad I found your channel
WHO DEY!
Is that really five point vids??
Seahawks fan here, weve had issues also. BUT!!!! We have Michael Dickson!! Our punter is iffy though
Damn I miss Phil Dawson
i always thought flemro was really short
Real brown is the Baltimore raven the now is the replacement brown LOL but it true
Us kickers are the are the best
Why does everyone hate on Cincinnati
The best kicker EVER https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Andersen The "Great Dane".
You could easily make a series on crazy kicks. Each episode with a story. Of the top of my head, the New Orleans missed XP, the Eagles recordbreaking 60+yards last year, FG and XP returns, fake FG (has there been any?), and on and on and on...
I am Utah's token Browns Fan! See you at the Denver Saturday Game?
I was completely intrigued by that video! Great job buddy.
Rodrigo Blankenship is incredible. I hope he goes on to be as good in the Pros as he is right now.
My dad was at that packers vs bears game where the kicker ran it in
Well I‚Äôm here to waste my time but this truly took the cake
That fat kid on tiktok is a fat ass
What about Tom Dempsey? Man kicked with his right foot, which he only had HALF OF. He still holds one of the longest FG attempts in game, which he made. Again, with half a foot!
2:05 no pads? and why does he have what looks to be a cameltoe
"Imagine being a Bills fan...we lost a Super Bowl because of a missed kick. 

Still waiting....

Maybe by 2050."
gb packers best team dont argue
the cowboys probably gifted seatgeek the tour facility, practice field time, and box. so in effect they're rewarding the scalpers of their own tickets. gotta love it. they even swindle taxpayers to build stadiums. great video btw.
Garo Yepremian ...1971 Dolphins kicker ...comedic gold
Viniterri running down Herschel Walker...hilarious
I reckon  the  Grammatica brothers were high on something when they used to kick.  They were crazy,  we'll at least one of them was,  Martin right?!
How do you not have 1M subs? That‚Äôs my only question... üòÇ
Kickers might have bad days because someone else is doing something wrong. I mean, the ball might not be held properly by the person who holds the ball for the kicker, and that would affect the kick. Also, Charlie Brown can tell you that you can't kick a ball that's yanked away from you.
‚ÄúPretend to be a bears fan.‚Äù But I hate the stupid team. They‚Äôre not even good. From, the biggest football fan in the universe.
Lol, now Adam V is the all-time leading scorer üòÇ
#BringBackDawson
Go Browns!
Raelly gary andreson had to miss that kick
Yes my favorite team vikings kicker bad
Kickers literally have one job
funny an undafted kicker is the nfls all time points leader adam vinitari
You want to make the kicking game fun.  Make all kickers use the straight on style. I still have my toe kicking shoe if needed.  I t took 30 years for the soccer style kicker to break my high school records.
HOT ROD, RESPECT THE SPECS!!!!!!!!
As a Dawg fan... Herschel and Hot Rod are my favoritesüòäüòäüòä
bengals trash excuse you?
Love ya kto but you can‚Äôt be calling the bengals trash like that
It felt like you were building up to a point the whole video and then it just ended. Maybe I‚Äôll have to watch it again, by this video felt like a book with a beginning and middle but no end.
Hey man, don't be so sad. Our old kicker back at Minnesota lost us the Packers game. You're not alone. Yet somehow, this dude is making 60 yard field goals in my Madden franchise, no joke.
RIP Morten Anderson is the all-time leading scorer statistics
Bye bye browns Head coach and OC...
Ohhh yeah  BULLDOGS
Lol, Vinarteri is all time point scorer now.
im an Alabama fan an its nice having a great offence/defence but everytime our field goal unit comes out i get nerves.
PRESURE IS THE NAME OF THEIR GAME ...not the same to hit bullseye ina bar when nothing is on the line , and no one cares¬† ... than to do it when there are millions of dollars at stake and the world is watching
Ayyeee I‚Äôm a browns fan
4:20 now vinatieri is the leading scorer #goat
LMAO that Green Bay kicker railed some white lightning and was like "F*CK, F*CK, F*CK" and scored
There are still Browns fans? Wow, they really suck
Is five point vids a ravens fan. Because Tree is a Steelers fan. Flemlo is a bungled fan. KTO is a browns fan. You‚Äôve got the AFC north as the 4 best sports YouTubers.
"‚ÄúImagine being a bears fan‚Äù 
sheds tear ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to imagine‚Äù"
Rodrigo Blankenship gets the loudest cheers during the lineups at UGA
Man I miss Phil Dawson
Was the all time points leader
then i might as well be a kicker for denver
Adam just beat the overall points!
Great vid. Keep it up.
Yo I'm a bears fan
hotrod is the man
I miss Phil Dawson.
fuck seatgeek and ticketmaster and all the others
I love Adam Vinatieri
Makes me miss Phil Dawson. Smh
Please what is that song from the end
I live in south dakota and Adam vineteri and brock lesnar inspire me to try
If someone knows beat when he shows the dawson field goal let me know
I saw that ‚Äúbengals‚Äù trash I‚Äôm a bengals fan so try me lol
Ironic I‚Äôm watching this as the browns new kicker missed a fg and PAT against the Steelers
Watching Steelers versus browns right now and write has to is watching this video of the brown making the kick the Browns just made field goal
Why are Qb's and the kickers the most scrawny?
Cleveland native, life-long browns fan here. I remember watching that game with my folks. Things got crazy in my house lol. WOOF WOOF
We‚Äôre you playing with big dick jezzer
kickers are wierd
Browns are trash foh
Nice to see this guy finally getting the views he deserves
Blair walsh
Finally, someone who tells the outcome of the game for people who don‚Äôt know. Subbed.
5:06 who is that?
"Gonzales has missed to the left
Has missed to the right 
He even has missed thru the middle"
"A Rugby Fly-Half watching Football kickers....

This might be interesting...."
One of your best vids yet brother. Keep em coming!
The Browns. The emblem on the field is a Brown helmet. They suck and are a shit team called the Browns. When you go to take a shit you're bringing the Brown's to the Super Bowl. Change the fucking name already and maybe they might actually have a record better then 3-13.
Hey I‚Äôve been a fan for 4 months now I‚Äôd love to see a collaboration with you and flemlo you went to the game with him I‚Äôm also a fan of his and I think you guys could make some really good collaborations
so the moral of the story is: ZANE GONZALEZ SUCKS
ZI am a Browns fan and I like baker.
okay so i was 9 when the ravens browns game happened at the end of this video and i was also there in the stadium "Ravens fan" and they said it was no goood and the announcer told everyone to drive safe and have a nice evening. half the stadium was gone by the time they decided it was good and to send it to overtime. i was so pissed and heart broken lol.
Why didn't browns renew Phil Dawson's contract üò£
I'm a browns fan to
Mmg did all this
Your channel makes my lazy Saturdays at college worth it. Your content is among the best I've seen. Thank you, sir.
College football has more action because they want to make the leagues.
You went back to the 80s, but you should've gone one more decade for Tom Dempsey. I mean he kicked a 63-yarder and the dude only had half a foot.
Bengal trash what
RIpping on them physically?  Look at most kicker's bios they were generally star position players in high school on top of basketball/baseball/track.  Adam Vinatari was a stud in high school as a QB, Middle Backer, and other sports. Plus how can there not be 32 competent kickers?  Ok, how can there not be 32 competent QBs?
Those were missed intentionally lol
5:13 I actually am a bears fan
Urinating tree was there!
Bro idk why but you sound like mr nightmare
Man I'm from sweden and while american football isnt a big sport here I watch all of the highlight reels. Stumbled across this video and I gotta say you have an amazing storytelling capability! You keep it so interesting for the viewers to watch these different videos since you are cunning and have amazing production value.
Seatgeek is giving us tons of free shit to lure people to their site. Fuck off dude. You dumb as shit?
Chargers had that Korean kid that missed everything.  Where is he now?
Just subscribed I'm a Browns fan to

When it hits the crossbar for me in Madden 18, it's good.
F'ing awesome video, well done sir.
And CAN YOU KICK A FOOTBALL?
Kickers have by far the most points ever scored.
Rob Bironas. 60 yards. Never forget.
0:50 fite me boi
Glad we got rid of Zane Gonzalez
They get paid a bunch of money to kick a ball then chill and enjoy a front row seat of nfl games lol
Being a ex semi pro ‚öΩ football player, I'm pretty confident that I could kick one of your eggs the entire length of the field...
TO BROWN'S
"So THATS what the urinating tree looks like 
I know he already did a face reveal but the quality was shit"
Sodaküíù
just get mayfield out there to do a drop kick
I‚Äôm a ravens fan too lmaoüòÇ
Rodrigo Blankenship is the best kicker in all of college football
Browns have 8 championships, they will return to glory soon with or without a good kicker.
Blair Walsh and Nick Folk are straight ass. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Zayne Gonzalez! Put yo motherfuckin head back down you god damn BUM!!! - Chiseled Adonis
Skol browns
Who dat!
I‚Äôm a ravens fan and I‚Äôm gonna be honest that lost to the Browns wasn‚Äôt that bad that was a hell of a game and suspenseful as fuck rip Justin Tucker‚Äôs perfect extra point record lol
Surprised you didn't put anything about ganos 63 yarder
It‚Äôs not easy kicking a football. It‚Äôs not easy kicking a ball in general. The main point of kicking a ball is aiming at. You have to hit the ball in certain spots in order to go the direction you want to go. Ask soccer players. If you want to shoot  for a goal in a far distance, You need to aim and kick it in a certain spot of the ball. That‚Äôs because all ball textures all have a certain ways that balls move. A plain ‚öΩÔ∏è soccer ball has all those octagon line shapes because it causes the ball to spin in clockwise motion. That‚Äôs why you can sometimes see a soccer ball curve while it‚Äôs in the air. As for a football üèà . It‚Äôs main creation was for it to be throw. It‚Äôs egg shaped. ü•ö. When QBs throws the football, it in the air, the ball is in a spiraling motion. When it comes to kicking the ball, that egg shaped ball can be really hard to aim for a kicker. It gets worse if the weathers not on your side. Sure, Field goals and extra points are made most of the time, but it‚Äôs not easy kicking a football. Try it yourself. Warning though, they give you blisters
NICK ELLIOT.................google that scumbag. kicker for kc chiefs......
Phil Dawson was a beast and I was pissed when our Browns let him go..
I'm glad you brought up that Dawson kick. I remember watching that game live. Ray Lewis & the Ravens were pissed off that they play could even be reviewed. They ran into the lockerrooms thinking they had won the game.
Ravens just experienced the bad parts of kicking from their veteran.
I was at game 1, browns vs steelers... people left after we were down 7-21. They missed such a good game but it ended so annoyingly. We did get lucky when the steelers missed their FG but def should've won (that being said it was pooring down rain, but no excuses for week 2 for Gonzalez)
Cocaine is kicker juice
first of all your seats are the most perfect seats in all of Texas like I didn't think they came that visually appealing if I win the lottery first thing im doing is buying lifetime tickets to that suite
That opening photo...that was the Mount Rushmore of sports Youtubers. Stung a lil bit when I saw the shirts, though
Footballs such a weird sport because of the specifics with each position. Yeah other major sports have variations in positions, but it‚Äôs not like the difference between being a linebacker or a place holder haha
Tom Dempsey setting a record that stood for years (62 yards) with half a foot should be in this video
Kickers are so underrated just look up for the KC vs NE game no one talk about Gostkowski, he was perfect in the game with long FG and no one gave him the credit he deserves
Everyone is somewhat fit and then there is Tree.
You think your kicking just this season is bad I‚Äôm a Vikings fan and we can never kick üòÇ
3:53 "WHAT IS UP DRAMA ALERT NATION!"
You should do a video on the CAFL also known as the China Arena Football League, when I was in China just recently it seemed like a big deal.
Browns to the super bowl this year
Do the best NFL teams with a terrible quarterback
No one is wierder than Harmon.
Whats the name of that fancy tune in the outro ?
3:55 well that stat is kinda depressing dont ya think
Blankenship a beast go dawgs
MMG was at that seat geek thing
A lot of Kickers are sorry asf and only the Cowboys old kicker was Beast
I had club feet when I was born, there is less than 200,000 cases each year. Yes that is a big sum, but out of 7 billion people on the Earth this is a very rare case. Though because of the way my toes are shifted and slightly twisted I am a better kicker.
please do a video on last chance u players
I like the Georgia kickerüòé
Finna drop the browns in the super bowl
when you mentioned bad kickers you forgot kyle bambard
Stephen gostkowski few years back omg. 50/50 weather he would make it.
Wait WHAT ? cleavland has a football team last I heard they moved and haven't been seen on a score board since
Liked solely for rodrigo Blankenship in the thumbnail lmaoo
Hey KTO could you do a video on the 2016 Penn state football team and how they rallied from 2-2 to the rose bowl
What's the song at 9:00?
Kickers on cocaine. Murica
I‚Äôm a Vikings fan.  I‚Äôve had to deal with some of the worst chokes in nfl history
Did you see mmg
You can hear the amount of anger ravens fans were feeling. The stadium just entirely erupted XD
I hope you remember me been here since 25k
As someone who has marched on the cowboys field for band and am doing so again this year. The stadium sucks. The seats are jist plastic and the fieild was smaller than it should be. Not really sure why
Justin tucker.
Do tua tagovailoa next
Us vikings fans also hated Blair walsh
"Marvel: Infinity War is the biggest crossover ever.
SeatGeek: Hold my beer"
Hey KTO could do a video on the rams this season or the huskers and the rebuild?
Don‚Äôt let this change your mind from the fact they lost every game last year
Don't start sentences with "so".
The only players that use their FOOT in American FOOTball.
I was at the cowboys and lions game
Suites are the best. I went to the vikings preseason game and it was so fun!
What about the saints kicker with half a foot
Not as bad as aguayo
Blair Walsh?
Wtf why wasn‚Äôt EDP445 there for the flag football gameüòÇ
0:49 what makes this ok to say, I'm insalted, and your name just got on the List-who ever the F you are, putting a bengals fan out like that, your a coward, I'm calling your Comment Random and inflamatory, i would suspend you over this. make a mental note your Welcome in cincinnati , please come visit us, remember we dont want to visit the Puppy Farm
#steelersnation
You could have titled this browns kicking montage üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm a browns fan myself and I just got to say that I havent felt safe with a kicker since we had Phil Dawson
Has any team tried using a soccer player to be a kicker? It would be interesting to see how they would play
You should make a video on the past 10 heisman trophy winners and where they are now
Mmg was there
Love how you gotta a shot of Hot Rod... GoDawgs
My boy rodrigo
My dad actually coached mar Mosley‚Äôs son in football and is good friends with him me and my family have been to his mansion and farm
Blair Walsh has is the worst kicker don‚Äôt at me

"KTO: imagine if you are a bears fan

I‚Äôm a browns fan too, and Gonzales makes me want to cry. He legit lost us two easy games.
what if vick never got arrested
Rodrigo is my favorite kicker of all time üêêüêêüêê
What's the song at the end of the video
4:38 why is this dudes feet so long and skinny wtf
What about eagles vs. giants last year. 63 yards?
You should do a video of Jimmy Weirick who was a god at North football and won offensive player of the year for Ohio as well as qb of the year
MMG was there at that flag football game
Heartbreakingly bad kickers? One name: Scott Norwood.
"not sure if this has been done before but..
what if drew bledsoe never got hurt ?"
I‚Äôm a saints fan and I remember laughing at the end
Hi Hi hi hi hi Pin pin pin
man whats that song
Walsh,Carlson,and forbaith all suck but still SKOL VIKINGS
How can you say the bengals are trash when they are better than the Browns by a mile. Baker is trash
VENEZUELAN COCK SLUTS.....
Now that was an entertaining video!
Lol I caught your rag saying flemlo is Bengals trash. Ouch! Love both of y'alls content. Keep up the food work!
I wonder who the browns fans hate the worse among the AFC north division
So this video was a let down. We didn't learn about any odd behavior of kickers. The point of the video.
I Subbed because you said you were a browns fan my favorite player is nick chubb
the browns legend! mr phil dawson! love that dude. the browns won alot of games bc of that guy
wait are you from ohio and a rams fan? wth so am i!!! lol i doubt you are but thats awesome. im sorry to hear your a browns fan... ive watched my dad go through depressing times over the last 20 years..
kicking so much more complex than just kicking the ball, if any part of the operation(snapper, kicker, and holder) makes a mistake it compounds. and in the pros if the ball isn't kicked 1.5ish seconds after its snapped, its probably gonna get blocked because of the disadvantage the line is put at and a man that can likely run a 4.4 coming off the edge. people take the efficiency of kickers today for granted, the margin of error that a kicking play can have and still go well is slim and kickers still can keep 90% accuracy with all those variables is impressive.
Poor Cleveland Browns
Make a video about a great linemen
Kto's a browns fan like me
Wow SDSU... It's not very often you see good guys from FCS teams. Carson Wentz was just a very big coincidence... Ugh of only there were more griz in the NFL.
Talk about the 1982 nfl season with the player strike and the special edition 16 team playoffs!!!?? üî•
As a Georgia fan rodrigo is my man
yes. yes we are
My cousin is a kicker and is good friends with the QB
I love how ur vids end bro ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Rdcworld1 was there
9:00 song?
Cocaine is one hec* of a drug
"I'm just happy Justin Tucker is my kicker.






For now..."
"I am a bears fan this pisses me off
At least he got cut"
Why did he cover it up at the beginning.
Browns fans RIP I like the browns RIP me
Same happened with Randy Bullock while with the Texans. Highly promised kicker in college, bust in the NFL
go dalliscoboys
Urinating Tree is the image of Yinzerdom he could be my neighbor (I mean this in the most positive way possible)
Believe it or not Some Teams their Kickers are the all time high in points scored.
Do a what if the Packers took Barry Sanders instead of Tony Mandrch!!!
will you do a video on what happened to tavon austin?????
Falcons #1 kicker lol our best player got hurt matt bryant
I think the number 2 is cursed for the browns
Who-Dey
The number 2 is cursed for the browns
Imagine being a bills fan. Lost the super bowl bcuz of a kick
I'm a die hard UGA fan and Hot rod is a God and Herschel is even more
Everyone is a Browns fan deep down inside.
Adam is a god
Do a video about the Redskins superbowl bound replacements in 1979
Harmon from Blue Mountain State
5:12. I'm a bears fan. And if you include that clip one more time. I'm never ever watching another one of your vids again. This is your 1 and only warning
How about this for a crazy field goal. I think it was Robbie Gould, though it could have been Paul Edinger, but there was a time when the ball hit all 3 bars and went through. It hit the right upright first, then the left upright about halfway down, and finally it bumped the crossbar on it's way down. It went through but it was that crazy kind of event that had you thinking wtf.
Same thing with hockey goalies
he said ‚Äúimagine to be a bears fan‚Äù... first time i‚Äôve ever heard that come from a browns fan LMAO
justin tucker ????????????
That is my my uncle
Hey kto I saw a 27 yard line theory for the Skol clan I saw it on nfl network please do a video on that
Troydan gaming was there
Papa Meages was there
Why does the vikings somehow always fuck it up
They Might be weird! But the game is still rigged üòè Just Like the NBA
Best football channel on YouTube.
1:00 Thank me later.
Nice vid
"""98 NFC championship game"" - slam your fist onto any flat surface whilst saying ""damn"" 

hopefully someone will understand where this is from."
Kickers are actually goats
Just found your channel browns fans for life man. There gonna beat the bucs. GO BROWNS!!!
The browns suck
wasnt zane gonsalez injured in the pelvic area when he did those kicks?
Fuck the Shitty Browns, Ravens Nation y‚Äôall getting that ass dusted when y‚Äôall come to Bmore
Browns are my home team.... but they suck
I'm8
I'm a kicker
Only reason Jets lost to Browns, the league SCREWED Jets; that was their 3rd game in 11 days.
yeh go brows
You've gotta do the Texas rangers 2010 and 2011. The best team to never win a World Series.
I guess you just forgot that Justin Tucker exists, because one would think he might warrant a mention in a video like this.
As a Chargers fan, thank you for not mentioning Josh Lambo‚Äôs performance against the Browns in 2016 üòÇ
"I'm surprised you didnt bring up the kicker for the Colts in Super Bowl V.  A rookie, Jim O' Brien, at kicker won the game for them under threat by his teammates. After the game, the men in the Baltimore lockeroom put away their scizzors in front of him, saying they couldn't cut the young mans hair (long hair was considered a no-no).
I'll give you props though for avoiding the obvious Gary Yepremian(?) gaffe against the 'skins in their perfect season, or showing his badly balding head, as every other topic bringing up kickers tends to do."
The Vikings have a history of having good kickers every other time of the season but they turn terrible when needed he most
I love that you're an underdog guy.. I'd love to see some GT love
OH SHIT WHAT UP UT FLEM FPV
Is this because you met mmg
How are you gonna have a video about kickers, and not mention Tom Dempsey?
To much pressure on the kickers
Go browns
I am a browns fan to
best in state of georgia for the fresman class üòãüòã
im a kicker
No mention of Justin Tucker the god of kickers rn
seatgeek=dad
Yo we‚Äôre not weird we‚Äôre just different üòÇ sometimes I kick barefoot
Post more plz I watched all your videos
bengals aint trash
what a random vid
This Channel is a replacement Kicker.
Kickers are like YouTube Content Creators. Most of them don't have enough talent or creativity to run a Media Channel but they make incompetent videos like this for attention anyway. It's like you missed the Point of your own Video... They aren't doing anything weird. The Barefoot thing is Kinda wierd... I guess... The MVP was because of a Strike so they Had to give it to someone... The Odd fg at the end is cool but Footballs are shaped weird, had nothing to do with the Kicker... Why don't you answer your Original Statement? Isn't that what a Report is about? Do you not know how to write a Report?
KTO can you please do what if mike jones doesn't make the tackle in super bowl 34?
Letting go of Awesome Phil Dawson was a huge mistake. Regardless of the franchise tag. Pay that man. He still kicks today and is still one of the top!
Your a lefty just like me
Rodrigo Blankenship , by far the best kicker in the ncaa. And he plays for my favorite team. Go dawgs!!
Keep god first not football
Troydan was there
White guys need SOMETHING to do in the game
1:27 gives me Blair Walsh flashbacks, so so terrible...
i am a bears fan
Love the Herschel walker nfl vids
Seat geek is trash
Stop talking shit on my bro rodrigo
What about Robbie Gould's kick in a driving wind that ended up being way, way wide?
It's all a head game with kickers. They have the skill strength and talent. If they aren't there mentally they are nothing
Do a 100th video specia
"5:11 I don't need to imagine...




I am one."
Not-so-ramdom SeatGeek guy.
Haven't seen the Alabama crimson Tides kickers you could make a full video of that
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen on YouTube. Extremely informative, entertaining, and eye-opening. Great content!
Where is rodrigo Blankenship‚Äôs field goal where he passed the ball, ran back and made it
"You should do

The most forgotten receiver in college football,
Devin Smith"
Brown's auck
Small victories browns fans..very..very small
every player has an off day games will never be perfect kickers qb's rb's recievers will have of days. The fans are the ones that make things worse for the players. fans are by far nowhere near perfect so why should they expect athletes to be perfect.
Okay, I know browns have had some bad field goals lately, BUT FUCKING LOOK AT THE VIKINGS KICKERS. We have way more of a history of shitty shitty kicks.
It‚Äôs cool u like the browns no bandwagon here
ahem, Hot-Rod is NOT weird. He is kicking goat
I am a bears fan. This truly tics me off.
As a kicker myself, I‚Äôve missed a game winner once and that was 7 weeks ago but since, nuh uh
What's with the Browns & Ravens always ending their games in kickoffs?
"Great video but...
Fuck the browns."
Urinatingtree anybody?
What about Doug flutie‚Äôs drop kick Field goal
You should do a vid about that Brad banks iowa team that got crushed by USC in the orange bowl. A few hall of famers on that team
How are you not going to mention Justin Tucker
Steven haushaka is the best kicker in the NFL hands down
What about the kicker who kicked a game winning field goal with one foot.
I laughed so hard when  you said kickers on cocaine
I'm born and raised in Buffalo ny and been a life long bills fan Scott Norwood
Shameless advertising at the beginning. Times were better before everyone resorted to this.
Rondrigo blancinchip aka hot rod
For real though the browns need to trade their kicker
I love your vids keep it up
You gonna talk about kickers and not even mention Tucker?
Did I Just See Bengals trash üò¢ Cmon man Atleast They're Better Than The Browns....Oh Sorry.....
Stop sucking your own dick
Browns need a new kicker!
Is that the training facility that got BTFO'd in a wind storm?
"Pure gold as always.  

I have a suggestion for a future video:  The History of the NFL Bye Week.  There's surprisingly a lot of material there to mine.  I think you'd do a great job telling it."
So, I'm a CFL fan. There's this kicker in my favourite team... He kicked 44 consecutive field goals this season, and counting. He's 5'7. I mean... 44 CONSECUTIVE field goals! He's a rookie.
You forgot about player you know the one in th thumbnail
Go Browns! :D
How tf you hook that bad
"Kickers on cocaine"
Do a video on Marcus Lattimore!
There are still a few barefoot kickers left these days :)

Why was Herschel Walker I‚Äôm here again?
You really need to get a button to skip the seer geek ads
Dislike the video if you remember the last time the buffalo bills were relevant..like if u forget about them alot
Why‚Äôd u put Blankenship in the thumbnail. DO NOT @ my man man Rodrigo blakenship
I saw mmg
Hell yeah brother I‚Äôd love to meet you at a Browns game!!!!
Oh wasant troydan there
lets go browns and bengals
Little did they know about mmg
Five points Vids is old a fuuuuuuuck
I feel so bad for that browns kicker
what do you mean brother the Bengals are legends WHO DEY
I'm a browns fan to
Tell the kicker thing to the chargers
Remember the Chiefs vs Broncos two years ago? Crazy TD to Tyreek Hill as regulation ran out, went to OT, came down to a FG bouncing off the left post barely sneaking in behind the right post for the win? Crazy.
One more tik Tom ad and I‚Äôm ending my life
5:15 imagine being a bears fan I am one that hurt watching that
Go Browns
5:13 I don‚Äôt have to imagine. I‚Äôm already a Bears fan.
In Dawson We Trust!!
Im a cowboys fan
I will forever remember watching that Phil Dawson game tying field goal with my dad and being overly emotional that it saved the game.
You didn't add the clip where will hill III ran one back for a game winner off a blocked field goal :) #Ravens Nation
As a Vikings fan this hurts
I am a bears fan
Come on man. I'm a Ravens fan that loves your channel. U CAN'T END THE VIDEO LIKE THIS
my 8 year old son can make a 20 yard field goal!
What about Janikowski the 270 lb kicker
Can you do a video on Quinton Flowers
MMG was at that game too Lions vs Cowboys
man i miss phil dawson
As a Vikings fan, this triggers me
how does seat gear make money?
feels bad good luck in the NFL
Mason Crosby missing 5
Are u even from cleaveland or are u just a bandwagon fan??
4:16 WAS the all time leading scorer.... GO VINI
Ray Lewis is a murderer
It great to be a Packers fan 5:30
Did you see mmg?
Brown's doo doo
Justin Tucker. he is goo.
Don't talk about the Gary Anderson thing
Zane was injured though... I feel bad for him. His career is over because his coaches made him play through an injury
Zane gonzalez is from the blair walsh school
7:10 this is why I hate being a Vikings fan we only miss the most important field goals
Zane Gonzalez breaks my heart, as an asu fan I love the guy, and he was the most reliable kicker I‚Äôve ever seen, I‚Äôm so confused
But i mean hey the ravens have 2 super bowls
Fck da Brown's
He says bengals trash what team does he like again cough cough Browns
You just need to look for the biggest, drunkest Polak you can find
2:32 and third place was Younghoe Koo - another disaster in the NFL
üëç
I feel you man, we have had trouble punting this season but I think that we have our guy in Greg
"Thats harsh for me when ypu said just imagine being a bears fan well for u i am 




There pretty bad"
First youtuber I have heard of that likes the browns too
Dude you sat in the same suite as me but I sat there during the Oklahoma tcu big 12 championship
Browns are trash
I love bro, but you can't be calling people randoms 0:15 when they get more subs and views than you.
KTO KEEP UP THE GREAT VIDEOS ; highly entertaining
What is the name of the song that starts at 9:00
Yo who else is a browns fan
im also a brown fan and sometimes its hard to watch a team that does good at the begging and at the end just lose from bad calls and the ref making bad calls losing us the game and missing easy field goals and if you are a browns fan like this comment
"I saw that Bengals trash mister ...







And I totally agree"
Hot rod is insane
Did u meet mmg
329,451st view
I wish I would knew that you  were in the dfw would of loved meeting you plus could of showed around the area
I am a browns fan to
I miss Phil Dawson every day
Hot rod!
Goggles best college kicker
The dude at the beginning is for no raps if didn't know now you know so go check him out
Hot Rod is a beast
did my boy say left crossbar 8:39
Go browns
Who was QB in the game they played?
did you meet mmg in dallas?
Don‚Äôt be talking crap about the bengals boy they are the next best thing üòÇüòÇ
make a video on tyreek hill pressing charges on the patriots fan who threw beer on him
The only reason that that guy is older than some of his teammates only because he is a kicker and u have less of a chance to get hurt
KTO pumping these videos out so quickly makes me wet
Hot Rod!
Benga‚Äôs are not trash
This brings back bad memoriesüò¢
I'm a vikes fan and Carlson sucks
9:21 song please
Who is that dude at 5:04
I actually like kickers and punters they are so underated
Great video KTO!
Ghram Gano is the best kicker. Go Panthers!
Fun fact at 5:34 the kick was under the influence of cocaine it says in his book alive and kicking which i have meet him
The kicker on coke is hilarious that shit gives you super human powers
not only is it bad for the chargers. but imagine being a vikings fan. your team has lost or tied 50-100 games because of their kicker.
where mmg
You trash b*tch
I've been curious of the course of a long time about Kickers (Put , Holders nd Snappers) ... I appreciate the small insight about The Kicker.
Bengals is lit wtf are u talking about
adam is on my favrit team rite now the colts
Bears had a kicking identity with Gould. Now there is just a hole at kicker. :(
Good video as a Bengals can I don't appreciate that jab lol.
The bears are back
What you saying about the bengals
You should talk about janikowski
2:28 and there‚Äôs Younghoe Koo on the far left
I‚Äôm a browns fan too!
I am a punter and this vid is great
Dont worry KTO im a browns fan too, i was upset.
"Here is what I think the NFL will be like in 10 years:


Read more"
My grandpa was the kicker/punter for the Lombardi packers. He won two world champs and super bowl 1-2. All of his friends would talk about how important he was to the team and I really idolized him. Sadly though he passed away a couple of years ago. RIP Don Chandler
Can't believe I don't remember Vinatierri running down Herschel Walker!!!  That is IMPRESSIVE!!!
You should do a video talking about the Bengals and Browns gunslinging game in 2007 week 2
"KTO: 
""Watch this next scene and imagine being a bears fan""

Me:
""fuck..."""
Blair Walsh is the most hated guy over here in Seattle (we lost so many games because of him.)
I thought ncaa football games were the only place to get crazy name mashups like lebron o‚Äômalley, then UGA signed rodrigo Blankenship.
what is KTO!>!
we need vinateri
The game during the saints Gonzalez was playing on a Groin injury
I am a browns fan and I was at that browns V Saints game and it was truly sickening because of Zane Gonzalez
As a Vikings fan I knew Gary Anderson was going to come up
You started to play that blocked field goal video and I immediately got upset. I was at that game and had never seen so many angry browns fans including myself.
Hey I‚Äôm a big auburn fan, and I‚Äôm also a big Vikings fan so it was really sad to see Daniel cut. I wish the would have given him a second chance.
KTO putting the ‚ÄúBrowns‚Äù logo over his Cowboys shirt is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all morning
He had a torn groin
"Wanna hear something sad?




Alabama can't get a good kicker."
GO BROWNS
Lucky you got to go to a cowboys game I am a big cowboys fan
Of course it was Pete Morelli officiating that Browns game at the end. He seems to always be officiating when weird things happen. He also just so happens to be the President of a private high school in the city I live in üòÇ
Remember Sebastian Janikowski was drafted in the 1st round
the ending to this video was perfect
Hope Hot Rod will be good in the NFL.
Also great vid forsure sub and notifications
Almost any kicker can hit field goals in practice. Where they earn the paycheck is when the pressure is on can they still make those kicks.
How can you have a list like this and not include Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints. Guy didn‚Äôt have toes in his kicking foot and set a field goal distance record that lasted for more than a decade.
remember when the browns went 0-16?
I didn't know five points looked that old, damn
As a Browns fan I MISS PHIL DAWSON
Morten Anderson doe sent have all time Adam venetaire
Was that trip in the beginning of the vid at the Frisco facilities?
"Kickers on Cocaine" Sounds like a movie
That kick by Phil Dawson in Baltimore you featured I was there right behind that field goal believe it or not absolute pandemonium, oh yea me and my brother were wearing Browns jerseys
So a browns fan a bengals fan and a steelers fan. Mustve been a pretty entertaining time
Let‚Äôs go Cleveland !! #DawgPound
Thank god for Matt Bryant
You just had to bring up Gary Anderson and the '98 Vikings. Twenty freaking years ago, and it still hurts like it just happened :(
Didn't the Jets have to use a kicker as a QB in a game if I remember correctly he actually had a decent game
0:15 I think that was Mopi
Ok is this a video about kickers or a dig on Vikings fans?
Poor fivepointvids. Stuck with the kids lol. Love all y'all content.
I can‚Äôt believe we lost that gameüò¢üò≠
"Nobody gives a shit about the kicker until they start missing.

Dope channel, my friend. I really enjoy your videos and especially the song at the end when you top  off the video."
Always love your endings in your videos
Holy shit dude!... You are ridiculous with all these Browns videos. And you throw the ball like a fairy.
"I had to pause at 7:00 and skip ahead
It hurt too much"
ROBBIE GOULD IS THE BEST KICKER IN THE NFL!
Wowwwww. I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have watched this video. Even tho I kinda was annoyed at how much of a Browns homer you are, I still would watch your videos bc I respected your knowledge of the game. But after seeing you on the field and throwing a ball, I can‚Äôt watch anymore. You‚Äôre an embarrassment.
It's not an easy thing to do to make 95% of your kicks. Just ask Mason Crosby.
Who's that Browns kicker with the mustache and the single bar face mask
I also just met Brian Hansen! He came to my church to talk to us lol
I went to the same highschool as Adam vinateri my freshman year
You didn‚Äôt talk about Justin Tucker wtf?
As a Ravens fan I totally remember all those kicks mentioned at the end.
As a chargers fan, i feel the same way last season.
Dang get off flemlo raps man.
Blankenship was on my middle school football team
"Aye my boiiii Younghoe Koo,



WTF MANNN!"
what year was that dawson kick?
"i love being a browns fan 
even through all the rough stuff i still love it"
thank god for harrison butt kicker
Browns shoulda started 5-0
Did you meet mmg there!?!?!?
Once again, another quality video. I really love how you look back to my favorite era of NFL football (80's-90's). I appreciate the hell outta that man, keep em' coming.
Lol this video was a waste of time.. disliked
What I want to know is how all these good kickers are missing this year.
Alabama has the most consistently garbage ass , always suck ,game losing kickers ever.....
Go Browns
gonzales... man did i feel bad for that guy. #SaintsFan
What song is used at the end of the video?
don‚Äôt say nothing about kickers until your a vikings fanüòî
Kickers are people too
For that Best Kicker award in college, should‚Äôve been Drew Brown from Nebraska all the way, the Brown family are kicking legends at Nebraska and 3 out of 4 brothers made it to the NFL
Same event as Mmg?
Please do a vid about Davante Adams
Think vinatieri broke the all time scoring record
my boy flemlo rapsüíØüî•
Fire Amos Jones. No idea why we even picked him up in the first place. Cardinals ST was atrocious with him and now then we pick him up. Kickoff coverage and returns are absolute garbage, and why is Jabrill Peppers returning kicks and risking injury?
#ForTheBrand
theres was a kid at my highschool,(he plays for ut now) who could kick better then about 60% of the other people in the nfl his last names dicker and i wouldn‚Äôt be suprised to see him start in the nfl
Hanging out with the salty yinzer must have been a lot of fun.
#fucknatekaeding
Did u see mmg
What if if KTO pronounced 'field' correctly?
I would love to play career mode with a Kicker on madden
As a kicker I find this offensive... but true. I honestly can‚Äôt explain why sometimes I‚Äôm on and sometimes I‚Äôm off
Blankenship for the dawgs is good very good
Why making my team look bad aka ravens
KTO, man... I MISS old man Phil Dawson. I‚Äôd trade a 4th rounder to Arizona RIGHT NOW if they would take the deal. He was Mr. Consistent FOREVER for us. I miss him and Josh Cribbs. Wish we had them and Joe Thomas back, then we would be really cooking because Baker wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about his 6 EVER. He could rest easy knowing 9.9 times out of 10, Joe Thomas is gonna take care of business and clean up that pesky pass rush because playing Thomas in pass protection was like getting locked by Deion on the outside. Ain‚Äôt no one gonna hear from you that week.
I just discovered a football league called the AAF (alliance of American Football), it's set to have its inaugural season 1 week after this coming super bowl.... wondering if you could make a video on it
Chester Marcol is a badass
4:35 nasty ass mothafuckas
When the browns won that game against baltimore i was so upset because im a ravens fan
I hate kickers and punters!
It‚Äôs hard being a titans fan, our kicker was Mr. Irrelevant
i have to say this as a vikings fan f*ck carlson
How about Tom Tupa coming in at QB for the Jets? Or Danny White and Sammy Baugh and Bobby Lane and George Blanda bring QBs who kicked?
Herschel walker went to Georia
Rodrigo Blankenship is not a ‚Äúhot rod‚Äô‚Äô
I was at that ravens browns game with the crossbar kick. I fucking hated that game.
Mason Crosby against the Lions though
Pretty neat that they call that extension the Dawson Bar now!
"Browns
1st quarter 7-7
2nd quarter 21-21
3rd quarter 35-28
4th quarter 42-42
Overtime browns win by a field goal once again"
You know, I've never got nfl kickers. I've know kids on my soccer team that's been able to kick 50 yarders in middle school (i could kick a 40 easily in 8th grade) And yet that's a hard kick in the nfl. Just a thought.
BoomSports is a Browns fan.
And I‚Äôm a kicker
Go pack go
I am a bears fan
I'm a kicker Gonzalez is an embarrassment to the browns as a kicker
Mmg was there too right
"3:03 
FAST AS FCK BOI"
im a bears fan AND TRUBISKY ISNT A BUST!!
GO COWBOYS
2:29 Is that Younghoe Koo? All these guys NFL careers are done after a handful of games.
Being a kicker has to be the most stressful position in football üòÇ knowing that the fate of the game relies on your foot and any false move you make can mean all the difference on you having a job the next day!
I never knew Vinatieri ran Walker down.
"Hey bud, I'm a Ravens fan.

At least your kicker won ya that one!!!! 

Man that hurt. Watched it with my girls family of browns fans."
I appreciate Graham Gano more now
I‚Äôm a chiefs fan, by far Harrison Butker was a steal. Hasn‚Äôt missed a kick and made 90% last year. He is right now the most accurate kicker in NFL history with a total percentage of 92%. I‚Äôve seen him kick in person (I‚Äôm a kicker). He is very consistent
Dude the bengals not trash, Marvin Lewis is
My man I man panthers fan but I‚Äôm also cheering for the browns üëçüèª
#BringBackPhil
You left out mmg
fuck Dallas Fly Eagles Fly
That overtime kick against the Ravens was totally blocked. Look at it. It‚Äôs got topspin. Also, mentioning Gary Anderson‚Äôs miss but not the River City Relay?
GOO DAWGS
Dang dawg you were throwing dots out their
Nice video dude.
Cleveland Would Be 3-1 right now, I‚Äôm from Cleveland, shit hurt, and I wanted Tyrod To look good, kicks effected that
Im so mad from that lose againts the cowboys right after the big game
can you do if peyton remained a colt
Browns r doing pretty decent this year
Browns need my boy Pat Murray back he is a freak. Unlucky with injuries but bring back the the Monaghan Monster
"Just an idea, go back to doing some what ifs like some of your old videos. Some ideas:
What if the colts drafted Ryan leaf
What if rg3 didn‚Äôt get injured 
What if the Texans actually had a quarterback (before Watson Texans fan here)
Just an idea"
"5:12 I am a Bears fan and honestly that hurt just to watch.
STUPID PACKERS!!!!!!"
@4:36 them feet were unnatural.
As a saints fan. My wife thought I was watching a comedy during week 2
Man I am a Vikings fan and that was hard to watch
my dad is friends with phil dawson
Coked out kicker outruns entire defense :-))
Who else likes that song Morten Andersen made?
When you actually are a bears fan and had to watch that dreaded play again :/
How the fuck does the browns kicker still have a job let alone make any money?
Wassup flemloraps
HOTROD! GO DAWGS!!!
Hey walker is from my Georiga dawgs!!
Hey browns draft Rodrigo Blankenship
I going to the browns vs the falcons
But I am a steelers fan
They are ok
South Dakota State represent
If anyone watches or watched Blue Mountain State, this reminds me of Harmon lmao
Congrats on being decent this yeer
Kickers being bad at kicking is one of the things I will never understand. I mean the only thing you have to practice is kicking the ball from various distances.
Go Browns Clevelander for life new kicker
Go go Vikings I feel bad for Daniel Charalson
Harrison Butker is the best in the league.
A few years ago it seemed like a field goal miss was rare, now it‚Äôs considered clutch to kick a 50+ yard field goal.
Dont think I didnt notice how you but the browns logo over that outfit
I live in South Dakota the jack rabbits
Rodrigo is winning the heisman
Urinating tree face reveal
Seahawks have both advanced in the playoffs and been eliminated from reaching the playoffs because of Blair Walsh misses.
It still kills me how old fivepointvids actually is üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Last one was epic
Derek Anderson to the bills king? Whatthe no way, he wull prolly get the start! üò≥üëÅüòçüòÇüòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Do one on Punters
Please make a video of how gruden ruined the raiders
I can kick a field goal backwards I'm trying out now.
quit speeing up that footage to make it seem like he's running faster
"DAMN

1999 nfc championship game

Yeah

DAMN"
You forgot about kickers who injure themselves while celebrating!
"my flag football team is currently 0-7
1 like = 1 prayer"
"i only like a few kickers:  The Raiders Kicker, Paul Edinger (Bears former kicker), George Blanda, and Robbie Gould.
I'm biased for the bears."
Did you see MMG
I know how you feel about the Browns and kickers KTO. I am a Vikings fan Gary Anderson and Blair Walsh make me question why we go for field goals. #bringbackdropkicks!
Cool to see Flemlo again
good lord the browns have the worst kicker ever. get rid of that fucking flop after the second game and get someone better. At least the Raiders' Kicker is a legend.
Respect the specs
"ZANE GONZALEEEEZ!!!
I would rather eat a bowl of nails w/out any milk for breakfast than have you as my kicker. PUT YOUR MUTHAFLIPPIN‚Äô HEAD DOWN!!!!"
In a way, i feel slightly glad that many kickers have bad games recently because i think one of the main reason kickers are underappreciated is bcos ppl expect them to make all fg and pat so with what happen recently, fans will appreciate good consistent kicker more than ever
I miss dawson
born and raised a Browns fan. Dawson kicking in field goals during a blizzard is a thing of beauty.
Kickers are amazing. It just funny when they miss a close kick.
I miss Joey Julius.
Life long eagles fan and as much as I love Jake Elliott, I love and miss David Akers.
Well of course you and flemo dominated both of y‚Äôall use to be good athletes
How do you miss 4 kicks straight
Y
T
Maybe Zane Gonzales and Daniel Carlson just needed some of that Chester Marcol booger sugar
Dude, you‚Äôve been killing it lately. Truly awesome and original content. Keep up the good work!
I love being a kicker
We Broncos fans love Gary Anderson for missing that field goal. Cause instead of Minnesota, who would have disemboweled Denver, we got an easy repeat against Atlanta.
Flemlo!!
the referee at the end used to me my dean at st. marys high school
A team can‚Äôt win if they have no leg to stand on. üò∂
So how come on an onside kick, if the kicking team gets the ball it's there possession, but on a regular kickoff, if the kicking team recovers the ball, it's considered down and the other team gains possession
Does cocaine count as a PED? Asking for a friend...
As a browns fan like you, I understand the troubles and I know that we have gone through a hard struggle, but this year and next year we have a future
What about tom dempsey
As a Titans fan, I can definitely vouch for the value of kickers. We've had some good ones over the years (Del Greco, G. Anderson, Bironas, even Succop isn't too bad), and lord have we needed them. We've had some winning seasons where they were our leading scorers, by a pretty wide margin.
As a falcons fan i appreciated the 1998 nfc championship game
Better than Peterman
"Imagine being a Bears fan" I am a Bears fan;(
Punters are people too
Everyone makes fun of kickers until they win you the game
0:50 OH HELL NAH BENGALS ALWAYS BEAT THE BROWNS WHODEY FOR LIFE BRUH
Papa MMG was there i‚Äôm pretty sure
Kickers usually end up being the leading scorer for their team. I have this feeling that kickers will some day be as sought after as running backs, maybe second only to QBs. And we'll see more draft coverage of kickers and they'll be bigger stars in the league.
I Browns fan
Herschel walker is also an extreme trump supporter
I might jinx him but Eddy Pineiro might be the new Adam Vinatieri. All Gator fans loved eddy when he was at Florida because he was the only one we could rely on for points the past few years.
God I miss Phil Dawson on the Browns
1:57 all around me are familiar faces
KTO you are truly one of a kind XD. You make better content then real NFL reporters.
Daniel Carlson ... smh.. Us Auburn fans back here were watching you with such high Hope's brother. I picked you up in  all 3 of my fantasy teams.
BUFFALO VS  NY GIANTS  - wide right
Kickers are usually the most important piece in a team. They can make or break you. Ask Peyton Manning or even Tom Brady. If your kicker can‚Äôt convert the extra point or kick from 40-55 then you‚Äôre going to lose 3-4 games. Some games are decided by 3 or less points. Invest in kickers.
"""Why are there not 32 competent kickers in the league?""
Game theory: if the kickers become better, the coaches will demand longer field goals - which in turn lowers the success%.
In other words, about 16 of the 32 NFL kickers are by default below average."
Urinating tree revealed
You know you're a Brownsfan: when winning 2 games becomes "some games".
Wow that was a crazy ending, I've never seen that type of scenario before!!!
If he did coke at halftime theres no way in hell he was still feeling it in overtime. Even coke from the 80's didn't last that long.
@4:10 those shorts bro...
Herschel Walker is still a badass. 56 years old and he does MMA now. Dude still looks like hes 30.
Top 10 scorners in NFL history? Kickers.
Bengals trash lmao
Gonzalez tore his groin in the saints game and had to play through it
im a Bengals Ravens Cowboys and Titans fan
Don‚Äôt forget Kyle Bambard, the NC State kicker who missed like 4 field goals and an extra point against Clemson, if he made just one they wouldn‚Äôt beat them... Clemson goes on to be national champs
Bengals are not trash
0:48 oh hell no
9:15 I did that in madden
Go Browns but I‚Äôm a packer fan
Bro if I could hang out with KTO and Urinating Tree it would already be awesome
Great vid
The you should know the answer for when the stupidity of Hue Jackson will be fired from Cleveland
Hi
Hi
Hi
I was so upset when Carlson missed those kicks
Bangel trash? That was harsh man! His content is great he happens to like a team that cant win in the playoffs so what!
Zane gonzales is the least talented human on this planet.
Imagine Being A Steelers Fan Right Now Just Waiting For BOSWELL To Get It Together. Yes BOSWELL
the only reason i watched this is bc hot rod was in the thumbnail
Alabama needs to find a fucking kicker üò†
Jan Steneruud deserves a mention...
Please i made 3 bets for 5 10 and 5 please go to the playoffs browns!!
Not as weird as Hockey Goalies man
The browns need rod
too much kicker duds this year
S/o to Phil Dawson, longtime Browns MVP
Dude you deserve the trip. Hope you had a blast. Keep making great vids.
Lmao intro video seems like dilfer and elielitr. Camp drills
The patriots had a terrible kicker in about 1985
This video never answered one very important question--who's the Browns guy with the 1-bar and the awesome mustache?  The dude looks like a 60 year old biker.
My favorite kick as a Chiefs fan was Santos' donk heard round the world.
Morten Andersen is the only player from my country to play in NFL
5:10 I AM a Bears fan damnit!
Ya know what's crazy? Adam Vinateri's nephew is also a kicker at SDSU, and is getting NFL buzz. Adam has been kicking longer than the kid has been alive. Man the dude is old
üòÇüòÇ when he said he snorted cocaine @ Halftime I died lmao boy was high running that TD üíÄ
Great video boss I usually go by ur stats and assume they right I wish I could be in shit like this
come here after watching Mason Crosby got redeemed and made game winning field goal for Green Bay
Zane Gonzales would piss me off even if I was cheering for the Saints in that game
Kto just drop kicked a field goal from about 65 with this video.
So that‚Äôs what urinating tree looks like
I‚Äôm a 49ers fan. Just lost tonight due to Crosby‚Äôs redemption. I would‚Äôve loved if he continued having a bad season. Ugh. Gotta tell you though, this is the greatest video anyone ever has made about NFL kickers.
We had Chester Marcol as a school speaker
The Vikings will never win a Super Bowl because their kickers can never hit a clutch fg to win or tie or to give them a bigger lead
Your videos are my fav I hope one day you run ESPN or SB Nation or bleacher report or make enough to buy them out KTO
Vinatieri broke the record
Flemlo looks like Cole from Martin
Scott playyyyyer
Best outro in all of YouTube
Go Brownies
Did you see MMG?
Did you have to show the Gary Anderson miss
Honestly it might be just the fact that some kickers are mentally strong and some are not. Once you get to the pros they have it in the back of their mind that now I‚Äôm getting paid for this if I don‚Äôt perform I‚Äôm out of a job. Which might cause shaky knees and missed field goals
Notice Younghoe Koo 2:30, he was third place and was cut for missing clutch field goals.
Great vid! I'd like to see your take on something involving the Packers
Go Browns!
My boy gano hit a 63 yarder
Whos the #5 holder for the browns?
CHESTER MARSHALL, CHESTER MARSHALL LMAO!!! WOW
Flex on!
Vinnie won me my fantasy last week lol
Kickers are people too
Imagine being the high kicker. "Oh, shit! I've caught the ball."
As a cowboys fan watching Dan Bailey get cut was hard but Brett Maher is looking to be a great kicker who was undrafted and was picked up from the CFL.
I met Adam Vinateri at my elementary school in a tiny town called Northbridge Massachusetts. I was in 5th grade and I am 31 years old. All I remember is a a kid asking him a question about Vincent Brown an old linebacker and him giving an answer like" I don't know I think he was getting ready to retire before I got here." We all got signed cards of his. Imagine how crazy it is that our class got to meet him when he first got to New England. He seemed like an extremely humble guy and looked nothing like a football player in my memory of him BTW
U will never as good As any of the members of 2hype Humphrey has more clout than youüòÇ
Why you got hurt me like that KTO
Wanna talk kickers KTO? One name...SEBASTIAN JANIKOWSKI! Nice vid bud, Go Stillers!
I seem to remember one of Dawson's field goals at the end of a game bouncing off the top of an upright and there was a long review to determine whether it was good or not.  Maybe around 2004-05? Anyone remember that?
Cocaine is a helluva drug
such good content bro
If you don‚Äôt think us vikings fans have some sort of curse you‚Äôre wrong. Gary Anderson then Blair Walsh fucks it for us then that new fuckhead loses some games for us, it‚Äôs tough
No love for Tom Dempsey? the half foot kicker with a shoe filled with steel so he could kick farther?
missed opportunity to not show garo yepremian in the super bowl
Honestly what happened to kickers it used to feel like they almost never missed and now so many miss all the time I mean look at the pats kicker he was famous for not missing and now he misses a lot
Zaaaaaaane Gonzalez!!!!!!! I would rather ride with a blind Asian woman than have u as my kicker!!!!
Ayyyyye Flemlo
Finally us kickers are recognized
I'm a Vikings fan, why did I click on this video... :(
Zane Gonzalez, Daniel Carlson, Blair Walsh, Conner Barth, NICK FOLK!! PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN' HEADS BACK DOWN!!
2HYPE GANG
Put respect on Goggles name
Wow anybody else surprised about what urinating tree looks like??!!
Vinatieri... Greatest kicker of all time
"Mans said bengals suck and the says he is a browns fan lol 


Great vid btw"
That throwing form tho
Thoughts on Tyrod?
Phil Dawson, Hook 'em.
Thought he would talk bout crosby
While I always respected what the more known positions in football can do (QB, RB, WR, LB, so on), I always respected the kickers and punters as well. If I tried, the farthest I could kick a ball is 30 yards. Most can kick from 50 with great accuracy, which is a pretty amazing skill.
No wonder why mmg acts like a absolute dumbassüòÇ
Matt prater the goat
"Different position but punting as I‚Äôm sure most know used to be the secondary function of quarterbacks and no one did it better than Sammy Baugh. 
Httr"
I was at the chargers buccaneers game in 2016 and that was a shit show. Lambo vs Aguayo. Who could miss more kicks?
Jon Ryan TD was crazy
How do you beat the Bears? COCAINE BITCH! LOL
Crackheadspeedüí®
And no mention of the recent and crazy Arizona-Seattle showdowns that feature ultra bizarre kicking moments
Here after Mason Crosby just hit the game winner a week after having the worst performance of his career.
Who is the asian at 2:39?
Remember watching that Dawson one live. One of the craziest moments ive seen.
I live in Cleveland it is about damn time
I saw hot rod so I clicked
Anytime that song with the siren u know something crazy about to happen.
I wish I had the skill and "cool as ice" nature to be an NFL kicker, could you imagine doing basically nothing the whole game and then 3 seconds left you're called in to win the game?
KTO why did you have to mention Gary Anderson? :'(
Man this video seems even more relevant now after Crosbys shit game last week and redemption this week
SOUTH DAKOTA BABYYYYYYYYYY
As a vikings fan watching that pains me
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
What‚Äôs the Outro song ?
‚ÄúKickers on kocaine‚Äù
Fun one I think of as a chiefs fan is Santos game winner against Denver 2 years ago on Sunday night
I got a kick out of watching this video.... (Except for the ad plug)
Mmg ahhh did u see him kto
4:35 LOOK HOW LONG THOSE FEET ARE
Yes, yes they are
How do you make a video on kicker and not mention Justin tucker
:48 "bengals trash" edit had me rolling @KTO
2:30 peep younghoe koo
Keep up the good ass videos
Our kicker in highschool literally never came to practice, smoked weed constantly. Dropped 50 yrd fgs in his sleep though. So yeah. That was nice
BRAVO!
Great video
Mark moseley wasnt a kicker he was a football player that kicked, when he was in college he played qb and linebacker as well as handling kicking, and he was the redskins scout team qb, that man was a football player
Zane Gonzalez is the new blayer Walsh
And after what Mason Crosby just did
Whos the really old browns kicker? the one with the white mustache at 5:02
Bring back straight-on kickers, and drop kicks and things will get interesting
Jesus what is with the Vikings and kickers
2:32 laclan on the left
I saw MMG‚Äôs video of the Seatgeek trip but didn‚Äôt see you in the video. I love both of you. I just wondered if you guys met.
Where's Garo Yepremian?
KTO with another banger
You have no idea how many high school games I lost on one field goal alone.
Coming from Akron Ohio .... it‚Äôs tough not having Phil Dawson when the browns really need him
Kickers are underrated. For example they can end up being your most consistent scorer in fantasy lol
"B e n g a l s
T r a s h"
I‚Äôm a Viking fan and we have always struggled with finding kickers
Calling it Crosby misses
I‚Äôm a kicker, and it‚Äôs not as easy as it seems tbh... it‚Äôs actually really hard
Way to end  a Monday A kto video perfect üò¥
Phil Dawson better get into the Hall of fame
I watch flemlo too
Finkle!!!!
Kickers finna get PAID watch...at least the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones
Feel so bad for that saints kicker (can't remember his name but was one of best in history as 3rd leading scorer in nfl )that missed the pat after the crazy and only successful lateral TD as time expired losing the game wich knocked them out of playoffs surprising he wasnt mentioned in this video
Where is mmg?
Only the browns lol
Phil Dawson was a goat
What about the Jets punter that played QB?
No mention of mason Crosby
As a baseball player I dont play football but I kick to get a chance to play(without injury)
Mason crosby missed 4 straight in a game against the lions was hard to watch
Needed to put the panthers 63 yard field goal in
FlemLo crushing that food üòÇüòÇ
Justin Tucker the goat
I‚Äôm a die hard raiders fan but I‚Äôve always had some love for the Browns
The field goal to beat ravens this year was the most Cleveland like field goal ever
Adam has the most points now for a kicker or all time. He did it couple weeks ago
FLR, UT, 5PV and KTO playing flag footbal?! I would've killed to be there
All Day üòÖ
Dude you probably could make calculus interesting
I remember watching that field goal at the end live. At the time field goals were not something that could be video reviewed (which is why the ref said "after further discussion"), which they fixed in the following offseason.
My boi flem
Lol phil dawson a god
That shit hurt. Browns should be 4-1.
"Question. I dont know this might br stupid. Is it Mandatory for the kicker to have like those steps back to kick the football? Or can you stand closer to the holder and do it?
Been watching football but I dont know this."
You forgot the half foot kicker. Mr Tom Dempsey
Best video yet.....haha
That mike Nugent kick vs the Seahawks was crazy
Kickers are one of a kind but KTO is one of a kind youtuber
I respect you kto being a browns fan takes a lot but don‚Äôt worry the Cardiac kids are upüí™üèæüí™üèæüí™üèæ
Highly underrated Channel you just earned a sub
Dude that‚Äôs sick that you got all that
"This video is a work of art! What a great topic to talk about. It seems almost taboo to even bring up because you NEVER hear about it on national tv. 

Amazing video bro! This was a lot of fun to watch as a fan!"
papa meags
That packers play just ruined my night
as a fellow Browns fan, GOD BLESS PHIL DAWSON. holy trinity of post ‚Äò99 Browns: Joe Thomas, Josh Cribbs, Phil Dawson. Phil won us games on multiple occasions
Flemlo with the Bengals jersey lol
ALL DAY
You deserve waaaaaay more subs
GO BROWNS!!!!
Do a video on Lyle alzado
KTO I was just rewatching Joe Thomas‚Äôs retirement speech and he talked about that Dawson kick. He said he thinks it‚Äôs the only time the browns won in that stadium while he was playing for themüòÇ
Yes one of my favorite youtubers is in the lefty gang
0:08 I think this is urinating tree‚Äôs face reveal?
What's your outro song
Imagine being a Chargers fan. We‚Äôve missed playoffs and lost multiple playoff games including the AFC championship because of missed kicks. I would be willing to trade 2 first rounders for a consistent kicker at this point.
"Varsity football practice got me so tired 
Im a right guard"
While my broncos have really SUCKED the past few years... at least we have a solid kicker in Mcmanus. If we need a game winner we can trust him
Not enough guys named Chester anymore.
"You should do a video on Pete Gogolak: The kicker who changed EVERYTHING.

You should also do one on Ray Guy: The only Punter in the Hall of Fame."
zane gonzalez thought it was soccer
How likely do you think that Daniel Carlson gets signed by another team
I honestly think kto is hilarious but i dont like how we said tht bengals were trash
Yes Vikings fans did feel that same wayüò≠üò≠üò≠Minnesota boy here
Damn KTO is SLINGING that pill
Flemlo raps anyone
Matt Bryant needs some love tho
I‚Äôm glad somebody knows who Rodrigo Blankenship isüòÇ Great video KTO you never fail to keep me entertained.
Great video. I had no idea a kicker has been MVP
"I know your not a hockey channel... but goalies are the same way! Truly one of a kind and some very weird! 

Your Chanel is amazing, excellent editing, superb narrating & top notch content."
Please do a video on fotu leiato aka ‚Äúthe huddle legend‚Äù (his huddle highlight tape had over 1 million views.
My main question is why woman don‚Äôt play in the NFL
Hey just FYI Zane had a groin injury and never should‚Äôve been out there kicking in the first place, and I‚Äôm a browns fan because of him, he went to ASU the college I follow.
You've done it again! Great content!
Can‚Äôt relate.
:51 are u mad were better than u
Yo mmg was there
aye papa was there
Special teams like special ed.
I heard Hershel Walker in a video about kickers and knew what was about to go down. The fastest man alive was going to make an appearance.
KTO is beast he make the best vids!!!
Go Georgia Bulldawgs!!!!!
I feel you too my dude. I‚Äôm a browns fan too.
Why did you stop showing your face?
How u make a video about kickers but not mention the goat Blair Walsh?
Go over the top ten players in 2009 nfl draft like you did with the 2006 nfl draft
I‚Äôm a ravens fan so that last part hirt
Never talk about Zane Gonzalez again please. He went to my high school and I love him.
Plz fuck right off seat geek
FlemloRaps steals content. Fucking scrub.
Let‚Äôs go seat geek sponsorship
Wasnt MMG there
Lmaoao you would put Georgia's kicker on the thumbnail
Blankenship is wild af much love for that dude
As a ravens fan, im glad we got tucker
I‚Äôm wondering why they cut Ross Martin (kicker who was cut in preseason)
I really miss Phil dawson
Alabama fans know what it feels like being traumatized during special teams
Are we just gonna ignore how long that dude in the middles feet areü§£
Did you see MMG there
Don‚Äôt u dare talk about the goat hot rod
Where is MMG
Please try to upload more I would really like if you would!!
Did you meet mmg
"I kicked in high school and I have to say compared to other field skills it was a bizarre learning curve. As the placekicker and qb3 I had no illusions as to my real role on the team: I helped the meatheads with homework and learning the playbook. The most fun years of my youth.
Great video, mang."
Ktos 'theme music is legendary and perfect for every video
Pet peeve of mine. Gary Anderson did not lose the Vikings the NFC championship, he did not cost them the game. There were over 2 minutes left in the game and the Vikings had a 7 point lead. The Vikings defense chocked and their offense couldn‚Äôt move the ball anymore either. That kick would have made it a 10 point lead making it much more difficult yes, but it‚Äôs not like they were suddenly losing after he missed.
Looks like Gonzales used to kick for Alabama.
7:48 what's the song? It's a BOP af.
It was great to see be a Baller for a Day in a Suite! Good Stuff KTO!
Who is the Browns guy in the thumbnail?
Blankenship is a GOAT
Add me on snap: corymcgee04
What about the 3 college kickers who wore the jersey # 100? (I believe one of them played for WVU and another for Kansas sometime in the 60s)
I feel so bad for Zane Gonzalez.
Karsten = Tom Brady
Go dawgss
Real quick on the coked-out kicker... If he did coke at halftime, and that play was at the end of the game, or anywhere in the 4th quarter even... he was definitely NOT feeling it. Unless he did a completely insane amount. That shit wears off in a half hour tops. Which makes that play even more impressive, since he was more likely crashing.
Great video! I love your channel. Keep up the amazing work üòÄ
Shut up I wear goggles and I‚Äôm started wide receiver so shut up
Was MMG there
0:07 picture of 4 G.O.A.T.s right here. No seriously I'm subbed to all 4 of u guys. Ur amazing and keep up the good work.
I didn't know Hulk Hogan kicked for the Browns
Just jealous of tucker lol
Phil Dawson is my teams kicker now and he‚Äôs not that good
Go dawgs I saw hot rod on thumbnail and couldn‚Äôt help it
Frick you Bengals don't suck
You met Tree and Five Point? Man, if only you could also meet ThatsGoodSports/Brandon Perna, the best sports analyst in the world and a Broncos fan like me. You, Perna, Tree, and Five Point are the GOAT's.
Kickers are people too, except Roberto Aguayo and Blair Walsh we can make fun of them all we want
"Great video, dude.

Seriously though... what's with the Browns and kickers?

Also, Mark Moseley, the only kicker to win the MVP, also kicked for the Browns. He kicked a GW against the Jets in 2OT the 1986 Divisional Round... after missing a chip-shot 27-yarder in OT."
You beat us in OT (coming from a Baltimore Ravens Fan, Go Tucker)
Saw Blankenship... clicked
I remember seeing that Browns kicker and thinking not only is going to be out of a job, but that he was probably getting death threats before he even got on the plane home.
Yes, yes we are weird but we‚Äôre proud of it
Lowkey coulda ended it with the Chris Davis kick return
Mmg
Did u see mmh
ha Roberto Aguayo
What about that dude with the foot problem and the weird boot, Tom Dempsey I wanna say  was his name
As an actual bears fan that clip just made me pissed
I watch urinating tree, flemlo, and 5 point. and of course yours
Blankenship will be the GOAT in 20 years watch
Oh, you think you have kicking problems? #boltup
that last FG you mention was the weirdest thing. As a Ravens fans all I can remember is that pretty much all of Baltimore's players were heading the to the locker room if not already there when the decision came in. So they had to re-dress and get ready for OT. Also no mention of Tucker who is an opera singer, Place Kickers are truly... eccentric hahahaha
Justin tucked and Adam viniteri both went undeafyed
You're not going to talk about success stories like Tucker or Viniteri
Your intros keep getting longer and longer
I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt watch a lot of ur vids, but hearing u are a browns fan ! Oh man I fell Inlove. Subbed
Respect the specks
I just got Blair Walsh flashbacks(Seahawks)
Daniel Carlson won Auburn a whole game with 6 field goals and had about two on the other games each i was really disappointed when the Vikings cut him. His brothers Anders is playing horribly also at Auburn at kicker
You just not going to talk ab the 63 yard kick
Shoudn't kicker and punter be the two easiest positions to translate to the NFL?
Man I would play Madden 2005 and watch the opening video with Jeff Wilkins in it showing off his one white shoe and one black shoe. Kickers are truly one of a kind man. Dope video
You and FlemLo would have lit the field up if you played together in college
New England‚Äôs kicker is beast
My boi Rodrigo ü§ì
Respecthespecs ( Rodrigo Blankenship Georgia kicker )
freaking love this guy
The good ole Dawson bar
Daniel Carlason was probably nervous, it was his first ever game and he had pressure to do good. I‚Äôm an Auburn fan and he is GOOD
Rodrigo Blankenship mah man
Where did you get the music?
Thank god im not the only browns fab in existence
You went d1 I expected that you would show out at that flag football cmon
0:49 You gotta do your boy Flem like that bro ü§£ü§£ü§£
no mention of mason crosby?
I only subscribe CAuse you played in Dallas at the cowboys compound
My lil homie Rodrigo Blankenship on the thumbnail üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm not even a UGA fan... I‚Äôm a bold fan and we play them like every year üòÇ
KTO is the goat! Good content
All Day!
"kickers on cocaine"
RODRIGO IS NOT WEIRD! #fearthespecs
Mmg??
Blair Walsh all I gotta say.
There is criminally low amount of comments giving love to the all time scoring leaders sweet ass song and shorts
Did u see MMG when u went to see the cowboys?
Problem with finding a good kicker from a coaching standpoint is that it doesn‚Äôt matter if they are 100/100 in practice. All that matters is if you can do it with all eyes on you. Tough job man.
You see troydanüòÇüòÇ
Flemlo represent!
Yo! It's my boi Hotrod! Also i'm not a browns fan but gonzalez is hot trash.
Let‚Äôs not talk about ravens browns field goals
0:50 no
Great video, but you shoulda squeezed in 30 seconds of Garo Yepremian trying to throw a pass in the Super Bowl vs. the Redskins. :)
Are u left handed/I‚Äôm left handed
Aye KTO still got it
Did u see mmg because he was there and met Barry Sanders
7:00 Oh so that's what happened.  The announcer put the mouth on him.  "He hasn't missed in two years"  Way to go announcer.
No joke, you've got one of the best outros ever with that song coming in
Flag football lul
What no mention of wide right and the Bills?
Why was Hot Rod on the thumbnail but wasn‚Äôt in the video??üòÇ
but still R.I.P to the¬†browns
Rest in peace Paul Allen. You deserved better...
did you have to put the clip of the patriots winning against the chiefs.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† chiefs fan.
KTO you should check out Braden Mann from Texas A&M. He‚Äôs an amazing punter who recently caused a fumble recovery against South Carolina.
Cocaine a hell of a drug
Phil Dawson is a browns legend
I'm a Steelers fan and in that first clip of kickers missing fields goals we missed first so you have no right to talk lol.
Phil Dawson is a Browns legend
i clicked this video cause wanted to say i love your work bro and almost 98 percent of the young guys you allways talk abt comen out of collage and every now and then i woneder were are they or what happend to them like mcfadden seen him in one game with oakland. or lamicheal james again one game for 49ers. abt about price petty from balor he was good. i seen u did his w.r. a video on him corey something.alot of my era games cuz im 33 u make videos and answer very very bless you are. mean how do u get the on going ideas from.ur fans i guess right?. but were at like comments here twitter ig? let me no
Speaking of good kickers in college I hope HotRod Blankenship can have a great NFL career
One of my good friends is Matthew Statfords 2nd cousin
Every time I see a notification from YouTube saying that you uploaded a video, I am more than happy to click on it. You‚Äôve been uploading great content for a very long time, and I wish you would have even better success with all that work you‚Äôre putting in. Keep it up.
The 80s must some shit if even the kicker was hittin the yay in the locker room üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Awesome video man
Thank you for including Rodrigo Blankenship in this video
Why we‚Äôre u at the star at frisco lol
No hate at all bout you made a video about kickers and didn‚Äôt talk about Justin Tucker :( Great video still
He was high on cocaine. You dick I was drinking sweet tea and I spit it everywhere
U forgot the kicker with half a foot
In the late 1980‚Äôs I traveled to Lawrence, KS to see my Baylor play KU. The Bears won but what I‚Äôll never forget about that game was when the KU kicker attempted a field goal and it hit the crossbar dead center, proceeded to bounce virtually straight up and then fall barely short of the bar. From our seats near the 20 yard line, it was almost like a slow-motion replay, lol.  I‚Äôve always loved the kicking game. Great video as always!!
I think MMG also attended that thing
that moment when you realised browns should be at least 4-2 or 5-1
RESPECT THE SPECS
‚ÄúBengals trash‚Äù lol
Thank you for not mentioning the disaster that was Russel Erxleben.  People forget that outside of the Dome Patrol and a few brilliant moments from Aaron Brooks, Saints fans haven't had a lot to cheer about since their inception.
Watch this and imagine being a bears fan, me a bears fan ‚Äúdamn I should probably change this huh?‚Äù Then I didn‚Äôt change it and a coked out dude ran for a TD smh
It‚Äôs good to know there is more browns fans out there it feels lonely sometimes
Only if y‚Äôall young boys knew about Hershel walker üí™üòà
Kickers on cocaineüòÇüòÇ
KTO is one of the best qbs to wear a browns shirt of all time
How dare you call my boi Hotrod Blankenship weird lol
Did you see Rodrigo Blankenship (Georgia's Kicker) Last week vs Vandy he had the weirdest field goal.
Can you do one about Derrick Thomas??? Please? Go Chiefs!
Yes
Flemlo got those hands lol
Us charger fans can relate too man :/
I was wondering if you could make a video on your thoughts on the Alliance of American Football
How just gunna put my kicker in your clickbait
‚ÄúKickers on cocaine‚Äù
Great vid as always keep it up
I respect kickers, but I don‚Äôt see how a kicker EVER gets hurt. I just don‚Äôt understand
Comparable to goalies in hockey. I‚Äôve never been on a team where the goalie wasn‚Äôt the weirdest one on the team
You should be in the nfl my guy. You can be the hero the browns need.
You make the absolute best football videos on YouTube. A very big thank you for keeping me entertained. Seriously...who else would make an in depth video on kickers??!!! I love it!
Kto glad your a browns fan im too
ANOTHER BROWNS FAN REJOICE FOR ALL BROWNS FANS
#respectthespecs
How are all of your videos so good?
Man I hope the browns do better!
You and Flemlo should do a video together for the bengals v browns game...and maybe yall just do a lil special collab video on why ur team will win the game or the keys for your team to win or play madden with ur teams against each other..maybe make a public friendly wager for the actual game
FlemLo is way bigger than I thought he would be.
I love Adam üòç
How bout them Chargers:)
mmg was there
how can you make a video about kickers and not mention dan bailey
459th
I think that the browns kicker‚Äôs brother is Blair Walsh
FUCKING HOT ROD THIS GOAT
7:02 That right there is the commentator jinx in full swing!
KTO, a truly one of a kind YouTuber. I've never been so engaged in the lives of kickers haha.
The fact you put a highlight in from SNF last night won‚Äôt get enough credit. Props KTO
KTO, later in the year make another most disappointing teams video, and teams that turned around their season
Fuck you KTO I am a Bears fan
browns fa life
finally some love for the kickers
I don‚Äôt need to imagine being a bears fan I am one
Videos dropping like crazy. Love it man
As a Saints fan for life that week two game belonged to the Browns. I remember chanting before the kick ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna miss it. It‚Äôs the Browns‚Äù out of sarcasm, but woah I wasn‚Äôt ready for that. That sucked.
Im a simple football fan, see Rodrigo "HotRod" Blankenship, I click
I‚Äôm going to write a book called ‚ÄúKickers on Cocaine.‚Äù
Kicker lives matter
"""See this game and imagine being a Bears fan.""

Vietnam Flashbacks of being a current Bears fan and seeing them loss

""SKIP!"""
Nice video
My dad is a Vikings fan and he remembers that game and hates when he hears about it
another great video
What about the man himself, Young Hoe Koo?
ya mom is maybe straight
Eagles fan here while he became an instant legend last year with the 61 yard game winner against the Giants still have to hold my breath every time Jake Elliott kicks a FG or Extra Point because he's had some misses too.
I'm a huge ravens fan and I was mad that we tipped the kick and it went in but Browns put up a good fight
This video comes out two days after Kirby Smart try to get Rodrigo Blankenship to run the ball on 4th and 9 after a fake punt... It didn't work
"I have to admit...that's a pretty nice little gift via your sponsor...I'm impressed they would do something like that...I haven't been to a sporting event in years but I promise I will check them out if I do...

Semper Fi!!!"
Carlson sucks
8:10 Yeah that one time Auburn won after returning a missed field goal to the end zone clinching the SEC West in front of their home fans
Mason sucks too man.... I lost my shit when Green Bay played Detroit (I'm a cheesehead). It was awful
Five points sounds way younger than what he looks. This is the first time I seen him.
Imagine being a vikings fan....
Urinating Trees dad is big ben. Big Ben raped trees mom that's why he hate big Ben and calls him fat fuck. True 100% facts
Ya, it‚Äôs like when you have an absolute DOMINANT team but somehow have a worse kicker every year
"This hurt. As a Ravens fan. This hurt. 

Good video though"
bengals trash
papaaaaaaa
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. There‚Äôs too many kickers who can‚Äôt handle pressure compared to those who can
"‚ÄúI have never been so unsettled watching a special teams unit‚Äù
I bet he made this before the Packers-Lions game"
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. There‚Äôs too many kickers who can‚Äôt handle pressure compared to those who can
You forgot to mention the Clef Foot Kicker.  He kicked straight-legged, had a custom boot for his kicking foot, and because of the way his foot was deformed he was dead accurate kicking straight-footed.
You fuckin labelled flemlo Bengals trash im dead that was so funny
Go browns! I‚Äôm from NE Ohio
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen kicker on cocain‚Äù üíÄ
Lol bengal trash that had me dead
I'm a Steelers fan, can't wait to see y'all next week
Urinating tree looks like ben roethlesberger
We need a new kicker for the bears
The browns kicker  went to my high school and I fill ashamed but at least he was good enough to make it
Hop off my man Hot Rod... only UGA fans would put this ^^^
Please do a video on why vontae Davis retired at half time
"KTO you‚Äôre such a great youtuber








Now that he‚Äôs not looking the browns suck the ravens are better"
This is awesome
You missed the kicker with half a foot who had a rule made for him.
it's weird to think that the browns should be 5-1 if they had a decent kicker
"I guess you can say every dawg has its day 








I will see myself out now üö∂"
Pat Mcafee was on the Rich Eisen show last week and said himself kickers aren't football players. They're mindset going into each play is different compared to any other position during a game.
I love my kicking brethren.
You've got such a great feel for this. Can't believe a network hasn't recruited you yet. Or maybe they have.üòÆ
Nice
Dude I‚Äôm subbed to Flemlo too!
What college did Hershel walker go to
Holy shit that dude running that kick in coked out of his mind is hilarious
Favorite youtuber
Lol KTO and Flemlo at a Cowboys game wearing Browns and Bengals gear
Underrated YouTuber
You should talk about fair catch kicks and drop kicks
Yo can you do a video on concrete charlie
What‚Äôs the song at the beginning?
Kick 6?
Any ideas on why great college kickers are so bad in the NFL?
Is it just me or have kickers just sucked in general this year, in college and the nfl?
Kto the goat
Best edits ever üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Barefoot? Ouchie
Stop shit talking the players who have the most pressure on them at all times
I knew you were gonna do something related to that browns saints game the second i saw it happen üòÇ
MMG recently released a vid at the same place. I was trying to look closely at the 7 on 7 game but couldn't find. @MMG
lmfao now you know how us chargers fans have felt the last 2 seasons ROFL ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èü§ó
Well, on the bright side, they have this in common with Alabama.
is everyone just going to ignore the fact that a kicker made a TD while high on cocaine?
‚Äúbengals trash‚ÄùüòÇ
"Bengals Trash"
Browns, draft Rodrigo "4 eyes" Blankenship.  You won't regret it, he is legit great
Dan Baley used to be the most accurate kicker before his injury

browns beating the ravens was fake news
Mannnn your disrespect my bengalsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"‚ÄúImagine being a bears fan‚Äù
I am one"
Hot rod!
Nice vid man keep making them!!!
Lol 0:05 edited browns merch
Was that Georgia I saw? üòÇ
Carlson won it (he's middle)
blankenship is a god
I don't understand why soccer players are not used more for this? In the NFL Europe Manni Burgsm√ºller had quite the career as a kicker after being a soccer pro.
Adam vinetari is actually the all time scoring leader.
Bengals Trash!! üòÇüòÇ
bengals trash
Did you see mmg
Rodrigo Blankenship is a physical specimen
Papa mmg was there to and a kicker
I‚Äôm a kicker a punter and a linebacker for my city league team and a quarterback wide receiver linebacker and cornerback for my middle school team and out of all of those kicker and punter are my favorite
The GOAT behind Adam is Matt Bryant
Yooo that's a way better look at UrinatingTree
ZANE GONZALEZ I WOULD RATHER TAKE HIDE AND SEEK ADVICE FROM ANNE FRANK THAN HAVE YOU AS MY KICKER. PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN HEAD BACK DOWN
Tree has the athletic ability of Homer Simpson and looks like Big Ben's younger brother
Your amazing KTO
Shouldve mentioned Jason Hanson since he experienced 2 decades worth of kicking
Maybe Gonzalez is cursed by his number look at other flops that wore that number Tim Couch, Johnny Manziel.
I‚Äôm a browns fan cause of u
meanwhile Jason Myers goes 7 for 7 for the Jets.
I love your channel kto :)
Hot Rod Blankenship and Herschel, damn good Dawgs! Go Dawgs!
Hi person to lazy to skip ahead in the video
As a bears fan, kickers are gay
I go to school with both of Phil Dawsons kids
Cool video
It's good win still win the head to head record  of all time plus remember 2015 when we won on a miss field goal and we returned it,  good times.  Don't worry we will get you
I was hoping u would talk about Rodrigo Blankenship, the greatest kicker of all time
Will never understand why the Pats didn't hold on to Vinatieri.
KTO=üêê
yo man where the browns "Hard knocks" review i thought you were doing?
Saw Scott player on the thumb nail and clicked immediately! Also KTO you doing a video vlog of the Dallas trip like UT?
As a Bama fan this is true lol
favoite team is batimore
Rip
Yo man... where is the Browns
I hate to now because  I am a raven
Kickers on cocaineüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Chester Marcol proved that the White kept him hyped!!
You should‚Äôve said something about nick folk
Rodrigo Blankenship sounds like the most Madden-generated name I've ever heard
Zane Gonzalez missed kicks from the east, to the west, back to the east, baaaaaacccck to the west
Try being a Bama fan, we can't find a kicker to save our lives.
"0:09
What is the name of that song?"
Mmg
Rodrigo on the cover ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§
Happily, as a Ravens fan we have Tucker.
Was papa there? Or known as MMG
Who actually dislikes KTO videos??
whats your intro song?
You should do biggest NFL jumps of all time.
my dad
Ahh kickers...
Damn, you are so awesome man, keep up the great work
Hot rod
Any real Browns fans know Phil Dawson is the GOAT
Who's the kicker with the handlebar mustache. I must know.
"Oh man sometimes middle of the pack kickers will hit some ridiculously long kicks 
(Andrew Franks 2016 @Buf)
Or the fact Cody Parkey has literally been winning Miami games since 2016 and he was only on the Dolphins for the 2017 season
(16‚Äô CLE @ MIA, 18‚Äô CHI @ MIA)
Kickers are really crazy at times and you can‚Äôt really judge them because they will continue to surprise"
Back when Phil Dawson was actually good
KTO's Flag Football team > Entire Bucs Team
What's up Karsten Mayfield? Tree says hi.
As a Raven fan let me tell you The KICK-SIX was waaaaay Better üòÇ
Phil Dawson was the greatest kicker the Browns have ever had!
Glad you came to my hometown!!! Hope you enjoyed downtown.
KTO you‚Äôre such an awesome YouTuber.
As a georgia fan, Rodrigo is my favorite Georgia player all time.
"I immediately thought of you for both of those heartbreaking browns games earlier this year lol

As an FSU fan it's weird seeing how bad Aguayo turned out as it just seemed like he couldn't miss in college. His younger brother is currently really struggling, so maybe he'll be good in the NFL? Seems to be how it works heh"
Don't say the Bengals suck you freaking idiot in then i will unsubscribe to you and plus they suck and if you even think they're going to win the Super Bowl you thought wrong cuz you're dreaming a little bit too big
Being a Browns fan can‚Äôt be easy or fun. But if it makes you feel better, I‚Äôm a die hard Lions fan. We share an unfortunate record together. But true fans don‚Äôt care about their teams records. You‚Äôre a fan no matter what
You look like a npc form bully
BRUH MY TEAM 0:49
The refs are still against us!
Who else is here before 1000000000 views???
Kto is my dude
will you make a vlog about the trip like UrinatingTree?
I‚Äôm a bears fan but that was bad üòî
4:18 until Vinatieri breaks it in a few weeks
The dislikes are kickers
Memphis is a kicker factory, between Stephen Gostowski and Jake Elliot they‚Äôve got two guys with a ton of power #stripeup
KTO you forgot one kick. Georgias PAT when Rodrigo Blankenship stopped and made it.
Yo you you should do a collab with MMG now that you‚Äôve met him
Justin Tucker is the kicking GOAT
The 1980s: still proving that cocaine made everything you like happen
Ive never seen a channel more loved and appreciated more than KTO. Great job on your videos dude. Keep it up.
Was mmg there?
I know you get music from Epidemic Sounds, but does anyone know the song titles of some of the songs he uses??
John Madden jinxed the f*ck out of Gary Andersen
What about crosby
"Hey KTO. 

Can you do a video about Non-Americans playing In the NFL? I would like to see It one day."
KTO, your videos are awesome dude.  Keep up the good work!
"We can't really trust kickers anymore. 




I even worry when Dan Bailey goes out on the field."
Did you meet MMG?
Im a kicker and I love it. The anxiety is real, but in the end its fun
KTO has been in the facility with MMG
"Nate Kaeding has a nickname when he played with the Chargers






Kicks Ass Except During Important NFL Games"
Kickers are people too
Last winning season the browns have had 2007 10-6 never forget my guys Derek Anderson jamal Lewis kellen Winslow and Braylon Edwards... but that‚Äôs back when the browns had one of the best special teams units in the league with cribbs Dawson and zastidul
Ahh kickers the nerds of the team
hell just watch the 57 yard kick matt bryant made against the buccaneers that ended up with HAMSTRING INJURY to see how important kickers are
5:47 fucking evil
Such good editing, always much respect KTO
That ending was actually insane
HELP WANTED:kickers
Browns really need to draft a new kicker
Wait@kto, were you there at the same time as MMG?
what position holds the ball for kickers
KTO to replace blake bortles
Dak
Apparently Zane was playing with a torn groin against New Orleans
Karsten rodgers
Dark to the future
The Browns' kick 6 is one of my all time favorite plays. LOL
Loved the video
I live in dallas
If you want the black guy with dreds youtube it‚Äôs flemloraps
Punters are people too...
Gary Anderson still haunts us today
You see Rodrigo Blankenships extra point a few weeks ago when the holder bobbled it and Hot Rod stood there and stepped back a foot and just swung his leg and made the extra point? That was some impressive stuff.
You were there too? I was watching UrinatingTree's video...he's great! :3
Kickers are people too
You played flag football with a Bengals fan and a yinzer? Does seatgeek exclusively sponsor fans of the AFC North or something?
Kickers are the deciding factor between a couple games every yr for teams... just this past weekend, a chip shot 37 yard miss by Washington cost them the game vs Oregon and basically ended their season
Heyyyy any got football practice today
Mmg went there to check him out
Bro the game is fixed
Rodrigo Blankenship is a god
You didn‚Äôt even mention the only 1st round kicker. Smh
Do a vid on your thoughts or criticism on roughing the passer this year
Adam Vinny best kicker ever
The picture of them in Dallas, is one of the greatest photos, that I thought I‚Äôd never see, it was honestly beautiful
The Moral of the story is cocain is one hella a drug
Not as bad as the Vikings üëçüèª
should have shown rods no run up kick
I miss Phil in Cleveland. The only bright spot on the team for years.
I know special teams players rarely get in, but Vinatieri should be in the Hall of Fame when he retires. IF he retires.
This was a fun video
"Zane Gonzalez!!!! I would rather be best friends with Nichole Brown Simpson than have you as my kicker!!!

Wait wrong channel..."
Morton and Gary Anderson are actually brother's in that Vikings Falcons 98 game!
Do a vid on Herschel Walker because as a Georgia player I don't think there was a better player in college football history
Adam vinatieri is my friends uncle
üêêüêêüêêüêê
I wanna 1v1 KTO one day. I just wanna see if I can man coverage you lol.
Nice vid, I'm kicker in my junior football league
YYEESS AANNOOTTHHEERR VVIIDDEEOO
That feeling when the browns should be 5-1
Get him more subs
‚Äúyou‚Äôre only as good as your kicker‚Äù tell that to alabama!! üòÇüòÇ
Thank god the Browns got rid of Zane Gonzalez
Wait thats really 5 point vids, damn
You know he had to do it em
KTO You a goat. I am a razorback fan and its been tough the last 8 years, but we had a kicker named steve little who kicked the farthest field goal in ncaa history.  The story that happened with him was so sad.  He became a parapelegic the night after he got cut from an nfl team.  No one here will remember that unless they are 40+ years old but it was a different era
Yeesss! KTO uploaded, you know it's a good day
as soon as i saw blankenship on the thumbnail i clicked, that man is the real goat
"Tree, Five point, KTO and Dallas Cowboys all in one (I saw UTs video earlier about the trip)

What kind of paradise Is that and how much are the tickets? And can I find them on seat geek? üíØüî•üêê's"
Bruhhh seatgeek gave you the hook up. Looked fun as hell
I wish I could've played football with flemlo and kto
Make a video on Dick Butkus
KTO > Mariota & Carr
THE GODS OF SPORTS YOUTUBE
Calling ‚ÄúOvertime‚Äù ‚ÄòSudden Death‚Äô is so much cooler
Where my boys from SOUTH DAKOTA AT?!?!?!? SDSU 4 LIFE!
I actually can‚Äôt believe you made a kicker video and didn‚Äôt mention Justin Tucker
One of the best channels on YouTube the absolute best football channel
Why'd you have to do this to me
Got to respect Adam vinatieri
I‚Äôm a bears fan =( this week against the phins should‚Äôve been a W
Kto is a BOSS
As a Vikings fan all I can say is that I'm glad you didn't put Blair Walsh in here too
Holy cow this is the best video I‚Äôve ever watched on YouTube üëç
Was mmg there
I‚Äôve been watching u for a while now and realized I wasn‚Äôt subbed till now but I just did
The nfl Ball is bigger than college which is why they have a harder time kicking it imo
Video so fresh, he has Gostkowski‚Äôs game winner from last night.
Weird vid but still cool
Mason Crosby 1-5
Did you really have to bring up Gary Anderson?! And CARLSON?!!! WHY NOT JUST RUB IT IN FURTHER AND BRING UP WALSH TOO?!?!?!? STOP TORTURING US VIKINGS FANS WITH OUR LONG HISTORY OF KICKERS CHOKING!!!!!!! IT‚ÄôS CRUEL!!!!!!
Only the Browns. Haha
Hot Rod the god
Now punters
they should have 4 point kicks for 60 yards just to encourage people to do that
The Washington kicker saved the day against my Oregon duck hahaha
Cool
Thank you for not ending this with Blair Walsh.
Kickers are the goaltenders of football... except less athletic.
You should make a full video on the kicker that on mvp
Thought graham gano was in here with the 63 yard field goalüòÇ panthers fan
i love your vids keep up the work üòÅ i am going to ude your code for seat geek for the detroit lions game when i go to one again browns are doing  good in my books this year keep up the good work üëçüôå‚ò∫
not having janikouski in the vid is a shame
"YEAAAAHHHHH IM NO QUITTER 

Someone pls continue"
Kto in his videos sounds like a dude who is like Andrew luck but when ever he's actually talking about football he just shit posts endlessly. He is amazing.
Kickers hate the vikings
Dicker the kicker
GOAT
Please no not Gary Anderson KTO :(
I'm a simple guy if I see a KTO notification I'm clicking
What was with players in the 80s and 90s making songs and having songs about them? The eagles and the fridge both have songs.
Kickers score more points than QBs.... think about that!
About time you did a video on a kicker haha
can you guys check out my stud or bust on bryce love i tried rly hard om in but its not doing very well
Kickers miss all the time! cough cough Browns cough cough
Rodrigo for Heisman
KTO your kicker in week two suffered a torn groin.
"You mean ""One of a Kick""
(I need serious help)"
You got to go to the Star? You lucky fucker...
I‚Äôm a simple man, I see a kto video I click.
My name is bob
I feel bad for Zane Gonzalez
0:49 I know Flem ain't feeling that
wheres mmg
Karsten Mayfield
Love your videos bro
Robbie Gould was the goat tbh.
Hmm  a browns and yinzer fan together how'd that work out
I always see seat geek but never use it
I seriously hope that KTO has a collaboration with Flemlo Raps and maybe even The NBA Storyteller one day tbh.
You know who else is underrated? KTO.
