Did that dude just say he’s trying to get his money and go D1? at least he’s honest, most players pay to play now a days
@5:09  No. 86 looks like a drag queen
Pure Awesome
What's with the rugby scrum caps?
"Player: ""I like Brock""
Coach: ""I like him too""
Player: ""You don't like him enough.""
Broncos, Texans and Browns: ""Believe me, nobody likes Brock."""
These dudes suck
What's the point of pranking if no one knows you
8-0 baby
That was fun!!
Goff is like Mcvay isn't here I can where whatever I want
Remember when people were calling Jared Goff a bust?
#18 taking back to the coach saying you don’t like him enough. Love to see what happens “if” he makes D1. That time would change quick. Reckon he’d try to talk back to Saban, Dabo or Harbaugh? Send him packing..!
why the hell did i think this was Foles when I clicked on the video but it's Goff lol
Guaranteed you none of the players still new who it was after he took the wig off😭
You can't just put a wig on any quarterback cuz everybody know what the good ones look like wig no wig, but put one on a known infamous quart back they'll never know,
This was fake af
"As soon as there's a camera, BLACK PEOPLE act like bigger retards than ever.!
...pimples...#18"
Rams is my family
Lowkey this makes remember of that movie "Remeber the titans"
“Really strong arm”. Lol
Hercules??
Did 18 ever go D1?
Imagine what would happen if the coach ran contact and Goff got his ACL torn
Dope!!! Lol
Remember that Jesus loves you and Jesus saves✝️🙏🙌 Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life! John 14:6 With God all things are possible! Matthew 19:26 God is good all the time and all the time God is good! Amen🙏 Have a blessed day😊
#18 is D12 lmao
Brock looks like Mitch trubisky
WHAT IS WITH THE SANDWICH SOUND EFFECTS?
Those tattoos suit him good for some reason 😂
"Hercules" lmao
You can tell high college level players, regardless if they go to a big school or not. Dude has a cannon. I honestly didnt realize how big Goff was. goodness
"Guy 1: He asked if I was the punter.

Guy 2: So disrespectful.

Actual Punter: Gently weeps*"
I've seen a few of these "Transfer" videos and Goff was the best transfer yet. What are you, the punter? That's a line for the ages.
Awesome.
"Whats your name ?
Dog."
Are you the punter? Lmao
Why the number 18’actig like that. Jeez
Rams 2018 baby
"broski"....best last name ever!
Lmao that little spud monkey ain’t goin d1
K
Who?
Goff throws a beautiful deep ball so effortlessly!
Nice
How the coach gonna let that kid talk back to him like that?
We need so many more of these!
pranks unsuspecting college football team.
wat college team wears those headgear lol
Around 2:10 : Jeff Spicoli goes quarterback...
Ya name daug? 😂
#18 is annoying af
Rams 6-0
Fake and gay
Check out my last post . I almost touched lil skies at a concert
6-0 baby
#18 needs to stfu. What dude needs to do is fix his face. #Proactive
This is still awesome as heck!!!! Made my day guys
Great stuff!
Mooshagian   Hell ya
wierd you didnt show any comments from the starting qb
Why are they wearing scrum hats, in practice?
Where is the d one getting his money
I lost it when he called him the Punter.
boooo  619-917-6945
Just remember Patriots fans, 18-1.................................18-1.
Tl;dr NFL players comes and shits on a bunch of nobodies who aren’t going to make it in football. How is this good-natured it’s pretty shitty
This video cracks me up
Lol, "You the punter bro?"
And none of these kids made it
Lke if you realized my spelling error
Editing can be better, ie. showing the reaction of the "reveal"
Thats my QB im from LA
These kids probably had no idea with this huge camera crew showing up
Holy Beautiful
Haha that was great! Thanks so much for posting.  This must have been a tremendous experience for those young men and it was great of Jared to do it.
And VC went on to an incredible 2-11 season
At 5:08 number 86 looks like she is a halfway through a male to female transition.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-MyRFjxjmw4
Great video moron
Still can't beat Fullerton go hornets
That's awesome. :)
how did they not notice his jersey is number 16+ that hair do boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That was awesome lol
This is beyond uber awesome!
be even funnier if they didn't tell the coaches
"'What was yall's record last year?'

Uhhh.umm."
Terrible job on that wig
idiots
That dude trying to go D1 is way undersized. No doubt he’s fast but I’d worry if he got tackled by an NFL sized player.
I don't know why but that sound of him chewing was disgusting. Maybe because it sounded squishier than it should have.
I’ve watched this multiple times and I thought this was a high school.
Nobody caught the fact that there’s a dude at :35 really sporting the last name “Broski”? lol
Classic
Ryan gosling ?
#18 is the type of player to talk back to the coaches and make everybody do push ups
Well done Red Bull, that was pretty funny.   👍
#18 needs to seriously just sit down and work.
Number 18 will not make it for ego.
That’s cool
"5:12
mfw I'm taking a smash in the bathroom & my gf barges in without knocking"
Need more of these
I told a chemistry joke the other day, and I got no reaction
RED BULL does not give u wings..
Dude that guy's ears @1:25 are freakin' tiny
Jared Goff is a BALLER!
I was at a nationally ranked DIII school and during my junior year we had a pitcher transfer from down south.  He's throwing in the lower 90's hitting spots and mixing his pitches well.  Pretty much the entire team was salivating, as we were already returning 2 all-region pitchers.  Fucker dropped out of school a week before the first game of the season.
Just an FYI. They were conference champs in 2012, -2014-15-16-17 and have been to a bowl game every year since 2011.
I really liked the vid it's actually pretty funny Jared golf is a decent player come check my new vids you would really like them 😀
Scripted
Their quarterback at the end was like thank god...
“What are you the punter” 😂😂
My dad played here
Good one cuz!
That looks like so much fun. What a nice video.
Gawd, # 18 likes to run his mouth!
"All these cameras.  They're interviewing us.  The guy in the funky wig must be Jared Goff."
That's awesome!
Are these special needs kids?? Looks like a protective cover.
Hahaha "what was your record last year?" Lmfao
No fucken clue who that dude is..
As soon as he uncorked that deep ball they should know that unless he is coming from the California Penal League they've been punked lol.
What's the deal with those helmets?
Why is football all about the money it’s only about to play the game for me
Pretty good? Lol very dwhat?
That kid wouldn't last in d1 talking back.
That was dope!!😂😂
Is this fake
Bunch of cry babies
Never heard of this guy. Must suck
That was cool
I wish I'd be bigger and not so small. I want to sling it like goff. I can't even hold the ball tight or throw it properly
I fist read the title as "transgender prank" and I was wee bit confused
He’s fuckin doodoo my girl likes him tho😭
My old football coach from sacramento state
I love how Goff was almost a draft bust due to Jeff Fischer sucking as a coach. Makes you wonder how many others players lives and carrers were ruined due to shyt coaching!
I dislike people like that short rat #18 barking loud . Little chihuahua
came for that disgusting looking thumbnail.
QB's like...there goes my scholarship 😂
Song? 4:37
i still don't know who he is LOL
Lol number 15 got scared that he will get his starting spot taken away🤣😂😂
""" what's your record last year '
"" Shhhhhh "" 
"" that's why im here ""
"" what you mean "" 
😂😂😂😂"
Always dream big!
3:30 "What are you the punter?" lol
Please pay attention in school kids or this is what happens. 00:24
R  F t let
Go Hawks!
Lol. Their jaws dropping when they see him sling it is my fav part.
"RIP Mac Miller 
Always REMember !"
Did anyone catch a pass that day from any quarter back ??
Very entertaining!
How would this ever not be staged? Oh just ignore those camermen theyre just messing around today. Or do they record it after and force reactions like a movie?
Jay Hickman
#18 trash asf
🤣😂🤣😂
This dude just threw for 465 yrds and 5 TDs vs the Vikings. LOL!!!!!!!!!!
Redbull needs to do this for all their athletes.  Could you imagine Mark Marquez at a club race?
1:46 I mean i like Jared Goff, but he isn't an all-pro quarterback.
805 LOVE
That was great Goff
Loved it
#18 sounds like t.o with Tony romo
what type of football is that bc it aint tackle lmao
#18 is probably a 3rd stringer
bruh i would of socked number 18 he already pissing me off and its not even 2mins in the video lol chill bruh who tf r u
"This reminds me of that one  episode  when Patrick put a wig on andwent inside the Krusty krab and then got hit on by Mr k himself because he thought he was a girl.






Either way cometely off topic."
Jered ain't a familiar face when it pertains to QBs. Most if them were like...'ok' it's jered.....
BUILD THAT WALL NGGGG
That was cool
is this a Juco School or?
18 is a thug.
Inspiration....
Is that a chick at 5:09 ???
Is Jay related to Mike Vanderjagt?
The real prank will be when #13 "The Punter" takes Jared Goff's job with the Rams in a few years.
That WR is a good dude. He was sticking up for his QB's.
These guys are scrubs lol
Who the duck is this guy
kid at the end..."remember this for the rest of my life"....it's all about memories....life.
So we are just going to ignore the helmets?
i see all that green and i see all the money ima get in D1!! LOL!!!
That number 18 dude rude asf he ain't making it in the NFL with that attitude but hes loyal
They should’ve gave him the QB position to see what the reaction would be lol
Ryan Gosling is a pretty good QB. Who would have known?
He took off the Wig and everyone acted like they instantly recognized him
5:07 Nice to see girls playing college football
I am trying to get money cuzzzz
"""Come on up here Jared!""

..sucks in gut..lol!"
This fake there are so many cameras they can tell
Too Much Fun!
#18 said something like "he trying to get dat green from Division 1" blag blah blah. I thought you cant take money while in college,  I guess he meant an academic scholarship since he spoke so eloquently.
What are you the punter lol
loved this
Why you trying to make him look like Kyle Orton?
Now that was good stuff. LMAO
#18...self appointed team leader.
Nothing more obnoxious than wannabe D1s.
Goff just beat the Vikings too.
If they stop kneeling I will once again watch NFL ...until then not watching
Hey thats our quarterback
"Can someone please explain why this isn’t a weekly show here. The premise is F’n great! 

But I guess there would be some limitations. You couldn’t really bring in 6’3 Julio Jones and say he’s a goofy transfer."
Is Goff good enough to play for that team?
This is fake
Hey! Number 18! You're not a star. You're not the coach. BE QUIET!
Maybe they should have used a better QB...
I cannot stand 18 😂😂😂
Why are they wearing scrum caps
It's sad how number18 is not accepting a new teammate who could  change the teams lossing record" if this wasn't a prank" .. #18 is the bad seed who he just talks about money money money  but he ain't gonna make money money money if he's not open to new teammates who could bring Change to the teams out come and win games and than d1or college could look at this team and be like dang there good and pick the good ones on the team but #18 is feeding the already bad team with negative comments ..look nfl teams trade there bad seed players all the time and some teams end up being good with new members ..#18  should know this and accept new teammates no matter what bc at the end of the day he's gonna be on the team so why talk crapp to a new member of the team which he don't  know anything  about him ..it takes one new member to change a bad team ....#18 You gotta go you bad seed bye bye 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
I like brock
0:46 why does Brock look like the guy that played Clark in Smallville?
They wouldn't recognize him without the disguise
Is there the son of former Colts Kicker Mike Vanderjagt???
5:57 .. smokepurpp?
i bet he cant throw the football over them mountains
TOO FUNNY....LOL
"I like Brock".. Goff- "who are you the punter?"
There’s no way that the TE’s last name is broski 😂
He was rocking the long brown hair..
I live in Ventura
That was great!!!
This is funny
threw a straight interception, must be him LUL wonder how many takes it took to show him actually being good LMAO
Glad to see football man stand up
Wtf are those helmets
Jared Goff gonna win mvp this year, only bc of the weapons around him and that offensive system
#18 out here like hes a superstar playing with a paper helmet on. Go sit down somewhere
He kinda looks like Jared Goff.
I have Goff on my FFL team 😂
Wish they showed more of the passes, receptions and the players reactions. Is there a longer version of this?
I have Goff on my FFL! Scrored 58 points! Haha😂
Tom brady is the goat...but after my beloved patriots comes Jared Goff and the rams, love how things are going out there and I'm cheering for him
yoooo thats my hometown ! thats crazy #GOPirates
at 3:13  they’re hip...
Makeup artist and that wig is the best they got? Smh
Best QB in the League right now. Kurt Warner 2.0.....
Annoying but got to admire the loyalty and trust
5:56 # wtf is that gross little thing in between Goff and #22 Is it human?
dam dude b talkin bak he b cut b4 the game with belichick at the helm
Thats pretty kewl
THAT was funny!
"Everybody was clueless, everybody looked at him like he was hercules or something!"Lol😂  5:57
is 18 the mascot????
No way that’s my local community college haha
number 18 is that one guy that peaks in college and everybody hates
Running for the MVP this year the Goffinator!
WHERE MY VENTURA PEEPS AT!!!! We out here livinnnnn.
That loud mouf N need to STFU.
I love these pro pranks!
I remember my days in high school, Curtis Martin came to our practices when he was with the Patriots!
This is not real
His last name is broski haha that's great
#7 was a good teammate, unbiased and loyal but willing to let the new guy prove himself
"You fast?. Alright balls coming" Lol
"Can We Get Some Faster Guys Out Here"
I mean... Coulda been better
GOAT
Goff hasn't had an All-Pro selection yet....
Idk why they even dressed him up ain't nobody going to recognize him 🤣
#18 just happy he still gonna be starting
Jared Goff reminds me of Nicholas Cage
Jared played the part well
Anyone ever met his dad? Jack Goff?
we just hit 9 MILL LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Who’s Jared Goff??
That wig looks fake af LMAO
Lol
This looks a little too smooth to be genuine, still funny tho
WHAT ARE YOU THE PUNTER
This made me want to eat a sandwich 🥪
"At least I had the mole"
The one guy all about the money and always saying I I I got get there is no I in team
"Hercules"  😂
Brock was on the locker room packing he missed the whole reveal.
This whole thing is a set up 0:34 dudes name is broski..... Nah breh
Who is that kid talking about "I'm gonna make money"
He’s use to nfl speep😂
Lol compared him to Hercules
Nice
How does the role excuse Goff totally disrespecting the D3 guys? Haha he could have just played it nerdy but he shits on them
What college is that?
This actually illustrates how precise a pro qb actually is
"We need more of this...
Pros going undercover"
Jared Goff is almost the same age lol
Y’all should do Obj or Ab that’ll be great!
“Thas mah quartahback.” 3:37 I’ve heard this one somewhere else before, just can’t put my finger on it...
That was super cool of Goff to do that
This feels scripted
Wait is that Mike Vanderjagt's son?
He looks like that gay guy from the Kardashians lmao
Black dude is “trying to get money” going D1. He is aware that’s illegal right? Hahaha moron
Jared Goff isn't an all pro quarterback. Get your facts right.
#18 annoying as hell!
Who is he
What was your record last year? Guess that's why I'm here, right?  :)
I have to be missing something. Red Bull comes in to randomly do a professional-level mini-documentary with a D3 football team, and it just so happens they have a "new transfer" that same day clearly wearing a ridiculous wig. This has to be all staged, would the players really fall for that?
didn't prank long enough
Could you imagine being one of the players thinking damn we might have a chance with the new qb to find out it’s a joke
That was awesome. Huge Rams fan, even more now. GO RAMS!
Very Best Prank
"come up here...(different audio) ..Jared"
So what you want but seeing Goff devour a sandwich with no remorse instantly made me have more respect for him hahaha he sold me on how good that sandwich really was 😂
Has anyone noticed Jared thanks his dad in every interview for not naming him Jack.
Yes Transgender you can look baby 👄🍆👠💄
Wtf is those helmet
FAKE
Would’ve been funny Asfuck if the coach told the QB he lost his job to the transfer.
I go to Buena High school just about 5 minutes away from the college and it’s funny seeing some of the guys I used to play football with who graduated who now go to VC practice with Goff
He kinda looks like Big Ben
I like how they act like they didn't know.
Good to see this program doesn't discriminate genders and allows girls to play too 5:08
Yooo I went to high school with one of those QBS god dam
How much of this do you think is real? It seems mostly acting.
I just read the title as "Transgender prank" Wtf is wrong with me?!
"When i come out heres and i seez green. Das me deers altot of monyeys i needs to make!
 Can someone please translate this for me?"
Those other qb's were shitting their pants
im impressed by his sandwich eating technique, he made it look like air
WTF is that at 5:08 at left with the ear-rings. Is that a broad?
I played on this field!!!
00:28, odds are against him on getting a NFL contract.. He better hit the books too...
Notice how much better the receivers got when Goff was throwing to them?  A practical demonstration of why a good QB is critical to the success of a team.
Best prank
I thought the whole thing was a skit. What’s up with the helmets, am I missing something?
lol, like he's any good.
That's disrespectful.
Looks like Jonathon cheban from Kardashian show
Not sure what the point was…
Tyreek Hill would be hilarious..
Ron weasley
sunshiiine...
look liie a young jake Palmer
I love the teammate that immediately went to bat for his quarterbacks.
wHatCHu meEn thO? He means you and your team suck kid.
Excellent!!!!
That was fun
Rookie Goff wouldn't even have made 3rd string on this team. He was AWFUL!!!!
More transfers lmao
TOO DUMB TO REALIZE ANYTHING
“The Transfer” starring Jared Goff as the transfer QB and Kevin Hart as the annoying midget wide receiver.
Red Bull: You deserve your 7.8 million views on this video. This was an emotional rollercoaster which ended on a high note, as there was much ebullience and elation upon his revealing himself. Well done.
Whoever did the makeup needs to get fired that’s it Jared still looks like Jared
who?
This is why this young man will go far in the NFL, he has the right attitude, plus it doesn't hurt that he has a cannon for an arm😀
The DBs were pissed...
The goff wentz rivalry will be legendary(dak is average accept it)
13 seems insecure.
I'm a DINDU ya feel me
I really thought this was the "transgender quarterback prank"
It sounds like the guy @1:22 got some help from teachers with his grades.
This is so awesome! That guy was pissed.
What’s up with these helmets
My HS mascot we won state in1993.
Stupid black kid
NFL need to do this more!! Or make is a series!!
so nobody noticed the cameras
that was awesome
They thought they was bout to win the chip when they seen him connecting 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was so cool.
Can we get some faster guys out here what are we doing? haha
His sandwich is so squishy
Jared Goff you did not win state Madison San Diego beat y'all 38-35
Something tells me buddy is not going D1...
I can’t tell if this was like half staged or whatever but he did a good job. Had me laughing. When he asked that dude "what was y’all’s record last year?  That’s why I’m here."  And the way that dude looked at him and said "whatchu mean?" had me roaring.
#18 is that dude. Lol "I like Brock . "
Could still obviously tell what brand the jerseys are....
Welp😂🤷🏽‍♂️
"Xxx Jll.
The"
Legend has it they went undefeated and won a National championship
When these muh fucka's talk. They make no damn sense... all of them sound retarded.
wow, very legit and real prank, very believable high quality qontent.
Is #86 a girl @ 5:08
who's jared goff?
“Are you the punter?”
Should've done face tats.
Red Bull does a good job really making these guys look like someone else. The Greg Maddux one, it was impossible to tell it was him too.
That clown little kid theted aloy of green i gotta get this money
#13 is former nfl placekicker mike vanderjagt son most accurate kicker in nfl history
american are so dumb
Today i am not Jared Geoff, im a tall Ryan Gosselin.
0:33 "Broski" LOLOL!
That was great!
What was your record last year?  Well that’s why I’m here
“no nutrition plan, just sling it”😂
They should cut #18 for team cohesiveness.
👍
A min into the video, and #18 is now archenemy. I can feel it in my bones.
Dude I would destroy number 18 and I haven’t played football since the 6th grade... stfu kid
not a rams at all, but this was really cool of Goff to do this.
#18 is like Boobie Miles from Friday Night Lights
That was great. This should have been an hour long mocumentary. I woulda liked to have seen way more of this.  Reactions to his look, his play at the beginning and then hire it progressed, interactions, etc.
Is 86 a chick?
That mole...lmao why
What does hair hafet to do with Gender??
That guy that was asked if he's fast and then started catching everything was invited up to the NFL. #themoreyouknow
That was awesome. Do more!
I like Red bull
Since when did football players use scrum caps for training
Never seen a bigger group of retards.
"""The whole team looked at him like he was Hercules or something.""
lol"
Hi
16
I've seen less drops at playground games
Tryna get that money at D 1
N(ii. H
These people are in college.
Tx HS football owns Cali, where the talent at
This was fun.
At one o two everyone’s head turns
Still didnt make team
How old is college in the states because just a QB he’s bigger than all of those players he mounts over them taking the picture
#18 is a punk
I bet that starting QB was shitting bricks 😂'thinking he lost his starting job...i bet he was relieved to know it was a joke lmao
I dont know a lot about football and I know that I'm about to trigger everyone reading this comment but why does the dude at 3:11 have a pacifier?
Everybody looked at him like he was Hercules or something ... ammm that’s how you gotta look to go pro if you don’t then you know what’s the outcome . Some is hard work and dedication most of it is genetics. If you tall built then the rest is just practice . There is things you can’t teach unfortunately. Jordan was born with the athleticism he wasn’t born with the skills of playing ball . But his heigh his big hands etc helped out .
The definition of clowned
The good thing is, this can give a nice boost to the guys, electrify them.
#18 sounds like an actor. maybe its just good editing.
I love the support the WR voiced. TWICE. That’s called getting your mans back. Damn.
That boy look like Ryan gosling
6 minute video i saw one catch and i know it wasn’t the QBs fault
OMG THAT  College is across my street
Goff isn't an all-pro QB.
“I like Brock”
Get nick Foles for the transfer
#18 needs to shut up and listen to the coach
Boy!
5:08 is that a chick on the team . A butch chick or a dude, that is a tranny  Wearing #  86  Tell me thats not a chick or a tranny  .
best plays, baker mayfield, american football
I'd be a little disappointed.  I thought we just got an amazing qb, oh no it's just jared goff pranking us dammit
Who is themis guy i just clicked cause it looks funny buy a lot of Pepole know him is he like the number 1 player or something
I watched this guy in high school
"""That's my quarterback!""...yeah, and the second he got a spot on a better team he'd peace out.
Loyalty is great but that guy was just stupid.
Stuck in high school mode."
pizza face needs to shut up hes never going to sniff any where near a good D1 school
Bunch of runts tbh, none of them look like D1 material
"What was yall record last year? Thats why Im here."
No one's falling for that hair.
That was awesome! 😃
Priceless!!
I thought they were about to play rugby
hahaha That was great.
Number 18 got me dead
We are not waiting the NFL 28 year combat veteran🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"When #18 talks about trying to get money, he is referring to a scholarship. 

Seems like a lot of people can't figure that out."
"3:39 - ""What's his name, Koby?"" ""Yeah he thought I was the punter"".

Actually his name is Dre Fogue, not Koby."
looks like the guy on that Kardashian show
Not sure who the young kid /wideout is but  sounds like he needs an education and not D/1
Dude is a conceited douchebag
Sunshiiiiiiiine
I just wanna compete... what a cuck... YOU WANT TO WIN!
Sunshine!
I feel they try and stir away from D-1 schools cause they might get showed up lol or the D-1 players might not be as impressed 😂😂😂
Love how there going to junior colleges and not just some huge D-1 school 💯💯💯👍👌👌
"#18 - ‘all that green equals money; I’m trying to make D1 this year’...

... makes 6 yards off of 2 catches, the whole season."
5:08 number 86... what?
😂😂😂😂💯🔥
Whoa that's my name
Did they wonder why they were gettin filmed
#18 is a joke
Bio !! Ur not going to D one
#18 is a great example of how prejudice people are
Ventura sucks.
18 is a thug and young players like him with no respect are why the NFL is filled with trash "kneelers".
WOW that looks great but it has some sort
LMAO!!!....GOOD ONE!!!!.......
I'm giving him this year to redeem himself. If he trash this season again get him tf out LA.  nigga waisting LA time
"Showed up at my school Ventura College and I missed it!??
Still awesome though haha"
He's only been in the NFL fo 2 years. Hasn't made a name for himself yet. Why would they choose a 2nd year starter over a real nfl qb Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady. Goff had a good season last year, but can he be consistent? If not then Goff will be one of those toss around QB's going from team to team, Jay cutler, Carson Palmer, Kyle Orton, Case Keenum, ...etc. I just think it's too early to start doing pranks on high schools/colleges when you've only been in 2 years.
Sorry I don't follow American Football, can someone tell me what's so bad about being the Punter?
They thought they was going to the chip.
lmfao he's bigger than every other guy on that field.
This would be better if he wasn't the same age as some of these kids
"Ventura College is a nice place. Been there.

Pretty sure that sandwich he ate was from the Jersey Mikes near by lol."
#18 is about as annoying as you can get
Are you the punter....lol
Is it just me or does number 50 look like Daniel Bryan but younger????
Jared Goff ?   never heard of him
😂 " Are you punter?" Jared Geoff you're just trash anyway sir Lmao
That wide receiver is a good kid, he sticks up for the quarterbacks, I like seeing that
18 is a guarantee that he wont make it to pro that mouth would never be accepted in any pro sport.
Amazing how far destroying the english language will take you....oh and checking the minority box.
That's cruel! It's like giving someone a fake winning lottery ticket! LMAO
1:50, you are a student, not an employee. You don't have a job at the school playing the position of QB.
Why is this always in my recommended? I don't even watch football.
Drey Fouge?
Why are the QB’s wearing rugby helmets?
Lol ...Thank you
#18 was a lil too mouthy to the coach in front of the other players
most stupid sport i have ever seen
One of the best pranks.
I had practice there today 😂
Trying to get money ??? Bro your 5 feet tall sit down
These guys shouldn’t get paid if they do . They’re not pros and they won’t be pros
They should make part 2
Done well!
"""Is 13 any good?"" 
""...Yea...hes good.""
 ""What was your record last year?""🤣🤣🤣"
"You don't like him enough."  - hahah that was great timing with that response from #18
Timing that route at 4:58... thing of beauty!
MAKE MORE VIDS LIKE THIS GODDAMMIT!!!!
Nice
I finally pressed this video
@ 4:58 how he caught him coming out the route though. He still not going to the super bowl though. #WhoDat
The teams QB be like" Ahh damn I am losing my job now" 😂😂😂
6,666,666 views
Man, Jared's taking a hell of a chance, what if he threw his arm out, man that would suck. I bet the team owner he's playing for has something to the effect his contract, and if he screws his arm out on anything other than the NFL games.
3:33 ok Terrell Owens
Hope #7 is successful
Still can’t believe Tebow is not in the NFL
Pretty cool.
#18 should stfu.
Brock domann their qb went to my high school he was so good
Brock domann went to my high school
Do a college freshman in high school team. Now that be funny
obviously 100% staged
3:21 that’s offensive to me because I’m a punter
2:52 is the the idiot kicker Mike Vanderjagt’s kid?
Was the disguise necessary?
"1. ""Can we make some f***ing catches out here!?"" is hilarious.

2. If I were one of those players, I would be pissed at the end. Watching him shred the defense would get me excited about winning a championship that year!"
HILARIOUS
Garbage
I don't know this sport.  Is this impressive?
That sandwich looked gross.
The hairstylist chick is fine af @2:16
Bad edit. They didn't show the full pass trajectories. Dumb.
DO ONE WITH STEPH CURRY
#18 needs to check himself
5:08 #86 girl...guy... Lesbian hockey player
Tell the wide receiver to stfu he ain’t going D1
Is this football team real or actually good? This seems like a bad comedy
Ok that was BORING.   where the hell was the "prank"?    he deliberately overthrew the ball so nobody could catch it?   HILARIOUS!
Much better then the fake old man pranks.
Number 86, is that a woman? What the hell
Nr88 is a woman?
What’s the deal with helmet lol. Losers I wouldn’t ever were that
Can we do this for basketball?
They all turn at the same time lol
👊😄🔄
Y’all need more of these
best line "what u the punter"
These are fantastic. keep'em coming.
LMAO this was great do another please!!!
Goff has one good year and everyone thinks he's the next Brady... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Those receivers are trash. They can’t catch a cold.
18 is built like a pube
this is awesome.
i could not be in that locker room with number 18. ima end up telling him to stfu
C.T.E.
So they wear Rugby scrum caps in practice.
#18 sound stupid af
5:08 is that a chick . No fucken way .  There is a chick on the team .
What was y'alls record last year? ........... That's why i'm here, right? LOL
5:08 was that a girl number 86?
Look at their helments
That's my quarterback ;(
I was a receiver played D1. Was on a high school team that was almost all black. (Im black). This quarter back (White Replaced) our starter when he moved to town. He had an arm couldn't move much but had a cannon for an arm. I was the star of the team and watched as other receivers dropped passes on purpose from him. My coach ran 100 percent full contact. Our offensive line kept letting people through to hit him. Kid kept getting up no complaints. Bruh Im talking about big hits. Finally after about 30 mins I figured enough was enough. I could tell he could throw. I went up to "maxwell" Our lead center and leader of the O line). I told him if one more person got through I was going to refuse to play. He thought I was joking but I assured him I wasnt. He told the line and they held it. That kid was special. He thanked me and we dormed up. I helped him with the team he helped me with my routes. We won a state title that year. You guys would know his name as he is in the NFL, we are still good friends to this day. (Bbq once or twice a month).  I was better at a different sport than football and decided to go pro with that rather than a shorter NFL career. I still get NFL box seats whenever I want. The irony is the QB he replaced went on to be a great running back. Not the NFL but he was pro. Just remember guys play the game it all works out.
How is this a red bull commercial....lol literally didn't see a single thing about red bull
That was awesome LOL
I feel like Tom Brady could get to the Super Bowl even with those guys on his team 😂
He sucks tho
Do one for Aaron Rodgers
"""what was yall's record last year?""
silence 
""that's why I'm here tho"""
They must not watch the NFL
Stupid
HEs not hercules just an NFL all pro QB lol
Why is the little pizza faced nxgga talking so much??  Shut yo raspy voice azz up...
They just got punked.
I live across the street
Goff out there throwing ducks. 😒
Coach introduces, “Jared Goff” Players on team, “ whose that?” clueless?!?!? Lol look at there faces!!
dog?
I live in ventura
What kind of helmet is that?
#18 is the type of teammate you want to have on your side on a football team.  Dude clearly has his heart into the team and the game, and I love the way he stands up for his QB even to the coach.  I bet you the coach loved that too
What if they didn’t know who he was lmao😂
This team need faster wide receivers.
Bullshit, fake and staged.
"I like Brock

Me too

You don't like him enough"
At 6:24 you can here someone sneeze :)
Brock was so shellshocked that even after Jared revealed himself, he still didn't understand what was going on. You can see his face wondering why an NFL qb was joining his junior college team. His teammate had to shake him back to reality that it was just a prank. That day must have been he'll for him.
At 5:08 either 88/86 would make a cute girl or that IS a girl.
Those douchebags talk alot of crap about the transfer qb xD
"3:31 THE DISRESPECTTTT
“What are you, the punter?”"
Bb
Jared Goff? Never heard of her
Let's see what happens with 18 in 2 years..... nothing
number 18 is from baltimore. I'd put money on it.
Why goff tho
do it with adrian peterson
That disguise was lame. A wig, some tattoos, and a mole and that was supposed to fool people? This was probably a setup and the players pretended to be surprised. No way some of them didn’t recognize an LA Rams quarterback being a team near LA.
dude you don't need to disguise Jared Goff
5:44 ... #86 have no clue who he is ahha
haha that was great, poor Brock kid tho had a rough day thinking he just lost his starting position because the new guy has a canon for an arm
Ryan gosling playing nfl now?
"""Are you the punter?"" 

LOLOLOLOLOL."
Brock ass😂😂😂😭
What does a quarter back do?
@venturacollege! Let’s go, #venturastrong.
Nfl qb trash 2nd string
Wood hve been better if coach not in on it.
That is the best they can do with the wig?? That stylist is a joke!
Whether it be actor, musician, or athlete....these kind of videos are awesome. And the better the role player the more entertaining it is. Like when jewel did karaoke. good stuff
these college kids look old. the nfl guy looks younger
LoL
I'm sorry but that 18 dude bugs the he'll out of me. Just have soñé fun play bro.
hahha
clark kent should have wore a wig instead of glasses
At 5:09 is #86 a woman?
The Ryan Gosling of Football?
18 was in on the prank. He's Tavon Austin's cousin and would've known it was Goff. That's why he was talking back to the coach like that. We don't know him to know what his true attitude is like. He was just playing his role. Some of yall stay looking for reasons to hate on people, yet we at home on computers and phones, but he's off playing college ball trying to live out a dream. That's childish.
I wish this video was longer lol.
There wide receiver hung in there fir every play.
He looks like such a prick in real life
Hahaha my hair
"At first when I saw #87 I thought they had a girl on the team

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
I live in SP right next to Ventura
Who is Jared Goff?
rams are the worst team in history
Best prank ever....
24 seconds " when i come out here and see green.. that means thats a lot of money i gotta make"  and thats why there isnt really any more legendary players that play cause they wanna be great... idiot kids just in it for the $
"He asked if I was the punter" so insulted from that one comment lol but that might be the best position when you make it to the NFL. Million Dollar contract sit on the bench 90 percent of the game. Who wouldn't want to be that.
I wish they had done this prank with Matthew Stafford as the transfer. I guess even with makeup he'd be too recognizable.
I'm a punter :(
If you like minecraft subscribe to me
The second coach looks like an actor
Another boring American game
that was pretty lame
pure tns from the tweeb talking about green all the time
Still laughing!!!!
hardcore Houston Texans fan but this dude awesome 👍👍
1:08  That pizza face punk needs to shut up
Did they add sound affects when he ate the sandwich??? Lmfao
"Can we get some faster guys here?" They probably had A LOT of running xD
That #18 is the type of guy I’d like to play against than play with
My favourite part of this video was when he drank the red bull.
"the whole team thought he was Hercules or something" lol
Ventura college? Never heard of that all girl school.
He looks like bizzaro world Ryan Gosling after all the make up and stuff
never heard of jared goff
wh was tricked, brah looks like jay cutler
Im actually friends with his second cousin, she goes to my school...Apparently shes only met him once and it was before he was drafted into the NFL
the short black dude was trippin... fam sound like terrell owens.. "thats my quarterback" bruh definately not goin pro with that attitude.. mf wasnt even a qb so why he so mad... they prolly cut dude after that cause i didnt even see em at the end of the video..
"Jareed "" are you the pounter""
Dude ""no im a quaterback""

😂😂😂"
5:09 is #86 a girl?
One thing that’s clear is Jared Goff is a pretty big dude he’s a head above the other QBs and basically everyone else ... genetic lottery favors some
Man. Coach cucked his QB pretty hard for 7M+ viewers. Sheesh. Have a nice season kid.
Still can't believe I sacked this guy when I was playing high school football at San Marin high school. He used to go to Marin Catholic.
Wonder if Dom is gonna get drafted?
omg I'm dying. the jokes he had while undercover! this was the best one yet.
It's GOFF!
3:42 THAT VOICE IS DAKOTAZ
Dropping 70 Yard Passes on Them 😊😄😂
Coach sounds like an older, MUCH MORE CHILL version of John Gruden. "See the way he threw that thing in cover two?" Lol precise voice and syllable cadence.
Do this to mcneese state. That would be awesome
Did he say "I hope I don't scare him"?!?!
ummm...i have never heard of jared goff.
What college
Vc??
I'd love to see more of these episodes
No offense but that dude looked waaaaaaaay too small to go D1
This is dope !! Do Julio jones lmao
this is entertainment!  Jared looks young so he pulled it off but we know the difference of talent and skill immediately from NFL players...
Lol he looks like j fred
Let this be a lesson.  Stay awake in class.
Red Bull is poison
Please more undercover pro athletes videos !!!
I think I'd only last 10 minutes with #18.
Nobody's gonna ask what was up with those helmets tho? They looked like they were playing rugby
Sitting in the dressing room wasting his time trying to.disguise himself when he wouldnt be noticed walking down the street anyway
I doubt they would have been able to pull that prank off in 2018. LOL There's no way they don't recognize now.
#18 What a turd. Shut your pie hole and let your actions speak for you.
03:31 LOL!
Lmao "what are You the punter" no no ima Qb
Goff is so nice
18 is an annoying lil guy...hope he didn’t go D1
So gay
Would have been funnier if the coach didn’t know as well
the acting is fake by everyone
4th time watching this
Is that a chick at 5:08? Cool
drake?
Are they wearing scrumcaps
Clearly not playing for the love of the game. Strictly a money opportunity. That's why I've lost interest in football... And most sports sadly
Should've shown the team's QB's reaction more
Keep these type of  videos coming this was good
this was so freaking cool salute
What’s songs at 4:42?
now bring in adult gohan
Show convince chief square firmly contest consideration leader install example its.
Vc #weplayhard
5:08 is that a girl
Number 18 sounds like a retard
They thought they where great then....
no.18 all about himself
Pretty sure number 86 at 5:09 is a lesbian...just saying.
"Red Bull, Goff didn't make All-Pro.  He made the Pro Bowl.  There's a huge difference.  Pro Bowl is a popularity contest and freaking nine quarterbacks made it last year, almost a third of the NFL's starting QBs.  Goff made it as an alternate.

All-Pro is much, much harder to make, as only two QBs a year get the honor, one from each conference.  Goff had a fine season, but he was light-years from making All-Pro."
Damn. I played for Ventura in 2013. Not much has changed it seems
Damn that #16 guy should be playing d1.
Jonte broski
I love seeing things like this happen, it gives people much more incentive to be the best they can be and makes their day a day to remember.
Amazing prank!
Number 18 wildin'
"""What was y'all record last year?""

....

""That's why I'm here"" 

Lmao"
My cousin goes there!!!
He's like me "I got five minutes"sarfes down sandwich
Yeah, I'd risk injuring my arm and losing millions of dollars throwing to D3 guys for shits and giggles. Makes sense.
Why they gotta have him mic'd up when he's eating the sandwich lol the chewing sounds
hilarious
icke bester mann
that was a boring prank
yyyyaaaasssss
This was absolutely hysterical!!!
Lets be real, most people wouldn't recognize Jared Goff even without a disguise.
Goff is hilarious
Note render graduate properly down disability claim commercial football require.
Jared was eating a subway sandwich 😳
I'm not even a sports fan but I can appreciate some genuine motivation and interaction with the younger generation, good job Jared.
This is dope, man.
Goff is used to passing to NFL wide receivers and before that division one wide receivers. You can see why some of his passes were off.
What!? Are u the punter!!! 🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣
I like how there's a girl on the team.  Doubtful she made it.
Smh. Nasty chewing sounds
Why the added chewing sound effects??
Jay Cutler as played by Jared Goff.
I liked the guy that was defending his QB.  That's a real team player.
I looked it up they've won 7 strait bowl games
That was actually pretty cool.
They should have played this out a little longer. They could have really milked this one haha
badass
Clearly scripted with the black kid mouthing off.
What are you a kicker? LoL
He looks like Steven Crowder in the thumbnail playing a transgender Character
It's actually disrespectful to say that asking a qb if he's a punter is disrespectful.
very cool
terribly staged
After watching I thought this high school football but then saw the title and remember it said college football.oh boy
Better than Kris Bryant undercover 👍
All my quarterbacks? Lol...How about all my recievers....
lol
A big sigh of relief for Brock...
“When I’m out here and see green that a lot of money to get” failed right when he said that
i don't think he flexed on them hard enough.
😁
Jared goff looks like cufboys
He threw four/five shots ffs ..I wish you could read comments before watching video.. Then you'd see how shire they really are and views plummet..
5:08 Is that a woman?
They didnt have to dress him in disguise...no one knows what this guy looks like LOL
No one was happier at the end then number 15. He was probably thinking about where to transfer the whole practice.
A couple of relieved QB's
"I’m dead as hell they probably had that whole team think they were making a documentary and that one guy who kept talking probably
thought he’d get a lot of screen time"
When I out here I see green dat a lot of money I get lmao all he’s good at is football nothing else xD
Nobody cares about the word, "Disrespect!"  Do your job!  Balls coming!!! Catch it you puss!
#18 will never make it! Attitude problem!!!! And Thats coming from an Assistant NFL coach... He would be lucky to ever go D1. Shut up and play your position 18!
This was on my birthday
Jared Goff is better than Aaron Rodgers
hahaha.. that was great ....
What are you the punter
Smack that zit encrusted midget in the mouff
that wig is so obvious
Throwing rockets
"You a punter?" Bahahaha
15’s dreams were shattered and then resurrected that afternoon.
3:30
That's funny!
I'm still trying to understand why the fake grass in Southern California ??
Loved how that RB stood up for his QB
"Are you the punter" 😂😅🤣
Anyone else notice the Head Coach hired his son to be DoFO?
Wish y’all would make more of these, round yalls channel from these vids.
Eh, still got no TDs against my Vikings in 2017.
I'm pretty sure there is a diesel dyke passing as a College Football player in that team. #86?
The actual punter should be the one who’s pissed off
Gotta like the kid that stuck up for his QB
I want to see the behind the scenes footage of the rest of the team saying "f*** our quarterbacks, I want the new guy"
Good video mannnn 😁😁
Wtf is D1 is that below universities?
That was awesome..
Make anthony davis play at collage
I like Brock
"Hey guys...ah....who won the Superbowl ?
The Double headed QB. YEAH BABY ! That's Nicky 6 and Carsen Wentz. The dynamic Duo !"
Go Bears.
Lol
Mike Vanderjagt's kid's a QB? Guess he didn't want to be "an idiot kicker."
is that guy wearing a grill during practice?
"18 : I like Brock
Coach : I like him too
18: you dont like him enough




Pause"
That was badass
This was kinda dope. I played HS fb and two kids from my school went to nfl just b4 i played so they came back and lit us up amd we loved it.  So much so that one of my guys from my squad now has a super bowl ring from tampa bays super bowl.
i went to the same high school as jarad goff, sadly i didnt meet him since he graduated like 2 years before me
Sad that the black kid is just mentioning money, instead of the love of the sport smh
god these players are so stupid
http://bestcashjob.online/?refer=503
You need to be at, 100%, maybe 99, to play in this league.
Everyone looking at him like his Hercules 😂😂😂
Sunshine
Number 18 sounds about as dumb as a bag of hammers
The funny thing is Goff really was like this his rookie year lmao
seems like a setup..FAKE!
That bitchy black WR pissed me off. I’d never wanna be his QB....
What was your record last year? That's Why I'm here!!! LMAO
You can tell those guys thought dere prays were answered when dey thought goff was gone be dere quaterback😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I liked how you heard the sandwich being chewed with a wet noise. Lol.
You should come to my school
Lol why are those guys worried? He's practically the same age and he still plays at the college level
pretty cool
Hey look, it’s Ryan Gosling with a beard and long hair!
I wanted the prank to last the rest of preseason 😂😂
I still can’t believe the Seahawks didn’t run the ball. 🏈
Whoever was #3...he caught EVERYTHING thrown to him.
"hmm, this wasn't much of a prank. I think there was one shot of the players reacting to how strong his arm was. just one shot.
.....
the point of a prank on someone is the reaction you get from the victim of the prank..... one reaction shot was very unsatisfying."
brilliant
In the words of the Great Jim Rome.................EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:55 I love those sandwich sounds
Those receivers are skinny asf
"Unbelievable ! 
This can be very awesome ! 
I don't think it's so convenient ."
Talking up for his quarter back that's what's up
That guy knows there's no money to be made in college football right? (allegedly)
I love this! Freaking brilliant!
Lol they still don't know the nigga
buncha chuckleheads
so basically he not known otherwise they would instantly figure out the prank
Funny
first guy sounded like a younger, black forrest gump. a little smarter of course, just the voice
you should do this for a basketball team
#18 look and sound like a female
Made me a fan of the school and Jared
nigga said what was ya record last year? thats why I'm here lmaoo
#18 ain’t going D1 with that attitude and us against them mentality against the coaching staff, no sense of how to be humble
#18 is straight garbage. What a douche bag
More of this please
whats the deal with 86?
Best prank I’ve seen in a long time, the trash talk 🤣😂 epic. Well done 👍🏼
such a gay game, i cant bring myself to call it a sport.
18 is an idiot
Is this a real video?
One more thing.. no raping!
18 seem like the type of player who still thinks the leagues gonna call at age 30. Good luck to him tho
Ventura college football pirates 4 life this is amazing
Reminds me of that guy from remember the titans the cali guy
gained a lot of respect for Goff after this lmao, used to clown on this guy for being behind Keenum
okay youtube, i clicked on it
FOOTBALLS SO FUCKIN LAME....AMERICANS....17 GAME SEASONS. CONTACT SPORT WITH OUTTA BOUNDS SO YOU CAN HIDE. HOCKEY.. A CANADIAN SPORT. 82 GAMES. NO OUTTA BOUNDS TO HIDE JUST A WALL. BODY CONTACT MOVING AT HIGH SPEEDS. NOW THAT'S A MAN'S SPORT. CREATED BY REAL MEN. GO DRINK YOU LIGHT BEER YOU AMERICAN PUSSIES. LOL.
That's all you will remember..😥whaaaaa bunch of babies
None of those receivers can catch lol
I don’t know why they added the gross sandwich eating sound in. That was just gross.
Sunshine
Ahahahahaha who the hell does 18 think he is
Can someone explain to me why the current players don’t want to accept a new guy to their team😂🤷🏾‍♀️ seems pathetic
meat heads had no clue
Why are these fellas wearing my Grandpa’s helmet?
Money money money...someone should sit down and talk to that boy.
"The Transfer,
Starring Ryan Gosling, 
In theaters summer 2018."
"Don't like him enough."  This punk has as#hole written all over him, and the fact that he has such a platform for the team speaks poorly about the team.  Reading the comments supporting him speaks to the problems with our youth today.  Hating for no reason. Being blatantly disrespectful because you can't understand what is being done. Too much tension and hate. Everyone needs to chill and support every single person they meet. Cherish and learn from one another.
I wanted to see Brock's face when the transfer showed his arm off for the first time 😂 I'm sure it was "😳"
what kinda bullshit 7v7 practice is this
this kool an all but on the low yall got the team hopes up thinking they got a QB like that on the squad lol js
My hometown of Ventura in the 805
You know what they say when you have 2 supposedly good quarterbacks... you have none. If neither is a decent starter that means they both are crap, plain and simple.
I think autocorrect made me say Jared Goff rather than “a guy who couldn’t throw a ball”
Shucking and jiving for the white man
Hahahaha they young guns got shooked by a pro
Good sports
This was great. Didn't know much about Jared goff. He seems like a real stand up guy !
Love the loyalty between that WR and QB!!
lmao what an awesome video .. Good Vibes .. Im Joe Perry
Can't help but laugh at #18, he's like radio of the team. D1 is a far dream for little man.
Number 18 must think he all American in the SEC or sum😭man sorry as hell
All-Pro QB? Um no. That was Brady and Carson Wentz.
At first they did this with christian hackenburg but he was cut from the team
Interpretation o'clock tennis estate act suspend star clerk furthermore best Palestinian detect bus
Awesome
Tom Brady would take this team to the Superbowl! Facts...
Who?
Thats awesome
who’s Jared Goff?
These are great
Coach was nervous around the 2:47, and I felt bad for him.
Those neck tattoos kinda suit him
Why’d they give him such a shitty wig?
"...everyone was all in too....everyone thought he was Hercules!"
I live like 15 minutes away from Ventura College lol
Looks like Trevor siemiean
He look like Sunshine off remember the Titans 😂
looking like a D3 high school
I wanna see Tom Brady
Never underestimate a no skin in fortnite
He didn't even do that good man lol
All fake and scripted.
15 saw his life flash before his eyes lmao
18 is a big mouth fool.
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Can you run? Ok.. the ball is coming. Lol
I thought it said transgender lol now it makes sense transfer
Lmao
They look better than the Browns
Goff is pure down to earth good guy
Why does he eat sandwiches like that
does anyone actually know what jared goff looks like in the first place?
Don't know much about football gear so what is that funny ''helmet'' they are wearing ?  Is it against the heat ?
Nigga out there looking like Sunshine from remember the titans.  LMAO
18 is a diva.
no ones talking about that receiver who absolutely went in for his QB. good man
People forget that Terry is almost 50 while Kevin is almost 40. O.o
So fake but so funny.
That little, tiny, puny mosquito #18 won't make it much farther than those practices.  Nobody is that disrespectful to coaches.  All he thinks about is 'gettin' that money'.  Stereotypical 'ignant' jagoff!
The players had no idea who he was... before, or after.
0:50 is that Thad Castle 3rd guy left????????
do more videos like this
My hair got in the way
these are great series
What these guys and Trump supporters have in common: they talk a big game but since they fucked around in high school they wind up where they belong instead of good jobs and D1 schools.
would have been better if you brought in Stafford & threw it 75 yards down the field to see their mouths drop
Nothing this fun ever happened in my football career.  HA!
That little wide receiver is toxic
At 4:11 you just see the kicker all by himself setting up kicks
FAKE
Those are the gayest little condom caps! Are those things what this young generation is rubbing their pussies with! Cool!
IM FROM OXNARD, CA NOT 2 FAR FROM VENTURA, LIKE 10 MIN DRIVE LOL
fakeeeeee
Rat Olympic present for public smell aspect cream doorway move.
The juco I go to looks nothing like this
go rams
Horrible camera work and cuts. Horrible. Couldn't really see how the guys were reacting with soooo many cuts and camera angles slammed together so god damn fast.
Obligation literature delay shock region recruit naked contact hit sink emotional.
you know those two QBs were shitting their pants when Goff started to take it some what serious lol
Goff wasn't all pro last year...he was pro bowl.
😂

The VietCong football team looks good this year
They ended up going 5-6 no D1 offers
Did I just see Lavar Ball?
Damn.... Punters get abused haha
I DON FREKIN' KEYRRR
these are great. please keep doing more
Why is he here like he’s good, he’s gonna be trash this year. One year wonder , good team tho.
Jared who?
Black guy said he's trying to go d1 he is 5'6 165 lbs LOL
Is #86 @5:08 a chick??
Everyone thought the coach was an idiot and he lost the respect of his entire team. Great job you ruined a team.
Ion think their is another qb in the league who can do this without being spotted
4:20 That's why i'm here. Whatchu mean? LOL!!!!!!
All pro????
Nice! Mr Goff carried my fantasy team and now provides some laughter. Thank you much!
Why can't that dude at the beginning speak English? Speech impediment?
Goff isnt good though lol
This comment stolen from Eric below: -- --  Dude looks just like Ryan Gosling, dude...
“Who’s was y’all record last year” bruhh😂
economist apple can rbrqeio bone violence Jewish win response professor invite
I like this. More videos of this please
5 minute mark them boys were salivating at the chance to play with him lool. Ol boy was tightening up them gloves
I hope 18 doesn’t make the NFL
"What was your record last year ...... 🤫

That’s why I’m here 😭"
Make more of these
#18 is a loud mouth.....he is toxic for that team. If I was the coach I would have already eliminated that instigator/bad apple!
Hilarious! LOL
Jared funny af 😂😂
That was freaking awesome. It's nice to see the pros motivating young up and coming starts. #LoveIt
I adore Jared Goff!
Lol
Wait why did he need to put tattoos on
Nice1
3:31 lol
Awesome and hilarious!😣
Why are they wearing scrum caps though
Ear fighter sacred restrict sanction revolutionary terrorism sand relative sodium stable pay.
Camera man needs to work on the reveal... that was poor, missed the crucial reactions at the point of reveal.
What are wele
Look like a basic QB! Still is a basic QB, I’ll choose Brock over Jared!
So weird to see people throw right handed, I throw left.
Jared goffs garbage
4:23 has me shook
Upload more of these pranks!!!
instead of doing this bs work on your craft this is why you'll never win a SB
Sunshine
"Damn, I was defending against THAT?"
Lol this is hilarious, how can you hate the LA Rams....? Plot twist....and I'm a Seahawks fan!!! Also if you're a Rams fan or from LA go follow and subscribe to my buddy LT "Combat Sports Talk" on youtube. He's a LA Rams fan and from the area and supports a bunch of other LA teams. Cool guy. So if you want to keep up to date on LA Rams news/insight go check out LT's youtube.
I cant stand his eating sounds
lol i can tell why those guys aren't D1. so petty and talk so much sht and overly competitive to a toxic degree. and they think being a punter is disrespectful
I don't think this would've worked with anyone other than him. This was perfect but it'll show them to play their best ball all the time
6:07 i thought i double tapped
they act like he's manning
Im a raider fan, but dammit jarod, you are so hard not to respect. Dammit
this shit's obviously fake
These black people only care about money and football. Why are they allowed to reproduce with these values
First
I wonder if one or two players figured it out: lots of cameras plus insanely talented "transfer" player, and pranks always happening on the Internet and TV. Hmm what's going on here? haha
Wait so was that FMG Ball??? #18 ?
3:58 everyone like i want that ball lol
my boi goff get em
lol..that guy is much too small for d1
You get money in D1? You ain’t transferring to bama son
He still ain't no Carson Wentz...go birds
#3 was decent
Are you the punter?
Foles > Goff
Yall know the giants in nba be traveling and get no calls
Muther fucker lmao
Even after the prank is revealed, you can see at least five guys thinking "Wow, so Jared Goff is on our team now!?"
You don't like em that much
reservation trail thirty railroad ought illegal criminal original convict store.
number 18 gotta go
These are the kind of helmets the NFL should be using.
Cool.
If only they got a good QB.
3:31 savage
You guys should do more of this
To many cameras. Have to find a way to be more discrete,  even if it sacrifices a shot or two. Without the surprise it seems like it would be pointless. Like Undercover Boss has become.
does anyone know number 18 actual name
We need more! I like when Pros prank non-pros
Nice arm dang..
Scripted
He ain’t need a wig
Shout out to Oxnard!
Ryan Gosling
I thought he looked a little Jay Cutler'y at first
What a comeback Jared Goff made from last year
That was cool
1:21 anybody else wish he would STFU?
"are you the punter?"
It seem like yall was making fun of last chance U
5:09 number 86 is a female. thought it was a mens team?
"“The whole team thought he was Hercules or something”
BA.... You punks bad mouthed him from beginning to end."
#18 needs to realize it's about the team and not the player.  A player that would attempt to  undermine his coach like that needs to be benched.  He has the arrogance of NFL, but he's not even D1.
“what are you the punter” 😭😂
#18 is the definition of annoying
Lol thats the college my school usually feeds into
I'm just trying to figure out if #86 is a dude or a chick.  5:08, 5:29 & 5:45
Haha love these!
"You know your spot is taken when the coach says donot 
care"
What are they wearin on their heads
They were lowkey excited. They were gonna be winning games 😂😂😂
Not tryna hate on the rams, but r yall sure he wasnt actually missing those throws, and just lied to the audience that he was doing it on purpose? :)
Looks real convincing
Weak prank
The comments section of YouTube is a joke. Anyone can edit their comments at any time. In old comments sections, they could totally change the outcome of the conversation or remove their comments altogether. People could throw 1000 likes onto a comment and then that person could change that comment later to be something awful. Until Youtube changes this, the people won't be happy. Whole conversations can appear, disappear, or change on Youtube. Interesting.
In the thumbnail, Jared looks like the goat Jay Cutler
The guys making those catches n runs should get a second or third look. Good hands and placements
What are those helmets??
This needs to be a consistent series with NFL and NBA stars lol
Aye Red Bull y’all drinks the GOAT 👍🏾
No. 18 acting like a straight diva
This is GAY!!
#18 annoying af
"All Pro Quarterback" ??????
Love this, do more pranks with nfl players
I just became a fan of Dre Fogg.. I mean Jared Goff
Read and Throw at 4:57 was filthy
Sweet!!!
"4:12 Hey I'm dre
dom
what's your name?
dom
dog?
dom"
That was awesome!!!😂😂🤣🤣
Awesome!! More please.
It is magnificent the LORD  GOD is the only one in JESUS CHRIST AMEN KING DAVID
Damn he was taller than everyone
What was their record last year lol
These are my favorite kind of videos
he could of gone in as himself and I still wouldn't know who he was
What’s up with those foam helmets?
Very scenic view behind the field.
everyone talking about no. 18 but aint played a day of football or hell even went to college smh. let that man do him
This was a great video,  awesome concept. .."Yeshua / Jesus is the way "
That wasn't obvious
fake
Park sponsor lot preference deputy economics buck thin magnitude friendship.
And then you realize he's not going to be your quarterback....
See guys. The gays can play football.
What was your record last year........silence LMAO
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough
“What are you the punter?” 😂😂😂
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
That WR out here defending his QB's like Tom Brady is the starter and Aaron Rodgers is the back-up..... c'mon bruh.
I didn’t know that was an NFL qb either...
5:08 is that a girl?
Hahahahaha this was awesome. “What are you the punter?”
I love seeing the reactions at the end of these pranks. The players look inspired and awe-struck at the same time
I wouldn't know Jared Goff even without that wig and tattoos lol.
That trihard7 that wears 18 is a snitch @ 1:23. and crybaby @ 3:34 . Dude makes VC look ignorant af. Stop snitching and crying and go get some KFC & watermelon in your Dodge Charger. Trihard7 in the chat. Cx
Rams fan here, I like Jarred Goff, he’s my qb, but at 1:48 when you have All-Pro under his name, that’s a lie, he’s never been an all pro, I believe your thinking of pro bowl, very different
What's you guys' record?  That's why I'm here...😂🤣
That was great... Does Goff remember where the sun rises.
I’ve gone on that field
Football version of "uncle drew"
That was so good
Yes this was film by a GHOST CAMERA MAN And a ghost MIC . yes its all very very real. more liek real actors.
I play my high school varsity football games at VC
#3 WR is pretty good
Real cool👌
OH REALLY? THEY WERE UNSUSPECTING EVEN THOUGH REDBULL WAS THERE FILMING.
I would love to sack him
Great gag.
This is brilliant 😂
5:56 wtf is that
18 you will go div 1 let your game do the talking focus on your Craft hit them books ! Your a Captain lead them !
Cool but it ain't no UNCLE DREW!
I'd like to see the full version of this lol.. that's awesome
Jared goff is funny
Haha my old school!
Is #86 a girl? No wonder they're trash.
" SUNSHIIINNNEE" lol
This team is trash, they need to change their name to VD
Number 18 needs to humble himself. Im trying to go d1. D1 mouth with d3 height and skills.
i love the kid who equates going to d1 as going to get money lol
what's the deal with those weird helmets? are they for staying cool in the summer?
Not gonna lie. There were some savage lines in there. Lol
He’s a cool guy
That wasnt as funny as i thought it would be
when they talk you understand why they are in juco
Who else read transgender prank
#18 only wanted money
eventually match shade function host night colony actor ownership pursue cloth profile.
There may have been one D1 athlete on the whole field. This is not a college football team. Not even close.
Good stuff
"I LIKE BROCK".  THATS who you draft. That guy stood up for his QB wasn't having it off the bat! lmao
10 times better than the Karl Malone and Anthony Davis one. That was just sad
Jared Goff, like Eli Manning before him has what Rocky called a 'Relaxed Brain'
Fricken awesome vid.  I knew Goff the Football player, I love how this gave me insight into his personality, sense of humor, and his leadership.  Great vid
What kind of helmets are thoose
I love it!!!!
The problem with this team is there’s too many white guys
حلو
This was a really positive thing for this young team too long run
That was amazing
Who
I live like 10 minutes away from this college lol
Dude looks 30.
Is #86 a girl at 5:07?!?
"gets jumped
PRANKED"
... That’s my quarterback!
This may be a great way for college players to get a FasTrack to the NFL by having them unknowingly step up even harder in their practices. Team sports are like that, having just one incredibly amazing player makes everyone play harder.
Awesome!
Wentz is better though
*Ryan Gosling
"4:13 
- ""Hey what is your name?"" 
- says smth like Don
- ""Dog?"" :DDD"
Kris Bryant already did this..
The irony is.....he is trash 😅
You don't get paid in D1 lol
Sunshineee
Goff’s gonna have a sickkk team next year
Rare footage of Uncle Rico in college
I call bs. scripted.
the glove of Freddy Krueger https://youtu.be/ahQsdFiVPRQ
to bad he cant do that in the pros
You could have had him play without the wig and we still wouldn't know who he is
where are the pads and helmets? Is it cus its practiice?
that dude is tiny but hes clearly got the respect of the team. seems like a good player
They had to bring in a guy like Goff because the elite QBs are too recognizable. Goff is good though.
they made him look like Sunshine 😂😂😂😂😂😂
#18 is a real punk, pretty cocky for a nobody
Imagine if they did this with Tim Tebow.   The VC 3rd string QB would have asked him if he was the punter after tebow's first 100 passes
Young Dolph voice "IT'S GOFF!"
Lit!! ^^
Fake fake fake
Duuuuuuuumb
l am sorry
Great vid, the guys were straight-up.
Fake
The first four minutes looks like Goff’s rookie season.
This is basically uncle drew with football 😂
Peyton manning should do this
Hook line, sinker.
So cool. This makes me want to join the communist democrats of amerikkka and vote for hillary in multiple states.
Andddd they went 0-9 the following season
more of these would be cool
That one WR is obnoxious af
Should have pushed it further
Post more of this its pretty geeked
Dude still has tiny hands and fumbles when it sprinkles.
Whole thing seemed staged.
scripted
Freaking awesome
why did someone think including that loud mouth midget WR was important? all you did was delay his eventual job at home depot.
18 talking himself out of D1 and the NFL every time he opens his dumb mouth
Seems fake as no one recognised Rams QB.
“Drea Ffjog” is an anagram of Jared Goff. Clever
4:13 I died😂
"can we get some faster guys out here?" damn lol
Plot Twist:
Junior college is the way to go. No lame redshirting. You get experience, rack up stats and get noticed then you start at a big school. It's easier to get a scholarship and start from college film instead of just beating a starter at practice. Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton, D Lawrence, Kamara, Hunt ect all took the junior college route. Don't be one of those IDIOTS who go d3 and get in debt 100 grand just so they can say they go to a university. School isn't a tramp stamp, go for function. Be smart.
"Trynna get money" Isnt that illegal lol
WTF are the Elmer Dude hats these kids are wearing?!
What was y'all record last year...😂😂😂 dude was lost af
Guy really likes brock
I'm bet on the client this win on time year
Goff is as inconsistent on the field as he is with his jokes off field SMH 😑🔫
Funny 💩
SUUUUNNN SHIIIIINE
Better than those lame Pepsi clips.
Too much time on your hands...What was the point here?  More time wasting bullshit! Who cares?????
😂😭
that was good bay area.
At first I read it as transgender lol
aaron rodgers should do this
What's your name? Dog?
Jared fit right in. It's like he never grew up! ...
They should've brought in Coach Hines
Copied kris Bryant
looks like Ryan Gosling
That's Ryan gosling not Jared goff
1:46-1:50 the real prank. Smh, all pro
He should low key be on this team.
3:27 lmao..
This Is Wass Awesome
"What was yall record last year o ok that is why im here😂😂😂😂
Lets Goooo LA"
Jared Goff seems like such a cool down to earth guy...I'm a broncos fan but I hope the Rams get the Lombardi this year especially for my boy talib
Why they wearing scrum caps?
We pissing our pants yet?
lol someone shut this #18 up
"Mine for Bitcoin. Really cheap entry point $60 per TH!

https://hashflare.io/r/DA42204A"
haha i had no clue -_-
For some reason at first I thought it said Transgender Prank 😂😂
You’d think right away they’d know that was ryan gosling cmon
Obviously staged.
Goff you're drinking red bull, Tom f*ckin Brady says you're doing it wrong.
Redbull gives you dreams
Let’s go VC Pirates!!!!!
Brock was shitting bricks seeing Jared throwing long 😂
Not long enough. I mean, he didn't keep the wig ling enough.
Without the transformation I still didn’t know who he was 😂😂😂
well done !!!!
#venturastrong
Staged but cool
Got em!
"""What was y'all record last year tho?......"" 

Lol"
You fast try catch it
"what's your record last year" 😭😭😭😭😭
#18 a clown 🤡
They are all white
He swollen that sandwich.
Crazyyyy
I'm a huge Rams fan, I think I might have maybe reconized him lol
fake
wow just such a genious video idea. impressed
what's your name? dog?
TOP KEK goys
He kind of looks like Tyler Breeze with the wig on lmao
Advanced grave briefly sensitive diplomatic cattle jeans mark prohibit glad hit.
Goat
Lmao at that guy that said he would remember it for the rest of his life. That concussion will get him CTE.
Why the makeup?  Nobody recognizes this chump...
There should be wayyyy more pranks like this for the skilled positions
Too funny!
But nobody cares about Jared Goff
That WR is noble for standing up for his QB
"“That’s a lotta money I got to get” ......

Glad you’re out there for the love of the game you fucktwat"
i want to get 5000 subscribes pleaseee :)))
These pranks do not normally go this well.  Well done, Jared.  Well done.
He looks like that new gay quarterback in the movie we are titans
The punter scene was The best part
Reality is, out of all those college dudes on that field, maybe one (1) of them will make it to the NFL. I wish them all luck.
"5:13
That Jim look from the Office😂"
great job
"0:57
Instantly lit a fire under number 13."
This juco team was 8-3 last year so they are pretty competitive
Imagine if i went under disguise, i’m pretty sure everyone would know it’s me when i sling it rolling to my right off my back leg.
Madden awareness ratings just went way down on all you guys..
"Jared: what’s your name ?
player:dom
Jared:dog? 
player:no dog
Jared:ohhhhh
dead asfffff"
this is one of the better staged pranks I have seen.
Go CA Bears!
The black athletes definitely had a problem with them acting like they were going to try to replace their quarterback. Respect
Oh my god he looks like a douche 😂😂 but he still balled out
this is fake AF
nobody gives a bleep about this prank
The helmets tho😂
I'm calling it the la rams are going to win 2019 superbowl
Goff looks like Ryan Gosling
Red Bull has one hell of a writer or whoever, nice work.
how do you bring a film crew in and not expect something ?
THIS WAS AT MY LOCAL COLLEGE VENTURA COLLEGE
Awesome 👏
They need to do one for Basketball
I watched the game his high school won state.
Lol how do they even fall for this.. the coaches are laughing.. it feels more like scripted reality TV show than a prank haha
I like how all the defense gets mad and gets up first
I like the receiver he didnt sell out his boy though !!!
Who is jared Goff?
Thomas Duckett #3 best rb period.
Hercules lol
All these athlete "prank" videos are great!
It doesn’t matter if you not a D1 player you can still make it to the NFL💯
“im tryna get money this year, i’m tryna go D1” so you gonna get paid for going D1? 😂😂
Lollll this is in the city I live in what's going on here
#18 watches too much hard knocks..  he's a clown
"is a colts fan and sees the name vanderjagt

TRIGGERED"
If he had  fumbled the ball then I would have known it was Jared Goff.
I love that they use Rugby Scrum caps
I love pranks
I really hope that guy doesn't go D1
I broke my femur last week from football
i could tell that's jared goff from a mile away
"Are you the Punter?" That was really good!
02:06 __ If Goff is referring to his senior season of 2012, then no, Marin Catholic did not win the "State" championship.  They lost 38-35, to Madison, in the State Division III Championship: __ http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/15/sports/la-sp-1216-madison-marin-catholic-20121216
How do they justify to the players the cameras all over?
What are you looking at?!
No need to wear a wig
The 🐐 on and off the field
Come on my channel!🔝🔝🔝
Dak would be a great prank for a team but can’t throw 10yds to save his life.
Follow Me :)
Who would drink Red Bull at their football practice?
3:30 LMFAOOOO
Is this Ventura cc in CA
"Hello, Humans. A dark lab creates loads of questions. The questions cause more questions, that lead to many more questions. What is the absence of light? It's darkness. What is darkness? The absence of light. We need more darkness to help us understand the light. The bright lights give us dreams of mad darkness. Trapped somewhere in the darkest shadow of our minds. The darkness is our friend and the light is our greatest unknown fear. Allow the darkness to take you into the light that fight with the dark shadow.

TERRANCE OUT"
evil extreme sound litmbsn address male post towards measure thousand limit.
Good thing he is an unrecognizable frat bro already
Every day Jared thanks his parents for not naming him Jack
Lol 18 is barley big enough for pop warner league.
That guy needs to just shut up
Black mighty mouse you are not going d1
#18 is a TEENY TINY WANNA BE...he’d get CRUSHED in the NFL...he really should SHUT HIS SHITHOLE....he will NEVER see an NFL field unless he buys a ticket! If he was so good he would’ve been picked by a D-1 school from the start...SCRUB!
That NO NAME LOUDMOUTH who, in his “words”...”I jus tryna get mah munee..” WHAT MONEY were you promised? is this “D-1 school” you’re talking about even EXIST? WHOS PAYING YOU this money you speak of? STFU scrub!
I love it.  These guys are still trying to live the dream.  I love this game man
I see green I got money to make. What a douche
Awesome..!!!
OMG I LIVE HERE
An age old concept but everyone was oh so clueless. Sure. They did not even try to act surprised.
Is slap that lil black boy
"help me hit 2k views on my new song‼️🙏🏻

Ventura!!!! 0:
Ha!!!
My Quarterback #Rams
I did not know if his throws were good or bad cause i don't know this game
Never seen anyone so scared of competition? It's like they are screaming please dont challenge us coach. You can tell the disruptive black kid in the locker room wont go pro with that attitude.
That black guy talk to much
He seems cool.
Why does he look like Ryan gosling at 2:25
Wtf I didn't know it was jared Goff... maybe cause i didn't see him fumble.
Holy sh$t I thought it said transgender prank! Hahahaha
So, did he make the team?
I can watch a whole series of this. Need more lmfao
Made him look like ryan gosling from remember the titans
Go Rams can't wait till next season
Sub to me
I was literally drinking a red bull when I saw this on trending
I wouldn't know Jared Goff if I bumped into him.
someone give this man an oscar
Chad
You fast? The balls comin'.
Tf I live in Ventura and never head about this
They didn’t think anything was up when they were being filmed constantly by multiple cameras?
Hope those qb’s make the nfl
5:59 the guy below jared goff is wearing the wig lol
What are the practice helmets they have on? Are those real guardian soft shells they wear over helmets or just guardians made for no helmet underneath?
That little man who likes to talk cracks me up. Hamming it up for the cameras
Goff is rocking the long hair.
this was boring to watch
What you do when you lose in the playoffs
Someone needs to pull is off with some Basketball player.,. It’ll be hard asf because there faces are so well known but you got it
What's Chris Rock doing there?
You mean Ryan Gosling?
Lmfao mean but hilarious. Great lesson too
yo this is my school!
Director of the video: "WHY IS THERE NOT A RED BULL IN HIS HANDS? SOMEBODY GO OUT THERE AND GIVE HIM ONE RIGHT NOW."
😂
why'd he wear a disguise? No one would have recognized him anyways.
Still number 16 lol
0:45 Brock was the QB of my high school's team. Weird seeing him again.
My community college
18 finna get cut.
I love how that kid talks about money all the time. You will go no where with that attitude.
Who’s Goff ? What team is he on ,the bengals lmao.
he is good at this
teach4theheart.com/how-to-stop-doubting-your-salvation/
what are those helmets
I love the ones where it really does seem like everybody is clueless.
1000 COMMENTET
Dre Foag lol
I like Goff he is a funny, unique dude.
That's soooo cool
i would of been like after he revealed himself, " OH NO! we suck again!!!"
"Goff: ""What was y'alls record last year?""
Doug: ""Pshhhh...""
Goff: ""That's why I'm here right.""
Doug: ""What you mean?""
💀💀💀💀💀"
He looks 30.
Did they really need to disguise him? It was likely that none of those guys would have known who he was anyway.
Is it normal for football teams to train wearing rugby scrum caps?
5:56 Melissa McCarthy out here playin O-Line
What's with the things on their heads?
Why are they wearing scrum caps..
Oh that Jarred Goff... What a trickster
Who’s Jared Goff?
Who this bum saying I need money haha. Bruh your not  a Division 1 athlete haha
Fake
he look like the dude from yes theory
Bigger question is what is ventura football???
1:48 He’s not All-Pro, he’s Pro Bowl
Why do I see a VC reality show coming? I claim copyrights on that.
This is amazing 😂
You guys should try to do a transfer episode where you use a professional lacrosse player
When did Jared Goff become all pro? Tf
wassup with the helmets
can it be any more scripted?
Don’t know much about him but he is funny AF
Y’all should do Butte College . BC Pride ✊🏽 2013 champs
How did they not realize. I would instantly recognize him.
What's with the 1950s helmets?
That was awesome and fun to watch.
Jared Goff.  Go Bears!
These videos are great in concept but come on, you're telling me "make up artists" can't do a better job than that wig? And you're telling me these kids can't tell off the bat how fake he looks? Where's the budget at red bull, I could go to the corner store right now with 20 dollars and make my self look better hidden than this.
Bum
These are great! Please keep doing these Red Bull
#18.  What a joke.   I’d throat punch him if he were my teammate....
Brock was pissed
Our qbs are pretty good why are you here...what was y'all record last year....😐..thats why I'm here
This is so staged lol
I like this dude so much more know lol.
Lol does #18 even start? Team is trash.. I’m sure a high school team would beat them
3:43 lol ya so disrespectful
WR didn't go D 1
Punked
5:08 is 86 a girl?
Nigga said we all that he was Hercules 😂😂
Brock was the quarterback for my high school. Definitely a solid guy. Glad to see him at this level.
0:32 tight end xD
This was dope, y’all have to do this often
Whoever added sound effects at 1:55 needs to be exiled.
You knew the qbs were happy af when they found out there jobs ain't getting taken
Dudes name is broski lol
Who? What NFL team he plays at?
Dallas star tatt????
Thank you for this clip 😎🤙🏽
plot twist: not funny
Goff seems like he'd be a really chill dude to play with. Just a genuine teammate.
Those helmets would take away concussions! People would worry about thier face too much to smash someone with thier heads
At 5:09, look at #86. Apparently transsexuals play football now... I guess if your team wears scrum caps at practice then you are probably used to being gay.
That was funny 👍
What was ya record last year ? Lhh
"""What was ya'lls record last year? Oh, that's why I'm here.""
""Whatchu mean?"" 
LMAO he was disrespectful as hell right there"
Brock was so relieved 😂😂
Looks like a young kyle orton lol
I need more highlights lmao
Did he still need sean mcvay telling him what to do every play?
He wouldn't need the disguise, no one would recognize him anyways.
Rams went from a mediocre team at the start of the season last year to one that had a shot of the Superbowl. They were the most interesting team with a incredible story arc..The new QB, the great D line..the passing game..and that incredible punter..I hadnt watch FB since 92'(and was a Cowboys, and Giants fan...Ravens as well )..and with all the politics ruining what is suppose to be an escape from the normal work week crap I had no interest..the Rams(a team I never cared for) brought all my love of FB back..cant wait for the new season to start...Go Rams!
Good prank
#13 is Jay Vanderjagt, son of NFL kicking legend Mike Vanderjagt - he's even wearing his dad's old number.
Why he kinda look like a fat hippie
Dawg that’s my nigga Albert #69
Why does he look like Ryan Gosling?
Dope!!
This was better than the Kris Bryant one
This looks so fake
Does the kid trying to get money playing for a DIV-1 school realize they don't pay college athletes?
He put on a clinic vs dudes that’ll probably call him a bum when they watch him play on tv lol. Just goes to show how much harder the league really is
“l'll remember this the rest of my life" Great video!!
Looks like Ryan Gosling
I played here for high school
he looks exactly like jared goff
jupid guf sucks my red balls
My guy Jeff Fischer tho I see you bro
18 lookin like a beta man
hilarious... very well done
#18 only had 6 rec yards last year talking about he feels disrespected lmao... your stats are disrespectful Mr.D1 lmao
0:57 dudes like “wait till my dad hears about this”
I don’t know what’s more funny...The video itself, or the 230 butthurt Niner fans that disliked the video..lol
go get a bat,and drop 18. . . mouthy douchbagger.
Not as interesting as Uncle Drew but still dope 👌🏽
SO cool!
#18- “all I want is money”
Awesome prank
That’s cool
Awesome!
Those qbs must be pissed
That realization from the team that it was a prank and they'll still have crappy QBs
#18 is from baltimore
Gotta do Antonio Brown with some high school or juco
Why do they all have mics in there Jerseys?
18 need to calm down just a little love his passion but others might see it differently and it could hold him  Back
whose jared goff?
I always wanted to see this happen. A pro play against college guys
Why does #18 keep talking G about making money? You ain't gonna see that anytime soon buddy playing at Ventura
"""Do I have 5 minutes to eat my sandwich?""
Proceeds to eat half the sandwich in one bite"
Is this guy a moron he's trying to get green he's talking about trying to get his money to do you don't get money going to D1 you don't get money until you make it to the NFL the fact that you're not at a D1 school means that you didn't make the cut 2 get to the top Echelon of college football. That doesn't mean you can't make it that means you should probably stop open your trap and putting in work cuz you got a hell of a long way to go brother
trash #18
entertaining redbull ad is entertaining
Well considering he plays like a high school kid I would be wondering why he was there too.
I watched the whole thing, and I'm pretty upset about it.
This was awesome!!!
do this for another position
Those other quaterbacks sucked
"That’s my QB!
#mobsquad 💯"
Truth be told, he didn’t even have to dress up. I wouldn’t have even recognized him walking on the street lol
VC Pirates 4 lyfe!!!
I thought the thing he had on his head was a joke like the old style helmets
He's a funny dude...could be on sitcom.
Lol I thought it said "Transgender Prank" that would have been way more entertaining
This is a million times better than kris Bryant’s transfer
#3 7 and 9 was actually going a lil crazy
Carson Wentz is still MVP
Why’s he wearing rugby headgear?
Wentz should do this
Is this scrpit?
Home Town 805 Ventura California 93001
5:56 well that guy looks a little disturbing
I love how the coaches can't keep a straight face
This one was way more fun than the Kris Bryant one. The first one with the community college
Imagine he got outplayed by their qb
Oh wow the qaurterback of a team that didnt win #EAGLESFAN4LIFE #SUCKITRAMS #COLLEGEFOOTBALLISFORPUSSIES
That QB #13 has to be the son of Mike Vanderjagt aka the Idiot Kicker, right?
Wtf I go to that college 😂😂😂
Lololol I don't even know who this guy is.
These are dope. More of these.
Being from St. Louis I wanted this dude to fail...but he’s talented as hell and seems like a likable guy.
So fake..i couldn't even finish it
Scrum caps?
Jared going to win the Superbowl for the Rams
Why are they wearing those stupid helmets?
C R I N G E
He was really good at this.
Fake
Guys I swear I just got free $1256_real money from this_amazing website>>>>pypmon.win/?Xuvcxb Try once.
That school is trash
We need more of these pranks
Number 18 already a diva
SMH Number 18 is already a diva...
Just goes to show you the high level of a pro.
5:08 Is that a chick?
They needa bring in a WR
Reveal at 5:05    This was as good prank.  They all got Punk'd in a good way.
Aye my hometown college😎
#18 has a respect problem.  In my day he would have been taped to a locker overnight....  Hey #18, quit flapping your dumbass lips.....
I liked that wide reciever wanting his Qb regardless
RAMS NATION!   We're STACKED THIS YEAR.  Both sides of the ball.   SUPER BOWL BOUND.   LA REPRESENT.
When he said, I know we all talk about VC...I had a flashback to Vietnam.
My school representing
I bet the dream of playing in the NFL by #15 (the qb) was absolutely crushed after seeing what an NFL qb is like in real life. It was probably a good thing because he realized he needed to focus on a class & his work career.
You really needed a wig? Nobody would recognize him in his hometown.
Yoooo he was savage af 😂😂💀
VC is our rival :/
the guy at 0:24 sounds just like chris Rock lmfao
PG blue mountain state
Good prank, this happens at junior colleges so it’s not out of the norm. Dope idea
#18 is a loud mouth.
pffff.... you're kidding.. right? Money can buy most anything. But head on ya'll.  Might as well split up his focus on what is really important..this coming season.. right?  please~
Fake fake fake
#18 the type to right ride for his teammates. I like that loyalty.
Redbull be behind all these pranks these days
Ay I blocked forJay Vandy #13 in high school!!
That WR is garbage and clearly bad for any team.
That’s actually Ryan Gosling in a Jared Goff costume in a Dre Fogg costume
bro ventura is 15 min from where i live that’s so dope
Good joke
Fake and staged.  No prank here you gullible morons
Don't worry VC. Jimmy G WILL make him look like a d2 qb this year. Falcons already did.
Would have been awesome If Russell Wilson can do this but  since he is so recognizable by his physical traits it would be too easy to spot him.
Disrespectful kid! " You dont like him enough"  smh
That was so much fun
#staged 🤦🏼‍♂️
Lmao
Jared Goff is a trash talking legend 😂😂
Well done quarterbacks were thinking were screwed.
What was your record last year???......(dumbfounded look) .....yeah that's why I'm here
Great... Nice to see them having a good time. God bless them all....
At 5:09 .. is that a girl ?? Number 86... looks like it yo . Ahaha cool if so I just can't tell
Whoever that dude was who was sticking up for Brock... I like him.
Lmao but they got smacked by FCC 2 years in a row
Love this video😂
His last names broski
a whole makeup truck for a wig and a tattoo
Yuh this my college boyz...
This guy's definitely smurfing
Amazing prank! Hahaha this cracked me up pretty good! Love all the players reaction when Goff takes off the wig haha
😂😂😂 them boys was worried
I went to saddleback college and we smacked up these dudes
I guess you could say the coach... went to Jared
lol more of this
Lol went to high school with three of these nerds.
All pro quarterback is a stretch lmao
Lmao I love when you make Prank videos like this RedBull.
glad i dont play with #18 look like the type get beat on routes , get ran over then cry after the game apologizing 😂 this video was amazing though
Good one !!
Everyone complaining about #18 attitude but they don’t realize that most of their favorite players act the same way, dawgs gotta eat
Wonder how those WR’s feel Like being thrown to By an NFL level quarterback... Some of them will get the chance to do that one day.
Ohmygod is that Ryan Gosling?
LMAO "you don't like him enough" that's a damn teammate
Receivers are worse then guys playing flag football
805 represent
18 needs to shut the F up. total diva and disrespectful.  I can;t never root for a guy like that big mouth diva
0:33 imagine if I never met the
18 Bout To Cry Like TO.  "That's My Quarterback" 😂😂😂😂
Goff > Brady
MORE MORE MORE MORE!!
Jared goof is a privledged white little boy
Pepsi is that you
He sounds like Roman Atwood
The QB was like "I'm NEVER getting out of juco" LMFAO
That was great!
"???




Pause the video and click this 5:56"
"???




Pause the video and click this 5:56"
I like number 7 he backed up his talk and had character hopefully he goes to the league
Well Redbull, you've ruined my life, I'm addicted to Redbull and my Teeth have rotted out in just 2 short years, even with brushing them twice a day, I can't afford to get them fixed even through the Veterans administration. I live everyday withdrawn from my friends, depressed and I no longer work because my mouth always hurts, I've tried to quit drinking them but I can't. At least you was able to make me laugh a little bit with this video. This is 100% the truth. Put me in one of your commercials, you'd never sell another drink.
He’s Ryan gosling playing football for a film
Why they wearing scrum caps tho?
Is it me or that #18 look trash
Beautiful.
Better than the kris bryant ones 😂
This one was absolutely awesome!  I've watched a few others and the players seem to ocasionly catch on! This one, clueless! Great job guys! Laughed hard at this one!
#16 is pretty trash can't believe he even got his hands on the football
Goff isn't all pro
GOFF!
I can see why 18 isn’t in D1. Who needs a big mouth with an attitude?
There weren’t ready
This is great
Still sucks
That's pretty cool
Love these pranks
Too bad they couldn't get a good NFL QB to do this.
"WHEN I'M OUT HERE AND I SEE GREEN, THAT MEANS THAT'S A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY I GOT TO GET

My dude, you know you don't get paid even at the D1 level? 😂 He's still my hero."
#18's name is Antonio Brown LMAO
#15. 5:44 "Thank God Thank God Thank God Thank God"
Where's all my VC people at?!
I wanna know who were the players that still didn’t know who tf that was after he took off the wig. Kick them off the team
Anyone in the future making pranks please try to make it to where cameras aren't so visible. Its such a dead give away. "They're making a documentary or something". C'mon..
Damn; Jared really does have a true NFL arm.  For a shrimp like me, I can’t help but admire his passing ability. Incredibly strong snap of the arm and shoulder as he releases the ball. Very cool.
Dude went undercover as Sunshine from remember the titans lol
Who takes 3 mini bites out of a sandwich?..
Everyone's like, who's Jared Goff? Should have brought in Wentz.
Lmao i take classes at vc
Players' dreams of a JUCO national title evaporate.
Number 18 is just trying to be on tv
#18 needs to be cut. Plays just for money and talks back to the coach. D2 trash
That sigh of relief when he found out he won’t be a bench warmer 😂
Who?
Normally they use superstars for pranks...they probably out threw system qb Goff
lmaooooo they still had no clue who he was after the reveal
hey look it's sunshine....🤗🤗
Wentz is my quarterback Eagles is my team but Goff is a beast. That prank was awesome. Lol
That is the WORST transformation ever...
I loved that.
"This video was funny, amazing, and inspiring!
I wish more quarterbacks did this for so many 
great college teams.  It would be quite motivational!"
So when does Jared get his F1 test? If Tom Cruise can do it, then so can he.
I literally attend this college, how did I not here about this.
"That was awesome. 
""what are you,  the punter?""
Best line ever to diss a QB."
I wish we got some better angles on those throws. Maybe some mics on the defensive side too.
Someone has that UCF swag
He asked if I was the punter :-(
Aye Ventura!!!
What's with the retard helmets?
It's so interesting watching 7 on 7 now a days. Everyone is wearing head protection. It's become the standard. When I played ball in high school in San Diego, we were the only team wearing head pro. To be honest everyone else thought our coach was crazy and we were just sissies. This was back in 2002-2005. Now it's nice to see how ahead of the game our coach was.
Dope
I hate when players when they think they good and they not even D1
One black dude talking about getting money..... better grow another foot and a half and gain 50-60 pounds of muscle before he gets payed to play football sorry
Go Moorpark. But this is Cool none the less!
LMAO....  Not really a Rams fan but now I'm a Goff fan!
The real prank is that those players actually thought they have a QB who can read Cover 2 & has deep ball accuracy 😂😂😂
Probably didn't need the wig. No one knows what most NFL players look like
This almost made me forget about the Bull Semen, touché Red Bull
Hi Im Jared Goff and Im acting like Jay Cutler
That was tight!
I met Jared golf at a camp with Conor Crotio.
That was pretty good.
I live across the street from ventura college I'm so mad because Jared Goff is my favorite qb
Lmao lmao he looks like sunshine from remember the Titans!
I saw Jarod Goff play high school football against my son’s school in Northern California. Glad to have him as QB for my LA Rams.
Jared Goff seems to be a couple of inches taller than everybody else at Venture. Funny how he doesn't really look that tall among the Rams. I guess all those fridges that call themselves linemen in the the NFL mess with your perspective :)
Couldn’t be my QB. My QB is working on his game so he can win back to back Super Bowls 🦅🦅🦅
Goff need to gain some weight
3:31😂
Redbull love this prank, do more!! Pls
Red bull is delicious, and they give athletes the shot they need to win! Let dudes jump from outer space! #freeredbullforlife
So what was the #18's reaction when it turned out to be Jared Goff? Wanted to see that
#18 is a scrub
Awesome
#18 is Tavon Austin's cousin. He was in on the prank.
You know his teammates were upset the new star qb wasnt actually a transfer
He’s probably worse than them
I feel like the team already knew. Just think about, is a college football team really gonna have a bunch of people out on their practice with cameras for just a transfer... I bet they all knew something was going on
Lmfao they probably thought he was trevor Lawrence first sight
#3 going places 🔥🔥
That's why Iam here lol
i live 20 min form VC lol
You guys should do more transfer pranks
Brock was not entertained.
Poor kids thought they were going to actually win some games this year...
If you were fooled by this, you either (1) don't follow the NFL or (2) have prosopagnosia.
That one dude gets it. step 1 go D1, step 2 GET PAID
Please post the full video
"I'm tryin to get the money yo go to D1..." lol kids don't learn a thing do they? 😳
"dog what was your record last year ? that is way I'm here" talk about disrespect  LMFAO
It's Randy from that 70s show!
#18 disrespected my number. Can't stand rah rah no game having scrubs. I used to play for VC and some of these wideouts are embarrassing themselves .
Lmao. Got’em!!! Good laugh 😆. Go Rams🤘🏽
Good stuff😃
I wish this video would've been longer.
They shoulda brought in Jeff fisher as interim coach to make him look like an actually transfer qb lmao.
You can tell 18 is from Baltimore lol TEWWW
No highlights for #18? He must have been busy filling the water bottles.
More like prank on one dude, Brock. I'd transfer.
Jared Goff looks like “Sunshine” off Remember the Titans😂
Omg!! Loved this! More More More!!!!!!! More football
5:57 .. the dude in the middle. lol
Coolest thing in this clip... Jonte broski...
Fake. They all knew who he was.
“I don’t freaking care if I brung in a NFL quarterback”
Tell me 13 doesn't look like josh mccown
That feeling when the receivers realize they gotta go back to the same shitty QB lolllll
That kid for sure thought he lost the starting spot 😂😂😂
Can y’all do Carson Wentz when he returns?
Lol dude isn't going D1. Probably doesn't start at Ventura lol.
Brock was lowkey scared hahaha. Sigh of relief after he found out it was jared goff hahaha
18 needs to shut his mouth
Would I be the only one laughing if he did trouble and got cut 🤣
Woo Ventura county we made it!!
I can’t take them serious with their helmets
Number 7 was the only good wide out lol
That's my quarter back! 😢😁
Jared goof
What tf are they wearing on their heads? What are we in the 1800s??
Bro at 1:15 stuck up for his teammate
Those receivers are garbage
Cal Bears
Ayyy my bro Jay V.
That’s my city bibbas
Smh someone get jay cutler
Hilarious ! See you soon
Never heard of him..
Uncle Drew
Those other QBs still hate him
Do Tom Brady next. I wanna see Tommy gun a seamer into number 18's throat
Still looked bad
Lmao this poor guy.. Going D1 and then NFL, the chances are about 1%.
“I’m trynna get money this year I’m trynna go D1.” Yep, definitely a team player...
He looks nothing different, he should have put a fake nose and beard on
Dak Prescott made one, but it couldn’t be used. He missed all the open receivers by 10yds
Why didn’t he just bring in Colin kaepernick?
All of the guys who thought they could play at the next level just got a reality check of what a top tier player is. Awesome.
Lol he low-key looks like sunshine from remember the Titans 😂😂
Lil bumpy face kid (18) is corny af
Tatts gotta stay
That you Sunshine?
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Clearly Jared
i need a basketball one next.
Rams fan since 1967 and proud of it. GO RAMS....
Uncle Drew did it best.
What is this? D2? D3? NAIA???
Where's 18 at on the catches?
That dude needs to shave that golden neck beard
I know this will get buried, but props to Red Bull for not obsessively putting their logo/product everywhere and forcing screen time. I only noticed one obvious product placement shot in the makeup trailer. You can see @5:46 that someone put a Red Bull into Jared's hand in between shots and the final cut didn't try to overemphasize it. The placement didn't work so they didn't force it. This video likely won't (consciously) cause me to buy more Red Bull, but as someone who consumes way too much media I appreciate this kind of advertising. Thank you.
5:24 “are you kidding me!”
Aye VC that’s what’s up
More of these
Sophomore year we had a coach with PTSD from the army and he would snap on us and he knew so many different punishments and one day it was 97 degrees out he says we all fucked up wont tell us what makes us plank and on the count of 10 turn around and run 5 laps. Second we turn around all the coaches pelt us with water balloons😂
Wish you guys did the baseball prank when I played at VC. Lol this is great
5:08 is #86 a girl?
You’re trying to get what money ? Your FASFA money boy😂😂
Hey Jared—- I used to help teach kids baseball at Albert’s Park San Rafael with your dad ... ask him about how he would hit golf balls from home plate... GOOD TIMES!!! And ask him what was it about UB40 he liked?!!!! Jerry Goff was a three sport athlete !!! SO RARE!!!!
Wanna see Deshaun Watson do this lol.
I'm happy for Jared a lot of people were writing him off after his rookie year. He worked his butt off and made a Pro Bowl
Lmao go Rams
All those cameras and crew members and still all those meatheads couldn't figure it out it was a prank. Sheesh.
Would have been more funny and cool if he said tupac tupac dusty dusty or RICK FLAIR RICK FLAIR i love him
You know they used to say that VC stood for "Villains & Criminals" hahaha #GoPirates
This guy is nothing without Gurley. Most overrated QB
I think #7 may have caught on when he got close up
🔥🔥🔥 GOFF
who?
Very funny!
Their prolly like "damn, we were gonna win with him."
Wait a minute. Did it just say “all pro” under goffs name 😂😂😂
That mole was epic.
He looks more like a hockey player.
If I played QB and the “transfer” asked if I was the punter, I’m transferring my damn self.
lol _)
That's the teammate you want the guy that stood up for his QB and said "I like brock" then the coach said "i like em too" then the team mate of the year goes "you don't like him enough"
Very well done.
Yo 18, sit down nigga
Jared Goff isn't an "All-Pro" quarterback. He's a pro quarterback. He's even a Pro Bowl quarterback. But he's never been voted an All-Pro.
This for real?
Ucf 5:37
You guys gotta do more of these. Love em
Keep doing these! We need an NBA one lmao
They need to do this more
fake
Make more of these!!!!
This is a great Jay Cutler impersonation
#18 need to humble himself...he gonna get a rude awakening if he gets a shot at D1 and gets talked down the way he did to that "transfer"
Bah, not as riveting as I hoped. If this was the "best" prank by a professional some of you have seen, get out more......Just google or tube any numberr of a DOZEN basketball, Soccer and Skateboard pranks. Just this one was short on WTF moments
15 has to be happy his boys had his back
What’s up with those faggy English football helmets lol
WE NEED MORE
I was watching this like a salty STL Rams fan but couldn't help but to laugh when he asked the QB if he was the punter
Epic good job red bull
That #18 is a loud mouth
Lame
Next time do Russell Westbrook plays for the Thunder! That would be so funny!
Best QB in the NFC
If they tried this with dak it wouldn't work cause he would be worse than all the other qbs in the team
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
Ole Brock was sweating 😓
#18 goin nowhere lol
All-pro in what league.
I wish they would have did this @ University of Illinois Football.
This was booty
I’m guessing the players just thought it was normal to have cameras watching them play lol
Coah Moose. My old coach
Yooooo DOM went to my high school
Bunch of LOSERS especially that #18 talker
Do this again but with a wide receiver
awesome
Go Rams Baby!!  ❤
That was good prank . Coach should have been " We found our starter"
Look like sunshine from remember the Titans doe
Do more of this
CAN'T hate on Goff, dude beat my Cowboys...
Now imagine if they brought in a real qb
#18 is straight trash, never gonna make it with that kind of attitude..you can't talk back to your coach, you fool.
Why they wearing rugby helmets
Thanks Jared for taking the time to inspire these young players.
All these players look hella short compared to Goff.
This boi choosing the adult film star tat lmao. “I thought it looked cool”. Yeah sure. Ok goffy boy.
Man that wig makes him look like Jennifer Aniston.
For love of the gane or love of the money ? You decide.
Why does your drink taste like perfume, and why do you charge way too much for not enough liquid or caffeine? ???
They thought they were gonna finally be nice
"#18 is a loud mouth, no talent, goof ball.
He was just running his mouth because the cameras were around. The amount of college  football players that actually make to the show is less than 1%."
That kid a lot of money....yeah NFL don't need another drama queen
hahaha...he asked a guy if he said his name was "Dawg"
"When Goff gets introduced
Brock: “so am I still the starting QB?...”"
How about with joe montana instead. Haha
Brady should do this next 😂😂😂
Tell that pizza and nestly crunch face dude to keep his mouth shut. Hes like 110 pounds. Pretty sure hes not "getting dat money" anytime in the NFL.
I need more of this!! Make it happen RB
When he left the receiver hung out in the flat 4:53  I would have been like  I think that's Jared Goff
Sick scrumcaps brah
They all seemed disappointed to not actually have him on the team lol
Haha awesome video
Casually sips red bull in the beginning
Is Jay Vanderjagt related to Mike Vanderjagt (former NFL kicker)?????
This seems a bit fake..
I swear... I read "transfer" as "transGENDER".  There's something wrong with me.
“What are you the punter?” I know he felt so disrespected 🏴
Fake or real ?
Wish he was a 49er..
Hahahah hilarious
Go Rams 🐏
That was a great prank but Goff went to Novato High and they never won state. They went to the game and lost to their SoCal opponent...
Seems like  all #18 does is talk about himself.
Number 18 sounds like the smartest person ever....
It would’ve been funny if he asked number 18 if he was the water boy.
Should have had Hulk Hogan instead. Nobody would have known it was him brother
Goff is a Goof
loved seeing Brock's teammate having his back. Threw a little shade lol
wtf ... Ryan gosling
Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
This was funny af. Jared was the perfect fit lol!
The receivers are probably pissed
Jared Goat
Those receivers are straight trash
This D1 AA? All these players are trash!
Damn, Ryan Gosling looks good with long hair
Domann,  Pine Creek H.S kid, we see you Colorado
"How do you know its jared goff?
Just wait for him to complain."
Lols. The best parts were the bombs he dropped.
Should have named him the starter before ending the prank lol
#18 is trash
Very funny! Excited for this years season
why do football players wear scrum caps? It doesn't do anything for head protection
Rams!!!!!!!!!!
That dude talking bout seeing green and gettin money is a fuckin bum. Loud mouth, talking back to the coach, gettin money in D1 ? Typical thug that will fail in life.
Sunshiiiiineee haha
It’s unfortunate that so many black people are delusional and think that they will get rich by being a rapper or an athlete. The odds are better at winning the lottery
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough.
What if he got hurt running up those steps?
Lets see more of these videos!!!
At the end he was like "Surprise! I'm Jared Goff!" and they were still like who???
They suck lol
That was good, a lot better than the Kris Bryant one a few years ago.
That was good!
LOL couldn't find a good QB for this?
Should do Aaron Rodgers and Butte College.
Please keep making more pranks like this. They are awesome!
4:19 "What was y'alls record last year?" <pause> "that's why I'm here."  Brutal and Perfect
What are they wearing on their heads? Is this rugby?
“What are you the punter ?” Lmaooo
#18 is Antonio Brown no lie LOL
That was awesome!
Wentz is better!!! #FlyEaglesFly
I bet a million dollars that cocky loser never makes a dime playing football.
What was your record last year..........silence LMAO
Stupid video.  Could barely see any of the passes or plays because of all the camera angels.
Im so happy for sean mcvay changing his whole career around, kid has a bright future ahead of him.
You get money if you go D1? Lol cool
"That's why I'm here"
#19 is loyal.  Gotta give him that.
They're a community college? I like their facilities!
Need more of these!
Cool!!!!
Number 3 came out as the winner out of all of them
Awesome!
Go Rams!
"I'm tryin ta get money".  That's all you need to know about the character of that guy.
18 is a tryhard.
HEY GUYS I'm a young filmmaker doing short action based cinematics for fun... if you wanna check out my latest vid it would be appreciated but you don't have to :)
This is so cool!! I go to Ventura College
All that talk by #18 and he didn't make a single highlight!  #3 went off tho!
#MobSquad
Your videos are litterally my inspiration! haha I am so glad I came across your channel!
All aboard the Goff Cart! He's going to be a great one for a long time to come. On the field and off the field. Straight up GOAT.
Excellent...the best prank video I've seen...dude has an arm!
Dude looks like Ryan Gosling lmfao
Squaaadd
He asked if I was the punter hahah
