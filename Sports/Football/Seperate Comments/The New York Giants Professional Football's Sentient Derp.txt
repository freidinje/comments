It could be worse for them.
"Funny thing is they did get rid of that derp coach, told Apple to fuck off, DRC is retired and they drafted Barkley.

Oh wait Eli Manning is still there, the o-line is fucking terrible and OBJ is still being a fucking idiot.

Crazy."
Another season, and still 1-7
I'm a giants fan and I agree. derp derp derp
"As a giants fan, this video is pretty funny until I remember that the other teams I like are the Mets, Knicks, and Rangers.

Why does god punish me like this?"
And now Dirpman is Old Man Dirpman, they are in the middle of a fire sale of anything valuable, looks like      they took a page from Sam Hinkie's playbook. TIME TO REV UP THE TANKS G-MEN!!!!!!!!
I just give up on eli and the rest of the derps
Even tho they good
Do the patriots
There goes Eli............... Apple
At least they got Saquon Barkely FivePointsVids! Does that help any? There 1-6 :/
You know what, he did call what happened in the end
Barkley is great but no money after paying that headcase WR.
dat Saquon Barkley predict tho
Wow made about a year ago and still super relevant.
My parents are huge Giants fans.  I should send this to them. 😂😂😂
Not as bad as the Jets.
Don't care have superbowls
Another example of the NFL's continued decline, NBC's refusal to broadcast Sunday Night games featuring 2 teams that aren't Dallas and/or the Giants.
2018-19 looks like more of the same, at least we can stat pad Saquon to OROY by just throwing checkdowns to him every other play and ask him to fix everything. Just keep dirping just keep dirping (dirp, dirp, dirpidy, dirp, dirp, dirp)
Can’t what to see the comments of giants fans saying they won 2 Super Bowls against the Pats (I haven’t looked at the comments)
Crazy that he called Giants picking Saquon Barkley
New York sports teams suck
I died when he said "OH LOOKS ITS ERIC FLOWERS"
"5:36 to end, and that’s exactly what happened.

Minus the bring back Tom Coughlin."
As a Giants fan, this is one of the funniest videos I have ever fucking seen. Brilliant!
0 playoff wins in 16 of the last 18 seasons lol
I mean, it was a good Rudyard Kipling poem.
Derp
The Atlanta Falcons: A legacy of Failure
I never thought I'd see the Giants suck and the Eagles win a superbowl
Why did u show the 9/11 building on fire seriously dude!
They just got saquon Barkley so their running game might be good this year 👀
Ouch I heard you 5Point
"Slogans for these New York Teams:

New York Giants - ""At least were not the Jets...""

New York Jets - ""At least were not the Mets...""

New York Mets - ""At least were not the Knicks...""

New York Knicks - ""At least we got Porzingas...""

Porzingas - ""Get me out of this shit hole of a organization...""

James Dolan - ""Porzingas will retire as a Knick. Mark my words boys."""
"“That is, of course, if we don’t waste our first round pick on Saquon Barkley...”
the New York Giants draft Saquon Barkey
Curb Your Enthusiasm theme starts playing"
I still can't understand why he would sell fake game memorabilia. Obviously he didn't need the money. So much derp.
About that Barkley pick.....
I am a Giants fan, this is my story...
Philip Rivers is a much better QB than Eli.
the best part is they actually drafted barkley
that New England prep school comment had me rolling cause there was a running joke at my middle school (Massachusetts) that the gym teacher was in fact a pedophile; it's a very accurate stereotype apparently :)
Well they now have Barkley
Love the ending, God I never get tired of seeing that.  Hope the trip to Miami was worth it for Obj & co.
You could just push Eli very light and he’ll fall over
3:35 could someone get me a link to that clip?
Ha! Ha! It’s funny because the Giants got rid of McAdoo, and did get Saquon Barkley.
1:23 I had heard of Shaun Draughn before this so jokes on you lol
2:15 hahaha
Well they ended up getting Barkley
I can say without sarcasm that this video aged well, at least up to July 2018
Ben McAdoo kinda looks like Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
"an·y·more
ˌenēˈmôr/Submit
adverb
to any further extent; any longer."
shoot eli apple :)))))))))) lol
im a Giants  fan  and  this is unarguable
I h8 the giants
3:50 I was dying right there
title made me laugh so hard
GENO SMITH!
Just came back to this. You guys did get saquan and that's the sad thing
It's funny because they drafted Barkley...
5:56 the weird thing is, I think they did all those things
Do the Buccaneers
This why I love the Giants. Because the team is a lolcow it makes them more like underdogs
Coming back to watch this and of course they drafted Barkley.
Bet fivepoints loved this
At least mcadoo is gone
"1:02  I was at that game
Fly eagles fly"
And then they actually drafted Barkley.
Well, the Giants drafted Barkley...
bro you used the fucking derp song in 2017 any opinion you have is invalid
"Hey guess what FivePoints. Your dream came true. Barkley is drafted.

And the NFC East is now slightly spooked."
Derp derp
Idc if the giants have more superbowls, the eagles own the giants
As a Dallas Cowboys fan it gave me great joy to watch that team die the slow and agonizing death it deserved
Ummmmm “all three fingers of JPP.” We’ll say goodbye to that. Hahahahahah!
derp, derp, derp-derp-dee-derp, herp sherpeh-dee derp
https://youtu.be/nQB4nAjZIdE
If Beckham gets traded I expect a full fucking screaming roast. Anything less than that and I unsub
Go die
Well all three fingers of JPP are now in Tampa.
MetLife stadium home of the derp and a butt fumble lol
GENO SMITH
The Giants are basically the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFC. Hate 'em both
Odell Beckham Jr. is "just a sliver less of a diva" than Antonio Brown. How's that looking now?
All three fingers of Jason Pierre Paul lmao
Well, at least Mcadoo and Reese are finally gone. They simply didn't work or get along with others.
Became a semi giants fan when 18-1 happened, then realized they're basically shit and went for Steelers
"Built on all 3 fingers of Jason Pierre Paul" WOW. JUST WOW.
Only good team in NY is the Yankees and sometimes the rangers, but that’s it...
I’m a giants fan from birth and we are a fucking derp lol
ITS JOHNNNNNNY FOOTBALL!!!!
Why the fuck do you bench Eli...
Shit dude good thing we have Dave gettleman and pat shurmur now
Ben McAdoo: The Ultimate Derp
I remember when someone named "Paul Perkins" was a brilliant steal in fantasy drafts.
Ben Macado is a fucking child molestor
Giants: We're having offensive problems right now. But, we have a solution. Let's start Geno Smith! 😂😂😂
"Giants sure fire to win nfc east?

Look how that turned out"
Shit made me laughing so hard LMAO
At least I got my Devils
Just draft Barkley
2:18 i wasdying i love this video
"Derp, derpety derp derp derp derp derp, derp, derpety derp........







DERP"
That's my Giants.😔
3:11 😂 Sad but true
I'm a  giants fan and this shit is hilarious
Good riddance to McAdoo...doo.
"on behalf of all giants fans,

derp"
I cringe so hard every time I hear that bone breaking sound effect.
Giants need to resign Michael Strahan, David Tyree and maybe Brandon Jacobs
Being a giants fan I fucking love this!!!
THE DERP ERA
Did the patriots lose 2 or 1 super bowl
"All 3 fingers of Jason Pierre-Paul" 😂😂
A good pick was Evan Engram
Painfully accurate... Let's just be glad this isn't about history of the franchise
2:59 gotta hurt for Giants fans. The whole receiving core died in one week. That’s impressive.
Not a lolcow yet, but theyre trying
amazing how its always bradys 'fault' if a team with no Ol-defense-and -or recievers 'only' gets to the afc title game but eli manming can have his fucking team of high talent fucking quit in week one and its not his fault?
'remember when he was fucking terrible and the giants faithful nearly ran him out of town?' so u mean every year not ned 2007 or 2011?
Ben Mcadoo sex offender profile LMfao haahaha
I'm a Cowboys fan and I want to watch the Cowboys one!
fuck you spanos!
Sad season for us. But honestly, not too far off from a playoff team. Minus the injuries, some good coaching, and a decent draft class we could be a contender again in a few years. Need to get better on both lines
As a Giants fan, I fully endorse this video.
He doesn’t get a pass from the memorabilia thing for winning 2 Super Bowls. He gets a pass for his Walter Payton MOTY award.
This is great u and 5points are hilarious my two favorite sports YouTubers “just look at all that speed”
Maybe Evan Engram
Good Picks over last 3 years: So far Landon Collins and Sterling Shepard
I'm a die hard giants fan and I was waiting excitedly for this video XDDD Im dying
4:13 Evan Engram
Fivepointvids cameo! Yay!
I'm a patriots fan and if I see a pats video from this guy I'm gonna luagh and click and lie the video
well you got gettleman back so the futures bright
3-13...welp shit
Jets lose to the Giants and say they lost due to no home advantage
A friend of mine has had season tickets for a decade and has never left during a game and has gone to a few road game
Does anyone know what song is in the background
I knew this vid was coming when we lost to the chargers
Cleveland Browns, The History of Sadness
ben mcadoo is the worst coach ever
i like to think that ben mcadoo got fired because the owner of the giants watched this video
At least we're not 0-16 cough cough Browns cough cough lions cough cough.
So much derp, I love it.
I think the Giants haven't been that bad
Eli got benche for Geno Smith...he could make a vid only about that
You can’t have Tom. He’s in Florida, he’s old. That’s like asking peanut butter to go on without jelly.
As a giants fan I agree with this video 100% and hey at least we took steps in the right direction by firing mcadoo and our gm
oof
Umm, Jerry Reese is gone, but McAdoo is gone so it's ok.
Hey at least They decided to try and clean house by firing Ben McAdoo and the bumbling idiot they call a GM... too bad they broke Eli's streak to start GENO FUCKING SMITH
McAdoo got fired. Wonder if this'll be included in the next video UT makes.
A pigfaced clown. The derp master. The luckiest qb in nfl history.
Chicago Bulls: Professional Basketball's Slaughterhouse
Jerry Reese and Ben McaDerp are gone now
"After last Sunday, expect Mr. Doo to be ""adopted"" to a nice family farm where he will run free.

Don't ask about the 2 shell casings on the floor."
"When he's not openly abusing kicking nets he's demanding to be paid all of the money"
The hammer dropped as both GM J. Reese and Coach McAdoo were relieved of their duties approx. 231pm Monday 12/4/17.
They finally fired Mcadoo
Well this video is already irrelevant,   guess the Giants saw this
Who the fuck is Eli Apple?
RIP Ben McAderp. Fired today.
Mcadoo and reese fired
And now everyone in New York is sighing in relief.
Derp, derp, derp,derp,de-derp.
and now they bench Eli... RIP there playoff chances
This was strangely predictive.
lol they got worse
I still am upset that the Giants had to snap the Patriots' undefeated streak. I mean... had the Patriots won, they would have made history but no. :(
Imagine how this would look if he made it now compared to two weeks ago?
3:41, rings so true
1:01 how prophetic you were, UT
You forgot the time they blew a 21 point lead with 7 minutes
Can you d the Lions next?
When will there be a lowcow video of the Miami Marlins?
After the Eli benching, you need to get Ben MacCadoo is own lolcow video
Breaking News: The Giants benched Eli Manning for Geno Smith.
do the Ravens and Dolphins.
And this week we actually have Geno Smith starting.  Good lord.
"You made this video 2 weeks too early
RIP Eli Manning"
They're benching Eli... For Geno Smith 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 fuck you McAdoo 😂😂😂😂
As a Jets fan this is absolutely beautiful to see. The amount of giants fans that made fun of me are insane. Now you guys are a Lolcow. Welcome to the club motherfuckers!!!! 😂😂
After Eli's benching today, Giants fans are probably gonna want a "Fuck You McAdoo" every week now.
You should have waited a few weeks to make this video if you had you could have included the Giants benching Manning for Geno.
I️ got the rangers at least
Looks like you should have waited a few weeks to make this.
You should do a video on how bad the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been through out history.Lets not forget that in their first two years of existence(1976 & 1977)they went 0-26 before winning their first game as a franchise.Then when Vinnie Testaverde showed up he couldn't stop throwing interceptions.I know this is only a fraction of what has made the Bucs awful but it's enough to warrant a video ;-)
COLTS LOLCOW WE ARE TERRIBLE, (I am a sad ,sad colts fan)
Do the chiefs! Pro football’s perpetual let down
Urinatingtree what's your favourite team
Hey Tree, you're the most underrated channels I have ever seen. Hope you get 500k+ in the next few months.
Do the San Jose sharks
Do the Chicago Bulls next.
3:13 LMAO as a giant fan that’s so fucking true
Do Atlanta Hawks!!!
Still waiting on the Detroit lions.  I know it’s low hanging fruit but sometimes it fun to hit the easy targets.
dont make fun of the giants, they broke down barriers by drafting the only quarter back with all out mental retardation
Please do my cowboys
Do one on my Cowboys since 1996, I love them but they are a train wreck!
We just need the Cowboys to complete the division. And I say they deserve one.
They lost to the niners ‘Nuff said
They lost to the niners ‘Nuff said
The Miami Dolphins: Professional Football's Japanese Food
Urinating Tree please make a vid on the flyers they fuckin suck a bag of dicks
I sense a great Derp in the Force ...
I know guys who wear sweat pants and wife beaters/muscle shirts on a regular basis.
But yet the Chiefs managed to lose to them. The Chiefs are super derp.
Do the flyers. Paul holmgren gave you plenty of material, and Ron Hextall might actually make them competent soon. Wouldn't want to miss my team get ripped to shreds for all the sadness and shitty goaltending it's forced down my throat.... FUCK YOU SPANOS
Do eagles legacy of failure
What about the Dallas cowboys?
Do the packers
Los Angeles Clippers: NBA’s sunken ship
We now derped tanking we beat the chiefs kill me now as a giants fan
How the hell have you not done the Detroit Lions?!? I already know the roast of that team would be so unfair it would redefine the term "scorched earth policy"!.
As a cowboys fan this video is awesome
Should have waited a week for them to lose to the 49ers before releasing this
My Redskins stink but I smile when I look at the Giants' record
Do the Miami Marlins Next!
LMFAO yeah the Giants have derped their way through the past decade
OBJ is a way bigger Diva than AB
derp derp derpitty derp derp!
i also feel like the Detroit Lions legacy of failure is long .... overdue
Arizona Cardinals, Tampa Bay Buccs, Houston Texans, and The Miami Dolphins are a couple you could do.
Your sports videos are helping me through my depression.
Ben Macdoo looks better in Madden than real life....
Packers next? I would love see you attempt it.
This video is perfect!!!! i have been requesting this!!!!  MORE DERP JOKES!!! Lol Love it!!!
Where is SportsBall for Week 10?
Alright pissing timber.....it is now time to deconstruct the Arizona Coyotes
I feel like the giants are the Mets of football, whatever good they had on the team (which is very little things) have been hurt and everything else is complete trash.
They fucking lost to the 49ers
Do sports ball
Do I Green Bay one. Ted Thompson needs to be ripped a new asshole and after the way you obliterated Stan Kroenke, I couldn’t think of anybody better for the job.
I'm a New Yorker and I find this utterly hilarious.
Where the fuck is Sportsball: Week 10?!?
Boy, the Browns are unlucky, they don't play the Giants...
As a fellow Pitt Panthers fan, You NEED to make a video about how shitty our attendance is and a video about us losing to damn UNC
Congrats Italy for not making the World Cup.
RIP
I am a Giants fan and this is great. I was thoroughly entertained.
Should do a video on the Cubs.  1 world series win doesn't make up for the other 107 years of failure.
I know you're not really a soccer person, but I feel like you could make an amazing video about the English National Team
Derp.
"49ers: 31

Midgets: 21"
Isn't that song the opening to Carmen San Diego?
And my Niners even beat them lol
At least they didn't go undefeated just to lose in the Superbowl.
Please pick apart my Patriots.
Do one on the College Football Playoff
This week in Sportsball What the Fuck are you doing Ginger Hammer ?? Not to mention the Patriots dismantle the Broncos and the best play of the game for Denver is Brock oswieler nailing a guy in the face with a football
Thank you for that first win, guys. Sincerely, the 49ers. PS: Are you playing the Browns this season?
ROFL Giants lost to 49ers!
Derp
You should do a video on the Toronto Maple Leafs post-1967.
Well Giants, at least your color scheme is pleasant on the eyes. Can't say the same for the Browns(BTdubs, I am a Patriots fan who relishes in the Giants complete and utter incompetence and failure, mainly because they robbed the Pats of 2 Super Bowls and a perfect 19-0 record. You guys would've been spared from the Fins bragging about 17-0 in '72 had we won. Just saying.
Just Fucking fire Mcado please
Do Baltimore Ravens next!
The moment you’re done making that video, my niners finally got a win!!!
"The Cleveland Cavaliers: Pro Basketball’s Championship - Caliber Shitshow 




As a cavs fan I really wanna see this"
As a native of Pittsburgh, what’s your opinion on Nate Peterman? I watched him play at pitt, and I think he could be a solid nfl qb if he was given a chance at Buffalo
Do the Bulls.
Holy shit i just realized im wearing an obj shirt
FivePointsVids yes!
Really liked the spongebob music on mcaBoo
And how did this guy beat Tom Brady twice in the SB again?
Dear eagles fans before you start talking shit remember 4 is better then 0
My name is also Eli. So this vid was fun
Who would have thought that the Giants would even lose to the 49ers?
And a day later this video got uploaded, the 49ers got their 1st win of the 2017 NFL season.
How do you lose to the fucking 49ners 😂😂😂😊
My dad’s an old pro... he’s been putting up with the derp since the 1958 NFL Championship Game. Not much has changed in the past 60 years. Honestly, if the Giants hadn’t played the Patriots both times, I wish they lost both Super Bowls. No mediocrity is more painful than the one induced by a couple of championships. It’s why Jerry Reese still has a job in spite of drafting like shit.
"Fuck you Spanos!
Your Chargers has just killed the Giant's season!"
Do one on the bucs? They overall deserve it.
What a good looking ending
When are you going to do the Saints. We all know that there is a lot to say about them over their history.
Are we a lolcow now?
I feel like you made this a couple days too early...
You should do the San Jose Sharks
5:07 - shove bamboo underneath it fingernails? wtf? I've never heard that expression before in my life... or did u just make that up on the spot? If u did, wtf is it supposed to mean? I'm guessing it trying to say it hurts but wtf is going thru ur mind that u associate pain with having bamboo being shoved underneath ur fingernails?... n here I thought that I had a messed up head but u DEFINITELY take the cake in this one, without a doubt in my mind!
If only you had waited for them to lose to the 49ers lol
Did you reference the "Hunger Death?"
Geno Smith is god
Spanos is the reason they lost to the 49ers. FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Where is sportsball?
"I love the crossover, didn't see that coming but it was hilarious
also, now do the cowboys to finish off the NFC east"
UrinatingTree, if you are preparing for a Lolcow video for my Texans, reply to this so I can give you every talking point for you to exploit.
It's 2017 quit with the 2013 memes
Now, they got all but routed by the 49ers, who last beat a team not named the Rams in 2015. I think the intentional tank may be in order...
Ab>>>obj
"They just lost to the 49ers.

Wow."
May you forever have material to work with... I fucking LOVE this channel! Keep up the great work!
Damn it’s like all our teams suck. I’m a Jets Mets Rangers Knicks fan. Pray for me
Funny cuz they lost to the fucking 49ers
The voiceover is almost good, it's slightly unfunny though.  I learned a lot, though!   The second guy is definitely funnier, but I appreciate the original content, guys!!!  Love to see some new shit
I came straight here after the Giants loss to the Niners
Please do us all a favor and don't waste the careers of Landon Collins and Paul Perkins.
And now they lost to a team that was winless.
Fucking damn it, this video was too early, the just lost to the 49ers... LMAO
THEY LOST TO THE FUCKING SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS
FivePoints!
Wow look at all of those glorious V I E W S
I fucking love you man!
nobody knows the pain of being  a giants fan it fucking sucks
And they just lost to the 49ers. They're so bad, it's almost not funny anymore. (key word: Almost)
1-8! We're unstoppable! Honestly though, watch us get a shitty player in the draft. Thanks, Jerry Reese!
Can i have permission to react to your videos.

I was expecting you to be much harsher on this shit show on a team.
Sad thing is, I'm a Giants fan and I agree with most of, if not all of this.
Where is week 10 sportsball?
They derp so hard they do not even know what state they play in. 🤥
Can’t wait for the season to be over and fire everybody and rebuild and get this franchise back in place.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I lost my will to live week 3
Hey, UrinatingTree, do you think you can mention the CFL in the next "This Week In Sportsball", since there's two CFL playoff games being played on Sunday?
NOOOO TOO SOON URINATING TREE. MY GIANTS :(
Least I got kristaps and the knicks for a season… LET THE TANK TRAIN BEGIN!
Atlanta Thrashers/ current Winnipeg Jets for the next lolcow
That Derp song though.
"Yeah, the Giants have been bad this year, but this is still a team that won a championship in, what, the last five years?

I still eagerly await a Cowboys video."
The Giants are the shame of all of New York City. We were doing pretty well and it all just collapsed. Something monumental needs to happen, or the giants will be the laughing stock of the NFL for the next decade.
Do a lolcow on the Tennessee Volunteers... 10 years of dumpster fire content to dissect.
Do a video on the Phoenix Suns
We need a Toronto Blue Jays lolcow
Do haters guide to 2017 -2018 college football Bowles when they come out
Do a re due if the Cleveland Browns expect call then professional footballs brown note
Only clicked cuz packers
In my scratching NYG fan ego: Sure, we won four Super Bowl titles, but it's once per decade for four straight decades. We can't make a dynasty.
I just hope the giants get a good draft pick.
You only won 2 super bowls in the last 10 years take it easy motherfuckers. I'm a Packers fan and shareholder and you guys turn on motherfuckers too fast, it's called loyalty.
You earned yourself a dislike
Shut up, at least we have four super bowls.
Holy shit bringing in 5Points made this video 200x funnier
I think Pekka Rinne was too good last night
A pot of daffodils can block better than Flowers.
Remember when people said they were Super Bowl caliber
I know the feeling.
I'm dying BEN MCADOO LOOKS LIKE A PE TEACHER
i lost it lol, I love being a giants fan, thank you for raising my spirits with this hilarious video.
As a giants fan I can safely say... FUCK YOU MCADOO
Why do the giants suck so much this year? :(
Reminds me of penguinz0/critikal, but still a great video
Ben McADerp
I mix of UrinatingTree and FivePointVids? Am I in heaven?
Well, it could be worse... you could be the browns.
Don’t let this distract you that Eli Manning will be the only QB to beat Tom Brady The GOAT twice in the Super Bowl.
4:20 that hit makes me cry
Its funny because the Green Bay Packers have had 2 back to back HOF QBs in Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers and have 2 super bowls to show for it total. Eli Manning has 2 super bowls to show for his time in New York. Giants are as good as Packers confirmed
Well now that you’ve gone after the giants, it would only be fitting if you went after another 4 Super Bowl franchise - the Packers and how they’ve been holding back Aaron Rodgers (at least recently)
as a giants fan thank u
LOL WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM I EVEN SAID IS HE A SEX OFFENDER! 😂
This is comedy gold HA HA HA HA #GoCowboys #WeDemBoyz

"A DERP A DERP A DERPADERP.

DE DERP DE DERP DE TEEDLY DERPY DERPY DUMB."

I fucking love these videos!
As a Giants fan...thank you.
So glad these are back😂
FivePointVids yo wassup
"Five Points Vids, you do realize that Barkley is a running back from Penn State, right?
Honestly the Giants should just try to trade the #3 pick to the bears and see what happens"
How about doing "Phoenix Suns: Professional Basketball's Burning Trash in the Desert" next?
OOOOHHHH FUN A COLAB! you really are becoming a full grown tree arent you?
Do the Bucs man
Drinks Giants Fans Tears #FlyEaglesFly
FivePoints vids is cancer.
My sides were not ready for this
Why do I have a feeling the Green Bay Packers are going to get the lolcow label soon?
I really hope you use the derp song more often.

No fuck you spanos?

OBJ, Sterling Shepard, Weston Richburg, BJ Goodson"
I'm sorry but Odell Beckham isn't close to Antonio Brown... AB is far better than that ramen head ass
No one mentioned who the two legends of urinating tree and five points gaming made a collab for this gem?
Okay I love your videos & I don’t mind you trashing my Giants but it’s Ben & Our GMs fault Eli is the only one trying with nothing around him
Colts should be the next lolcow.
"Wait.... Tree AND 5 POINTS...? IN 1 VIDEO?! IS THIS REAL LIFE?

Life is good sometimes"
It would be sad if Barkley's career was wasted in New York. Dude has some talent.
eli is almost gone, beckam wants to be the highest paid in the enitre league, and mcadoo hasn't worked out.  have fun giants fans.
The Giants might suck huge cock but they still wake Tom Brady up at night in a cold sweat.
what's with great youtubers shilling for shitty youtubers lately?
I'm so mad but this is so true
Don't forget about the big Week 10 game against San Fransisco
Bro where’s the Buccaneers Lolcow, too easy?
Timberwolves suck.
My god tree and five points gaming I can die happy now
I don't care for hand-egg, I just enjoy your ranting. :)
As an eagles fan I enjoyed this... But my franchise is also a derp
I hate the second guys voice so fuckin much
The depression has consumed my body. All I know is pain.

Pretty lame
When are you going to do a video on the Detroit Lions?
Can we get a big 12 refs lolcow?
As a giants fan i was so anticipated for this video and i love it. So true in every single way. Jerry Reese and Ben Mcadoo fucked up a possible super bowl contender. We went from contender to lolcow faster then you could say Desean Jackson.
"Read ""the draw play"" 
It's a comic by the most depressed Giants fan ever"
It’s just an odd year.
Is Pekka Rinne still too good now?
I’m a giants fan and this season is just disappointing if we lose to the niners tomorrow I will become a jets fan for the rest of the season
...And the Broncos lost to this team
I saw this coming
My favorite line in regards to the New Jersey Giants stated in an earlier video was that the Giants have a Giant Horseshoe stuffed up their ass.
I don't care much about the Giants, I'm more shocked that the Eagles made a 61-yard field goal.
fuck me its mcadoos fault, we got the yanks knicks and rangers at least
Only the NYJ would let the NYG Unintentionally, "Trust The Process" and recoup draft picks & lose QB B. Mayfield/ S. Darnold or J. Rosen for 2018. Smh. S. Barkley from Pedophile State could be another K. Carter or C. Enis, not a sure bet from PSU.
I am not a Giants fan, but lets be real here. This video would not have been made if they were not 1-7. Not if they were like 3-5, this still would not have been made.
giants fan here... knew i was only a matter of time....
Tree, you got to do a video on Hollywood. That's a lolcow content for sure.
“A random running back no one has ever heard of.” Hey, I’ve heard of him before. He used to play at UNC. I loved watching Shaun Draughn play. That being said, he really hasn’t done much in the NFL.
can you do a lolcow on the Detroit lion
Ben mcadoo need to be fired ASAP
As a fan of Big Blue, I can REALLY RELATE to this team
Great use of the cassette robot lol
Watching people shit on the Giants is actually kind of cathartic. Embrace the tank and hope Mara puts Macadoodoo's head on a pike in front of MetLife.

"I like how you roped in a Giants fan to give his opinion on how much of a derp his team is. Maybe you can do more of this in future videos?

As for suggestions, if you are really game for a big one, how about the big commish himself? After a decade, his tenure has ""lolcow"" written all over it, and he's probably the biggest one in all of football, even bigger than the Browns in my opinion."
Broncos NFL's Snowy lolcow
Don't worry Giants fans, you have your 4 Super Bowl rings and you didn't pass on Carson Wentz.
As a giants fan I was waiting for this for so long
Where my Eagles fans at? #8-1
Ben McAdoo puts ketchup on rare steak.
Tom Coughlin is the only reason this team has won anything.
2 favorite football youtubers in 1 video!
Loved the collab. Been subbed to both of you for awhile now. Keep up the fantastic work!
urinating tree can you please roast the Miami dolphins because I'm done with them and maybe do the marlins to
At least spanos trade Eli to the Giants
FivePoints Vids!
I'm a Jets fan so I don't have to deal with the other New York team (even if the Jets Buttfumbles aren't that big of an upgrade at least we are no Giants)
Damn this is gonna hella shut up the Giants fans
Keep hope alive
Hey take your lumps
At least he didnt call us a lolcow...
That New England Phys Ed teacher joke is so true.
You finally made a video about one of my teams and I'm scared to watch
Well the Yankees and Knicks seem like they’re crawling out of the basement so it’s only fitting that the Giants have to go back in
They still got the Yankees
Everyone should have seen this coming. They are the mecca of bad decisions. They paid WAY TOO MUCH for Jenkins and several other players and they've been the most unlucky team this year, losing pretty  much ever key player on offense...what little they have to start with. Its a Browns like dumpster fire.
Hey UrinatingTree, big fan. Wanna sub 4 sub?
yes
yes five point gaming and urinating tree in the same video less
Finally the day has come were my Giants get a video on this channel
The only ny team without a lolcow is not the rangy
I'll take derp-Ing to 2 titles. At least we're not the Browns.....or Bills.....or Chargers.....or Falcons.....anywua, you get what I'm saying
DRAFT LUKE FALK HE IS THE BEST IN COLLEGE FUCKING FOOTBALL
Derp. I should I have seen this video coming.
This.
As a chargers fan I'm glad we don't have this guy at QB.
how tf did that shit franchise beat the Pats twice?
All he needs now is excuses to rip into the NY Rangers and the NY Yankees and the Urinating Tree New York Circle of Mockery is complete
Fuck Aaron Rodgers.
G E N O S M I T H
Support me
Haha new england prep school! Lol
I will still wear my giants hat proudly
Haha FivePoints :)
How the fuck did this team beat undef. New england. Bullshit. Refs were bought
Giants and Mets fan... it's been painful.
God damnit i was so pissed when ben blamed eli manning for them being shit. Seriously he sounded like half the giants fanbase from 2012-2016
Derp!
Yeah, the Giants suck right now, but they're the only reason Pats fans aren't throwing seven Lombardi trophies in our faces right now instead of five.
Do the tampa bay buccaneers
"shoot eli apple" holy fuck my sides
I’ll stay a giants fan no matter what
In my opinion Saquon Barkley has 49ers written all over him
It’s all good the giants are one of if not the best NFL franchises 🤷🏽‍♂️ definitely top 5
As a Patriots fan, I can't even describe the joy I feel looking at the Giants these days. Fuck you, Spanos!
I still don't know how Rodgers completed that pass to Cobb against the Giants last year 😩
That Aaron Rodgers hail mary at the end of the video was icing on the cake
The Seattle Mariners: Professional Baseball's Shipwreck
when fivepoint vids started talking i nutted everywhere
Yeah I'll admit it, my Giants suck
I know you hate the steelers, but there is no way you can think that Odell Beckham is objectively less of a diva than Antonio Brown.  Like, really?  Odell Beckham IS the modern day measuring stick of divas.
You forgot to say fuck you spanos
as a giants fan im ready to watch this
I can't say I didn't see this coming.
"Who the fuck was that guy talking at the end pf the video? He fucking sucked. 

He better never appear in another video or I'm done. Disliked."
Do my cowboys next
How the fuck is Eli Manning overrated? Nobody thinks or says he's elite. Has anybody heard how he's talked about by NFL analysts. He's not overrated
#24  the 3rd and 33 didn't even try
OBJ is way more of a diva than AB.
You giants fans are really idiotic. "Fire him...fire that"...."draft him...sign him". After one loss it's like a meltdown and you want to restart the whole organization. You have no idea how to run a team.
I got so hyped when I heard my boy five points
From this Dolphins fan, Eli will forever be in my Hall of Fame. He saved the ONE thing we Phins fan have to brag about. The Perfect season. Thank u Eli for derping ur ass into 2 Super Bowl wins against   the bane of every football fans existence.  PS Tom Brady sucks 😜
lol I'm thank god im a New York sports fan except for football. Now I will cry myself to sleep cause I chose to support the fucking Dolphins
do a lolcow vid on the Bulls
The Derp Song!
Maybe the reason they're called the Giants is because management has their collective heads in the clouds.
Barkley going to SF
As a giants fan this was so funny esp the erick flowers dis and the 7th grade mcadoodoo reference all three fingers wow jpp
Do the bucs
RIP Roy Holliday. One of the greatest pitchers of our era, gone. Just like that. You wil be missed, old friend.
When you try to be the capitals in the playoffs..........
"Barkley sucks
If you watched the game today he only had 35 yards rushing and people says he is a heisman candidate this year"
Hehe Yankees are the kings now. Aaron Judge is the face of NY now, move over Odell
Fuck you Spanos
Ben McAdoo is like what happens if you let an uber fan of the Giants coach the team.
As a giants fan all I can do is sigh.
I am a Miami Dolphins fan and I to ask when are you going to do the Dolphins. I mean we never shut up about the perfect season. We haven't had a QB since Dan Marino. I am big Miami Dolphin fan but the Dolphins are a lolcow.
As a Giants fan, I knew this day was coming. I shall revel in it.
Do one on the Utah Jazz next
When you're such a fan of Urinating tree that you actually checked out his his shit to come across his guest BEFORE he put in his guest to talk shit bout a team that both HE AND the guest support.
I am a Giants fan and I loved this are team is complete shit
“Firebend Mcadoo”
"I see a lot of parallels between the Giants of New York and the Giants of San Francisco. 
Both teams have periods where the stars aline and everything works out for them and the next year they run afoul of some demon and are cursed. Then they win a world title, lose their star player to injury, get a top player in the draft, and on and on the endless cycle goes. But unlike SanFran, these guys have a cross-eyed woodchuck throwing the ball for them."

And then he spoke about the team I support and I was all "Yay, we suck."

How is there not one of these for the Lions yet? I mean, I know it would be 5 hours but come on!
Giants suck suck suck
😂😂😂😂 best vid ever
How is OBJ less of a diva than AB?
oh i've been waiting for this for a long time. i hate myself for being a fan of this team right now
OH HELL NO!! SAQUON BARKLEY WILL NOT GO TO THE GIANTS!  He might end up in San Francisco or end up in Cleveland
at least we beat the pats in the SB, TWICE
Not fuck you Spanos, fuck you mcadoo

Im a giants fan and we having a bad season. We will come back but fuck u giants will become the best just wait

I was almost too happy when I heard 5 points voice no homo
HAHA! Ive been waiting for you to rip my Giants! Good lord we've been atrocious this year, its like we switched places with the Rams

This season/ video was like taking a road spike to the balls. At least I’m not a jets fan
At least we have 2007 and 2011
Do one on the Green Bay Packers
For the first time in a long time it looks like em Buffalo Bills will be your new NFL New York State champions. Congrats Buffalo you did it
But pekka rinne is to good right now...

Do the Flyers
KTO!
Giants sadness brings me joy
As an Eagles fan I've really been looking forward to this🤣🤣
I'd take 2 superbowls that i can remember in exchange for a couple crappy seasons, they still have a strong core, they'll be back soon.
dilly dilly, to the pit of misery giants fans
Are you making a LA Clippers LOLCOW??
Please do the Bulls, Clippers, or Suns
Nothing like coming home from a 12 hour work day to watch a video from my fav youtuber pissingshrub
As a patriots fan I'm happy to say FUCK THE GIANTS
Worst than the 49ers!
2:14 UT, you slayed me yet again.
Please do something on the Mariners
The kicker forgot his wife wasn't a football.
I don’t care who the running back is. No RB can do anything behind that o line
Do seahawks
Please make a video about the Packers
Fuck you Spanos.
As a Giants fan, I thank you for making this video
If only Aaron Judge played football too........
Could you do one with the Indians or the tigers
Finally you did my giants. #KnicksTape
A whole roast dedicated to the Giants
this video didn’t make me feel to good about my team, but the Aaron Rodgers throw just made me feel that much worse
Omg they finally have a LolCow lmaoooooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 coming from a cowboys fan this is just amazing💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☝🏻☝🏻🔥🔥
Omg they finally have a LolCow lmaoooooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 coming from a cowboys fan this is just amazing💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☝🏻☝🏻🔥🔥
Hey UT, please do a Detroit Lions one, you'll have sub's dying from laughing at the shit storm they are
Fuck ny. Enjoy your shit season(S)😀
Their one win came from a team with a shitty coaching staff and no offense
No amount of Giants losing can quench my thirst. No amount of football misery can sate my hate for them.
Huge Giants fan here was waiting for you to make this for a long time. Its all accurate I am not looking forward to the next few years at all unless our offensive line magically becomes god tier.
Barkley won't be able to run if the o-line are traffic cones
As a redskins fan this relieves me but when is DC the legacy of choke dropping
I thought there is gonna be one "Fuck U Spanos" in this video
Nothing about this is Eli's fault.  Yeah, he's played sloppy at times, but literally everything is on his shoulders, and that's not the kind of quarterback he is.  He is someone who is a great piece to have with a team that's decent around him, who can definitely do his part but isn't good enough to carry the entire team.  Eli and a decent defense is all this team has anymore.
Do broncos "A Dumb load of shit"
Say what you will about the Giants, but they beat a perfect New England team in Super Bowl XLII; then again a few years later with just a 9-7 record.  It's not like they got intercepted on the 1 yard line in the 4th quarter with the game on the line, or gave up a 20+ point lead or anything.
Shitting on both Giants in one year? Your criticism spans both sides of the country.
Finally you made fun of us
I’ve waited a whole year for this
When will we get a legacy of failure on the entire city of Detroit?
is that KTO?
you know what ben's problem is,he's too busy trying to doodo in the poor children he's secretly raped mouths rather than trying to make his reputation less deplorable than chip kelly rich kotite combined
Tampa bay buccaneers: professional footballs sinking ship
Sigh
I want UT to rip the Blackhawks cause they’re sucking right now, but I don’t know his qualifications to make a video ripping a team.
YES!
he said wife beater lmao, Lets not forget Josh Brown beat his wife and got suspended one game
Do a leagcy of failure UK Football, we lost Bear Bryant to Alabama because we wouldn't give him raise after winning a Championship and we've been medicore ever since
I’m a Giants fan and this is so fucking true I’m dying right now
5 points and Urinating tree in the same vid? Am I in heaven
When January comes around, I want the Post, The News, and/or Newsday to have the back cover simply say, "The Blue Wedding."
I find the timing of you dropping this video a little bit puzzling since the Giants are about to play the 0-9 49ers tomorrow. If the 49ers end up getting their first win against the Giants, that could have been something else you could use in a Giant lolcow video.
2 superbowls in the last decade
MMMMMMM this is like porn for cowboys fans :D
Yeah... four championship team you're mocking. Pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Nice try, UrinatingTree.
ELI APPLe is good! He's been guarding the best WRs pretty well so far
You haven't riffed my team the Broncos yet... They're having a Lolcow season right now. Even lost badly to the dumpster fire Giants.
4:44 ahahahahaha i fucking love that movie its so funny
Hahaha don't worry New York at least we have the Rangers!!!!!!
As a Giants fan, this was hilarious. You have a great channel. Just looking forward to the draft now.
You know it’s bad when your kicker is a wife beater 😂
Damn I thought my giants were off the hook cuz of injurys rip
Omg he listened to my comment
Do the Fucking Penguins Pharisee
Oh a Giants video. I was afraid of this. Please excuse me as I slit my wrist
I liked the vid before even watching it. It was worth it. Now all u need is Dallas lolcow vid.
The 19 people that disliked this video are the 19 remaining giants fans left after this atrocious year.
Hey, at least Evan Engram looks promising
Giants may suck now but eagles still got no rings
Please save us
I want a lolcow/garbage fire for the Whitesox.
This is literally revenge from the Pats losing to Super Bowl 42 10 years ago. I’m weeping tears of joy from your video. As always FUCK YOU SPANOS!
The 9ers will beat them tomorrow ahahahahahahaah
They need Landry Jones as there QB
Do the Broncos!!!
"This man is a pair of sweatpants and a wife beater away from being a 7th grade Phys Ed teacher at a New England prep school." HOW does he come up with these analogies?
Odell is the diva of divas.
Make a Dolphins lolcow. I sacrificed my Sundays to watch this team fail. :)
I'm not feeling sorry for him. After two lucky catches that robbed Tom Brady, I have no more sympathy.
Somehow I knew this was coming. My team soiled
It hurts to be a giants fan.
You know it's a bad day when urinating tree posts a video.. and your favourite team is in the thumbnail
I️ was waiting for this video, FUCK MACADOO
"as a giants fan. 

thank you for making me even more sad. after not knowing we could've had Todd gurley but fucking drafted erect flowers.

But I still love your videos."
Regardless of the content of the specific poem, I don't know if Rudyard Kipling, author of "The White Man's Burden," is the best poet to motivate a contemporary NFL football team.
Fuck you, Spanos.
do colts lolcow or nl east lolcow division
I’m a giants fan and I’ll even admit this is a horrible team, at least I got my other favorite team the chiefs.... what they lost to the cowboys? Well then
I feel bad for the Giants. From a Dolphins fan
Do the Broncos. They've earned it tree.
At some point I expect my Packers getting a video. Might hurt lol but I'll be good as long as Ted Thompson and Dom Capers are fully roasted.
Can you guys more videos on the nba
What a turn of events bills an jets shitting on the giants who were super bowl champions
Do the Lions next
This channel needs more subscribers
I love both tree and five points so much. Good to see them work together
I'm thinking you do a Legacy of Failure on the Texans of Houston
Football Gods punished the Giants after OBJ's actions by taking out their WR unit
You gotta do the bucs, especially with how they were made out to be one of the better teams of the league this year and have just been a rotting steamy loaf this whole season
I fucking hate Eli so much. Also fuck YOU SPANOS
They suck at drafting! Except for Landon Collins and OBJ...
As a giants fan this made me laugh and cry at the same time, sad but true.
Is that five point games
Honestly, we've got a chance next season. I'm not going to start being a pessimist just because of a bad season. Just cuz our players had a boat party doesn't mean we're an incompetent organization compared to the other teams in our division.
I'm from Connecticut but I laughed about the prep school joke
Derp derpie Derp Derp Derp
I've been waiting this video for a long time (Coming from a diehard Giants fan)
Five Point Vids and UrinatingTree, my life is now complete, I’m ready to pass on now.
As a Giants fan I have been waiting for this video. I honestly hate this team. 2 Superbowls don't mean shit if you can't become a perennial contender and miss the playoffs every year after. They fore Coughlin but then keep the front office intact and promote the fuckboi McAdoo to be the head coach. If not for the browns I'd say they have the worst front office in all of football. Eli Manning is hugely overrated by giants fans because he managed to beat the Pats twice in the Superbowl. It's not saying much tho besides YA Tittle and Fran Tarkenton the Giants never really had a good QB. And he might be talented, but I hate Odell Beckham. HE has such a shitty attitude he makes it impossible to like him. I stopped watching this team about a month ago, I don't think I am missing anything by not watching them.
I was there for the game in your thumbnail
As a Giants fan, I am embarrassed by this season. This is NOT the same team I saw in the Super Bowl back in 2012. Absolutely pathetic.
Fuck you Spanos
Is that kto?
Fuck Ben Mcapoo
7-Jan
I’m a giants fan. Now hand me the L’s of sorrow.
Yo tree go check out TPS's last war video currently, there's an entire thread just making your references and jokes. Your on the rise my friend!
This video makes me realize that my giants will probably suck for at least 10 years
Ben McAdoo? More like Ben Derp-Dee-Doo, amirite? ;)
This video was VERRRRY satisfying. Thank you, Tree.
364th.
fire mcadoo
Please do the sharks for the love of us all
"FINALLY, a lolcow video on my Giants. I've been waiting for it for two months now.

Loved everything you said in the video, and could relate to the poor Giants fan. Only two things though:

1: I'm surprised you didn't flame Jackrabbit and how goddamn overrated he is. The guy is basically a clone of Eli Crapple. Hasn't made one good play since the preseason.

2: Since when did the Giants have a 'vaunted offensive line'?"
Basically New Yorkers should only watch baseball and hockey to avoid misery lmao
ben macadoo probably looks up how to beat your wife instead of play calling
YEEEEESSSS
Stay in yo cell
LMFAO
18-1 bitch
As a Giants fan, don’t draft anything else except A LEFT FUCKING TACKLE
Still tho I'm hoping for a Giants win against the 49'ers so we can have 2 0-16 teams this year
Fuck you spanos! From sunny San Diego
YES! YESSSSSSSS! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Ben McAdoo: the most successful pedophile ever

I never expected the New York Giants were going downhill after being Super Bowl contender to becoming a Derp fest on the field.
Shitton of holding on the helmet catch.  But at least Pete Carrol fucked up and Atlanta imploded so I guess it evens out.
No fuck you Spanos ?? Who are you and what did you do to UT ??
the giants are also very inconsistent, they switch between good, decent, bad, and awful with the jets every year. i love it, also fuck you spanos
Yesssss
I mean eli has thrown for 1820 yards 12 tds and 6 ints. That's better than most starters in the leauge. He isn't the problem this year.
FUCK YOU MARA
as a eagles fan thank you for posting this
UT & FP Vids, name a better duo
j-e-t-s
This is why if you are a Pats fan in NY you are ALWAYS called a bandwagoner

Don’t trust comments that are edited

This is great
Yessss... YES!
1 like=1 prayer for this Giants fan 😭
Thank god I have the Rangers and Yankees. This season has been a complete dumpster fire
As a giants fan I️ really needed this
"Oh god, this is going to suck so much.

Update: THIS hurt more than watching that FG. Again."
Your friend is not as charismatic as you are, UT. Also, I needed to jack up the volume to hear anything that he said.
do one for the la chagers
Still more successful than the Jets
"So I like the Giants, Mets, Islanders, and Knicks.

At least the Knicks don't all the way suck. For now."
I'm glad you weren't like every mindless Eli hater saying HURR DURR ITS ALL ELI'S FAULT LETS TRADE HIM AND A 7TH FOR AARON RODGERS
Game of the year this weekend: Giants vs. 49ers.
jerry reese is the premiere lolcow of nfl gm's.
That was fucking hilarious. Thank you for that it greatly needed.
Not even one clip of mr derp from South Park? Just disappointing, Tree.
I've been waiting for this collaboration😂
Hello? Do you not notice that this team has 4 Super Bowls, and that Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP?
This is the best day of my life. Never thought urinating tree would make a video of my team
Cowboys fan here. This was beautiful
Still not as derpy as the San Diego, oh oh my bad LOS ANGELES chargers
"Um." - ben mcadoo
I'm a Giants fan and this is the truest video i've seen
At least Manning has two rings...unlike my Eagles... sobs, then looks at the current Giants and Eagles records Much better...
You made a Giants lolcow video and didn't mention the miracle at the meadowlands??? Not 1 or 2??? Wow...
Fuck you Spanos
Three NFC East teams now. As a Cowboys fan, I’m nervous for when our video comes out, but i love watching our rivals get shit on. Don’t worry, I know we’re Pro Football’s Outlaw.
I didn't even know Geno Smith was in the league lol
"Somehow i feel, deep down...







This is all Dean Spanos' fault"
Lolcow much
Grab some popcorn  Eagles, Redskins, and fellow Cowboys fans 🍿
No Detroit Lions video yet but at least we get a good surprise courtesy of the NY football derp Giants.

"Ben McAdoo blaming Eli Manning?

He's the one keeping them from becoming the Browns."
as a Giants fan, seeing this makes my body shiver out of anger.
Fucking finally
Oh God, the pain is unbearable.
The only accurate game of thrones scene that accurately depicts the Giants' season is the end of hound vs viper.
With the first pick in the NFL draft the gaints select Josh Rosen quarterback UCLA
So a team with No O-line, a horrible rushing game, All the good WR's are injured, and a completley overrated defense, how do we fix this you ask? Draft a new quarterback and replace Eli, he's the reason we are terrible this year! I mean no, I'm a ravens fan (that hasn't been that fun this year either) but even I can tell getting a quarterback is the LAST thing the fucking giant's need right now. Fix that O-line and if your lucky (meaning if you tank hard enough), Barkley will fall into your hands, and just tough it out with one more year of Eli.
The derp sound effect should be my new text alert ringtone
"Suggestions for next videos:
Tennessee titans 
Arizona cardinals
LA Rams
Detroit Lions 
Chicago Bulls
Detroit pistons
Orlando Magic 
That's about all I can think of hope you see this"
From what I’ve seen, they’re about to call an article 15 on mccadoo
Five points gaming + Urinating Tree + Me getting plastered on Veterans Day = Pure gold
As a Jets fan I'm loving this
"I'm convinced Eli has the 2 rings because life figured it was the best way to spite Peyton.

Fuck you Spanos."
Ummm Barkley is from Penn State, HAS ANYONE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM DRAFTING FROM PENN STATE!?
Do the Texans
I wonder if this guy is going to run out of teams to talk about
As a Giants fan I can only agree
How long until McAdoo gets fired? Taking all bets!
Where were you when their entire receiving corps was kill

Eli Manning looks like a homeless Goomba
YES I LOVE THESE VIDEOS BRUH.
I knew this video was coming. As a Patriots fan a must say... thank god this derp era exists. Now we just need Giants fans to realize those 2 superbowls from 7 and 10 years ago don't mean much anymore.
As a giants fan I will say the accuracy in this video along with the humor is great. My g-men are shit this year and likely to continue to be shit for years to come.
Do a Chicago Bulls Lolcow video!!!
the giants bad season is due to macadoo
This hurt like a kick to the crotch.. and to end it with Buck’s fake excitement at the end just more painful
I know it has nothing to do with LA but I have to say, FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Why does Ben McAdoo look like the PC Principal from South Park ?
Been waiting for FPV to make an appearance
As a Giants Fan ive been waiting for this
And you S T I L L have not done those pussy cats (lions)
"anyone remember that chubby dude that said Odell doesn't contribute towards the team






this is to him :I)))"
Im a giants fan and i find this funny and true af
51-17 to La Rams really
Somehow my saving grace this year is the god damn New Jersey Devils
great video
"Sees UT video
Looks at rope

Not today, friend. Not today."
Leave my giants alone tree I can’t handle the truth 😭😭 I know we suk
I think the Giants will finish last in the NFC this year.
I think that after this video I will just be a Rams fan #goff=🐐
New York and sports. Same old same old
its his fuckin acumen, kid
Mcadoodle doo sucks big fat veiny elephant cock
What is great about UT is that he hates everyone equally.
As a Giants fan, we were fucking due for this treatment after the season we've been having.
THE FUCKING PENGUINS.
lolcow should be a adjective
fuck you Spanos
as a giants fan i truly appreciate this
derp
It pains me to say it but do the Houston Texans
As a Giants fan this hurts
I only take comfort in those 2 super bowl wins years ago and that this horrible season doesn't fall on Eli when previous bad seasons did or usually does for a QB.
Derp
God damn it I knew this was coming...
My question is how did it take so long. It took so long for them to be bad they used to win with like the same team
They need to sign pekka rinne
As a giants fan. I wanna cry. I love u tho
How can you make a Giants Derp video without including DJax's Punt Return "Miracle at the Meadowlands 2"? Cmonnnn
18 likes and 2 views YouTube you're high
"No wonder my family are fans of Division rivals.
Maybe we'll win the NFC East if Romo or Cousins somehow derp harder than Eli Manning and lose a couple games in a row.
Although, I already knew we were screwed once Odell got hurt, so...
This is what I expected. P.S., we'll probably be in the basement once Eli is gone and Odell gets sent to a real team because tanking."
This video was MADE for five points, I wouldn’t be mad if just narrated the whole video 🤣
5 points vids has a good ass channel. Good to see him with Tree.
We need a lolcow video on the most lolcow teams, Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Mariners and the LA Clippers those teams are the meaning of Lolcow
"First




Dislike"
The Rangers are due for a Legacy of failure. 1994 was 23 years ago.
Doesn't even hurt that bad because I can always watch those two championship DVDs of the Giants beating the Patriots. You're welcome, everyone.
Could you do a video on individiuals? The Zeke Elliott saga would make an awesome video!
I was anticipating this video. Go Giants!
All we need is the Cowboys and he did the entire NFC East under 2 years.
Please make an Arizona Cardinals lolcow vid. Thanks. They haven;t accomplished much throughout their 120-year existence.
Who's the biggest derp on this Giants team? My answer would be Ben McAdoo. Eli Manning is a very close second.
At least they are having a better season than the 49ers lmao XD
The derp is just too good right now.
As a Giants fan let's just sign pekka rinne and the whole preds defense to be our o line- they "find new and unique ways to kill you" right
Please do the Arizona Cardinals next
It was worth getting off my cristian   minecraft server for this
Welp, I Guess its time for our anal pounding
I live in NY and almost all my friends have been Giants fans for years and whenever I joke around about the Giants they always tell me how they were never Giants fans and were always Bills fans lmao
I knew this was coming eventually and here it is
Flyers please?
Tank for O-line and kill Everyone who isn't a player, Spags, or Mara.
cant wait until macadoo gets a horseshoe dildo shoved up his ass on the way out of town
As a Die Hard eagles fan I love this.
4:45 Misery By Stephen King
The marching band competitions at MetLife have higher attendances than the average Giants home game.
Derp- seriously cannot describe this team any better.
FIVE POINT VIDS!!!! YEEEEEEESSS!!!! All we need now is a collab between you two and a vid on the browns.
AS A GIANTS FAN THANKS FOR MAKING THIS
ben mcadoo always looks like he's trying to find a hybrid of a little boy/swiss cheese with that greasy rat, pedophile look to him
Yu need to do a Year in review for trump in January, Also F yu bettman
but  nice job collabing with FivePointsVids!
Who would’ve thought the jets would be the best team in New York
there was a severe lack of "fuck you spanos!"
as a giants fan at least i have the devils and the yanks to root for
Thank the lord
Urinating Tree and Five Point Vids collaborating in one video. Awesome.
:(
As a giants fan I’m laughing and crying at the same time
Giants are tanking
But some things never change... FUCK YOU SPANOS
My boy Saquon better not end up on the damn giants
Mara &Reece hired him to tank for a great QB, y'all will appreciate his genius in a few years.
Do a video on the packers withought Rodgers
Do raiders
Oh no...
Ben McAdoo spends more time putting gel in his hair then making his team good
It time for my Giants to take their medicine
I'm a Giants fan and I thank you for making this.
Do Miami sports next!
"First the Habs, and now the Giants?!

What's next the saints? Flyers?"
Finally, thank you.
Do Miami sports next!
Also what is up with everyone in season ending injuries this year
Its probably the only 50 Burger Elijah Manningface will see.
This needed to be made
Please Do Clippers next
As a giants fan I️ never thought this channel would be in the lolcow series

You know it's a damn shame when the Jets and Bills are better than the Giants.

Tree you have to make a Lolcow video for Madden that game has been shit for years now, the last good one imo was Madden 11
as a giants I fucking love this.
Manning derped his way to beating my Patriots. Twice. 18-1. Still hurts.
Last time I was early the falcons did not blow a 28--3 oh wait
Winners of the Offseason, Losers of the tank
I fucking almost choked when you said Geno Smith
Love this channel
I couldn't be happier
That shut up the pre season giants fans
YES, fuck the giants, ruined my Packers playoffs too many times
Notifications squad
41 seconds ago? Last time I was this early, the Giants were upsetting the Patriots
You know it’s a good day when Urinating Tree uploads a video.
