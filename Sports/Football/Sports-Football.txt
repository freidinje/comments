Rams is my family
Lowkey this makes remember of that movie "Remeber the titans"
“Really strong arm”. Lol
Hercules??
Did 18 ever go D1?
Imagine what would happen if the coach ran contact and Goff got his ACL torn
Dope!!! Lol
Remember that Jesus loves you and Jesus saves?????? Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life! John 14:6 With God all things are possible! Matthew 19:26 God is good all the time and all the time God is good! Amen?? Have a blessed day??
#18 is D12 lmao
Brock looks like Mitch trubisky
WHAT IS WITH THE SANDWICH SOUND EFFECTS?
Those tattoos suit him good for some reason ??
"Hercules" lmao
You can tell high college level players, regardless if they go to a big school or not. Dude has a cannon. I honestly didnt realize how big Goff was. goodness
Guy 1: He asked if I was the punter. Guy 2: So disrespectful. Actual Punter: Gently weeps*
I've seen a few of these "Transfer" videos and Goff was the best transfer yet. What are you, the punter? That's a line for the ages.
Awesome.
Whats your name ? Dog.
Are you the punter? Lmao
Why the number 18’actig like that. Jeez
Rams 2018 baby
"broski"....best last name ever!
Lmao that little spud monkey ain’t goin d1
K
Who?
Goff throws a beautiful deep ball so effortlessly!
Nice
How the coach gonna let that kid talk back to him like that?
We need so many more of these!
pranks unsuspecting college football team.
wat college team wears those headgear lol
Around 2:10 : Jeff Spicoli goes quarterback...
Ya name daug? ??
#18 is annoying af
Rams 6-0
Fake and gay
Check out my last post . I almost touched lil skies at a concert
6-0 baby
#18 needs to stfu. What dude needs to do is fix his face. #Proactive
This is still awesome as heck!!!! Made my day guys
Great stuff!
Mooshagian Hell ya
wierd you didnt show any comments from the starting qb
Why are they wearing scrum hats, in practice?
Where is the d one getting his money
I lost it when he called him the Punter.
boooo 619-917-6945
Just remember Patriots fans, 18-1.................................18-1.
Tl;dr NFL players comes and shits on a bunch of nobodies who aren’t going to make it in football. How is this good-natured it’s pretty shitty
This video cracks me up
Lol, "You the punter bro?"
And none of these kids made it
Lke if you realized my spelling error
Editing can be better, ie. showing the reaction of the "reveal"
Thats my QB im from LA
These kids probably had no idea with this huge camera crew showing up
Holy Beautiful
Haha that was great! Thanks so much for posting. This must have been a tremendous experience for those young men and it was great of Jared to do it.
And VC went on to an incredible 2-11 season
At 5:08 number 86 looks like she is a halfway through a male to female transition.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-MyRFjxjmw4
Great video moron
Still can't beat Fullerton go hornets
That's awesome. :)
how did they not notice his jersey is number 16+ that hair do boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That was awesome lol
This is beyond uber awesome!
be even funnier if they didn't tell the coaches
'What was yall's record last year?' Uhhh.umm.
Terrible job on that wig
idiots
That dude trying to go D1 is way undersized. No doubt he’s fast but I’d worry if he got tackled by an NFL sized player.
I don't know why but that sound of him chewing was disgusting. Maybe because it sounded squishier than it should have.
I’ve watched this multiple times and I thought this was a high school.
Nobody caught the fact that there’s a dude at :35 really sporting the last name “Broski”? lol
Classic
Ryan gosling ?
#18 is the type of player to talk back to the coaches and make everybody do push ups
Well done Red Bull, that was pretty funny. ??
#18 needs to seriously just sit down and work.
Number 18 will not make it for ego.
That’s cool
5:12 mfw I'm taking a smash in the bathroom & my gf barges in without knocking
Need more of these
I told a chemistry joke the other day, and I got no reaction
RED BULL does not give u wings..
Dude that guy's ears @1:25 are freakin' tiny
Jared Goff is a BALLER!
I was at a nationally ranked DIII school and during my junior year we had a pitcher transfer from down south. He's throwing in the lower 90's hitting spots and mixing his pitches well. Pretty much the entire team was salivating, as we were already returning 2 all-region pitchers. Fucker dropped out of school a week before the first game of the season.
Just an FYI. They were conference champs in 2012, -2014-15-16-17 and have been to a bowl game every year since 2011.
I really liked the vid it's actually pretty funny Jared golf is a decent player come check my new vids you would really like them ??
Scripted
Their quarterback at the end was like thank god...
“What are you the punter” ????
My dad played here
Good one cuz!
That looks like so much fun. What a nice video.
Gawd, # 18 likes to run his mouth!
"All these cameras. They're interviewing us. The guy in the funky wig must be Jared Goff."
That's awesome!
Are these special needs kids?? Looks like a protective cover.
Hahaha "what was your record last year?" Lmfao
No fucken clue who that dude is..
As soon as he uncorked that deep ball they should know that unless he is coming from the California Penal League they've been punked lol.
What's the deal with those helmets?
Why is football all about the money it’s only about to play the game for me
Pretty good? Lol very dwhat?
That kid wouldn't last in d1 talking back.
That was dope!!????
Is this fake
Bunch of cry babies
Never heard of this guy. Must suck
That was cool
I wish I'd be bigger and not so small. I want to sling it like goff. I can't even hold the ball tight or throw it properly
I fist read the title as "transgender prank" and I was wee bit confused
He’s fuckin doodoo my girl likes him tho??
My old football coach from sacramento state
I love how Goff was almost a draft bust due to Jeff Fischer sucking as a coach. Makes you wonder how many others players lives and carrers were ruined due to shyt coaching!
I dislike people like that short rat #18 barking loud . Little chihuahua
came for that disgusting looking thumbnail.
QB's like...there goes my scholarship ??
Song? 4:37
i still don't know who he is LOL
Lol number 15 got scared that he will get his starting spot taken away??????
" what's your record last year ' " Shhhhhh " " that's why im here " " what you mean " ????????
Always dream big!
3:30 "What are you the punter?" lol
Please pay attention in school kids or this is what happens. 00:24
R F t let
Go Hawks!
Lol. Their jaws dropping when they see him sling it is my fav part.
RIP Mac Miller Always REMember !
Did anyone catch a pass that day from any quarter back ??
Very entertaining!
How would this ever not be staged? Oh just ignore those camermen theyre just messing around today. Or do they record it after and force reactions like a movie?
Jay Hickman
#18 trash asf
????????
This dude just threw for 465 yrds and 5 TDs vs the Vikings. LOL!!!!!!!!!!
Redbull needs to do this for all their athletes. Could you imagine Mark Marquez at a club race?
1:46 I mean i like Jared Goff, but he isn't an all-pro quarterback.
805 LOVE
That was great Goff
Loved it
#18 sounds like t.o with Tony romo
what type of football is that bc it aint tackle lmao
#18 is probably a 3rd stringer
bruh i would of socked number 18 he already pissing me off and its not even 2mins in the video lol chill bruh who tf r u
This reminds me of that one episode when Patrick put a wig on andwent inside the Krusty krab and then got hit on by Mr k himself because he thought he was a girl. Either way cometely off topic.
Jered ain't a familiar face when it pertains to QBs. Most if them were like...'ok' it's jered.....
BUILD THAT WALL NGGGG
That was cool
is this a Juco School or?
18 is a thug.
Inspiration....
Is that a chick at 5:09 ???
Is Jay related to Mike Vanderjagt?
The real prank will be when #13 "The Punter" takes Jared Goff's job with the Rams in a few years.
That WR is a good dude. He was sticking up for his QB's.
These guys are scrubs lol
Who the duck is this guy
kid at the end..."remember this for the rest of my life"....it's all about memories....life.
So we are just going to ignore the helmets?
i see all that green and i see all the money ima get in D1!! LOL!!!
That number 18 dude rude asf he ain't making it in the NFL with that attitude but hes loyal
They should’ve gave him the QB position to see what the reaction would be lol
Ryan Gosling is a pretty good QB. Who would have known?
He took off the Wig and everyone acted like they instantly recognized him
5:07 Nice to see girls playing college football
I am trying to get money cuzzzz
"Come on up here Jared!" ..sucks in gut..lol!
This fake there are so many cameras they can tell
Too Much Fun!
#18 said something like "he trying to get dat green from Division 1" blag blah blah. I thought you cant take money while in college, I guess he meant an academic scholarship since he spoke so eloquently.
What are you the punter lol
loved this
Why you trying to make him look like Kyle Orton?
Now that was good stuff. LMAO
#18...self appointed team leader.
Nothing more obnoxious than wannabe D1s.
Goff just beat the Vikings too.
If they stop kneeling I will once again watch NFL ...until then not watching
Hey thats our quarterback
Can someone please explain why this isn’t a weekly show here. The premise is F’n great! But I guess there would be some limitations. You couldn’t really bring in 6’3 Julio Jones and say he’s a goofy transfer.
Is Goff good enough to play for that team?
This is fake
Hey! Number 18! You're not a star. You're not the coach. BE QUIET!
Maybe they should have used a better QB...
I cannot stand 18 ??????
Why are they wearing scrum caps
It's sad how number18 is not accepting a new teammate who could change the teams lossing record" if this wasn't a prank" .. #18 is the bad seed who he just talks about money money money but he ain't gonna make money money money if he's not open to new teammates who could bring Change to the teams out come and win games and than d1or college could look at this team and be like dang there good and pick the good ones on the team but #18 is feeding the already bad team with negative comments ..look nfl teams trade there bad seed players all the time and some teams end up being good with new members ..#18 should know this and accept new teammates no matter what bc at the end of the day he's gonna be on the team so why talk crapp to a new member of the team which he don't know anything about him ..it takes one new member to change a bad team ....#18 You gotta go you bad seed bye bye ????????????????????
I like brock
0:46 why does Brock look like the guy that played Clark in Smallville?
They wouldn't recognize him without the disguise
Is there the son of former Colts Kicker Mike Vanderjagt???
5:57 .. smokepurpp?
i bet he cant throw the football over them mountains
TOO FUNNY....LOL
"I like Brock".. Goff- "who are you the punter?"
There’s no way that the TE’s last name is broski ??
He was rocking the long brown hair..
I live in Ventura
That was great!!!
This is funny
threw a straight interception, must be him LUL wonder how many takes it took to show him actually being good LMAO
Glad to see football man stand up
Wtf are those helmets
Jared Goff gonna win mvp this year, only bc of the weapons around him and that offensive system
#18 out here like hes a superstar playing with a paper helmet on. Go sit down somewhere
He kinda looks like Jared Goff.
I have Goff on my FFL team ??
Wish they showed more of the passes, receptions and the players reactions. Is there a longer version of this?
I have Goff on my FFL! Scrored 58 points! Haha??
Tom brady is the goat...but after my beloved patriots comes Jared Goff and the rams, love how things are going out there and I'm cheering for him
yoooo thats my hometown ! thats crazy #GOPirates
at 3:13 they’re hip...
Makeup artist and that wig is the best they got? Smh
Best QB in the League right now. Kurt Warner 2.0.....
Annoying but got to admire the loyalty and trust
5:56 # wtf is that gross little thing in between Goff and #22 Is it human?
dam dude b talkin bak he b cut b4 the game with belichick at the helm
Thats pretty kewl
THAT was funny!
"Everybody was clueless, everybody looked at him like he was hercules or something!"Lol?? 5:57
is 18 the mascot????
No way that’s my local community college haha
number 18 is that one guy that peaks in college and everybody hates
Running for the MVP this year the Goffinator!
WHERE MY VENTURA PEEPS AT!!!! We out here livinnnnn.
That loud mouf N need to STFU.
I love these pro pranks!
I remember my days in high school, Curtis Martin came to our practices when he was with the Patriots!
This is not real
His last name is broski haha that's great
#7 was a good teammate, unbiased and loyal but willing to let the new guy prove himself
"You fast?. Alright balls coming" Lol
"Can We Get Some Faster Guys Out Here"
I mean... Coulda been better
GOAT
Goff hasn't had an All-Pro selection yet....
Idk why they even dressed him up ain't nobody going to recognize him ??
#18 just happy he still gonna be starting
Jared Goff reminds me of Nicholas Cage
Jared played the part well
Anyone ever met his dad? Jack Goff?
we just hit 9 MILL LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Who’s Jared Goff??
That wig looks fake af LMAO
Lol
This looks a little too smooth to be genuine, still funny tho
WHAT ARE YOU THE PUNTER
This made me want to eat a sandwich ??
"At least I had the mole"
The one guy all about the money and always saying I I I got get there is no I in team
"Hercules" ??
Brock was on the locker room packing he missed the whole reveal.
This whole thing is a set up 0:34 dudes name is broski..... Nah breh
Who is that kid talking about "I'm gonna make money"
He’s use to nfl speep??
Lol compared him to Hercules
Nice
How does the role excuse Goff totally disrespecting the D3 guys? Haha he could have just played it nerdy but he shits on them
What college is that?
This actually illustrates how precise a pro qb actually is
We need more of this... Pros going undercover
Jared Goff is almost the same age lol
Y’all should do Obj or Ab that’ll be great!
“Thas mah quartahback.” 3:37 I’ve heard this one somewhere else before, just can’t put my finger on it...
That was super cool of Goff to do that
This feels scripted
Wait is that Mike Vanderjagt's son?
He looks like that gay guy from the Kardashians lmao
Black dude is “trying to get money” going D1. He is aware that’s illegal right? Hahaha moron
Jared Goff isn't an all pro quarterback. Get your facts right.
#18 annoying as hell!
Who is he
What was your record last year? Guess that's why I'm here, right? :)
I have to be missing something. Red Bull comes in to randomly do a professional-level mini-documentary with a D3 football team, and it just so happens they have a "new transfer" that same day clearly wearing a ridiculous wig. This has to be all staged, would the players really fall for that?
didn't prank long enough
Could you imagine being one of the players thinking damn we might have a chance with the new qb to find out it’s a joke
That was awesome. Huge Rams fan, even more now. GO RAMS!
Very Best Prank
"come up here...(different audio) ..Jared"
So what you want but seeing Goff devour a sandwich with no remorse instantly made me have more respect for him hahaha he sold me on how good that sandwich really was ??
Has anyone noticed Jared thanks his dad in every interview for not naming him Jack.
Yes Transgender you can look baby ????????
Wtf is those helmet
FAKE
Would’ve been funny Asfuck if the coach told the QB he lost his job to the transfer.
I go to Buena High school just about 5 minutes away from the college and it’s funny seeing some of the guys I used to play football with who graduated who now go to VC practice with Goff
He kinda looks like Big Ben
I like how they act like they didn't know.
Good to see this program doesn't discriminate genders and allows girls to play too 5:08
Yooo I went to high school with one of those QBS god dam
How much of this do you think is real? It seems mostly acting.
I just read the title as "Transgender prank" Wtf is wrong with me?!
When i come out heres and i seez green. Das me deers altot of monyeys i needs to make! Can someone please translate this for me?
Those other qb's were shitting their pants
im impressed by his sandwich eating technique, he made it look like air
WTF is that at 5:08 at left with the ear-rings. Is that a broad?
I played on this field!!!
00:28, odds are against him on getting a NFL contract.. He better hit the books too...
Notice how much better the receivers got when Goff was throwing to them? A practical demonstration of why a good QB is critical to the success of a team.
Best prank
I thought the whole thing was a skit. What’s up with the helmets, am I missing something?
lol, like he's any good.
That's disrespectful.
Looks like Jonathon cheban from Kardashian show
Not sure what the point was…
Tyreek Hill would be hilarious..
Ron weasley
sunshiiine...
look liie a young jake Palmer
I love the teammate that immediately went to bat for his quarterbacks.
wHatCHu meEn thO? He means you and your team suck kid.
Excellent!!!!
That was fun
Rookie Goff wouldn't even have made 3rd string on this team. He was AWFUL!!!!
More transfers lmao
TOO DUMB TO REALIZE ANYTHING
“The Transfer” starring Jared Goff as the transfer QB and Kevin Hart as the annoying midget wide receiver.
Red Bull: You deserve your 7.8 million views on this video. This was an emotional rollercoaster which ended on a high note, as there was much ebullience and elation upon his revealing himself. Well done.
Whoever did the makeup needs to get fired that’s it Jared still looks like Jared
who?
This is why this young man will go far in the NFL, he has the right attitude, plus it doesn't hurt that he has a cannon for an arm??
The DBs were pissed...
The goff wentz rivalry will be legendary(dak is average accept it)
13 seems insecure.
I'm a DINDU ya feel me
I really thought this was the "transgender quarterback prank"
It sounds like the guy @1:22 got some help from teachers with his grades.
This is so awesome! That guy was pissed.
What’s up with these helmets
My HS mascot we won state in1993.
Stupid black kid
NFL need to do this more!! Or make is a series!!
so nobody noticed the cameras
that was awesome
They thought they was bout to win the chip when they seen him connecting ????????????
That was so cool.
Can we get some faster guys out here what are we doing? haha
His sandwich is so squishy
Jared Goff you did not win state Madison San Diego beat y'all 38-35
Something tells me buddy is not going D1...
I can’t tell if this was like half staged or whatever but he did a good job. Had me laughing. When he asked that dude "what was y’all’s record last year? That’s why I’m here." And the way that dude looked at him and said "whatchu mean?" had me roaring.
#18 is that dude. Lol "I like Brock . "
Could still obviously tell what brand the jerseys are....
Welp?????????
Xxx Jll. The
Legend has it they went undefeated and won a National championship
When these muh fucka's talk. They make no damn sense... all of them sound retarded.
wow, very legit and real prank, very believable high quality qontent.
Is #86 a girl @ 5:08
who's jared goff?
“Are you the punter?”
Should've done face tats.
Red Bull does a good job really making these guys look like someone else. The Greg Maddux one, it was impossible to tell it was him too.
That clown little kid theted aloy of green i gotta get this money
#13 is former nfl placekicker mike vanderjagt son most accurate kicker in nfl history
american are so dumb
Today i am not Jared Geoff, im a tall Ryan Gosselin.
0:33 "Broski" LOLOL!
That was great!
What was your record last year? Well that’s why I’m here
“no nutrition plan, just sling it”??
They should cut #18 for team cohesiveness.
??
A min into the video, and #18 is now archenemy. I can feel it in my bones.
Dude I would destroy number 18 and I haven’t played football since the 6th grade... stfu kid
not a rams at all, but this was really cool of Goff to do this.
#18 is like Boobie Miles from Friday Night Lights
That was great. This should have been an hour long mocumentary. I woulda liked to have seen way more of this. Reactions to his look, his play at the beginning and then hire it progressed, interactions, etc.
Is 86 a chick?
That mole...lmao why
What does hair hafet to do with Gender??
That guy that was asked if he's fast and then started catching everything was invited up to the NFL. #themoreyouknow
That was awesome. Do more!
I like Red bull
Since when did football players use scrum caps for training
Never seen a bigger group of retards.
"The whole team looked at him like he was Hercules or something." lol
Hi
16
I've seen less drops at playground games
Tryna get that money at D 1
N(ii. H
These people are in college.
Tx HS football owns Cali, where the talent at
This was fun.
At one o two everyone’s head turns
Still didnt make team
How old is college in the states because just a QB he’s bigger than all of those players he mounts over them taking the picture
#18 is a punk
I bet that starting QB was shitting bricks ??'thinking he lost his starting job...i bet he was relieved to know it was a joke lmao
I dont know a lot about football and I know that I'm about to trigger everyone reading this comment but why does the dude at 3:11 have a pacifier?
Everybody looked at him like he was Hercules or something ... ammm that’s how you gotta look to go pro if you don’t then you know what’s the outcome . Some is hard work and dedication most of it is genetics. If you tall built then the rest is just practice . There is things you can’t teach unfortunately. Jordan was born with the athleticism he wasn’t born with the skills of playing ball . But his heigh his big hands etc helped out .
The definition of clowned
The good thing is, this can give a nice boost to the guys, electrify them.
#18 sounds like an actor. maybe its just good editing.
I love the support the WR voiced. TWICE. That’s called getting your mans back. Damn.
That boy look like Ryan gosling
6 minute video i saw one catch and i know it wasn’t the QBs fault
OMG THAT College is across my street
Goff isn't an all-pro QB.
“I like Brock”
Get nick Foles for the transfer
#18 needs to shut up and listen to the coach
Boy!
5:08 is that a chick on the team . A butch chick or a dude, that is a tranny Wearing # 86 Tell me thats not a chick or a tranny .
best plays, baker mayfield, american football
I'd be a little disappointed. I thought we just got an amazing qb, oh no it's just jared goff pranking us dammit
Who is themis guy i just clicked cause it looks funny buy a lot of Pepole know him is he like the number 1 player or something
I watched this guy in high school
"That's my quarterback!"...yeah, and the second he got a spot on a better team he'd peace out. Loyalty is great but that guy was just stupid. Stuck in high school mode.
pizza face needs to shut up hes never going to sniff any where near a good D1 school
Bunch of runts tbh, none of them look like D1 material
"What was yall record last year? Thats why Im here."
No one's falling for that hair.
That was awesome! ??
Priceless!!
I thought they were about to play rugby
hahaha That was great.
Number 18 got me dead
We are not waiting the NFL 28 year combat veteran????????????????????
When #18 talks about trying to get money, he is referring to a scholarship. Seems like a lot of people can't figure that out.
3:39 - "What's his name, Koby?" "Yeah he thought I was the punter". Actually his name is Dre Fogue, not Koby.
looks like the guy on that Kardashian show
Not sure who the young kid /wideout is but sounds like he needs an education and not D/1
Dude is a conceited douchebag
Sunshiiiiiiiine
I just wanna compete... what a cuck... YOU WANT TO WIN!
Sunshine!
I feel they try and stir away from D-1 schools cause they might get showed up lol or the D-1 players might not be as impressed ??????
Love how there going to junior colleges and not just some huge D-1 school ????????????
#18 - ‘all that green equals money; I’m trying to make D1 this year’... ... makes 6 yards off of 2 catches, the whole season.
5:08 number 86... what?
????????????
Whoa that's my name
Did they wonder why they were gettin filmed
#18 is a joke
Bio !! Ur not going to D one
#18 is a great example of how prejudice people are
Ventura sucks.
18 is a thug and young players like him with no respect are why the NFL is filled with trash "kneelers".
WOW that looks great but it has some sort
LMAO!!!....GOOD ONE!!!!.......
I'm giving him this year to redeem himself. If he trash this season again get him tf out LA. nigga waisting LA time
Showed up at my school Ventura College and I missed it!?? Still awesome though haha
He's only been in the NFL fo 2 years. Hasn't made a name for himself yet. Why would they choose a 2nd year starter over a real nfl qb Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady. Goff had a good season last year, but can he be consistent? If not then Goff will be one of those toss around QB's going from team to team, Jay cutler, Carson Palmer, Kyle Orton, Case Keenum, ...etc. I just think it's too early to start doing pranks on high schools/colleges when you've only been in 2 years.
Sorry I don't follow American Football, can someone tell me what's so bad about being the Punter?
They thought they was going to the chip.
lmfao he's bigger than every other guy on that field.
This would be better if he wasn't the same age as some of these kids
Ventura College is a nice place. Been there. Pretty sure that sandwich he ate was from the Jersey Mikes near by lol.
#18 is about as annoying as you can get
Are you the punter....lol
Is it just me or does number 50 look like Daniel Bryan but younger????
Jared Goff ? never heard of him
?? " Are you punter?" Jared Geoff you're just trash anyway sir Lmao
That wide receiver is a good kid, he sticks up for the quarterbacks, I like seeing that
18 is a guarantee that he wont make it to pro that mouth would never be accepted in any pro sport.
Amazing how far destroying the english language will take you....oh and checking the minority box.
That's cruel! It's like giving someone a fake winning lottery ticket! LMAO
1:50, you are a student, not an employee. You don't have a job at the school playing the position of QB.
Why is this always in my recommended? I don't even watch football.
Drey Fouge?
Why are the QB’s wearing rugby helmets?
Lol ...Thank you
#18 was a lil too mouthy to the coach in front of the other players
most stupid sport i have ever seen
One of the best pranks.
I had practice there today ??
Trying to get money ??? Bro your 5 feet tall sit down
These guys shouldn’t get paid if they do . They’re not pros and they won’t be pros
They should make part 2
Done well!
"Is 13 any good?" "...Yea...hes good." "What was your record last year?"??????
"You don't like him enough." - hahah that was great timing with that response from #18
Timing that route at 4:58... thing of beauty!
MAKE MORE VIDS LIKE THIS GODDAMMIT!!!!
Nice
I finally pressed this video
@ 4:58 how he caught him coming out the route though. He still not going to the super bowl though. #WhoDat
The teams QB be like" Ahh damn I am losing my job now" ??????

Man, Jared's taking a hell of a chance, what if he threw his arm out, man that would suck. I bet the team owner he's playing for has something to the effect his contract, and if he screws his arm out on anything other than the NFL games.
3:33 ok Terrell Owens
Hope #7 is successful
Still can’t believe Tebow is not in the NFL
Pretty cool.
#18 should stfu.
Brock domann their qb went to my high school he was so good
Brock domann went to my high school
Do a college freshman in high school team. Now that be funny
obviously 100% staged
3:21 that’s offensive to me because I’m a punter
2:52 is the the idiot kicker Mike Vanderjagt’s kid?
Was the disguise necessary?
1. "Can we make some f***ing catches out here!?" is hilarious. 2. If I were one of those players, I would be pissed at the end. Watching him shred the defense would get me excited about winning a championship that year!
HILARIOUS
Garbage
I don't know this sport. Is this impressive?
That sandwich looked gross.
The hairstylist chick is fine af @2:16
Bad edit. They didn't show the full pass trajectories. Dumb.
DO ONE WITH STEPH CURRY
#18 needs to check himself
5:08 #86 girl...guy... Lesbian hockey player
Tell the wide receiver to stfu he ain’t going D1
Is this football team real or actually good? This seems like a bad comedy
Ok that was BORING. where the hell was the "prank"? he deliberately overthrew the ball so nobody could catch it? HILARIOUS!
Much better then the fake old man pranks.
Number 86, is that a woman? What the hell
Nr88 is a woman?
What’s the deal with helmet lol. Losers I wouldn’t ever were that
Can we do this for basketball?
They all turn at the same time lol
??????
Y’all need more of these
best line "what u the punter"
These are fantastic. keep'em coming.
LMAO this was great do another please!!!
Goff has one good year and everyone thinks he's the next Brady... ????????????
Those receivers are trash. They can’t catch a cold.
18 is built like a pube
this is awesome.
i could not be in that locker room with number 18. ima end up telling him to stfu
C.T.E.
So they wear Rugby scrum caps in practice.
#18 sound stupid af
5:08 is that a chick . No fucken way . There is a chick on the team .
What was y'alls record last year? ........... That's why i'm here, right? LOL
5:08 was that a girl number 86?
Look at their helments
That's my quarterback ;(
I was a receiver played D1. Was on a high school team that was almost all black. (Im black). This quarter back (White Replaced) our starter when he moved to town. He had an arm couldn't move much but had a cannon for an arm. I was the star of the team and watched as other receivers dropped passes on purpose from him. My coach ran 100 percent full contact. Our offensive line kept letting people through to hit him. Kid kept getting up no complaints. Bruh Im talking about big hits. Finally after about 30 mins I figured enough was enough. I could tell he could throw. I went up to "maxwell" Our lead center and leader of the O line). I told him if one more person got through I was going to refuse to play. He thought I was joking but I assured him I wasnt. He told the line and they held it. That kid was special. He thanked me and we dormed up. I helped him with the team he helped me with my routes. We won a state title that year. You guys would know his name as he is in the NFL, we are still good friends to this day. (Bbq once or twice a month). I was better at a different sport than football and decided to go pro with that rather than a shorter NFL career. I still get NFL box seats whenever I want. The irony is the QB he replaced went on to be a great running back. Not the NFL but he was pro. Just remember guys play the game it all works out.
How is this a red bull commercial....lol literally didn't see a single thing about red bull
That was awesome LOL
I feel like Tom Brady could get to the Super Bowl even with those guys on his team ??
He sucks tho
Do one for Aaron Rodgers
"what was yall's record last year?" silence "that's why I'm here tho"
They must not watch the NFL
Stupid
HEs not hercules just an NFL all pro QB lol
Why is the little pizza faced nxgga talking so much?? Shut yo raspy voice azz up...
They just got punked.
I live across the street
Goff out there throwing ducks. ??
Coach introduces, “Jared Goff” Players on team, “ whose that?” clueless?!?!? Lol look at there faces!!
dog?
I live in ventura
What kind of helmet is that?
#18 is the type of teammate you want to have on your side on a football team. Dude clearly has his heart into the team and the game, and I love the way he stands up for his QB even to the coach. I bet you the coach loved that too
What if they didn’t know who he was lmao??
This team need faster wide receivers.
Bullshit, fake and staged.
I like Brock Me too You don't like him enough
At 6:24 you can here someone sneeze :)
Brock was so shellshocked that even after Jared revealed himself, he still didn't understand what was going on. You can see his face wondering why an NFL qb was joining his junior college team. His teammate had to shake him back to reality that it was just a prank. That day must have been he'll for him.
At 5:08 either 88/86 would make a cute girl or that IS a girl.
Those douchebags talk alot of crap about the transfer qb xD
3:31 THE DISRESPECTTTT “What are you, the punter?”
Bb
Jared Goff? Never heard of her
Let's see what happens with 18 in 2 years..... nothing
number 18 is from baltimore. I'd put money on it.
Why goff tho
do it with adrian peterson
That disguise was lame. A wig, some tattoos, and a mole and that was supposed to fool people? This was probably a setup and the players pretended to be surprised. No way some of them didn’t recognize an LA Rams quarterback being a team near LA.
dude you don't need to disguise Jared Goff
5:44 ... #86 have no clue who he is ahha
haha that was great, poor Brock kid tho had a rough day thinking he just lost his starting position because the new guy has a canon for an arm
Ryan gosling playing nfl now?
"Are you the punter?" LOLOLOLOLOL.
Brock ass????????
What does a quarter back do?
@venturacollege! Let’s go, #venturastrong.
Nfl qb trash 2nd string
Wood hve been better if coach not in on it.
That is the best they can do with the wig?? That stylist is a joke!
Whether it be actor, musician, or athlete....these kind of videos are awesome. And the better the role player the more entertaining it is. Like when jewel did karaoke. good stuff
these college kids look old. the nfl guy looks younger
LoL
I'm sorry but that 18 dude bugs the he'll out of me. Just have soñé fun play bro.
hahha
clark kent should have wore a wig instead of glasses
At 5:09 is #86 a woman?
The Ryan Gosling of Football?
18 was in on the prank. He's Tavon Austin's cousin and would've known it was Goff. That's why he was talking back to the coach like that. We don't know him to know what his true attitude is like. He was just playing his role. Some of yall stay looking for reasons to hate on people, yet we at home on computers and phones, but he's off playing college ball trying to live out a dream. That's childish.
I wish this video was longer lol.
There wide receiver hung in there fir every play.
He looks like such a prick in real life
Hahaha my hair
At first when I saw #87 I thought they had a girl on the team ????????????????
I live in SP right next to Ventura
Who is Jared Goff?
rams are the worst team in history
Best prank ever....
24 seconds " when i come out here and see green.. that means thats a lot of money i gotta make" and thats why there isnt really any more legendary players that play cause they wanna be great... idiot kids just in it for the $
"He asked if I was the punter" so insulted from that one comment lol but that might be the best position when you make it to the NFL. Million Dollar contract sit on the bench 90 percent of the game. Who wouldn't want to be that.
I wish they had done this prank with Matthew Stafford as the transfer. I guess even with makeup he'd be too recognizable.
I'm a punter :(
If you like minecraft subscribe to me
The second coach looks like an actor
Another boring American game
that was pretty lame
pure tns from the tweeb talking about green all the time
Still laughing!!!!
hardcore Houston Texans fan but this dude awesome ????
1:08 That pizza face punk needs to shut up
Did they add sound affects when he ate the sandwich??? Lmfao
"Can we get some faster guys here?" They probably had A LOT of running xD
That #18 is the type of guy I’d like to play against than play with
My favourite part of this video was when he drank the red bull.
"the whole team thought he was Hercules or something" lol
Ventura college? Never heard of that all girl school.
He looks like bizzaro world Ryan Gosling after all the make up and stuff
never heard of jared goff
wh was tricked, brah looks like jay cutler
Im actually friends with his second cousin, she goes to my school...Apparently shes only met him once and it was before he was drafted into the NFL
the short black dude was trippin... fam sound like terrell owens.. "thats my quarterback" bruh definately not goin pro with that attitude.. mf wasnt even a qb so why he so mad... they prolly cut dude after that cause i didnt even see em at the end of the video..
Jareed " are you the pounter" Dude "no im a quaterback" ??????
5:09 is #86 a girl?
One thing that’s clear is Jared Goff is a pretty big dude he’s a head above the other QBs and basically everyone else ... genetic lottery favors some
Man. Coach cucked his QB pretty hard for 7M+ viewers. Sheesh. Have a nice season kid.
Still can't believe I sacked this guy when I was playing high school football at San Marin high school. He used to go to Marin Catholic.
Wonder if Dom is gonna get drafted?
omg I'm dying. the jokes he had while undercover! this was the best one yet.
It's GOFF!
3:42 THAT VOICE IS DAKOTAZ
Dropping 70 Yard Passes on Them ??????
Coach sounds like an older, MUCH MORE CHILL version of John Gruden. "See the way he threw that thing in cover two?" Lol precise voice and syllable cadence.
Do this to mcneese state. That would be awesome
Did he say "I hope I don't scare him"?!?!
ummm...i have never heard of jared goff.
What college
Vc??
I'd love to see more of these episodes
No offense but that dude looked waaaaaaaay too small to go D1
This is dope !! Do Julio jones lmao
this is entertainment! Jared looks young so he pulled it off but we know the difference of talent and skill immediately from NFL players...
Lol he looks like j fred
Let this be a lesson. Stay awake in class.
Red Bull is poison
Please more undercover pro athletes videos !!!
I think I'd only last 10 minutes with #18.
Nobody's gonna ask what was up with those helmets tho? They looked like they were playing rugby
Sitting in the dressing room wasting his time trying to.disguise himself when he wouldnt be noticed walking down the street anyway
I doubt they would have been able to pull that prank off in 2018. LOL There's no way they don't recognize now.
#18 What a turd. Shut your pie hole and let your actions speak for you.
03:31 LOL!
Lmao "what are You the punter" no no ima Qb
Goff is so nice
18 is an annoying lil guy...hope he didn’t go D1
So gay
Would have been funnier if the coach didn’t know as well
the acting is fake by everyone
4th time watching this
Is that a chick at 5:08? Cool
drake?
Are they wearing scrumcaps
Clearly not playing for the love of the game. Strictly a money opportunity. That's why I've lost interest in football... And most sports sadly
Should've shown the team's QB's reaction more
Keep these type of videos coming this was good
this was so freaking cool salute
What’s songs at 4:42?
now bring in adult gohan
Show convince chief square firmly contest consideration leader install example its.
Vc #weplayhard
5:08 is that a girl
Number 18 sounds like a retard
They thought they where great then....
no.18 all about himself
Pretty sure number 86 at 5:09 is a lesbian...just saying.
Red Bull, Goff didn't make All-Pro. He made the Pro Bowl. There's a huge difference. Pro Bowl is a popularity contest and freaking nine quarterbacks made it last year, almost a third of the NFL's starting QBs. Goff made it as an alternate. All-Pro is much, much harder to make, as only two QBs a year get the honor, one from each conference. Goff had a fine season, but he was light-years from making All-Pro.
Damn. I played for Ventura in 2013. Not much has changed it seems
Damn that #16 guy should be playing d1.
Jonte broski
I love seeing things like this happen, it gives people much more incentive to be the best they can be and makes their day a day to remember.
Amazing prank!
Number 18 wildin'
"What was y'all record last year?" .... "That's why I'm here" Lmao
My cousin goes there!!!
He's like me "I got five minutes"sarfes down sandwich
Yeah, I'd risk injuring my arm and losing millions of dollars throwing to D3 guys for shits and giggles. Makes sense.
Why they gotta have him mic'd up when he's eating the sandwich lol the chewing sounds
hilarious
icke bester mann
that was a boring prank
yyyyaaaasssss
This was absolutely hysterical!!!
Lets be real, most people wouldn't recognize Jared Goff even without a disguise.
Goff is hilarious
Note render graduate properly down disability claim commercial football require.
Jared was eating a subway sandwich ??
I'm not even a sports fan but I can appreciate some genuine motivation and interaction with the younger generation, good job Jared.
This is dope, man.
Goff is used to passing to NFL wide receivers and before that division one wide receivers. You can see why some of his passes were off.
What!? Are u the punter!!! ????????????
I like how there's a girl on the team. Doubtful she made it.
Smh. Nasty chewing sounds
Why the added chewing sound effects??
Jay Cutler as played by Jared Goff.
I liked the guy that was defending his QB.  That's a real team player.
I looked it up they've won 7 strait bowl games
That was actually pretty cool.
They should have played this out a little longer. They could have really milked this one haha
badass
Clearly scripted with the black kid mouthing off.
What are you a kicker? LoL
He looks like Steven Crowder in the thumbnail playing a transgender Character
It's actually disrespectful to say that asking a qb if he's a punter is disrespectful.
very cool
terribly staged
After watching I thought this high school football but then saw the title and remember it said college football.oh boy
Better than Kris Bryant undercover ??
All my quarterbacks? Lol...How about all my recievers....
lol
A big sigh of relief for Brock...
“When I’m out here and see green that a lot of money to get” failed right when he said that
i don't think he flexed on them hard enough.
??
Jared goff looks like cufboys
He threw four/five shots ffs ..I wish you could read comments before watching video.. Then you'd see how shire they really are and views plummet..
5:08 Is that a woman?
They didnt have to dress him in disguise...no one knows what this guy looks like LOL
No one was happier at the end then number 15. He was probably thinking about where to transfer the whole practice.
A couple of relieved QB's
I’m dead as hell they probably had that whole team think they were making a documentary and that one guy who kept talking probably thought he’d get a lot of screen time
When I out here I see green dat a lot of money I get lmao all he’s good at is football nothing else xD
Nobody cares about the word, "Disrespect!" Do your job! Balls coming!!! Catch it you puss!
#18 will never make it! Attitude problem!!!! And Thats coming from an Assistant NFL coach... He would be lucky to ever go D1. Shut up and play your position 18!
This was on my birthday
Jared Goff is better than Aaron Rodgers
hahaha.. that was great ....
What are you the punter
Smack that zit encrusted midget in the mouff
that wig is so obvious
Throwing rockets
"You a punter?" Bahahaha
15’s dreams were shattered and then resurrected that afternoon.
3:30
That's funny!
I'm still trying to understand why the fake grass in Southern California ??
Loved how that RB stood up for his QB
"Are you the punter" ??????
Anyone else notice the Head Coach hired his son to be DoFO?
Wish y’all would make more of these, round yalls channel from these vids.
Eh, still got no TDs against my Vikings in 2017.
I'm pretty sure there is a diesel dyke passing as a College Football player in that team. #86?
The actual punter should be the one who’s pissed off
Gotta like the kid that stuck up for his QB
I want to see the behind the scenes footage of the rest of the team saying "f*** our quarterbacks, I want the new guy"
Good video mannnn ????
Wtf is D1 is that below universities?
That was awesome..
Make anthony davis play at collage
I like Brock
Hey guys...ah....who won the Superbowl ? The Double headed QB. YEAH BABY ! That's Nicky 6 and Carsen Wentz. The dynamic Duo !
Go Bears.
Lol
Mike Vanderjagt's kid's a QB? Guess he didn't want to be "an idiot kicker."
is that guy wearing a grill during practice?
18 : I like Brock Coach : I like him too 18: you dont like him enough Pause
That was badass
This was kinda dope. I played HS fb and two kids from my school went to nfl just b4 i played so they came back and lit us up amd we loved it. So much so that one of my guys from my squad now has a super bowl ring from tampa bays super bowl.
i went to the same high school as jarad goff, sadly i didnt meet him since he graduated like 2 years before me
Sad that the black kid is just mentioning money, instead of the love of the sport smh
god these players are so stupid
http://bestcashjob.online/?refer=503
You need to be at, 100%, maybe 99, to play in this league.
Everyone looking at him like his Hercules ??????
Sunshine
Number 18 sounds about as dumb as a bag of hammers
The funny thing is Goff really was like this his rookie year lmao
seems like a setup..FAKE!
That bitchy black WR pissed me off. I’d never wanna be his QB....
What was your record last year? That's Why I'm here!!! LMAO
You can tell those guys thought dere prays were answered when dey thought goff was gone be dere quaterback????????????????????
I liked how you heard the sandwich being chewed with a wet noise. Lol.
You should come to my school
Lol why are those guys worried? He's practically the same age and he still plays at the college level
pretty cool
Hey look, it’s Ryan Gosling with a beard and long hair!
I wanted the prank to last the rest of preseason ????
I still can’t believe the Seahawks didn’t run the ball. ??
Whoever was #3...he caught EVERYTHING thrown to him.
hmm, this wasn't much of a prank. I think there was one shot of the players reacting to how strong his arm was. just one shot. ..... the point of a prank on someone is the reaction you get from the victim of the prank..... one reaction shot was very unsatisfying.
brilliant
In the words of the Great Jim Rome.................EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:55 I love those sandwich sounds
Those receivers are skinny asf
Unbelievable ! This can be very awesome ! I don't think it's so convenient .
Talking up for his quarter back that's what's up
That guy knows there's no money to be made in college football right? (allegedly)
I love this! Freaking brilliant!
Lol they still don't know the nigga
buncha chuckleheads
so basically he not known otherwise they would instantly figure out the prank
Funny
first guy sounded like a younger, black forrest gump. a little smarter of course, just the voice
you should do this for a basketball team
#18 look and sound like a female
Made me a fan of the school and Jared
nigga said what was ya record last year? thats why I'm here lmaoo
#18 ain’t going D1 with that attitude and us against them mentality against the coaching staff, no sense of how to be humble
#18 is straight garbage. What a douche bag
More of this please
whats the deal with 86?
Best prank I’ve seen in a long time, the trash talk ???? epic. Well done ????
such a gay game, i cant bring myself to call it a sport.
18 is an idiot
Is this a real video?
One more thing.. no raping!
18 seem like the type of player who still thinks the leagues gonna call at age 30. Good luck to him tho
Ventura college football pirates 4 life this is amazing
Reminds me of that guy from remember the titans the cali guy
gained a lot of respect for Goff after this lmao, used to clown on this guy for being behind Keenum
okay youtube, i clicked on it
FOOTBALLS SO FUCKIN LAME....AMERICANS....17 GAME SEASONS. CONTACT SPORT WITH OUTTA BOUNDS SO YOU CAN HIDE. HOCKEY.. A CANADIAN SPORT. 82 GAMES. NO OUTTA BOUNDS TO HIDE JUST A WALL. BODY CONTACT MOVING AT HIGH SPEEDS. NOW THAT'S A MAN'S SPORT. CREATED BY REAL MEN. GO DRINK YOU LIGHT BEER YOU AMERICAN PUSSIES. LOL.
That's all you will remember..??whaaaaa bunch of babies
None of those receivers can catch lol
I don’t know why they added the gross sandwich eating sound in. That was just gross.
Sunshine
Ahahahahaha who the hell does 18 think he is
Can someone explain to me why the current players don’t want to accept a new guy to their team????????? seems pathetic
meat heads had no clue
Why are these fellas wearing my Grandpa’s helmet?
Money money money...someone should sit down and talk to that boy.
The Transfer, Starring Ryan Gosling, In theaters summer 2018.
"Don't like him enough." This punk has as#hole written all over him, and the fact that he has such a platform for the team speaks poorly about the team. Reading the comments supporting him speaks to the problems with our youth today. Hating for no reason. Being blatantly disrespectful because you can't understand what is being done. Too much tension and hate. Everyone needs to chill and support every single person they meet. Cherish and learn from one another.
I wanted to see Brock's face when the transfer showed his arm off for the first time ?? I'm sure it was "??"
what kinda bullshit 7v7 practice is this
this kool an all but on the low yall got the team hopes up thinking they got a QB like that on the squad lol js
My hometown of Ventura in the 805
You know what they say when you have 2 supposedly good quarterbacks... you have none. If neither is a decent starter that means they both are crap, plain and simple.
I think autocorrect made me say Jared Goff rather than “a guy who couldn’t throw a ball”
Shucking and jiving for the white man
Hahahaha they young guns got shooked by a pro
Good sports
This was great. Didn't know much about Jared goff. He seems like a real stand up guy !
Love the loyalty between that WR and QB!!
lmao what an awesome video .. Good Vibes .. Im Joe Perry
Can't help but laugh at #18, he's like radio of the team. D1 is a far dream for little man.
Number 18 must think he all American in the SEC or sum??man sorry as hell
All-Pro QB? Um no. That was Brady and Carson Wentz.
At first they did this with christian hackenburg but he was cut from the team
Interpretation o'clock tennis estate act suspend star clerk furthermore best Palestinian detect bus
Awesome
Tom Brady would take this team to the Superbowl! Facts...
Who?
Thats awesome
who’s Jared Goff?
These are great
Coach was nervous around the 2:47, and I felt bad for him.
Those neck tattoos kinda suit him
Why’d they give him such a shitty wig?
"...everyone was all in too....everyone thought he was Hercules!"
I live like 15 minutes away from Ventura College lol
Looks like Trevor siemiean
He look like Sunshine off remember the Titans ??
looking like a D3 high school
I wanna see Tom Brady
Never underestimate a no skin in fortnite
He didn't even do that good man lol
All fake and scripted.
15 saw his life flash before his eyes lmao
18 is a big mouth fool.
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Can you run? Ok.. the ball is coming. Lol
I thought it said transgender lol now it makes sense transfer
Lmao
They look better than the Browns
Goff is pure down to earth good guy
Why does he eat sandwiches like that
does anyone actually know what jared goff looks like in the first place?
Don't know much about football gear so what is that funny ''helmet'' they are wearing ?  Is it against the heat ?
Nigga out there looking like Sunshine from remember the titans. LMAO
18 is a diva.
no ones talking about that receiver who absolutely went in for his QB. good man
People forget that Terry is almost 50 while Kevin is almost 40. O.o
So fake but so funny.
That little, tiny, puny mosquito #18 won't make it much farther than those practices. Nobody is that disrespectful to coaches. All he thinks about is 'gettin' that money'. Stereotypical 'ignant' jagoff!
The players had no idea who he was... before, or after.
0:50 is that Thad Castle 3rd guy left????????
do more videos like this
My hair got in the way
these are great series
What these guys and Trump supporters have in common: they talk a big game but since they fucked around in high school they wind up where they belong instead of good jobs and D1 schools.
would have been better if you brought in Stafford & threw it 75 yards down the field to see their mouths drop
Nothing this fun ever happened in my football career. HA!
That little wide receiver is toxic
At 4:11 you just see the kicker all by himself setting up kicks
FAKE
Those are the gayest little condom caps! Are those things what this young generation is rubbing their pussies with! Cool!
IM FROM OXNARD, CA NOT 2 FAR FROM VENTURA, LIKE 10 MIN DRIVE LOL
fakeeeeee

The juco I go to looks nothing like this

Horrible camera work and cuts. Horrible. Couldn't really see how the guys were reacting with soooo many cuts and camera angles slammed together so god damn fast.
Obligation literature delay shock region recruit naked contact hit sink emotional.

Goff wasn't all pro last year...he was pro bowl.

Jared who?
Black guy said he's trying to go d1 he is 5'6 165 lbs LOL
Is #86 @5:08 a chick??
Everyone thought the coach was an idiot and he lost the respect of his entire team. Great job you ruined a team.
Ion think their is another qb in the league who can do this without being spotted
4:20 That's why i'm here. Whatchu mean? LOL!!!!!!
All pro????
Nice! Mr Goff carried my fantasy team and now provides some laughter. Thank you much!
Why can't that dude at the beginning speak English? Speech impediment?
Goff isnt good though lol
This comment stolen from Eric below: -- -- Dude looks just like Ryan Gosling, dude...
“Who’s was y’all record last year” bruhh??

I like this. More videos of this please
5 minute mark them boys were salivating at the chance to play with him lool. Ol boy was tightening up them gloves
I hope 18 doesn’t make the NFL
What was your record last year ...... ?? That’s why I’m here ??
Make more of these
#18 is a loud mouth.....he is toxic for that team. If I was the coach I would have already eliminated that instigator/bad apple!
Hilarious! LOL
Jared funny af ????
That was freaking awesome. It's nice to see the pros motivating young up and coming starts. #LoveIt
I adore Jared Goff!
Lol
Wait why did he need to put tattoos on
Nice1
3:31 lol
Awesome and hilarious!??
Why are they wearing scrum caps though
Ear fighter sacred restrict sanction revolutionary terrorism sand relative sodium stable pay.
Camera man needs to work on the reveal... that was poor, missed the crucial reactions at the point of reveal.
What are wele
Look like a basic QB! Still is a basic QB, I’ll choose Brock over Jared!
So weird to see people throw right handed, I throw left.
Jared goffs garbage
4:23 has me shook
Upload more of these pranks!!!
instead of doing this bs work on your craft this is why you'll never win a SB
Sunshine
"Damn, I was defending against THAT?"
Lol this is hilarious, how can you hate the LA Rams....? Plot twist....and I'm a Seahawks fan!!! Also if you're a Rams fan or from LA go follow and subscribe to my buddy LT "Combat Sports Talk" on youtube. He's a LA Rams fan and from the area and supports a bunch of other LA teams. Cool guy. So if you want to keep up to date on LA Rams news/insight go check out LT's youtube.
I cant stand his eating sounds
lol i can tell why those guys aren't D1. so petty and talk so much sht and overly competitive to a toxic degree. and they think being a punter is disrespectful
I don't think this would've worked with anyone other than him. This was perfect but it'll show them to play their best ball all the time
6:07 i thought i double tapped
they act like he's manning
Im a raider fan, but dammit jarod, you are so hard not to respect. Dammit
this shit's obviously fake
These black people only care about money and football. Why are they allowed to reproduce with these values
First
I wonder if one or two players figured it out: lots of cameras plus insanely talented "transfer" player, and pranks always happening on the Internet and TV. Hmm what's going on here? haha
Wait so was that FMG Ball??? #18 ?
3:58 everyone like i want that ball lol
my boi goff get em
lol..that guy is much too small for d1
You get money in D1? You ain’t transferring to bama son
He still ain't no Carson Wentz...go birds
#3 was decent
Are you the punter?
Foles > Goff
Yall know the giants in nba be traveling and get no calls
Muther fucker lmao
Even after the prank is revealed, you can see at least five guys thinking "Wow, so Jared Goff is on our team now!?"
You don't like em that much
reservation trail thirty railroad ought illegal criminal original convict store.
number 18 gotta go
These are the kind of helmets the NFL should be using.
Cool.
If only they got a good QB.
3:31 savage
You guys should do more of this
To many cameras. Have to find a way to be more discrete, even if it sacrifices a shot or two. Without the surprise it seems like it would be pointless. Like Undercover Boss has become.
does anyone know number 18 actual name
We need more! I like when Pros prank non-pros
Nice arm dang..
Scripted
He ain’t need a wig
Shout out to Oxnard!
Ryan Gosling
I thought he looked a little Jay Cutler'y at first
What a comeback Jared Goff made from last year
That was cool
1:21 anybody else wish he would STFU?
"are you the punter?"
It seem like yall was making fun of last chance U
5:09 number 86 is a female. thought it was a mens team?
“The whole team thought he was Hercules or something” BA.... You punks bad mouthed him from beginning to end.
#18 needs to realize it's about the team and not the player. A player that would attempt to undermine his coach like that needs to be benched. He has the arrogance of NFL, but he's not even D1.
“what are you the punter” ????
#18 is the definition of annoying
Lol thats the college my school usually feeds into
I'm just trying to figure out if #86 is a dude or a chick.  5:08, 5:29 & 5:45
Haha love these!
You know your spot is taken when the coach says donot care
What are they wearin on their heads
They were lowkey excited. They were gonna be winning games ??????
Not tryna hate on the rams, but r yall sure he wasnt actually missing those throws, and just lied to the audience that he was doing it on purpose? :)
Looks real convincing
Weak prank
The comments section of YouTube is a joke. Anyone can edit their comments at any time. In old comments sections, they could totally change the outcome of the conversation or remove their comments altogether. People could throw 1000 likes onto a comment and then that person could change that comment later to be something awful. Until Youtube changes this, the people won't be happy. Whole conversations can appear, disappear, or change on Youtube. Interesting.
In the thumbnail, Jared looks like the goat Jay Cutler
The guys making those catches n runs should get a second or third look. Good hands and placements
What are those helmets??
This needs to be a consistent series with NFL and NBA stars lol
Aye Red Bull y’all drinks the GOAT ????
No. 18 acting like a straight diva
This is GAY!!
#18 annoying af
"All Pro Quarterback" ??????
Love this, do more pranks with nfl players
I just became a fan of Dre Fogg.. I mean Jared Goff
Read and Throw at 4:57 was filthy
Sweet!!!
4:12 Hey I'm dre dom what's your name? dom dog? dom
That was awesome!!!????????
Awesome!! More please.
It is magnificent the LORD GOD is the only one in JESUS CHRIST AMEN KING DAVID
Damn he was taller than everyone
What was their record last year lol
These are my favorite kind of videos
he could of gone in as himself and I still wouldn't know who he was
What’s up with those foam helmets?
Very scenic view behind the field.
everyone talking about no. 18 but aint played a day of football or hell even went to college smh. let that man do him
This was a great video, awesome concept. .."Yeshua / Jesus is the way "
That wasn't obvious
fake
Park sponsor lot preference deputy economics buck thin magnitude friendship.
And then you realize he's not going to be your quarterback....
See guys. The gays can play football.
What was your record last year........silence LMAO
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough
“What are you the punter?” ??????
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
That WR out here defending his QB's like Tom Brady is the starter and Aaron Rodgers is the back-up..... c'mon bruh.
I didn’t know that was an NFL qb either...
5:08 is that a girl?
Hahahahaha this was awesome. “What are you the punter?”
I love seeing the reactions at the end of these pranks. The players look inspired and awe-struck at the same time
I wouldn't know Jared Goff even without that wig and tattoos lol.
That trihard7 that wears 18 is a snitch @ 1:23. and crybaby @ 3:34 . Dude makes VC look ignorant af. Stop snitching and crying and go get some KFC & watermelon in your Dodge Charger. Trihard7 in the chat. Cx
Rams fan here, I like Jarred Goff, he’s my qb, but at 1:48 when you have All-Pro under his name, that’s a lie, he’s never been an all pro, I believe your thinking of pro bowl, very different
What's you guys' record? That's why I'm here...????
That was great... Does Goff remember where the sun rises.
I’ve gone on that field
Football version of "uncle drew"
That was so good
Yes this was film by a GHOST CAMERA MAN And a ghost MIC . yes its all very very real. more liek real actors.
I play my high school varsity football games at VC
#3 WR is pretty good
Real cool??
OH REALLY? THEY WERE UNSUSPECTING EVEN THOUGH REDBULL WAS THERE FILMING.
I would love to sack him
Great gag.
This is brilliant ??
5:56 wtf is that
18 you will go div 1 let your game do the talking focus on your Craft hit them books ! Your a Captain lead them !
Cool but it ain't no UNCLE DREW!
I'd like to see the full version of this lol.. that's awesome
Jared goff is funny
Haha my old school!
Is #86 a girl? No wonder they're trash.
" SUNSHIIINNNEE" lol
This team is trash, they need to change their name to VD
Number 18 needs to humble himself. Im trying to go d1. D1 mouth with d3 height and skills.
i love the kid who equates going to d1 as going to get money lol
what's the deal with those weird helmets? are they for staying cool in the summer?
Not gonna lie. There were some savage lines in there. Lol
He’s a cool guy
That wasnt as funny as i thought it would be
when they talk you understand why they are in juco
Who else read transgender prank
#18 only wanted money
eventually match shade function host night colony actor ownership pursue cloth profile.
There may have been one D1 athlete on the whole field. This is not a college football team. Not even close.
Good stuff
"I LIKE BROCK". THATS who you draft. That guy stood up for his QB wasn't having it off the bat! lmao
10 times better than the Karl Malone and Anthony Davis one. That was just sad
Jared Goff, like Eli Manning before him has what Rocky called a 'Relaxed Brain'
Fricken awesome vid. I knew Goff the Football player, I love how this gave me insight into his personality, sense of humor, and his leadership. Great vid
What kind of helmets are thoose
I love it!!!!
The problem with this team is there’s too many white guys
???
This was a really positive thing for this young team too long run
That was amazing
Who
I live like 10 minutes away from this college lol
Dude looks 30.
Is #86 a girl at 5:07?!?
gets jumped PRANKED
... That’s my quarterback!
This may be a great way for college players to get a FasTrack to the NFL by having them unknowingly step up even harder in their practices. Team sports are like that, having just one incredibly amazing player makes everyone play harder.
Awesome!
Wentz is better though
*Ryan Gosling
4:13 - "Hey what is your name?" - says smth like Don - "Dog?" :DDD
Kris Bryant already did this..
The irony is.....he is trash ??
You don't get paid in D1 lol
Sunshineee
Goff’s gonna have a sickkk team next year
Rare footage of Uncle Rico in college
I call bs. scripted.
the glove of Freddy Krueger https://youtu.be/ahQsdFiVPRQ
to bad he cant do that in the pros
You could have had him play without the wig and we still wouldn't know who he is
where are the pads and helmets? Is it cus its practiice?
that dude is tiny but hes clearly got the respect of the team. seems like a good player
They had to bring in a guy like Goff because the elite QBs are too recognizable. Goff is good though.
they made him look like Sunshine ????????????
#18 is a real punk, pretty cocky for a nobody
Imagine if they did this with Tim Tebow. The VC 3rd string QB would have asked him if he was the punter after tebow's first 100 passes
Young Dolph voice "IT'S GOFF!"
Lit!! ^^
Fake fake fake
Duuuuuuuumb
l am sorry
Great vid, the guys were straight-up.
Fake
The first four minutes looks like Goff’s rookie season.
This is basically uncle drew with football ??
Peyton manning should do this
Hook line, sinker.
So cool. This makes me want to join the communist democrats of amerikkka and vote for hillary in multiple states.
Andddd they went 0-9 the following season
more of these would be cool
That one WR is obnoxious af
Should have pushed it further
Post more of this its pretty geeked
Dude still has tiny hands and fumbles when it sprinkles.
Whole thing seemed staged.
scripted
Freaking awesome
why did someone think including that loud mouth midget WR was important? all you did was delay his eventual job at home depot.
18 talking himself out of D1 and the NFL every time he opens his dumb mouth
Seems fake as no one recognised Rams QB.
“Drea Ffjog” is an anagram of Jared Goff. Clever
4:13 I died??
"can we get some faster guys out here?" damn lol
Plot Twist:
Junior college is the way to go. No lame redshirting. You get experience, rack up stats and get noticed then you start at a big school. It's easier to get a scholarship and start from college film instead of just beating a starter at practice. Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton, D Lawrence, Kamara, Hunt ect all took the junior college route. Don't be one of those IDIOTS who go d3 and get in debt 100 grand just so they can say they go to a university. School isn't a tramp stamp, go for function. Be smart.
"Trynna get money" Isnt that illegal lol
WTF are the Elmer Dude hats these kids are wearing?!
What was y'all record last year...?????? dude was lost af
Guy really likes brock
I'm bet on the client this win on time year
Goff is as inconsistent on the field as he is with his jokes off field SMH ????
Funny ??
SUUUUNNN SHIIIIINE
Better than those lame Pepsi clips.
Too much time on your hands...What was the point here? More time wasting bullshit! Who cares?????
????
that was good bay area.
At first I read it as transgender lol
aaron rodgers should do this
What's your name? Dog?
Jared fit right in. It's like he never grew up! ...
They should've brought in Coach Hines
Copied kris Bryant
looks like Ryan Gosling
That's Ryan gosling not Jared goff
1:46-1:50 the real prank. Smh, all pro
He should low key be on this team.
3:27 lmao..
This Is Wass Awesome
What was yall record last year o ok that is why im here???????? Lets Goooo LA
Jared Goff seems like such a cool down to earth guy...I'm a broncos fan but I hope the Rams get the Lombardi this year especially for my boy talib
Why they wearing scrum caps?
We pissing our pants yet?
lol someone shut this #18 up
Mine for Bitcoin. Really cheap entry point $60 per TH! https://hashflare.io/r/DA42204A
haha i had no clue -_-
For some reason at first I thought it said Transgender Prank ????
You’d think right away they’d know that was ryan gosling cmon
Obviously staged.
Goff you're drinking red bull, Tom f*ckin Brady says you're doing it wrong.
Redbull gives you dreams
Let’s go VC Pirates!!!!!
Brock was shitting bricks seeing Jared throwing long ??
Not long enough. I mean, he didn't keep the wig ling enough.
Without the transformation I still didn’t know who he was ??????
well done !!!!
#venturastrong
Staged but cool
Got em!
"What was y'all record last year tho?......" Lol
You fast try catch it
"what's your record last year" ??????????
#18 a clown ??
They are all white
He swollen that sandwich.
Crazyyyy
I'm a huge Rams fan, I think I might have maybe reconized him lol
fake
wow just such a genious video idea. impressed
what's your name? dog?
TOP KEK goys
He kind of looks like Tyler Breeze with the wig on lmao
Advanced grave briefly sensitive diplomatic cattle jeans mark prohibit glad hit.
Goat
Lmao at that guy that said he would remember it for the rest of his life. That concussion will get him CTE.
Why the makeup? Nobody recognizes this chump...
There should be wayyyy more pranks like this for the skilled positions
Too funny!
But nobody cares about Jared Goff
That WR is noble for standing up for his QB
“That’s a lotta money I got to get” ...... Glad you’re out there for the love of the game you fucktwat
i want to get 5000 subscribes pleaseee :)))
These pranks do not normally go this well. Well done, Jared. Well done.
He looks like that new gay quarterback in the movie we are titans
The punter scene was The best part
Reality is, out of all those college dudes on that field, maybe one (1) of them will make it to the NFL. I wish them all luck.
5:13 That Jim look from the Office??
great job
0:57 Instantly lit a fire under number 13.
This juco team was 8-3 last year so they are pretty competitive
Imagine if i went under disguise, i’m pretty sure everyone would know it’s me when i sling it rolling to my right off my back leg.
Madden awareness ratings just went way down on all you guys..
Jared: what’s your name ? player:dom Jared:dog? player:no dog Jared:ohhhhh dead asfffff
this is one of the better staged pranks I have seen.
Go CA Bears!
The black athletes definitely had a problem with them acting like they were going to try to replace their quarterback. Respect
Oh my god he looks like a douche ???? but he still balled out
this is fake AF
nobody gives a bleep about this prank
The helmets tho??
I'm calling it the la rams are going to win 2019 superbowl
Goff looks like Ryan Gosling
Red Bull has one hell of a writer or whoever, nice work.
how do you bring a film crew in and not expect something ?
THIS WAS AT MY LOCAL COLLEGE VENTURA COLLEGE
Awesome ??
They need to do one for Basketball
I watched the game his high school won state.
Lol how do they even fall for this.. the coaches are laughing.. it feels more like scripted reality TV show than a prank haha
I like how all the defense gets mad and gets up first
I like the receiver he didnt sell out his boy though !!!
Who is jared Goff?
Thomas Duckett #3 best rb period.
Hercules lol
All these athlete "prank" videos are great!
It doesn’t matter if you not a D1 player you can still make it to the NFL??
“im tryna get money this year, i’m tryna go D1” so you gonna get paid for going D1? ????
Lollll this is in the city I live in what's going on here
#18 watches too much hard knocks.. he's a clown
is a colts fan and sees the name vanderjagt TRIGGERED
If he had fumbled the ball then I would have known it was Jared Goff.
I love that they use Rugby Scrum caps
I love pranks
I really hope that guy doesn't go D1
I broke my femur last week from football
i could tell that's jared goff from a mile away
"Are you the Punter?" That was really good!
02:06 __ If Goff is referring to his senior season of 2012, then no, Marin Catholic did not win the "State" championship. They lost 38-35, to Madison, in the State Division III Championship: __ http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/15/sports/la-sp-1216-madison-marin-catholic-20121216
How do they justify to the players the cameras all over?
What are you looking at?!
No need to wear a wig
The ?? on and off the field
Come on my channel!??????
Dak would be a great prank for a team but can’t throw 10yds to save his life.
Follow Me :)
Who would drink Red Bull at their football practice?
3:30 LMFAOOOO
Is this Ventura cc in CA
Hello, Humans. A dark lab creates loads of questions. The questions cause more questions, that lead to many more questions. What is the absence of light? It's darkness. What is darkness? The absence of light. We need more darkness to help us understand the light. The bright lights give us dreams of mad darkness. Trapped somewhere in the darkest shadow of our minds. The darkness is our friend and the light is our greatest unknown fear. Allow the darkness to take you into the light that fight with the dark shadow. TERRANCE OUT
evil extreme sound litmbsn address male post towards measure thousand limit.
Good thing he is an unrecognizable frat bro already
Every day Jared thanks his parents for not naming him Jack
Lol 18 is barley big enough for pop warner league.
That guy needs to just shut up
Black mighty mouse you are not going d1
#18 is a TEENY TINY WANNA BE...he’d get CRUSHED in the NFL...he really should SHUT HIS SHITHOLE....he will NEVER see an NFL field unless he buys a ticket! If he was so good he would’ve been picked by a D-1 school from the start...SCRUB!
That NO NAME LOUDMOUTH who, in his “words”...”I jus tryna get mah munee..” WHAT MONEY were you promised? is this “D-1 school” you’re talking about even EXIST? WHOS PAYING YOU this money you speak of? STFU scrub!
I love it. These guys are still trying to live the dream. I love this game man
I see green I got money to make. What a douche
Awesome..!!!
OMG I LIVE HERE
An age old concept but everyone was oh so clueless. Sure. They did not even try to act surprised.
Is slap that lil black boy
help me hit 2k views on my new song?????? https://youtu.be/8IbR5WV0nnI
Ventura!!!! 0:
Ha!!!
My Quarterback #Rams
I did not know if his throws were good or bad cause i don't know this game
Never seen anyone so scared of competition? It's like they are screaming please dont challenge us coach. You can tell the disruptive black kid in the locker room wont go pro with that attitude.
That black guy talk to much
He seems cool.
Why does he look like Ryan gosling at 2:25
Wtf I didn't know it was jared Goff... maybe cause i didn't see him fumble.
Holy sh$t I thought it said transgender prank! Hahahaha
So, did he make the team?
I can watch a whole series of this. Need more lmfao
Made him look like ryan gosling from remember the titans
Go Rams can't wait till next season
Sub to me
I was literally drinking a red bull when I saw this on trending
I wouldn't know Jared Goff if I bumped into him.
someone give this man an oscar
Chad
You fast? The balls comin'.
Tf I live in Ventura and never head about this
They didn’t think anything was up when they were being filmed constantly by multiple cameras?
Hope those qb’s make the nfl
5:59 the guy below jared goff is wearing the wig lol
What are the practice helmets they have on? Are those real guardian soft shells they wear over helmets or just guardians made for no helmet underneath?
That little man who likes to talk cracks me up. Hamming it up for the cameras
Goff is rocking the long hair.
this was boring to watch
What you do when you lose in the playoffs
Someone needs to pull is off with some Basketball player.,. It’ll be hard asf because there faces are so well known but you got it
What's Chris Rock doing there?
You mean Ryan Gosling?
Lmfao mean but hilarious. Great lesson too
yo this is my school!
Director of the video: "WHY IS THERE NOT A RED BULL IN HIS HANDS? SOMEBODY GO OUT THERE AND GIVE HIM ONE RIGHT NOW."
??
why'd he wear a disguise? No one would have recognized him anyways.
Still number 16 lol
0:45 Brock was the QB of my high school's team. Weird seeing him again.
My community college
18 finna get cut.
I love how that kid talks about money all the time. You will go no where with that attitude.
Who’s Goff ? What team is he on ,the bengals lmao.
he is good at this
teach4theheart.com/how-to-stop-doubting-your-salvation/
what are those helmets
I love the ones where it really does seem like everybody is clueless.
1000 COMMENTET
Dre Foag lol
I like Goff he is a funny, unique dude.
That's soooo cool
i would of been like after he revealed himself, " OH NO! we suck again!!!"
Goff: "What was y'alls record last year?" Doug: "Pshhhh..." Goff: "That's why I'm here right." Doug: "What you mean?" ??????????
He looks 30.
Did they really need to disguise him? It was likely that none of those guys would have known who he was anyway.
Is it normal for football teams to train wearing rugby scrum caps?
5:56 Melissa McCarthy out here playin O-Line
What's with the things on their heads?
Why are they wearing scrum caps..
Oh that Jarred Goff... What a trickster
Who’s Jared Goff?
Who this bum saying I need money haha. Bruh your not a Division 1 athlete haha
Fake
he look like the dude from yes theory
Bigger question is what is ventura football???
1:48 He’s not All-Pro, he’s Pro Bowl
Why do I see a VC reality show coming? I claim copyrights on that.
This is amazing ??
You guys should try to do a transfer episode where you use a professional lacrosse player
When did Jared Goff become all pro? Tf
wassup with the helmets
can it be any more scripted?
Don’t know much about him but he is funny AF
Y’all should do Butte College . BC Pride ??? 2013 champs
How did they not realize. I would instantly recognize him.
What's with the 1950s helmets?
That was awesome and fun to watch.
Jared Goff. Go Bears!
These videos are great in concept but come on, you're telling me "make up artists" can't do a better job than that wig? And you're telling me these kids can't tell off the bat how fake he looks? Where's the budget at red bull, I could go to the corner store right now with 20 dollars and make my self look better hidden than this.
Bum
These are great! Please keep doing these Red Bull
#18. What a joke. I’d throat punch him if he were my teammate....
Brock was pissed
Our qbs are pretty good why are you here...what was y'all record last year....??..thats why I'm here
This is so staged lol
I like this dude so much more know lol.
Lol does #18 even start? Team is trash.. I’m sure a high school team would beat them
3:43 lol ya so disrespectful
WR didn't go D 1
Punked
5:08 is 86 a girl?
Nigga said we all that he was Hercules ????
Brock was the quarterback for my high school. Definitely a solid guy. Glad to see him at this level.
0:32 tight end xD
This was dope, y’all have to do this often
Whoever added sound effects at 1:55 needs to be exiled.
You knew the qbs were happy af when they found out there jobs ain't getting taken
Dudes name is broski lol
Who? What NFL team he plays at?
Dallas star tatt????
Thank you for this clip ??????
plot twist: not funny
Goff seems like he'd be a really chill dude to play with. Just a genuine teammate.
Those helmets would take away concussions! People would worry about thier face too much to smash someone with thier heads
At 5:09, look at #86. Apparently transsexuals play football now... I guess if your team wears scrum caps at practice then you are probably used to being gay.
That was funny ??
What was ya record last year ? Lhh
"What was ya'lls record last year? Oh, that's why I'm here." "Whatchu mean?" LMAO he was disrespectful as hell right there
Brock was so relieved ????
Looks like a young kyle orton lol
I need more highlights lmao
Did he still need sean mcvay telling him what to do every play?
He wouldn't need the disguise, no one would recognize him anyways.
Rams went from a mediocre team at the start of the season last year to one that had a shot of the Superbowl. They were the most interesting team with a incredible story arc..The new QB, the great D line..the passing game..and that incredible punter..I hadnt watch FB since 92'(and was a Cowboys, and Giants fan...Ravens as well )..and with all the politics ruining what is suppose to be an escape from the normal work week crap I had no interest..the Rams(a team I never cared for) brought all my love of FB back..cant wait for the new season to start...Go Rams!
Good prank
#13 is Jay Vanderjagt, son of NFL kicking legend Mike Vanderjagt - he's even wearing his dad's old number.
Why he kinda look like a fat hippie
Dawg that’s my nigga Albert #69
Why does he look like Ryan Gosling?
Dope!!
This was better than the Kris Bryant one
This looks so fake
Does the kid trying to get money playing for a DIV-1 school realize they don't pay college athletes?
He put on a clinic vs dudes that’ll probably call him a bum when they watch him play on tv lol. Just goes to show how much harder the league really is
“l'll remember this the rest of my life" Great video!!
Looks like Ryan Gosling
I played here for high school
he looks exactly like jared goff
jupid guf sucks my red balls
My guy Jeff Fischer tho I see you bro
18 lookin like a beta man
hilarious... very well done
#18 only had 6 rec yards last year talking about he feels disrespected lmao... your stats are disrespectful Mr.D1 lmao
0:57 dudes like “wait till my dad hears about this”
I don’t know what’s more funny...The video itself, or the 230 butthurt Niner fans that disliked the video..lol
go get a bat,and drop 18. . . mouthy douchbagger.
Not as interesting as Uncle Drew but still dope ????
SO cool!
#18- “all I want is money”
Awesome prank
That’s cool
Awesome!
Those qbs must be pissed
That realization from the team that it was a prank and they'll still have crappy QBs
#18 is from baltimore
Gotta do Antonio Brown with some high school or juco
Why do they all have mics in there Jerseys?
18 need to calm down just a little love his passion but others might see it differently and it could hold him Back
whose jared goff?
I always wanted to see this happen. A pro play against college guys
Why does #18 keep talking G about making money? You ain't gonna see that anytime soon buddy playing at Ventura
"Do I have 5 minutes to eat my sandwich?" Proceeds to eat half the sandwich in one bite
Is this guy a moron he's trying to get green he's talking about trying to get his money to do you don't get money going to D1 you don't get money until you make it to the NFL the fact that you're not at a D1 school means that you didn't make the cut 2 get to the top Echelon of college football. That doesn't mean you can't make it that means you should probably stop open your trap and putting in work cuz you got a hell of a long way to go brother
trash #18
entertaining redbull ad is entertaining
Well considering he plays like a high school kid I would be wondering why he was there too.
I watched the whole thing, and I'm pretty upset about it.
This was awesome!!!
do this for another position
Those other quaterbacks sucked
That’s my QB! #mobsquad ??
Truth be told, he didn’t even have to dress up. I wouldn’t have even recognized him walking on the street lol
VC Pirates 4 lyfe!!!
I thought the thing he had on his head was a joke like the old style helmets
He's a funny dude...could be on sitcom.
Lol I thought it said "Transgender Prank" that would have been way more entertaining
This is a million times better than kris Bryant’s transfer
#3 7 and 9 was actually going a lil crazy
Carson Wentz is still MVP
Why’s he wearing rugby headgear?
Wentz should do this
Is this scrpit?
Home Town 805 Ventura California 93001
5:56 well that guy looks a little disturbing
I love how the coaches can't keep a straight face
This one was way more fun than the Kris Bryant one. The first one with the community college
Imagine he got outplayed by their qb
Oh wow the qaurterback of a team that didnt win #EAGLESFAN4LIFE #SUCKITRAMS #COLLEGEFOOTBALLISFORPUSSIES
That QB #13 has to be the son of Mike Vanderjagt aka the Idiot Kicker, right?
Wtf I go to that college ??????
Lololol I don't even know who this guy is.
These are dope. More of these.
Being from St. Louis I wanted this dude to fail...but he’s talented as hell and seems like a likable guy.
So fake..i couldn't even finish it
Scrum caps?
Jared going to win the Superbowl for the Rams
Why are they wearing those stupid helmets?
C R I N G E
He was really good at this.
Fake
Guys I swear I just got free $1256_real money from this_amazing website>>>>pypmon.win/?Xuvcxb Try once.
That school is trash
We need more of these pranks
Number 18 already a diva
SMH Number 18 is already a diva...
Just goes to show you the high level of a pro.
5:08 Is that a chick?
They needa bring in a WR
Reveal at 5:05 This was as good prank. They all got Punk'd in a good way.
Aye my hometown college??
#18 has a respect problem. In my day he would have been taped to a locker overnight.... Hey #18, quit flapping your dumbass lips.....
I liked that wide reciever wanting his Qb regardless
RAMS NATION! We're STACKED THIS YEAR. Both sides of the ball. SUPER BOWL BOUND. LA REPRESENT.
When he said, I know we all talk about VC...I had a flashback to Vietnam.
My school representing
I bet the dream of playing in the NFL by #15 (the qb) was absolutely crushed after seeing what an NFL qb is like in real life. It was probably a good thing because he realized he needed to focus on a class & his work career.
You really needed a wig? Nobody would recognize him in his hometown.
Yoooo he was savage af ??????
VC is our rival :/
the guy at 0:24 sounds just like chris Rock lmfao
PG blue mountain state
Good prank, this happens at junior colleges so it’s not out of the norm. Dope idea
#18 is a loud mouth.
pffff.... you're kidding.. right? Money can buy most anything. But head on ya'll. Might as well split up his focus on what is really important..this coming season.. right? please~
Fake fake fake
#18 the type to right ride for his teammates. I like that loyalty.
Redbull be behind all these pranks these days
Ay I blocked forJay Vandy #13 in high school!!
That WR is garbage and clearly bad for any team.
That’s actually Ryan Gosling in a Jared Goff costume in a Dre Fogg costume
bro ventura is 15 min from where i live that’s so dope
Good joke
Fake and staged. No prank here you gullible morons
Don't worry VC. Jimmy G WILL make him look like a d2 qb this year. Falcons already did.
Would have been awesome If Russell Wilson can do this but since he is so recognizable by his physical traits it would be too easy to spot him.
Disrespectful kid! " You dont like him enough" smh
That was so much fun
#staged ???????
Lmao
Jared Goff is a trash talking legend ????
Well done quarterbacks were thinking were screwed.
What was your record last year???......(dumbfounded look) .....yeah that's why I'm here
Great... Nice to see them having a good time. God bless them all....
At 5:09 .. is that a girl ?? Number 86... looks like it yo . Ahaha cool if so I just can't tell
Whoever that dude was who was sticking up for Brock... I like him.
Lmao but they got smacked by FCC 2 years in a row
Love this video??
His last names broski
a whole makeup truck for a wig and a tattoo
Yuh this my college boyz...
This guy's definitely smurfing
Amazing prank! Hahaha this cracked me up pretty good! Love all the players reaction when Goff takes off the wig haha
?????? them boys was worried
I went to saddleback college and we smacked up these dudes
I guess you could say the coach... went to Jared
lol more of this
Lol went to high school with three of these nerds.
All pro quarterback is a stretch lmao
Lmao I love when you make Prank videos like this RedBull.
glad i dont play with #18 look like the type get beat on routes , get ran over then cry after the game apologizing ?? this video was amazing though
Good one !!
Everyone complaining about #18 attitude but they don’t realize that most of their favorite players act the same way, dawgs gotta eat
Wonder how those WR’s feel Like being thrown to By an NFL level quarterback... Some of them will get the chance to do that one day.
Ohmygod is that Ryan Gosling?
LMAO "you don't like him enough" that's a damn teammate
Receivers are worse then guys playing flag football
805 represent
18 needs to shut the F up. total diva and disrespectful. I can;t never root for a guy like that big mouth diva
0:33 imagine if I never met the
18 Bout To Cry Like TO. "That's My Quarterback" ????????
Goff > Brady
MORE MORE MORE MORE!!
Jared goof is a privledged white little boy
Pepsi is that you
He sounds like Roman Atwood
The QB was like "I'm NEVER getting out of juco" LMFAO
That was great!
??? Pause the video and click this 5:56
??? Pause the video and click this 5:56
I like number 7 he backed up his talk and had character hopefully he goes to the league
Well Redbull, you've ruined my life, I'm addicted to Redbull and my Teeth have rotted out in just 2 short years, even with brushing them twice a day, I can't afford to get them fixed even through the Veterans administration. I live everyday withdrawn from my friends, depressed and I no longer work because my mouth always hurts, I've tried to quit drinking them but I can't. At least you was able to make me laugh a little bit with this video. This is 100% the truth. Put me in one of your commercials, you'd never sell another drink.
He’s Ryan gosling playing football for a film
Why they wearing scrum caps tho?
Is it me or that #18 look trash
Beautiful.
Better than the kris bryant ones ??
This one was absolutely awesome! I've watched a few others and the players seem to ocasionly catch on! This one, clueless! Great job guys! Laughed hard at this one!
#16 is pretty trash can't believe he even got his hands on the football
Goff isn't all pro
GOFF!
I can see why 18 isn’t in D1. Who needs a big mouth with an attitude?
There weren’t ready
This is great
Still sucks
That's pretty cool
Love these pranks
Too bad they couldn't get a good NFL QB to do this.
WHEN I'M OUT HERE AND I SEE GREEN, THAT MEANS THAT'S A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY I GOT TO GET My dude, you know you don't get paid even at the D1 level? ?? He's still my hero.
#18's name is Antonio Brown LMAO
#15. 5:44 "Thank God Thank God Thank God Thank God"
Where's all my VC people at?!
I wanna know who were the players that still didn’t know who tf that was after he took off the wig. Kick them off the team
Anyone in the future making pranks please try to make it to where cameras aren't so visible. Its such a dead give away. "They're making a documentary or something". C'mon..
Damn; Jared really does have a true NFL arm. For a shrimp like me, I can’t help but admire his passing ability. Incredibly strong snap of the arm and shoulder as he releases the ball. Very cool.
Dude went undercover as Sunshine from remember the titans lol
Who takes 3 mini bites out of a sandwich?..
Everyone's like, who's Jared Goff? Should have brought in Wentz.
Lmao i take classes at vc
Players' dreams of a JUCO national title evaporate.
Number 18 is just trying to be on tv
#18 needs to be cut. Plays just for money and talks back to the coach. D2 trash
That sigh of relief when he found out he won’t be a bench warmer ??
Who?
Normally they use superstars for pranks...they probably out threw system qb Goff
lmaooooo they still had no clue who he was after the reveal
hey look it's sunshine....????
Wentz is my quarterback Eagles is my team but Goff is a beast. That prank was awesome. Lol
That is the WORST transformation ever...
I loved that.
This video was funny, amazing, and inspiring! I wish more quarterbacks did this for so many great college teams. It would be quite motivational!
So when does Jared get his F1 test? If Tom Cruise can do it, then so can he.
I literally attend this college, how did I not here about this.
That was awesome. "what are you, the punter?" Best line ever to diss a QB.
I wish we got some better angles on those throws. Maybe some mics on the defensive side too.
Someone has that UCF swag
He asked if I was the punter :-(
Aye Ventura!!!
What's with the retard helmets?
It's so interesting watching 7 on 7 now a days. Everyone is wearing head protection. It's become the standard. When I played ball in high school in San Diego, we were the only team wearing head pro. To be honest everyone else thought our coach was crazy and we were just sissies. This was back in 2002-2005. Now it's nice to see how ahead of the game our coach was.
Dope
I hate when players when they think they good and they not even D1
One black dude talking about getting money..... better grow another foot and a half and gain 50-60 pounds of muscle before he gets payed to play football sorry
Go Moorpark. But this is Cool none the less!
LMAO.... Not really a Rams fan but now I'm a Goff fan!
The real prank is that those players actually thought they have a QB who can read Cover 2 & has deep ball accuracy ??????
Probably didn't need the wig. No one knows what most NFL players look like
This almost made me forget about the Bull Semen, touché Red Bull
Hi Im Jared Goff and Im acting like Jay Cutler
That was tight!
I met Jared golf at a camp with Conor Crotio.
That was pretty good.
I live across the street from ventura college I'm so mad because Jared Goff is my favorite qb
Lmao lmao he looks like sunshine from remember the Titans!
I saw Jarod Goff play high school football against my son’s school in Northern California. Glad to have him as QB for my LA Rams.
Jared Goff seems to be a couple of inches taller than everybody else at Venture. Funny how he doesn't really look that tall among the Rams. I guess all those fridges that call themselves linemen in the the NFL mess with your perspective :)
Couldn’t be my QB. My QB is working on his game so he can win back to back Super Bowls ??????
Goff need to gain some weight
3:31??
Redbull love this prank, do more!! Pls
Red bull is delicious, and they give athletes the shot they need to win! Let dudes jump from outer space! #freeredbullforlife
So what was the #18's reaction when it turned out to be Jared Goff? Wanted to see that
#18 is a scrub
Awesome
#18 is Tavon Austin's cousin. He was in on the prank.
You know his teammates were upset the new star qb wasnt actually a transfer
He’s probably worse than them
I feel like the team already knew. Just think about, is a college football team really gonna have a bunch of people out on their practice with cameras for just a transfer... I bet they all knew something was going on
Lmfao they probably thought he was trevor Lawrence first sight
#3 going places ????
That's why Iam here lol
i live 20 min form VC lol
You guys should do more transfer pranks
Brock was not entertained.
Poor kids thought they were going to actually win some games this year...
If you were fooled by this, you either (1) don't follow the NFL or (2) have prosopagnosia.
That one dude gets it. step 1 go D1, step 2 GET PAID
Please post the full video
"I'm tryin to get the money yo go to D1..." lol kids don't learn a thing do they? ??
"dog what was your record last year ? that is way I'm here" talk about disrespect LMFAO
It's Randy from that 70s show!
#18 disrespected my number. Can't stand rah rah no game having scrubs. I used to play for VC and some of these wideouts are embarrassing themselves .
Lmao. Got’em!!! Good laugh ??. Go Rams????
Good stuff??
I wish this video would've been longer.
They shoulda brought in Jeff fisher as interim coach to make him look like an actually transfer qb lmao.
You can tell 18 is from Baltimore lol TEWWW
No highlights for #18? He must have been busy filling the water bottles.
More like prank on one dude, Brock. I'd transfer.
Jared Goff looks like “Sunshine” off Remember the Titans??
Omg!! Loved this! More More More!!!!!!! More football
5:57 .. the dude in the middle. lol
Coolest thing in this clip... Jonte broski...
Fake. They all knew who he was.
“I don’t freaking care if I brung in a NFL quarterback”
Tell me 13 doesn't look like josh mccown
That feeling when the receivers realize they gotta go back to the same shitty QB lolllll
That kid for sure thought he lost the starting spot ??????
Can y’all do Carson Wentz when he returns?
Lol dude isn't going D1. Probably doesn't start at Ventura lol.
Brock was lowkey scared hahaha. Sigh of relief after he found out it was jared goff hahaha
18 needs to shut his mouth
Would I be the only one laughing if he did trouble and got cut ??
Woo Ventura county we made it!!
I can’t take them serious with their helmets
Number 7 was the only good wide out lol
That's my quarter back! ????
Jared goof
What tf are they wearing on their heads? What are we in the 1800s??
Bro at 1:15 stuck up for his teammate
Those receivers are garbage
Cal Bears
Ayyy my bro Jay V.
That’s my city bibbas
Smh someone get jay cutler
Hilarious ! See you soon
Never heard of him..
Uncle Drew
Those other QBs still hate him
Do Tom Brady next. I wanna see Tommy gun a seamer into number 18's throat
Still looked bad
Lmao this poor guy.. Going D1 and then NFL, the chances are about 1%.
“I’m trynna get money this year I’m trynna go D1.” Yep, definitely a team player...
He looks nothing different, he should have put a fake nose and beard on
Dak Prescott made one, but it couldn’t be used. He missed all the open receivers by 10yds
Why didn’t he just bring in Colin kaepernick?
All of the guys who thought they could play at the next level just got a reality check of what a top tier player is. Awesome.
Lol he low-key looks like sunshine from remember the Titans ????
Lil bumpy face kid (18) is corny af
Tatts gotta stay
That you Sunshine?
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Clearly Jared
i need a basketball one next.
Rams fan since 1967 and proud of it. GO RAMS....
Uncle Drew did it best.
What is this? D2? D3? NAIA???
Where's 18 at on the catches?
That dude needs to shave that golden neck beard
I know this will get buried, but props to Red Bull for not obsessively putting their logo/product everywhere and forcing screen time. I only noticed one obvious product placement shot in the makeup trailer. You can see @5:46 that someone put a Red Bull into Jared's hand in between shots and the final cut didn't try to overemphasize it. The placement didn't work so they didn't force it. This video likely won't (consciously) cause me to buy more Red Bull, but as someone who consumes way too much media I appreciate this kind of advertising. Thank you.
5:24 “are you kidding me!”
Aye VC that’s what’s up
More of these
Sophomore year we had a coach with PTSD from the army and he would snap on us and he knew so many different punishments and one day it was 97 degrees out he says we all fucked up wont tell us what makes us plank and on the count of 10 turn around and run 5 laps. Second we turn around all the coaches pelt us with water balloons??
Wish you guys did the baseball prank when I played at VC. Lol this is great
5:08 is #86 a girl?
You’re trying to get what money ? Your FASFA money boy????
Hey Jared—- I used to help teach kids baseball at Albert’s Park San Rafael with your dad ... ask him about how he would hit golf balls from home plate... GOOD TIMES!!! And ask him what was it about UB40 he liked?!!!! Jerry Goff was a three sport athlete !!! SO RARE!!!!
Wanna see Deshaun Watson do this lol.
I'm happy for Jared a lot of people were writing him off after his rookie year. He worked his butt off and made a Pro Bowl
Lmao go Rams
All those cameras and crew members and still all those meatheads couldn't figure it out it was a prank. Sheesh.
Would have been more funny and cool if he said tupac tupac dusty dusty or RICK FLAIR RICK FLAIR i love him
You know they used to say that VC stood for "Villains & Criminals" hahaha #GoPirates
This guy is nothing without Gurley. Most overrated QB
I think #7 may have caught on when he got close up
?????? GOFF
who?
Very funny!
Their prolly like "damn, we were gonna win with him."
Wait a minute. Did it just say “all pro” under goffs name ??????
That mole was epic.
He looks more like a hockey player.
If I played QB and the “transfer” asked if I was the punter, I’m transferring my damn self.
lol _)
That's the teammate you want the guy that stood up for his QB and said "I like brock" then the coach said "i like em too" then the team mate of the year goes "you don't like him enough"
Very well done.
Yo 18, sit down nigga
Jared Goff isn't an "All-Pro" quarterback. He's a pro quarterback. He's even a Pro Bowl quarterback. But he's never been voted an All-Pro.
This for real?
Ucf 5:37
You guys gotta do more of these. Love em
Keep doing these! We need an NBA one lmao
They need to do this more
fake
Make more of these!!!!
This is a great Jay Cutler impersonation
#18 need to humble himself...he gonna get a rude awakening if he gets a shot at D1 and gets talked down the way he did to that "transfer"
Bah, not as riveting as I hoped. If this was the "best" prank by a professional some of you have seen, get out more......Just google or tube any numberr of a DOZEN basketball, Soccer and Skateboard pranks. Just this one was short on WTF moments
15 has to be happy his boys had his back
What’s up with those faggy English football helmets lol
WE NEED MORE
I was watching this like a salty STL Rams fan but couldn't help but to laugh when he asked the QB if he was the punter
Epic good job red bull
That #18 is a loud mouth
Lame
Next time do Russell Westbrook plays for the Thunder! That would be so funny!
Best QB in the NFC
If they tried this with dak it wouldn't work cause he would be worse than all the other qbs in the team
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
Ole Brock was sweating ??
#18 goin nowhere lol
All-pro in what league.
I wish they would have did this @ University of Illinois Football.
This was booty
I’m guessing the players just thought it was normal to have cameras watching them play lol
Coah Moose. My old coach
Yooooo DOM went to my high school
Bunch of LOSERS especially that #18 talker
Do this again but with a wide receiver
awesome
Go Rams Baby!! ?
That was good prank . Coach should have been " We found our starter"
Look like sunshine from remember the Titans doe
Do more of this
CAN'T hate on Goff, dude beat my Cowboys...
Now imagine if they brought in a real qb
#18 is straight trash, never gonna make it with that kind of attitude..you can't talk back to your coach, you fool.
Why they wearing rugby helmets
Thanks Jared for taking the time to inspire these young players.
All these players look hella short compared to Goff.
This boi choosing the adult film star tat lmao. “I thought it looked cool”. Yeah sure. Ok goffy boy.
Man that wig makes him look like Jennifer Aniston.
For love of the gane or love of the money ? You decide.
Why does your drink taste like perfume, and why do you charge way too much for not enough liquid or caffeine? ???
They thought they were gonna finally be nice
#18 is a loud mouth, no talent, goof ball. He was just running his mouth because the cameras were around. The amount of college football players that actually make to the show is less than 1%.
That kid a lot of money....yeah NFL don't need another drama queen
hahaha...he asked a guy if he said his name was "Dawg"
When Goff gets introduced Brock: “so am I still the starting QB?...”
How about with joe montana instead. Haha
Brady should do this next ??????
Tell that pizza and nestly crunch face dude to keep his mouth shut. Hes like 110 pounds. Pretty sure hes not "getting dat money" anytime in the NFL.
I need more of this!! Make it happen RB
When he left the receiver hung out in the flat 4:53 I would have been like I think that's Jared Goff
Sick scrumcaps brah
They all seemed disappointed to not actually have him on the team lol
Haha awesome video
Casually sips red bull in the beginning
Is Jay Vanderjagt related to Mike Vanderjagt (former NFL kicker)?????
This seems a bit fake..
I swear... I read "transfer" as "transGENDER". There's something wrong with me.
“What are you the punter?” I know he felt so disrespected ??
Fake or real ?
Wish he was a 49er..
Hahahah hilarious
Go Rams ??
That was a great prank but Goff went to Novato High and they never won state. They went to the game and lost to their SoCal opponent...
Seems like all #18 does is talk about himself.
Number 18 sounds like the smartest person ever....
It would’ve been funny if he asked number 18 if he was the water boy.
Should have had Hulk Hogan instead. Nobody would have known it was him brother
Goff is a Goof
loved seeing Brock's teammate having his back. Threw a little shade lol
wtf ... Ryan gosling
Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
This was funny af. Jared was the perfect fit lol!
The receivers are probably pissed
Jared Goat
Those receivers are straight trash
This D1 AA? All these players are trash!
Damn, Ryan Gosling looks good with long hair
Domann, Pine Creek H.S kid, we see you Colorado
How do you know its jared goff? Just wait for him to complain.
Lols. The best parts were the bombs he dropped.
Should have named him the starter before ending the prank lol
#18 is trash
Very funny! Excited for this years season
why do football players wear scrum caps? It doesn't do anything for head protection
Rams!!!!!!!!!!
That dude talking bout seeing green and gettin money is a fuckin bum. Loud mouth, talking back to the coach, gettin money in D1 ? Typical thug that will fail in life.
Sunshiiiiineee haha
It’s unfortunate that so many black people are delusional and think that they will get rich by being a rapper or an athlete. The odds are better at winning the lottery
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough.
What if he got hurt running up those steps?
Lets see more of these videos!!!
At the end he was like "Surprise! I'm Jared Goff!" and they were still like who???
They suck lol
That was good, a lot better than the Kris Bryant one a few years ago.
That was good!
LOL couldn't find a good QB for this?
Should do Aaron Rodgers and Butte College.
Please keep making more pranks like this. They are awesome!
4:19 "What was y'alls record last year?" "that's why I'm here." Brutal and Perfect
What are they wearing on their heads? Is this rugby?
“What are you the punter ?” Lmaooo
#18 is Antonio Brown no lie LOL
That was awesome!
Wentz is better!!! #FlyEaglesFly
I bet a million dollars that cocky loser never makes a dime playing football.
What was your record last year..........silence LMAO
Stupid video. Could barely see any of the passes or plays because of all the camera angels.
Im so happy for sean mcvay changing his whole career around, kid has a bright future ahead of him.
You get money if you go D1? Lol cool
"That's why I'm here"
#19 is loyal. Gotta give him that.
They're a community college? I like their facilities!
Need more of these!
Cool!!!!
Number 3 came out as the winner out of all of them
Awesome!
Go Rams!
"I'm tryin ta get money". That's all you need to know about the character of that guy.
18 is a tryhard.
HEY GUYS I'm a young filmmaker doing short action based cinematics for fun... if you wanna check out my latest vid it would be appreciated but you don't have to :)
This is so cool!! I go to Ventura College
All that talk by #18 and he didn't make a single highlight!  #3 went off tho!
#MobSquad
Your videos are litterally my inspiration! haha I am so glad I came across your channel!
All aboard the Goff Cart! He's going to be a great one for a long time to come. On the field and off the field. Straight up GOAT.
Excellent...the best prank video I've seen...dude has an arm!
Dude looks like Ryan Gosling lmfao
Squaaadd
He asked if I was the punter hahah
“What are you the punter?” ??????
This is too good!!
Just don’t stop making blueberry and we will be cool. Thanks RB
Hola
Lol
"You don't like Brock enough..." Football is Family.

Hello great video I love redbull videos it's great

Ayy
First comment
oneXD
First
Did they beat the spread?
We beat are biggest rival today ( battle of the highway) 52-6
You're a GENIUS
Cumberland practices sound like sarcastiball
I bet you the Cumberland team could still beat the Jayhawks.
I don't know what this is, what it's about, or if I even care - but I think YouTube is to blame for showing me this.
Cumberland got a football ball team
Whatâ€™s even crazier is that Cumberland beat LSU 41-0, Alabama 44-0, Tulane 28-0, and Vanderbilt 6-0 IN A FIVE DAY SPAN!! Yes 5 total days they played 4 teams. 3 of which are SEC teams and dominated. So yes Alabama and LSU have a losing record again a team that lost 222-0.
Where did u get the foot ball figures from
No no no. the best fact about this is that after threatening Cumberland with the $3000 reimbursement, Heisman offered Cumberland $500 and to pay for the trip to atlanta for the team. Like Heisman was hellbent on proving his point to cumberlands coach and the sportswriters
your intro creeped me out lol
I can't believe all this happened in one game! That was only 55 mins.
Can you make a list of states who had the most college teams to win a championship. Also which states had the most top 25 teams within a season. I believe central Florida, Miami, south Florida,  the Gators and, also Florida state all where in the top 25 this season if I'm not mistaken. So that's 5 teams in 1 season and, state right there. Also most in top 10 they auburn and, Alabama and. Also gatotors and, ucf this year.
I'd pay good money to watch a team of law school frat boys get destroyed by a pro football team
the end reminded me of DHMIS
Show this guys videos to any person who doesnt like sports, and they'll kinda have to like sports...at least a little.
"0:00 ""It's now been 100 years since the worst....""
Me: Alright I got my explanation."
Im surprised this unholy beatdown hasnt been made into a movie.
This has to be fake
Who the hell was that asshole center who snapped the ball directly at Peewee or whoever? Was he actually a good snapper and wanted a laugh? Was Peewee standing in the wrong place?
So what were the 27% of yards they didnâ€™t get
"Alabama fan here

This game is possibly the only thing that could make Nick Saban happy"
This was pretty good.
Imagine going back in time and seeing this game
Why does this game remind me of that episode of family Guy where Peter plays football for the London Sillie Nannies?
13:00 it said they wrapped their arms around each other's shoulders. Not tied their legs together. If all the rest of this is true I would totally believe that too.
What an interesting documentary about Nebraskaâ€™s football team
Not a fan of either team. So no bias. But from the title and intro (paused at 0:51) this will probably be the most enjoyable sports video I've seen or, will ever see. And this is coming from a Lsu, and Saints fan. So I'm pretty much wired to dislike any Georgia team.
If I go back in time Iâ€™m going to this game
This is totally insane. Never knew about this game. Thanks
People talk about running up the score. THAT was running up the score.
15:06 donâ€™t hug me Iâ€™m scared
I thought GT had like 931 rushing yards pr something. Ik they didn't throw a pass. You 400 something amd yet that had over 1100 yards? Where did the other 600 come from?
What a great video
My god this soundtrack sounds like a horror movie
If you had Cumberland and 200 points, you lost!
I was gonna thumbs up this vid until I got to 15 mins and my ear drums got blown up...â€¦.wtf is wrong with u disliked. in the future don't put loud annoying sounds for no reasons.
Good video until the end...my God the sound editing is atrocious
Start at 1:12
Legs tied together? Was that Reggie Ray?
Im 5 hours deep in a shroom trip and then i get to the end of this video... Thanks Jon.
Because we are all equal in todayâ€™s society I think both teams should get half of the total score, so it should have been 111-111
Heisman seems like a bitch made man after this video
As far as I can tell, St. Viator playing against Lane College a week later is the closest anyone got, with St. Viator winning 205-0.
Loved the video man, keep it up!!!
I read a book that had this story in it, it's called the giant book of strange (but true) sports stories
The end of the video about the "climb the ladder" play made no sense. Doesn't tell why his face was so busted. Kinda dumb ending to a good video.
Outstanding story!  Would love to have known the sizes of the players involved
they should bring the cumberland team back just to replay this game
I can't imagine the pain that the toy football players faced in the creation of this video.
Jesus Christ on the cross bc you might as well consider this game a crucifixion
6 1st downsðŸ˜‚ oh my god
Damn I live in Cumberland, RI. I thought my hometown was fucked.
It is sooo distressing at the end, D:
Today marks the 100 year anniversary of this massacre
15:05 to 16:03 was one of the creepiest things I've ever witnessed and then it makes a complete turnaround in mood at 16:05
They couldnâ€™t have an actual quarterback but they have 2 guys who could throw another guy over a fence
"Oh brother, you win you win! That was freakin hilarious!

Great video and true story."
Are you gay and single or curious and unhappy in a relationship? Because I love you for this video.
We want Jon Bois back
I canâ€™t breath Iâ€™m laughing too hard
After 15:00 is insane. Iâ€™m gonna have nightmares
14:53 I cannot stand the music so much that I disliked the video
Iâ€™m horrified this is like saw but a football game
The end just turned into how to basic
"Cumberland College has a football team today and they have won games as an... I dont know D4 team?
Just as a tribute to this game Georgia Tech and Cumberland College should play one game a year just to see if this record can be broken"
does anyone now what the song is in the intro
"222 points with only 6 first downs

nice."
Wow.
If I was the Cumberland head coach losing 140-0 and John Heisman refused to end the game at halftime, I would've just went back to my locker room and told my team to get on the bus. We're leaving. Now.
Lmao I lost it at a dog chasing one of the players
15:10 this sequence is unholy
"@Jon Bois
Did you used old Starting Lineup football figures for your video?
I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I'm a big fan, and am hoping you do more of your 'Pretty Good' series. I really enjoy sports writers that grew up in the same Era as me and watching/reading there opinions on things. Later Jon."
Is that an almond
whats with the annoying music
This needs to be made into a movie.
The University of Alabama has a 0-1 record against Cumberland ;-;
sports writing meets german expressionism.
Go Jackets!
Hey, Iâ€™m dying to know what the last song is. I love it. Anyone know?
What was the last part
Jon bois that book is 300 dollars are you a millionaire???
16:22 wait a second. GT scores 222 points... but doesnâ€™t throw the ball once
SOMEBODY MAKE THIS A FUCKIN MOVIE.
This is gayest historical football fact in history.   Tech fans like to bring it up as if it matters.  They were complete pricks to Cumberland for beating them in baseball earlier that year.  Cumberland disbanded its football program.
This is some of the most creative, well written, and entertaining content on youtube. Thank you for the hard work. This vid is incredible.
It truly was a game of Blood Bowl.
"Why 55 minuets?
Edit: guess I should have watched first lol"
15:38 â€œBAH GAWD! HE KILLED HIM!â€
Football practices are now trending towards the Cumberland model.
Are You dead or something
amazing video quality, keep it up
15:17-15:55 wtf just happened? XD
Just a piece of advice work on special effects audio the final climb the ladder sequence had a painful sound reminiscent of nails on a chalk board and wasn't helped by the fact that you raised the volume to the max
This is like an old school horror movie. It's horrifying but it's hilarious.
That record is proudly held at CC
Itâ€™s funny because any d1 team now could go back in time and beat the ever living shit out of that Georgia tech team
I thought I was looking at a cricket score.
I have now born witness to the wrath that only a true God would reap upon those who sully his realm.
If I had a time machine and could only go back in time 1 time to do anything I would 100% watch this â€œgameâ€
I go to Georgia Tech.  I was on the wrong side of an 84-0 intramural football loss by the GT Wesley Foundation to SHPE.  The halfs are 15 minutes and the only time the clock stops is at halftime.  SHPE scored on over half of all plays (offense and defense).
Football was a joke sport back in the day. No wonder baseball was way more popular.
You could choose to kick or receive after every score? What kind of assy rule is that??
Instant classic
Did the music scare anyone else?
Doesnâ€™t really count considering they didnâ€™t have a team
This one was boring
This video is why I laugh when people bring up great athletes of the early 1900's.  The rules and balance of competition in high end collegiate and pro sports was a joke compared to now.  UConn clowning everyone by 50 in WNCAA basketball is like the status quo for athletics back then.
This music is making me wanna scream
Moral of the story is don't cheat, and dont fuck with John Heisman.
â€œHe grinds your bones for breadâ€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
If every Armenian were to throat-stomp every Turk at this exact moment there wouldn't even be close to enough malice to match what Heisman drew out from this miserable game.
Sports writers are right remember the Phillies had a terrible season in the 18-19 season and then the destroyed the marlins 20-1 and now they have a winning season actually never mind this was posted when they did
I love your videos but can you REGULATE YOUR FUCKING VOLUME PLEASE.   DAMN.  The narration is quiet AF the whole time, then you play the cut music at like 250% volume.    NOT COOL
JON BOIS the legend!!!!
8:48 â€œhis teammate was looking for his glassesâ€ XD ðŸ˜‚
I was there. It was fucking bananas
...grey duck.
This is such a shit sport.
This needs to be a movie. Fucking hilarious.
this is art
opening titles song please??
This was fucking terrifying thanks jon
You're a smart dude, but can't mix audio to save your life!
Iâ€™m legit scared
10:50did he get a steak
if you score three runs off bunting im beaning the next batter because i might be trash but im trash with self respect
My brothers football team beat this one team 50 to nothing in the first half and the team had to forfeit because they didnâ€™t have enough players because they had been injured
3:29 - Top 10 Anime Plot Twists
Heisman was petty AF
Does he purposely use a bad camera when filming himself?
Stop-motion, Jon? You are amazing. I love your creativity. These videos seriously have me wondering what took me so long to find them.
Please tell me there are music credits somewhere. The avant garde during some of your animation segments is incredible and I need more of it in my life.
Soundtrack name at 3:31?
Lol they make students today pay more than cumberland would have had to pay if they didn't arrive at a football game. lmao
Hey Jon, whatâ€™s the song at the end?
Jon. I say this honestly. You are headed for great things.
"Heisman made them play a 30 minute scrimmage after the 222-0 win"
This is like a Jan Svankmajer film.
Notre Dame would booty-blast both these teams
"My two cents:

1. This is why I absolutely refuse to give a thousandth of a rip about any stats or results below the semipro level. When you have future pros and those barely a step above junior varsity competing on the same field, there will always be huge massacres. And they count jack squat toward anyone's ability to do this for a living. You ran for 200 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Southeast Idaho Spudflingers? Big whoop. Do it against the Baltimore Ravens and maybe I'll be impressed.

2. Whatever contributions John Heisman may have made to football, he was absolute garbage as a human being. G.E. Allen pulls a douchenozzle move on him, and his response is to be an even bigger douchenozzle. Not calling him out, not demanding a public apology, not taking the issue public and getting a serious discussion going on chicanery in college sports, he is going to get his petty, pitiful, stupid, meaningless revenge. And he did it by getting men who had NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL to do with the sham baseball game SERIOUSLY INJURED, many almost certainly FOR LIFE, and then making the most token effort to mitigate the carnage long after he'd made his snivelling little point. ""God"" my flabby, blotchy BUTT.

(P.S. To anyone who wants to give me that ""It was completely acceptable at the time!"" line: Save it. If you can't figure out on your own that getting numerous innocent men badly maimed is an automatic ""no"" regardless of what society says, you're scum, period.)"
The story behind this game is so utterly bizarre I can barely believe it actually happened.
"His name...was John Heisman

chorus of death plays"
"If you are talking about massacres, you should mention the biggest flogging in first-class cricket history, when Pakistan Railways defeated Dera Ismail Khan by an innings and 851 runs back in 1964-65. After scoring 912, Railways dismissed Dera Ismail Khan for just 32 and 27 runs respectively in their two innings:

http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/pakistan-railways-register-biggest-win-in-first-class-history-by-beating-dera-ismail-khan-by-innings-and-851-runs-71761"
Georgia Tech are assholes
Jesus! Not even the Browns are that bad! The Browns would have at least scored one touchdown out of that, or at the very least reduce the number of points they were beaten by.
shiver me timbers, bitch
Not Another Teen Movie did it with the Reggie Ray "Concussions To Go" counter. Also little Timmy, who "shouldn't have been on the field in the first place" and got decapitated.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
I'm pretty sure there were no first downs by either team in this game.
Downright Lynchian
Please make more of this series!
The fact that a man ruined his face to block an extra point in the biggest blowout ever is really sad to me
How are you able to take football, a fun game that people like to play and watch, and make it deeply upsetting.
I love how some of the Cumberland players ran away and hid
Wow, what a story! Thank you for posting this.
16:06-17:19 What is that song?
I wish I could have seen the play that he described starting at 6:14
Nah this shit is scary as fuck man
Iâ€™m scared
these lawyers..well..all lawyers deserved it...but how cruel was Heisman making his team scrimmage after the game...wtf..was he a SEAL?
This is simply the best video in the history of Youtube!
My god it's been a year and a half since this came out
This was the funniest football story ever.
@Jon Bois Tell me you smoke weed every day, because I smoked before and while watching this video and it was PERFECT.
This video gave me nightmares.
It's not that I want to know where this music came from; I just want to know why someone would write something this offputting
This is sad.
Ehh if they lied about tapeing 2 players together, then they could of lied about most of what actually happened during game..a player jumping over fence to hide from other team, but 2 people were already hiding there, so they throw him back on the field so they dont give up their hiding spot?
Even the one good Cumberland play, the blocked kick, ended up working out terribly for the blocker.
"This was an actual nightmare.

but at least the ball was an almond :P"
"This should be a movie.

A horror movie."
"NOTE: Because Georgia Tech never passed, and Cumberland actually completed one pass play for a gain, this means that, despite losing 222-0...

... Cumberland had more passing yards than Georgia Tech in this game. Yes, that's an actual, legitimate statistical victory for Cumberland in this 222-0 game."
They angered a God ðŸ˜‚
"All of this because some dude over at Cumberland had to be a dick and thought embarrassing another team would be a good thing....


Talk about karma"
Wonder what the score would have been if they played the last 5 minutes
A TEN YARD PUNT??? The fuck...?
As a soccer announcer would say: "Not much football being played today"... lol
After this vid Iâ€™m genuinely terrified of our lord and savior John Heisman.
It is still a rule in HS that the team who was scored upon can choose to kick or receive.  A coach took the option to kick one time after he was scored upon since he was winning by so much.
Anyone know the song at 16:30?
You and captain disillusion are the two most deserving of a robust patreon. I hope youâ€™re still at it. Iâ€™ve been binging you for about a week now. I very much look forward to whatever you do next. #NextLevel
oh my god I'm drunk watching this and now I'm terrified of Heisman's face
Pretty guud
Not really equivalent, what happened between the baseball team and what happened to the football team. The baseball players for Georgia Tech may have been less capable than the players ringed in for Cumberland, but at least they had some experience. Cumberland's football team wasn't even that. It was a bunch of random law students. It isn't that impressive that they scored 222 points against what was effectively thin air.
i find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that someone got knocked out by a football hike to the head
I have a newfound hatred for Heisman now. Thanks Jon.
Go dawgs
Why isnâ€™t this a movie yet, I am dying over here!ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
This may be the saddest thing I've ever seen
Song at 5:01?
Wtf happened to Edwards? Did he suffer from a skull fracture?
That's not difficult all you need to do is put the game on rookie and play against the browns. You could get some crazy scores. Don't forget to have the 15 min quarters.
I like how the football is an almond
"His teammate was looking for his glasses" i cant not laugh. XD
My God, I love the fact that this has a soundtrack like There Will Be Blood -- what a perfect parallel; the time period, the setting, the grind-your-teeth determination to become a man-god... Heisman needs to be played by DDL, I'm now convinced it'd be his magnum opus simply based on that photo of Heisman
as a Georgia tech fan this is actually pretty good
"That was pretty 
                       good"
2:05 Award a blue ribbon to a supernova?, how can it receive it its too big, unless we have a "grow ray" to make the ribbon about the size of the milky way galaxy.
I fucking love you Jon
Can someone please  tell me if this type of music in the intro is a certain type of jazz or it It just someoneâ€™s jazz in general
Love how an almond was the football
11:48 I only just now realized that you were making this in an office while other people were also working
Speaking of the architects of football, the penalty flag was invented by the first head coach of my university's football team :D
The football is nut
"Legit channel...
Subscriber"
Fantastic storytelling!
What's the music for this video?
Hey jon, Iâ€™m not sure if you already answered this, but what music did you use?
And then Georgia Tech lost their winning streak to the Muddogs all because of The Waterboy.
Just found this channel. Been binging all morning! #snowday
Just finished the dumbest boy one  and now onto this one. Its now 11:13
This sounds like a cartoon. Looney tunes football would have similar events
The almond is the best
The biggest blowout I was ever a part of was 103-0 the first quarter we scored 45 points with our first team, the second quarter the coach put the second string in and they scored 36 (with 3 defensive touchdowns), third quarter was our jv team and they scored twice. And the freshman team, who didn't even dress for the start of the game but at halftime the varsity team changed into street clothes and the freshman put on pads, got a touchdown, but they did block the 2 point conversion

Jesus Christ
Is anyone else horrified with this story or is that just me
that took a real dark turn lmao
Are you okay?
The option of receiving or kicking after scoring a touchdown was an old rugby rule....
It's a good thing that the game was shortened by 5 minutes. else the result could have gotten embarrassing for Cumberland
What's with all the crazy sport stories out of early century Atlanta?
Dude!!! Great soundtrack!
This is a lot scarier than it should be
IIRC, in the John S. Bowman-Joel Zoss recap of this game for their Football Hall of Shame series, some writer actually asked Morris Gouger after the game if the outcome would have been different if that kickoff returner hadn't have tripped over his own player. "Yeah, it would've been different. It would've been 222-7." Great recap, Jon (P.T. Anderson envies you this depiction!)
According to one source I read, the third quarter was cut to ten minutes and the fourth quarter to seven-and-a-half minutes.
Holy shit work on your audio game
Good vid
RIP Edwards, the man was absolutely obliterated
those law students probably had PTSD
I don't think Monty Python could even come up with so many odd and ridiculous things to happen
I love your videos, but 10:35 never happened. Thatâ€™s completely impossible.
Thereâ€™s no way that 10:35 happened in real life. Thatâ€™s impossible. Use your head, Jon.
ðŸ˜‚
Love the video, and I get you're trying to convey the grim tone of the game, but, by God, the music and sound balance are ATROCIOUS.
Iâ€™ll be honest I have watched all of the chart parties and pretty good videos at least 3 or 4 times... these videos are so good... hopefully another one comes out soon
first foward pass was 1895 UNC vs georgia 70 yard score.. not notre dame like a "movie".. john heisman gives credit to the unc play but it happened 20 years before the next pass in major college football would be attempted .. some small college attempted a pass i think in 1906.
Christ almighty, whata score
Wow
I live near Cumberland so this kind off saddens me
"I'm a wramblin' wreck from Georgia Tech AND I SHOW NO MERCY!"
How does this keep turning into surreal horror!
You should make a video on Utah Utes football team, how theyâ€™ve performed vs their recruits and how far theyâ€™ve had to grind
GT still didn't beat the spread. Maybe next time.
This is the greatest analytical American football video in the history of YouTube. No question, no answers. Full stop.
Stop making your videos scary
That was a mammoth beat-down
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is scary
"I donâ€™t know why but this creeps me out because it was way back then and shudder
Itâ€™s creepy"
Why did they keep trying? Why would you sacrifice your own face on something as desperate as a ladder play when the score is 221-0?
its ok i guess
Why doesn't he post
My god... its full of sÌ¶tÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶sÌ¶ scores.
Is that an old Van Houtte coffee cup?
Frau HEISMAN <thunder crashes>
11:17
fun fact this video was uploaded on my 21st birthday? does this mean i was born on the 79th anniversary of this game?
You can actually STILL choose to kick the ball off after being scored on lol
What in the name of fuck was that minute near the end
15:10 so did he break his nose by jumping to high and crashing into a UFO ? the fuck is happening here, is this the strychnine kickin in ?
Actually the reason why the 1940 Chicago Bears won in such dominating fashion was because their head coach invented the T-formation that everyone uses now in that game. Before the game started the Washington Redskins were actually the favorites to win that game.
John Heismann was clearly a monomaniacal dick. The Cumberland players should've simply laid down for every play. The Tech players might've shown them more mercy. Still, that's what Cumberland gets for cheating at baseball.
This is ridiculous that this really happened lol
His name was John Heisman.......cue dramatic horror music
"I like how you say GT players got bored....
They didn't have any remorse literally tearing those guys to pieces? I mean damn. QB got 3 concussions?! 
Thank god I didn't grow up in the good ol days...."
This video is one of the greatest works of art ever created by man
They should make this story into a movie
The ONE TEAM worse than even The Cleveland Browns.
It's like the end of WW2 on the eastern front
Jon, make one about the ball that bounced over a pebble TWICE in the same game, giving the 1924 Washington Senators the city's only-ever World Series title!
So many things went wrong I wish I could have seen that
HOBBES?!?!?!
make a new video please
Receiving the kick after scoring iscthe norm in Rugby, but not in sevens,
That music from 16:05 to 17:18 is simply the best.
And they still canâ€™t beat Bama
Shout out to Marigoata.
You need to really equalize your volume. What the fuck was that shit, no one wants to be constantly adjusting their volume
Jesus a damn headphones warning would have been nice. But besides that awesome video.
I always wondered how this happened awesome video
Wut
after watching that I'm hoping that there was some big time karma for Heisman.
15:00 is where you lost me.  It was excessive, and unnecessary. We're on youtube watching about football, not a cryptic murder mystery.
Wtf happened to his face
The football is an almond lol
This channel is kinda creepy but I like it
Wait wait wait, is George E Allen related to George Herbert Allen, the Hall of Fame Rams coach? Huh.
Anyone else watch this at 4 AM on the toilet before going to sleep?
...that is one hell of a grudge..
How is 222 to 0 even possible... I mean seriously. Just by myself 1 person if I do nothing but let them walk over at a brisk pace for a touchdown with 0 resistance, and then take a knee every single time to burn the clock they still would not get 222 points in 4 quarters...
Heisman seems like a fun guy
I've watched this video a couple of times and literally just realized that in the stop-motion intro with the green figurines, you were using an almond as the football...
they should make a movie of this game
He will grind your bones to make his bread... I love this series
"I don't even like football
Damn that was a good vid"
Prettyyyyy Pretttty Good....
This guy managed to execute a trippy dream sequence with toy figurines. Nice.
What is the name of the book?
Trying to sit through this hipsters narration caused more pain than any of those cumberland players could have endured that day.
Do you have it written in the language of your contract that you get to include at least one ear rape per video?
stolen video
I bet the Cumberland team could still beat the browns
The part about the climb the ladder play was kinda horrifying. What the hell happened?
Sounds like bullshit. I mean I donâ€™t doubt that they lost so bad but really the story sound s fake as shit lol.
Pee wees could play better than this
DAMN  I HAD THEM BY 269ðŸ™„
Heisman Sounds like a dick...
"15:04
Did that scare anybody else? lol"
This is a great video great presentation on this game with some comedy thrown in I love it
"The obscure jazz music is AMAZING. Itâ€™s ironic use is comedy gold. This stuff could be studied in film school. Iâ€™m serious and i love it.

Iâ€™m probably late to figure this out but Jon Bois is a genius."
"Reading about this game.  Some stuff is exaggerated here.  Like Preas catching his own kickoff for a TD.  The Cumberland player he kicked off to actually returned the kick for 10 yards..... but then in Cumberland fashion, fumbled (one of NINE fumbles Cumberland lost this game).  Preas just recovered the fumble and ran it in 10 yards for the TD.  I'd hardly call that ""catching/returning"" his own kick for a TD.  

Also, I'm reading Heisman agreed to shorten the quarters in the 2nd half to 12 minutes a piece.... not the usual 15.  That would be him agreeing to shorten the game by 6 minutes, not 5 like you keep saying.  Yeah I'm being nit picky here, but I'm a stickler for accuracy.  

Finally..... to call this a true feat is a bit misleading if not BS.  The Cumberland team disbanded its football team prior to the season but due to an agreement had to play GT otherwise they'd have to pay GT $3,000 due to lost gate receipts for GT.  So Cumberland grabbed 12-14 dudes from a fraternity to play against GT who at the time was the best team in college football.  It would be like Alabama today playing against a bunch of random students from another school.  Sports in their infancy stages in the early 1900s were a joke compared to what we see today.  That goes for every sport..... at both the amateur and professional level."
15:04 I bet you have beautiful nightmares
Your video is awesome! What a crazy story, first I'd ever heard of it, insanely interesting.
"I'm gonna destroy your football team" but Mr Heisman, we don't have a football team "well then get one so I can pummel it" but "I'll financially cripple you if you don't" yes sir sorry sir
Cumberland University is actually my hometown's school. It's as shitty as that score
After all the silly crap in this â€œgameâ€ why wouldnâ€™t you believe they tied two players together as one lol
This should be a movie.
Law students shouldâ€™ve sued
Terrible narration.Â  Uninteresting.Â  Goofy accounts of 21 men falling down or overrunning the play & the ball carrier trips overÂ a teammate whose looking for his glasses?Â  Just stop it, already!Â  A complete waste of time.
My dad was offered to play at Cumberland when he went 2 college their because they where desperate 4 players and my dad had never played football before but he played soccer but he turned them down
13:00 omg im dying. That's too funny.
If you team give up 222 points, you don't even need to be playing football. Throw the whole football program away. ðŸš®
one time in 7th grade or football tea held a team to -26 yards
gt were 221 point favorites
If you have Apple turn on classic invert at 1:00
i wish this would have been on film
Why do they float up into the ceiling
Poor Edward...
He trips over team mate
How long did it take to make this?
Lol I went to Cumberland my freshman year.
What do you use to create and edit the animations in these?
I really wish there were cameras to video this game
how is this even possible??
4:07 did you see September 30 They beat Mercer 61 to nothing. Pretty high, but nothing compared to their next game...
Why was the football an almond?
Who knew John Heisan could be so scary
this is so god damn beautiful
How is it even possible to be this bad
they should totally be a movie
i laughed so hard at this
Not gonna lie, that music at the end scares the shit out of me
This kinda reminds of the London silly nanies vs the patriots in family guy
32 touchdowns, 6 first downs, 0 passes lmao
This is horror
Heisman is the moron who invented the forward pass? Screw that guy for ruining football!
It's Duck Duck Greyduck not Duck Duck Goose.
JESUS FUCKING CRIST! THATS SOOO DAM BAD IT MAKES THE BROWNS A SUPER BOWL CONTENDER!
maybe they gave you the choice of kicking or receiving if the offense is extremely tired and you know that the defense could stop them. Still an odd rule though.
Where do you work to be able to do this?
It's an almond
Heisman... that photo screams respect me or be smithen. He's been dead a long time but if he were alive and gave me that look in the photo.. shivers
Still better than the Browns.
I believe the reason you would have an option to kick or receive at this time is that there was no rule that the ball must travel 10 yards to be recovered by the kicking team. It wasn't until the early 1920s that the NFL established that rule. So I imagine a team would opt to kick gambling that they could recover the ball in better field position, knowing that if they choose to receive anyway the other team has the choice of attempting to pin them deep, or gamble on field position and attempt to recover the kick themselves
Really nice video, good job
I would've liked to watch the game
Why all the obnoxious sound effects at 15 minutes?
This is the worst editor of videos ever
Is this a football game or a horror movie
Watching this while watching the patriots game
15:35 did the world end
This must have been weird to referee
I never knew a football game could be so weird and creepy
Was edwords the one the only SCOTTTT STEARLLLLING
31 touchdowns and six first downs.
I don't understand the graphic at 10:15.  What does "yards left on field" mean?
Dude you need to manage your audio levels better, sound effect were waaayyyyyy too loud.  Had to turn volume down then your mic was so low I couldnâ€™t hear so had to turn it back up
worst d3 team vs alabama and the record would be broken
It was a farce.
This is a good scoreigami
I wish there was a vid of this game
Well Cumberland did have more passing yards?
Stop the sounds
Why the creepy ass music
I was crying for most of the video
The Musique Concrete at 14:53 gave me an anxiety attack.
Dude that music at the end like 10 times louder than everything else
Nice video but the sound difference between music and talk is far to big I love to keep my ears in one piece
The lesson is: Never Anger A Football God
I'd like a full reenactment with real actors of this game :D
this has me in fucking stitches
"I could see it in future if rules were changed a bit. 
CUMBERLAND 2







BROWNS 0"
tomorrow is 111 years! Half the score
i know this video is over a year old, but who the hell thought putting that annoying ass music in this video and then said "lets make that shitty music 4Ã— louder than everything else in the video"? this video wasnt made so far back that there was no equalizers. one rewatching of ur own video could have made this an excellent video, but no u just edited it and said "fuck it, everything is fine". went from a like and a favorite from me for the good content, to just me leaving this shitty comment about how u can edit correctly.
The moral of the story: do NOT piss off John Heisman.
g
John Heisman be like "Bill Belichick? Never heard of her".
11:51 imagine ur just going about your business at SB studios and Jon Bois has set up a huge mini football field in his cubicle.
I disagree with this being the worst beatdown ever. They won 222-0 in football, there was a 108-3 beatdown in baseball once. I think that's even more extreme, considering the modern equivalent is 30-3 for baseball and for football it's 73-0. The Cincinnati Red Stockings won 108-3 against the Union Club of Urbana on May 25, 1870.
AKINATOR!!!! FOR THE LAST TIME, IM NOT LOOKING FOR SECRETARIAT IM LOOKING FOR A MONITER!!!!!
How about a Pretty Good episode about Centralia PA.
That was on old picture of GT stadium with the old ACC logo
this is depressing.
The music is so creepy.
What programs do you use to make your videos? They're super well-made!
That's what you call a schlacking!!!!!! It's so unbelievable you have to say it like Sean Connery!!!!! lol
The kick off caught for td doesn't seem possible, either he ran 80 yards in 3 seconds, or he kicked the ball 300 meters high. So some of the recounting of this must be inaccurate. I mean after 100 points would the official scorer even care anymore.
Lol they kinda deserved it tbh. It was such a shitty thing to do in the first place so it figures he'd want his revenge.
It would have been 222 - 7 if the teammate wasn't there
This was one weird game
That's fucked up
Somewhere I read that the 2nd half of this game was shortened to 17:30.
I would have loved to watch this game tbh. It sounds so damn entertainingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
So this is why Georgia college football iswhat it is now, karma
Can we get rid of the hardware store music
Of all the weird crap that happened in the game why don't you believe two injured players weren't tied together and sent in? Are their other weird accounts you don't think actually happened?
I bet the lawyers could beat the Browns
Hey, 35 yards is a pretty good punt for Cumberland
0:00
Is this real
Absolutely brilliant using a steam engine losing traction at 1:52 as an audio metaphor for the football game being a ridiculous blowout.
"My question is
Why r they playing football while every other male (old enough) where fighting in WW1. Weren't they drafted. And an entire male generation and almost 2 was lost in the war. 
I salute those true men (rest in peace to all men that died in the war and in WW2)"
This isn't impressive
Go Dawgs
lol I live in Lebanon and I go to Cumberland all the time also my mom went to Cumberland
Wtf I was unsubbed from jon for no reason
Nice profile picture.
This turned into a how to basic video
imagine if they made a movie about this game?
Fishy woods is the fucking goat
Speak up ur way to quiet
i like the horror music ðŸ‘
Is Cumberland College still a school? Do they still have a football team?
I wish there was footage of this gameðŸ˜‚ðŸ’¯
Imagine getting your face fucked up like that in a game as pointless as this one... it makes my soul cringe
This video made me hate Georgia Tech
Yeah this video is a fake. Not a single clip of the game. You are pathetic and it's no wonder you are such a loser. I'd kill myself if I had to be you.
Thanks for the constant ear rape
I would love to see this game todau
What the fuck was 3:31
Lmao wtf. I would just walk off after the first play save urself from injuries , embarrassment , etc
first video of yours i've seen, absolutely love it, great editting and i love the little details you put in like the stop motion
How come CUMberland couldn't score 444 points??
Dang I had Cumberland as my fantasy defense
Jesus the LSD trip at 15:08 is fking insane.
He runs and hides behind a fence, and two players also hiding being the fence throw him back over the fence.
Love the context but I can barely hear you. Turned up as loud as I can I can hear everything else but the voice.
Disliked because that music was so fucking loud, fuck you
This one game is not a football game, this is a genocide emerged from leather and fear. They could have at least tried to comeback with 1/4 of what they had.
Uploaded under brutal to porn hub
F O O T B A L L
This is art
"They only got six first downs from scoring 222 points.
Six.  
ROFL"
how about a decent mix on one of these videos?
That was the most annoying minute (15:00 to 16:00). Most annoyingly frustrating noises ever.
I dont know how i got here. I don't even know much of American Football. But this videos is glorious. It's like a fever nightmare that combines one of the wierdest statistical sport event in history with the aesthetics of a Kubrick movie. I love this.
Hey it's not Cumberland College it's Cumberland University
What does it mean by yards left on the field ?
How can they associate prestige with this assholes name?!?!
Falcons could still figure out way to lose
Just a reminder that the figures seen in the video are playing with an almond
Who else is here from FivePoints Vids?
I had no idea my Madden game needed a step up.
You make fucking great videos
I remember telling my friends older brother about this game and they laughed at me for a solid hour. Â This was years before the internet so I couldn't prove it.
Back then rankings were by how many points you scored. There is a great book "You Dropped It You Pick It Up" about the game.
I am born and raised Lebanese living in Lebanon TN most my life. Cumberland is my hometown college. This lost and home to Cracker Barrel is our claim to fame. The UT Volunteers avenged us last Saturday.
Can I have that almond
my schools god damn junior team could do better
These videos are awesome
Wild dogs still exist in Detroit
The whole "kicker catches their own kick-off for a touchdown" has happened several times in the Arena League because of the nets behind each endzone
Whoa.
15:12 How did Wood manage to fly into the sun?
after hearing the two players tied together part it sorta wrecked it for me. made the whole story sound bullshit.
6:53 I just finished the video, and I'm still laughing about this play ðŸ˜‚
If you had Cumberland with 200 points, YOU LOST!
I got a pretty good story you can do. It's about a highschool basketball team that played a majority of a game 2 vs 5 and even went to 1 vs 5 and still managed to win. I don't remember the specifics of the story but it was really interesting. I think it would make a pretty good story. I heard it on a NPR segment
Man cumberland almost won it was tight!
"""sometimes a weak expression of pity is the deepest act of cruelty""

I kinda want to get that as a tattoo..."
Score machine ðŸ…±ï¸roke
I feel like he made this so he can play with his toys
Can someone PLEASE tell me what song is playing at 00:34 or who the artist that is playing the saxophone is? Please? It is gorgeous!
Was this supposed to be a horror movie
15:02 this is where shit becomes "oh hell no"
Can someone please explain to me what happened to woods face on the last play
Jesus chill with the scary music its 3am
Wish there was footage on this game
A sound warning please? That ending almost made me deaf
Anyone else here from procrastinators?
You should start uploading these again I love these
When the 2016 Cowboys offense faces the 2013 Cowboys defense
stumbles at knees finally I have found the heaven of good content
This was just really sad... and horrifying at times.
Actually Tom Landry invented the shotgun snap
They threw him over the fence
It can happen but a Division 1 FBS has to play a D2-NAIA
7:22â€“7:32 I don't know about college or NFL, but kicking off after you got scored on is still a rule in the NFHS (High School) rule book.
2:25 thus began the lob pass
What an absolutely phenomenal video.
This scared ne a bit
When c'mon man goes too far
What happened to his face
Oh my ears what a sound
In madden once I did that but controlled both teams the losers would endlessly do safety's and winners would throw Hail Marys vs kick block plays (Max points=256) but I counted points to 300
What exactly happened on the climb the ladder play?
3:31 JOHN CENA
Gosh men are stupid
The Ball was a walnut LMFAO
that "ladder play" was hysterical ðŸ˜‚
I know literally nothing about american football, but it doesn't matter because this was hilarious
I'm not a football fan, and watching this video has left me traumatised.
Hopefully no one bet on Cumberland to win this game
osu scored 128 in a game
The one where they sit in a circle -- is that game 4397? What year did it start, 12469?
oh my god!!!!! i lost it when it was 77-0 and they had a chance to score on the kickoff with no opponent near him. but then he runs over his teammate and is down. the player was looking for his glasses!!!! I WAS LEGIT CRYING IN TEARS !!!!!!!!
The music is retarted
Hey, Jon when is season 3 coming my man, i love your show even though you're a chiefs fan
ur videos r cool man
"it was great until the 15 minute mark. 
then you went all ""art project"" and ruined it."
"""WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW??!!""
â€“John Heisman, that day, probably"
I know the coaches there
I live in Lebanon
Anyone else get a creepy vibe from this vid?
EmpLemon Shouted you out bro! He also shouted out Urinatingtree
Damn Hiesman invented the forward pass and didn't even pass the ball once.
if I ever get a time machine I have to see this
Can I get a roast beef hoagie on wheat?
This is just cruel.
This is the most absolutely horrifying thing I have ever witnessed in relation to professional sports. The sheer number of circumstances that existed to make this happen is nothing short of absolutely insane. I love it so damn much. You do not fuck with John Heisman. He will extract vengeance on you and your entire school and their sanity and their very souls. Attempting to use human language to sum up this event is an insult to it's magnificence. You're better off making an assortment of horrifying mouth noises to describe it.
anyone from emplemon
15:09 Special guest appearance by HowToBasic
This is pretty good
3:34 WHO BROKE THE VIOLIN!
Is this real?
The music at 15:20 reminds me of when SpongeBob goes to the future
Holy shit Jon keep doing what you're doing.
Omg 222-0 I almost fainted
"I'm pretty sure the ""elect to kickoff after the opponent scored"" rule is a vestige from rugby. In Rugby union, the scoring team always receives after a score. This is because field position can be more important than possession. In rugby the ball is turned over way more: A fumble if the ball goes forward is a turnover regardless of who recovers it; running out of bounds is a turnover; a forward pass is a turnover; and play doesn't stop at a tackle, so the ball can be ""poached"" by the defense at any time. 

This means that the scoring team receiving the ball deep in their own end of the field is a gain for the team that was just scored on.

100 years ago, American football was still working this all out. Fumbles were more common, and the ball moved much more slowly than today. So if your team got scored on, it might be a good strategy to elect to kickoff again in hopes of making the opposing team punt from deep in their own territory."
"i've never heard sound work that made me say 'that guy should make a full-length film'
you should make a film. i'm guessing you have. you've certainly wanted to. link it. do it. link it.
i'm also a guy you've probably heard of, so you should do what i say."
your intros are pretty good, m8
My grandad went to Cumberland ðŸ˜‚
I'm watching with 222k views
Hey, I love your stuff. You are a terrific storyteller and narrator.  Please though work on the audio. I am specifically referring to the section where you had the agonizing music playing to symbolize the agony that the game was, but the levels for the music made it unpleasant to watch. On some level, that choice makes complete sense since it is supposed to make it hard to watch for the viewer, but it comes out of nowhere which hurts the listener and makes them want to turn the video or audio off. I still love your variety of story telling using facts and narrative in a cooperative manner.
this video was a work of beauty
So they scored 222 points w/o a forward pass? Lololol
Hey! That's pretty good.
I just witnessed a massacre. A stop-motion, plastic man massacre.
15:10 - 16:00 looks like a how to basic video
Hey Jon, I don't know if you still read the comments on this one, but if you do, I have a story. I first saw this video in December, maybe January. Just a few weeks later, my grandpa was dying in the hospital, and my mom was pretty absent from my life for a little bit, spending basically every spare moment with him. I was putting off going to visit him, because I was scared. When I finally did go, I told him this story. It was the last conversation we ever had. Thank you for making this video. Thank you for giving me one last great memory with the man who passed his love of sports, storytelling and oddity on to me.
Vishe woods part made me die of laughter I'm cryingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I believe this is what you would call a Scorigami.
GT didn't even pass
great videos but your musics are far too loud compared to your voice
Probably what would happen if I tried to play football
"Pretty good.

A series made up of videos that are pretty good."
where can we buy this book
the time the Cumberland player just layed down with his "dead" teammates at the ten was oddly depressing to me
did anyone else notice that he used an almond for the ball
when you set madden to rookie
Rookie mode on Madden.
this is the fakes thing ever lmao
what is it with the ear rape
This was lit
yes, well done!!!
My god imagine the Georgia tech defense fantasy points
Do a pretty good for the Michigan v Appalachian State game
Please make more of these
i cant imagine any organized sporting event at any level where the players choose to lay down on the field instead of play the game. like i don't think 6 year olds would do that
Wow that game really went down to the wire I thought Cumberland had it at the end there
This needs to be a fucking movie
"A lot of people try to give advice on how and why you should change.
Keep doing exactly what you're doing"
Just guessing, I'm pretty sure kicking after being scored one was a rule for 2 reasons. 1, a holdover fro Rugby. and 2nd, because offense was far less prevalent at the time, it could be advantageous in the field-position game if you were confident enough in your defense.
No. Way. This is impossible literally!
Is there any footage to this game
Still a better love story than Twilight
Literally you couldn't make this stuff up ðŸ˜‚
This is amazing content. Needs to be recognized! Keep up the good work man!
I've watched this video like 6 times in a row because it's so entertaining!
The Cleveland legend heisman
His name was.... Robert Paulson.
The music at the end was horrific
Guess what?!?  I live in the city with the worst beat down in history!! Lebanon TN!! lol I live 5 minutes away!
this was kind of creepy
This was sickening.
They punted on third-and-one!?!?!?
How the fuck did he catch his own kick. That sounds impossible
On the team bus or train back to Cumberland, it could not have been pleasant for the 2 guys who spent most of the game hiding in the bushes.
Well, if you put a D1 college football team against a group of law students who have never played football in today's time, the result would be pretty similar.
somebody make this into a movie!!!!
This is by far one of the most entertaining sports "documentaries" I've ever seen. The Heisman pictures had me in tears!
lol it's shocking this really happened . Amazing fucking video my friend. The time put into it is noticed and appreciated. New Sub
15:25 turn your volume way down
The amount of shit that happened in that game is just stupid. A kicker caught his own kick
Make more videos?  Please?
I am a Georgia Tech graduate and even I feel sorry for Cumberland College after knowing the full story thanks to you.
Vichy Woods is SCOTT STERLING!!!!
I used to play with those football figured
this dude needs more subs
I wish there was a video of this. It sounds ridiculous ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
All of these rules changes and shit would never have happened either.
This shit was sooo funny ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Anyone know the song at 16:33?
You should do a pretty good on the 1908 National League Pennant Race.
15:28 earrape
Man your channel is probably if not the best the best sports channel on YouTube
In my opinion this is the biggest L in history
200th comment
I remember this game,  feels like it was just yesterday
and people only talk about how "no one will ever beat wilt chamberlain's 100 point game" um that seem more possible compared to this, even if they tried to on purpose just to make history it would still not be possible to do this
Holy shit this game is like a collection of amazing short stories tolled into one game
Does anybody know if or when he'll do more of these?
Great vid. Inspired by 2001? lol
"JUST LET THEM DIE JOHN
PLEASE"
Nice video
This scared me
When your team sucks in call of duty.
13:10 LOL
"Grown men" they were college kids btw. Not grown men.
Um, wasn't Cumberland opting to kick rather than receive after scoring the sensible thing? They clearly weren't going to advance the football far, so they get better field position by kicking off rather than punting (or fumbling) from scrimmage.
lol
These stories are always fascinating because they are so at odds with the way we usually idealize the past.  We tend to think modern sportsmanship among many other things has gotten a lot worse over the years.
Great job! Very entertaining and surprisingly informational.
Did anybody realise that they misspelled Tulane on the program at 6:06?  They spelled it Tulan; not Tulane.
15:00-16:00 I was so close to just jumping out my window. Holy shit.
"15:00 - 16:00 was honestly hard to watch and the audio was badddd

great vid otherwise"
first good laugh in a long time
I love how they use an almond as a football
this wasn't a video... it was a work of art... good job...
did How To Basic take over at the end?
As crazy as it seems, I don't think it's necessarily completely unbreakable. Some insane shit happens between those Division III schools. Hell, half of them barely take some sports programs seriously, like the Caltech Mens' Basketball team who lost like 3 hundreds of games in a row for like a decade before finally snapping the longest losing streak I've ever seen in any organized sport.
There gave been literal WARS with less malice.
it's sad your in such a fancy looking recording booth, but the volume of this video is so low.
THE FEELINNG WHEN YOUR A RAMBLING WRECK FROM GEORGIA TECH, BUT A HELL OF AN ENGINEER!!! God I wish we were still this dominant XD
Worst ass whooping ever
I actually live in the town where Cumberland University is. I can check to see if they have any records of this.
Do you have a list of the music played in the background? It was a very beautiful soundscape and I'd like to look more into it!
Disclaimer: Don't watch while high
I wish we had video of it
that violin music toward the end was overbearing and went on for way too long. However, I like this channel and this video!
This was terrifying
Hey, that's pretty good
This took a dark turn at the end
Heeeey that's pretty goood
imagine how much the band had to play the fight song lol
I've never laughed so hard in my life lol
what happened to his face
gods way of karma in sports
Put a seizure warning here dear God
Wow great video dude ! I really enjoyed these lovely practical effects.
sounds like most of that book is fiction
What happened to his face
I really shouldn't have watched this before going to bed...
I respect you for the amount of time you put into this masterpiece. Thank you!
why do i find this creepy
What was that montage starting at 15:11
This video gave me nightmares
this video is lowkey super creepy
when you have 0 pass yards ans win by 222
one time Vanderbilt scored 340
Georgia Tech was playing chess while Cumberland was playing candyland
CALVIN AND HOBES!!!!!
Lol at least Cumberland can boast more passing yards
John Madden: The only reason Georgia Tech won is because they scored more points.....lots of it
"This should be a scenario in NCAA 17. 
(Is there an NCAA 17? I don't have a console. Maybe that's why everyone is saying ""Madden"" despite these not being fucking NFL teams!)"
down vote just for the obnoxious music at 15 mins insane and no need for it
This is the most fantastic video I have ever watched
Man... Heisman is a straight up savage
so did vichy woods receive permanent facial injuries, or was that just temporary swelling?
I think most of us would be in the same position those Cumberland "players" were tbh...
Yeah! I'm a gt fan!
I had Cumberland +221 in this one...bad luck.
A part of the story that I don't think is true is the guy catching his own kickoff. Not even the fastest player of today could run 70 yards downfield while a kicked ball remained in the air.
This is hilarious! Totally cheered my son up after WMU lost earlier! Thank you! <3
you know practice had to suck that next day
11:53 who's that in the back??! ðŸ˜±
As a tech player this makes me smile
why wouldnt they just kneel it and run the clock lol
I've never been interested in sports, but the particular subject matter that you cover and the way you tell (and reenact) the stories you choose to tell are immensely entertaining and informative.  I feel like this video did an excellent job of, in a matter of just under 35 seconds, imposing how important Heisman was to modern-day football to someone who has never actually watched a full game of the sport in his life.
I want to see the box score so I can see the fantasy scores! This is crazy!!!
This story is amazing! love it man! I laughed so damn hard lol
are the things you said at 0:05 real things that happened?? or did you make them up?
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME !!!  Well done.
omg lol this is crazy!!
I wish all historical sports blowout analysis devolved into a Lynchian nightmare.
I wish you or someone though would do something on that time the Washington Generals won cause I've always been curious about it
your show is the best show about sports
as always, amazing video
This took a real "Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared" turn at the end
8:35 HOW CAN YOU BE THAT BAD?????
pretty good Jon
So something like 7-1 when translated to football/soccer?
Damm now I want almonds.
There are about 5 things I don't believe a word of.
I mean I can't let no one score that much while I'm on the field I would have to fight someone before that happens
They fucked with Heisman!?!?!  That's like angering Lombardi, what the fuck XD.  They angered a God.
and i thought i was being mean for wanting washington to put up 80 on oregon
Finally you're getting the views you deserve
Damn, that was like in Jackass 3(?) when Preston took a kicked ball to the face.
It's poetry that on the day after you uploaded this, Michigan annihilated Rutgers 78-0.
"Jon, wheres breaking madden?


And also, this is a true work of art. I've been looking for an accurate account of this game for months, so i ordered Heismans First Trophy: The Game That Launched Football in the South by Sam Hatcher. Maybe you should give it a look at."
You're pretty good.
What is the intro song?
gg no re
That isn't a beating, that's a war crime.
As someone with little interest in football, I think this video's great. The animation, editing, narration and use of music are on point, great job man/
Belichek would be proud
I died
This feels like a real life version Breaking Madden.
Is that Stockhausen at the end there?
I love your videos but please work on your sound balancing.
Heisman and Tywin Lannister would have gotten along well.
Step up your webcam game. You got a good mic.
unsubbed... too many ads
Please turn up your audio level.
Please keep videos like this coming! We love it!
Jon, this is amazing. Well done.
as. one. man.
Wait what happened to Vichy?
Jon is this series just secretly a way to justify to your boss why you're playing with plastic football figures all day
Interesting video!. What allowed Heisman to threaten to fine cumberland?
"Pretty Good" is a terribly presumptuous title. These are "so very tremendously fucking good."
Awesome video! Love the stop motion re-enactments. Can I ask how you did the motion graphics in the stadium? Like what programs you used to get the 3D stadium and track in graphics?
Song at 5:00 Anyone?
I am in love with your style of stop-motion animation. It's uncanny how you make faceless, motionless plastic figures convey so much emotion.
Pretty good
how do you find these amazing stories?
You should do one of these on soccer games. Like when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0 or when AS Adema scored 149 own goals against SO l'Emyrne
ever heard of audio levelling jon?
Your channel is absolutely amazing.
You talk quietly and then play loud sound effects.  I hate you.
A little bit of HowToBasic at the end?
These are seriously amazing I die laughing every time
Reminds me if a Texas highschool basketball team that got beat like 110-0. I can at least see a team never scoring a touchdown or a field goal (though allowing 222 pts. worth of them through your defense is obscene), but how the hell do you never score a single basket?
What did your co-workers think of you playing with football toys and recording it with stop motion for hours
Wow, that 1916 Georgia Tech football team was pretty good.
Where did you get the information about Vichy Woods?
Best video I have seen in a long time. Thanks jon
Real life Breaking Madden.
YES, I've been waiting for a month, I love your series man!
Halloween theme perfection. This is horror.
Am I the only one that doesn't understand anything? Did the bad team lose on purpose?
"just like to say that these are so good, whenever they get uploaded I stop what I'm doing/watching, and start casting YouTube to my TV... and I have next to zero interest in American sports.

favourites so far are the marathon, and the drug addled baseball player."
"Jon, recreate this game in Madden. 

It's your destiny."
this is so good
Since you are on a streak about horrifically inept teams, consider doing a video about Andrea Moda, the single worst team in any motorsports ever. https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074334/http://f1rejects.com/teams/andreamoda/index.html
that was pretty good
Pretty good but the sound quality is not great when you're narrating
jon this is amazing
Awesome!
Love the original format of this show
The only way I could have imagined that score if it was some sort of exhibition, Harlem Globetrotters situation. The truth was way more interesting.
great work jon! it's a shame more people don't see these
"Greatest match of any sport ever! (at least for someone who doesn't watch sports)
I wonder how is this not a movie"
Seeing this in my inbox made me so happy
That editing really brought out the brutality that poor Cumberland had to deal with. You're a great story teller Jon. Keep it up.
I wonder what iDubbbz would say about his series?
The title totally killed that joke in the beginning
These stories are insane to me because it shows how "wild West" sports were back then. Can you imagine a team dressing a minor league team for a college game today?
As always Jon...this was pretty good. Keep up the pretty good work!!
First!
music that starts at 19:15 pls?
Then explain why the nfl put out an article saying the patriots almost scored the first 1 point safety against the bills on 10-29-18
Awesome video mate!!!!
37-5 Colts over Bills, Week 7 2018-19
How do you know these scores are the first ever??
I love Scoragami.
https://youtu.be/JpkIcDi1b30
So good the effort put into this video
Im waiting for the 73-73
"We almost had it!!! Scorigami!!
https://apple.news/ANs8hpfwjTqCE1WoEbgQZjg"
Brain hurty
i want an updated scoragami board it's been almost two years
This video is really cool and creative

I've got a significantly better scenario for the 6-1 game.  It might even be borderline plausible.   First of all, we're gonna put the game in very poor weather conditions (rain/snow/sleet).   Now, after one team scores the touchdown, they go for the extra point, which is snapped from the 15 (13 yards closer to that safety than going for two).    Maybe we tack on some extra yards for a penalty or two.   Now we can get some kind of chaos on the PAT (bad snap, blocked kick, etc).   The defense recovers the ball, tries to return it for two, and a fumble occurs near the goal line (in part due to the ball being wet and very difficult to handle).  We get a recovery by the kicking team and a retreat into the endzone with a tackle for a one point safety.
This video was awesome
Um you can score 1 point it is called a feild goal safety it is when you try to score a field goal and get it back all the way to your own end zone
Hear me this. I Cordell Erskine bring of sound mind and good faith do solemnly swear, if 6-1 scoragami is ever achieved, I promise on that day I will begin the process of getting a sex change.
"Washington NFL Team" Perfect.

2018 Scorigamis: 48-40, 29-29, 43-40, 37-5 GGGGGG
What would suck is if a team actually scored the 1 pt defensive safety, but then also scored a fairly rare regular safety in the same game, and ended with 3 points. That would kill every Scorigami lover out there.

Most interesting video I've seen in months
Ik I'm almost 2 years late but you win a game 2-0 on a forfeit because nobody gets credit for a safety
Who else could see the Browns losing 6-1
I just realized how close the bears had gotten to that last year against Pittsburg it was a pick that he ran all the way back and fumbled in the end zone but it ended up going out of bounds
Cmon chiefs you almost had it 40 - 43 so close to making it happen again
"That was sad, let's keep it sad."
I don't get it.
My team made scorigami last night 42-54
The only reason the scorigamis got higher is because black people started to play in the nfl
I LOST A GAME IN HIGH SCHOOL 4-3. I feel like nobody ever appreciated it so this video makes me very happy.
WE NEED AN UPDATED VERSION!!!
I like to revisit this gem from time to time. #HeresToYou4-4igami

This is such a 2 am YouTube video
A 1 point safety is possible look it up itâ€™s super hard and awkward but itâ€™s possible
this video keeps appearing in my dreams. idk why, but i cant stop thinking about it, its so fascinating. i need updates on scorigami after every season. please, someone. if you see this, do it for the children, we need this.
How am I just now finding this video
Wonder how much Doug Pederson will get for going for two quite often
I think I watched this like month after this came out and Iâ€™m back lol
Always knew there was something special about 43-8
There is a one point safety, yes, you can get 1 point.

For some reason this reminds me of a hypothetical super bowl of The Packers vs The Patriots when both teams were 1 and 2 Offense...and 31st and 32nd Defense. Analysts were joking the score was going to be 98 to 91 with over 900 total yards on offense.

Pats-Chiefs 43-40 Anyone?
"I never considered how unlikely a 14-8 score would be just strategically. There's no natural scenario where it'd make sense to go for two when it's 0-0, 7-0 or 14-0, so it'd have to be a situation like a team is up 11-0, the losing team scores and goes for 2 to make it within a FG, and then the winning team tacks on a FG at the end.

Either that, or it'd have to be a situation where a team goes for 2 regardless of the score. This commonly happens in adverse weather, which then makes the other team getting 14 points less likely. The remaining scenarios are like the kicker pulls his groin missing the first FG attempt of the game, so they just go for 2 the rest of the game."

Cfl you can get one point for missing a field goal
How much do I have to pay you to make basketball videos like this
Why are you even including the odds of an overtime game in your 4-4 calculation, by assuming it's 4-4 you are already assuming that it does go into overtime so the odds should be 260x less
But youre scenario for the 1 Ã¼oibt safety would be a touchback... Team a would have had tonrecover the ball before the endzone then run it back and the get tackled.
"15:11 ""...because it's a word I made up""
Lol"
"I'm in the severe minority here, but I'd love to see you do a scorigami for rugby. Like american football, there are plenty of combinations. You've got the 3-point penalty goal, the 5-point unconverted try and the 7-point converted try. 
Its cousin rugby league (no they are not the same) is even better for scorigami because you have the 6-point try, the 4-point unconverted try, the 2-point penalty goal and then the 1-point field goal. That last one makes essential any score possible, if not extremely rare. I've seen scores in top level rugby league of 8-1 or even 2-0."
Ive watched this before but i love this vid cause i love the music at the end.
What is a 5 point play in basketball?
"Was the AFC division playoff game between the Steelers vs Chiefs in 2017 Scorigami? It was 18-16

Edit: Nevermind, it isnâ€™t."
I love this video so much and often come back to rewatch it. Probably my favorite part is that observant fans come back after every new scorigami and comment about it. Also my one hope is for Jon Bois to reappear and save us all!
11-4 is my ultimate scorigami!
Can I have a part 2???
I would like to know what the most common scores are through NFL history like top five
6:26 Washington NFL team?  Oh....you mean the Redskins.  The Washington Redskins.  The team from Washington that is called the Redskins. I don't know if this was a mistake guys, but it seems you forgot that the NFL team in Washington is called the Redskins.

How do they score one? A blocked extra point ran back for a score?
I like the idea of the NFL adopting the one-point rouge. Somebody should start a petition!
Iâ€™m confused about the 2-0 Akron safety. So did Akron block the punt, then the ball hit the fence at the end of the end zone, and then an Akron player picked it up?
I thoroughly enjoyed the Seahawks segment. Go Hawks!
There actually was a one point field goal made in college in the 70s, didnâ€™t watch the whole vid so idk if he said that but just sayin, cu. of that any score should be possible
Nice music 10x louder than voice.

Why is it impossible to get 1,2,3,4,5,7 to one?
1-0 is possible lmao
Can score 1 point by safety on 2 pt coversion
I have no interest in American football, but this video was really interesting and well made
You said "Until the day [the defensive 1 point conversion] is done, there will always be one hole on this board," but actually there will always be one ENTIRE ROW on the board.  Even if the 6-1 happens, we'd still have the like 13-1, 16-1, 20-1, 27-1 (etc).  And those are the easy ones.    8-1 would be the 6-1 plus a safety.   10-1 would be the 6-1 plus TWO safeties.    10-1 might be the most impossible of the achievable Scorigamis (i.e., not something ridiculously high scoring like 1807-1800).
So the bears have sucked since the beginning?
Bravo if youâ€™re watched this whole thing

Scorigami Week 1 2018 Bucs vs Saints 48-40
The rouge is stupid, I hope the NFL never adopts it.
It's one thing for that 6-1 score to happen, but for it to be only highlight of the game is another
"Week 2 2018: two scorigamis already this season. Packers tie Vikings at 29; Bucs beat Saints 48-40.

Here's to many more this season, including the elusive 20-11."
This is my entire reason for loving football.
The rouge is cool but being how the NFL doesn't want kick returns, it won't happen.  I have seen a CFL game where teams kept punting it back and fourth on the same play.  The game was tied with no time left and if the team backed up didn't get the ball out of the end zone, which by the way is 20 yards deap, the game is over and they lose.  There was one time where a team was kicking off right before half time.  They kicked it short and the player who received it instantly punted the ball back.  It landed in the kickoff team's endzone with no time left for 1 point.  I posted a picture on Facebook where a game started at 1-1.
so youre saying that we, seahawks fans are unbelievably loud? damn right we are!

How much time did you spend on this. Love the vid btw
I think it can happen. All someone has to do is get too cocky and then the ball gets stripped and then recovered and then the tackle and all that. The hard part would come with keeping the game scoreless till the end.
You can get a point by making a drop kick

About that 6-1... LA Tech vs MS State
Forfeits are 2-0 because thatâ€™s the lowest possible score.
So 6 to 1 is possible, but that means that ANY NUMBER to 1, 8 to 1 or above, is also possible..
It doesn't help that its the dumbest sport in the world. Running into each other at high speed to get hold of a weird looking ball that you can't kick (unless the rules allow) across a line or in between two poles.
Well the chart says...
Found this video with no views, incredible stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawcHSpzRLk
you are forgetting about the very obscure 1 point safety
Canadian Football League is better
Why did this give me chills?
I dont understand what it takes for a game to be a scorigami game
There is actually a 5th way to build up 8 points exactly. It would have to be 8-6 in order for it to happen. A touchdown with a missed extra point, then an opponent touchdown with a blocked extra point, fumbled two-point attempt, or intercepted two-point attempt for a defensive two-point conversion. (6-0 then 6-6 and finally arriving at 8-6)
Idk if Iâ€™m proud or ashamed I watched this whole ridiculous thing. I was entertained, I must say
Yo. Good job with all the research. You worked hard. You deserve more views because you actually worked
Washington "NFL team?"  No, they're the Washington REDSKINS!!  No "PC" please!
Buccaneers 14 Seahawks 5 is a scoragami
Of course it was the two coaches with a rivalry anywhere they went
you can get 1 it is called a 1 point safety
I was at the Chiefs at Browns game. ðŸ’”
Any score is possible
Best video Iâ€™ve ever seen on YouTube
In madden like 2011 or 12 me and my brother accomplished the 1 point play a couple of times on purpose.
At Syracuse, Donovan McNabb threw an interception at the goal line that was returned to the opposite goal line.  McNabb chased the defender down and forced a fumble.  It would take a s in molar play to get that 6-1 score. Does anyone remember that mcnabb play? Cant find it on youtube....
What software was this made in?
Bro you forgot that rugby can also work for scorigami, what with the 3 point penalty, the 5 point try, and the 7 point converted try.
This and the Barry bonds video are my favorite Jon bois videos

3:20 you say "2" but your chart clearly shows four games that fit the criteria
Isn't 1-0 the official score of a forfeited football game, and therefore possible?
This video needs an update on the what's happened.
Scorigami Thursday 8/23/18 (yeah yeah ik it's pre-season) but we have an 0-5 with the browns beating  the eagles!
Miami (the U) defeated Florida 31-4 in 1987, the only college game I know in recent memeory where a team had four points
The 1970 Cowboys had two scoragami games in three weeks: 6-2 at Cleveland and 5-0 vs. Detroit in the divisional playoffs
The only people that dont like shutouts are casuals or people that never played. Watching a defense impose its will is just as exciting as a great offense
4:37  I'd guess the odds aren't exactly like that, considering teams that don't score in regulation probably have a LOT higher chance of remaining scoreless in overtime.  Also,  a team that gets a safety is probably significantly more likely to get another one than random chance.
Watched this again just to see if the Browns 5-0 win last night was scorigami
The browns just beat the eagles 5-0 in preseason
Browns just beat the Eagles (in preseason) 5-0!!!
When some coach is just styling on kids and up 30+ to nothing late, they should go for two and tell the RB to book it all the way to his own endzone to give the other team exactly 1 point.
5-0 SCORAGAMI TONIGHT
Idk if preseason counts but the browns just beat the eagles 5-0, which is a scorigami
44-33 Jags Niners last year
5:17 today we call them soccer fans
I spend hours a day on Pro Football Reference
Me 16 minutes in: JUST GET TO THE GODDAMN 6-1
This is literally my favorite video on YouTube
I kinda want a new updated version for 2018-2019
Raiders blew a 34-14 lead
I am going to find a way to force a 6-1 game in madden 18
Louisiana tech
I love a good defense, so the idea of a 4-4 game with only safeties would be a dream come true. For me, that says two perfect defenses fighting it out.
So, 4-4 or 6-1 which is less likely?
How about we change the rule that it's a touchback if you fumble the ball into the end zone. Let's call it a rouge and unleash more opportunities for scorigami!
College Football Scorigami?
1-0 is possible the college blocked safety could happen on a field goal attempt
Just try to imagine an 8-1 game
"Hey Jon, someone on the CFL subreddit made a CFL scorigami, there's a link here

https://www.reddit.com/r/CFL/comments/6v8rje/i_tried_my_hand_at_making_at_cfl_scorigami_sheet/

Cheers"
"Uh the closest thing to a 1 point score is louisiana tech vs Mississippi State in college 




You know the play"
Did it on backyard football!
Bears steelers 2017 thats how the one points gonna be scored
Will there ever be an update to the scoragami video?
I can see Jim Marshal Running the wrong way for a 1 PT safety.
At least give /r/nfl some credit for keeping up with Scorigami
This is one of the best things on Youtube.  Seriously brilliant.
jon is a very special bois
can we get an updated chart!
5:16-5:29 1980's Arsenal fans
Make chart party happen again!
Song in the beginning?
"@SB Nation +SB NATION
""or Tyer"" ? i know someone with the family name Tyer ... now for real tho, what did Tyer mean on the chart?"
How does this not have millions of views?!
13:28 They should've kicked Chris Gardiocki in the balls
BRING BACK CHART PARTY!!!!!
Has there been an updated scoregami chart uploaded anywhere?
They should update this video with the scoragami of the past two years
"The 6 to 1 score reminds me of Leon Lett and Don Beebe. Obviously it is super unlikely, but to say that it could only be drawn, but couldn't happen, would also have to say that Leon Lett could not possibly have been chased down and stripped by Beebe. At that point it would only require an unusual bounce, which is common place.
I remember that ""Fail Mary"" game on Monday Night Football a few years back too. The Packers refused to come out and line up for the extra point after that bad call, and if they had not sent anyone out there on that play, would they have reversed the score on that game to be a 2-0 win for the Seahawks, or would they decide that the score already dictated a Seahawk win and wouldn't need to be changed? You mentioned that rule, and I was wondering if it has a clause for if the team decides not to play after Half time or something."
There was 6-4 game in college in 2004. Iowa 6 Penn State 4. Look it up.  No wait, do yourself a favor and dont look it up.  Worst offensive game ever!
Obviously this gets vastly easier with high school and college games.  A friend of mine from a Missouri high school ran back a blocked extra point to score one point.  So 6-1 was possible under their rules.
I'm sure this has been said but when Jon describes the 6-1 game, I always imagine a Leon Lett type situation. doesn't seem that impossible for someone to get cocky & not hear footsteps behind them.
imagine... that BOTH teams get the 1 point-defensive safety in the same game, and the game score was 7-7. a very common score that was achieved by accomplishing the practically impossible, twice
What are the songs in the beginning and end
A masterpiece!!! The only good YouTube video
This was so much more interesting than it had any right to be.
Actually you are wrong on a 1-0 score. Theres one way it could happen, during a field goal, the defence can grab the ball before its kicked and get a 1 point safety if downed trying to loop around back in their endzone
You forgot the drop kick which I think is 2 points.
Football is for air heads
If a play like the Louisiana Tech 3rd and 95 can happen, the 1 pt safety could happen
The dark scorigami music makes me uneasy
I donâ€™t even watch football. And Iâ€™m like woah haha
Anyone over the age of 60 want to fill me in???
10-1 would be more rare
This is what religion used to do for people.
Make an update to this
The NFL needs to adopt a rule from rugby to help cut down on scoring.  First, have a second set of hashmarks five yards either side of the regular ones.  Second, wherever a touchdown is scored, that's where you have to kick the PAT.  If you score up the sideline, the kicker gets a very sharp angle, which means more misses.  Or, players try to enter the end zone on the middle of the field and risk being tackled or fumbling the ball.  The same goes for field goals, they have to kick from a wider angle.
9:12 thatâ€™s happened before
This guys videos are legendary
What about a 1 point safety you crackheads
This is a great video very interesting
Chart Party is so creepy but itâ€™s so interesting.
2:12 I feel like Jon placed that 4000-3000 X mark exactly to scale.  I seems like something he would do.
What is more unlikely of a final score? 6-1 or 4-4?
fantastic video, fantastic animation.
Love the video but you should have made it a heat map.
can someone explain the college 1 pointer? I didn't understand what that was about.
don't worry Jon Boi I'll continue scorigami for you
Do a chart party about how shitty of a franchise the bucs have been, could call the video the 'Bad luck Bucs'
1 Point safety?
music is on point. what is it?
"A 1-1 1-2 1-3 and so on are possible through the dropkick it is a when the quarterback drops the ball on the ground and kicks it either after it bounces or while it is on the ground through the uprights and it counts as 1 point 

The last dropkick was made by Doug Flutie on January 1,2006"
Are you keeping this chart up to date somewhere?
I live in AL and there was one game a couple years ago between Spain Park and Austin that ended 5-3
This is SPORTS AMAZING
SB Nationâ€™s VSauce
"There is a chap here in Australia who does a similar thing with the final scores of games in the Australian Football League - an example of his work can be seen here:

https://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Micro%2BNoises%2B195%253A%2BBring%2Bback%2Bthe%2B90s%2521/2912"
The most unlikely score I can imagine is 10-1. It's just like the 6-1, but the team that scores a touchdown also needs 2 safeties.
I think the 6-1 could happen if a defender celebreated early and then the ball went through the back of the endzone on an interception or fieldgoal block
OK scoragami is probably my new favourite stats thing. We need to find more sports with weird point increments and do somethin similar to those sports.
cant forget the college football 98 yard safety
Pretty sloppy statistical analysis, but I still love it.
The Os were up 3-0 that game
Brilliant. Magnificent.  And brilliant.
What about the 1 point drop kick?
A score of 1-0 is possible in the CFL (Canadian Football League).
Not since I started listening to podcasts like 99%invisible have i wanted to quit my job and do what you do.  Only, I could never ever approach your artistry.  i bow to your content made all the more awesome by the way your painstakingly nonchalant delivery ( that saxaphone!) I know you know that was an oxymoron I know this b/c You sir, are brilliant.  This i like my 10th thing of yours that i've watched and it is awesome...I don't think anyone else I know would enjoy this...except my 4 year old because for now he likes whatever I like, o i'm kinda in my own echo chamber here.  Anyway, good job and thank you.
"Wait... other than 6-1, why isn't the entire 1 row blacked out? You can't get a score of 21-1, can you?

edit: not sure why I felt that this video required a third re-watch, but here I am."
Seahawks still should have ran the ball
@7:13 bad memories ... we were up in the 3rd inning too. 3-0.
What is the most common NFL score?
Hey, there was a college play that led to something like 3rd and 93 from scrimmage. Granted, it wasnâ€™t on a PAT, but I still hold out hope for the one-point safety.
i want to see a 6-1 now... just for the highlight reel... just for the refs standing on the field confused and staggered, except for one, hes the one who watched the sb nation video on this, he gets excited and starts celebrating before he calls the 6-1 scoreline
The Rouge Rule seems like a good idea, WAAAY too many touchbacks these days, so what the NFL should do is move the kicking team back another 5-10 yards and if the receiving team fails to advance the ball out of the endzone or the ball lands in the endzone without going out of bounds it results in one point for the kicking team. It would stop a lot of the useless special teams appearances these days during kickoff and make the game a bit more exciting.
4:45 Our Solar System makes a complete orbit on the Milky Way galaxy about once every 230 million years or so. So that means we would make about 7.3 trips around the galaxy before that 4-4 game ever happens.
That transition at 1:00  lol
you made this seem like an old legend
"Honorable mention: 5-0 scorigami in the playoffs.  Dallas beats the Lions.  I forget when -- the 80's?  The Lions are in the playoffs so infrequently (and they've won only one playoff game since, oh, I don't know, 1958?), that this deserves some kind of honorable mention.
And actually, I don't know whether it was the first time that score happened, what with all the weird low scores early on.  But it's probably the LAST time that score has ever happened.  (A reverse scorigami?  Or a imagirocs?)"
That 1922 season looks awesome to me. Go defense... which is why I sometimes find it hard to watch
"I think a 6-point play is possible (might've been done)

3 pointer
and 1
misses, catches own rebound, another 3 pointer"
Did you make this in prezi?
4-0 is the best possible football score.
Can someone link me this music ??
Can someone explain the "5 point play" he has listed for basketball?
I thought I was going to hate this video....the core concept / first minute was just confusing to me.  I had to restart it twice but I really like what you did.  Lots of hard work obviously went into this.  Great job.
10-1 is the scorigami holy grail
7:02 Basketball 5 point shot???
The most likely way to hit 6-1 is either a coach or player deciding to do it on purpose. Snap the PAT and run straight back through the endzone.
The oddest score I ever saw was in 1970 when the Dallas Cowboys beat the Detroit Lions in a playoff game, 5-0 !!!!!!!!!!!
What about an extra point conversion when the defence takes the ball, and then goes down the field and drop kicks it for 1 point?
Music?
God my homework is gonna be late but this is so much superior
What about the 1 point safety?
Rugby union is interesting, too: in the modern game, scores of 1, 2, and 4 are impossible since scores only come in groups of three (penalty/drop kick), five (try without conversion), and seven (try with conversion). However, scorigami is harder to come by since conversions can be a LOT harder than extra points in American football, meaning otherwise â€œunusualâ€ scores are not only possible, but common.
Oh it can be done. Ray Claybon on his way to the first New England Patriots' kick off return for a touchdown spiked the ball on the five yard line. Oh it can be done.
We need a yearly update on this chart to see its progression through the years
"0:45

Can someone tell me or send me a link to what this song is called?"
A 1 point safety is possible but has only has happened
That 6-1 type play sort of almost happened in a college football game in the 2017 season
There is a 1 point safety. Look it up.
It's Jim harguagh dammit
What is that song at the beginning? I love it!
You can't have 0-0 because there would be an infinite over time?
I think 10-1 is the score we should all aspire to
I dunno what it is. Iâ€™ve never been the biggest football fan, but stuff like this makes me endlessly fascinated with the game. Good on you, Jon. May the scoragamis be plentiful.
Iâ€™m a simple man. I hear Jon Bois I click like.
I've heard the reason a forfeit us 2-0 is BECAUSE a safety is the only score not attributed to any one player, but rather, a team.
is there a current scoragami chart i can download? I have to do this now
I was at a high school game where a team went for the 2 point and fumbled and the defense got it to the opposite end zone, if the ball had been fumbled again it could have been amazing.
This deserves more views
Steelers vs Ravens 39-38 this past year
That "search YT using 'img ####'" is the best thing ever! With one number combination alone, I found videos of a beautiful dark brown horse in a deep green meadow, absolutely the cutest cream-colored kitten in the world, and an iso of someone opening a can of Chicken of the Sea tuna, all only seconds long. To maintain their highly pristine condition and keep these videos "wild", I did not like or unlike them, nor leave a comment. Amazing bits of digital ephemera.
I knew the Seahawks would be king at this
instead of being winner and loser for the two edges of the board, couldn't you extend the board by making it home and away? nearly doubles the board
You should do this with the CFL scores!
There was a scoragami in 2017 when the Texans beat the Titans 57-14.

"That was sad.



Letâ€™s keep it sad."
Your videos are always interesting. However, you very often make quite harsh judgments about sports fans of the past. It comes across as if you expect fans 100 years ago would have had the same sensibilities as modern people. This attitude in turn seems to make you take some things out of context. Sometimes you sound like a modern person making fun of cavemen for not driving cars. On top of that, it's all based on numbers and data crunching, which to me feels soulless. It's all very interesting though.
whats the song in the beginning?
I can't believe I actually watched this whole thing
Your probability calculation for the 4-4 game assumes all the events are completely independent, but that is probably not the case.  A team that scores a safety is probably much more likely than average to score another - perhaps the quarterback is sick or a guard is injured or a defensive coordinator as found a way to predict the play.  Still very unlikely though.
I'd LOVE to see scoragami for women's football! PAT's are a crapshoot, and the talent disparity can be VAST!
I did the IMG 4 numbers thing and I found a red haired girl in a church on a piano playing under the sea from disney's the little mermaid
Would a 6-1 game not be possible by the much more likely situation where team A scored a touchdown, then their PAT is blocked, taken back for one point?
I was made extremely uncomfortable by img 5148
What about that Doug Flutie dropkick ? That was 4 points wasn't it ?
Please like this comment comments that comment here are for the new 2018 nfl season scorigami
10-1 is mathematically impossible too, and others
More like this
Im so happy to have watched this. Im sure if you scorigami Division 1A Football you would fill out the whole chart
Long live Scoreagami!
A 4-4 tie can be 2-2 or 0-0 score at the end of regulation, and then both teams can can score 1 or 2 safeties in overtime to make a 4-4 tie.
As long as you could get 6-1 couldnâ€™t you get 8-1 9-1 11-1 so on 10-1  if the rule is what he said it was
Nice vid ðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ
Is the one point safety only in college?
1-0 is possible, but it's basically impossible
Now do it as percentages.  For example, if you score 0 points, you win 0% of the time, but if you score, 73 points, you win 100% of the time.  Ignoring ties of course.
You are talented!
Damn you little white boxes! Your lack of productivity has resulted in no one ever winning a squares pool with your numbers.
That 1 point on special teams was made in me on Madden once...
"Who are these people that go to 0 - 0 games in the pouring rain??" Ahem. Soccer fans.
Part 2 plzzzzz
can anyone do me a favor and let me know what software he used to make the animation? A lot of the 3D effect and transition looks really cool
What about 8-1
how is 7-1 possible? for one team to score just one point doesn't it require that the other team fail to convert the PAT?
Anyone know the name of the song he uses in the intro? That soft jazz track
"9:56

i hope you choke"
Unfortunately, the 41-33 super bowl was not scoragami. In 1954, there was another 41-33 game which the eagles won. The scariest part, the Browns were the 1954 champions later that year
I wonder if Super Bowl 52 was added to scoragami
There's been no 11-9 score dammit
that one point safety play has the smell of cleveland all over it
What if a field goal gets blocked into the teams whoâ€™s kickingâ€™s field goal. I know itâ€™s ridiculous but it is possible so what would be ruled?
So the only time we will get 6-1 is when a play like Louisiana Tech happens on a 2 point conversion
If you kick a fieldgoal in overtime. The other team turns the ball over. In the same play the losing team is able to score a safety. Who wins?
4 to 4.  So you're saying there is a chance.
The reason forfeits are two points is because when a team surrenders the other team is given a saftey because its the only score that isnt awarded to an specific player(s)
Wtf is the Washington NFL Team? That's really what they were called?
The rouge is the greatest rule in football!
My kink is using it to create pathetically regular scores. Missed extra point and two safeties vs 3 fg and 2pt con td. 10-17.
I heard that the NFL is thinking of changing the safety to account for 4 points instead of 2 since they're so rare
I did a defensive 2pt conversion in madden twice in a row
4 point field goal
Iâ€™m not a super huge football fan. But damn was this interesting. This makes me want to go watch some games of teams that I donâ€™t even like
single point scores are possible thanks to the dropkick. Flutie attempted the last one
ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
Wonder if this guy ever things â€¦ so?
Please please please update this every season!
a 1 point safety is possible, has happened in college, i don't know if it's in the NFL rule book
The best way for the 6-1 final score to happen is if a team scores a touchdown and then fumbles the 2 point conversion and the ball is picked up by the defense and taken all the way except the guy slows up at the end, and gets tackled and fumbles the ball with the kicking team recovering in the end zone for a 1 point safety
49ers jags 44-33 was the first time that score ever happened
So there was a game in 2017 between my outrageously ignored team, the Texans, and the outrageously overhyped Titans. The score was 57-14, which is a scorigami. This game is what the future will be for BOTH my Texans (with Deshaun Watson) and the Titans starting in 2018!!!
wouldn't 8-1 be more rare than 6-1
1 point is possible if a safety happens on the pat
10-1 I think is the most unlikely score, considering you need the extra point safety for 6-1, AND two safeties on top of that for the next 4 points
A 44-33 score from the Jags 49ers in 2017! Scorigami!
There was a Bucs-Lions game that was tied at 11 at the half in 2000 I believe. I remember that was the only time that happened.
Ever since I watched this for the first time, Scorigami is the only thing I care about
A 1 point game is possible
I feel like one day in the future, the 1 point safety will actually happen, but the team will pair it with other scores so it just looks like a normal score and doesn't achieve Scorigami, and Jon will just implode
This graph is unnecessarily complicated
NFC championship game stl 11 tb 6
Answer: Cleveland Browns.
a forfeit end in 2-0 because a safety is the only score that can be attributed to no specific player
Whatâ€™s the first song
4:44 Imagine how tragic it would be if a 4-4 game went to overtime, and we think we'll see our second-ever 4-point score...only for the teams to go FG, FG, FG and finish with a perfectly mundane 10-7.  Or the first team with the ball gets a touchdown, resulting in another final of...10-4.  I think I'd cry.
49ers Beat the Jaguars 44-33 Iâ€™m pretty sure and thatâ€™s new
Fantastic!!
I think the methodology used for the odds of a 4-4 tie is somewhat flawed. Instead of using the overall odds of a team taking a safety in a game, you shouldâ€™ve used the odds of a team taking a safety in a game in which theyâ€™re shut out on offense. A 4-4 tie would obviously mean that neither team scored any offensive points. That implies really bad offenses and high-quality defenses, which would seem to raise the probability of the teams taking safeties.
In the cfl you can win 1-9
Didn't realize the statistics behind the sport.
49ers jags finished 44-33 which is scoragami
10-1 would be the ultimate Scorigami. Two safeties, a touchdown, and a safety off the point after somehow, someway.
7 to 1 is possible isn't it, 7 from td with pat and 1 from 3 fg with a safety.
"15:40 ""Harbaugh was a noted Scorigami artist""

Literally 2 minutes before: ""Nobody tries to achieve Scorigami because it's a term I just made up in the making of this video"""
This is stupid.  You can get five points because Safety = 2 Points and Field Goal Attempt = 3.

"I can't believe I just witnessed one on my Christmas Eve, with Jaguars @ Niners ending up 33-44. Earlier in the season, I speculated on that comment section that a match like JAX-HOU could give us one, as they were the kind of atypical teams that could do it, but it ended up being with the Niners instead xD.

EDIT: Well, I just stumbled on the SBNation article about that Scorigami, and I saw that this one is the 8th of the season so I should cool off a little bit, that's not something that happens as rarely as I thought."

Jon's collection of discordant piano music has inspired me to amass such a collection.
It took me until like sixteen minutes in to realize that a scorigami was just a score that hadn't happened before. that made everything a lot simpler.
This is great work. Thank you for all of your considerable efforts on these videos.
Is there a way to add the dimension of commonality to these scores?
your suggestion did not disappoint. Img 5239 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7IQ1tElb5s
Wow just, wow
Did the Ravens & The Steelers make a scoragami last Sunday? Score was 39-38
1 point safeties exist
The Browns ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
There have been six scorigami this year (2017) as of week 14
Scoragami update?
"Here is a mathematical proof that the only impossible number of points a team can achieve is 1 (obviously ruling out that 1 point defensive safety):
Take any number n and divide by 7 to get a remainder of r, that is n=7m+r where m is an integer (which can be zero) and r is a number in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, there are thus seven cases to consider:
r=0) if n=7m then scoring m touchdowns gives you a score of n.
r=2) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and a safety give you a score of n.
r=3) if n=7m+3 then m touchdowns and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=4) if n=7m+4 then m touchdowns and two safeties give you a score of n.
r=5) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns, a safety and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=6) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and two field goals give you a score of n.
The tricky case is r=1. We must divide into two ""subcases"":
  n>+7) if n is greater than or equal to 7, then m must be greater than or equal to 1 (otherwise m=0 so that n=r=1<7 which is NOT the case). Thus n=7(m-1)+7+1=7(m-1)+8 so that (m-1) touchdowns and another touchdown with a 2-point conversion gives you the required score of n.
  n<7) if n is strictly less than 7, then m must be zero (otherwise n=7m+r>7 which is not the case), therefore n=7(0)+1=1, the impossible score!
Conclusion: for every number n>1, there is a way to achieve that score in football by conventional means (given sufficient time obviously); the only score that cannot be achieved in an ordinary manner is n=1."

Iâ€™d be curious to see this for college football
This is retardedly awesome
Why make things difficult by diluting the equation with keeping regulation and overtime scoring separate? Also, "games in which the offense was shut out" is the incorrect variable as it doesn't factor in defensive scoring. In my opinion, the equation for the probability of a game ending in a 4-4 tie should look something like this:  "Odds of a team scoring 2 safeties in a game" x "Odds of a team not scoring any points other than those gained from safeties in any game", then multiply that by itself to get your value for both teams doing it in the same game. All variables should include all regulation and overtime scoring combined rather than splitting it up, it seems much easier that way as it's removing an unnecessary variable and calculation from the equation.
November 19 2017 produced two scorigami. NE 33 Oak 8 & LAC 54 Buf 24.
A single point can be very easily scored in Canadian Football. :D Also baseball and the rest of the world (soccer) disagree about low scoring sports. Finally, I believe the 2 point drop kick is still on the books... so there is that.
If the eagles kicked the extra point, it would've been scorigami.
17:32 that game wasnâ€™t played at the Seahawks stadium
4:45 You can't have a tie in a playoff game man... it would be 256 games rather than 267 because the 11 playoff games can't end in a tie of any score. This is the only part of the video that really bothers me.
"I have to clarify the 6-1 possibility you detailed. It would have been a touchback how you described it. After the defensive team fumbled the interception into the end zone, the recovering player would have needed to attempt to advance the ball or have intentionally retreated into the endzone and then downed/tackled for it to be counted as a safety. Simply fumbling into the end zone and an offensive recovery is not a safety due to the change of possession. 

I'm a stickler for the rules. Especially NFL rules. Thus, I hate Dean Blandino.

Great video though."
So what's the  music used when talking about the Dark scoragami? It's come up in a bunch of videos but I don't know what it is
In the end I thought of Jim Marshall (guy who ran the opposite direction to score an offensive safety for the other team)
But how are the other x - 1 scores possible?? 8-1, 9-1, 13-1 and so on? are they all based on the same 6-1 process?
I'm getting a 1 point safety in Madden, hold my beer
"Why 2-0?

I donâ€™t know."
Anyone know the music that starts at 9:58?
lol pick 2 just a few days after he made this.
A scorigami board should be published and updated every time a new one happens.
In the calculation for a 4-4 game you included playoffs. But playoffs games can't tie. So the it should happen every 1,839,795,140 years.
This guy doesnâ€™t earn enough
0:00 its called the 1 point safety
The defensive 2 pt conversion isn't super rare in college.  It happened to Notre Dame at least twice in 2016.
How many Scoragamis have we had in 2017 so far?
I'm extremely disappointed because he said "8 is a weird number" right at 7:59
Shout out to Jimmy Grapes and the 49ers for putting a slot on 15 (15 - 14 vs Bears)
Fun fact: I got an entirely natural 1-point safety in a game of Madden. I'm assuming it was a glitch. Link to a clip will come if anyone wants it/cares
Is this man using prezi
i dont know how you got that much time and mathematical knowledge to do all this. but you surely grab my attention every single time, even though my math is bad and my footbaal knowledge is kinda mediocre =D goof freaking job sir! @SB Nation
Scorigami 33 8
2 to 1 is possible
1 point safety?
Can someone tell me the the name of that last song
Woah he said itâ€™s nov 30th and today is November 30th 2017
"Still lots of scorigami left in rugby league. All of the usual scoring methods are even numbers. A try (the equivalent of a touchdown) is 4, or 6 with a conversion, and a penalty goal is 2. A field goal is worth 1, and it's usually only used to break a tie, or to gain a lead of 7 (or 13, etc.)
I remember one game where one guy thought a conversion missed when it was actually good, and kicked a field goal, thinking it was for the win, and his team lost by one, I think 20-19. One-point margins where the winning team scores an even number are super rare. It could also happen by scoring a field goal to take a one point lead, followed by conceding a penalty to lose by one, but it hardly ever happens."
"I think that the best bet for a 1 point safety would be this:

1 point kick is blocked. Defense scoops and up and runs 97.9 yards. Offense is fast on their tail. To make it in they have to dive. They fumble on the dive before crossing the goal. The ball squirts out the back of the end zone. 

Boom. Defensive safety."
That 40-39 score is the most stereotypically Browns thing I've ever heard.
I only watch your videos for the background music
Grandparental permission XD!!!
Isn't a forfeit scored 1-0?
There can be a 6-1 game easily in Canadian football because the rouge rule which means a touchback and a missed field goal that goes through the end zone is 1 point.
Strangely enough a long time ago playing in the yard with friends and  we somehow had a 1 point safety on a long scramble gone wrong resulting in a 20-33 score.
They should have said what the chance of a 6-1 score is
1 point safety
I think a lineman catches the kick and laterals it to a speedy guy and there 1 point touchdown
What about a 1 point safety
That IMG #### thing actually works! I randomly vote this random fact of the day
Would the 6-1 game be possible if a punter punted the ball backwards into his own end zone and that team falls on it?
This is honestly one of the best YouTube videos I've ever watched
Thereâ€™s actually a 1 point safety itâ€™s during an extra point and has only happened three times
Fun fact: if you block a PAT and take it all the way, you get 2 points. What happens if you fumble the ball, the other team dives on it in the end zone, and you down him. Is that another case of the 1-pt safety?
I wish I could give more than 1 thumbs up.
1 point safeties only exist in minor leagues
19:05 yes. Yes it can. Player A doesn't stop running, and Player B gets cocky. They celebrate. Player A strips the ball away. Somehow, the ball bounces in a way that keeps it in the end zone. Player A jumps on it, and Player B downs him in the end zone. There's also Player B mishandling the ball, Player A maintaining possession and somehow losing it out of bounds, and the 2008 Detroit Lions :)
There are 1 point plays though they are rare

When he says "That was sad, let's keep it sad."
what about drop kicks?
What happens if you have a PAT caught by the defense (either missed kick or two point PAT),  and then the defensive player carries it back, but opts for the drop goal instead of the touchdown? Obviously only Drew Brees would try this, but still

*Forgets about 2 point conversions
About the potential 6-1 score, I feel that a fumble recovered in the end zone would be counted as a touchback rather than a safety, so you would have to recover at the 1 yard line and then be tackeled into the end zone.
I love the way football has its scores.  It makes the game very interesting!

I had to turn away after 8:45 (as per Jon's request) what did I miss
That damn Bears vs steelers game I thought I was gonna see a 1 point safety
Team A scores a touchdown, gives up a 1-pt safety. Then team B does the same. It's 7-7. I think that's the worst thing that could ever happen in a football game.
Steelers and bears almost did get the 1 point conversion
If Mississippi St. vs Louisiana Tech proved anything with that 80 yard fumble, it's that the 1 point safety could be possible!!!
There needs to be a website thatâ€™s constantly updated
you could also catch an extra point and return it lol
Hey Jon, in your example at the beginning of a 14-14 tie you drew the vertical line crooked and put the X in the wrong place
theres actually something called a 1 point safety
Actually, 6-1 can also happen if the defending team on a PAT attempt scores a dropkick goal. Since there hasn't been a dropkick-attempt in the NFL pretty much since the dawn of time, Idk if its more likely than a offensive safety, but hey, double the options right?
"No 9-9 games,  interesting. 

And no 46-0 or 50-0. USC beat UCLA 50-0 in 2011, and beat Colorado 50-6 in 2012."
There was a college game this year where the players kept kicking the ball from one goal line to the other and it ended up as like a 3rd and 92. If that happened on an extra point it would be 1 pt

If someone pulls a fumble like the Miss St vs La Tech one that happened this year on an extra point, 6-1 might happen
Hi
The Chicago Bears fans that enjoyed the scoreless ties must have been soccer fans.
No wonder why sentient space crafts like football.... This crap is crazy.
"Isn't 10-1 a harder score?
That would require that 6-1 bullshit
Plus
2 safeties"
Your 6-1 example isn't even correct. That would just be a touchback. Team A would have to recover that fumble, run it out of their own end zone, and then run back in their end zone and be tackled. I am disappointed you got it wrong after all of that waiting you made us do. Sad stuff.
Awesome video :)
Madden is about to get broken ðŸ˜ˆ
there is a loophole to win a game with less points then the other team
6:28 *Washington Redskins
You forgot all about the 1 point safety
ever heard of the drop kick? look it up. doug flutie 2007
1 to 0 can happen because of a one point safety
"I just looked into this, and I found that Belichick is also 7-0 in Scorigami with the Patriots (yes, I know Carroll is 8-0 now), but according to Pro Football Reference, Belichick has won these 7:

2004 vs. Rams (40-22)
2004 vs. Browns (42-15)
2012 vs. Colts (59-24)
2012 vs. Jets (49-19)
2013 vs. Steelers (55-31)
2014 vs. Colts (43-22) (playoffs)
2016 vs. Bills (41-25)"
Who else remembers Rams vs. Bucs in the 99 playoffs? 6 to 5 at the half. Ended 11 to 6.
I think 8-1 would be far less like ly
The 1 point safety nearly happened in the Steelers Bears game just a few weeks ago.  Blocked extra point, run back for almost touchdown, Marcus Cooper had it punched out and into his own endzone.  Very nearly happened.
How about college football?
"We're not quite at the halfway point of the 2017 season, but we've already matched last season's total of five Scorigami games.

Week 1: Rams 46, Colts 9
Week 3: Rams 41, 49ers 39
Week 4: Texans 57, Titans 14
Week 4: Seahawks 46, Colts 18
Week 6: Saints 52, Lions 38

Some takeaways from these games:
â€¢ In all five games, the winning team scored more than 40 points. By comparison, the league-wide scoring average is just shy of 22 PPG.
â€¢ The Rams and Colts have already been involved in two of these games. LA won both, while Indianapolis lost both â€” allowing exactly 46 points in each.
â€¢ By recording only the seventh 57-point score in NFL history, the Texans broke their single-game scoring record by double digits in their Scorigami. Houston's previous high was achieved in Week 13 of the 2014 season, in a 45-21 victory against... the Titans.
â€¢ Pete Carroll continues his statistically-unlikely sorcery (scorecery?), notching his eighth consecutive season with a Scorigami win. At this point he has to be doing it intentionally."
The reason why a forfeit is 2-0 is because the safety is the only way of scoring points that isn't attributed to a single player.
Why can't 7-1 happen?
Fun video! Have you considered that some of these events may not be independent? For example, in the 4-4 situation, a low scoring offense and opposing safeties have an association with another, so multiplying those probabilities may not accurately estimate the overall probability of the event occurring?
I can't watch an NFL game anymore without thinking of this video.
We need more vidsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Steelers vs Bears game on Sept 24th, 2017 almost did that. Cooper blocked the kick, returned it to just outside the goal line, then the Steeler knocked it out of his hands and came damn close to falling on it in the endzone. Ended up knocking it out kind of. Weird play in an of itself which took far to long. Long and short of it is that the Bears got it on their 2 yard line. Not a 6-1 score mind you, but a 1 point safety could have happened.
This may be the best video on YouTube
Time to move the PAT spot to in line with where the TD was scored, like in rugby?
Although the 6-1 score is nearly impossible, a similar event compared to the explanation of scoring just one point happened between Mississippi state and Louisiana Tech on September 9, 2017. LT was 2nd and goal from the opponents 6 yard line, and the ball got snapped over the head of the quarterback. MS players kept trying to pick the ball up, and ended up pushing the ball backwards even further until a LT player fell on the ball at their own 7 yard line. LT was 3rd and goal, 3rd and 93, from their own 7 yard line. They lost 86 yards on one play. So although it would be hard to score just one point for a team, the event just described shows that it is possible.
This is the best sports vid on YouTube highly underrated
"14:35 the one chance for the browns to win- they blew it

Rams made history. The first team to ever get 2 scorigamis in 3 games
"I stopped the video when the chart at 6:26 referred to ""Washington NFL team"".

This sounds like an 80's movie to me. Especially the end. I love this content.
It just happened again! For the first time in over a year!!!
Interesting fact: no team has ever scored 50 points and not won
Scorigami this weekend! 41-39!
Craziest scoragami I've ever seen was in a college football game that ended 6-4. Penn State v Iowa 2004.

41-39 SCORIGAMI!
17:33 Need an update 41-39
There was that LSU game where they were 3rd and goal from their own 7. Something like that could definitely happen on a 2 pt attempt.
I would love an update video.
Happened last night. 49ers and Rams scored 41-39, a new score thatâ€™s never happened.
Why doesn't he count the APFA the first version of the NFL 1920 -1921 because 66-0 has happened why ??????????
A 6-1 score is possible but the example of the safety following the conversion return is not correct. If Team A fumbles the ball into the end zone and Team B recovers in the end zone, it's a touchback, not a safety. In order for a safety to be scored, the actions of Team B would have to cause the ball to go into the end zone. This could happen either by the person who recovered it running into the end zone or by a player from Team B batting it into the end zone during a recovery attempt.

Could you do this Kind of Video about Rugby Union?
Seahawks did one in their 14-5 loss last season.
I did some rexearch in Finland, and a finnish maple league (top level) game has ended once with one team scoring four points.
I would like to see the chart with a third height dimension to show frequency. Somebody make it happen.
That last example wouldn't even be a safety. The A player would need to advance the ball back out of the end zone, then either run back in or fumble it back into his defensive end zone, where it would have to either go out the back or side of the end zone or be recovered in the end zone by team A
I remember watching the first ever 11-10 game I think it was Chargers vs Steelers
I was more impressed with your graphics than the information itself.
Mind blown... also go hawks
The fact that Marshawn Lynch caused an earthquake...
Except the drop kick exists so it is possible to score one point
I hate these so much. Not Because they are bad, or because of the creator, but because there are so few! The way you put these Chart partys and Pretty Goods together always has be super excited to watch.
This honestly blew my mind
I love your content, but honestly the music...ugh. haha. Might be better without music my friend.
"I've created a twitter feed that tracks in real time the chances that an NFL Game will result in Scorigami.  You can find it here: 
https://twitter.com/nfl_scorigami"
We need updates every season on whether there were any scorigamis. I know that this year, there was a 46-9 scorigami in week 1 and a 30-2 in the preseason, though that does not count.
I love how there was a game-winning defensive two-point conversion return just a few days after he made this video. It's perfect.
I actually like low scoring games because I prefer defensive battles, tough thing about that is being a Packer fan
Not aware of the "new" conversion rules?
Eric berry got a defensive 2 point conversion in 2016 against the falcons
1 point safety's
I'm sure there are lots of lower level scorigami scores, but maybe this is rare; I played in an 18-4 game. They scored 3 TDs, attempted 2 point conversions on each, the same player on our team intercepted & ran back 2 of them. (Game played on a 70 yard field on a hill. Not high quality. Match report; http://sabres.union.shef.ac.uk/club/history/0506-season/ )
"That was sad now let's keep it sad"-john bois ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Last week, Louisiana Tech came just seven yards away from the sequence of events required to give up a 1-point safety (although this occurred during regular play and not on a conversion attempt).
Would 12 to 74 be scoragami? #Maddenlogic
Extra point intercepted
This guy must have been really really really really really bored
SB Nation what software did you use to make the graphics?? It looks great! Also, nice vid btw!
Lol I went 98 yards the other way for a safety on madden one time that's how I knew the rule
15:09 technically they are combinations but awesome video though. I never knew I wanted anything as much as a 6-1 score.
The six to one could happen though...look up Louisiana Tech' 3rd and 93
Someone make 6-1 happen on madden and upload!
In singing high school they blocked a 1 pat and they returned it best moment ever
1-0 is absolutely possible, you get 1 point for a "Drop Kick", Doug Flutie Pulled it off in 2006 for New England as the extra point after a touchdown but this can be done outside of extra points.Â  Nobody in their right mind would do this instead of a field goal but it is possible.
"Though the probability of a team scoring exactly one point in a game is astronomically remote, it must be noted that in today's NFL, with the extra point located at the 15-yard line instead of the 2-yard line, the kicking team would have to lose 85 yards on an extra point attempt for the 1-point safety to register as a score for the other team. While ""Scorigami"" correctly proclaims the play to be nearly impossible, it is not entirely inconceivable. 

Despite the extremely low probability of a team losing 85 yards on a play, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Louisiana Tech lost 87 yards on a single play against Mississippi State this year (2017). The play did not result in a safety, but it certainly could have if the line of scrimmage was further back than where it was (the Mississippi State 6-yard line; 2nd and goal). The ball was recovered by the Louisiana Tech offense at their own 7-yard line. Remember that the line of scrimmage on an NFL extra point is nine yards further back than it was for the aforementioned play. If an NFL team were to lose 87 yards on an extra point attempt, they would have to recover the fumble two yards into their own end zone.

Further, the chances of losing 87 yards on a field goal (or extra point play) is more likely than losing that much yardage on an offensive play with the quarterback in the shotgun. When the Arizona Cardinals gave up a touchdown to the Buffalo Bills last year (2016), the snap traveled 26 yards behind the line of scrimmage before it was touched. This is more than the 21 yards lost by Louisiana Tech before the ball was touched, only increasing the likelihood of the defensive 1-point safety.

In conclusion, the one-point safety is not at all inconceivable. If a bad snap on an extra point kick attempt, followed by an egregious number of fielding errors strikingly similar to the former play mentioned above were to occur, we just might witness the first defensive 1-point safety in football history. But even if this cosmically rare event were to occur, the 1-point total score by a team could only exist if their opponents were able to hold them scoreless for the remainder of the game."
There's a 1 point safety on field goal attempts that are easier to get, look it up
There is something called a 1 point safety. For a example, If Justin Tucker were to have a kick blocked and Ray Lewis (opposite sides..) catches it. IF Ray were to run out and was tackled back inside the end zone, its a 1 point safety..
What if u block the extra point and take it to the house
1 point is possible
This would make football squares so much easier to bet on knowing which squares have the best chance of happening.
Sloppy probability calculations, but I guess you were just going for 'approximate' answers. But things like 'what is the probability that there are 2 safeties by each team AND each team is shut out offensively' will not just be the product, because those are not independent events.
Super Bowl 24 was Scorigami 49ers 55 Broncos 10
That was awesoem
You can technically score intimate amount of times if the kicking team (on kickoff) recovers the ball and scores it's a touchdown with no time of the clock it happens to the bills in 2016
1-0 is possible.  If a really rare thing happens in college football (yes this is nfl but it can most likely still happen) a 1 point safety will be on the board.
Would 6-1 be possible with a drop kick by recovering team on a conversion attempt after a blocked PAT, fumble, etc.?
Someone needs to try and make a 6-1 game on madden
"Colts vs Rams Week 1 2017
New Scorigami: 46-9"
"You should post the chart on twitter or something so we can see if any current NFL games are new scoragami
EDIT: After looking at week 1 scores, the Rams-Colts game filled the 46-9 scoragami"
For anyone curious, Jon Bois is NOT counting preseason as part of the Scorigami chart. He said this on his Twitter on August 31.
rams 46-9 colts....scorigami
Imagine the blood vessels this guy would pop if a play to make a game 6-1 happens then the losing team kicks a field goal to make it a more common 6-3 game
Pretty close to a scorigami with the 29-19 Vikings vs Saints game. 29-12 (no Drew Brees TD pass in the final few minutes) or 32-12 (Vikings want to get a scorigami, so they kick a field goal at the end of the game instead of taking a knee) would have been scorigami.
does this count preseason?
Colts 9 X 46 Rams in wk1 is a scorigami!
Another hole is filled on the board. 46-9
You're 6-1 game may be easier to obtain than you think. A rule change in the last few years (I'm not sure if it was before or after this video) makes it so that if a PAT is run back by the defense, it only counts as 1 rather than 6.
The 4-4 odds tho
Newest scorigami today (9/10/17): Rams vs. Colts, 46-9!
There are now 1 point safeties in the NFL and NCAA
Just ask Louisiana Tech about losing lots of yardage on long fumbles.
I like your articles Jon, do you still do breaking madden?
Running an extra point kick back for two happened like two or three times last season!
Mind blowing vid ðŸ’¥
4000-3000 is possible the kicking team just has to grab the ball in the end zone for a touchdown over and over again because the clock doesn't stop
The editing is amazing great job!!
You should do literally the highest score possible. So let's say there is a 10-yard kickoff and the other team tries to return it as fast as possible. Let's say  like the fastest kickoff return possible is 8 seconds. Then, if u can go for two in 2 seconds, there would be eight points every 10 seconds. That's 720 points a quarter; 2480 in a game.
Look up, 1 point safety.
Also the fact no one would go for two on their first score when they're up
"Ehhm, what about the one-point safety? 
edit: jumped the gun when he showed the Lego's."
pleaaaase do this with college football. this is such a good video but i'd love to see how crazy the scores get with the massive amount of games
"The whole time I was watching this I wanted to see this chart as a heat map.
So I made one: https://goo.gl/XGuPtF
Red = only happened once
Yellow to green = less frequent to most frequent

Top 5 most frequent scores are wins by 3"
I thought 28-24 was very common
Can I please get a scoragami sheet that I can fill out while playing football like Bingo?
What about the bengals browns 2004 58-48 game or the 2007 bengals browns (again) 51-41 game? Those were very interesting scoragamis. The bengals won both. The browns know how to loose.
why won't he say Washington's full name?
"I don't like it when people praise Pete Carroll.




But that's just because I'm a 49ers fan :)"
if preseason counts Broncos just beat the Cardinals 30-2 so that would be scorigami
Does this include preseason? Idk if he mentioned it.
This is the best video on the internet
I NEED THIS MUSIC
Instead of Winning team-column, Losing team-row, why don't you do Home team-column, Away team-row? Then you have the full board at your disposal instead of just half of the board.

What about a game that is 2-2 at the end of regulation, and 4-4 after overtime?
gawd, you must have been sh%ttin' lego bricks during SBLI
"Gets a 6-1 score...






Ends up 21-20"
You can get a  1 point safety  look it up  I think Texas  A&M  did it
When you mentioned NYG vs. WSH was the highest scoring game, what about GB vs ARI?
Amazing  video
The song is Flying Dragon by Dieter Reith in case you don't know.
Isn't 8-1, 9-1 10-1 etc also impossible?
You should sell scoragami boards
A score of 1-0 is possible. Conversion safety
your graphic at 9:20 has a 7 block and a 2 instead of a 6 and a 2
your math is off. the likelihood of scoring a second safety is dependent on how safety prone an opponent is.
Is 6-1 capable in Madden??
football is great
Do you think Ten and Juice ever saw a 4-4 game?
um there is other sports where scorigami could be a thing
The music and editing are off the charts! This is so enjoyable to watch
Why did you call them, "Washing nfl team."
Jon's scenario at the end for the 1-point safety is actually incomplete and the real thing would be even less probable. A safety is only possible if the team has possession of the ball. However, if the defense intercepts the ball on the two point conversion, they would officially have possession. So if the ball was fumbled in the endzone by the defense and recovered by the offense, it would only be a touchback, resulting in no score. In order for the 1-point safety to happen, the defense would have to get possession of the ball (e.g. interception), lose the ball in their endzone (98 yards away), have the offense pick up the ball (thereby regaining possession for the offense), carry the ball OUT of the defense's endzone, and then somehow get tackled back into the defense's endzone. For all intents and purposes, it's basically not possible.
You can score 1 point in the NFL if a field goal is blocked and then recovered in the end zone by the team who blocked it you get a 1 point safety ik crazy right
"""No team has even come close to a 73-0 win...""

2009, week 6. Patriots beat the Titans 59-0.

Probably would've been worse since it was 45-0 at HALFTIME. 45-0 AT HALFTIME!
Pretty damn close if you ask me."
This is just one really long shower thought
Never seen your channel before but this video was incredibly interesting
I'm watching this at night and the rare rules terrified me
wew boi
Now I wanna see a 1-0 game
Great video, learned so much! Thanks! How about 100 likes for no reason
Every work of Jon Bois' I've ever seen has given me a weird surrealist feeling while simultaneously assuring me of my place in the universe.
Note that Team A would also have to bring the ball out of the end zone and then go back in for it to be a safety; otherwise it's just a touchback.
You spelled Redskins wrong.
This was in my recommended, and it was incredibly interesting! Earned yourself a sub my good sir.
There can be a 6-2 game with no safeties!
And I thought I had no life researching NFL history...this is next level, bro.
Welp, a game just happened between the Bucs and Jags then ended with a score of 12-8. Is that scorigami for you?
Another banger
Is the one point safety only a rule in college?
In Seattle there's a good chance in Seattle your eardrum could be ruptured as Seattle fans have gotten so loud they've been just 12 decibels away from rupturing eardrums.
I love how the Dark Scorigami segment was genuinely unsettling to watch. Or maybe it was just because I watched this at midnight with the lights out. I'll give Jon the benefit of the doubt.
What if you had a computer simulate future NFL seasons based on historical probability taken from previous seasons, kinda like how Jon did in this video? Would we get some crazy fractal-esque patterns at the end?
This the best video I've seen on YouTube this year... And I watch a shitload of YouTube.
Wait, isn't a blocked PAT returned worth 1?
Rugby Union scorigami
Except a safety on PAT is a one point play
With the new PAT rules, idk about a 6-1 game, but I think a team scoring 1 point is very possible. We've seen it happen before on INT returns, albeit rarely.
Seahawks!!
i tripped balls this entire video,
I won a 10-1 game of Madden 07 with a friend, so I guess I'm pretty much a scoragami expert
Are there any other videos similar to this one, or about scoragami? I want more lol
i want to see an 11-4 final score before i die
What's a 5 point game in basketball?
The Eagles had a scorigami of 54 to 11 vs The Bears.
I don't even like football but this video is amazing
Please someone make a Scorigami board on Google Docs or whatever, so we can follow it this season!
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball
this should be a tv show
What's wrong with low scoring games? I love defense.
Scoragai as you put it could also work in rugby Because in that you have 2 ways to get 3 points and one way to get 5 and one way to get seven so it doesnt work in order of magnitude like most other sports
Even in 17776, there's probably never been a 4-4 game. lol
why did you put on that annoying noise around 9:30 ? shits horrible
Straight facts
5 zero-zero games?! The NFL used to be FIFA.
There is some cases where there is a 1 point safety so there could be a score with 1 in it
what am I doing with my life why am I not watching these videos
this makes me want to start a game with multiple ways to score different amounts of points, and the goal isn't to score the most points, but to get the closest to a certain number.
What happens in the NFL if a blocked FG is brought back to the EZ and is downed by the defense?
I'm surprised that 4 was in a score before 5!
I got scorigami in Madden 25! It was 25-9. The AI scored a TD with a missed 2-pt conv., and kicked a field goal. I got a two 7-point TDs. a safety, and three field goals. (EDIT: Let me put the scoring in order: Me: 7-point TD AI: FG Me: 7-point TD AI: 6-point TD Me: FG Me: FG Me: Safety Me: FG)
Me and a bud once played Madden with 15:00 minute quarters, I threw like 14 pics, still won the game like 200 to 150. The announcer called the final score as "a bunch to a bunch."
The 6-1 play happened,Texas vs. Texas A&M
8:55 it's 2-0 because no single player gets credit for a safety
How would you get a 5 point play in basketball
Greatest video ever?
There's a 1 point safety
Wouldn't a 6-1 score block also occur if after team A scores a touchdown they kick it through team Bs goal?
All these chat party videos are so good. Very interesting
18:50 Wouldn't that be a touchback and therefore unsuccessful try? For team A to give the impetus to put the ball in its own end zone it has to get the ball in the field of play and carry it into the end zone, or bat or kick the ball into the end zone. If team B fumbles the ball into the end zone, the imputus is on team B.
Under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks have had a scorigami each year, and even better won all seven
This dude is a G.O.A.TðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I wish that Jon made more videos
That was pretty good
Where's the jazz music from?
AYY K-STATE
Jon Bois is a gift to this Earth
Wait am I totally wrong, or can't you make a 6-1 win also by returning a blocked PAT?
Just a reminder to any uppity Seattle fans that KC took the noise record back the next game.
Did the image search with a random number thing... first try, see a turkey fight, seems about right...yeah, let's not do that again.
Jon Bois is a national treasure.
the word scorigami got funnier the more you said it
What's the music at 5:29 please?
Before starting as a Seahawks fan I know SB 48's 43-8 is the only time that score has happened.
One time in the 1970s, the Rams scored two safeties in a game. The same player, Fred Dryer or Drier, made the scoring tackles.
You're stupid! How could you forget the most obvious 6-1 situation of a defensive interception on a PAT attempt, in which the defense decides not to run it into the endzone, but instead do a 1 point drop kick. Maybe watch a football game sometime. You should know that.
Would a 6-1 game also be possible if, on the extra point attempt, the defense runs the ball down the field and drop kicks the ball through the uprights?
That was sad. Let's keep it sad. ðŸ˜‚
do this with the nba
1-0 is possible in the cfl
a forfeit is 2-0 because a safety is the only score not attributes to any player
my favorite SB nation video by far
5:28 I don't understand people who waste their time making a 20 minute video about NFL scoring statistics
This was insanely interesting
What's the creepy music sound from?  Sounds like a Silent Hill scene.
I still love all these videos. And also the fact you can see the mouse move across the window at the very last second.
Look at the rock island independents of pre NFL pro football they only played 4 games in 1908 and had 2 scoragamis till this day, 4-0 and 8-2 Jon I'd love to see you make a scoragami board that includes all pro games from 1890s on
Will there ever be an 8-1 game?
This video deserves my like. Great job!
Hop up, how is the numbers past seven to one possible?
So is 13-1 possible?
Guess this was made before the Bucs beat the Hawks 11-5
Personally, I think your "odds" of a 4-4 game are wrong.  After doing my own seperate calculations, I've determined that the true odds are: once in 471,078,670,372 games, not once in every 470,897,555,931 games.
6-1... challenge accepted
Chart Party! Woot, Woot!
There was a 58 - 0 game john, you didn't mark it on the chart
What did you use to make the chart?
can i print this out?
Two teams in the preseason need to make a 6-1 game
At 5:27 when Jon says "Who are these people?" I decided to look up Lon Warneke and he was a pretty good pitcher in his day! He had a 192-121 W-L record and played in 5 all star games
Why couldn't 6-1 just happen like in the college game?
Canadians what is a rouge in the CFL?
does anyone know what is used to edit this - wanted to use it for a class
5points is impossible in basketball?
THIS HAS TO BE THE DUMBEST ISH LOL
18:14 - For those not familiar with the "rouge" of the Canadian Football League, that's one of the big differences between the leagues; another is that there are no touchbacks in the CFL.Â  If the ball is kicked into the opponents' end zone, it must be returned.Â  If they can't get it out of there, the kicking team gets that single point, or "rouge".
I imagine BB might in a situation where he scored a TD on the final play... he would probably say kneel. or Put the fastest guy there  and tell him run out the back of your own endzone. just because he likes to have fun sometimes.
I like this but at 7:03 there is no 5 point plays in basketball
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do Scoragami for College Football. PLEASE
Why are you afraid of the team name "Redskins"?
This is amaxing
This was the dumbest video I've ever seen
Is your name pronounced "boy" or "bwah" Because of your name sounds like Jon Boy that's awesome ðŸ˜‚
The One Point Safety has happened twice in the history of College Football I believe.
Jon Bois is that you? upload more on your main channel
im too high for this video
No offense but a blocked xp returned for a touchdown is a one point score it has happened
I dont particularly like football but that was insane
This was the most interesting thing i have seen in a while. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"9:08 thats a 7-block you used there

oh so is 9:47"
Damn. One of the best videos I've ever watched
What NFL game occured when the losing team scored 8 points? I wonder.......
this was actually pretty good
But what is the odds of the inventor of scorigami saying "scorigami" more than anyone has ever said "scorigami" before? Hmmm? Is THAT a scorigami?
Where can I find the music that plays in the Chart Party videos?
such a cool video
I have a question about that 1-pointer. If it's fumbled, recovered by the other team while in the endzone, and then he's tackled, why wouldn't that just be the equivalent of a touchback? In other words, in order to give up a point, wouldn't he first have to venture out of the endzone and then step back in and be tackled?
Lol did I really watch this whole thing just to find out how a score of 6-1 is possible...
You also see far more safeties in the CFL.  If a team's set to punt out of their own end zone, chances are they'll just take the safety.  For a variety of reasons (longer field, shorter series,  uprights on the goal line), field position is very important.  It's often worth giving up two points to push the opponent back 20-ish yards.
if you fall on the opposite teams fumble in the end zone it's a touch back
I knew 6-1 Since I did it in Madden
I thought this video was going to show every NFL score that has ever happened...
When was the 11-10 score?
Genius...
can't believe I watched this :)
what did i just watch
"Have to point out two mistakes.
1) Any high score is possible both technically and physically because on a kickoff time doesn't start until someone touches the ball. So if you kick it into your opponents' end zone and recover it there, you score a touchdown without wasting a moment of playing time. And PATs, of course, are untimed.
2) For it to be a safety, you have to carry the ball into the end zone yourself. If your opponent fumbles forward and into the end zone and you just fall on the ball, you are awarded a touchback."

What's the song?
Washington Redskins. Washington Redskins. It's the Washington REDSKINS.
Hey im new to this channel and ive Gotta say, your channel is awesome
can somebody tell me what program was used to create this video with 3d animations and all that? It's like a virtual world
that is one way to get 6-1 but if team A got a touchdown and team a's kicker missed the extra point off the goal post or for whatever reason it was short... a player from team b could catch the ball in the air and run it back to his own endzone resulting in 6-1

Now this is what I call hard work. Congrats, dude.
This seems like something i would do at 2 am
your statistical analysis seems lacking. use conditional probability. for instance, a scoreless overtime is much more likely to occur in a game between two teams with poor offenses than in a game between teams qith average offense. you essentially double count the poor offense. a 4-4 is probably 100 - 1000 times more likely than you state here.
the 1 point play hooked me but the video was good enough to keep me watching regardless.
19:09 isn't that a touchback?
I got a 1 point safety in madden before. So, the dude went for 2 and I intercepted it ran back to like the 2 yard line, fumbled, the other team recovered and I tackled him in the end zone
this video was amazing
this is exactly what I needed to watch to distract myself from my physics homework #procrastination
I'm from Canada and I've won a high school game 2-1
I feel like I am watching a conspiracy theory
Very enjoyable!
what has my life come to
Wasn't there a defensive 2 pt conversion this past season?
Why do I love watching this?
i dont know about exact math, but i think he messed up the math about a 4 to 4 game. he added that the other team has to be shut out, but they arent shutting them out. it should be probability of a 4 point score time 4 point score times scoreless overtime. otherwise cool video

The score can also end 6-1 if the offense goes for 2, the defense somehow gets the ball, and just before the defensive player crosses the goal line they drop kick it through their up right. This is another fairly new rule. (new being added in the 60s i believe)
Blocked extra point offense picks it up in end zone? 6-1
all scores above 11 are possible with only 7 points for a touchdown and 3 points for field goal
so doesn't that mean 13-1 and 20-1 and so forth could be possible?
One of the most interesting Youtube videos ever. Loved it. Thanks :)
music at the end gave it away...scorigami? more like illuminati!!
Go hawks!
This is my favorite video ever
Let's say team A gets a TD, then they go for the field goal. It's blocked, then ends up in the hands of team B, who runs it all the way back. Would that result in 6-1 game??
This has got to be the best football video on the internet
I did the defensive 2 pt conversion on madden mobile but it gave me no points?
Scorigami can also work for rugby but admittedly not as well as football
Wow this is very interesting!
1-Mar
What if a 2pt conversion gets intercepted and instead of running it back into the endzone you kick a fieldgoal..? I mean nobody would do that but is it allowed to kick the pat on the other site?
your videos are so good I love stats and numbers so much xD
Whoa
I've scored 1 point in madden 16
Could the game end 6-1 if on an extra point or two point conversion by team a, team b instead of running it into the end zone kicks a drop kick? Or would that even count?
that 1 point safety soundtrack really spooked me out
Is the one-point safety only in NCAA rules?
I have just wasted almost 22 minutes on convoluted bullcrappage by a guy with a great voice...
This is one of the best youtube videos I have ever seen
scorigami is fantastic! thanks!
This was awesome
i like how he made us wait till the end
Epic video, man. So awesome.
I feel like every time I watch a football game now, I will be wondering if it was a scorigami.
seeing how little amount of 8 pt plays there were makes it all the more impressive that the patriots had 2 back to back in the Super Bowl to win
"""that was sad, let's keep it sad.""

me_irl"
"His likelihood of a 4-4 game is a little off.

Although this would be hard to calculate, in reality, the chance would be lower:
When one team scores a safety, they need to kick it off to the other team.  Usually this kickoff gives good field position for the other team making it even more likely that they would score, and less likely that on that drive they would get a safety.

A reason why it would be more likely to happen than he calculated:
His statistics that he used for how many overtime games end in ties is based off of statistics from before the overtime rule change.  It used to be that the first team that scored won, no matter what.  Now if you score a field goal, the other team has a chance to tie or pull ahead.  This makes it more likely that it will be a tie because a field goal on the first drive doesn't automatically end the game.

There are a few other things that don't make as much of a difference, but are still a factor.  An example of this is that now on kickoffs the ball starts at the 25 yard line on a touchback, not the 20, which makes it harder to get a safety."
Quality
the fact I can't skip ads make me wan a delete YouTube app think I will and find some where else to watch random crap
This is literally one of the most interesting well made different videos. The way the scenes flow and change, the animations, music, creativeness... o give this 10/10 it just impressed me alt
Does vox not give you any money at all? Interesting topic but oddly written and choppy editing made it rough on my stomach. SB deserves better than this.
That was fascinating. Thanks Jon Bois!
the defensive 2pt and 1pt conversions only entered the NFL in 2015 when they moved the PAT back.  But I doubt anyone will ever get a defensive 1 point conversion
the research tho!! the amount of work you put in this video for a 100k sub counts is amazing. i subbed just for the efforts! but the music... WTF
There is more than a 5-point play in basketball, a 17 point play has happened before... Which was also a 5 point play for the other team. http://deadspin.com/5152216/high-school-basketball-team-pulls-off-rare-17-point-play-for-the-win-update
What a well made and superbly edited video
You don't understand people going to watch the 0-0 game? Soccer is pretty popular worldwide! haha!
Boycotting your videos now... Who the hell is this Washington NFL team?...
How long did this video take?
This is incredible.  Great video!!!!
My mind was blown
Surprised 21-14 had never happened
My head hurts
Teach us the arts of scoregami
Of course that happened to the Browns ðŸ˜‚
wtf that was sick
Not sure if it's the voice, the mystery of "scorigami" or the music, but this video has some serious anime vibes to it.
Could they also get that single point by drop kicking an extra point during the conversion try by the defense running it back 98 yards? I fully understand how hard would be, just wondering if that would count.
This is fantastic. Should've talked about Steelers Chargers, 11-10 a few years back. Troy Polamalu returns a desperation lateral by the Chargers back to the house only to have the touchdown called back (even though it was clear that the pass was backwards and the score should've been upheld). The call preserves the scoragmi in the only 11-10 game in history. As a kid, even as a Steelers fan, I remember rooting for them to overturn the call just to witness history! haha
I should be doing a lab right now due in less than two hours..
Next season it's gonna get done now that you said it can't
A 1 to 1 score is possible however. The chances of that happening are absolutely nearly impossible.
Ok, so 1 point is possible in any game where the other team scores a touchdown?  So its not just 6-1 that will keep scorigami going on forever, right?
I loved this video
Good video but Washington has a name. REDSKINS!!! Dont be afraid to say it proudly.
Great vid. However, on 6:37 you crossed off the Buffalo Bills as they should've been included with the three other teams. Sorry for nit-picking.
This video sucks
On Tecmo Super Bowl I beat the Raiders with the Seahawks (Cortez Kennedy) 2 - 0  in OT. I thought it was the best game of TSB I ever played.
It'd be interesting to see a College football scorigami with schools that are in the FBS right now
what. the hell. lol
I guess the people who disliked, thought this was click bait, has cancer, is autistic, or somehow thinks this guys logic is autistic
Why arent the superbowl scores in here? Huh? you said ever
how do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
This video inspired me to go on to madden and win a game 6 to 1.
If you add college scores you could have a crazier scoragmi
Really good video I must say.
"A crazier stat is that in 1905, 19 players were killed during play, due to the lack of helmets
Source: http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/19-football-players-died-in-1905-but-calls-for-reform-1277528900"
Solid video, kept my attention for the full 20 minutes and I'm not incredibly interested in football.
0-0 game, Team scores, time has expired, decides to go for two anyways, purposely runs it back for a safety.
awesome chart
one point safety
Jon Bois Editing and Production is A1
how about the 6 to 6 Seahawks tie with cardnails on Sunday night football now that game was crazy!
18:27 is rhe 6-1 game
In high school you can end 1-0 if you don't score in overtime because they go off of who goes the farthest
You can score 1-0. It's a 1point safety.
If you want proof that the one point is possible look at Brian Boddy Calhoun who in 2016 fumbled ,what would be a pick six, into the end zone resulting in a safety
nice video
This is very interesting and all and I love the concept of the video but you lost me after 4 min. I wasn't going to watch the whole 22 min of this. It's a shame, on my part. But I'm really not interested in finding out about the possibility of 6-1 score. Your amazing video made me sit the first 4 min.
This video was incredibly well done
nice video very informative
IF EVER THERE IS A 6-1 GAME, BROWNS WILL BE ON THE LOSING SIDE OF 6-1
What's the song at the end?
awesome video man
This video was pretty spectacular. Very informative and fun to watch.
Awesome video
I think the fact that there are not a lot of "good" games makes the actual good games that much better because they're rarer
The music made this video amazing lol good stuff
Someone make a video of them getting the 6-1 score in Madden. It'd be interesting to have people pre-enact some of these crazy scorigamis in Madden, considering Madden is a tangible thing we can actually visualize. That is considering Madden would have some of these peculiar rules such as the 1-point safety. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't tbh.
my high school once won a game 2-1. safety> rouge
I love the sports reference websites for years. They have literally every single statistic ever, and I love it.
This was incredibly interesting. I enjoyed every single minute.
Falcons 43-22 Packers, a new Scorigami.
This video was amazing
who knows about the game last year (2016) when the buccaneers beat the Seahawks 14-5?
Extremely well edited. Well done.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
lets go seahawks
I can't believe the bears have the highest score
Why isnt 2-1 possible
MIND BLOWN
8-0 browns win
Lol Pete is the wizard
You can have a one score if you get cancer and watch Andrew drinks water #1
KC vs ATL had a 2-point defensive conversion. It actually won the Chiefs the game.
17:16 Actually, the first play of Super Bowl XLVI was a safety.
Why was this recommended to me? I've never even watched anything relating to football, nor do I watch or really enjoy it. GODDAMN IT YOUTUBE!
Gotta give this guy props
Actually for the 1-point safety and the 6-1 game, A falling on the ball in the endzone wouldn't be a safety. A would have to recover, run it out of the endzone, and then fumble it back in again (or run backwards into the endzone again) and be tackled.
My brother and I scored the one point on an old game of NCAA. He fumbled the two point, I ran it back and fumbled on the one
if an extra point is blocked and run back, is it one or 2 points
you didnt go back to the college game
There are actually new rules implemented to where now a pat can be brought back for one point. And a pick six on a 2 point conversion gives the defending team 2 points. So 1-0 isn't possible but 6-1 is possible in 2 different ways now. They used to call a play dead on fumbled pats and fumbles or interceptions on 2 pt conversions. But not since the new rules for the 2016-2017 season.
Just thought I'd inform you that the Washington, DC based American football team is called the Redskins.
this just made me whole
Original Video
This was amazing! Great editing and animations
I'm such an idiot that I got on Google Maps just so I could find out where he zoomed in on at 16:22.
For the one point safety, let's say team A scores the touchdown, and team B intercepts the two point conversion attempt and takes it back almost all the way then fumbles.  If team A recovers the fumble in the endzone and gets tackled, is that a one point safety scored to team B or just a zero point 'touchback?'  Do they actually have to recover it outside of the endzone and then move backwards into the endzone while trying to advance the ball for it to truly count as a one point safety?  This video implies that the 'touchback' situation also counts as a one point safety.
Now I know why it's called the quake run
Not only can't it be done. It's not a safety! They would have to recover on the field and then enter the end zone to be tackled there.
The Patriots could win a game 14 to 17.
I love this video
The Patriots beat the Titans 59-0
Phenomenal video! This has got to be one of, if not, the most interesting video I've ever seen about football. Thank you so much for your dedication!
What if the extra point bounces off the post and goes into the opponents goal post thus making a 6-1 game
wow that was probably one of the beast 21 minutes of my life
awesome video!
Whoever you are you need to play Light Yagami in the American live action deathote
"Honest question: Can anyone ever see a woman conceptualizing this, writing this, filming this and editing this? 

Men are just smarter than women. Facts are all around us."
AMAZING video idea dude!
For defensive 2 pt conversion, at 9:10, you should have shown a 6 point lego block. great video overall man. edit: this is really good, and I like the ending
neat
Thank you for including the rouge.
A rouge can happen, it's very rare.
Having trouble pronouncing the word "Redskins" I see... smh
That was a beautiful video
The 1-pt safety can also happen on an extra point on a fumbled snap where the kicker has to kick the ball backwards out of play, I think.  That scenario happened on a punt in a Pats-Colts playoff game.
The background music from 7:20-8:30 and at 9:57--> (and others?) sure does it for me..  Oy!
I enjoyed this video a lot more than I probably should have
what the hell did I just watched? is this autism? I like it. I imagine a new trend in making internet fuss everytime a possible socrigame might happen and people celebrating it cheering back and fort on teams to achieve it,. this is nice... certain imageboard might like it.
This man just made football interesting.
Awesome video
there is a way you can get 1 pt in football, but rare
Good-ass video
"Washington NFL Team"? wtf is that?? Is it because of the name being 'racist'? This is just sad now.
great vid, almost delegitimized by "Washington NFL franchise"
Could someone explain me how is 6-1 possible but not 7-1? A TD and 1pt field goal would give 7
What about a TD then a Blocked Extra Point that is returned????  6-1????
this was a great video.
If I could ever use one video to sum up my life, this would be it.
The one 11-10 game mentioned during this was Pittsburgh and San Diego in 2008.  Remember it like it was yesterday.
My mind is blown
that is cool
This is super interesting. You should create a website or blog or something detailing the "scorigamis" in the current season, would definitely watch it to get deeper into the game.
"Scoragamis this year according to the graph

Seahawks 37, 49ers 18
Patriots 41, Bills 25
Panthers 46, 49ers 27
Falcons 45, Saints 32
Falcons 48, Panthers 33"
mind blown
Great video
There is such a thing as a one point safety...
in 1922 you can see a 62-0 win, jesus
yo i know this is prp realy late but i kinda want a pdf of the chart
"If you search IMG 0001 you will actually see a video that has like 9 views that is of a deer eating some leaves!

Maybe that's what he was talking about at the end"
awesome vid
Technically 1 point could be scored if the defense gets a turnover on an extra point attempt and drop kicks it.
This was actually really cool
good video
Nice video man
If teams tried for a scorigami then wouldn't Goodell investigate for gambling purposes?
What's the score that has occurred the most?
Amaizing video!!!
This was a really good video....
I'm surprised Tomlin doesn't have more Scorigami games given how often he goes for 2.
He should do rugby
Greatest video ever
This needs to happen with college football
For the defensive 2-pt conversion...there's a 7 block not a 6 block.....
Where is the Seahawks 58-0 win against the Cardinals? I don't see it on there
I believe it but this doesn't work in madden
Titans in 2013 got a safety Vs the steelers on the kickoff. The dude caught the ball and took a knee but he had part of his foot out of the end zone so when he stepped back in and kneed it, it was a safety
I  could not stop watching this..
"IMG 3288

thank me later"
Very cool video!
this is my favorite football channel on youtube
my brain hurts
How do ties happen?
American football is boring and always will be.
Ok that was cool
I'm not much of a football fan, but I love these sort of statistical analysis videos. This was very interesting and well made, great video!
sooo this could have happened in the pro bowl?
This was an AMAZING presentation.  Was the slideshow made with Prezi?
Wow not even really a fan of football.. But i sat through all 20 minutes of this, i guess i really like this whole over analyzing thing.
as far as i know there is no 5 pt play in basketball even if you make a 3 and they fould you plus technical then you will have 2 chances to score 1 free throw.
18:24 Explanation of 6-1 score, finally.
Good job on 100,000 subs. At this moment im typing this he has not even 101,000 subs but over 100,000 subs
This is a true masterpiece
7:56 42 of them were scored by the Steelers.
only video about the NFL i'm interested in.
Fascinating video. Thank you.
I was pretty sure you could get a 1 point Safety without scoring a Touchdown.... not sure tho
the 2-0 score is due to a safety being the only score not attributed to a player
i like the part after 8:34
the 63-0 does not have a square, however the patriots beat the titans 63-0 in either 2010 or 2009
Great video, lots of effort
If I play in the NFL I will make the 6-1 game just for you
"International Rugby Union is another sport that Scorigami could work with. Tries (touchdowns) are 5 points, Point after conversions 2 points and penalty goals/drop kicks 3 points. But what shakes it up is than tries have changed in value from 1 through to 5 points over the life of the game, conversions 2-3 points, an briefly dropkicks were worth 4 points. 

Yep, in the early days of rugby the PAT was worth more than the touchdown."
What am I wasting. My life watching.
what program did you use to make this?
Has anyone tried the 6-1 game in Madden?
Really interesting video. The one thing I would have to say is that the calculation for the probability of a 4-4 game is a little incorrect. You're assuming that each probability is independent of each other, where in real life, if two good defenses were to play each other, the actual conditional probability of the 4-4 game happening would be higher than the number calculated. However, calculating that might be quite difficult, and I'm just nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking.
This video is lit
the two point defensive conversion in Madden lol
The look on the ref's face at 9:40 is priceless: "how the hell am I supposed to explain this to everyone watching?????"
That one time in the NFL...
This is the only good YouTube video thanks jon
This is entertaining
The scenario you posed for 6-1...wouldn't the kicking team have to pick up the fumble OUTSIDE the end-zone, and then run it back into the end zone? Falling on a fumble that's in your own end zone doesn't result in a safety, since the impetus came from the player who fumbled.
"And I promise we will get to it." -Audeince: Ughhhhhhh
didnt know math could be fun
if you play Madden you should attempt to get scorigami
6-1 could also happen if a missed extra-point were to remain in the field of play, be recovered by the opposing team and run all the way back to the opposite endzone. Right?
This is the most interesting video I have ever watched.
Where can I buy that poster?
at 6:30 were they really called the "Washington NFL team"?
Btw, they have the forfeit be 2-0 because a safety can be a stat where no player gets it, such as running out of the back, so they have it be 2-0 so no player gets any stats.
You earned a subscriber great video
Can a win of 10-1 happen?
"I know a great deal about football and I found this video to be really informative.

About the 6-1 scoragami scenario you presented though. I'm pretty sure on a regular play, it would result in a touch back where team A would have the ball on their 20 yard line instead of team B getting a safety. So I think to truly get a 6-1 game, you would need a panicked or confused team A player to take the ball all the way back to their own endzone without turning the ball over to team B."
you're math was way off. if there's a 86 % chance of a scoreless ot, you don't multiply by 86. because if there was a 100 % chance then the odds would be bigger (?) that doesn't make sense. can I work at SB please? I'll do the math to start out with but it will be so good that I'll get to write op eds. these are my dreams.
im lost
John Boise you forgot to mention the odds that both times a 1 point safety happened in college football, the same announcer was there.
(Commenting about the end of the video) Most videos with no views on YouTube are just listings for houses, cars and other junk.
Can't you get a one point play if you block an extra point and run it back?
What a good video
This guy changed my life
this is brilliant
Someone knows how to use Prezi, watch out :o
1-0 is possible if the score is 0-0 and one team forfeits.
9:21 this can also happen by blocking the point after touchdown. Unfortunately, my team actually went through this rare scenario when kicking an extra point to win the game because the now former special teams coach of my team was insanely inept.
you should mark Scoragami's that have happened in Superbowl's in red.
This is amazing! I don't comment often but I really appreciate the work you put into this - how you made numbers & scores so interesting is beyond me but it was fun to watch!
this is an excellent video, you deserve more views for the work that went into this.
Doing a scorigami for the CFL would be crazy
So... Totally random: but you say that no team has ever ended a game with 4 points... but there is a green square in one of the 4's (like 14-4 or something, didn't quite see what the opponents score was).
Why isn't a 1-1 game possible, drop kicks are worth 1-point there for because NFL games can end in ties there can be a 1-1 score
but there are 1 pt safeties
6-1 can also occur by having a touchdown by team A followed by a blocked extra point, fumble, or pick which is returned almost to the endzone, before the team B player carrying it, for whatever reason, drop-kicks it through the posts.
The alternative 6-1 scorigami is if the extra point is blocked and the ball somehow makes its way into the scoring team's end zone with them on top. An 85 yard block is unlikely however, and would also likely require a return that is fumbled and recovered in the end zone by the scoring team.
this is the most elaborate uselessness I've ever witnessed.
why does this not have a million views this is amazing
12:46: The most Browns thing to ever Browns.  And there have been a lot.
Isn't there another way to score 1 point or is that just college?
you keep on talking about how the nfl was able to last because all the games were "boring". You have the privilege of being able to watch a leauge that has had almost 100 years of history. The rules have changed so much since then that defenses are able to do much less. You have the context of what a "good" game is, people back then didn't.
@19:11 you can also get 1 point as defense, if the extra point kick, is short, and a defensive player catchs its and return it 100 yards.
Falcons blew a 28-3 game
What about the one point safety?
6-1 happened to me in madden
This is literally the best video I've ever watched
The reason the game ends 2-0 if a team forfeits is because a safety is the only score that isn't recorded to a specific player
need to remake this cause Pete Carroll Struck again witha  6-6 tie.
My ideal game is a defensive battle that ends like 5-3 or 7-2 maybe 13-7.
Did I just spend 20 min watching this?
lol i did this in madden like 5 yrs ago and won 6-1
coach of team a tells all receivers to run backwards, QB throws int the instead of attempting to tackle the defender, they just punch the ball, let it roll into the end zone then team A picks up ball in end zone and "falls" out of bounds
IDK if it fits here but what about the seahawks 6-6 tie with the cardinals in October 2016?
Wouldn't a 6-1 also be possible if a conversion was intercepted or fumbled and then a drop kick was scored by the the defense??
That's not that bad
amazing
How about the defensive two point conversions where if the defense gets a TD during a conversion their team gets 2 points?
Coolest vid ive seen in a while nice work!
14:00 explains the browns organization in one play
The team with 1 can score 7 and get 3 safety's resulting in a 6-1 score
I have you a like, just because this took an insane amount of research
CRAP! at 14:23 I thought my screen was falling to its side I literally grabbed my monitor XD
Fantastic.
Related: Probability of winning the final score in Super Bowl Squares http://tabsoft.co/2ko8AIK
"Here's what I wonder... how close would Madden scorigami be to NFL scorigami? Are you more likely to see a Madden simmed game end 6-1 significantly before 1.7 billion seasons pass. What other differences are there? Are there scores much more likely to happen in Madden that have never happened in the NFL?

Seriously... is scorigami... ""in the game""?"
"There was a game that I went to where at one time the score was 11 - 10 Iowa. (Iowa ended up winning 14 - 13)
But this is possible by:
Michigan: 1 touchdown, 1 Field goal.
Iowa: 1 safety,  1 touchdown (2 Point conversion failed), 1 field goal."
I love how he makes scoragami sound like this famous historically important thing not something he made up 20 minutes ago
I'm not a football fan, at all, but that video was amazing!
The Steelers just scored 6 field goals in a game
10-1 try and calculate those odds. One touchdown plus defensive 1 point convert plus QTY 2 2 point converts.
Might be fun to play pro Scoragami every season with just scores from the season so that first game of the pre-season the board was 'empty'. You buy scores based on probability or some such.
2-pt conversion on Falcons...
will you be updating the chart after the Super Bowl?
I think it's kind of nuts that 14-8 hasn't happened.  Winning team gets 2 touchdowns (simple), losing team decides to try for 2 pt conversion on their sole touchdown to be in better position to win.  That's kind of an insane move, since a failure puts them in crazy bad position, but I could see it happening.
Early football was pretty much one or two powerful teams and then like 6 garbage teams, many of which no longer exist. It was also running based before the forward pass was even legal. 3 yards and a cloud of dust football.
werent field goals originally 5 points?
Forfeits are scored as a 2-0 score because safeties are not awarded to any player but instead to a team
Eric Berry made a defensive 2 point conversion this season
I wonder if Madden would accurately reflect the 1-point safety on conversion attempts. Probably not, but someone needs to try it.
this video was pretty good
But there's a one point safety when the defense recovers the ball over any type of turnover and retreat back into their own endzone and get tackled.
You deserve way more subscribers.  These videos are great!!!!!  Keep up the good work!!
That was like...cool
This stuff is better than Matlock.
How do you score 5 in 1 basketball play? I guess you could make a 3, get fouled, miss the free throw, get the rebound, and score 2. But this isn't a 5 point play, it is a 3 and 2 point play. 7:03
I'm surprised 8-7 has never happened
Some kicker,maybe Tucker, this year suggested 1 point for kicking the ball through the uprights on a kickoff.Â  So there may actually be hope for 1-0 after all!!

Amazing video's Jon. Keep em coming.
2016 Week 14 TBvsNO got close. With 16-11 Tampa lead late, Bucs had the Saints deep in their endzone, forcing Brees to hurry a pass. Didn't quite get the sack, which would have gave us 18-11, and if it held (as 16-11 held with no safety) would have had a scorigami. But no dice...16-11 only happened previously in 2014 Week 15 NYJvsTEN -- and now its twice in 2 years
Bucs and saints on scoragomi alert
Ennui pretty much describes what it's like to be a Bears fan.
As a statistician, I'm not sure about your probabilities for figure 7; you can only multiply probabilities like that if the chance of each thing happening is independent, so the probability of one thing happening doesn't affect the probability of the other thing happening, so you can multiply the probability of a die landing on 6 and a coin landing on heads, but you shouldn't multiply the probability of one person in a family having a genetic disease by the probability of their sister having it, because if one of them has it the other is more likely to. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about the rules of football, but I'd suspect that a team who gets two two-point safeties is likely to not be very good, so they're more likely to be shut out, but then if both teams get two safeties, neither are likely to be very good, so a scoreless overtime is more likely... Your numbers probably aren't far off, but the calculations aren't particularly rigorous.
If Jon ever made another episode on NBA y2k, he could do an episode on breaking the record for lowest scoring game by having the final score to be 1-0. How? Bump all the player's attributes to 0, but keep Jon's players free throw at 100 and the AI's draw foul attribute to 100. Make one free-throw and miss them all, and that's it
I wish there was more dark scorigami tbh. It's cool, and kind of scary. I hope the NFL makes weird rules that give teams like 100 points for something stupid. god I love the Chart Party music
If you like high scoring games so much, watch either college or arena. The NFL is at its best when it's lower close scores.
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
this had better be the only jon bois video exclusively posted on this channel, or I am in for a long night
If the Seahawks ever have the ball near their endzone at the end of a game up by 3+, after giving up a safety (say holding in the endzone, this'll happen with their Oline), you know what Pete is gonna instruct Jon Ryan to do
i dont know anything about american football, why did i watch this
Unbelievably awesome video. In-depth, well paced, and interesting throughout. A tour de force of NFL scoring. 10/10 would watch again.
Damn SB Nation great video, cool mix of history and wacky stats. Honestly you guys deserve so many more views and subs, because no one is making videos like this. Also I bet the research for this episode was a nightmare, keep it up!!!
wtf did i just watch
Hey jon, when you are calculating the odds of a 4-4 game and you consider the offense being shut out, how are you accounting for other defensive scores, like a pick 6 or fumble return TD.... (or dare I say a 3rd safety, but let's not go there)?
The ground rule safety at 3:30 was weird as hell
This video was incredibly well put together and inspiring. I'll be taking notes.
Isn't blocking an extra point and returning it for a TD worth one point?
I really want to know why the teams were terrible at the beginning?
jon bois is back, he is my favorite filmmaker
6-1 would probably only happen with a team deciding to do something weird. I don't know, last play of game, scoreless, team scores TD (why not a FG? I don't know, I'm making this scenario up). They get the snap for the PAT, and run it back all the way, intentionally taking the 1 point safety. It's not likely, but it's more likely than it happening by chance
Also Jon by adding the rogue you could get a 1-0 game
Excellent video!
i love this
This is so retarded .... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have to ask: Where's the updated Scorigami chart in picture form so we can play along? Last one on SB Nation was posted back in 2012.
Another Seahawks Scorigami two weeks ago: the 5-13 vs. the Bucs
Once again, absolutely brilliant.
Now, do scorigami college football. That would be hell considering how many college games have been played, but it would be cool
chiefs - falcons week 13 2016 ending in a pick 2
Pretty good.
This was great
I'm waiting for the day of an 0-0-16  season by every team... what would happen?
Jon, you blow me away every time with your videos. May I ask how long it took you to do this one? Thanks for the content. You have a huge future ahead of you.
I hate to say it but I believe you guys are wrong about the ability to score 1 point. I believe the rule is that if you get a safety on a 2 point conversion or a extra point attempt then it awards the team who got the safety with 1 point. Rule 11-3-2-c. "If a try results in what would ordinarily be a safety against either team, one point is awarded to the opponent.
Don't underestimate the masochism of bears fans
Very cool
9:14 that's the wrong piece!
What about the 10-4 score you have marked on your board?
Pretty much 6-1 is gonna happen when the next Leon Lett enters the league
your voice could put David Blaine to sleep.
this is pretty good
It could be worse for them.
"Funny thing is they did get rid of that derp coach, told Apple to fuck off, DRC is retired and they drafted Barkley.

Oh wait Eli Manning is still there, the o-line is fucking terrible and OBJ is still being a fucking idiot.

Crazy."
Another season, and still 1-7
I'm a giants fan and I agree. derp derp derp
"As a giants fan, this video is pretty funny until I remember that the other teams I like are the Mets, Knicks, and Rangers.

Why does god punish me like this?"
And now Dirpman is Old Man Dirpman, they are in the middle of a fire sale of anything valuable, looks like      they took a page from Sam Hinkie's playbook. TIME TO REV UP THE TANKS G-MEN!!!!!!!!
I just give up on eli and the rest of the derps
Even tho they good
Do the patriots
There goes Eli............... Apple
At least they got Saquon Barkely FivePointsVids! Does that help any? There 1-6 :/
You know what, he did call what happened in the end
Barkley is great but no money after paying that headcase WR.
dat Saquon Barkley predict tho
Wow made about a year ago and still super relevant.
My parents are huge Giants fans.  I should send this to them. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Not as bad as the Jets.
Don't care have superbowls
Another example of the NFL's continued decline, NBC's refusal to broadcast Sunday Night games featuring 2 teams that aren't Dallas and/or the Giants.
2018-19 looks like more of the same, at least we can stat pad Saquon to OROY by just throwing checkdowns to him every other play and ask him to fix everything. Just keep dirping just keep dirping (dirp, dirp, dirpidy, dirp, dirp, dirp)
Canâ€™t what to see the comments of giants fans saying they won 2 Super Bowls against the Pats (I havenâ€™t looked at the comments)
Crazy that he called Giants picking Saquon Barkley
New York sports teams suck
I died when he said "OH LOOKS ITS ERIC FLOWERS"
"5:36 to end, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened.

Minus the bring back Tom Coughlin."
As a Giants fan, this is one of the funniest videos I have ever fucking seen. Brilliant!
0 playoff wins in 16 of the last 18 seasons lol
I mean, it was a good Rudyard Kipling poem.
Derp
The Atlanta Falcons: A legacy of Failure
I never thought I'd see the Giants suck and the Eagles win a superbowl
Why did u show the 9/11 building on fire seriously dude!
They just got saquon Barkley so their running game might be good this year ðŸ‘€
Ouch I heard you 5Point
"Slogans for these New York Teams:

New York Giants - ""At least were not the Jets...""

New York Jets - ""At least were not the Mets...""

New York Mets - ""At least were not the Knicks...""

New York Knicks - ""At least we got Porzingas...""

Porzingas - ""Get me out of this shit hole of a organization...""

James Dolan - ""Porzingas will retire as a Knick. Mark my words boys."""
"â€œThat is, of course, if we donâ€™t waste our first round pick on Saquon Barkley...â€
the New York Giants draft Saquon Barkey
Curb Your Enthusiasm theme starts playing"
I still can't understand why he would sell fake game memorabilia. Obviously he didn't need the money. So much derp.
About that Barkley pick.....
I am a Giants fan, this is my story...
Philip Rivers is a much better QB than Eli.
the best part is they actually drafted barkley
that New England prep school comment had me rolling cause there was a running joke at my middle school (Massachusetts) that the gym teacher was in fact a pedophile; it's a very accurate stereotype apparently :)
Well they now have Barkley
Love the ending, God I never get tired of seeing that.  Hope the trip to Miami was worth it for Obj & co.
You could just push Eli very light and heâ€™ll fall over
3:35 could someone get me a link to that clip?
Ha! Ha! Itâ€™s funny because the Giants got rid of McAdoo, and did get Saquon Barkley.
1:23 I had heard of Shaun Draughn before this so jokes on you lol
2:15 hahaha
Well they ended up getting Barkley
I can say without sarcasm that this video aged well, at least up to July 2018
Ben McAdoo kinda looks like Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
"anÂ·yÂ·more
ËŒenÄ“ËˆmÃ´r/Submit
adverb
to any further extent; any longer."
shoot eli apple :)))))))))) lol
im a Giants  fan  and  this is unarguable
I h8 the giants
3:50 I was dying right there
title made me laugh so hard
GENO SMITH!
Just came back to this. You guys did get saquan and that's the sad thing
It's funny because they drafted Barkley...
5:56 the weird thing is, I think they did all those things
Do the Buccaneers
This why I love the Giants. Because the team is a lolcow it makes them more like underdogs
Coming back to watch this and of course they drafted Barkley.
Bet fivepoints loved this
At least mcadoo is gone
"1:02  I was at that game
Fly eagles fly"
And then they actually drafted Barkley.
Well, the Giants drafted Barkley...
bro you used the fucking derp song in 2017 any opinion you have is invalid
"Hey guess what FivePoints. Your dream came true. Barkley is drafted.

And the NFC East is now slightly spooked."
Derp derp
Idc if the giants have more superbowls, the eagles own the giants
As a Dallas Cowboys fan it gave me great joy to watch that team die the slow and agonizing death it deserved
Ummmmm â€œall three fingers of JPP.â€ Weâ€™ll say goodbye to that. Hahahahahah!
derp, derp, derp-derp-dee-derp, herp sherpeh-dee derp
https://youtu.be/nQB4nAjZIdE
If Beckham gets traded I expect a full fucking screaming roast. Anything less than that and I unsub
Go die
Well all three fingers of JPP are now in Tampa.
MetLife stadium home of the derp and a butt fumble lol
GENO SMITH
The Giants are basically the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFC. Hate 'em both
Odell Beckham Jr. is "just a sliver less of a diva" than Antonio Brown. How's that looking now?
All three fingers of Jason Pierre Paul lmao
Well, at least Mcadoo and Reese are finally gone. They simply didn't work or get along with others.
Became a semi giants fan when 18-1 happened, then realized they're basically shit and went for Steelers
"Built on all 3 fingers of Jason Pierre Paul" WOW. JUST WOW.
Only good team in NY is the Yankees and sometimes the rangers, but thatâ€™s it...
Iâ€™m a giants fan from birth and we are a fucking derp lol
ITS JOHNNNNNNY FOOTBALL!!!!
Why the fuck do you bench Eli...
Shit dude good thing we have Dave gettleman and pat shurmur now
Ben McAdoo: The Ultimate Derp
I remember when someone named "Paul Perkins" was a brilliant steal in fantasy drafts.
Ben Macado is a fucking child molestor
Giants: We're having offensive problems right now. But, we have a solution. Let's start Geno Smith! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"Giants sure fire to win nfc east?

Look how that turned out"
Shit made me laughing so hard LMAO
At least I got my Devils
Just draft Barkley
2:18 i wasdying i love this video
"Derp, derpety derp derp derp derp derp, derp, derpety derp........







DERP"
That's my Giants.ðŸ˜”
3:11 ðŸ˜‚ Sad but true
I'm a  giants fan and this shit is hilarious
Good riddance to McAdoo...doo.
"on behalf of all giants fans,

derp"
I cringe so hard every time I hear that bone breaking sound effect.
Giants need to resign Michael Strahan, David Tyree and maybe Brandon Jacobs
Being a giants fan I fucking love this!!!
THE DERP ERA
Did the patriots lose 2 or 1 super bowl
"All 3 fingers of Jason Pierre-Paul" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
A good pick was Evan Engram
Painfully accurate... Let's just be glad this isn't about history of the franchise
2:59 gotta hurt for Giants fans. The whole receiving core died in one week. Thatâ€™s impressive.
Not a lolcow yet, but theyre trying
amazing how its always bradys 'fault' if a team with no Ol-defense-and -or recievers 'only' gets to the afc title game but eli manming can have his fucking team of high talent fucking quit in week one and its not his fault?
'remember when he was fucking terrible and the giants faithful nearly ran him out of town?' so u mean every year not ned 2007 or 2011?
Ben Mcadoo sex offender profile LMfao haahaha
I'm a Cowboys fan and I want to watch the Cowboys one!
fuck you spanos!
Sad season for us. But honestly, not too far off from a playoff team. Minus the injuries, some good coaching, and a decent draft class we could be a contender again in a few years. Need to get better on both lines
As a Giants fan, I fully endorse this video.
He doesnâ€™t get a pass from the memorabilia thing for winning 2 Super Bowls. He gets a pass for his Walter Payton MOTY award.
This is great u and 5points are hilarious my two favorite sports YouTubers â€œjust look at all that speedâ€
Maybe Evan Engram
Good Picks over last 3 years: So far Landon Collins and Sterling Shepard
I'm a die hard giants fan and I was waiting excitedly for this video XDDD Im dying
4:13 Evan Engram
Fivepointvids cameo! Yay!
I'm a patriots fan and if I see a pats video from this guy I'm gonna luagh and click and lie the video
well you got gettleman back so the futures bright
3-13...welp shit
Jets lose to the Giants and say they lost due to no home advantage
A friend of mine has had season tickets for a decade and has never left during a game and has gone to a few road game
Does anyone know what song is in the background
I knew this vid was coming when we lost to the chargers
Cleveland Browns, The History of Sadness
ben mcadoo is the worst coach ever
i like to think that ben mcadoo got fired because the owner of the giants watched this video
At least we're not 0-16 cough cough Browns cough cough lions cough cough.
So much derp, I love it.
I think the Giants haven't been that bad
Eli got benche for Geno Smith...he could make a vid only about that
You canâ€™t have Tom. Heâ€™s in Florida, heâ€™s old. Thatâ€™s like asking peanut butter to go on without jelly.
As a giants fan I agree with this video 100% and hey at least we took steps in the right direction by firing mcadoo and our gm
oof
Umm, Jerry Reese is gone, but McAdoo is gone so it's ok.
Hey at least They decided to try and clean house by firing Ben McAdoo and the bumbling idiot they call a GM... too bad they broke Eli's streak to start GENO FUCKING SMITH
McAdoo got fired. Wonder if this'll be included in the next video UT makes.
A pigfaced clown. The derp master. The luckiest qb in nfl history.
Chicago Bulls: Professional Basketball's Slaughterhouse
Jerry Reese and Ben McaDerp are gone now
"After last Sunday, expect Mr. Doo to be ""adopted"" to a nice family farm where he will run free.

Don't ask about the 2 shell casings on the floor."
"When he's not openly abusing kicking nets he's demanding to be paid all of the money"
The hammer dropped as both GM J. Reese and Coach McAdoo were relieved of their duties approx. 231pm Monday 12/4/17.
They finally fired Mcadoo
Well this video is already irrelevant,   guess the Giants saw this
Who the fuck is Eli Apple?
RIP Ben McAderp. Fired today.
Mcadoo and reese fired
And now everyone in New York is sighing in relief.
Derp, derp, derp,derp,de-derp.
and now they bench Eli... RIP there playoff chances
This was strangely predictive.
lol they got worse
I still am upset that the Giants had to snap the Patriots' undefeated streak. I mean... had the Patriots won, they would have made history but no. :(
Imagine how this would look if he made it now compared to two weeks ago?
3:41, rings so true
1:01 how prophetic you were, UT
You forgot the time they blew a 21 point lead with 7 minutes
Can you d the Lions next?
When will there be a lowcow video of the Miami Marlins?
After the Eli benching, you need to get Ben MacCadoo is own lolcow video
Breaking News: The Giants benched Eli Manning for Geno Smith.
do the Ravens and Dolphins.
And this week we actually have Geno Smith starting.  Good lord.
"You made this video 2 weeks too early
RIP Eli Manning"
They're benching Eli... For Geno Smith ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ fuck you McAdoo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
As a Jets fan this is absolutely beautiful to see. The amount of giants fans that made fun of me are insane. Now you guys are a Lolcow. Welcome to the club motherfuckers!!!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
After Eli's benching today, Giants fans are probably gonna want a "Fuck You McAdoo" every week now.
You should have waited a few weeks to make this video if you had you could have included the Giants benching Manning for Geno.
Iï¸ got the rangers at least
Looks like you should have waited a few weeks to make this.
You should do a video on how bad the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been through out history.Lets not forget that in their first two years of existence(1976 & 1977)they went 0-26 before winning their first game as a franchise.Then when Vinnie Testaverde showed up he couldn't stop throwing interceptions.I know this is only a fraction of what has made the Bucs awful but it's enough to warrant a video ;-)
COLTS LOLCOW WE ARE TERRIBLE, (I am a sad ,sad colts fan)
Do the chiefs! Pro footballâ€™s perpetual let down
Urinatingtree what's your favourite team
Hey Tree, you're the most underrated channels I have ever seen. Hope you get 500k+ in the next few months.
Do the San Jose sharks
Do the Chicago Bulls next.
3:13 LMAO as a giant fan thatâ€™s so fucking true
Do Atlanta Hawks!!!
Still waiting on the Detroit lions.  I know itâ€™s low hanging fruit but sometimes it fun to hit the easy targets.
dont make fun of the giants, they broke down barriers by drafting the only quarter back with all out mental retardation
Please do my cowboys
Do one on my Cowboys since 1996, I love them but they are a train wreck!
We just need the Cowboys to complete the division. And I say they deserve one.
They lost to the niners â€˜Nuff said
They lost to the niners â€˜Nuff said
The Miami Dolphins: Professional Football's Japanese Food
Urinating Tree please make a vid on the flyers they fuckin suck a bag of dicks
I sense a great Derp in the Force ...
I know guys who wear sweat pants and wife beaters/muscle shirts on a regular basis.
But yet the Chiefs managed to lose to them. The Chiefs are super derp.
Do the flyers. Paul holmgren gave you plenty of material, and Ron Hextall might actually make them competent soon. Wouldn't want to miss my team get ripped to shreds for all the sadness and shitty goaltending it's forced down my throat.... FUCK YOU SPANOS
Do eagles legacy of failure
What about the Dallas cowboys?
Do the packers
Los Angeles Clippers: NBAâ€™s sunken ship
We now derped tanking we beat the chiefs kill me now as a giants fan
How the hell have you not done the Detroit Lions?!? I already know the roast of that team would be so unfair it would redefine the term "scorched earth policy"!.
As a cowboys fan this video is awesome
Should have waited a week for them to lose to the 49ers before releasing this
My Redskins stink but I smile when I look at the Giants' record
Do the Miami Marlins Next!
LMFAO yeah the Giants have derped their way through the past decade
OBJ is a way bigger Diva than AB
derp derp derpitty derp derp!
i also feel like the Detroit Lions legacy of failure is long .... overdue
Arizona Cardinals, Tampa Bay Buccs, Houston Texans, and The Miami Dolphins are a couple you could do.
Your sports videos are helping me through my depression.
Ben Macdoo looks better in Madden than real life....
Packers next? I would love see you attempt it.
This video is perfect!!!! i have been requesting this!!!!  MORE DERP JOKES!!! Lol Love it!!!
Where is SportsBall for Week 10?
Alright pissing timber.....it is now time to deconstruct the Arizona Coyotes
I feel like the giants are the Mets of football, whatever good they had on the team (which is very little things) have been hurt and everything else is complete trash.
They fucking lost to the 49ers
Do sports ball
Do I Green Bay one. Ted Thompson needs to be ripped a new asshole and after the way you obliterated Stan Kroenke, I couldnâ€™t think of anybody better for the job.
I'm a New Yorker and I find this utterly hilarious.
Where the fuck is Sportsball: Week 10?!?
Boy, the Browns are unlucky, they don't play the Giants...
As a fellow Pitt Panthers fan, You NEED to make a video about how shitty our attendance is and a video about us losing to damn UNC
Congrats Italy for not making the World Cup.
RIP
I am a Giants fan and this is great. I was thoroughly entertained.
Should do a video on the Cubs.  1 world series win doesn't make up for the other 107 years of failure.
I know you're not really a soccer person, but I feel like you could make an amazing video about the English National Team
Derp.
"49ers: 31

Midgets: 21"
Isn't that song the opening to Carmen San Diego?
And my Niners even beat them lol
At least they didn't go undefeated just to lose in the Superbowl.
Please pick apart my Patriots.
Do one on the College Football Playoff
This week in Sportsball What the Fuck are you doing Ginger Hammer ?? Not to mention the Patriots dismantle the Broncos and the best play of the game for Denver is Brock oswieler nailing a guy in the face with a football
Thank you for that first win, guys. Sincerely, the 49ers. PS: Are you playing the Browns this season?
ROFL Giants lost to 49ers!
Derp
You should do a video on the Toronto Maple Leafs post-1967.
Well Giants, at least your color scheme is pleasant on the eyes. Can't say the same for the Browns(BTdubs, I am a Patriots fan who relishes in the Giants complete and utter incompetence and failure, mainly because they robbed the Pats of 2 Super Bowls and a perfect 19-0 record. You guys would've been spared from the Fins bragging about 17-0 in '72 had we won. Just saying.
Just Fucking fire Mcado please
Do Baltimore Ravens next!
The moment youâ€™re done making that video, my niners finally got a win!!!
"The Cleveland Cavaliers: Pro Basketballâ€™s Championship - Caliber Shitshow

As a native of Pittsburgh, whatâ€™s your opinion on Nate Peterman? I watched him play at pitt, and I think he could be a solid nfl qb if he was given a chance at Buffalo
Do the Bulls.
Holy shit i just realized im wearing an obj shirt
FivePointsVids yes!
Really liked the spongebob music on mcaBoo
And how did this guy beat Tom Brady twice in the SB again?
Dear eagles fans before you start talking shit remember 4 is better then 0
My name is also Eli. So this vid was fun
Who would have thought that the Giants would even lose to the 49ers?
And a day later this video got uploaded, the 49ers got their 1st win of the 2017 NFL season.
How do you lose to the fucking 49ners ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Š
My dadâ€™s an old pro... heâ€™s been putting up with the derp since the 1958 NFL Championship Game. Not much has changed in the past 60 years. Honestly, if the Giants hadnâ€™t played the Patriots both times, I wish they lost both Super Bowls. No mediocrity is more painful than the one induced by a couple of championships. Itâ€™s why Jerry Reese still has a job in spite of drafting like shit.
"Fuck you Spanos!
Your Chargers has just killed the Giant's season!"
Do one on the bucs? They overall deserve it.
What a good looking ending
When are you going to do the Saints. We all know that there is a lot to say about them over their history.
Are we a lolcow now?
I feel like you made this a couple days too early...
You should do the San Jose Sharks
5:07 - shove bamboo underneath it fingernails? wtf? I've never heard that expression before in my life... or did u just make that up on the spot? If u did, wtf is it supposed to mean? I'm guessing it trying to say it hurts but wtf is going thru ur mind that u associate pain with having bamboo being shoved underneath ur fingernails?... n here I thought that I had a messed up head but u DEFINITELY take the cake in this one, without a doubt in my mind!
If only you had waited for them to lose to the 49ers lol
Did you reference the "Hunger Death?"
Geno Smith is god
Spanos is the reason they lost to the 49ers. FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Where is sportsball?
"I love the crossover, didn't see that coming but it was hilarious
also, now do the cowboys to finish off the NFC east"
UrinatingTree, if you are preparing for a Lolcow video for my Texans, reply to this so I can give you every talking point for you to exploit.
It's 2017 quit with the 2013 memes
Now, they got all but routed by the 49ers, who last beat a team not named the Rams in 2015. I think the intentional tank may be in order...
Ab>>>obj
"They just lost to the 49ers.

Wow."
May you forever have material to work with... I fucking LOVE this channel! Keep up the great work!
Damn itâ€™s like all our teams suck. Iâ€™m a Jets Mets Rangers Knicks fan. Pray for me
Funny cuz they lost to the fucking 49ers
The voiceover is almost good, it's slightly unfunny though.  I learned a lot, though!   The second guy is definitely funnier, but I appreciate the original content, guys!!!  Love to see some new shit
I came straight here after the Giants loss to the Niners
Please do us all a favor andÂ don't waste the careers ofÂ Landon Collins andÂ Paul Perkins.
And now they lost to a team that was winless.
Fucking damn it, this video was too early, the just lost to the 49ers... LMAO
THEY LOST TO THE FUCKING SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS
FivePoints!
Wow look at all of those glorious V I E W S
I fucking love you man!
nobody knows the pain of being  a giants fan it fucking sucks
And they just lost to the 49ers. They're so bad, it's almost not funny anymore. (key word: Almost)
1-8! We're unstoppable! Honestly though, watch us get a shitty player in the draft. Thanks, Jerry Reese!

Sad thing is, I'm a Giants fan and I agree with most of, if not all of this.
Where is week 10 sportsball?
They derp so hard they do not even know what state they play in. ðŸ¤¥

NOOOO TOO SOON URINATING TREE. MY GIANTS :(
Least I got kristaps and the knicks for a seasonâ€¦ LET THE TANK TRAIN BEGIN!
Atlanta Thrashers/ current Winnipeg Jets for the next lolcow
That Derp song though.
"Yeah, the Giants have been bad this year, but this is still a team that won a championship in, what, the last five years?

I still eagerly await a Cowboys video."
The Giants are the shame of all of New York City. We were doing pretty well and it all just collapsed. Something monumental needs to happen, or the giants will be the laughing stock of the NFL for the next decade.
Do a lolcow on the Tennessee Volunteers... 10 years of dumpster fire content to dissect.
Do a video on the Phoenix Suns
We need a Toronto Blue Jays lolcow
Do haters guide to 2017 -2018 college football Bowles when they come out
Do a re due if the Cleveland Browns expect call then professional footballs brown note
Only clicked cuz packers
In my scratching NYG fan ego: Sure, we won four Super Bowl titles, but it's once per decade for four straight decades. We can't make a dynasty.
I just hope the giants get a good draft pick.
You only won 2 super bowls in the last 10 years take it easy motherfuckers. I'm a Packers fan and shareholder and you guys turn on motherfuckers too fast, it's called loyalty.
You earned yourself a dislike
Shut up, at least we have four super bowls.
Holy shit bringing in 5Points made this video 200x funnier
I think Pekka Rinne was too good last night

Why do the giants suck so much this year? :(
Reminds me of penguinz0/critikal, but still a great video
Ben McADerp
I mix of UrinatingTree and FivePointVids? Am I in heaven?
Well, it could be worse... you could be the browns.
Donâ€™t let this distract you that Eli Manning will be the only QB to beat Tom Brady The GOAT twice in the Super Bowl.
4:20 that hit makes me cry
Its funny because the Green Bay Packers have had 2 back to back HOF QBs in Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers and have 2 super bowls to show for it total. Eli Manning has 2 super bowls to show for his time in New York. Giants are as good as Packers confirmed
Well now that youâ€™ve gone after the giants, it would only be fitting if you went after another 4 Super Bowl franchise - the Packers and how theyâ€™ve been holding back Aaron Rodgers (at least recently)
as a giants fan thank u
LOL WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM I EVEN SAID IS HE A SEX OFFENDER! ðŸ˜‚
This is comedy gold HA HA HA HA #GoCowboys #WeDemBoyz

"Five Points Vids, you do realize that Barkley is a running back from Penn State, right?
Honestly the Giants should just try to trade the #3 pick to the bears and see what happens"

OOOOHHHH FUN A COLAB! you really are becoming a full grown tree arent you?
Do the Bucs man

I'm sorry but Odell Beckham isn't close to Antonio Brown... AB is far better than that ramen head ass
No one mentioned who the two legends of urinating tree and five points gaming made a collab for this gem?
Okay I love your videos & I donâ€™t mind you trashing my Giants but itâ€™s Ben & Our GMs fault Eli is the only one trying with nothing around him
Colts should be the next lolcow.
"Wait.... Tree AND 5 POINTS...? IN 1 VIDEO?! IS THIS REAL LIFE?

Life is good sometimes"
It would be sad if Barkley's career was wasted in New York. Dude has some talent.
eli is almost gone, beckam wants to be the highest paid in the enitre league, and mcadoo hasn't worked out.  have fun giants fans.
The Giants might suck huge cock but they still wake Tom Brady up at night in a cold sweat.
what's with great youtubers shilling for shitty youtubers lately?
I'm so mad but this is so true
Don't forget about the big Week 10 game against San Fransisco
Bro whereâ€™s the Buccaneers Lolcow, too easy?
Timberwolves suck.
My god tree and five points gaming I can die happy now
I don't care for hand-egg, I just enjoy your ranting. :)
As an eagles fan I enjoyed this... But my franchise is also a derp
I hate the second guys voice so fuckin much
The depression has consumed my body. All I know is pain.
Do the Baltimore ravens
Do the lions
But we have obj and 2 Super Bowls
But we have obj and 2 Super Bowls
But we have obj and to Super Bowls
Do the Toronto Maple Leafs.
PLEASE DO JERRY JONES AND/OR DALLAS COWBOYS LOLCOW
as a patriots fan this video is awesome.
Yes. Fpg!
5 Star and Urinatingtree... my world has imploded in an instance...
FUCKAAA UUUUUUUUUU, Â  McADOOOOOOOO
Hey look a colab with Five Point Vids!
I knew this was coming but shit. Still love my team tho
Do the Atlanta hawks
Pretty lame
When are you going to do a video on the Detroit Lions?
Can we get a big 12 refs lolcow?
As a giants fan i was so anticipated for this video and i love it. So true in every single way. Jerry Reese and Ben Mcadoo fucked up a possible super bowl contender. We went from contender to lolcow faster then you could say Desean Jackson.
"Read ""the draw play"" 
It's a comic by the most depressed Giants fan ever"
Itâ€™s just an odd year.
Is Pekka Rinne still too good now?
Iâ€™m a giants fan and this season is just disappointing if we lose to the niners tomorrow I will become a jets fan for the rest of the season
...And the Broncos lost to this team
I saw this coming
My favorite line in regards to the New Jersey Giants stated in an earlier video was that the Giants have a Giant Horseshoe stuffed up their ass.
I don't care much about the Giants, I'm more shocked that the Eagles made a 61-yard field goal.
fuck me its mcadoos fault, we got the yanks knicks and rangers at least
Only the NYJ would let the NYG Unintentionally, "Trust The Process" and recoup draft picks & lose QB B. Mayfield/ S. Darnold or J. Rosen for 2018. Smh. S. Barkley from Pedophile State could be another K. Carter or C. Enis, not a sure bet from PSU.
I am not a Giants fan, but lets be real here. This video would not have been made if they were not 1-7. Not if they were like 3-5, this still would not have been made.
giants fan here... knew i was only a matter of time....
Tree, you got to do a video on Hollywood. That's a lolcow content for sure.
â€œA random running back no one has ever heard of.â€ Hey, Iâ€™ve heard of him before. He used to play at UNC. I loved watching Shaun Draughn play. That being said, he really hasnâ€™t done much in the NFL.
can you do a lolcow on the Detroit lion
Ben mcadoo need to be fired ASAP
As a fan of Big Blue, I can REALLY RELATE to this team
Great use of the cassette robot lol
Watching people shit on the Giants is actually kind of cathartic. Embrace the tank and hope Mara puts Macadoodoo's head on a pike in front of MetLife.

5 point vids!
"I like how you roped in a Giants fan to give his opinion on how much of a derp his team is. Maybe you can do more of this in future videos?

As for suggestions, if you are really game for a big one, how about the big commish himself? After a decade, his tenure has ""lolcow"" written all over it, and he's probably the biggest one in all of football, even bigger than the Browns in my opinion."
Broncos NFL's Snowy lolcow
Don't worry Giants fans, you have your 4 Super Bowl rings and you didn't pass on Carson Wentz.
As a giants fan I was waiting for this for so long
Where my Eagles fans at? #8-1
Ben McAdoo puts ketchup on rare steak.
Tom Coughlin is the only reason this team has won anything.
2 favorite football youtubers in 1 video!
Loved the collab. Been subbed to both of you for awhile now. Keep up the fantastic work!
urinating tree can you please roast the Miami dolphins because I'm done with them and maybe do the marlins to
At least spanos trade Eli to the Giants
FivePoints Vids!
I'm a Jets fan so I don't have to deal with the other New York team (even if the Jets Buttfumbles aren't that big of an upgrade at least we are no Giants)
Damn this is gonna hella shut up the Giants fans
Keep hope alive
Hey take your lumps
At least he didnt call us a lolcow...
That New England Phys Ed teacher joke is so true.
You finally made a video about one of my teams and I'm scared to watch
Well the Yankees and Knicks seem like theyâ€™re crawling out of the basement so itâ€™s only fitting that the Giants have to go back in
They still got the Yankees
Everyone should have seen this coming. They are the mecca of bad decisions. They paid WAY TOO MUCH for Jenkins and several other players and they've been the most unlucky team this year, losing pretty  much ever key player on offense...what little they have to start with. Its a Browns like dumpster fire.
Hey UrinatingTree, big fan. Wanna sub 4 sub?
yes
yes five point gaming and urinating tree in the same video less
Finally the day has come were my Giants get a video on this channel
The only ny team without a lolcow is not the rangy
I'll take derp-Ing to 2 titles. At least we're not the Browns.....or Bills.....or Chargers.....or Falcons.....anywua, you get what I'm saying
DRAFT LUKE FALK HE IS THE BEST IN COLLEGE FUCKING FOOTBALL
Derp. I should I have seen this video coming.
This.
As a chargers fan I'm glad we don't have this guy at QB.
how tf did that shit franchise beat the Pats twice?
All he needs now is excuses to rip into the NY Rangers and the NY Yankees and the Urinating Tree New York Circle of Mockery is complete
Fuck Aaron Rodgers.
G E N O S M I T H
Support me
Haha new england prep school! Lol
I will still wear my giants hat proudly
Haha FivePoints :)
How the fuck did this team beat undef. New england. Bullshit. Refs were bought
Giants and Mets fan... it's been painful.
God damnit i was so pissed when ben blamed eli manning for them being shit. Seriously he sounded like half the giants fanbase from 2012-2016
Derp!
Yeah, the Giants suck right now, but they're the only reason Pats fans aren't throwing seven Lombardi trophies in our faces right now instead of five.
Do the tampa bay buccaneers
"shoot eli apple" holy fuck my sides
Iâ€™ll stay a giants fan no matter what
In my opinion Saquon Barkley has 49ers written all over him
Itâ€™s all good the giants are one of if not the best NFL franchises ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ definitely top 5
As a Patriots fan, I can't even describe the joy I feel looking at the Giants these days. Fuck you, Spanos!
I still don't know how Rodgers completed that pass to Cobb against the Giants last year ðŸ˜©
That Aaron Rodgers hail mary at the end of the video was icing on the cake

when fivepoint vids started talking i nutted everywhere
Yeah I'll admit it, my Giants suck
I know you hate the steelers, but there is no way you can think that Odell Beckham is objectively less of a diva than Antonio Brown.  Like, really?  Odell Beckham IS the modern day measuring stick of divas.
You forgot to say fuck you spanos
as a giants fan im ready to watch this
I can't say I didn't see this coming.
"Who the fuck was that guy talking at the end pf the video? He fucking sucked. 

He better never appear in another video or I'm done. Disliked."
Do my cowboys next
How the fuck is Eli Manning overrated? Nobody thinks or says he's elite. Has anybody heard how he's talked about by NFL analysts. He's not overrated
#24  the 3rd and 33 didn't even try
OBJ is way more of a diva than AB.
You giants fans are really idiotic. "Fire him...fire that"...."draft him...sign him". After one loss it's like a meltdown and you want to restart the whole organization. You have no idea how to run a team.
I got so hyped when I heard my boy five points
From this Dolphins fan, Eli will forever be in my Hall of Fame. He saved the ONE thing we Phins fan have to brag about. The Perfect season. Thank u Eli for derping ur ass into 2 Super Bowl wins against   the bane of every football fans existence.  PS Tom Brady sucks ðŸ˜œ
lol I'm thank god im a New York sports fan except for football. Now I will cry myself to sleep cause I chose to support the fucking Dolphins
do a lolcow vid on the Bulls
The Derp Song!
Maybe the reason they're called the Giants is because management has their collective heads in the clouds.
Barkley going to SF
As a giants fan this was so funny esp the erick flowers dis and the 7th grade mcadoodoo reference all three fingers wow jpp
Do the bucs
RIP Roy Holliday. One of the greatest pitchers of our era, gone. Just like that. You wil be missed, old friend.
When you try to be the capitals in the playoffs..........
"Barkley sucks
If you watched the game today he only had 35 yards rushing and people says he is a heisman candidate this year"
Hehe Yankees are the kings now. Aaron Judge is the face of NY now, move over Odell
Fuck you Spanos
Ben McAdoo is like what happens if you let an uber fan of the Giants coach the team.
As a giants fan all I can do is sigh.
I am a Miami Dolphins fan and I to ask when are you going to do the Dolphins. I mean we never shut up about the perfect season. We haven't had a QB since Dan Marino. I am big Miami Dolphin fan but the Dolphins are a lolcow.
As a Giants fan, I knew this day was coming. I shall revel in it.
Do one on the Utah Jazz next
When you're such a fan of Urinating tree that you actually checked out his his shit to come across his guest BEFORE he put in his guest to talk shit bout a team that both HE AND the guest support.
I am a Giants fan and I loved this are team is complete shit
â€œFirebend Mcadooâ€
"I see a lot of parallels between the Giants of New York and the Giants of San Francisco.Â 
Both teams have periods where the stars aline and everything works out for them and the next year they run afoul of some demon and are cursed. Then they win a world title, lose their star player to injury, get a top player in the draft, and on and on the endless cycle goes. But unlike SanFran, these guys have a cross-eyed woodchuck throwing the ball for them."

Giants suck suck suck
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ best vid ever
How is OBJ less of a diva than AB?
oh i've been waiting for this for a long time. i hate myself for being a fan of this team right now
OH HELL NO!! SAQUON BARKLEY WILL NOT GO TO THE GIANTS!  He might end up in San Francisco or end up in Cleveland
at least we beat the pats in the SB, TWICE

At least we have 2007 and 2011
Do one on the Green Bay Packers
For the first time in a long time it looks like em Buffalo Bills will be your new NFL New York State champions. Congrats Buffalo you did it

As an Eagles fan I've really been looking forward to thisðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
I'd take 2 superbowls that i can remember in exchange for a couple crappy seasons, they still have a strong core, they'll be back soon.
dilly dilly, to the pit of misery giants fans
Are you making a LA Clippers LOLCOW??
Please do the Bulls, Clippers, or Suns
Nothing like coming home from a 12 hour work day to watch a video from my fav youtuber pissingshrub
As a patriots fan I'm happy to say FUCK THE GIANTS
Worst than the 49ers!
2:14 UT, you slayed me yet again.
Please do something on the Mariners
The kicker forgot his wife wasn't a football.
I donâ€™t care who the running back is. No RB can do anything behind that o line
Do seahawks
Please make a video about the Packers
Fuck you Spanos.
As a Giants fan, I thank you for making this video
If only Aaron Judge played football too........
Could you do one with the Indians or the tigers
Finally you did my giants. #KnicksTape
A whole roast dedicated to the Giants
this video didnâ€™t make me feel to good about my team, but the Aaron Rodgers throw just made me feel that much worse
Omg they finally have a LolCow lmaooooooooðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ coming from a cowboys fan this is just amazingðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚â˜ðŸ»â˜ðŸ»ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Hey UT, please do a Detroit Lions one, you'll have sub's dying from laughing at the shit storm they are
Fuck ny. Enjoy your shit season(S)ðŸ˜€
Their one win came from a team with a shitty coaching staff and no offense
No amount of Giants losing can quench my thirst. No amount of football misery can sate my hate for them.
Huge Giants fan here was waiting for you to make this for a long time. Its all accurate I am not looking forward to the next few years at all unless our offensive line magically becomes god tier.
Barkley won't be able to run if the o-line are traffic cones
As a redskins fan this relieves me but when is DC the legacy of choke dropping
I thought there is gonna be one "Fuck U Spanos" in this video
Nothing about this is Eli's fault.  Yeah, he's played sloppy at times, but literally everything is on his shoulders, and that's not the kind of quarterback he is.  He is someone who is a great piece to have with a team that's decent around him, who can definitely do his part but isn't good enough to carry the entire team.  Eli and a decent defense is all this team has anymore.
Do broncos "A Dumb load of shit"
Say what you will about the Giants, but they beat a perfect New England team in Super Bowl XLII; then again a few years later with just a 9-7 record.  It's not like they got intercepted on the 1 yard line in the 4th quarter with the game on the line, or gave up a 20+ point lead or anything.
Shitting on both Giants in one year? Your criticism spans both sides of the country.
Finally you made fun of us
Iâ€™ve waited a whole year for this
When will we get a legacy of failure on the entire city of Detroit?
is that KTO?
you know what ben's problem is,he's too busy trying to doodo in the poor children he's secretly raped mouths rather than trying to make his reputation less deplorable than chip kelly rich kotite combined
Tampa bay buccaneers: professional footballs sinking ship

I want UT to rip the Blackhawks cause theyâ€™re sucking right now, but I donâ€™t know his qualifications to make a video ripping a team.
YES!
he said wife beater lmao, Lets not forget Josh Brown beat his wife and got suspended one game
Do a leagcy of failure UK Football, we lost Bear Bryant to Alabama because we wouldn't give him raise after winning a Championship and we've been medicore ever since
Iâ€™m a Giants fan and this is so fucking true Iâ€™m dying right now
5 points and Urinating tree in the same vid? Am I in heaven
When January comes around, I want the Post, The News, and/or Newsday to have the back cover simply say, "The Blue Wedding."
I find the timing of you dropping this video a little bit puzzling since the Giants are about to play the 0-9 49ers tomorrow. If the 49ers end up getting their first win against the Giants, that could have been something else you could use in a Giant lolcow video.
2 superbowls in the last decade
MMMMMMM this is like porn for cowboys fans :D
Yeah... four championship team you're mocking. Pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Nice try, UrinatingTree.
ELI APPLe is good! He's been guarding the best WRs pretty well so far
You haven't riffed my team the Broncos yet... They're having a Lolcow season right now. Even lost badly to the dumpster fire Giants.
4:44 ahahahahaha i fucking love that movie its so funny
Hahaha don't worry New York at least we have the Rangers!!!!!!
As a Giants fan, this was hilarious. You have a great channel. Just looking forward to the draft now.
You know itâ€™s bad when your kicker is a wife beater ðŸ˜‚
Damn I thought my giants were off the hook cuz of injurys rip
Omg he listened to my comment
Do the Fucking Penguins Pharisee
Oh a Giants video. I was afraid of this. Please excuse me as I slit my wrist
I liked the vid before even watching it. It was worth it. Now all u need is Dallas lolcow vid.
The 19 people that disliked this video are the 19 remaining giants fans left after this atrocious year.
Hey, at least Evan Engram looks promising
Giants may suck now but eagles still got no rings
Please save us
I want a lolcow/garbage fire for the Whitesox.
This is literally revenge from the Pats losing to Super Bowl 42 10 years ago. Iâ€™m weeping tears of joy from your video. As always FUCK YOU SPANOS!
The 9ers will beat them tomorrow ahahahahahahaah
They need Landry Jones as there QB
Do the Broncos!!!
"This man is a pair of sweatpants and a wife beater away from being a 7th grade Phys Ed teacher at a New England prep school." HOW does he come up with these analogies?
Odell is the diva of divas.
Make a Dolphins lolcow. I sacrificed my Sundays to watch this team fail. :)
I'm not feeling sorry for him. After two lucky catches that robbed Tom Brady, I have no more sympathy.
Somehow I knew this was coming. My team soiled
It hurts to be a giants fan.
You know it's a bad day when urinating tree posts a video.. and your favourite team is in the thumbnail
Iï¸ was waiting for this video, FUCK MACADOO
"as a giants fan.Â 

thank you for making me even more sad. after not knowing we could've had Todd gurley but fucking drafted erect flowers.

But I still love your videos."
Regardless of the content of the specific poem, I don't know if Rudyard Kipling, author of "The White Man's Burden," is the best poet to motivate a contemporary NFL football team.
Fuck you, Spanos.
do colts lolcow or nl east lolcow division
Iâ€™m a giants fan and Iâ€™ll even admit this is a horrible team, at least I got my other favorite team the chiefs.... what they lost to the cowboys? Well then
I feel bad for the Giants. From a Dolphins fan
Do the Broncos. They've earned it tree.
At some point I expect my Packers getting a video. Might hurt lol but I'll be good as long as Ted Thompson and Dom Capers are fully roasted.
Can you guys more videos on the nba
What a turn of events bills an jets shitting on the giants who were super bowl champions
Do the Lions next
This channel needs more subscribers
I love both tree and five points so much. Good to see them work together
I'm thinking you do a Legacy of Failure on the Texans of Houston
Football Gods punished the Giants after OBJ's actions by taking out their WR unit
You gotta do the bucs, especially with how they were made out to be one of the better teams of the league this year and have just been a rotting steamy loaf this whole season
I fucking hate Eli so much. Also fuck YOU SPANOS
They suck at drafting! Except for Landon Collins and OBJ...
As a giants fan this made me laugh and cry at the same time, sad but true.
Is that five point games
Honestly, we've got a chance next season. I'm not going to start being a pessimist just because of a bad season. Just cuz our players had a boat party doesn't mean we're an incompetent organization compared to the other teams in our division.
I'm from Connecticut but I laughed about the prep school joke
Derp derpie Derp Derp Derp
I've been waiting this video for a long time (Coming from a diehard Giants fan)
Five Point Vids and UrinatingTree, my life is now complete, Iâ€™m ready to pass on now.
As a Giants fan I have been waiting for this video. I honestly hate this team. 2 Superbowls don't mean shit if you can't become a perennial contender and miss the playoffs every year after. They fore Coughlin but then keep the front office intact and promote the fuckboi McAdoo to be the head coach. If not for the browns I'd say they have the worst front office in all of football. Eli Manning is hugely overrated by giants fans because he managed to beat the Pats twice in the Superbowl. It's not saying much tho besides YA Tittle and Fran Tarkenton the Giants never really had a good QB. And he might be talented, but I hate Odell Beckham. HE has such a shitty attitude he makes it impossible to like him. I stopped watching this team about a month ago, I don't think I am missing anything by not watching them.
I was there for the game in your thumbnail
As a Giants fan, I am embarrassed by this season. This is NOT the same team I saw in the Super Bowl back in 2012. Absolutely pathetic.
Fuck you Spanos
Is that kto?
Fuck Ben Mcapoo
7-Jan
Iâ€™m a giants fan. Now hand me the Lâ€™s of sorrow.
Yo tree go check out TPS's last war video currently, there's an entire thread just making your references and jokes. Your on the rise my friend!
This video makes me realize that my giants will probably suck for at least 10 years
Ben McAdoo? More like Ben Derp-Dee-Doo, amirite? ;)
This video was VERRRRY satisfying. Thank you, Tree.
364th.
fire mcadoo
Please do the sharks for the love of us all
"FINALLY, a lolcow video on my Giants. I've been waiting for it for two months now.

Loved everything you said in the video, and could relate to the poor Giants fan. Only two things though:

1: I'm surprised you didn't flame Jackrabbit and how goddamn overrated he is. The guy is basically a clone of Eli Crapple. Hasn't made one good play since the preseason.

2: Since when did the Giants have a 'vaunted offensive line'?"
Basically New Yorkers should only watch baseball and hockey to avoid misery lmao
ben macadoo probably looks up how to beat your wife instead of play calling
YEEEEESSSS
Stay in yo cell
LMFAO
18-1 bitch
As a Giants fan, donâ€™t draft anything else except A LEFT FUCKING TACKLE
Still tho I'm hoping for a Giants win against the 49'ers so we can have 2 0-16 teams this year
Fuck you spanos! From sunny San Diego
YES! YESSSSSSSS! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Ben McAdoo: the most successful pedophile ever
Chiefs next?
"pauses

Gets into the fetal position to prepare

Resumes"
I never expected the New York Giants were going downhill after being Super Bowl contender to becoming a Derp fest on the field.
Shitton of holding on the helmet catch.  But at least Pete Carrol fucked up and Atlanta imploded so I guess it evens out.
No fuck you Spanos ?? Who are you and what did you do to UT ??
the giants are also very inconsistent, they switch between good, decent, bad, and awful with the jets every year. i love it, also fuck you spanos
Yesssss
I mean eli has thrown for 1820 yards 12 tds and 6 ints. That's better than most starters in the leauge. He isn't the problem this year.
FUCK YOU MARA
as a eagles fan thank you for posting this
UT & FP Vids, name a better duo
j-e-t-s
This is why if you are a Pats fan in NY you are ALWAYS called a bandwagoner

This is great
Yessss... YES!
1 like=1 prayer for this Giants fan ðŸ˜­
Thank god I have the Rangers and Yankees. This season has been a complete dumpster fire
As a giants fan Iï¸ really needed this
"Oh god, this is going to suck so much.

Update: THIS hurt more than watching that FG. Again."
Your friend is not as charismatic as you are, UT. Also, I needed to jack up the volume to hear anything that he said.
do one for the la chagers
Still more successful than the Jets
"So I like the Giants, Mets, Islanders, and Knicks.

At least the Knicks don't all the way suck. For now."
I'm glad you weren't like every mindless Eli hater saying HURR DURR ITS ALL ELI'S FAULT LETS TRADE HIM AND A 7TH FOR AARON RODGERS
Game of the year this weekend: Giants vs. 49ers.
jerry reese is the premiere lolcow of nfl gm's.
That was fucking hilarious. Thank you for that it greatly needed.
Not even one clip of mr derp from South Park? Just disappointing, Tree.
I've been waiting for this collaborationðŸ˜‚
Hello? Do you not notice that this team has 4 Super Bowls, and that Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP?
This is the best day of my life. Never thought urinating tree would make a video of my team
Cowboys fan here. This was beautiful
Still not as derpy as the San Diego, oh oh my bad LOS ANGELES chargers
"Um." - ben mcadoo
I'm a Giants fan and this is the truest video i've seen
At least Manning has two rings...unlike my Eagles... sobs, then looks at the current Giants and Eagles records Much better...
You made a Giants lolcow video and didn't mention the miracle at the meadowlands??? Not 1 or 2??? Wow...
Fuck you Spanos
Three NFC East teams now. As a Cowboys fan, Iâ€™m nervous for when our video comes out, but i love watching our rivals get shit on. Donâ€™t worry, I know weâ€™re Pro Footballâ€™s Outlaw.
I didn't even know Geno Smith was in the league lol
"Somehow i feel, deep down...







This is all Dean Spanos' fault"
Lolcow much
Grab some popcorn  Eagles, Redskins, and fellow Cowboys fans ðŸ¿
No Detroit Lions video yet but at least we get a good surprise courtesy of the NY football derp Giants.
This is your BEST work yet.....and im a Pats fan
Tom coughlin is the most underrated head coach of all time
I'm a simple man. I see UrinatingTree, I beat the fuck out of my dick so goddamn hard that I can't even feel my left leg.

It could be worse for them. At least they've won 4 super bowls as a franchise haha. Not that that helps the mess of a team they have right now...
Handley never won 11 games in a  season McaDoo at least did that. This season may make me a Jet fan. Nah not hat bad.
Do the calgary flames legacy of dissapointment
Welp, now who is gonna be the next lowcow?
Fuck you Kroenke
Oh boy my team, here we go
"One day there will be a Patriots lolcow...

and that day will be a good day."
Do a this week in basketball from now on urinatingtree.
"Ben McAdoo blaming Eli Manning?

He's the one keeping them from becoming the Browns."
as a Giants fan, seeing this makes my body shiver out of anger.
Fucking finally
Oh God, the pain is unbearable.
The only accurate game of thrones scene that accurately depicts the Giants' season is the end of hound vs viper.
With the first pick in the NFL draft the gaints select Josh Rosen quarterback UCLA
So a team with No O-line, a horrible rushing game, All the good WR's are injured, and a completley overrated defense, how do we fix this you ask? Draft a new quarterback and replace Eli, he's the reason we are terrible this year! I mean no, I'm a ravens fan (that hasn't been that fun this year either) but even I can tell getting a quarterback is the LAST thing the fucking giant's need right now. Fix that O-line and if your lucky (meaning if you tank hard enough), Barkley will fall into your hands, and just tough it out with one more year of Eli.
The derp sound effect should be my new text alert ringtone

From what Iâ€™ve seen, theyâ€™re about to call an article 15 on mccadoo
Five points gaming + Urinating Tree + Me getting plastered on Veterans Day = Pure gold
As a Jets fan I'm loving this
"I'm convinced Eli has the 2 rings because life figured it was the best way to spite Peyton.

Fuck you Spanos."
Ummm Barkley is from Penn State, HAS ANYONE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM DRAFTING FROM PENN STATE!?
Do the Texans
I wonder if this guy is going to run out of teams to talk about
As a Giants fan I can only agree
How long until McAdoo gets fired? Taking all bets!

OH HEY IT'S ERIC FLOWERS!
They even got defeated by the Chargers. Fuck you, Spanos.
Eli Manning looks like a homeless Goomba
YES I LOVE THESE VIDEOS BRUH.
I knew this video was coming. As a Patriots fan a must say... thank god this derp era exists. Now we just need Giants fans to realize those 2 superbowls from 7 and 10 years ago don't mean much anymore.
As a giants fan I will say the accuracy in this video along with the humor is great. My g-men are shit this year and likely to continue to be shit for years to come.
Do a Chicago Bulls Lolcow video!!!
the giants bad season is due to macadoo
This hurt like a kick to the crotch.. and to end it with Buckâ€™s fake excitement at the end just more painful
I know it has nothing to do with LA but I have to say, FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Why does Ben McAdoo look like the PC Principal from South Park ?
Been waiting for FPV to make an appearance
As a Giants Fan ive been waiting for this
And you S T I L L have not done those pussy cats (lions)

"Sees UT video
Looks at rope

Not today, friend. Not today."

I think the Giants will finish last in the NFC this year.
I think that after this video I will just be a Rams fan #goff=ðŸ
New York and sports. Same old same old
its his fuckin acumen, kid
Mcadoodle doo sucks big fat veiny elephant cock
What is great about UT is that he hates everyone equally.
As a Giants fan, we were fucking due for this treatment after the season we've been having.
THE FUCKING PENGUINS.
lolcow should be a adjective
fuck you Spanos
as a giants fan i truly appreciate this
derp
It pains me to say it but do the Houston Texans
As a Giants fan this hurts
I only take comfort in those 2 super bowl wins years ago and that this horrible season doesn't fall on Eli when previous bad seasons did or usually does for a QB.
Derp
God damn it I knew this was coming...
My question is how did it take so long. It took so long for them to be bad they used to win with like the same team
They need to sign pekka rinne
As a giants fan. I wanna cry. I love u tho
How can you make a Giants Derp video without including DJax's Punt Return "Miracle at the Meadowlands 2"? Cmonnnn
18 likes and 2 views YouTube you're high
"No wonder my family are fans of Division rivals.
Maybe we'll win the NFC East if Romo or Cousins somehow derp harder than Eli Manning and lose a couple games in a row.
Although, I already knew we were screwed once Odell got hurt, so...
This is what I expected. P.S., we'll probably be in the basement once Eli is gone and Odell gets sent to a real team because tanking."
This video was MADE for five points, I wouldnâ€™t be mad if just narrated the whole video ðŸ¤£
5 points vids has a good ass channel. Good to see him with Tree.
We need a lolcow video on the most lolcow teams, Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Mariners and the LA Clippers those teams are the meaning of Lolcow
"First




Dislike"
The Rangers are due for a Legacy of failure. 1994 was 23 years ago.
Doesn't even hurt that bad because I can always watch those two championship DVDs of the Giants beating the Patriots. You're welcome, everyone.
Could you do a video on individiuals? The Zeke Elliott saga would make an awesome video!
I was anticipating this video. Go Giants!
All we need is the Cowboys and he did the entire NFC East under 2 years.
Please make an Arizona Cardinals lolcow vid. Thanks. They haven;t accomplished much throughout their 120-year existence.
Who's the biggest derp on this Giants team? My answer would be Ben McAdoo. Eli Manning is a very close second.
At least they are having a better season than the 49ers lmao XD
The derp is just too good right now.
As a Giants fan let's just sign pekka rinne and the whole preds defense to be our o line- they "find new and unique ways to kill you" right
Please do the Arizona Cardinals next
It was worth getting off my cristian   minecraft server for this
Welp, I Guess its time for our anal pounding
I live in NY and almost all my friends have been Giants fans for years and whenever I joke around about the Giants they always tell me how they were never Giants fans and were always Bills fans lmao
I knew this was coming eventually and here it is
Flyers please?
Tank for O-line and kill Everyone who isn't a player, Spags, or Mara.
cant wait until macadoo gets a horseshoe dildo shoved up his ass on the way out of town

Urinating Tree and Five Point Vids collaborating in one video. Awesome.
:(
As a giants fan Iâ€™m laughing and crying at the same time
Giants are tanking
But some things never change... FUCK YOU SPANOS
My boy Saquon better not end up on the damn giants
Mara &Reece hired him to tank for a great QB, y'all will appreciate his genius in a few years.
Do a video on the packers withought Rodgers
Do raiders
Oh no...
Ben McAdoo spends more time putting gel in his hair then making his team good
It time for my Giants to take their medicine
I'm a Giants fan and I thank you for making this.

Tree you have to make a Lolcow video for Madden that game has been shit for years now, the last good one imo was Madden 11
as a giants I fucking love this.
Manning derped his way to beating my Patriots. Twice. 18-1. Still hurts.
Last time I was early the falcons did not blow a 28--3 oh wait
Winners of the Offseason, Losers of the tank
I fucking almost choked when you said Geno Smith
Love this channel
I couldn't be happier
That shut up the pre season giants fans
YES, fuck the giants, ruined my Packers playoffs too many times
Notifications squad
41 seconds ago? Last time I was this early, the Giants were upsetting the Patriots
You know itâ€™s a good day when Urinating Tree uploads a video.

Seahawks fan here, weve had issues also. BUT!!!! We have Michael Dickson!! Our punter is iffy though
Damn I miss Phil Dawson
i always thought flemro was really short
Real brown is the Baltimore raven the now is the replacement brown LOL but it true
Us kickers are the are the best
Why does everyone hate on Cincinnati
The best kicker EVER https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Andersen The "Great Dane".
You could easily make a series on crazy kicks. Each episode with a story. Of the top of my head, the New Orleans missed XP, the Eagles recordbreaking 60+yards last year, FG and XP returns, fake FG (has there been any?), and on and on and on...
I am Utah's token Browns Fan! See you at the Denver Saturday Game?
I was completely intrigued by that video! Great job buddy.
Rodrigo Blankenship is incredible. I hope he goes on to be as good in the Pros as he is right now.
My dad was at that packers vs bears game where the kicker ran it in
Well Iâ€™m here to waste my time but this truly took the cake
That fat kid on tiktok is a fat ass
What about Tom Dempsey? Man kicked with his right foot, which he only had HALF OF. He still holds one of the longest FG attempts in game, which he made. Again, with half a foot!
2:05 no pads? and why does he have what looks to be a cameltoe
"Imagine being a Bills fan...we lost a Super Bowl because of a missed kick. 

Still waiting....

Maybe by 2050."
gb packers best team dont argue
the cowboys probably gifted seatgeek the tour facility, practice field time, and box. so in effect they're rewarding the scalpers of their own tickets. gotta love it. they even swindle taxpayers to build stadiums. great video btw.
Garo Yepremian ...1971 Dolphins kicker ...comedic gold
Viniterri running down Herschel Walker...hilarious
I reckon  the  Grammatica brothers were high on something when they used to kick.  They were crazy,  we'll at least one of them was,  Martin right?!
How do you not have 1M subs? Thatâ€™s my only question... ðŸ˜‚
Kickers might have bad days because someone else is doing something wrong. I mean, the ball might not be held properly by the person who holds the ball for the kicker, and that would affect the kick. Also, Charlie Brown can tell you that you can't kick a ball that's yanked away from you.
â€œPretend to be a bears fan.â€ But I hate the stupid team. Theyâ€™re not even good. From, the biggest football fan in the universe.
Lol, now Adam V is the all-time leading scorer ðŸ˜‚
#BringBackDawson
Go Browns!
Raelly gary andreson had to miss that kick
Yes my favorite team vikings kicker bad
Kickers literally have one job
funny an undafted kicker is the nfls all time points leader adam vinitari
You want to make the kicking game fun.  Make all kickers use the straight on style. I still have my toe kicking shoe if needed.  I t took 30 years for the soccer style kicker to break my high school records.
HOT ROD, RESPECT THE SPECS!!!!!!!!
As a Dawg fan... Herschel and Hot Rod are my favoritesðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
bengals trash excuse you?
Love ya kto but you canâ€™t be calling the bengals trash like that
It felt like you were building up to a point the whole video and then it just ended. Maybe Iâ€™ll have to watch it again, by this video felt like a book with a beginning and middle but no end.
Hey man, don't be so sad. Our old kicker back at Minnesota lost us the Packers game. You're not alone. Yet somehow, this dude is making 60 yard field goals in my Madden franchise, no joke.
RIP Morten Anderson is the all-time leading scorer statistics
Bye bye browns Head coach and OC...
Ohhh yeah  BULLDOGS
Lol, Vinarteri is all time point scorer now.
im an Alabama fan an its nice having a great offence/defence but everytime our field goal unit comes out i get nerves.
PRESURE IS THE NAME OF THEIR GAME ...not the same to hit bullseye ina bar when nothing is on the line , and no one caresÂ  ... than to do it when there are millions of dollars at stake and the world is watching
Ayyeee Iâ€™m a browns fan
4:20 now vinatieri is the leading scorer #goat
LMAO that Green Bay kicker railed some white lightning and was like "F*CK, F*CK, F*CK" and scored
There are still Browns fans? Wow, they really suck
Is five point vids a ravens fan. Because Tree is a Steelers fan. Flemlo is a bungled fan. KTO is a browns fan. Youâ€™ve got the AFC north as the 4 best sports YouTubers.
"â€œImagine being a bears fanâ€ 
sheds tear â€œI donâ€™t have to imagineâ€"
Rodrigo Blankenship gets the loudest cheers during the lineups at UGA
Man I miss Phil Dawson
Was the all time points leader
then i might as well be a kicker for denver
Adam just beat the overall points!
Great vid. Keep it up.
Yo I'm a bears fan
hotrod is the man
I miss Phil Dawson.
fuck seatgeek and ticketmaster and all the others
I love Adam Vinatieri
Makes me miss Phil Dawson. Smh
Please what is that song from the end
I live in south dakota and Adam vineteri and brock lesnar inspire me to try
If someone knows beat when he shows the dawson field goal let me know
I saw that â€œbengalsâ€ trash Iâ€™m a bengals fan so try me lol
Ironic Iâ€™m watching this as the browns new kicker missed a fg and PAT against the Steelers
Watching Steelers versus browns right now and write has to is watching this video of the brown making the kick the Browns just made field goal
Why are Qb's and the kickers the most scrawny?
Cleveland native, life-long browns fan here. I remember watching that game with my folks. Things got crazy in my house lol. WOOF WOOF
Weâ€™re you playing with big dick jezzer
kickers are wierd
Browns are trash foh
Nice to see this guy finally getting the views he deserves
Blair walsh
Finally, someone who tells the outcome of the game for people who donâ€™t know. Subbed.
5:06 who is that?
"Gonzales has missed to the left
Has missed to the right 
He even has missed thru the middle"
"A Rugby Fly-Half watching Football kickers....

This might be interesting...."
One of your best vids yet brother. Keep em coming!
The Browns. The emblem on the field is a Brown helmet. They suck and are a shit team called the Browns. When you go to take a shit you're bringing the Brown's to the Super Bowl. Change the fucking name already and maybe they might actually have a record better then 3-13.
Hey Iâ€™ve been a fan for 4 months now Iâ€™d love to see a collaboration with you and flemlo you went to the game with him Iâ€™m also a fan of his and I think you guys could make some really good collaborations
so the moral of the story is: ZANE GONZALEZ SUCKS
ZI am a Browns fan and I like baker.
okay so i was 9 when the ravens browns game happened at the end of this video and i was also there in the stadium "Ravens fan" and they said it was no goood and the announcer told everyone to drive safe and have a nice evening. half the stadium was gone by the time they decided it was good and to send it to overtime. i was so pissed and heart broken lol.
Why didn't browns renew Phil Dawson's contract ðŸ˜£
I'm a browns fan to
Mmg did all this
Your channel makes my lazy Saturdays at college worth it. Your content is among the best I've seen. Thank you, sir.
College football has more action because they want to make the leagues.
You went back to the 80s, but you should've gone one more decade for Tom Dempsey. I mean he kicked a 63-yarder and the dude only had half a foot.
Bengal trash what
RIpping on them physically?  Look at most kicker's bios they were generally star position players in high school on top of basketball/baseball/track.  Adam Vinatari was a stud in high school as a QB, Middle Backer, and other sports. Plus how can there not be 32 competent kickers?  Ok, how can there not be 32 competent QBs?
Those were missed intentionally lol
5:13 I actually am a bears fan
Urinating tree was there!
Bro idk why but you sound like mr nightmare
Man I'm from sweden and while american football isnt a big sport here I watch all of the highlight reels. Stumbled across this video and I gotta say you have an amazing storytelling capability! You keep it so interesting for the viewers to watch these different videos since you are cunning and have amazing production value.
Seatgeek is giving us tons of free shit to lure people to their site. Fuck off dude. You dumb as shit?
Chargers had that Korean kid that missed everything.  Where is he now?

F'ing awesome video, well done sir.
And CAN YOU KICK A FOOTBALL?
Kickers have by far the most points ever scored.
Rob Bironas. 60 yards. Never forget.
0:50 fite me boi
Glad we got rid of Zane Gonzalez
They get paid a bunch of money to kick a ball then chill and enjoy a front row seat of nfl games lol
Being a ex semi pro âš½ football player, I'm pretty confident that I could kick one of your eggs the entire length of the field...
TO BROWN'S
"So THATS what the urinating tree looks like 
I know he already did a face reveal but the quality was shit"
SodakðŸ’
just get mayfield out there to do a drop kick
Iâ€™m a ravens fan too lmaoðŸ˜‚
Rodrigo Blankenship is the best kicker in all of college football
Browns have 8 championships, they will return to glory soon with or without a good kicker.
Blair Walsh and Nick Folk are straight ass. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Zayne Gonzalez! Put yo motherfuckin head back down you god damn BUM!!! - Chiseled Adonis
Skol browns
Who dat!
Iâ€™m a ravens fan and Iâ€™m gonna be honest that lost to the Browns wasnâ€™t that bad that was a hell of a game and suspenseful as fuck rip Justin Tuckerâ€™s perfect extra point record lol
Surprised you didn't put anything about ganos 63 yarder
Itâ€™s not easy kicking a football. Itâ€™s not easy kicking a ball in general. The main point of kicking a ball is aiming at. You have to hit the ball in certain spots in order to go the direction you want to go. Ask soccer players. If you want to shoot  for a goal in a far distance, You need to aim and kick it in a certain spot of the ball. Thatâ€™s because all ball textures all have a certain ways that balls move. A plain âš½ï¸ soccer ball has all those octagon line shapes because it causes the ball to spin in clockwise motion. Thatâ€™s why you can sometimes see a soccer ball curve while itâ€™s in the air. As for a football ðŸˆ . Itâ€™s main creation was for it to be throw. Itâ€™s egg shaped. ðŸ¥š. When QBs throws the football, it in the air, the ball is in a spiraling motion. When it comes to kicking the ball, that egg shaped ball can be really hard to aim for a kicker. It gets worse if the weathers not on your side. Sure, Field goals and extra points are made most of the time, but itâ€™s not easy kicking a football. Try it yourself. Warning though, they give you blisters
NICK ELLIOT.................google that scumbag. kicker for kc chiefs......
Phil Dawson was a beast and I was pissed when our Browns let him go..
I'm glad you brought up that Dawson kick. I remember watching that game live. Ray Lewis & the Ravens were pissed off that they play could even be reviewed. They ran into the lockerrooms thinking they had won the game.
Ravens just experienced the bad parts of kicking from their veteran.
I was at game 1, browns vs steelers... people left after we were down 7-21. They missed such a good game but it ended so annoyingly. We did get lucky when the steelers missed their FG but def should've won (that being said it was pooring down rain, but no excuses for week 2 for Gonzalez)
Cocaine is kicker juice
first of all your seats are the most perfect seats in all of Texas like I didn't think they came that visually appealing if I win the lottery first thing im doing is buying lifetime tickets to that suite
That opening photo...that was the Mount Rushmore of sports Youtubers. Stung a lil bit when I saw the shirts, though
Footballs such a weird sport because of the specifics with each position. Yeah other major sports have variations in positions, but itâ€™s not like the difference between being a linebacker or a place holder haha
Tom Dempsey setting a record that stood for years (62 yards) with half a foot should be in this video
Kickers are so underrated just look up for the KC vs NE game no one talk about Gostkowski, he was perfect in the game with long FG and no one gave him the credit he deserves
Everyone is somewhat fit and then there is Tree.
You think your kicking just this season is bad Iâ€™m a Vikings fan and we can never kick ðŸ˜‚
3:53 "WHAT IS UP DRAMA ALERT NATION!"
You should do a video on the CAFL also known as the China Arena Football League, when I was in China just recently it seemed like a big deal.
Browns to the super bowl this year
Do the best NFL teams with a terrible quarterback
No one is wierder than Harmon.
Whats the name of that fancy tune in the outro ?
3:55 well that stat is kinda depressing dont ya think
Blankenship a beast go dawgs
MMG was at that seat geek thing
A lot of Kickers are sorry asf and only the Cowboys old kicker was Beast
I had club feet when I was born, there is less than 200,000 cases each year. Yes that is a big sum, but out of 7 billion people on the Earth this is a very rare case. Though because of the way my toes are shifted and slightly twisted I am a better kicker.
please do a video on last chance u players
I like the Georgia kickerðŸ˜Ž
Finna drop the browns in the super bowl
when you mentioned bad kickers you forgot kyle bambard
Stephen gostkowski few years back omg. 50/50 weather he would make it.
Wait WHAT ? cleavland has a football team last I heard they moved and haven't been seen on a score board since
Liked solely for rodrigo Blankenship in the thumbnail lmaoo
Hey KTO could you do a video on the 2016 Penn state football team and how they rallied from 2-2 to the rose bowl
What's the song at 9:00?
Kickers on cocaine. Murica
Iâ€™m a Vikings fan.  Iâ€™ve had to deal with some of the worst chokes in nfl history
Did you see mmg
You can hear the amount of anger ravens fans were feeling. The stadium just entirely erupted XD
I hope you remember me been here since 25k
As someone who has marched on the cowboys field for band and am doing so again this year. The stadium sucks. The seats are jist plastic and the fieild was smaller than it should be. Not really sure why
Justin tucker.
Do tua tagovailoa next
Us vikings fans also hated Blair walsh
"Marvel: Infinity War is the biggest crossover ever.
SeatGeek: Hold my beer"
Hey KTO could do a video on the rams this season or the huskers and the rebuild?
Donâ€™t let this change your mind from the fact they lost every game last year
Don't start sentences with "so".
The only players that use their FOOT in American FOOTball.
I was at the cowboys and lions game
Suites are the best. I went to the vikings preseason game and it was so fun!
What about the saints kicker with half a foot
Not as bad as aguayo
Blair Walsh?
Wtf why wasnâ€™t EDP445 there for the flag football gameðŸ˜‚
0:49 what makes this ok to say, I'm insalted, and your name just got on the List-who ever the F you are, putting a bengals fan out like that, your a coward, I'm calling your Comment Random and inflamatory, i would suspend you over this. make a mental note your Welcome in cincinnati , please come visit us, remember we dont want to visit the Puppy Farm
#steelersnation
You could have titled this browns kicking montage ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I'm a browns fan myself and I just got to say that I havent felt safe with a kicker since we had Phil Dawson
Has any team tried using a soccer player to be a kicker? It would be interesting to see how they would play
You should make a video on the past 10 heisman trophy winners and where they are now
Mmg was there
Love how you gotta a shot of Hot Rod... GoDawgs
My boy rodrigo
My dad actually coached mar Mosleyâ€™s son in football and is good friends with him me and my family have been to his mansion and farm
Blair Walsh has is the worst kicker donâ€™t at me
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAjQiRsdMCtBJUwCz4N02w
"KTO: imagine if you are a bears fan 

Me: I am a bears fan...."
Iâ€™m a browns fan too, and Gonzales makes me want to cry. He legit lost us two easy games.
what if vick never got arrested
Rodrigo is my favorite kicker of all time ðŸðŸðŸ
What's the song at the end of the video
4:38 why is this dudes feet so long and skinny wtf
What about eagles vs. giants last year. 63 yards?
You should do a video of Jimmy Weirick who was a god at North football and won offensive player of the year for Ohio as well as qb of the year
MMG was there at that flag football game
Heartbreakingly bad kickers? One name: Scott Norwood.
"not sure if this has been done before but..
what if drew bledsoe never got hurt ?"
Iâ€™m a saints fan and I remember laughing at the end
Hi Hi hi hi hi Pin pin pin
man whats that song
Walsh,Carlson,and forbaith all suck but still SKOL VIKINGS
How can you say the bengals are trash when they are better than the Browns by a mile. Baker is trash
VENEZUELAN COCK SLUTS.....
Now that was an entertaining video!
Lol I caught your rag saying flemlo is Bengals trash. Ouch! Love both of y'alls content. Keep up the food work!
I wonder who the browns fans hate the worse among the AFC north division
So this video was a let down. We didn't learn about any odd behavior of kickers. The point of the video.
I Subbed because you said you were a browns fan my favorite player is nick chubb
the browns legend! mr phil dawson! love that dude. the browns won alot of games bc of that guy
wait are you from ohio and a rams fan? wth so am i!!! lol i doubt you are but thats awesome. im sorry to hear your a browns fan... ive watched my dad go through depressing times over the last 20 years..
kicking so much more complex than just kicking the ball, if any part of the operation(snapper, kicker, and holder) makes a mistake it compounds. and in the pros if the ball isn't kicked 1.5ish seconds after its snapped, its probably gonna get blocked because of the disadvantage the line is put at and a man that can likely run a 4.4 coming off the edge. people take the efficiency of kickers today for granted, the margin of error that a kicking play can have and still go well is slim and kickers still can keep 90% accuracy with all those variables is impressive.
Poor Cleveland Browns
Make a video about a great linemen
Kto's a browns fan like me
Wow SDSU... It's not very often you see good guys from FCS teams. Carson Wentz was just a very big coincidence... Ugh of only there were more griz in the NFL.
Talk about the 1982 nfl season with the player strike and the special edition 16 team playoffs!!!?? ðŸ”¥
As a Georgia fan rodrigo is my man
yes. yes we are
My cousin is a kicker and is good friends with the QB
I love how ur vids end bro â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
Rdcworld1 was there
9:00 song?
Cocaine is one hec* of a drug
"I'm just happy Justin Tucker is my kicker.






For now..."
"I am a bears fan this pisses me off
At least he got cut"
Why did he cover it up at the beginning.
Browns fans RIP I like the browns RIP me
Same happened with Randy Bullock while with the Texans. Highly promised kicker in college, bust in the NFL
go dalliscoboys
Urinating Tree is the image of Yinzerdom he could be my neighbor (I mean this in the most positive way possible)
Believe it or not Some Teams their Kickers are the all time high in points scored.
Do a what if the Packers took Barry Sanders instead of Tony Mandrch!!!
will you do a video on what happened to tavon austin?????
Falcons #1 kicker lol our best player got hurt matt bryant
I think the number 2 is cursed for the browns
Who-Dey
The number 2 is cursed for the browns
Imagine being a bills fan. Lost the super bowl bcuz of a kick
I'm a die hard UGA fan and Hot rod is a God and Herschel is even more
Everyone is a Browns fan deep down inside.
Adam is a god
Do a video about the Redskins superbowl bound replacements in 1979
Harmon from Blue Mountain State
5:12. I'm a bears fan. And if you include that clip one more time. I'm never ever watching another one of your vids again. This is your 1 and only warning
How about this for a crazy field goal. I think it was Robbie Gould, though it could have been Paul Edinger, but there was a time when the ball hit all 3 bars and went through. It hit the right upright first, then the left upright about halfway down, and finally it bumped the crossbar on it's way down. It went through but it was that crazy kind of event that had you thinking wtf.
Same thing with hockey goalies
he said â€œimagine to be a bears fanâ€... first time iâ€™ve ever heard that come from a browns fan LMAO
justin tucker ????????????
That is my my uncle
Hey kto I saw a 27 yard line theory for the Skol clan I saw it on nfl network please do a video on that
Troydan gaming was there
Papa Meages was there
Why does the vikings somehow always fuck it up
They Might be weird! But the game is still rigged ðŸ˜ Just Like the NBA
Best football channel on YouTube.
1:00 Thank me later.
Nice vid
"""98 NFC championship game"" - slam your fist onto any flat surface whilst saying ""damn"" 

hopefully someone will understand where this is from."
Kickers are actually goats
Just found your channel browns fans for life man. There gonna beat the bucs. GO BROWNS!!!
The browns suck
wasnt zane gonsalez injured in the pelvic area when he did those kicks?
Fuck the Shitty Browns, Ravens Nation yâ€™all getting that ass dusted when yâ€™all come to Bmore
Browns are my home team.... but they suck
I'm8
I'm a kicker
Only reason Jets lost to Browns, the league SCREWED Jets; that was their 3rd game in 11 days.
yeh go brows
You've gotta do the Texas rangers 2010 and 2011. The best team to never win a World Series.
I guess you just forgot that Justin Tucker exists, because one would think he might warrant a mention in a video like this.
As a Chargers fan, thank you for not mentioning Josh Lamboâ€™s performance against the Browns in 2016 ðŸ˜‚
"I'm surprised you didnt bring up the kicker for the Colts in Super Bowl V.  A rookie, Jim O' Brien, at kicker won the game for them under threat by his teammates. After the game, the men in the Baltimore lockeroom put away their scizzors in front of him, saying they couldn't cut the young mans hair (long hair was considered a no-no).
I'll give you props though for avoiding the obvious Gary Yepremian(?) gaffe against the 'skins in their perfect season, or showing his badly balding head, as every other topic bringing up kickers tends to do."
The Vikings have a history of having good kickers every other time of the season but they turn terrible when needed he most
I love that you're an underdog guy.. I'd love to see some GT love
OH SHIT WHAT UP UT FLEM FPV
Is this because you met mmg
How are you gonna have a video about kickers, and not mention Tom Dempsey?
To much pressure on the kickers
Go browns
I am a browns fan to
best in state of georgia for the fresman class ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
im a kicker
No mention of Justin Tucker the god of kickers rn
seatgeek=dad
Yo weâ€™re not weird weâ€™re just different ðŸ˜‚ sometimes I kick barefoot
Post more plz I watched all your videos
bengals aint trash
what a random vid
This Channel is a replacement Kicker.
Kickers are like YouTube Content Creators. Most of them don't have enough talent or creativity to run a Media Channel but they make incompetent videos like this for attention anyway. It's like you missed the Point of your own Video... They aren't doing anything weird. The Barefoot thing is Kinda wierd... I guess... The MVP was because of a Strike so they Had to give it to someone... The Odd fg at the end is cool but Footballs are shaped weird, had nothing to do with the Kicker... Why don't you answer your Original Statement? Isn't that what a Report is about? Do you not know how to write a Report?
KTO can you please do what if mike jones doesn't make the tackle in super bowl 34?
Letting go of Awesome Phil Dawson was a huge mistake. Regardless of the franchise tag. Pay that man. He still kicks today and is still one of the top!
Your a lefty just like me
Rodrigo Blankenship , by far the best kicker in the ncaa. And he plays for my favorite team. Go dawgs!!
Keep god first not football
Troydan was there
White guys need SOMETHING to do in the game
1:27 gives me Blair Walsh flashbacks, so so terrible...
i am a bears fan
Love the Herschel walker nfl vids
Seat geek is trash
Stop talking shit on my bro rodrigo
What about Robbie Gould's kick in a driving wind that ended up being way, way wide?
It's all a head game with kickers. They have the skill strength and talent. If they aren't there mentally they are nothing
Do a 100th video specia
"5:11 I don't need to imagine...




I am one."
Not-so-ramdom SeatGeek guy.
Haven't seen the Alabama crimson Tides kickers you could make a full video of that
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen on YouTube. Extremely informative, entertaining, and eye-opening. Great content!
Where is rodrigo Blankenshipâ€™s field goal where he passed the ball, ran back and made it
"You should do

The most forgotten receiver in college football,
Devin Smith"
Brown's auck
Small victories browns fans..very..very small
every player has an off day games will never be perfect kickers qb's rb's recievers will have of days. The fans are the ones that make things worse for the players. fans are by far nowhere near perfect so why should they expect athletes to be perfect.
Okay, I know browns have had some bad field goals lately, BUT FUCKING LOOK AT THE VIKINGS KICKERS. We have way more of a history of shitty shitty kicks.
Itâ€™s cool u like the browns no bandwagon here
ahem, Hot-Rod is NOT weird. He is kicking goat
I am a bears fan. This truly tics me off.
As a kicker myself, Iâ€™ve missed a game winner once and that was 7 weeks ago but since, nuh uh
What's with the Browns & Ravens always ending their games in kickoffs?
"Great video but...
Fuck the browns."
Urinatingtree anybody?
What about Doug flutieâ€™s drop kick Field goal
You should do a vid about that Brad banks iowa team that got crushed by USC in the orange bowl. A few hall of famers on that team
How are you not going to mention Justin Tucker
Steven haushaka is the best kicker in the NFL hands down
What about the kicker who kicked a game winning field goal with one foot.
I laughed so hard when  you said kickers on cocaine
I'm born and raised in Buffalo ny and been a life long bills fan Scott Norwood
Shameless advertising at the beginning. Times were better before everyone resorted to this.
Rondrigo blancinchip aka hot rod
For real though the browns need to trade their kicker
I love your vids keep it up
You gonna talk about kickers and not even mention Tucker?
Did I Just See Bengals trash ðŸ˜¢ Cmon man Atleast They're Better Than The Browns....Oh Sorry.....
Stop sucking your own dick
Browns need a new kicker!
Is that the training facility that got BTFO'd in a wind storm?
"Pure gold as always.  

I have a suggestion for a future video:  The History of the NFL Bye Week.  There's surprisingly a lot of material there to mine.  I think you'd do a great job telling it."
So, I'm a CFL fan. There's this kicker in my favourite team... He kicked 44 consecutive field goals this season, and counting. He's 5'7. I mean... 44 CONSECUTIVE field goals! He's a rookie.
You forgot about player you know the one in th thumbnail
Go Browns! :D
How tf you hook that bad
"Kickers on cocaine"
Do a video on Marcus Lattimore!
There are still a few barefoot kickers left these days :)
Iâ€™m surprised Joey Julius didnâ€™t get a shoutout.
9:01 bars
No Justin Tucker wow
I am a bears fan...ouch
Titans baby! Got the best kicker in the world, Ryan Succop.
Am browns fan to
I wouldâ€™ve been dumb mad at seatgeek cuz Iâ€™m an eagles fan
MMG  was there too lol
Your a browns fan ðŸ˜‚
MMG was also there with him
I love the bears
You gotta admit that outro gives you the chills
Whatâ€™s the song in the beginning?
:50 your an idiot bengals are amazing
Bengals are afc north champs and the browns will always be the cellar dwellers. WHO DEY!
Was mmg at the game u were at
Lol you canâ€™t say bengals are trash your a browns fan ðŸ’©
2:24 ðŸ˜‚ lol not to mention YOUNGHOE KOO from Georgia Southern.... Lmao all 3 are now TRAAAAASH ðŸš®ðŸš®ðŸš®
What about graham gano
Rip 5:35 Iâ€™m a bears fan
4:36 mans got big ass feet lol
Why was Herschel Walker Iâ€™m here again?
You really need to get a button to skip the seer geek ads
Dislike the video if you remember the last time the buffalo bills were relevant..like if u forget about them alot
Whyâ€™d u put Blankenship in the thumbnail. DO NOT @ my man man Rodrigo blakenship
I saw mmg
Hell yeah brother Iâ€™d love to meet you at a Browns game!!!!
Oh wasant troydan there
lets go browns and bengals
Little did they know about mmg
Five points Vids is old a fuuuuuuuck
I feel so bad for that browns kicker
what do you mean brother the Bengals are legends WHO DEY
I'm a browns fan to
Tell the kicker thing to the chargers
Remember the Chiefs vs Broncos two years ago? Crazy TD to Tyreek Hill as regulation ran out, went to OT, came down to a FG bouncing off the left post barely sneaking in behind the right post for the win? Crazy.
One more tik Tom ad and Iâ€™m ending my life
5:15 imagine being a bears fan I am one that hurt watching that
Go Browns
5:13 I donâ€™t have to imagine. Iâ€™m already a Bears fan.
In Dawson We Trust!!
Im a cowboys fan
I will forever remember watching that Phil Dawson game tying field goal with my dad and being overly emotional that it saved the game.
You didn't add the clip where will hill III ran one back for a game winner off a blocked field goal :) #Ravens Nation
As a Vikings fan this hurts
I am a bears fan
Come on man. I'm a Ravens fan that loves your channel. U CAN'T END THE VIDEO LIKE THIS
my 8 year old son can make a 20 yard field goal!
What about Janikowski the 270 lb kicker
Can you do a video on Quinton Flowers
MMG was at that game too Lions vs Cowboys
man i miss phil dawson
As a Vikings fan, this triggers me
how does seat gear make money?
feels bad good luck in the NFL
Mason Crosby missing 5
Are u even from cleaveland or are u just a bandwagon fan??
4:16 WAS the all time leading scorer.... GO VINI
Ray Lewis is a murderer
It great to be a Packers fan 5:30
Did you see mmg?
Brown's doo doo
Justin Tucker. he is goo.
Don't talk about the Gary Anderson thing
Zane was injured though... I feel bad for him. His career is over because his coaches made him play through an injury
Zane gonzalez is from the blair walsh school
7:10 this is why I hate being a Vikings fan we only miss the most important field goals
Zane Gonzalez breaks my heart, as an asu fan I love the guy, and he was the most reliable kicker Iâ€™ve ever seen, Iâ€™m so confused
But i mean hey the ravens have 2 super bowls
Fck da Brown's
He says bengals trash what team does he like again cough cough Browns
You just need to look for the biggest, drunkest Polak you can find
2:32 and third place was Younghoe Koo - another disaster in the NFL
ðŸ‘
I feel you man, we have had trouble punting this season but I think that we have our guy in Greg
"Thats harsh for me when ypu said just imagine being a bears fan well for u i am 




There pretty bad"
First youtuber I have heard of that likes the browns too
Dude you sat in the same suite as me but I sat there during the Oklahoma tcu big 12 championship
Browns are trash
I love bro, but you can't be calling people randoms 0:15 when they get more subs and views than you.
KTO KEEP UP THE GREAT VIDEOS ; highly entertaining
What is the name of the song that starts at 9:00
Yo who else is a browns fan
im also a brown fan and sometimes its hard to watch a team that does good at the begging and at the end just lose from bad calls and the ref making bad calls losing us the game and missing easy field goals and if you are a browns fan like this comment
"I saw that Bengals trash mister ...







And I totally agree"
Hot rod is insane
Did u meet mmg
329,451st view
I wish I would knew that you  were in the dfw would of loved meeting you plus could of showed around the area
I am a browns fan to
I miss Phil Dawson every day
Hot rod!
Goggles best college kicker
The dude at the beginning is for no raps if didn't know now you know so go check him out
Hot Rod is a beast
did my boy say left crossbar 8:39
Go browns
Who was QB in the game they played?
did you meet mmg in dallas?
Donâ€™t be talking crap about the bengals boy they are the next best thing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
make a video on tyreek hill pressing charges on the patriots fan who threw beer on him
The only reason that that guy is older than some of his teammates only because he is a kicker and u have less of a chance to get hurt
KTO pumping these videos out so quickly makes me wet
Hot Rod!
Bengaâ€™s are not trash
This brings back bad memoriesðŸ˜¢
I'm a vikes fan and Carlson sucks
9:21 song please
Who is that dude at 5:04
I actually like kickers and punters they are so underated
Great video KTO!
Ghram Gano is the best kicker. Go Panthers!
Fun fact at 5:34 the kick was under the influence of cocaine it says in his book alive and kicking which i have meet him
The kicker on coke is hilarious that shit gives you super human powers
not only is it bad for the chargers. but imagine being a vikings fan. your team has lost or tied 50-100 games because of their kicker.
where mmg
You trash b*tch
I've been curious of the course of a long time about Kickers (Put , Holders nd Snappers) ... I appreciate the small insight about The Kicker.
Bengals is lit wtf are u talking about
adam is on my favrit team rite now the colts
Bears had a kicking identity with Gould. Now there is just a hole at kicker. :(
Good video as a Bengals can I don't appreciate that jab lol.
The bears are back
What you saying about the bengals
You should talk about janikowski
2:28 and thereâ€™s Younghoe Koo on the far left
Iâ€™m a browns fan too!
I am a punter and this vid is great
Dont worry KTO im a browns fan too, i was upset.
"Here is what I think the NFL will be like in 10 years:


Read more"
My grandpa was the kicker/punter for the Lombardi packers. He won two world champs and super bowl 1-2. All of his friends would talk about how important he was to the team and I really idolized him. Sadly though he passed away a couple of years ago. RIP Don Chandler
Can't believe I don't remember Vinatierri running down Herschel Walker!!!  That is IMPRESSIVE!!!
You should do a video talking about the Bengals and Browns gunslinging game in 2007 week 2
"KTO: 
""Watch this next scene and imagine being a bears fan""

Me:
""fuck..."""
Blair Walsh is the most hated guy over here in Seattle (we lost so many games because of him.)
I thought ncaa football games were the only place to get crazy name mashups like lebron oâ€™malley, then UGA signed rodrigo Blankenship.
what is KTO!>!
we need vinateri
The game during the saints Gonzalez was playing on a Groin injury
I am a browns fan and I was at that browns V Saints game and it was truly sickening because of Zane Gonzalez
As a Vikings fan I knew Gary Anderson was going to come up
You started to play that blocked field goal video and I immediately got upset. I was at that game and had never seen so many angry browns fans including myself.
Hey Iâ€™m a big auburn fan, and Iâ€™m also a big Vikings fan so it was really sad to see Daniel cut. I wish the would have given him a second chance.
KTO putting the â€œBrownsâ€ logo over his Cowboys shirt is the best thing Iâ€™ve seen all morning
He had a torn groin
"Wanna hear something sad?




Alabama can't get a good kicker."
GO BROWNS
Lucky you got to go to a cowboys game I am a big cowboys fan
Of course it was Pete Morelli officiating that Browns game at the end. He seems to always be officiating when weird things happen. He also just so happens to be the President of a private high school in the city I live in ðŸ˜‚
Remember Sebastian Janikowski was drafted in the 1st round
the ending to this video was perfect
Hope Hot Rod will be good in the NFL.
Also great vid forsure sub and notifications
Almost any kicker can hit field goals in practice. Where they earn the paycheck is when the pressure is on can they still make those kicks.
How can you have a list like this and not include Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints. Guy didnâ€™t have toes in his kicking foot and set a field goal distance record that lasted for more than a decade.
remember when the browns went 0-16?
I didn't know five points looked that old, damn
As a Browns fan I MISS PHIL DAWSON
Morten Anderson doe sent have all time Adam venetaire
Was that trip in the beginning of the vid at the Frisco facilities?
"Kickers on Cocaine" Sounds like a movie
That kick by Phil Dawson in Baltimore you featured I was there right behind that field goal believe it or not absolute pandemonium, oh yea me and my brother were wearing Browns jerseys
So a browns fan a bengals fan and a steelers fan. Mustve been a pretty entertaining time
Letâ€™s go Cleveland !! #DawgPound
Thank god for Matt Bryant
You just had to bring up Gary Anderson and the '98 Vikings. Twenty freaking years ago, and it still hurts like it just happened :(
Didn't the Jets have to use a kicker as a QB in a game if I remember correctly he actually had a decent game
0:15 I think that was Mopi
Ok is this a video about kickers or a dig on Vikings fans?
Poor fivepointvids. Stuck with the kids lol. Love all y'all content.
I canâ€™t believe we lost that gameðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­
"Nobody gives a shit about the kicker until they start missing.

Dope channel, my friend. I really enjoy your videos and especially the song at the end when you top  off the video."
Always love your endings in your videos
Holy shit dude!... You are ridiculous with all these Browns videos. And you throw the ball like a fairy.
"I had to pause at 7:00 and skip ahead
It hurt too much"
ROBBIE GOULD IS THE BEST KICKER IN THE NFL!
Wowwwww. I wish I wouldnâ€™t have watched this video. Even tho I kinda was annoyed at how much of a Browns homer you are, I still would watch your videos bc I respected your knowledge of the game. But after seeing you on the field and throwing a ball, I canâ€™t watch anymore. Youâ€™re an embarrassment.
It's not an easy thing to do to make 95% of your kicks. Just ask Mason Crosby.
Who's that Browns kicker with the mustache and the single bar face mask
I also just met Brian Hansen! He came to my church to talk to us lol
I went to the same highschool as Adam vinateri my freshman year
You didnâ€™t talk about Justin Tucker wtf?
As a Ravens fan I totally remember all those kicks mentioned at the end.
As a chargers fan, i feel the same way last season.
Dang get off flemlo raps man.
Blankenship was on my middle school football team
"Aye my boiiii Younghoe Koo,



WTF MANNN!"
what year was that dawson kick?
"i love being a browns fan 
even through all the rough stuff i still love it"
thank god for harrison butt kicker
Browns shoulda started 5-0
Did you meet mmg there!?!?!?
Once again, another quality video. I really love how you look back to my favorite era of NFL football (80's-90's). I appreciate the hell outta that man, keep em' coming.
Lol this video was a waste of time.. disliked
What I want to know is how all these good kickers are missing this year.
Alabama has the most consistently garbage ass , always suck ,game losing kickers ever.....
Go Browns
gonzales... man did i feel bad for that guy. #SaintsFan
What song is used at the end of the video?
donâ€™t say nothing about kickers until your a vikings fanðŸ˜”
Kickers are people too
For that Best Kicker award in college, shouldâ€™ve been Drew Brown from Nebraska all the way, the Brown family are kicking legends at Nebraska and 3 out of 4 brothers made it to the NFL
Same event as Mmg?
Please do a vid about Davante Adams
Think vinatieri broke the all time scoring record
my boy flemlo rapsðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥
Fire Amos Jones. No idea why we even picked him up in the first place. Cardinals ST was atrocious with him and now then we pick him up. Kickoff coverage and returns are absolute garbage, and why is Jabrill Peppers returning kicks and risking injury?
#ForTheBrand
theres was a kid at my highschool,(he plays for ut now) who could kick better then about 60% of the other people in the nfl his last names dicker and i wouldnâ€™t be suprised to see him start in the nfl
Hanging out with the salty yinzer must have been a lot of fun.
#fucknatekaeding
Did u see mmg
What if if KTO pronounced 'field' correctly?
I would love to play career mode with a Kicker on madden
As a kicker I find this offensive... but true. I honestly canâ€™t explain why sometimes Iâ€™m on and sometimes Iâ€™m off
Blankenship for the dawgs is good very good
Why making my team look bad aka ravens
KTO, man... I MISS old man Phil Dawson. Iâ€™d trade a 4th rounder to Arizona RIGHT NOW if they would take the deal. He was Mr. Consistent FOREVER for us. I miss him and Josh Cribbs. Wish we had them and Joe Thomas back, then we would be really cooking because Baker wouldnâ€™t have to worry about his 6 EVER. He could rest easy knowing 9.9 times out of 10, Joe Thomas is gonna take care of business and clean up that pesky pass rush because playing Thomas in pass protection was like getting locked by Deion on the outside. Ainâ€™t no one gonna hear from you that week.
I just discovered a football league called the AAF (alliance of American Football), it's set to have its inaugural season 1 week after this coming super bowl.... wondering if you could make a video on it
Chester Marcol is a badass
4:35 nasty ass mothafuckas
When the browns won that game against baltimore i was so upset because im a ravens fan
I hate kickers and punters!
Itâ€™s hard being a titans fan, our kicker was Mr. Irrelevant
i have to say this as a vikings fan f*ck carlson
How about Tom Tupa coming in at QB for the Jets? Or Danny White and Sammy Baugh and Bobby Lane and George Blanda bring QBs who kicked?
Herschel walker went to Georia
Rodrigo Blankenship is not a â€œhot rodâ€™â€™
I was at that ravens browns game with the crossbar kick. I fucking hated that game.
Mason Crosby against the Lions though
Pretty neat that they call that extension the Dawson Bar now!
"Browns
1st quarter 7-7
2nd quarter 21-21
3rd quarter 35-28
4th quarter 42-42
Overtime browns win by a field goal once again"
You know, I've never got nfl kickers. I've know kids on my soccer team that's been able to kick 50 yarders in middle school (i could kick a 40 easily in 8th grade) And yet that's a hard kick in the nfl. Just a thought.
BoomSports is a Browns fan.
And Iâ€™m a kicker
Go pack go
I am a bears fan
I'm a kicker Gonzalez is an embarrassment to the browns as a kicker
Mmg was there too right
"3:03 
FAST AS FCK BOI"
im a bears fan AND TRUBISKY ISNT A BUST!!
GO COWBOYS
2:29 Is that Younghoe Koo? All these guys NFL careers are done after a handful of games.
Being a kicker has to be the most stressful position in football ðŸ˜‚ knowing that the fate of the game relies on your foot and any false move you make can mean all the difference on you having a job the next day!
I never knew Vinatieri ran Walker down.
"Hey bud, I'm a Ravens fan.

At least your kicker won ya that one!!!! 

Man that hurt. Watched it with my girls family of browns fans."
I appreciate Graham Gano more now
Iâ€™m a chiefs fan, by far Harrison Butker was a steal. Hasnâ€™t missed a kick and made 90% last year. He is right now the most accurate kicker in NFL history with a total percentage of 92%. Iâ€™ve seen him kick in person (Iâ€™m a kicker). He is very consistent
Dude the bengals not trash, Marvin Lewis is
My man I man panthers fan but Iâ€™m also cheering for the browns ðŸ‘ðŸ»
#BringBackPhil
You left out mmg
fuck Dallas Fly Eagles Fly
That overtime kick against the Ravens was totally blocked. Look at it. Itâ€™s got topspin. Also, mentioning Gary Andersonâ€™s miss but not the River City Relay?
GOO DAWGS
Dang dawg you were throwing dots out their
Nice video dude.
Cleveland Would Be 3-1 right now, Iâ€™m from Cleveland, shit hurt, and I wanted Tyrod To look good, kicks effected that
Im so mad from that lose againts the cowboys right after the big game
can you do if peyton remained a colt
Browns r doing pretty decent this year
Browns need my boy Pat Murray back he is a freak. Unlucky with injuries but bring back the the Monaghan Monster
"Just an idea, go back to doing some what ifs like some of your old videos. Some ideas:
What if the colts drafted Ryan leaf
What if rg3 didnâ€™t get injured 
What if the Texans actually had a quarterback (before Watson Texans fan here)
Just an idea"
"5:12 I am a Bears fan and honestly that hurt just to watch.
STUPID PACKERS!!!!!!"
@4:36 them feet were unnatural.
As a saints fan. My wife thought I was watching a comedy during week 2
Man I am a Vikings fan and that was hard to watch
my dad is friends with phil dawson
Coked out kicker outruns entire defense :-))
Who else likes that song Morten Andersen made?
When you actually are a bears fan and had to watch that dreaded play again :/
How the fuck does the browns kicker still have a job let alone make any money?
Wassup flemloraps
HOTROD! GO DAWGS!!!
Hey walker is from my Georiga dawgs!!
Hey browns draft Rodrigo Blankenship
I going to the browns vs the falcons
But I am a steelers fan
They are ok
South Dakota State represent
If anyone watches or watched Blue Mountain State, this reminds me of Harmon lmao
Congrats on being decent this yeer
Kickers being bad at kicking is one of the things I will never understand. I mean the only thing you have to practice is kicking the ball from various distances.
Go Browns Clevelander for life new kicker
Go go Vikings I feel bad for Daniel Charalson
Harrison Butker is the best in the league.
A few years ago it seemed like a field goal miss was rare, now itâ€™s considered clutch to kick a 50+ yard field goal.
Dont think I didnt notice how you but the browns logo over that outfit
I live in South Dakota the jack rabbits
Rodrigo is winning the heisman
Urinating tree face reveal
Seahawks have both advanced in the playoffs and been eliminated from reaching the playoffs because of Blair Walsh misses.
It still kills me how old fivepointvids actually is ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Last one was epic
Derek Anderson to the bills king? Whatthe no way, he wull prolly get the start! ðŸ˜³ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
Do one on Punters
Please make a video of how gruden ruined the raiders
I can kick a field goal backwards I'm trying out now.
quit speeing up that footage to make it seem like he's running faster
"DAMN

1999 nfc championship game

Yeah

DAMN"
You forgot about kickers who injure themselves while celebrating!
"my flag football team is currently 0-7
1 like = 1 prayer"
"i only like a few kickers:  The Raiders Kicker, Paul Edinger (Bears former kicker), George Blanda, and Robbie Gould.
I'm biased for the bears."
Did you see MMG
I know how you feel about the Browns and kickers KTO. I am a Vikings fan Gary Anderson and Blair Walsh make me question why we go for field goals. #bringbackdropkicks!
Cool to see Flemlo again
good lord the browns have the worst kicker ever. get rid of that fucking flop after the second game and get someone better. At least the Raiders' Kicker is a legend.
Respect the specs
"ZANE GONZALEEEEZ!!!
I would rather eat a bowl of nails w/out any milk for breakfast than have you as my kicker. PUT YOUR MUTHAFLIPPINâ€™ HEAD DOWN!!!!"
In a way, i feel slightly glad that many kickers have bad games recently because i think one of the main reason kickers are underappreciated is bcos ppl expect them to make all fg and pat so with what happen recently, fans will appreciate good consistent kicker more than ever
I miss dawson
born and raised a Browns fan. Dawson kicking in field goals during a blizzard is a thing of beauty.
Kickers are amazing. It just funny when they miss a close kick.
I miss Joey Julius.
Life long eagles fan and as much as I love Jake Elliott, I love and miss David Akers.
Well of course you and flemo dominated both of yâ€™all use to be good athletes
How do you miss 4 kicks straight
Y
T
Maybe Zane Gonzales and Daniel Carlson just needed some of that Chester Marcol booger sugar
Dude, youâ€™ve been killing it lately. Truly awesome and original content. Keep up the good work!
I love being a kicker
We Broncos fans love Gary Anderson for missing that field goal. Cause instead of Minnesota, who would have disemboweled Denver, we got an easy repeat against Atlanta.
Flemlo!!
the referee at the end used to me my dean at st. marys high school
A team canâ€™t win if they have no leg to stand on. ðŸ˜¶
So how come on an onside kick, if the kicking team gets the ball it's there possession, but on a regular kickoff, if the kicking team recovers the ball, it's considered down and the other team gains possession
Does cocaine count as a PED? Asking for a friend...
As a browns fan like you, I understand the troubles and I know that we have gone through a hard struggle, but this year and next year we have a future
What about tom dempsey
As a Titans fan, I can definitely vouch for the value of kickers. We've had some good ones over the years (Del Greco, G. Anderson, Bironas, even Succop isn't too bad), and lord have we needed them. We've had some winning seasons where they were our leading scorers, by a pretty wide margin.
As a falcons fan i appreciated the 1998 nfc championship game
Better than Peterman
"Imagine being a Bears fan" I am a Bears fan;(
Punters are people too
Everyone makes fun of kickers until they win you the game
0:50 OH HELL NAH BENGALS ALWAYS BEAT THE BROWNS WHODEY FOR LIFE BRUH
Papa MMG was there iâ€™m pretty sure
Kickers usually end up being the leading scorer for their team. I have this feeling that kickers will some day be as sought after as running backs, maybe second only to QBs. And we'll see more draft coverage of kickers and they'll be bigger stars in the league.
I Browns fan
Herschel walker is also an extreme trump supporter
I might jinx him but Eddy Pineiro might be the new Adam Vinatieri. All Gator fans loved eddy when he was at Florida because he was the only one we could rely on for points the past few years.
God I miss Phil Dawson on the Browns
1:57 all around me are familiar faces
KTO you are truly one of a kind XD. You make better content then real NFL reporters.
Daniel Carlson ... smh.. Us Auburn fans back here were watching you with such high Hope's brother. I picked you up in  all 3 of my fantasy teams.
BUFFALO VS  NY GIANTS  - wide right
Kickers are usually the most important piece in a team. They can make or break you. Ask Peyton Manning or even Tom Brady. If your kicker canâ€™t convert the extra point or kick from 40-55 then youâ€™re going to lose 3-4 games. Some games are decided by 3 or less points. Invest in kickers.
"""Why are there not 32 competent kickers in the league?""
Game theory: if the kickers become better, the coaches will demand longer field goals - which in turn lowers the success%.
In other words, about 16 of the 32 NFL kickers are by default below average."
Urinating tree revealed
You know you're a Brownsfan: when winning 2 games becomes "some games".
Wow that was a crazy ending, I've never seen that type of scenario before!!!
If he did coke at halftime theres no way in hell he was still feeling it in overtime. Even coke from the 80's didn't last that long.
@4:10 those shorts bro...
Herschel Walker is still a badass. 56 years old and he does MMA now. Dude still looks like hes 30.
Top 10 scorners in NFL history? Kickers.
Bengals trash lmao
Gonzalez tore his groin in the saints game and had to play through it
im a Bengals Ravens Cowboys and Titans fan
Donâ€™t forget Kyle Bambard, the NC State kicker who missed like 4 field goals and an extra point against Clemson, if he made just one they wouldnâ€™t beat them... Clemson goes on to be national champs
Bengals are not trash
0:48 oh hell no
9:15 I did that in madden
Go Browns but Iâ€™m a packer fan
Bro if I could hang out with KTO and Urinating Tree it would already be awesome
Great vid
The you should know the answer for when the stupidity of Hue Jackson will be fired from Cleveland
Hi
Hi
Hi
I was so upset when Carlson missed those kicks
Bangel trash? That was harsh man! His content is great he happens to like a team that cant win in the playoffs so what!
Zane gonzales is the least talented human on this planet.
Imagine Being A Steelers Fan Right Now Just Waiting For BOSWELL To Get It Together. Yes BOSWELL
the only reason i watched this is bc hot rod was in the thumbnail
Alabama needs to find a fucking kicker ðŸ˜ 
Jan Steneruud deserves a mention...
Please i made 3 bets for 5 10 and 5 please go to the playoffs browns!!
Not as weird as Hockey Goalies man
The browns need rod
too much kicker duds this year
S/o to Phil Dawson, longtime Browns MVP
Dude you deserve the trip. Hope you had a blast. Keep making great vids.
Lmao intro video seems like dilfer and elielitr. Camp drills
The patriots had a terrible kicker in about 1985
This video never answered one very important question--who's the Browns guy with the 1-bar and the awesome mustache?  The dude looks like a 60 year old biker.
My favorite kick as a Chiefs fan was Santos' donk heard round the world.
Morten Andersen is the only player from my country to play in NFL
5:10 I AM a Bears fan damnit!
Ya know what's crazy? Adam Vinateri's nephew is also a kicker at SDSU, and is getting NFL buzz. Adam has been kicking longer than the kid has been alive. Man the dude is old
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ when he said he snorted cocaine @ Halftime I died lmao boy was high running that TD ðŸ’€
Great video boss I usually go by ur stats and assume they right I wish I could be in shit like this
come here after watching Mason Crosby got redeemed and made game winning field goal for Green Bay
Zane Gonzales would piss me off even if I was cheering for the Saints in that game
Kto just drop kicked a field goal from about 65 with this video.
So thatâ€™s what urinating tree looks like
Iâ€™m a 49ers fan. Just lost tonight due to Crosbyâ€™s redemption. I wouldâ€™ve loved if he continued having a bad season. Ugh. Gotta tell you though, this is the greatest video anyone ever has made about NFL kickers.
We had Chester Marcol as a school speaker
The Vikings will never win a Super Bowl because their kickers can never hit a clutch fg to win or tie or to give them a bigger lead
Your videos are my fav I hope one day you run ESPN or SB Nation or bleacher report or make enough to buy them out KTO
Vinatieri broke the record
Flemlo looks like Cole from Martin
Scott playyyyyer
Best outro in all of YouTube
Go Brownies
Did you see MMG?
Did you have to show the Gary Anderson miss
Honestly it might be just the fact that some kickers are mentally strong and some are not. Once you get to the pros they have it in the back of their mind that now Iâ€™m getting paid for this if I donâ€™t perform Iâ€™m out of a job. Which might cause shaky knees and missed field goals
Notice Younghoe Koo 2:30, he was third place and was cut for missing clutch field goals.
Great vid! I'd like to see your take on something involving the Packers
Go Browns!
My boy gano hit a 63 yarder
Whos the #5 holder for the browns?
CHESTER MARSHALL, CHESTER MARSHALL LMAO!!! WOW
Flex on!
Vinnie won me my fantasy last week lol
Kickers are people too
Imagine being the high kicker. "Oh, shit! I've caught the ball."
As a cowboys fan watching Dan Bailey get cut was hard but Brett Maher is looking to be a great kicker who was undrafted and was picked up from the CFL.
I met Adam Vinateri at my elementary school in a tiny town called Northbridge Massachusetts. I was in 5th grade and I am 31 years old. All I remember is a a kid asking him a question about Vincent Brown an old linebacker and him giving an answer like" I don't know I think he was getting ready to retire before I got here." We all got signed cards of his. Imagine how crazy it is that our class got to meet him when he first got to New England. He seemed like an extremely humble guy and looked nothing like a football player in my memory of him BTW
U will never as good As any of the members of 2hype Humphrey has more clout than youðŸ˜‚
Why you got hurt me like that KTO
Wanna talk kickers KTO? One name...SEBASTIAN JANIKOWSKI! Nice vid bud, Go Stillers!
I seem to remember one of Dawson's field goals at the end of a game bouncing off the top of an upright and there was a long review to determine whether it was good or not.  Maybe around 2004-05? Anyone remember that?
Cocaine is a helluva drug
such good content bro
If you donâ€™t think us vikings fans have some sort of curse youâ€™re wrong. Gary Anderson then Blair Walsh fucks it for us then that new fuckhead loses some games for us, itâ€™s tough
No love for Tom Dempsey? the half foot kicker with a shoe filled with steel so he could kick farther?
missed opportunity to not show garo yepremian in the super bowl
Honestly what happened to kickers it used to feel like they almost never missed and now so many miss all the time I mean look at the pats kicker he was famous for not missing and now he misses a lot
Zaaaaaaane Gonzalez!!!!!!! I would rather ride with a blind Asian woman than have u as my kicker!!!!
Ayyyyye Flemlo
Finally us kickers are recognized
I'm a Vikings fan, why did I click on this video... :(
Zane Gonzalez, Daniel Carlson, Blair Walsh, Conner Barth, NICK FOLK!! PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN' HEADS BACK DOWN!!
2HYPE GANG
Put respect on Goggles name
Wow anybody else surprised about what urinating tree looks like??!!
Vinatieri... Greatest kicker of all time
"Mans said bengals suck and the says he is a browns fan lol 


Great vid btw"
That throwing form tho
Thoughts on Tyrod?
Phil Dawson, Hook 'em.
Thought he would talk bout crosby
While I always respected what the more known positions in football can do (QB, RB, WR, LB, so on), I always respected the kickers and punters as well. If I tried, the farthest I could kick a ball is 30 yards. Most can kick from 50 with great accuracy, which is a pretty amazing skill.
No wonder why mmg acts like a absolute dumbassðŸ˜‚
Matt prater the goat
"Different position but punting as Iâ€™m sure most know used to be the secondary function of quarterbacks and no one did it better than Sammy Baugh. 
Httr"
I was at the chargers buccaneers game in 2016 and that was a shit show. Lambo vs Aguayo. Who could miss more kicks?
Jon Ryan TD was crazy
How do you beat the Bears? COCAINE BITCH! LOL
CrackheadspeedðŸ’¨
And no mention of the recent and crazy Arizona-Seattle showdowns that feature ultra bizarre kicking moments
Here after Mason Crosby just hit the game winner a week after having the worst performance of his career.
Who is the asian at 2:39?
Remember watching that Dawson one live. One of the craziest moments ive seen.
I live in Cleveland it is about damn time
I saw hot rod so I clicked
Anytime that song with the siren u know something crazy about to happen.
I wish I had the skill and "cool as ice" nature to be an NFL kicker, could you imagine doing basically nothing the whole game and then 3 seconds left you're called in to win the game?
KTO why did you have to mention Gary Anderson? :'(
Man this video seems even more relevant now after Crosbys shit game last week and redemption this week
SOUTH DAKOTA BABYYYYYYYYYY
As a vikings fan watching that pains me
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
Whatâ€™s the Outro song ?
â€œKickers on kocaineâ€
Fun one I think of as a chiefs fan is Santos game winner against Denver 2 years ago on Sunday night
I got a kick out of watching this video.... (Except for the ad plug)
Mmg ahhh did u see him kto
4:35 LOOK HOW LONG THOSE FEET ARE
Yes, yes they are
How do you make a video on kicker and not mention Justin tucker
:48 "bengals trash" edit had me rolling @KTO
2:30 peep younghoe koo
Keep up the good ass videos
Our kicker in highschool literally never came to practice, smoked weed constantly. Dropped 50 yrd fgs in his sleep though. So yeah. That was nice
BRAVO!
Great video
Mark moseley wasnt a kicker he was a football player that kicked, when he was in college he played qb and linebacker as well as handling kicking, and he was the redskins scout team qb, that man was a football player
Zane Gonzalez is the new blayer Walsh
And after what Mason Crosby just did
Whos the really old browns kicker? the one with the white mustache at 5:02
Bring back straight-on kickers, and drop kicks and things will get interesting
Jesus what is with the Vikings and kickers
2:32 laclan on the left
I saw MMGâ€™s video of the Seatgeek trip but didnâ€™t see you in the video. I love both of you. I just wondered if you guys met.
Where's Garo Yepremian?
KTO with another banger
You have no idea how many high school games I lost on one field goal alone.
Coming from Akron Ohio .... itâ€™s tough not having Phil Dawson when the browns really need him
Kickers are underrated. For example they can end up being your most consistent scorer in fantasy lol
"B e n g a l s
T r a s h"
Iâ€™m a Viking fan and we have always struggled with finding kickers
Calling it Crosby misses
Iâ€™m a kicker, and itâ€™s not as easy as it seems tbh... itâ€™s actually really hard
Way to end  a Monday A kto video perfect ðŸ˜´
Phil Dawson better get into the Hall of fame
I watch flemlo too
Finkle!!!!
Kickers finna get PAID watch...at least the â€œgoodâ€ ones
Feel so bad for that saints kicker (can't remember his name but was one of best in history as 3rd leading scorer in nfl )that missed the pat after the crazy and only successful lateral TD as time expired losing the game wich knocked them out of playoffs surprising he wasnt mentioned in this video
Where is mmg?
Only the browns lol
Phil Dawson was a goat
What about the Jets punter that played QB?
No mention of mason Crosby
As a baseball player I dont play football but I kick to get a chance to play(without injury)
Mason crosby missed 4 straight in a game against the lions was hard to watch
Needed to put the panthers 63 yard field goal in
FlemLo crushing that food ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Justin Tucker the goat
Iâ€™m a die hard raiders fan but Iâ€™ve always had some love for the Browns
The field goal to beat ravens this year was the most Cleveland like field goal ever
Adam has the most points now for a kicker or all time. He did it couple weeks ago
FLR, UT, 5PV and KTO playing flag footbal?! I would've killed to be there
All Day ðŸ˜…
Dude you probably could make calculus interesting
I remember watching that field goal at the end live. At the time field goals were not something that could be video reviewed (which is why the ref said "after further discussion"), which they fixed in the following offseason.
My boi flem
Lol phil dawson a god
That shit hurt. Browns should be 4-1.
"Question. I dont know this might br stupid. Is it Mandatory for the kicker to have like those steps back to kick the football? Or can you stand closer to the holder and do it?
Been watching football but I dont know this."
You forgot the half foot kicker. Mr Tom Dempsey
Best video yet.....haha
That mike Nugent kick vs the Seahawks was crazy
Kickers are one of a kind but KTO is one of a kind youtuber
I respect you kto being a browns fan takes a lot but donâ€™t worry the Cardiac kids are upðŸ’ªðŸ¾ðŸ’ªðŸ¾ðŸ’ªðŸ¾
Highly underrated Channel you just earned a sub
Dude thatâ€™s sick that you got all that
"This video is a work of art! What a great topic to talk about. It seems almost taboo to even bring up because you NEVER hear about it on national tv. 

Amazing video bro! This was a lot of fun to watch as a fan!"
papa meags
That packers play just ruined my night
as a fellow Browns fan, GOD BLESS PHIL DAWSON. holy trinity of post â€˜99 Browns: Joe Thomas, Josh Cribbs, Phil Dawson. Phil won us games on multiple occasions
Flemlo with the Bengals jersey lol
ALL DAY
You deserve waaaaaay more subs
GO BROWNS!!!!
Do a video on Lyle alzado
KTO I was just rewatching Joe Thomasâ€™s retirement speech and he talked about that Dawson kick. He said he thinks itâ€™s the only time the browns won in that stadium while he was playing for themðŸ˜‚
Yes one of my favorite youtubers is in the lefty gang
0:08 I think this is urinating treeâ€™s face reveal?
What's your outro song
Imagine being a Chargers fan. Weâ€™ve missed playoffs and lost multiple playoff games including the AFC championship because of missed kicks. I would be willing to trade 2 first rounders for a consistent kicker at this point.
"Varsity football practice got me so tired 
Im a right guard"
While my broncos have really SUCKED the past few years... at least we have a solid kicker in Mcmanus. If we need a game winner we can trust him
Not enough guys named Chester anymore.
"You should do a video on Pete Gogolak: The kicker who changed EVERYTHING.

You should also do one on Ray Guy: The only Punter in the Hall of Fame."
zane gonzalez thought it was soccer
How likely do you think that Daniel Carlson gets signed by another team
I honestly think kto is hilarious but i dont like how we said tht bengals were trash
Yes Vikings fans did feel that same wayðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­Minnesota boy here
Damn KTO is SLINGING that pill
Flemlo raps anyone
Matt Bryant needs some love tho
Iâ€™m glad somebody knows who Rodrigo Blankenship isðŸ˜‚ Great video KTO you never fail to keep me entertained.
Great video. I had no idea a kicker has been MVP
"I know your not a hockey channel... but goalies are the same way! Truly one of a kind and some very weird! 

Your Chanel is amazing, excellent editing, superb narrating & top notch content."
Please do a video on fotu leiato aka â€œthe huddle legendâ€ (his huddle highlight tape had over 1 million views.
My main question is why woman donâ€™t play in the NFL
Hey just FYI Zane had a groin injury and never shouldâ€™ve been out there kicking in the first place, and Iâ€™m a browns fan because of him, he went to ASU the college I follow.
You've done it again! Great content!
Canâ€™t relate.
:51 are u mad were better than u
Yo mmg was there
aye papa was there
Special teams like special ed.
I heard Hershel Walker in a video about kickers and knew what was about to go down. The fastest man alive was going to make an appearance.
KTO is beast he make the best vids!!!
Go Georgia Bulldawgs!!!!!
I feel you too my dude. Iâ€™m a browns fan too.
Why did you stop showing your face?
How u make a video about kickers but not mention the goat Blair Walsh?
Go over the top ten players in 2009 nfl draft like you did with the 2006 nfl draft
Iâ€™m a ravens fan so that last part hirt
Never talk about Zane Gonzalez again please. He went to my high school and I love him.
Plz fuck right off seat geek
FlemloRaps steals content. Fucking scrub.
Letâ€™s go seat geek sponsorship
Wasnt MMG there
Lmaoao you would put Georgia's kicker on the thumbnail
Blankenship is wild af much love for that dude
As a ravens fan, im glad we got tucker
Iâ€™m wondering why they cut Ross Martin (kicker who was cut in preseason)
I really miss Phil dawson
Alabama fans know what it feels like being traumatized during special teams
Are we just gonna ignore how long that dude in the middles feet areðŸ¤£
Did you see MMG there
Donâ€™t u dare talk about the goat hot rod
Where is MMG
Please try to upload more I would really like if you would!!
Did you meet mmg
"I kicked in high school and I have to say compared to other field skills it was a bizarre learning curve. As the placekicker and qb3 I had no illusions as to my real role on the team: I helped the meatheads with homework and learning the playbook. The most fun years of my youth.
Great video, mang."
Ktos 'theme music is legendary and perfect for every video
Pet peeve of mine. Gary Anderson did not lose the Vikings the NFC championship, he did not cost them the game. There were over 2 minutes left in the game and the Vikings had a 7 point lead. The Vikings defense chocked and their offense couldnâ€™t move the ball anymore either. That kick would have made it a 10 point lead making it much more difficult yes, but itâ€™s not like they were suddenly losing after he missed.
Looks like Gonzales used to kick for Alabama.
7:48 what's the song? It's a BOP af.
It was great to see be a Baller for a Day in a Suite! Good Stuff KTO!
Who is the Browns guy in the thumbnail?
Blankenship is a GOAT
Add me on snap: corymcgee04
What about the 3 college kickers who wore the jersey # 100? (I believe one of them played for WVU and another for Kansas sometime in the 60s)
I feel so bad for Zane Gonzalez.
Karsten = Tom Brady
Go dawgss
Real quick on the coked-out kicker... If he did coke at halftime, and that play was at the end of the game, or anywhere in the 4th quarter even... he was definitely NOT feeling it. Unless he did a completely insane amount. That shit wears off in a half hour tops. Which makes that play even more impressive, since he was more likely crashing.
Great video! I love your channel. Keep up the amazing work ðŸ˜€
Shut up I wear goggles and Iâ€™m started wide receiver so shut up
Was MMG there
0:07 picture of 4 G.O.A.T.s right here. No seriously I'm subbed to all 4 of u guys. Ur amazing and keep up the good work.
I didn't know Hulk Hogan kicked for the Browns
Just jealous of tucker lol
Phil Dawson is my teams kicker now and heâ€™s not that good
Go dawgs I saw hot rod on thumbnail and couldnâ€™t help it
Frick you Bengals don't suck
You met Tree and Five Point? Man, if only you could also meet ThatsGoodSports/Brandon Perna, the best sports analyst in the world and a Broncos fan like me. You, Perna, Tree, and Five Point are the GOAT's.
Kickers are people too, except Roberto Aguayo and Blair Walsh we can make fun of them all we want
"Great video, dude.

Seriously though... what's with the Browns and kickers?

Also, Mark Moseley, the only kicker to win the MVP, also kicked for the Browns. He kicked a GW against the Jets in 2OT the 1986 Divisional Round... after missing a chip-shot 27-yarder in OT."
You beat us in OT (coming from a Baltimore Ravens Fan, Go Tucker)
Saw Blankenship... clicked
I remember seeing that Browns kicker and thinking not only is going to be out of a job, but that he was probably getting death threats before he even got on the plane home.
Yes, yes we are weird but weâ€™re proud of it
Lowkey coulda ended it with the Chris Davis kick return
Mmg
Did u see mmh
ha Roberto Aguayo
What about that dude with the foot problem and the weird boot, Tom Dempsey I wanna say  was his name
As an actual bears fan that clip just made me pissed
I watch urinating tree, flemlo, and 5 point. and of course yours
Blankenship will be the GOAT in 20 years watch
Oh, you think you have kicking problems? #boltup
that last FG you mention was the weirdest thing. As a Ravens fans all I can remember is that pretty much all of Baltimore's players were heading the to the locker room if not already there when the decision came in. So they had to re-dress and get ready for OT. Also no mention of Tucker who is an opera singer, Place Kickers are truly... eccentric hahahaha
Justin tucked and Adam viniteri both went undeafyed
You're not going to talk about success stories like Tucker or Viniteri
Your intros keep getting longer and longer
Iâ€™ll be honest I donâ€™t watch a lot of ur vids, but hearing u are a browns fan ! Oh man I fell Inlove. Subbed
Respect the specks
I just got Blair Walsh flashbacks(Seahawks)
Daniel Carlson won Auburn a whole game with 6 field goals and had about two on the other games each i was really disappointed when the Vikings cut him. His brothers Anders is playing horribly also at Auburn at kicker
You just not going to talk ab the 63 yard kick
Shoudn't kicker and punter be the two easiest positions to translate to the NFL?
Man I would play Madden 2005 and watch the opening video with Jeff Wilkins in it showing off his one white shoe and one black shoe. Kickers are truly one of a kind man. Dope video
You and FlemLo would have lit the field up if you played together in college
New Englandâ€™s kicker is beast
My boi Rodrigo ðŸ¤“
Respecthespecs ( Rodrigo Blankenship Georgia kicker )
freaking love this guy
The good ole Dawson bar
Daniel Carlason was probably nervous, it was his first ever game and he had pressure to do good. Iâ€™m an Auburn fan and he is GOOD
Rodrigo Blankenship mah man
Where did you get the music?
Thank god im not the only browns fab in existence
You went d1 I expected that you would show out at that flag football cmon
0:49 You gotta do your boy Flem like that bro ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
no mention of mason crosby?
I only subscribe CAuse you played in Dallas at the cowboys compound
My lil homie Rodrigo Blankenship on the thumbnail ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m not even a UGA fan... Iâ€™m a bold fan and we play them like every year ðŸ˜‚
KTO is the goat! Good content
All Day!
"kickers on cocaine"
RODRIGO IS NOT WEIRD! #fearthespecs
Mmg??
Blair Walsh all I gotta say.
There is criminally low amount of comments giving love to the all time scoring leaders sweet ass song and shorts
Did u see MMG when u went to see the cowboys?
Problem with finding a good kicker from a coaching standpoint is that it doesnâ€™t matter if they are 100/100 in practice. All that matters is if you can do it with all eyes on you. Tough job man.
You see troydanðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Flemlo represent!
Yo! It's my boi Hotrod! Also i'm not a browns fan but gonzalez is hot trash.
Letâ€™s not talk about ravens browns field goals
0:50 no
Great video, but you shoulda squeezed in 30 seconds of Garo Yepremian trying to throw a pass in the Super Bowl vs. the Redskins. :)
Are u left handed/Iâ€™m left handed
Aye KTO still got it
Did u see mmg because he was there and met Barry Sanders
7:00 Oh so that's what happened.  The announcer put the mouth on him.  "He hasn't missed in two years"  Way to go announcer.
No joke, you've got one of the best outros ever with that song coming in
Flag football lul
What no mention of wide right and the Bills?
Why was Hot Rod on the thumbnail but wasnâ€™t in the video??ðŸ˜‚
but still R.I.P to theÂ browns
Rest in peace Paul Allen. You deserved better...
did you have to put the clip of the patriots winning against the chiefs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  chiefs fan.
KTO you should check out Braden Mann from Texas A&M. Heâ€™s an amazing punter who recently caused a fumble recovery against South Carolina.
Cocaine a hell of a drug
Phil Dawson is a browns legend
I'm a Steelers fan and in that first clip of kickers missing fields goals we missed first so you have no right to talk lol.
Phil Dawson is a Browns legend

Speaking of good kickers in college I hope HotRod Blankenship can have a great NFL career
One of my good friends is Matthew Statfords 2nd cousin
Every time I see a notification from YouTube saying that you uploaded a video, I am more than happy to click on it. Youâ€™ve been uploading great content for a very long time, and I wish you would have even better success with all that work youâ€™re putting in. Keep it up.
The 80s must some shit if even the kicker was hittin the yay in the locker room ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Awesome video man
Thank you for including Rodrigo Blankenship in this video
Why weâ€™re u at the star at frisco lol
No hate at all bout you made a video about kickers and didnâ€™t talk about Justin Tucker :( Great video still
He was high on cocaine. You dick I was drinking sweet tea and I spit it everywhere
U forgot the kicker with half a foot
In the late 1980â€™s I traveled to Lawrence, KS to see my Baylor play KU. The Bears won but what Iâ€™ll never forget about that game was when the KU kicker attempted a field goal and it hit the crossbar dead center, proceeded to bounce virtually straight up and then fall barely short of the bar. From our seats near the 20 yard line, it was almost like a slow-motion replay, lol.  Iâ€™ve always loved the kicking game. Great video as always!!
I think MMG also attended that thing
that moment when you realised browns should be at least 4-2 or 5-1
RESPECT THE SPECS
â€œBengals trashâ€ lol
Thank you for not mentioning the disaster that was Russel Erxleben.  People forget that outside of the Dome Patrol and a few brilliant moments from Aaron Brooks, Saints fans haven't had a lot to cheer about since their inception.
Watch this and imagine being a bears fan, me a bears fan â€œdamn I should probably change this huh?â€ Then I didnâ€™t change it and a coked out dude ran for a TD smh
Itâ€™s good to know there is more browns fans out there it feels lonely sometimes
Only if yâ€™all young boys knew about Hershel walker ðŸ’ªðŸ˜ˆ
Kickers on cocaineðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
KTO is one of the best qbs to wear a browns shirt of all time
How dare you call my boi Hotrod Blankenship weird lol
Did you see Rodrigo Blankenship (Georgia's Kicker) Last week vs Vandy he had the weirdest field goal.
Can you do one about Derrick Thomas??? Please? Go Chiefs!
Yes
Flemlo got those hands lol
Us charger fans can relate too man :/
I was wondering if you could make a video on your thoughts on the Alliance of American Football
How just gunna put my kicker in your clickbait
â€œKickers on cocaineâ€
Great vid as always keep it up
I respect kickers, but I donâ€™t see how a kicker EVER gets hurt. I just donâ€™t understand
Comparable to goalies in hockey. Iâ€™ve never been on a team where the goalie wasnâ€™t the weirdest one on the team
You should be in the nfl my guy. You can be the hero the browns need.
You make the absolute best football videos on YouTube. A very big thank you for keeping me entertained. Seriously...who else would make an in depth video on kickers??!!! I love it!
Kto glad your a browns fan im too
ANOTHER BROWNS FAN REJOICE FOR ALL BROWNS FANS
#respectthespecs
How are all of your videos so good?
Man I hope the browns do better!
You and Flemlo should do a video together for the bengals v browns game...and maybe yall just do a lil special collab video on why ur team will win the game or the keys for your team to win or play madden with ur teams against each other..maybe make a public friendly wager for the actual game
FlemLo is way bigger than I thought he would be.
I love Adam ðŸ˜
How bout them Chargers:)
mmg was there
how can you make a video about kickers and not mention dan bailey
459th
I think that the browns kickerâ€™s brother is Blair Walsh
FUCKING HOT ROD THIS GOAT
7:02 That right there is the commentator jinx in full swing!
KTO, a truly one of a kind YouTuber. I've never been so engaged in the lives of kickers haha.
The fact you put a highlight in from SNF last night wonâ€™t get enough credit. Props KTO
KTO, later in the year make another most disappointing teams video, and teams that turned around their season
Fuck you KTO I am a Bears fan
browns fa life
finally some love for the kickers
I donâ€™t need to imagine being a bears fan I am one
Videos dropping like crazy. Love it man
As a Saints fan for life that week two game belonged to the Browns. I remember chanting before the kick â€œheâ€™s gonna miss it. Itâ€™s the Brownsâ€ out of sarcasm, but woah I wasnâ€™t ready for that. That sucked.
Im a simple football fan, see Rodrigo "HotRod" Blankenship, I click
Iâ€™m going to write a book called â€œKickers on Cocaine.â€
Kicker lives matter
"""See this game and imagine being a Bears fan.""

Vietnam Flashbacks of being a current Bears fan and seeing them loss

""SKIP!"""
Nice video
My dad is a Vikings fan and he remembers that game and hates when he hears about it
another great video
What about the man himself, Young Hoe Koo?
ya mom is maybe straight
Eagles fan here while he became an instant legend last year with the 61 yard game winner against the Giants still have to hold my breath every time Jake Elliott kicks a FG or Extra Point because he's had some misses too.
I'm a huge ravens fan and I was mad that we tipped the kick and it went in but Browns put up a good fight
This video comes out two days after Kirby Smart try to get Rodrigo Blankenship to run the ball on 4th and 9 after a fake punt... It didn't work
"I have to admit...that's a pretty nice little gift via your sponsor...I'm impressed they would do something like that...I haven't been to a sporting event in years but I promise I will check them out if I do...

Semper Fi!!!"
Carlson sucks
8:10 Yeah that one time Auburn won after returning a missed field goal to the end zone clinching the SEC West in front of their home fans
Mason sucks too man.... I lost my shit when Green Bay played Detroit (I'm a cheesehead). It was awful
Five points sounds way younger than what he looks. This is the first time I seen him.
Imagine being a vikings fan....
Urinating Trees dad is big ben. Big Ben raped trees mom that's why he hate big Ben and calls him fat fuck. True 100% facts
Ya, itâ€™s like when you have an absolute DOMINANT team but somehow have a worse kicker every year
"This hurt. As a Ravens fan. This hurt. 

Good video though"
bengals trash
papaaaaaaa
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. Thereâ€™s too many kickers who canâ€™t handle pressure compared to those who can
"â€œI have never been so unsettled watching a special teams unitâ€
I bet he made this before the Packers-Lions game"
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. Thereâ€™s too many kickers who canâ€™t handle pressure compared to those who can
You forgot to mention the Clef Foot Kicker.  He kicked straight-legged, had a custom boot for his kicking foot, and because of the way his foot was deformed he was dead accurate kicking straight-footed.
You fuckin labelled flemlo Bengals trash im dead that was so funny
Go browns! Iâ€™m from NE Ohio
â€œWeâ€™ve seen kicker on cocainâ€ ðŸ’€
Lol bengal trash that had me dead
I'm a Steelers fan, can't wait to see y'all next week
Urinating tree looks like ben roethlesberger
We need a new kicker for the bears
The browns kicker  went to my high school and I fill ashamed but at least he was good enough to make it
Hop off my man Hot Rod... only UGA fans would put this ^^^
Please do a video on why vontae Davis retired at half time
"KTO youâ€™re such a great youtuber








Now that heâ€™s not looking the browns suck the ravens are better"
This is awesome
You missed the kicker with half a foot who had a rule made for him.
it's weird to think that the browns should be 5-1 if they had a decent kicker
"I guess you can say every dawg has its day 








I will see myself out now ðŸš¶"
Pat Mcafee was on the Rich Eisen show last week and said himself kickers aren't football players. They're mindset going into each play is different compared to any other position during a game.
I love my kicking brethren.
You've got such a great feel for this. Can't believe a network hasn't recruited you yet. Or maybe they have.ðŸ˜®
Nice
Dude Iâ€™m subbed to Flemlo too!
What college did Hershel walker go to
Holy shit that dude running that kick in coked out of his mind is hilarious
Favorite youtuber
Lol KTO and Flemlo at a Cowboys game wearing Browns and Bengals gear
Underrated YouTuber
You should talk about fair catch kicks and drop kicks
Yo can you do a video on concrete charlie
Whatâ€™s the song at the beginning?
Kick 6?
Any ideas on why great college kickers are so bad in the NFL?
Is it just me or have kickers just sucked in general this year, in college and the nfl?
Kto the goat
Best edits ever ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Barefoot? Ouchie
Stop shit talking the players who have the most pressure on them at all times
I knew you were gonna do something related to that browns saints game the second i saw it happen ðŸ˜‚
MMG recently released a vid at the same place. I was trying to look closely at the 7 on 7 game but couldn't find. @MMG
lmfao now you know how us chargers fans have felt the last 2 seasons ROFL âš¡ï¸âš¡ï¸ðŸ¤—
Well, on the bright side, they have this in common with Alabama.
is everyone just going to ignore the fact that a kicker made a TD while high on cocaine?
â€œbengals trashâ€ðŸ˜‚
"Bengals Trash"
Browns, draft Rodrigo "4 eyes" Blankenship.  You won't regret it, he is legit great
Dan Baley used to be the most accurate kicker before his injury
You mean you got a chance to go to Arlington.
Zane is from my high school smfhðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
0:06 AAAAAY ITS URINATING TREE!!!!!!!!
browns beating the ravens was fake news
Mannnn your disrespect my bengalsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"â€œImagine being a bears fanâ€
I am one"
Hot rod!
Nice vid man keep making them!!!
Lol 0:05 edited browns merch
Was that Georgia I saw? ðŸ˜‚
Carlson won it (he's middle)
blankenship is a god
I don't understand why soccer players are not used more for this? In the NFL Europe Manni BurgsmÃ¼ller had quite the career as a kicker after being a soccer pro.
Adam vinetari is actually the all time scoring leader.
Bengals Trash!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
bengals trash
Did you see mmg
Rodrigo Blankenship is a physical specimen
Papa mmg was there to and a kicker
Iâ€™m a kicker a punter and a linebacker for my city league team and a quarterback wide receiver linebacker and cornerback for my middle school team and out of all of those kicker and punter are my favorite
The GOAT behind Adam is Matt Bryant
Yooo that's a way better look at UrinatingTree
ZANE GONZALEZ I WOULD RATHER TAKE HIDE AND SEEK ADVICE FROM ANNE FRANK THAN HAVE YOU AS MY KICKER. PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN HEAD BACK DOWN
Tree has the athletic ability of Homer Simpson and looks like Big Ben's younger brother
Your amazing KTO
Shouldve mentioned Jason Hanson since he experienced 2 decades worth of kicking
Maybe Gonzalez is cursed by his number look at other flops that wore that number Tim Couch, Johnny Manziel.
Iâ€™m a browns fan cause of u
meanwhile Jason Myers goes 7 for 7 for the Jets.
I love your channel kto :)
Hot Rod Blankenship and Herschel, damn good Dawgs! Go Dawgs!
Hi person to lazy to skip ahead in the video
As a bears fan, kickers are gay
I go to school with both of Phil Dawsons kids
Cool video
It's good win still win the head to head record  of all time plus remember 2015 when we won on a miss field goal and we returned it,  good times.  Don't worry we will get you
I was hoping u would talk about Rodrigo Blankenship, the greatest kicker of all time
Will never understand why the Pats didn't hold on to Vinatieri.
KTO=ðŸ
yo man where the browns "Hard knocks" review i thought you were doing?
Saw Scott player on the thumb nail and clicked immediately! Also KTO you doing a video vlog of the Dallas trip like UT?
As a Bama fan this is true lol
favoite team is batimore
Rip
Yo man... where is the Browns
I hate to now because  I am a raven
Kickers on cocaineðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Chester Marcol proved that the White kept him hyped!!
You shouldâ€™ve said something about nick folk
Rodrigo Blankenship sounds like the most Madden-generated name I've ever heard
Zane Gonzalez missed kicks from the east, to the west, back to the east, baaaaaacccck to the west
Try being a Bama fan, we can't find a kicker to save our lives.
"0:09
What is the name of that song?"
Mmg
Rodrigo on the cover â¤ï¸ðŸ–¤â¤ï¸ðŸ–¤
Happily, as a Ravens fan we have Tucker.
Was papa there? Or known as MMG
Who actually dislikes KTO videos??
whats your intro song?
You should do biggest NFL jumps of all time.
my dad
Ahh kickers...
Damn, you are so awesome man, keep up the great work
Hot rod
Any real Browns fans know Phil Dawson is the GOAT
Who's the kicker with the handlebar mustache. I must know.
"Oh man sometimes middle of the pack kickers will hit some ridiculously long kicks 
(Andrew Franks 2016 @Buf)
Or the fact Cody Parkey has literally been winning Miami games since 2016 and he was only on the Dolphins for the 2017 season
(16â€™ CLE @ MIA, 18â€™ CHI @ MIA)
Kickers are really crazy at times and you canâ€™t really judge them because they will continue to surprise"
Back when Phil Dawson was actually good
KTO's Flag Football team > Entire Bucs Team
What's up Karsten Mayfield? Tree says hi.
As a Raven fan let me tell you The KICK-SIX was waaaaay Better ðŸ˜‚
Phil Dawson was the greatest kicker the Browns have ever had!
Glad you came to my hometown!!! Hope you enjoyed downtown.
KTO youâ€™re such an awesome YouTuber.
As a georgia fan, Rodrigo is my favorite Georgia player all time.
"I immediately thought of you for both of those heartbreaking browns games earlier this year lol

As an FSU fan it's weird seeing how bad Aguayo turned out as it just seemed like he couldn't miss in college. His younger brother is currently really struggling, so maybe he'll be good in the NFL? Seems to be how it works heh"
Don't say the Bengals suck you freaking idiot in then i will unsubscribe to you and plus they suck and if you even think they're going to win the Super Bowl you thought wrong cuz you're dreaming a little bit too big
Being a Browns fan canâ€™t be easy or fun. But if it makes you feel better, Iâ€™m a die hard Lions fan. We share an unfortunate record together. But true fans donâ€™t care about their teams records. Youâ€™re a fan no matter what
You look like a npc form bully
BRUH MY TEAM 0:49
The refs are still against us!
Who else is here before 1000000000 views???
Kto is my dude
will you make a vlog about the trip like UrinatingTree?
Iâ€™m a bears fan but that was bad ðŸ˜”
4:18 until Vinatieri breaks it in a few weeks
The dislikes are kickers
Memphis is a kicker factory, between Stephen Gostowski and Jake Elliot theyâ€™ve got two guys with a ton of power #stripeup
KTO you forgot one kick. Georgias PAT when Rodrigo Blankenship stopped and made it.
Yo you you should do a collab with MMG now that youâ€™ve met him
Justin Tucker is the kicking GOAT
The 1980s: still proving that cocaine made everything you like happen
Ive never seen a channel more loved and appreciated more than KTO. Great job on your videos dude. Keep it up.
Was mmg there?
I know you get music from Epidemic Sounds, but does anyone know the song titles of some of the songs he uses??
John Madden jinxed the f*ck out of Gary Andersen
What about crosby
"Hey KTO. 

Can you do a video about Non-Americans playing In the NFL? I would like to see It one day."
KTO, your videos are awesome dude.  Keep up the good work!
"We can't really trust kickers anymore. 




I even worry when Dan Bailey goes out on the field."
Did you meet MMG?
Im a kicker and I love it. The anxiety is real, but in the end its fun
KTO has been in the facility with MMG
"Nate Kaeding has a nickname when he played with the Chargers






Kicks Ass Except During Important NFL Games"
Kickers are people too
Last winning season the browns have had 2007 10-6 never forget my guys Derek Anderson jamal Lewis kellen Winslow and Braylon Edwards... but thatâ€™s back when the browns had one of the best special teams units in the league with cribbs Dawson and zastidul
Ahh kickers the nerds of the team
hell just watch the 57 yard kick matt bryant made against the buccaneers that ended up with HAMSTRING INJURY to see how important kickers are
5:47 fucking evil
Such good editing, always much respect KTO
That ending was actually insane
HELP WANTED:kickers
Browns really need to draft a new kicker
Wait@kto, were you there at the same time as MMG?
what position holds the ball for kickers
KTO to replace blake bortles
Dak
Apparently Zane was playing with a torn groin against New Orleans
Karsten rodgers
Dark to the future
The Browns' kick 6 is one of my all time favorite plays. LOL
Loved the video
I live in dallas
If you want the black guy with dreds youtube itâ€™s flemloraps
Punters are people too...
Gary Anderson still haunts us today
You see Rodrigo Blankenships extra point a few weeks ago when the holder bobbled it and Hot Rod stood there and stepped back a foot and just swung his leg and made the extra point? That was some impressive stuff.
You were there too? I was watching UrinatingTree's video...he's great! :3
Kickers are people too
You played flag football with a Bengals fan and a yinzer? Does seatgeek exclusively sponsor fans of the AFC North or something?
Kickers are the deciding factor between a couple games every yr for teams... just this past weekend, a chip shot 37 yard miss by Washington cost them the game vs Oregon and basically ended their season
Heyyyy any got football practice today
Mmg went there to check him out
Bro the game is fixed
Rodrigo Blankenship is a god
You didnâ€™t even mention the only 1st round kicker. Smh
Do a vid on your thoughts or criticism on roughing the passer this year
Adam Vinny best kicker ever
The picture of them in Dallas, is one of the greatest photos, that I thought Iâ€™d never see, it was honestly beautiful
The Moral of the story is cocain is one hella a drug
Not as bad as the Vikings ðŸ‘ðŸ»
should have shown rods no run up kick
I miss Phil in Cleveland. The only bright spot on the team for years.
I know special teams players rarely get in, but Vinatieri should be in the Hall of Fame when he retires. IF he retires.
This was a fun video
"Zane Gonzalez!!!! I would rather be best friends with Nichole Brown Simpson than have you as my kicker!!!

Wait wrong channel..."
Morton and Gary Anderson are actually brother's in that Vikings Falcons 98 game!
Do a vid on Herschel Walker because as a Georgia player I don't think there was a better player in college football history
Adam vinatieri is my friends uncle
ðŸðŸðŸðŸ
I wanna 1v1 KTO one day. I just wanna see if I can man coverage you lol.
Nice vid, I'm kicker in my junior football league
YYEESS AANNOOTTHHEERR VVIIDDEEOO
That feeling when the browns should be 5-1
Get him more subs
â€œyouâ€™re only as good as your kickerâ€ tell that to alabama!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Thank god the Browns got rid of Zane Gonzalez
Wait thats really 5 point vids, damn
You know he had to do it em
KTO You a goat. I am a razorback fan and its been tough the last 8 years, but we had a kicker named steve little who kicked the farthest field goal in ncaa history.  The story that happened with him was so sad.  He became a parapelegic the night after he got cut from an nfl team.  No one here will remember that unless they are 40+ years old but it was a different era
Yeesss! KTO uploaded, you know it's a good day
as soon as i saw blankenship on the thumbnail i clicked, that man is the real goat
"Tree, Five point, KTO and Dallas Cowboys all in one (I saw UTs video earlier about the trip)

What kind of paradise Is that and how much are the tickets? And can I find them on seat geek? ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥ðŸ's"
Bruhhh seatgeek gave you the hook up. Looked fun as hell
I wish I could've played football with flemlo and kto
Make a video on Dick Butkus
KTO > Mariota & Carr
THE GODS OF SPORTS YOUTUBE
Calling â€œOvertimeâ€ â€˜Sudden Deathâ€™ is so much cooler
Where my boys from SOUTH DAKOTA AT?!?!?!? SDSU 4 LIFE!
I actually canâ€™t believe you made a kicker video and didnâ€™t mention Justin Tucker
One of the best channels on YouTube the absolute best football channel
Why'd you have to do this to me
Got to respect Adam vinatieri
Iâ€™m a bears fan =( this week against the phins shouldâ€™ve been a W
Kto is a BOSS
As a Vikings fan all I can say is that I'm glad you didn't put Blair Walsh in here too
Holy cow this is the best video Iâ€™ve ever watched on YouTube ðŸ‘
Was mmg there
Iâ€™ve been watching u for a while now and realized I wasnâ€™t subbed till now but I just did
The nfl Ball is bigger than college which is why they have a harder time kicking it imo
Video so fresh, he has Gostkowskiâ€™s game winner from last night.
Weird vid but still cool
Mason Crosby 1-5
Did you really have to bring up Gary Anderson?! And CARLSON?!!! WHY NOT JUST RUB IT IN FURTHER AND BRING UP WALSH TOO?!?!?!? STOP TORTURING US VIKINGS FANS WITH OUR LONG HISTORY OF KICKERS CHOKING!!!!!!! ITâ€™S CRUEL!!!!!!
Only the Browns. Haha
Hot Rod the god
Now punters
they should have 4 point kicks for 60 yards just to encourage people to do that
The Washington kicker saved the day against my Oregon duck hahaha
Cool
Thank you for not ending this with Blair Walsh.
Kickers are the goaltenders of football... except less athletic.
You should make a full video on the kicker that on mvp
Thought graham gano was in here with the 63 yard field goalðŸ˜‚ panthers fan
i love your vids keep up the work ðŸ˜ i am going to ude your code for seat geek for the detroit lions game when i go to one again browns are doing  good in my books this year keep up the good work ðŸ‘ðŸ™Œâ˜º
not having janikouski in the vid is a shame
"YEAAAAHHHHH IM NO QUITTER 

Someone pls continue"
Kto in his videos sounds like a dude who is like Andrew luck but when ever he's actually talking about football he just shit posts endlessly. He is amazing.
Kickers hate the vikings
Dicker the kicker
GOAT
Please no not Gary Anderson KTO :(
I'm a simple guy if I see a KTO notification I'm clicking
What was with players in the 80s and 90s making songs and having songs about them? The eagles and the fridge both have songs.
Kickers score more points than QBs.... think about that!
About time you did a video on a kicker haha
can you guys check out my stud or bust on bryce love i tried rly hard om in but its not doing very well
Kickers miss all the time! cough cough Browns cough cough

Robbie Gould was the goat tbh.
Hmm  a browns and yinzer fan together how'd that work out
I always see seat geek but never use it
I seriously hope that KTO has a collaboration with Flemlo Raps and maybe even The NBA Storyteller one day tbh.

Hello
