"GOPRO HOCKEY IS BACK! (sorta) 

Hoping to join some more tournaments so I can continue to make gopro ice hockey videos for you guys <3"
2:33 check out that guy on the benches numberðŸ˜
Nasher did you play any college hockey
i'm form sweden and i'm 13 years old and really enjoy your hockey videos! keep going man! <3
Soo, who're the pros?
JC is a great player. Seen him play a couple time when he played against my Orlando Solar Bears
better be careful with that GoPro at the Chillers. They definitely dont like when players use those. Even if its within the helmet. You think those refs would have noticed...

I am a baseball player looking to get into hockey, its so damn expensive, but it makes me happy.

2:35 the guys #
Nice hands
Yessssss I love these vids!!!!!!!!!ðŸ’–
Woah big beer league huh
Noice
I don't get why some people freak out about the GoPro. Who cares
GO PRO IS BACK Your the best NASHER, Nasher how do I stickhandle Better Like you
after the first goal, they just keep coming
JC is crazy
Can you guys come to my channel and watch my videos. One is about NHL 19. Might do some real hockey videos.
Why don't you go play in the echl or AHL buddy if your so good?
The difference between a good beer league player and a low level pro is honestly insane. I've played with a few buds that got drafted to the show but never cracked a roster and they're so much better than anyone on even the most competitive beer league I've played in. It's shocking to play with that kind of speed on the ice.
Didn't realize you played a little...who did you grow up playing for?
lol number 69 2:29
Played roller against JC, small world.
Way to go man, u should be in the NHL
anyone know what strategies nasher uses in HUT?
Love you videos
Yaaay it's back!!!!
Lmaoo jc
Never knew Casey played hockey
Why does his stick look curved when he's on the bench
Whos mans is number 69
My dad works for the team called the Colorado eagles who are now in the AHL but he was pretty good when they played them
You are pro
I love you
Dude you look so blazed! ðŸ˜‚
4:01 you need to be on his left shoulder and force him up the wall, he spun you because you overplayed that
Men's league hero !!
I didn't know there was a rule against GoPros in his new league, I thought that he had just stopped.
U are terrible
Nice vid
Cant wait for roller vids
Hey nash u should go with kvg hes a goalie
Put J.C on your HUT team
Yes GoPro hockey I am so hyped from r the season
I pissed that u cant do gopro any more because of that stupid rule
Do you wear a cage or visor nash?
I'm 15 years old and I get to play hockey all the time with Dainius Zubrus and Darius Kasparitis. They're insane
You had a hat trick! Nice!
#69 is a unit
Can I get a LETS GOOO
Used to watch Campagna in my hometown, Fredericton. He played University hockey on the island here in Canada, and when they came in town to play UNB, my hometown University team, he was always a standout, one of the best on that team, and in the league, no question. Fun guy to watch, guy could be so much more than he is.
Go pro hockey!!!!
Nice vid Nasher
WOOOOO
Nasher is a boss
10 bucks nasher won't pin this and if nasher livestreams I will donate 10 bucks
greasy
Yes I love these! So glad to see a new one!
Road to shutout!!!
JC was a coach at Turcotte Hockey School and he was the nicest coach there!
This surely looks like the roller hockey rink
Yay, another great go pro hockey video, can't wait for more of these and more of nhl 19 videos. Thank you. Also good luck to the blue jackets this season!

Is that Casey Neistat?
Serious question what's JC doing playing at this level? Was he friends with someone on the other team? Or was he brought in to help the white team?
JC is back! GO ALLEN! Rock your red!
Your videos are amazing
I know JC Campagna because he played for the Adirondack Thunder, a team I have season tickets for.
YES GOPRO HOCKEY!!!
Wait, so how were you able to use the GoPro??? Is this a different league
Oh yeah that was goooood
nice
We play against a team that has a sick ringer played in the Q... guy is a Class Act he steps it up and ties the game up for his team and that's it. He lets everyone else go at it after that but if they fall behind he creeps them back up again. Really nice guy
Eu sou brasileiro
For people who don't know what a ringer is, its someone who is playing wayyyy below there skill level. Mostly in beer league
I am so happy that you are able to do this again
Casey Neistat in the thumbnail?
Yay! Go pro hockey
Let's go more hockey go pro
And I'm subscribed and I hit the bell
Yes... finally go pro hockey
