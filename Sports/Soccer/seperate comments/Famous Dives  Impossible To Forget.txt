These "men" should have left their pussies in the locker room...
Where's divemar ????? i mean neymar
wheres ronaldo
the first one though
"https://youtu.be/xSLxa3MYMcw
Best dives plz watch till end"
I lost my respect for ramos
They train how to fake injuries and dive in their camp. Pussies.
1:08 lol he started laughing
1:12 not a flop, clearly got hit by the ball
Where is Ronaldo ? 😂😂 He is the dive king..goat in dives
Dives sergio ramos
GG
I guess neymar rolled-out this list
I am natural born diver
I thought the whole video would be about cristiano Ronaldo 😂
The first one he just kicked the ground instead of the ball. Decided to make it into a dive to hide the embarrassment
I'm a big fan and even a bigger critic of soccer and I often find myself yelling "get up you pussy!!!" even to the team I'm cheering for
0:45 "A fish out of water"
Dida v Celtic is worse than any of these
The game has lost the plot, simply nothing like what it was originally about and a bit of a joke now. Just a playground for little boys as puppets for rich business men.
Why are foot bowl players pussy bitches.i need answers
The 'Two hands over face' thing should be an automatic yellow as, 99.999999% of the time, it's a sure indicator of flopping.
"The king of dives is never shown because it's old, but look up Sheffield Wednesday 1 Leeds 6, in the 1991/92 season. Gordon Watson's dive to win a penalty for Sheffield Wednesday is the greatest you will ever see!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSwW1OxHTcU

49:12"
Laffertys a scumbag
To be fair I think Vidal just kicked the ground rather than dived
Thought this was a swimming dive vid
I’m actually laughing
1:11 I’m gonna see this cunt in my nightmares
Vidals was clearly a slip
... No9 against robben was also a clear penalty. He did not dive...
:281
Neymar is missing
Ronaldo dives better than all of them combined 😂😂
marquinhos kneed suarez's calf if you watch
Suarez is a big diver!!!!!
And robben did not dive
Soccer is for pussys this is proof enough. Hockey and Rugby is what men play
We need to add Griezmann in the world cup 2018 finals.
How can these pussys even be considered athletes? Pathetic
https://youtu.be/slTNlfZBQLU
"1:10 Hahahaha
What an asshole
you can clearly see him laughing at his shitty act"
Wheres neymar
Straight into the box. And then fall over. Brilliant play
Were is Missi?
David Luiz was laughing
You missed neymar who can dive anywhere
"Messi never dives" check YouTube please
He is ronaldo fan so he has not added his dive
Wtf
I hate Ramos
I know this is old but this kills me Ramos got stepped on
soccer is full of wimps.
Where are Ronaldo's Dives???He dives like twice in a match.....This is a Ronaldo fanboy channel
1:35 omg how dumb does he think we are omg
Muted the trash music
How can you do a video about football dives without Neymar and CR7 inside?
Ha no Liverpool FC dives!
Omg i cant beleive no ronaldo
What a nice joke by our penaldian friend..No penaldo dives.NICE
The ref was blind when morten gamst Pedersen did he's big dive dude he could have see it and give him a free kick or a penalty or he was just blind
Where is legend actor Moneymar??? Sorry Neymar??????
Hit a like if you think Neymar is diver
where is the dive legend neymar currently
Where’s Messi?
1:11 david luis smiling
I hate these pussies!
Wrzzer is a Penaldo fanboy that's why he didn't added Penaldo!!!😂😂😂
Every footballer has dived, expect Puyol.
where is ronaldo dive?😂😂😂
This is why America hates this excuse of a sport.
Why is this still a part of the sport?  Can't they just suspend players for this and get them to stop?
Robben didn’t flop, his toes clearly stepped on
These people should become politicians.....
Neymar's getting his own 1 hour video.
I think the first wasn't dive he hit the grass
um waht about the Neymar
no such thing as impossible to forget, doesn't matter, and can forget any no matter what
"Ronaldo is the king of divers 
Naymar is the queen of divers




Messi is the king of fair play"
Cristiano Ronaldo is famous for diving don't you know
"WHATTT DISLIKE UNSUBCRIBE" WHERES NEYMAR U MUST REWLLY LOVE HIM TO DONT PUT HIM ON HERE
Basically footballers are pussys
Flippen robben he robbed mexicans D: And I'm Mexican D: #VivaMexico
I gotta admit I'm surprised there are no Busquets clips.
1:11
Juergen Klinssmann? Most famous dive ever? Mind u it’s a Ronaldo fanboy channel therefore he knows nothing about football past 2010
Disgrace to the beautiful game. Be like messi, ronaldinho and ronaldo fenomeno. But i gotta give credit to cr7 hes gotten better and isnt a disgrace like neymar.
you can see latinos like to act! :P
that's why football is pathetic
Quit apparently soon meaning excuse switch continuing break ratio pass page convert fist.
It truly makes a boring game unwatchable. Every flop needs to be reviewed by the video ref with an automatic red card and three-game suspension for obvious acting! It has to end and so does the fans acceptance that it is “just part of the game” ... no, it’s BS!
Sergio Ramos did not dive he stept  on his  foot
where is Moses?
No neymar ?
Red cards for dives please!!! Ruining the image of football.
on 1:11 david literally smile 😯😯
You could make an entire video on Neymar alone.
Flopping unfortunately is how a large amount of free kicks are earned, even now that they allowed camera footage. If flopping were easily stopped so many more people would enjoy watching the sport. Sad to see grown adults act like that.
Where’s neymar
no Ronaldo dives?
How in the hell is nani vs. caragher not on here??
Where is Lord Penaldo..???
Ronaldo?
Robbens wasn't a dive?
Tey were all just doing the neymar challenge...
Lol where is CR7? Ahaha.
ASAP LAFFERTY WASNT AT RANGERS HE WAS AT FIORENTINA ASAP
Nowadays it's easy to make videos like that. You just add Neymar's dives and boom you have a whole video!
I think there are some reals (no dives)
Yeah, this is the most pathetic sport
Where is Bonucci vs Palermo and Ronaldo vs Celta? You Ronaldo cocksucker
I thought all of these were going to be about china doll Neymar
penaldo ass licker spotted 😂
0:42 That's just... pathetic.
2:24 was not a dive
where's Ronaldo?
#Noerapenal
He didn't put Cristiano Ronaldo he has more dives than everybody in this video
they should just put neymar on this
Music=Cringe
0:40 yeah his acting was too much but how can anyone say that was not a foul
Robin was not a dive
E dov'è quel fottutissimo Strootman?
Where is CR7
Pound rage need representation muscle southeast lay.
what about cr7 and his pool jump fan boy
Where's the legendary Neymar???
Not all of them were dives
Where is the god of diving,neymar?
But ronaldo?stupid fan boy,you suck
Sergio was true
What is this cheesy edm instrumental music on these compilation videos?
Fak barca.. barshitlona.. refalona.. catanub
These ppl should they're own meme
First one wasn’t a dive he kicked the ground which would’ve caused him to lose balance, although admittedly he did go down easily
How is there not at least one neymar clip
2:03😂😂😂😂
okey, da robben ting wasnt no dive, innit, da other twat step on his boot bruv.
Peder On croatian gay
Son of a bitchvaldo
These guys make WWE look like MMA
You can add Griezmann to the list https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrVy3FzRfs
0:42 the new neymar
So that's why Vidal hates Real Madrid, he was cheated off of a penalty back then haha lmao
Lol Vidal didnt dive in the beginning, he kicked the Ground.
The best diver neymar 2018 World cup 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
If you saw 1match in Greek super league you will see millions of dives and fake penalties and if you saw osfp you will laugh and cry
Where is neymar?
Where is Fortounis
this is why the world cannot take football seriously.
Number 9 its foul definitely...
Ronaldo Fanboy
Some of these had contact though
Vidal didnt dive
Aryan one was funny
Was expecting Neymar and Ronaldo here.
the robben one was kinda a foul tho
lmao the david luiz one
This is disgusting
Try not to laugh or grin 😂😂😂😂
No. 5wtf
I remeber when David did that and i was laughing my arse off because of that. I remember when he did a prank on Di Maria arresting him. Does anyone remember that prank.
Neymar is no1 dude
"Goalkeepers always dive.
Lucky people don’t get cards from them."
Roben got tackled... thats not called diving.
Don't forget neymar
Number 10 that guy was an asshole
You can't forget what you don't remember
1:10😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wheres moneymar JR??
9 is not a dive
what about every single game neymar has been in
This is a guess, but I think the first clip, the guy dug his shoes into the ground and he fell.
Ramos nd marcelo are þhe bigest pussies in the world
Wheres the African fella that pretended to have a seizure after jogging into kakas  back
Where is the king of dives, Neymar ?
The second one was a foal
Wheres ronaldo?
What a foolish dive by suarez
and where is jordi alba?
THE MOMENT YOU THINK IT'S ALL NEYMAR DIVING AND ROLLING damn I was not correct
Thumbs down for the mandatory 15 second ad. Bitches.
U can always tell when Suarez is faking because he throws one hand straight up and starts waving it. Never does that when he seems legitimately hurt.
What a bunch of pussies....I guess they would perform well in drama class as well.
hmmmmm madrid fan likes posting barca people dives but barely madrids
first one wasn't a dive, he just hit his foot on the ground
#two just killed me 😂😂
1:11 pause it and look and David Louis smiling
I Would Issue Permanent Off...If I was The Refree 🤔
0:48 he actually jumped what a faker a red card, if it was me who was the ref!!!
0:25
Where’s Neymar?
Lol when you forget about replay mode
I think that the barca players were swimmers before playing football...And now one has gone to Psg
Hey it's Neymbappe!
Where is Gilardino？
I think it wasnt a dive with Robben, look closer, someone stepped on his leg
Where are Neymar?
The first one wasn’t even a dive he just kicked into the floor and if you play football yourself you probably know that pain
And as far as Sergio Ramos I'm concerned, after all the damage he has done I think open season on him would be fair at this stage of the game. Cut his head off? Yellow card.
I'm okay with a player going down in the box if there is reasonable contact, rather than try and stay on his feet. But apart from that, start sending these guys off. It's bloody embarrassing. I'd hate to see them in a pub brawl.
Sergio Ramoz is just embarrassing
#famousdives
Sergio Ramos
Vidal didn't dive!
Perhaps Neymar took inspiration from the 2nd one.
where is neymar 😂😂😂😂
1:10 WTF
The David Luiz that i cant forget
In 1:08 you have to play pause n play if you want to see David smile
stupid ramos
Psg should of won tbh
0:25 wtf XDDDD didnt know this existed in football :DDD
Number 10 was not a dive
The way David Luiz looks at the camera is funny
The David Luiz one was funny
Robben's one was barely a dive
2 =dying fish
Do not forget Maradonna
The first one he hit the ground and if that happened to me I would be on the ground as well
I hope thanks to VAR players like this will get red cards in the future.
10 isn't a dive in my opinion
How is Neymar not on here 😂 He’s the king of dives
Movie with this topic without Neymar and C. Ronaldo?
wtf the third one is never a dive. ok, the reaction after the foul ist to much, but its not a dive.
Pansy parade!
Ronaldo is the best for dive
"The king of diving: Ramos
The GOD of diving: Suarez
The LEGEND of diving: Neymar"
it's missing griezmann from the WM final ;)
Most Of them are from BARCELONA LOL 😂😂😂
why do most soccer stars have retarded haircuts?
Where’s neymar
Half of these weren't dives they were overreactions
And in number 1 Neymar jr
1:10 that smile
Can I ask were the heck is penaldo
Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
How can people support this game? I mean you see these hard men that love football but I reality they are really loving all the gayness of it
this is not fake they didint dive some paranormal thing attacked them
The guy is so dramatic! Cmfl.....
Wow just wow
wtf is this garbage? vast majority of these are LEGIT. like actual fouls and no diving.... srsly wtf is the point of this?
Where is Ronaldo?
What a garbage sport
I still don't get how ramos wasn't caught with the line keeper right in front of him
No neymar?
히바우두, 외국인들이 봐도 임팩트 컸구나 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
surprised you didnt put Neymar in the world cup in..
To jest lepsze niż teatr !😂😂😂
The one thing that sux about football.
The youtuber has to be a mexican, no serious person would consider that one of the top dives
A few of them weren't dives -- they were exaggerated, but they were tackles where the defender followed through intentionally to the forward's legs.
Robben didn't dive, you blind imbecile.
Forgot about the Gilardino one
Why is there always shitty music in these videos lol besides that good vid
Back when I played soccer I didn't know all the pros did this flopping stuff.  Apparently I played the game wrong for years.
I thought this would have been 11 clips of neymar
foreigners are always at it
where is Neymar
ridiculous
The highest paid clowns in the world...
The first one wasn't a dive he kicked the ground
Im surprised they weren't all Neymar
tapped in knee OH MY GOD, MY FACE IS GONE! 😭
1:09 you can see him smiling
Barca fans right now ...this is a fake video 😅😅😅
CR doesn't make the list? Given your avatar, I smell hypocrisy.
Number 5 is not dives
Robben may have overreacted a bit but it looks a penalty to me.
Cuadrado taps on Ramos’s arm, proceeds to act like he’s broken his leg and needs and ambulance. 😞😔 disgrace.
https://youtu.be/oc600qVuo68
Divers are filmed, they should be diqualified for the next 3 games every single time they do it.
Latest from WC final - Griezemann dive
Hahaha where is penaldo?
Where’s Ronaldo at?!? Mans the MVP for diving! 😂😱
Ses le frère de naymar
Fuckin fags
Such a south American and European thing
"2:45 gets pushed in the back.... Cluches his foot.



wut"
nothing but fags and cheats . red card the cunts.
2:38 dude in white like a boss
He never dived in the first one he kicked the ground
why do soccer fans have the worst possible taste in music?
That one of robben is not a dive the another player stands on his feet
That dive from  Robben was no dive
Something wrong, it should be 11 times Neymar ...
#GriezmannLItalien #GriezmannTheItalian #Final2018
Soccer is pussies
Soccer is pussies
Soccer is for pretty boy bitches
The first one kicked the floor retard
Bunch of whores.
is a mans game full of b*tches
Where is Neymar?
These guys must all have no balls in their pants. What a bunch of pussies.
These are the people who give fuel to soccer stereotypes.
Soccer Is Good For Practicing Acting
The dive I will never forget is Italy diving against Australia in 2006
00:40 That wasn't really a dive, regardless of the unsportsmanlike behaviour, exaggerating the trip was actually a clever thing to do.
#2 is super ridiculous still
1:55 the defenders a mile away from him
Seems like being a woman (pussy) is synonimous in the comm section with being foul and weak....are you time travelers from the Middle Ages?
I think the first guy kicked the floor then fell over rather than dive
Are there efforts by the leagues around the world to try to stop this kind of behavior?
"1. Neymar
2. Neymar
3. Neymar
4. Neymar
5. Neymar"
You should put neymar
The refs need to do a much better job of enforcing this nonsense.
why only 1 barca video?
The england are the most diver
where is neymar
Everyone diving should get banned from playing forever.
sport for gays and actors
will never forget Busquet one
Stupid Ramos
Biggest pussy sport of all time these guys act like little cunts
1:10 look at his face, lol
⚽= 10% skill 100% soap opera
First one wasn't a dive. He kicked the ground
Retarded music.
Why does every soccer video have a shitty rave song.
2:21 no era penal jijosuchingadamadre :/
What a disgrace to real men all around the world! What is a disgrace to sports! These pussies should try MMA.
Sergio Ramos is the scumiest player of all time
and the oscar goes to ???
Vidal is just painful to watch
1:06 Im dead
No era penal
Surprised Neymar wasn’t on the list
Hey where is NEYMAR🤔?
You clearly doesnt know what a dive is
No surprise to see so many past and present Chelsea players.  You could do a top 100 just of that cunt Drogba.
pls like me!!!!!!
I hope after the world cup, VAR system will be used in all league games too. La liga, EPL, and all other football games
What twats
Can't top Rivaldo
"one.... just one football video without this crappy kind of music... please, somewhere???

and how could you NOT mention the mother of all dives, andy möller (borussia dortmund) against karlsruhe in 1995?"
Yeah not bad but Naymar committed 11  worse than these in the WC... Maybe make a Naymar compilation next. As the Mexican coach said, he is destroying the sport. Less acting classes, more skill and strength training.
1:08 its bad but you gotta admit David Luiz is funny
Wtf we could clearly see Robben wasnt a fake
Way to disgrace your your country’s and fellow teammates. Punk bitches lol
0:42 how is this a dive when the other player did make contact
Add Neymar and It will be actor gang forever🤑😸
Arjen roben the penalty diving master jajaja
Faking an injury is unfortunately necessary under the current system. If refs actually called fouls, it wouldn't be necessary.
If this were a top 100 dives the remainder of the 89 would’ve been all barca players...
1:10 The smile OMG
And the winner still barcelona players..
Why I don't spend time watching this sport.
why why whyyyyy ruin a perfectly good compilation video with shitty music? I'd much rather hear the audio from the games, goddammit.
Let me ask you a question, you didn't put ronaldo in this compilation because you are his dog that eats his ass, or becauss he dives every single game and you couldn't put all his dives in video because you didn't want it to be 5 hours long?
1:10 OMG..😂😂😂
"Huhhh..

These people would even Dive in a Lawn Tennis Singles match to win a point."
Pretty sure Wrzzer .......IS Ronaldo!!!!   or....Neymar .....obviously!!!!!!!!!!!     lol
Where's Ronaldo and Neymar?????  Diva? Diver? oh, make up your mind!   I think you meant bare arsed cheater and thief instead...ban the bastards!!!  = they're bringing the great game into disrepute!!!   ..shoot them with a very large shotgun.    wankers!
Would public execution be too strong of a penalty for this bullshit?
Where's sissy boy Neymar?
Well in nr 9 Robben shouldnt dive, but the other players intent seems to be bad as well since it looks like he wants to stand on his foot.
Barcelona players😂😂
This video makes me want to REALLY hit these pussies
"Dirty Ramos is in every video
Worst players, worst dives, worst fouls, what a shameful player"
Giorgos Karagounis needs to be here
Not a Barca fan, but #3 wasn't a dive, as you can see, Suarez's thigh is touched by Marquinhos
what about ronaldo!!???
your list is so biased it's a JOKE!!!! you have the biggest DIVER of all time, PENALDO on your avatar and you don't include him in the list but you include 3 Barcelona Players/???? yeah dislike video!!!
And this is why I don’t enjoy watching football :D
"Ok, so i don't know how you can call this 11 famous dives.
Adryan got hit, quite clearly, that he then starts flipping about like a fish out of water doesn't matter; it's not a dive.
David Luiz got hit, he was asking and hoping for it, so he got the free kick and a laugh; it's not a dive.
Busquets just showed bad sportsmanship, he did get hit just not where he is feigning the injury; Dickmove, but it's not a dive.
Robben got stepped on his foot. Did he go down easy? Maybe, but it's clearly stopped him from moving his left leg normally; it's not a dive.

So that's just 4 clear misnomers. Invalid title."
There was contact on Suárez. He wasn’t going to stay standing and cost his team just to keep haters happy.
For that with luiz Suarez that was not dive
sport for pussies
Neymar : hold my beer 🍺
3 minutes off the filed for any injury. Problem solved.
Looks like they was sniper target ... haha !
Imagine they're in boxing
Suarez’s dive was hilarious 😂
Thought all of them would be Neymar
Thats why the country of these fuckers didnt make it in world cup 2018.
You can easily make a top 100 dives with Cristiano!
Neymar watches this before every game lol
Football player = vagina
You forgot 100 more from Barcelona. And the Robben one was a clear penalty.
No one with an ounce of self-respect would behave in this manner. Shameful and pathetic..
Compilation of Neymars
Easily the worst sport in its entirety! Never knew there were so many people boring enough to enjoy it. iM RIGHT!
the first nibba kicked the floor tf
You clearly dont know the difference between an enhancement and a dive
"1. Neymar 
2. Neymar
3. Neymar 
4. Neymar 
5. Neymar 
6. Neymar
7. Neymar 
8. Neymar 
9. Neymar
10. Neymar 
11. Neymar"
Neymar ? :D
Where is neymar
No cr? Wow
Dive should be red card no exceptions.
Disgraceful!
Ok thats it im not watching soccer anymore
Why no dives from Cr7? Oh right, you are one of his fans.
U missed the current legend Neymar
Nothing matches neymar in fifa 2018 😂😂
We I become  a referee these guys will be getting the Reds cards
#9 was not dive. 2:20 look closely defender stepped on robben's foot.
Where are all the Ronaldo dives
This could have just been a Neymar compilation.
Neymar world cup 2018 against mexico
Hollywood mode :)
2:21 pretty sure Robben's wasn't a dive.
If Neymar was in this video he'll be the whole video
this is y i think most soccer players are a bunch of overacting pussies needing to fake hurt just to get a chance at scoring bunch bitches
Rivaldo got hurt on his face because he has a condition where if something hits his knee it actually hurts his face and if the ball hits his face it would hurt his knee just not a lot of people know about his condition
1:11 David Luiz smiling...
You’re going to need to update this vid after this World Cup. Some Olympic level diving going on. Makes Robben look amateur.
I can’t believe Neymar isn’t in this
I was thinking to my self I thought they were all gonna be from Luis Suarez!!!!
And this is exactly why I don’t like or watch soccer
OMG look at 3:08
Such shitty music turned pumped up way too high to make this video even shittier.
David Luiz...Chelseas worst player....Eden Hazard...by a mile,Chelseas best..!!
Busquets & ramos are the worst. So gay
Make 11 dives of neymar
Road to nemar
That’s not what “dive” means
Vatpikke
We’re the actor Neymar
oh those latinos
david luiz 😂
The officlas buy into them.  Replay all flops.  Suspend the officials and suspend the players.
Watched - yes. Enjoyed? You must be joking. These pricks are a disgrace to the game.
That Linesman on rivaldos dive is blind
are they teach this skill in football? lol
This is why I hate,.. Hate.. Hate... Soccer.. My 3 brothers and 2 cousins just hate it... When one of us does or says something weak.. We call him FIFA... Haha 😂 haha haha.. And we have 9 boys and 5 girls between us who all hate.. This stupid game... Weak stupid funny actors... Embarrassing game really..
This is the sport I play, but I’ve started to hate it purely because of this
How Neymar And Ronaldo Can be Miss here??😂😂
It makes me to hate soccer.
Ruin this beautiful game
Netherlands Sucks Mexico is better
First one is clearly not a dive, he hit his leg on the ground.
This is why soccer is a shitstain of a sport
this isn’t even the reason soccer sucks. it’s because of penalty kicks and useless rules like offsides.
Great video but it feel incomplete without Neymar in it. 😂
Naymar brought me here
I know its impossible but I forgot these dives.
Sissy sport
Why always this type of insufferable music
These should all be neymar😂😂😂
I can't believe these people can be paid millions to do this, lucky bastards
confirmed dive should be punishable by red card in my opinion
A crying shame that Ramos wasn't kicked in the cunt.
where is ronaldo dives he has many
First one wasn't a dive you fucks, from another angle you can see that his leg gets hit ever so slightly by nr 24, which sends his foot slamming into the ground
The first one wasnt a dive. it was a fail. he tried to kick the ball but instead he kicked the floor and tripped
neymar
Where’s Neymar
I just wish someone would start kicking these pussies in the mouth once they begin flopping.
Could make a top 50 with just clips of neymar.
0:43 then drop on the deck and flop like a fish.
This is embarrassing !! They’re “professionals” !!!
Bounuchis dove vs Palermo and girladinos five in the champions league
just embarrassing.grown men ruining the game for everybody
Diving should carry a 3 match ban, as well as a fine.
The first one was not a dive he kicked the ground
Сука-ball.
Weird... I didn't see Neymar.
Why not include Fred?
what was ramos thinking????
Lmao David Luis smiled when he fell xD
They should make a update video and add Neymar vs Mexico in the world cup
"the real shame here is that pretty much every one of these dives managed to get the other player penalized! 

whilst the diver got rewarded for it!!"
Lmfao on the first one
This sport is really for pussies
The most famous german dive is missing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vX74Ebm2nM
Totally concerned there is no sign of Ashley Young in here.... Pitiful stuff from him a few years ago.
Vidal didn’t dive he nearly broke his fuckin ankle
you forgot to add all of this dives too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViiTr8WNuYM
70-80% by Latin players...
No Danny Alves?
Always the utmost awfull music when it comes to football videos smh 😅
Add Naymar to this in the match against mexico please!!!!
#NoEraPenal
Half of these aren't dives though.
1:10 bruh look at that fuckin smile on Luiz's face
Biggest problem in the sport right now. Bunch of shameless pussies willing to debase themselves and bend the rules to win dirty. Pathetic.
Where's Gaymar?
I love you VAR
I smell a presence of Ronaldo fangay somewhere over here :D These are not even "funny" when u get used to Ronaldo diving skills class :DD
Vidal kicked the ground tbf
No. 8 deserves a red for that dive
sad behaviour by "men"??????
Oh god he just touch my shoulder then my head is hurt so much
Wtf Vidal dive xdd
David Luiz one made me laugh
There should be an award for "best diver" there would be ronaldo, neymar and suarez
Half of these werent even dives...
Wow, I didn't know they taught the Stanislavski method in football school.
You’re missing harry Kane on here.
Knew some butt hurt wanker would put Robben vs Mexico in there. It was a penalty. Yes, he made the most of it and he is a renowned diver. But he was still impeded in the box.
Beautiful game my ass........
They should get instant red card for this unsportman conduct.
Arjen Robben whas not a dive, look at the top point of his shoe when he falls
Soccer and basketball.... just can't take them seriously.
Naymar is gonna make this list if he keeps up his nonsense
Could've just called this Brazil highlights
Robben had to dive because he knew the Dutch couldn't beat them. He's the person I like to call a floppy seal
Did anybody know that P. Pogba is long lost twin of D. Drogba?
Where is neymar?
at 1:10 luiz is laughing
@1:09 cuteness overloaded !!
No Neymar, No Ronaldo, no like
Neymar-------
Neymar vs México
Hell na that David luis smile looks straight out of a horror movie
Where is neymar and Ronaldo ?
@1:10
I’d love to see one of these pussies get a career ending injury from flopping like a little bitch.
SMFH!?!
Neymar should have went into swimming with his diving skillz
"do these people take a day of acting clases 
its like there reflexes are too fast 
they get touched by another player they dont even think of falling they just do it ...
..Incredible"
Glad I'm not a football fan;  what an embarrassment to sport, lol
Pussies
That smile of david luiz
1:09 Hahahaha
Out of curiosity has a player ever been red carded because the opposition dived so decided to make the simulation real by ensuring the diver got some studs dug into his legs at least? :-/
on the suarez one the player clipped his calf
If its not a combat sport, its a pussy sport, rugby, american eggball, bascketball, baseball, tenis, diving, all pussies.
arjen robben was not a dive i think . it looks like the defenders foot was on his foot
Why isnt neymar the top 1
I already forget half of them
1:07 DAVID LUIZ EVEN SMILED AFTER GOING DOWN HAHAHHA MF
Me trying to fake being sick and peeping if my mom is buying it
Lol robben was not even diving
now u can put neymar and he will have all the top 10 spots
Neymar is the king of DIVING
and1:50 sergio has laught
ROBBEN DID NOT DIVE, HE EXAGGERATED BUT IT WAS STILL A FOUL 🇳🇱
1:50 peekaboooooo
I love football, but the culture could really take a hint from hockey and other contact sports when it comes to diving
They need to clean up the flops and dirty plays with instant replay. Football needs to modernize
Pussies.
0:42 a fish out of the water😂
Why do all soccer videos like this have horrible music playing the whole time
obivously the first one isnt diving, he kicked the ground as you can see.. then hes pointing at the real madrid player and telling the ref that he touched it last
I hope VAR finally puts an end to this terrible aspect of the sport
1:10 That Smile
Is it coincidental that the team is losing are the ones taking the fall?  LOL!!!!!   Imagine before instant replay and video taping.  Getting away with murder.
soccer LOL
Some of these looked like they legitimately tripped
That why i hate football
This is ruining soccer/ football
This is why some people find it hard to like the sport of soccer.
robben wasn't a dive, it was genius
https://youtu.be/M05TcD_gZBg
Ramos should be ashamed of himself !!! Cuadrado barely touched him (on his shoulder) . Cuadrado was sent off (red card) during the final match of the Champions Leauge Cup. Come on!
No era penal
00:30 Lol
0:45 fish out of water??
You are ronaldo fan where are ronaldos dives
If you take a dive, you should get a LIFETIME BAN from soccer.
This video has too many mistakes,most of them are Real fouls
you should do 1 of these from this years world cup , the knock out phase has just started yet theres so many to choose from , set it to that old 60,s i think nancy sinatra  bang bang song, as they go down like they,ve been shot after the slightest touch . it,s pathetic and sets a sorry example for the young wanna be footballers watching them roll around on the floor ,again  pathetic
These guys have no shame and no honour - it's the reason I find it difficult to watch "the beautiful game"
They should red card divers upon review.... it would stop this drama. Ashamedly it’s become part of the game
No era penal
Where is Ronaldo
They should start a career in acting for drama movies.
NO ERA PENAL
1:09 when you already know what you get for christmas
0:47 Hey Dogson do the silly Salmon
Idont think so
I was hoping to see the one in which Jordi Alba tripped solo and Barca was awarded a free-kick or pk (not sure) and won the game with them scoring it.   Hopefully next vid, also there are a ton more from especially CR7, Busquets, Ramos, Pepe recently xD
God I hate football
Where is the CUAUTEMIÑAC????
David Luiz can't stop laughing ,that's so funny
This is why association football is not as popular in America as American football — bunch of sissies
Brazil is known for diving....Especially neymar
Need to make it an automatic red card for flops
I don't think this semen slurping sport is for me...
Chupame el pene negro ctm
What an absolute shower of cunts
2:23 I agree it was a little exaggerated but the other obviously stepped on Robben’s foot
When you get hit in the leg and grab your face xD
They should have 4 snipers on each corner and instantly shoot anyone that does this.
Error 404: Neymar not found.
Kindergarden.
lots of Brazilian motherfuckers
Pack of handbags 🖕
Crappy list. Most of these werent even dives. A couple of them people tripped on themselves and fell (first one who shot in the ground while the impact made him fall forward), some of them were clearly contact (Ramos getting stomped, Suarez getting kneed in the back). You can easily find 11 more blatant dives than this list. You for example missed Gilardino who ran 3 steps then fell down or that brazilian player in the brazilian league who fell down with no player around him getting a penalty.
snipers are at it again
Shitty music
That Robben one he stepped on robbens foot so he started running and couldnt so he fell
first one wasn't a dive, he kicked the floor, he tried to play it as a dive but he didn't dive on purpose.
“Men”.
0:59 Suarez didn’t dive,he did the hand motions but contact was made in his leg
1:17 👿
Pussy's
Why do you have to play this awful music with it? The commentary would had been much better
the 3rd one is not a dive
any list of divers is incomplete without C ronaldo inside.
There should be cards for flopping. Makes soccer look like a pussy sport. Makes me mad.
0:32 like a fish out of the water
There should be an Oscar category for this.
50 lashes with a bull whip for each.
the days before VAR
"2:07 - 2:09 it says ""Life's Good"" on the fence and the player is looking at it while falling
He is probably like ""NO IT'S NOT!"""
No Era Penal
Hhhmm two Sergio's and they are two bitches!
1:50 PEEKABOO!
What a gay game. For sissies and poofters
"Really people cant understand Cuadrado trample on Ramos foot?
Still thinkin the dive was 4 the push? 

Omg..."
I was absolutely dying the entire time xD
How is there no Ronaldo or Neymar in this video? they’re the biggest divers in the modern game, lol
Comically pathetic
Sergio Ramos?? Why isn't he banned for life? The dirtiest player out there
this was clearly created by a mexican guy 😭😂😂😂
David he was laugh he didn't get hurt
Funny how they grab their face and not the area where they were tapped on
"This is the reason that turns me off from football. Used to love watching as many matches as possible but the diving really threw me off.
Instead of poultry fines how about they actually get tougher by implementing  immediate red cards or an actual sin bin for like 10-20mins (discretion of ref) . Maybe if they see their diving causes them to lose big cup games or a league constantly, perhaps they would stop or even just not be considered for top flight football. Make the sport half way towards beautiful again"
me in PES 2018
2:20 Robben dive was actually a fault. The defender touched his foot
Now drop on the deck and flop like a feeeeeesh
what about divenaldo😂😂😂
0:27 #2 He flaps around on the ground like a fish out of water, hilarious!!
The Sergio Ramos one js just epic...;;
#3 was a trip
How come you don’t put one of cristiano 😂
Kofi’s
Thats a foul 0:42
They been watching neymar too much
Not all dives, lots of theatrics though. You should do a, "top 100 Suarez dives", such a dirty player (especially when he does his classic "try to punch them in the couch as he takes a dive" ones).
I prefer hockey, a sport where players do everything they can to prove they're not hurt.  As opposed to football, where players do everything they can to prove they ARE hurt.  They should give PINK cards to the players faking injuries.
Stupid Vidal 😂
Yeah I knew you wouldn't add Ronaldos dive after I saw your channel picture
This is why i don't watch soccer
Where is CR7 ???
I like this sport a lot but this is retarded. They can take a long pass from the keeper straight to the dome no worries but a little touch and over they go. Pathetic.
The flops and fakery make the sport unmatchable IMHO.
2:21 not dive
I HATE Ramos.
No era penal!!!!
Like have none of these idiots ever heard of slow motion replay?
The first one wasn’t a dive he just missed the ball
"So I understand that the soccer referee has yellow and red cards for warning or ejecting a player.
Maybe there should be a third card - colored cow-poop brown.
That way the ref can hold it up and call 'BULLSHITT!' when a player takes an obvious dive."
Football/soccer is for weak ass bitches. Be a man and not such pussy fucks.
What a dive from arturo vidal !!
No. 3 there was contact on Suarez just couldn't see it
Gud thing we have var now
You forgot Greece vs Cote d’Ivoire which i’m commenting before the start of the viewing because everybody always forgets it
well ... its simple ... fake a dive  ... get 5 matches no play penalty , 20% of your monthly pay check and same penalty for your club. And the game becomes cleaner suddenly. And just keep the fines rising to keep players off the idea for faking again. :) ...P.S>  Ronaldo will have to beg for money to get something to eat :D
Where is Penaldo?
Overpaid big babies grow up
Robben isnt a dive. They stepped on his foot.
Some of those were just embarrassing, others were utterly shameful.
Adrian looks like a hooked Merlin out of water...
The worst thing is that colombia dive on japan to get a goal
This is why American people hate soccer
David Luis the best 😂
I dont se Messi or Neymar
Lol you're so biased. The king of dives isn't on the vid. I wonder why
Nothing beautiful about this game
"1) The #9 Is a fall. 
2) You could add Tra fall by strootman in Lazio-Roma, The derby o 2017 (retourn)."
Umtiti?
Students of Neymar
Ronaldo?
This should be named TOP 10 football player acting.
Lmao his face 1:04
cringe 😂
This 11 dives should have been ronaldo all of them
You forgot the whole Italian team.. ; )
"Ther is no dive of Cristiano Ronaldo
Because he is ronaldo fan 
Another madridog channel👏👏"
1:10 hahahha
Robben’s was a legit foul.
All are fucker.. great actor
This video should be titled, "11 Reasons Soccer Will Never Be Popular In North America."
Okay you guys have to be honest the rivaldo one is pretty funny
Red Card for Diving. No more diving.
1:10 THAT SMILE
the first about vidal isn't a dive... he hit the ground, so I wanna see you hitting the ground so hard when running
I hate Ramos, but he Cuadrado step on his foot.....And where's Ronaldo's dive on sideline??
Where is Ronaldo ?
Some were not dives
Lmaoooo the first one 😂
What a collection of scumbags
2:25 was not a dive
Number 2 is so jokes
Can we add Sistos dive against Australia this world cup
WOW NO RONALDO NO FUN!!!
Ok to all of u guys getting mad, diving is part of the sport. These are just examples of people who are really bad at it
Fake sissies hopefully you've been VARred out of football.
Peek a boo
Admin penaldo fan..  Madrid dog
Footbal players=SOFT COCKS
Uefalona
u do know a dive is when a player goes down without contact? i think theres 1 dive in this video click bait
Vidal is a trash... I don't have respect for him, he said bad words on Ronaldo and on Real Madrid after they won vs Juventus in UCL... He starts fights with his teammates... He dives... No respect for him!
Dislike 🙂
There's a lot to like about this sport, however, one thing that keeps killing it's credibility is all the fake falling, acting performances after getting slightly touched, it's so lame, it would be so much better if men played like men. Bring in a review panel that reviews games after they have been played, all actors get banned for the season or tournament.
arjen robbens was valid cause his foot was actually stepped on
This is why soccer is so bad
Dude cuadrado actually stamped on ramos's foot,a different camera angle showed that
I was waiting for neymar.. 😛😛 am amazed hes not in this 11😅
Overpaid Fuckers
where's gilardino? surely the greatest dive of all time
Every single one of them is a dick, they should really penalize this crap.
I just hate Ramos
Half of these should be of Madrid and Neymar. I’m guessing you’re fans of them
Daft rangers players
Where is Ronaldo?
2:17 because of that Mexico was eliminated in 2014 world cup now in 2018 world cup Netherlands is not playing
he hit the floor #1
Diving tramps
Unsportsmanlike conduct, improve the game by handing out a yellow card to anyone diving.
unsubbed
"ronaldo does not dive!
see? he is not in this video
cause he is ultra legend! xDxDXDXDXDXD"
1:10 Wow gives the camera a little smile
This is exactly why Americans dont like soccer! And why our best athletes dont play the sport. Sad when these are your Best athletes!!
"Robben DID NOT dive 
.The defender clearly stepped on his boot."
Should be fined by football association
You missed the 583.000 times Cristiano Ronaldo went for a dive...
Arjen Robben didn't dive, there was a contact. But maybe he hardened it a little bit, but there was a contact. Busquest actually got a push in his face.
David Luiz tho
How about Fred in Croatia vs Brazil
When people ask me why I rate Maradona the best ever, this is the reason why. Back then defenders used to boot him, really try to clean him out but he nearly always stayed up and got away. Would love players of this era have to go back and play during that time. They wouldn't last a season. They're snowflakes.
This acting is making the game bad and is disappointing the world. In Australia, everyone I know who is into rugby says that soccer is for weaklings and that we’re all actors and over react. I mean we have all done it but these once are happening ALL THE TIME and putting shame on the Beautiful Game.
Unbelievable thing that you can blame a player like Drogba by cutting the face part of the replay...
No ronaldo no party
li
li
li
In 2:21 that was not a dive it was a real foul
"2:59 i'ts Napoli-Chealse? It finish?
1-0?
2-2?
Tell me please"
All this guys need to go to the prison all their life. It's horrible, It's not a sport, It's a joke. And they've got millions dollars to do that ? Go to hell.
Robben ruined my life
It's a dive just think about a small player like that to put Drogba down? 😂😂😂
I thinking : its not funny its a shame of sport bring theater on green.
Lmao most were from Barcelona... Divelona... HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGA
0:45 was a red
gilardino dive
Thierry Henry diving against Spain in the 2006 world cup that led to one of their goals should be included.
Haha this guy is a real ronaldo fan hhh.....
"Yo, Im disliking cuz no ronaldo






JK😉"
Fans hate it, players hate it, refs hate it....nothing done to stop it. Why?
2:20 can somebody brake his leg
2:20 #noerapenal
🦅🦅
'Dives'... if someone puts his hand on your face its not diving. Ofcourse the theater displayed here is awfull. But they have to go down. I'm not a diver. Got an elbow rigth below my eye. It wasnt a pretty sigth. Not even a foul or card for this. Just because i didnt go down. In seconds my eye was double the size. I say go down. Well done of someone touches your face in any way
Iron rowben for mexicans
im not forgetting the first one
"Messi is a great player. But the fans.....
Same is with ronaldo.
They're both great, but this season Ronaldo is playing better tbh.
But M.Salah is playing godly.
I'm not a fangirl of Salah,Ronaldo or Messi but. Tbh, Salah deserves the Ballon d'or this year. WHO AGREES?"
Vidal at Juventus couldn’t see it 🤣
#9 is not a dive
Where's Dele Alli in literally any game he has played in?
You can see that he is such a Ronaldo fanboy...
Where is Penaldo?
2 and 3 isn't dive! Clear foul
Robben didn't dive. Look at his left foot on the replay
And they say its a 'mans' game. Embarrassing.
Where's the likse of gilardino and ashley young?
1:07 i think he got distracted by that female referee
It's a girls sport
Soccer players are actual pussies, rugby is for men.
Robben's was clearly not a dive. It shouldn't have been a foul, but he didn't dive. It's called "losing your balance".
Admin is a Ronaldo fanboy thats why he didn't added Lord Ronaldo in this video
Number 2 wasn't a dive.
Where is Gilardino?
Can u see David Luiz smiling and laughing to himself after he dived . Like if you see that 👍
i hate ramos even tho im a real madrid fan
Para los que lloran aún, si era penal de Robben, impecable el árbitro xd
U r biased , no ronaldo
Penaldo??? 🐬
They are all a disgrace to the game .
The only reason why soccer sucks
VAR would've given penalty for all of this even if it was outside the dee 😂
Number 9 was a legitimate penalty, he had his foot stepped on
Sorry my friend but No9 robben .....is a penalty...if you watch closely the defender has contact in the shke with robben's shoe....wrong choice for tge video
hello mute button
Can't you make football videos without bad music????
grown men pretending to be hurt.  so embarrassing...
This is why I quitted soccer. Now I play lacrosse ;)
I can not forget about anything to do with football now because of this channel
Arjen robben's was legit
Sergio "the bitch" Ramos
… all Bastards!!!
What a pussys
Dammmmmmmm...........😎😎😎
What a terrible video. Dislike
A lot of people in the comments don’t like Ronaldo clearly
Sick music 🤦🏽‍♂️
This guy didn't add Ronaldo cuz Ronaldo is god of Fake dives
yo where’s neymar bruh 😂😂😂😂
Football is pathetic with bitches playing
1:50 cuckoo...cuckoo....most idiot people
I don't care how good they are individually, these kinds of shameless tactics and theatrics bring disgrace to the beautiful game. These players should be banned for this kind of behavior.
I dont like footballers like this. FUCKIN ACTORS
how can first one be a dive if he ACCIDENTALLY kicked the ground?
"2:16 He stepped on his foot
Oke the reaction was too much but still"
Where is ronaldo?He is damn no 1
I was waiting for atleast one  ronaldo clip...  Hit like if you were too..lol
U take luis Suarez dive nd forget about cr7 infamous dives😂😂bias video
there is any of this videos without that stupid teenaged music?
This is why American soccer is much better to watch.  They just play the game instead of flopping to get a free kick.  Pussy ass Europeans need to man up and stop acting like a bunch of menstruating teenage girls.
Ronaldo's dive vs Celta Vigo
Worthless human beings.
You forgot Italy vs Australia 2006 World Cup. Italy = diving country
#2 isn't a dive he just over exaggerates it
you forgot ronaldo OMG
Where's Ronaldo and Neymar
Suarez vs PSG in the remontada
Ramos you filthy motherfucker..
Where's umtiti
The first few were legit fouls
#3 is not a dive look at his knee
I really all of them would be Ronaldo
Where is Alba  fc barcelona ????????? Dislike
u forget ronaldo dive mate 😂😂😂
Penaldo is GOAD - greatest off all dives
Not ronaldo?
You love ronaldo
Some aren’t dives
first one is not a dive he just hit the grass
"Check out Danko Lazovic's dive in the Hungarian league 1
Flopping around like a fish"
All those fake players should be ban for life.  Making the games look very bad as cheat to win.
There’s some fine soccer skills on display here..
You have to include Greizmann's dive against Australia for the next edition.
All the reasons why soccer sucks.
Everybody complaining about Ronaldo, the Celta Vigo (sorry if it is misspelled) dive is legit. But I do believe that Messi has had a few dives in his career, where are people wondering about him? Arjen Robben is trash btw.
The main reason why I now hate this sport. Cowards and cheats and  gullible, stuoid referees.
This is why soccer sucks, game for the actors. They'll cry like a girl in a real man's game.
This is why I can't take this game seriously.  Fake injuries, diving, massive embelishments...  If those players in the video got 10 match bans, you'd see an end to this garbage.
Soccer - Gay
What a biased vid, no Ronaldo’s yet a lot of Barca’s
The one in the thumbnail isn’t a dive he was just being stupid and kicked the grass by accident
What about the famous dive of Kaká ?
My opinion these Dives where acceptable due to how funny and unpredictable they where 😂 some of them where Prue comedy genius and amazing to watch
A red card and $1 million fine for diving will solve a lot of problems.
0:33 and the best dying fish impression goes to...
How is the #9 clip with Arjen Robben a dive? He clearly got stepped on.
this sport will always be dominated by European drama queens!
Cristiano Ronaldo?🐬
Superhuman showdown 😂
This is so funny. The second one was hilarious he actually got up and then went back down LOL!
enter in youtube: andreas moeller dive,  to see the best dive
"""Spirit of the game"" ?!??

Cunts."
???? where is the 2 from nani of man utd.one where he headbutted a player from aston villa then made out he was hit,then his classic of tapped by carra run around the referee as he got blank then started to die.who can forget rivaldo
The first one wasnt a dive he just missed the ball but idk why he still said he got fouled lol
Bunch of pussies.. can you imagine this happening in Rugby
How is Gilardino vs Celtic not on this list?
"To me a dive is when someone goes does when he WASNT touch.
If someone exaggerate a contact, that's not a dive."
None from Ronaldo?
kakean iklan 👎👎👎
I played soccer my whole life and is is painful to watch, what a disgrace to the sport
there is a lot of diving in the liga mx too !
1:10 The grin at the camera was just too good
Suarez is best
Top 11 Oscar nominee's..
This is why contact sports are better
What do Rivaldo, Arjen Robben, Dàgo Maradona, Dennis Wise and Sergio Ramos have in common? They are five of the most slimy and loathsome individuals to have ever appeared on a football field. I would loved to be locked into an empty room with any one of them! On the subject of divers, they should be banned for life.
They did step on robbens foot
These grubs need to be eliminated from the game.
Sve debil do debila...druže, direktan crveni pa se bacakaj do mile volje ;)
david luiz one is rlly funny
Like fainting sheep
Don't need to show ronaldo's dive cause we already know that she is the dive queen.
I just couldn't consciously do it in front of millions of viewers
Seriously, the Oscars need to add football as a new category.
Infamous dives
Robben's a scumbag
And thats why i hate soccer.
RAMOS U SWINE!
They look like such wimps.
Send them all off!
Bunch of pussies, don't watch footy anymore because of that.
Diving is the worst thing in the best sport. In AUstralian rules football you get fined for doing this crap.
Suarez vs PSG didn't dive
Where is The Dolphin's dive?
1:51 got to love this peep 😬
gay sport
Pepe, Ronaldo ?
The Adryan one wasn't a dive wtf. He overreacted but he was fouled.
All of these make me mad except David Luiz, that was funny
Drogba???? Really, why would you????
No top 10 here....like spinal tap this one goes to 11
I have already forgotten all 11, but I remembered the into
The first one wasnt a dive he just hit the pitch with his foot
2:15 wasn't a dive
"I somehow get it if you dive when there's actual contact, could be tactical. 
But when there's no contact whatsoever, or that exaggerated rolling around, they should punish it harder."
We see this stuff happen in nearly every match now. Suarez dives but this was a bad example. How about when a player heavily fouls someone then dives and pretends he was the one who was fouled to cover it up? Buahaha.
Yes some of them are dives but there are still fouls like Luis Suarez got elbowd by serigo Ramos, the foul is slight but it's there. Same with Ramos when he was stepped on by Juventus player.
no 10 was not dive, he did stomp ramos's foot, your video just shows the upper half, i am not denying that it was not a red but it was not a dive
3:08 why did he do that
Gilardino dive should be on here for sure.
Just wondering, why do soccer players dive so much.
Pederson has autism
They were trained to do so. LOL
Busquets piece of s........
The whole barca is where?
7 and 9 where definitely contact they just milked it but to be fair a good few of these are
"How tf is the first one a “dive” ?!??
He messes up his footing and falls over, not a doc"
sergio ramos dive is pathetic
bousquets uomo di merda. .
first clip wasnt a dive he kicked the floor
Some of them are not dives though
I couldn't even watch till the end to embarrassing
This is why some people hate soccer.
I forgot about all of these. Not impossible
Football players are pussies
"Bonucci infamous dive you won’t regret watching this.
https://youtu.be/wlT9tGtbMjg"
This is pathetic. I thought NBA flops were bad.
Bunch of pussies!
I love how they shake off 5 defenders grabbing and pushing them as they sprint and dribble with perfect balance. Then as soon as they reach the penalty area any touch causes all their bones and organs to explode.
Divers, flippers, its outta control. Refs should just let play continue or card the those who dive.
Needs to be taken from the game. I live in Australia and watch football/soccer and when i see this it makes me not want to watch.
lel
Soccer is gay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiG707bVfLA
9 wasnt a dive
Can you simply play the clips without adding the stupid music?!
Vidal pointing afterwards is glorious!
Pussies
Footballers are so weak.
This is why I hate football, they are all cheats.
This is the reason why I dont follow football. Lame
Only disliked for the music
Australia vs Italy?
Most of these aren't even dives. You obviously don't have eyes.
The exact reason why I hate nowadays football. Fuckin actors
sometimes i wonder why did i watch football again
I find this part of soccer to be excruciatingly pathetic
I think Vidal genuinely thought he had been fouled hahahahaha
The game today shameless these players just for a red  card ,or to get an inch ,  free kick  or a Oscar for play acting!
Soccerballers are pathetic.
12 Ronaldo's in the 2018 world cup match Portugal - Spain
so pathetic.....
Sergio Ramos : The biggest cunt in football.
Ramos...
Hard to respect a sport where this nonsense is acceptabe
Soccer. Most overrated sport in the world.
Sisi kebancian pemain bola
1/2 of this situations staight red card for simulation!
Girls
"Football is full of nothing but wimps and is renowned for crap like this. 
You'd never find anything like this being attempted in rugby"
That leeds one is ridiculous.
What a fruity sport.
robben's foul was real....they are stamping in his feets
That's y I hate barca coz of Suarez and the other divers
The Luis Suarez flop actully was a good flop
Hey ronnie fangirl .. where is our Oscar winner gaynaldo  in this video ??
It shows that you are cr7 fan boy , because he is the biggest diver and cry baby
Those cheaters 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
This is why i STOP watching football.. a lot of faget clown..
You forget Alexis Sanchez actor performation in Barcelona
I think Suarez can fill the whole list
What about ronaldo man
suarez is a dive  master............
Where is Ronaldo ?
The first (Vidal) isn’t a dive
Sergio Ramos dived because cuadrado pushed him
0:54 if Suarez wouldn't have dived they would have losed the game !!
"East or west
Barca is the best"
U could make a top 100 on Ronaldo
Suarez #1
obvious Ronaldo fan
And Ronaldo 😂😂😂😂??
Vidal didn’t dive he tripped over himself
Came here to see Van Gaal
Goddamnit, that David Luiz one is so so good.
Where is Gaynaldo ? This channel sucks
Vidal did not dive he kicked the ground and genually thkught he was fouled
"Diving video without cr7 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This guy clearly barça hater showing only barca players"
Some of these aren't dives
No 6 when the mouth odor hits you
The Sergio Ramos one was real I'm not kidding
In Basketball, it's called flop. You can ask LeBron James about it.
.
0:03 he didn't dive he just tripped
Lol
At 1:10 you can see david luiz on the ground smiling
OH REALLY? DDROGBA? R U FCKIN KIDDING ME?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a Hispanic kid I hate robben for that he got us out of the world cup
Suareź fall down was not a dive it also hit on his knee when you look carefully you can understand
Where is penaldo
dude Real Madrid does 3 dives in just one game
Es gibt ein Video und das heißt auf Deutsch: Die Unfaiersten Fussballmomente. Und da sind fast genau die gleichen Videos
Vidal's  reaction  fter  falling.. 😂
Yeah,it's impossible to forget but it is impossible to remember to!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Why there haven't been the dive of ronaldo against celta vigo?
Lol
Number ten annoys me because he tried to say sorry for the lightest of touches but Sergio Ramos still falls
Penaldo????
On Busquets and on the David Luiz there are both fouls and yellow card for dangerous playing, there is no dive just they make it to look painful, learn what is dive and after upload video with that.
"Bro you forget the best diver

Penaldo"
Diveiano penaldo?
Ops, i forgot it all
Where's Fillipo Inzhagi? Oh yeah, he still dive until now...
And where is Ronaldo, bro?
people are very cheeky these days
Luis Suarez was clearly shoved in the box that angle does not give him justice. It literally only shows when he is about to hit the floor not when he got shoved.
Barcelona is the fuckin most cheater team in the world... and about the Ramos scene juve player kicked him with his leg( it's not covered in this video) it wasn't diving at all
#2no dive
Suarez didnt dive,look Marqui... legs i am not fan of suarez but thats not dive
If hr gonna be a footballer dont dive they have cameras
Vidal didn't dive agginst Real...You can see that he hit the ground...
1:11 he’s smiling
1:11 he smiles!
Bro, that with vidal maybe seems funny, hea could have broken his leg easily
Arjen robben didn't really dive.. he just drew the defender into the foul... it was actually rather smart I'd say.
FOOTBALL IS ALL ABOUT RESPECT huh? please....
Where is Ronaldo's dive
Cr7 is the 10th time best divellon d'or winner.. 👏 without him this is incomplete
Where is ronaaaaaaldoo??😃🐳
Honestly, I forgot all of these.
where is jordi alba's dives??
And u r a divaldo fan
Where is the portuguese Dolphin
where is ronaldos dive?
Estos chilenos :v
Ok the guy actually stepped on robben’s foot though
Ramos is just a dick
The thing is if you look closely Robben didn't actually dive don't hate me but look close
The Suarez one isn't famous tbh
What about cr7 or you are real fan
Where are the Benfica players
How does this vid have not one Ronaldo dive😂😂😂😂
worst video because there is no any CR7 dive...loll
"Where is ronaldo's dive?
ronaldo fanboy"
We're talking about diving and no ronaldo here? Hard to believe
Van gal
I am a Madrid fan, but Ronaldo is great at diving, and neymar is his brilliant student. While Suarez has already graduated from Division State University. XD
I just have to say this.. actors n@sty moth. F#€krz!
number 2 Wasnt A Dive
Adryan wasn’t a dive... he jus overreacted
"Where is penaldo? He  should have at least 2-3 clips 
Also ramos should be at least 4 
Stupid real madrid kid"
Ronaldo hein
Ramos is the biggest cheat I hate him
You are so bad...You are 100% Uefa Madrid fan...When Ronaldo score beautiful goal like aginst Juve,you make video - Top 10 goals of season...
"And ronaldo tought them these dives. 
You are one cr7 dick rider bro. 
It is not possible when there is dive vedio and ronaldo is not present."
omg the second one haha xd
Netherlands vs México uuh y did this happen
How about Ronaldo's against netherlands
Luis suarez no dives
Sergio Ramos is a f*cking asshole
#2
Ramos dive was just funny
Ramos tidak diving cuadrado menginjak kaki ramos
My YouTube is glitched
Haha, you put Suarez's dive in this video, but you don't put all Ronaldo's dives. Ronaldo dive against Celta Vigo?
"This type of faking is disrespectful to the game
There's a reason to call football the beautiful game -""RESPECT"""
Robben not
მოტყნული სერხიო რამოსი. მაგის დედა შევეცი
#2, 7 weren’t dives
Best actors
They are great actors 😂
Peekaboosquets
#3 wasn't a dive
0:53 there was a contact Def pushed Suarez's leg
The fun thing is that it’s more painful to throw yourself because someone sneezed than to quit crying and playing on
THE 9 and 10 are Bs so don t put it in
"David luiz face 1:09




Smiling"
Should have named 11 cheats impossible to forget.
Vidal's wasn't a dive,he thought he hit another player's foot,but it was the ground
This is why football is hated in some countries😬
The award goes to this few people
#no era penal
I know player from Barcelona are gay
Messi?
"Omg How you Can be so dumb?
The first one wasnt dive!!!!!
He just kicked into ground!!!
Jerk"
This is what ruins soccer for me people who play in this manner. if you get tackled take it like a man dust your self off and keep on going and if your really been fouled its will be obvious you won’t have to act like you’ve been shot for god sakes
Funny how Barca fans call Ronaldo a diver when they have a rat having heart attacks in the box
And now......... Real divedrid in the quarter finals
Luis Suárez should be all other this list
Chilerdos
Where's Ronaldo who might have been on top. Sure Ur a Ronaldo fan that's y
1:52 why is Sergio busquets playing peek a bo😂😂
01:07 luiz was laughing😂
Ramos was not dive cuadrado stamped his leg then why he said sorry to ramos
One awful thing about soccer that works against its credibilty.
first one is not a dive.. missed the ball
Ronaldo? .... typical ronaldo fan boy
You forgot Penaldo dude
"1:10 Pause And See .... 
Thank me later...."
How disgusting they are omg
Didn’t some Italian player do a horrendous dive against Celtic in the champions league one time? Worst one I ever saw lol
bunch of pussies
Or smile
Laugh
1:11 lol luiz luagh
Where is Dominic Adiyiah on Uruguay vs Ghana ? It was a dive that caused a lot of controversy. Yes, it was a big dive.
Cristiano ronaldo?
Barcelona - "more than a dive"
Wher is brazil vs croatia
4 and 9 are not dives all the others are
david luiz is a asshole lmao
I hate cheats
Wtf #5
why do these videos always have to have crappy music? no music would be better
Busquets uomo dimmerda
Why was ramos even holding his foot
"People in the comments wondering where is Ronaldo..
Ronaldo's divings are not ridiculous like in the video' that's why he is the 'king of diving'.. rumors say he will patent his diving style.."
Jesus at least make it look realistic!!!
I can't believe BT Sports pundits praised Suarez dive against PSG as clever. Should be a disgrace to help a comeback with a dive
This video can be made just of penaldo dives but owner of channel is fan of haha madrid
1:10 HAHAH like a boss.. never liked him before but now i do
I hate divers! Spain/Real Madrid/Barcelona and thos divas are the worst.
number #3 is a dive? you know nothing about football if you think that's a dive son...
#2 is a dead fish
Filthy, grosse Latin Americans!
1:10 David Luiz Proof !
I couldn't stop myself laughing at the Ramos dive .
Suarez’s dive at Liverpool hè dives when hè saw that Liverpool had the ball and was in the counter hè stand up like Nothing happend
Where are Ronaldo dives they are the best

David luis bad boy
Number 9 #NoEraPenal greetings from México

Where is coqulin? 😂😂😂
David luiz simleing

2:20 he clearly steps on robbens foot! si era penal
diving like that should get you a direct red card
dive-celona!
barka butthurt
Where is gillardino's?
1:10 Cheeky fucker
Sniper!!!!!!!!
Where’s Spain Portugal World Cup 2010
where is penaldo
Suarez....one bite man...😂 😂
Embarrassing. They like little babies
First one is not a dive: he simply kicked the turf. Hard. And tried to blame others.
They need to try rugby.
This one on 0:01 is not dive. He just kicked in the grass and fell thats it
Imo #10 isn't really a dive, he stamps Ramos's foot, its not captured in the camera though, he even acknowledges it by apologising to Ramos
penaldo😂😂😂
Where is Neymar jr
Wheres CR7 actions ?😎
1:07 david luiz thug life 😂
More proof as to why the sport sucks.
Barcelona all players dive vs 1 Bottle against Valencia 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
last one was funny asf.
"Where is ronaldo....
Greatest diver in the world? 😂"
Vidal😅
Yubtuber must be penaldo fan
Ramos is the king☺☺☺☺☺👍
Min 2:21 super piscinazo pero hay que dejarse de cosas si fue penal al majarle el pie
I don't think any other dive made me as mad as Ramo's. I get that as a professional winning by any means necessary is a thing. Not something that I support, but fine, I see your point. But that game was in the bag. The only way Real was going to lose that is if a miracle happened. The fact that Ramos was aiming for Oscars on the 83rd min with a 3-1 lead and a rather convincing spell really really infuriates me. And I admired Ramos before then, lol.
Top 10 ronaldo dives?
Im sure Ramos' foot hurt after that push. Looks painful ahaha (#10)
Wankers
Where la ronaldo eeeh
This is why I cannot get into football...bunch of fakes.
Jordi alba barcelona you forget
Modric vs Psg
Some of these aren't really dives...
vidal kicked the ground
0:30 un pescado fuera del agua
Kkkkkkk mi
0.27 wasn't a dive it was a clear dive.
It was a foul on Robben
He's  smealing at 1:11
This is so cringe sometimes
#2
Ronaldo has a lot of dives, and you didn't upload it?
haha ronaldo should have won all this list from 10 to 1. what a fangay channel :)))
David Luiz cracking a smile lol
#9 are you mexican, that clearly wasnt a dive..
He wasn’t diving!! Number #0
The ronaldo one ?
Haven't even watched it I bet robbed is there
To the video maker...u have 1.7M followers. I expected more from you
Where is divaldo?? Yes I mean penaldo??
Cuadrado step on Ramos foot
Penaldo should be on all places for this top 11
Lmao 😂 pussy sport
It was better to start from number 11
There was a Neymar dive where he goes like a windmill... was an awesome dive
The Italy dive vs Australia?
vidal didnt dive he kicked the grass
That Vidal  idiotic
Barcelona, the school of flops....
of course u are ronaldip fans...
2:26 I don't think that's considered dive, probably more like feint.
Sergio Ramos sucks because he cheats and dives all the time. He is also very aggresive.
Where is the best famous dive of cristiano.....
😂😂made by a hating madrid fan
#1😂😂
This is typical football if you want to see sport go to see basketball there aren’t people who falls for wind blow...
Jordi alba dive last season in the last league game was disgraceful
Isaac Cuenca's dive was horrific.
vidal aint dive lol
Some were legitimate fouls they were not faking.
1:50 pica boo
Where's penaldos famous dives
And pepe
vidal dives are masterpiece
Where is the best of them all the shitty life of a bitch Penaldo.
Wheres Ronaldo dive?
Kyle laffertyyyyy kyle laffertyyyy he's 7 foot and he plays the flute Kyle lafferty

1:37 old man was saying f***
1:37 old man was saying f***

Where's the king of dives -divnaldo?
9 was okay
Where is that dolphin?
U included Ramos , Suarez , Sergio , but there was not even a single one of Ronaldo ? , He is the king of dives and u didn't
This is why american football and rugby fans call us pussies. I love football, but come on, most of the players act like this
there a difference between tripping and diving (in one of them he hit the floor
Where is ronaldo lol??
They should be in hollywood
Aronica
OMG u forgot to put divenaldo's dives 🤕. Ohhh sorry now I understand why you didn't put them because it's a 3min video if u put Ronaldo's dive u have to make a movie of it😂😂
Shite music
The man put his hands on Sergio Busquets’ face but he did overreact
автор блядь долбоёб...роналдудрочер хуев...
where's ronaldo.  Just because you are a Ronaldo fan you didn't upload any of his dives ronaldo dives more than suarez
The one of Robben was clearly not a dive. All Mexicans just wanted to have a reason why they lost...
Where's your king dolphin

Panaldo?
This sport is for people who didn't make it in Hollywood
This is.. Why i hate football

1:52😝😝😝😝
Lol david luiz made my day
Where is ronaldo?? He's the best diver too.. oh.. i forget, that you fans of ronaldo.. lol
For all the guys asking about why ronaldo isnt in the list..its because hes busy swimming with the dolphins at diving diner
Busquits gets a hand on the throat. Hands should not be up there in the first place. There Was another video where they show cuadrado stomping on ramos foot.
Ronaldo at euro 2016
Robben didn't dive
0:30 it's not dive, he just overreacted
Very very poor compilation witch
And the Oscar goes to 0:41
not really dives
For robben,  the chili player ( I'm not sure if chili...) stepped on his foot. It isn't clear but if u do zoom u can fee that he stepped on it...
This sort of thing is getting worse in Football...  Check out our opinions on this subject here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4utH9Z_EC_c We'd love to get your feedback...
Vidal didnt dive hes just blind
"The first guy is kick the dirt
👆👆"
To be fair the first one of vidal isn't a dive because if you watch very slowly and zoomed you can see there is a contact with a RM player who causes the "dive"
Is Mexicans will never forget the Robben Dive #No EraPenal
Casemiro against Tottenham?
What about Rinaldo and his famous dives
OMG how cristiano ronaldo is not in the video ??
Where is Casemiro dive against Tottenham Hotspur
A lot were people running fast and getting nudged which I pretty hard to stay up to but shouldn’t be a pen / free kick. But some were just dirty
this is why soccer gets a bad reputation
Where is the dive master cristiano ronaldo ,he is the dive master of the football history
But but Messi is better than ronaldo 😂😂
How about Suarez for Liverpool
E Vidal one wasn't a dive he said after the game he kicked the floor but thought he was tripped
Barcelona is just so good at diving!!
Yup ronaldo fan for sure He could fikk the entire list
si chiama furbizia comunque...
Suarez werent dive
Messi in Copa America final 2016??
Vidal didnt dive he wanted to shoot the ball but he missed her so he kick the ground and he falled so he didnt dive
#8

Ramos didn’t dive he stepped on he’s feet and the camera don’t show it here
4 its a penalty cause meuniers knee hits suarez leg
Kurzawa's knee collided against suarez's thigh

This incomplete where is divinaldo
Seriously??? .. made by cr7 fan
"BARCELONA

Ronaldo dives sometimes but these ones were super exaggerated, and Vidal wasn't a dive he kicked the ground and fell
Of course Suarez is on the list, he’s a pro diver. Where’s Neymar though?
Number 9 with arjen robben is still a clear foul

Bcz ronaldo's dives are on another level..  they will make a new vdo for sure
Cr7's dive ?
2:50 it’s a disgrace!
There was no point of Ramos diving, Real Madrid were winning like 3 to zero
Just unsubscribed😎😎
"Where is the king of diving...

1:07 David Luiz
Luis Suarez is not diving
Wtf where is ronaldo😂😂😂😂😂 the diver king😂😂😂
Watching Arjen Robben Dove makes my day
that smile by david luiz was kinda creepy
Ronaldo fanboy spotted
Eu sou obrigado a falar esse canal que tá uma p**

It’s 2018 and I am still thinking that arjen robben never deserved that penalty against Mexico
The first one is not dives he kick the glass hard and fail
Guys shut up. Ronaldo is the best player bruv..
Where's Dolphinaldo?
"Ill never forget that Buscuets peak.

Remember Ronaldo’s 2836395959281024955 dives ?
Where is Ronaldo?
Bevgy málva akorse vgy bekakàlva
The one at the start of the video wasn’t a dive he misplaced his foot which caused him to trip over maybe because of how hard he must have tried to kick it. Simple
Barca best psg 6-1 hahahahahaha
Where is Fallonel "Messy"?
Football players being drama queens
#3 was not a dive lmao
Lol even though the one at the beginning didn’t have a number to it, when he was about to hit the ball his foot hit the ground first which made him fall. Trust me it hurts my friend broke his foot once doing that and I have done it also.
Swimmingpool dive from Ronaldo Looks att channel picture Oh...
Ronaldo dive?
We know sometimes ronaldo dives but none are as famous as these
whatever ramos does he does perfectly🤣 even tge avting is perfect🤣
#1 was that a dive???
No fue penal!!

I hate arjen Robben México dominated
"Where is the king of dive....
Cristianooooo Rrronaldooooooo😂😂😂"
"to be honest the first one wasnt a dive it was a flop
he hit the ground instead of the ball that made him fall"
Thought it was weird that the worst diver in football today wasnt on the list until I was your avi
David luiz's wasn't a dive he was laughing because he knew the player that tackled him was getting sent off.
Not sure whether vidals one was a dive or whether he just kicked the floor
You Messi dickriders shut up. Just cause he didn't add Ronaldo in the video doesn't mean Ronaldo hasn't dived before. Its his video and I'm pretty sure he gives zero fucks about what you think. Messi dickriders always acting like he's the best in history.
Where is CR7??????
Gerrard vs Liverpool? :D
Che bastardone David Luiz ahahaha.
Vidal didnt dive
2nd player was like fish put on riverbank.
Wow ronaldo dive alot but you did not put it on the video nice 👍🏻

Where are the Cr7's dives ??
Sad thing was Cuadrado got sent off for that. Sergio Ramos 🤦‍♂️
2:06
2:06
The Vidal one at the beginning wasn't even a dive lol
"The one from the thumbnail wasn’t a dive he kicked the floor
Still like what an idiot how do you do that as a trained pro footballer"

We all hate Leeds scum
Arjen robben vs Mexico??
No ronaldo its just because he is ronaldogy fanboy
Robben didn't dive he got stepped on
#10 wasnt a dive
This makes me very angry
"Me showing the #2 to my friends.
""Guys that's what you looks like after you take flakka"""
Pause at 1:11
Ramos didn’t dive, Cuadrado stepped on his leg.
Robben is Fault, Drogba is Fault, suarez is Fault, etc..
Not 11 is probably 4 ou 5
Alaba
I hope sergio ramos will seeing his father on this video and get disappointed of his father😂😂
Neymar? Ronaldo?
Where ksi five in the sdmn match
Where is KSI ????
a video on famous dives without ronaldo is like cereal without milk
Where is the ronaldo dive??? Yeah your idol on your profile picture is the greatest diver of all time just so you know.
That smile tho 1:10
If you put the playback speed slower on Suarez's "dive", you can see Marquinhos' knee hits the back of Suarez's leg. So, can we confirm this as no dive, or not. More evidence on yes or no dive would be appreciated. Thanks.
On Kyle's I think ur harsh to choose him out of all the bigger players who done the same thing 😂
1:11 what a joker 😂😂😂 he smiling

Adryan was a foul but he overreacted waaaaayyy to hard.
Pringao el de suarez era penal
N9 Wasnt a dive
I feel like the 1 one accident fell thinking he got pushed and or he missed the ball so he may have dived or missed kicking the bal and missed
Lul david laugh
The first one not dive he shot the ground
Do you have some thing with Barcelona because, those were not dives
I'll always dislike ramos for that dive
Vidal's foot hit the grass
Arjen Robben did not dive. He got hit on the foot before he made the jump
I forgot some of Ronaldo’s dives and I mean cr7
Ramos didn’t dive, cuadrado said sorry to him

Some people willing to suck Penaldo's dick if he offers few million dollars but these Penaldo fans just want to suck his dick for free...LOL...

Luiz was even smiling
I am a Ronaldo fan.... But come on... No Ronaldo on the list of diving?... You are joking.. 😂😂
OMFG YOU GUYS ARE ALL SO ANNOYING. When will you understand that Cuadrado stepped on Ramos’s foot? The ref was in front of him he saw ffs stop saying he died you all are retarded

"robben wasn't acting 
Suarez Luis professional way"
Wrzzer the best
😀😀😀
David Luis dive his the best dive
Drogba’s dive was nice
Neymar should be in top 1 & saurez in no. 2
Sergio Ramos....Scum of the Earth
Okeh
no single dive of ronaldo given...why?
to be honest the best diving should be 1-10 CR7
Vidal is juve cunt
Like for smile of david luiz
I hate Suarez, he is a diver a biter and a racist
1:11 Is he smiling?
First one wasn't a dive. He just accidentally kicked the ground instead of the ball
You can make a long video just with Cristiano Ronaldo dives, why didn't you put some of his dives un this video?
The king of diving?? Where is Ronaldo???
This guy is stupid number 10 cuardo stepped on Sergio Ramos foot which hurts really bad like if you agree
Strange to say...but Vidal was not diving
Ronaldo isn't on the list bc it is about footballers not dolphins
CR7 ...??? RONALDO MASTER DIVING
This video should be titled- Cristiano Ronaldo, King o Dolphins
Bad video
DAVID Luis is even laughing lol
where is ronaldo . one of the best diver

Lo peor de todo, a parte de la falta de deportividad de estos marrulleros, es que el árbitro picó en la mayoría de los casos...
Vidal didn't dive he hit his foot on the ground
the first vidal shoot grass thats not a dive
"Casemiro vs Tottenham
The best dive in history"
Stupid player
That was no dive from ramos cuadrdo steped his feet on his feet which is painful with studs...dont make us fool

The reasons n ronaldo is not in is coz wrzzer is a ronaldo fan
Where are Ronaldo dives so many
"No dives of Cristiano ronaldo 😂😂😂😂
Deluded Channel 😂😂"
Just as a fact Cuardrado didn't stamp on ramos's boots
Ronaldo and Messi not in this because they are fair play people
😂
Big Kyle lafferty
Ronaldo should have been at no.1

"No Cristiano..??
Oh The Channel Is A Ronaldo Fan.."
King of divers : cr7
Guys please understand Ramos didn,t dive Cuardrado steped on his foot. You just can,t see that in this camera view
I don't like how it's a Ronaldo fan based page but u can't put Ronaldo to the side in this vid even in FIFA 18 he dives that's straight proof showing that even in a video game he dives
What a suprise no Ronaldo dives?
https://youtu.be/cGqPEM_dmJA
Fuc*ings gaynaldo fanboy channel
Where is Dolphin naldo?
Some of them are clear foul but maybe not that hurt.
Touch me Touch me not
48% if this dive is from Barcelona that's proof about how divelona had most school diving in the world
Where are Cristiano s dives?
haha.. go2 real madrid.. f**k barcalona
No era Penal hahah
Basic Penaldo Fan puts everybody but the Top 2 Best Divers ( Ronaldo ) ( Ramos ) lol
Sergio Ramos did get stepped on a shoved lightly so he could have twisted his ankle but his reaction was not like he twisted his ankle
If i have to make one such Video- i believe all 11 will be with Ronaldo. I don’t hate him, but it’s definitely unfair if he is not on this list!!
OMG, you must be blind, there are at least 3 ronaldo dives which were ridiculed even by madrid’s press. Shame on you!
Where is real Madrid asshole
Vidal was thinking that he got hit but he doean't got hit
Barca fanboy
Neymar vs PSG
Adrian is an octopus
Where is Ronaldo? Oh yeah I forgot I’m on a Ronaldo dickriders channel
"Top 2 make me upset:
1. Ramos
2. Robben"
https://youtu.be/ZLVY6SYmHLU
Haha
Where's Alba dive vs Eibar?
2 wasn't a dive
Arjen Robben wasn't a dive, Marquez broke his toe though!
Cleary a real madrid fan who made this video

1:10
Where is Neymar
Sergio Ramos could've filled all 11
Where are the dives of ronaldo and 3 is not a dive the defender put his hand on suarezes shoulder and his knee hit his leg 100% correct penalty
Your videos are great man, but how can you forget Ronaldo and Neymar here?
Hey Sergio Ramos didn't dive Cuadrado stepped on his foot
If you are ronaldo fan doesn't means ronaldo shouldn't be there.
Where is Penaldo ...??Ronaldo is the most Divest player ..and he is the best actor ..😂😂😂😂😂😈 fu........k....
"Stupid video, another channel much better than this.
And not all player dives
Dumb ass."
Where the hell is best diver of last 20 year.

Lmao😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂
Wtf ....Where is ronaldo...
Where is that dive king from divelona, neymar?
No cristiano ronaldo?? Strange. Veeeeery strange

Vidal was not a dive!
What about Christiano ronaldo's dive that got him a red card?
fucker where is marcelo against wolfsberg,and ronaldo is not here the king of diving i can forget those dive but at least i cant forget ronaldo's 3 dives and robben didnt dive
The first dive is not a dive. Infact , he hit his toes on the ground and from the force he fell but he mistakes the denfender for it
"Ronaldo against Celta de Vigo?
Neymar against Uruguay?"
let vinny jones tackle these retards and give em something to cry about
Where's ronaldo? Just because u are a fan him, so u don't include it in the list? Silly monkey.
1:09 XDDDDDD
Where Ronaldo dive 🐬🐬 in the super cup!?😂
I don’t think nr 1 was a dive ,you can see he kicked the ground. (I know he blamed it on the defender but if he hadn’t done that I don’t think it could be called a dive)
Busquets did not dive
ronaldo?
I watch ksi
Can u make a top 500 neymar dives?
where is ronaldo at manchester united
No matter whay penaldo is the greatest diver
And this is why I refuse to watch. Any dive should be a Red card and suspension, period. What a bunch of Pu$$y's.
Andreas möller
like
"For Vidal's he kicked the floor by accident and thought the player had tripped him.
David Luiz's wasn't a dive, he was laughing even though he got kicked because he baited Rafael out"
The Sergio Ramos ones is disgusting
I'm surprised not all of these were Ronaldo dives
Now i know how ronaldo is not in the list ......ronaldo fangirl
where is the best player of last 20 years in diving
Vidal did not dive.His boots got stuck in between the football field.But he ask the ref for a penalty
David Luiz didn't dive he got the back of his legs kicked pretty hard. He just smiled about it that's all
Rooben gone fault
Where is ronaldo the best diver in the world
And neymar????
"10. Suarez 
9. Suarez

Where is Messi's dive? Oh wait I'm supposed to be a Messi fanboy... where is Ronaldo's dive even though he doesn't have a good one?
Where's ronaldo
Where the one with Eduardo  from arsenal? Lol he revolutionized  diving 😂

The first one was totally crazy lol
Where Jordi Alba, Neymar and Cristiano at?
"Me acuerdo del top 9😔😔😔😔








Pero se quedaron sin mundial 😋😋😋😋😋😋"
These types of players ruin football man
Why don't I see Ashley Young here? If you ever watched the prem you'd know man supposed to be here
"No Ronaldo..
The end is near."
0:55 it wasnt a dive
Vidal 😂😂😂 he tried to fake it while he's feet was on full pain😂😂 and the 0:46 look like fish outta water

Adryan is a dive??
They are proud graduates of FC Barcelona elite "diving" school
The 3rd one wasn't or was it
Exaggerated? Simulated? Yes. All of these were. But many were fouls regardless
You should make a part 2 and put the whole Honduras team vs Mexico
Where is the best player of last 20 years...?!
Horrible robben hoe ass
NO FUE PENAL!!!
Robben didn't dive he stood on his foot, he just makes it look worse
Where's no. 1 diver penaldo
David Luiz one was just briliant
Robben was slightly tackled tho
nooo...noooo Drogba plis
Wrzzer just couldnt put Ronaldo's horrendous dive against Celta on the list :Dd
"Normally I like your vids- this one is just bullshit. There's a difference between dives and acting.
Most of them are just acting: Suarez, Robben, Ramos, Busquets, David Luiz and much more in this video."
Unobjective retarded ronaldo fan
No Ronaldo no like.
Ramos never dived he was actually stomped
football ..a gentleman's game played by hooligans
robben isnt diving at all
First is not diving
Where is Vidal’s dive
"Wait so a RONALDO CHANNEL doesn’t put at least ONE out of several of Ronaldo’s dives in the video??.... well seems fair for a ronaldo fan. Unsubscribed.

I hope you see this"
It's funny how they always hold there face
"Where is ronaldo? 
He is busy in winning international trophy 😂
But penaldo But referee"
Where’s Marcelo Dive, Ramos Other Dive, Suarez Dive , Ronaldo Dives , and Chelsea Players Dive vs Barcelona
sergi 😂😂😂
where is the king of dive?
bias montage but regular divers cannot be considered top players.
Funny how we are talking about most famous dives and yet there isn't a single one form Cristiano
No era penal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no ere penal:(
I just wanna see Neymar va Betis 😍 That dive was amazing 😍 Forza Neymar!!!
"1er video en tou le mende
https://youtu.be/5KBAgkK1lEo"
I was expecting to see 11 barcelona dives.
The vid says famous dives but the they forgot the most famous one The GILARDINO DIVE
Que manera de echar a perder un deporte
van Persie avs Besiktas?You should watch it
Robben one is actually valid. Sure, he over exaggerated a fair bit, but it is a foul.
Where is Gilardino :( ?
Great list, apart from the ones that weren't dives...
where is cr7
Where are the clips of greatest diver penaldo😂😂
Ramos wrong camera. Hes step him
That smug tho @ 1:10
Where did you pay your subscriber?
And no penaldo??
Where's all Ronaldos dives he dives every week. Ronaldo fucker
Where is Ronaldo?
ronaldo?
Busquets... Shame shame shame
"Where is the worst diver in the world..
Cristiano Ronaldo"
The Suarez dive isn't even as famous you fanboy
haha lafFARTy! fuckin idiot!
Who else likes the vid before watching
No peenaldo dive because you're his fan? What a biased video
1:10
Shame on you man...You have 1.3 million subscribers but still dont know what to put in the video just bcoz u r a stupid fanboy... disappointing
Where is the Ronaldo dive involving Lampard or vs Celta? dont be bias please.
U could of made the whole video on Barca players and still be missing some
Ronaldo could have easily filled the list by himself alone 🤣🤣
ALL PLAYERS DIVE WITH NAPOLI, WHY????
Madridiot where is ronaldo,marcelo?You put suarez who didnt dive and didnt put them.Retarded madridog
Why didn’t u put ronaldo diving ????? Huh
1:09
pathetic
0:48 its foul
ITS FOUL MAN LOOK AT THIS 0:30
This is the only thing I hate        about soccer. 😡😡😡
Luis Suárez 😭😭😭😭😭 HDP !!!
There needs to be a no imbelishment rule. All the time, players flop to get fouls and waste time pretending to be hurt. I'd say if I see you flop as a ref i would give a yellow immediately
Don’t worry guys! The Ronaldo compilation is coming! Wrzzer needs to cut down the video because YouTube doesn’t allow videos over 24h!
Dani alves vs real madrid?
All juventus ones
Lmao, madridiot tryin to forget Ronaldo's dives and Marcelo's one v Wolfsburg
No king of diving in the video cr7 . I wonder why lol
what a joke, number 1 diver Ronaldo isn't there? ofcourse a ronaldo fan wouldn't upload it.
Vidal’s wasn’t a dive he kicked the floor Lilke a dumbas
Ronaldo and jordi alba?

I hate divers
Where is Messi?
What about Rafael kicking David Luiz is a dive. A smile because he knows his team outplayed them and that Rafael is an idiot for doing something as dumb as that. That's not a dive.
Idiot is who make this vid
Is there any italian??
Neymar should have been on here more then once
Ggg
Lol
Vidal didn't dive he tripped when he struck the ground
This is why americans hate football
Ramos’ whole career should be here
You forgot every time Ronaldo gets near the ball
abit bias no Ronaldo???
Roben not diving.
Where is Messi Iniesta Gaymar?
Welcome to modern football. The cheaters game
Probably the most humorous video on you tube😂😂😂
Robben and Ramos sucks!
Motherfucking penaldo fanboy is ashamed to post his idol's diving 😂

Where is penaldo !!!
A vidal le patearon el pie antes que patee, el contacto es mínimo pero existe papu :u
Vidal😂😂
where are ronaldo's dives😂
Ramis didnt dive. If u show the whole video and from all the positions of the cameras u can clearly see that cuadrado stepped on his foot. He didnt fall from the hands u show on the video. He fall cause he stepped on him
Biased page
Top 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 must be of Cristiano Ronaldo
Not even a single ronaldo? Bs
I hate number 9&10
I'm asking myself this question, why the hell are there no CR7 dives?
First video isn't a dive, he hit the ground instead of the ball
Where is divenaldo? 😂
suarez dive and they proud of "great comeback" shame people. and ronaldo's dive was very shame! lol!!
Aguante chilee
Diving talent live in barcelona

Where is your boi Ronaldo Diving and Neymar?
Where's cristiano?
Very oğraş oyunçulardı
Actually I read the title as 11 real Madrid legends impossible to forget (ft Ronaldo)
how was Robben's one a dive the defender clearly made physical contacts with him.
I know you all wait for Ronaldo guys just take a look at his profile picture then you see your reason why
Where is Vidal against Werder Bremen??
"Dislike the vid for the uploader not putting ronaldo on this
I am a ronaldo fan but i feel like should be on this list"
Where's Ronaldo? At least 5 of his dives should be here.
Ramos got stepped on unlike jordi alba and yet he didn't get added here😂
Wheres Louis van gaal?
Gilardino's? LOL
BTW Where's Vidal?
I like Barca but Sergio 🚫*DIVER*
Marquinios kneed Suarez and he dives like a moron
Adyryan=Fish in a tank diving
Adryan is the reason why diving glitches are happening on fifa...
"Everyone whining about Ronaldo...
What about Cassano?"
Few players did once in their career from this video. But Ronaldo does it in every game inside penalty box and you haven't include him in this video. This confirms that you are 100% Divenaldo Fan.
At 0:32 the guy was getting hyper
One of them he fell over
That evil smile at 1:11
i can make similar list with all clip from barcelona players
And u forgot to add the god of diving cristiano divenaldo
Football is gay
Where is Ronaldo....???????
Ronaldo top 10 dives?
Diving vido is incomplete without Penaldo
Ronaldo dive v celta vigo???
He is a stupid ronaldo fan and won't put him he is stupid
David luis a clown XD
Arjen Robben should have his own Top 20 Dives
Well u can see that vidal tried to cross it but he hit the grass
"opens the video 
no ronaldo dives 
close the video 
dies"
the first one isnt even a dive ....
I don't see the dives of some of the best divers in the world PENALDO and NEYMAR😂😂😂😂
sergio ramos diving in final was the best
Robben and Suarez had not dived. marquinho had tackled Suarez on the behind his leg and the defender against robben had also fouled him as the defender had stepped on his leg. just look carefully
Thanks man... I was pissed off when robben dived... What an asshole
Firs one wasn't a flop
Where is Ronaldo dive?!?? Wow this channel love ronaldo dick cuz he or she didn't put him on the video about him diving
I thought ksi was going to be on this
Some of These aren't even dives
Ronaldo?
i have been here since 800 subs now 1mil wow
Wrong lists, do some homework
Where is Lord Penaldo?
cristiano vs celta???
Ksi in the charity matches
Bryan from docks milwall
You put 2 times barcelona's players dives...1 for real madrid...where is penaldo? ...I'm sure you are Penaldo fan...BITCH ASS NIGGA
Where is the queen of diver  Cristina Penalda???
Where is penaldo dive's? they are the most funniest one's😂
Where are madrid players.?
Mmm ok for people asking where are ronalodo's dives,stfu kids he can't include ronaldo's dives in this video,he needs a new top 10 ronaldo's dives😂😂😂
Adryan is over reacting
No 2 isnt a dive,he just overreacted and no 4 isnt a dive david luiz was actually fouled
The first one isn t a dive dumbasses. You can clearly see that he kicked the grass and made a hole
Madridiot, where’s ronaldo?
Where is iwobi vs barça?
Cuadrado stepped on sergio ramos
Where is jordi alba hahahahahahha
"Who agrees with me that Ramos:
As a player-10/10
As a person-  -1/10"
Both david luiz and sergio busquets actually got hit but that dosen't mean they have to get hurt or roll for 500 times and let's just ignore Ronaldo isn't here while diving week-in week-out, don't get the Messi and Ronaldo fight here just watch every damn match since he's Man U days till now
Ahahahahahah omggg no Cristiano Ronaldo??!?!!? Ahahhahahahahhahahahahaha
WHERE IS TOP CLASS DIVER RONALDO ????
Can u pls upload real madrid and barcelona full matches?? pls
First Ronaldo came to mind and then Busquets peek-a-boo dive
Hahahaha 2 of them from Barcelona!!! Well done and by the way people who are saying that where is ronaldo, don't u remember Pique dives which was like a stray dog and pessi's dives!!!
Almost every video is from uefadrid and uefalona
i think you forget famous dive of ronaldo also😒😏coz you love him
Bro.. Put a disclaimer at the start of video that "I'm a ronaldo fan"...!!!! No ronaldo clip in dives, cheats and sabotaging goals is like no ronaldinho in skills video...!!!!
Of course he wouldn't put divenaldo in the video, biased af.
Ramos is disgusting cuadrado81 was just going to get the ball and just tapped him and he fell like that he was hammered someone has to ask what was the point of it
For every Messi, every Puyol, there's a Sergio Biscuits. The most annoying thing though is that he's a fine player who doesn't need to try and cheat.
"Ramos was stepped on thus deserved red card for cuadrado.
Though he over simulated the situation but it wasn't a dive."
Where's Ashley Young. He the biggest diver in football while playing for Man Utd
Vidal took a L
What?!! where is Dophinaldo????
The reason why he doesn't put any Ronaldo flops is because he is a Ronaldo fan.
Bale shouid be here vs bvb
#GLEARMY
I like how vidal even points at the guy to make them think he did it when he failed to hit the ball😂😂😂
in #10 cuadrado stomped on his foot and thats a card every day of the week, dive or not
Pals expertise i prefer   this'  illegal
Kkk vidal
no matter what barca fans will never forget the dives of rm players no matter how game changing they were
You missed ronaldo's dives
Where is Ronaldo's red card against barca
Where is Ronaldo in la liga? That is  unforgettable dive ever😂
Robben and Ramos weren't dives. On robben there is clear touch and on Ramos cuadrado steps on his foot that's why he holds his foot
Where's Ronaldo?? he should take like 4 spots out of 11
Ronaldo! Ronaldo! Ronaldo! Ronaldo!
The reason why i dont like ramos anymore ...
"Where is ronaldo
When u edit this video ronaldo dived in ur keyboard so u frgt to add him ryt?"
I thought it was called dive when the tackler didnt touch you. Luiz wasnt a dive.
And the best actor award goes to........tye bastard Sergio Ramos
Can you make top ten dives by Ronaldo?
On 10 : Cuadrado step over Ramos Leg with Boots ...
ronaldo?????????????????????? cmon
divanaldo????
Robbens wasn't a dive. He overreacted but the other guy definitely stands on his foot.
O:45 ksi
First one was no dive
The sad thing is that suarez actually got a penalty for his dive and because of that penalty barca went to the next round instead of psg
Hilarious
Wtf wheres divenaldo
Ronaldo??
where is ronaldo, is suqrez, so where is ronaldo real fanboy
Sergio Ramos the dumpiest one.. Idiot
Ronaldo must be thrice on the list.
Where's neymar and jordi Alba and ronaldo??
Want to dive??  Join barca
Maybe u forget the most drivest in the world
"Where is PENALDO
UR HIS FAN 
DONT BE LIKE THIS
I AM A BARCA FAN BUT I ACCEPT THE DIVING OF SUÁREZ AND BUSQUETS BUT U SHOULD PUT RONALDO THERE SHOULD NO PARTIALLITY"
No era penal :v
OMG Ronaldo made a million dives,that one against Celta none can Forget but not even his single dive included,Ronaldo fan page
well you should make impossible not dives moments to forget
Where are messi's dive ????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Stupid players dumb ones ahahha
Where is Ronaldo's dive against Celta Vigo?
Ronaldo needs a whole video to show his dives collection, that’s why he’s not here. But you can always take a look at few examples here https://youtu.be/8jxKYO_ymt0
If you get hit in the neck or the face, I wouldn't call it a dive
And deli Alli's dive against Huddersfield today lol
Typical Ronaldo FanBoy
Where is cr7 he is the best diver in world in last 20 years
Mmmm , no sergio ramos in the list
Ronaldo king of dive
I'm surprised he didn't put a Ronaldo dive in it or more than 1 dive of Real Madrid
One of the biggest reasons I do not watch soccer. I do not need to see grown men at like 3 year olds on a tantrum.
uefalona always diving tho XD!
Strootman vs Lazio I think was the worst one ever
I'm not saying ramos didn't dive but you can see already before ramos falling cuadrado was turning to apologize so he did at least touched his foot haha
Jordi alba ?
"Where is Ronaldo's dive? 
And especially marcelo's against Wolfsburg"
Vidal  whose not fake
Put Ronaldo in the list idiot admin
Robbem didnt dive😂the other player clearly stept on his foot
"Pathetic channel 
this guy is a ronaldo fan 😂 or maybe he forgot him."
cuadrado stepped on ramos foot thats why ramos  went down . Maybe he was too angry because he got owned with a very clean and nice tackle
0:50 it's not dive !!!!!!!!  1:41 it's not dive !!!!!!!!!!!
0:29 is FOUL
wow no ronaldo on the list........'Madridiot' detected
"Seargo Ramos was the real one if you watch from
other side the other player stepped on his shoes"
One of the reason I don’t like Ronaldo is coz he dives, you will find out the reason he is not In the list by watching the uploaders profile picture
"For the Suarez one:
I am a Barca fan and I agree that it was a dive, however if you look at the clip again, even if Suarez didn't dive it would still be considered as a foul. So I'm just making a point, I still agree that he dived but it would've been a foul anyways."
Suarez 's dive is disgrace...he should be banned for football
Where is penaldo??..the famous useless diver 😂😂😂
About the Sergio Ramos video you can see that the player who  steps on Sergio's feet is saying sorry that means he really steps his foot
Number 4 so funny
The one before the first one was not a dive
Im a Madrid fan but there should be Ronaldo and Ramos shouldnt because Cuadrado stepped on his foot .. Ramos was holding his foot when he was on the ground
Dolphinaldo?
no ronaldo = auto dislike
No Penaldo wtf
ADRIAN WASINT A DIVE
Timo werner against schalke :D?
Ronaldo?.. The king of dives
Im surprised not even 1 ronaldo dive was shown.  Hahaha STUPID
NO ERA PENAL
Of course no ronaldo
Divenaldo Vs Celtic?
I saw that dive at the game real marid vs Juventus ramos dived and the side line ref was right in front of them like if agree
Me mata vidal en su epoca con la cocaina y todavia tiene la decencia de pedir penalti ahhaha
Where is Penaldo
"It's funny that you add Suarez vs PSG, Busquets vs Inter which aren't ""dives"". 

I know now everybody remembers it as a dive, but there are enough footages that show Marquinhos did clip his leg and Marquinhos wasn't even aware of where the ball is (the ball comes from behind and he focuses on Suarez). Pause on 0:56 (just after the screen went black) and look at Marquinhos. The ball is played from behind him and he is looking the other way (he doesn't even know where the ball is), whereas you can clearly see Suarez is following the path of the ball. You can also see Marquinhos move his arm across Suarez (what business does his arm got to do there?) and you can see, although very difficult as this is full speed that he clips Suarez' right calf with his left leg, which brings him down. It's actually a textbook foul. I also wouldn't see any reason for Suarez to go down aswell, as he would've had a clear scoring opportunity.

Suarez exaggerated, but it wasn't a dive.

The same goes for Arturo Vidal. How can you call that a dive, when you clearly see he kicked into the ground, which is why he fell down? He thought that he kicked Illaramendi, that's why he pointed at him, it's pretty simple. Do you really think Vidal is that stupid that he purposely kicks into the grass and then tries to say it's Illarmendi who did it?

Again, same for Busquets. It's not a dive as he clearly dit get Motta's hand on his face. He did exaggerate though, but these things happen like nearly every match. The only reason why people keep calling this a ""dive"" and Busquets a ""diver"" is because he peeked afterwards. I don't know why that should mean it's a dive. Motta shouldn't put his arm/hand out like that.

If you really played football, you would know this. It can happen that you see a player who tries to block your shot and you kick the grass. As we are humans, our brain sometimes automatically connects things. As we feel that we hit something and we saw at the same thing a player stretching their leg, our brain (sometimes) thinks that it was the leg of the player which was what you kicked. 

Same goes for the Suarez ""dive"". Anybody who plays football knows that when they are running full speed to hit the ball, a small ""clip"" of the legs can bring you down. That's exactly what happened here, Marquinhos hit Suarez' calf and denied Suarez a clear opportunity on goal. The only thing what Suarez did here was exaggerate and act like he was shot. But in the end the reaction comes after the action. The action which led to Suarez exaggerating was Marquinhos who clipped him, without going for the ball/knowing where the ball is (clear foul). The reaction shouldn't matter. 

Another example. Let's say a player gets a two footed tackle on his leg, but he doesn't fall or go down, he just continues his run. Does that now somehow mean the two-footed tackle isn't a foul? No, it shouldn't matter wheter you act like you died, you fly ten foot in the air or continue like nothing happened, a foul is a foul. 

Hope you guys get what I mean. A real dive is when you go down with no contact. Not when you accidentally kick into the ground and think you were hit by a player or when you exaggerate despite the fact you are being clipped and denied a goalscoring opportunity by a defender who doesn't even attempt to play the ball.

I would even go so far to say that nearly half of those aren't dives. Exaggerating contact/fouls isn't diving. Diving is faking contact and fouls. There are worse examples than these."
Why is ramos last when hr should 1
where is the "GOAT" penaldoooooooooooooo.....
