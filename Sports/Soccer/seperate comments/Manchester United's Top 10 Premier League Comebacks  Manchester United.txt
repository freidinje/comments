The difference between a club like mu and Real Madrid is that mu knows how to respect their legends which real doesn’t. I feel proud to say glory glory mu
Why can't the team playing like one of these comeback right now ??

I'm from Angola and I love this club <3
Imagine not including the comeback against Tottenham in 2009

Manchester United the true comeback kings
GGMU!
Steward Gardner commentary. I'll watch elsewhere thanks.
Now it was 2-0 down against Newcastle they won 3-2
Beckham is da best
2010 -2011 the power of van persie and chicharito

Manchester United, King of Comebacks
The no4 game made me miss Fergie era united??????????
Did I see Fergie dancing dancing during the Blackpool game??????
Lads, it's Spurs.
2017/2018 man city 2-3 man united is the best
What about when united went 2-0 down and ended up winning 5-2 against spurs back in 08/09?
MU V MC 17/18 should be here. I was watching the game through the TV and after I saw the first goal of MC, I instantly turn off the TV and go to bed ( cause i live in Asia so the game usually start at midnight ). When I woke up in the morning, It really make me shocked and excited after i know that MU won the match. It was the best moment of my life supporting MU. Who says MU do not a miracle moment like that anymore
The 17/18 game where pogba score two goal against man city should be here
I think best come back mu vs Bayern in final champions leage
One thing i remember about the 2012/13 season was the amount of games in all competitions where we've had to come from behind to win
Make United Great Again!!!!
Best moment ..Love United..??????
Ferguson time
Legend player .
U missed one the game at Old Trafford where spurs we leading 2-0 at halftime. Then we won the match. Rooney Ronaldo berbatov all scored in a classic encounter. One of the best matches at Old Trafford.
babi haram dimakan
vs Middlesbrough the best end year party and feeling ever
I miss Van Persie
where is the comeback from 2-0 down away against Man City last season?!!!
No one can bend it like Beckham.
Why is mou still here go please before juve at home or young boys away
That Giggs pass to Cantona was insanely beautiful
This is the old Man.utd we've known but now ... so sad but true
that will take a lot of time now to see the old UNITED :'(
Ronaldo ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??
Is Alan Partridge doing the commentary ????
why can't united play like that now
Nothing here compares with Istanbul... Just Saying
Miss those glory days
Class that’s how United should be playing , I miss how we don’t play like this at the moment ??
Degea-cesar Valencia-Maicon Bailly-samuel Lindelof-lucio Shaw-zeneti Matic-Cambiassi Fred-motta Pogba-stankovic Lingard -sneider Sanchez-etoo Lukaku-milito
Degea-cesar Valencia-Maicon Bailly-samuel Lindelof-lucio Shaw-zeneti Matic-Cambiassi Fred-motta Pogba-stankovic Lingard -sneider Sanchez-etoo Lukaku-milito

Commentator is awful
Such a shame you posted this before this season's away City game
utd 3-2 city the game last season remember?
Man city vs Man u EPL season 16- 17, ended 2/3. Man city was up 2/0 then Man u came back with pogba scored a brace.
Actually couldn't finish the video coz of the commentator just worse than watching united play under Jose mourinho
Beckham's expression after scoring is the epitome of a united player. Never Die
The 4-3 against Citeh when Owen got that 95th minute winner!
The commentator for the games against West Ham and Blackpool is APPALLING! Every comeback is the comeback to end all comebacks!?!?
Where is MU 2-1 Bayern UEFA Champions League final 1998
5-2 v Spurs 2009?? 2-0 down at half time
Beckham Beckham!
And that is goodnight Tottenham Hotspur
Fu*&* commentary
From 0-3 to 5-3 blownmind
Wer is the champions league final vs Bayer & Tottenham 5-3
manchester the biggest History team in the world
woooooooooow we were sick during fergies era sad i was 12 or 13 when fergie left only seen rubbish football as a teenager and didnt watch regular football before 2013
17!!! machedddddddddddddaaaaaaaa
who's chris eagles loooool
miss the giggs hernandez berbatov days
the west ham 4-2 game ive been looking for that for some time still remember it i think rooney got banned for swearing into the camera after his pen comeback?
??????????????????
Commentator is Awful
look at the fire and attitude of the players in these games.
The greatest comeback was the Champion's League final in 1999. The whole game it felt like United had no chance. And stopped attack after attack from Bayern. And a crossbar. And yet they clawed back in it...
And where is the comeback against Aston Villa in 2012/13 when Chicharico scored 3 times??? and he was substitute. No chicha, no like.
???? ????? ??????
We miss ronaldo
Forgot one big one City Vs Utd 4-3 to Utd Owen scored in extra time
Best play pirmeir league Manchester united?
I want CR7 BACK in united
MU forever
Where is ManUnited 4-3 Newcastle??
most of epic comeback came from fergie's era...
epic comeback
really legendary
miss. those. moment.
Ronaldo Back!
united 5-2 spurs? city 2-3 united?
Just recommendation, Man U 2 Chelsea 1 and Man U 3 Man C 2 both in 2017-18 season.
1-0 to 1-2 isn’t a comeback it’s easy
Rooney my best player ever at united
I miss Ronaldo at the team
Always Comebacks needs Beckham! Glory united??
What a club!
Berbatov tells a story, that right before United beat Spurs 5-2 in 09, Fergie had them watch the 5-3 win from 01. Coincidentally they were 2-0 down at halftime.
wheres martin tryler commentary for mechada?????????????
All super united games.........
I wish Crystal Palace vs Man UTD and City vs United was here ..... Those matches this season were awsome especially against City was amazing
City 2-3 United at Emptyhad 2018 was best
RvP the Real Beast! ??
MU epic comeback
what type of dance is pogba doing
i love manchester united
As always the best team in this world
ggmu
No 2 is the best for me! Ggmu??
the first game I saw and unforgotten were Spurs vs Man Utd, even though only second half.. but that match made me loved football and Man Utd until now..
THE UNITED COMEBACK!
What about the recent Manchester derby comeback fellas!!
Arsenal 7 Reading 5
Can you please show the time
Park please
Where's Martin Tyler?
You should keep the score up so we can tell what the score is. The score you give at the beginning is confusing...is that when the video starts or when the other team scores or what??? Just a thought!
Comeback kings
Van persie vs saints ????.... The song as well ?? is brilliant.... What is the name of the song?
I want to live in the past
Rooney back to United
You've got to put the derby game from last week lads
Miss U RVP ??????
Chelsea
You could wait with this video for this year's Etihad derby.
Man City 2-3 Man Utd
I would like Jose to bring back Chicharito if Martial leave Old Trafford
Berba is so underrated
I miss ferguson af
City 2-3 United would be here
GO GO MU....
How about that 3-0 comeback vs Chelsea in 2011? That was vintage united
Now you have to add the great comeback against city :)
the latest match vs Man City@Etihad...!! ABSOLUTELY CRAZY..!!
Bayern vs Utd 98/99 Champions League Final should be no.1.
Update it!!
New update is required for the Manchester derby of 2018. Great memories.
City 2-3 United 07/04
Dont to forget the derby game 2-3 hehe
Missing 3-2 when City should have won the league
Sometimes in the future, we should include THE Manchester Derby, when United confirmed Manchester is RED
Might need to add one
Todays win should be on this
Just got today's derby game to add to that list :D
There were some fantastic comebacks in that video!! Love watching the Red Devil's making me proud to be a Utd fan!!!
Javier Hernandez's United career should be up here. What about Spurs 5-2 and of course Munich 2-1?
miss rooney young
This club makes me so happy ????
I love Manchester United
To me, the best Utd comeback has to be the 1999 UCL Final
Me Love Manchester United forever
Mata is the best
Merinding??????
beckham curve ball is the best thing ever happened
I guess you guys should be adding the Crystal Palace comeback huh ?
Manchester is always red
Was weird seeing ronaldo celebrate when someone else scored
Coming back is our culture GGMU
Crystal Palace 2-3 Manchester United Yet another Comeback
Chicaa Is A gem...
2 great comebacks back-to-back in the PL since this video was posted.
The way ball is flying in the air, with clinical finishing. What a love
best
who’s here after the palace game?
We need a new vid... 3-2 Crystal palace 2018 WOW
Best comeback Man Utd vs Bayern Munich UEFA Champions league final 1999
The game between man utd and man city that ended 4-3 should be included as well
#11 Crystal Palace 2- Manchester United 3. March 2018!!!!!!!!
RVP IS ORRROSPU EVLADI
??????????
Some great comebacks come on United
That Middlesbrough game was the best game under mourinho. It was like the United of old
Lads, it’s Tottenham
MANCHESTER UNITED IN MY HEART!!!
I think Manchester united vs tottenham 5-2 was worthy of this list.
Brian Kidd running on the pitch celebrating is iconic as hell.
R10
Memories worth their weight in gold.
come back kings
nice comebacks may i know what is the title of the background song is used in the #9? :)
ye!!!
You must add tunnel cam videos.Greetings from Bosnia ?? GGMU
Mint
Hello
Oy sir Alex
I'm sure if it wasn't PL only then the 1999 champions league final would be here
Van perse :(
Viet Nam  : ok
11)Leicester city vs Man Utd (5-2)
Then: its Spurs lad Now: its Man United lad
Wayne Rooney ??
best channel ever!!!!!!!! love united stand and the full time devils ..but this is the original legend
its tottenham lads....
Being honest i am a Manu fan but it was extremely boring video
Manchester is my life
If this was all comps, it would be Bayern vs MUFC, Champions league final
The Macheda goal was epic
United 4ever ??
Villa vs United 2012/13; Chelsea vs United 2011/12; United vs Spurs 08/09
2-1 Chelsea :DD
Could have made it a top 20 but love the momories. Glory United!!!
Man I miss roomy my old favourite player why was he so bad
What about the Michael Owen winner game against Man City which ended 4-3 ?
GALATASARAY
Only haters dislike these comebacks
There's one more match against Tottenham where Ronaldo and Modric played... I can't remember the scoreline but that too was very interesting.
Hi
van persie uçuyor burda. bizde yatti zepevenk herif
Is this new or already man utd have an official youtube channel???
Vayy v.persie vayy
The music is very loud and noisy
To all Neuer fans, Neuer is an unreal Goalkeeper and is superb with his feet. But when it comes to shotstopping De gea is the best
??????
Algum Br aki?
This compilation epitomises what United is about. We used to win games literally by force!
I think the recent victory of 2-1 with Chelsea also deserves to be one of the greatest comebacks
am turkey abone manchester united i like bekchamm
Hands down the 5-2 comeback from 0-2 against the spurs at half time should be there. That was the day grown men cried tears of joy.
That's a very awesome
Where on earth is the 2009 Spurs game, 5-2? Incredible game and of huge importance. Instead we've got 2-1 Boro.
Lads, it's Tottenham.
happy day
Makes me cry a lil
Chichadios ??
Beckham ??
Manchester United 5-2 Spurs. 2008/09
Red armyyyyyy
Brilliant comebacks
Sir Alex Ferguson years was the best.
I thought the caption said Premier League comebacks but why is there a match from Carling ?
GGMU,,THANKS FOR THE CHANNEL
miss them days
yeah that game against spurs was truly inspirational.Comeback kings for a reason
rename it please this is only united, very dissapointing
Sir Alex was the King of Comebacks.
Tuy?t v?i! Fan ? VI?t Nam di?m danh :))
That just upset
considering how much chelsea had us pinned in the first half i consider that win a great comeback.
fergie time
???????? ????????)
I am a Rayal Madrid fan since childhood.But I still remember there was a time Rayal and Manchester at pinnacle of their form.Rud Vaan Nistle Roy,Giggs,Beckham,Ferdinand,Brown..What an era ?.that was an another level of Manchester.
Magnificent
For me Utd-Tot 5:2 has to be on the list... 2:0 down on OT and some fascinating football in 2 half... CR7, Rooney and others on top of their game, sublime
Vintage united
Great content already on this channel, everybody make sure to like and share this and all the other videos. Congrats to whoever is putting it together....
Ahh Ferguson's emotions <3
Isn’t there a game 3-2 with chelsea in 09/10 season or something ?!
The Champions League Final 1999 should be here
5-2 vs Spurs The Rooney-Ronnie's destruction of Spurs?
I love you Manchester United Meh I come in Thailand
Nistelroooooooy!!!!!!!
Where is our 2-1 comeback against Munich in champions league final???
Idc what u say manchester united is the best
I still remember that 5-3 win against spurs. I already losing hope when the half time whistle is blown and turn off my TV,but a curiosity about how united manage to do something in the 2nd half made me to turn on the tv again and instantly witnessed the first goal, then i choose to stay and the rest of comeback is happened, and then since that day i never doubting united will make a comeback again. SAF is the only manager who can produce such quality play and mentality with such an average squad. The best manager ever be.
should add aston villa 2-3 utd into the video
WE ARE UNITED WE ARE BEASTS
What about the comeback on bayern Munich in 1999
Everybody let's subscribe to man utd
Missing Ronaldo !
Comeback Kings #United4Life
Man I miss Chicharito at the club!
No one club ever can get that remark perfectly Like united
How about the champions league final back in 99?
tu putadsadas
GGMU
those days..
The chant at the end is similar to megadeth's symphony of destruction
lol
lol
I loved Pogba's celebration ??
Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea: 2-25-18
i still hear "Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea!" at 8:17
european cup?
Chicharito 1:40 VIVA México
When you’re watching the second one and realize how old Mark Noble is and how sad it is that he spent his whole career at West Ham...
5-2 against Spurs (Rooney and Ronny) 4-3 against Newcastle (Hernandez winner from a sublime Carrick pass)..
nobody does it better, nobody does it like manchester united. the comeback kings!
Final champions league 99 in Barcelona against Munich
Leeds leeds leeds
About time you Brought the team up to date with social media, I expect to see player challenges and interviews here
For me the best Manchester United comeback when beaten Bayern Munich in the UCL Final 1999
I love my home team i have seen your man united/BEST EVER TEAM i think you should try to get rid of filani and i think your the best maniger in the world your bigest fan in the world George thank you cant ewait for livipoo to play you i wish you luck i hope you win
Plz do a de gea montage of his best saves
It's my birthday
Subtitulos en español para los fans de latinoamerica ?
Rooney did so much for utd
Thank You, Kiko! <3
Tunnel cams! that's all we want
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
LOVE MUFC.
Tottenham 5-3 game
De gea keeper is the best
Rooney is a legend
WEEEEEEEEE LOVE YOU UNITED WE DO WE LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE U UNITED WE DO!!! OHHHHHHHHH UNITED WE LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. CITY IS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAP. Like if you agree
MUTV commentary is so whiny and dreadful
Loving that United are now on YouTube, could watch for hours, just wish we could play as brilliantly as (most) of these United team's did.
3-3 vs chelsea little pea
If only we were watching great performances and passion like that today
The comeback against spurs 5-3 2008/09 was epic and best ever!
2-1 against chelsea love ittt
FINALLY! you guys got a channel im so happy been the biggest manu fan ever since i was little! xxx
We are the best team in the league
United 5-2 Spurs was a very special game in my opinion. 45 mins of Rooney Ronaldo Tevez and Berbatov at their best brutally demolishing tottenham and making absolutely sure that title no.18 was coming to OT. That 4-3 vs city in 09/10. Chelsea 3-3 in 11/12 from 3-0 down 2012/13 season had quite a few comebacks villa2-3 united, united 4-3 newcastle on boxing day, southampton 2-3 united
FC Bayern Final Champions League
The City and Spurs comebacks were unreal, that first time ball from Giggsy for the 2nd against City was world-class.
chicharito i miss you
Cole & Beckham were my 2 favs!!
outside of premier league, i think one of the best combacks would be 1998/99 UCL Final VS Bayern Munich
Training cam's.
I miss those glory days ??
i love it
Replace number 10 with the 4-3 vs city when Owen scored the winner
Just what i needed
IF YOU NOTICED MOST OF THEM WERE FROM THE FERGIE TIME . BACK THEN ALL MAN UNITED KNEW WAS TO "WIN" . THEY HAD PASSION & DESIRE TO WIN. NO FANCY HAIRCUTS ,NO FANCY CARS , NO FANCY CELEBRATION JUST PURE CLASS. HOPE JOSE BRINGS MORE POSITIVITY TO THE TEAM . GGMU??
Machedaaa!!!!!!
comeback kings
United 5-2 Spurs, 2009 should be in there!!
#GGMU #MUFC ??
Literally don't remember number 4 dunno why
plz dont leave man u
Love that RVP hat-trick, I thought we'd blown it when he missed the pen
1:14 Look at how he puts away this half chance. Rooney used to be an absolute predator in the box. Especially around 2010-2011.
Hope the Macheda winner is on here
United United United ????
Man united aka the comeback kings
This channel is AMAZING so far
hello Tottenham
4-3 Comeback vs Man City in 2009 where Owen scored at the last minute
RVP forgot how good he was.
5:14 that assist from Giggs :O
oii , esse time é bom dms
That spurs game was the greatest comeback in PL history
United 5-2 Spurs was a good one
i think the current team is as good as previous teams. just need to be more clinical and lethal in attacking!
The only thing I can say is GGMU
5-2 Against Spurs?
The only people who dislike are definitely city fans just so it has dislikes
Man utd vs liverpool in 1998/99 fa cup.
The game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Feb 2012 3-0 down after 50 minutes and came back to get a draw
Where was the game that Ronaldo scored the diving header against Tottenham?
RVP absolute legend.
This team is the comeback kings/devils
Coloquem na velocidade 1.5x pra ver a dança dos caras kkkkk.
Loved it... ?
Subtitle indonesia please haha
Song ??
United!!!
Sir Alex ??
David Beckham 7!
GGMU....Manchester is and always will be red....
Hes a united fan and a commentator but not showing as heart tbh
Utd 5-2 Spurs 2008/09
10 isn't enough.. more about 30 i think
If only you add the minute of the goal.. it would be much better
Time after time under Fergie we'd comeback from the dead, so many epic moments over the years.
Biggest club in the world man United
That spurs 3-5 United the 1st match I watched live as United fan.that time I didn't even know Man United is country or club Then I started following the matches and become die hard United fan.but you missed United 5-2 Spurs game.
Vs chelsea last night?
Add the tunnel cam videos
Munich comeback???
I'm a massive man utd fan From Jack !
GGMU??????????
Missing the 5-2 vs spurs in 09
What about Man UTD 4-3 Necastle on boxing day 2012? Newcastle took the lead three times and we still won!
Give the dreadful music a rest, eh?
During Sir Alex Era, United were totally something else.. With an unmatched never say die attitude, the game never seemed to have slipped from our hands.. In the post Ferguson Era that attitude seemed to have lost though United are slowly getting back there..
Why are we soo good! ???? Oh yess we are the best. Glory Glory Man United
Up United
We do make it hard for ourselves. But these matches ????
I love united ????????
Honestly you could make a top 50. So many magical moments over the years. What a club. Just what a club.
Vs man city in community shield?
where is the 5:2 vs spurs..not the 5:3 the 5:2
5-2 spurs at home ?
Chris Eagles, very underrated
United 5-2 Spurs ,United 3-3 Chelsea, United 4-3 Newcastle, all should have been honorable mentions. Great list regardless.
This is Manchester United!!!
Great comebacks, awful commentary ??????
No ´99 Champions Final...oh dear, who made this? a twelve years old kid?: C´mon is in the history of football!!!
5-2 spurs instead of 2-1 spurs
What a coincidence. I just searched for a united comeback few hours ago and here we go.
Wayne Rooney ??
You missed the 5-2 against Tottenham in 2008/2009.
Macheda !!!!!!
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
