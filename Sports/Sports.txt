I’ll never tire of watching Vegas get stomped ?? Vegas you suck. Lol
ace
I can't forget this moment, it was a great day. Thanks Capitals
I take back everything I've said about Braden Holtby after this Cup win. I said hes a Regular Season goalie and he couldn't make the saves when it counts. Now after this I realize I was wrong.
Getting drunk in public since their win, but since they're not a mostly black NBA or NFL team, no public outcry. I do, however, respect that they didn't go to.play kissy-face with Trump's dumb ass.
Brooks Orpik keeping the puck in at the line and then blasting that sick nasty pass through two pairs of Vegas players to get it up to DSP for the game tying goal of 3-3.... gorgeous. complete veteran awareness on that, the younger guys wouldnt have the poise to make that play.
I'm just here revisiting the moment that the Golden Knights' magic finally ran out. I really thought they were going to go all the way.
The music has got to go lmao
Is it me or did Hughson sound tired in this game?
5:18 When you finally beat that boss level...
luck and a hot goalie formula finally failed. Vegas gotta wait and suffer like every other team
If this ever gets old...bury me!
What the hell is it Boooooooooooring sport
The tears (and booze) flowed liberally in Washington, D.C. that night. It was...beautiful.
My caps yes
THE WASHINGTON CAPITALS ARE THE 2018 #STANLEYCUP CHAMPIONS! #ALLCAPS
What a snipe by Smith
never gets old ovi lifting the cup.
its been a month, Im still crying every time I watch this.
Ovechkin is friggin huge, man. No wonder he is hardly knocked off the puck.
Listen to the crowd when the Caps score. There were so many fans in red
Sheer will and talent defeat rigged outcome from Bettman and cronies. One of sports greatest moments.
I feel Vegas will win....
I'm happy for Ovechkin, Backstrom, and Holtby because they definitely deserve this. Also Trotz did an amazing coaching job. Still though, I would just like to point out that the officiating was incredibly inconsistent at best, and I still have no idea how the ref's missed the two incredibly obvious trips that happened in the final 30 seconds, that should have given Vegas at least one power play.
Eller for the Win
ovi yeti?
Will Vegas maintain this level or play or will they crash hard next year...
This was our year but whatever ovi won a cup
Made this tribute for Ovi! peep it https://youtu.be/25Y15II9isg
One could say the Caps... had this season on Lock.. HEH
Alexander Ovechkin without Olympic gold, but with Stanley Cup, God does not give all at once.
Pekka Rinne is too good right now
I'm going to wait until next year's pre-season games before offering any congrats. It's the Caps. They might still choke...
They deserved it, good year for Knights tho
GLAD THE CAPS WON BUT OVECHKIN IS GOING TO BE GETTING ALOT OF ASS ACTIVITY SOON BECAUSE TRUMPFUCK IS GOING TO BE KISSING HIS PUTIN LOVING ASS!!!
The Knights did great in their First Year \[T]/ #PraisetheSun
Congrats to the Capitals! ???? ????.
NR. 8  Capitals and Stanley Cup (deserved)
Wow Fleury was awesome playing this night, even if my Caps won!!! But have to give credit to the resilient Golden Knights who never quitted. ALL CAPS!!!!!!!
Smith-Pelly's goal was one of the all-time greatest goals ever
1:50 they're not going to show the other angle of one of the most beautiful saucer passes I've ever seen?
the memes are dead, people
I really wanted Vegas to win but congrats to the capitals. I understand it is a big thing for Ovechkin to raise the cup, he finally got it.
My reaction to watching this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62f4GcpYMIw
The golden knights had a great preshow for a loss.
Whoop Whoop
I could tell that they stood out from the pile since November and I don't even follow NHL regularly, well done Caps!
to everyone that said the caps would blow a 3-1 lead, how do you like the 4-1 outcome to win the cup and beat the media hyped bandwagon favorited unbeatable Vegas team
Thank you Caps. Thank you a thousand times! Been waiting a lifetime for this!!!! DSP, Holts, Kuzy, TJ, Nicky, Ovi, Lars, Beags, all of you, true heroes!!!!!
I think Sbisa is literally the worst hockey player in history
As a canucks fan let me tell you Washington fans be grateful ovi got to lift the cup it's a shame the sedins couldn't get it done in Vancouver
Ok, you got your cup, now go back to the exciting all scoring machine you started off as.
Thank you Sbisa, job well done . I'm so glad Vegas pick you up.....Bhahahaha
Flames fan! But have been rooting for Ovi for years! Great captain, loves his team, holtby too many great saves! They deserve it!
The fakest number 1 seed of the nhl is the Los Vegas Golden Knights lmfao ?? ?? ?? ??
Happy for Ovechkin, he was always so close. Now this won't torment him
Rock the Red
I'm happy for Trots
The way Smith-pelly stopped the puck with his skate is sick thats the reason he scored
Like him or not Ovie deserves to win. No one in the NHL deserved it more than the guy who dominated in goal scoring since entering the league.
Vegas has never won a Stanley Cup. Was rooting for them to end that curse. Oh well.
NHL world most boring sport
Good for him. Finally a cup
The hometown (Washington) Capitals (2018 Stanley Cup winners) will be going to the WH only if star (Conn Smythe winner) Ovechkin goes. Ovechkin happens to be RUSSIAN too- which is a plus as far as Trump is concerned. Maybe a back channel to Russian "heavyweights" can be set up lol Never miss an opportunity to network and get some kickbacks. Trump is starting to become somewhat of a "pinko" despite being orange with white half-moons under his eyes.
Turn of the lights maybe next year
I have no animosity towards Washington sports and for some unknown reason I've always wanted every Washington team in ever major sport to lose.. But Ovechkin deserved this. Props to him
Caps just showed the Jets how to pump TWENTY goals by Fleury in FIVE games! Hockey nerd Scheiffle will have been taking notes. Jets should have beat Vegas, but Caps would have been tough to handle in the final.
Way to go caps I live in Arlington Virginia watched the whole series go caps go what a win
Ugh, Eller, Smith-Pelly, Jerabek, two of them figured largely in the caps success in the playoffs, one of them a cup winning goal. Oh, boy does that ever look bad on Bergevin. It looks really bad.
What a beauty of an equalizer by Smith-Pelly!!
People give ovechkin lot of credit but don't forget Kuznetsov, backstrom, tom Wilson , eller, Smith - Kelly , Holtby, all had an impact .
All thought they lost Vegas is still the best expansion team of all time. There fans should be proud they made it here. Good job caps
Will we ever get this close for an entry team to win the first season ever again, no.
It is sad to watch amazing players play their whole nhl career and never get to hold the cup. Ovechkin finally got to hold the cup over his head. I can only imagine how good it feels.
Okay game 6 is an absolute must win for the Knights.
Great 8!!!!
Luca Sbisa should get his name on the cup. Maybe not engraved like the rest. What's the opposite, embossed?
Jets fan since '82. Obviously I wanted the Jets to take the cup, however I could not be happier that Ovi and the Capitals got it. I've been cheering for the Caps for years now (When the Jets were not even a team or when they were not making the playoffs) and I almost welled up seeing Ovi hold the cup. Never has an NHL player deserved a cup more than him.
Well done, CAPS! FREE artist: foreal pat
????????? ??????????! ???????? ??????. ???? ?????? ????????? ? ????????? ?????.
Oilers fan here.So Happy for the Caps and OV. Been a fan since his first season in the NHL. Congrats on taking that monkey off their backs. They were due.
Looked like a great game.
Can't wait to read the article about how Ovi didn't backcheck enough. #oldboysclub
Los Vagas should have won because Washington sucks
Sickest shirt ever man https://teespring.com/capswin#pid=2&cid=568&sid=front
Well, despite the loss, for an expansion team the Golden Nights had one HELL of a first season.
VeGaS iN fOuR
Cup in Washington. Better than Vegas but still a disgrace to Lord Stanley's name
im kinda sad that the knights didint get the cup, but the caps deserve the cup more than we, they gone 45 years with no cup, while the knights are there for 1 season, the caps deserve it more than we, go knights go
Ovie finally, congrats..
Probably the best playoffs ever in sports.
Still sinking in -- surreal that the Caps won the cup. So awesome. The DSP game tying goal was amazing.
One of the worst scf, refs rigged for caps, the only good thing is that ovi got a cup
ON TRENDING!
Ovi finally won it. Here I was thinking he had to be traded to win the cup and proved me wrong. Congrats Ovi and congrats to the Capitals and their fans.
VEGAS IN 4
All the bets that people lost lol
Good job Caps from a Knights fan
Where’s the chick with her tits out lmaoo
Congratulations Caps. Bad luck Golden Knights. #VegasStrong
Penguin fans saying caps fans are dicks for saying “they will never get to the Stanley cup”....you guys said that to caps fans and karma stinks.
Boo
Reaves: "What are you gonna do??? ??" Well for starters, win the Stanley Cup while you sing Minnie the Moocher on the bench
Always wanted Ovi to get one
?? ????? ?????????? ????? ???????????...
Dammit!
Nice to see Danish Lars Eller score the deciding 4-3 goal to win the Stanley Cup!
They deserve it they wanted it more than anyone and they were prepared
Some Capitals fans have literally been waiting for this moment since the team was created. What has it been, 44, 45 years? That's half a life time. There are 40 or 50 year old men and women who've been watching the team since they were kids who've never seen them succeed. I just can't help but imagine what this means to the Capitals fans. It's not quite the Cubs, but it's been a long time coming and all the memes, curses, all the stipulations are dead. They deserved this one.
??????????, ?????????!
Diehard Penguins fan here - FULL marks to this team. They've been through so many playoff disappointments, and this year they earned the Stanley Cup. Congratulations, Capitals & fans.
That elation shown from Ovechkin and the Capitals and Niskanen and all those guys who seemed cursed. Backstrom, Holtby, Carlson. My god that was amazing to watch the joy. You finally did it, Washington. You guy's finally broke the curse and I'm so god damn happy for you. I have some sadness for seeing Fleury come up just short of 3 cups in a row and seeing a story book end to Vegas' ride but Washington deserved it and they played like the team who earned it. So awesome, congratulations Washington fans.
Capitals freakin suck, they just got lucky. Pens are best
Alexander Ovechkin is finally LEGIT!!!!!!! I'm so happy for him!!!
Russian hockey player Ovechkin frontman of the Hyper-Patriotic movement "Putin team" won for "Washington" the first Stanley Cup and is happy about this fact together with the whole America... And the patriots of "Putin team" are also happy with America???
Yes they won
Probably one of the best playoff game I have ever seen.
Congrats to the caps! Ovi deserves it!
Fleury is too hot right now. LMAO
Smith-Pelly, Eller Why Bergevin why???
Knights keep your heads up high boys you guys had a great 1st year in the NHL season you boys will be world champions soon im so proud to be a Knights fan ?
The cup is always won o the road these days
Ovechkin is "Daaaaaaaaa!!!!" ??
Not a Cpas fan but its great seeing Ovi win the cup
Clock stops working last minute of play, a chick flashing tits during the cup ceremony on live TV... what an awesome day!!!
They will probably choke in the second round again next I really wanted Vegas to win they ran out of gas when they played Washington I feel sorry for vegas
161 fans of Cirque du Soleil
Finally ovi you got it. You and caps deserved to win!
Ovi is a big supporter of dictator Putin by the way.. just want you to know about that fact
THANK YOU CAPS....SO SICK AND TIRED OF THESE ANNOYING ELVIS ES IN THE BUILDING PRETENDING THEY CARE ABOUT HOCKEY...SO SICK AND TIRED OF THE VEGAS PRE GAME BS CRAP.. GOLDEN SHOWERS SUCK
????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ?? ?????)))) ??????? - ??????? ???????
Congratulations Capitals on winning the Cup.  Congratulations Golden Knights for an outstanding season.
awesome for Ovi to finally win, but he's got Holtby and the rest of the team to thank for that. About time Caps.
I followed the whole season for the first time in my life and it was awesome! Next year I hope the Kings take it!
Welcome to being real nhl fans now Vegas. Maybe you'll get to another cup final in the next 20 years like the rest of us.
?? ????????? ?????? ??????? ????? ?????????? - "?????????" ?.?. ????? ??? ? ??????? ????????
Wanted Vegas to win in 7 but congrats to the Capitals well deserved
they'd never would have beat the jets
Good for them! Well deserved. And kudos to the Golden Knights too. Two great teams. Happy for Ovie.
You showed everything except that chick flashing the Caps at the end. Kind of disappointed in you.
First y’all told me the Pens were gonna beat them, then y’all said the lightning were gonna KILL the caps in 4 or 5 lol, and lastly the Knights were too fast and strong and would smack em around in 6.
Well deserved congratulations Ov and the Caps
This isn’t the first time Vegas got shot up.
congrats to ovi but the Knights are the first NHL team to win a stanley cup final in their inaugural season
Congrazte Capitals :D
#ALLCAPS -Stanley Cup Champs nuff said :-)
He finally won Alex O finally did it
Ovie look like an Babarian, what a beast
1:20 djoos was definitely interfered with. How did refs miss that, puck squirts out of Fleury's pads and djoos gets tackled
Ovechkin deserves Stanley Cup like Ray Bouruqe did
Pens fan. I wanted so much for Caps to lose but Ovi deserves every award he has. I'm now glad for him. The caps had the fire the pens had 2 years ago. I didn't think the Pens would get past the caps in 2nd round. Congrats Washington. Enjoy.
Fleury did enough on this night, Neal and many of his team mates had carte blanche with the zebras down 3 games to one, Rocket Richard entered the body of Smith-Pelly and in 1972 we became aware that Russians could play hockey...in a Big way.
Finally <3
Ove broke the curse.
Fleury is just to good right now
??????????????????????
Ovie deserved one, the Knights fans deserve to suffer like the rest of us. Welcome to the NHL, Vegas
Ovechkin is the best hockey player in the world ...
Vegas SILVER Knights
They will say Russians hacked NHL
Now the Blues need to win the cup next.
DAMMIT
Congrats Caps that was some great hockey to watch. What a team, their individual puck-handling ability and passing plays were so crisp throughout the series, completely handcuffed Vegas.
Man show a little bit of the skate around with the cup!! Wtf
So sad
Some bad calls in this game.
Won't be any footage of them doing the cup parade because of the lady in the white dress was tits out as they went by...vegas
You gotta respect Lars Eller he was really good in the playoffs. When Backstrom was injured he we’re an amazing backup. And he got the season winning goal for Washington!
2018 is tough. First the eagles, now the capitals took away championshipless memes.
Let’s be honest, after all this time Ovi deserved a cup
So pumped, long time fan, 44 years is long enough! Glad it happened in the ovi era!
????? ?????
I think if Vegas had some more over-the-top theatrical performances before the game and maybe another Lil John performance complete with Travis Barker beating his little drum, then maybe Vegas could have won more than 1 game in the finals. C-A-P-S CAPS! CAPS! CAPS!
????? ????????? ?? ?????? ? ????????!!!!!!!!!!!
???????????? ????????? ? ????? ??????!!!!
Smith-Pelly's goal ?? That guy sure gave it his all during the playoffs.
The referees lost againt washington
Knights in 9... wait a minute... All jokes aside tho congrats to Ovi and the caps on their first cup! They deserved it!????
Caps flopping around like LeBron last night.
just to easy to blame Sbisa for all, the capitals were just the better team.
They really earned this Cup with how they played through each round. And I say this as a Rangers fan.
Man, Ovi lifting up that cup seemed like a movie
Was Fleury not at least given an award? He played really well, while the finals wasn’t the best for him he still made many great saves and games before that he barley let any in most of the time lol
Washingtons first Stanely cup? wow...I thought they had one way back in time lol. turned out I was terribly wrong there
Alex ovechkin, Washington capitals, Stanley Cup champion, never thought I'd see the day when those words come together, I'm far from a caps fan and I never will be, never been a fan of ovi either but it just looked like every fibre in his being took a massive sigh of relief, congrats ovi! You finally did it! ??????
Notice how the Vegas fans didn’t even stay to congratulate the team that “did so much” for the city. It emptied out right after the clock ran out. That’s real hockey support right there
2:23 bullshit goal
russian hacking
I doesnt follow NHL but I reallu hopea that vegas had won couse first season in NHL AMD stanley cup but atleas ovi got his first stanley cup
Sens fan but I always had a deep respect for Ovechkin. I was very happy for him because he deserved one.
Capitals deserved that piece of honor known as the Stanley Cup, they also needed it.
About time guys, this squad was too good to not get at least one.
Congratulations Caps goosebumps
This gives me chills
Pittsburgh remembers when Fleury had Swiss cheese gloves
For the first time in for ever
I'd like to personally extend my congratulations to the Golden Knights for winning the "we-didn't-care-about-winning-because-no-one-even-expected-us-to-be-here" award. We've heard it all year from you guys and now we'll enjoy it too because no one remembers the losers.
Vegas lost ???? ah hahahaha What just happened didn’t stay in Vegas
My opinion is that ovechkin didn't deserve the Stanley cup.... his shot is the only thing that keeps him in NHL
That's cool!!! Heartfelt happig Washington From Germany! Ohne and Co deserve that! ??????????????????????????????????????????????????
ovi deserves to win the cup...what a great thing Vegas lost...
????? ???????-???? ???? ???? ???????? ????? !
Putin and Ovi are best friends. Tough russian guy
??
Let's goo dc
Congrats Ovi and the Caps from a Flyers fan I am so glad u guys finally exorcised all ur demons lucky 13 for u Ovi I know exactly how u guys and ur fans feel as I felt the exact same way when my Eagles finally won back in February
Ovi is going to take the cup to Russia and we’ll never see it again
Three teams have won their first championship between 2017 and now: Houston Astros win 1st World Series, Philadelphia Eagles win 1st Super Bowl, and now Washington Caps win 1st Stanley Cup.
So HONESTLY, where does Ovechkin rank in regards to greatest all-time, or top whatever?
You suck capitals
I love Ovi, I'm so thrilled he got the cup
Ovi deserved it??
I hope Ovi realizes he’s not in Russia and can get that tooth fixed
I just think Marc-Andre Fleury is too good right now
Hey Karl Alzner... must suck for you! Ohhh wait.. If you were still playing for the caps.. They probably would've lost the series. Congrats caps.. well deserved!
Sbisa! Ahhahahaa!
Finally! This means so much to the long-suffering fans of DC teams!
Well deserved. Congrats 2 Ovi and WSH!
In a caps fan myself. And im.so happy they finally won! But people seem to forget about backstrom. Without him this wouldve never happened.
WOO NO MORE ANNOYING PENS OR FLYERS FANS SAYING WE DON’T HAVE A CUP
Watching the final minute and they keep panning to Ovi. You can see how much he needs it. Any when he finally lifts the Cup, you can see the years of heartbreak and disappointment fall off of him and he's in a state of pure joy, elation.
Congrats to Ovi and Caps from Habs fan.
I sleeped first 9minutes of match lol
Let’s Go Caps!
im a vegas fan, but im still happy for OVI
FINALLY Alex wins one!! Congratulations Washington! !
Sasha and Zhenya,deserve this cup
I was on knights side but seeing ovi with the cup changed my mind. GG
Honestly I can't be happier for Ovi. Well deserved and long overdue
Wow fleury you did so good all season then showed us why Pittsburgh didn’t protect you
I've been following the CAPITALS ?? since I was a little girl back in Maryland at Landover Stadium when it still stood (I'm 46 btw). All I have to say is, CONGRATULATIONS!!!! IT'S ABOUT DANG TIME!!!! GO CAPS!!!! ??????
Ovechkin for president :)
The crowd is not moving.... lmao
Grats Ovechkin.... all time great who deserves a Cup... now everyone see,,again ,, that winning a Cup is not easy... Capitals won many Presidents Cups without a championship... again...congrats CAPITALS... Vegas run ou of gas from playing hard since game 1 of the NHL season. Period.
So happy for them they finally did it and the best part ks almost no one on that rosterever had a cup
Not gonna lie I cracked up when ovi lifted the cup
suck on that vegas. Glad u lost
Congrats Ovi!!
YESSSSS
????? - ????????!) Russia is so proud of Alex, he’s the treasure
WHAT IN THE PETER BONDRA DID I JUST WITNESS???
Congrats to the caps. They deserved it. Outplayed the knights on every level. What an awesome ride it was with the knights though. I’m a bit of ashamed of our “fans” though. Obviously thousands resold their tickets.
Congrats to Oshie, Ovechkin, and the Capitals! Holtby stood on his head, great goaltending. Vegas, you boys have nothing to hang your heads about, what an amazing season you guys had, many many great years ahead
As a neutral viewer It would have been too hype to see vegas win but I guess the Caps deserve it

#3PEAT #3ELIEVE where my penguins fans at lmao.
From one of the seventeen Canes fans, congrats to Washington for keeping the Cup in the East AND beating an expansion team with the dumbest name and logo in recent years. Thank you, Caps... Thank you.
Doesn't really count as a true Cup win. Vegas was a scrub team with a superb goalie that carried them all year. Vegas basically was only there because they got a 3 time Cup winning goalie on loan from Pittsburgh ????????????
I am a penguins fan
Vegas or Pittsburgh should have won
Love seeing the emotion from ovi, once he’s being presented the cup looks like he’s about to burst out tears of joy and I couldn’t be happier for him
Congrats Caps curse broken. Congrats ???????? ? ?????????
lol those rewtard cut off the most important part wich is the great ovechkin's celabratin at the end who is priceless f0cking m0r9ns lol
#VegasWeak
Y es
Vegas was a fluke all year! F em!
Ovi and Backs you deserve it !!! Thank you for your faithfulness !!! Only capitals, only - victory !!!
I knew once the CAPS scored Vegas would go back to their normal "hack & whack" style of hockey. The better team won the CUP. Congrats to the CAPS!!!!
Congratz OVI OVI OVI Graz!!!!
The strippers are going to kill it tonight!!!! Stanley's getting a lapper with Ovi
Finallyy washington won!!! Amazing now they go to president white house!!! Trump will see u now!!
Thank you Russia, not for helping Trump but for Ovi
5:01 best moment
????????? ???????. ?????? ? ?????? ???? ???????? ??? ?????? ???, ????? ?????.
The bubble finally burst for the Knights. They won't be back for awhile...maybe 20 yrs like the Caps. See ya in 2038.
???!! ? ??????? ????!!!
one thing off Ovi's list. keep it going!!
????? ???????))) ????? ? ????????? ??????
Great to see Ovechkin finally get one!
Ovi,congratulations! ???! ????? ?? ???? ???!
yeahhhhh!!!! ????
Lol refs tried everything to help Vegas to win lol Ovi Ovi Ovi
???? ??????!!!
Ovi LEGEND
Congrats for them for making it to the Holy Grail
Man I'm so happy for Ovi and Backstrom.. to see them lift the cup together after all these years was pretty damn awesome.
Where are all the bandwagon knights fan now that they lost no one is commenting about them.
I'm so happy for the Caps. Congrats guys
Omg.. im in tears... finally ovi won
That Vegas penalty kill was painful to watch all series. Why they didn't make any changes blows my mind... So many goals given up shorthanded
Dude when ov held that cup i actually cried
"They're gonna get kicked out by the bolts anyway they said" "oh there gonna lose to vegas they said"
Noooooo why Vegas whyyyyy
I don't like the caps but seeing how much it meant to ovi you can tell how hard they worked for it congrats caps fans you definitely deserve this
Congrats to Trotz. One of the league's most dedicated coaches. Glad to see him finally get the greatest trophy in all of sports.
??????? ? ??????? ??? ??? & ??!!! ???????!!!
Trade sbiza plz
Washington Capitals rule the world.Great Win.Enjoy the Stanley Cup.
It was not easy -- in this city even the clock is loaded.
so deserved :-)
Ovi great now officially.
Vegas nu cto vi takie Luzeri....(
???????!!!
CAPS!!!!!
??? ??????? ????????? ???? ????? ?????? ?????!!! ?????!!!!... ??? ??? ???????!!!!
Well deserved
In D.C. for every game. Too litttttt!!!
Upload at 60fos you losers
Finally
As a vegas fan ithe still give credit to both capitals and knights. But I feel like the knights will try again next season and could have a rematch with the caps
???????!!))
Serves Vegas right for their shooting hoax.
What about Kuznetsov? The best play-off score as you can see.
ty sbisa for letting the caps get the final 2 goals. Bum.
??? ?? ???? ?? ?? ????????? ?? ?????, ??? ?? ??? ?????? ?????
Fleury sucks ass.
I’ve been a Washington fan all my life. At 18 years old currently. Going through the early 2000s redskins being a laughing stock of the nfl. Wizards getting beaten down in the playoffs. Nationals not being able to compete post season. The capitals finally powered through a rough playoff stand these past few years. I’m still in tears ??. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally Mr. Infinity's name (Ovi) is etched for all eternity.
Gz to Washington. Rip Vegas . Gr8 first season! :-(
finally my '98 capslogo will now never go in vain ??
Thanks a lot Washington Capitals if Vegas golden knights who won the Stanley Cup who knows maybe the Vegas golden knights will get the cup next year
As a wings fan happy for Ovechkin finally getting his cup well done ????
Knights! ??????
?????! ??? ?? ?????? ?? ???????!
Glad they won, that Perron goal was bs
Jesus the Knights choke every year smh
?? ???? ? ?? ?????!
ThE REfS WoN tHe GaME
Skip the celly wow
Booooo
Congrats Alex! Go Capitals!!!
Man I'm so disappointed in the knights,they're better then this,but man to many mistakes on defense, congrats capitals.
Not sure how the refs just let anything go such as crosschecks and trips, but I do agree with the other comments that the caps outplayed the knights. I mean its very easy to outplay a team when you’re slashing and tripping and crosschecking players and getting away with it...but as a pens fan im glad to see Ovi and Kuzy get a cup, they are the only ones who deserved it. Everyone else on the caps is dirty and cheapshot any chance they get...
whasington wins????
Congrats to the Caps...from a fan of neither side.... Clearly the better team.
I took a pill 'cause Sbisa ?? - Vegas fans
Holtby pulled a 2017 fleury and carried tf outta his team. Everyone happy for ovi, but holtby deserves it more. He was like a brick wall. Congrats, I'm still slightly salty about r2, but Crosby and guentzel can't carry forever, so kinda deserved that loss tbh
Devante Malik Smith-Pelly Amazing GOAL!!!
VGK goal #2 NO GOAL!! Quit Cheating for Vegas NHL and Refs!
Shoutout to my mans Kuzy and Oshie, two fvcking ballers. Oshie a real one for taking the metro, and knocking that dudes tooth out game 4!?????? Let’s go Caps!??
Congrats to both the Capitals and the Knights! Both teams fought like hell and both will be remembered as legends for this. Caps and Ovi for winning their first cup. Knights for dominating the season and making it to the finals in their inaugural season and becoming true underdogs. What amazing achievements for both teams
????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ??????????
Yeesss!! Finally, Ovechkin has the Cup!!! Congratulations, Alexander!! All the best and more victories.
?????? ???! ? ??????? ?????? ?????? WASHINGTON CHAMPIONS 2017-2018
????????! ???? ?? ???? ??????????, ?? ????? ? ????? ??? ????!
Congrats Caps. You guys earned it :D
Ovi deserve that so much!
The Redskins better learn from this and win a super bowl now. GO CAPS!!!!!!!!
Luca Sbisa the GOAT
NHL MOST PRESTIGE TROPHY HAS FINALLY COME DOWN TO OVI. ON A SIDE NOTE, KIM HUGHSON STILL HAS THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE??
Neal looks like woody from toy story tried molly for the first time and got a hold of the red hair dye at the grocery store and perron looks like if billy zane gave himself plastic surgery but is covering it up with guyliner.
??? ? ???? ????? ???????, ??? ??????! ????? ??? ?? ?????????, ????? ??? ?? ???, ?? ???? ? ?? ???????!!!
Haters will be haters LETS GO CAPS
Marchand should get a 2 game suspension for this..
Hey everyone please watch my video ?? “GOD” ??with your support you’ll help my music reach the world. Thanks GOD bless.
Sbisa is so trash ??????
SO HAPPY FOR OVI- THE GREATEST!!!!
These commentators are so trash. How can anyone listen to these guys? So boring to listen to
Congrats
big congratulations to Ovechkin & co. from the Czech rep. (Rangers fan)
? ??????? ?????????,?? ????? ?????????.???? ????? ????? ????
seeing ovi lift up that cup, priceless. hoping that I'd see that with the canucks in my life time
????? ???????? ?? ??? ????? ? ????.? ????? ??? ?? ?????!
ALL CAPS!!!! WE ARE THE CHAMPPION MY FRIEND.... CAPITALS IS BEST HOCKEY TEAM EVER!!!
smith pelly had a lot of clutch goals
Russian interference!!
Caps fan here, great series but I wonder where the other Caps 'fans' are that kept saying "NHL is rigged" when the Caps lost game 1.

I bet there are some Pens fans saying OVI got CROSBY'S Sloppy Seconds
all the caps and Ovi haters can suck it and hopefully they respect us now ! I love this team and these players and ova will go down as one of the greatest players of all time
It was final time for Ovie to win it, well done Caps
PETER BONDRA>ALEXANDER OVECHKIN. LETS NOT FORGET WHAT NUMBER 12 IN D.C BEFORE OVIE
Funny. 2 habs rejects tie and win the game and a team wearing blue, red, and white lift the cup this century... but it isn’t the habs. Congrats ovi and your team, best cup hoist since chara!
it's about time. caps should have won 3 or 4 already.
USA USA USA!!!!!!
Quick Washington better sign OV to an 8 year extension,he’s still got hockey in him.
CAPS! OVI!!!! Champions!!!! :D
Congratz Caps! Finally the curse have been lifted! And congratz for Vegas making it to the finals! Nobody believed that would happen before it did.
The Vegas player partial block on the gwg is what made fluery not make the save
From an #Avs fan, congrats to the Caps for finally getting the Cup! Happy that Ovi got the monkeys off his back!
I'm just happy that penguins didn't won
???????????? ??? ???? ?????????? -,, ??,, ?? ?????? ??-?????????(. ? ? ????? ??????? ???????-??????? ???? ??????-?????, ??? ?? ??????? ?????. - ?? ??????? ???????.
What was song when ovi lifted the Stanley cup
Good. We don't need some damn expansion team taking home the cup on their first season.
??????? ????. ??????????!!! ??????? ?? ?????!!!
???'? ?? ????!
Sbisa is ass
Rename the golden knights to the silver knights Bc they got 2nd in the playoffs lol. They can rename themselves back to golden when they win a cup
??? ?? ???
Somebody was seriously messing with clock for Vegas to get the tying goal! It was obvious!
This day will be remembered as one of the greatest days in dc history
Gongrcastioltions
Sbisa still got the Canucks spirit within him.
Ovi The Great
Great Capitals,Great OVI.
HOCKEY IN LAS VEGAS; LOL, LOL, ??????????????????????
Congratulations to the #Capitals and #Ovi! More highlights here...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLfxUGyfVm0
Im so happy sbisa left at the expansion draft now
It would been a better final with Nashville sanjose or Winnipeg but bettman golden nights ruined it
?????, ????????? ??????? ????? ????? ? ???!!!! ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?? ???? ??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
I'm a Chicago fan, but the Caps sure did deserve it, congrats!!!
We're getting a parade!
Spoilers in the description... some like to watch the HLs without knowing the result
Stick a fork in Vegas they’re DONE!!!! LOL, Now, what happened to the game clock in the final seconds? I had to LMAO ON THAT ONE. I warned you not to go with the rough stuff. GREAT JOB CAPITALS, VERY WELL DONE!!! You looked like SUPER CHAMPIONS.
???? ????????? ??????? ??? ??????? ??
Who here is excited for Urinating tree to have to do a video on this team winning?
The Caps finally won the Cup? I blame Leo DiCaprio finally winning an Oscar. Ever since that happened the universe has been out of whack :^)
Great job caps! Russians never quit congratulations to Ovi and Kuzy top two scorers in the play offs!
???????????? dang i screamed when vrana scored
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIENDS!!!!!
WE FINALLY DID IT!! #ALLCAPS #STANLEYCUPCHAMPS
????? ?? ?????? ??? ????????...
I was on the Knights side but seeing Ovi hoist the cup made we kinda smile idk GG caps GG
Great game. Congrats Caps fans! So happy for you guys.
urinating tree? Where You at?
Even the goaltender interference goal and shutting off the game clock during the last minute of the game couldn't save the Vegas Golden Bettmans.
Congrats Ovi. Long awaited and well deserved. :)
??, ???, ?? ???????. ??? ???????, ?????? ??????????
???????? ?????????????????????????
Caps Cup Run: Round 1: Barry Trotz elects to start Grubauer over Holtby to start playoffs, go down 2-0, some pundits didn't give the Caps a chance. Holtby starts Game 3, delivers and Caps go on to win 4 straight. Round 2: Playing against Pittsburgh, they won't make it out of the second round again, beat Penguins in 6 games. Round 3: Playing Tampa, go down 3-2 after being up 2-0 and losing both games at home and heading home for Game 6. Holtby and the Caps deliver in Game 6 and 7 and move on. Round 4: Vegas, lost close Game 1, ends up winning the next 4 games. Ovechkin FINALLY gets to the top of the mountain. Congrats Caps from Saskatoon. The turning point of the Caps Cup run: Trotz's decision to start Braden Holtby in Game 3.
Congrats to Ovi and the Caps on a great series and well deserved victory. So great to finally see the great 8 with the Cup.
Yes we did it after years of surfing go Washington capitals
You deserve that one ovy
The raw emotion of sheer passion from Ovechkin when he lifted the cup is priceless. Congrats Caps fans, you guys deserve it.
NBA sucks
Love Washington
What is it with teams winning the Cup on the road in the last couple if years?
Hats off to the Capitals. They had a hell of a game. As a Knights fan, it is pretty sad to see your team lose in the final but we should be proud of our season. Congratulations Ovi it was many years of frustration but you finally did it.
Being a Canuck fan I was able to see a lot of the early Barry Trotz teams when we played Nashville, he is one heck of a coach and i'm glad he got a cup. Ovechkin's hard work finally payed off after all the early playoff exits.. Congrats Capitals' fans.
Unfair game..vegas shouldve won
Year ago people were asking to sell OVi. Contrats to CAPS and Great Job Barry Trotz
I cried what a season!!!! and congrats to #ALLCAPS and OVI!!
Jets fan here, so happy to see Ovechkin lift his first cup!
YASSSSSSSSSSSS
The Caps last 2 goals are exactly why the Canucks got rid of Luca Sbisa.
Congrats to the caps from a CBJ fan
The clock stops working all of a sudden with a minute left, Hmmmm ??????. BETTMAN!!! Anyways GG.
Vegas in 4
Where are all those vegas fan? And where are all those media that they said vegas will win in 6 games.. i bet millions of people lose the bet.. great job Caps.. lol
CAN COCKY VEGAS BANDWAGONERS SHUT UP NOW?
Comeback sweep!
5:17 Me when I win a solo squad in Fortnite
A hodgepodge, scraggly group of misfits make it to the final in the Stanley Cup playoffs .... in their first year. Perfect fodder for Hollywood. Look for them at a theatre near you!
We finally did it! 4 straight to win the Cup! They deserve it more than any other team in hockey! If this is a dream I hope I don't wake up.
Capitals cogratulations with a victory in the Stanley Cup ?? Ovi Great deserved ?? ?? ??
The “Capitals can’t win a championship” memes have plummeted in value. Cut your losses and reinvest elsewhere. Marchand kissing players is still a hot market.
Leafs would have won this game
wish cris cuthbert was calling the game. hughston is horrible. monotone robot.
Finally, CAPS! ?
I’m so happy for OVI and I’m a ranger fan...so much respect for OVI I love him good job
Ovi hoisting the cup very emotional :(
Knights in 4.
Capitals cogratulations with a victory in the Stanley Cup ?? Ovi Great ?? ??
I’m crying now
WASHINGTON CHAMPION ! ! !
Congrats GR8!
They will probably choke next round anyways, who cares
Stanley Cup Finals > NBA Finals
Well I'll be Damned They Fcking Did it Washington Capitals are your 2017 18 Stanley Cup Champions
the memes are dead
Still waiting on that Yankees “wrath.”
thanks for making my team lose 6:33 smh
The jinx is real wow!
Dodgers in 6 over the sox
Brewers were so close to going to the World Series but than Urinating tree had to curse us with that prediction
URINATING TREE ILL FUCKING KILL U, U DESTROYED THE BREWERS CHANCES, DONT PICK US, THATS WHAT GOT US INTO THE POSTSEASON
Well you where right Rockies got swept
regarding your world series prediction... YOU BLEW IT
AAAANNDDDD you jynxed it... Brewskis and Astros lose in CS Sox and Dodgers
Milwaukee and Houston? Instead it's Boston and LA. Oh dear, his jinxing is still real....... Who will be the unlucky pick in his hater's guide? (Or maybe he'll be right like last year again lol)
Dammit Tree. Not only did you jinx my Astros, but you also jinxed the Brewers, the second team I was rooting for this postseason. Your predicting skills are making a return to form.
Tree jinxed another World Series, eh. GO DODGERS!!!!
dodgers v sox god still hates us but at least i'm a dodger fan
Damnit Tree! You cursed us all to suffer through Red Sox-Dodgers
6:35 Well. Their opponents made it.
milwaukee vs houston. Riiiiiiip.
6:29-6:36 JINX!
CONGRATS TREE, YOUR JINXING HAS CONDEMNED US ALL!
Prediction jinx meter: halfway there... C'mon Brewers....
Conglaturation Houston
6:35 Red Sox are in the World Series.
Good news is both your predictions made it past the LDS. Bad news is both are one game away from being eliminated in the LCS.
So far it seems like you've jinxed the astros and the brewers.
If Houston loses, I'm not blaming you. I saw game 3, thank you very much.
That Red Sox one really aged well my guy
Yup! Houston & Milwaukee
The dodgers will, once again, choke
I can tell you really love f-zero from the music in your vids.
Astros and Brewers are currently in their respective championship series. The prophecy has a chance.
Looks like it's going to be Dodgers and Red Sox in the World Series due to the jinx.
"Luke Voit saved the management's insatiable boner for Greg Bird" It's too much, I'm dying...
Wrong
2:45
The Yankees wrath lost them a game 16-1
Giancarlo Stanton sucks!!! Lol. Prepare for the Yankees wrath huh? ????????
Bye bye Yankees!!
Dodgers vs Red Sox World Series
I thought I clicked on death battle on accident...I had to check twice
This was hilarious. Go Dodgers!
Well, so far both the Astros and the Brewers are still in it (and the Yankees are out), so you might yet be right.
As a red sox fan I have to say that was extremely fair. all hail the Tree!
It’s gonna be dodgers Red Sox
Red Sox vs Dodgers, more ratings that way. Who the hell would want to watch Brewers vs Astros???
And u were right about the Indians and Rockies soooo good job
Well yankees are out so gods dont hate us
You should really watch INDIANS games and it will change your mind so easily
Well, looks like the Yanks went down. So thats that.
I'm an astros fan. Yeah I'm scared. Why did he pick us!?
Let's go Dodgers!!!!
Rip the Rockies man ????
2:17 lmaoooo ??????
Yes... the Yankees... HAHAHA
I think I saw Kyle Seager strike out 10 times in this video.
As a Marlins fan, hearing names like Stanton and Yelich being great for their playoff teams, it hurts. Why Jeter, WHY?
Don't call yourself the "HATERS." So many people would watch you.
this is hillarious
UT is a Steelers fan but deep down he cheers for the Pats ??
The Curse is broken YANKEES LOSE
Start doing college football
If Houston doesn’t make the World Series I’m still blaming it on Ken Giles
Please do a Debriefing for the 20 teams that failed to make the playoffs like you did for the NHL. And rip the mariners apart. Pretty Please.
As a Colorado fan, GODDAMMITTTT!
Cleveland is already out. What a shocker.
Go Astros
WIN IT ALL FOR UECK!! GO BREW CREW!!
This was fucking spot on.
would love to see the milwaukee brewers get their first world series win, they will have to go thru boston, houston is hot but they played cleveland, they and their racist mascot are gone. boston will beat the astros in a great series. brewers beat the dodgers because the dodgers are too inconsistent. boston will probably beat the brewers but i will be rooting for the brewers regardless, and maybe, just maybe if they can get a couple close ones... i'm just glad i don't have to listen to 50,000 red necks playing indian with their little plastic toys.
As much as I love Yelich and Cain, they aren't the sole reason for our success. We have a deep roster and a talented bullpen. Everybody on the team isn't a Bryce Harper or a Barry Bonds but they are good ball players who have all helped the team in some way.
As long as Houston gets eliminated that's all that matters. No Verlander celebration this year...I guarantee it.
Hey, what sport is this? Is this some type of alien football?
So when do you admit that your dumbass was wrong about the Braves?
- Urinating Tree picks Astros vs Brewers in the World Series...which means...it's gonna be Yankees vs Dodgers instead! Go Dodgers!! ;-)
RED SUCKS BIAS HATERS and the BOSTON old media are the most ARROGANT fans on baseball ??. FACTS
It will all come down to brewers and bosron
My home team, Royals and the Orioles have had a rough year. Next year will be better but no playoff run
update the rockies lost in a sweep
5:59 - Well, you got THAT right. The Rockies fell apart and got swept. ??
lmao the Clint Hurdle Invitational
Lol cubs
Forgot to mention the A's
I wish this boi had his own segment on Sports Center rating would go up
So hey the Rockies fell apart and got swept
Urinatingtree well one of the outcomes for the Rockies did happen.... the sweep. But I did not expect a sweep where one of the best hitting cores in the league goes MIA for 3 games straight against a team that was carried by 2 players and made there pitching look like God teir
The Astros one was surprisingly not that harsh, compared to all the others.
I just hope the Lastros lose this year because of their cocky-ass fanbase
I want to see Front Row Amy in the World Series
Dodgers vs Red Sox for world series and the Dodgers win
I can’t stop laughing at his comments in the Rockies.
Geez he went off on the yanks
Indians only make playoffs bc of the A.L Central being horrible they cant beat someone like the yankees red sox astros bc they dont have a good solid team
Dodgers Houston is going to be boring ws. I think I woulda had my whole bracket correct if the damn Cubs didn’t lose the wild card with Hamels, Kendrick, and Lester ??????
I'm picking Dodgers over Astros this year. I picked that last year and was nearly right. Maybe I will be right this time.
4:43 la dodgers
Since the Mets decided to blow let’s go Brewers.
Better than ESPN
The Dodgers are gonna give whoever comes out the AL a slugfest. They are much better than their record.
My prediction for the super bowl is that one of these 8 teams will win
Two words.... Love. it.
Fucking Cleveland
Smoked them in the standings? They were only 8 games above.. Ur acting like they finished 20 games above
The F-Zero GX music makes playoff baseball far more intense
Can’t think of Yankees fan who hates Stanton more than Sanchez. He picked it up and we recognized that but yeah most Yankees fans would take Hitler over Sanchez.
Surprised I haven’t seen “Congrats Cubs!” Yet
Got Damn Nailed the dodgers correctly A world series win is the only acceptable outcome.
Not to mention that, fuck, it's 2018 why are they still called the Indians and why tf is their mascot still Chief Wahoo?
This guys is actually funny.
I prediction Milwaukee Brewers vs Houston Astros for this world series.
Chicago Cubs: How to choke in Cubs Fashion
??
That last clip brought flashbacks...
the Brewer's are coming for that World Series!
Brewers over Red Sox in 7
I'm blessed to be an astros fan of 17 years..... I'm sitting hignmh and might right now..... I'm also about to nut considering UT drop 3 vids in 2 days..... Thats legendary
Rockies just blew a chance to tie Game 2 in the 7th. Looks like your prediction for them is a done deal. Prove me wrong, Rocktober
I love these
You dare disrespect the Bronx? You've finally crossed the line. Unsubbed
That Robert Osuna made me laugh so hard
As a Red Sox fan I have high hopes this year but you know.....October
Nice
Go Cardinals ;-;
Was that even hating on Houston xD
Dude Sportsball week 4 it's friday
We're in week 5 now! You don't even have NFL week 4 uploaded!! Please hurry up.
If any AL team went to the NL the AL team would make it to the WS every time
RIP Cubs, A's, Braves, Rockies, Cleveland. I also have NYY V LAD in the World Series, with LAD choking again
LA Noire is an excellent video game.
Well I'm glad he didn't say red sox and jynx my favorite team
I can't watch this. My heart is still hurting
You're right we have no expectations ???? #ChopOn
I predict the Astros & Dodgers in the World Series for this MLB postseason.
Seattle Mariners LoF when?
Urinating tree when ever you post stuff about the Indians never stop using Chief Wahoo in thumbnails
Good vid. you doing sportsball this week or nah?
Someone subscribe to my channel 1239 studio
1:46 and fuck you, too, good sir. You're not wrong that they're a colossal sack of choking hazards and inconsistent to the point you don't know if Ramirez is going to hit the ball or himself in the back of the head but fuck you anyway. Thank you and have a nice night.
I’m an indians fan, but I gotta say, everything he said is unfortunately facts...
I was so happy when the Astros traded Ken Giles for Roberto Osuna to the Blue Jays. They jettisoned a lot of blank weight by getting rid of that choker. Here's for lots of whistles and movement from Minute Maid Park's train above left field! I'm hoping you didn't jinx my Astros! I'm still aching for this week's episode of "Days of our Steelers" and 2 more legacy of failure videos for the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals/Montreal Expos.
Boy, as. Braves fan, I'm just happy to be here. Imagine when the rest of >our farm comes up to the Show. I'm ready to be back on top for another 2 decades, hopefully they can actually manage to get more than 1 ring this time.
Let’s go Braves!
"The Clint Hurdle Invitational"... brilliant.
I just want the Yankees to beat the Red Sox again. It's been too long
go tribe!!!
World Series is gonna be Indians vs Brewers
I have been waiting for this...
I resent the notion that my Boston Arrogance ever rises. It's Peak Boston 24/7.
Well uh...that...that was certainly an interesting take on the Dodgers.
Still loved game 5 even though we lost
“The Braves somehow managed to get through the ridiculous traffic jam on 285...” ??
Boston sweeps Colorado in the WS just like 07
Been waiting all year for this
So proud of my bravos. #ChopOn
Arizona Cardinals: a legacy of failure
Thx for not ripping the Braves like i thought u would
Your videos on baseball are more entertaining than baseball, congrats on getting me back into a sport I havent cared about in a decade
What do you have against Milwaukee? I struggle through 36 years of pain only made bearable by the Uecker, Just to have you pick them this year for the WS. I guess I have some solace in knowing the Packers won't get the PissTree Curse with McCarthy and His Legend killing coaching abilities. What's that you picked GB for the WC........... God Fucking Damn It.
Houston will win back to back
Where is sportsball week 4
As a Yankees fan: we are all angry at Sanchez he can’t block a ball behind the plate and he can’t fucking hit
Pittsburgh fan talking shit on Cleveland. Who’s surprised lol
I sincerely wonder how this guy can watch literally every game of Baseball, Football and Hockey and still have time to eat or take a shit.
Houston loves destroying and embarrassing the Red Sawx for some reason. If they can get by Cleveland (underrated!) they got the AL. Milwaukee is the best NL team. Dodgers have slipped a bit, but institution matters. I see the Dodgers sneaking by Milwaukee. Rematch of '17 except Houston got waaay better since last year and L.A. dropped a peg. Houston repeats but this time in 5. Houston is too good. Verlander, Cole, Morton, Keuchel, McCullers and now a bullpen with an unhittable Pressly and two closers. And then bat after bat after bat: Altuve, Springer, Correa, Yuli, even little Bregman hitting 30 homeruns now.
Im going to my first playoff game this sunday. Just like the avalanche last season. We know were not going very far in the post season. But my goal is already reached. Go ROCKIES!!!!!!!!
Ryu and Dodgers shutout and blew out the Braves 6-0 to take game 1
How dare you play FSU's war chant for Atlanta? They stole it from the Noles cuz of Prime Time who ya know went to FSU, and their fans act like its their thing.
AAAAAAH GOD DAMMIT OAKLAND
I thought Oakland made the playoffs...
May the Evil Empire reign! Go Yankees!
Yankees vs. Dodgers LET’S GO!
The only thing we’re missing is sports ball.....and another chapter of days of our Steelers...
The A’s and Cubs made the postseason where are they
Hey. How about you don’t pick Milwaukee cause I wanna seem then go far.
I’ll root for the Brew Crew this year.............also.......wish the Expos were still here
Tree you asshole. You have cursed my team. You will now be punished with death (or rewarded. I don't know you)
Where is this week in sportsball nfl week 4?
I'm really mainly into the NFL highlights but the fact that you've been able to put out this much content in so little time to reach many fan bases is absolutely incredible. I'm not even bummed, respect to your hard work man. Keep on doing yo thang
Why did you pick the goddamn Astros?!?
You're in the minority in genuinely hating the Cubs. But if you're wrong about this, I think you ought to make a Haters Guide to the Haters Guide if you fuck this up. It's the only thing we can hope for, since you're a Cubs hater. Now excuse me as I cleanse my mouth of salt after seeing my NL Pennant pick lose the Wild Card game and the Mariners, my actual favorite team, miss the playoffs for the 17th season in a row.
I’m a red Sox fan and I strongly believe the Yankees will smoke us
I dont mind other fans shitting on the Red Sox. Thats normal. Its their own "fans". The Red Sox have so many doubtful fairweather fans. They won 108 games ffs and all the "fans" do is bitch. God its fucking annoying. GO RED SOX!
makes sportsball videos, monkey
You jinxed the two teams I like the most in each league. How dare you.
Fuck you for picking mke. Id be happy to see them in the world series, and you had to ruin it
Go ‘Stros!
Please Tree, don't jinx my brew crew!
Hoping the Indians win since 2016, by the way I have no team I support all
From a brewers fan, why the fuck did you have to pick us?
The fuck is this retard talking about?
Wheres sportsball week 4?
I like your videos. Keep doing what you’re doing
fuck i would like to see The Rockies go on that 07' run....but we already know what was the outcome.....
“The only thing Roberto Osuna is beating is batters with his wicked stuff” LMAO
philidalpha eagles Wins Superbowl Philidalpha Flyers lose first round Philidalpha 76ers lose east semifinals Philidalpha union lose open cup finals, qualify for playoffs Philidalpha phillies miss playoffs one of these teams is not as good as the others....one of these teams does not belong. one of these teams is too mediocre, too inconsistent to for the long haul
These playoffs are gonna be fucking good.
Hey, UrinatingTree! Where's the obligatory "Congrats, Cubs!" video? Tell me you're not viewing the Rockies as a joke!
I can’t tell if he just jinxed us (braves) or not
Dodgers vs Yankees please lol
As an Indians fan, I cry.
"Feel Our Pain" playing during the Yankees overview. I see what you did there =_=
Bro, I had so much hope for my Brewers to make a deep postseason run and you threw it in the trash. ????
Sox vs Rockies Fuck.
That All-Star Baseball music though.
Sox
No why I am a Milwaukee fan
So, going by UT Jinxing logic, the Indians will sweep the entire playoffs because you've trashed them all year and count them out in round one. Realistically, even as a fan, I can tell you this isn't a playoff team. If the Astros don't sweep them, I"ll be shocked. If they go 2-0, only to go 0-3 against the Astros like last year, or even worse, 3-0, then 0-4 against Boston, I'll be disappointed.
WHY YOU CURSING MY TEAM URINATING TREE!!!!!!
WHERE IS SPORTSBALL WEEK 4.
rip oakland
So much Urinating Tree, guess is the golden showers era.
U R I N A T I O N B E G I N S
Finally when Baseball matters
In the Rockies-Brewers series, the winner may be determined by which manager over-manages the best, with the top meddler losing the series for his squad. Counsel has stiff competition in Black, who let Shaw keep pitching during the season and takes out starters when he doesn’t need to. Also, he leaves relievers in for too long. You ask the Rockies, “WTF are you?” I ask myself the same question every year.
Good God mlb is so fcking boring - when the most interesting part of the game is a runner hugging the 3rd baseman
I'm down for Yankees vs Dodgers for the billionth time :D
dammit tree in supposed to be asleep
4:01 You forgot Orlando Arcia dabbing after finishing off the Cubbies
Why would anyone watch baseball?
Where is fickimg football
NOOOOO! DAMNIT TREE YOU JINXED US! R.I.P ASTROS!
My iPad won’t let me watch this in 720p, so I’m not watching this (thanks, ScamPad)
Yelich is the baby bruth of the league rn
Brewers have to much magic rn to blunder
So I am assuming there will be this week in football upload tomorrow??
God dammit Tree, I had Brews and Stros pegged for the WS since before the season started. So much for that dream...
Indians vs braves
No sportsball this week? Aww that blows.
FUCK YOU SPANOS
I'm basically going to root for the National League from afar (no way i'm watching this overall shitshow with hockey season starting.) 3 of the 4 NL teams have former (and freshly traded) Orioles players and seeing someone from our long-suffering organization get a ring will actually be nice.
It would be cool to see the Rockies win.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOU JINXED THE CREW GOD FUCKING DAMNIT
Congratulations Athletics!!!! you let the yankees win 2 wild cards in a row
I say Houston vs Milwaukee too. Thanks for not mentioning the A's btw.
Damn he’s really distancing himself from that Steelers L
the AL is so fucking boring this year. literally the same teams. NL though is very interesting. hopefully it's either the braves or brewers.
Love My Yankees & Indians but I can’t Believe Boston isn’t more hated then us none the less they’ll probably win the World Series sadly
Thanks for picking the Brewers, Tree. May the jinx streak continue. Signed, a Colorado Rockies fan. <_<
I'm from Pittsburgh and I hate every Pittsburgh team, and every since 2005 I've cheered for the astros and its playing off! Also you should make a vid for the Washington wildthings if you know what they are. Local baseball team for a small as league.
Yes! He didn't pick my team to get to world series. Thank goodness because he's never right.
How have like half of all NFL teams had videos but still no Mariners?
HAHAHAHA all star baseball music!!!
Loving the Baseball All-Stars 2003 music!
As long as New York, Boston and LA don’t win I’m good (especially LA since Cali)
Hate on the Indians but fail to mention the horrible amount injuries they have had during the end of the season/postseason the past 2-3 years. When they went to the World Series in 2016, they weren’t even supposed to make the playoffs... also saying that all cleveland has is Jose and Lindor shows your lack of knowledge. The Indians have one of the best starting rotations in all of baseball. 2 Cy young caliber pitchers in Kluber and Bauer. I really try to like you, I really do even if you are from Pittsburgh. Yes the Indians have not WON anything besides the central division, but please tone down your displeasure with the Indians for once Jesus Christ.
I love the Indians banter ?? Yes, we only made it because AL Central decided to suck ass.
Love the ending clip ??
Astros vs Brewers Astros in 6 ???
Where's the NFL Week 4 upload?
I'm an Indians fan. And I agree completely.
You really hate Cleveland man. Kinda sad. Not the teams fault the division is weak. Can’t just say 1 nice thing
Go brewers
Make a mls video please
Why would you pick the Brewers? Thanks for jinxing my hope away... :(
Thanks for not jinxing thr Dodgers ??
"A cool breeze and some leaves rustling about"
Anticipating a Reverse Jinx after what was said about Cleveland...
The Cubs are worthy of a congrats video...
YOU FORGOT THE A'S YOU DICK
Go Go, Astros!
Fuck the Yankees.
Fuck why did you pick the Brewers. Now we are fucked??????
Chop on baby
Tree, I had the same exact Fall Classic prediction. We must be blood brothers or something.
Based on your explanations i'm guessing Clevland is going to win
my bet is astros/red sox vs brewers WS
Acclaim all star baseball theme in the background? That’s some DANK music
Eh no starters just bullpen for the brewers
>cusb
New microphone?
And where is week four nfl
As a Braves fan, I can rest easy knowing that UT has jinxed the other teams.
Well, you picked Houston to win last year and it worked, why stop now?
The ending triggered me
UrinatingTree ignores the bullshit that is the wild card game and waits until its over so he can pretend it doesn't exist
Brewers!
Maybe a couple days late
I miss the Cubs
Corey graves voice YES 1000x YES
Sportsball?
I may eat my words on this, but are you high UT? Brewers vs Astros in the WS? Fucking bold statement.
From a rockies fan, Our offense has taken a nose dive down into the Royal Gorge. If the bats don't wake the fuck up it's going to be all to easy for the Brewers to sweep us.
"Congrats, Cubs!", "Congrats, A's!" are next.
20$ its gonna be cleveland rockies cause of this video
Thank God he didn't mention the Red Sox for it all. Now we have a chance
“Because god hates us all it’s probably going to be Dodgers Vs. Yankees” lul ??
Astros repeat on deck. When we win championships in Houston, we win at least two in a row. Rockets 94 and 95 Oilers in the AFL 60 and 61 And yes I’m counting the Dynamo 06-07 and Comets 97-00 ??
As a Yankees fan I mist say I completely agree, Giancarlo gets shit for no reason. He has performed great in his first year and people call it a terrible trade, I don't even pretend to understand.
no tree the braves r better then they were supposed to be :)
Cleveland vs Milwaukee DONT @ ME
...work on that high jump lad
"whatever will we do...laugh at you if you fall apart? Oh yeah that."
Everyone shut the fuck up about Sportsball! It’s coming! Give tree a break. We had 3 uploads in 2 days. Just be happy that at this time of year, we have all of the major sports being played at one time!
A baseball team’s window is never closed. The game is too sporadic.
Braves vs Yanks
You jinx the Brewers, Astros, Yankees, and my Dodgers... I blame Spanos PUTA SU MADRE SPANOS!
If the World Series is Dodgers vs Yankees it’s the battle for Brooklyn
Where’s the A’s
Fuck the yankees
I watched two full ads for you tree. That is how much I love your shitposting
WHERE I NFL WEEK 4 SPORTSBALL!
Week 4 edition?
YESSSS
"Ginger beard of doom"
Machado and Markakis kicking ass on other teams...SIGH...
Respect for using x to doubt
I demand an Indians legacy of failure if they get swept by the Astros.
World Series: LA vs Cleveland. Wahoos last stand
Thanks for the SeatGeek discount, Tree! Used it for Dodgers/Braves Game 2 tickets!
Thank you for not picking Boston so we have a chance
wtf spoiler warning before that last clip
Where are the Orioles?
Where is this week in sportsball
Yankees vs Brewers is a lock
If you wonder why we've complained about a 100 win team. it's because the Yankees front office marketed this team as the next multi WS dynasty. They promised us a run like the late 90's. Giancarlo was marketed to us as the 2nd coming of Ruth. Ticket prices were marked to reflect all this. As the season progressed what frustrated us most is how we can roll into Houston, Cleveland, and Boston and run the table but then turn around and get swept by Toronto and Baltimore. If you look at the team match ups this year Baltimore's best record was against NY. So yes any one would be thrilled to have 100 wins in a season, but how they got them just made no sense.
Braves vs Astros, Braves win
At 1:01 WAHOO'S LAST STAND.
So many funny quotes. my favorite is "Atlanta, finally able to get out of the traffic jam on I285 and reach the promise land of the postseason"
Most boring sport ever
Yes!! Your outro should be you saying f u Spanos
My Rays got gypped
I gotta root for the brewers. Not only because I got to visit the stadium this year, but I can identify with them as a mariners fan. Let’s go brew crew, don’t collapse like your city’s budget
UrinatingTree is the Kenny Florian of Sportsball. ??
You know Ken Giles since his trade to the jays has a perfect save record
Atlanta Braves - We're just happy to be here.
So many empty seats, I knew there was a problem.. BUT DAMN
UrinatingTree predicts Houston vs. Milwaukee I say: YAY, MY TEAM ISN'T JINXED!!! RED SOX ALL THE WAY!!!
I love your content but MLB is unwatchably boring. Where's NFL Week 4 edition?
Red Sox for the love of God don't pull a 2004 Yankees on us fans. Edit: Also no 2001 Mariners bullshit.
using the All Star Baseball video game soundtrack...love it
Ehh, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a World Series rematch this year. Personally I'd like RedSox vs Dodgers. I think that'd be a good one. I wanted RedSox/Cubs but the Cubs lost in the Wildcard so ???????. Yankees/Dodgers would be good too but it'll be a nightmare for me since I hate both teams. Also Brewers/Astros would be a fun series. We'll see what happens! Update: My RedSox beat the Astros in five and are going to the World Series! ???? ??.
The difference between the AL and NL is black and white in the DS round. The AL playoff bracket is literally exactly the same except Cleveland is playing Houston as opposed to New York. 1 team grand total from last year's NLDS bracket made the DS.
Please god! No Yankees vs Dodgers series. Please let something incredible happening instead like Cleveland winning.
You forgot he beat the case to
Urinating "Jinx King" Tree dismissing Cleveland the same way he dismissed Atlanta at the beginning of the season... ??
Where the hell is this week in sportsball week 4
Clint Hurdle invitational Oh so wrong, yet oh so funny.
Good lord if it’s the Dodgers vs Yankees I might die from the amount of cancer radiating from both of the fan bases if they play each other.
Just because I think it’d be funny to see in a World Series, I’ll say Boston vs Rockies lol
Rockies, Yankees, Indians, Red Sox, Dodgers, and Braves fans are celebrating that Tree didn't pick them
The A’s made the playoffs. As a bitter Mainer’s fan, you and your jinxing powers have failed me.
Go Brew Crew
Braves and Indians
Fucking kill me if it winds up being Dodgers/Yankees.
I am both Red Socks and Rockies fan together. I am rooting for both of these teams. Good luck to both of you!
Because you have the best predicting skills, it's gonna be Rockies vs Indians. And the Rockies will win. Thanks a lot.
So suddenly the Wild Card game isn't a bunch of bullshit when it sticks it to a Pittsburg division rival? Hmmmm...
Watching this while watching that Rockies Brewers game in the background. TREE TAKES PRIORITY
On an unrelated topic, holy shit thats alot of empty seats.
Never had chills like I did at the game 5. I always thought when people said that the air was electric that they were just trying to be hyperbolic, but damn if that atmosphere wasn't then I don't know what electric is. Thanks for the reminder Tree! Let's Go Stros! :)
I don't care about baseball, I just love hearing UT talk shit. He's hilarious.
Either Dodgers vs Yankees or Dodgers vs Red Sox will be cancerous and kill everyone so instead of virgins being sacrificed for Dodgers let’s sacrifice virgins so this doesn’t happen as a virgin I am willing to make the sacrifice like if you agree
Why are the Yankees called the evil empire we haven’t done much for like a decade
Damnit you jinxed my brewers
As a braves fan, all I have to say is "fuck you" xD. I mean you're probably right, but fuck you anyways lol
Remember, the Yankees and Red Sox got about 15 wins each from the Orioles. Gotta put an asterisk next to their records
I told ya Baltimore wasn't gonna make it
Hope the Braves get it done
"clint hurdle invitational" lmfaooooooooooooo
Go Astros!
RIP A's :(
Thanks for fucking the Brewers asshole
I’d take anyone but the Red Sox this year. Yankees are fine with me for McCutchen. really wanna see Colorado or Milwaukee win it all though
Redsox v dodgers redsox win :(
Congrats Cubs video?
yankees Dodgers Donald Trump nukes Yankee Stadium game 7
As a cubs fan just roast us. We deserve it. We got complacent
Oh god what a boring sport...
rip athletics season
Ik you're busy but please, I need sportsball week 4; I am a biochem major and the only fun I have is watching your videos, pls help
This is the nationals year!!! #NATITUDE
Pekka Rinne will sweep the Astros
Please in god all mighty don't let it be Dodgers vs Yankees.
dodger haters on suicide watch
Dodgers Red Sox. Dodgers will win
Red Sox bullpen will probably be the major cause in losing. "Oh, but the bullpen has the best WAR of any bullpen." God that stat is fucking worthless. Hembree, Kelly, Barnes and everyone else in there have no balls outside of a knuckle baller who's a coin toss with every pitch and Brian Johnson who throws 90mph max. If Rodriguez or Eovaldi (they said they'd be switching them, stupid) can take up some innings then maybe, just maybe....
Dodgers this year?
Fingers crossed for an Astros dynasty!
Fuck you, why would you curse my Brewers? We already have no World Series titles, lay off tree
Thanks for jinxing the Brewers Tree. Now it's all but inevitable that they get destroyed.
Uh oh. I also called Milwaukee vs Houston in the finals. And hours before this video was published in a tweet. Is that good thing or a bad thing?
The Brew Crew have a bullpen now.The Fanbases in Beertown now have something to watch other than the Packers and Badgers.
Fuck Chili Davis...
Stil waiting for the congrats, cubs video
The Empires ready to commence a new 5 year reign. New fans are always welcome and remember you can't be a bandwagon Yankee fan because everyone's already a fan they just won't say it outloud.
So u get an invite to the next nfl combine yet?
The EXACT SAME teams have reached the ALDS. It's almost entirely new blood in the NLDS with some of those teams having not been in the NLDS in a while. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if an AL team won again this year. Just look at the gap between the Brewers and Red Sox. But it depends on which version of each team shows up. On a tangent, with the NLDS beginning today, the ATL/LA series will either be the Dodgers crushing the Braves to win the series, or the Braves win the series 3-? and all their wins are by 1 run.
It will be Boston vs Los Angeles.
Where’s our congrats Cubs and As?
I want the dodgers to win only because Chase Utley is in the team, Go Phillies!
Red Sox gonna win it all unless they pull a Bruins and just shoot themselves in the foot. From an Orioles fan, I rather have neither Yankees nor Soxs in the conversation. I can feel some sense of gratitude after suffering through 115 losses.
This is better than watching tree run and dang watching tree run is fun
Tree: There is a solution to my relentless dismissal of your team... win Was I the only one expecting a SeatGeek plug here?
Fuck I-285
Be a Braves fan Have zero expectations coming into the season Be surprised/happy the team WON THE DIVISION LOL WHAT Gets matched against the Dodgers in the first round of the playoffs Probably lose 4-0 on some dumb ass "infield fly" rule I DIDNT HAVE EXPECTATIONS SO THIS IS ALREADY A WIN FOR ME GO BRAVES OOOOOOOooooooOOOOOOOoooooooooohhhhhhhhh oooooooOOOOOOOOOOoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHH chops himself to death Fin.
I want Brewers v Indians since neither team has won it recently but also so we can hear about World Series Ratings being so low without big market teams. Yet a Former NL team against a Former AL does sound pretty sexy.
If the Brewers don't win the World Series, they are a Legacy of Failure.
WHERE'S THIS WEEK IN SPORTSBALL?!?! WEEK 5 IS ABOUT TO START!!!
Been looking forward to this video since last years
please don't forget about nfl week 4
UT you Been playing f zero gx?
I would pay to see you do a haters guide to college football
Yanks are going to beat Sox’s in 5
Tree back on the baseball diamond is always fun to listen to. I’ll take Red Sox vs. Braves in the World Series personally. I don’t hope this, but I think it’ll happen as Boston is granted yet another champion as they throttle Atlanta. Go Tribe!!
Go stros!
I’ll jump off of my school bridge if the World Series is Dodgers vs Yankees
Go away Houston!
Haters guide to nba season?
The yankees and Red Sox are basically the patriots and stealers of the MLB
Thanks Tree. You jinxed the only two teams worth rooting for this post season.
make next video on sportsball
WHY DID YOU CURSE MY TEAM WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Why does he always pick my teams astros and saints it never works
Stahp UT STAHP! 3 vids in 3 days!! I can't handle all this W I N N I N G
My pick for the World Series ROX vs SOX: The Revengening
Week 4 highlights... It will be heaven if there were 4 uploads in 2 days
Dead after saying god hates us and will be Dodgers vs Yankees ???? that would be the worst
Rip my rangers
Boi what do you mean Stanton did good this year
Do Yankees fans really still hate Stanton?
I'd love for Indians vs Braves but it's going to be either Astros Dodgers or Red Sox Dodgers
CUBS TAKE THE L YESSSSSSS
I hope Houston losses
I just think that the Rockies pitching is too good right now
This is a bad sign.. three videos in three days. Tree may have succumb to some terminal illness.
Stanton is not hated at all anymore by yankees fans if anything hes been a fan favorite
The New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers are just TOO GOOD right now.
Should have just said Dodgers vs Yankees as you predictions
I’ll be impressed when I get this week in sportsball
“The Clint Hurdle Invitational” ??
He has cursed us whyyyyy I thought it was our year
Are you trying to avoid Nfl Sportsball bro cause I basically only watch football seriously
C'MON MAN, I JUST WANT WEEK 4 SPORTSBALL. YOU'RE GIVING ME SPORTS BLUEBALLS OVER HERE
Best case scenario: Braves vs. Indians. The Tomahawk Chop vs. The Last Ride of Chief Wahoo. Much like in 1995 The Braves come out on top
When is sports ball nfl week 4 coming out?
Chicago cubs oofed themselves into infinity
FINALLY doing some baseball again!!! With so much going down to the wire in the regular season it seems like there was plenty of fodder for you long before this though.
Yesterday just wasn't a good day for Bay Area sports. The Sharks losing opening day to the Ducks 5 to 2 which I was at that game and earlier the A's getting destroyed by the Yankees in the wild-card game 7 to 2. I guess I could at least say that the Raiders finally got their first win earlier on Sunday. But it was against the lowly Browns so......
Do you feel the Pain..Yay... Kill me.. . Good luck guys, your gonna need it...
I'm so excited about the MLB Postseason! Among MLB, NBA, and the NFL, IMO, it's the best postseason. I'm definitely rooting for the Yankees, but Houston is probably the AL's most complete team. I have no idea who's going to win the NL.
nah dood dodgers gonna take it all
Hes gonna go off on Atlanta ??
Why does he hate Cleveland so much?
Don't pick the 'Stros... Don't pick the 'Stros... Don't pick the 'Stros...... ...FUCK
Braves are winning the world series
Watch it be the Brewers and Dodgers in the National League Championship series
Ooooooooooo mah Astros are crused :D
Goddamn Tree stop teasing me with Fire Field music and just make an F-Zero GX video already
I'm hoping for brewers and astros too
Thanks for jinxing the Brewers (hopefully)
Where's Days of Our Steelers so I can get a laugh at them? Ravens fan here
Do you feel the Pain..Yay... Kill me.. .
No, no, no... there is only one season right now, the NFL.
Either the Dodgers use the Capitals as a role model to quit choking or they lose in 5 to Atlanta or 7 to Milwaukee. I don't see them making the World Series and losing again or else Los Angeles is just going to cry tears of the smog that fills their atmosphere.
Noooooo. Why couldn’t you jinx the dodgers and the Red Sox
Red Sox lose to the Yankees in four. Book it.
So, if blue is the main color for the Dodgers, why are their seats yellow?
Fuck, I was feeling confident about the Brewers too
Can we please name the play in game the Clint Hurdle Invitational. Low key best part of this video
You had Cleveland and Arizona last year. About that...
Where is Sportsball week 5?
ORANGE CRUSH!!!!!! Let's go 'Stros!!!!!!!
Seriously, though. What is 38HR if you strike out 221 times?
Lol Cleveland is gonna choke again ready for another heartbreak
I'm quite happy with the 3 uploads in 2 days. I'm guessing with the hockey season and the baseball playoffs starting at the same time, he was in the giving mood.
Just glad that the Cubs aren't here. Play ball.
If it’s Yankees vs Dodgers then the league is rigged
I think Cleveland will make it to the finals but I'm probably wrong??
Been waiting for this, good work Tree! Keep this up!
Lol funny you awesome
My poor Cubs... What a bunch of idiots...
Lets go brewers
Tree has been one busy boi this week.
I hope he showed the shitty yankee's fan pouring beer on an Athletics fan at the yankees game.
It’s been a great season brewers but tree picked you to win the nl you’re fucked
There’s 10 teams in the baseball playoffs not 8...
Indians: Legacy of failure coming soon??
BTW Micheal Brantley and Yan Gomes are both all stars. Same with Kluber and Bauer
ROCKTOBER
DAYS OF OUR STEELERS???
I'm glad people still think your picks are poison. It's not as if you've ever made correct picks or anything. Will definitely be a fun series if you nailed it.
At least he'll have a breather in November. His NBA Haters Guide is pretty much "If you're not the Warriors, you're fucked."
Sounds dumb but Sox and brewers. Sox in 5.
Rip Tampa bay rays
Where is Week 4 NFL Sportsball? But this is cool!
I picked Astros and Brewers too
4,400th view 548th like 166th comment
i hate you, my brewers finally make it to the playoffs with expectation and you pull this shit, Im so annoyed Tree
After Cleveland suffers an inevitable defeat in the playoffs, can we expect a Legacy of Failure on the Indians? Their historic futility deserves to be covered.
Let's Go Cleveland!
Next time on days of our steelers
Let’s Go Yankees!
Please do legacy of failure video on mariners, they deserve this kind of video more than any other sport team
Pity you didn't mention the spectacle of this year's most improbable Cinderella team waltzing right into a buzzsaw in the wild card game.
Dodgers v. Yankees would be amazing, just for the simple fact that it’s a stale matchup in the World Series
Welcome to St.Louis! Where both of our major league sport teams lost a wild card position in the last game
Where’s sportsball!!!!!!
You were right about the Astros beating the dodgers.
Shitattle out again.
No sportsball week 4?
WHERE THE F IS SPORTSBALL
STILL waiting for last week's NFL review...
You predicted the Astros would win in 7 last year so I’m not nearly as worried as I should be
Tree? No! You picked my Brewers to finish third at the beginning of the season, and I knew your jinx assured them of an NL Central title. Now you've picked them to go to the World Series? Hopefully you're right this time.
https://deadspin.com/the-haters-guide-to-the-mlb-playoffs-1829512646 dead spin ripped you off bro
Hey guys Guys Hey guys Guys Fuck NFL, we have swingy smashy postseason
Are you going to a Hater's Guide Declassified for MLB like you did for the NHL? As a Phillies fan still crushed by our collapse it's the only thing involving baseball that can give me joy right now
Aw jeez why'd you pick the Brewers? Now they're hosed.
Imo soxs astros. And rockies and dodgers
I’ve had the same prediticion as you for 2 years now... we are all screwed
As a Tigers fan, if Boston does lose sometime, please do a Dave Dombrowski Legacy of Failure.
Yakees fans are pure scum. I'd personally spit your face. Throw shit on me? I'll slit your throat
Come on Rockies
Clint Hurdle invitational ????????
I hope the red Sox lose in the first round so I dont have to listen to the cancerous commentators and I can listen to real talk radio shows i like
U FUCKING JINXED MY ASTROS!!!!!
Lets go indians! just wait till we beat the astros in 5
Thanks for not jinxing my red sox
The Marlins at one point had Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, and Christian Yelich. This team will never ever succeed. Worse than the Cleveland Browns. Baseball's true factory of sadness... Go Yankees
Oh fuck you, Tree. Astros vs. Brewers is the World Series I want, and now because you said it, it will never happen.
Braves vs. Yankees would be interesting
Seattle Mariners: A legacy of failure
UrinatingTree: The World Series will be Milwaukee vs. Houston Me: Better luck next time you two EDIT: UrinatingTree does it again
Dude. This week in sportsball? No? Nothing? Come on man, this could've waited for tomorrow morning. I wanna see what you got to say about my titans taking down the world champs!
Place your Sox yanks predictions here:
Red Sox vs Dodgers World Series.
is patiently waiting for the next episode of Days of Our Steelers
Is it bad that I’m still in shock that the Braves made the playoffs this year? P.S. I have the same World Series predictions as well ?? hope my Braves can prove me wrong tho ??
Sportsball?[?]
My desired matchup: Atlanta vs. Houston My expected matchup: Boston vs. L.A. Dodgers As the Mariners add a 17th tally to their postseason dry spell, I'm going to go sulk in the woeful corner. Don't mind me. I just want to see the M's play October baseball, darn it! >_<
Fuck the Dodgers. Yankees Red Sox are the same team. Braves Indians are racist. Astros already won. Brewers suck. Go Rockies.
I think Houston will lose the ALDS because the Indians can hit their starters very well, but I don't really see them making it past the 2nd round.
I don't care who it is. As long as it's not Colorado or the LA Dodgers.
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? (I'm looking at you Atlanta Braves)
Let's go Braves Chop on to a World Series!!!
I really wish you said dodgers yankees
"Wipe that shit eating grin off your cheesy ass logo's face! You're pathetic!"
Let's go Dodgers!!!!
Astros and Dodgers
When UT blesses us with 3 uploads in 2 days but all people can talk about is sportsball
Did you have to jinx my Astros?! Damn you, Tree!!!
WHERES OUR SPORTSBALL NEWS!? WHERE DAYS OF OUR STEELERS
Drop the nfl vids
If the Indians choke again, you NEED to make "The Cleveland Indians: Professional Baseball's Choking Hazard."
Go Astros
THIS MUSIC!! ALL STAR BASEBALL 2003
What did we do to deserve 4 videos in 2 days, Tree?
??????????
Dodgers Astros again
Fuck he predicted the brewers to get to the world series. Welp, RIP our chances.
We need sportsball!!!
Oh boy I can’t wait to see who urinating tree fucks this time
Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now Pekka Rinne is too good right now
I have a question, I understand the Wild Card game is bullshit but why don't you include the WC teams in your "Haters Guide To The Postseason" but do include them in the "Haters Guide To The World Series"?
S P O R T S B A L L ? ! I NEED IT TO TREAT MY CANCER! lol cubs lost. This heals us White Sox fans once more.
Yanks Braves
When you nut and he says "Fuck you spanos" ????????????????
I can't believe my cubs imploded like this lol. Guess you can say, first collapse of the post curse era lol
The Indians are one of the worst teams to ever be in the postseason. Because of this, there pitching will go scorched Earth and they'll win the world series over the Dodgers.
UrinatingTree is my favorite sports Youtuber even though he shits on my teams. Still love him.
Still waiting for Days of our Steelers.
As a fan of the White Sox, I’d love nothing more than to see Chris Sale win a ring. I hate Boston, but with the best pitcher in the MLB, maybe in MLB history at the hill, it’s hard to argue they won’t rape and pillage this offseason.
Now THREE videos in THREE DAYS!!!?!??! I may have just cried.
NY YANKEES!!!!!
Bruh where’s the new Days of our Steelers episode?
Suicidal Cubs fan reporting in
Yankees are going all the way
All I'm saying is this astros vs brewers world series and good job rockies.
And... Where is Sportsball week 4?
That was a good Osuna joke
Who I want to win: Braves over Indians in the World Series Who will probably win: Red Sox over Brewers
Another video??? My god!!!!
This week in sports ball?
Cam you do a video of the upcoming midterms please?????
:( cardinals suck
And do a lolcow for a Portland trailblazers
Never forget, the Indians blew a 3-1 lead.
Dear Cleveland: either win or lose in four so the Astros have a chance against either the evil Empire for the Sox
Regardless of what happens: power is firmly in the AL's hand. If the NL pennant winner wins the whole thing I will be shocked.
Im juat waiting for another choke by cleveland??
Thank you for ripping the Indians. I needed that today. Turns out Maple Leafs fans are extra cancerous this year.
FUCK SPANOS
Now for a Haters guide to the Nba- Oh wait that’s right the league is fucked!
When your favorite baseball team is not one of these teams :(
wait until next year when the cubs get harper and (hopefully) darvish does something
Ahahahahahaha. You thought the A’s could successfully overthrow the MLB overlords? You make me laugh. Long live the evil empire
2 runs in 22 innings for the Cubs in the division tiebreaker and the Wildcard game. What a dynasty they have!
GO ROCKIES!!!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!!
Thank God. Finally I can stop waking up to texts telling me how much traffic it is due to a fucking Orioles game. As if anyone even goes there WHAT TRAFFIC!?
I see tree, i come. Life is tree, tree is life.
Yankees Red Sox get in the bunker until someone wins 3 games in the series the two fanbases are gonna spew cancer all over the internet
Week 4 of sportsball I'm waiting
3 uploads in 2 days. So this is what heaven looks like
Where is nfl sportaball
This year is yankee year.
My prediction that I’ll probably jinx Yanks and Rocks
Here comes 19 people saying “first” like a bunch of morons
Angry Nats fan reporting in
The Yankeeeeeeesssss win
Tree just pumping out videos.
What happened in Dallas, UT?!? ??????
Where's NFL Sportsball highlights week 4 tho
Sox winning the pennant don’t @ me
Yankees let’s get it
the NBA Season is upon us brothers.
First
Yeet yeet
Yesss!
Go dodgers
ROCTOBER
NOT SPORTSBALL
rip the A's :(
first comment
Finally
Holy shit back to back uploads
Let’s go Yankees!
I think this episode would have been better (and shorter) if all the grandiosity hadn't been pumped into it. Is it that incredible that a shitty, undermanned team, whose existence is basically a joke, is the losing half of the highest scoring game in NCAA history? Especially in addition to evidence they helped their opponent beat them? No, it would only be surprising if that wasn't the case.
The best part was the discovery of the first recorded dab.
"you can't call the gods on toll free numbers" —Jon Bois, 2017
This is the best video on this website, bar none.
My question: why don't more basketball teams play like this? The losing team put up 141 points.
Pretty good
253 is still a pretty good amount of points.
This video is a work of art
I like to think that SB nation stands for sports ball nation
Those scrambled eggs gave me heartburn and an ulcer from undercooking
Late to the party but I binged this series and it's pretty f***ing good! Can't wait to see more of them!
This is the single greatest video on YouTube
Those chapter sequences are heavenly.
0:37
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND I STILL KEEP WATCHING.
I live in Houston. Weirdly a lot of the Community Colleges here have Sports and i remember Devry being one of them with a basketball Team.
Pilsner Tyrant and Suds Vassal would be a good band names
This feels like someone hitting the kill screen on Pac-man.
8th gen non si civic LX is limited to 150 and ive maxed mine before it doesnt even feel THAT unstable smfh come on leave hondas alone :(
This is incredible baked
I feel like the score board operator had an easy fix to the situation, just reset the score to 0 after they hit 200, sure the score would ready 53, but every who was following the game knows it's just 200+what's on the score board
The script and production on this video is superb. It all flows so easily it’s easy not to appreciate everything that went into it.
ESPN needs his talents. This is better than most 30 for 30s
The historic part is watching the whole video
I used to live in a house a had a wife and a dog I then watched this video...nothings been the same I dont know where to go idk who to trust I know someone's out there they want to get me. I live at st Vincent's shelter I can't say anymore... I've said to much if u want to get in contact with us.. you'll have to follow the clues..
Man i love PRETTY GOOD!
This is pure art; truly the best video I have ever seen on this site.
This video is a masterpiece
Jon bois is the best thing about this channel
The Fury of Achilles is pretty good
DeVry: we're serious about success
Watching that game footage is like watching that grainy, blurry footage of Babe Ruth when he allegedly called his shot.
That beer king is la croix
S E R I O U S A B O U T S U C C E S S
Regular sized brain: Watching this video to learn about an unusual and anomalous basketball game between Troy State and Devry. Big glowing brain: Watching this video to learn Jon Bois's tip to make scrambled eggs at 3:28.
Over edited
I couldn't give two shits about basketball, but this is still one of my favorite videos on YouTube now
Stop harassing my account I would never go to Devry,, leave me alone!
I've probably watched this a dozen times but I always forget about "devry got a basketball ball team" and it kills me each and every time.
If there were more games played like this I'd watch more basketball.
I’ll never forget the first time I watched this video. Legitimate piece of art.
3:20 ...
these videos are hard to watch jesus its some bad editing like the sped up part we got the point after the first 5 sec i had to skip forward and eventually skipped out
Damn! If I was a one and done college player I would play at Devry.
What’s the name of the song at the very beginning of the video? I’ve heard it used in other videos and I think it’s pretty good.
You can score 250 points if the other team wants it to happen as well and lets you do it. Might as well be out there alone shooting layups. That record should not count.
This might be the best sports video ever made...it now joins the likes of Field of Dreams, Rudy, and Michael Jordan: Fly with Me. Seriously, the time and research that goes into something has to be astronomical. Great work!
That has got to be the worst scrambled egg I've ever seen
My question is how could devry be good enough to score 141 point and still go 3-15
Update: Sartain Hall, the building that housed this game, just started getting demolished in order to make room for a new recreational center on campus. It’s sad to see a historic site like that go
What kind of ridiculous shot clock is 45 seconds?
that intro gave me cancer
The clock moves and not the hand
Why do the chapter title cards look like they belong in a Persona game?
The scores on your videos make me wet.
Another point where the scoring could be messed up is the point when they broke 200 and had issues with the board
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty funny about the score on wikipedia but the article also says that there were 117,000 people attended that game, so...
This video is trippy
Arigato!! Just found you guys. Would love to submit a few articles too. Great work guys!!
How have I not seen this before!?! It’s perfect and I can’t stop watching. Nightmarish and hilarious. Thank you. Please stand and smugly high five ? yourself.
12:37 scared the crap out of me
7:35 Louisville
So i went to the wikipedia page for this game to check this again when i was rewatching it, to see if maybe there was more news or something, and in the intro there was no mention of this analysis, as there was the last time i viewed the page. As i was looking at the revision history to see about reverting the page to include the information i previously saw, i at one point pressed the view current version button and someone had edited the page while i was doing the exact same thing to include the mention of Jon Bois and his analysis of the game. It was like i was in mind meld with another guy on wikipedia, and i went to his page, and this was his first edit. just as it would've been mine. it was beautiful
This chino hills (Lonzo,Lamelo,Liangelo) on steroids
Jon, i have watched this video 38 times. I play your videos every night at 11pm to help me feel inspired for the next day via fits of goosebumps and transcendent trips of epic music. Your work has made me obsessed with stats to the point where I’m kept up at night by them. I have one issue with your hypothesis on when the scores were incorrect. The two events where you believe the score may have deterred from reality occur after the announcer gets the score incorrect. It must’ve been something else; a missed point during the transition of board to paper, the commentator keeping his own score. We may never know. That’s even more satisfying.
why didn't the scorekeepers just say 200=0 and keep using their electronics?
This is an absolute masterpiece
the story, the music selection, the quotes, the production, I weep for how beautiful it all is ... I knew how good your videos are but this is must be close to, if not your actual magnum opus
Does anyone else get high and watch these videos?
another interesting game is the highest scoring NBA game.
OK, so, as somebody who knows very little about basketball, why don't NBA teams play this way?
Aaayyyyyy, another Louisvillian!!
Is this Death Grips? 0:00 - 2:18
DeVry, I.T.T. , American Intercontinental, Herzing, etc hell Lincoln Automotive were/are all scams to ripoff the DOE and low income students with the student loan hustle. The qualifications are so low for "schools" and terrible students to qualify for federal financial aid that decades ago non accredited schools started popping up. You can tell how shitty they are by the terrible TV programs that their commercials are targeted at. Look behind the curtain, its the same people who are pushing charter schools, they want to run the same hustle at the pre college level, aka privatization. Remember, you pay taxes that support state colleges that then turn around and make you take loans out to attend, hoping someone hires you when you get out. Its all a hustle.
DO NOT use a eggshell to get a piece of the shell out of a pan of eggs, salmonella results from it developing on the outside shell of the egg, not the inside. Dipping your eggshell into an egg is a good way to expose yourself to it.
253-141
I didn't understand all of it, but I think this video disproves The Magic Bullet Theory, right?
I love the atonal music, it's like Jon is delving into some forgotten crypt of a dormant alien civilisation to bring us whatever treasures or horrors lie within.
How is this video not have 10+ million views
How many teams have ever scored over 141 in a single game? DeVry's score is hardly a record, but viewed on its own (outside of the fact that they got outscored by over 100 points) it would be pretty impressive for a small school.
You're from Louisville? ??
Okay but those eggs werent cooked enough
This is the 5th time I have watched this episode. I am always impressed, always interested, and always left in awe by the effort put into these videos. Incredible.
Excellent ??????
Hey, around the 10:00 mark there is a swelling piece playing during the dunk supercut that doesn't seem to be either Varldens or Zarf. Does anyone know what it was?
Devry got a basketball ball team?
The production value of these videos is simply surreal
Bruh! I love these videos... but you gotta fix those eggs man, that's just not good enough
My man was using quotes from homer because it relates to troy, and he found a quote with "inner court" and "outer court" in it. Amazing.
This channel always on the cutting edge of sports journalism. Fantastic videos always. Never stop
This is the greatest video ever made!!
This is Jon's true magnum opus.
Video starts at 2:27
the first 2:17 seconds made me mad
why does this video have a terrifying undertone
jon, did you wash your hands after you touched all those egg shells
Bravo Jon!
If you go into the edit history on Wikipedia for the game, it says stuff like “I performed the work of God” with the edit being the score change. They deployed an anti vandalism algorithm on the page because the score change edits were so frequent
Like the show, but dear god those have to be the most disgusting-looking eggs I’ve ever seen
Saddam Hussein's Summer Palace in Iraq had a direct view of the ruins of Babylon. Like really, less than 200 feet away. America's favorite Arab boy-toy could wake up in the morning, brush his teeth, drink a cup of coffee, and look out the window to what was once a 3-millennia-old city, which was, for hundreds of years, the most populous, most important, and most powerful place on earth. What Saddam was looking at was a pile of rocks and some clay walls. The most architecturally impressive sight in Babylon presently is an oil pipeline, built in the last 50 years, cutting through an outer wall, completely disregarding all archaeological conservation. As a world leader, I imagine Saddam could only reflect upon his nation's, and indeed all nation's, inevitable downfall and obliteration in the face of time's ultimate ambivalence to order, history, and legacy. I feel like he must've skipped his breakfast a lot. But in this fact, and in this video, we can indeed find solace. By my shitty, non-Jon-Bois calculations, there have been roughly 150,000 regulation NBA games, and the number of college basketball games rounding a full million. Of all of these games, two were picked by Jon Bois specifically for the way they broke the game. These two videos are focused on 0.0001% of all games, yet they will be seen by multiples of thousands more people than have seen at least half of these individual games in person. Always, it is much more interesting to find out what went wrong than what went right. History isn't built on the things that go correctly, but rather things that go horribly. Historians around the world talk of Babylon, even though it is utterly sundered. It is regarded as one of the most important sites in human history. Painters, philosophers, and generally any intellectual has at least once given thought to the city. Certainly less people have thought about Damascus than Babylon, even though Damascus is possibly twice as old, and was never lost to time. As Cato the Elder once said, "After I'm dead, I'd rather have people ask why I have no monument than why I have one."
Why would you take a player out because of foul trouble if you onky had 5 guys. Just brushing past that detail left me deeply perplexed.
I'm gunna try those eggs. They look gross textually, despite the fact that I like over easy. We shall see...
Are those la Croix instead of beers?
god Jon u just have this incredible ability to turn every tiny thing into an epic, pun intended. i didnt realise when i hopped on youtube tonight id be watching a 30 minite video about a bball game from 1992 but here we are. i love ur editing
God Bless those 2 coaches and 18 players. Heroes in our hearts.
This is art comparable to Spielberg or idk the dude who made that movie about the holocaust with the taken dude
The best intro EVER
Those eggs looked awful
So did anyone have a quadruple double???? like damn they got beat by over 100
30 minute video and I'm gripped from start to finish, amazing.
This is entertainment bordering on insanity
22:57 - "pointless, silly juvenile farce". On a similar theme, can you imagine two teams playing for TEN DAYS and no-one wins? Welcome to the surreal world of the "Timeless Test" cricket match between South African and England in 1939: https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/22/the-spin-cricket-the-timeless-test-1939
I think my favorite part is how the play-by-play announcers continue to try to sound impressed by dunks throughout the game.
This IS a video about a lot of time on your hands....
I’m really glad I don’t do heavy drugs after I saw that intro...
I never thought I'd see a youtube video with a table of contents. I also didn't think I would want to watch a 30 minute video about a college basketball game. I was wrong twice
No wonder I couldn't find it. I remember the game with a 100 point difference, 150 or so on the losing side, but I thought it was a high school game.
i should really study for finals
dude I love all your videos I've literally been binge watching your page and sb nation...the hard work you put into all your videos really shows man keep up the great work brother!!!
LOL WIKIPEDIA CHANGED THE SCORE TO 253-141 AND USED YOU AS A REFERENCE!
Checked that Wikipedia page, it actually changed. The score reads 253 now. You've even got a little mention on that page.
"They wanted us to get the record so they share in some of the glory" Uh....
The noise at the beginning is miserable
Everytime that Jon Bois does something on this channel, I feel like I'm tripping ballz within the first minute.
All of these episodes feel like nightmares.
This video is a stunning achievement.
its like watching an NBA all star game now
Actually, those 2 points where they got, "tripped up" were incorrect. There was actually a point where YOU got tripped up and that wasn't your fault, THAT one was the referee's fault. I got 252-140.
Haha the first dab!!
I love how he conveys just how unbelievable these stats are
3:50 those eggs looked FOCKING DISGUSTANG
You should try to do a video on the high school football record blowout of Haven, KS 256, Slyvia, KS 0 from 1927. There is barely any information on that game. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(sports)
This video has a creepy education-like vibe to it, especially with the chapter intermissions. It makes it feel like it's on Public Access TV but it makes the video like, a thousand times better to me for some reason.
I thought I had seen all of the Pretty Good (& Dorktown & ChartParty) episodes -- but, somehow, I missed this one. It's only Thursday, but damn if it doesn't feel like 5 PM on a Friday right about now.
The intro to this video was unbearable
These are just so good.
someone change the Wikipedia page now!
4:33 I Live in tinley park
The "Pretty Good" series is some of the best content I've ever seen on YouTube. Incredible production value, awesome narration, superb research/sharing of information, and great choice of music. All of these videos never fail to give me a sense of elation. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon these videos. And I am eternally grateful for Jon Bois. Thank you, sir.
WTF is that intro tho
258+141=399 ??but can you do this
Bruh the beer is La Croix
this score reminds me all too painfully of the first fat chick i ever slogged...however she outweighed me by far more im sure
Normally id laugh my ass off if someone thought id watch a 32 min video of theirs, but your videos are so well f'#*in done I can comfortably say I wish they were longer, and more of them
you should do one about the 5th down play
were serious about success
Devry got a basketball ball team
you don't have to say "an" before "historic" anymore, we do aspirate that h
Greatest. Video. Ever.
Those eggs are runny af
This is the best video on the internet
Wow. I scored it myself after this and I got 252-140.
I'm loving this series. Especially since ??? (KOO DAE-SUNG) got some respect through you guys. That aside, can you consider doing DANNY HEATER? The high schooler who supposed scored 135~139 (exact points is disputed) in single game?
m o a r p l s
those were the runniest, nastiest looking eggs ive EVER had the displeasure of seeing, in my life!! congrats! ;)
big man at :55 was HUSTLING back on D! HA!
Anyone know that lovely piece playing at 10:08?
That was really interesting
I regret showing my friends Jon Bois videos because I end up binge watching all his statistical masterpieces
This is not the greatest game in the world. This is just a tribute.
The intro seems demonic
Really annoying devry intro
I love the suspense effect with most of his videos
8:02 "Do we know how to count here?" Nope, not according to the dumbest boy alive video
This video is somewhere in between The Godfather and the Sistine Chapel as the most amazing artistic representation of life I've ever seen in my life. I'm truly moved.
Fantastic
Jon has the Devry score wrong. Don't believe me? Watch the Kip Smither's film and score yourself.
The music in this ranges from soothing to nightmare fuel I love it
That intro was a bit long eh?
We are serious about success
This is the best video on YouTube
Turns out wikipedia actually uses the score from this video, rather than the previously established 258-141. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men%27s_basketball_game
Those eggs would be better if you start with a cold pan, cold butter, and grate a good hunk parmigiano reggiano in there with a microplane. That's the Jean-George Vongreichtenchten way, takes, maybe an extra minute. If the eggs start to stick lift the pan off the burner for a bit.
It has almost been a year and the wiki page for this game is still a warzone between those who want the truth, and those that defend old scores.
All the good people on the internet are named Jon.
In all seriousness, what's up with the creep factor in Bois' videos?
Amazing that even with Troy scoring 253 points, Devry was still able to score 141.
I love the Pretty Good series, but jesus christ that was the most annoying and drawn out intro montage ever. I know this video is a year old, but I hope you have not and never will do an intro like that again.
unimaginably good
Very good video presentation!
This film is a testament to greatness in our generation. This video was a Pretty Good way to start my day.
if they were really serious about success they wouldn’t have lost by so much huh
That intro is just a little too long and a little too obnoxious, I always have to skip it after a while.
I just binged everything you’ve made in a day. All your different series on SB. Incredible. You are going to make some truly amazing content in your career. This stuff is amazing. The bar has been raised.
How many DeVry players went on to play for the Washington Generals?
I have been binging on Jon Bois and SB Nation videos for several hours now and I am so glad I found these channels (subbed to both now btw). I'm not even a fan of baseball/NFL nor a huge follower of basketball but the research and creativity in each of these videos puts this up there with the best of Youtube - but this video in particular is a masterpiece. It's so good I'm interrupting my binge to make this comment. The inter-disciplinary nature of moving from history to stats to art to literature to film and all points in between is staggering and above it all its explained in such a way that not only is it highly entertaining and informative but almost affirming - it feels like this was so much bigger than a basketball game, it feels like this was an event that should be held up high in the annals of human history as something to which we all should aspire to in our respective walks of life. Which I appreciate so much as a common theme in all the 'Pretty Good' series of videos - it isn't just a simple appraisal and shoutout to intriguing events but also a closer inspection of everything that makes it so great and so vitally relatable to every kind of person. This is sports transcended and I never thought that number crunching would bring me to this point of reflection. Statistics and Metaphysics - you have done something wondrous Jon Bois. If it were possible, I wish this video were eligible for an Emmy or an Oscar - both as a recognition of the amazing work it is and also so that more people can watch this and gain that inspiration - to know that sport teaches you everything you need to know to live your life the right way, that content and message can go hand in hand and be absolutely kick-ass and supremely touching simultaneously. This is beyond 'Pretty Good'. This belongs on the Olympus of Online Content - "some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.” (The Iliad, Book XXII)
Dartez Daniel (Devry) scored the most points at 42 (only 6 points came from 3 point shots), and he only played 25 minutes. Clayton Jones (Devry) gave the ball away 19 times (2 turnovers per minute) with the most minutes played at 40 (he never left the game once). Devry gave the ball away 44 times. Brian Simpson (Troy State) only played 15 minutes and he scored 37 points (2.5 points per minute). Devry shot zero free throws, and Troy State only committed one foul.
I swear to god I’m just rewatching pretty good
That's weird. I got 252-141.
On March 13, 2017, SB Nation's Jon Bois published a video in which he argued that the correct final score of the game was Troy State 253, DeVry 141. Relying on a recording of the game posted to YouTube, Bois counted all made baskets and arrived at 253 points for Troy State. He identified two potential scorer's errors: a Troy State dunk that went in after the horn had errantly blown that resulted in a return of the ball to Troy State, and an attempted three-point basket that ended with the ball lodged between the backboard and rim.[2] YOU DID IT JON! THIS IS FROM WIKIPEDIA! WE DID IT! YES
The 104 dislikes are DeVry grads
idk why but these always make me feel like there's gonna be a jumpscare
this video is honestly terrifying
The beginning got me tripping balls
Fun fact: the highest scoring player in that game (with the false score) was Dartez Daniel, for DeVry, and he only scored 42 points, and there was only one fouls committed by Troy State, and there were only 3 total free throws made, out of 3 attempted
No doubts, one of the best videos on YouTube
Devry got a basketball ball team WTFFFFF?
The best series on youtube, by far!!
Can confirm - those were perfect eggs Jon, thanks man.
What is the song used for that 80's synth thing
tf is this video
When editing did you decide ear rape was a viable source of audio?
Can Someone Tell me Whats going on in the comment section? I was just searching for the First dab and found this Video :s
The Wikipedia revision history on this game is insane. Wikipedia editors have reversed Jon's edited score of 253 for Troy an outstanding 36 times now as of today, February 17.
Could you imagine refereeing this game? I'm exhausted just thinking about it
I've really got to start replying in one just sentence to suit today's DeVry vs. Troy St./ADHD society....
Roses are red I hate when people scream DeVry got a basketball ball team
Did DeVry practice 3 days or 4 days a week? Or......3.5?
You guys sure know how to present charts and data
Put cheese in your scrambled eggs
I made scrambled eggs based off his tip and they are PRETTY GOOD
If he did this weekly SB Nation would be the biggest youtube channel
I have no clue why, but I cried watching this video.
Epic
Double checked Kip Smithers film and when Troy gets it to 200, Devry definitely has 107. I also noticed not long after the Troy 3 to get it to 200, the scorer somehow gives Troy 3 extra points and Devry keeps being reported as having 3 less than it should have. I can see that mistake pretty clearly, and understand why as the scorer was struggling to show the Troy score in some way. Later, but I'm not sure when, the same thing happens with a 2 pointer, because they start saying the score 5 points off for both teams (5 too many for Troy, 5 less for Devry). Then, very late in the game they say that Devry has 137 (Which was on track for 5 too many for Troy, 5 less for Devry). Not long after Devry hits the three as time expires and the game ends, but for some reason the scorer has them at 141. My final score is 253-145. I am a genius :)
this seemed less like a game, and more of a ball relay-throwing race
This Video is pure art.
Jon Bois, the videos are beyond great. I watched the Kip Smither's film and do not agree with you that the score was 200-105. I have 200-107. There is a timeout at the 53:30 mark and the announcers say (At the 54:17 mark) that Devry has 107, which I agree with. After the timeout, Troy state goes on a run with no Devry scoring and gets that three to get to 200, thus 200-107. Do you think Devry had only 105 at this point in the game? Also, the Devry possession at the 57:40 mark, you can't see the play! Did you score this as a 2 for Devry or not? It looks like a 2 for Devry to me.
What is "In the shop for repairs"? Is there another episode of PRETTY GOOD that was taken down? Or is that just a troll to make people think there was another episode?
Retarded edition, seems like it wants to make it something deep. Pretty Dumb
I remember going to DeVry for a week. They graded on a curve. You basically were paying for a degree. Nothing about that place was legit
wtf is up with the 2 min intro! wow thats long
This is an amazing work! Please always keep this up and keep on doing this type of work! It is GREAT!
Those were the worst scrambled eggs i’ve ever seen
Those eggs were awesome
Those eggs bro did not look fully cooked lol
L
That is the grossest scrambled eggs i have ever seen.
Jon, you captured it! A MASTERPIECE in insane, unbridaled, furious fun. The players hugging at the end, the ominous retro DeVry commercial announcer rambling on and on gives this a historic touch to an otherwise silly yet phenomenal night. It was more than just another game. It was a test of human limits... and that screwy scoreboard's too.
the ending is epic
too serious about success
3:30 Y u teaching us how to make scrambled eggs?
Dude how much weed do you smoke?
He sounds like Chip Kelly.
This is really autistic. Good work.
WE CAN TELL THAT'S JUST LA CROIX YOU FRAUD
great video. terrible eggs.
Your scrambled eggs look like rice pudding 3:57
so btw ummm Does H&R Block sell hamburgers or naw???
I live in Troy and go to Troy and I didn't know this.
Why the 2 1/2 minute ear rape in the beginning?
you give your hot sauce nice job makeing your dog sick
wait what were those scrambled eggs why were they not cooked what did you do did you actually eat that
Jon all your videos are perfect.
Dude those scrambled eggs looked gross.... if you want fluffy scrambled eggs you don’t stir them so much
Who was the leading scorer for Troy ?
This is far and away the best video I have ever watched on YouTube
Somehow there was only one triple double (according to the box score anyway). And only 2 players (one from each team) broke 40 points.
You can’t call the Gods on toll-free numbers
Can confirm, keep stirring eggs on low heat = best result. So creamy and wonderful! .. Also great video as always Jon!
Jon this is fantastic, the Illiad tie ins are incredible.
The intro montage thing is the most annoying and obnoxious thing I've ever seen on YouTube. Great content otherwise. :\
It's not rare. It's the NBA All Star game.
Why did you make the clock turn instead of the second hand turn
DeVry got a basketball ball team
This is honestly amazing to the level of creepy
My dad went to the high school that Jon went to and I live in Louisville, where he’s from
That is a horrible scramble eggs. Looks like my cats puke. And please equalize your sound.
It occurs to me, watching this, that the Trojans are not the only classical Greek figures one could invoke. It was said that the men who fought against the Persian forces at Marathon had a saying they would use to refer to their service at that plain. Famous for having sprinted across the open expanse to close on the ranks of Persian archers, deadly at range but lightly armoured and no match for a Hoplite in close quarters, the Greeks of Marathon would distill their experience to a two word phrase: "We ran." It was their way of summing up the battle, their mad charge, the glory of what they accomplished. I wonder if the players of DeVry ever reunite, and over drinks commemorating the night they helped birth something silly into the world that wasn't there before, as Shel Silverstein might say, they ever look at one another and toast the Herculean effort of seven men who provided the fuel for the greatest loss in basketball history with the same phase? "We ran."
your beers are just lacroix you poser
I remember Paul Harvey raving about this game on his morning news the next day. I wish I could find a recording of it on the Net, but I guess I'll just have to be satisfied with my fading memory of said broadcast. Also, good on you for taking the time to catch the scoring errors. I can't really blame the scorers for messing it up a little, considering the sheer insanity of the game.
I'm a sports nut and I just stumbled into this. This is the best fucking thing on youtube. The whole thing. These videos make everything else on youtube, on TV look like shit. The lack of attention this guy's work gets it bordering on criminal. You don't even have to care about sports to love this. Youtube, get Helen Keller away from your algorithm settings. Anyone who stumbles into this will care. I now have the privilege of binge watching all these SB Nation and Jon Bois vids. I'm going to be depressed when I'm done, I know it.
This isn't pretty good. This shit is amazing
Thanks for another phenomenal video, Jon! You are the greatest!
great job on the research for all the crazy statistics. my brain is thumping
Just your normal 112 point game, no big deal
30:12 he dabbed again
Your "scrambled eggs" look absolutely disgusting. They look like yellow diarrhea.
Your "scrambled eggs" look absolutely disgusting. They look like yellow diarrhea.
This video is phenomenal, wish content like this got more recognition
So... so close to 400 points total. Even with the miscount, it didn't make it. To think that this game failed something however, would be preposterous. I congratulate the scorekeeper for doing that good of a job as to be only off by 5 points in a 100+ point blowout at 6.7 mph, and Jon for going through all that footage, writing, and pain to bring us a finality. I wish you nothing more than success
Wilt Chamberlain 100 point game was pretty good imo
you really eat scrambled eggs like that????
The episode just ended. I am genuinely moved. Such a small, such a trivial, event, and such a silly, minute, beautiful, erudite and grand treatment thereof. I don't know if I've ever seen anything like it. JB's work deserves greater recognition for his unique genius. I sincerely hope he makes more like this-- if it is possible to hit such an apex more than once.
What was the over/under?
Woah we went to the same high school thats so cool
This is pretty good!
This video aaalmost makes me wanna learn video production and editing. Damn fine work.
The only thing more staggering is how few views this has
this guy really spent his time breaking down a game nobody knew even existed. wtf? he's def single.
Great content. You reallllllllly gotta work on that sound mixing though, holy shit.
the intro to every video is such a waste of time.
25:48 lol omg how great
"there was no one left to compare them to....they kept climbing" *Me getting caught up in the tone of the video*: YOU FOOLS!!! YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOUVE BECOME
Honestly though A high school diploma and alot of time is really all you need to be good at anything these days. More power to ya, Jon
Those eggs did not look done...
Louisville!
Watching this really high is incredible
Why does this just seem like one of the best video I have watched ever. I think it is the care and effort put into something that matter so little to the world but to you and myself as I was watching it is the most important thing ever that he score was off by 5 points. Jon I don’t know how or why you do this but I love you for it.
The last ten minutes of this video is basically Oliver Stone's JFK
I W A S P A R T O F T H E T E A M A T D E V R Y
What an extremely strange game.... to not only get blown out, not only give up 250+ points, but to be CORDIAL about it.
In serious tone "I watched it with trusted associates, which proved extremely valuable." "Did he dab?" SB in a nutshell
I love how happy the DeVry players are to have lost by 100+ and given up the most points ever.
The editing is always more surreal then the topic he's talking about lol
This game is like someone playing an NBA video game while holding both controllers, lol.
John Bois should direct a 30 for 30
I FIND A LARGE ISSUE WITH THIS VIDEO. (Edit) My name is close to DeVry University's spelling.
I live in troy Alabama right next to dothan
wtf is a "dab?" showing my whiteness i suppose but seriously.....
These episodes scare me a bit.
17 38
This is outstanding. I don't remember how many times I've watched this. This is just very good content. Art, even.
Tried scrambling eggs how Jon does in this vid. It was pretty good, but too runny for my taste
This is probably the best Pretty Good episode
lmfao this is so good
Why did these have to stop
2:20 if you want to skip the ear-bleeding mish-mash of sounds after Jon's intro.
You did it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men%27s_basketball_game
The end of the video gave me chills. So well put together and such a great comparison between art and sport. Its such a nothing game, but such an important one.
Your editing gives me nightmares omg
Yo I love this series, I watch it when I'm doing homework or writing an essay, it's good content, great editing as far as story telling but in all honestly I hate when jon or whoever edits it makes it so repetitive it's annoying, for example this video, the intro it's like over and over and over the same footage, throughout videos of the series the climax is played out by some crazy fast paced editing, loud crazy music, non linear editing and reptative, I wouldn't mind if it was once or twice but it's done in every video
The percents of the games are of a half
Lmaoo 6:08 I go to Mars Hill University
Is Troy State the same as Troy university
This is quite possibly the best youtube video I’ve ever watched
Im convined "Pretty Good" is just a video diary of Jon's spiral downward to insanity
DEVRY. WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT SUCCESS.
This was pretty good, but good god what were those eggs?
I just noticed that during each chapter countdown, the entire clock rotates, not the clock hand. Notice the thicker marks on the clock face.
"We're Troy State We once scored Two fifty-eight We Devastate All U Suckas better Relate Got No Time fo' Hate"
You won't see this probably but the quotes spattered through out the video are a beautiful touch
Jon Bois makes videos about sports that I'd like to make - something that makes these little details relevant to folks who may not be into sports and bring out the drama, the absurdity, and humanity of it.
Homeric works about for-profit colleges
13:57
wtf Jon, you went to Waggener?
Stop the internet, for I have witnessed the final epic.
best episode yet
Each one of your pieces is simply a work of art!
2.2 percent chance (insert lavar ball joke)
Jon Bois GOAT
this was a spiritual experience
I don't want to be that guy but why is it that you never cites your sources for these vids. If someone wanted to look into these stories, how can they know that what you say is factual?
You googling "homeric works about for-profit colleges" made me choke on my sandwich
I have scored many basketball games, and this game is hell on earth for a scorer! I agree with Jon, it 's incredible that they were only off by 5 points.
Nobody in Alabama calls it Troy [State]
How come these don't get more views?
ty for the 2 minute YT poop intro for no fuckin reason.
Well Jon we grew up right next to each other. Come to Proof when you're in town next, my friend.
Jon Bois is the only person that can make this type of quality content on YouTube and only have 150k views
Got to hand it to Devry for having so much fun the whole time, kinda makes me smile that they can be getting kill but still smiling and having a great time
Jon Bois is a goddamn artist.
When will we see the next one? It's been 6 months?!
1:14 God, these videos are like surrealist movies/documentaries, they're brilliant. Why don't more people know about you?
I think the "dab" was them mimicking the Dee Brown dunk from the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest
You should do the Rangers-Orioles game years ago where the score was 30-3.
This man is the Tower of Babel of SB Nation.
What if I told you... the score of the highest scoring basketball game of all time... Was wrong? John Bois presents: 30 for 30
12:23 that's pretty good*
I like the way you think John
I've watched all the videos in the series during the last week (after stumbling across 17776) and been consistently blown away, I've already told everyone I know about this series, but somehow this most recent addition to the series is the best of them all - I can't wait to see what Jon goes on to do in the future, he seems to be some sort of genius storyteller.
w e ' r e s e r i o u s a b o u t s u c c e s s
just discovered this series. Its pretty good.
The score was changed on Wikipedia.
The Wikipedia now recognises this score and includes : " On March 13, 2017, SB Nation's Jon Bois published a video in which he argued that the correct final score of the game was Troy State 253, DeVry 141. Relying on a recording of the game posted to YouTube, Bois counted all made baskets and arrived at 253 points for Troy State. He identified two potential scorer's errors: a Troy State dunk that went in after the horn had errantly blown that resulted in a return of the ball to Troy State, and an attempted three-point basket that ended with the ball lodged between the backboard and rim.[8]"
You sir are pretty damn good
This is the greatest thing ever.
In the video before the alley-oop where the ball got stuck, the announcers say "255" as their score and do not count it as there is a 3-pointer made shortly after for the 258 final score. So not sure how that is part of the phantom points.
Skip to 2:22. You'll thank me later.
It is 1:30 in the morning and I have work tomorrow. I have NO idea how i got here can someone send help
We need more of these!
But what if you removed the three point shots alltogether?
This video could have been half as long.
For those who like reading those quotes, or want to skip to some spot but are stuck on mobile: •1 THE FUN AND GUN ~ 2:20 •2 DEVRY ~ 4:09 •3. DEVRY OF DECATUR ~ 5:49 •4 THE SKY ~ 8:39 •5 THE SCOREBOARD ~ 10:27 #5.5 (First Movie Clip) - 13:45 •6 THE CLOCKS ~ 14:20 •7 THE TRIPS ~ 16:06 •8 THE BALL ~ 17:52 •9 CHINONE ~ 20:48 •10 [ERROR] ~ 22:13 •11 BABLE ~ 28:29 •12 END ~ 31:08
Could you calculate the highest theoretical score, with one team intentionally inbounding to the other who then shoots a 3 with 100% accuracy?
Great video, but please, either turn your mic up, or turn the music down. Because around last chapter, I had to turn the volume up and down, either because you were too silent, or because music was fucking screaming.
John can u get me an internship at SB nation? U have my dream job fr
You should do a pretty good on the appalachian state vs michigan upset
dude i love your videos but that intro almost gave me a panic attack and the scrambled eggs thing was disgusting please dont do that again
Don't forget that DeVry was a punch line in a Michael Jordan Nike commercial.
It's been changed now. LOL! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men%27s_basketball_game
I feel like I just watched an indoctrination video for a cult.
When is Pretty Good coming back Jon I love your videos?
the production value of your videos never ceases to blow my mind. your videos have like genuine scores playing, and when something so absurd and ridiculous happens it's impossible to believe, we're met with these shrill strings that genuinely scare me. in the 222-0 episode, the sudden music following the tale of the guy who blocked the field goal genuinely made my stomach sink.
All eggs are disgusting but the video is pretty good.
DO NOT WATCH THIS ALL AT ONCE YOU WILL ACTUALLY GO INSANE
Why do you make them so creepy
hiyoutube
amazing
This is... Pretty Good
Hhhghhh go to truth contest site read the present
What does he use to make these graphs and presentations?
A. This is incredible, as always. B. What's the music that starts around the 10:05 mark?
Pretty Good is the Dark Side of the Moon of Youtube content.
MORE PRETTY GOOD
eh, this video is pretty good
that's cool I go to Waggener right now
this IS capitalism
Notice the song in "The Clocks" chapter is sped up.
The use of music in the series is absolutely fantastic.
GIVE THIS MAN AN OSCAR!
This really could be like 10 mins shorter tbh. Not hating, just constructive criticism
What is this damned brilliance? I don't know anything about basketball, I'm not american and I've never seen a basketball game in my life, nor a DeVry commercial. But I can understand an art performance made by two teams in silent, respectful, sportsmanlike coalition, not competing against one another, but competing against history and obscurity. After 17776 I was starving for more of your content and I've found amazing stuff, if not better. Jon Bois you're amazing. I wonder what kind of content you'd do if you weren't into sports.
I've watched this video maybe 17776 times
lol, 253 to 141 looks like a cricket score, not a basketball score
I'm not normally into sports, but this channel is fuckin cool. It's like the Polygon of sports.
devry got a basketball ball team
MORE. MOAR
Off to Wikipedia I go!
Those eggs looked like chunks of egg in butter soup
dude i live in louisville to
Why do you insist on making a great video then putting the most annoying intro ever on it
So... Has the NCAA addressed this at all or...?
Tried cooking eggs the way you said. It didn't work. Stirred for like 12 minutes and nothing happened.
That Eugene tv schedule tho.
Y O L E T S B R E A K I T D O W N
I've watched this episode about 4-5 times and the meaning of the "Babel" section had gone right over my head until today
17:40
Do one about the 1972 Olympic Basketball Final.
Good content. But too much irrelevant stuff wasting my time
WE'VE BEEN WAITING 2 DAMN MONTHS UPLOAD PRETTY GOOD ALREADY
HOOOOOT SAAAAAUUUUUCCCCEEEEE
Should do the 33-inning minor league game if he makes another episode, it's got some funny/ridiculous little stories associated with it.
That intro sound was worse than nails on a chalkboard jesus Jon
Jon Bois has no real reason to be this good.
I might've shed a few tears watching this.
fucking trippy
Do more!!
you got your scrambled egg technique down but i recommended beating with a whisk in a separate bowl before adding to the pan. this aerates your eggs and results in a fluffier texture when cooked. oh yeah the rest of the video is good too
Please do a video on the immense hatred of sports blogger Chris Chase
Bring Pretty Good back please! It would be more than pretty good. It would be amazing!
who else got tingles whenever that transition music played
Use better music it conda creepy
that intro was cancer
chino hills inspiration
this is important
It's almost as bad as the all star game
How does this not have more views? I got goosebumps watching this.
I just sat here and watched every pretty good and it was the best thing ever
So I don't know if Jon Bois is responsible for all of this but I tip my hat to whomever wrote in the Trojan/Iliad references!
this fucker right here makes the best videos on the Internet.
What is the creepy piece of music that's reused in several Pretty Goods?
Anyone know the song that starts at 5:58 ?
Can somebody get ahold of the NCAA and get them to officially review the scoring discrepancy?
This man eats his eggs raw
The first person to dab
Pretty Good episode 12 https://youtu.be/rERQVN3sh9E
you need a special broadcast segment on ESPN
i'll take back a part of what i said about linking a film. this is a film. you could win an oscar if you wanted to. but really, i want to see your student art projects or weekend bullshit when you were 19. you're remarkably good at this.
there were dudes on BOTH teams that really thought they were headed for the league. big props on all of them for keeping it moving though. i hear the eighties were a wild time. i'm 54.
I'm just here for the egg recipe EDIT: I couldn't totally replicate it (has to take a couple of brief pauses to let the eggs turn solid-ish), but it's better eggs than I was making.
How much La Croix you been drinkin', Jon?
This guy is such a good journalist
That's pretty incredible. That a game is so high scoring that they couldn't even keep up with it. But with the computer technology today they wouldn't have that issue anymore.
The music at 12:37 always gets me
incredible video. please continue to make these. they are by far the comfiest videos i have ever seen - such intricate amount of detail on seemingly mundane and overlooked moments that really bring out the minute bits of humankind....its awe inspiring. i love these.
HURRY UP AND MAKE ANOTHER GODDAMN PRETTY GOOD ALREADY
I don't think you're a total goofus, Jon.
Jon I really hope you see this. This is the most quality produced video I have ever seen on youtube. Everything about it is perfect, thank you.
This is one of the greatest videos I've ever seen
Wait.. So their website says "more than 55 locations". Their rough number of locations wasn't even rounded to something ending in a zero, they rounded down to 55 from 60. WHO DOES THAT?
The Wikipedia page is protected until June 20 because people keep changing the score
jon has a talent for making anything seem cry inducing glorious
real talk that intro gave me a headache
What the name of the song at the end?! It's perfect for that spot in the video and it just sounds PRETTY GOOD!
O H ! !
26:03 The first dab ever recorded in human history! Holy shit!
This video is fantastically awesome in its over the top seriousness. Well done.
Jon Bois is the Adam Curtis of sports
Jon makes the best content on YouTube i can't think of any other creator who cares as much as he does about quality
Troy vs DeVry is real-life Breaking Madden. I think that's why Jon made this video.
This video is beautiful.
I know Americans are not as into soccer as basketball, baseball, or football, but I think Leicester City's 2015-16 story to become the most unlikely champions of English soccer would make a Pretty Good episode.
I demand Netflix pay you to make more episodes
I absolutely love the mixing of the movie clips, the sorta acid trip nature of the editing, which probably simulates how watching this live must have been for the few thousand who saw it. Also I don't exactly blame the official scorers for miscounting the score, at that point your brain is probably fried from watching what you can hardly do in a video game today (let alone at the time).
These videos are some of the best I've seen in my life
Seriously, this may as well be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
I LOVE JON BOIS
I reeeaaaalllyyy want a pretty good on the longest tennis match in history between John isner and Nicolas Mahut. They played a total of 11 hours 5 minutes, spanning 3 days, in which the final game ended 70-68. It is almost double the record of the second longest game, which clocks in at 6 hours 43 minutes, and had a final game score of 15-13.
The part where the Troy guy says that DeVry wanted them to get the record and were having fun with it may be one of the best shows of good sportsmanship I've ever seen on DeVry's part.
HOYAAAAA
I'd like to suggest doing an episode on one guy from Grinnell college I think it was a few years back and scored 130+ points.
I got to Troy University (formerly Troy State), and this game is talked about to this day still! It's a shame they are going to tear down the old Sartain Hall where the game happened, so much history is in that little gym.
yo, this shit's like some Yoko Taro ass shit... referencing Homer and shit in a game of basketball, fuck this got very metaphorical
This isn't really relevant at all but I'm pretty sure the court you are using in the diagram is an NBA court. Love your videos though. There really needs to be a Jon Bois playlist on this channel, that's all I really want to watch.
the least you could do was post a video on your own channel to say that we can find new videos on this channel, I've been craving "pretty good" like a crack addict with no dealer for so long
Devry: loses by 119 (112) points Their players after the game: "Hell yeah"
Love Jon Bois, but Breughel was Belgian!
11:00 A Honda Civic Type-R can hit around 150-160mph, nerd.
La Croix is so good
At 30:11 he dabs AGAIN (left side of screen)
A got one would be Clemente's inside the park walk-off grand slam. :)
29:57 the headline reads: "It's not a misprint!" oh if only they knew.....
"Pretty good" are the highest quality videos on the internet.
Those couldn't have been eggs
This is the type of channel that should have millions of subscribers. Not dudes playing Minecraft embarrasing themselves (and embarrasing themselves not because they play that game, but because the "Jokes" are embarrasingly bad).
you grew up in louisville?? thats where i live thats dope
Another comment, Jon. 1.8 points per minute would give you 72, not 73.
If you scored 6.4 points per minute, that would get 256 points, not 253. To get 253, they'd need to score 6.325 points per minute.
Yay! I live for the Pretty Good episodes! They need more exposure, they're always so fascinating!
This video is amazing
Truly amazing stuff.
Jon, do a pretty good about archie griffin.Only put up average numbers in the nfl, and yet was a 2 time heisman at ohio state
why, do these videos keep popping up in my recommended? I don't really like them
Love these episodes! Lays it all out in an interesting and informative way! Thanks
insanity, lmao
This is honestly my favorite series that I have ever found on youtube
Thank god Jon you're back... I thought you were gone forever
Jon do you know what the beginning song is? Or does anyone else know?
On Wikipedia it was changed to 253-141
3:28 - Okay, so I'm a big hockey fan, but over the last couple of decades the game's kinda seen some drastic changes in regards to how it's played... Teams nowadays generally play with tight defensive systems, preferring to wait for the other team to make a mistake and capitalise on it. The quality of play's gotten higher, since teams don't make many mistakes, but because of that scoring is nowhere as high as it was in the 70's, 80's and early 90's, and I guess I just don't find the game as fun as it once was. I guess what I'm saying is, I'd love to see a coach take the Fun N' Gun system and try to adapt it to the game of hockey. Emphasise speed, never stop moving; when you get into the offensive zone quickly find the best scoring chance you can get, shoot and go for rebounds if you can; and when you're on defence always go to steal the puck, and generally just keep the game moving as fast as possible. It'd be tough, no doubt - in a league where every team waits for mistakes, having a system that would doubtlessly create lots of mistakes would be a challenge - but I'd love to see it; I'd love to see someone try to make hockey fun again.
I love this series, keep up the great work. Also, you may want to look into one of the most futile football games ever played. North Texas vs Florida International, with 7 overtimes
Its amazing how something so minuscule and pointless in life can be so fascinating to watch. Good job on the content
Vsauce meets Mike Korzemba
God bless Jon Bois. This is the best series on YouTube.
Jesus was the word incarnate. You, Jon, are a sports Necronomicon given life. And I love you for it.
God damn, these Pretty Good videos are brilliant.
Not sure if anyone else has mentioned these things, but... 1. One natural comparison would be the last couple years' NBA All-Star games, where there was some drama over whether they could run the score up to 200. 2. When Roller Derby is played with basketball scoreboards (as it often is) they have similar problems displaying the score. There it's tough to keep track of the score every game, so their officiating, bookkeeping, and scorekeeping systems are designed around it.
These are fucking amazing. Never ever stop making these Jon. Please. Im fucking obsessed with these
The immense amount of work put into this video makes amazing quality. This series is awesome
This is pretty much Chino Hills' whole offense strategy
jon bois you are a god
141 points in a loss... not bad DeVry, not bad. Great episode!!!
I discovered this channel recently and watched all 11 previous episodes and did not know what to do with life. Thank god for this :-) Make more frequently.
Bois has the best edited videos, he needs his own TV show
Like if from Decatur or Atlanta
This video is pretty good.
Wait, why isn't this on Jon's channel?
i have no idea what you said about basketball in the first part i was too focused on the eggs
Greatest series on YouTube
said it before, but it's worth saying it again. This is pretty good.
If you go to edit on the wikipedia of the score there is a note that reads: "DO NOT CHANGE THE FINAL SCORE TO 253-141. That is not the official score, and the NCAA doesn't recognize it as such. Just because some guy at SB Nation claims he saw two buckets miscounted does NOT make it official. Any edits to the final score on this article will be reverted immediately without question." That is pretty funny.
25:55 thank me later.
I love this series!!!!
I freaking love these vids don't ever stop making them!
intro gave me cancer severely lacking smooth jazz all in all, pretty good
This might be my favorite video on YouTube. Ever. I'm serious. This is like you took everything good about video essays and NPR radio labs and put it in the context of sports
JON BOIS??!?!?!? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MAN?!
wowza this is trippy
30 minute jon bois video yes
That intro was Aids
so this game reminds me of this years all star game
What tf is this?
Great ass video
That fast break style of play is becoming popular again at the high school level. The Ball brothers and Chino Hills won over 60 games in row and was the number 1 team in the 2016 USA Today High School Sports Super 25.
Im high as shit and this is the best channel on Youtube when you're high.
Ugh, those are fucking Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs. +1 for Tapatio, though.
seriously man, you have to work on your audio levels..
This is the best video I've ever seen in my life.
Looks like Chino Hills
the beginning was so trippy
This is the best thing to ever happen to the internet
THANK GOD HE MADE ANOTHER ONE
those first 2 minutes were annoying af
I actually realized something. I don't think this game would be as tiring for the players as one might initially think, even with 7 players on DeVry's team. In a normal basketball game, most players on the court are used in every possession both on offense and on defense. Thus, every player must keep moving, stay involved, AND sprint both up and down the floor for offense and defense. In a game like this, usually only one or two guys are involved per play. So if you rotated the person taking the ball up the court and scoring, then the other guys would actually get to basically stand on the court and rest for the next minute or two, since they aren't playing defense. I think this is how the ridiculous breakneck pace was kept throughout the entire game.
Waiting for the Wikipedia for this game to be changed
Jon puts so much time and effort into these and they are amazing
Don't do the chapter format pls
So they basically played like chino hills before chino hills.
A 3-15 team scored 141 points what a time for basketball...
oh shit i didn't know jon went to waggener. i didn't know people graduated from waggener. i thought all of them drop out
This video is magnificent
I am not the least bit interested in basketball. I know the basic rules and stuff, but the game never interested me. But the connections to mythology, the editing, the use of music: this is one of the top ten videos I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of videos in my 5 years on this website.
have you written a book yet, your Pretty Good series is really good. i would buy that.
You're from Louisville??? and you went to Waggener??? I now feel more connected to you than ever, Jon.
Finally... A defensive scheme that James Harden can fit in to
This is hands down the best series on youtube
why isn't then last game of the 2011 mlb season an episode by now
YES, A NEW PRETTY GOOD
Devrywereseriousaboutsuccess.gif
Has this caused an edit war on Wikipedia yet? :)
this is like actual professional cinematography
That intro had me tripping
watched this cause I thought it would be kool... ...... about 2 minutes in I thought I was on drugs
You forgot the fact that it took 7 people to put together the box score, which took an hour to complete. The fact that it took multiple people that long to complete a box score is amazing in itself. Another great video Jon, keep it up.
You're the greatest American humorist active today, and every time I consume any of your content I ponder on how god damned criminal it is that so few people have seen what I have seen and laughed as hard as I have laughed. I don't give a shit about sports, man. Nothing is more boring to me other than church, but every single episode of pretty good has made me care, sit back, and stop to breathe.
No wonder I've stopped getting notifications of pretty good. I am subd to John Boise, not sbnation.
18:07 whats the song in this part, i love the saxophone
YES MORE PRETTY GOOD!!!1!
I love this series. Does anyone know why so few of his videos in this series can even get close to 100k views when the content is this solid? Someone should do a Pretty Good episode on that.
OOOOOOOOOOOO JON UPLOADED
Is it bad that I pronounce it Jon Bwah in my head?
yes... it's here..... YESSSS
Jon felt the art strongly in this one
This isn't a YouTube video it's art.
Yessss
it feels " pretty good " when john bois makes a video
Please keep making these, Jon. They are wonderful!
I gave it a like after watching 36 seconds. Let's watch the rest. I'm already crying. This is pretty good.
How does this video have any dislikes
This video was pretty good
I have NEVER seem a comment section this unanimously positive! No smack talk, no politics. If all he ever did was inspire this one comment section of goodness that's PRETTY GOOD!!!!! But ya, like everyone else here I am a fan/ borderline fanboy. Great work. P
Please make more, I love these. In the meantime I'll just keep rewatching them all.
Bart, you should have thought about that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.
"pretty good" OOOHH YES
Wait a second your from Kentucky? I'm live in Kentucky we should go hang out and talk about how much better Kentucky is than Louisville or argue about it. Either way it should be a great time.
I love this show so much
Amazing vid
OH MY GOD IT'S BACK MY FAVORITE SERIES ON YOUTUBE WE LOVE YOU JON BOIS
How do u not have infinite subscribers
The story was pretty good. But the video was more than that
THANK GOD ITS BACK! I've been waiting Jon, thanks man
upload this on Jon Bois channel please!!!!!!!!
I freaking love these videos
YES OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JON BOIS IS BACK!!!!!
Another pretty good feature of this series: Finding the first dab over 20 years before it became popular.
:O A new pretty good
oretty good ol johnno
Usually if the scorer makes an error there is plenty of time for someone to notice and correct the error but in this unique game I can imagine that the game was so fast it was difficult for someone else to catch the error.
DevRy: We're serious about success
love this jon.
devry got a basketball ball team
I'm here to compliment Mr. Bois' use of Google Earth in these videos. Pretty Good, Jon.
Thanks for another crowning achievement of mankind Mr. Bois.
after the horn going off for the first 2 "fake" points, did the team score off of the reuslting posession?
jon is the best
Jon, I understand now why you said this was your favorite episode yet. Thank you so much for making this. I'd call it all sorts of hyperbolic adjectives, but it feels inappropriate to call it anything but pretty good.
You heathens know nothing about the custardy reward of a slowly scrambled egg, with microscopic curds. Also this video was wildly entertaining.
What's the song that plays during Chapter 4, or the one that starts at 8:47? I've seen Jon use that one a lot, and I'm dying to know what it is
Amazing again Jon, the fact that you find such unusually compelling stories to tell and tell them in such a distinctive way is a stunning achievement. One question though - with Pretty Good moving to the SB Nation channel does that mean there won't be any more non-sports episodes like the balloon chair?
Teach me your ways one day, I want to become a statistic genius like you Jon
Excellent work, Jon. I've enjoyed all of Pretty Good, but I particularly appreciate the effort that was put into this one. The format, the music, the way the awe never quite leaves your voice...there's something, for lack of a better word, substantial about this piece that I really dig. It doesn't feel like just another Internet video. It feels like art. Anyway. Thanks for this - keep up the good work.
this is lit
these are more interesting that some 30 for 30's
was that intro a drug trip
25:53 the first ever dab...amazing
The hell was that intro
FINALLY MORE JOHN BOIS!!!!!!! THANK YOU SB NATION.
>Discovers First recorded Dab  >Becomes Editor in Chief. Living The Dream.
Jon, never learn to balance your audio. Makes it soo much better.
It's so funny cause nowadays my college routinely beats Troy in basketball. I have a newly found respect for them
I remember back when I played NCAA Football on the Xbox 360. I made a Dynasty mode coach on the Oregon Ducks, the team who had the fastest paced offense at the time. You used to be able to edit the roster of your team however you liked. At first, I would edit the QB and the Backs. But later in the coach's career, I would edit everyone. Everyone would be a 99 OVR in every category. I accumulated a winning streak that went far beyond the 47 game record set by the Oklahoma Sooners. Eventually, The streak went into the hundreds. I consistently beat teams by 200 or more. One time I scheduled a FCS team and broke the game's scoring limits. I even beat the best teams, like Alabama or Ohio State, by over 100. To this day I still haven't lost a game on the dynasty, primarily due to the fact that I haven't touched my copy of NCAA Football 14 in around a year. I have my Xbox away to a younger cousin when I received a PlayStation 4 for Christmas in 2015. Godspeed, Dillion Schneider. You shall be missed.
Just commenting to say how absurdly happy I am to have a new Jon Bois video!!!
Jon Bois is a straight up genius
I like this series so much that I would pay for YouTube Red to watch it
"3 left turns will send us in the same direction" Jon, i'm sorry, i goofed up my username reference based on the word of a time traveller i thought i could trust, but he was really some sort of trickster beyond time and space bent on embarrassing me for miscounting by 5... wait great video
The Stanislov Petrov episode has been in the shop for well over a year now, right? You didn't send it to Jon's Sandwich Shop, did you?
The 3 dislikes are salty DeVry fans (if it's even possible to be a fan of them)
These videos are so weird, yet so interesting and informative. I love it.
This is great and as a current Troy student, I can tell you that this game is legendary, basically a myth already. It seems even more unreal now.
Thank you Jon, superb as always
Thank you I needed another one of these
Good Shit!
I would buy these on Blu Ray.
At 5:18 I mentally inserted the creepy music from Eyes Wide Shut.
Awesome video jon
This reminds me of when I used to create conferences of teams in NCAA Football on the Gamecube, Xbox 360 and PS3 that wouldn't normally exist. The DeVry Vikings were always at war with the rival ITT Tech Sharks.
The video we need, but don't deserve
love the series, but you have to be on something.
Yay, a new video from this series!
This is the only good video on YouTube
this is art, jon
Another Pretty Good episode!? I thought this series was dead, glad it's not :)
I found myself getting emotional at the end of this and im not sure how i feel about that
This might've buzzed in 8th period for me and got my phone taken but this was pretty good.
Poetic
Phenomenal.
Thank you Jon. Your videos are wonderful!
And now Troy is in the NCAA tourney. What a time to be alive.
What was 4 about? I wasn't here when it was out so never seen it.
hey that's pretty goooood
#morejon why isnt he uploading to his channel anymore
Honest to god those were the worst scrambled eggs I've ever seen
KEEP THESE VIDEOS COMING I CANT WAIT THIS LONG
ITS BACK
This was a pretty good experience.
Basketball, the question with no answer...
So proud of u Jon.
[in the shop for repairs] nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Jon Bois is BACK BABY
W E ' R E S E R I O U S A B O U T S U C C E S S
I was going to say this was fantastic as always, but really it was... Pretty Good
Don't love the chapter format but another great video
This is a fantastically put together. Good job. I love these
This should be on Jon Bois channel
This should be on Jon Bois channel
I was not expecting to have a philosophical experience when watching a video bout the highest scoring men's basketball game ever, but life's pretty strange like that.
God bless you, Kip Smithers.
Score got changed https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Troy_State_vs._DeVry_men's_basketball_game
Why do you enjoy eggs with the consistency of creamed corn? Also, bring back [4]!
hey the music is pretty good too!
It's so weird that Sartain Hall is now used for intermural basketball only
This video is like porn. The intro was really annoying, but the main content was amazing.
So this is why you don't put forth as much content as you used to. The burden of this knowledge is too great for any one man. Thank you, Jon.
this is Oscar award winning quality, Jon. Pretty good
Looking at the Wikipedia page for this game, there is now a small paragraph mentioning this video. Congrats Jon, you made it to Wikipedia fame.
DeVry: We're serious about success
This leaves me speechless. Thank you for existing Jon.
Troy is my favorite school so I'm pretty glad you uploaded this
Jon I don't think that those eggs look very good :(
Well... this video was more than pretty good.
Jon Bois is the poet laureate of my generation.
BOI HE DABBIN
Jon Bois is a genius I am obsessed about your videos
This is incredible.
in b4 this video blows up
These videos are amazing
best breaking madden ever
Loving these videos, keep up the good work!
13th
why are the intros always so creepy
as soon as I saw the notification I stopped what I was doing to watch this
And I just have to say that the utter positivity of all the players in this game is an awesome factor.
Jon Bois is pretty good
How is it that you can generate some of the best content on the Internet on such a regular basis. Thank you for this amazing story and keep up the amazing work
Those eggs definitely weren't done
Do the 19-18 NBA game next.
My boy Jon Bois at it again.
love these, watch as soon as i see them

Rams is my family
Lowkey this makes remember of that movie "Remeber the titans"
“Really strong arm”. Lol
Hercules??
Did 18 ever go D1?
Imagine what would happen if the coach ran contact and Goff got his ACL torn
Dope!!! Lol
Remember that Jesus loves you and Jesus saves?????? Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life! John 14:6 With God all things are possible! Matthew 19:26 God is good all the time and all the time God is good! Amen?? Have a blessed day??
#18 is D12 lmao
Brock looks like Mitch trubisky
WHAT IS WITH THE SANDWICH SOUND EFFECTS?
Those tattoos suit him good for some reason ??
"Hercules" lmao
You can tell high college level players, regardless if they go to a big school or not. Dude has a cannon. I honestly didnt realize how big Goff was. goodness
Guy 1: He asked if I was the punter. Guy 2: So disrespectful. Actual Punter: Gently weeps*
I've seen a few of these "Transfer" videos and Goff was the best transfer yet. What are you, the punter? That's a line for the ages.
Awesome.
Whats your name ? Dog.
Are you the punter? Lmao
Why the number 18’actig like that. Jeez
Rams 2018 baby
"broski"....best last name ever!
Lmao that little spud monkey ain’t goin d1
K
Who?
Goff throws a beautiful deep ball so effortlessly!
Nice
How the coach gonna let that kid talk back to him like that?
We need so many more of these!
pranks unsuspecting college football team.
wat college team wears those headgear lol
Around 2:10 : Jeff Spicoli goes quarterback...
Ya name daug? ??
#18 is annoying af
Rams 6-0
Fake and gay
Check out my last post . I almost touched lil skies at a concert
6-0 baby
#18 needs to stfu. What dude needs to do is fix his face. #Proactive
This is still awesome as heck!!!! Made my day guys
Great stuff!
Mooshagian Hell ya
wierd you didnt show any comments from the starting qb
Why are they wearing scrum hats, in practice?
Where is the d one getting his money
I lost it when he called him the Punter.
boooo 619-917-6945
Just remember Patriots fans, 18-1.................................18-1.
Tl;dr NFL players comes and shits on a bunch of nobodies who aren’t going to make it in football. How is this good-natured it’s pretty shitty
This video cracks me up
Lol, "You the punter bro?"
And none of these kids made it
Lke if you realized my spelling error
Editing can be better, ie. showing the reaction of the "reveal"
Thats my QB im from LA
These kids probably had no idea with this huge camera crew showing up
Holy Beautiful
Haha that was great! Thanks so much for posting. This must have been a tremendous experience for those young men and it was great of Jared to do it.
And VC went on to an incredible 2-11 season
At 5:08 number 86 looks like she is a halfway through a male to female transition.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-MyRFjxjmw4
Great video moron
Still can't beat Fullerton go hornets
That's awesome. :)
how did they not notice his jersey is number 16+ that hair do boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That was awesome lol
This is beyond uber awesome!
be even funnier if they didn't tell the coaches
'What was yall's record last year?' Uhhh.umm.
Terrible job on that wig
idiots
That dude trying to go D1 is way undersized. No doubt he’s fast but I’d worry if he got tackled by an NFL sized player.
I don't know why but that sound of him chewing was disgusting. Maybe because it sounded squishier than it should have.
I’ve watched this multiple times and I thought this was a high school.
Nobody caught the fact that there’s a dude at :35 really sporting the last name “Broski”? lol
Classic
Ryan gosling ?
#18 is the type of player to talk back to the coaches and make everybody do push ups
Well done Red Bull, that was pretty funny. ??
#18 needs to seriously just sit down and work.
Number 18 will not make it for ego.
That’s cool
5:12 mfw I'm taking a smash in the bathroom & my gf barges in without knocking
Need more of these
I told a chemistry joke the other day, and I got no reaction
RED BULL does not give u wings..
Dude that guy's ears @1:25 are freakin' tiny
Jared Goff is a BALLER!
I was at a nationally ranked DIII school and during my junior year we had a pitcher transfer from down south. He's throwing in the lower 90's hitting spots and mixing his pitches well. Pretty much the entire team was salivating, as we were already returning 2 all-region pitchers. Fucker dropped out of school a week before the first game of the season.
Just an FYI. They were conference champs in 2012, -2014-15-16-17 and have been to a bowl game every year since 2011.
I really liked the vid it's actually pretty funny Jared golf is a decent player come check my new vids you would really like them ??
Scripted
Their quarterback at the end was like thank god...
“What are you the punter” ????
My dad played here
Good one cuz!
That looks like so much fun. What a nice video.
Gawd, # 18 likes to run his mouth!
"All these cameras. They're interviewing us. The guy in the funky wig must be Jared Goff."
That's awesome!
Are these special needs kids?? Looks like a protective cover.
Hahaha "what was your record last year?" Lmfao
No fucken clue who that dude is..
As soon as he uncorked that deep ball they should know that unless he is coming from the California Penal League they've been punked lol.
What's the deal with those helmets?
Why is football all about the money it’s only about to play the game for me
Pretty good? Lol very dwhat?
That kid wouldn't last in d1 talking back.
That was dope!!????
Is this fake
Bunch of cry babies
Never heard of this guy. Must suck
That was cool
I wish I'd be bigger and not so small. I want to sling it like goff. I can't even hold the ball tight or throw it properly
I fist read the title as "transgender prank" and I was wee bit confused
He’s fuckin doodoo my girl likes him tho??
My old football coach from sacramento state
I love how Goff was almost a draft bust due to Jeff Fischer sucking as a coach. Makes you wonder how many others players lives and carrers were ruined due to shyt coaching!
I dislike people like that short rat #18 barking loud . Little chihuahua
came for that disgusting looking thumbnail.
QB's like...there goes my scholarship ??
Song? 4:37
i still don't know who he is LOL
Lol number 15 got scared that he will get his starting spot taken away??????
" what's your record last year ' " Shhhhhh " " that's why im here " " what you mean " ????????
Always dream big!
3:30 "What are you the punter?" lol
Please pay attention in school kids or this is what happens. 00:24
R F t let
Go Hawks!
Lol. Their jaws dropping when they see him sling it is my fav part.
RIP Mac Miller Always REMember !
Did anyone catch a pass that day from any quarter back ??
Very entertaining!
How would this ever not be staged? Oh just ignore those camermen theyre just messing around today. Or do they record it after and force reactions like a movie?
Jay Hickman
#18 trash asf
????????
This dude just threw for 465 yrds and 5 TDs vs the Vikings. LOL!!!!!!!!!!
Redbull needs to do this for all their athletes. Could you imagine Mark Marquez at a club race?
1:46 I mean i like Jared Goff, but he isn't an all-pro quarterback.
805 LOVE
That was great Goff
Loved it
#18 sounds like t.o with Tony romo
what type of football is that bc it aint tackle lmao
#18 is probably a 3rd stringer
bruh i would of socked number 18 he already pissing me off and its not even 2mins in the video lol chill bruh who tf r u
This reminds me of that one episode when Patrick put a wig on andwent inside the Krusty krab and then got hit on by Mr k himself because he thought he was a girl. Either way cometely off topic.
Jered ain't a familiar face when it pertains to QBs. Most if them were like...'ok' it's jered.....
BUILD THAT WALL NGGGG
That was cool
is this a Juco School or?
18 is a thug.
Inspiration....
Is that a chick at 5:09 ???
Is Jay related to Mike Vanderjagt?
The real prank will be when #13 "The Punter" takes Jared Goff's job with the Rams in a few years.
That WR is a good dude. He was sticking up for his QB's.
These guys are scrubs lol
Who the duck is this guy
kid at the end..."remember this for the rest of my life"....it's all about memories....life.
So we are just going to ignore the helmets?
i see all that green and i see all the money ima get in D1!! LOL!!!
That number 18 dude rude asf he ain't making it in the NFL with that attitude but hes loyal
They should’ve gave him the QB position to see what the reaction would be lol
Ryan Gosling is a pretty good QB. Who would have known?
He took off the Wig and everyone acted like they instantly recognized him
5:07 Nice to see girls playing college football
I am trying to get money cuzzzz
"Come on up here Jared!" ..sucks in gut..lol!
This fake there are so many cameras they can tell
Too Much Fun!
#18 said something like "he trying to get dat green from Division 1" blag blah blah. I thought you cant take money while in college, I guess he meant an academic scholarship since he spoke so eloquently.
What are you the punter lol
loved this
Why you trying to make him look like Kyle Orton?
Now that was good stuff. LMAO
#18...self appointed team leader.
Nothing more obnoxious than wannabe D1s.
Goff just beat the Vikings too.
If they stop kneeling I will once again watch NFL ...until then not watching
Hey thats our quarterback
Can someone please explain why this isn’t a weekly show here. The premise is F’n great! But I guess there would be some limitations. You couldn’t really bring in 6’3 Julio Jones and say he’s a goofy transfer.
Is Goff good enough to play for that team?
This is fake
Hey! Number 18! You're not a star. You're not the coach. BE QUIET!
Maybe they should have used a better QB...
I cannot stand 18 ??????
Why are they wearing scrum caps
It's sad how number18 is not accepting a new teammate who could change the teams lossing record" if this wasn't a prank" .. #18 is the bad seed who he just talks about money money money but he ain't gonna make money money money if he's not open to new teammates who could bring Change to the teams out come and win games and than d1or college could look at this team and be like dang there good and pick the good ones on the team but #18 is feeding the already bad team with negative comments ..look nfl teams trade there bad seed players all the time and some teams end up being good with new members ..#18 should know this and accept new teammates no matter what bc at the end of the day he's gonna be on the team so why talk crapp to a new member of the team which he don't know anything about him ..it takes one new member to change a bad team ....#18 You gotta go you bad seed bye bye ????????????????????
I like brock
0:46 why does Brock look like the guy that played Clark in Smallville?
They wouldn't recognize him without the disguise
Is there the son of former Colts Kicker Mike Vanderjagt???
5:57 .. smokepurpp?
i bet he cant throw the football over them mountains
TOO FUNNY....LOL
"I like Brock".. Goff- "who are you the punter?"
There’s no way that the TE’s last name is broski ??
He was rocking the long brown hair..
I live in Ventura
That was great!!!
This is funny
threw a straight interception, must be him LUL wonder how many takes it took to show him actually being good LMAO
Glad to see football man stand up
Wtf are those helmets
Jared Goff gonna win mvp this year, only bc of the weapons around him and that offensive system
#18 out here like hes a superstar playing with a paper helmet on. Go sit down somewhere
He kinda looks like Jared Goff.
I have Goff on my FFL team ??
Wish they showed more of the passes, receptions and the players reactions. Is there a longer version of this?
I have Goff on my FFL! Scrored 58 points! Haha??
Tom brady is the goat...but after my beloved patriots comes Jared Goff and the rams, love how things are going out there and I'm cheering for him
yoooo thats my hometown ! thats crazy #GOPirates
at 3:13 they’re hip...
Makeup artist and that wig is the best they got? Smh
Best QB in the League right now. Kurt Warner 2.0.....
Annoying but got to admire the loyalty and trust
5:56 # wtf is that gross little thing in between Goff and #22 Is it human?
dam dude b talkin bak he b cut b4 the game with belichick at the helm
Thats pretty kewl
THAT was funny!
"Everybody was clueless, everybody looked at him like he was hercules or something!"Lol?? 5:57
is 18 the mascot????
No way that’s my local community college haha
number 18 is that one guy that peaks in college and everybody hates
Running for the MVP this year the Goffinator!
WHERE MY VENTURA PEEPS AT!!!! We out here livinnnnn.
That loud mouf N need to STFU.
I love these pro pranks!
I remember my days in high school, Curtis Martin came to our practices when he was with the Patriots!
This is not real
His last name is broski haha that's great
#7 was a good teammate, unbiased and loyal but willing to let the new guy prove himself
"You fast?. Alright balls coming" Lol
"Can We Get Some Faster Guys Out Here"
I mean... Coulda been better
GOAT
Goff hasn't had an All-Pro selection yet....
Idk why they even dressed him up ain't nobody going to recognize him ??
#18 just happy he still gonna be starting
Jared Goff reminds me of Nicholas Cage
Jared played the part well
Anyone ever met his dad? Jack Goff?
we just hit 9 MILL LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Who’s Jared Goff??
That wig looks fake af LMAO
Lol
This looks a little too smooth to be genuine, still funny tho
WHAT ARE YOU THE PUNTER
This made me want to eat a sandwich ??
"At least I had the mole"
The one guy all about the money and always saying I I I got get there is no I in team
"Hercules" ??
Brock was on the locker room packing he missed the whole reveal.
This whole thing is a set up 0:34 dudes name is broski..... Nah breh
Who is that kid talking about "I'm gonna make money"
He’s use to nfl speep??
Lol compared him to Hercules
Nice
How does the role excuse Goff totally disrespecting the D3 guys? Haha he could have just played it nerdy but he shits on them
What college is that?
This actually illustrates how precise a pro qb actually is
We need more of this... Pros going undercover
Jared Goff is almost the same age lol
Y’all should do Obj or Ab that’ll be great!
“Thas mah quartahback.” 3:37 I’ve heard this one somewhere else before, just can’t put my finger on it...
That was super cool of Goff to do that
This feels scripted
Wait is that Mike Vanderjagt's son?
He looks like that gay guy from the Kardashians lmao
Black dude is “trying to get money” going D1. He is aware that’s illegal right? Hahaha moron
Jared Goff isn't an all pro quarterback. Get your facts right.
#18 annoying as hell!
Who is he
What was your record last year? Guess that's why I'm here, right? :)
I have to be missing something. Red Bull comes in to randomly do a professional-level mini-documentary with a D3 football team, and it just so happens they have a "new transfer" that same day clearly wearing a ridiculous wig. This has to be all staged, would the players really fall for that?
didn't prank long enough
Could you imagine being one of the players thinking damn we might have a chance with the new qb to find out it’s a joke
That was awesome. Huge Rams fan, even more now. GO RAMS!
Very Best Prank
"come up here...(different audio) ..Jared"
So what you want but seeing Goff devour a sandwich with no remorse instantly made me have more respect for him hahaha he sold me on how good that sandwich really was ??
Has anyone noticed Jared thanks his dad in every interview for not naming him Jack.
Yes Transgender you can look baby ????????
Wtf is those helmet
FAKE
Would’ve been funny Asfuck if the coach told the QB he lost his job to the transfer.
I go to Buena High school just about 5 minutes away from the college and it’s funny seeing some of the guys I used to play football with who graduated who now go to VC practice with Goff
He kinda looks like Big Ben
I like how they act like they didn't know.
Good to see this program doesn't discriminate genders and allows girls to play too 5:08
Yooo I went to high school with one of those QBS god dam
How much of this do you think is real? It seems mostly acting.
I just read the title as "Transgender prank" Wtf is wrong with me?!
When i come out heres and i seez green. Das me deers altot of monyeys i needs to make! Can someone please translate this for me?
Those other qb's were shitting their pants
im impressed by his sandwich eating technique, he made it look like air
WTF is that at 5:08 at left with the ear-rings. Is that a broad?
I played on this field!!!
00:28, odds are against him on getting a NFL contract.. He better hit the books too...
Notice how much better the receivers got when Goff was throwing to them? A practical demonstration of why a good QB is critical to the success of a team.
Best prank
I thought the whole thing was a skit. What’s up with the helmets, am I missing something?
lol, like he's any good.
That's disrespectful.
Looks like Jonathon cheban from Kardashian show
Not sure what the point was…
Tyreek Hill would be hilarious..
Ron weasley
sunshiiine...
look liie a young jake Palmer
I love the teammate that immediately went to bat for his quarterbacks.
wHatCHu meEn thO? He means you and your team suck kid.
Excellent!!!!
That was fun
Rookie Goff wouldn't even have made 3rd string on this team. He was AWFUL!!!!
More transfers lmao
TOO DUMB TO REALIZE ANYTHING
“The Transfer” starring Jared Goff as the transfer QB and Kevin Hart as the annoying midget wide receiver.
Red Bull: You deserve your 7.8 million views on this video. This was an emotional rollercoaster which ended on a high note, as there was much ebullience and elation upon his revealing himself. Well done.
Whoever did the makeup needs to get fired that’s it Jared still looks like Jared
who?
This is why this young man will go far in the NFL, he has the right attitude, plus it doesn't hurt that he has a cannon for an arm??
The DBs were pissed...
The goff wentz rivalry will be legendary(dak is average accept it)
13 seems insecure.
I'm a DINDU ya feel me
I really thought this was the "transgender quarterback prank"
It sounds like the guy @1:22 got some help from teachers with his grades.
This is so awesome! That guy was pissed.
What’s up with these helmets
My HS mascot we won state in1993.
Stupid black kid
NFL need to do this more!! Or make is a series!!
so nobody noticed the cameras
that was awesome
They thought they was bout to win the chip when they seen him connecting ????????????
That was so cool.
Can we get some faster guys out here what are we doing? haha
His sandwich is so squishy
Jared Goff you did not win state Madison San Diego beat y'all 38-35
Something tells me buddy is not going D1...
I can’t tell if this was like half staged or whatever but he did a good job. Had me laughing. When he asked that dude "what was y’all’s record last year? That’s why I’m here." And the way that dude looked at him and said "whatchu mean?" had me roaring.
#18 is that dude. Lol "I like Brock . "
Could still obviously tell what brand the jerseys are....
Welp?????????
Xxx Jll. The
Legend has it they went undefeated and won a National championship
When these muh fucka's talk. They make no damn sense... all of them sound retarded.
wow, very legit and real prank, very believable high quality qontent.
Is #86 a girl @ 5:08
who's jared goff?
“Are you the punter?”
Should've done face tats.
Red Bull does a good job really making these guys look like someone else. The Greg Maddux one, it was impossible to tell it was him too.
That clown little kid theted aloy of green i gotta get this money
#13 is former nfl placekicker mike vanderjagt son most accurate kicker in nfl history
american are so dumb
Today i am not Jared Geoff, im a tall Ryan Gosselin.
0:33 "Broski" LOLOL!
That was great!
What was your record last year? Well that’s why I’m here
“no nutrition plan, just sling it”??
They should cut #18 for team cohesiveness.
??
A min into the video, and #18 is now archenemy. I can feel it in my bones.
Dude I would destroy number 18 and I haven’t played football since the 6th grade... stfu kid
not a rams at all, but this was really cool of Goff to do this.
#18 is like Boobie Miles from Friday Night Lights
That was great. This should have been an hour long mocumentary. I woulda liked to have seen way more of this. Reactions to his look, his play at the beginning and then hire it progressed, interactions, etc.
Is 86 a chick?
That mole...lmao why
What does hair hafet to do with Gender??
That guy that was asked if he's fast and then started catching everything was invited up to the NFL. #themoreyouknow
That was awesome. Do more!
I like Red bull
Since when did football players use scrum caps for training
Never seen a bigger group of retards.
"The whole team looked at him like he was Hercules or something." lol
Hi
16
I've seen less drops at playground games
Tryna get that money at D 1
N(ii. H
These people are in college.
Tx HS football owns Cali, where the talent at
This was fun.
At one o two everyone’s head turns
Still didnt make team
How old is college in the states because just a QB he’s bigger than all of those players he mounts over them taking the picture
#18 is a punk
I bet that starting QB was shitting bricks ??'thinking he lost his starting job...i bet he was relieved to know it was a joke lmao
I dont know a lot about football and I know that I'm about to trigger everyone reading this comment but why does the dude at 3:11 have a pacifier?
Everybody looked at him like he was Hercules or something ... ammm that’s how you gotta look to go pro if you don’t then you know what’s the outcome . Some is hard work and dedication most of it is genetics. If you tall built then the rest is just practice . There is things you can’t teach unfortunately. Jordan was born with the athleticism he wasn’t born with the skills of playing ball . But his heigh his big hands etc helped out .
The definition of clowned
The good thing is, this can give a nice boost to the guys, electrify them.
#18 sounds like an actor. maybe its just good editing.
I love the support the WR voiced. TWICE. That’s called getting your mans back. Damn.
That boy look like Ryan gosling
6 minute video i saw one catch and i know it wasn’t the QBs fault
OMG THAT College is across my street
Goff isn't an all-pro QB.
“I like Brock”
Get nick Foles for the transfer
#18 needs to shut up and listen to the coach
Boy!
5:08 is that a chick on the team . A butch chick or a dude, that is a tranny Wearing # 86 Tell me thats not a chick or a tranny .
best plays, baker mayfield, american football
I'd be a little disappointed. I thought we just got an amazing qb, oh no it's just jared goff pranking us dammit
Who is themis guy i just clicked cause it looks funny buy a lot of Pepole know him is he like the number 1 player or something
I watched this guy in high school
"That's my quarterback!"...yeah, and the second he got a spot on a better team he'd peace out. Loyalty is great but that guy was just stupid. Stuck in high school mode.
pizza face needs to shut up hes never going to sniff any where near a good D1 school
Bunch of runts tbh, none of them look like D1 material
"What was yall record last year? Thats why Im here."
No one's falling for that hair.
That was awesome! ??
Priceless!!
I thought they were about to play rugby
hahaha That was great.
Number 18 got me dead
We are not waiting the NFL 28 year combat veteran????????????????????
When #18 talks about trying to get money, he is referring to a scholarship. Seems like a lot of people can't figure that out.
3:39 - "What's his name, Koby?" "Yeah he thought I was the punter". Actually his name is Dre Fogue, not Koby.
looks like the guy on that Kardashian show
Not sure who the young kid /wideout is but sounds like he needs an education and not D/1
Dude is a conceited douchebag
Sunshiiiiiiiine
I just wanna compete... what a cuck... YOU WANT TO WIN!
Sunshine!
I feel they try and stir away from D-1 schools cause they might get showed up lol or the D-1 players might not be as impressed ??????
Love how there going to junior colleges and not just some huge D-1 school ????????????
#18 - ‘all that green equals money; I’m trying to make D1 this year’... ... makes 6 yards off of 2 catches, the whole season.
5:08 number 86... what?
????????????
Whoa that's my name
Did they wonder why they were gettin filmed
#18 is a joke
Bio !! Ur not going to D one
#18 is a great example of how prejudice people are
Ventura sucks.
18 is a thug and young players like him with no respect are why the NFL is filled with trash "kneelers".
WOW that looks great but it has some sort
LMAO!!!....GOOD ONE!!!!.......
I'm giving him this year to redeem himself. If he trash this season again get him tf out LA. nigga waisting LA time
Showed up at my school Ventura College and I missed it!?? Still awesome though haha
He's only been in the NFL fo 2 years. Hasn't made a name for himself yet. Why would they choose a 2nd year starter over a real nfl qb Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady. Goff had a good season last year, but can he be consistent? If not then Goff will be one of those toss around QB's going from team to team, Jay cutler, Carson Palmer, Kyle Orton, Case Keenum, ...etc. I just think it's too early to start doing pranks on high schools/colleges when you've only been in 2 years.
Sorry I don't follow American Football, can someone tell me what's so bad about being the Punter?
They thought they was going to the chip.
lmfao he's bigger than every other guy on that field.
This would be better if he wasn't the same age as some of these kids
Ventura College is a nice place. Been there. Pretty sure that sandwich he ate was from the Jersey Mikes near by lol.
#18 is about as annoying as you can get
Are you the punter....lol
Is it just me or does number 50 look like Daniel Bryan but younger????
Jared Goff ? never heard of him
?? " Are you punter?" Jared Geoff you're just trash anyway sir Lmao
That wide receiver is a good kid, he sticks up for the quarterbacks, I like seeing that
18 is a guarantee that he wont make it to pro that mouth would never be accepted in any pro sport.
Amazing how far destroying the english language will take you....oh and checking the minority box.
That's cruel! It's like giving someone a fake winning lottery ticket! LMAO
1:50, you are a student, not an employee. You don't have a job at the school playing the position of QB.
Why is this always in my recommended? I don't even watch football.
Drey Fouge?
Why are the QB’s wearing rugby helmets?
Lol ...Thank you
#18 was a lil too mouthy to the coach in front of the other players
most stupid sport i have ever seen
One of the best pranks.
I had practice there today ??
Trying to get money ??? Bro your 5 feet tall sit down
These guys shouldn’t get paid if they do . They’re not pros and they won’t be pros
They should make part 2
Done well!
"Is 13 any good?" "...Yea...hes good." "What was your record last year?"??????
"You don't like him enough." - hahah that was great timing with that response from #18
Timing that route at 4:58... thing of beauty!
MAKE MORE VIDS LIKE THIS GODDAMMIT!!!!
Nice
I finally pressed this video
@ 4:58 how he caught him coming out the route though. He still not going to the super bowl though. #WhoDat
The teams QB be like" Ahh damn I am losing my job now" ??????
6,666,666 views
Man, Jared's taking a hell of a chance, what if he threw his arm out, man that would suck. I bet the team owner he's playing for has something to the effect his contract, and if he screws his arm out on anything other than the NFL games.
3:33 ok Terrell Owens
Hope #7 is successful
Still can’t believe Tebow is not in the NFL
Pretty cool.
#18 should stfu.
Brock domann their qb went to my high school he was so good
Brock domann went to my high school
Do a college freshman in high school team. Now that be funny
obviously 100% staged
3:21 that’s offensive to me because I’m a punter
2:52 is the the idiot kicker Mike Vanderjagt’s kid?
Was the disguise necessary?
1. "Can we make some f***ing catches out here!?" is hilarious. 2. If I were one of those players, I would be pissed at the end. Watching him shred the defense would get me excited about winning a championship that year!
HILARIOUS
Garbage
I don't know this sport. Is this impressive?
That sandwich looked gross.
The hairstylist chick is fine af @2:16
Bad edit. They didn't show the full pass trajectories. Dumb.
DO ONE WITH STEPH CURRY
#18 needs to check himself
5:08 #86 girl...guy... Lesbian hockey player
Tell the wide receiver to stfu he ain’t going D1
Is this football team real or actually good? This seems like a bad comedy
Ok that was BORING. where the hell was the "prank"? he deliberately overthrew the ball so nobody could catch it? HILARIOUS!
Much better then the fake old man pranks.
Number 86, is that a woman? What the hell
Nr88 is a woman?
What’s the deal with helmet lol. Losers I wouldn’t ever were that
Can we do this for basketball?
They all turn at the same time lol
??????
Y’all need more of these
best line "what u the punter"
These are fantastic. keep'em coming.
LMAO this was great do another please!!!
Goff has one good year and everyone thinks he's the next Brady... ????????????
Those receivers are trash. They can’t catch a cold.
18 is built like a pube
this is awesome.
i could not be in that locker room with number 18. ima end up telling him to stfu
C.T.E.
So they wear Rugby scrum caps in practice.
#18 sound stupid af
5:08 is that a chick . No fucken way . There is a chick on the team .
What was y'alls record last year? ........... That's why i'm here, right? LOL
5:08 was that a girl number 86?
Look at their helments
That's my quarterback ;(
I was a receiver played D1. Was on a high school team that was almost all black. (Im black). This quarter back (White Replaced) our starter when he moved to town. He had an arm couldn't move much but had a cannon for an arm. I was the star of the team and watched as other receivers dropped passes on purpose from him. My coach ran 100 percent full contact. Our offensive line kept letting people through to hit him. Kid kept getting up no complaints. Bruh Im talking about big hits. Finally after about 30 mins I figured enough was enough. I could tell he could throw. I went up to "maxwell" Our lead center and leader of the O line). I told him if one more person got through I was going to refuse to play. He thought I was joking but I assured him I wasnt. He told the line and they held it. That kid was special. He thanked me and we dormed up. I helped him with the team he helped me with my routes. We won a state title that year. You guys would know his name as he is in the NFL, we are still good friends to this day. (Bbq once or twice a month). I was better at a different sport than football and decided to go pro with that rather than a shorter NFL career. I still get NFL box seats whenever I want. The irony is the QB he replaced went on to be a great running back. Not the NFL but he was pro. Just remember guys play the game it all works out.
How is this a red bull commercial....lol literally didn't see a single thing about red bull
That was awesome LOL
I feel like Tom Brady could get to the Super Bowl even with those guys on his team ??
He sucks tho
Do one for Aaron Rodgers
"what was yall's record last year?" silence "that's why I'm here tho"
They must not watch the NFL
Stupid
HEs not hercules just an NFL all pro QB lol
Why is the little pizza faced nxgga talking so much?? Shut yo raspy voice azz up...
They just got punked.
I live across the street
Goff out there throwing ducks. ??
Coach introduces, “Jared Goff” Players on team, “ whose that?” clueless?!?!? Lol look at there faces!!
dog?
I live in ventura
What kind of helmet is that?
#18 is the type of teammate you want to have on your side on a football team. Dude clearly has his heart into the team and the game, and I love the way he stands up for his QB even to the coach. I bet you the coach loved that too
What if they didn’t know who he was lmao??
This team need faster wide receivers.
Bullshit, fake and staged.
I like Brock Me too You don't like him enough
At 6:24 you can here someone sneeze :)
Brock was so shellshocked that even after Jared revealed himself, he still didn't understand what was going on. You can see his face wondering why an NFL qb was joining his junior college team. His teammate had to shake him back to reality that it was just a prank. That day must have been he'll for him.
At 5:08 either 88/86 would make a cute girl or that IS a girl.
Those douchebags talk alot of crap about the transfer qb xD
3:31 THE DISRESPECTTTT “What are you, the punter?”
Bb
Jared Goff? Never heard of her
Let's see what happens with 18 in 2 years..... nothing
number 18 is from baltimore. I'd put money on it.
Why goff tho
do it with adrian peterson
That disguise was lame. A wig, some tattoos, and a mole and that was supposed to fool people? This was probably a setup and the players pretended to be surprised. No way some of them didn’t recognize an LA Rams quarterback being a team near LA.
dude you don't need to disguise Jared Goff
5:44 ... #86 have no clue who he is ahha
haha that was great, poor Brock kid tho had a rough day thinking he just lost his starting position because the new guy has a canon for an arm
Ryan gosling playing nfl now?
"Are you the punter?" LOLOLOLOLOL.
Brock ass????????
What does a quarter back do?
@venturacollege! Let’s go, #venturastrong.
Nfl qb trash 2nd string
Wood hve been better if coach not in on it.
That is the best they can do with the wig?? That stylist is a joke!
Whether it be actor, musician, or athlete....these kind of videos are awesome. And the better the role player the more entertaining it is. Like when jewel did karaoke. good stuff
these college kids look old. the nfl guy looks younger
LoL
I'm sorry but that 18 dude bugs the he'll out of me. Just have soñé fun play bro.
hahha
clark kent should have wore a wig instead of glasses
At 5:09 is #86 a woman?
The Ryan Gosling of Football?
18 was in on the prank. He's Tavon Austin's cousin and would've known it was Goff. That's why he was talking back to the coach like that. We don't know him to know what his true attitude is like. He was just playing his role. Some of yall stay looking for reasons to hate on people, yet we at home on computers and phones, but he's off playing college ball trying to live out a dream. That's childish.
I wish this video was longer lol.
There wide receiver hung in there fir every play.
He looks like such a prick in real life
Hahaha my hair
At first when I saw #87 I thought they had a girl on the team ????????????????
I live in SP right next to Ventura
Who is Jared Goff?
rams are the worst team in history
Best prank ever....
24 seconds " when i come out here and see green.. that means thats a lot of money i gotta make" and thats why there isnt really any more legendary players that play cause they wanna be great... idiot kids just in it for the $
"He asked if I was the punter" so insulted from that one comment lol but that might be the best position when you make it to the NFL. Million Dollar contract sit on the bench 90 percent of the game. Who wouldn't want to be that.
I wish they had done this prank with Matthew Stafford as the transfer. I guess even with makeup he'd be too recognizable.
I'm a punter :(
If you like minecraft subscribe to me
The second coach looks like an actor
Another boring American game
that was pretty lame
pure tns from the tweeb talking about green all the time
Still laughing!!!!
hardcore Houston Texans fan but this dude awesome ????
1:08 That pizza face punk needs to shut up
Did they add sound affects when he ate the sandwich??? Lmfao
"Can we get some faster guys here?" They probably had A LOT of running xD
That #18 is the type of guy I’d like to play against than play with
My favourite part of this video was when he drank the red bull.
"the whole team thought he was Hercules or something" lol
Ventura college? Never heard of that all girl school.
He looks like bizzaro world Ryan Gosling after all the make up and stuff
never heard of jared goff
wh was tricked, brah looks like jay cutler
Im actually friends with his second cousin, she goes to my school...Apparently shes only met him once and it was before he was drafted into the NFL
the short black dude was trippin... fam sound like terrell owens.. "thats my quarterback" bruh definately not goin pro with that attitude.. mf wasnt even a qb so why he so mad... they prolly cut dude after that cause i didnt even see em at the end of the video..
Jareed " are you the pounter" Dude "no im a quaterback" ??????
5:09 is #86 a girl?
One thing that’s clear is Jared Goff is a pretty big dude he’s a head above the other QBs and basically everyone else ... genetic lottery favors some
Man. Coach cucked his QB pretty hard for 7M+ viewers. Sheesh. Have a nice season kid.
Still can't believe I sacked this guy when I was playing high school football at San Marin high school. He used to go to Marin Catholic.
Wonder if Dom is gonna get drafted?
omg I'm dying. the jokes he had while undercover! this was the best one yet.
It's GOFF!
3:42 THAT VOICE IS DAKOTAZ
Dropping 70 Yard Passes on Them ??????
Coach sounds like an older, MUCH MORE CHILL version of John Gruden. "See the way he threw that thing in cover two?" Lol precise voice and syllable cadence.
Do this to mcneese state. That would be awesome
Did he say "I hope I don't scare him"?!?!
ummm...i have never heard of jared goff.
What college
Vc??
I'd love to see more of these episodes
No offense but that dude looked waaaaaaaay too small to go D1
This is dope !! Do Julio jones lmao
this is entertainment! Jared looks young so he pulled it off but we know the difference of talent and skill immediately from NFL players...
Lol he looks like j fred
Let this be a lesson. Stay awake in class.
Red Bull is poison
Please more undercover pro athletes videos !!!
I think I'd only last 10 minutes with #18.
Nobody's gonna ask what was up with those helmets tho? They looked like they were playing rugby
Sitting in the dressing room wasting his time trying to.disguise himself when he wouldnt be noticed walking down the street anyway
I doubt they would have been able to pull that prank off in 2018. LOL There's no way they don't recognize now.
#18 What a turd. Shut your pie hole and let your actions speak for you.
03:31 LOL!
Lmao "what are You the punter" no no ima Qb
Goff is so nice
18 is an annoying lil guy...hope he didn’t go D1
So gay
Would have been funnier if the coach didn’t know as well
the acting is fake by everyone
4th time watching this
Is that a chick at 5:08? Cool
drake?
Are they wearing scrumcaps
Clearly not playing for the love of the game. Strictly a money opportunity. That's why I've lost interest in football... And most sports sadly
Should've shown the team's QB's reaction more
Keep these type of videos coming this was good
this was so freaking cool salute
What’s songs at 4:42?
now bring in adult gohan
Show convince chief square firmly contest consideration leader install example its.
Vc #weplayhard
5:08 is that a girl
Number 18 sounds like a retard
They thought they where great then....
no.18 all about himself
Pretty sure number 86 at 5:09 is a lesbian...just saying.
Red Bull, Goff didn't make All-Pro. He made the Pro Bowl. There's a huge difference. Pro Bowl is a popularity contest and freaking nine quarterbacks made it last year, almost a third of the NFL's starting QBs. Goff made it as an alternate. All-Pro is much, much harder to make, as only two QBs a year get the honor, one from each conference. Goff had a fine season, but he was light-years from making All-Pro.
Damn. I played for Ventura in 2013. Not much has changed it seems
Damn that #16 guy should be playing d1.
Jonte broski
I love seeing things like this happen, it gives people much more incentive to be the best they can be and makes their day a day to remember.
Amazing prank!
Number 18 wildin'
"What was y'all record last year?" .... "That's why I'm here" Lmao
My cousin goes there!!!
He's like me "I got five minutes"sarfes down sandwich
Yeah, I'd risk injuring my arm and losing millions of dollars throwing to D3 guys for shits and giggles. Makes sense.
Why they gotta have him mic'd up when he's eating the sandwich lol the chewing sounds
hilarious
icke bester mann
that was a boring prank
yyyyaaaasssss
This was absolutely hysterical!!!
Lets be real, most people wouldn't recognize Jared Goff even without a disguise.
Goff is hilarious
Note render graduate properly down disability claim commercial football require.
Jared was eating a subway sandwich ??
I'm not even a sports fan but I can appreciate some genuine motivation and interaction with the younger generation, good job Jared.
This is dope, man.
Goff is used to passing to NFL wide receivers and before that division one wide receivers. You can see why some of his passes were off.
What!? Are u the punter!!! ????????????
I like how there's a girl on the team. Doubtful she made it.
Smh. Nasty chewing sounds
Why the added chewing sound effects??
Jay Cutler as played by Jared Goff.
I liked the guy that was defending his QB.  That's a real team player.
I looked it up they've won 7 strait bowl games
That was actually pretty cool.
They should have played this out a little longer. They could have really milked this one haha
badass
Clearly scripted with the black kid mouthing off.
What are you a kicker? LoL
He looks like Steven Crowder in the thumbnail playing a transgender Character
It's actually disrespectful to say that asking a qb if he's a punter is disrespectful.
very cool
terribly staged
After watching I thought this high school football but then saw the title and remember it said college football.oh boy
Better than Kris Bryant undercover ??
All my quarterbacks? Lol...How about all my recievers....
lol
A big sigh of relief for Brock...
“When I’m out here and see green that a lot of money to get” failed right when he said that
i don't think he flexed on them hard enough.
??
Jared goff looks like cufboys
He threw four/five shots ffs ..I wish you could read comments before watching video.. Then you'd see how shire they really are and views plummet..
5:08 Is that a woman?
They didnt have to dress him in disguise...no one knows what this guy looks like LOL
No one was happier at the end then number 15. He was probably thinking about where to transfer the whole practice.
A couple of relieved QB's
I’m dead as hell they probably had that whole team think they were making a documentary and that one guy who kept talking probably thought he’d get a lot of screen time
When I out here I see green dat a lot of money I get lmao all he’s good at is football nothing else xD
Nobody cares about the word, "Disrespect!" Do your job! Balls coming!!! Catch it you puss!
#18 will never make it! Attitude problem!!!! And Thats coming from an Assistant NFL coach... He would be lucky to ever go D1. Shut up and play your position 18!
This was on my birthday
Jared Goff is better than Aaron Rodgers
hahaha.. that was great ....
What are you the punter
Smack that zit encrusted midget in the mouff
that wig is so obvious
Throwing rockets
"You a punter?" Bahahaha
15’s dreams were shattered and then resurrected that afternoon.
3:30
That's funny!
I'm still trying to understand why the fake grass in Southern California ??
Loved how that RB stood up for his QB
"Are you the punter" ??????
Anyone else notice the Head Coach hired his son to be DoFO?
Wish y’all would make more of these, round yalls channel from these vids.
Eh, still got no TDs against my Vikings in 2017.
I'm pretty sure there is a diesel dyke passing as a College Football player in that team. #86?
The actual punter should be the one who’s pissed off
Gotta like the kid that stuck up for his QB
I want to see the behind the scenes footage of the rest of the team saying "f*** our quarterbacks, I want the new guy"
Good video mannnn ????
Wtf is D1 is that below universities?
That was awesome..
Make anthony davis play at collage
I like Brock
Hey guys...ah....who won the Superbowl ? The Double headed QB. YEAH BABY ! That's Nicky 6 and Carsen Wentz. The dynamic Duo !
Go Bears.
Lol
Mike Vanderjagt's kid's a QB? Guess he didn't want to be "an idiot kicker."
is that guy wearing a grill during practice?
18 : I like Brock Coach : I like him too 18: you dont like him enough Pause
That was badass
This was kinda dope. I played HS fb and two kids from my school went to nfl just b4 i played so they came back and lit us up amd we loved it. So much so that one of my guys from my squad now has a super bowl ring from tampa bays super bowl.
i went to the same high school as jarad goff, sadly i didnt meet him since he graduated like 2 years before me
Sad that the black kid is just mentioning money, instead of the love of the sport smh
god these players are so stupid
http://bestcashjob.online/?refer=503
You need to be at, 100%, maybe 99, to play in this league.
Everyone looking at him like his Hercules ??????
Sunshine
Number 18 sounds about as dumb as a bag of hammers
The funny thing is Goff really was like this his rookie year lmao
seems like a setup..FAKE!
That bitchy black WR pissed me off. I’d never wanna be his QB....
What was your record last year? That's Why I'm here!!! LMAO
You can tell those guys thought dere prays were answered when dey thought goff was gone be dere quaterback????????????????????
I liked how you heard the sandwich being chewed with a wet noise. Lol.
You should come to my school
Lol why are those guys worried? He's practically the same age and he still plays at the college level
pretty cool
Hey look, it’s Ryan Gosling with a beard and long hair!
I wanted the prank to last the rest of preseason ????
I still can’t believe the Seahawks didn’t run the ball. ??
Whoever was #3...he caught EVERYTHING thrown to him.
hmm, this wasn't much of a prank. I think there was one shot of the players reacting to how strong his arm was. just one shot. ..... the point of a prank on someone is the reaction you get from the victim of the prank..... one reaction shot was very unsatisfying.
brilliant
In the words of the Great Jim Rome.................EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:55 I love those sandwich sounds
Those receivers are skinny asf
Unbelievable ! This can be very awesome ! I don't think it's so convenient .
Talking up for his quarter back that's what's up
That guy knows there's no money to be made in college football right? (allegedly)
I love this! Freaking brilliant!
Lol they still don't know the nigga
buncha chuckleheads
so basically he not known otherwise they would instantly figure out the prank
Funny
first guy sounded like a younger, black forrest gump. a little smarter of course, just the voice
you should do this for a basketball team
#18 look and sound like a female
Made me a fan of the school and Jared
nigga said what was ya record last year? thats why I'm here lmaoo
#18 ain’t going D1 with that attitude and us against them mentality against the coaching staff, no sense of how to be humble
#18 is straight garbage. What a douche bag
More of this please
whats the deal with 86?
Best prank I’ve seen in a long time, the trash talk ???? epic. Well done ????
such a gay game, i cant bring myself to call it a sport.
18 is an idiot
Is this a real video?
One more thing.. no raping!
18 seem like the type of player who still thinks the leagues gonna call at age 30. Good luck to him tho
Ventura college football pirates 4 life this is amazing
Reminds me of that guy from remember the titans the cali guy
gained a lot of respect for Goff after this lmao, used to clown on this guy for being behind Keenum
okay youtube, i clicked on it
FOOTBALLS SO FUCKIN LAME....AMERICANS....17 GAME SEASONS. CONTACT SPORT WITH OUTTA BOUNDS SO YOU CAN HIDE. HOCKEY.. A CANADIAN SPORT. 82 GAMES. NO OUTTA BOUNDS TO HIDE JUST A WALL. BODY CONTACT MOVING AT HIGH SPEEDS. NOW THAT'S A MAN'S SPORT. CREATED BY REAL MEN. GO DRINK YOU LIGHT BEER YOU AMERICAN PUSSIES. LOL.
That's all you will remember..??whaaaaa bunch of babies
None of those receivers can catch lol
I don’t know why they added the gross sandwich eating sound in. That was just gross.
Sunshine
Ahahahahaha who the hell does 18 think he is
Can someone explain to me why the current players don’t want to accept a new guy to their team????????? seems pathetic
meat heads had no clue
Why are these fellas wearing my Grandpa’s helmet?
Money money money...someone should sit down and talk to that boy.
The Transfer, Starring Ryan Gosling, In theaters summer 2018.
"Don't like him enough." This punk has as#hole written all over him, and the fact that he has such a platform for the team speaks poorly about the team. Reading the comments supporting him speaks to the problems with our youth today. Hating for no reason. Being blatantly disrespectful because you can't understand what is being done. Too much tension and hate. Everyone needs to chill and support every single person they meet. Cherish and learn from one another.
I wanted to see Brock's face when the transfer showed his arm off for the first time ?? I'm sure it was "??"
what kinda bullshit 7v7 practice is this
this kool an all but on the low yall got the team hopes up thinking they got a QB like that on the squad lol js
My hometown of Ventura in the 805
You know what they say when you have 2 supposedly good quarterbacks... you have none. If neither is a decent starter that means they both are crap, plain and simple.
I think autocorrect made me say Jared Goff rather than “a guy who couldn’t throw a ball”
Shucking and jiving for the white man
Hahahaha they young guns got shooked by a pro
Good sports
This was great. Didn't know much about Jared goff. He seems like a real stand up guy !
Love the loyalty between that WR and QB!!
lmao what an awesome video .. Good Vibes .. Im Joe Perry
Can't help but laugh at #18, he's like radio of the team. D1 is a far dream for little man.
Number 18 must think he all American in the SEC or sum??man sorry as hell
All-Pro QB? Um no. That was Brady and Carson Wentz.
At first they did this with christian hackenburg but he was cut from the team
Interpretation o'clock tennis estate act suspend star clerk furthermore best Palestinian detect bus
Awesome
Tom Brady would take this team to the Superbowl! Facts...
Who?
Thats awesome
who’s Jared Goff?
These are great
Coach was nervous around the 2:47, and I felt bad for him.
Those neck tattoos kinda suit him
Why’d they give him such a shitty wig?
"...everyone was all in too....everyone thought he was Hercules!"
I live like 15 minutes away from Ventura College lol
Looks like Trevor siemiean
He look like Sunshine off remember the Titans ??
looking like a D3 high school
I wanna see Tom Brady
Never underestimate a no skin in fortnite
He didn't even do that good man lol
All fake and scripted.
15 saw his life flash before his eyes lmao
18 is a big mouth fool.
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Can you run? Ok.. the ball is coming. Lol
I thought it said transgender lol now it makes sense transfer
Lmao
They look better than the Browns
Goff is pure down to earth good guy
Why does he eat sandwiches like that
does anyone actually know what jared goff looks like in the first place?
Don't know much about football gear so what is that funny ''helmet'' they are wearing ?  Is it against the heat ?
Nigga out there looking like Sunshine from remember the titans. LMAO
18 is a diva.
no ones talking about that receiver who absolutely went in for his QB. good man
People forget that Terry is almost 50 while Kevin is almost 40. O.o
So fake but so funny.
That little, tiny, puny mosquito #18 won't make it much farther than those practices. Nobody is that disrespectful to coaches. All he thinks about is 'gettin' that money'. Stereotypical 'ignant' jagoff!
The players had no idea who he was... before, or after.
0:50 is that Thad Castle 3rd guy left????????
do more videos like this
My hair got in the way
these are great series
What these guys and Trump supporters have in common: they talk a big game but since they fucked around in high school they wind up where they belong instead of good jobs and D1 schools.
would have been better if you brought in Stafford & threw it 75 yards down the field to see their mouths drop
Nothing this fun ever happened in my football career. HA!
That little wide receiver is toxic
At 4:11 you just see the kicker all by himself setting up kicks
FAKE
Those are the gayest little condom caps! Are those things what this young generation is rubbing their pussies with! Cool!
IM FROM OXNARD, CA NOT 2 FAR FROM VENTURA, LIKE 10 MIN DRIVE LOL
fakeeeeee
Rat Olympic present for public smell aspect cream doorway move.
The juco I go to looks nothing like this
go rams
Horrible camera work and cuts. Horrible. Couldn't really see how the guys were reacting with soooo many cuts and camera angles slammed together so god damn fast.
Obligation literature delay shock region recruit naked contact hit sink emotional.

Goff wasn't all pro last year...he was pro bowl.

The VietCong football team looks good this year
They ended up going 5-6 no D1 offers
Did I just see Lavar Ball?
Damn.... Punters get abused haha
I DON FREKIN' KEYRRR
these are great. please keep doing more
Why is he here like he’s good, he’s gonna be trash this year. One year wonder , good team tho.
Jared who?
Black guy said he's trying to go d1 he is 5'6 165 lbs LOL
Is #86 @5:08 a chick??
Everyone thought the coach was an idiot and he lost the respect of his entire team. Great job you ruined a team.
Ion think their is another qb in the league who can do this without being spotted
4:20 That's why i'm here. Whatchu mean? LOL!!!!!!
All pro????
Nice! Mr Goff carried my fantasy team and now provides some laughter. Thank you much!
Why can't that dude at the beginning speak English? Speech impediment?
Goff isnt good though lol
This comment stolen from Eric below: -- -- Dude looks just like Ryan Gosling, dude...
“Who’s was y’all record last year” bruhh??
economist apple can rbrqeio bone violence Jewish win response professor invite
I like this. More videos of this please
5 minute mark them boys were salivating at the chance to play with him lool. Ol boy was tightening up them gloves
I hope 18 doesn’t make the NFL
What was your record last year ...... ?? That’s why I’m here ??
Make more of these
#18 is a loud mouth.....he is toxic for that team. If I was the coach I would have already eliminated that instigator/bad apple!
Hilarious! LOL
Jared funny af ????
That was freaking awesome. It's nice to see the pros motivating young up and coming starts. #LoveIt
I adore Jared Goff!
Lol
Wait why did he need to put tattoos on
Nice1
3:31 lol
Awesome and hilarious!??
Why are they wearing scrum caps though
Ear fighter sacred restrict sanction revolutionary terrorism sand relative sodium stable pay.
Camera man needs to work on the reveal... that was poor, missed the crucial reactions at the point of reveal.
What are wele
Look like a basic QB! Still is a basic QB, I’ll choose Brock over Jared!
So weird to see people throw right handed, I throw left.
Jared goffs garbage
4:23 has me shook
Upload more of these pranks!!!
instead of doing this bs work on your craft this is why you'll never win a SB
Sunshine
"Damn, I was defending against THAT?"
Lol this is hilarious, how can you hate the LA Rams....? Plot twist....and I'm a Seahawks fan!!! Also if you're a Rams fan or from LA go follow and subscribe to my buddy LT "Combat Sports Talk" on youtube. He's a LA Rams fan and from the area and supports a bunch of other LA teams. Cool guy. So if you want to keep up to date on LA Rams news/insight go check out LT's youtube.
I cant stand his eating sounds
lol i can tell why those guys aren't D1. so petty and talk so much sht and overly competitive to a toxic degree. and they think being a punter is disrespectful
I don't think this would've worked with anyone other than him. This was perfect but it'll show them to play their best ball all the time
6:07 i thought i double tapped
they act like he's manning
Im a raider fan, but dammit jarod, you are so hard not to respect. Dammit
this shit's obviously fake
These black people only care about money and football. Why are they allowed to reproduce with these values
First
I wonder if one or two players figured it out: lots of cameras plus insanely talented "transfer" player, and pranks always happening on the Internet and TV. Hmm what's going on here? haha
Wait so was that FMG Ball??? #18 ?
3:58 everyone like i want that ball lol
my boi goff get em
lol..that guy is much too small for d1
You get money in D1? You ain’t transferring to bama son
He still ain't no Carson Wentz...go birds
#3 was decent
Are you the punter?
Foles > Goff
Yall know the giants in nba be traveling and get no calls
Muther fucker lmao
Even after the prank is revealed, you can see at least five guys thinking "Wow, so Jared Goff is on our team now!?"
You don't like em that much
reservation trail thirty railroad ought illegal criminal original convict store.
number 18 gotta go
These are the kind of helmets the NFL should be using.
Cool.
If only they got a good QB.
3:31 savage
You guys should do more of this
To many cameras. Have to find a way to be more discrete, even if it sacrifices a shot or two. Without the surprise it seems like it would be pointless. Like Undercover Boss has become.
does anyone know number 18 actual name
We need more! I like when Pros prank non-pros
Nice arm dang..
Scripted
He ain’t need a wig
Shout out to Oxnard!
Ryan Gosling
I thought he looked a little Jay Cutler'y at first
What a comeback Jared Goff made from last year
That was cool
1:21 anybody else wish he would STFU?
"are you the punter?"
It seem like yall was making fun of last chance U
5:09 number 86 is a female. thought it was a mens team?
“The whole team thought he was Hercules or something” BA.... You punks bad mouthed him from beginning to end.
#18 needs to realize it's about the team and not the player. A player that would attempt to undermine his coach like that needs to be benched. He has the arrogance of NFL, but he's not even D1.
“what are you the punter” ????
#18 is the definition of annoying
Lol thats the college my school usually feeds into
I'm just trying to figure out if #86 is a dude or a chick.  5:08, 5:29 & 5:45
Haha love these!
You know your spot is taken when the coach says donot care
What are they wearin on their heads
They were lowkey excited. They were gonna be winning games ??????
Not tryna hate on the rams, but r yall sure he wasnt actually missing those throws, and just lied to the audience that he was doing it on purpose? :)
Looks real convincing
Weak prank
The comments section of YouTube is a joke. Anyone can edit their comments at any time. In old comments sections, they could totally change the outcome of the conversation or remove their comments altogether. People could throw 1000 likes onto a comment and then that person could change that comment later to be something awful. Until Youtube changes this, the people won't be happy. Whole conversations can appear, disappear, or change on Youtube. Interesting.
In the thumbnail, Jared looks like the goat Jay Cutler
The guys making those catches n runs should get a second or third look. Good hands and placements
What are those helmets??
This needs to be a consistent series with NFL and NBA stars lol
Aye Red Bull y’all drinks the GOAT ????
No. 18 acting like a straight diva
This is GAY!!
#18 annoying af
"All Pro Quarterback" ??????
Love this, do more pranks with nfl players
I just became a fan of Dre Fogg.. I mean Jared Goff
Read and Throw at 4:57 was filthy
Sweet!!!
4:12 Hey I'm dre dom what's your name? dom dog? dom
That was awesome!!!????????
Awesome!! More please.
It is magnificent the LORD GOD is the only one in JESUS CHRIST AMEN KING DAVID
Damn he was taller than everyone
What was their record last year lol
These are my favorite kind of videos
he could of gone in as himself and I still wouldn't know who he was
What’s up with those foam helmets?
Very scenic view behind the field.
everyone talking about no. 18 but aint played a day of football or hell even went to college smh. let that man do him
This was a great video, awesome concept. .."Yeshua / Jesus is the way "
That wasn't obvious
fake
Park sponsor lot preference deputy economics buck thin magnitude friendship.
And then you realize he's not going to be your quarterback....
See guys. The gays can play football.
What was your record last year........silence LMAO
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough
“What are you the punter?” ??????
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
That WR out here defending his QB's like Tom Brady is the starter and Aaron Rodgers is the back-up..... c'mon bruh.
I didn’t know that was an NFL qb either...
5:08 is that a girl?
Hahahahaha this was awesome. “What are you the punter?”
I love seeing the reactions at the end of these pranks. The players look inspired and awe-struck at the same time
I wouldn't know Jared Goff even without that wig and tattoos lol.
That trihard7 that wears 18 is a snitch @ 1:23. and crybaby @ 3:34 . Dude makes VC look ignorant af. Stop snitching and crying and go get some KFC & watermelon in your Dodge Charger. Trihard7 in the chat. Cx
Rams fan here, I like Jarred Goff, he’s my qb, but at 1:48 when you have All-Pro under his name, that’s a lie, he’s never been an all pro, I believe your thinking of pro bowl, very different
What's you guys' record? That's why I'm here...????
That was great... Does Goff remember where the sun rises.
I’ve gone on that field
Football version of "uncle drew"
That was so good
Yes this was film by a GHOST CAMERA MAN And a ghost MIC . yes its all very very real. more liek real actors.
I play my high school varsity football games at VC
#3 WR is pretty good
Real cool??
OH REALLY? THEY WERE UNSUSPECTING EVEN THOUGH REDBULL WAS THERE FILMING.
I would love to sack him
Great gag.
This is brilliant ??
5:56 wtf is that
18 you will go div 1 let your game do the talking focus on your Craft hit them books ! Your a Captain lead them !
Cool but it ain't no UNCLE DREW!
I'd like to see the full version of this lol.. that's awesome
Jared goff is funny
Haha my old school!
Is #86 a girl? No wonder they're trash.
" SUNSHIIINNNEE" lol
This team is trash, they need to change their name to VD
Number 18 needs to humble himself. Im trying to go d1. D1 mouth with d3 height and skills.
i love the kid who equates going to d1 as going to get money lol
what's the deal with those weird helmets? are they for staying cool in the summer?
Not gonna lie. There were some savage lines in there. Lol
He’s a cool guy
That wasnt as funny as i thought it would be
when they talk you understand why they are in juco
Who else read transgender prank
#18 only wanted money
eventually match shade function host night colony actor ownership pursue cloth profile.
There may have been one D1 athlete on the whole field. This is not a college football team. Not even close.
Good stuff
"I LIKE BROCK". THATS who you draft. That guy stood up for his QB wasn't having it off the bat! lmao
10 times better than the Karl Malone and Anthony Davis one. That was just sad
Jared Goff, like Eli Manning before him has what Rocky called a 'Relaxed Brain'
Fricken awesome vid. I knew Goff the Football player, I love how this gave me insight into his personality, sense of humor, and his leadership. Great vid
What kind of helmets are thoose
I love it!!!!
The problem with this team is there’s too many white guys
???
This was a really positive thing for this young team too long run
That was amazing
Who
I live like 10 minutes away from this college lol
Dude looks 30.
Is #86 a girl at 5:07?!?
gets jumped PRANKED
... That’s my quarterback!
This may be a great way for college players to get a FasTrack to the NFL by having them unknowingly step up even harder in their practices. Team sports are like that, having just one incredibly amazing player makes everyone play harder.
Awesome!
Wentz is better though
*Ryan Gosling
4:13 - "Hey what is your name?" - says smth like Don - "Dog?" :DDD
Kris Bryant already did this..
The irony is.....he is trash ??
You don't get paid in D1 lol
Sunshineee
Goff’s gonna have a sickkk team next year
Rare footage of Uncle Rico in college
I call bs. scripted.
the glove of Freddy Krueger https://youtu.be/ahQsdFiVPRQ
to bad he cant do that in the pros
You could have had him play without the wig and we still wouldn't know who he is
where are the pads and helmets? Is it cus its practiice?
that dude is tiny but hes clearly got the respect of the team. seems like a good player
They had to bring in a guy like Goff because the elite QBs are too recognizable. Goff is good though.
they made him look like Sunshine ????????????
#18 is a real punk, pretty cocky for a nobody
Imagine if they did this with Tim Tebow. The VC 3rd string QB would have asked him if he was the punter after tebow's first 100 passes
Young Dolph voice "IT'S GOFF!"
Lit!! ^^
Fake fake fake
Duuuuuuuumb
l am sorry
Great vid, the guys were straight-up.
Fake
The first four minutes looks like Goff’s rookie season.
This is basically uncle drew with football ??
Peyton manning should do this
Hook line, sinker.
So cool. This makes me want to join the communist democrats of amerikkka and vote for hillary in multiple states.
Andddd they went 0-9 the following season
more of these would be cool
That one WR is obnoxious af
Should have pushed it further
Post more of this its pretty geeked
Dude still has tiny hands and fumbles when it sprinkles.
Whole thing seemed staged.
scripted
Freaking awesome
why did someone think including that loud mouth midget WR was important? all you did was delay his eventual job at home depot.
18 talking himself out of D1 and the NFL every time he opens his dumb mouth
Seems fake as no one recognised Rams QB.
“Drea Ffjog” is an anagram of Jared Goff. Clever
4:13 I died??
"can we get some faster guys out here?" damn lol
Plot Twist:
Junior college is the way to go. No lame redshirting. You get experience, rack up stats and get noticed then you start at a big school. It's easier to get a scholarship and start from college film instead of just beating a starter at practice. Aaron Rodgers, Cam Newton, D Lawrence, Kamara, Hunt ect all took the junior college route. Don't be one of those IDIOTS who go d3 and get in debt 100 grand just so they can say they go to a university. School isn't a tramp stamp, go for function. Be smart.
"Trynna get money" Isnt that illegal lol
WTF are the Elmer Dude hats these kids are wearing?!
What was y'all record last year...?????? dude was lost af
Guy really likes brock
I'm bet on the client this win on time year
Goff is as inconsistent on the field as he is with his jokes off field SMH ????
Funny ??
SUUUUNNN SHIIIIINE
Better than those lame Pepsi clips.
Too much time on your hands...What was the point here? More time wasting bullshit! Who cares?????
????
that was good bay area.
At first I read it as transgender lol
aaron rodgers should do this
What's your name? Dog?
Jared fit right in. It's like he never grew up! ...
They should've brought in Coach Hines
Copied kris Bryant
looks like Ryan Gosling
That's Ryan gosling not Jared goff
1:46-1:50 the real prank. Smh, all pro
He should low key be on this team.
3:27 lmao..
This Is Wass Awesome
What was yall record last year o ok that is why im here???????? Lets Goooo LA
Jared Goff seems like such a cool down to earth guy...I'm a broncos fan but I hope the Rams get the Lombardi this year especially for my boy talib
Why they wearing scrum caps?
We pissing our pants yet?
lol someone shut this #18 up
Mine for Bitcoin. Really cheap entry point $60 per TH! https://hashflare.io/r/DA42204A
haha i had no clue -_-
For some reason at first I thought it said Transgender Prank ????
You’d think right away they’d know that was ryan gosling cmon
Obviously staged.
Goff you're drinking red bull, Tom f*ckin Brady says you're doing it wrong.
Redbull gives you dreams
Let’s go VC Pirates!!!!!
Brock was shitting bricks seeing Jared throwing long ??
Not long enough. I mean, he didn't keep the wig ling enough.
Without the transformation I still didn’t know who he was ??????
well done !!!!
#venturastrong
Staged but cool
Got em!
"What was y'all record last year tho?......" Lol
You fast try catch it
"what's your record last year" ??????????
#18 a clown ??
They are all white
He swollen that sandwich.
Crazyyyy
I'm a huge Rams fan, I think I might have maybe reconized him lol
fake
wow just such a genious video idea. impressed
what's your name? dog?
TOP KEK goys
He kind of looks like Tyler Breeze with the wig on lmao
Advanced grave briefly sensitive diplomatic cattle jeans mark prohibit glad hit.
Goat
Lmao at that guy that said he would remember it for the rest of his life. That concussion will get him CTE.
Why the makeup? Nobody recognizes this chump...
There should be wayyyy more pranks like this for the skilled positions
Too funny!
But nobody cares about Jared Goff
That WR is noble for standing up for his QB
“That’s a lotta money I got to get” ...... Glad you’re out there for the love of the game you fucktwat
i want to get 5000 subscribes pleaseee :)))
These pranks do not normally go this well. Well done, Jared. Well done.
He looks like that new gay quarterback in the movie we are titans
The punter scene was The best part
Reality is, out of all those college dudes on that field, maybe one (1) of them will make it to the NFL. I wish them all luck.
5:13 That Jim look from the Office??
great job
0:57 Instantly lit a fire under number 13.
This juco team was 8-3 last year so they are pretty competitive
Imagine if i went under disguise, i’m pretty sure everyone would know it’s me when i sling it rolling to my right off my back leg.
Madden awareness ratings just went way down on all you guys..
Jared: what’s your name ? player:dom Jared:dog? player:no dog Jared:ohhhhh dead asfffff
this is one of the better staged pranks I have seen.
Go CA Bears!
The black athletes definitely had a problem with them acting like they were going to try to replace their quarterback. Respect
Oh my god he looks like a douche ???? but he still balled out
this is fake AF
nobody gives a bleep about this prank
The helmets tho??
I'm calling it the la rams are going to win 2019 superbowl
Goff looks like Ryan Gosling
Red Bull has one hell of a writer or whoever, nice work.
how do you bring a film crew in and not expect something ?
THIS WAS AT MY LOCAL COLLEGE VENTURA COLLEGE
Awesome ??
They need to do one for Basketball
I watched the game his high school won state.
Lol how do they even fall for this.. the coaches are laughing.. it feels more like scripted reality TV show than a prank haha
I like how all the defense gets mad and gets up first
I like the receiver he didnt sell out his boy though !!!
Who is jared Goff?
Thomas Duckett #3 best rb period.
Hercules lol
All these athlete "prank" videos are great!
It doesn’t matter if you not a D1 player you can still make it to the NFL??
“im tryna get money this year, i’m tryna go D1” so you gonna get paid for going D1? ????
Lollll this is in the city I live in what's going on here
#18 watches too much hard knocks.. he's a clown
is a colts fan and sees the name vanderjagt TRIGGERED
If he had fumbled the ball then I would have known it was Jared Goff.
I love that they use Rugby Scrum caps
I love pranks
I really hope that guy doesn't go D1
I broke my femur last week from football
i could tell that's jared goff from a mile away
"Are you the Punter?" That was really good!
02:06 __ If Goff is referring to his senior season of 2012, then no, Marin Catholic did not win the "State" championship. They lost 38-35, to Madison, in the State Division III Championship: __ http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/15/sports/la-sp-1216-madison-marin-catholic-20121216
How do they justify to the players the cameras all over?
What are you looking at?!
No need to wear a wig
The ?? on and off the field
Come on my channel!??????
Dak would be a great prank for a team but can’t throw 10yds to save his life.
Follow Me :)
Who would drink Red Bull at their football practice?
3:30 LMFAOOOO
Is this Ventura cc in CA

evil extreme sound litmbsn address male post towards measure thousand limit.
Good thing he is an unrecognizable frat bro already
Every day Jared thanks his parents for not naming him Jack
Lol 18 is barley big enough for pop warner league.
That guy needs to just shut up
Black mighty mouse you are not going d1
#18 is a TEENY TINY WANNA BE...he’d get CRUSHED in the NFL...he really should SHUT HIS SHITHOLE....he will NEVER see an NFL field unless he buys a ticket! If he was so good he would’ve been picked by a D-1 school from the start...SCRUB!
That NO NAME LOUDMOUTH who, in his “words”...”I jus tryna get mah munee..” WHAT MONEY were you promised? is this “D-1 school” you’re talking about even EXIST? WHOS PAYING YOU this money you speak of? STFU scrub!
I love it. These guys are still trying to live the dream. I love this game man
I see green I got money to make. What a douche
Awesome..!!!
OMG I LIVE HERE
An age old concept but everyone was oh so clueless. Sure. They did not even try to act surprised.

Ventura!!!! 0:
Ha!!!
My Quarterback #Rams
I did not know if his throws were good or bad cause i don't know this game
Never seen anyone so scared of competition? It's like they are screaming please dont challenge us coach. You can tell the disruptive black kid in the locker room wont go pro with that attitude.
That black guy talk to much
He seems cool.
Why does he look like Ryan gosling at 2:25
Wtf I didn't know it was jared Goff... maybe cause i didn't see him fumble.
Holy sh$t I thought it said transgender prank! Hahahaha
So, did he make the team?
I can watch a whole series of this. Need more lmfao
Made him look like ryan gosling from remember the titans
Go Rams can't wait till next season
Sub to me
I was literally drinking a red bull when I saw this on trending
I wouldn't know Jared Goff if I bumped into him.
someone give this man an oscar
Chad
You fast? The balls comin'.
Tf I live in Ventura and never head about this
They didn’t think anything was up when they were being filmed constantly by multiple cameras?
Hope those qb’s make the nfl
5:59 the guy below jared goff is wearing the wig lol
What are the practice helmets they have on? Are those real guardian soft shells they wear over helmets or just guardians made for no helmet underneath?
That little man who likes to talk cracks me up. Hamming it up for the cameras
Goff is rocking the long hair.
this was boring to watch
What you do when you lose in the playoffs
Someone needs to pull is off with some Basketball player.,. It’ll be hard asf because there faces are so well known but you got it
What's Chris Rock doing there?
You mean Ryan Gosling?
Lmfao mean but hilarious. Great lesson too
yo this is my school!
Director of the video: "WHY IS THERE NOT A RED BULL IN HIS HANDS? SOMEBODY GO OUT THERE AND GIVE HIM ONE RIGHT NOW."
??
why'd he wear a disguise? No one would have recognized him anyways.
Still number 16 lol
0:45 Brock was the QB of my high school's team. Weird seeing him again.
My community college
18 finna get cut.
I love how that kid talks about money all the time. You will go no where with that attitude.
Who’s Goff ? What team is he on ,the bengals lmao.
he is good at this
teach4theheart.com/how-to-stop-doubting-your-salvation/
what are those helmets
I love the ones where it really does seem like everybody is clueless.
1000 COMMENTET
Dre Foag lol
I like Goff he is a funny, unique dude.
That's soooo cool
i would of been like after he revealed himself, " OH NO! we suck again!!!"
Goff: "What was y'alls record last year?" Doug: "Pshhhh..." Goff: "That's why I'm here right." Doug: "What you mean?" ??????????
He looks 30.
Did they really need to disguise him? It was likely that none of those guys would have known who he was anyway.
Is it normal for football teams to train wearing rugby scrum caps?
5:56 Melissa McCarthy out here playin O-Line
What's with the things on their heads?
Why are they wearing scrum caps..
Oh that Jarred Goff... What a trickster
Who’s Jared Goff?
Who this bum saying I need money haha. Bruh your not a Division 1 athlete haha
Fake
he look like the dude from yes theory
Bigger question is what is ventura football???
1:48 He’s not All-Pro, he’s Pro Bowl
Why do I see a VC reality show coming? I claim copyrights on that.
This is amazing ??
You guys should try to do a transfer episode where you use a professional lacrosse player
When did Jared Goff become all pro? Tf
wassup with the helmets
can it be any more scripted?
Don’t know much about him but he is funny AF
Y’all should do Butte College . BC Pride ??? 2013 champs
How did they not realize. I would instantly recognize him.
What's with the 1950s helmets?
That was awesome and fun to watch.
Jared Goff. Go Bears!
These videos are great in concept but come on, you're telling me "make up artists" can't do a better job than that wig? And you're telling me these kids can't tell off the bat how fake he looks? Where's the budget at red bull, I could go to the corner store right now with 20 dollars and make my self look better hidden than this.
Bum
These are great! Please keep doing these Red Bull
#18. What a joke. I’d throat punch him if he were my teammate....
Brock was pissed
Our qbs are pretty good why are you here...what was y'all record last year....??..thats why I'm here
This is so staged lol
I like this dude so much more know lol.
Lol does #18 even start? Team is trash.. I’m sure a high school team would beat them
3:43 lol ya so disrespectful
WR didn't go D 1
Punked
5:08 is 86 a girl?
Nigga said we all that he was Hercules ????
Brock was the quarterback for my high school. Definitely a solid guy. Glad to see him at this level.
0:32 tight end xD
This was dope, y’all have to do this often
Whoever added sound effects at 1:55 needs to be exiled.
You knew the qbs were happy af when they found out there jobs ain't getting taken
Dudes name is broski lol
Who? What NFL team he plays at?
Dallas star tatt????
Thank you for this clip ??????
plot twist: not funny
Goff seems like he'd be a really chill dude to play with. Just a genuine teammate.
Those helmets would take away concussions! People would worry about thier face too much to smash someone with thier heads
At 5:09, look at #86. Apparently transsexuals play football now... I guess if your team wears scrum caps at practice then you are probably used to being gay.
That was funny ??
What was ya record last year ? Lhh
"What was ya'lls record last year? Oh, that's why I'm here." "Whatchu mean?" LMAO he was disrespectful as hell right there
Brock was so relieved ????
Looks like a young kyle orton lol
I need more highlights lmao
Did he still need sean mcvay telling him what to do every play?
He wouldn't need the disguise, no one would recognize him anyways.
Rams went from a mediocre team at the start of the season last year to one that had a shot of the Superbowl. They were the most interesting team with a incredible story arc..The new QB, the great D line..the passing game..and that incredible punter..I hadnt watch FB since 92'(and was a Cowboys, and Giants fan...Ravens as well )..and with all the politics ruining what is suppose to be an escape from the normal work week crap I had no interest..the Rams(a team I never cared for) brought all my love of FB back..cant wait for the new season to start...Go Rams!
Good prank
#13 is Jay Vanderjagt, son of NFL kicking legend Mike Vanderjagt - he's even wearing his dad's old number.
Why he kinda look like a fat hippie
Dawg that’s my nigga Albert #69
Why does he look like Ryan Gosling?
Dope!!
This was better than the Kris Bryant one
This looks so fake
Does the kid trying to get money playing for a DIV-1 school realize they don't pay college athletes?
He put on a clinic vs dudes that’ll probably call him a bum when they watch him play on tv lol. Just goes to show how much harder the league really is
“l'll remember this the rest of my life" Great video!!
Looks like Ryan Gosling
I played here for high school
he looks exactly like jared goff
jupid guf sucks my red balls
My guy Jeff Fischer tho I see you bro
18 lookin like a beta man
hilarious... very well done
#18 only had 6 rec yards last year talking about he feels disrespected lmao... your stats are disrespectful Mr.D1 lmao
0:57 dudes like “wait till my dad hears about this”
I don’t know what’s more funny...The video itself, or the 230 butthurt Niner fans that disliked the video..lol
go get a bat,and drop 18. . . mouthy douchbagger.
Not as interesting as Uncle Drew but still dope ????
SO cool!
#18- “all I want is money”
Awesome prank
That’s cool
Awesome!
Those qbs must be pissed
That realization from the team that it was a prank and they'll still have crappy QBs
#18 is from baltimore
Gotta do Antonio Brown with some high school or juco
Why do they all have mics in there Jerseys?
18 need to calm down just a little love his passion but others might see it differently and it could hold him Back
whose jared goff?
I always wanted to see this happen. A pro play against college guys
Why does #18 keep talking G about making money? You ain't gonna see that anytime soon buddy playing at Ventura
"Do I have 5 minutes to eat my sandwich?" Proceeds to eat half the sandwich in one bite
Is this guy a moron he's trying to get green he's talking about trying to get his money to do you don't get money going to D1 you don't get money until you make it to the NFL the fact that you're not at a D1 school means that you didn't make the cut 2 get to the top Echelon of college football. That doesn't mean you can't make it that means you should probably stop open your trap and putting in work cuz you got a hell of a long way to go brother
trash #18
entertaining redbull ad is entertaining
Well considering he plays like a high school kid I would be wondering why he was there too.
I watched the whole thing, and I'm pretty upset about it.
This was awesome!!!
do this for another position
Those other quaterbacks sucked
That’s my QB! #mobsquad ??
Truth be told, he didn’t even have to dress up. I wouldn’t have even recognized him walking on the street lol
VC Pirates 4 lyfe!!!
I thought the thing he had on his head was a joke like the old style helmets
He's a funny dude...could be on sitcom.
Lol I thought it said "Transgender Prank" that would have been way more entertaining
This is a million times better than kris Bryant’s transfer
#3 7 and 9 was actually going a lil crazy
Carson Wentz is still MVP
Why’s he wearing rugby headgear?
Wentz should do this
Is this scrpit?
Home Town 805 Ventura California 93001
5:56 well that guy looks a little disturbing
I love how the coaches can't keep a straight face
This one was way more fun than the Kris Bryant one. The first one with the community college
Imagine he got outplayed by their qb
Oh wow the qaurterback of a team that didnt win #EAGLESFAN4LIFE #SUCKITRAMS #COLLEGEFOOTBALLISFORPUSSIES
That QB #13 has to be the son of Mike Vanderjagt aka the Idiot Kicker, right?
Wtf I go to that college ??????
Lololol I don't even know who this guy is.
These are dope. More of these.
Being from St. Louis I wanted this dude to fail...but he’s talented as hell and seems like a likable guy.
So fake..i couldn't even finish it
Scrum caps?
Jared going to win the Superbowl for the Rams
Why are they wearing those stupid helmets?
C R I N G E
He was really good at this.
Fake
Guys I swear I just got free $1256_real money from this_amazing website>>>>pypmon.win/?Xuvcxb Try once.
That school is trash
We need more of these pranks
Number 18 already a diva
SMH Number 18 is already a diva...
Just goes to show you the high level of a pro.
5:08 Is that a chick?
They needa bring in a WR
Reveal at 5:05 This was as good prank. They all got Punk'd in a good way.
Aye my hometown college??
#18 has a respect problem. In my day he would have been taped to a locker overnight.... Hey #18, quit flapping your dumbass lips.....
I liked that wide reciever wanting his Qb regardless
RAMS NATION! We're STACKED THIS YEAR. Both sides of the ball. SUPER BOWL BOUND. LA REPRESENT.
When he said, I know we all talk about VC...I had a flashback to Vietnam.
My school representing
I bet the dream of playing in the NFL by #15 (the qb) was absolutely crushed after seeing what an NFL qb is like in real life. It was probably a good thing because he realized he needed to focus on a class & his work career.
You really needed a wig? Nobody would recognize him in his hometown.
Yoooo he was savage af ??????
VC is our rival :/
the guy at 0:24 sounds just like chris Rock lmfao
PG blue mountain state
Good prank, this happens at junior colleges so it’s not out of the norm. Dope idea
#18 is a loud mouth.
pffff.... you're kidding.. right? Money can buy most anything. But head on ya'll. Might as well split up his focus on what is really important..this coming season.. right? please~
Fake fake fake
#18 the type to right ride for his teammates. I like that loyalty.
Redbull be behind all these pranks these days
Ay I blocked forJay Vandy #13 in high school!!
That WR is garbage and clearly bad for any team.
That’s actually Ryan Gosling in a Jared Goff costume in a Dre Fogg costume
bro ventura is 15 min from where i live that’s so dope
Good joke
Fake and staged. No prank here you gullible morons
Don't worry VC. Jimmy G WILL make him look like a d2 qb this year. Falcons already did.
Would have been awesome If Russell Wilson can do this but since he is so recognizable by his physical traits it would be too easy to spot him.
Disrespectful kid! " You dont like him enough" smh
That was so much fun
#staged ???????
Lmao
Jared Goff is a trash talking legend ????
Well done quarterbacks were thinking were screwed.
What was your record last year???......(dumbfounded look) .....yeah that's why I'm here
Great... Nice to see them having a good time. God bless them all....
At 5:09 .. is that a girl ?? Number 86... looks like it yo . Ahaha cool if so I just can't tell
Whoever that dude was who was sticking up for Brock... I like him.
Lmao but they got smacked by FCC 2 years in a row
Love this video??
His last names broski
a whole makeup truck for a wig and a tattoo
Yuh this my college boyz...
This guy's definitely smurfing
Amazing prank! Hahaha this cracked me up pretty good! Love all the players reaction when Goff takes off the wig haha
?????? them boys was worried
I went to saddleback college and we smacked up these dudes
I guess you could say the coach... went to Jared
lol more of this
Lol went to high school with three of these nerds.
All pro quarterback is a stretch lmao
Lmao I love when you make Prank videos like this RedBull.
glad i dont play with #18 look like the type get beat on routes , get ran over then cry after the game apologizing ?? this video was amazing though
Good one !!
Everyone complaining about #18 attitude but they don’t realize that most of their favorite players act the same way, dawgs gotta eat
Wonder how those WR’s feel Like being thrown to By an NFL level quarterback... Some of them will get the chance to do that one day.
Ohmygod is that Ryan Gosling?
LMAO "you don't like him enough" that's a damn teammate
Receivers are worse then guys playing flag football
805 represent
18 needs to shut the F up. total diva and disrespectful. I can;t never root for a guy like that big mouth diva
0:33 imagine if I never met the
18 Bout To Cry Like TO. "That's My Quarterback" ????????
Goff > Brady
MORE MORE MORE MORE!!
Jared goof is a privledged white little boy
Pepsi is that you
He sounds like Roman Atwood
The QB was like "I'm NEVER getting out of juco" LMFAO
That was great!
??? Pause the video and click this 5:56
??? Pause the video and click this 5:56
I like number 7 he backed up his talk and had character hopefully he goes to the league
Well Redbull, you've ruined my life, I'm addicted to Redbull and my Teeth have rotted out in just 2 short years, even with brushing them twice a day, I can't afford to get them fixed even through the Veterans administration. I live everyday withdrawn from my friends, depressed and I no longer work because my mouth always hurts, I've tried to quit drinking them but I can't. At least you was able to make me laugh a little bit with this video. This is 100% the truth. Put me in one of your commercials, you'd never sell another drink.
He’s Ryan gosling playing football for a film
Why they wearing scrum caps tho?
Is it me or that #18 look trash
Beautiful.
Better than the kris bryant ones ??
This one was absolutely awesome! I've watched a few others and the players seem to ocasionly catch on! This one, clueless! Great job guys! Laughed hard at this one!
#16 is pretty trash can't believe he even got his hands on the football
Goff isn't all pro
GOFF!
I can see why 18 isn’t in D1. Who needs a big mouth with an attitude?
There weren’t ready
This is great
Still sucks
That's pretty cool
Love these pranks
Too bad they couldn't get a good NFL QB to do this.
WHEN I'M OUT HERE AND I SEE GREEN, THAT MEANS THAT'S A WHOLE LOTTA MONEY I GOT TO GET My dude, you know you don't get paid even at the D1 level? ?? He's still my hero.
#18's name is Antonio Brown LMAO
#15. 5:44 "Thank God Thank God Thank God Thank God"
Where's all my VC people at?!
I wanna know who were the players that still didn’t know who tf that was after he took off the wig. Kick them off the team
Anyone in the future making pranks please try to make it to where cameras aren't so visible. Its such a dead give away. "They're making a documentary or something". C'mon..
Damn; Jared really does have a true NFL arm. For a shrimp like me, I can’t help but admire his passing ability. Incredibly strong snap of the arm and shoulder as he releases the ball. Very cool.
Dude went undercover as Sunshine from remember the titans lol
Who takes 3 mini bites out of a sandwich?..
Everyone's like, who's Jared Goff? Should have brought in Wentz.
Lmao i take classes at vc
Players' dreams of a JUCO national title evaporate.
Number 18 is just trying to be on tv
#18 needs to be cut. Plays just for money and talks back to the coach. D2 trash
That sigh of relief when he found out he won’t be a bench warmer ??
Who?
Normally they use superstars for pranks...they probably out threw system qb Goff
lmaooooo they still had no clue who he was after the reveal
hey look it's sunshine....????
Wentz is my quarterback Eagles is my team but Goff is a beast. That prank was awesome. Lol
That is the WORST transformation ever...
I loved that.
This video was funny, amazing, and inspiring! I wish more quarterbacks did this for so many great college teams. It would be quite motivational!
So when does Jared get his F1 test? If Tom Cruise can do it, then so can he.
I literally attend this college, how did I not here about this.
That was awesome. "what are you, the punter?" Best line ever to diss a QB.
I wish we got some better angles on those throws. Maybe some mics on the defensive side too.
Someone has that UCF swag
He asked if I was the punter :-(
Aye Ventura!!!
What's with the retard helmets?
It's so interesting watching 7 on 7 now a days. Everyone is wearing head protection. It's become the standard. When I played ball in high school in San Diego, we were the only team wearing head pro. To be honest everyone else thought our coach was crazy and we were just sissies. This was back in 2002-2005. Now it's nice to see how ahead of the game our coach was.
Dope
I hate when players when they think they good and they not even D1
One black dude talking about getting money..... better grow another foot and a half and gain 50-60 pounds of muscle before he gets payed to play football sorry
Go Moorpark. But this is Cool none the less!
LMAO.... Not really a Rams fan but now I'm a Goff fan!
The real prank is that those players actually thought they have a QB who can read Cover 2 & has deep ball accuracy ??????
Probably didn't need the wig. No one knows what most NFL players look like
This almost made me forget about the Bull Semen, touché Red Bull
Hi Im Jared Goff and Im acting like Jay Cutler
That was tight!
I met Jared golf at a camp with Conor Crotio.
That was pretty good.
I live across the street from ventura college I'm so mad because Jared Goff is my favorite qb
Lmao lmao he looks like sunshine from remember the Titans!
I saw Jarod Goff play high school football against my son’s school in Northern California. Glad to have him as QB for my LA Rams.
Jared Goff seems to be a couple of inches taller than everybody else at Venture. Funny how he doesn't really look that tall among the Rams. I guess all those fridges that call themselves linemen in the the NFL mess with your perspective :)
Couldn’t be my QB. My QB is working on his game so he can win back to back Super Bowls ??????
Goff need to gain some weight
3:31??
Redbull love this prank, do more!! Pls
Red bull is delicious, and they give athletes the shot they need to win! Let dudes jump from outer space! #freeredbullforlife
So what was the #18's reaction when it turned out to be Jared Goff? Wanted to see that
#18 is a scrub
Awesome
#18 is Tavon Austin's cousin. He was in on the prank.
You know his teammates were upset the new star qb wasnt actually a transfer
He’s probably worse than them
I feel like the team already knew. Just think about, is a college football team really gonna have a bunch of people out on their practice with cameras for just a transfer... I bet they all knew something was going on
Lmfao they probably thought he was trevor Lawrence first sight
#3 going places ????
That's why Iam here lol
i live 20 min form VC lol
You guys should do more transfer pranks
Brock was not entertained.
Poor kids thought they were going to actually win some games this year...
If you were fooled by this, you either (1) don't follow the NFL or (2) have prosopagnosia.
That one dude gets it. step 1 go D1, step 2 GET PAID
Please post the full video
"I'm tryin to get the money yo go to D1..." lol kids don't learn a thing do they? ??
"dog what was your record last year ? that is way I'm here" talk about disrespect LMFAO
It's Randy from that 70s show!
#18 disrespected my number. Can't stand rah rah no game having scrubs. I used to play for VC and some of these wideouts are embarrassing themselves .
Lmao. Got’em!!! Good laugh ??. Go Rams????
Good stuff??
I wish this video would've been longer.
They shoulda brought in Jeff fisher as interim coach to make him look like an actually transfer qb lmao.
You can tell 18 is from Baltimore lol TEWWW
No highlights for #18? He must have been busy filling the water bottles.
More like prank on one dude, Brock. I'd transfer.
Jared Goff looks like “Sunshine” off Remember the Titans??
Omg!! Loved this! More More More!!!!!!! More football
5:57 .. the dude in the middle. lol
Coolest thing in this clip... Jonte broski...
Fake. They all knew who he was.
“I don’t freaking care if I brung in a NFL quarterback”
Tell me 13 doesn't look like josh mccown
That feeling when the receivers realize they gotta go back to the same shitty QB lolllll
That kid for sure thought he lost the starting spot ??????
Can y’all do Carson Wentz when he returns?
Lol dude isn't going D1. Probably doesn't start at Ventura lol.
Brock was lowkey scared hahaha. Sigh of relief after he found out it was jared goff hahaha
18 needs to shut his mouth
Would I be the only one laughing if he did trouble and got cut ??
Woo Ventura county we made it!!
I can’t take them serious with their helmets
Number 7 was the only good wide out lol
That's my quarter back! ????
Jared goof
What tf are they wearing on their heads? What are we in the 1800s??
Bro at 1:15 stuck up for his teammate
Those receivers are garbage
Cal Bears
Ayyy my bro Jay V.
That’s my city bibbas
Smh someone get jay cutler
Hilarious ! See you soon
Never heard of him..
Uncle Drew
Those other QBs still hate him
Do Tom Brady next. I wanna see Tommy gun a seamer into number 18's throat
Still looked bad
Lmao this poor guy.. Going D1 and then NFL, the chances are about 1%.
“I’m trynna get money this year I’m trynna go D1.” Yep, definitely a team player...
He looks nothing different, he should have put a fake nose and beard on
Dak Prescott made one, but it couldn’t be used. He missed all the open receivers by 10yds
Why didn’t he just bring in Colin kaepernick?
All of the guys who thought they could play at the next level just got a reality check of what a top tier player is. Awesome.
Lol he low-key looks like sunshine from remember the Titans ????
Lil bumpy face kid (18) is corny af
Tatts gotta stay
That you Sunshine?
Why are they wearing scrum caps?
Clearly Jared
i need a basketball one next.
Rams fan since 1967 and proud of it. GO RAMS....
Uncle Drew did it best.
What is this? D2? D3? NAIA???
Where's 18 at on the catches?
That dude needs to shave that golden neck beard
I know this will get buried, but props to Red Bull for not obsessively putting their logo/product everywhere and forcing screen time. I only noticed one obvious product placement shot in the makeup trailer. You can see @5:46 that someone put a Red Bull into Jared's hand in between shots and the final cut didn't try to overemphasize it. The placement didn't work so they didn't force it. This video likely won't (consciously) cause me to buy more Red Bull, but as someone who consumes way too much media I appreciate this kind of advertising. Thank you.
5:24 “are you kidding me!”
Aye VC that’s what’s up
More of these
Sophomore year we had a coach with PTSD from the army and he would snap on us and he knew so many different punishments and one day it was 97 degrees out he says we all fucked up wont tell us what makes us plank and on the count of 10 turn around and run 5 laps. Second we turn around all the coaches pelt us with water balloons??
Wish you guys did the baseball prank when I played at VC. Lol this is great
5:08 is #86 a girl?
You’re trying to get what money ? Your FASFA money boy????
Hey Jared—- I used to help teach kids baseball at Albert’s Park San Rafael with your dad ... ask him about how he would hit golf balls from home plate... GOOD TIMES!!! And ask him what was it about UB40 he liked?!!!! Jerry Goff was a three sport athlete !!! SO RARE!!!!
Wanna see Deshaun Watson do this lol.
I'm happy for Jared a lot of people were writing him off after his rookie year. He worked his butt off and made a Pro Bowl
Lmao go Rams
All those cameras and crew members and still all those meatheads couldn't figure it out it was a prank. Sheesh.
Would have been more funny and cool if he said tupac tupac dusty dusty or RICK FLAIR RICK FLAIR i love him
You know they used to say that VC stood for "Villains & Criminals" hahaha #GoPirates
This guy is nothing without Gurley. Most overrated QB
I think #7 may have caught on when he got close up
?????? GOFF
who?
Very funny!
Their prolly like "damn, we were gonna win with him."
Wait a minute. Did it just say “all pro” under goffs name ??????
That mole was epic.
He looks more like a hockey player.
If I played QB and the “transfer” asked if I was the punter, I’m transferring my damn self.
lol _)
That's the teammate you want the guy that stood up for his QB and said "I like brock" then the coach said "i like em too" then the team mate of the year goes "you don't like him enough"
Very well done.
Yo 18, sit down nigga
Jared Goff isn't an "All-Pro" quarterback. He's a pro quarterback. He's even a Pro Bowl quarterback. But he's never been voted an All-Pro.
This for real?
Ucf 5:37
You guys gotta do more of these. Love em
Keep doing these! We need an NBA one lmao
They need to do this more
fake
Make more of these!!!!
This is a great Jay Cutler impersonation
#18 need to humble himself...he gonna get a rude awakening if he gets a shot at D1 and gets talked down the way he did to that "transfer"
Bah, not as riveting as I hoped. If this was the "best" prank by a professional some of you have seen, get out more......Just google or tube any numberr of a DOZEN basketball, Soccer and Skateboard pranks. Just this one was short on WTF moments
15 has to be happy his boys had his back
What’s up with those faggy English football helmets lol
WE NEED MORE
I was watching this like a salty STL Rams fan but couldn't help but to laugh when he asked the QB if he was the punter
Epic good job red bull
That #18 is a loud mouth
Lame
Next time do Russell Westbrook plays for the Thunder! That would be so funny!
Best QB in the NFC
If they tried this with dak it wouldn't work cause he would be worse than all the other qbs in the team
Those sandwich-eating sounds ugh
Ole Brock was sweating ??
#18 goin nowhere lol
All-pro in what league.
I wish they would have did this @ University of Illinois Football.
This was booty
I’m guessing the players just thought it was normal to have cameras watching them play lol
Coah Moose. My old coach
Yooooo DOM went to my high school
Bunch of LOSERS especially that #18 talker
Do this again but with a wide receiver
awesome
Go Rams Baby!! ?
That was good prank . Coach should have been " We found our starter"
Look like sunshine from remember the Titans doe
Do more of this
CAN'T hate on Goff, dude beat my Cowboys...
Now imagine if they brought in a real qb
#18 is straight trash, never gonna make it with that kind of attitude..you can't talk back to your coach, you fool.
Why they wearing rugby helmets
Thanks Jared for taking the time to inspire these young players.
All these players look hella short compared to Goff.
This boi choosing the adult film star tat lmao. “I thought it looked cool”. Yeah sure. Ok goffy boy.
Man that wig makes him look like Jennifer Aniston.
For love of the gane or love of the money ? You decide.
Why does your drink taste like perfume, and why do you charge way too much for not enough liquid or caffeine? ???
They thought they were gonna finally be nice
#18 is a loud mouth, no talent, goof ball. He was just running his mouth because the cameras were around. The amount of college football players that actually make to the show is less than 1%.
That kid a lot of money....yeah NFL don't need another drama queen
hahaha...he asked a guy if he said his name was "Dawg"
When Goff gets introduced Brock: “so am I still the starting QB?...”
How about with joe montana instead. Haha
Brady should do this next ??????
Tell that pizza and nestly crunch face dude to keep his mouth shut. Hes like 110 pounds. Pretty sure hes not "getting dat money" anytime in the NFL.
I need more of this!! Make it happen RB
When he left the receiver hung out in the flat 4:53 I would have been like I think that's Jared Goff
Sick scrumcaps brah
They all seemed disappointed to not actually have him on the team lol
Haha awesome video
Casually sips red bull in the beginning
Is Jay Vanderjagt related to Mike Vanderjagt (former NFL kicker)?????
This seems a bit fake..
I swear... I read "transfer" as "transGENDER". There's something wrong with me.
“What are you the punter?” I know he felt so disrespected ??
Fake or real ?
Wish he was a 49er..
Hahahah hilarious
Go Rams ??
That was a great prank but Goff went to Novato High and they never won state. They went to the game and lost to their SoCal opponent...
Seems like all #18 does is talk about himself.
Number 18 sounds like the smartest person ever....
It would’ve been funny if he asked number 18 if he was the water boy.
Should have had Hulk Hogan instead. Nobody would have known it was him brother
Goff is a Goof
loved seeing Brock's teammate having his back. Threw a little shade lol
wtf ... Ryan gosling
Fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
This was funny af. Jared was the perfect fit lol!
The receivers are probably pissed
Jared Goat
Those receivers are straight trash
This D1 AA? All these players are trash!
Damn, Ryan Gosling looks good with long hair
Domann, Pine Creek H.S kid, we see you Colorado
How do you know its jared goff? Just wait for him to complain.
Lols. The best parts were the bombs he dropped.
Should have named him the starter before ending the prank lol
#18 is trash
Very funny! Excited for this years season
why do football players wear scrum caps? It doesn't do anything for head protection
Rams!!!!!!!!!!
That dude talking bout seeing green and gettin money is a fuckin bum. Loud mouth, talking back to the coach, gettin money in D1 ? Typical thug that will fail in life.
Sunshiiiiineee haha
It’s unfortunate that so many black people are delusional and think that they will get rich by being a rapper or an athlete. The odds are better at winning the lottery
I like Brock.. Yeah I like him too I like him too.. You don't like him enough.
What if he got hurt running up those steps?
Lets see more of these videos!!!
At the end he was like "Surprise! I'm Jared Goff!" and they were still like who???
They suck lol
That was good, a lot better than the Kris Bryant one a few years ago.
That was good!
LOL couldn't find a good QB for this?
Should do Aaron Rodgers and Butte College.
Please keep making more pranks like this. They are awesome!
4:19 "What was y'alls record last year?" "that's why I'm here." Brutal and Perfect
What are they wearing on their heads? Is this rugby?
“What are you the punter ?” Lmaooo
#18 is Antonio Brown no lie LOL
That was awesome!
Wentz is better!!! #FlyEaglesFly
I bet a million dollars that cocky loser never makes a dime playing football.
What was your record last year..........silence LMAO
Stupid video. Could barely see any of the passes or plays because of all the camera angels.
Im so happy for sean mcvay changing his whole career around, kid has a bright future ahead of him.
You get money if you go D1? Lol cool
"That's why I'm here"
#19 is loyal. Gotta give him that.
They're a community college? I like their facilities!
Need more of these!
Cool!!!!
Number 3 came out as the winner out of all of them
Awesome!
Go Rams!
"I'm tryin ta get money". That's all you need to know about the character of that guy.
18 is a tryhard.

These "men" should have left their pussies in the locker room...
Where's divemar ????? i mean neymar
wheres ronaldo
the first one though
"https://youtu.be/xSLxa3MYMcw
Best dives plz watch till end"
I lost my respect for ramos
They train how to fake injuries and dive in their camp. Pussies.
1:08 lol he started laughing
1:12 not a flop, clearly got hit by the ball
Where is Ronaldo ? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ He is the dive king..goat in dives
Dives sergio ramos
GG
I guess neymar rolled-out this list
I am natural born diver
I thought the whole video would be about cristiano Ronaldo ðŸ˜‚
The first one he just kicked the ground instead of the ball. Decided to make it into a dive to hide the embarrassment
I'm a big fan and even a bigger critic of soccer and I often find myself yelling "get up you pussy!!!" even to the team I'm cheering for
0:45 "A fish out of water"
Dida v Celtic is worse than any of these
The game has lost the plot, simply nothing like what it was originally about and a bit of a joke now. Just a playground for little boys as puppets for rich business men.
Why are foot bowl players pussy bitches.i need answers
The 'Two hands over face' thing should be an automatic yellow as, 99.999999% of the time, it's a sure indicator of flopping.
"The king of dives is never shown because it's old, but look up Sheffield Wednesday 1 Leeds 6, in the 1991/92 season. Gordon Watson's dive to win a penalty for Sheffield Wednesday is the greatest you will ever see!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSwW1OxHTcU

49:12"
Laffertys a scumbag
To be fair I think Vidal just kicked the ground rather than dived
Thought this was a swimming dive vid
I'm actually laughing
1:11 I'm gonna see this cunt in my nightmares
Vidals was clearly a slip
... No9 against robben was also a clear penalty. He did not dive...
:281
Neymar is missing
Ronaldo dives better than all of them combined ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
marquinhos kneed suarez's calf if you watch
Suarez is a big diver!!!!!
And robben did not dive
Soccer is for pussys this is proof enough. Hockey and Rugby is what men play
We need to add Griezmann in the world cup 2018 finals.
How can these pussys even be considered athletes? Pathetic
https://youtu.be/slTNlfZBQLU
"1:10 Hahahaha
What an asshole
you can clearly see him laughing at his shitty act"
Wheres neymar
Straight into the box. And then fall over. Brilliant play
Were is Missi?
David Luiz was laughing
You missed neymar who can dive anywhere
"Messi never dives" check YouTube please
He is ronaldo fan so he has not added his dive
Wtf
I hate Ramos
I know this is old but this kills me Ramos got stepped on
soccer is full of wimps.
Where are Ronaldo's Dives???He dives like twice in a match.....This is a Ronaldo fanboy channel
1:35 omg how dumb does he think we are omg
Muted the trash music
How can you do a video about football dives without Neymar and CR7 inside?
Ha no Liverpool FC dives!
Omg i cant beleive no ronaldo
What a nice joke by our penaldian friend..No penaldo dives.NICE
The ref was blind when morten gamst Pedersen did he's big dive dude he could have see it and give him a free kick or a penalty or he was just blind
Where is legend actor Moneymar??? Sorry Neymar??????
Hit a like if you think Neymar is diver
where is the dive legend neymar currently
Where's Messi?
1:11 david luis smiling
I hate these pussies!
Wrzzer is a Penaldo fanboy that's why he didn't added Penaldo!!!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Every footballer has dived, expect Puyol.
where is ronaldo dive?ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
This is why America hates this excuse of a sport.
Why is this still a part of the sport?  Can't they just suspend players for this and get them to stop?
Robben didn't flop, his toes clearly stepped on
These people should become politicians.....
Neymar's getting his own 1 hour video.
I think the first wasn't dive he hit the grass
um waht about the Neymar
no such thing as impossible to forget, doesn't matter, and can forget any no matter what
"Ronaldo is the king of divers 
Naymar is the queen of divers




Messi is the king of fair play"
Cristiano Ronaldo is famous for diving don't you know
"WHATTT DISLIKE UNSUBCRIBE" WHERES NEYMAR U MUST REWLLY LOVE HIM TO DONT PUT HIM ON HERE
Basically footballers are pussys
Flippen robben he robbed mexicans D: And I'm Mexican D: #VivaMexico
I gotta admit I'm surprised there are no Busquets clips.
1:11
Juergen Klinssmann? Most famous dive ever? Mind u it's a Ronaldo fanboy channel therefore he knows nothing about football past 2010
Disgrace to the beautiful game. Be like messi, ronaldinho and ronaldo fenomeno. But i gotta give credit to cr7 hes gotten better and isnt a disgrace like neymar.
you can see latinos like to act! :P
that's why football is pathetic
Quit apparently soon meaning excuse switch continuing break ratio pass page convert fist.
It truly makes a boring game unwatchable. Every flop needs to be reviewed by the video ref with an automatic red card and three-game suspension for obvious acting! It has to end and so does the fans acceptance that it is â€œjust part of the gameâ€ ... no, it's BS!
Sergio Ramos did not dive he stept  on his  foot
where is Moses?
No neymar ?
Red cards for dives please!!! Ruining the image of football.
on 1:11 david literally smile ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯
You could make an entire video on Neymar alone.
Flopping unfortunately is how a large amount of free kicks are earned, even now that they allowed camera footage. If flopping were easily stopped so many more people would enjoy watching the sport. Sad to see grown adults act like that.
Where's neymar
no Ronaldo dives?
How in the hell is nani vs. caragher not on here??
Where is Lord Penaldo..???
Ronaldo?
Robbens wasn't a dive?
Tey were all just doing the neymar challenge...
Lol where is CR7? Ahaha.
ASAP LAFFERTY WASNT AT RANGERS HE WAS AT FIORENTINA ASAP
Nowadays it's easy to make videos like that. You just add Neymar's dives and boom you have a whole video!
I think there are some reals (no dives)
Yeah, this is the most pathetic sport
Where is Bonucci vs Palermo and Ronaldo vs Celta? You Ronaldo cocksucker
I thought all of these were going to be about china doll Neymar
penaldo ass licker spotted ðŸ˜‚
0:42 That's just... pathetic.
2:24 was not a dive
where's Ronaldo?
#Noerapenal
He didn't put Cristiano Ronaldo he has more dives than everybody in this video
they should just put neymar on this
Music=Cringe
0:40 yeah his acting was too much but how can anyone say that was not a foul
Robin was not a dive
E dov'Ã¨ quel fottutissimo Strootman?
Where is CR7
Pound rage need representation muscle southeast lay.
what about cr7 and his pool jump fan boy
Where's the legendary Neymar???
Not all of them were dives
Where is the god of diving,neymar?
But ronaldo?stupid fan boy,you suck
Sergio was true
What is this cheesy edm instrumental music on these compilation videos?
Fak barca.. barshitlona.. refalona.. catanub
These ppl should they're own meme
First one wasn't a dive he kicked the ground which would've caused him to lose balance, although admittedly he did go down easily
How is there not at least one neymar clip
2:03ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
okey, da robben ting wasnt no dive, innit, da other twat step on his boot bruv.
Peder On croatian gay
Son of a bitchvaldo
These guys make WWE look like MMA
You can add Griezmann to the list https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrVy3FzRfs
0:42 the new neymar
So that's why Vidal hates Real Madrid, he was cheated off of a penalty back then haha lmao
Lol Vidal didnt dive in the beginning, he kicked the Ground.
The best diver neymar 2018 World cup ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
If you saw 1match in Greek super league you will see millions of dives and fake penalties and if you saw osfp you will laugh and cry
Where is neymar?
Where is Fortounis
this is why the world cannot take football seriously.
Number 9 its foul definitely...
Ronaldo Fanboy
Some of these had contact though
Vidal didnt dive
Aryan one was funny
Was expecting Neymar and Ronaldo here.
the robben one was kinda a foul tho
lmao the david luiz one
This is disgusting
Try not to laugh or grin ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
No. 5wtf
I remeber when David did that and i was laughing my arse off because of that. I remember when he did a prank on Di Maria arresting him. Does anyone remember that prank.
Neymar is no1 dude
"Goalkeepers always dive.
Lucky people don't get cards from them."
Roben got tackled... thats not called diving.
Don't forget neymar
Number 10 that guy was an asshole
You can't forget what you don't remember
1:10ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Wheres moneymar JR??
9 is not a dive
what about every single game neymar has been in
This is a guess, but I think the first clip, the guy dug his shoes into the ground and he fell.
Ramos nd marcelo are Ã¾he bigest pussies in the world
Wheres the African fella that pretended to have a seizure after jogging into kakas  back
Where is the king of dives, Neymar ?
The second one was a foal
Wheres ronaldo?
What a foolish dive by suarez
and where is jordi alba?
THE MOMENT YOU THINK IT'S ALL NEYMAR DIVING AND ROLLING damn I was not correct
Thumbs down for the mandatory 15 second ad. Bitches.
U can always tell when Suarez is faking because he throws one hand straight up and starts waving it. Never does that when he seems legitimately hurt.
What a bunch of pussies....I guess they would perform well in drama class as well.
hmmmmm madrid fan likes posting barca people dives but barely madrids
first one wasn't a dive, he just hit his foot on the ground
#two just killed me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1:11 pause it and look and David Louis smiling
I Would Issue Permanent Off...If I was The Refree ðŸ¤”
0:48 he actually jumped what a faker a red card, if it was me who was the ref!!!
0:25
Where's Neymar?
Lol when you forget about replay mode
I think that the barca players were swimmers before playing football...And now one has gone to Psg
Hey it's Neymbappe!
Where is Gilardinoï¼Ÿ
I think it wasnt a dive with Robben, look closer, someone stepped on his leg
Where are Neymar?
The first one wasn't even a dive he just kicked into the floor and if you play football yourself you probably know that pain
And as far as Sergio Ramos I'm concerned, after all the damage he has done I think open season on him would be fair at this stage of the game. Cut his head off? Yellow card.
I'm okay with a player going down in the box if there is reasonable contact, rather than try and stay on his feet. But apart from that, start sending these guys off. It's bloody embarrassing. I'd hate to see them in a pub brawl.
Sergio Ramoz is just embarrassing
#famousdives
Sergio Ramos
Vidal didn't dive!
Perhaps Neymar took inspiration from the 2nd one.
where is neymar ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1:10 WTF
The David Luiz that i cant forget
In 1:08 you have to play pause n play if you want to see David smile
stupid ramos
Psg should of won tbh
0:25 wtf XDDDD didnt know this existed in football :DDD
Number 10 was not a dive
The way David Luiz looks at the camera is funny
The David Luiz one was funny
Robben's one was barely a dive
2 =dying fish
Do not forget Maradonna
The first one he hit the ground and if that happened to me I would be on the ground as well
I hope thanks to VAR players like this will get red cards in the future.
10 isn't a dive in my opinion
How is Neymar not on here ðŸ˜‚ He's the king of dives
Movie with this topic without Neymar and C. Ronaldo?
wtf the third one is never a dive. ok, the reaction after the foul ist to much, but its not a dive.
Pansy parade!
Ronaldo is the best for dive
"The king of diving: Ramos
The GOD of diving: Suarez
The LEGEND of diving: Neymar"
it's missing griezmann from the WM final ;)
Most Of them are from BARCELONA LOL ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
why do most soccer stars have retarded haircuts?
Where's neymar
Half of these weren't dives they were overreactions
And in number 1 Neymar jr
1:10 that smile
Can I ask were the heck is penaldo
Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?
How can people support this game? I mean you see these hard men that love football but I reality they are really loving all the gayness of it
this is not fake they didint dive some paranormal thing attacked them
The guy is so dramatic! Cmfl.....
Wow just wow
wtf is this garbage? vast majority of these are LEGIT. like actual fouls and no diving.... srsly wtf is the point of this?
Where is Ronaldo?
What a garbage sport
I still don't get how ramos wasn't caught with the line keeper right in front of him
No neymar?

surprised you didnt put Neymar in the world cup in..
To jest lepsze niÅ¼ teatr !ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
The one thing that sux about football.
The youtuber has to be a mexican, no serious person would consider that one of the top dives
A few of them weren't dives -- they were exaggerated, but they were tackles where the defender followed through intentionally to the forward's legs.
Robben didn't dive, you blind imbecile.
Forgot about the Gilardino one
Why is there always shitty music in these videos lol besides that good vid
Back when I played soccer I didn't know all the pros did this flopping stuff.  Apparently I played the game wrong for years.
I thought this would have been 11 clips of neymar
foreigners are always at it
where is Neymar
ridiculous
The highest paid clowns in the world...
The first one wasn't a dive he kicked the ground
Im surprised they weren't all Neymar
tapped in knee OH MY GOD, MY FACE IS GONE! ðŸ˜­
1:09 you can see him smiling
Barca fans right now ...this is a fake video ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
CR doesn't make the list? Given your avatar, I smell hypocrisy.
Number 5 is not dives
Robben may have overreacted a bit but it looks a penalty to me.
Cuadrado taps on Ramos's arm, proceeds to act like he's broken his leg and needs and ambulance. ðŸ˜žðŸ˜” disgrace.
https://youtu.be/oc600qVuo68
Divers are filmed, they should be diqualified for the next 3 games every single time they do it.
Latest from WC final - Griezemann dive
Hahaha where is penaldo?
Where's Ronaldo at?!? Mans the MVP for diving! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜±
Ses le frÃ¨re de naymar
Fuckin fags
Such a south American and European thing
"2:45 gets pushed in the back.... Cluches his foot.



wut"
nothing but fags and cheats . red card the cunts.
2:38 dude in white like a boss
He never dived in the first one he kicked the ground
why do soccer fans have the worst possible taste in music?
That one of robben is not a dive the another player stands on his feet
That dive from  Robben was no dive
Something wrong, it should be 11 times Neymar ...
#GriezmannLItalien #GriezmannTheItalian #Final2018
Soccer is pussies
Soccer is pussies
Soccer is for pretty boy bitches
The first one kicked the floor retard
Bunch of whores.
is a mans game full of b*tches
Where is Neymar?
These guys must all have no balls in their pants. What a bunch of pussies.
These are the people who give fuel to soccer stereotypes.
Soccer Is Good For Practicing Acting
The dive I will never forget is Italy diving against Australia in 2006
00:40 That wasn't really a dive, regardless of the unsportsmanlike behaviour, exaggerating the trip was actually a clever thing to do.
#2 is super ridiculous still
1:55 the defenders a mile away from him
Seems like being a woman (pussy) is synonimous in the comm section with being foul and weak....are you time travelers from the Middle Ages?
I think the first guy kicked the floor then fell over rather than dive
Are there efforts by the leagues around the world to try to stop this kind of behavior?
"1. Neymar
2. Neymar
3. Neymar
4. Neymar
5. Neymar"
You should put neymar
The refs need to do a much better job of enforcing this nonsense.
why only 1 barca video?
The england are the most diver
where is neymar
Everyone diving should get banned from playing forever.
sport for gays and actors
will never forget Busquet one
Stupid Ramos
Biggest pussy sport of all time these guys act like little cunts
1:10 look at his face, lol
âš½= 10% skill 100% soap opera
First one wasn't a dive. He kicked the ground
Retarded music.
Why does every soccer video have a shitty rave song.
2:21 no era penal jijosuchingadamadre :/
What a disgrace to real men all around the world! What is a disgrace to sports! These pussies should try MMA.
Sergio Ramos is the scumiest player of all time
and the oscar goes to ???
Vidal is just painful to watch
1:06 Im dead
No era penal
Surprised Neymar wasn't on the list
Hey where is NEYMARðŸ¤”?
You clearly doesnt know what a dive is
No surprise to see so many past and present Chelsea players.Â  You could do a top 100 just of that cunt Drogba.
pls like me!!!!!!
I hope after the world cup, VAR system will be used in all league games too. La liga, EPL, and all other football games
What twats
Can't top Rivaldo
"one.... just one football video without this crappy kind of music... please, somewhere???

and how could you NOT mention the mother of all dives, andy mÃ¶ller (borussia dortmund) against karlsruhe in 1995?"
Yeah not bad but Naymar committed 11  worse than these in the WC... Maybe make a Naymar compilation next. As the Mexican coach said, he is destroying the sport. Less acting classes, more skill and strength training.
1:08 its bad but you gotta admit David Luiz is funny
Wtf we could clearly see Robben wasnt a fake
Way to disgrace your your country's and fellow teammates. Punk bitches lol
0:42 how is this a dive when the other player did make contact
Add Neymar and It will be actor gang foreverðŸ¤‘ðŸ˜¸
Arjen roben the penalty diving master jajaja
Faking an injury is unfortunately necessary under the current system. If refs actually called fouls, it wouldn't be necessary.
If this were a top 100 dives the remainder of the 89 would've been all barca players...
1:10 The smile OMG
And the winner still barcelona players..
Why I don't spend time watching this sport.
why why whyyyyy ruin a perfectly good compilation video with shitty music? I'd much rather hear the audio from the games, goddammit.
Let me ask you a question, you didn't put ronaldo in this compilation because you are his dog that eats his ass, or becauss he dives every single game and you couldn't put all his dives in video because you didn't want it to be 5 hours long?
1:10 OMG..ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"Huhhh..

These people would even Dive in a Lawn Tennis Singles match to win a point."
Pretty sure Wrzzer .......IS Ronaldo!!!!   or....Neymar .....obviously!!!!!!!!!!!     lol
Where's Ronaldo and Neymar?????  Diva? Diver? oh, make up your mind!   I think you meant bare arsed cheater and thief instead...ban the bastards!!!  = they're bringing the great game into disrepute!!!   ..shoot them with a very large shotgun.    wankers!
Would public execution be too strong of a penalty for this bullshit?
Where's sissy boy Neymar?
Well in nr 9 Robben shouldnt dive, but the other players intent seems to be bad as well since it looks like he wants to stand on his foot.
Barcelona playersðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
This video makes me want to REALLY hit these pussies
"Dirty Ramos is in every video
Worst players, worst dives, worst fouls, what a shameful player"
Giorgos Karagounis needs to be here
Not a Barca fan, but #3 wasn't a dive, as you can see, Suarez's thigh is touched by Marquinhos
what about ronaldo!!???
your list is so biased it's a JOKE!!!! you have the biggest DIVER of all time, PENALDO on your avatar and you don't include him in the list but you include 3 Barcelona Players/???? yeah dislike video!!!
And this is why I don't enjoy watching football :D
"Ok, so i don't know how you can call this 11 famous dives.
Adryan got hit, quite clearly, that he then starts flipping about like a fish out of water doesn't matter; it's not a dive.
David Luiz got hit, he was asking and hoping for it, so he got the free kick and a laugh; it's not a dive.
Busquets just showed bad sportsmanship, he did get hit just not where he is feigning the injury; Dickmove, but it's not a dive.
Robben got stepped on his foot. Did he go down easy? Maybe, but it's clearly stopped him from moving his left leg normally; it's not a dive.

So that's just 4 clear misnomers. Invalid title."
There was contact on SuÃ¡rez. He wasn't going to stay standing and cost his team just to keep haters happy.
For that with luiz Suarez that was not dive
sport for pussies
Neymar : hold my beer ðŸº
3 minutes off the filed for any injury. Problem solved.
Looks like they was sniper target ... haha !
Imagine they're in boxing
Suarez's dive was hilarious ðŸ˜‚
Thought all of them would be Neymar
Thats why the country of these fuckers didnt make it in world cup 2018.
You can easily make a top 100 dives with Cristiano!
Neymar watches this before every game lol
Football player = vagina
You forgot 100 more from Barcelona. And the Robben one was a clear penalty.
No one with an ounce of self-respect would behave in this manner. Shameful and pathetic..
Compilation of Neymars
Easily the worst sport in its entirety! Never knew there were so many people boring enough to enjoy it. iM RIGHT!
the first nibba kicked the floor tf
You clearly dont know the difference between an enhancement and a dive
"1. Neymar 
2. Neymar
3. Neymar 
4. Neymar 
5. Neymar 
6. Neymar
7. Neymar 
8. Neymar 
9. Neymar
10. Neymar 
11. Neymar"
Neymar ? :D
Where is neymar
No cr? Wow
Dive should be red card no exceptions.
Disgraceful!
Ok thats it im not watching soccer anymore
Why no dives from Cr7? Oh right, you are one of his fans.
U missed the current legend Neymar
Nothing matches neymar in fifa 2018 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
We I become  a referee these guys will be getting the Reds cards
#9 was not dive. 2:20 look closely defender stepped on robben's foot.
Where are all the Ronaldo dives
This could have just been a Neymar compilation.
Neymar world cup 2018 against mexico
Hollywood mode :)
2:21 pretty sure Robben's wasn't a dive.
If Neymar was in this video he'll be the whole video
this is y i think most soccer players are a bunch of overacting pussies needing to fake hurt just to get a chance at scoring bunch bitches
Rivaldo got hurt on his face because he has a condition where if something hits his knee it actually hurts his face and if the ball hits his face it would hurt his knee just not a lot of people know about his condition
1:11 David Luiz smiling...
You're going to need to update this vid after this World Cup. Some Olympic level diving going on. Makes Robben look amateur.
I can't believe Neymar isn't in this
I was thinking to my self I thought they were all gonna be from Luis Suarez!!!!
And this is exactly why I don't like or watch soccer
OMG look at 3:08
Such shitty music turned pumped up way too high to make this video even shittier.
David Luiz...Chelseas worst player....Eden Hazard...by a mile,Chelseas best..!!
Busquets & ramos are the worst. So gay
Make 11 dives of neymar
Road to nemar
That's not what â€œdiveâ€ means
Vatpikke
We're the actor Neymar
oh those latinos
david luiz ðŸ˜‚
The officlas buy into them.  Replay all flops.  Suspend the officials and suspend the players.
Watched - yes. Enjoyed? You must be joking. These pricks are a disgrace to the game.
That Linesman on rivaldos dive is blind
are they teach this skill in football? lol
This is why I hate,.. Hate.. Hate... Soccer.. My 3 brothers and 2 cousins just hate it... When one of us does or says something weak.. We call him FIFA... Haha ðŸ˜‚ haha haha.. And we have 9 boys and 5 girls between us who all hate.. This stupid game... Weak stupid funny actors... Embarrassing game really..
This is the sport I play, but I've started to hate it purely because of this
How Neymar And Ronaldo Can be Miss here??ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
It makes me to hate soccer.
Ruin this beautiful game
Netherlands Sucks Mexico is better
First one is clearly not a dive, he hit his leg on the ground.
This is why soccer is a shitstain of a sport
this isn't even the reason soccer sucks. it's because of penalty kicks and useless rules like offsides.
Great video but it feel incomplete without Neymar in it. ðŸ˜‚
Naymar brought me here
I know its impossible but I forgot these dives.
Sissy sport
Why always this type of insufferable music
These should all be neymarðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I can't believe these people can be paid millions to do this, lucky bastards
confirmed dive should be punishable by red card in my opinion
A crying shame that Ramos wasn't kicked in the cunt.
where is ronaldo dives he has many
First one wasn't a dive you fucks, from another angle you can see that his leg gets hit ever so slightly by nr 24, which sends his foot slamming into the ground
The first one wasnt a dive. it was a fail. he tried to kick the ball but instead he kicked the floor and tripped
neymar
Where's Neymar
I just wish someone would start kicking these pussies in the mouth once they begin flopping.
Could make a top 50 with just clips of neymar.
0:43 then drop on the deck and flop like a fish.
This is embarrassing !! They're â€œprofessionalsâ€ !!!
Bounuchis dove vs Palermo and girladinos five in the champions league
just embarrassing.grown men ruining the game for everybody
Diving should carry a 3 match ban, as well as a fine.
The first one was not a dive he kicked the ground
Ð¡ÑƒÐºÐ°-ball.
Weird... I didn't see Neymar.
Why not include Fred?
what was ramos thinking????
Lmao David Luis smiled when he fell xD
They should make a update video and add Neymar vs Mexico in the world cup
"the real shame here is that pretty much every one of these dives managed to get the other player penalized! 

whilst the diver got rewarded for it!!"
Lmfao on the first one
This sport is really for pussies
The most famous german dive is missing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vX74Ebm2nM
Totally concerned there is no sign of Ashley Young in here.... Pitiful stuff from him a few years ago.
Vidal didn't dive he nearly broke his fuckin ankle
you forgot to add all of this dives too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViiTr8WNuYM
70-80% by Latin players...
No Danny Alves?
Always the utmost awfull music when it comes to football videos smh ðŸ˜…
Add Naymar to this in the match against mexico please!!!!
#NoEraPenal
Half of these aren't dives though.
1:10 bruh look at that fuckin smile on Luiz's face
Biggest problem in the sport right now. Bunch of shameless pussies willing to debase themselves and bend the rules to win dirty. Pathetic.
Where's Gaymar?
I love you VAR
I smell a presence of Ronaldo fangay somewhere over here :D These are not even "funny" when u get used to Ronaldo diving skills class :DD
Vidal kicked the ground tbf
No. 8 deserves a red for that dive
sad behaviour by "men"??????
Oh god he just touch my shoulder then my head is hurt so much
Wtf Vidal dive xdd
David Luiz one made me laugh
There should be an award for "best diver" there would be ronaldo, neymar and suarez
Half of these werent even dives...
Wow, I didn't know they taught the Stanislavski method in football school.
You're missing harry Kane on here.
Knew some butt hurt wanker would put Robben vs Mexico in there. It was a penalty. Yes, he made the most of it and he is a renowned diver. But he was still impeded in the box.
Beautiful game my ass........
They should get instant red card for this unsportman conduct.
Arjen Robben whas not a dive, look at the top point of his shoe when he falls
Soccer and basketball.... just can't take them seriously.
Naymar is gonna make this list if he keeps up his nonsense
Could've just called this Brazil highlights
Robben had to dive because he knew the Dutch couldn't beat them. He's the person I like to call a floppy seal
Did anybody know that P. Pogba is long lost twin of D. Drogba?
Where is neymar?
at 1:10 luiz is laughing
@1:09 cuteness overloaded !!
No Neymar, No Ronaldo, no like
Neymar-------
Neymar vs MÃ©xico
Hell na that David luis smile looks straight out of a horror movie
Where is neymar and Ronaldo ?
@1:10
I'd love to see one of these pussies get a career ending injury from flopping like a little bitch.
SMFH!?!
Neymar should have went into swimming with his diving skillz
"do these people take a day of acting clases 
its like there reflexes are too fast 
they get touched by another player they dont even think of falling they just do it ...
..Incredible"
Glad I'm not a football fan;  what an embarrassment to sport, lol
Pussies
That smile of david luiz
1:09 Hahahaha
Out of curiosity has a player ever been red carded because the opposition dived so decided to make the simulation real by ensuring the diver got some studs dug into his legs at least? :-/
on the suarez one the player clipped his calf
If its not a combat sport, its a pussy sport, rugby, american eggball, bascketball, baseball, tenis, diving, all pussies.
arjen robben was not a dive i think . it looks like the defenders foot was on his foot
Why isnt neymar the top 1
I already forget half of them
1:07 DAVID LUIZ EVEN SMILED AFTER GOING DOWN HAHAHHA MF
Me trying to fake being sick and peeping if my mom is buying it
Lol robben was not even diving
now u can put neymar and he will have all the top 10 spots
Neymar is the king of DIVING
and1:50 sergio has laught
ROBBEN DID NOT DIVE, HE EXAGGERATED BUT IT WAS STILL A FOUL ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±
1:50 peekaboooooo
I love football, but the culture could really take a hint from hockey and other contact sports when it comes to diving
They need to clean up the flops and dirty plays with instant replay. Football needs to modernize
Pussies.
0:42 a fish out of the waterðŸ˜‚
Why do all soccer videos like this have horrible music playing the whole time
obivously the first one isnt diving, he kicked the ground as you can see.. then hes pointing at the real madrid player and telling the ref that he touched it last
I hope VAR finally puts an end to this terrible aspect of the sport
1:10 That Smile
Is it coincidental that the team is losing are the ones taking the fall?  LOL!!!!!   Imagine before instant replay and video taping.  Getting away with murder.
soccer LOL
Some of these looked like they legitimately tripped
That why i hate football
This is ruining soccer/ football
This is why some people find it hard to like the sport of soccer.
robben wasn't a dive, it was genius
https://youtu.be/M05TcD_gZBg
Ramos should be ashamed of himself !!! Cuadrado barely touched him (on his shoulder) . Cuadrado was sent off (red card) during the final match of the Champions Leauge Cup. Come on!
No era penal
00:30 Lol
0:45 fish out of water??
You are ronaldo fan where are ronaldos dives
If you take a dive, you should get a LIFETIME BAN from soccer.
This video has too many mistakes,most of them are Real fouls
you should do 1 of these from this years world cup , the knock out phase has just started yet theres so many to choose from , set it to that old 60,s i think nancy sinatra  bang bang song, as they go down like they,ve been shot after the slightest touch . it,s pathetic and sets a sorry example for the young wanna be footballers watching them roll around on the floor ,again  pathetic
These guys have no shame and no honour - it's the reason I find it difficult to watch "the beautiful game"
They should red card divers upon review.... it would stop this drama. Ashamedly it's become part of the game
No era penal
Where is Ronaldo
They should start a career in acting for drama movies.
NO ERA PENAL
1:09 when you already know what you get for christmas
0:47 Hey Dogson do the silly Salmon
Idont think so
I was hoping to see the one in which Jordi Alba tripped solo and Barca was awarded a free-kick or pk (not sure) and won the game with them scoring it.   Hopefully next vid, also there are a ton more from especially CR7, Busquets, Ramos, Pepe recently xD
God I hate football
Where is the CUAUTEMIÃ‘AC????
David Luiz can't stop laughing ,that's so funny
This is why association football is not as popular in America as American football â€” bunch of sissies
Brazil is known for diving....Especially neymar
Need to make it an automatic red card for flops
I don't think this semen slurping sport is for me...
Chupame el pene negro ctm
What an absolute shower of cunts
2:23 I agree it was a little exaggerated but the other obviously stepped on Robben's foot
When you get hit in the leg and grab your face xD
They should have 4 snipers on each corner and instantly shoot anyone that does this.
Error 404: Neymar not found.
Kindergarden.
lots of Brazilian motherfuckers
Pack of handbags ðŸ–•
Crappy list. Most of these werent even dives. A couple of them people tripped on themselves and fell (first one who shot in the ground while the impact made him fall forward), some of them were clearly contact (Ramos getting stomped, Suarez getting kneed in the back). You can easily find 11 more blatant dives than this list. You for example missed Gilardino who ran 3 steps then fell down or that brazilian player in the brazilian league who fell down with no player around him getting a penalty.
snipers are at it again
Shitty music
That Robben one he stepped on robbens foot so he started running and couldnt so he fell
first one wasn't a dive, he kicked the floor, he tried to play it as a dive but he didn't dive on purpose.
â€œMenâ€.
0:59 Suarez didn't dive,he did the hand motions but contact was made in his leg
1:17 ðŸ‘¿
Pussy's
Why do you have to play this awful music with it? The commentary would had been much better
the 3rd one is not a dive
any list of divers is incomplete without C ronaldo inside.
There should be cards for flopping. Makes soccer look like a pussy sport. Makes me mad.
0:32 like a fish out of the water
There should be an Oscar category for this.
50 lashes with a bull whip for each.
the days before VAR
"2:07 - 2:09 it says ""Life's Good"" on the fence and the player is looking at it while falling
He is probably like ""NO IT'S NOT!"""
No Era Penal
Hhhmm two Sergio's and they are two bitches!
1:50 PEEKABOO!
What a gay game. For sissies and poofters
"Really people cant understand Cuadrado trample on Ramos foot?
Still thinkin the dive was 4 the push? 

Omg..."
I was absolutely dying the entire time xD
How is there no Ronaldo or Neymar in this video? they're the biggest divers in the modern game, lol
Comically pathetic
Sergio Ramos?? Why isn't he banned for life? The dirtiest player out there
this was clearly created by a mexican guy ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
David he was laugh he didn't get hurt
Funny how they grab their face and not the area where they were tapped on
"This is the reason that turns me off from football. Used to love watching as many matches as possible but the diving really threw me off.
Instead of poultry fines how about they actually get tougher by implementing  immediate red cards or an actual sin bin for like 10-20mins (discretion of ref) . Maybe if they see their diving causes them to lose big cup games or a league constantly, perhaps they would stop or even just not be considered for top flight football. Make the sport half way towards beautiful again"
me in PES 2018
2:20 Robben dive was actually a fault. The defender touched his foot
Now drop on the deck and flop like a feeeeeesh
what about divenaldoðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
0:27 #2 He flaps around on the ground like a fish out of water, hilarious!!
The Sergio Ramos one js just epic...;;
#3 was a trip
How come you don't put one of cristiano ðŸ˜‚
Kofi's
Thats a foul 0:42
They been watching neymar too much
Not all dives, lots of theatrics though. You should do a, "top 100 Suarez dives", such a dirty player (especially when he does his classic "try to punch them in the couch as he takes a dive" ones).
I prefer hockey, a sport where players do everything they can to prove they're not hurt.  As opposed to football, where players do everything they can to prove they ARE hurt.  They should give PINK cards to the players faking injuries.
Stupid Vidal ðŸ˜‚
Yeah I knew you wouldn't add Ronaldos dive after I saw your channel picture
This is why i don't watch soccer
Where is CR7 ???
I like this sport a lot but this is retarded. They can take a long pass from the keeper straight to the dome no worries but a little touch and over they go. Pathetic.
The flops and fakery make the sport unmatchable IMHO.
2:21 not dive
I HATE Ramos.
No era penal!!!!
Like have none of these idiots ever heard of slow motion replay?
The first one wasn't a dive he just missed the ball
"So I understand that the soccer referee has yellow and red cards for warning or ejecting a player.
Maybe there should be a third card - colored cow-poop brown.
That way the ref can hold it up and call 'BULLSHITT!' when a player takes an obvious dive."
Football/soccer is for weak ass bitches. Be a man and not such pussy fucks.
What a dive from arturo vidal !!
No. 3 there was contact on Suarez just couldn't see it
Gud thing we have var now
You forgot Greece vs Cote d'Ivoire which i'm commenting before the start of the viewing because everybody always forgets it
well ... its simple ... fake a dive  ... get 5 matches no play penalty , 20% of your monthly pay check and same penalty for your club. And the game becomes cleaner suddenly. And just keep the fines rising to keep players off the idea for faking again. :) ...P.S>  Ronaldo will have to beg for money to get something to eat :D
Where is Penaldo?
Overpaid big babies grow up
Robben isnt a dive. They stepped on his foot.
Some of those were just embarrassing, others were utterly shameful.
Adrian looks like a hooked Merlin out of water...
The worst thing is that colombia dive on japan to get a goal
This is why American people hate soccer
David Luis the best ðŸ˜‚
I dont se Messi or Neymar
Lol you're so biased. The king of dives isn't on the vid. I wonder why
Nothing beautiful about this game
"1) The #9 Is a fall. 
2) You could add Tra fall by strootman in Lazio-Roma, The derby o 2017 (retourn)."
Umtiti?
Students of Neymar
Ronaldo?
This should be named TOP 10 football player acting.
Lmao his face 1:04
cringe ðŸ˜‚
This 11 dives should have been ronaldo all of them
You forgot the whole Italian team.. ; )
"Ther is no dive of Cristiano Ronaldo
Because he is ronaldo fan 
Another madridog channelðŸ‘ðŸ‘"
1:10 hahahha
Robben's was a legit foul.
All are fucker.. great actor
This video should be titled, "11 Reasons Soccer Will Never Be Popular In North America."
Okay you guys have to be honest the rivaldo one is pretty funny
Red Card for Diving. No more diving.
1:10 THAT SMILE
the first about vidal isn't a dive... he hit the ground, so I wanna see you hitting the ground so hard when running
I hate Ramos, but he Cuadrado step on his foot.....And where's Ronaldo's dive on sideline??
Where is Ronaldo ?
Some were not dives
Lmaoooo the first one ðŸ˜‚
What a collection of scumbags
2:25 was not a dive
Number 2 is so jokes
Can we add Sistos dive against Australia this world cup
WOW NO RONALDO NO FUN!!!
Ok to all of u guys getting mad, diving is part of the sport. These are just examples of people who are really bad at it
Fake sissies hopefully you've been VARred out of football.
Peek a boo
Admin penaldo fan..  Madrid dog
Footbal players=SOFT COCKS
Uefalona
u do know a dive is when a player goes down without contact? i think theres 1 dive in this video click bait
Vidal is a trash... I don't have respect for him, he said bad words on Ronaldo and on Real Madrid after they won vs Juventus in UCL... He starts fights with his teammates... He dives... No respect for him!
Dislike ðŸ™‚
There's a lot to like about this sport, however, one thing that keeps killing it's credibility is all the fake falling, acting performances after getting slightly touched, it's so lame, it would be so much better if men played like men. Bring in a review panel that reviews games after they have been played, all actors get banned for the season or tournament.
arjen robbens was valid cause his foot was actually stepped on
This is why soccer is so bad
Dude cuadrado actually stamped on ramos's foot,a different camera angle showed that
I was waiting for neymar.. ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜› am amazed hes not in this 11ðŸ˜…
Overpaid Fuckers
where's gilardino? surely the greatest dive of all time
Every single one of them is a dick, they should really penalize this crap.
I just hate Ramos
Half of these should be of Madrid and Neymar. I'm guessing you're fans of them
Daft rangers players
Where is Ronaldo?
2:17 because of that Mexico was eliminated in 2014 world cup now in 2018 world cup Netherlands is not playing
he hit the floor #1
Diving tramps
Unsportsmanlike conduct, improve the game by handing out a yellow card to anyone diving.
unsubbed
"ronaldo does not dive!
see? he is not in this video
cause he is ultra legend! xDxDXDXDXDXD"
1:10 Wow gives the camera a little smile
This is exactly why Americans dont like soccer! And why our best athletes dont play the sport. Sad when these are your Best athletes!!
"Robben DID NOT dive 
.The defender clearly stepped on his boot."
Should be fined by football association
You missed the 583.000 times Cristiano Ronaldo went for a dive...
Arjen Robben didn't dive, there was a contact. But maybe he hardened it a little bit, but there was a contact. Busquest actually got a push in his face.
David Luiz tho
How about Fred in Croatia vs Brazil
When people ask me why I rate Maradona the best ever, this is the reason why. Back then defenders used to boot him, really try to clean him out but he nearly always stayed up and got away. Would love players of this era have to go back and play during that time. They wouldn't last a season. They're snowflakes.
This acting is making the game bad and is disappointing the world. In Australia, everyone I know who is into rugby says that soccer is for weaklings and that we're all actors and over react. I mean we have all done it but these once are happening ALL THE TIME and putting shame on the Beautiful Game.
Unbelievable thing that you can blame a player like Drogba by cutting the face part of the replay...
No ronaldo no party
li
li
li
In 2:21 that was not a dive it was a real foul
"2:59 i'ts Napoli-Chealse? It finish?
1-0?
2-2?
Tell me please"
All this guys need to go to the prison all their life. It's horrible, It's not a sport, It's a joke. And they've got millions dollars to do that ? Go to hell.
Robben ruined my life
It's a dive just think about a small player like that to put Drogba down? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I thinking : its not funny its a shame of sport bring theater on green.
Lmao most were from Barcelona... Divelona... HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGA
0:45 was a red
gilardino dive
Thierry Henry diving against Spain in the 2006 world cup that led to one of their goals should be included.
Haha this guy is a real ronaldo fan hhh.....
"Yo, Im disliking cuz no ronaldo






JKðŸ˜‰"
Fans hate it, players hate it, refs hate it....nothing done to stop it. Why?
2:20 can somebody brake his leg
2:20 #noerapenal
ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…
'Dives'... if someone puts his hand on your face its not diving. Ofcourse the theater displayed here is awfull. But they have to go down. I'm not a diver. Got an elbow rigth below my eye. It wasnt a pretty sigth. Not even a foul or card for this. Just because i didnt go down. In seconds my eye was double the size. I say go down. Well done of someone touches your face in any way
Iron rowben for mexicans
im not forgetting the first one
"Messi is a great player. But the fans.....
Same is with ronaldo.
They're both great, but this season Ronaldo is playing better tbh.
But M.Salah is playing godly.
I'm not a fangirl of Salah,Ronaldo or Messi but. Tbh, Salah deserves the Ballon d'or this year. WHO AGREES?"
Vidal at Juventus couldn't see it ðŸ¤£
#9 is not a dive
Where's Dele Alli in literally any game he has played in?
You can see that he is such a Ronaldo fanboy...
Where is Penaldo?
2 and 3 isn't dive! Clear foul
Robben didn't dive. Look at his left foot on the replay
And they say its a 'mans' game. Embarrassing.
Where's the likse of gilardino and ashley young?
1:07Â iÂ thinkÂ heÂ gotÂ distractedÂ byÂ thatÂ femaleÂ referee
It's a girls sport
Soccer players are actual pussies, rugby is for men.
Robben's was clearly not a dive. It shouldn't have been a foul, but he didn't dive. It's called "losing your balance".
Admin is a Ronaldo fanboy thats why he didn't added Lord Ronaldo in this video
Number 2 wasn't a dive.
Where is Gilardino?
Can u see David Luiz smiling and laughing to himself after he dived . Like if you see that ðŸ‘
i hate ramos even tho im a real madrid fan
Para los que lloran aÃºn, si era penal de Robben, impecable el Ã¡rbitro xd
U r biased , no ronaldo
Penaldo??? ðŸ¬
They are all a disgrace to the game .
The only reason why soccer sucks
VAR would've given penalty for all of this even if it was outside the dee ðŸ˜‚
Number 9 was a legitimate penalty, he had his foot stepped on
Sorry my friend but No9 robben .....is a penalty...if you watch closely the defender has contact in the shke with robben's shoe....wrong choice for tge video
hello mute button
Can't you make football videos without bad music????
grown men pretending to be hurt.  so embarrassing...
This is why I quitted soccer. Now I play lacrosse ;)
I can not forget about anything to do with football now because of this channel
Arjen robben's was legit
Sergio "the bitch" Ramos
â€¦ all Bastards!!!
What a pussys
Dammmmmmmm...........ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
What a terrible video. Dislike
A lot of people in the comments don't like Ronaldo clearly
Sick music ðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸
This guy didn't add Ronaldo cuz Ronaldo is god of Fake dives
yo where's neymar bruh ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Football is pathetic with bitches playing
1:50 cuckoo...cuckoo....most idiot people
I don't care how good they are individually, these kinds of shameless tactics and theatrics bring disgrace to the beautiful game. These players should be banned for this kind of behavior.
I dont like footballers like this. FUCKIN ACTORS
how can first one be a dive if he ACCIDENTALLY kicked the ground?
"2:16 He stepped on his foot
Oke the reaction was too much but still"
Where is ronaldo?He is damn no 1
I was waiting for atleast one  ronaldo clip...  Hit like if you were too..lol
U take luis Suarez dive nd forget about cr7 infamous divesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚bias video
there is any of this videos without that stupid teenaged music?
This is why American soccer is much better to watch.  They just play the game instead of flopping to get a free kick.  Pussy ass Europeans need to man up and stop acting like a bunch of menstruating teenage girls.
Ronaldo's dive vs Celta Vigo
Worthless human beings.
You forgot Italy vs Australia 2006 World Cup. Italy = diving country
#2 isn't a dive he just over exaggerates it
you forgot ronaldo OMG
Where's Ronaldo and Neymar
Suarez vs PSG in the remontada
Ramos you filthy motherfucker..
Where's umtiti
The first few were legit fouls
#3 is not a dive look at his knee
I really all of them would be Ronaldo
Where is Alba  fc barcelona ????????? Dislike
u forget ronaldo dive mate ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Penaldo is GOAD - greatest off all dives
Not ronaldo?
You love ronaldo
Some aren't dives
first one is not a dive he just hit the grass
"Check out Danko Lazovic's dive in the Hungarian league 1
Flopping around like a fish"
All those fake players should be ban for life.  Making the games look very bad as cheat to win.
There's some fine soccer skills on display here..
You have to include Greizmann's dive against Australia for the next edition.
All the reasons why soccer sucks.
Everybody complaining about Ronaldo, the Celta Vigo (sorry if it is misspelled) dive is legit. But I do believe that Messi has had a few dives in his career, where are people wondering about him? Arjen Robben is trash btw.
The main reason why I now hate this sport. Cowards and cheats and  gullible, stuoid referees.
This is why soccer sucks, game for the actors. They'll cry like a girl in a real man's game.
This is why I can't take this game seriously.  Fake injuries, diving, massive embelishments...  If those players in the video got 10 match bans, you'd see an end to this garbage.
Soccer - Gay
What a biased vid, no Ronaldo's yet a lot of Barca's
The one in the thumbnail isn't a dive he was just being stupid and kicked the grass by accident
What about the famous dive of KakÃ¡ ?
My opinion these Dives where acceptable due to how funny and unpredictable they where ðŸ˜‚ some of them where Prue comedy genius and amazing to watch
A red card and $1 million fine for diving will solve a lot of problems.
0:33 and the best dying fish impression goes to...
How is the #9 clip with Arjen Robben a dive? He clearly got stepped on.
this sport will always be dominated by European drama queens!
Cristiano Ronaldo?ðŸ¬
Superhuman showdown ðŸ˜‚
This is so funny. The second one was hilarious he actually got up and then went back down LOL!
enter in youtube: andreas moeller dive,  to see the best dive
"""Spirit of the game"" ?!??

Cunts."
???? where is the 2 from nani of man utd.one where he headbutted a player from aston villa then made out he was hit,then his classic of tapped by carra run around the referee as he got blank then started to die.who can forget rivaldo
The first one wasnt a dive he just missed the ball but idk why he still said he got fouled lol
Bunch of pussies.. can you imagine this happening in Rugby
How is Gilardino vs Celtic not on this list?
"To me a dive is when someone goes does when he WASNT touch.
If someone exaggerate a contact, that's not a dive."
None from Ronaldo?
kakean iklan ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
I played soccer my whole life and is is painful to watch, what a disgrace to the sport
there is a lot of diving in the liga mx too !
1:10 The grin at the camera was just too good
Suarez is best
Top 11 Oscar nominee's..
This is why contact sports are better
What do Rivaldo, Arjen Robben, DÃ go Maradona, Dennis Wise and Sergio Ramos have in common? They are five of the most slimy and loathsome individuals to have ever appeared on a football field. I would loved to be locked into an empty room with any one of them! On the subject of divers, they should be banned for life.
They did step on robbens foot
These grubs need to be eliminated from the game.
Sve debil do debila...druÅ¾e, direktan crveni pa se bacakaj do mile volje ;)
david luiz one is rlly funny
Like fainting sheep
Don't need to show ronaldo's dive cause we already know that she is the dive queen.
I just couldn't consciously do it in front of millions of viewers
Seriously, the Oscars need to add football as a new category.
Infamous dives
Robben's a scumbag
And thats why i hate soccer.
RAMOS U SWINE!
They look like such wimps.
Send them all off!
Bunch of pussies, don't watch footy anymore because of that.
Diving is the worst thing in the best sport. In AUstralian rules football you get fined for doing this crap.
Suarez vs PSG didn't dive
Where is The Dolphin's dive?
1:51 got to love this peep ðŸ˜¬
gay sport
Pepe, Ronaldo ?
The Adryan one wasn't a dive wtf. He overreacted but he was fouled.
All of these make me mad except David Luiz, that was funny
Drogba???? Really, why would you????
No top 10 here....like spinal tap this one goes to 11
I have already forgotten all 11, but I remembered the into
The first one wasnt a dive he just hit the pitch with his foot
2:15 wasn't a dive
"I somehow get it if you dive when there's actual contact, could be tactical. 
But when there's no contact whatsoever, or that exaggerated rolling around, they should punish it harder."
We see this stuff happen in nearly every match now. Suarez dives but this was a bad example. How about when a player heavily fouls someone then dives and pretends he was the one who was fouled to cover it up? Buahaha.
Yes some of them are dives but there are still fouls like Luis Suarez got elbowd by serigo Ramos, the foul is slight but it's there. Same with Ramos when he was stepped on by Juventus player.
no 10 was not dive, he did stomp ramos's foot, your video just shows the upper half, i am not denying that it was not a red but it was not a dive
3:08 why did he do that
Gilardino dive should be on here for sure.
Just wondering, why do soccer players dive so much.
Pederson has autism
They were trained to do so. LOL
Busquets piece of s........
The whole barca is where?
7 and 9 where definitely contact they just milked it but to be fair a good few of these are
"How tf is the first one a â€œdiveâ€ ?!??
He messes up his footing and falls over, not a doc"
sergio ramos dive is pathetic
bousquets uomo di merda. .
first clip wasnt a dive he kicked the floor
Some of them are not dives though
I couldn't even watch till the end to embarrassing
This is why some people hate soccer.
I forgot about all of these. Not impossible
Football players are pussies
"Bonucci infamous dive you won't regret watching this.
https://youtu.be/wlT9tGtbMjg"
This is pathetic. I thought NBA flops were bad.
Bunch of pussies!
I love how they shake off 5 defenders grabbing and pushing them as they sprint and dribble with perfect balance. Then as soon as they reach the penalty area any touch causes all their bones and organs to explode.
Divers, flippers, its outta control. Refs should just let play continue or card the those who dive.
Needs to be taken from the game. I live in Australia and watch football/soccer and when i see this it makes me not want to watch.
lel
Soccer is gay
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiG707bVfLA
9 wasnt a dive
Can you simply play the clips without adding the stupid music?!
Vidal pointing afterwards is glorious!
Pussies
Footballers are so weak.
This is why I hate football, they are all cheats.
This is the reason why I dont follow football. Lame
Only disliked for the music
Australia vs Italy?
Most of these aren't even dives. You obviously don't have eyes.
The exact reason why I hate nowadays football. Fuckin actors
sometimes i wonder why did i watch football again
I find this part of soccer to be excruciatingly pathetic
I think Vidal genuinely thought he had been fouled hahahahaha
The game today shameless these players just for a red  card ,or to get an inch ,  free kick  or a Oscar for play acting!
Soccerballers are pathetic.
12 Ronaldo's in the 2018 world cup match Portugal - Spain
so pathetic.....
Sergio Ramos : The biggest cunt in football.
Ramos...
Hard to respect a sport where this nonsense is acceptabe
Soccer. Most overrated sport in the world.
Sisi kebancian pemain bola
1/2 of this situations staight red card for simulation!
Girls
"Football is full of nothing but wimps and is renowned for crap like this. 
You'd never find anything like this being attempted in rugby"
That leeds one is ridiculous.
What a fruity sport.
robben's foul was real....they are stamping in his feets
That's y I hate barca coz of Suarez and the other divers
The Luis Suarez flop actully was a good flop
Hey ronnie fangirl .. where is our Oscar winner gaynaldo  in this video ??
It shows that you are cr7 fan boy , because he is the biggest diver and cry baby
Those cheaters ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
This is why i STOP watching football.. a lot of faget clown..
You forget Alexis Sanchez actor performation in Barcelona
I think Suarez can fill the whole list
What about ronaldo man
suarez is a dive  master............
Where is Ronaldo ?
The first (Vidal) isn't a dive
Sergio Ramos dived because cuadrado pushed him
0:54 if Suarez wouldn't have dived they would have losed the game !!
"East or west
Barca is the best"
U could make a top 100 on Ronaldo
Suarez #1
obvious Ronaldo fan
And Ronaldo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚??
Vidal didn't dive he tripped over himself
Came here to see Van Gaal
Goddamnit, that David Luiz one is so so good.
Where is Gaynaldo ? This channel sucks
Vidal did not dive he kicked the ground and genually thkught he was fouled
"Diving video without cr7 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

This guy clearly barÃ§a hater showing only barca players"
Some of these aren't dives
No 6 when the mouth odor hits you
The Sergio Ramos one was real I'm not kidding
In Basketball, it's called flop. You can ask LeBron James about it.
.
0:03 he didn't dive he just tripped
Lol
At 1:10 you can see david luiz on the ground smiling
OH REALLY? DDROGBA? R U FCKIN KIDDING ME?
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
As a Hispanic kid I hate robben for that he got us out of the world cup
SuareÅº fall down was not a dive it also hit on his knee when you look carefully you can understand
Where is penaldo
dude Real Madrid does 3 dives in just one game
Es gibt ein Video und das heiÃŸt auf Deutsch: Die Unfaiersten Fussballmomente. Und da sind fast genau die gleichen Videos
Vidal's  reaction  fter  falling.. ðŸ˜‚
Yeah,it's impossible to forget but it is impossible to remember to!!!!!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Why there haven't been the dive of ronaldo against celta vigo?
Lol
Number ten annoys me because he tried to say sorry for the lightest of touches but Sergio Ramos still falls
Penaldo????
On Busquets and on the David Luiz there are both fouls and yellow card for dangerous playing, there is no dive just they make it to look painful, learn what is dive and after upload video with that.
"Bro you forget the best diver

Penaldo"
Diveiano penaldo?
Ops, i forgot it all
Where's Fillipo Inzhagi? Oh yeah, he still dive until now...
And where is Ronaldo, bro?
people are very cheeky these days
Luis Suarez was clearly shoved in the box that angle does not give him justice. It literally only shows when he is about to hit the floor not when he got shoved.
Barcelona is the fuckin most cheater team in the world... and about the Ramos scene juve player kicked him with his leg( it's not covered in this video) it wasn't diving at all
#2no dive
Suarez didnt dive,look Marqui... legs i am not fan of suarez but thats not dive
If hr gonna be a footballer dont dive they have cameras
Vidal didn't dive agginst Real...You can see that he hit the ground...
1:11 he's smiling
1:11 he smiles!
Bro, that with vidal maybe seems funny, hea could have broken his leg easily
Arjen robben didn't really dive.. he just drew the defender into the foul... it was actually rather smart I'd say.
FOOTBALL IS ALL ABOUT RESPECT huh? please....
Where is Ronaldo's dive
Cr7 is the 10th time best divellon d'or winner.. ðŸ‘ without him this is incomplete
Where is ronaaaaaaldoo??ðŸ˜ƒðŸ³

where is jordi alba's dives??
And u r a divaldo fan
Where is the portuguese Dolphin
where is ronaldos dive?
Estos chilenos :v
Ok the guy actually stepped on robben's foot though
Ramos is just a dick
The thing is if you look closely Robben didn't actually dive don't hate me but look close
The Suarez one isn't famous tbh
What about cr7 or you are real fan
Where are the Benfica players
How does this vid have not one Ronaldo diveðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
worst video because there is no any CR7 dive...loll
"Where is ronaldo's dive?
ronaldo fanboy"
We're talking about diving and no ronaldo here? Hard to believe
Van gal
I am a Madrid fan, but Ronaldo is great at diving, and neymar is his brilliant student. While Suarez has already graduated from Division State University. XD
I just have to say this.. actors n@sty moth. F#â‚¬krz!
number 2 Wasnt A Dive
Adryan wasn't a dive... he jus overreacted
"Where is penaldo? He  should have at least 2-3 clips 
Also ramos should be at least 4 
Stupid real madrid kid"
Ronaldo hein
Ramos is the biggest cheat I hate him
You are so bad...You are 100% Uefa Madrid fan...When Ronaldo score beautiful goal like aginst Juve,you make video - Top 10 goals of season...
"And ronaldo tought them these dives. 
You are one cr7 dick rider bro. 
It is not possible when there is dive vedio and ronaldo is not present."
omg the second one haha xd
Netherlands vs MÃ©xico uuh y did this happen
How about Ronaldo's against netherlands
Luis suarez no dives
Sergio Ramos is a f*cking asshole
#2
Ramos dive was just funny
Ramos tidak diving cuadrado menginjak kaki ramos
My YouTube is glitched
Haha, you put Suarez's dive in this video, but you don't put all Ronaldo's dives. Ronaldo dive against Celta Vigo?
"This type of faking is disrespectful to the game
There's a reason to call football the beautiful game -""RESPECT"""
Robben not

Peekaboosquets
#3 wasn't a dive
0:53 there was a contact Def pushed Suarez's leg
The fun thing is that it's more painful to throw yourself because someone sneezed than to quit crying and playing on
THE 9 and 10 are Bs so don t put it in
"David luiz face 1:09




Smiling"
Should have named 11 cheats impossible to forget.
Vidal's wasn't a dive,he thought he hit another player's foot,but it was the ground
This is why football is hated in some countriesðŸ˜¬
The award goes to this few people
#no era penal
I know player from Barcelona are gay
Messi?
"Omg How you Can be so dumb?
The first one wasnt dive!!!!!
He just kicked into ground!!!
Jerk"
This is what ruins soccer for me people who play in this manner. if you get tackled take it like a man dust your self off and keep on going and if your really been fouled its will be obvious you won't have to act like you've been shot for god sakes
Funny how Barca fans call Ronaldo a diver when they have a rat having heart attacks in the box
And now......... Real divedrid in the quarter finals
Luis SuÃ¡rez should be all other this list
Chilerdos
Where's Ronaldo who might have been on top. Sure Ur a Ronaldo fan that's y
1:52 why is Sergio busquets playing peek a boðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
01:07 luiz was laughingðŸ˜‚
Ramos was not dive cuadrado stamped his leg then why he said sorry to ramos
One awful thing about soccer that works against its credibilty.
first one is not a dive.. missed the ball
Ronaldo? .... typical ronaldo fan boy
You forgot Penaldo dude
"1:10 Pause And See .... 
Thank me later...."

I hate cheats
Wtf #5
why do these videos always have to have crappy music? no music would be better
Busquets uomo dimmerda
Why was ramos even holding his foot
"People in the comments wondering where is Ronaldo..
Ronaldo's divings are not ridiculous like in the video' that's why he is the 'king of diving'.. rumors say he will patent his diving style.."
Jesus at least make it look realistic!!!
I can't believe BT Sports pundits praised Suarez dive against PSG as clever. Should be a disgrace to help a comeback with a dive
This video can be made just of penaldo dives but owner of channel is fan of haha madrid
1:10 HAHAH like a boss.. never liked him before but now i do
I hate divers! Spain/Real Madrid/Barcelona and thos divas are the worst.
number #3 is a dive? you know nothing about football if you think that's a dive son...
#2 is a dead fish
Filthy, grosse Latin Americans!
1:10 David Luiz Proof !
I couldn't stop myself laughing at the Ramos dive .

Suarez....one bite man...ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚
Embarrassing. They like little babies
First one is not a dive: he simply kicked the turf. Hard. And tried to blame others.
They need to try rugby.
This one on 0:01 is not dive. He just kicked in the grass and fell thats it
Imo #10 isn't really a dive, he stamps Ramos's foot, its not captured in the camera though, he even acknowledges it by apologising to Ramos
penaldoðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Where is Neymar jr
Wheres CR7 actions ?ðŸ˜Ž
1:07 david luiz thug life ðŸ˜‚
More proof as to why the sport sucks.

"Where is ronaldo....
Greatest diver in the world? ðŸ˜‚"
VidalðŸ˜…
Yubtuber must be penaldo fan
Ramos is the kingâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºâ˜ºðŸ‘
Min 2:21 super piscinazo pero hay que dejarse de cosas si fue penal al majarle el pie
I don't think any other dive made me as mad as Ramo's. I get that as a professional winning by any means necessary is a thing. Not something that I support, but fine, I see your point. But that game was in the bag. The only way Real was going to lose that is if a miracle happened. The fact that Ramos was aiming for Oscars on the 83rd min with a 3-1 lead and a rather convincing spell really really infuriates me. And I admired Ramos before then, lol.
Top 10 ronaldo dives?
Im sure Ramos' foot hurt after that push. Looks painful ahaha (#10)
Wankers
Where la ronaldo eeeh
This is why I cannot get into football...bunch of fakes.
Jordi alba barcelona you forget
Modric vs Psg
Some of these aren't really dives...
vidal kicked the ground
0:30 un pescado fuera del agua
Kkkkkkk mi
0.27 wasn't a dive it was a clear dive.
It was a foul on Robben
He's  smealing at 1:11
This is so cringe sometimes
#2
Ronaldo has a lot of dives, and you didn't upload it?
haha ronaldo should have won all this list from 10 to 1. what a fangay channel :)))
David Luiz cracking a smile lol
#9 are you mexican, that clearly wasnt a dive..
He wasn't diving!! Number #0
The ronaldo one ?
Haven't even watched it I bet robbed is there
To the video maker...u have 1.7M followers. I expected more from you
Where is divaldo?? Yes I mean penaldo??
Cuadrado step on Ramos foot
Penaldo should be on all places for this top 11
Lmao ðŸ˜‚ pussy sport
It was better to start from number 11
There was a Neymar dive where he goes like a windmill... was an awesome dive
The Italy dive vs Australia?
vidal didnt dive he kicked the grass
That Vidal  idiotic
Barcelona, the school of flops....
of course u are ronaldip fans...
2:26 I don't think that's considered dive, probably more like feint.
Sergio Ramos sucks because he cheats and dives all the time. He is also very aggresive.
Where is the best famous dive of cristiano.....
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚made by a hating madrid fan
#1ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
This is typical football if you want to see sport go to see basketball there aren't people who falls for wind blow...
Jordi alba dive last season in the last league game was disgraceful
Isaac Cuenca's dive was horrific.
vidal aint dive lol
Some were legitimate fouls they were not faking.
1:50 pica boo
Where's penaldos famous dives
And pepe
vidal dives are masterpiece
Where is the best of them all the shitty life of a bitch Penaldo.
Wheres Ronaldo dive?
Kyle laffertyyyyy kyle laffertyyyy he's 7 foot and he plays the flute Kyle lafferty

1:37 old man was saying f***
1:37 old man was saying f***
I remember no. 10
Where's the king of dives -divnaldo?
9 was okay
Where is that dolphin?
U included Ramos , Suarez , Sergio , but there was not even a single one of Ronaldo ? , He is the king of dives and u didn't
This is why american football and rugby fans call us pussies. I love football, but come on, most of the players act like this
there a difference between tripping and diving (in one of them he hit the floor
Where is ronaldo lol??
They should be in hollywood
Aronica
OMG u forgot to put divenaldo's dives ðŸ¤•. Ohhh sorry now I understand why you didn't put them because it's a 3min video if u put Ronaldo's dive u have to make a movie of itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Shite music
The man put his hands on Sergio Busquets' face but he did overreact
Ð°Ð²Ñ‚Ð¾Ñ€ Ð±Ð»ÑÐ´ÑŒ Ð´Ð¾Ð»Ð±Ð¾Ñ‘Ð±...Ñ€Ð¾Ð½Ð°Ð»Ð´ÑƒÐ´Ñ€Ð¾Ñ‡ÐµÑ€ Ñ…ÑƒÐµÐ²...
where's ronaldo.  Just because you are a Ronaldo fan you didn't upload any of his dives ronaldo dives more than suarez
The one of Robben was clearly not a dive. All Mexicans just wanted to have a reason why they lost...
Where's your king dolphin

This sport is for people who didn't make it in Hollywood
This is.. Why i hate football

1:52ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Lol david luiz made my day
Where is ronaldo?? He's the best diver too.. oh.. i forget, that you fans of ronaldo.. lol
For all the guys asking about why ronaldo isnt in the list..its because hes busy swimming with the dolphins at diving diner
Busquits gets a hand on the throat. Hands should not be up there in the first place. There Was another video where they show cuadrado stomping on ramos foot.
Ronaldo at euro 2016
Robben didn't dive
0:30 it's not dive, he just overreacted
Very very poor compilation witch
And the Oscar goes to 0:41
not really dives
For robben,  the chili player ( I'm not sure if chili...) stepped on his foot. It isn't clear but if u do zoom u can fee that he stepped on it...
This sort of thing is getting worse in Football...  Check out our opinions on this subject here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4utH9Z_EC_c We'd love to get your feedback...
Vidal didnt dive hes just blind
"The first guy is kick the dirt
ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†"
To be fair the first one of vidal isn't a dive because if you watch very slowly and zoomed you can see there is a contact with a RM player who causes the "dive"
Is Mexicans will never forget the Robben Dive #No EraPenal
Casemiro against Tottenham?
What about Rinaldo and his famous dives
OMG how cristiano ronaldo is not in the video ??
Where is Casemiro dive against Tottenham Hotspur
A lot were people running fast and getting nudged which I pretty hard to stay up to but shouldn't be a pen / free kick. But some were just dirty
this is why soccer gets a bad reputation
Where is the dive master cristiano ronaldo ,he is the dive master of the football history
But but Messi is better than ronaldo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
How about Suarez for Liverpool
E Vidal one wasn't a dive he said after the game he kicked the floor but thought he was tripped
Barcelona is just so good at diving!!
Yup ronaldo fan for sure He could fikk the entire list
si chiama furbizia comunque...
Suarez werent dive
Messi in Copa America final 2016??
Vidal didnt dive he wanted to shoot the ball but he missed her so he kick the ground and he falled so he didnt dive

4 its a penalty cause meuniers knee hits suarez leg
Kurzawa's knee collided against suarez's thigh

"Where is the king of dive....
Cristianooooo RrronaldoooooooðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
"to be honest the first one wasnt a dive it was a flop
he hit the ground instead of the ball that made him fall"
Thought it was weird that the worst diver in football today wasnt on the list until I was your avi
David luiz's wasn't a dive he was laughing because he knew the player that tackled him was getting sent off.
Not sure whether vidals one was a dive or whether he just kicked the floor
You Messi dickriders shut up. Just cause he didn't add Ronaldo in the video doesn't mean Ronaldo hasn't dived before. Its his video and I'm pretty sure he gives zero fucks about what you think. Messi dickriders always acting like he's the best in history.
Where is CR7??????
Gerrard vs Liverpool? :D
Che bastardone David Luiz ahahaha.
Vidal didnt dive
2nd player was like fish put on riverbank.
Wow ronaldo dive alot but you did not put it on the video nice ðŸ‘ðŸ»

Where are the Cr7's dives ??
Sad thing was Cuadrado got sent off for that. Sergio Ramos ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸
2:06
2:06
The Vidal one at the beginning wasn't even a dive lol
"The one from the thumbnail wasn't a dive he kicked the floor
Still like what an idiot how do you do that as a trained pro footballer"
vidal dive is not fake his opponent moved his leg you should watch replay
We all hate Leeds scum
Arjen robben vs Mexico??
No ronaldo its just because he is ronaldogy fanboy
Robben didn't dive he got stepped on
#10 wasnt a dive
This makes me very angry
"Me showing the #2 to my friends.
""Guys that's what you looks like after you take flakka"""
Pause at 1:11
Ramos didn't dive, Cuadrado stepped on his leg.
Robben is Fault, Drogba is Fault, suarez is Fault, etc..
Not 11 is probably 4 ou 5
Alaba
I hope sergio ramos will seeing his father on this video and get disappointed of his fatherðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Where is KSI ????
a video on famous dives without ronaldo is like cereal without milk
Where is the ronaldo dive??? Yeah your idol on your profile picture is the greatest diver of all time just so you know.
That smile tho 1:10
If you put the playback speed slower on Suarez's "dive", you can see Marquinhos' knee hits the back of Suarez's leg. So, can we confirm this as no dive, or not. More evidence on yes or no dive would be appreciated. Thanks.
On Kyle's I think ur harsh to choose him out of all the bigger players who done the same thing ðŸ˜‚
1:11 what a joker ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ he smiling

Adryan was a foul but he overreacted waaaaayyy to hard.
Pringao el de suarez era penal
N9 Wasnt a dive
I feel like the 1 one accident fell thinking he got pushed and or he missed the ball so he may have dived or missed kicking the bal and missed
Lul david laugh
The first one not dive he shot the ground
Do you have some thing with Barcelona because, those were not dives
I'll always dislike ramos for that dive
Vidal's foot hit the grass
Arjen Robben did not dive. He got hit on the foot before he made the jump

David Luis dive his the best dive
Drogba's dive was nice
Neymar should be in top 1 & saurez in no. 2
Sergio Ramos....Scum of the Earth
Okeh
no single dive of ronaldo given...why?
to be honest the best diving should be 1-10 CR7
Vidal is juve cunt
Like for smile of david luiz
I hate Suarez, he is a diver a biter and a racist
1:11 Is he smiling?
First one wasn't a dive. He just accidentally kicked the ground instead of the ball
You can make a long video just with Cristiano Ronaldo dives, why didn't you put some of his dives un this video?
The king of diving?? Where is Ronaldo???
This guy is stupid number 10 cuardo stepped on Sergio Ramos foot which hurts really bad like if you agree
Strange to say...but Vidal was not diving
Ronaldo isn't on the list bc it is about footballers not dolphins

I don't like how it's a Ronaldo fan based page but u can't put Ronaldo to the side in this vid even in FIFA 18 he dives that's straight proof showing that even in a video game he dives
What a suprise no Ronaldo dives?

No era Penal hahah
Basic Penaldo Fan puts everybody but the Top 2 Best Divers ( Ronaldo ) ( Ramos ) lol
Sergio Ramos did get stepped on a shoved lightly so he could have twisted his ankle but his reaction was not like he twisted his ankle
If i have to make one such Video- i believe all 11 will be with Ronaldo. I don't hate him, but it's definitely unfair if he is not on this list!!
OMG, you must be blind, there are at least 3 ronaldo dives which were ridiculed even by madrid's press. Shame on you!
Where is real Madrid asshole
Vidal was thinking that he got hit but he doean't got hit

Your videos are great man, but how can you forget Ronaldo and Neymar here?
Hey Sergio Ramos didn't dive Cuadrado stepped on his foot

The first dive is not a dive. Infact , he hit his toes on the ground and from the force he fell but he mistakes the denfender for it
"Ronaldo against Celta de Vigo?
Neymar against Uruguay?"
let vinny jones tackle these retards and give em something to cry about
Where's ronaldo? Just because u are a fan him, so u don't include it in the list? Silly monkey.
1:09 XDDDDDD
Where Ronaldo dive ðŸ¬ðŸ¬ in the super cup!?ðŸ˜‚
I don't think nr 1 was a dive ,you can see he kicked the ground. (I know he blamed it on the defender but if he hadn't done that I don't think it could be called a dive)
Busquets did not dive
ronaldo?
I watch ksi
Can u make a top 500 neymar dives?
where is ronaldo at manchester united
No matter whay penaldo is the greatest diver
And this is why I refuse to watch. Any dive should be a Red card and suspension, period. What a bunch of Pu$$y's.
Andreas mÃ¶ller
like
"For Vidal's he kicked the floor by accident and thought the player had tripped him.
David Luiz's wasn't a dive, he was laughing even though he got kicked because he baited Rafael out"
The Sergio Ramos ones is disgusting
I'm surprised not all of these were Ronaldo dives
Now i know how ronaldo is not in the list ......ronaldo fangirl
where is the best player of last 20 years in diving
Vidal did not dive.His boots got stuck in between the football field.But he ask the ref for a penalty
David Luiz didn't dive he got the back of his legs kicked pretty hard. He just smiled about it that's all
Rooben gone fault

Horrible robben hoe ass

Robben didn't dive he stood on his foot, he just makes it look worse
Where's no. 1 diver penaldo
David Luiz one was just briliant
Robben was slightly tackled tho
nooo...noooo Drogba plis
Wrzzer just couldnt put Ronaldo's horrendous dive against Celta on the list :Dd
"Normally I like your vids- this one is just bullshit. There's a difference between dives and acting.
Most of them are just acting: Suarez, Robben, Ramos, Busquets, David Luiz and much more in this video."
Unobjective retarded ronaldo fan
No Ronaldo no like.
Ramos never dived he was actually stomped
football ..a gentleman's game played by hooligans
robben isnt diving at all
First is not diving
Where is Vidal's dive
"Wait so a RONALDO CHANNEL doesn't put at least ONE out of several of Ronaldo's dives in the video??.... well seems fair for a ronaldo fan. Unsubscribed.

I hope you see this"
It's funny how they always hold there face

Luis SuÃ¡rez ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ HDP !!!
There needs to be a no imbelishment rule. All the time, players flop to get fouls and waste time pretending to be hurt. I'd say if I see you flop as a ref i would give a yellow immediately
Don't worry guys! The Ronaldo compilation is coming! Wrzzer needs to cut down the video because YouTube doesn't allow videos over 24h!
Dani alves vs real madrid?
All juventus ones
Lmao, madridiot tryin to forget Ronaldo's dives and Marcelo's one v Wolfsburg

Few players did once in their career from this video. But Ronaldo does it in every game inside penalty box and you haven't include him in this video. This confirms that you are 100% Divenaldo Fan.
At 0:32 the guy was getting hyper
One of them he fell over
That evil smile at 1:11
i can make similar list with all clip from barcelona players
And u forgot to add the god of diving cristiano divenaldo
Football is gay
Where is Ronaldo....???????
Ronaldo top 10 dives?
Diving vido is incomplete without Penaldo
Ronaldo dive v celta vigo???
He is a stupid ronaldo fan and won't put him he is stupid
David luis a clown XD
Arjen Robben should have his own Top 20 Dives
Well u can see that vidal tried to cross it but he hit the grass
"opens the video 
no ronaldo dives 
close the video 
dies"
the first one isnt even a dive ....
I don't see the dives of some of the best divers in the world PENALDO and NEYMARðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
sergio ramos diving in final was the best
Robben and Suarez had not dived. marquinho had tackled Suarez on the behind his leg and the defender against robben had also fouled him as the defender had stepped on his leg. just look carefully
Thanks man... I was pissed off when robben dived... What an asshole
Firs one wasn't a flop
Where is Ronaldo dive?!?? Wow this channel love ronaldo dick cuz he or she didn't put him on the video about him diving
I thought ksi was going to be on this
Some of These aren't even dives

Where are madrid players.?
Mmm ok for people asking where are ronalodo's dives,stfu kids he can't include ronaldo's dives in this video,he needs a new top 10 ronaldo's divesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Adryan is over reacting
No 2 isnt a dive,he just overreacted and no 4 isnt a dive david luiz was actually fouled
The first one isn t a dive dumbasses. You can clearly see that he kicked the grass and made a hole
Madridiot, where's ronaldo?
Where is iwobi vs barÃ§a?
Cuadrado stepped on sergio ramos
Where is jordi alba hahahahahahha
"Who agrees with me that Ramos:
As a player-10/10
As a person-  -1/10"
Both david luiz and sergio busquets actually got hit but that dosen't mean they have to get hurt or roll for 500 times and let's just ignore Ronaldo isn't here while diving week-in week-out, don't get the Messi and Ronaldo fight here just watch every damn match since he's Man U days till now
Ahahahahahah omggg no Cristiano Ronaldo??!?!!? Ahahhahahahahhahahahahaha
WHERE IS TOP CLASS DIVER RONALDO ????
Can u pls upload real madrid and barcelona full matches?? pls
First Ronaldo came to mind and then Busquets peek-a-boo dive
Hahahaha 2 of them from Barcelona!!! Well done and by the way people who are saying that where is ronaldo, don't u remember Pique dives which was like a stray dog and pessi's dives!!!
Almost every video is from uefadrid and uefalona
i think you forget famous dive of ronaldo alsoðŸ˜’ðŸ˜coz you love him
Bro.. Put a disclaimer at the start of video that "I'm a ronaldo fan"...!!!! No ronaldo clip in dives, cheats and sabotaging goals is like no ronaldinho in skills video...!!!!
Of course he wouldn't put divenaldo in the video, biased af.
Ramos is disgusting cuadrado81 was just going to get the ball and just tapped him and he fell like that he was hammered someone has to ask what was the point of it
For every Messi, every Puyol, there's a Sergio Biscuits. The most annoying thing though is that he's a fine player who doesn't need to try and cheat.
"Ramos was stepped on thus deserved red card for cuadrado.
Though he over simulated the situation but it wasn't a dive."
Where's Ashley Young. He the biggest diver in football while playing for Man Utd
Vidal took a L
What?!! where is Dophinaldo????
The reason why he doesn't put any Ronaldo flops is because he is a Ronaldo fan.
Bale shouid be here vs bvb
#GLEARMY
I like how vidal even points at the guy to make them think he did it when he failed to hit the ballðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
in #10 cuadrado stomped on his foot and thats a card every day of the week, dive or not
Pals expertise i prefer   this'  illegal
Kkk vidal
no matter what barca fans will never forget the dives of rm players no matter how game changing they were
You missed ronaldo's dives
Where is Ronaldo's red card against barca
Where is Ronaldo in la liga? That is  unforgettable dive everðŸ˜‚
Robben and Ramos weren't dives. On robben there is clear touch and on Ramos cuadrado steps on his foot that's why he holds his foot
Where's Ronaldo?? he should take like 4 spots out of 11
Ronaldo! Ronaldo! Ronaldo! Ronaldo!
The reason why i dont like ramos anymore ...
"Where is ronaldo
When u edit this video ronaldo dived in ur keyboard so u frgt to add him ryt?"
I thought it was called dive when the tackler didnt touch you. Luiz wasnt a dive.
And the best actor award goes to........tye bastard Sergio Ramos
Can you make top ten dives by Ronaldo?
On 10 : Cuadrado step over Ramos Leg with Boots ...
ronaldo?????????????????????? cmon
divanaldo????
Robbens wasn't a dive. He overreacted but the other guy definitely stands on his foot.
O:45 ksi
First one was no dive
The sad thing is that suarez actually got a penalty for his dive and because of that penalty barca went to the next round instead of psg
Hilarious
Wtf wheres divenaldo
Ronaldo??
where is ronaldo, is suqrez, so where is ronaldo real fanboy
Sergio Ramos the dumpiest one.. Idiot
Ronaldo must be thrice on the list.
Where's neymar and jordi Alba and ronaldo??
Want to dive??  Join barca
Maybe u forget the most drivest in the world
"Where is PENALDO
UR HIS FAN 
DONT BE LIKE THIS
I AM A BARCA FAN BUT I ACCEPT THE DIVING OF SUÃREZ AND BUSQUETS BUT U SHOULD PUT RONALDO THERE SHOULD NO PARTIALLITY"
No era penal :v
OMG Ronaldo made a million dives,that one against Celta none can Forget but not even his single dive included,Ronaldo fan page
well you should make impossible not dives moments to forget
Where are messi's dive ????ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
Stupid players dumb ones ahahha
Where is Ronaldo's dive against Celta Vigo?
Ronaldo needs a whole video to show his dives collection, that's why he's not here. But you can always take a look at few examples here https://youtu.be/8jxKYO_ymt0
If you get hit in the neck or the face, I wouldn't call it a dive
And deli Alli's dive against Huddersfield today lol
Typical Ronaldo FanBoy
Where is cr7 he is the best diver in world in last 20 years
Mmmm , no sergio ramos in the list
Ronaldo king of dive
I'm surprised he didn't put a Ronaldo dive in it or more than 1 dive of Real Madrid
One of the biggest reasons I do not watch soccer. I do not need to see grown men at like 3 year olds on a tantrum.
uefalona always diving tho XD!
Strootman vs Lazio I think was the worst one ever
I'm not saying ramos didn't dive but you can see already before ramos falling cuadrado was turning to apologize so he did at least touched his foot haha
Jordi alba ?
"Where is Ronaldo's dive? 
And especially marcelo's against Wolfsburg"
Vidal  whose not fake
Put Ronaldo in the list idiot admin
Robbem didnt diveðŸ˜‚the other player clearly stept on his foot
"Pathetic channel 
this guy is a ronaldo fan ðŸ˜‚ or maybe he forgot him."
cuadrado stepped on ramos foot thats why ramos  went down . Maybe he was too angry because he got owned with a very clean and nice tackle
0:50 it's not dive !!!!!!!!  1:41 it's not dive !!!!!!!!!!!
0:29 is FOUL
wow no ronaldo on the list........'Madridiot' detected
"Seargo Ramos was the real one if you watch from
other side the other player stepped on his shoes"
One of the reason I don't like Ronaldo is coz he dives, you will find out the reason he is not In the list by watching the uploaders profile picture
"For the Suarez one:
I am a Barca fan and I agree that it was a dive, however if you look at the clip again, even if Suarez didn't dive it would still be considered as a foul. So I'm just making a point, I still agree that he dived but it would've been a foul anyways."
Suarez 's dive is disgrace...he should be banned for football
Where is penaldo??..the famous useless diver ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
About the Sergio Ramos video you can see that the player who  steps on Sergio's feet is saying sorry that means he really steps his foot
Number 4 so funny
The one before the first one was not a dive
Im a Madrid fan but there should be Ronaldo and Ramos shouldnt because Cuadrado stepped on his foot .. Ramos was holding his foot when he was on the ground
Dolphinaldo?
no ronaldo = auto dislike
No Penaldo wtf
ADRIAN WASINT A DIVE
Timo werner against schalke :D?
Ronaldo?.. The king of dives
Im surprised not even 1 ronaldo dive was shown.  Hahaha STUPID
NO ERA PENAL
Of course no ronaldo
Divenaldo Vs Celtic?
I saw that dive at the game real marid vs Juventus ramos dived and the side line ref was right in front of them like if agree
Me mata vidal en su epoca con la cocaina y todavia tiene la decencia de pedir penalti ahhaha
Where is Penaldo
"It's funny that you add Suarez vs PSG, Busquets vs Inter which aren't ""dives"". 

I know now everybody remembers it as a dive, but there are enough footages that show Marquinhos did clip his leg and Marquinhos wasn't even aware of where the ball is (the ball comes from behind and he focuses on Suarez). Pause on 0:56 (just after the screen went black) and look at Marquinhos. The ball is played from behind him and he is looking the other way (he doesn't even know where the ball is), whereas you can clearly see Suarez is following the path of the ball. You can also see Marquinhos move his arm across Suarez (what business does his arm got to do there?) and you can see, although very difficult as this is full speed that he clips Suarez' right calf with his left leg, which brings him down. It's actually a textbook foul. I also wouldn't see any reason for Suarez to go down aswell, as he would've had a clear scoring opportunity.

Suarez exaggerated, but it wasn't a dive.

The same goes for Arturo Vidal. How can you call that a dive, when you clearly see he kicked into the ground, which is why he fell down? He thought that he kicked Illaramendi, that's why he pointed at him, it's pretty simple. Do you really think Vidal is that stupid that he purposely kicks into the grass and then tries to say it's Illarmendi who did it?

Again, same for Busquets. It's not a dive as he clearly dit get Motta's hand on his face. He did exaggerate though, but these things happen like nearly every match. The only reason why people keep calling this a ""dive"" and Busquets a ""diver"" is because he peeked afterwards. I don't know why that should mean it's a dive. Motta shouldn't put his arm/hand out like that.

If you really played football, you would know this. It can happen that you see a player who tries to block your shot and you kick the grass. As we are humans, our brain sometimes automatically connects things. As we feel that we hit something and we saw at the same thing a player stretching their leg, our brain (sometimes) thinks that it was the leg of the player which was what you kicked. 

Same goes for the Suarez ""dive"". Anybody who plays football knows that when they are running full speed to hit the ball, a small ""clip"" of the legs can bring you down. That's exactly what happened here, Marquinhos hit Suarez' calf and denied Suarez a clear opportunity on goal. The only thing what Suarez did here was exaggerate and act like he was shot. But in the end the reaction comes after the action. The action which led to Suarez exaggerating was Marquinhos who clipped him, without going for the ball/knowing where the ball is (clear foul). The reaction shouldn't matter. 

Another example. Let's say a player gets a two footed tackle on his leg, but he doesn't fall or go down, he just continues his run. Does that now somehow mean the two-footed tackle isn't a foul? No, it shouldn't matter wheter you act like you died, you fly ten foot in the air or continue like nothing happened, a foul is a foul. 

Hope you guys get what I mean. A real dive is when you go down with no contact. Not when you accidentally kick into the ground and think you were hit by a player or when you exaggerate despite the fact you are being clipped and denied a goalscoring opportunity by a defender who doesn't even attempt to play the ball.

I would even go so far to say that nearly half of those aren't dives. Exaggerating contact/fouls isn't diving. Diving is faking contact and fouls. There are worse examples than these."
Why is ramos last when hr should 1
where is the "GOAT" penaldoooooooooooooo.....
cant wait to ronaldo top ten dives...

I'M TRIGGERED!"
I think they made a mistake with the Ducks logo, they changed their logo in 2006 and 2013, not 2011.
Did this get updated? Last time I watched this video the golden knights weren't created yet.
I miss the slug
No real growth after WWII (as there was post WWI), but then in 1967 hockey seems to explode.  What are the conditions that made that happen?
Hi
Whose idea was it to put an ice hockey team in Las Vegas, in the state of Nevada where there is miles of desert?
Coming soon in 2020, Quebec Nordiques replace the Colorado Avalanche. Or, Seattle replace Carolina Hurricanes. Those 2 teams, NEED TO BE GONE.
Rip Whalers
Got chills when I saw Vegas
Great job!
Excellent.
Vegas #1
Is it wrong to like to hockey teams? Figure this is the best place to ask
Go Avalanche!!!!!
Will you guys make another once it's been confirmed that Seattle gets a team and settled logo?
seattle and portland > others
You forgot the Kenora Thistles. They won the Stanley Cup in 1907
Go golden knights
Golden nights  are gonna win the Stanley cup
That was some sweet graphic work!!! Props to the NHL team....
Here come Seattle
How the franchises can move to another state or country ? don't they belong to the city where they are? Actually i find it shame sorry.
42-67 - 25 years of amazing rivalries.
Seattle would be lit for a new team.
Kudos to the NHL for making this cool video. Many fans are still bitter over some of the team moves (Nordiques, Whalers, Jets, North Stars) and some pro leagues would just whitewash this part of their past. It may be too honest about NHL history. I think every hockey fan would like to pretend the Buffaslug never happened.
Who disliked this video
Screw Norm Greene for ripping our team away from us! Bring back our North Stars!! It's ridiculous how you someone can have the guts to rip a team away from such an amazing state! #Stateofhockey #Wearethetruenorth
Hockey actually started at 1894... Great eh?!
Good video!
Thank You Fans for all of the years of NHL
Any ducks fans watching?
I miss the Kansas City Scouts.
Montreal CanadiensðŸ˜
I didn't know that the devil's used to be in Colorado
#BringBackNordiques
What happen to the original 6?
LETS GO PENS FOR 2018-2019
Do AHL and Echl expansion
U may have to update on 2019 if the Seattle rumors r true
Capitals logo I think went back to the one today a bit earlier
what a great story.. Canadian and American working together, Seattle is about to join the club =D
wonder some move around like phoenix
Ive been a lifelong maroons fan, we're dying for out team back !
I cry every time
Beautiful ending... Go Knights Go
hey man
That fan centennial was in Pittsburgh when I went to flyers vs pens stadium series in 2017!
Ridiculous Wisconsin has no team
unreal
The habs stayed all the time
This is still cool to watch!
Bring Atlanta a team again PLEASE!
Minnesota Wild's logo never changed lol
i hate predators its scary
the old logos
bringing back...
why not you commment on me
00:12 losed out
:)
red wings :)
rip trashers 1999 2011
nope quebec nordiques is in bhl
This is. Extremely COOOL
GO CAPS
I love this music! What is it? I couldn't find it anywhere in the description or comments.
e x p a n d  l e a g u e
If you pause the video at 2:02 and look closely, you can actually see my 13 year-old heart breaking.
Great video..I really enjoyed thisðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜
great video
2020 Seattle! Let's go!
It is beatiful to see how NHL was born
Stupid
Love how Philly kept their logo pretty much the same
Did you notice that on 0:25 of the video , look in PA.The Pirates are a MLB team since 1887
I love hockey and I love this video THX for making this!!!
Best team ever the one in the windy city.  Go Hawks
What did you make this with
Proof the "Original Six" is a myth.
3:10 who had the guts to make such a big logo change
As an NHL fan from Europe I never understood how you Canadian and American fans put up with teams being moved all over the country. If my local team which I supported for many many years suddenly moved to the other side of the country and took on a new name I'd be majorly pissed off...
As a devils fan I think they should move the flames out of Calgary and move them to Atlanta
What about the Seattle team that won the cup in 1917? Or don't you count them?
Well this season there probably happy that happened their old franchise which is now the Arizona Coyotes stunk this season the new team that they moved from Atlanta to Winnipeg has a shot at the Stanley Cup still. Wound up being a blessing in disguise.
Couldn't they redo this video but with the WHA teams included?
So dope
Rip thrashers
In a Nutshell music XD
Nice great work thanks very informative
Huge empty space North west , hoping for Seattle team soon
Come back WHALERS !!!!
Am I the only one who wished they stuck with the 1992's penguins logo?
What's the music?
Toronto since day 1
That's a lot of changes there, eh
Someone needs to make one of these for the NFL!
Great video
Nice
Great just Great
Where the hell is New Brunswick,  Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia on that map?
Didnt know that the Red Wings wernt always valled Red Wings nice
Let's get a team in utah or oregon
Where's the Seattle metropolitans
Come to Indianapolis, we'd love an NHL team!
So the 'Original Six' is really the 'Original One'?
Flyers was the only logo that never changed
This is an interesting video. Hard to follow because of all that damn franchise relocation but I love it none the less.
I know this is old, but I just wanted to point out that the Anaheim Ducks changed their logo in 2007, not 2011 like the video shows
So I guess Vancouver is due for a new logo soon.
Seattle before Quebec City....the love of money over hockey...I get the business aspect but in the same time it is ludacris behavior from NHL management to keep sinking teams in struggling markets over a devoted fan base.
AWESOME. ðŸ˜‹
I love this video. Born in Austin TX, but strangely I liked the Minnesota North Stars even before they moved to Dallas TX.
God I love this sport
"I was born in 1996 in August. We moved from Canada in 2011 to Michigan. The Jets always start to lose when I walk in the room. I think I am a curse. I feel like I need to banish myself and go live in the dessert of arizona. 
Despite all that I feel extremely lucky. I got chills when it showed the thrashers move to Winnipeg because I could finally be alive simultaneously with the jets. Not to mention the moose are back too, and I have always cheered for them. We are doing amazing this year in both leagues and we have done amazing this year, not to mention that I live in grand rapids where the Moose have a playoff series against the Griffins! This is an awesome time to be alive for me. It does make me sad to see how much money in the American market influences where teams go but at least Winnipeg got lucky enough to get nhl again. We have awesome fans and I'm glad we are willing to drop cash seconds after ticket sales are available and sell out instantly. We love our team and will continue to show support for the nhl with our wallets, because that is what it takes to keep a team in the end."
}3 bring back the whalers!
The music made me cry lol
The original Winnipeg Jets '79. Classic.
Cool video
Song name?
Alright sooo.... whos idea was it to relocate the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas because it is dosent fit in Dallas
Rip minnesota north stars
Bring back Hamilton
This video needs more views
I miss my North Stars :(
Detroitâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸
Leafs!!!!
"love it
#NHLhistory"
Bruins and Canadiens stayed true from the beginning
I can't wait for the nhl to finally expand to Toronto.
That's cool
"1917: purely located in the south-east of canada

2018: most of the teams are american and no canadian team has won the cup for nearly 25 years (even teams located in california and florida won a few)"
Thumbs up if the best part was the mighty ducks becoming the ducks
Nice vidjayo, I'd love to see who won the cups during all those years
low key fav part of video is music
Song?
I got an idea team name: Seattle Grizzlies
Poor Atlanta
"I'm so mad about them moving the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas.











Also the music tho...
So GOOD!"
For some reason I always get chills when I watch this video
can we please put a team back in Atlanta and leave it there
Wisconsin needs a team
HAMILTON USED TO HAVE A TEAM?????
I've watched this 20 times trying to get all this info in my brain hole, (I love hockey,ðŸ˜)
the importance of transportation
"Wich team do you want back? Quebec for me.
Quebec Nordiques
California Golden Seals
Artford Whalers
Atlanta Trashers
Minesota North Stars"
Anyone notice how Alberta is upside down?
Knights has 1 history
If you hate the NHL then that's person is stupid
Call me an idiot but I only just realized that the Minnesota Wild logo is in the shape of a wolf. Whoa..
I hope the nordiques return
THe Vegas Golden Knights is my new favorite hockey team to watch now, good luck in the playoffs
Never forgive the North Stars
Only thing missing is marking the nhl champion each year, that would have been awesome
Cooooooooool
2:10 DID U SEE THAT UGLY LOGO
i love this video
#100nhl
When does Hamilton get their team back?
that black and white black hawks though. omg im hard af
that whalers move still pisses me off to no end even after 20 years
They mist Saskatoon blues
Please give atlanta another team. So it can be moved again to quebec lol
Damn if Saskatchewan somehow got a team that'd be insane
Surprised Seattle never had a team..
Uh, where were the Vancouver millionaires?
"NHL Logic: Lets Whalers move from Hartford to the South.

Same NHL:  Trips over themselves, foaming at the mouth to keep Coyotes in Arizona."
I want the 1920 Hamilton tigers logo on a hoodie or something. One of my favorite logos of all time.
This USA stupid video
Im pretty sure michigan is the only state where its sports teams have never left the state, and are all downtown now
"This expansion business isn't right. California? Florida? Carolina? Cmon. I want everybody to make their bucks and I know this is a business but it feels like pure commercial exploitation.

If you want more teams fine, I like that more kids can get a shot at the big leagues, but you can't put it in places where there's no hockey culture. This isn't a McDonald's franchise."
wow it only took colorado 6 years to win a stanley cup
2:16 bastards....
What is that little black area near all of the Californian teams? Also I think Seattle should get the next team
Wow
The oilers were not created in1970
"now the the million dollar question is
who's next to join the NHL"
Quite unfortunate! that hockey today has been completely spoiled by the NHL monopoly money and markets. They should have keep the WHA organization.Too many teams today, they could create two leagues of around 17 teams instead of almost 34 teams.It would be really interesting to see at  the end of a season a real battle between the NFL-WHA two associations.  I hope this idea will come back again and that teams in cities like  Kansas City, Quebec, Fort Lauderdale Panthers, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Ottawa, Islanders, Hamilton, Columbus, Seattle, Anaheim, Winnipeg, Minnesota, Buffalo, Washington, Calgary, Nashville would leave the NHL for this new hockey association. And also bring a complete review of salary mass and drafts methodology.
2:58 rip my childhood
Any VGK fans?
See there is no original six lol
I love this video smðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™#goleafsgoðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
lol this vid is great but it will be outdated in 2-4 years when nil expands to Seattle/Quebec
Go maroons lol
Where are the capitals
Beautiful video history. Thanks NHL!
The New Jersey Devils :)
Who's stupid idea was it to move one of the ONLY Connecticut sport teams to CAROLINA!!!
So it took until the 70s for Ohio to have a team only to have it stripped from them, and then it took until 2000 for a permanent team to be in Ohio, and then they choke every chance they get.
Houston will be next.
Its so cool to see how the nhl has evolved over the years. LETS GO RANGERS
If none of the teams moved or left. We would have 53 total teams..
Houston Aeros will be next
I feel like an episode of Game of Thrones is about to start when I'm watching this
That was awesome
They should do that for the NBA, NFL, MLB, and MLS
In 1917 the most NHL teams  were mostly Toronto
Uhhh you forgot the Seattle Metropolitans
So beautiful ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜ Question though -- why is it that when I try to share this on FB it comes up as "incomplete"?
Stop ðŸ‘ðŸ» putting ðŸ‘ðŸ» hockey ðŸ‘ðŸ» teamsðŸ‘ðŸ» in ðŸ‘ðŸ» placesðŸ‘ðŸ» where ðŸ‘ðŸ» nobody ðŸ‘ðŸ» likes ðŸ‘ðŸ» hockey ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Never seizes to amaze me that Americans put ICE hockey teams in the deserts.
All of the 90s Logos were the best... Sabres, Mighty Ducks, Penguins, Yotes.
What a cool video!!
Song
Can I just mention that in 1993 I believe. Disney bought a expansion team just to have a hockey team named after a hockey movie they made two years earlier. @anahiemducks.
You guys forgot the #halifaxhighlanders
90's pens logo was the best
RIP St.Louis red eagles only 1 year in history
I had the playback speed at .25 and it was much better. Thank you for this video, what history!
#Seattleexpansion
I wish NHL in Atlanta was still a thing. Boo
Happy 100th Anniversary, NHL.
YAH NASHVILLE PREDATORS
i wish all of the teams back then stayed and are still here today
Vegas?
came back to watch this awesome video. anyone know what that music is? sounds like it'd be great to work out to.
161 people live in Quebec City or Seattle
2:03 My least favorite part I don't like the Dallas Stars, but I did like the mn north stars, but man I do like 2:49
oilers never changedðŸ˜‚
This was extremely sick
Wait, Ducks and others changed their logo twice in the same year, and Detroit never since 20s
Seattle soon?
Awesome
Where's the flyers?
So stupid how a team can move location completely or change heir whole identity. Gets rid of the heritage.
Jackson
I would be more into hockey if Milwaukee actually had a team.
To be honest the NHL should bring a lot more Canadian teams and get some American teams away like (Arizona, New York Islanders etc..) but they should put in some cities like (OrangvilleðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚if possible, Quebec , Halifax, Manitoba..)
So much i didint know.Now imma just wait for new teams
1:59 Bettman starts
Caps should change their logo
It was so chilling to see the Thrashers logo move from slow to fast up to Winnipeg with that music in the background... probably because it was my first relocation when I was a fan of Hockey and actually born lol
Were the shraks good back then
R.I.P OAKLAND SEALS 1976-1979
st. Louis eagles!
i cant believe that the ATL thrashers were still around in 2011
When the Montreal Canadiens have outlasted the Soviet union
"For those of you who have not heard. The Islanders are staying in the NYC metro area and moving back to Long Island at the landmark Belmont Park racetrack by around thr 2021-'22 season. Here link to prove it.

Thus sorry for places like Hartford, Quebec City, Kansas City, Houston and the Pacific Northwest (Seattle or Portland.)Thus only chance in near future i.e next 5-10 years is to get the next expansion or a struggling team i.e Carolina or the South Fla. Panthers."
Feels like a strategy game. The ancient civilization of the St-Lawrence river conquering the then known world.
Awesome video!  I love the history in the sport of hockey.  Seeing all the logo changes through the years is neat too! Well done!!
Right now, if I was the GM, I would move The Coyotes to Seattle. Move the Hurricanes to either Quebec City or back to Hartford. Then expand to Kansas City and bring back the Scouts!
I don't know if it's just me but I don't think the Washington Capitals are in there
San JosÃ© sharks cade os br porra
Why is the first 6 B, n, m, t, c, d,  when Ottawa had a team before them
2:35 wow the nhl acknowledged the existence of the thrashers. This should go up in the rafters along with "2007 division champions" and "Not being last in attendance in 2004"
Les nordiques de Quebec :(
Amazing video
This is actually kind of sad
Loved it great more can you guys do more?
Very cool
Mighty Ducks>>>>>>>>>Ducks. Facts only. Also, relocate the Coyotes to Halifax, the Hurricanes to Quebec City and the Panthers to Regina.
Wher's the rest of the world
Very nice video
"Possible places for NHL teams (my opinion):
-Seattle
-Hartford
-Quebec
-"
BRING BACK THE QUEBEC NORDIQUES
Detroit had the same logo since 1967
Where's my fellow hubs fans eh? #canadian
#GoKnightsGo !
epic video like
My good ol' bruins staying the same throughout the years! Amazing!
YEAH! VEGAS HAS THE LOUDEST ARENA, AND FOR OUR FIRST YEAR, WE WERE TOUGH!
My friends grandpa is the buffalo sabres announcer
"thanks for making this. please make more like it. ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
#historyofNHL #NHLhistory"
Who got dumped in exchange for vegas
Whats gotta happen in nhl un 2018?
Well done
2025 please welcome the Seattle unkown to the NHL
Man, vancouver got hosed on traveling til like the 80's lol
......Seattle Metropolitans.......first Stanley cup winners
Bettman more like Buttman get it...
"Carolina to Quebec 
Florida to Connecticut 
Arizona to Seattle 
Maybe I'll start watching this shitshow of league again"
Very cool video. Spotted a mistake though. The ducks changed name in 2006, not 2011. Other than that, it's cool to see all the changes including logo changes. A few Montreal logo changes were missed, but mostly spot on.
1 more team to go and then 32. I think it will be in Seattle, but I think it should be in Canada. They need more teams over there.
I miss my Whalers
The admirals?
What's the song?
Way too many teams. Most rinks half empty, TV ratings low, so many marginal players, so little scoring now. 16 teams would be plenty.
lol who i nthe world would move the jets to hot dry land arizona?!
Give then a nhl team for seattle
Notice the expansion in the 60's to the west coast , probably only made possible because of the fact of affordable air travel , so the Aviation industry definitely had a major factor in any expansion of any sport at that time.  what an amazing time to be a witness too. wish I was there...
Anyone watching in fall 2017
Colorado Avalanche best logo in hockey!
Let's put a team in Houston they are all set and ready to go all they need is the unis a name and a fanbase let's go Houston
Very nicely done ..and great music to go with it.
Dope Video
NHL I've got an 2019 expansion team name it's called The Houston Eagles (I hope you read this comment)
bring back the hamilton tigers to the nhl
Why did the First Jets move to Arizona... but then the Jets come back different!? Retired Numbers ever have a thought?! Gary Bettman... the man of this... why... "MONEY!! Hockey? Dunno what that is." NO OFFENSE NHL! :)
Incredible video
y'all gonna have to make another one for Houston smh
The Dallas sta s didn't change their logo until 2013 not 2014
Still hard to believe that Atlanta moved to Winnipeg in 2011 I feel like that's not that long ago
I mean, that's not where the panthers are, but still a really good video. Impressive work.
"1996 ðŸ™
2011 ðŸ˜ƒ"
Best part 1:58
I'm a Bruins fan, but I think Seattle's team should be the Sea Lions (if they have one)!
This was so hard to follow I had to keep pausing and rewinding to c all of the teams but it was still pretty cool seeing all the old teams
Houston is going to be added on to this soon
Video was sick
if anything . by 2020 or 2025. it should be . Carolina Hurricanes move to Houstan to became the Houston Hurricanes . LOL or Houstan Aeros.  then move Florida panthers to Quebec City to become the Quebec city nordiques . next .  add the Hartford Whalers back as a expansion .  which will balance the divisions. Then later on. Move Arizona to Seattle to become the Seattle Emeralds.. keep it balanced. then if any expansion teams came into the fold. Milwaukee if anything so they can become rivals with Minnesota .  Portland , Oregon.. or San Francisco to become rivals with San Jose. like ducks and kings.  Kansas City / Hamilton Ontario or Salt Lake City or Providence though they will need a better arena in providence.
Quite the video
Gotta love living in Wisconsin being a die hard hockey fan
Do you think if universal basic income becomes a thing, we will someday see a World Hockey League (WHL) and the NHL will be a farm league?
Where's Washington at?
lets go lightning 2017-2018
2017 Vegas Golden knights
Why is the music so dramatic? what is this inception?
Need a Team in SaskatchewanðŸŒ¾ðŸšœðŸš¨ðŸ’
You forgot the Victoria Cougars
Who misses the thrashers?
Carolina Hurricanes <3
original 6 baby
Next few years it's Quebec or Seattle but should Quebec deserves one especially when we need another Canadian team to contend.
Who else noticed the fact that they skipped on of tampas logos?
Vegas Golden Knights is a surprising team in long winning streak before Dansk got injured.
Thrashers :(
The music is very Gravity Falls like. Go Blues!
Next expansions: Omaha, New Mexico, Hawaii, Cairo.
actually the Colorado Avalanche were founded in 1972 and joined the franchise is 1979 and were originally the Quebec Nordiques
Hawks were original 6
Funny how a lot of these teams became other sports teams like the Rockies and the tigers in the mlb and CFL
I love Canada my country everyone here has to love hockey it's so fun
The music fits along with the video. And when they finally put the golden knights there, I went "ahh"
Rangers Is best
1991, my team is born :D #sharksforlife
I Liked The Old Thrashers Logo
bring back Quebec Nordiques, Whalers and the old Anaheim Ducks logo
2:09 sad moment ;(
Wow what a great league and needs more attention than basketball and football
Change the name of the colorado avalanche to the Colorado ROCKIES!!!
Now there should be Golden knights
But this video is incredible.
Would've been cool of you moved the islanders from long island to Brooklyn.
It was not even the origanal 6 at the beginning
Oakland Seals!  Hey NHL!  I know you want another western team and the Oracle Arena is perfect.  It's pretty modern and NHL has grown quite well over the last few decades in the Bay Area.  Good rivalry for San Jose Sharks too!  I know there are plenty of options for team #32, but please consider bringing back the Oakland Seals (perhaps Golden State Seals?) while you evaluate. :D
cool
anyone watching this after the las vegas golden knights?
GO BOLTS
For anyone that thought it went too fast, it was great at 1/4 speed using YouTube settings...  Some of the logo changes didn't actually LOOK much like changes but some were very cool to see.
The Milwaukee Admirals would be a cool team to add.  They would give the Blackhawks and Wild a nearby rival.
love those 70's logos
Predators the one logo that never changed
I MISS FLUERY
So awesome! Just wish it was a little slower
bring back the thrashers
NHL I have  a question how did I'm a leafs fan how did they make the original 6
0:46 good lord... 30 years with 6 teams?! That's cool but it must have been boring
I wanna die every time 2:10
RIP Atlanta Thrashers
Philadelphia Quakers?  Really?  That is the least intimidating name for a hockey team.
Arizona team? Might as well add a team in the Northwest Territories or Yukon while your at it
that was cool
#teamsforalaska
I think they missed the 2017-18 Quebec Nordiques expansion team
I would to see Seattle as of 32nd team in the NHL team. Maybe they are discussing of adding two more teams to 34 teams in the NHL. Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques back in the NHL teams as of 33rd and 34th teams. Move the Detroit Red Wings from the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference to the Central Division of the Western Conference. This will balance of 17 teams in each Conferences. Connecticut has 1,000 people per square mile.
Why only add one more team?
GO SHARKS EST 1991 BOI
ðŸ™caps just one cup. I wanna die happy
I can't believe the Ottawa Senators were actually one of the four original teams! Sad that they had to leave :(
Why is this so emotional
cool
I hear only this out of adding or relocating teams: BLAH BLAH NO DESERT BLAH QUEBEC hARTFORD BlAHAbFJAefbJf
I know a lot of history even before the NHL but to put into one video is amazing.
I love this song can anyone link me to the actual song on YouTube or something.
And Milwaukee Still doesn't have a teamðŸ˜­
HARTFORD WHALERS like it you agree
Rest in peace Quebec Nordiques, Hartford Whalers and Atlanta Thrashers
Amazing video. Absolutely loved how they showed the logo changes, and I like how some teams logos either barley changed or not at all (Detroit, Montreal, Sharks). Very enjoyable video. Can't wait to see what the Knights will do this year. Go Habs Go!
Ramener le Nordiques ! / Bring back the Nordiques !
I typed a 80 page paper on every hockey team from 1887-Future.
"Just a few things I'd like to note

While they got the end of Cleveland correct, they merged into the North Stars, wasn't the founding of San Jose a split from Minnesota

Also, the rebranding of Mighty Ducks of Anaheim happened way before 2011, they became the Anaheim Ducks in 2007, as they won the Stanley Cup while being just the ""Ducks"""
2:16 I cried
if the nhl can do it the other luages can do it
This is one of the coolest videos I've ever seen
#Bringbackthewhalers There was a big rivalry between the Whalers and Bruins that always sold tickets in Hartford along with the Rangers. There's close to 200,000 avid NHL fans in the Hartford-New Haven area, similar to markets like Columbus, Raleigh, Nashville, Miami, and Vegas. Hartford-New Haven is the largest market without a big four franchise (nearly had one but the Pats scammed us). The close proximity to both New York and Boston means those rivalries have a chance to be rekindled. There's talks about the Islanders leaving New York. They have to compete with the Rangers, Devils, Nets, Knicks, Giants, Jets, Yankees, and Mets for airtime in New York. But in Hartford they only have to compete with the Bruins, Yankees, Mets, and Red Sox plus any football game on national television (as someone who lives in New England near New York, I can tell you that it costs money to get MSG network). Believe me when I say this, there is still a MASSIVE group who wants to bring back the Whalers.
this was awesome
ðŸ’ðŸ¥…ðŸš¨
This is the most erotic video I've ever witnessed in my life
huh
"Suggestions: Move Knights to Seattle. Move Coyotes to Oregon. Move Hurricanes to Hartford. Move Lightning to Quebec. Move Panthers to Wisconsin. 
Oh and STOP EXPANDING TO PLACES WHERE THERE'S NO ICE OR ARE SHITTY PLACES FOR SPORTS TEAMS!!!"
the chill
The original Jets' logo is still one of, if not, the greatest in the NHL.
1:59 Gary Bettman destroys the NHL
Nice vid, but I like baseball better lol but still love Blackhawks
Let's be honest it's going to be 32 teams by the end of 2017-2018 season.
crazy to believe that the nhl was a tiny league with only 4 teams
Canada' needs more teams!:D
Mighty ducks or old school  coyotes? Who's jersey would you buy
#bringnhltoseattle
This must be one of the visually most confusing representations i have seen. A very bad job, hire some professionals next time.
Man bring back the Thrashers, but keep the Jets this time. I live in Cali and my team are the Sharks but man where the Thrashers where a great team to watch was quite the surprise when the moved back to Winnipeg
I was Awed with the first couple of decades then when 1967 Hit I was like WHOA!!! O_O
WE NEED MORE CANADIAN TEAMS!!!!
Whalers. Come back.
This was so cool If you agree like this comment
Bring Back Norduqies & Whalers.
Cool but too fast
Song pls
2:01 is the best moment, as that logo moves down from Minnesota to Texas!
The Caps changed to their now current logo in 2007, not 2011
Beautiful to see the camera freeze for an extra second on the original 6 at the beginning
This was really well done.
Nice vid
NHL Can you bring a team to Delaware,Bethlehem and BRING BACK THE THRASHERS PLEASEEEEEEE!
Nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Since 1917 montreal canadiens
Imagine if the golden knights won it all the first year
"Coyotes to Seattle
Panthers to Quebec city
Hurricanes back to Hartford
(MAYBE)Stars to either Milwaukie or Kansas city
(MAYBE)Golden Knights to Hamilton
(MAYBE)Islanders to Halifax"
How the hell does Wisconsin still not have a team?
Fun video
The Hartford whalers ;(
Columbus needs to become Hamilton tigers and one of the Florida teams needs to become Quebec nordiques and vegas needs to dissolve.
Only constant thing in the NHL from the start is the Montreal Canadiens!
Hartford Whalers, one of the best looking hockey jerseys
Give Cleveland a team!!!
R.I.P. Nordics,I hope they come back
I wish we had a team in Oregon, but we only have an NBA team ðŸ˜£
This is amazing and very interesting to watch thank you for putting this together
Great video
Still waiting for the Canucks to win a Stanley cup
I love the NHL & I believe it's the 2nd best managed sports league in North America. But I absolutely HATE how they have teams in the south & in the desert, doesn't make sense to me.
What about the Vancouver Millionaires???
One of the coolest videos on YouTube. Well done.
Quebec City should have a NHL team! It's bizarre that they do not have one. Also, the Hartford Whalers logo is the most interesting NHL logo. At first glance, it looks like a "W" with a whale fluke on top, but if you look closer, there's a "H" for Hartford there. A lot of folks notice the "W" and the fluke but not the "H"
Cmon bring basketball and hockey to Seattle ðŸ˜¡
0:59
"so...
 Anaheim is below San Jose thanks."
#BringBackTheWhalers
seattle >
still no team in washington?
notice how there is a lack of teams on the north-west side. There needs to be teams in portland, seattle, kansas and maybe even regina
I was kind of sad when the Whalers, North Stars and Nordiques folded. Those were great hockey club names, and the names that were coming in like Mighty Ducks (after a Disney movie), Coyotes, and Panthers just never sat well with me as far as aÂ Hockey club name.Â  This was such a fun video. Thank you for the effort!
2:50 my local team is created
You forgot the 2018 Quebec Nordiques ;P
Why would we put hockey in vegas but not Seattle Cleveland or Wisconsin
You didnt need to expand to Vegas. You already have enough teams struggling with attendence and then you put a team in a city with no link to hockey and nearly no link to professional sports.
please move vegas or carolina to Quebec
Hey I play for the Cleveland Barons!!! Lol select hockey
Ð²Ð¾Ð»ÑˆÐµÐ±Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð²Ð¸Ð´ÐµÐ¾!
bring back Quebec
I cried when the whalers moved #bringbackthewhalers
very cool and i am not even a hockey fan
This is mesmerizing.  Still not sure why the Atlantic Provinces aren't part of the video though. :P
gotta love the black and red of the 90s- slug was good to- florida to hartford - coyotes to Seattle- expand to quebec
Weren't the Oakland Seals originally called the California Seals (not "California Golden Seals" - that name was after Oakland, when Charles O. Finley bought the team)?
Saskatchewan needs an NHL team. Saskatoon could easily have an NHL team based in it. The Saskatchewan Rush (National Lacrosse League) and The Saskatchewan Riders (based in Regina, CFL) games are always nearly sold out, or sold out. Saskatchewan is full of people that love sports, and people that could easily support an NHL team.
Why does the new Florida panthers logo look like a soccer logo
best video ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You put Ottawa on the edge of USA not in canada
Sub to me and I'll sub back!
Kewl.. so the jets relocated then came back
A little more change is needed. Arizona becomes Nordiques and Florida becomes Whalers. Then everything is complete.
2:11 that moment when all quebec people cry
Just perfect, love the music too!
This is one of my favorite vids ever and I'm an NFL fan
I hope the NFL, MLB, and NBA also do this.
Bring back the Nordiques
who's excited for the Vegas Golden Nights? :)
Bring back the Quebec Nordics by moving Phoenix or Tampa
Love these types of videos.
Love it
They forgot the 2nd gen Lightning logo smh
2018 la knights

How to kill a winter sport in the span of 50 years
Can't Wait To Go See My Sin City's New NHL Team Las Vegas GOLDENKNIGHTS Been Waiting For a team for Vegas since I moved here 16 years ago from L.A
The saddest part by far is when the thrashers moved
Bring back the Thrashers
Great video, but a nice finish would be to showcase the las vegas team
nhl needs more canadian teams!
What a great vid. Awesome seeing teams move rather than just close shop.
Love the music
Wow that was really cool, brought back old memories of the north stars :( wish they would have stayed...
Bruins original logo was so 1940s yellow
Way too fast! I'm dizzy.
Ottawa  Senators is the best
3:24
ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
oilers 1974 not 1979
great video
I hate how Nashville is brand new and they can make it to a Stanley cup and how the caps are like 40 years old and made it to one Stanley cup and got swept
what about the Oklahoma City Barons ( I know that they are disbanded now but they should have been at least on the map when they did play )
From the formation of the NHL to now has been 100 years, and those were some amazing 100 years. Some might say that those 100 years were the best 100 years, that's because hockey is the greatest game known to man.
Bring Qubec or Hartford. Just no more south west or south east teams
Bring Qubec or Hartford. Just no more south west or south east teams
Bring back Qubec
How do you slow it down
Bring back the thrashers!
One of the coolest sports history videos I've seen...EVER!  Spectacular job, especially with the evolving logos!
that was actually very well done. the north stars never should of never left minnesota, whalers should still be there, and Quebec should have thier team back. Come on NHL get it done in Quebec at least I did in my nhl 17 game I moved the hurricanes to Quebec. sell out every game so far haha
Go Kings Go!
Dear NHL, Puck Las Vegas, Bring back the Kansas City Scouts!
I feel like every major league should have a video like this. Great job guys ðŸ‘ the NHL has come a long way in 100 years, hopefully you return to Kansas City someday, we miss our Scouts.
now let's get the Seattle Thunderbirds into the league to balance it at 32!

Wow I always assumed that the original 6 were the first teams.
How to succeed with the golden nights: move them to Quebec
was i the only one that completely forgot about the atlanta thrashers
RIP Seattle Metropolitans
Sad Atlanta has no hockey club
AWESOME it's sad I still have nhl 16 I want nhl 17 so bad
Reason why all these teams moved is due to the arena conditions. I know many of you want to see cities like Hartford and Seattle get franchises, and perhaps the market is there. But you need an arena! That's what the owners care about. Fan experience. So they keep buying tickets. Places like Kansas City, Houston, and Milwaukee have good arenas and will create natural rivalries with the Blues, Stars, and Blackhawks respectively.
RIP Thrashers :(
what's the music
Awesome
kings need to go back to purple and gold
"cool stuff!
anaheim became ducks in 2006"
F I R E  B E T T M A N
Why am I watching this? If I don't know anything bout hockey.
they should have a seatte NHL team beside las vegas
we need more canadian teams, but we have bary gettman in office.
Great job by whomever made this awesome video. I would love to see one made for each of the other major sport leagues (NBA, MLB, NFL, MLS). Fingers Crossed
The Golden Knights begs an important question: Why dies the NHL expanded into markets that don't want hockey, and keep teams in markets that don't care for hockey (Coyotes, Hurricanes, Panthers to name a few), when places like Quebec City, Saskatoon, and Victoria in Canada would all support a franchise well and better?
I wish Atlanta still had a team :( .....
What? There was a Pittsburgh hockey team before the Pens?
3 cities that should have a team. Salt Lake city, Seattle, and Quebec move failing franchises there if expansion isnt a good idea
I still can't believe there is going to be a team in Vegas next year. Would have been nice to bring back the Nordiques or the Whalers. From what I read they had big fan bases, heck even today when I'm out somewhere I occasionally spot a Nordqiues or Whalers hat. Both cities have arenas that are probably capable of holding an NHL franchise. Oh well.
Forgot the NYR Statue of Liberty logo that was my favorite ðŸ˜“
PENGUINS!!!!!!!!
LET'S GO HARTFORD WHALERS!!!
Great video. Should have been 10 minutes, and explained each move, or expansion.
Ok, the rest of you leagues have some work to do...
didnt know people actually cared about hockey
Made me a bit nauseous but besides that it was gr8
Long live Canada. We need more Canadian teams and one Canadian team need another Stanley Cup. Last time in 1993? It's been too long. And that was us.
all spots leaves need to do these
it would be cool if the seals came back
Props to the Red Wings and Blackhawks logos being virtually unchanged for so long. Talk about commitment! (yes, I know there's others, but none more prominent than those two)
The animation for the whalers logo was sick. Who doesn't want the whalers back?
I almost feel sorry for Atlanta even as a Calgary fan myself they have lost teams twice
Great video
NHL needs a team in Washington state
Don't understand why teams would move. But that's just me, I come from a city that have teams with deep roots.
Wouldn't it be nice if their was promotion / relegation system or not
Do this for the nba
Dump Arizona, bring back nordiques am I right!
One of the worst logo changes in history: Ducks 2011
Feel bad for Atlanta
can't wait until the Vegas knights get sold away after 1 or 2 seasons. bettman, I know all you care about is money but please make decisions that make sense for the sport of hockey. do you wanna be where the nfl is right now? don't think so.
They missed the Vancouver millionaires
that was a very good video
Make Minnesota great again. Bring back the North Stars
I wonder if the 32nd NHL team would be like soon?
I thought Atalanta had a couple teams? hahahahahaha
I wish there was a NHL team in Albuquerque
Search it up on wikipedia
Where's the Houston jets
85 soccer fans disliked
NO HOCKEY TEAM IN MEXICO! THATS RACIST!!!!!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
This is so cool
BUFFALO SABRES SABER TOOTH LOGO HELLO NHL
now just the ahl, lol
Bring the scouts back to KC. Thanks
Instead of the golden nights we should have got the whalers or the thrashers back
2:33
There should be a baseball one.
Why did I watch this I don't watch Hockey
Gary Bettman: I have a great idea! Lets expand to places where theirs no snow...
sexy
I need a houston team
I wish the Hurricanes stayed in CT. We got no professional sports teams. Our most relevant team is the Hartford Yard Goats
my how you've grown... And yet the black hawks still take home the Stanley cup.
Since the NHL has an uneven number of teams, I think they should move the Red Wings back to the Central (because they're nowhere near the Atlantic) and revive either the Nordiques or the Whalers.
How does Wisconsin still not have a team?
I thought I knew hockey until this video...seeing the teams that I never knew existed. truly a mind blowing video. good job
This is really cool! It's interesting to see how big this once tiny league has become and where many teams originated before they went where they are now.
Where are the Atlanta thrashers tho
One like= one respect for the Oakland Seals
And the Vegas Knights to continue the story...
Vancouver Millionaires?
bring back quebec city
a Hamilton Toronto rivalry would of been so goood
Great video! GO CAPS!!
cool
Bring NHL to PDX!
I wish the MLB, NFL, and NBA did a video just like this, this was cool.
It's sad how many cities lost their teams.
Oakland Seals!!!
Vegas knights?
Seattle, Quebec City, New Orlands, Atlanta, and Houston should have expansion teams. Toronto should have another team too.
um, someone tell me about the golden knights...
This is just sad..
Ugh, I want the whalers back in Hartford soooooo bad
Quick shoutout to SCREW WINNIPEG
So when are the Whalers coming back?
Great video
It still makes me sad seeing the Whalers gone. They were my team growing up and I cried when they moved to Carolina and it makes me feel even worse seeing how poorly their fan base is doing. I don't really have a favorite current hockey team anymore and I just cheer for the Rangers now because they were the next closest team to where I lived
Pittsburgh pirates NHL?
My team didn't come in till 1992 lol
The San Hose sharks were originally in worcestor
Beautifully done!! I cheered when I saw 1995 Nords change to Avs. Burgundy blood for life! Go Avs!
That, that was beautiful.....ðŸ˜°ðŸ˜°
Seattle should get a team before Vegas...
That was awesome
LOL. Phoenix is all the way down south? I didn't know that. Need to study North America. Always thought it was mid-US. Anyway, great video. Learned a lot.
Holy i learned alot
Houston, Hamilton, Brooklyn, Oakland, Atlanta, Cleavland, Quebec City, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Baltimore would all be good relocating sites
Can we all agree that the old coyotes logo was sick
I love how the flyers logo has never changed
Houston is the fourth largest market in the U.S. and has had success with hockey for decades. Why not give them an NHL franchise? Multiple cups won in different leagues. Some of the greatest of all time played there. Fan base already established. They supported the Aeros for many, many years. Give them back their Aeros. Houston makes more sense than Las Vegas, Quebec, or Seattle. If Florida and California can work, sure as water is wet Houston will work. Huge population, amazing sports city, years of support for hockey with the Aeros, a natural/intense rivalry with Dallas; you will have success there. The Aeros won more championships than any of the other pro sports teams there.
Quebec needs a new team, because I swear that they complain about not having one at least 100 random times a year on the news... So please... End their sufferings and just give them one...
you forgot the Houston Aeroes!
yeah go kings go
I really wish Seattle and Kansas City had a team. Blows my mind they chose Las Vegas. Not saying it won't work out but I see it as a non existing fan base and rather people only going as something to do while they're in Vegas.
This was alarmingly entertaining to watch. Wish every league did this. Hmu if they do
Sounds like the song had a turn signal in the background lol.
Stop putting teams in places where no one likes hockey
What the heck is that black splotch on the map? Am I the first to notice?
NEW TEAM THE GOLDEN KNIGHTS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Good job NHL now add some more teams in thoses empty spaces on the map
I'm still pissed we are the golden knights instead of a creative name. But idc Kings for life!
Made a mistake with Anaheim I'm pretty sure they changed their logo and name in 2006 not 2011
I absolutely love this video
Who are the Vegas golden knights ???
Golden knights?
fucken awesome video
This is awesome. I lovedit
Except for that they were the Alberta Oilers before the Flames moved to Calgary
"The sound in this video is amazing.

Andrea Carri â€“ Ritratti"
As much as I want to see the nordiques get a team again it's not happening Bettman ain't interested. Yah sure the canes,panthers and Arizona have low attendance but sorry to say Houston(Large T.V. Market) is way more likely to get an Nhl team then Quebec.
"Seattle, Portland, Houston, Kansas City, Atlanta or Another Florida Team (Jacksonville followed by Orlando) would be good places for another NHL team

Edit: Forgot about Quebec and Regina"
I loved how you went all the way to 2017
The old sens logo was BADASS
Best sport today
Who else remembers the Thrashers?
Bring back the nordiques
I love this video. It's cool to see all the logo changes and teams moving cities
boooooo the golden knights.
Wow
Poor Canada, we need more teams
I cringed at 2:03
made a few mistakes, like having the penguins and sabres appear before the blackhawkd but it was still good
bring back the Atlanta thrashers
Only missing one : The Quebec Nordiques ;)
I love the animations and that the Golden Knights were included.
"The  best logo in sports turned into a red blob 
#bringbackthewhale"
The Detroit Cougars use to be the Victoria Cougars.
Only good sport in America, from a fellow Swede :D
dallas and tampa should be the only southern teams, yes i know the canes won a cup and the preds most likely will too but let's be real here
Seattle and Quebec has to get their own teams
this is a realy good video
i hope preds will smash ducks
Go thrashers!
Time for Wisconsins huge hockey fan base to get the NHL team it deserves
They just fix these to promote vegas....
Music?
That's sooo cool
Wish Hamilton still had a team
Sick vid
You guys ruined my life by the whalers moving
- Awesome!! I've seen a lot of clips detailing the growth of the NHL through the years, but this one is the best one yet! :)
Bring back Hartford and Quebec!
You mean the Boston Bruins were originally BROWN & yellow?  (Maybe B's fans should just STFU about the Pengins then).  LOL
how does arizona and las vegas have hockey teams and maine doesnt?
I don't know if there is copyright/trademark issues with this, but it would sound much cooler if it was just the Vegas Knights. Has a good ring to it.
"Awesome!!! 

I'd like to watch this same thing but with the MLB, NFL and NBA."
I was not aware that the the Rockies became the Devils!
In the words of John Oliver "Cool."
What about the Victoria cougars? They were a team...
Anaheim changed their name in 2007 not 2011
This was very cool
Place a team in Helena, Montana.  1) That state needs a professional sports team.  2) It would bring the Western Division up to 16 teams.  3) It gets cold there.  4) The people there need something to do.  5) It would give some people a reason to visit Montana.  But what would their team name be?  Any suggestions?
What happens when world war 3 starts.will the nhl shut down the season?what will happen when the rapture happens? Will you still run the nhl after world choas?
Seattle could probably be a good hockey town
When the nordiques got traded...oh boy
Dat vegas golden nights was so unexpected gave me chills. Can't wait to see them play:)
Worst league in the world.
amazing 11/10
Wow this video is really satisfying
What was in Utah?
Imagine hockey in northern Canada
"This was a really good video. There can still be a good amount of future places for NHL teams.

Future Places For NHL Teams:

Kansas City
Salt Lake City
Atlanta
Baltimore
Cincinnati 
Cleveland
Milwaukee
Indianapolis
Portland, Oregon
Seattle
Quebec City
San Diego
Houston (most likely won't happen)
New Orleans (not a big hockey city)
San Francisco (it is close to San Jose, but has a chance)

This was a very long list and some cities like Houston and New Orleans will probably never get a NHL team because of it's location in the South. However, places like Seattle, Quebec City, and Milwaukee might get a NHL team in the future."
Ottawa kinda disappeared for like 50 years
awesome vid, but the ducks lost Thier mighty logo in 2006, not 2011
That music omg
Go SENS go
Houston
The golden ice as a name is very bad
it forgot the seattle metropolitans who actually one the stanley cup in 1917
Regardless the rivalries, the bad blood, the countless hours of wanting to kill another teams fans due to our teams being eliminated by theirs we have to agree on one thing, hockey is amazing. There's nothing like it. Go lightning âš¡
What is the name of the Background music?
I laughed when the golden knights appeared
Lol bring back hamilton
Song
Hello hockey fans I will be uploading every game of the conference final and Stanley cup final so check me out also if u sub I'll sub right back just let me know
THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING! love seeing how all the teams came through through out all these years!!!
did the vancouver millionaires ever  exist
Montreal Canadiens, the Original
Really cool animation, but they left out the Islanders move from Uniondale to Brooklyn.
Seeing how much land the Western Conference covers is jaw-dropping.  Nice to see the league's expansion history presented in this fashion.
Great job on the video! Fun and informative. loved seeing all the logo changes and early teams.
"we'll see you soon Quebec,
-Every Canadian teams but Montreal"
This feels like the opening to a show.
OLD BLACK AND RED SABRES LOGO > ANYTHING ELSE
This is hands down one of the best NHL video made.   Very well done.  Loved watching teams come in and logos change.  Amazing
Thrashers ðŸ˜¢ #BelieveInBlueland
very well done. thanks for making this
how the hell can 50 people dislike this video?
Quebec Nordiques COMEBACK PLEASE
So why are they called the original 6 then?
You show the Maple Leafs. Are they still in the NHL?
Does the league really need two teams in the "four corners" states?
Get teams back in Quebec and Hartford!!! Move the Coyotes and Panthers.
garrry betman so what is the nhl not doing next year oh right all star game and olimpycs i hate him
This is dope AF!
Any city could have a team all The would have to do is pay Garry Bettman a couple million under the table Quebec is the one that really deserves another team not vegas
You realize that the montreal Canadians were the team that hasn't changed once from start to finish
Very cool video!!! But damn who chose the background music for this? Sounds like a flip phone ringtone. Should have been more epic.
Beautiful... Nothing more.
1972-1995 Nordique de QuÃ©bec ?
This is 1000 percent better if you watch it to the theme song from Game of Thrones.
As a caps fan, good luck to George McPhee in Vegas.
Can we get a team in Portland Oregon? After the Nordiques of course.
"1918 
Vancouver Millionaires 
Missed that."
Canada deserves at least one more team :D
â¤
This was a cool video it was a nice touch showing the logo changes over the years.
If anything this proved we didn't need a team in Vegas
I watched this entire video just to see the part where Nashville pops up in 1998
To bad Portland, Oregon does not have an NHL team. There are smaller cities (population wise) that have NHL teams and people love hockey here. All we have is a WHL team and the average game has 15,000 people in attendance. In other words our WHL team sells more tickets than some NHL teams. If we had a pro team it would do even better attendance.
Habs there since the beginning
Phoenix to Seattle and Carolina to Quebec City, and now we're talking.
Vancouver millionaire
most amazing video I have ever seen. this is almost p0rn to me
That's so cool
bettman's logic they need to put a hockey team in india, china and maybe brazil.
Your story is incomplete 100 years-You did not bother to look into the early History.
Tiz made me tear up knowing tiz was going to be epic. ahh man can't believe how much work they put up. but then the last part I felt bummed out hahahaha. I mean they killed the vidieo. hahaha
can some swap the music for the game of thrones theme song please?
hi long island :)
there should be another team in minnesota because it is the state of hockey how crazy would it be if the stars came back up north with the wild ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ƒ
Man, that moment of time lapse when your  looking at the Original Six... As a long time Die Hard hockey fan, Its a powerful feeling.  Well done sir! Well done.
ÐšÑ€ÑƒÑ‚Ð¾ !
Bruins were first team that's still in the nhl so that makes the Bruins the first nhl team
They should make one of these for a real sport
Am I the only one who thinks Seattle should get a hockey team? That city only having 2 of the 4 major American sports seems crazy to me. Huge market potential especially since the city resents the NBA with their team moving to OKC
Who has the best logo???
The Nordique skating towards Colorado was pretty cool. Also the Isles Gorton's logo!
Sad how the money of NHL ruins the european leagues.
interesting
this is pretty cool its just would be so sad to have my team move even tho it never happened
cool video, never seen a few of the teams before

As soon as the NFL arrives in Las Vegas the Golden Knights will go belly up. Hartford has a better chance at hosting a team than Vegas. Bring back the Whalers!
Cool
so many stupid decisions here
That was a sick video. And I have never used the word sick to describe something awesome, it just was, sick
I think I am the only person that thinks the league has expanded too much too quickly
Great.....now contract the damn thing before the talent gets diluted....
Definitely one of the best videos I've seen any pro-league youtube channel put out
GoodðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
Seattle Metropolitans?
Vegas has a team??
So stupid going to Vegas and not real hockey towns in Canada and North US. Keep your teams unprofitable
did anyone felt they got older by watching this
Now I haven't done much research on this subject but maybe I can get some clarification. But I used to always know of the original 6 NHL teams being Hawks, Rangers, Bruins, Wings, Leafs, Canadians and that was in 1926. Well right here in 1926 they have 10 teams. Also the NHL has been celebrating its 100th anniversary. So where am I getting lost here? Is this including the IHL or whatever it was called before it combined with the NHL? The only time I see an "original 6" is around 1944-1967
If Las Vegas gets a hockey team so should Alabama. lol
Russia respect NHL   and  wait  Global tournament
Best sport in the entire world, it's a shame how underrated it is. Also proud to be a lifelong Kings fan, here's to the next 100 years NHL!
I love NHL ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ†ðŸ†ðŸ†.
I never knew about the St. Louis falcons, I thought the blues were the only team we ever had. Very great video
coolz
NHL is rigged.
Weren't the metropolitans a hockey team in Washington state at some point?
NHL JUST REVEALED LAS VEGAS IS GETTING A TEAM
cool vid
this makes me strangely depressed
Awesome video
Well done NHL... well done indeed!!!
lets go Nunavut!!
I don't know why people hated on the Islanders "Fisherman" logo in the mid 90's. That was sick!
vegas knights??
vegas knights??
this is a dope video
Brought a tear to my eye watching how my teams logo has changed throughout the last 20+ years. Brought back a flood of memories and reminded me of how miss old logo's we had. I just wish I can go back.
Go Bolts âš¡ï¸âš¡ï¸
Go Habs go
AWESOME way to see how much it's grown and teams and logos changeðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Vegas golden knights wtfff
His was really cool! #boldingold
would love to see this done for mlb, nba, and nfl. awesome job mr. creamer.
2:24 gave me tears. Bring back the Whalers!
And yet not one team in history went to Wisconsin :/
I still believe that Seattle should be the next stop
This is very well made!
Let's be honest. Amazing display of history.
Good video!
Flyers logo barely even changed Lol
This video gave me goosebumps!! Hopefully Alaska is the next one to get an NHL team!
Seeing Quebec and Winnipeg's logos move down and change made me sick.
welldone. GO SENS GO!
Vegas golden knights tho
Omg
MontrÃ©al canadien never gone
Buffalo came in the SAME season as Vancouver '70......learn your history!!!!
I screamed in joy when Golden Knights popped up. LETS GO
This'll probably sound biased because I'm an Arizona coyotes fan (I live in Arizona), but they coyotes are on the rise and so is hockey in Arizona. Also, when people complain about hockey in the desert, LA doesn't really get snow, same with San Jose, Anaheim and the Florida teams. With the number of prospects they have and the two first round picks this year, the coyotes look like they may have a good future.
Arizona Coyotes they're thinking about moving to Seattle
laines better
Cool
I like how Red Wings logo is virtually the same since 1932 with only a mere cosmetic change in 1967. What a stability!
all the other major logo changes while the wings logo just gets a little bigger every few years lol it was already perfect :)
I would love to see Seattle get a team.  Hartford and North Dakota also deserve teams.
If there is any justice in the world, Quebec gets either the Coyotes, Hurricanes or Islanders and they become the second incarnation of les nordiques!
"2000-2016
Just 1 Team moved.
Then everything else is just logo upgrading. LOL"
Oh Quebec:)
give north Dakota a team not las Vegas
was it just me or this video was actually kinda inspiring
Quebec City should have gotten the 31st NHL team.
Was it just me or was it hard to follow
Now, I fully know every NHL team name and when  they were a team!
nice bro
What was the music?
Pirates logo was just dope
I want there to be a Wisconsin team so bad
Through the years... The ducks still choke
Why playing in the desert where nobody gives a s#it about it?
i love this so much
Love how you added the vegas
Seattle Hipsters, make it happen 2020
I like the part when they move into Las Vegas for no reason
One question: Why Las Vegas?
every team that moved south made me cry
Where was the million airs
They want to grow the game in the US there going to expand to Seattle or Portland next
This video made me emotional.
Great video
The music makes me want to cry in awe for some reason idk
This video at 0.5 speed was perfect.
That's awesome.
This was an awesome video, well done. Miss my Sens 2d logo so bad!
SECOND TEAM IN TORONTO, ENOUGH SAID!!!
That was extremely well done.
Pretty sure Columbus changed the logo in 2007, not 2011.
Best video on this channel i've seen in a while
"Philadelphia Quakers 

Best name in the history"
Should move hurricanes to Quebec
so sad all the Americans teams and so few Canadian teams
Next hockey expansion city, Milwaukee
This is cool
Need more Canadian teams. Hell, we invented the flipping sport!!!!
wow amazing
inaccurate vancouver early 1910s
Quebec > Las Vegas
a little late changing that ducks logo.
Montreal has always been there even before the nhl
why does the dot where Toronto is look like its in Oshawa
#NunavutEskimos
great video shows the history nicely
R.I.P Atlanta Thrashers
it would have been cool if maybe Alaska actually got a sports team and it would make sense considering that it is a cold state
Song?
It would be cool to see a team count during the timeline to see how many teams there were at each stage. Awesome video!
Love my panthers
Alright... so who's stupid idea was it to move the Winnipeg Jets franchise to the hot deserts of Arizona?
I don't know why this gave me chills. Probably because it was so cool and well made.
This is dope
GO BRUINS
I really hope Seattle gets a team really soon. I also hope the Nordiques come back and maybe in the future Portland and Houston can get teams
Habs Forever, From the begenning to the end
That's cool
Wait 10 years and china will have a team.
HARTFORD WHALERS
Damn, Kings and Canucks are the west coast hockey OG's
Vancouver millionaires? Hello?
move the hurricanes, panthers, and coyotes to quebec, seattle, and hartford
didn't Seattle have a team a very long time ago? i thought i remember reading about a championship between them and toronto being cancelled due to a plague
great video
This is just awesome to see
Relocated the Tampa Bay Lightning to Thunder Bay Ontario.... So that they are the Thunder Bay Lightning. Boom. Mind Blown.
Quebec should be the next teams
Actually...I think Seattle should have a hockey team also...Pretty crazy how much hockey has expanded ... I bet in like 500 years there would be hockey teams in like Europe lol
UP NEXT: MEXICO MAYANS
quebec could use a team COUGH GARY BETTMAN COUGH
Maybe Alaska could have a team to make it even.
Watched it on half speed, perfect to actually see all the changes
We need more Canadian teams
100 years of awesomeness. Next should be the Quebec.......Huskies. Any other suggestions?
Need more Canadian teams...
so this is where the budget for review camera's went. your right the potatoes you use now are great.
I got Vietnam flashbacks when the north stars moved to dallas
Wow
If a team is going to QC(Quebec City), it'd be the panthers. However QC would have the least population of any NHL team, and that's a problem. But the population of QC has tripled in the last 15 years, so a bit of time and QC will be a franchise
sad to see the Thrashers move. Winnipeg deserves a team, but still miss the birds...
Why would people remove teams?
Awesome video!
3 minutes and 29 seconds of proof that the North Americans have no clue how to build genuine sports dynasties or nurture fan culture. The desert and swamplands could use a couple more DOA franchises.
Love how the NHL moves teams from places where they have many fans out to places where hockey is not popular at all.
The Ducks should go back to the  Anaheim mighty ducks , buy it back from Disney
The NHL should expand to Seattle and relocate the Coyotes and Canes to Quebec City and Hartford first and foremost. I'd also like to see the NHL go to Milwaukee, Saskatoon, Mexico City, and Baltimore sometime in the future.
Where are the Capitals?
Canadien are the Classic one, GO HABS GO!!!!!!
Some of these team names became another sports team's name in that area
This is so cool!
I feel Seattle should come next. It has promises, if it can build a arena.
Very very cool...
So cool!
Z
Amazing video! Can't wait to see what's next!
Why in the hell would a hockey team ever move from MINNESOTA to DALLAS ?
If any city got a new team out west, am I the only one who thinks Portland would be a good pick? Their fan bases there are great
A tout les QuÃ©bÃ©cois qui veulent que les Nordiques reviennent
Vegas will no doubt have a minimal amount of fans as well. These decisions are straight up retarded...
This is actually pretty fantastic
Yes, Ottawa did have a team. Stop saying they didn't
great video, since there has to be an even number of teams next year they should add a Seattle team
really well done video
who ever the genius was that thought of expanding the market to the South East, especially the pointless state of Florida should be stoned to death. There is, and will never be any sort of sustained hockey culture down there.
Even the vagas team! Can't wait to see that co e into play
As a big caps fan i like the way the logo was the Eagle for like ten years them back to normal xD
does anyone not realize why they left Quebec in the first place? the market there was dead as the Habs were dominant, if any Canadian city it should be Halifax, Regina or London
BRING BACK THE WHALERS!
All hail the Buffalo Slug
Cancun and Punta Cana should be the next ones to get a team.
"PLEASE ADD A TEAM IN QEUBECE TO REUNITE THE RIVALRY OR IN SASKATCHEWAN!!!!!


More teams in canada!"
Seattle needs team.
Probably the best NHL video i have seen on youtube! Liked the way they not only showed how team got moved around but also when they changed their logos....pretty nice concise time lapsed themed video
Coool!
This is the reason why Montreal Canadians deserve all the respect in the league because we're the oldest team in the NHL we own the NHL with 24 stanly cups  go habs go !!
The Quebec City Frenchies has a nice ring to it
the canes should move to Quebec soon
so instead of bringing back the Hartford Whalers or Quebec Nordiques. they give us the Las Vegas Golden Knights.
I love how the blues logo has remained the same basically throughout the 50 years. Not to mention Chicago, Detroit, New York (Rangers), Montreal, and Toronto.
Jets became a team again in 2011? Damn time flies
loved the first 3 minutes and 19 seconds
I learned more about the expansion than all my history classes
it's gonna be weird having 31 teams
I'm an Ottawa fan and I kinda think that they should of kept the plain o till 2000 and then switched it to the modern logo I didn't like the last logo the almost modern logo but less bright colours and a different style tell me if you agree
Wow! Awesome video!
song?
It's crazy to think where Jagr slotted in all of this.
well done.
toronto needs another team, biggest hockey market that way canada can have 2 teams
All I got out of this is that the last time a new team logo looked good was the 70s.
Did anyone else see OMG with Ottawa and the Montreal teams at the beginning?
Vegas Team confirmed
Sick
I think Seattle would for sure be able to have a stable team.
I'm surprised on how many southern states have hockey teams and how many northern states don't.
Screw the haters: The NHL is still the Coolest Game on Earth.
wtf is up with the shitty camera moves of the map
Nunavut needs a team
Daly City Sharks
Fire Bettman
This video is so cool
1967 seals the deal for the teams with the best fanbases. If you came after '67 your teams fanbase is 'so-so'
What about the future team : LA Nights
The Oilers are still going to lose.
Great video
Nordiques, Whalers, and Jets should have never relocated. All 3 concessions where they have relocated are currently struggling. An NHL franchise in the desert is the biggest joke.
I miss the old stars logo
Why isn't Ottawa in the original six?
GREAT video!
Didn't know how young these teams where
They forgot to add Tampa's logo before the new one
Seattle Whalers. Should be the next expansion team
Wish there was some sort of breaks showing the division and conference changes over the years too. I liked the old Campbell/Wales Conference era.
can not wait to see that new Vegas team! 2017-18 season will be memorable for sure
bring back nhl to Quebec
LV shouldn't get a team. I think Quebec should get the nordiques back. They would do much better out there
That was sick
Neat video!
I caught nothing from the begining Because of how much there was to process...I'm going to have to watch it in slow motion but it is a very cool video
Mighty ducks logo is much better than the ducks, late 90s early 2000s sabres logo was awesome (I'm sorry but to me it was) late 90s coyotes logo and jerseys were awesome. And Winnipeg should create a hybrid jersey/logo of original and current(much like they did for the game they played against Edmonton earlier this year). I think you should pay homage to the original in your logo also because he current one is probably my least favorite in the league. And the original Columbus logo was awesome. The current stars and hurricanes jerseys are pretty generic and boring, the Carolina alternates are sick and they could make those their regular jerseys with a white version and the stars should go back to the black, dark green and gold.
Woo-hoo! The Canes! Oh, sorry Hartford.
Cant top the Red Wings and Flyers logo's. Classics.
Arizona coyoties to seatle Marlins
Quebec and Atlanta need a team. They're fans have proven to be loyal.
nice video ðŸ‘
As a Carolina Hurricanes fan, why do we have to share our legacy with the Whalers who never won anything that mattered
this is a cool video
Bring back the Whalers
coming soon  carolina  hurricanes moving to quebec city
Saskatchewan needs a team next
hockey forever
Great video I wonder if another team will rise in the future
IMHO, time to return NHL in ATALANTA
i hope this helps canadian fans realize that their team has accomplished almost nothing when it comes to mondern day hockey. 24 cups when nobody else existed lol
should've been the aces...
NHL should give teams to Seattle, Quebec City, and a 2nd team for Toronto.
my thrashers :(
The late-90s Sabres' logo was badass.
Didn't know Kansas City had a team in the 70s
That's an awesome video. As someone who loves reading/learning on the history of hockey I hope the NHL does more of these historical videos for the centennial
I want the Nordiques back in the worst way.
that music was pretty neat
Needs one more Team in the Western conference and they're even. Hope Bettman chooses correctly.
this was a very nice video. thank you!
Cool vid. Years on the logos were not accurate but otherwise awesome job.
Very Cool
Let's welcome the Golden Knights to the NHL, everybody!!
Blue Jackets <3
Love the original 6 that kept their logo through the years
The Quebec nordiques :)
Rip Cleveland Barons
Qubec should be the next city to get an NHL team...
That's so cool
this video was beautiful, as a hockey fan who finally has a job that allows for him to watch hockey, seeing histroy unfold is eye opening; extravagant, and exciting to see the OG teams.
It made my nipples erect when they started showing how team logo's have changed throughout the years.
0.75 speed makes the music more epic
dope af
Beautiful
Ducks should of kept their original logo and colors. So much cooler than what they have now.
LGR!!!!
I guess now we have proof that Corwin actually goes out into the sun sometimes
no colored laces? ok then
Part 2 pls??
Need some more "yah you knows" in the post game interview
Where are the colored laces and mismatched socks
That visor is actually sick
Should have used Batman tape
This is like the buzzfeed of sports im loving these series
That was actually amazing. I'm dying. xD
This video is gold
-5 HAHAHAHHAHA
69 nice

"Were gonna dress up like a tool" Proceeds to use all of Jesse's equipment.

All these hockey players fucking suck, terrible
This video is probably the greatest one yet. Keep em coming!! Hockey chirps are iconic and we want more
He can't even do an interview... where's the sniffling and not enough uhh's smh
What the hell u wearing bird cages for
What the hell u wearing bird cages for
He didn't tuck the jersey in on all the sides :(
ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ loved it
Do the same, but with a goalie. Ya need the old school brown pads and a Hasek mas to start
The more you try to make someone look like a hockey douche bag, the more they look like Ovechkin.
I've scene all of the bardown vids now and I love it. Keep em coming guys
I dont know if it was on purpose but when someone chirps saying "whaaa?" A few times seems to piss them off
This is quality YouTube content right here. The amount of effort is astounding! You earned a sub my friend
Episode 2?
The fact that you Americans talk like this on the ice is fucking hilarious
Keep these videos coming ðŸ˜‚
I love the helmet so much. I actually have a helmet that's bright orange.
First video I've seen but I like it. Liked and subbed
Omg I just had a hockey tournament at Canlan ice rink
Luca was looking at Auston Matthews on his computer. Lol
The supreme sticker is a tremendous addition
you should've taped his stick with clear tape
This was beautiful. Thanks TSN
Dude, keep this series, i telling you, this was funny as shit
The hoodie Erin is wearing from my high school hockey team I didn't now he when to my school
Corwin looks like jacksepticeye
6:04 #8 was so mad lol
BarDown... more of this. This is far better than those awful skits.
Everything on BarDown would be good if they had people who were actually funny.  None of these guys are funny.
this is so funny
I died when they got out the supreme sticker
God damn hockey players are arseholes you'd never see that sort of talk in a rugby match
Where are the leather gloves and pink tape
Supreme sticker lol.
Plot twist: It's the only gear he owns
Hahaha " he knew what he did. Check the tape".
This was amazing ðŸ˜‚
Nice
Wood stick lol
Where is the wooden stick?
Please make more of these, you guys are the only reason I subscribe to this channel
Omg YES!!! more Corwin plz
This is an awesome series, seriously excited to see so much more of this!!!
God I love the Bardown team
Those chirps sounded staged
FISHBOWL?
they look like the Dallas cowboys if they were a hockey team.
This is what people will watch for their history of the internet class in 3018
Even the refs are chirping
Does this mean you guys will finally get your own YouTube channel?
"ASHL dads are chirping?

They wear stickers on their helmets for participation trophys."
Aluminum stick
You NEED your own channel
â€I borrowed his shot tooâ€
"stay still I'm trying to check my hair" ðŸ˜‚
The tinted visor in the thumbnail is sexy! Imagine a fully tinted fishbowl oh myyyy
I kinda like the blades lol
6:08
i wanna see jess wear all that stuff that would be so funny because he would have the best responses to the chirps
The white skates are pretty brutal, but finding white skates with T Blades couldn't have worked out better for making him look like a tool.
I like the gloves. I actually wear all white Warrior ax1 gloves myself.
fantastic
Wait, the chain wasn't part of the tool getup?
Buncha benders....this aint pranking
0:51 same, Grady. Same
Next time, get the oldest gear you can find, get someone to wear that
This pales in comparison to what the usual roller hockey player wears lol
Id volunteer to wear that religiously
Do a goalie version where he wears one of those marvel mask, black pads and a colored cage
"Buddy you play way too much CHEL" I'm dead.
This is Canadian as fuck.
the refs are chirping him ðŸ˜‚
Canlan York is a garbage rink
Have him play a full game opposite handed
This is content
Just missing the yellow laces
NOW THE INSTAGRAM VIDEO MAKES SENSE
Right on boys, quality content
The mighty dicks
My names grady
Should have went Red Helmet with the Visor
"actually it was my second" lmao I LIVE for you guys
I can't wait!
When making eric look like a tool is just giving him all of Jesse's stuff
I lost it when they interviewed him.
I don't see a problem!!! When I skate out(growing up I was keeping net!) I wear Mike bossy's jofa w 1/2 shield!!!(I love it cause I get chirped for having Gretzky gear!!!) And when I suit up tender I have a blue "IRBE" lid and since I'm decent in goal guy's aren't old enough to remember the " Irbe, Healy, Rhudey,  and let's not forget Sauve!" so I get alot of "Hasek" chirps!!! I'm an eBay gear nerd(to an extent, I see guys actually using 70's masks with the small eyeholes rather than the cage?!? I mean talk about sacrificing functionality for fashion at practice for 20-30 minutes, but Pretty selfish if you're costing your team cause you think something looks cool!?!) Really, I've seen this!!!
Luca looking at Auston's photoshoot at the beginning lol
So glad I subbed!!! The past 2 vids have been phenom!!!! #phenom!!!!
Turns out Jesse already dressed as a tool naturally
Do a TSN Chell tournament
0:31
My team got slapped on this rink
Chief, this is it
Try and find the skates with the heated blades
this is awesome, let me design you guys some jerseys. Im a free lance graphic designer. my insta is @ApolloHockeyApparel
The chirps were worth it alone
Definitely more of this kind of video
Wear gear from the 70s and grow a matching tache.
Man how can I apply for your guys job.  Looks like you guys just get to have fun while talking about hockey
I've been waiting for this since seeing the IG posts. Haha He looks like robocop with that visor
You did this man fuckin dirty ! I love it! Good job boys
I wonder what gritty would do if he saw him wearing that stuff
This video was amazing! It's awesome to see the personality of TSN!
I would love more videos with these guys
It's been a fat minute since I've laughed this hard. Thank you, Bar Down. Please keep it up
Hilarious, best interview at the end to top it off.
I want to buy that bucket
love TSN and this crew, thank you guys for the laughs and great videos
I love vancouver
"Was it your first goal?" "No it was my second, first was when I scored with your mother."
Low key looks like callaros
Next make Jesse wear the oldest equipment you can find #gojetsgo #tsn
Love it. More of this please
Never forget that Jesse wore a Solar Bears uniform...

Lmao did they tell the refs and other team to chirp him
This is fantastic

This is it chief
I wanna see more of Jesse corwin and Luca playing
NO WAYYY!! I just played a high school tournament at Canlan today!!
Gotta get the JOFA lid next time
So long story short... Jessie is the dutiest hockey player ever?....
Hilarious chirps, can't wait to see more!
F copy rights. Bring back grease'd Laine # leaf fan. No big deal
I just witnessed Eric getting bullied for half a video ðŸ˜‚
oh my god this is FANTASTIC
The fact that the other team got pissed off angered me.
FISHBOWL!?!?! FISHBOWL!?!?!?! YOU GOTTA CHIRP THE DUSTY THING FOR WHAT IT IS!- instant classic.
Can we talk about how Corwin looks exactly like Josh Morrisey from the winnipeg jets
As an American I was super confused and entertained by this
if you need an extra defenseman 6'5" 215 hits like a motherfucker and quick with an awesome wrist shot and good slapshot with decent vision when I'm not having a seizure hmu
"just get ccm 552 tacks
or old ccm gloves"
Great video! You guys should make a seperate channel, I love this content and the quizzes but don't want to get spammed with all the other tsn videos in my feed
Was missing the yellow laces my dood lol
"Meeered visor"

The good side"
"You look like a fucking create a player" was the best chirp by far.
Do Canadians really hate Ovi that much
I live so close to that CANLAN ice sports arena!!! Invite me!!!
LOVE IT! MOARRRRRRRRR.
"Where'd you play? Junior D Bag?" fucking killed holy shit
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚bravo boys
U guys are brutal for working at TSN in canada...
this was funny, I enjoyed this(:
You should do player profiles for individual players on the team and break down their playing style
Why didn't you just let Jesse wear his equipment
-5 ðŸ™ŒðŸ‘ðŸ™ŒðŸ‘
"Junior D-Bag"
dont gotta dress like a tool that roman numeral tat does it for ya
Why do kids with cages always have to talk the most shit?
Junior D-Bag is a solid burn
Just talked to chief, he said this is it.
Let's GOOOOO
â€œMy first goal was in Peeweeâ€ killed me
Please have Eric participate in the quizzes pppppllleeeeaaassseeeee
Of course Jesse sits with his legs crossed
Man I wish I could play. At least I skate better than Jesse.
AMAZING! I love it
I like how they make Eric look like a tool, but they do it by just giving him all of Jesse's stuff. XD
Beaut of an epi boys, keep em up
Jesse loves everything they tried to punish Erik with lol
Now this is great content
My teacher's brother runs the ASHL
Do this more but make Jesse do it
yes!!
More of this. This is it.
ðŸžðŸžðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
Sub to me
Big gay
Sounds like Bill Belichick
the nba needs to set a rule on the 4 man screen rung before someone does it to win a game. basically the move is have your 4 players make a ring around a shooter so opponents cant defend them to give your shooter open space to shoot. one day it will happen and its gunna be crazy.
19.2-7 No guns
stop changing the rules and let teams adapt to these hacks. all you are making is a terrible uneventful game.
Roger Neilson is known in Vancouver for being the guy who began towel waving in hockey. Game 2 of the WCF against Chicago, he waved a white towel on a stick, and thus began towels in NHL ice hockey. I own one of those original towels they gave out in game 3 back in Vancouver, my grandmother preserved it and gave it to me. I consider it a great piece of sports history.
5&-'-4&+$:7$: can fix can be CC ðŸ¢ðŸ£ðŸš‰ðŸšŠ
Santi?
Not the hero we wanted but needed
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
Anybody know where you can see the matches
"My favorite rule verbiage is in the sport of baseball. A player, after reaching first base, tried to steal second to allow his compatriot on third to steal home. The catcher wasn't fooled, kept the ball, and so after the guy got to second, he decided to run back to first and try it again, until the catcher gave in and tried to get him out, allowing the guy on third to score. The next day the baseball commission wrote a new rule worded thus, and it's great:

""Any runner is out when, after he has acquired legal possession of a base, he runs the bases in reverse order for the purpose of confusing the defense or making a travesty of the game.""

And it absolutely fits in with the idea of them appending his name to it, like ""Making a travesty of the game, ROGER."" (Well Germany Schaefer in this case)"
"OMG. That ish is /hilarious/.

""*ROGER*"""
There was this goalie in the Argentine First Division Football/Soccer League called Hugo Gatti during the 60s and 70s. Since goalies, aka gaolkeepers, in soccer/football don't have to follow the same dress code as the rest of the team when it comes to colors of the shirt, he would like to have colorful getups where he would wear bright shirts with bright pants and socks, and play in a very provoctative and taunting way. The AFA (Argentina's Football Association) passed a rule which said that the goalie could use a different color shirt but the pants and socks had to match the rest of the team. So as to basically put an end to his shennanigans.
The rule only says the goalkeeper has to stay in the crease until the player touches the puck. Doesn't mean he can't charge and take the puck away.
The original nhl ombudsman
then he died of cancer
This guy reminds me of bill belichick
i love this weird rules series! will you be doing one on the martin brodeur rule in the nhl?
He also started the weird swirling of towel over your head thing during championship games.
FINE! I'll watch it!
I went to Roger Neilson's Hockey School every summer....    : )
So when they touch the puck for the penalty shot, that includes when they're swiping the puck left to right with their stick right?  So the moment the stick touches the puck by a tiny tap you can charge the person.
There's one for rugby league that's still in operation but you yanks wouldn't have a clue what I was talking about it I were to explain it
"Two more Roger Neilson stories, though not really relating to weird rules:
-In 1978-79 he was fired as head coach by the Toronto Maple Leafs; after outrage across the team and fanbase he was reinstated without missing a game, but the Leafs' cantankerous owner Harold Ballard's original plan was to bring him back as a ""mystery coach"" with a paper bag on his head, that he was supposed to take off to reveal himself at some point in his first game back. Roger refused, came back as normal, but was again fired at the end of the season. 

-In the 1982 playoffs he was coaching the Vancouver Canucks, a job he took over from Harry Neale who was suspended late in the season for attacking a fan in Quebec City, and who were en route to their first of 3 trips to the Stanley Cup Finals. During game 2 of the Campbell (Western) Conference Finals against Chicago, he felt his Canucks were getting the short end of the stick regarding penalties, so he put a white towel on a hockey stick and waved it in mock-surrender. He and three players who copied him were ejected and fined, but at game 3 in Vancouver thousands of fans brought their own towels to wave at the game, and ""Tower Power"" was born. Roger even has a statue outside Rogers Arena depicting him with the skate & towel raised."
Hockey still has b.s. rules.
They should make a movie about him... I'd watch it.
Where are these games, so we can watch the hilarity?
No SnOwMaN
yo i deadass wasnt paying attention because the guys pants on the right are so black that it looks like it isnt there wtf
Lol,i was that kid
they should real the rules for tw seasons to see if any coaches now will do that stuff.
"Because nobody ever studied their opponents... *coughs * Ridiculous 
 - Sun Tzu"
Lol you're always "in the right" if it's a loophole. Dumbfuck.
Preventive measure would be to give referees more power to decide what to do if they think something is unsportsmanlike behaviour. Put minute of extra time on the clock and give penalty shots if they deem it necessary.
These are almost the most boring people to ever be in a video besides anybody who is in a buzzfeed video.
Wtf is this weird format? Why is this a conversation?!
Chaotic good
Go home Roger
I don't want to watch, where does the snowman come into play?
How about one in soccer/football, that says that you can't score a goal direct from a throw-in, at least if the same team doesn't touch it? Despite it being in the rule books, a Premier League game actually had this happen (it happened to Aston Villa in 2002), and the referee counted it. The keeper swears he never touched the ball, and it's inconclusive to this day.
How can you put more men on the ice when you are already down to 3 plus the goaltender! It has a limit and the rule change is unnecessary!
2:37 soooo the goalie can still charge at the penalty shot taker hasek style ?
Do not you dare make a snow man
I don't understand the first one they mention, about the three people. I mean, the coach is able to put more people in the ice than it is allowed? What does it mean to reset the game?
A perfect example of Chaotic good
The first IRL speedrunner.
(2:40) No, the goal keeper does not have to stay put. The rule said that the goal keeper only has to stay put until the puck has been touched, and it was when the puck was touched that the penalty shot begins. I bet that the defencman also stayed put until the puck was first touched.
Whoa.. this channel is amazing. The interview style is sooo great for presenting fun facts. Way better than the animated crap in all those "top 10" videos. Kudos, sub'd.
Roger was the original Analytics Coach in the NHL. Fun fact
why dicaprio
I'm that kid
"5:24

I think they're called ""penetration testers"". I'm not correcting you, I just really like saying the job title ""penetration tester""."
I want to see this in a Drunk History format.
"Roger: did you guys even read the rule book?
Officials: what do you mean roger?
Roger: lol, dont worry about it."
"this guy saved hockey!" No.No he didn't.
Wow...could this look anything more like two forever virgins alone on a Friday night passing the time until they THINK it will get all better in college?
He's a troll lol
Binging this series has reminded me of three curious loopholes in various historical tournament chess rules sets that were all as far as I understand it closed in response to them being abused for chess puzzles, namely promotion to a king, promotion to a piece of your opponent's colour, and vertical castling with a newly promoted rook.
Everyone calls following the rules to the letter a loophole. It's not. Calling it a loophole is just dumb people finding a way to disparage someone vastly smarter than themselves.
I must say that I'd rather have a video just of the guy explaining things instead of this weird conversation
lol.. what he said about all 4th graders traveling..They all travel in the NBA too
were these NHL rule changes?  Neilson was the coach of the Petes when he pulled the "too many men on the ice" trick and the "defenceman in the net for penalty shots" trick, so clearly they would have entered into the OHL rulebook, but did they get kicked up into the NHL?
I was playing a showcase in Michigan once and my coach made me take every face off in the second period with no stick to prove a point to the ref. Hilarious because I would just line up like a center in football and clobber the kid when the puck dropped.
I don't even like sports and this was really interesting
These two guys have no clue about hockey.
That guy on the right is extremely Jewish looking. You just don't get much more Talmudic in appearance than that.
Roger and my grandpa were friends. I used to get sent autographs from players he was coaching. Not DiCaprio like at all. Really great guy.
esports are a thing. Do a few of those. I recommend Magic The Gathering. They've got more weird rules than you'll ever be able to cover. Get one of the experts out there from another channel to come in and try to make it interesting to sports fans. (alternate: Game Balance fix for League of Legends)
Roger is a Hero! :-)
Why isn't there a movie about this guy?!?
"This is why legal contracts are so cryptic and verbose.
They want to get every nook and cranny of said rules to just have something work, otherwise someone thinks they're gonna do something ""allowed"" by using a loophole.
Here's an idea someone would ask: ""Why don't we make loophole attempts illegal? Clearly, just intending to work outside any simple yet fair rules is a terrible thing to do.""
Because that would strip a lot of power from bad lawyers, the kind that abuse the verbosity of legal contracts, so, there are simply just too many that wouldn't let that kind of rule pass."
When I was playing a game of crazy eights I called last card until I had the entire deck in my hand
numales
This is like those TAS exploits except in hockey.
This is a bad setup
A example of a soccer loophole would be in 2002 Sheffield United vs West Brom. United were losing 3-0 had used all their substitutes and were reduced to 8 men due to 3 red cards. With a 3 man deficit for the final 15 minutes a severe beating was highly likely which would adversely affect their goal difference (a tie breaker in English Football). Subsequently 2 players left the field "injured" and with no replacements allowed the referee had no option to abandon the game as the minimum number of players allowed is 7.
LOL
Sean Avery rule
"Roger Nielson seems pretty based forreal.
More rules don't make sports better"
"I'm not sure whether or not Roger created this rule, but I'd be shocked if he didn't exploit it over his career.  If a team used their timeout earlier in the game (they only get one) and he needed one to give his best line a breather, he'd have the goalie come over with an equipment problem - skate lost an edge, strap on his pad came loose, something like that.  Back in the day, they could take their time fixing the problem, so the equipment manager would have trouble finding the skate sharpener, or he'd have to tape the strap on the pad really, really, really securely - like a half-roll of tape.

There also used to be a rule where if you substituted your goalie, he got a couple of minutes to warm up, and teammates were allowed to take shots on him.  Many coaches also used this rule to get an unofficial timeout.  Some would swap out their goalies repeatedly, just to kill the other teams momentum and get a few extra seconds of rest for a tired line they wanted out on the ice.

Other things that they still do today is have players changes sticks, and the equipment manager will bring them two sticks from the bench.  Of course, the player will take his dead time selecting just the right one.  Another tactic they use is to try and have a player either change late, after the ref has signalled for the other team to make their change, or change on an icing call, which you can't do if you're the team that iced the puck.  Somebody will wander off the bench, the ref will catch him and send him back, the player will argue that he was on the ice when the icing call was made, but the ref will send him off anyway."
Former Leafs owner Harold Ballard once wanted Roger Neilson to coach with a paper bag over his head.
I remember in a HS football game we had an awesome kicker.  One play we just got up some-odd 10 points in les than a minute with less than a minute to go.  He did an onside kick, and never lined up.  He put his hand up for the refs but once they whistled him through they just went for it and we won. Beautiful instance
"Heh, it's been something of a truism for a long time that any time you see a particularly odd or extremely prescriptive rule, law, user instruction etc somewhere, the great likelihood is that it's been laid down in response to one particular person doing something crazy but technically allowed / not defended against that then caused a whole mess of trouble, and that prescription had to be put in to guard against even the tiny likelihood that someone else would copy them.

And, well... looks like we found ""that one guy"", at least for the ice hockey rulebook :D"
For that last rule could you maybe do a thing where you take the a stick, put it in front of goal and then just score goals by hitting it over and over again lol
He kind of looked liked a very old Ted Bundy.
sounds like me
Dean smith is the man who forced a shot clock. What a legend
The NHL seems pretty back at patching loopholes. Why would they specify goalkeepers with that third one? It sounds to me like any other substituted player can still leave whatever equipment they want in front of the goal...
I'm so disappointed. I thought NHL was NHS!
After 3v5 they should just let people in on the other team and not stop time for the 6th player to come out.
You either die a villain or live long enough to become the hero.
Can you break off the goal and take it with you?
Can the goal tender throw their stick?
"Deliberate" so as long as they put someone as coach who has low enough intelligence where they are not deliberately doing anything, it's doable.
Should have a movie about Roger Wilson
Troubleshooter!
You can't punish someone for being clever.
Roger Neilson is the kind of guy who'd purposely burn himself just to sue a fast food chain for not putting a "hot content" warning on the cup.
If they were facing the same camera, this would be perfectly normal. But facing each other, this looks like a first date that's going really well. Like, the guy in the red shirt brought a date conversation notebook and he's totally crushing it. Is this what a gay Canadian match date looks like? Expect at Tim Horton's, obviously.
Yikes, and I though the exploits and cheese strats in video games were bad.
I'm not quite clear on the first one. Ok, so he kept stalling by keep putting too many men on the ice. But what does this have to do with "can't have fewer than three men"? Surely he can stall the same way even if he still has four, five or even the full six?
He was also one of the first coaches to use video to teach his players.  His nickname was "captain video".
As my Health and Safety Manager says to me "Every stupid, dumb and pointless rule has a story behind it."
this one was actually pretty good.
Underarm bowling in cricket.
The Rob Ray rule to keep your equipment and jersey on in NHL fights because he just took that off and no one could grab onto him and then he just went to town fighting
What about non-goalie NHL hockey players- are they allowed to leave their stick, snow .... in the way so opponent players who like to attack in one particular way are stifled because there is all this stuff in their way. It shouldn't been necessary to have this rule change- should already been covered.
Bill Belichick
Absolutely NO snowmen.
"Using a player instead of a goalie for a shootout doesn't seem like its a loophole at all, if a team wants to do that they should be able to do it. There are 3 trivial ways of beating something like that as a shooter, the absolute best and cheapest way is probably just flip the puck really high 15 feet over the guys head as he's halfway to you. Doing this is ridiculously easy and aiming at the net should be like a 95%+ easy feet for most from just inside the red line.
You could also just bank it off the boards like a billiards shot, or of course... just shoot the damn thing past the guy normally, it should be much easier than a real goalie."
No one likes traveling guy. Bounce the ball you uncoordinated thing.
More videos like this, short, interesting, made me want more, plus i resonate with rodger. haha funny bit by the way, rodger.
Neat! would have never known about these funny stories and changes to the game
Hockey was broken before they play tested and patched it, too many exploits.
Wait, regarding the third rule. Does that mean you can pile up snow or shaved ice to help block the goal, as long as the goalkeeper remains at the goal?
This guy must play MtG as well.
You would be like so good at DND min-maxing
How does one talk about Roger and not mention THE TRAP !!!!!!    Blasphemy !!!
The Avery rule comes to mind.
The term for the hacker you referred too is a "penetration tester"
The one who exploit the rules win games.
Although in this case it seems different, I can't help think of Phil Mickleson's golf loop hole.......just doesn't seem right
Until player has tuched the puck" technichally the goalie would have to stay put indefinatly because the player never actually touches the puck...
I think people underestimate and underappreciate the role trolls play in society. The founding fathers were OG Trolls, Dr. Martin Luther King was a troll, Barry Goldwater was a troll. Trolls aren't necessarily bad, they are simply annoying to certain groups of people who have power. Because a troll is very different from a bully. A bully attempts to maintain their dominant position in a hierarchy, but a troll isn't at the top of the hierarchy, they are usually the outsider or outcast attacking the dominant. Sure, there are really awful shitlord trolls out there, but even they play a vital part in the marketplace of ideas.
"The guy on the right is an unfunny dumbass. It seems like an interesting format, but both people have to contribute, which isn't happening here.
The commentary generally is also mediocre."
This guy is a hero, but Bill Belichick cheated by calling a receiver ineligible.
It's like when someone hacks into some company and then they hire that person to write their new security software.
Actually....the rule books SHOULD include the first instance that required the rule to be created, along with the rule. Both for interesting history and for the same reason courts cite precedent when making decisions
God I hate people like that that find some stupid loophole and then do the equivalent of going "not touching you, not touching you... " and then think they're so smart. There should be a blanket statement above the rules that says "spirit of the rule, not the letter of the rule, has to be respected" that gives the referees discretionary powers to shut down any loophole if and when they come up even if they are technically legal under the letter of the rule.
Have either of you actual played a sport? At all? Ever?
Sean Avery rule :))
White people
What a stickler for rules
Bilicheck of Hockey?
RIP Roger Neilson
That last one, what is preventing a defender from putting his stick down there while the goalie leaves, and go get a new one from the bench, or change on the fly?
Way to go making an interesting topic into a ridiculously boring video
Man i wish i could erase my memory of this vid just so I could rewatch and feel the same sense of awe
These guys are total soyboys hard to watch
What if you build a snowman in front of the goal, then put a jersey on it and make it the goalkeeper?
"This is how Bill Belichick does so well
He always finds small, small loop holes to get any advantage

Bend but don't break the rules"
Rodger do you want to build a snowman??
Guy on the left looks like dusty from Just Friends!
There is also a story mentioned by Brian Mcfarland in his book about Roger Neilson coaching the Peterborough Petes(Junior A in the OHL team). He thought his team would need a lot of timeouts to keep up with the faster team(I think the London Knights) so he had his farm team for the Petes sit behind the bench and everytime he would tug his ear, the farm team was suppose to throw eggs on the ice, resulting in a "unoffical" timeout giving his team a breather. The only problem is he forgot to let the coach of the farm team know, so when the coach showed up and found his players throwing eggs on the ice he kicked them out and sent them home to think about what they were doing. Roger went to pull his ear, and no eggs came, turned around and the whole team was gone.
0:25 hah gottem
"Me and my friend exploited the game of capture the flag. (The version of capture the flag that we played allowed you to pull someones belt to get them out as long as you are on your side of the center line, so you can get them out by grabbing their belt from your side even though they are on their side) we developed a strategy where you would get out of jail by getting freed by another player on your team and on the way back grab the belt of someone camping by the center line, then with the belt in our hand we would jump onto our side of the line, land, and pull the belt off. 




The teacher banned the tactic ):"
You could do one about the rule implemented due to a goalie flipping over the net durring a 2 on 0 to face a penalty shot instead of 2 people at once.
Avery rule !
Roger, you are a genius
Sean Avery should be in the Hall of Fame for his screen on the Brodeur.
This is so hilarious:D Where I am from, Peterborough Ontario, we have memorial statues and public schools named after him. I've never heard any of these storiesðŸ˜€ Totally have some new respect for this guy!
Hockey sucks..
Not the hero hockey needed , but the one it deserved
actually someone invented the shot clock in basketball to make the game more interesting
I feel like all of these could be avoided if you just had a rule against unsportsmanlike conduct or being disruptive. It's actually a good thing for rules that constrain the real world to contain a little bit of ambiguity like this to leave room for discretion, because no set of rules can anticipate and describe every possible scenario that can take place in the real world.
Leaving a stick in front of the net is still exploitable. If your stick breaks, you have to drop it, or you will get a penalty. If the goalie intentionally breaks his stick in front of the net and drops it, then the ref can't award that automatic goal, because the goalie is still technically playing by the rules.
Hey I know a kid named Seth, i also baby sit this kid that sometimes play imaginary games and he doesn't let me get anywhere

"I didn't know these things about Roger Neilson, even though I was always a big fan of him as a coach. Here's another anecdote about Roger: On 4/29/82, Roger was so fed up with bad calls by the referee going against his team that he held up a hockey stick with a white towel on top as a ""white flag"", to sarcastically indicate that he was surrendering. The move was so popular with the fans, that it became a Vancouver Canucks tradition for fans to wave white rally towels at their games. They call it ""towel power"". 

Search on youtube, ""Roger Neilson Waves the White Flag"""
The RAF's Manual of Air Force Law has ostensive definitions brought about by 'defence' claims that are ruled out of order. So, for example, Rape is defined (along with many other ostensives) as "sexual intercourse on the pretext that it is  a surgical operation to improve the breathing."
YOU LIED
Roger Neilson was a physical education teach at my high school. ;)
3:19 if no one ever did that, they wouldn't need the rule in the first place.
I don't like sports, but things like this make me happy they exist
Lol
I was that kid, and still am just a little older and still just as frustrating.
Weird rules - The Commoner Railgun.
I love to imagine everytime Roger found a loophole I can see an old hockey official yelling "ROGER!" while shaking his hand
Isn't the too-many-men thing the EXACT same thing as basketball players fouling towards the end of a game when they're behind? Fouling to gain an advantage? I'd like to see a video on this before ya'll rip on the NHL.
you NEED to do the air gait.

"126 dislikes? How? Why were you here? 
I have a feeling that Roger is like... 14 of those... just churning out fake accounts to dislike this particular video.

â€œTheres no rule that says I can'tâ€

Asshole."
The reason these rules didn't exist is because they used to play with honor back then so they weren't needed.
Please tell me they made a movie about these events
I met the man that was the reason for the 5 second holding the basketball rule he held the ball for and entire last quarter he is from Indiana and is in his 90s and still plays pick-up games on the weekend

So somone invented a game and got upset that a guy that liked playing games showed up to play :)
Omg I would totally watch Leonardo DiCaprio play an aging Roger just going about his hockey shenanigans.
Well the NHL made the Sean Avery rule lol
In lacrosse, before there was a shot clock, there was a play called "the armadillo," and it defeated the national champions by a score of 1-0.
"2:55
What you're describing is still basically legal. You can designate a defenseman as an alternate goalkeeper and have him rush the shooter from the crease as soon as he touches the puck. What's illegal is putting that guy directly next to the puck like it's a face-off so the shooter has to get past him on the first touch of the puck."
Sounds Belichickian.
who watches these videos? 2 cucks talking to each other and giggling
back in school I was that kid who always found really outlandish exploits in the game rules~ but the problem was that, well, the teachers never understood my the exploits when I explained them :/
My dad and I met Roger through Hockey Ministries International. We had been attending their hockey camps in the summer since July of 1998 and had got to know quite a few people in that organization, including Don Liesemer, president of HMI. Flash forward to the dark times after September 11th, 2001, many flights were of course cancelled or delayed. Roger was taking cancer treatments at the time in Philadelphia and couldn't get a flight back to Ottawa at the time. Don called up my dad knowing that he was in the area asking him a favour. Roger needed a way back home and he was wondering if my dad could drive him back to Canada to get his needed rest after his treatment. My dad didn't hesitate and made his 1997 extended cab Ford Aerostar as comfortable as it could be. They didn't talk too much on that 8 hour ride north as Roger was needing rest and slept most of the way. He was very appreciative and kept in touch over the phone and we went to visit him when he came to town for games in the future. He even offered to sponsor half of my tuition to attend a school in Saskatchewan to play hockey! That's how I ended up going to school in Saskatchewan and subsequently meeting my wife in high school, making a life for myself up here. Roger got progressively worse in health and while the sponsorship promise fell through near the end of his life it was understandable. His influence and meeting led to many great things for me and my dad (I made the short list for the final tryouts for the Lindsay Muskies at 15 years old, my dad became an off-ice official for the Philadelphia Phantoms) and we were grateful for his friendship. He was a great person and of course an influential coach in the hockey community. He had some terrific stories to share! I still have my Christian Athlete Hockey jersey that he signed and wanted to give to me from way back when. What a fantastic person!
he died at the age of 69 ayee
If only they had some people who knew about hockey talking about this...
I think you should interview people that actually have knowledge of the sport you are talking about... Just saying.
Lawyerball is what we called it
The Avery rule the Gretzky rule
You should do a Smokey Yunick video. Dude made nascar officials look down right dumb useing "grey area rules".
"Can't believe Barbados vs. Grenada in the 1994 Caribbean cup hasn't been done yet... its my single favourite sporting odyssey of all time!

In short...
- Overtime was sudden death/golden goal for this tourney but special rule was the golden goal counted double
- Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals to move on to the next round, otherwise Grenada would
- Barbados was ahead by only one nearing the end of regulation time... meaning they would get knocked out
- Near the end they score on themselves intentionally, to even the game and send it to overtime
- Grenada catches on, they realize that if they score on either goal, they move on! They either win or they lose by one, both acceptable
- So now Barbados has to defend BOTH nets until regulation runs out and Grenada has to play offense both ways... hilarity ensues"
"The Rob Ray rule, named after Buffalo Sabres/Ottawa Senators goon/enforcer Rob Ray:

The Bill Belichick of hockey.
Is it weird that I really respect this Roger Neilson guy now?
â€œCanadian Contentâ€ rules about player nationality in the CFL
video starts at 0:30
So do they have a rule that you can't use a 1,200 pound guy as your goalie?
I laughed so hard at the 2nd rule
He just called Dean Smith an a**hole for the 4 corners offense. Take it back
PLEASE get some rights to footage. This sucks otherwise, sorry guys
This is just stupid, bad gamesmanship is just being unreasonable. Now the rulesbook is much thicker and it didn't have to be that way.
I want to see a video about the 15 meter underwater rule for swimming!
I've never seen that sort of reaction to someone who figures out a way around the rules. They're smart. Don't you like smart people?
Pretty much when you break the game in Yu-Gi-Oh
I love coaches that get their own rules...
Love the content; hate the format
Basketball is my favorite sport I like the way they dribble up and down the court.
I think that the rule that a goalie cannot cross the red line during play other than to skate to his bench is from Gerry Cheevers skating into the Canadiens end once to shoot the puck as a 3rd blue liner. I saw Cheevers do it with my own eyes.
Lester Patrick would remove a skater and place 2 goalies in the crease. Then they made a rule for that.
i hated kids that travelled , go play soccer scrub
Is there actually a rule that prevents a player leaving their stick across the open goal to block a possible shot? Sure it's a bit risky to dump your stick there and get off the ice, but when your team has control of the puck behind your own net and the opposition is going to defense it would make sense.
THis was hilarious, ROGER!!!!
Also the first to use video as a coaching aid. Hence one of his nicknames, â€œCaptain Videoâ€
This guy is the NHL's version of the Joker.
Roger was a great coach. He coached Junior hockey for 15 to 20 years in Peterborough and every year the Petes had a good team. He would be known as a defensive coach. His nickname was Captain Video. He used video to examine how teams worked power plays and how they liked to enter the zone. This was in the 1970's. He became a good NHL coach but never had the amazing success he had as a Junior Hockey coach.
Just once please do a parody where you say " so you wana hear it?" And the person you wana tell the story to is just like" ehh im good" and it ends or you go to another story lol
first ever good episode of this series. congrats Ryan
Roger is a legend
One rule I haven't seen discussed here is when the NHL was discussing the 3 on 3 overtime they brought in Neilson to play devil's advocate.  He said that he would just pull the goalie and try to win since he would be getting a point anyways.  So they put in the rule that if a team pulls the goalie in OT and they get scored on, they would forfeit their OT point.
"check out speed walking not a great sport but look at this snippet from wiki

Men's 20-km walk during theÂ 2005 World Championships in AthleticsÂ inÂ Helsinki, Finland. The walker at the right appears to be illegal in that both feet are off the ground, but according to the current rules, an infraction is only committed when the loss of contact is visible to theÂ humanÂ eye"
I am very aware of Rodger  Nielsen.. He was one of the most successful coach's of my Vancouver canucks.  He is also responsible for the sea of " white towels waving" you can still see in the stands today. It began as a protest to what was a rigged referee system which stole our Stanley cup victory against the new york rangers. It was a wave of a white flag in " I surrender" to the refs in that final. Funny enough a couple years later he went to New York as their head coach...and eventually moved to be GM.
Bill Belichick of the NHL
I would love to see one about the fair catch kick.
3:02 this would be a great idea for a movie. "The hero saves the day by being the villain"
Talk about the Emergency Goalie rule in NHL
I found a loophole for the pulled goalie stick rule. Get one or your players to break his stick, and put it in front of the net. He can get another stick and the goal is blocked!
More Seth videos please!
The Sean Avery rule! Can't wave your stick in front of the goalie to provide a screen...Because Brodeur didn't like it & Avery was a well known ass
The old rules were better
The Canucks put a statue of Roger Neilson outside their arena, and the officials have been taking it out on them since.
"Roger Neilson was an innovator, the 3 rules he was part of was a big part of his legacy but it was deeper than that.  He was known as Captain Video because he began the NHL practice of video recording practices and games and having study sessions with the teams. 

Now in the NHL video is such an integral part of the game that they have iPads on the bench where players will come off the ice and grab the tablet to review their play and the linemates will discuss what happened and what to do next time.  

All thanks to Roger Neilson.  There's also another rule they didn't mention that changed thanks to him.  NHL rules at the time stated that if you swapped your goalie for your backup, you got a few warmup shots for the new goalie.  Rather than use his timeout, Neilson would simply swap his goalie, get a few warmup shots and do it again later in the game.  

NHL got rid of the warmup shots but you can still swap your goalie a lot."
Finding loophole in rule book is basically 80% of what Formula 1 is about (And other motorsport as well)
"How about the NBA backboard rule

I don't even watch sports but I like these videos.  Funny stuff people do to win.
"One rule that keeps popping up now and then to eliminate is kicking the puck in for a goal.  I'm sure it goes WAY back but I'll bet someone got hurt because guys were wildly kicking at the puck around the crease when their sticks were tied up.
There's a good reason not to have guys intentionally kicking at the puck when there's the likelihood of bodies on the ice but some lunkhead always says ""why can't you kick it in?""."
"I know in aviation there's the phrase ""The rules are written in blood"". 

In sports it should be ""The rules are written in bullshit""."
In football (soccer) if the ref doesn't tell you to leave the field you are considered still active even if injured. Man Utd's Daley Blind went behind his goal after a knock and in doing so, ensured that every player was on-side. The opposition scored an easy and weird goal as a result.
Do you wanna build a Snowman???? He can save a puck or two!!
Roger is an unofficial white hat hacker for the NHL, so one day he came to a game without a white hat so they made a rule where an unofficial white hat hacker must where a white hat to games to signal to the referees that he is not an unofficial white hat hacker, not an official one, RODGER!
What a great guy
This is the best one of these yet.
"Speaking of weird rules -- the origin story for the Butterfly swimming events is odd.  going by memory alone...

Originally there were only two competitive swimming strokes: breaststroke and backstroke.  Then the U.S. Native Americans introduced the ""American Crawl"".  Note that this stroke is almost universally and incorrectly called ""freestyle"", because American Crawl is the most efficient stroke, and if you can use any stroke you want (which is what freestyle means) then why use anything else?

The new American Crawl was largely dismissed by the ""European Elite"" as a heathen / savage stroke.  Sure it worked, but gentlemen used the elegant breaststroke.  Someone who wanted to win, however, took a look at how the breaststroke was defined in the rule book of the time and realized that the only requirement was that the arms and legs needed to be symmetrical at all times, and realized that getting the arms out of the water for the return stroke dramatically improved efficiency and that a dolphin kick was much more effective than a frog kick.  He won at least some races before the rules defining the breaststroke were updated, but eventually butterfly got its own set of events.

As a side note: as mentioned, ""anything goes"" is the rule for the freestyle events.  A swimmer will only be disqualified if they pull themselves along the line rope or push off the bottom of the pool.  If, however, someone invented a new stroke that was faster than the American Crawl then an odd situation would arise.  It would be perfectly legal to use this stroke in the freestyle events (and this is almost certainly how it would be introduced), but this would lead to the end of the American Crawl as a competitive swimming stroke.  The logical solution would be to create a new set of events called ""American Crawl"" and let the new stroke take over the ""freestyle"" label, but...  Almost certainly the result would be to create a new set of events for the new stroke and then change the rules of the freestyle events to either prohibit the new stroke ( ""Anything goes *except*...) or simply mandate the use of the American Crawl."
Ironically, he was known for being the first coach to use video to analyze players and game situations.
In football no penelty is a penelty unless the ref sees it so

This is by far the worst SB Nation show. Weird Rules is terrible, this guy just can't make it enjoyable. (why doesn't he move his arms?)
this video had the 2 guys talking, waaaay too much, i wanted a video about some guy trolling the nhl... not you 2 yacking away...
I believe Neilson also once only put four guys on in an even strength situation so when his team won the face off the fifth guy just got off the bench, took a pass and scored on the breakaway.
That is not cheating or playing dirty.  He was playing by the rules.  Exploiting a loophole is still playing by the rules. He was apparently the only one smart enough to know the rules.
RIP roger
You should talk about the soccer match between Barbados and Grenada in the 1994 Caribbean Cup (it even has its own Wikipedia page). Because of a weird rule regarding ties (if a macht ended in a tie, they would play an time, and if someone scored a goal it would could twice), and because Barbados needed to win by at least two goals, in the end of the match (losing 1-2) they realised that if they scored an own goal it will give them more time to score the golden goal. They scored an own goal, and then Grenada realised that they needed a goal, *any goal*, so they started to attack both goals, with Barbados defending them.
That kid is me
"Wayne Scanlan wrote a Bio on Roger, Roger's World: The Life and Unusual Times of Roger Neilson.
There is a place in Ottawa called Roger Neilson""s House which helps families that have children with a terminal prognosis. 

The book is a good read for any sports fan."
I think that there was an NFL coach (maybe Buddy Ryan) who put extra defensive players on the field (something like 15 of 16 total) at the end of games because he could burn lots of time off the clock with the extra players and the trade-off was only one accepted too-many-men-on-the-field penalty.
Talk about how Mel Blount single handily changed how pass defense is played forever in the NFL because of the rules they had to put in to stop him
Truly a hero for all times!
You know who it was that required basketball implement the shot clock.... dean Smith and UNC. The "4 corners" offense was ridiculous.   Up by 5 with 7 minutes left,  they would busy stand there holding the ball or passing it back and forth.
Did you guys even know that his nickname was Captain Video?
Roger Neilson is a pimp, we've got streets names after him in Peterborough
Bring the guy back to beef history
Could you still do the end of game thing with continuous equipment violations or something else?
A good NFL one would be the Chip Kelly rule from when he had his entire defense tackle every eligible receiver at the line of scrimmage in the closing seconds of a half
This Roger guy sounds like the Walpole of Hockey
George Mikan is the father of structured basketball. He broke the game. Pls get Jon Bois on this
How about a video on all Patrick Roy's shenanigans? Or goalie fights?
way too much babble
One of the better weird rules videos.
12,307th view 735th like 69th comment
Lawful evil
Absolute madman. He also waved a towel at the end of his stick to surrender to the refs lol
"Two more Roger Neilson stories, though not really relating to weird rules:
-In 1978-79 he was fired as head coach by the Toronto Maple Leafs; after outrage across the team and fanbase he was reinstated without missing a game, but the Leafs' cantankerous owner Harold Ballard's original plan was to bring him back as a ""mystery coach"" with a paper bag on his head, that he was supposed to take off to reveal himself at some point in his first game back. Roger refused, came back as normal, but was again fired at the end of the season. 

-In the 1982 playoffs he was coaching the Vancouver Canucks, a job he took over from Harry Neale who was suspended late in the season for attacking a fan in Quebec City, and who were en route to their first of 3 trips to the Stanley Cup Finals. During game 2 of the Campbell (Western) Conference Finals against Chicago, he felt his Canucks were getting the short end of the stick regarding penalties, so he put a white towel on a hockey stick and waved it in mock-surrender. He and three players who copied him were ejected and fined, but at game 3 in Vancouver thousands of fans brought their own towels to wave at the game, and ""Tower Power"" was born. Roger even has a statue outside Rogers Arena depicting him with the skate & towel raised."
I like learning about these rules 'n all, but please change the approach. Even when I know what's happening, it's so frustratingly awkward to hear a scripted intro "conversation". And if it's not scripted, firstly I apologise and secondly: is your father a plank of wood?
Hmm. Sounds like a certain bearded Rocket...
this coach rules
Super interesting video and presented amazingly well! Def watching more of this :D
Ain't no rule that says a dog can't play hockey
There should be a movie made about this guy
Roger Nielson was an absolute legend.  There's a reason why there is a statue of him in front of my Canucks home of Roger's (lol what a coincidence) Arena.
Whole video on roger Nielsen but no mention of waiving the white towel smh
Brent Bielma did something sort of like this, he would kick the ball out of bounds, which would take a few seconds off the clock. So that would just end the half- without the other team ever getting the ball back.
That is so wired because I was just watching tv and Canada pulled this off
Also, Neilson suggested that his goalie should break his stick and leave it in front of the net, when substituting for 6th skater. That was the rule then, and still is for skaters, that they must drop their broken stick. But for goalies, they are allowed to continue playing with a broken one so they would not break their sticks and leave them in front of the net.
You can talk about Taro Tsujimoto or how the Sabres drafted an imaginary player.
This guy should've been a lawyer.
You should really do a video on probably the most important example of breaking (or circumventing) a rule ever: when English schoolboy William Webb Ellis, during a game of football (this was before soccer or gridiron was a thing) in the mid 1800s, he ran with the ball instead of kicking it, creating the sport of Rugby (and, by association, American Football/Gridiron) in the process.
"So far it sounds like many of these rules episodes were found by searching for â€œbiggest ahole in ____â€, picking a candidate, and looking at the fallout. 

Now I'm no tennis fan (and golf has been covered) but given some of the characters and antics, in a straight forward game, I'm sure there's a goldmine there. I vaguely recall a rule about who you can talk to on court that doesn't initially make sense, and there's probably a better rule waiting with a story."
This format is just so wack and not in a good way. Do we have to have a conversation where one friend is educating another? The fly on the wall thing with randomly breaking the fourth wall just doesn't work. Good idea, bad execution
What a legend
Not all heroes wear capes...
Pure lawful evil
I'd like to think at one point he actually just had a fully built snowman play goalie one game so he could have the whole game 6 on 5.
Go Canucks Go!
Love this hockey content guys!
Always wondered if you dressed one of those guys that weigh 1000 lbs as a goalie and sort of form fitted him into the net. He wouldn't have to move, you could even just leave him there between periods.
my coach
Truly a legend of hockey history. He was also the first to analyze game footage and is credited with introducing the rally towel to the NHL when waved a white towel on a stick to mock surrender because felt the refs were being biased.
Not a weird rule but it should also be noted that Neilson also inadvertently brought the rally towel to the NHL.
I'm gonna go get the papers get the papers
"You should do Pop Warner and the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Half the classic rules in football were written to stop the Native American team and their clever coach from beating rich white kids at football.

Stuff You Missed in History Class did a great podcast episode on that."
You could talk about the Mankad in cricket, in a game full of weird rules, that one's one of the weirder ones..
NFL weird rule idea: On 11/27/2016, with the Ravens leading by 7 and facing a deep 4th down in the dying seconds against Cincinnati, John Harbaugh told all of his players to hold one of the Bengals defenders. P Sam Koch waited for the time to run out and backed out of the end zone for a safety. Because a game COULD end on an offensive penalty, the game ended and the Ravens won. I believe the rules have been changed since.
Ain't no rule says a dog can't play basketball!
"According to Bob Miller's Autobiography about his time on the Kings, that rule about the goalie stick across the empty net was actually the idea of Roger's wife. 
So a wife of a coach is credited with a rule in the rule book."
67 days since the last Chart Party ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
neat.
Another idea for a hockey-based video: You could talk about the Brodeur rule, implemented first in the NHL and AHL solely because the greatest goalie of all time was too good at handling the puck.
This has gotta be my favourite video yet!
One of the better episodes of weird rules

better be careful with that GoPro at the Chillers. They definitely dont like when players use those. Even if its within the helmet. You think those refs would have noticed...

I don't get why some people freak out about the GoPro. Who cares
GO PRO IS BACK Your the best NASHER, Nasher how do I stickhandle Better Like you
after the first goal, they just keep coming
JC is crazy
Can you guys come to my channel and watch my videos. One is about NHL 19. Might do some real hockey videos.
Why don't you go play in the echl or AHL buddy if your so good?
The difference between a good beer league player and a low level pro is honestly insane. I've played with a few buds that got drafted to the show but never cracked a roster and they're so much better than anyone on even the most competitive beer league I've played in. It's shocking to play with that kind of speed on the ice.
Didn't realize you played a little...who did you grow up playing for?
lol number 69 2:29
Played roller against JC, small world.
Way to go man, u should be in the NHL
anyone know what strategies nasher uses in HUT?
Love you videos
Yaaay it's back!!!!
Lmaoo jc
Never knew Casey played hockey
Why does his stick look curved when he's on the bench
Whos mans is number 69
My dad works for the team called the Colorado eagles who are now in the AHL but he was pretty good when they played them
You are pro
I love you
Dude you look so blazed! ðŸ˜‚
4:01 you need to be on his left shoulder and force him up the wall, he spun you because you overplayed that
Men's league hero !!
I didn't know there was a rule against GoPros in his new league, I thought that he had just stopped.
U are terrible
Nice vid
Cant wait for roller vids
Hey nash u should go with kvg hes a goalie
Put J.C on your HUT team
Yes GoPro hockey I am so hyped from r the season
I pissed that u cant do gopro any more because of that stupid rule
Do you wear a cage or visor nash?
I'm 15 years old and I get to play hockey all the time with Dainius Zubrus and Darius Kasparitis. They're insane
You had a hat trick! Nice!
#69 is a unit
Can I get a LETS GOOO
Used to watch Campagna in my hometown, Fredericton. He played University hockey on the island here in Canada, and when they came in town to play UNB, my hometown University team, he was always a standout, one of the best on that team, and in the league, no question. Fun guy to watch, guy could be so much more than he is.
Go pro hockey!!!!
Nice vid Nasher
WOOOOO
Nasher is a boss
10 bucks nasher won't pin this and if nasher livestreams I will donate 10 bucks
greasy
Yes I love these! So glad to see a new one!
Road to shutout!!!
JC was a coach at Turcotte Hockey School and he was the nicest coach there!
This surely looks like the roller hockey rink
Yay, another great go pro hockey video, can't wait for more of these and more of nhl 19 videos. Thank you. Also good luck to the blue jackets this season!

Is that Casey Neistat?
Serious question what's JC doing playing at this level? Was he friends with someone on the other team? Or was he brought in to help the white team?
JC is back! GO ALLEN! Rock your red!
Your videos are amazing
I know JC Campagna because he played for the Adirondack Thunder, a team I have season tickets for.
YES GOPRO HOCKEY!!!
Wait, so how were you able to use the GoPro??? Is this a different league
Oh yeah that was goooood
nice
We play against a team that has a sick ringer played in the Q... guy is a Class Act he steps it up and ties the game up for his team and that's it. He lets everyone else go at it after that but if they fall behind he creeps them back up again. Really nice guy
Eu sou brasileiro
For people who don't know what a ringer is, its someone who is playing wayyyy below there skill level. Mostly in beer league
I am so happy that you are able to do this again
Casey Neistat in the thumbnail?

Did they beat the spread?
We beat are biggest rival today ( battle of the highway) 52-6
You're a GENIUS
Cumberland practices sound like sarcastiball
I bet you the Cumberland team could still beat the Jayhawks.
I don't know what this is, what it's about, or if I even care - but I think YouTube is to blame for showing me this.
Cumberland got a football ball team
Whatâ€™s even crazier is that Cumberland beat LSU 41-0, Alabama 44-0, Tulane 28-0, and Vanderbilt 6-0 IN A FIVE DAY SPAN!! Yes 5 total days they played 4 teams. 3 of which are SEC teams and dominated. So yes Alabama and LSU have a losing record again a team that lost 222-0.
Where did u get the foot ball figures from
No no no. the best fact about this is that after threatening Cumberland with the $3000 reimbursement, Heisman offered Cumberland $500 and to pay for the trip to atlanta for the team. Like Heisman was hellbent on proving his point to cumberlands coach and the sportswriters
your intro creeped me out lol
I can't believe all this happened in one game! That was only 55 mins.
Can you make a list of states who had the most college teams to win a championship. Also which states had the most top 25 teams within a season. I believe central Florida, Miami, south Florida,  the Gators and, also Florida state all where in the top 25 this season if I'm not mistaken. So that's 5 teams in 1 season and, state right there. Also most in top 10 they auburn and, Alabama and. Also gatotors and, ucf this year.
I'd pay good money to watch a team of law school frat boys get destroyed by a pro football team
the end reminded me of DHMIS
Show this guys videos to any person who doesnt like sports, and they'll kinda have to like sports...at least a little.
"0:00 ""It's now been 100 years since the worst....""
Me: Alright I got my explanation."
Im surprised this unholy beatdown hasnt been made into a movie.
This has to be fake
Who the hell was that asshole center who snapped the ball directly at Peewee or whoever? Was he actually a good snapper and wanted a laugh? Was Peewee standing in the wrong place?
So what were the 27% of yards they didnâ€™t get
"Alabama fan here

This game is possibly the only thing that could make Nick Saban happy"
This was pretty good.
Imagine going back in time and seeing this game
Why does this game remind me of that episode of family Guy where Peter plays football for the London Sillie Nannies?
13:00 it said they wrapped their arms around each other's shoulders. Not tied their legs together. If all the rest of this is true I would totally believe that too.
What an interesting documentary about Nebraskaâ€™s football team
Not a fan of either team. So no bias. But from the title and intro (paused at 0:51) this will probably be the most enjoyable sports video I've seen or, will ever see. And this is coming from a Lsu, and Saints fan. So I'm pretty much wired to dislike any Georgia team.
If I go back in time Iâ€™m going to this game
This is totally insane. Never knew about this game. Thanks
People talk about running up the score. THAT was running up the score.
15:06 donâ€™t hug me Iâ€™m scared
I thought GT had like 931 rushing yards pr something. Ik they didn't throw a pass. You 400 something amd yet that had over 1100 yards? Where did the other 600 come from?
What a great video
My god this soundtrack sounds like a horror movie
If you had Cumberland and 200 points, you lost!
I was gonna thumbs up this vid until I got to 15 mins and my ear drums got blown up...â€¦.wtf is wrong with u disliked. in the future don't put loud annoying sounds for no reasons.
Good video until the end...my God the sound editing is atrocious
Start at 1:12
Legs tied together? Was that Reggie Ray?
Im 5 hours deep in a shroom trip and then i get to the end of this video... Thanks Jon.
Because we are all equal in todayâ€™s society I think both teams should get half of the total score, so it should have been 111-111
Heisman seems like a bitch made man after this video
As far as I can tell, St. Viator playing against Lane College a week later is the closest anyone got, with St. Viator winning 205-0.
Loved the video man, keep it up!!!
I read a book that had this story in it, it's called the giant book of strange (but true) sports stories
The end of the video about the "climb the ladder" play made no sense. Doesn't tell why his face was so busted. Kinda dumb ending to a good video.
Outstanding story!  Would love to have known the sizes of the players involved
they should bring the cumberland team back just to replay this game
I can't imagine the pain that the toy football players faced in the creation of this video.
Jesus Christ on the cross bc you might as well consider this game a crucifixion
6 1st downsðŸ˜‚ oh my god
Damn I live in Cumberland, RI. I thought my hometown was fucked.
It is sooo distressing at the end, D:
Today marks the 100 year anniversary of this massacre
15:05 to 16:03 was one of the creepiest things I've ever witnessed and then it makes a complete turnaround in mood at 16:05
They couldnâ€™t have an actual quarterback but they have 2 guys who could throw another guy over a fence
"Oh brother, you win you win! That was freakin hilarious!

Great video and true story."
Are you gay and single or curious and unhappy in a relationship? Because I love you for this video.
We want Jon Bois back
I canâ€™t breath Iâ€™m laughing too hard
After 15:00 is insane. Iâ€™m gonna have nightmares
14:53 I cannot stand the music so much that I disliked the video
Iâ€™m horrified this is like saw but a football game
The end just turned into how to basic
"Cumberland College has a football team today and they have won games as an... I dont know D4 team?
Just as a tribute to this game Georgia Tech and Cumberland College should play one game a year just to see if this record can be broken"
does anyone now what the song is in the intro
"222 points with only 6 first downs

nice."
Wow.
If I was the Cumberland head coach losing 140-0 and John Heisman refused to end the game at halftime, I would've just went back to my locker room and told my team to get on the bus. We're leaving. Now.
Lmao I lost it at a dog chasing one of the players
15:10 this sequence is unholy
"@Jon Bois
Did you used old Starting Lineup football figures for your video?
I don't know if you'll ever read this, but I'm a big fan, and am hoping you do more of your 'Pretty Good' series. I really enjoy sports writers that grew up in the same Era as me and watching/reading there opinions on things. Later Jon."
Is that an almond
whats with the annoying music
This needs to be made into a movie.
The University of Alabama has a 0-1 record against Cumberland ;-;
sports writing meets german expressionism.
Go Jackets!
Hey, Iâ€™m dying to know what the last song is. I love it. Anyone know?
What was the last part
Jon bois that book is 300 dollars are you a millionaire???
16:22 wait a second. GT scores 222 points... but doesnâ€™t throw the ball once
SOMEBODY MAKE THIS A FUCKIN MOVIE.
This is gayest historical football fact in history.   Tech fans like to bring it up as if it matters.  They were complete pricks to Cumberland for beating them in baseball earlier that year.  Cumberland disbanded its football program.
This is some of the most creative, well written, and entertaining content on youtube. Thank you for the hard work. This vid is incredible.
It truly was a game of Blood Bowl.
"Why 55 minuets?
Edit: guess I should have watched first lol"
15:38 â€œBAH GAWD! HE KILLED HIM!â€
Football practices are now trending towards the Cumberland model.
Are You dead or something
amazing video quality, keep it up
15:17-15:55 wtf just happened? XD
Just a piece of advice work on special effects audio the final climb the ladder sequence had a painful sound reminiscent of nails on a chalk board and wasn't helped by the fact that you raised the volume to the max
This is like an old school horror movie. It's horrifying but it's hilarious.
That record is proudly held at CC
Itâ€™s funny because any d1 team now could go back in time and beat the ever living shit out of that Georgia tech team
I thought I was looking at a cricket score.
I have now born witness to the wrath that only a true God would reap upon those who sully his realm.
If I had a time machine and could only go back in time 1 time to do anything I would 100% watch this â€œgameâ€
I go to Georgia Tech.  I was on the wrong side of an 84-0 intramural football loss by the GT Wesley Foundation to SHPE.  The halfs are 15 minutes and the only time the clock stops is at halftime.  SHPE scored on over half of all plays (offense and defense).
Football was a joke sport back in the day. No wonder baseball was way more popular.
You could choose to kick or receive after every score? What kind of assy rule is that??
Instant classic
Did the music scare anyone else?
Doesnâ€™t really count considering they didnâ€™t have a team
This one was boring
This video is why I laugh when people bring up great athletes of the early 1900's.  The rules and balance of competition in high end collegiate and pro sports was a joke compared to now.  UConn clowning everyone by 50 in WNCAA basketball is like the status quo for athletics back then.
This music is making me wanna scream
Moral of the story is don't cheat, and dont fuck with John Heisman.
â€œHe grinds your bones for breadâ€ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
If every Armenian were to throat-stomp every Turk at this exact moment there wouldn't even be close to enough malice to match what Heisman drew out from this miserable game.
Sports writers are right remember the Phillies had a terrible season in the 18-19 season and then the destroyed the marlins 20-1 and now they have a winning season actually never mind this was posted when they did
I love your videos but can you REGULATE YOUR FUCKING VOLUME PLEASE.   DAMN.  The narration is quiet AF the whole time, then you play the cut music at like 250% volume.    NOT COOL
JON BOIS the legend!!!!
8:48 â€œhis teammate was looking for his glassesâ€ XD ðŸ˜‚
I was there. It was fucking bananas
...grey duck.
This is such a shit sport.
This needs to be a movie. Fucking hilarious.
this is art
opening titles song please??
This was fucking terrifying thanks jon
You're a smart dude, but can't mix audio to save your life!
Iâ€™m legit scared
10:50did he get a steak
if you score three runs off bunting im beaning the next batter because i might be trash but im trash with self respect
My brothers football team beat this one team 50 to nothing in the first half and the team had to forfeit because they didnâ€™t have enough players because they had been injured
3:29 - Top 10 Anime Plot Twists
Heisman was petty AF
Does he purposely use a bad camera when filming himself?
Stop-motion, Jon? You are amazing. I love your creativity. These videos seriously have me wondering what took me so long to find them.
Please tell me there are music credits somewhere. The avant garde during some of your animation segments is incredible and I need more of it in my life.
Soundtrack name at 3:31?
Lol they make students today pay more than cumberland would have had to pay if they didn't arrive at a football game. lmao
Hey Jon, whatâ€™s the song at the end?
Jon. I say this honestly. You are headed for great things.
"Heisman made them play a 30 minute scrimmage after the 222-0 win"
This is like a Jan Svankmajer film.
Notre Dame would booty-blast both these teams
"My two cents:

1. This is why I absolutely refuse to give a thousandth of a rip about any stats or results below the semipro level. When you have future pros and those barely a step above junior varsity competing on the same field, there will always be huge massacres. And they count jack squat toward anyone's ability to do this for a living. You ran for 200 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Southeast Idaho Spudflingers? Big whoop. Do it against the Baltimore Ravens and maybe I'll be impressed.

2. Whatever contributions John Heisman may have made to football, he was absolute garbage as a human being. G.E. Allen pulls a douchenozzle move on him, and his response is to be an even bigger douchenozzle. Not calling him out, not demanding a public apology, not taking the issue public and getting a serious discussion going on chicanery in college sports, he is going to get his petty, pitiful, stupid, meaningless revenge. And he did it by getting men who had NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL to do with the sham baseball game SERIOUSLY INJURED, many almost certainly FOR LIFE, and then making the most token effort to mitigate the carnage long after he'd made his snivelling little point. ""God"" my flabby, blotchy BUTT.

(P.S. To anyone who wants to give me that ""It was completely acceptable at the time!"" line: Save it. If you can't figure out on your own that getting numerous innocent men badly maimed is an automatic ""no"" regardless of what society says, you're scum, period.)"
The story behind this game is so utterly bizarre I can barely believe it actually happened.
"His name...was John Heisman

chorus of death plays"
"If you are talking about massacres, you should mention the biggest flogging in first-class cricket history, when Pakistan Railways defeated Dera Ismail Khan by an innings and 851 runs back in 1964-65. After scoring 912, Railways dismissed Dera Ismail Khan for just 32 and 27 runs respectively in their two innings:

Georgia Tech are assholes
Jesus! Not even the Browns are that bad! The Browns would have at least scored one touchdown out of that, or at the very least reduce the number of points they were beaten by.
shiver me timbers, bitch
Not Another Teen Movie did it with the Reggie Ray "Concussions To Go" counter. Also little Timmy, who "shouldn't have been on the field in the first place" and got decapitated.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
I'm pretty sure there were no first downs by either team in this game.
Downright Lynchian
Please make more of this series!
The fact that a man ruined his face to block an extra point in the biggest blowout ever is really sad to me
How are you able to take football, a fun game that people like to play and watch, and make it deeply upsetting.
I love how some of the Cumberland players ran away and hid
Wow, what a story! Thank you for posting this.
16:06-17:19 What is that song?
I wish I could have seen the play that he described starting at 6:14
Nah this shit is scary as fuck man
Iâ€™m scared
these lawyers..well..all lawyers deserved it...but how cruel was Heisman making his team scrimmage after the game...wtf..was he a SEAL?
This is simply the best video in the history of Youtube!
My god it's been a year and a half since this came out
This was the funniest football story ever.
@Jon Bois Tell me you smoke weed every day, because I smoked before and while watching this video and it was PERFECT.
This video gave me nightmares.
It's not that I want to know where this music came from; I just want to know why someone would write something this offputting
This is sad.
Ehh if they lied about tapeing 2 players together, then they could of lied about most of what actually happened during game..a player jumping over fence to hide from other team, but 2 people were already hiding there, so they throw him back on the field so they dont give up their hiding spot?
Even the one good Cumberland play, the blocked kick, ended up working out terribly for the blocker.
"This was an actual nightmare.

but at least the ball was an almond :P"
"This should be a movie.

A horror movie."
"NOTE: Because Georgia Tech never passed, and Cumberland actually completed one pass play for a gain, this means that, despite losing 222-0...

... Cumberland had more passing yards than Georgia Tech in this game. Yes, that's an actual, legitimate statistical victory for Cumberland in this 222-0 game."
They angered a God ðŸ˜‚
"All of this because some dude over at Cumberland had to be a dick and thought embarrassing another team would be a good thing....


Talk about karma"
Wonder what the score would have been if they played the last 5 minutes
A TEN YARD PUNT??? The fuck...?
As a soccer announcer would say: "Not much football being played today"... lol
After this vid Iâ€™m genuinely terrified of our lord and savior John Heisman.
It is still a rule in HS that the team who was scored upon can choose to kick or receive.  A coach took the option to kick one time after he was scored upon since he was winning by so much.
Anyone know the song at 16:30?
You and captain disillusion are the two most deserving of a robust patreon. I hope youâ€™re still at it. Iâ€™ve been binging you for about a week now. I very much look forward to whatever you do next. #NextLevel
oh my god I'm drunk watching this and now I'm terrified of Heisman's face
Pretty guud
Not really equivalent, what happened between the baseball team and what happened to the football team. The baseball players for Georgia Tech may have been less capable than the players ringed in for Cumberland, but at least they had some experience. Cumberland's football team wasn't even that. It was a bunch of random law students. It isn't that impressive that they scored 222 points against what was effectively thin air.
i find it EXTREMELY hard to believe that someone got knocked out by a football hike to the head
I have a newfound hatred for Heisman now. Thanks Jon.
Go dawgs
Why isnâ€™t this a movie yet, I am dying over here!ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
This may be the saddest thing I've ever seen
Song at 5:01?
Wtf happened to Edwards? Did he suffer from a skull fracture?
That's not difficult all you need to do is put the game on rookie and play against the browns. You could get some crazy scores. Don't forget to have the 15 min quarters.
I like how the football is an almond
"His teammate was looking for his glasses" i cant not laugh. XD
My God, I love the fact that this has a soundtrack like There Will Be Blood -- what a perfect parallel; the time period, the setting, the grind-your-teeth determination to become a man-god... Heisman needs to be played by DDL, I'm now convinced it'd be his magnum opus simply based on that photo of Heisman
as a Georgia tech fan this is actually pretty good
"That was pretty 
                       good"
2:05 Award a blue ribbon to a supernova?, how can it receive it its too big, unless we have a "grow ray" to make the ribbon about the size of the milky way galaxy.
I fucking love you Jon
Can someone please  tell me if this type of music in the intro is a certain type of jazz or it It just someoneâ€™s jazz in general
Love how an almond was the football
11:48 I only just now realized that you were making this in an office while other people were also working
Speaking of the architects of football, the penalty flag was invented by the first head coach of my university's football team :D
The football is nut
"Legit channel...
Subscriber"
Fantastic storytelling!
What's the music for this video?
Hey jon, Iâ€™m not sure if you already answered this, but what music did you use?
And then Georgia Tech lost their winning streak to the Muddogs all because of The Waterboy.
Just found this channel. Been binging all morning! #snowday
Just finished the dumbest boy one  and now onto this one. Its now 11:13
This sounds like a cartoon. Looney tunes football would have similar events
The almond is the best
The biggest blowout I was ever a part of was 103-0 the first quarter we scored 45 points with our first team, the second quarter the coach put the second string in and they scored 36 (with 3 defensive touchdowns), third quarter was our jv team and they scored twice. And the freshman team, who didn't even dress for the start of the game but at halftime the varsity team changed into street clothes and the freshman put on pads, got a touchdown, but they did block the 2 point conversion

Jesus Christ
Is anyone else horrified with this story or is that just me
that took a real dark turn lmao
Are you okay?
The option of receiving or kicking after scoring a touchdown was an old rugby rule....
It's a good thing that the game was shortened by 5 minutes. else the result could have gotten embarrassing for Cumberland
What's with all the crazy sport stories out of early century Atlanta?
Dude!!! Great soundtrack!
This is a lot scarier than it should be
IIRC, in the John S. Bowman-Joel Zoss recap of this game for their Football Hall of Shame series, some writer actually asked Morris Gouger after the game if the outcome would have been different if that kickoff returner hadn't have tripped over his own player. "Yeah, it would've been different. It would've been 222-7." Great recap, Jon (P.T. Anderson envies you this depiction!)
According to one source I read, the third quarter was cut to ten minutes and the fourth quarter to seven-and-a-half minutes.
Holy shit work on your audio game
Good vid
RIP Edwards, the man was absolutely obliterated
those law students probably had PTSD
I don't think Monty Python could even come up with so many odd and ridiculous things to happen
I love your videos, but 10:35 never happened. Thatâ€™s completely impossible.
Thereâ€™s no way that 10:35 happened in real life. Thatâ€™s impossible. Use your head, Jon.
ðŸ˜‚
Love the video, and I get you're trying to convey the grim tone of the game, but, by God, the music and sound balance are ATROCIOUS.
Iâ€™ll be honest I have watched all of the chart parties and pretty good videos at least 3 or 4 times... these videos are so good... hopefully another one comes out soon
first foward pass was 1895 UNC vs georgia 70 yard score.. not notre dame like a "movie".. john heisman gives credit to the unc play but it happened 20 years before the next pass in major college football would be attempted .. some small college attempted a pass i think in 1906.
Christ almighty, whata score
Wow
I live near Cumberland so this kind off saddens me
"I'm a wramblin' wreck from Georgia Tech AND I SHOW NO MERCY!"
How does this keep turning into surreal horror!
You should make a video on Utah Utes football team, how theyâ€™ve performed vs their recruits and how far theyâ€™ve had to grind
GT still didn't beat the spread. Maybe next time.
This is the greatest analytical American football video in the history of YouTube. No question, no answers. Full stop.
Stop making your videos scary
That was a mammoth beat-down
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is scary
"I donâ€™t know why but this creeps me out because it was way back then and shudder
Itâ€™s creepy"
Why did they keep trying? Why would you sacrifice your own face on something as desperate as a ladder play when the score is 221-0?
its ok i guess
Why doesn't he post
My god... its full of sÌ¶tÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶sÌ¶ scores.
Is that an old Van Houtte coffee cup?
Frau HEISMAN <thunder crashes>
11:17
fun fact this video was uploaded on my 21st birthday? does this mean i was born on the 79th anniversary of this game?
You can actually STILL choose to kick the ball off after being scored on lol
What in the name of fuck was that minute near the end
15:10 so did he break his nose by jumping to high and crashing into a UFO ? the fuck is happening here, is this the strychnine kickin in ?
Actually the reason why the 1940 Chicago Bears won in such dominating fashion was because their head coach invented the T-formation that everyone uses now in that game. Before the game started the Washington Redskins were actually the favorites to win that game.
John Heismann was clearly a monomaniacal dick. The Cumberland players should've simply laid down for every play. The Tech players might've shown them more mercy. Still, that's what Cumberland gets for cheating at baseball.
This is ridiculous that this really happened lol
His name was John Heisman.......cue dramatic horror music
"I like how you say GT players got bored....
They didn't have any remorse literally tearing those guys to pieces? I mean damn. QB got 3 concussions?! 
Thank god I didn't grow up in the good ol days...."
This video is one of the greatest works of art ever created by man
They should make this story into a movie
The ONE TEAM worse than even The Cleveland Browns.
It's like the end of WW2 on the eastern front
Jon, make one about the ball that bounced over a pebble TWICE in the same game, giving the 1924 Washington Senators the city's only-ever World Series title!
So many things went wrong I wish I could have seen that
HOBBES?!?!?!
make a new video please
Receiving the kick after scoring iscthe norm in Rugby, but not in sevens,
That music from 16:05 to 17:18 is simply the best.
And they still canâ€™t beat Bama
Shout out to Marigoata.
You need to really equalize your volume. What the fuck was that shit, no one wants to be constantly adjusting their volume
Jesus a damn headphones warning would have been nice. But besides that awesome video.
I always wondered how this happened awesome video
Wut
after watching that I'm hoping that there was some big time karma for Heisman.
15:00 is where you lost me.  It was excessive, and unnecessary. We're on youtube watching about football, not a cryptic murder mystery.
Wtf happened to his face
The football is an almond lol
This channel is kinda creepy but I like it
Wait wait wait, is George E Allen related to George Herbert Allen, the Hall of Fame Rams coach? Huh.
Anyone else watch this at 4 AM on the toilet before going to sleep?
...that is one hell of a grudge..
How is 222 to 0 even possible... I mean seriously. Just by myself 1 person if I do nothing but let them walk over at a brisk pace for a touchdown with 0 resistance, and then take a knee every single time to burn the clock they still would not get 222 points in 4 quarters...
Heisman seems like a fun guy
I've watched this video a couple of times and literally just realized that in the stop-motion intro with the green figurines, you were using an almond as the football...
they should make a movie of this game
He will grind your bones to make his bread... I love this series
"I don't even like football
Damn that was a good vid"
Prettyyyyy Pretttty Good....
This guy managed to execute a trippy dream sequence with toy figurines. Nice.
What is the name of the book?
Trying to sit through this hipsters narration caused more pain than any of those cumberland players could have endured that day.
Do you have it written in the language of your contract that you get to include at least one ear rape per video?
stolen video
I bet the Cumberland team could still beat the browns
The part about the climb the ladder play was kinda horrifying. What the hell happened?
Sounds like bullshit. I mean I donâ€™t doubt that they lost so bad but really the story sound s fake as shit lol.
Pee wees could play better than this
DAMN  I HAD THEM BY 269ðŸ™„
Heisman Sounds like a dick...
"15:04
Did that scare anybody else? lol"
This is a great video great presentation on this game with some comedy thrown in I love it
"The obscure jazz music is AMAZING. Itâ€™s ironic use is comedy gold. This stuff could be studied in film school. Iâ€™m serious and i love it.

Iâ€™m probably late to figure this out but Jon Bois is a genius."
"Reading about this game.  Some stuff is exaggerated here.  Like Preas catching his own kickoff for a TD.  The Cumberland player he kicked off to actually returned the kick for 10 yards..... but then in Cumberland fashion, fumbled (one of NINE fumbles Cumberland lost this game).  Preas just recovered the fumble and ran it in 10 yards for the TD.  I'd hardly call that ""catching/returning"" his own kick for a TD.  

Also, I'm reading Heisman agreed to shorten the quarters in the 2nd half to 12 minutes a piece.... not the usual 15.  That would be him agreeing to shorten the game by 6 minutes, not 5 like you keep saying.  Yeah I'm being nit picky here, but I'm a stickler for accuracy.  

Finally..... to call this a true feat is a bit misleading if not BS.  The Cumberland team disbanded its football team prior to the season but due to an agreement had to play GT otherwise they'd have to pay GT $3,000 due to lost gate receipts for GT.  So Cumberland grabbed 12-14 dudes from a fraternity to play against GT who at the time was the best team in college football.  It would be like Alabama today playing against a bunch of random students from another school.  Sports in their infancy stages in the early 1900s were a joke compared to what we see today.  That goes for every sport..... at both the amateur and professional level."
15:04 I bet you have beautiful nightmares
Your video is awesome! What a crazy story, first I'd ever heard of it, insanely interesting.
"I'm gonna destroy your football team" but Mr Heisman, we don't have a football team "well then get one so I can pummel it" but "I'll financially cripple you if you don't" yes sir sorry sir
Cumberland University is actually my hometown's school. It's as shitty as that score
After all the silly crap in this â€œgameâ€ why wouldnâ€™t you believe they tied two players together as one lol
This should be a movie.
Law students shouldâ€™ve sued
Terrible narration.Â  Uninteresting.Â  Goofy accounts of 21 men falling down or overrunning the play & the ball carrier trips overÂ a teammate whose looking for his glasses?Â  Just stop it, already!Â  A complete waste of time.
My dad was offered to play at Cumberland when he went 2 college their because they where desperate 4 players and my dad had never played football before but he played soccer but he turned them down
13:00 omg im dying. That's too funny.
If you team give up 222 points, you don't even need to be playing football. Throw the whole football program away. ðŸš®
one time in 7th grade or football tea held a team to -26 yards
gt were 221 point favorites
If you have Apple turn on classic invert at 1:00
i wish this would have been on film
Why do they float up into the ceiling
Poor Edward...
He trips over team mate
How long did it take to make this?
Lol I went to Cumberland my freshman year.
What do you use to create and edit the animations in these?
I really wish there were cameras to video this game
how is this even possible??
4:07 did you see September 30 They beat Mercer 61 to nothing. Pretty high, but nothing compared to their next game...
Why was the football an almond?
Who knew John Heisan could be so scary
this is so god damn beautiful
How is it even possible to be this bad
they should totally be a movie
i laughed so hard at this
Not gonna lie, that music at the end scares the shit out of me
This kinda reminds of the London silly nanies vs the patriots in family guy
32 touchdowns, 6 first downs, 0 passes lmao
This is horror
Heisman is the moron who invented the forward pass? Screw that guy for ruining football!
It's Duck Duck Greyduck not Duck Duck Goose.
JESUS FUCKING CRIST! THATS SOOO DAM BAD IT MAKES THE BROWNS A SUPER BOWL CONTENDER!
maybe they gave you the choice of kicking or receiving if the offense is extremely tired and you know that the defense could stop them. Still an odd rule though.
Where do you work to be able to do this?
It's an almond
Heisman... that photo screams respect me or be smithen. He's been dead a long time but if he were alive and gave me that look in the photo.. shivers
Still better than the Browns.
I believe the reason you would have an option to kick or receive at this time is that there was no rule that the ball must travel 10 yards to be recovered by the kicking team. It wasn't until the early 1920s that the NFL established that rule. So I imagine a team would opt to kick gambling that they could recover the ball in better field position, knowing that if they choose to receive anyway the other team has the choice of attempting to pin them deep, or gamble on field position and attempt to recover the kick themselves
Really nice video, good job
I would've liked to watch the game
Why all the obnoxious sound effects at 15 minutes?
This is the worst editor of videos ever
Is this a football game or a horror movie
Watching this while watching the patriots game
15:35 did the world end
This must have been weird to referee
I never knew a football game could be so weird and creepy
Was edwords the one the only SCOTTTT STEARLLLLING
31 touchdowns and six first downs.
I don't understand the graphic at 10:15.  What does "yards left on field" mean?
Dude you need to manage your audio levels better, sound effect were waaayyyyyy too loud.  Had to turn volume down then your mic was so low I couldnâ€™t hear so had to turn it back up
worst d3 team vs alabama and the record would be broken
It was a farce.
This is a good scoreigami
I wish there was a vid of this game
Well Cumberland did have more passing yards?
Stop the sounds
Why the creepy ass music
I was crying for most of the video
The Musique Concrete at 14:53 gave me an anxiety attack.
Dude that music at the end like 10 times louder than everything else
Nice video but the sound difference between music and talk is far to big I love to keep my ears in one piece
The lesson is: Never Anger A Football God
I'd like a full reenactment with real actors of this game :D
this has me in fucking stitches
"I could see it in future if rules were changed a bit. 
CUMBERLAND 2







BROWNS 0"
tomorrow is 111 years! Half the score
i know this video is over a year old, but who the hell thought putting that annoying ass music in this video and then said "lets make that shitty music 4Ã— louder than everything else in the video"? this video wasnt made so far back that there was no equalizers. one rewatching of ur own video could have made this an excellent video, but no u just edited it and said "fuck it, everything is fine". went from a like and a favorite from me for the good content, to just me leaving this shitty comment about how u can edit correctly.
The moral of the story: do NOT piss off John Heisman.
g
John Heisman be like "Bill Belichick? Never heard of her".
11:51 imagine ur just going about your business at SB studios and Jon Bois has set up a huge mini football field in his cubicle.
I disagree with this being the worst beatdown ever. They won 222-0 in football, there was a 108-3 beatdown in baseball once. I think that's even more extreme, considering the modern equivalent is 30-3 for baseball and for football it's 73-0. The Cincinnati Red Stockings won 108-3 against the Union Club of Urbana on May 25, 1870.
AKINATOR!!!! FOR THE LAST TIME, IM NOT LOOKING FOR SECRETARIAT IM LOOKING FOR A MONITER!!!!!
How about a Pretty Good episode about Centralia PA.
That was on old picture of GT stadium with the old ACC logo
this is depressing.
The music is so creepy.
What programs do you use to make your videos? They're super well-made!
That's what you call a schlacking!!!!!! It's so unbelievable you have to say it like Sean Connery!!!!! lol
The kick off caught for td doesn't seem possible, either he ran 80 yards in 3 seconds, or he kicked the ball 300 meters high. So some of the recounting of this must be inaccurate. I mean after 100 points would the official scorer even care anymore.
Lol they kinda deserved it tbh. It was such a shitty thing to do in the first place so it figures he'd want his revenge.
It would have been 222 - 7 if the teammate wasn't there
This was one weird game
That's fucked up
Somewhere I read that the 2nd half of this game was shortened to 17:30.
I would have loved to watch this game tbh. It sounds so damn entertainingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
So this is why Georgia college football iswhat it is now, karma
Can we get rid of the hardware store music
Of all the weird crap that happened in the game why don't you believe two injured players weren't tied together and sent in? Are their other weird accounts you don't think actually happened?
I bet the lawyers could beat the Browns
Hey, 35 yards is a pretty good punt for Cumberland
0:00
Is this real
Absolutely brilliant using a steam engine losing traction at 1:52 as an audio metaphor for the football game being a ridiculous blowout.
"My question is
Why r they playing football while every other male (old enough) where fighting in WW1. Weren't they drafted. And an entire male generation and almost 2 was lost in the war. 
I salute those true men (rest in peace to all men that died in the war and in WW2)"
This isn't impressive
Go Dawgs
lol I live in Lebanon and I go to Cumberland all the time also my mom went to Cumberland
Wtf I was unsubbed from jon for no reason
Nice profile picture.
This turned into a how to basic video
imagine if they made a movie about this game?
Fishy woods is the fucking goat
Speak up ur way to quiet
i like the horror music ðŸ‘
Is Cumberland College still a school? Do they still have a football team?
I wish there was footage of this gameðŸ˜‚ðŸ’¯
Imagine getting your face fucked up like that in a game as pointless as this one... it makes my soul cringe
This video made me hate Georgia Tech
Yeah this video is a fake. Not a single clip of the game. You are pathetic and it's no wonder you are such a loser. I'd kill myself if I had to be you.
Thanks for the constant ear rape
I would love to see this game todau
What the fuck was 3:31
Lmao wtf. I would just walk off after the first play save urself from injuries , embarrassment , etc
first video of yours i've seen, absolutely love it, great editting and i love the little details you put in like the stop motion
How come CUMberland couldn't score 444 points??
Dang I had Cumberland as my fantasy defense
Jesus the LSD trip at 15:08 is fking insane.
He runs and hides behind a fence, and two players also hiding being the fence throw him back over the fence.
Love the context but I can barely hear you. Turned up as loud as I can I can hear everything else but the voice.
Disliked because that music was so fucking loud, fuck you
This one game is not a football game, this is a genocide emerged from leather and fear. They could have at least tried to comeback with 1/4 of what they had.
Uploaded under brutal to porn hub
F O O T B A L L
This is art
"They only got six first downs from scoring 222 points.
Six.  
ROFL"
how about a decent mix on one of these videos?
That was the most annoying minute (15:00 to 16:00). Most annoyingly frustrating noises ever.
I dont know how i got here. I don't even know much of American Football. But this videos is glorious. It's like a fever nightmare that combines one of the wierdest statistical sport event in history with the aesthetics of a Kubrick movie. I love this.
Hey it's not Cumberland College it's Cumberland University
What does it mean by yards left on the field ?
How can they associate prestige with this assholes name?!?!
Falcons could still figure out way to lose
Just a reminder that the figures seen in the video are playing with an almond
Who else is here from FivePoints Vids?
I had no idea my Madden game needed a step up.
You make fucking great videos
I remember telling my friends older brother about this game and they laughed at me for a solid hour. Â This was years before the internet so I couldn't prove it.
Back then rankings were by how many points you scored. There is a great book "You Dropped It You Pick It Up" about the game.
I am born and raised Lebanese living in Lebanon TN most my life. Cumberland is my hometown college. This lost and home to Cracker Barrel is our claim to fame. The UT Volunteers avenged us last Saturday.
Can I have that almond
my schools god damn junior team could do better
These videos are awesome
Wild dogs still exist in Detroit
The whole "kicker catches their own kick-off for a touchdown" has happened several times in the Arena League because of the nets behind each endzone
Whoa.
15:12 How did Wood manage to fly into the sun?
after hearing the two players tied together part it sorta wrecked it for me. made the whole story sound bullshit.
6:53 I just finished the video, and I'm still laughing about this play ðŸ˜‚
If you had Cumberland with 200 points, YOU LOST!
I got a pretty good story you can do. It's about a highschool basketball team that played a majority of a game 2 vs 5 and even went to 1 vs 5 and still managed to win. I don't remember the specifics of the story but it was really interesting. I think it would make a pretty good story. I heard it on a NPR segment
Man cumberland almost won it was tight!

Can someone please explain to me what happened to woods face on the last play
Jesus chill with the scary music its 3am
Wish there was footage on this game
A sound warning please? That ending almost made me deaf
Anyone else here from procrastinators?
You should start uploading these again I love these
When the 2016 Cowboys offense faces the 2013 Cowboys defense

Actually Tom Landry invented the shotgun snap

It can happen but a Division 1 FBS has to play a D2-NAIA
7:22â€“7:32 I don't know about college or NFL, but kicking off after you got scored on is still a rule in the NFHS (High School) rule book.

What happened to his face
Oh my ears what a sound
In madden once I did that but controlled both teams the losers would endlessly do safety's and winners would throw Hail Marys vs kick block plays (Max points=256) but I counted points to 300
What exactly happened on the climb the ladder play?
3:31 JOHN CENA
Gosh men are stupid
The Ball was a walnut LMFAO
that "ladder play" was hysterical ðŸ˜‚
I know literally nothing about american football, but it doesn't matter because this was hilarious
I'm not a football fan, and watching this video has left me traumatised.
Hopefully no one bet on Cumberland to win this game
osu scored 128 in a game
The one where they sit in a circle -- is that game 4397? What year did it start, 12469?
oh my god!!!!! i lost it when it was 77-0 and they had a chance to score on the kickoff with no opponent near him. but then he runs over his teammate and is down. the player was looking for his glasses!!!! I WAS LEGIT CRYING IN TEARS !!!!!!!!
The music is retarted
Hey, Jon when is season 3 coming my man, i love your show even though you're a chiefs fan
ur videos r cool man
"it was great until the 15 minute mark. 
then you went all ""art project"" and ruined it."
"""WHERE'S YOUR GOD NOW??!!""
â€“John Heisman, that day, probably"
I know the coaches there
I live in Lebanon
Anyone else get a creepy vibe from this vid?
EmpLemon Shouted you out bro! He also shouted out Urinatingtree
Damn Hiesman invented the forward pass and didn't even pass the ball once.
if I ever get a time machine I have to see this
Can I get a roast beef hoagie on wheat?
This is just cruel.
This is the most absolutely horrifying thing I have ever witnessed in relation to professional sports. The sheer number of circumstances that existed to make this happen is nothing short of absolutely insane. I love it so damn much. You do not fuck with John Heisman. He will extract vengeance on you and your entire school and their sanity and their very souls. Attempting to use human language to sum up this event is an insult to it's magnificence. You're better off making an assortment of horrifying mouth noises to describe it.
anyone from emplemon
15:09 Special guest appearance by HowToBasic
This is pretty good
3:34 WHO BROKE THE VIOLIN!
Is this real?
The music at 15:20 reminds me of when SpongeBob goes to the future
Holy shit Jon keep doing what you're doing.
Omg 222-0 I almost fainted
"I'm pretty sure the ""elect to kickoff after the opponent scored"" rule is a vestige from rugby. In Rugby union, the scoring team always receives after a score. This is because field position can be more important than possession. In rugby the ball is turned over way more: A fumble if the ball goes forward is a turnover regardless of who recovers it; running out of bounds is a turnover; a forward pass is a turnover; and play doesn't stop at a tackle, so the ball can be ""poached"" by the defense at any time. 

This means that the scoring team receiving the ball deep in their own end of the field is a gain for the team that was just scored on.

100 years ago, American football was still working this all out. Fumbles were more common, and the ball moved much more slowly than today. So if your team got scored on, it might be a good strategy to elect to kickoff again in hopes of making the opposing team punt from deep in their own territory."
"i've never heard sound work that made me say 'that guy should make a full-length film'
you should make a film. i'm guessing you have. you've certainly wanted to. link it. do it. link it.
i'm also a guy you've probably heard of, so you should do what i say."
your intros are pretty good, m8
My grandad went to Cumberland ðŸ˜‚
I'm watching with 222k views
Hey, I love your stuff. You are a terrific storyteller and narrator.  Please though work on the audio. I am specifically referring to the section where you had the agonizing music playing to symbolize the agony that the game was, but the levels for the music made it unpleasant to watch. On some level, that choice makes complete sense since it is supposed to make it hard to watch for the viewer, but it comes out of nowhere which hurts the listener and makes them want to turn the video or audio off. I still love your variety of story telling using facts and narrative in a cooperative manner.
this video was a work of beauty
So they scored 222 points w/o a forward pass? Lololol
Hey! That's pretty good.
I just witnessed a massacre. A stop-motion, plastic man massacre.
15:10 - 16:00 looks like a how to basic video
Hey Jon, I don't know if you still read the comments on this one, but if you do, I have a story. I first saw this video in December, maybe January. Just a few weeks later, my grandpa was dying in the hospital, and my mom was pretty absent from my life for a little bit, spending basically every spare moment with him. I was putting off going to visit him, because I was scared. When I finally did go, I told him this story. It was the last conversation we ever had. Thank you for making this video. Thank you for giving me one last great memory with the man who passed his love of sports, storytelling and oddity on to me.
Vishe woods part made me die of laughter I'm cryingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I believe this is what you would call a Scorigami.
GT didn't even pass
great videos but your musics are far too loud compared to your voice
Probably what would happen if I tried to play football
"Pretty good.

A series made up of videos that are pretty good."
where can we buy this book
the time the Cumberland player just layed down with his "dead" teammates at the ten was oddly depressing to me
did anyone else notice that he used an almond for the ball
when you set madden to rookie
Rookie mode on Madden.
this is the fakes thing ever lmao
what is it with the ear rape
This was lit
yes, well done!!!
My god imagine the Georgia tech defense fantasy points
Do a pretty good for the Michigan v Appalachian State game
Please make more of these
i cant imagine any organized sporting event at any level where the players choose to lay down on the field instead of play the game. like i don't think 6 year olds would do that
Wow that game really went down to the wire I thought Cumberland had it at the end there
This needs to be a fucking movie
"A lot of people try to give advice on how and why you should change.
Keep doing exactly what you're doing"
Just guessing, I'm pretty sure kicking after being scored one was a rule for 2 reasons. 1, a holdover fro Rugby. and 2nd, because offense was far less prevalent at the time, it could be advantageous in the field-position game if you were confident enough in your defense.
No. Way. This is impossible literally!
Is there any footage to this game
Still a better love story than Twilight
Literally you couldn't make this stuff up ðŸ˜‚
This is amazing content. Needs to be recognized! Keep up the good work man!
I've watched this video like 6 times in a row because it's so entertaining!
The Cleveland legend heisman
His name was.... Robert Paulson.
The music at the end was horrific
Guess what?!?  I live in the city with the worst beat down in history!! Lebanon TN!! lol I live 5 minutes away!
this was kind of creepy
This was sickening.
They punted on third-and-one!?!?!?
How the fuck did he catch his own kick. That sounds impossible
On the team bus or train back to Cumberland, it could not have been pleasant for the 2 guys who spent most of the game hiding in the bushes.
Well, if you put a D1 college football team against a group of law students who have never played football in today's time, the result would be pretty similar.
somebody make this into a movie!!!!
This is by far one of the most entertaining sports "documentaries" I've ever seen. The Heisman pictures had me in tears!
lol it's shocking this really happened . Amazing fucking video my friend. The time put into it is noticed and appreciated. New Sub
15:25 turn your volume way down
The amount of shit that happened in that game is just stupid. A kicker caught his own kick
Make more videos?  Please?
I am a Georgia Tech graduate and even I feel sorry for Cumberland College after knowing the full story thanks to you.
Vichy Woods is SCOTT STERLING!!!!
I used to play with those football figured
this dude needs more subs
I wish there was a video of this. It sounds ridiculous ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
All of these rules changes and shit would never have happened either.
This shit was sooo funny ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Anyone know the song at 16:33?
You should do a pretty good on the 1908 National League Pennant Race.
15:28 earrape
Man your channel is probably if not the best the best sports channel on YouTube
In my opinion this is the biggest L in history
200th comment
I remember this game,  feels like it was just yesterday
and people only talk about how "no one will ever beat wilt chamberlain's 100 point game" um that seem more possible compared to this, even if they tried to on purpose just to make history it would still not be possible to do this
Holy shit this game is like a collection of amazing short stories tolled into one game
Does anybody know if or when he'll do more of these?
Great vid. Inspired by 2001? lol
"JUST LET THEM DIE JOHN
PLEASE"
Nice video
This scared me
When your team sucks in call of duty.
13:10 LOL
"Grown men" they were college kids btw. Not grown men.
Um, wasn't Cumberland opting to kick rather than receive after scoring the sensible thing? They clearly weren't going to advance the football far, so they get better field position by kicking off rather than punting (or fumbling) from scrimmage.
lol
These stories are always fascinating because they are so at odds with the way we usually idealize the past.  We tend to think modern sportsmanship among many other things has gotten a lot worse over the years.
Great job! Very entertaining and surprisingly informational.
Did anybody realise that they misspelled Tulane on the program at 6:06?  They spelled it Tulan; not Tulane.
15:00-16:00 I was so close to just jumping out my window. Holy shit.
"15:00 - 16:00 was honestly hard to watch and the audio was badddd

great vid otherwise"
first good laugh in a long time
I love how they use an almond as a football
this wasn't a video... it was a work of art... good job...
did How To Basic take over at the end?
As crazy as it seems, I don't think it's necessarily completely unbreakable. Some insane shit happens between those Division III schools. Hell, half of them barely take some sports programs seriously, like the Caltech Mens' Basketball team who lost like 3 hundreds of games in a row for like a decade before finally snapping the longest losing streak I've ever seen in any organized sport.
There gave been literal WARS with less malice.
it's sad your in such a fancy looking recording booth, but the volume of this video is so low.
THE FEELINNG WHEN YOUR A RAMBLING WRECK FROM GEORGIA TECH, BUT A HELL OF AN ENGINEER!!! God I wish we were still this dominant XD
Worst ass whooping ever
I actually live in the town where Cumberland University is. I can check to see if they have any records of this.
Do you have a list of the music played in the background? It was a very beautiful soundscape and I'd like to look more into it!
Disclaimer: Don't watch while high
I wish we had video of it
that violin music toward the end was overbearing and went on for way too long. However, I like this channel and this video!
This was terrifying
Hey, that's pretty good
This took a dark turn at the end
Heeeey that's pretty goood
imagine how much the band had to play the fight song lol
I've never laughed so hard in my life lol
what happened to his face
gods way of karma in sports
Put a seizure warning here dear God
Wow great video dude ! I really enjoyed these lovely practical effects.
sounds like most of that book is fiction
What happened to his face
I really shouldn't have watched this before going to bed...
I respect you for the amount of time you put into this masterpiece. Thank you!
why do i find this creepy
What was that montage starting at 15:11
This video gave me nightmares
this video is lowkey super creepy
when you have 0 pass yards ans win by 222
one time Vanderbilt scored 340
Georgia Tech was playing chess while Cumberland was playing candyland
CALVIN AND HOBES!!!!!
Lol at least Cumberland can boast more passing yards
John Madden: The only reason Georgia Tech won is because they scored more points.....lots of it
"This should be a scenario in NCAA 17. 
(Is there an NCAA 17? I don't have a console. Maybe that's why everyone is saying ""Madden"" despite these not being fucking NFL teams!)"
down vote just for the obnoxious music at 15 mins insane and no need for it
This is the most fantastic video I have ever watched
Man... Heisman is a straight up savage
so did vichy woods receive permanent facial injuries, or was that just temporary swelling?
I think most of us would be in the same position those Cumberland "players" were tbh...
Yeah! I'm a gt fan!
I had Cumberland +221 in this one...bad luck.
A part of the story that I don't think is true is the guy catching his own kickoff. Not even the fastest player of today could run 70 yards downfield while a kicked ball remained in the air.
This is hilarious! Totally cheered my son up after WMU lost earlier! Thank you! <3
you know practice had to suck that next day
11:53 who's that in the back??! ðŸ˜±
As a tech player this makes me smile
why wouldnt they just kneel it and run the clock lol
I've never been interested in sports, but the particular subject matter that you cover and the way you tell (and reenact) the stories you choose to tell are immensely entertaining and informative.  I feel like this video did an excellent job of, in a matter of just under 35 seconds, imposing how important Heisman was to modern-day football to someone who has never actually watched a full game of the sport in his life.
I want to see the box score so I can see the fantasy scores! This is crazy!!!
This story is amazing! love it man! I laughed so damn hard lol
are the things you said at 0:05 real things that happened?? or did you make them up?
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME !!!  Well done.
omg lol this is crazy!!
I wish all historical sports blowout analysis devolved into a Lynchian nightmare.
I wish you or someone though would do something on that time the Washington Generals won cause I've always been curious about it
your show is the best show about sports
as always, amazing video
This took a real "Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared" turn at the end
8:35 HOW CAN YOU BE THAT BAD?????
pretty good Jon
So something like 7-1 when translated to football/soccer?
Damm now I want almonds.
There are about 5 things I don't believe a word of.
I mean I can't let no one score that much while I'm on the field I would have to fight someone before that happens
They fucked with Heisman!?!?!  That's like angering Lombardi, what the fuck XD.  They angered a God.
and i thought i was being mean for wanting washington to put up 80 on oregon
Finally you're getting the views you deserve
Damn, that was like in Jackass 3(?) when Preston took a kicked ball to the face.
It's poetry that on the day after you uploaded this, Michigan annihilated Rutgers 78-0.
"Jon, wheres breaking madden?


And also, this is a true work of art. I've been looking for an accurate account of this game for months, so i ordered Heismans First Trophy: The Game That Launched Football in the South by Sam Hatcher. Maybe you should give it a look at."
You're pretty good.
What is the intro song?
gg no re
That isn't a beating, that's a war crime.
As someone with little interest in football, I think this video's great. The animation, editing, narration and use of music are on point, great job man/
Belichek would be proud
I died
This feels like a real life version Breaking Madden.
Is that Stockhausen at the end there?
I love your videos but please work on your sound balancing.
Heisman and Tywin Lannister would have gotten along well.
Step up your webcam game. You got a good mic.
unsubbed... too many ads
Please turn up your audio level.
Please keep videos like this coming! We love it!
Jon, this is amazing. Well done.
as. one. man.
Wait what happened to Vichy?
Jon is this series just secretly a way to justify to your boss why you're playing with plastic football figures all day
Interesting video!. What allowed Heisman to threaten to fine cumberland?
"Pretty Good" is a terribly presumptuous title. These are "so very tremendously fucking good."
Awesome video! Love the stop motion re-enactments. Can I ask how you did the motion graphics in the stadium? Like what programs you used to get the 3D stadium and track in graphics?
Song at 5:00 Anyone?
I am in love with your style of stop-motion animation. It's uncanny how you make faceless, motionless plastic figures convey so much emotion.
Pretty good
how do you find these amazing stories?
You should do one of these on soccer games. Like when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0 or when AS Adema scored 149 own goals against SO l'Emyrne
ever heard of audio levelling jon?
Your channel is absolutely amazing.
You talk quietly and then play loud sound effects.  I hate you.
A little bit of HowToBasic at the end?
These are seriously amazing I die laughing every time
Reminds me if a Texas highschool basketball team that got beat like 110-0. I can at least see a team never scoring a touchdown or a field goal (though allowing 222 pts. worth of them through your defense is obscene), but how the hell do you never score a single basket?
What did your co-workers think of you playing with football toys and recording it with stop motion for hours
Wow, that 1916 Georgia Tech football team was pretty good.
Where did you get the information about Vichy Woods?
Best video I have seen in a long time. Thanks jon
Real life Breaking Madden.
YES, I've been waiting for a month, I love your series man!
Halloween theme perfection. This is horror.
Am I the only one that doesn't understand anything? Did the bad team lose on purpose?
"just like to say that these are so good, whenever they get uploaded I stop what I'm doing/watching, and start casting YouTube to my TV... and I have next to zero interest in American sports.

favourites so far are the marathon, and the drug addled baseball player."
"Jon, recreate this game in Madden. 

It's your destiny."
this is so good
Since you are on a streak about horrifically inept teams, consider doing a video about Andrea Moda, the single worst team in any motorsports ever. https://web.archive.org/web/20080509074334/http://f1rejects.com/teams/andreamoda/index.html
that was pretty good
Pretty good but the sound quality is not great when you're narrating
jon this is amazing
Awesome!
Love the original format of this show
The only way I could have imagined that score if it was some sort of exhibition, Harlem Globetrotters situation. The truth was way more interesting.
great work jon! it's a shame more people don't see these
"Greatest match of any sport ever! (at least for someone who doesn't watch sports)
I wonder how is this not a movie"
Seeing this in my inbox made me so happy
That editing really brought out the brutality that poor Cumberland had to deal with. You're a great story teller Jon. Keep it up.
I wonder what iDubbbz would say about his series?
The title totally killed that joke in the beginning
These stories are insane to me because it shows how "wild West" sports were back then. Can you imagine a team dressing a minor league team for a college game today?
As always Jon...this was pretty good. Keep up the pretty good work!!
First!
music that starts at 19:15 pls?
Then explain why the nfl put out an article saying the patriots almost scored the first 1 point safety against the bills on 10-29-18
Awesome video mate!!!!

I've got a significantly better scenario for the 6-1 game.  It might even be borderline plausible.   First of all, we're gonna put the game in very poor weather conditions (rain/snow/sleet).   Now, after one team scores the touchdown, they go for the extra point, which is snapped from the 15 (13 yards closer to that safety than going for two).    Maybe we tack on some extra yards for a penalty or two.   Now we can get some kind of chaos on the PAT (bad snap, blocked kick, etc).   The defense recovers the ball, tries to return it for two, and a fumble occurs near the goal line (in part due to the ball being wet and very difficult to handle).  We get a recovery by the kicking team and a retreat into the endzone with a tackle for a one point safety.
This video was awesome
Um you can score 1 point it is called a feild goal safety it is when you try to score a field goal and get it back all the way to your own end zone
Hear me this. I Cordell Erskine bring of sound mind and good faith do solemnly swear, if 6-1 scoragami is ever achieved, I promise on that day I will begin the process of getting a sex change.
"Washington NFL Team" Perfect.
Time to update this bad boy
What a video. Love it
last week 37 to 5
just so everyone knows a rouge is for a touch back
You should make a real Scorigami chart that frequently gets updated ðŸ˜‚
OCTOBER 21, 2018, COLTS VS BILLS 37-5 SCORIGAMI!!!
Washington NFL team. I guess you guys are offended by words. DBAP
"For anyone really really interested in this topic, or like me, is finally happy to have found other people think about odd scores in NFL games, there's a site that maintains a scorigami chart to the most current week of football.

https://nflscorigami.com/"
U can now add 40-43
nfl is trash
2018 Scorigamis: 48-40, 29-29, 43-40, 37-5 GGGGGG
What would suck is if a team actually scored the 1 pt defensive safety, but then also scored a fairly rare regular safety in the same game, and ended with 3 points. That would kill every Scorigami lover out there.
Another scorigami on 10/22/18 between the Colts (37) and the Bills (5)

Do a college football one
Whatâ€™s the name of the first song (Intro)
Most interesting video I've seen in months
Ik I'm almost 2 years late but you win a game 2-0 on a forfeit because nobody gets credit for a safety
Who else could see the Browns losing 6-1
I just realized how close the bears had gotten to that last year against Pittsburg it was a pick that he ran all the way back and fumbled in the end zone but it ended up going out of bounds
Cmon chiefs you almost had it 40 - 43 so close to making it happen again
"That was sad, let's keep it sad."
I don't get it.
My team made scorigami last night 42-54
The only reason the scorigamis got higher is because black people started to play in the nfl
I LOST A GAME IN HIGH SCHOOL 4-3. I feel like nobody ever appreciated it so this video makes me very happy.
WE NEED AN UPDATED VERSION!!!
I like to revisit this gem from time to time. #HeresToYou4-4igami
I don't even watch football or follow it. I just clicked this video and found it interesting.
This video is incredible.
U can get eleven points eight plus field goal equals 11 but ok
"Scoragami: 43-40 Patriots Vs Chiefs

This is a nice ass video ngl ima put on my hijab to this
This is really cool
Most recent scorigami https://twitter.com/NFL_Scorigami/status/1051676153642213376?s=20
I now want to see a 6-1 game
This is such a 2 am YouTube video
A 1 point safety is possible look it up itâ€™s super hard and awkward but itâ€™s possible
this video keeps appearing in my dreams. idk why, but i cant stop thinking about it, its so fascinating. i need updates on scorigami after every season. please, someone. if you see this, do it for the children, we need this.
How am I just now finding this video
Wonder how much Doug Pederson will get for going for two quite often
I think I watched this like month after this came out and Iâ€™m back lol
Always knew there was something special about 43-8
There is a one point safety, yes, you can get 1 point.
Iâ€™m just mesmerized by that dark scorigami music tho, can someone identify it pls
Patriots vs Chiefs 2018 scoragami! 43-40

1 point safety look it up
Where do you get your data from?
New scoragami alert. 43-40 Pats-Chiefs
Pats v chiefs, 40-43, scorigami heavenly
Browns Ravens was a few seconds away from the first 9-9 tie last week
I wish I had as much free time as this guy.
Hey buddy, 43-40 scoragami yesterday
It was 1932. Watching a scoreless tie was better than playing Monopoly at home because those were probably the only things to do during the depression.
That browns vs chiefs game is the most browns thing ever
"Scorigami October 10th, 2018.
New England- 43
Kansas City- 40."
Patriots vs Chiefs scoragomi according to commentators 43-40
18:30 is when 6:1 score is talked about.
Scoragami Patriots vs Chiefs 43 - 40
Of course teams never actually try to make scorigami because they don't know what it is because it's a word i made up...
It just happened last night. Chiefs Patriots 43-40 first time ever
For some reason this reminds me of a hypothetical super bowl of The Packers vs The Patriots when both teams were 1 and 2 Offense...and 31st and 32nd Defense. Analysts were joking the score was going to be 98 to 91 with over 900 total yards on offense.

Scorigami! Patriots 43, Chiefs 40
Pats-Chiefs 43-40 Anyone?
"I never considered how unlikely a 14-8 score would be just strategically. There's no natural scenario where it'd make sense to go for two when it's 0-0, 7-0 or 14-0, so it'd have to be a situation like a team is up 11-0, the losing team scores and goes for 2 to make it within a FG, and then the winning team tacks on a FG at the end.

Either that, or it'd have to be a situation where a team goes for 2 regardless of the score. This commonly happens in adverse weather, which then makes the other team getting 14 points less likely. The remaining scenarios are like the kicker pulls his groin missing the first FG attempt of the game, so they just go for 2 the rest of the game."

Cfl you can get one point for missing a field goal
How much do I have to pay you to make basketball videos like this
Why are you even including the odds of an overtime game in your 4-4 calculation, by assuming it's 4-4 you are already assuming that it does go into overtime so the odds should be 260x less
But youre scenario for the 1 Ã¼oibt safety would be a touchback... Team a would have had tonrecover the ball before the endzone then run it back and the get tackled.
"15:11 ""...because it's a word I made up""
Lol"
"I'm in the severe minority here, but I'd love to see you do a scorigami for rugby. Like american football, there are plenty of combinations. You've got the 3-point penalty goal, the 5-point unconverted try and the 7-point converted try. 
Its cousin rugby league (no they are not the same) is even better for scorigami because you have the 6-point try, the 4-point unconverted try, the 2-point penalty goal and then the 1-point field goal. That last one makes essential any score possible, if not extremely rare. I've seen scores in top level rugby league of 8-1 or even 2-0."
Ive watched this before but i love this vid cause i love the music at the end.
What is a 5 point play in basketball?
"Was the AFC division playoff game between the Steelers vs Chiefs in 2017 Scorigami? It was 18-16

Edit: Nevermind, it isnâ€™t."
I love this video so much and often come back to rewatch it. Probably my favorite part is that observant fans come back after every new scorigami and comment about it. Also my one hope is for Jon Bois to reappear and save us all!
11-4 is my ultimate scorigami!
Can I have a part 2???
I would like to know what the most common scores are through NFL history like top five
6:26 Washington NFL team?  Oh....you mean the Redskins.  The Washington Redskins.  The team from Washington that is called the Redskins. I don't know if this was a mistake guys, but it seems you forgot that the NFL team in Washington is called the Redskins.

How do they score one? A blocked extra point ran back for a score?
I like the idea of the NFL adopting the one-point rouge. Somebody should start a petition!
Iâ€™m confused about the 2-0 Akron safety. So did Akron block the punt, then the ball hit the fence at the end of the end zone, and then an Akron player picked it up?
I thoroughly enjoyed the Seahawks segment. Go Hawks!
There actually was a one point field goal made in college in the 70s, didnâ€™t watch the whole vid so idk if he said that but just sayin, cu. of that any score should be possible
Nice music 10x louder than voice.

1-0 is possible lmao
Can score 1 point by safety on 2 pt coversion
I have no interest in American football, but this video was really interesting and well made
You said "Until the day [the defensive 1 point conversion] is done, there will always be one hole on this board," but actually there will always be one ENTIRE ROW on the board.  Even if the 6-1 happens, we'd still have the like 13-1, 16-1, 20-1, 27-1 (etc).  And those are the easy ones.    8-1 would be the 6-1 plus a safety.   10-1 would be the 6-1 plus TWO safeties.    10-1 might be the most impossible of the achievable Scorigamis (i.e., not something ridiculously high scoring like 1807-1800).
So the bears have sucked since the beginning?
Bravo if youâ€™re watched this whole thing

Scorigami Week 1 2018 Bucs vs Saints 48-40
The rouge is stupid, I hope the NFL never adopts it.
It's one thing for that 6-1 score to happen, but for it to be only highlight of the game is another
"Week 2 2018: two scorigamis already this season. Packers tie Vikings at 29; Bucs beat Saints 48-40.

Here's to many more this season, including the elusive 20-11."
This is my entire reason for loving football.
The rouge is cool but being how the NFL doesn't want kick returns, it won't happen.  I have seen a CFL game where teams kept punting it back and fourth on the same play.  The game was tied with no time left and if the team backed up didn't get the ball out of the end zone, which by the way is 20 yards deap, the game is over and they lose.  There was one time where a team was kicking off right before half time.  They kicked it short and the player who received it instantly punted the ball back.  It landed in the kickoff team's endzone with no time left for 1 point.  I posted a picture on Facebook where a game started at 1-1.
so youre saying that we, seahawks fans are unbelievably loud? damn right we are!

How much time did you spend on this. Love the vid btw
I think it can happen. All someone has to do is get too cocky and then the ball gets stripped and then recovered and then the tackle and all that. The hard part would come with keeping the game scoreless till the end.
You can get a point by making a drop kick

About that 6-1... LA Tech vs MS State
Forfeits are 2-0 because thatâ€™s the lowest possible score.
So 6 to 1 is possible, but that means that ANY NUMBER to 1, 8 to 1 or above, is also possible..
It doesn't help that its the dumbest sport in the world. Running into each other at high speed to get hold of a weird looking ball that you can't kick (unless the rules allow) across a line or in between two poles.
Well the chart says...
Found this video with no views, incredible stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawcHSpzRLk
you are forgetting about the very obscure 1 point safety
Canadian Football League is better
Why did this give me chills?
I dont understand what it takes for a game to be a scorigami game
There is actually a 5th way to build up 8 points exactly. It would have to be 8-6 in order for it to happen. A touchdown with a missed extra point, then an opponent touchdown with a blocked extra point, fumbled two-point attempt, or intercepted two-point attempt for a defensive two-point conversion. (6-0 then 6-6 and finally arriving at 8-6)
Idk if Iâ€™m proud or ashamed I watched this whole ridiculous thing. I was entertained, I must say
Yo. Good job with all the research. You worked hard. You deserve more views because you actually worked
Washington "NFL team?"  No, they're the Washington REDSKINS!!  No "PC" please!
Buccaneers 14 Seahawks 5 is a scoragami
Of course it was the two coaches with a rivalry anywhere they went
you can get 1 it is called a 1 point safety
I was at the Chiefs at Browns game. ðŸ’”
Any score is possible
Best video Iâ€™ve ever seen on YouTube
In madden like 2011 or 12 me and my brother accomplished the 1 point play a couple of times on purpose.
At Syracuse, Donovan McNabb threw an interception at the goal line that was returned to the opposite goal line.  McNabb chased the defender down and forced a fumble.  It would take a s in molar play to get that 6-1 score. Does anyone remember that mcnabb play? Cant find it on youtube....
What software was this made in?
Bro you forgot that rugby can also work for scorigami, what with the 3 point penalty, the 5 point try, and the 7 point converted try.
This and the Barry bonds video are my favorite Jon bois videos
Scoragami CFL?
5-0 Browns vs Eagles
We just got a 5-0.
His good idea of a game is no defense?
3:20 you say "2" but your chart clearly shows four games that fit the criteria
Isn't 1-0 the official score of a forfeited football game, and therefore possible?
This video needs an update on the what's happened.
Scorigami Thursday 8/23/18 (yeah yeah ik it's pre-season) but we have an 0-5 with the browns beating  the eagles!
Miami (the U) defeated Florida 31-4 in 1987, the only college game I know in recent memeory where a team had four points
The 1970 Cowboys had two scoragami games in three weeks: 6-2 at Cleveland and 5-0 vs. Detroit in the divisional playoffs
The only people that dont like shutouts are casuals or people that never played. Watching a defense impose its will is just as exciting as a great offense
4:37  I'd guess the odds aren't exactly like that, considering teams that don't score in regulation probably have a LOT higher chance of remaining scoreless in overtime.  Also,  a team that gets a safety is probably significantly more likely to get another one than random chance.
Watched this again just to see if the Browns 5-0 win last night was scorigami
The browns just beat the eagles 5-0 in preseason
Browns just beat the Eagles (in preseason) 5-0!!!
When some coach is just styling on kids and up 30+ to nothing late, they should go for two and tell the RB to book it all the way to his own endzone to give the other team exactly 1 point.
5-0 SCORAGAMI TONIGHT
Idk if preseason counts but the browns just beat the eagles 5-0, which is a scorigami

Louisiana tech
I love a good defense, so the idea of a 4-4 game with only safeties would be a dream come true. For me, that says two perfect defenses fighting it out.
So, 4-4 or 6-1 which is less likely?
How about we change the rule that it's a touchback if you fumble the ball into the end zone. Let's call it a rouge and unleash more opportunities for scorigami!
College Football Scorigami?
1-0 is possible the college blocked safety could happen on a field goal attempt
Just try to imagine an 8-1 game
"Hey Jon, someone on the CFL subreddit made a CFL scorigami, there's a link here

"@SB Nation +SB NATION
""or Tyer"" ? i know someone with the family name Tyer ... now for real tho, what did Tyer mean on the chart?"
How does this not have millions of views?!
13:28 They should've kicked Chris Gardiocki in the balls
BRING BACK CHART PARTY!!!!!
Has there been an updated scoregami chart uploaded anywhere?
They should update this video with the scoragami of the past two years
"The 6 to 1 score reminds me of Leon Lett and Don Beebe. Obviously it is super unlikely, but to say that it could only be drawn, but couldn't happen, would also have to say that Leon Lett could not possibly have been chased down and stripped by Beebe. At that point it would only require an unusual bounce, which is common place.
I remember that ""Fail Mary"" game on Monday Night Football a few years back too. The Packers refused to come out and line up for the extra point after that bad call, and if they had not sent anyone out there on that play, would they have reversed the score on that game to be a 2-0 win for the Seahawks, or would they decide that the score already dictated a Seahawk win and wouldn't need to be changed? You mentioned that rule, and I was wondering if it has a clause for if the team decides not to play after Half time or something."
There was 6-4 game in college in 2004. Iowa 6 Penn State 4. Look it up.  No wait, do yourself a favor and dont look it up.  Worst offensive game ever!
Obviously this gets vastly easier with high school and college games.  A friend of mine from a Missouri high school ran back a blocked extra point to score one point.  So 6-1 was possible under their rules.
I'm sure this has been said but when Jon describes the 6-1 game, I always imagine a Leon Lett type situation. doesn't seem that impossible for someone to get cocky & not hear footsteps behind them.
imagine... that BOTH teams get the 1 point-defensive safety in the same game, and the game score was 7-7. a very common score that was achieved by accomplishing the practically impossible, twice
What are the songs in the beginning and end
A masterpiece!!! The only good YouTube video
This was so much more interesting than it had any right to be.
Actually you are wrong on a 1-0 score. Theres one way it could happen, during a field goal, the defence can grab the ball before its kicked and get a 1 point safety if downed trying to loop around back in their endzone
You forgot the drop kick which I think is 2 points.
Football is for air heads
If a play like the Louisiana Tech 3rd and 95 can happen, the 1 pt safety could happen
The dark scorigami music makes me uneasy
I donâ€™t even watch football. And Iâ€™m like woah haha
Anyone over the age of 60 want to fill me in???
10-1 would be more rare
This is what religion used to do for people.
Make an update to this
The NFL needs to adopt a rule from rugby to help cut down on scoring.  First, have a second set of hashmarks five yards either side of the regular ones.  Second, wherever a touchdown is scored, that's where you have to kick the PAT.  If you score up the sideline, the kicker gets a very sharp angle, which means more misses.  Or, players try to enter the end zone on the middle of the field and risk being tackled or fumbling the ball.  The same goes for field goals, they have to kick from a wider angle.
9:12 thatâ€™s happened before
This guys videos are legendary
What about a 1 point safety you crackheads
This is a great video very interesting
Chart Party is so creepy but itâ€™s so interesting.
2:12 I feel like Jon placed that 4000-3000 X mark exactly to scale.  I seems like something he would do.
What is more unlikely of a final score? 6-1 or 4-4?
fantastic video, fantastic animation.
Love the video but you should have made it a heat map.
can someone explain the college 1 pointer? I didn't understand what that was about.
don't worry Jon Boi I'll continue scorigami for you
Do a chart party about how shitty of a franchise the bucs have been, could call the video the 'Bad luck Bucs'
1 Point safety?
music is on point. what is it?
"A 1-1 1-2 1-3 and so on are possible through the dropkick it is a when the quarterback drops the ball on the ground and kicks it either after it bounces or while it is on the ground through the uprights and it counts as 1 point 

The last dropkick was made by Doug Flutie on January 1,2006"
Are you keeping this chart up to date somewhere?
I live in AL and there was one game a couple years ago between Spain Park and Austin that ended 5-3
This is SPORTS AMAZING
SB Nationâ€™s VSauce
"There is a chap here in Australia who does a similar thing with the final scores of games in the Australian Football League - an example of his work can be seen here:

https://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Micro%2BNoises%2B195%253A%2BBring%2Bback%2Bthe%2B90s%2521/2912"
The most unlikely score I can imagine is 10-1. It's just like the 6-1, but the team that scores a touchdown also needs 2 safeties.
I think the 6-1 could happen if a defender celebreated early and then the ball went through the back of the endzone on an interception or fieldgoal block
OK scoragami is probably my new favourite stats thing. We need to find more sports with weird point increments and do somethin similar to those sports.
cant forget the college football 98 yard safety
Pretty sloppy statistical analysis, but I still love it.
The Os were up 3-0 that game
Brilliant. Magnificent.  And brilliant.
What about the 1 point drop kick?
A score of 1-0 is possible in the CFL (Canadian Football League).

This i like my 10th thing of yours that i've watched and it is awesome...I don't think anyone else I know would enjoy this...except my 4 year old because for now he likes whatever I like, o i'm kinda in my own echo chamber here.  Anyway, good job and thank you.
"Wait... other than 6-1, why isn't the entire 1 row blacked out? You can't get a score of 21-1, can you?

edit: not sure why I felt that this video required a third re-watch, but here I am."
Seahawks still should have ran the ball
@7:13 bad memories ... we were up in the 3rd inning too. 3-0.
What is the most common NFL score?
Hey, there was a college play that led to something like 3rd and 93 from scrimmage. Granted, it wasnâ€™t on a PAT, but I still hold out hope for the one-point safety.
i want to see a 6-1 now... just for the highlight reel... just for the refs standing on the field confused and staggered, except for one, hes the one who watched the sb nation video on this, he gets excited and starts celebrating before he calls the 6-1 scoreline
The Rouge Rule seems like a good idea, WAAAY too many touchbacks these days, so what the NFL should do is move the kicking team back another 5-10 yards and if the receiving team fails to advance the ball out of the endzone or the ball lands in the endzone without going out of bounds it results in one point for the kicking team. It would stop a lot of the useless special teams appearances these days during kickoff and make the game a bit more exciting.
4:45 Our Solar System makes a complete orbit on the Milky Way galaxy about once every 230 million years or so. So that means we would make about 7.3 trips around the galaxy before that 4-4 game ever happens.
That transition at 1:00  lol
you made this seem like an old legend
"Honorable mention: 5-0 scorigami in the playoffs.  Dallas beats the Lions.  I forget when -- the 80's?  The Lions are in the playoffs so infrequently (and they've won only one playoff game since, oh, I don't know, 1958?), that this deserves some kind of honorable mention.
And actually, I don't know whether it was the first time that score happened, what with all the weird low scores early on.  But it's probably the LAST time that score has ever happened.  (A reverse scorigami?  Or a imagirocs?)"
That 1922 season looks awesome to me. Go defense... which is why I sometimes find it hard to watch
"I think a 6-point play is possible (might've been done)

3 pointer
and 1
misses, catches own rebound, another 3 pointer"
Did you make this in prezi?
4-0 is the best possible football score.
Can someone link me this music ??
Can someone explain the "5 point play" he has listed for basketball?
I thought I was going to hate this video....the core concept / first minute was just confusing to me.  I had to restart it twice but I really like what you did.  Lots of hard work obviously went into this.  Great job.
10-1 is the scorigami holy grail
7:02 Basketball 5 point shot???
The most likely way to hit 6-1 is either a coach or player deciding to do it on purpose. Snap the PAT and run straight back through the endzone.
The oddest score I ever saw was in 1970 when the Dallas Cowboys beat the Detroit Lions in a playoff game, 5-0 !!!!!!!!!!!
What about an extra point conversion when the defence takes the ball, and then goes down the field and drop kicks it for 1 point?
Music?
God my homework is gonna be late but this is so much superior
What about the 1 point safety?
Rugby union is interesting, too: in the modern game, scores of 1, 2, and 4 are impossible since scores only come in groups of three (penalty/drop kick), five (try without conversion), and seven (try with conversion). However, scorigami is harder to come by since conversions can be a LOT harder than extra points in American football, meaning otherwise â€œunusualâ€ scores are not only possible, but common.
Oh it can be done. Ray Claybon on his way to the first New England Patriots' kick off return for a touchdown spiked the ball on the five yard line. Oh it can be done.
We need a yearly update on this chart to see its progression through the years
"0:45

Can someone tell me or send me a link to what this song is called?"
A 1 point safety is possible but has only has happened
That 6-1 type play sort of almost happened in a college football game in the 2017 season
There is a 1 point safety. Look it up.
It's Jim harguagh dammit
What is that song at the beginning? I love it!
You can't have 0-0 because there would be an infinite over time?
I think 10-1 is the score we should all aspire to
I dunno what it is. Iâ€™ve never been the biggest football fan, but stuff like this makes me endlessly fascinated with the game. Good on you, Jon. May the scoragamis be plentiful.
Iâ€™m a simple man. I hear Jon Bois I click like.
I've heard the reason a forfeit us 2-0 is BECAUSE a safety is the only score not attributed to any one player, but rather, a team.
is there a current scoragami chart i can download? I have to do this now
I was at a high school game where a team went for the 2 point and fumbled and the defense got it to the opposite end zone, if the ball had been fumbled again it could have been amazing.
This deserves more views
Steelers vs Ravens 39-38 this past year
That "search YT using 'img ####'" is the best thing ever! With one number combination alone, I found videos of a beautiful dark brown horse in a deep green meadow, absolutely the cutest cream-colored kitten in the world, and an iso of someone opening a can of Chicken of the Sea tuna, all only seconds long. To maintain their highly pristine condition and keep these videos "wild", I did not like or unlike them, nor leave a comment. Amazing bits of digital ephemera.
I knew the Seahawks would be king at this
instead of being winner and loser for the two edges of the board, couldn't you extend the board by making it home and away? nearly doubles the board
You should do this with the CFL scores!
There was a scoragami in 2017 when the Texans beat the Titans 57-14.
Liking just because of the tip at the end

"That was sad.



Letâ€™s keep it sad."
Your videos are always interesting. However, you very often make quite harsh judgments about sports fans of the past. It comes across as if you expect fans 100 years ago would have had the same sensibilities as modern people. This attitude in turn seems to make you take some things out of context. Sometimes you sound like a modern person making fun of cavemen for not driving cars. On top of that, it's all based on numbers and data crunching, which to me feels soulless. It's all very interesting though.
whats the song in the beginning?
I can't believe I actually watched this whole thing
Your probability calculation for the 4-4 game assumes all the events are completely independent, but that is probably not the case.  A team that scores a safety is probably much more likely than average to score another - perhaps the quarterback is sick or a guard is injured or a defensive coordinator as found a way to predict the play.  Still very unlikely though.
I'd LOVE to see scoragami for women's football! PAT's are a crapshoot, and the talent disparity can be VAST!
I did the IMG 4 numbers thing and I found a red haired girl in a church on a piano playing under the sea from disney's the little mermaid
Would a 6-1 game not be possible by the much more likely situation where team A scored a touchdown, then their PAT is blocked, taken back for one point?
I was made extremely uncomfortable by img 5148
What about that Doug Flutie dropkick ? That was 4 points wasn't it ?
Please like this comment comments that comment here are for the new 2018 nfl season scorigami
10-1 is mathematically impossible too, and others
More like this
Im so happy to have watched this. Im sure if you scorigami Division 1A Football you would fill out the whole chart
Long live Scoreagami!
A 4-4 tie can be 2-2 or 0-0 score at the end of regulation, and then both teams can can score 1 or 2 safeties in overtime to make a 4-4 tie.
As long as you could get 6-1 couldnâ€™t you get 8-1 9-1 11-1 so on 10-1  if the rule is what he said it was
Nice vid ðŸ˜ðŸ‘Œ
Is the one point safety only in college?
1-0 is possible, but it's basically impossible
Now do it as percentages.  For example, if you score 0 points, you win 0% of the time, but if you score, 73 points, you win 100% of the time.  Ignoring ties of course.
You are talented!
Damn you little white boxes! Your lack of productivity has resulted in no one ever winning a squares pool with your numbers.
That 1 point on special teams was made in me on Madden once...
"Who are these people that go to 0 - 0 games in the pouring rain??" Ahem. Soccer fans.
Part 2 plzzzzz
can anyone do me a favor and let me know what software he used to make the animation? A lot of the 3D effect and transition looks really cool
What about 8-1
how is 7-1 possible? for one team to score just one point doesn't it require that the other team fail to convert the PAT?
Anyone know the name of the song he uses in the intro? That soft jazz track
"9:56

i hope you choke"
Unfortunately, the 41-33 super bowl was not scoragami. In 1954, there was another 41-33 game which the eagles won. The scariest part, the Browns were the 1954 champions later that year
I wonder if Super Bowl 52 was added to scoragami
There's been no 11-9 score dammit
that one point safety play has the smell of cleveland all over it
What if a field goal gets blocked into the teams whoâ€™s kickingâ€™s field goal. I know itâ€™s ridiculous but it is possible so what would be ruled?
So the only time we will get 6-1 is when a play like Louisiana Tech happens on a 2 point conversion
If you kick a fieldgoal in overtime. The other team turns the ball over. In the same play the losing team is able to score a safety. Who wins?
4 to 4.  So you're saying there is a chance.
The reason forfeits are two points is because when a team surrenders the other team is given a saftey because its the only score that isnt awarded to an specific player(s)
Wtf is the Washington NFL Team? That's really what they were called?
The rouge is the greatest rule in football!
My kink is using it to create pathetically regular scores. Missed extra point and two safeties vs 3 fg and 2pt con td. 10-17.
I heard that the NFL is thinking of changing the safety to account for 4 points instead of 2 since they're so rare
I did a defensive 2pt conversion in madden twice in a row
4 point field goal
Iâ€™m not a super huge football fan. But damn was this interesting. This makes me want to go watch some games of teams that I donâ€™t even like
single point scores are possible thanks to the dropkick. Flutie attempted the last one
ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
Wonder if this guy ever things â€¦ so?
Please please please update this every season!
a 1 point safety is possible, has happened in college, i don't know if it's in the NFL rule book
The best way for the 6-1 final score to happen is if a team scores a touchdown and then fumbles the 2 point conversion and the ball is picked up by the defense and taken all the way except the guy slows up at the end, and gets tackled and fumbles the ball with the kicking team recovering in the end zone for a 1 point safety
49ers jags 44-33 was the first time that score ever happened
So there was a game in 2017 between my outrageously ignored team, the Texans, and the outrageously overhyped Titans. The score was 57-14, which is a scorigami. This game is what the future will be for BOTH my Texans (with Deshaun Watson) and the Titans starting in 2018!!!
wouldn't 8-1 be more rare than 6-1
1 point is possible if a safety happens on the pat
10-1 I think is the most unlikely score, considering you need the extra point safety for 6-1, AND two safeties on top of that for the next 4 points
A 44-33 score from the Jags 49ers in 2017! Scorigami!
There was a Bucs-Lions game that was tied at 11 at the half in 2000 I believe. I remember that was the only time that happened.
Ever since I watched this for the first time, Scorigami is the only thing I care about
A 1 point game is possible
I feel like one day in the future, the 1 point safety will actually happen, but the team will pair it with other scores so it just looks like a normal score and doesn't achieve Scorigami, and Jon will just implode
This graph is unnecessarily complicated
NFC championship game stl 11 tb 6
Answer: Cleveland Browns.
a forfeit end in 2-0 because a safety is the only score that can be attributed to no specific player
Whatâ€™s the first song
4:44 Imagine how tragic it would be if a 4-4 game went to overtime, and we think we'll see our second-ever 4-point score...only for the teams to go FG, FG, FG and finish with a perfectly mundane 10-7.  Or the first team with the ball gets a touchdown, resulting in another final of...10-4.  I think I'd cry.
49ers Beat the Jaguars 44-33 Iâ€™m pretty sure and thatâ€™s new
Fantastic!!
I think the methodology used for the odds of a 4-4 tie is somewhat flawed. Instead of using the overall odds of a team taking a safety in a game, you shouldâ€™ve used the odds of a team taking a safety in a game in which theyâ€™re shut out on offense. A 4-4 tie would obviously mean that neither team scored any offensive points. That implies really bad offenses and high-quality defenses, which would seem to raise the probability of the teams taking safeties.
In the cfl you can win 1-9
Didn't realize the statistics behind the sport.
49ers jags finished 44-33 which is scoragami
10-1 would be the ultimate Scorigami. Two safeties, a touchdown, and a safety off the point after somehow, someway.
7 to 1 is possible isn't it, 7 from td with pat and 1 from 3 fg with a safety.
"15:40 ""Harbaugh was a noted Scorigami artist""

Literally 2 minutes before: ""Nobody tries to achieve Scorigami because it's a term I just made up in the making of this video"""
This is stupid.  You can get five points because Safety = 2 Points and Field Goal Attempt = 3.

We had a 44-33 scorigami yesterday! Merry Christmas!
Drop kick for 1 point?
"I can't believe I just witnessed one on my Christmas Eve, with Jaguars @ Niners ending up 33-44. Earlier in the season, I speculated on that comment section that a match like JAX-HOU could give us one, as they were the kind of atypical teams that could do it, but it ended up being with the Niners instead xD.

EDIT: Well, I just stumbled on the SBNation article about that Scorigami, and I saw that this one is the 8th of the season so I should cool off a little bit, that's not something that happens as rarely as I thought."

Jon's collection of discordant piano music has inspired me to amass such a collection.
It took me until like sixteen minutes in to realize that a scorigami was just a score that hadn't happened before. that made everything a lot simpler.
This is great work. Thank you for all of your considerable efforts on these videos.
Is there a way to add the dimension of commonality to these scores?
your suggestion did not disappoint. Img 5239 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7IQ1tElb5s
Wow just, wow
Did the Ravens & The Steelers make a scoragami last Sunday? Score was 39-38
1 point safeties exist
The Browns ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
There have been six scorigami this year (2017) as of week 14
Scoragami update?
"Here is a mathematical proof that the only impossible number of points a team can achieve is 1 (obviously ruling out that 1 point defensive safety):
Take any number n and divide by 7 to get a remainder of r, that is n=7m+r where m is an integer (which can be zero) and r is a number in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, there are thus seven cases to consider:
r=0) if n=7m then scoring m touchdowns gives you a score of n.
r=2) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and a safety give you a score of n.
r=3) if n=7m+3 then m touchdowns and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=4) if n=7m+4 then m touchdowns and two safeties give you a score of n.
r=5) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns, a safety and a field goal give you a score of n.
r=6) if n=7m+2 then m touchdowns and two field goals give you a score of n.
The tricky case is r=1. We must divide into two ""subcases"":
  n>+7) if n is greater than or equal to 7, then m must be greater than or equal to 1 (otherwise m=0 so that n=r=1<7 which is NOT the case). Thus n=7(m-1)+7+1=7(m-1)+8 so that (m-1) touchdowns and another touchdown with a 2-point conversion gives you the required score of n.
  n<7) if n is strictly less than 7, then m must be zero (otherwise n=7m+r>7 which is not the case), therefore n=7(0)+1=1, the impossible score!
Conclusion: for every number n>1, there is a way to achieve that score in football by conventional means (given sufficient time obviously); the only score that cannot be achieved in an ordinary manner is n=1."
"You can try that IMG trick with any of these extensions:
IMG | MVI | MOV | DSC | HDV"
Iâ€™d be curious to see this for college football
This is retardedly awesome
Why make things difficult by diluting the equation with keeping regulation and overtime scoring separate? Also, "games in which the offense was shut out" is the incorrect variable as it doesn't factor in defensive scoring. In my opinion, the equation for the probability of a game ending in a 4-4 tie should look something like this:  "Odds of a team scoring 2 safeties in a game" x "Odds of a team not scoring any points other than those gained from safeties in any game", then multiply that by itself to get your value for both teams doing it in the same game. All variables should include all regulation and overtime scoring combined rather than splitting it up, it seems much easier that way as it's removing an unnecessary variable and calculation from the equation.
November 19 2017 produced two scorigami. NE 33 Oak 8 & LAC 54 Buf 24.
A single point can be very easily scored in Canadian Football. :D Also baseball and the rest of the world (soccer) disagree about low scoring sports. Finally, I believe the 2 point drop kick is still on the books... so there is that.
If the eagles kicked the extra point, it would've been scorigami.
17:32 that game wasnâ€™t played at the Seahawks stadium
4:45 You can't have a tie in a playoff game man... it would be 256 games rather than 267 because the 11 playoff games can't end in a tie of any score. This is the only part of the video that really bothers me.
"I have to clarify the 6-1 possibility you detailed. It would have been a touchback how you described it. After the defensive team fumbled the interception into the end zone, the recovering player would have needed to attempt to advance the ball or have intentionally retreated into the endzone and then downed/tackled for it to be counted as a safety. Simply fumbling into the end zone and an offensive recovery is not a safety due to the change of possession. 

I'm a stickler for the rules. Especially NFL rules. Thus, I hate Dean Blandino.

Great video though."
So what's the  music used when talking about the Dark scoragami? It's come up in a bunch of videos but I don't know what it is
In the end I thought of Jim Marshall (guy who ran the opposite direction to score an offensive safety for the other team)
But how are the other x - 1 scores possible?? 8-1, 9-1, 13-1 and so on? are they all based on the same 6-1 process?
I'm getting a 1 point safety in Madden, hold my beer
"Why 2-0?

I donâ€™t know."
Anyone know the music that starts at 9:58?
lol pick 2 just a few days after he made this.
A scorigami board should be published and updated every time a new one happens.
In the calculation for a 4-4 game you included playoffs. But playoffs games can't tie. So the it should happen every 1,839,795,140 years.
This guy doesnâ€™t earn enough
0:00 its called the 1 point safety
The defensive 2 pt conversion isn't super rare in college.  It happened to Notre Dame at least twice in 2016.
How many Scoragamis have we had in 2017 so far?
I'm extremely disappointed because he said "8 is a weird number" right at 7:59
Shout out to Jimmy Grapes and the 49ers for putting a slot on 15 (15 - 14 vs Bears)
Fun fact: I got an entirely natural 1-point safety in a game of Madden. I'm assuming it was a glitch. Link to a clip will come if anyone wants it/cares
Is this man using prezi

Scorigami 33 8
2 to 1 is possible
1 point safety?
Can someone tell me the the name of that last song
Woah he said itâ€™s nov 30th and today is November 30th 2017
"Still lots of scorigami left in rugby league. All of the usual scoring methods are even numbers. A try (the equivalent of a touchdown) is 4, or 6 with a conversion, and a penalty goal is 2. A field goal is worth 1, and it's usually only used to break a tie, or to gain a lead of 7 (or 13, etc.)
I remember one game where one guy thought a conversion missed when it was actually good, and kicked a field goal, thinking it was for the win, and his team lost by one, I think 20-19. One-point margins where the winning team scores an even number are super rare. It could also happen by scoring a field goal to take a one point lead, followed by conceding a penalty to lose by one, but it hardly ever happens."
"I think that the best bet for a 1 point safety would be this:

1 point kick is blocked. Defense scoops and up and runs 97.9 yards. Offense is fast on their tail. To make it in they have to dive. They fumble on the dive before crossing the goal. The ball squirts out the back of the end zone. 

Boom. Defensive safety."
That 40-39 score is the most stereotypically Browns thing I've ever heard.
I only watch your videos for the background music
Grandparental permission XD!!!
Isn't a forfeit scored 1-0?
There can be a 6-1 game easily in Canadian football because the rouge rule which means a touchback and a missed field goal that goes through the end zone is 1 point.
Strangely enough a long time ago playing in the yard with friends and  we somehow had a 1 point safety on a long scramble gone wrong resulting in a 20-33 score.
They should have said what the chance of a 6-1 score is
1 point safety
I think a lineman catches the kick and laterals it to a speedy guy and there 1 point touchdown
What about a 1 point safety
That IMG #### thing actually works! I randomly vote this random fact of the day
Would the 6-1 game be possible if a punter punted the ball backwards into his own end zone and that team falls on it?
This is honestly one of the best YouTube videos I've ever watched
Thereâ€™s actually a 1 point safety itâ€™s during an extra point and has only happened three times
Fun fact: if you block a PAT and take it all the way, you get 2 points. What happens if you fumble the ball, the other team dives on it in the end zone, and you down him. Is that another case of the 1-pt safety?
I wish I could give more than 1 thumbs up.
1 point safeties only exist in minor leagues
19:05 yes. Yes it can. Player A doesn't stop running, and Player B gets cocky. They celebrate. Player A strips the ball away. Somehow, the ball bounces in a way that keeps it in the end zone. Player A jumps on it, and Player B downs him in the end zone. There's also Player B mishandling the ball, Player A maintaining possession and somehow losing it out of bounds, and the 2008 Detroit Lions :)
There are 1 point plays though they are rare

*Forgets about 2 point conversions
About the potential 6-1 score, I feel that a fumble recovered in the end zone would be counted as a touchback rather than a safety, so you would have to recover at the 1 yard line and then be tackeled into the end zone.
I love the way football has its scores.  It makes the game very interesting!

the img i searched up"
"1:07

Looks like bowling scores"
I had to turn away after 8:45 (as per Jon's request) what did I miss
That damn Bears vs steelers game I thought I was gonna see a 1 point safety
Team A scores a touchdown, gives up a 1-pt safety. Then team B does the same. It's 7-7. I think that's the worst thing that could ever happen in a football game.
Steelers and bears almost did get the 1 point conversion
If Mississippi St. vs Louisiana Tech proved anything with that 80 yard fumble, it's that the 1 point safety could be possible!!!
There needs to be a website thatâ€™s constantly updated
you could also catch an extra point and return it lol
Hey Jon, in your example at the beginning of a 14-14 tie you drew the vertical line crooked and put the X in the wrong place
theres actually something called a 1 point safety
Actually, 6-1 can also happen if the defending team on a PAT attempt scores a dropkick goal. Since there hasn't been a dropkick-attempt in the NFL pretty much since the dawn of time, Idk if its more likely than a offensive safety, but hey, double the options right?
"No 9-9 games,  interesting. 

And no 46-0 or 50-0. USC beat UCLA 50-0 in 2011, and beat Colorado 50-6 in 2012."
There was a college game this year where the players kept kicking the ball from one goal line to the other and it ended up as like a 3rd and 92. If that happened on an extra point it would be 1 pt
I bet Iâ€™ve reached almost all of these on madden because I always go for 2 but rarely make it ðŸ˜‚
wait... how can basketball make 5pt play?
Here let me help you out with this scorigami thing: watch high school football
â€œWashington NFL Teamâ€
REDSKINS! THE TEAM IS CALLED THE REDSKINS!
9:00 He's using 7 point bars instead of 6 point bars.
Why can't a game end 7-1? https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/sports/football/a-1-point-score-in-the-nfl-now-its-possible.html?referer=http://www.google.ca/
Jon Bois Spotify playlist
If someone pulls a fumble like the Miss St vs La Tech one that happened this year on an extra point, 6-1 might happen
Hi
The Chicago Bears fans that enjoyed the scoreless ties must have been soccer fans.
No wonder why sentient space crafts like football.... This crap is crazy.
"Isn't 10-1 a harder score?
That would require that 6-1 bullshit
Plus
2 safeties"
Your 6-1 example isn't even correct. That would just be a touchback. Team A would have to recover that fumble, run it out of their own end zone, and then run back in their end zone and be tackled. I am disappointed you got it wrong after all of that waiting you made us do. Sad stuff.
Awesome video :)
Madden is about to get broken ðŸ˜ˆ
there is a loophole to win a game with less points then the other team
6:28 *Washington Redskins
You forgot all about the 1 point safety
ever heard of the drop kick? look it up. doug flutie 2007
1 to 0 can happen because of a one point safety
"I just looked into this, and I found that Belichick is also 7-0 in Scorigami with the Patriots (yes, I know Carroll is 8-0 now), but according to Pro Football Reference, Belichick has won these 7:

2004 vs. Rams (40-22)
2004 vs. Browns (42-15)
2012 vs. Colts (59-24)
2012 vs. Jets (49-19)
2013 vs. Steelers (55-31)
2014 vs. Colts (43-22) (playoffs)
2016 vs. Bills (41-25)"
Who else remembers Rams vs. Bucs in the 99 playoffs? 6 to 5 at the half. Ended 11 to 6.
I think 8-1 would be far less like ly
The 1 point safety nearly happened in the Steelers Bears game just a few weeks ago.  Blocked extra point, run back for almost touchdown, Marcus Cooper had it punched out and into his own endzone.  Very nearly happened.
How about college football?
"We're not quite at the halfway point of the 2017 season, but we've already matched last season's total of five Scorigami games.

Week 1: Rams 46, Colts 9
Week 3: Rams 41, 49ers 39
Week 4: Texans 57, Titans 14
Week 4: Seahawks 46, Colts 18
Week 6: Saints 52, Lions 38

Some takeaways from these games:
â€¢ In all five games, the winning team scored more than 40 points. By comparison, the league-wide scoring average is just shy of 22 PPG.
â€¢ The Rams and Colts have already been involved in two of these games. LA won both, while Indianapolis lost both â€” allowing exactly 46 points in each.
â€¢ By recording only the seventh 57-point score in NFL history, the Texans broke their single-game scoring record by double digits in their Scorigami. Houston's previous high was achieved in Week 13 of the 2014 season, in a 45-21 victory against... the Titans.
â€¢ Pete Carroll continues his statistically-unlikely sorcery (scorecery?), notching his eighth consecutive season with a Scorigami win. At this point he has to be doing it intentionally."
The reason why a forfeit is 2-0 is because the safety is the only way of scoring points that isn't attributed to a single player.
Why can't 7-1 happen?
Fun video! Have you considered that some of these events may not be independent? For example, in the 4-4 situation, a low scoring offense and opposing safeties have an association with another, so multiplying those probabilities may not accurately estimate the overall probability of the event occurring?
I can't watch an NFL game anymore without thinking of this video.
We need more vidsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
18-9 in minnesota right now
To add to the unlikelihood of a 6-1 game, why on earth would a team go for 2 if they're 6-0 up?
Texans titans game a few weeks wad scorigami. 57-14

That img tip sent me for one of my longest youtube benders ever. RIP my grade on the test I should have been studying for
"a 1 point safety is possible in the rulebook. I have only watched 5 minutes of the video, so you might talk about this but idk :P
Edit: Yep, talked about it"
41 to 40 will break everything.
I cant believe I watched this whole thing
"17:14

There have been safety(s) before the first play from scrimmage. Like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY7E8ES9ubM&t=6m31s"

Pete Carroll delivers again.
Pete Carroll is at it again with 46-18
This has happend to the bears they blocked a kick then ran it back but Pittsburgh made them fumble and got tackled in the endzone
I think we have a new scoragami 57-14
NFL noob here - what was the flag for at 17:16 (the missed snap?)
My high school once played a 3-2 game. Pouring rain, field became south Florida muck, no passing and barely any rushing.  Sad to watch, and of course we lost.

Scorigami in Houston Sunday: Texans 57-14 over Titans
Would 10-1 be the toughest scoragami? A 6-1 game with two additional safeties.
I think there were three scorigamis this week. 57-14 Texans. 18-15 Cardinals. 46-18 Seahawks.
He should make a new one for this season
This just in the Texans beat the Titans 54-17 adding another game to this chart

Double dose of scoragami this week......no one told Deshaun Watson that you're not supposed to score the same way he did in college HOU-57 TEN-14.Â  And coach Carroll got another on SNF SEA-46 IND-18
About the only interesting thing about the 2nd half of tonight's Colts-Seahawks game: "Okay Seattle, you gotta score a touchdown, not a field goal here, 'cause 42-18 has happened before." First 46-18 score confirmed!!!! Pete Carroll, you've done it again.
SCORIGAMI RED ALERT:currently Colts 18 Seahawks 25 in late 3rd quarter
The defensive 1 point safety can also happen if the team going for the conversion turns around and runs all the way to the back of the other inzone, you can see for yourself in Madden

Steelers vs Bears game on Sept 24th, 2017 almost did that. Cooper blocked the kick, returned it to just outside the goal line, then the Steeler knocked it out of his hands and came damn close to falling on it in the endzone. Ended up knocking it out kind of. Weird play in an of itself which took far to long. Long and short of it is that the Bears got it on their 2 yard line. Not a 6-1 score mind you, but a 1 point safety could have happened.
This may be the best video on YouTube
Time to move the PAT spot to in line with where the TD was scored, like in rugby?
Although the 6-1 score is nearly impossible, a similar event compared to the explanation of scoring just one point happened between Mississippi state and Louisiana Tech on September 9, 2017. LT was 2nd and goal from the opponents 6 yard line, and the ball got snapped over the head of the quarterback. MS players kept trying to pick the ball up, and ended up pushing the ball backwards even further until a LT player fell on the ball at their own 7 yard line. LT was 3rd and goal, 3rd and 93, from their own 7 yard line. They lost 86 yards on one play. So although it would be hard to score just one point for a team, the event just described shows that it is possible.
This is the best sports vid on YouTube highly underrated
"14:35 the one chance for the browns to win- they blew it 
Sounds like something the bills would do ðŸ˜°"
You can get 1 point off of a one point safety right
Rams made history. The first team to ever get 2 scorigamis in 3 games
"I stopped the video when the chart at 6:26 referred to ""Washington NFL team"".

Lame."
This sounds like an 80's movie to me. Especially the end. I love this content.
It just happened again! For the first time in over a year!!!
Interesting fact: no team has ever scored 50 points and not won
Scorigami this weekend! 41-39!
Craziest scoragami I've ever seen was in a college football game that ended 6-4. Penn State v Iowa 2004.
18:23 - It wasn't a safety and it was on a field goal instead of a point-after, but the Bears today basically did the closest thing we've ever seen to what you described here.
Guys there has been 2 scorigamis this year, week 1 rams beat Colts 46-9, week 3 rams beat 49ers 41-39
Aaaaaaay Rams 49ers scoragami 41-39
https://instagram.com/p/BZVGQJbl5N_/ Add this to the chart
You can cross 41-39 off now
Is there an updated version of this chart somewhere so we can play along?
41-39 SCORIGAMI!
17:33 Need an update 41-39
There was that LSU game where they were 3rd and goal from their own 7. Something like that could definitely happen on a 2 pt attempt.
I would love an update video.
Happened last night. 49ers and Rams scored 41-39, a new score thatâ€™s never happened.
Why doesn't he count the APFA the first version of the NFL 1920 -1921 because 66-0 has happened why ??????????
A 6-1 score is possible but the example of the safety following the conversion return is not correct. If Team A fumbles the ball into the end zone and Team B recovers in the end zone, it's a touchback, not a safety. In order for a safety to be scored, the actions of Team B would have to cause the ball to go into the end zone. This could happen either by the person who recovered it running into the end zone or by a player from Team B batting it into the end zone during a recovery attempt.

I LOVE JON BOIS.  Im in love with jon bois?  videos are dope.
Could you do this Kind of Video about Rugby Union?
Seahawks did one in their 14-5 loss last season.
I did some rexearch in Finland, and a finnish maple league (top level) game has ended once with one team scoring four points.
I would like to see the chart with a third height dimension to show frequency. Somebody make it happen.
That last example wouldn't even be a safety. The A player would need to advance the ball back out of the end zone, then either run back in or fumble it back into his defensive end zone, where it would have to either go out the back or side of the end zone or be recovered in the end zone by team A
I remember watching the first ever 11-10 game I think it was Chargers vs Steelers
I was more impressed with your graphics than the information itself.
Mind blown... also go hawks
The fact that Marshawn Lynch caused an earthquake...
Except the drop kick exists so it is possible to score one point
I hate these so much. Not Because they are bad, or because of the creator, but because there are so few! The way you put these Chart partys and Pretty Goods together always has be super excited to watch.
This honestly blew my mind
I love your content, but honestly the music...ugh. haha. Might be better without music my friend.
"I've created a twitter feed that tracks in real time the chances that an NFL Game will result in Scorigami.  You can find it here: 
https://twitter.com/nfl_scorigami"
We need updates every season on whether there were any scorigamis. I know that this year, there was a 46-9 scorigami in week 1 and a 30-2 in the preseason, though that does not count.
I love how there was a game-winning defensive two-point conversion return just a few days after he made this video. It's perfect.
I actually like low scoring games because I prefer defensive battles, tough thing about that is being a Packer fan
Not aware of the "new" conversion rules?
Eric berry got a defensive 2 point conversion in 2016 against the falcons
1 point safety's
I'm sure there are lots of lower level scorigami scores, but maybe this is rare; I played in an 18-4 game. They scored 3 TDs, attempted 2 point conversions on each, the same player on our team intercepted & ran back 2 of them. (Game played on a 70 yard field on a hill. Not high quality. Match report; http://sabres.union.shef.ac.uk/club/history/0506-season/ )
"That was sad now let's keep it sad"-john bois ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Last week, Louisiana Tech came just seven yards away from the sequence of events required to give up a 1-point safety (although this occurred during regular play and not on a conversion attempt).
Would 12 to 74 be scoragami? #Maddenlogic
Extra point intercepted
This guy must have been really really really really really bored
SB Nation what software did you use to make the graphics?? It looks great! Also, nice vid btw!
Lol I went 98 yards the other way for a safety on madden one time that's how I knew the rule
15:09 technically they are combinations but awesome video though. I never knew I wanted anything as much as a 6-1 score.
The six to one could happen though...look up Louisiana Tech' 3rd and 93
Someone make 6-1 happen on madden and upload!
In singing high school they blocked a 1 pat and they returned it best moment ever
1-0 is absolutely possible, you get 1 point for a "Drop Kick", Doug Flutie Pulled it off in 2006 for New England as the extra point after a touchdown but this can be done outside of extra points.Â  Nobody in their right mind would do this instead of a field goal but it is possible.
"Though the probability of a team scoring exactly one point in a game is astronomically remote, it must be noted that in today's NFL, with the extra point located at the 15-yard line instead of the 2-yard line, the kicking team would have to lose 85 yards on an extra point attempt for the 1-point safety to register as a score for the other team. While ""Scorigami"" correctly proclaims the play to be nearly impossible, it is not entirely inconceivable. 

Despite the extremely low probability of a team losing 85 yards on a play, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Louisiana Tech lost 87 yards on a single play against Mississippi State this year (2017). The play did not result in a safety, but it certainly could have if the line of scrimmage was further back than where it was (the Mississippi State 6-yard line; 2nd and goal). The ball was recovered by the Louisiana Tech offense at their own 7-yard line. Remember that the line of scrimmage on an NFL extra point is nine yards further back than it was for the aforementioned play. If an NFL team were to lose 87 yards on an extra point attempt, they would have to recover the fumble two yards into their own end zone.

Further, the chances of losing 87 yards on a field goal (or extra point play) is more likely than losing that much yardage on an offensive play with the quarterback in the shotgun. When the Arizona Cardinals gave up a touchdown to the Buffalo Bills last year (2016), the snap traveled 26 yards behind the line of scrimmage before it was touched. This is more than the 21 yards lost by Louisiana Tech before the ball was touched, only increasing the likelihood of the defensive 1-point safety.

In conclusion, the one-point safety is not at all inconceivable. If a bad snap on an extra point kick attempt, followed by an egregious number of fielding errors strikingly similar to the former play mentioned above were to occur, we just might witness the first defensive 1-point safety in football history. But even if this cosmically rare event were to occur, the 1-point total score by a team could only exist if their opponents were able to hold them scoreless for the remainder of the game."
There's a 1 point safety on field goal attempts that are easier to get, look it up
There is something called a 1 point safety. For a example, If Justin Tucker were to have a kick blocked and Ray Lewis (opposite sides..) catches it. IF Ray were to run out and was tackled back inside the end zone, its a 1 point safety..
What if u block the extra point and take it to the house
1 point is possible
This would make football squares so much easier to bet on knowing which squares have the best chance of happening.
Sloppy probability calculations, but I guess you were just going for 'approximate' answers. But things like 'what is the probability that there are 2 safeties by each team AND each team is shut out offensively' will not just be the product, because those are not independent events.
Super Bowl 24 was Scorigami 49ers 55 Broncos 10
That was awesoem
You can technically score intimate amount of times if the kicking team (on kickoff) recovers the ball and scores it's a touchdown with no time of the clock it happens to the bills in 2016
1-0 is possible.  If a really rare thing happens in college football (yes this is nfl but it can most likely still happen) a 1 point safety will be on the board.
Would 6-1 be possible with a drop kick by recovering team on a conversion attempt after a blocked PAT, fumble, etc.?
Someone needs to try and make a 6-1 game on madden
"Colts vs Rams Week 1 2017
New Scorigami: 46-9"
"You should post the chart on twitter or something so we can see if any current NFL games are new scoragami
EDIT: After looking at week 1 scores, the Rams-Colts game filled the 46-9 scoragami"
For anyone curious, Jon Bois is NOT counting preseason as part of the Scorigami chart. He said this on his Twitter on August 31.
rams 46-9 colts....scorigami
Imagine the blood vessels this guy would pop if a play to make a game 6-1 happens then the losing team kicks a field goal to make it a more common 6-3 game
Pretty close to a scorigami with the 29-19 Vikings vs Saints game. 29-12 (no Drew Brees TD pass in the final few minutes) or 32-12 (Vikings want to get a scorigami, so they kick a field goal at the end of the game instead of taking a knee) would have been scorigami.
does this count preseason?
Colts 9 X 46 Rams in wk1 is a scorigami!
Another hole is filled on the board. 46-9
You're 6-1 game may be easier to obtain than you think. A rule change in the last few years (I'm not sure if it was before or after this video) makes it so that if a PAT is run back by the defense, it only counts as 1 rather than 6.
The 4-4 odds tho
Newest scorigami today (9/10/17): Rams vs. Colts, 46-9!
There are now 1 point safeties in the NFL and NCAA
Just ask Louisiana Tech about losing lots of yardage on long fumbles.
I like your articles Jon, do you still do breaking madden?
Running an extra point kick back for two happened like two or three times last season!
Mind blowing vid ðŸ’¥
4000-3000 is possible the kicking team just has to grab the ball in the end zone for a touchdown over and over again because the clock doesn't stop
The editing is amazing great job!!
You should do literally the highest score possible. So let's say there is a 10-yard kickoff and the other team tries to return it as fast as possible. Let's say  like the fastest kickoff return possible is 8 seconds. Then, if u can go for two in 2 seconds, there would be eight points every 10 seconds. That's 720 points a quarter; 2480 in a game.
Look up, 1 point safety.
Also the fact no one would go for two on their first score when they're up
"Ehhm, what about the one-point safety? 
edit: jumped the gun when he showed the Lego's."
pleaaaase do this with college football. this is such a good video but i'd love to see how crazy the scores get with the massive amount of games
"The whole time I was watching this I wanted to see this chart as a heat map.
So I made one: https://goo.gl/XGuPtF
Red = only happened once
Yellow to green = less frequent to most frequent

Top 5 most frequent scores are wins by 3"
I thought 28-24 was very common
Can I please get a scoragami sheet that I can fill out while playing football like Bingo?
What about the bengals browns 2004 58-48 game or the 2007 bengals browns (again) 51-41 game? Those were very interesting scoragamis. The bengals won both. The browns know how to loose.
why won't he say Washington's full name?
"I don't like it when people praise Pete Carroll.




But that's just because I'm a 49ers fan :)"
if preseason counts Broncos just beat the Cardinals 30-2 so that would be scorigami
Does this include preseason? Idk if he mentioned it.
This is the best video on the internet
I NEED THIS MUSIC
Instead of Winning team-column, Losing team-row, why don't you do Home team-column, Away team-row? Then you have the full board at your disposal instead of just half of the board.

Ends up 21-20"
You can get a  1 point safety  look it up  I think Texas  A&M  did it
When you mentioned NYG vs. WSH was the highest scoring game, what about GB vs ARI?
Amazing  video
The song is Flying Dragon by Dieter Reith in case you don't know.
Isn't 8-1, 9-1 10-1 etc also impossible?
You should sell scoragami boards
A score of 1-0 is possible. Conversion safety
your graphic at 9:20 has a 7 block and a 2 instead of a 6 and a 2
your math is off. the likelihood of scoring a second safety is dependent on how safety prone an opponent is.
Is 6-1 capable in Madden??
football is great
Do you think Ten and Juice ever saw a 4-4 game?
um there is other sports where scorigami could be a thing
The music and editing are off the charts! This is so enjoyable to watch
Why did you call them, "Washing nfl team."
Jon's scenario at the end for the 1-point safety is actually incomplete and the real thing would be even less probable. A safety is only possible if the team has possession of the ball. However, if the defense intercepts the ball on the two point conversion, they would officially have possession. So if the ball was fumbled in the endzone by the defense and recovered by the offense, it would only be a touchback, resulting in no score. In order for the 1-point safety to happen, the defense would have to get possession of the ball (e.g. interception), lose the ball in their endzone (98 yards away), have the offense pick up the ball (thereby regaining possession for the offense), carry the ball OUT of the defense's endzone, and then somehow get tackled back into the defense's endzone. For all intents and purposes, it's basically not possible.
You can score 1 point in the NFL if a field goal is blocked and then recovered in the end zone by the team who blocked it you get a 1 point safety ik crazy right
"""No team has even come close to a 73-0 win...""

2009, week 6. Patriots beat the Titans 59-0.

Probably would've been worse since it was 45-0 at HALFTIME. 45-0 AT HALFTIME!
Pretty damn close if you ask me."
This is just one really long shower thought
Never seen your channel before but this video was incredibly interesting
I'm watching this at night and the rare rules terrified me
wew boi
Now I wanna see a 1-0 game
Great video, learned so much! Thanks! How about 100 likes for no reason
Every work of Jon Bois' I've ever seen has given me a weird surrealist feeling while simultaneously assuring me of my place in the universe.
Note that Team A would also have to bring the ball out of the end zone and then go back in for it to be a safety; otherwise it's just a touchback.
You spelled Redskins wrong.
This was in my recommended, and it was incredibly interesting! Earned yourself a sub my good sir.
There can be a 6-2 game with no safeties!
And I thought I had no life researching NFL history...this is next level, bro.
Welp, a game just happened between the Bucs and Jags then ended with a score of 12-8. Is that scorigami for you?
Another banger
Is the one point safety only a rule in college?
In Seattle there's a good chance in Seattle your eardrum could be ruptured as Seattle fans have gotten so loud they've been just 12 decibels away from rupturing eardrums.
I love how the Dark Scorigami segment was genuinely unsettling to watch. Or maybe it was just because I watched this at midnight with the lights out. I'll give Jon the benefit of the doubt.
What if you had a computer simulate future NFL seasons based on historical probability taken from previous seasons, kinda like how Jon did in this video? Would we get some crazy fractal-esque patterns at the end?
This the best video I've seen on YouTube this year... And I watch a shitload of YouTube.
Wait, isn't a blocked PAT returned worth 1?
Rugby Union scorigami
Except a safety on PAT is a one point play
With the new PAT rules, idk about a 6-1 game, but I think a team scoring 1 point is very possible. We've seen it happen before on INT returns, albeit rarely.
Seahawks!!
i tripped balls this entire video,
I won a 10-1 game of Madden 07 with a friend, so I guess I'm pretty much a scoragami expert
Are there any other videos similar to this one, or about scoragami? I want more lol
i want to see an 11-4 final score before i die
What's a 5 point game in basketball?
The Eagles had a scorigami of 54 to 11 vs The Bears.
I don't even like football but this video is amazing
Please someone make a Scorigami board on Google Docs or whatever, so we can follow it this season!
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball
this should be a tv show
What's wrong with low scoring games? I love defense.
Scoragai as you put it could also work in rugby Because in that you have 2 ways to get 3 points and one way to get 5 and one way to get seven so it doesnt work in order of magnitude like most other sports
Even in 17776, there's probably never been a 4-4 game. lol
why did you put on that annoying noise around 9:30 ? shits horrible
Straight facts
5 zero-zero games?! The NFL used to be FIFA.
There is some cases where there is a 1 point safety so there could be a score with 1 in it
what am I doing with my life why am I not watching these videos
this makes me want to start a game with multiple ways to score different amounts of points, and the goal isn't to score the most points, but to get the closest to a certain number.
What happens in the NFL if a blocked FG is brought back to the EZ and is downed by the defense?
I'm surprised that 4 was in a score before 5!
I got scorigami in Madden 25! It was 25-9. The AI scored a TD with a missed 2-pt conv., and kicked a field goal. I got a two 7-point TDs. a safety, and three field goals. (EDIT: Let me put the scoring in order: Me: 7-point TD AI: FG Me: 7-point TD AI: 6-point TD Me: FG Me: FG Me: Safety Me: FG)
Me and a bud once played Madden with 15:00 minute quarters, I threw like 14 pics, still won the game like 200 to 150. The announcer called the final score as "a bunch to a bunch."
The 6-1 play happened,Texas vs. Texas A&M
8:55 it's 2-0 because no single player gets credit for a safety
How would you get a 5 point play in basketball
Greatest video ever?
There's a 1 point safety
Wouldn't a 6-1 score block also occur if after team A scores a touchdown they kick it through team Bs goal?
All these chat party videos are so good. Very interesting
18:50 Wouldn't that be a touchback and therefore unsuccessful try? For team A to give the impetus to put the ball in its own end zone it has to get the ball in the field of play and carry it into the end zone, or bat or kick the ball into the end zone. If team B fumbles the ball into the end zone, the imputus is on team B.
Under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks have had a scorigami each year, and even better won all seven
This dude is a G.O.A.TðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I wish that Jon made more videos
That was pretty good
Where's the jazz music from?
AYY K-STATE
Jon Bois is a gift to this Earth
Wait am I totally wrong, or can't you make a 6-1 win also by returning a blocked PAT?
Just a reminder to any uppity Seattle fans that KC took the noise record back the next game.
Did the image search with a random number thing... first try, see a turkey fight, seems about right...yeah, let's not do that again.
Jon Bois is a national treasure.
the word scorigami got funnier the more you said it
What's the music at 5:29 please?
Before starting as a Seahawks fan I know SB 48's 43-8 is the only time that score has happened.
One time in the 1970s, the Rams scored two safeties in a game. The same player, Fred Dryer or Drier, made the scoring tackles.
You're stupid! How could you forget the most obvious 6-1 situation of a defensive interception on a PAT attempt, in which the defense decides not to run it into the endzone, but instead do a 1 point drop kick. Maybe watch a football game sometime. You should know that.
Would a 6-1 game also be possible if, on the extra point attempt, the defense runs the ball down the field and drop kicks the ball through the uprights?
That was sad. Let's keep it sad. ðŸ˜‚
do this with the nba
1-0 is possible in the cfl
a forfeit is 2-0 because a safety is the only score not attributes to any player
my favorite SB nation video by far
5:28 I don't understand people who waste their time making a 20 minute video about NFL scoring statistics
This was insanely interesting
What's the creepy music sound from?  Sounds like a Silent Hill scene.
I still love all these videos. And also the fact you can see the mouse move across the window at the very last second.
Look at the rock island independents of pre NFL pro football they only played 4 games in 1908 and had 2 scoragamis till this day, 4-0 and 8-2 Jon I'd love to see you make a scoragami board that includes all pro games from 1890s on
Will there ever be an 8-1 game?
This video deserves my like. Great job!
Hop up, how is the numbers past seven to one possible?
So is 13-1 possible?
Guess this was made before the Bucs beat the Hawks 11-5
Personally, I think your "odds" of a 4-4 game are wrong.  After doing my own seperate calculations, I've determined that the true odds are: once in 471,078,670,372 games, not once in every 470,897,555,931 games.
6-1... challenge accepted
Chart Party! Woot, Woot!
There was a 58 - 0 game john, you didn't mark it on the chart
What did you use to make the chart?
can i print this out?
Two teams in the preseason need to make a 6-1 game
At 5:27 when Jon says "Who are these people?" I decided to look up Lon Warneke and he was a pretty good pitcher in his day! He had a 192-121 W-L record and played in 5 all star games
Why couldn't 6-1 just happen like in the college game?
Canadians what is a rouge in the CFL?
does anyone know what is used to edit this - wanted to use it for a class
5points is impossible in basketball?
THIS HAS TO BE THE DUMBEST ISH LOL
18:14 - For those not familiar with the "rouge" of the Canadian Football League, that's one of the big differences between the leagues; another is that there are no touchbacks in the CFL.Â  If the ball is kicked into the opponents' end zone, it must be returned.Â  If they can't get it out of there, the kicking team gets that single point, or "rouge".
I imagine BB might in a situation where he scored a TD on the final play... he would probably say kneel. or Put the fastest guy there  and tell him run out the back of your own endzone. just because he likes to have fun sometimes.
I like this but at 7:03 there is no 5 point plays in basketball
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do Scoragami for College Football. PLEASE
Why are you afraid of the team name "Redskins"?
This is amaxing
This was the dumbest video I've ever seen
Is your name pronounced "boy" or "bwah" Because of your name sounds like Jon Boy that's awesome ðŸ˜‚
The One Point Safety has happened twice in the history of College Football I believe.
Jon Bois is that you? upload more on your main channel
im too high for this video
No offense but a blocked xp returned for a touchdown is a one point score it has happened
I dont particularly like football but that was insane
This was the most interesting thing i have seen in a while. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"9:08 thats a 7-block you used there

oh so is 9:47"
Damn. One of the best videos I've ever watched
What NFL game occured when the losing team scored 8 points? I wonder.......
this was actually pretty good
But what is the odds of the inventor of scorigami saying "scorigami" more than anyone has ever said "scorigami" before? Hmmm? Is THAT a scorigami?
Where can I find the music that plays in the Chart Party videos?
such a cool video
I have a question about that 1-pointer. If it's fumbled, recovered by the other team while in the endzone, and then he's tackled, why wouldn't that just be the equivalent of a touchback? In other words, in order to give up a point, wouldn't he first have to venture out of the endzone and then step back in and be tackled?
Lol did I really watch this whole thing just to find out how a score of 6-1 is possible...
You also see far more safeties in the CFL.  If a team's set to punt out of their own end zone, chances are they'll just take the safety.  For a variety of reasons (longer field, shorter series,  uprights on the goal line), field position is very important.  It's often worth giving up two points to push the opponent back 20-ish yards.
if you fall on the opposite teams fumble in the end zone it's a touch back
I knew 6-1 Since I did it in Madden
I thought this video was going to show every NFL score that has ever happened...
When was the 11-10 score?
Genius...
can't believe I watched this :)
what did i just watch
"Have to point out two mistakes.
1) Any high score is possible both technically and physically because on a kickoff time doesn't start until someone touches the ball. So if you kick it into your opponents' end zone and recover it there, you score a touchdown without wasting a moment of playing time. And PATs, of course, are untimed.
2) For it to be a safety, you have to carry the ball into the end zone yourself. If your opponent fumbles forward and into the end zone and you just fall on the ball, you are awarded a touchback."

What's the song?
Washington Redskins. Washington Redskins. It's the Washington REDSKINS.
Hey im new to this channel and ive Gotta say, your channel is awesome
can somebody tell me what program was used to create this video with 3d animations and all that? It's like a virtual world
that is one way to get 6-1 but if team A got a touchdown and team a's kicker missed the extra point off the goal post or for whatever reason it was short... a player from team b could catch the ball in the air and run it back to his own endzone resulting in 6-1

Now this is what I call hard work. Congrats, dude.
This seems like something i would do at 2 am
your statistical analysis seems lacking. use conditional probability. for instance, a scoreless overtime is much more likely to occur in a game between two teams with poor offenses than in a game between teams qith average offense. you essentially double count the poor offense. a 4-4 is probably 100 - 1000 times more likely than you state here.
the 1 point play hooked me but the video was good enough to keep me watching regardless.
19:09 isn't that a touchback?
I got a 1 point safety in madden before. So, the dude went for 2 and I intercepted it ran back to like the 2 yard line, fumbled, the other team recovered and I tackled him in the end zone
this video was amazing
this is exactly what I needed to watch to distract myself from my physics homework #procrastination
I'm from Canada and I've won a high school game 2-1
I feel like I am watching a conspiracy theory
Very enjoyable!
what has my life come to
Wasn't there a defensive 2 pt conversion this past season?
Why do I love watching this?
i dont know about exact math, but i think he messed up the math about a 4 to 4 game. he added that the other team has to be shut out, but they arent shutting them out. it should be probability of a 4 point score time 4 point score times scoreless overtime. otherwise cool video

The score can also end 6-1 if the offense goes for 2, the defense somehow gets the ball, and just before the defensive player crosses the goal line they drop kick it through their up right. This is another fairly new rule. (new being added in the 60s i believe)
Blocked extra point offense picks it up in end zone? 6-1
all scores above 11 are possible with only 7 points for a touchdown and 3 points for field goal
so doesn't that mean 13-1 and 20-1 and so forth could be possible?
One of the most interesting Youtube videos ever. Loved it. Thanks :)
music at the end gave it away...scorigami? more like illuminati!!
Go hawks!
This is my favorite video ever
Let's say team A gets a TD, then they go for the field goal. It's blocked, then ends up in the hands of team B, who runs it all the way back. Would that result in 6-1 game??
This has got to be the best football video on the internet
I did the defensive 2 pt conversion on madden mobile but it gave me no points?
Scorigami can also work for rugby but admittedly not as well as football
Wow this is very interesting!
1-Mar
What if a 2pt conversion gets intercepted and instead of running it back into the endzone you kick a fieldgoal..? I mean nobody would do that but is it allowed to kick the pat on the other site?
your videos are so good I love stats and numbers so much xD
Whoa
I've scored 1 point in madden 16
Could the game end 6-1 if on an extra point or two point conversion by team a, team b instead of running it into the end zone kicks a drop kick? Or would that even count?
that 1 point safety soundtrack really spooked me out
Is the one-point safety only in NCAA rules?
I have just wasted almost 22 minutes on convoluted bullcrappage by a guy with a great voice...
This is one of the best youtube videos I have ever seen
scorigami is fantastic! thanks!
This was awesome
i like how he made us wait till the end
Epic video, man. So awesome.
I feel like every time I watch a football game now, I will be wondering if it was a scorigami.
seeing how little amount of 8 pt plays there were makes it all the more impressive that the patriots had 2 back to back in the Super Bowl to win
"""that was sad, let's keep it sad.""

me_irl"
"His likelihood of a 4-4 game is a little off.

Although this would be hard to calculate, in reality, the chance would be lower:
When one team scores a safety, they need to kick it off to the other team.  Usually this kickoff gives good field position for the other team making it even more likely that they would score, and less likely that on that drive they would get a safety.

A reason why it would be more likely to happen than he calculated:
His statistics that he used for how many overtime games end in ties is based off of statistics from before the overtime rule change.  It used to be that the first team that scored won, no matter what.  Now if you score a field goal, the other team has a chance to tie or pull ahead.  This makes it more likely that it will be a tie because a field goal on the first drive doesn't automatically end the game.

There are a few other things that don't make as much of a difference, but are still a factor.  An example of this is that now on kickoffs the ball starts at the 25 yard line on a touchback, not the 20, which makes it harder to get a safety."
Quality
the fact I can't skip ads make me wan a delete YouTube app think I will and find some where else to watch random crap
This is literally one of the most interesting well made different videos. The way the scenes flow and change, the animations, music, creativeness... o give this 10/10 it just impressed me alt
Does vox not give you any money at all? Interesting topic but oddly written and choppy editing made it rough on my stomach. SB deserves better than this.
That was fascinating. Thanks Jon Bois!
the defensive 2pt and 1pt conversions only entered the NFL in 2015 when they moved the PAT back.  But I doubt anyone will ever get a defensive 1 point conversion
the research tho!! the amount of work you put in this video for a 100k sub counts is amazing. i subbed just for the efforts! but the music... WTF
There is more than a 5-point play in basketball, a 17 point play has happened before... Which was also a 5 point play for the other team. http://deadspin.com/5152216/high-school-basketball-team-pulls-off-rare-17-point-play-for-the-win-update
What a well made and superbly edited video
You don't understand people going to watch the 0-0 game? Soccer is pretty popular worldwide! haha!
Boycotting your videos now... Who the hell is this Washington NFL team?...
How long did this video take?
This is incredible.  Great video!!!!
My mind was blown
Surprised 21-14 had never happened
My head hurts
Teach us the arts of scoregami
Of course that happened to the Browns ðŸ˜‚
wtf that was sick
Not sure if it's the voice, the mystery of "scorigami" or the music, but this video has some serious anime vibes to it.
Could they also get that single point by drop kicking an extra point during the conversion try by the defense running it back 98 yards? I fully understand how hard would be, just wondering if that would count.
This is fantastic. Should've talked about Steelers Chargers, 11-10 a few years back. Troy Polamalu returns a desperation lateral by the Chargers back to the house only to have the touchdown called back (even though it was clear that the pass was backwards and the score should've been upheld). The call preserves the scoragmi in the only 11-10 game in history. As a kid, even as a Steelers fan, I remember rooting for them to overturn the call just to witness history! haha
I should be doing a lab right now due in less than two hours..
Next season it's gonna get done now that you said it can't
A 1 to 1 score is possible however. The chances of that happening are absolutely nearly impossible.
Ok, so 1 point is possible in any game where the other team scores a touchdown?  So its not just 6-1 that will keep scorigami going on forever, right?
I loved this video
Good video but Washington has a name. REDSKINS!!! Dont be afraid to say it proudly.
Great vid. However, on 6:37 you crossed off the Buffalo Bills as they should've been included with the three other teams. Sorry for nit-picking.
This video sucks
On Tecmo Super Bowl I beat the Raiders with the Seahawks (Cortez Kennedy) 2 - 0  in OT. I thought it was the best game of TSB I ever played.
It'd be interesting to see a College football scorigami with schools that are in the FBS right now
what. the hell. lol
I guess the people who disliked, thought this was click bait, has cancer, is autistic, or somehow thinks this guys logic is autistic
Why arent the superbowl scores in here? Huh? you said ever
how do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
This video inspired me to go on to madden and win a game 6 to 1.
If you add college scores you could have a crazier scoragmi
Really good video I must say.
"A crazier stat is that in 1905, 19 players were killed during play, due to the lack of helmets

Solid video, kept my attention for the full 20 minutes and I'm not incredibly interested in football.
0-0 game, Team scores, time has expired, decides to go for two anyways, purposely runs it back for a safety.
awesome chart
one point safety
Jon Bois Editing and Production is A1
how about the 6 to 6 Seahawks tie with cardnails on Sunday night football now that game was crazy!
18:27 is rhe 6-1 game
In high school you can end 1-0 if you don't score in overtime because they go off of who goes the farthest
You can score 1-0. It's a 1point safety.
If you want proof that the one point is possible look at Brian Boddy Calhoun who in 2016 fumbled ,what would be a pick six, into the end zone resulting in a safety
nice video
This is very interesting and all and I love the concept of the video but you lost me after 4 min. I wasn't going to watch the whole 22 min of this. It's a shame, on my part. But I'm really not interested in finding out about the possibility of 6-1 score. Your amazing video made me sit the first 4 min.
This video was incredibly well done
nice video very informative
IF EVER THERE IS A 6-1 GAME, BROWNS WILL BE ON THE LOSING SIDE OF 6-1
What's the song at the end?
awesome video man
This video was pretty spectacular. Very informative and fun to watch.
Awesome video
I think the fact that there are not a lot of "good" games makes the actual good games that much better because they're rarer
The music made this video amazing lol good stuff
Someone make a video of them getting the 6-1 score in Madden. It'd be interesting to have people pre-enact some of these crazy scorigamis in Madden, considering Madden is a tangible thing we can actually visualize. That is considering Madden would have some of these peculiar rules such as the 1-point safety. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't tbh.
my high school once won a game 2-1. safety> rouge
I love the sports reference websites for years. They have literally every single statistic ever, and I love it.
This was incredibly interesting. I enjoyed every single minute.
Falcons 43-22 Packers, a new Scorigami.
This video was amazing
who knows about the game last year (2016) when the buccaneers beat the Seahawks 14-5?
Extremely well edited. Well done.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.
Washington NFL Team? Please don't make me become a Republican.

lets go seahawks
I can't believe the bears have the highest score
Why isnt 2-1 possible
MIND BLOWN
8-0 browns win
Lol Pete is the wizard
You can have a one score if you get cancer and watch Andrew drinks water #1
KC vs ATL had a 2-point defensive conversion. It actually won the Chiefs the game.
17:16 Actually, the first play of Super Bowl XLVI was a safety.
Why was this recommended to me? I've never even watched anything relating to football, nor do I watch or really enjoy it. GODDAMN IT YOUTUBE!
Gotta give this guy props
Actually for the 1-point safety and the 6-1 game, A falling on the ball in the endzone wouldn't be a safety. A would have to recover, run it out of the endzone, and then fumble it back in again (or run backwards into the endzone again) and be tackled.
My brother and I scored the one point on an old game of NCAA. He fumbled the two point, I ran it back and fumbled on the one
if an extra point is blocked and run back, is it one or 2 points
you didnt go back to the college game
There are actually new rules implemented to where now a pat can be brought back for one point. And a pick six on a 2 point conversion gives the defending team 2 points. So 1-0 isn't possible but 6-1 is possible in 2 different ways now. They used to call a play dead on fumbled pats and fumbles or interceptions on 2 pt conversions. But not since the new rules for the 2016-2017 season.
Just thought I'd inform you that the Washington, DC based American football team is called the Redskins.
this just made me whole
Original Video
This was amazing! Great editing and animations
I'm such an idiot that I got on Google Maps just so I could find out where he zoomed in on at 16:22.
For the one point safety, let's say team A scores the touchdown, and team B intercepts the two point conversion attempt and takes it back almost all the way then fumbles.  If team A recovers the fumble in the endzone and gets tackled, is that a one point safety scored to team B or just a zero point 'touchback?'  Do they actually have to recover it outside of the endzone and then move backwards into the endzone while trying to advance the ball for it to truly count as a one point safety?  This video implies that the 'touchback' situation also counts as a one point safety.
Now I know why it's called the quake run
Not only can't it be done. It's not a safety! They would have to recover on the field and then enter the end zone to be tackled there.
The Patriots could win a game 14 to 17.
I love this video
The Patriots beat the Titans 59-0
Phenomenal video! This has got to be one of, if not, the most interesting video I've ever seen about football. Thank you so much for your dedication!
What if the extra point bounces off the post and goes into the opponents goal post thus making a 6-1 game
wow that was probably one of the beast 21 minutes of my life
awesome video!
Whoever you are you need to play Light Yagami in the American live action deathote
"Honest question: Can anyone ever see a woman conceptualizing this, writing this, filming this and editing this? 

Men are just smarter than women. Facts are all around us."
AMAZING video idea dude!
For defensive 2 pt conversion, at 9:10, you should have shown a 6 point lego block. great video overall man. edit: this is really good, and I like the ending
neat
Thank you for including the rouge.
A rouge can happen, it's very rare.
Having trouble pronouncing the word "Redskins" I see... smh
That was a beautiful video
The 1-pt safety can also happen on an extra point on a fumbled snap where the kicker has to kick the ball backwards out of play, I think.  That scenario happened on a punt in a Pats-Colts playoff game.
The background music from 7:20-8:30 and at 9:57--> (and others?) sure does it for me..  Oy!
I enjoyed this video a lot more than I probably should have
what the hell did I just watched? is this autism? I like it. I imagine a new trend in making internet fuss everytime a possible socrigame might happen and people celebrating it cheering back and fort on teams to achieve it,. this is nice... certain imageboard might like it.
This man just made football interesting.
Awesome video
there is a way you can get 1 pt in football, but rare
Good-ass video
"Washington NFL Team"? wtf is that?? Is it because of the name being 'racist'? This is just sad now.
great vid, almost delegitimized by "Washington NFL franchise"
Could someone explain me how is 6-1 possible but not 7-1? A TD and 1pt field goal would give 7
What about a TD then a Blocked Extra Point that is returned????  6-1????
this was a great video.
If I could ever use one video to sum up my life, this would be it.
The one 11-10 game mentioned during this was Pittsburgh and San Diego in 2008.  Remember it like it was yesterday.
My mind is blown
that is cool
This is super interesting. You should create a website or blog or something detailing the "scorigamis" in the current season, would definitely watch it to get deeper into the game.
"Scoragamis this year according to the graph

Seahawks 37, 49ers 18
Patriots 41, Bills 25
Panthers 46, 49ers 27
Falcons 45, Saints 32
Falcons 48, Panthers 33"
mind blown
Great video
There is such a thing as a one point safety...
in 1922 you can see a 62-0 win, jesus
yo i know this is prp realy late but i kinda want a pdf of the chart
"If you search IMG 0001 you will actually see a video that has like 9 views that is of a deer eating some leaves!

Maybe that's what he was talking about at the end"
awesome vid
Technically 1 point could be scored if the defense gets a turnover on an extra point attempt and drop kicks it.
This was actually really cool
good video
Nice video man
If teams tried for a scorigami then wouldn't Goodell investigate for gambling purposes?
What's the score that has occurred the most?
Amaizing video!!!
This was a really good video....
I'm surprised Tomlin doesn't have more Scorigami games given how often he goes for 2.
He should do rugby
Greatest video ever
This needs to happen with college football
For the defensive 2-pt conversion...there's a 7 block not a 6 block.....
Where is the Seahawks 58-0 win against the Cardinals? I don't see it on there
I believe it but this doesn't work in madden
Titans in 2013 got a safety Vs the steelers on the kickoff. The dude caught the ball and took a knee but he had part of his foot out of the end zone so when he stepped back in and kneed it, it was a safety
I  could not stop watching this..
"IMG 3288

thank me later"
Very cool video!
this is my favorite football channel on youtube
my brain hurts
How do ties happen?
American football is boring and always will be.
Ok that was cool
I'm not much of a football fan, but I love these sort of statistical analysis videos. This was very interesting and well made, great video!
sooo this could have happened in the pro bowl?
This was an AMAZING presentation.  Was the slideshow made with Prezi?
Wow not even really a fan of football.. But i sat through all 20 minutes of this, i guess i really like this whole over analyzing thing.
as far as i know there is no 5 pt play in basketball even if you make a 3 and they fould you plus technical then you will have 2 chances to score 1 free throw.
18:24 Explanation of 6-1 score, finally.
Good job on 100,000 subs. At this moment im typing this he has not even 101,000 subs but over 100,000 subs
This is a true masterpiece
7:56 42 of them were scored by the Steelers.
only video about the NFL i'm interested in.
Fascinating video. Thank you.
I was pretty sure you could get a 1 point Safety without scoring a Touchdown.... not sure tho
the 2-0 score is due to a safety being the only score not attributed to a player
i like the part after 8:34
the 63-0 does not have a square, however the patriots beat the titans 63-0 in either 2010 or 2009
Great video, lots of effort
If I play in the NFL I will make the 6-1 game just for you
"International Rugby Union is another sport that Scorigami could work with. Tries (touchdowns) are 5 points, Point after conversions 2 points and penalty goals/drop kicks 3 points. But what shakes it up is than tries have changed in value from 1 through to 5 points over the life of the game, conversions 2-3 points, an briefly dropkicks were worth 4 points. 

Yep, in the early days of rugby the PAT was worth more than the touchdown."
What am I wasting. My life watching.
what program did you use to make this?
Has anyone tried the 6-1 game in Madden?
Really interesting video. The one thing I would have to say is that the calculation for the probability of a 4-4 game is a little incorrect. You're assuming that each probability is independent of each other, where in real life, if two good defenses were to play each other, the actual conditional probability of the 4-4 game happening would be higher than the number calculated. However, calculating that might be quite difficult, and I'm just nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking.
This video is lit
the two point defensive conversion in Madden lol
The look on the ref's face at 9:40 is priceless: "how the hell am I supposed to explain this to everyone watching?????"
That one time in the NFL...
This is the only good YouTube video thanks jon
This is entertaining
The scenario you posed for 6-1...wouldn't the kicking team have to pick up the fumble OUTSIDE the end-zone, and then run it back into the end zone? Falling on a fumble that's in your own end zone doesn't result in a safety, since the impetus came from the player who fumbled.
"And I promise we will get to it." -Audeince: Ughhhhhhh
didnt know math could be fun
if you play Madden you should attempt to get scorigami
6-1 could also happen if a missed extra-point were to remain in the field of play, be recovered by the opposing team and run all the way back to the opposite endzone. Right?
This is the most interesting video I have ever watched.
Where can I buy that poster?
at 6:30 were they really called the "Washington NFL team"?
Btw, they have the forfeit be 2-0 because a safety can be a stat where no player gets it, such as running out of the back, so they have it be 2-0 so no player gets any stats.
You earned a subscriber great video
Can a win of 10-1 happen?
"I know a great deal about football and I found this video to be really informative.

About the 6-1 scoragami scenario you presented though. I'm pretty sure on a regular play, it would result in a touch back where team A would have the ball on their 20 yard line instead of team B getting a safety. So I think to truly get a 6-1 game, you would need a panicked or confused team A player to take the ball all the way back to their own endzone without turning the ball over to team B."
you're math was way off. if there's a 86 % chance of a scoreless ot, you don't multiply by 86. because if there was a 100 % chance then the odds would be bigger (?) that doesn't make sense. can I work at SB please? I'll do the math to start out with but it will be so good that I'll get to write op eds. these are my dreams.
im lost
John Boise you forgot to mention the odds that both times a 1 point safety happened in college football, the same announcer was there.
(Commenting about the end of the video) Most videos with no views on YouTube are just listings for houses, cars and other junk.
Can't you get a one point play if you block an extra point and run it back?
What a good video
This guy changed my life
this is brilliant
Someone knows how to use Prezi, watch out :o
1-0 is possible if the score is 0-0 and one team forfeits.
9:21 this can also happen by blocking the point after touchdown. Unfortunately, my team actually went through this rare scenario when kicking an extra point to win the game because the now former special teams coach of my team was insanely inept.
you should mark Scoragami's that have happened in Superbowl's in red.
This is amazing! I don't comment often but I really appreciate the work you put into this - how you made numbers & scores so interesting is beyond me but it was fun to watch!
this is an excellent video, you deserve more views for the work that went into this.
Doing a scorigami for the CFL would be crazy
So... Totally random: but you say that no team has ever ended a game with 4 points... but there is a green square in one of the 4's (like 14-4 or something, didn't quite see what the opponents score was).
Why isn't a 1-1 game possible, drop kicks are worth 1-point there for because NFL games can end in ties there can be a 1-1 score
but there are 1 pt safeties
6-1 can also occur by having a touchdown by team A followed by a blocked extra point, fumble, or pick which is returned almost to the endzone, before the team B player carrying it, for whatever reason, drop-kicks it through the posts.
The alternative 6-1 scorigami is if the extra point is blocked and the ball somehow makes its way into the scoring team's end zone with them on top. An 85 yard block is unlikely however, and would also likely require a return that is fumbled and recovered in the end zone by the scoring team.
this is the most elaborate uselessness I've ever witnessed.
why does this not have a million views this is amazing
12:46: The most Browns thing to ever Browns.  And there have been a lot.
Isn't there another way to score 1 point or is that just college?
you keep on talking about how the nfl was able to last because all the games were "boring". You have the privilege of being able to watch a leauge that has had almost 100 years of history. The rules have changed so much since then that defenses are able to do much less. You have the context of what a "good" game is, people back then didn't.
@19:11 you can also get 1 point as defense, if the extra point kick, is short, and a defensive player catchs its and return it 100 yards.
Falcons blew a 28-3 game
What about the one point safety?
6-1 happened to me in madden
This is literally the best video I've ever watched
The reason the game ends 2-0 if a team forfeits is because a safety is the only score that isn't recorded to a specific player
need to remake this cause Pete Carroll Struck again witha  6-6 tie.
My ideal game is a defensive battle that ends like 5-3 or 7-2 maybe 13-7.
Did I just spend 20 min watching this?
lol i did this in madden like 5 yrs ago and won 6-1
coach of team a tells all receivers to run backwards, QB throws int the instead of attempting to tackle the defender, they just punch the ball, let it roll into the end zone then team A picks up ball in end zone and "falls" out of bounds
IDK if it fits here but what about the seahawks 6-6 tie with the cardinals in October 2016?
Wouldn't a 6-1 also be possible if a conversion was intercepted or fumbled and then a drop kick was scored by the the defense??
That's not that bad
amazing
How about the defensive two point conversions where if the defense gets a TD during a conversion their team gets 2 points?
Coolest vid ive seen in a while nice work!
14:00 explains the browns organization in one play
The team with 1 can score 7 and get 3 safety's resulting in a 6-1 score
I have you a like, just because this took an insane amount of research
CRAP! at 14:23 I thought my screen was falling to its side I literally grabbed my monitor XD
Fantastic.
Related: Probability of winning the final score in Super Bowl Squares http://tabsoft.co/2ko8AIK
"Here's what I wonder... how close would Madden scorigami be to NFL scorigami? Are you more likely to see a Madden simmed game end 6-1 significantly before 1.7 billion seasons pass. What other differences are there? Are there scores much more likely to happen in Madden that have never happened in the NFL?

Seriously... is scorigami... ""in the game""?"
"There was a game that I went to where at one time the score was 11 - 10 Iowa. (Iowa ended up winning 14 - 13)
But this is possible by:
Michigan: 1 touchdown, 1 Field goal.
Iowa: 1 safety,  1 touchdown (2 Point conversion failed), 1 field goal."
I love how he makes scoragami sound like this famous historically important thing not something he made up 20 minutes ago
I'm not a football fan, at all, but that video was amazing!
The Steelers just scored 6 field goals in a game
10-1 try and calculate those odds. One touchdown plus defensive 1 point convert plus QTY 2 2 point converts.
Might be fun to play pro Scoragami every season with just scores from the season so that first game of the pre-season the board was 'empty'. You buy scores based on probability or some such.
2-pt conversion on Falcons...
will you be updating the chart after the Super Bowl?
I think it's kind of nuts that 14-8 hasn't happened.  Winning team gets 2 touchdowns (simple), losing team decides to try for 2 pt conversion on their sole touchdown to be in better position to win.  That's kind of an insane move, since a failure puts them in crazy bad position, but I could see it happening.
Early football was pretty much one or two powerful teams and then like 6 garbage teams, many of which no longer exist. It was also running based before the forward pass was even legal. 3 yards and a cloud of dust football.
werent field goals originally 5 points?
Forfeits are scored as a 2-0 score because safeties are not awarded to any player but instead to a team
Eric Berry made a defensive 2 point conversion this season
I wonder if Madden would accurately reflect the 1-point safety on conversion attempts. Probably not, but someone needs to try it.
this video was pretty good
But there's a one point safety when the defense recovers the ball over any type of turnover and retreat back into their own endzone and get tackled.
You deserve way more subscribers.  These videos are great!!!!!  Keep up the good work!!
That was like...cool
This stuff is better than Matlock.
How do you score 5 in 1 basketball play? I guess you could make a 3, get fouled, miss the free throw, get the rebound, and score 2. But this isn't a 5 point play, it is a 3 and 2 point play. 7:03
I'm surprised 8-7 has never happened
Some kicker,maybe Tucker, this year suggested 1 point for kicking the ball through the uprights on a kickoff.Â  So there may actually be hope for 1-0 after all!!

At 14:03, only the Browns could lose a game that way.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Amazing video's Jon. Keep em coming.
2016 Week 14 TBvsNO got close. With 16-11 Tampa lead late, Bucs had the Saints deep in their endzone, forcing Brees to hurry a pass. Didn't quite get the sack, which would have gave us 18-11, and if it held (as 16-11 held with no safety) would have had a scorigami. But no dice...16-11 only happened previously in 2014 Week 15 NYJvsTEN -- and now its twice in 2 years
Bucs and saints on scoragomi alert
Ennui pretty much describes what it's like to be a Bears fan.
As a statistician, I'm not sure about your probabilities for figure 7; you can only multiply probabilities like that if the chance of each thing happening is independent, so the probability of one thing happening doesn't affect the probability of the other thing happening, so you can multiply the probability of a die landing on 6 and a coin landing on heads, but you shouldn't multiply the probability of one person in a family having a genetic disease by the probability of their sister having it, because if one of them has it the other is more likely to. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about the rules of football, but I'd suspect that a team who gets two two-point safeties is likely to not be very good, so they're more likely to be shut out, but then if both teams get two safeties, neither are likely to be very good, so a scoreless overtime is more likely... Your numbers probably aren't far off, but the calculations aren't particularly rigorous.
If Jon ever made another episode on NBA y2k, he could do an episode on breaking the record for lowest scoring game by having the final score to be 1-0. How? Bump all the player's attributes to 0, but keep Jon's players free throw at 100 and the AI's draw foul attribute to 100. Make one free-throw and miss them all, and that's it
I wish there was more dark scorigami tbh. It's cool, and kind of scary. I hope the NFL makes weird rules that give teams like 100 points for something stupid. god I love the Chart Party music
If you like high scoring games so much, watch either college or arena. The NFL is at its best when it's lower close scores.
How do you get a 5 point play in basketball?
this had better be the only jon bois video exclusively posted on this channel, or I am in for a long night
If the Seahawks ever have the ball near their endzone at the end of a game up by 3+, after giving up a safety (say holding in the endzone, this'll happen with their Oline), you know what Pete is gonna instruct Jon Ryan to do
i dont know anything about american football, why did i watch this
Unbelievably awesome video. In-depth, well paced, and interesting throughout. A tour de force of NFL scoring. 10/10 would watch again.
Damn SB Nation great video, cool mix of history and wacky stats. Honestly you guys deserve so many more views and subs, because no one is making videos like this. Also I bet the research for this episode was a nightmare, keep it up!!!
wtf did i just watch
Hey jon, when you are calculating the odds of a 4-4 game and you consider the offense being shut out, how are you accounting for other defensive scores, like a pick 6 or fumble return TD.... (or dare I say a 3rd safety, but let's not go there)?
The ground rule safety at 3:30 was weird as hell
This video was incredibly well put together and inspiring. I'll be taking notes.
Isn't blocking an extra point and returning it for a TD worth one point?
I really want to know why the teams were terrible at the beginning?
jon bois is back, he is my favorite filmmaker
6-1 would probably only happen with a team deciding to do something weird. I don't know, last play of game, scoreless, team scores TD (why not a FG? I don't know, I'm making this scenario up). They get the snap for the PAT, and run it back all the way, intentionally taking the 1 point safety. It's not likely, but it's more likely than it happening by chance
Also Jon by adding the rogue you could get a 1-0 game
Excellent video!
i love this
This is so retarded .... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have to ask: Where's the updated Scorigami chart in picture form so we can play along? Last one on SB Nation was posted back in 2012.
Another Seahawks Scorigami two weeks ago: the 5-13 vs. the Bucs
Once again, absolutely brilliant.
Now, do scorigami college football. That would be hell considering how many college games have been played, but it would be cool
chiefs - falcons week 13 2016 ending in a pick 2
Pretty good.
This was great
I'm waiting for the day of an 0-0-16  season by every team... what would happen?
Jon, you blow me away every time with your videos. May I ask how long it took you to do this one? Thanks for the content. You have a huge future ahead of you.
I hate to say it but I believe you guys are wrong about the ability to score 1 point. I believe the rule is that if you get a safety on a 2 point conversion or a extra point attempt then it awards the team who got the safety with 1 point. Rule 11-3-2-c. "If a try results in what would ordinarily be a safety against either team, one point is awarded to the opponent.
Don't underestimate the masochism of bears fans
Very cool
9:14 that's the wrong piece!
What about the 10-4 score you have marked on your board?
Pretty much 6-1 is gonna happen when the next Leon Lett enters the league
your voice could put David Blaine to sleep.
this is pretty good
It could be worse for them.
"Funny thing is they did get rid of that derp coach, told Apple to fuck off, DRC is retired and they drafted Barkley.

Oh wait Eli Manning is still there, the o-line is fucking terrible and OBJ is still being a fucking idiot.

Crazy."
Another season, and still 1-7
I'm a giants fan and I agree. derp derp derp
"As a giants fan, this video is pretty funny until I remember that the other teams I like are the Mets, Knicks, and Rangers.

Why does god punish me like this?"
And now Dirpman is Old Man Dirpman, they are in the middle of a fire sale of anything valuable, looks like      they took a page from Sam Hinkie's playbook. TIME TO REV UP THE TANKS G-MEN!!!!!!!!
I just give up on eli and the rest of the derps
Even tho they good
Do the patriots
There goes Eli............... Apple
At least they got Saquon Barkely FivePointsVids! Does that help any? There 1-6 :/
You know what, he did call what happened in the end
Barkley is great but no money after paying that headcase WR.
dat Saquon Barkley predict tho
Wow made about a year ago and still super relevant.
My parents are huge Giants fans.  I should send this to them. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Not as bad as the Jets.
Don't care have superbowls
Another example of the NFL's continued decline, NBC's refusal to broadcast Sunday Night games featuring 2 teams that aren't Dallas and/or the Giants.
2018-19 looks like more of the same, at least we can stat pad Saquon to OROY by just throwing checkdowns to him every other play and ask him to fix everything. Just keep dirping just keep dirping (dirp, dirp, dirpidy, dirp, dirp, dirp)
Canâ€™t what to see the comments of giants fans saying they won 2 Super Bowls against the Pats (I havenâ€™t looked at the comments)
Crazy that he called Giants picking Saquon Barkley
New York sports teams suck
I died when he said "OH LOOKS ITS ERIC FLOWERS"
"5:36 to end, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened.

Minus the bring back Tom Coughlin."
As a Giants fan, this is one of the funniest videos I have ever fucking seen. Brilliant!
0 playoff wins in 16 of the last 18 seasons lol
I mean, it was a good Rudyard Kipling poem.
Derp
The Atlanta Falcons: A legacy of Failure
I never thought I'd see the Giants suck and the Eagles win a superbowl
Why did u show the 9/11 building on fire seriously dude!
They just got saquon Barkley so their running game might be good this year ðŸ‘€
Ouch I heard you 5Point

"â€œThat is, of course, if we donâ€™t waste our first round pick on Saquon Barkley...â€
the New York Giants draft Saquon Barkey
Curb Your Enthusiasm theme starts playing"
I still can't understand why he would sell fake game memorabilia. Obviously he didn't need the money. So much derp.
About that Barkley pick.....
I am a Giants fan, this is my story...
Philip Rivers is a much better QB than Eli.
the best part is they actually drafted barkley
that New England prep school comment had me rolling cause there was a running joke at my middle school (Massachusetts) that the gym teacher was in fact a pedophile; it's a very accurate stereotype apparently :)
Well they now have Barkley
Love the ending, God I never get tired of seeing that.  Hope the trip to Miami was worth it for Obj & co.
You could just push Eli very light and heâ€™ll fall over
3:35 could someone get me a link to that clip?
Ha! Ha! Itâ€™s funny because the Giants got rid of McAdoo, and did get Saquon Barkley.
1:23 I had heard of Shaun Draughn before this so jokes on you lol
2:15 hahaha
Well they ended up getting Barkley
I can say without sarcasm that this video aged well, at least up to July 2018
Ben McAdoo kinda looks like Carl from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

I h8 the giants
3:50 I was dying right there
title made me laugh so hard
GENO SMITH!
Just came back to this. You guys did get saquan and that's the sad thing
It's funny because they drafted Barkley...
5:56 the weird thing is, I think they did all those things
Do the Buccaneers
This why I love the Giants. Because the team is a lolcow it makes them more like underdogs
Coming back to watch this and of course they drafted Barkley.
Bet fivepoints loved this
At least mcadoo is gone
"1:02  I was at that game
Fly eagles fly"
And then they actually drafted Barkley.
Well, the Giants drafted Barkley...
bro you used the fucking derp song in 2017 any opinion you have is invalid
"Hey guess what FivePoints. Your dream came true. Barkley is drafted.

And the NFC East is now slightly spooked."
Derp derp
Idc if the giants have more superbowls, the eagles own the giants
As a Dallas Cowboys fan it gave me great joy to watch that team die the slow and agonizing death it deserved

Go die
Well all three fingers of JPP are now in Tampa.
MetLife stadium home of the derp and a butt fumble lol
GENO SMITH
The Giants are basically the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFC. Hate 'em both
Odell Beckham Jr. is "just a sliver less of a diva" than Antonio Brown. How's that looking now?
All three fingers of Jason Pierre Paul lmao
Well, at least Mcadoo and Reese are finally gone. They simply didn't work or get along with others.
Became a semi giants fan when 18-1 happened, then realized they're basically shit and went for Steelers
"Built on all 3 fingers of Jason Pierre Paul" WOW. JUST WOW.
Only good team in NY is the Yankees and sometimes the rangers, but thatâ€™s it...
Iâ€™m a giants fan from birth and we are a fucking derp lol
ITS JOHNNNNNNY FOOTBALL!!!!
Why the fuck do you bench Eli...
Shit dude good thing we have Dave gettleman and pat shurmur now
Ben McAdoo: The Ultimate Derp

I'm a  giants fan and this shit is hilarious
Good riddance to McAdoo...doo.
"on behalf of all giants fans,

derp"
I cringe so hard every time I hear that bone breaking sound effect.
Giants need to resign Michael Strahan, David Tyree and maybe Brandon Jacobs
Being a giants fan I fucking love this!!!
THE DERP ERA
Did the patriots lose 2 or 1 super bowl
"All 3 fingers of Jason Pierre-Paul" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
A good pick was Evan Engram
Painfully accurate... Let's just be glad this isn't about history of the franchise
2:59 gotta hurt for Giants fans. The whole receiving core died in one week. Thatâ€™s impressive.
Not a lolcow yet, but theyre trying
amazing how its always bradys 'fault' if a team with no Ol-defense-and -or recievers 'only' gets to the afc title game but eli manming can have his fucking team of high talent fucking quit in week one and its not his fault?
'remember when he was fucking terrible and the giants faithful nearly ran him out of town?' so u mean every year not ned 2007 or 2011?
Ben Mcadoo sex offender profile LMfao haahaha
I'm a Cowboys fan and I want to watch the Cowboys one!
fuck you spanos!
Sad season for us. But honestly, not too far off from a playoff team. Minus the injuries, some good coaching, and a decent draft class we could be a contender again in a few years. Need to get better on both lines
As a Giants fan, I fully endorse this video.
He doesnâ€™t get a pass from the memorabilia thing for winning 2 Super Bowls. He gets a pass for his Walter Payton MOTY award.
This is great u and 5points are hilarious my two favorite sports YouTubers â€œjust look at all that speedâ€
Maybe Evan Engram
Good Picks over last 3 years: So far Landon Collins and Sterling Shepard
I'm a die hard giants fan and I was waiting excitedly for this video XDDD Im dying
4:13 Evan Engram
Fivepointvids cameo! Yay!
I'm a patriots fan and if I see a pats video from this guy I'm gonna luagh and click and lie the video
well you got gettleman back so the futures bright
3-13...welp shit
Jets lose to the Giants and say they lost due to no home advantage
A friend of mine has had season tickets for a decade and has never left during a game and has gone to a few road game
Does anyone know what song is in the background
I knew this vid was coming when we lost to the chargers
Cleveland Browns, The History of Sadness
ben mcadoo is the worst coach ever
i like to think that ben mcadoo got fired because the owner of the giants watched this video
At least we're not 0-16 cough cough Browns cough cough lions cough cough.
So much derp, I love it.
I think the Giants haven't been that bad
Eli got benche for Geno Smith...he could make a vid only about that
You canâ€™t have Tom. Heâ€™s in Florida, heâ€™s old. Thatâ€™s like asking peanut butter to go on without jelly.
As a giants fan I agree with this video 100% and hey at least we took steps in the right direction by firing mcadoo and our gm
oof
Umm, Jerry Reese is gone, but McAdoo is gone so it's ok.
Hey at least They decided to try and clean house by firing Ben McAdoo and the bumbling idiot they call a GM... too bad they broke Eli's streak to start GENO FUCKING SMITH
McAdoo got fired. Wonder if this'll be included in the next video UT makes.
A pigfaced clown. The derp master. The luckiest qb in nfl history.
Chicago Bulls: Professional Basketball's Slaughterhouse
Jerry Reese and Ben McaDerp are gone now
"After last Sunday, expect Mr. Doo to be ""adopted"" to a nice family farm where he will run free.

Don't ask about the 2 shell casings on the floor."
"When he's not openly abusing kicking nets he's demanding to be paid all of the money"
The hammer dropped as both GM J. Reese and Coach McAdoo were relieved of their duties approx. 231pm Monday 12/4/17.
They finally fired Mcadoo
Well this video is already irrelevant,   guess the Giants saw this
Who the fuck is Eli Apple?
RIP Ben McAderp. Fired today.
Mcadoo and reese fired
And now everyone in New York is sighing in relief.
Derp, derp, derp,derp,de-derp.
and now they bench Eli... RIP there playoff chances
This was strangely predictive.
lol they got worse
I still am upset that the Giants had to snap the Patriots' undefeated streak. I mean... had the Patriots won, they would have made history but no. :(
Imagine how this would look if he made it now compared to two weeks ago?
3:41, rings so true
1:01 how prophetic you were, UT
You forgot the time they blew a 21 point lead with 7 minutes
Can you d the Lions next?
When will there be a lowcow video of the Miami Marlins?
After the Eli benching, you need to get Ben MacCadoo is own lolcow video
Breaking News: The Giants benched Eli Manning for Geno Smith.
do the Ravens and Dolphins.
And this week we actually have Geno Smith starting.  Good lord.
"You made this video 2 weeks too early
RIP Eli Manning"
They're benching Eli... For Geno Smith ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ fuck you McAdoo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
As a Jets fan this is absolutely beautiful to see. The amount of giants fans that made fun of me are insane. Now you guys are a Lolcow. Welcome to the club motherfuckers!!!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
After Eli's benching today, Giants fans are probably gonna want a "Fuck You McAdoo" every week now.
You should have waited a few weeks to make this video if you had you could have included the Giants benching Manning for Geno.
Iï¸ got the rangers at least
Looks like you should have waited a few weeks to make this.
You should do a video on how bad the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been through out history.Lets not forget that in their first two years of existence(1976 & 1977)they went 0-26 before winning their first game as a franchise.Then when Vinnie Testaverde showed up he couldn't stop throwing interceptions.I know this is only a fraction of what has made the Bucs awful but it's enough to warrant a video ;-)
COLTS LOLCOW WE ARE TERRIBLE, (I am a sad ,sad colts fan)
Do the chiefs! Pro footballâ€™s perpetual let down
Urinatingtree what's your favourite team
Hey Tree, you're the most underrated channels I have ever seen. Hope you get 500k+ in the next few months.
Do the San Jose sharks
Do the Chicago Bulls next.
3:13 LMAO as a giant fan thatâ€™s so fucking true
Do Atlanta Hawks!!!
Still waiting on the Detroit lions.  I know itâ€™s low hanging fruit but sometimes it fun to hit the easy targets.
dont make fun of the giants, they broke down barriers by drafting the only quarter back with all out mental retardation
Please do my cowboys
Do one on my Cowboys since 1996, I love them but they are a train wreck!
We just need the Cowboys to complete the division. And I say they deserve one.
They lost to the niners â€˜Nuff said
They lost to the niners â€˜Nuff said
The Miami Dolphins: Professional Football's Japanese Food
Urinating Tree please make a vid on the flyers they fuckin suck a bag of dicks
I sense a great Derp in the Force ...
I know guys who wear sweat pants and wife beaters/muscle shirts on a regular basis.
But yet the Chiefs managed to lose to them. The Chiefs are super derp.
Do the flyers. Paul holmgren gave you plenty of material, and Ron Hextall might actually make them competent soon. Wouldn't want to miss my team get ripped to shreds for all the sadness and shitty goaltending it's forced down my throat.... FUCK YOU SPANOS
Do eagles legacy of failure
What about the Dallas cowboys?
Do the packers
Los Angeles Clippers: NBAâ€™s sunken ship
We now derped tanking we beat the chiefs kill me now as a giants fan
How the hell have you not done the Detroit Lions?!? I already know the roast of that team would be so unfair it would redefine the term "scorched earth policy"!.
As a cowboys fan this video is awesome
Should have waited a week for them to lose to the 49ers before releasing this
My Redskins stink but I smile when I look at the Giants' record
Do the Miami Marlins Next!
LMFAO yeah the Giants have derped their way through the past decade
OBJ is a way bigger Diva than AB
derp derp derpitty derp derp!
i also feel like the Detroit Lions legacy of failure is long .... overdue
Arizona Cardinals, Tampa Bay Buccs, Houston Texans, and The Miami Dolphins are a couple you could do.
Your sports videos are helping me through my depression.
Ben Macdoo looks better in Madden than real life....
Packers next? I would love see you attempt it.
This video is perfect!!!! i have been requesting this!!!!  MORE DERP JOKES!!! Lol Love it!!!
Where is SportsBall for Week 10?
Alright pissing timber.....it is now time to deconstruct the Arizona Coyotes
I feel like the giants are the Mets of football, whatever good they had on the team (which is very little things) have been hurt and everything else is complete trash.
They fucking lost to the 49ers
Do sports ball
Do I Green Bay one. Ted Thompson needs to be ripped a new asshole and after the way you obliterated Stan Kroenke, I couldnâ€™t think of anybody better for the job.
I'm a New Yorker and I find this utterly hilarious.
Where the fuck is Sportsball: Week 10?!?
Boy, the Browns are unlucky, they don't play the Giants...
As a fellow Pitt Panthers fan, You NEED to make a video about how shitty our attendance is and a video about us losing to damn UNC
Congrats Italy for not making the World Cup.
RIP
I am a Giants fan and this is great. I was thoroughly entertained.
Should do a video on the Cubs.  1 world series win doesn't make up for the other 107 years of failure.
I know you're not really a soccer person, but I feel like you could make an amazing video about the English National Team
Derp.
"49ers: 31

Midgets: 21"
Isn't that song the opening to Carmen San Diego?
And my Niners even beat them lol
At least they didn't go undefeated just to lose in the Superbowl.
Please pick apart my Patriots.
Do one on the College Football Playoff
This week in Sportsball What the Fuck are you doing Ginger Hammer ?? Not to mention the Patriots dismantle the Broncos and the best play of the game for Denver is Brock oswieler nailing a guy in the face with a football
Thank you for that first win, guys. Sincerely, the 49ers. PS: Are you playing the Browns this season?
ROFL Giants lost to 49ers!
Derp
You should do a video on the Toronto Maple Leafs post-1967.
Well Giants, at least your color scheme is pleasant on the eyes. Can't say the same for the Browns(BTdubs, I am a Patriots fan who relishes in the Giants complete and utter incompetence and failure, mainly because they robbed the Pats of 2 Super Bowls and a perfect 19-0 record. You guys would've been spared from the Fins bragging about 17-0 in '72 had we won. Just saying.
Just Fucking fire Mcado please
Do Baltimore Ravens next!
The moment youâ€™re done making that video, my niners finally got a win!!!
"The Cleveland Cavaliers: Pro Basketballâ€™s Championship - Caliber Shitshow 




As a cavs fan I really wanna see this"
As a native of Pittsburgh, whatâ€™s your opinion on Nate Peterman? I watched him play at pitt, and I think he could be a solid nfl qb if he was given a chance at Buffalo
Do the Bulls.
Holy shit i just realized im wearing an obj shirt
FivePointsVids yes!
Really liked the spongebob music on mcaBoo
And how did this guy beat Tom Brady twice in the SB again?
Dear eagles fans before you start talking shit remember 4 is better then 0
My name is also Eli. So this vid was fun
Who would have thought that the Giants would even lose to the 49ers?
And a day later this video got uploaded, the 49ers got their 1st win of the 2017 NFL season.
How do you lose to the fucking 49ners ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Š
My dadâ€™s an old pro... heâ€™s been putting up with the derp since the 1958 NFL Championship Game. Not much has changed in the past 60 years. Honestly, if the Giants hadnâ€™t played the Patriots both times, I wish they lost both Super Bowls. No mediocrity is more painful than the one induced by a couple of championships. Itâ€™s why Jerry Reese still has a job in spite of drafting like shit.
"Fuck you Spanos!
Your Chargers has just killed the Giant's season!"
Do one on the bucs? They overall deserve it.
What a good looking ending
When are you going to do the Saints. We all know that there is a lot to say about them over their history.
Are we a lolcow now?
I feel like you made this a couple days too early...
You should do the San Jose Sharks
5:07 - shove bamboo underneath it fingernails? wtf? I've never heard that expression before in my life... or did u just make that up on the spot? If u did, wtf is it supposed to mean? I'm guessing it trying to say it hurts but wtf is going thru ur mind that u associate pain with having bamboo being shoved underneath ur fingernails?... n here I thought that I had a messed up head but u DEFINITELY take the cake in this one, without a doubt in my mind!
If only you had waited for them to lose to the 49ers lol
Did you reference the "Hunger Death?"
Geno Smith is god
Spanos is the reason they lost to the 49ers. FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Where is sportsball?
"I love the crossover, didn't see that coming but it was hilarious
also, now do the cowboys to finish off the NFC east"
UrinatingTree, if you are preparing for a Lolcow video for my Texans, reply to this so I can give you every talking point for you to exploit.
It's 2017 quit with the 2013 memes
Now, they got all but routed by the 49ers, who last beat a team not named the Rams in 2015. I think the intentional tank may be in order...
Ab>>>obj
"They just lost to the 49ers.

Wow."
May you forever have material to work with... I fucking LOVE this channel! Keep up the great work!
Damn itâ€™s like all our teams suck. Iâ€™m a Jets Mets Rangers Knicks fan. Pray for me
Funny cuz they lost to the fucking 49ers
The voiceover is almost good, it's slightly unfunny though.  I learned a lot, though!   The second guy is definitely funnier, but I appreciate the original content, guys!!!  Love to see some new shit
I came straight here after the Giants loss to the Niners
Please do us all a favor andÂ don't waste the careers ofÂ Landon Collins andÂ Paul Perkins.
And now they lost to a team that was winless.
Fucking damn it, this video was too early, the just lost to the 49ers... LMAO
THEY LOST TO THE FUCKING SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS
FivePoints!
Wow look at all of those glorious V I E W S
I fucking love you man!
nobody knows the pain of being  a giants fan it fucking sucks
And they just lost to the 49ers. They're so bad, it's almost not funny anymore. (key word: Almost)
1-8! We're unstoppable! Honestly though, watch us get a shitty player in the draft. Thanks, Jerry Reese!
Can i have permission to react to your videos.

fuck u macado
Can you do a Minnesota Timberwolves legacy
I was expecting you to be much harsher on this shit show on a team.
Sad thing is, I'm a Giants fan and I agree with most of, if not all of this.
Where is week 10 sportsball?
They derp so hard they do not even know what state they play in. ðŸ¤¥
Canâ€™t wait for the season to be over and fire everybody and rebuild and get this franchise back in place.
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I lost my will to live week 3
Hey, UrinatingTree, do you think you can mention the CFL in the next "This Week In Sportsball", since there's two CFL playoff games being played on Sunday?
NOOOO TOO SOON URINATING TREE. MY GIANTS :(
Least I got kristaps and the knicks for a seasonâ€¦ LET THE TANK TRAIN BEGIN!
Atlanta Thrashers/ current Winnipeg Jets for the next lolcow
That Derp song though.
"Yeah, the Giants have been bad this year, but this is still a team that won a championship in, what, the last five years?

I still eagerly await a Cowboys video."
The Giants are the shame of all of New York City. We were doing pretty well and it all just collapsed. Something monumental needs to happen, or the giants will be the laughing stock of the NFL for the next decade.
Do a lolcow on the Tennessee Volunteers... 10 years of dumpster fire content to dissect.
Do a video on the Phoenix Suns
We need a Toronto Blue Jays lolcow
Do haters guide to 2017 -2018 college football Bowles when they come out
Do a re due if the Cleveland Browns expect call then professional footballs brown note
Only clicked cuz packers
In my scratching NYG fan ego: Sure, we won four Super Bowl titles, but it's once per decade for four straight decades. We can't make a dynasty.
I just hope the giants get a good draft pick.
You only won 2 super bowls in the last 10 years take it easy motherfuckers. I'm a Packers fan and shareholder and you guys turn on motherfuckers too fast, it's called loyalty.
You earned yourself a dislike
Shut up, at least we have four super bowls.
Holy shit bringing in 5Points made this video 200x funnier
I think Pekka Rinne was too good last night
A pot of daffodils can block better than Flowers.
Remember when people said they were Super Bowl caliber
I know the feeling.
I'm dying BEN MCADOO LOOKS LIKE A PE TEACHER
i lost it lol, I love being a giants fan, thank you for raising my spirits with this hilarious video.
As a giants fan I can safely say... FUCK YOU MCADOO
Why do the giants suck so much this year? :(
Reminds me of penguinz0/critikal, but still a great video
Ben McADerp
I mix of UrinatingTree and FivePointVids? Am I in heaven?
Well, it could be worse... you could be the browns.
Donâ€™t let this distract you that Eli Manning will be the only QB to beat Tom Brady The GOAT twice in the Super Bowl.
4:20 that hit makes me cry
Its funny because the Green Bay Packers have had 2 back to back HOF QBs in Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers and have 2 super bowls to show for it total. Eli Manning has 2 super bowls to show for his time in New York. Giants are as good as Packers confirmed
Well now that youâ€™ve gone after the giants, it would only be fitting if you went after another 4 Super Bowl franchise - the Packers and how theyâ€™ve been holding back Aaron Rodgers (at least recently)
as a giants fan thank u
LOL WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM I EVEN SAID IS HE A SEX OFFENDER! ðŸ˜‚
This is comedy gold HA HA HA HA #GoCowboys #WeDemBoyz
Bro don't roast me Giants B
FUCK YOU SPANOS
i am truly sorry for all you poor Giants fans, i am a saints fan but you guys are doomed
Fuck you Jerry Reese!
Why FivePointsGaming?
"A DERP A DERP A DERPADERP.

DE DERP DE DERP DE TEEDLY DERPY DERPY DUMB."
men over the age of 21 who say "derp" should be neutered.
I fucking love these videos!
As a Giants fan...thank you.
So glad these are backðŸ˜‚
FivePointVids yo wassup
"Five Points Vids, you do realize that Barkley is a running back from Penn State, right?
Honestly the Giants should just try to trade the #3 pick to the bears and see what happens"
How about doing "Phoenix Suns: Professional Basketball's Burning Trash in the Desert" next?
OOOOHHHH FUN A COLAB! you really are becoming a full grown tree arent you?
Do the Bucs man
Drinks Giants Fans Tears #FlyEaglesFly
FivePoints vids is cancer.

Why do I have a feeling the Green Bay Packers are going to get the lolcow label soon?
I really hope you use the derp song more often.
Mcadoodoo
Ben Mcado and joe philbin, 2 ex packer assistant that failed as a coach, With horrible teams too
"Shoot Eli apple" XD
Landon Collins is actually playing like garbage this year
No fuck you spanos?
"â€œName one good pick from the last 3 years that isnâ€™t Landon Collinsâ€

OBJ, Sterling Shepard, Weston Richburg, BJ Goodson"
I'm sorry but Odell Beckham isn't close to Antonio Brown... AB is far better than that ramen head ass
No one mentioned who the two legends of urinating tree and five points gaming made a collab for this gem?
Okay I love your videos & I donâ€™t mind you trashing my Giants but itâ€™s Ben & Our GMs fault Eli is the only one trying with nothing around him
Colts should be the next lolcow.
"Wait.... Tree AND 5 POINTS...? IN 1 VIDEO?! IS THIS REAL LIFE?

Life is good sometimes"
It would be sad if Barkley's career was wasted in New York. Dude has some talent.
eli is almost gone, beckam wants to be the highest paid in the enitre league, and mcadoo hasn't worked out.  have fun giants fans.
The Giants might suck huge cock but they still wake Tom Brady up at night in a cold sweat.
what's with great youtubers shilling for shitty youtubers lately?
I'm so mad but this is so true
Don't forget about the big Week 10 game against San Fransisco
Bro whereâ€™s the Buccaneers Lolcow, too easy?
Timberwolves suck.
My god tree and five points gaming I can die happy now
I don't care for hand-egg, I just enjoy your ranting. :)
As an eagles fan I enjoyed this... But my franchise is also a derp
I hate the second guys voice so fuckin much
The depression has consumed my body. All I know is pain.

Hey look a colab with Five Point Vids!
I knew this was coming but shit. Still love my team tho
Do the Atlanta hawks
Pretty lame
When are you going to do a video on the Detroit Lions?
Can we get a big 12 refs lolcow?
As a giants fan i was so anticipated for this video and i love it. So true in every single way. Jerry Reese and Ben Mcadoo fucked up a possible super bowl contender. We went from contender to lolcow faster then you could say Desean Jackson.
"Read ""the draw play"" 
It's a comic by the most depressed Giants fan ever"
Itâ€™s just an odd year.
Is Pekka Rinne still too good now?
Iâ€™m a giants fan and this season is just disappointing if we lose to the niners tomorrow I will become a jets fan for the rest of the season
...And the Broncos lost to this team
I saw this coming
My favorite line in regards to the New Jersey Giants stated in an earlier video was that the Giants have a Giant Horseshoe stuffed up their ass.
I don't care much about the Giants, I'm more shocked that the Eagles made a 61-yard field goal.
fuck me its mcadoos fault, we got the yanks knicks and rangers at least
Only the NYJ would let the NYG Unintentionally, "Trust The Process" and recoup draft picks & lose QB B. Mayfield/ S. Darnold or J. Rosen for 2018. Smh. S. Barkley from Pedophile State could be another K. Carter or C. Enis, not a sure bet from PSU.
I am not a Giants fan, but lets be real here. This video would not have been made if they were not 1-7. Not if they were like 3-5, this still would not have been made.
giants fan here... knew i was only a matter of time....
Tree, you got to do a video on Hollywood. That's a lolcow content for sure.
â€œA random running back no one has ever heard of.â€ Hey, Iâ€™ve heard of him before. He used to play at UNC. I loved watching Shaun Draughn play. That being said, he really hasnâ€™t done much in the NFL.
can you do a lolcow on the Detroit lion
Ben mcadoo need to be fired ASAP
As a fan of Big Blue, I can REALLY RELATE to this team
Great use of the cassette robot lol
Watching people shit on the Giants is actually kind of cathartic. Embrace the tank and hope Mara puts Macadoodoo's head on a pike in front of MetLife.

5 point vids!
"I like how you roped in a Giants fan to give his opinion on how much of a derp his team is. Maybe you can do more of this in future videos?

As for suggestions, if you are really game for a big one, how about the big commish himself? After a decade, his tenure has ""lolcow"" written all over it, and he's probably the biggest one in all of football, even bigger than the Browns in my opinion."
Broncos NFL's Snowy lolcow
Don't worry Giants fans, you have your 4 Super Bowl rings and you didn't pass on Carson Wentz.
As a giants fan I was waiting for this for so long
Where my Eagles fans at? #8-1
Ben McAdoo puts ketchup on rare steak.
Tom Coughlin is the only reason this team has won anything.
2 favorite football youtubers in 1 video!
Loved the collab. Been subbed to both of you for awhile now. Keep up the fantastic work!
urinating tree can you please roast the Miami dolphins because I'm done with them and maybe do the marlins to
At least spanos trade Eli to the Giants
FivePoints Vids!
I'm a Jets fan so I don't have to deal with the other New York team (even if the Jets Buttfumbles aren't that big of an upgrade at least we are no Giants)
Damn this is gonna hella shut up the Giants fans
Keep hope alive
Hey take your lumps
At least he didnt call us a lolcow...
That New England Phys Ed teacher joke is so true.
You finally made a video about one of my teams and I'm scared to watch
Well the Yankees and Knicks seem like theyâ€™re crawling out of the basement so itâ€™s only fitting that the Giants have to go back in
They still got the Yankees
Everyone should have seen this coming. They are the mecca of bad decisions. They paid WAY TOO MUCH for Jenkins and several other players and they've been the most unlucky team this year, losing pretty  much ever key player on offense...what little they have to start with. Its a Browns like dumpster fire.
Hey UrinatingTree, big fan. Wanna sub 4 sub?
yes
yes five point gaming and urinating tree in the same video less
Finally the day has come were my Giants get a video on this channel
The only ny team without a lolcow is not the rangy
I'll take derp-Ing to 2 titles. At least we're not the Browns.....or Bills.....or Chargers.....or Falcons.....anywua, you get what I'm saying
DRAFT LUKE FALK HE IS THE BEST IN COLLEGE FUCKING FOOTBALL
Derp. I should I have seen this video coming.
This.
As a chargers fan I'm glad we don't have this guy at QB.
how tf did that shit franchise beat the Pats twice?
All he needs now is excuses to rip into the NY Rangers and the NY Yankees and the Urinating Tree New York Circle of Mockery is complete
Fuck Aaron Rodgers.
G E N O S M I T H
Support me
Haha new england prep school! Lol
I will still wear my giants hat proudly
Haha FivePoints :)
How the fuck did this team beat undef. New england. Bullshit. Refs were bought
Giants and Mets fan... it's been painful.
God damnit i was so pissed when ben blamed eli manning for them being shit. Seriously he sounded like half the giants fanbase from 2012-2016
Derp!
Yeah, the Giants suck right now, but they're the only reason Pats fans aren't throwing seven Lombardi trophies in our faces right now instead of five.
Do the tampa bay buccaneers
"shoot eli apple" holy fuck my sides
Iâ€™ll stay a giants fan no matter what
In my opinion Saquon Barkley has 49ers written all over him
Itâ€™s all good the giants are one of if not the best NFL franchises ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸ definitely top 5
As a Patriots fan, I can't even describe the joy I feel looking at the Giants these days. Fuck you, Spanos!
I still don't know how Rodgers completed that pass to Cobb against the Giants last year ðŸ˜©
That Aaron Rodgers hail mary at the end of the video was icing on the cake
The Seattle Mariners: Professional Baseball's Shipwreck
when fivepoint vids started talking i nutted everywhere
Yeah I'll admit it, my Giants suck
I know you hate the steelers, but there is no way you can think that Odell Beckham is objectively less of a diva than Antonio Brown.  Like, really?  Odell Beckham IS the modern day measuring stick of divas.
You forgot to say fuck you spanos
as a giants fan im ready to watch this
I can't say I didn't see this coming.
"Who the fuck was that guy talking at the end pf the video? He fucking sucked. 

He better never appear in another video or I'm done. Disliked."
Do my cowboys next
How the fuck is Eli Manning overrated? Nobody thinks or says he's elite. Has anybody heard how he's talked about by NFL analysts. He's not overrated
#24  the 3rd and 33 didn't even try
OBJ is way more of a diva than AB.
You giants fans are really idiotic. "Fire him...fire that"...."draft him...sign him". After one loss it's like a meltdown and you want to restart the whole organization. You have no idea how to run a team.
I got so hyped when I heard my boy five points
From this Dolphins fan, Eli will forever be in my Hall of Fame. He saved the ONE thing we Phins fan have to brag about. The Perfect season. Thank u Eli for derping ur ass into 2 Super Bowl wins against   the bane of every football fans existence.  PS Tom Brady sucks ðŸ˜œ
lol I'm thank god im a New York sports fan except for football. Now I will cry myself to sleep cause I chose to support the fucking Dolphins
do a lolcow vid on the Bulls
The Derp Song!
Maybe the reason they're called the Giants is because management has their collective heads in the clouds.
Barkley going to SF
As a giants fan this was so funny esp the erick flowers dis and the 7th grade mcadoodoo reference all three fingers wow jpp
Do the bucs
RIP Roy Holliday. One of the greatest pitchers of our era, gone. Just like that. You wil be missed, old friend.
When you try to be the capitals in the playoffs..........
"Barkley sucks
If you watched the game today he only had 35 yards rushing and people says he is a heisman candidate this year"
Hehe Yankees are the kings now. Aaron Judge is the face of NY now, move over Odell
Fuck you Spanos
Ben McAdoo is like what happens if you let an uber fan of the Giants coach the team.
As a giants fan all I can do is sigh.
I am a Miami Dolphins fan and I to ask when are you going to do the Dolphins. I mean we never shut up about the perfect season. We haven't had a QB since Dan Marino. I am big Miami Dolphin fan but the Dolphins are a lolcow.
As a Giants fan, I knew this day was coming. I shall revel in it.
Do one on the Utah Jazz next
When you're such a fan of Urinating tree that you actually checked out his his shit to come across his guest BEFORE he put in his guest to talk shit bout a team that both HE AND the guest support.
I am a Giants fan and I loved this are team is complete shit

"I see a lot of parallels between the Giants of New York and the Giants of San Francisco.Â 
Both teams have periods where the stars aline and everything works out for them and the next year they run afoul of some demon and are cursed. Then they win a world title, lose their star player to injury, get a top player in the draft, and on and on the endless cycle goes. But unlike SanFran, these guys have a cross-eyed woodchuck throwing the ball for them."
Cincinnati Bungles: A Legacy of Failure.
And then he spoke about the team I support and I was all "Yay, we suck."
This is awesome
Giants need to clean house #Giantsnation
How is there not one of these for the Lions yet? I mean, I know it would be 5 hours but come on!
Giants suck suck suck
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ best vid ever
How is OBJ less of a diva than AB?
oh i've been waiting for this for a long time. i hate myself for being a fan of this team right now
OH HELL NO!! SAQUON BARKLEY WILL NOT GO TO THE GIANTS!  He might end up in San Francisco or end up in Cleveland
at least we beat the pats in the SB, TWICE
Not fuck you Spanos, fuck you mcadoo

Hey, we arenâ€™t the browns
This season/ video was like taking a road spike to the balls. At least Iâ€™m not a jets fan
At least we have 2007 and 2011
Do one on the Green Bay Packers
For the first time in a long time it looks like em Buffalo Bills will be your new NFL New York State champions. Congrats Buffalo you did it
But pekka rinne is to good right now...
Nelson achgolor over obj
Do the Flyers
KTO!
Giants sadness brings me joy
As an Eagles fan I've really been looking forward to thisðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
I'd take 2 superbowls that i can remember in exchange for a couple crappy seasons, they still have a strong core, they'll be back soon.
dilly dilly, to the pit of misery giants fans
Are you making a LA Clippers LOLCOW??
Please do the Bulls, Clippers, or Suns
Nothing like coming home from a 12 hour work day to watch a video from my fav youtuber pissingshrub
As a patriots fan I'm happy to say FUCK THE GIANTS
Worst than the 49ers!
2:14 UT, you slayed me yet again.
Please do something on the Mariners
The kicker forgot his wife wasn't a football.
I donâ€™t care who the running back is. No RB can do anything behind that o line
Do seahawks
Please make a video about the Packers
Fuck you Spanos.
As a Giants fan, I thank you for making this video
If only Aaron Judge played football too........
Could you do one with the Indians or the tigers
Finally you did my giants. #KnicksTape
A whole roast dedicated to the Giants
this video didnâ€™t make me feel to good about my team, but the Aaron Rodgers throw just made me feel that much worse

Hey UT, please do a Detroit Lions one, you'll have sub's dying from laughing at the shit storm they are
Fuck ny. Enjoy your shit season(S)ðŸ˜€
Their one win came from a team with a shitty coaching staff and no offense
No amount of Giants losing can quench my thirst. No amount of football misery can sate my hate for them.
Huge Giants fan here was waiting for you to make this for a long time. Its all accurate I am not looking forward to the next few years at all unless our offensive line magically becomes god tier.
Barkley won't be able to run if the o-line are traffic cones
As a redskins fan this relieves me but when is DC the legacy of choke dropping
I thought there is gonna be one "Fuck U Spanos" in this video
Nothing about this is Eli's fault.  Yeah, he's played sloppy at times, but literally everything is on his shoulders, and that's not the kind of quarterback he is.  He is someone who is a great piece to have with a team that's decent around him, who can definitely do his part but isn't good enough to carry the entire team.  Eli and a decent defense is all this team has anymore.
Do broncos "A Dumb load of shit"
Say what you will about the Giants, but they beat a perfect New England team in Super Bowl XLII; then again a few years later with just a 9-7 record.  It's not like they got intercepted on the 1 yard line in the 4th quarter with the game on the line, or gave up a 20+ point lead or anything.
Shitting on both Giants in one year? Your criticism spans both sides of the country.
Finally you made fun of us
Iâ€™ve waited a whole year for this
When will we get a legacy of failure on the entire city of Detroit?
is that KTO?
you know what ben's problem is,he's too busy trying to doodo in the poor children he's secretly raped mouths rather than trying to make his reputation less deplorable than chip kelly rich kotite combined
Tampa bay buccaneers: professional footballs sinking ship
Sigh
I want UT to rip the Blackhawks cause theyâ€™re sucking right now, but I donâ€™t know his qualifications to make a video ripping a team.
YES!
he said wife beater lmao, Lets not forget Josh Brown beat his wife and got suspended one game
Do a leagcy of failure UK Football, we lost Bear Bryant to Alabama because we wouldn't give him raise after winning a Championship and we've been medicore ever since
Iâ€™m a Giants fan and this is so fucking true Iâ€™m dying right now
5 points and Urinating tree in the same vid? Am I in heaven
When January comes around, I want the Post, The News, and/or Newsday to have the back cover simply say, "The Blue Wedding."
I find the timing of you dropping this video a little bit puzzling since the Giants are about to play the 0-9 49ers tomorrow. If the 49ers end up getting their first win against the Giants, that could have been something else you could use in a Giant lolcow video.
2 superbowls in the last decade
MMMMMMM this is like porn for cowboys fans :D
Yeah... four championship team you're mocking. Pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Nice try, UrinatingTree.
ELI APPLe is good! He's been guarding the best WRs pretty well so far
You haven't riffed my team the Broncos yet... They're having a Lolcow season right now. Even lost badly to the dumpster fire Giants.
4:44 ahahahahaha i fucking love that movie its so funny
Hahaha don't worry New York at least we have the Rangers!!!!!!
As a Giants fan, this was hilarious. You have a great channel. Just looking forward to the draft now.
You know itâ€™s bad when your kicker is a wife beater ðŸ˜‚
Damn I thought my giants were off the hook cuz of injurys rip
Omg he listened to my comment
Do the Fucking Penguins Pharisee
Oh a Giants video. I was afraid of this. Please excuse me as I slit my wrist
I liked the vid before even watching it. It was worth it. Now all u need is Dallas lolcow vid.
The 19 people that disliked this video are the 19 remaining giants fans left after this atrocious year.
Hey, at least Evan Engram looks promising
Giants may suck now but eagles still got no rings
Please save us
I want a lolcow/garbage fire for the Whitesox.
This is literally revenge from the Pats losing to Super Bowl 42 10 years ago. Iâ€™m weeping tears of joy from your video. As always FUCK YOU SPANOS!
The 9ers will beat them tomorrow ahahahahahahaah
They need Landry Jones as there QB
Do the Broncos!!!
"This man is a pair of sweatpants and a wife beater away from being a 7th grade Phys Ed teacher at a New England prep school." HOW does he come up with these analogies?
Odell is the diva of divas.
Make a Dolphins lolcow. I sacrificed my Sundays to watch this team fail. :)
I'm not feeling sorry for him. After two lucky catches that robbed Tom Brady, I have no more sympathy.
Somehow I knew this was coming. My team soiled
It hurts to be a giants fan.
You know it's a bad day when urinating tree posts a video.. and your favourite team is in the thumbnail
Iï¸ was waiting for this video, FUCK MACADOO
"as a giants fan.Â 

thank you for making me even more sad. after not knowing we could've had Todd gurley but fucking drafted erect flowers.

But I still love your videos."
Regardless of the content of the specific poem, I don't know if Rudyard Kipling, author of "The White Man's Burden," is the best poet to motivate a contemporary NFL football team.
Fuck you, Spanos.
do colts lolcow or nl east lolcow division
Iâ€™m a giants fan and Iâ€™ll even admit this is a horrible team, at least I got my other favorite team the chiefs.... what they lost to the cowboys? Well then
I feel bad for the Giants. From a Dolphins fan
Do the Broncos. They've earned it tree.
At some point I expect my Packers getting a video. Might hurt lol but I'll be good as long as Ted Thompson and Dom Capers are fully roasted.
Can you guys more videos on the nba
What a turn of events bills an jets shitting on the giants who were super bowl champions
Do the Lions next
This channel needs more subscribers
I love both tree and five points so much. Good to see them work together
I'm thinking you do a Legacy of Failure on the Texans of Houston
Football Gods punished the Giants after OBJ's actions by taking out their WR unit
You gotta do the bucs, especially with how they were made out to be one of the better teams of the league this year and have just been a rotting steamy loaf this whole season
I fucking hate Eli so much. Also fuck YOU SPANOS
They suck at drafting! Except for Landon Collins and OBJ...
As a giants fan this made me laugh and cry at the same time, sad but true.
Is that five point games
Honestly, we've got a chance next season. I'm not going to start being a pessimist just because of a bad season. Just cuz our players had a boat party doesn't mean we're an incompetent organization compared to the other teams in our division.
I'm from Connecticut but I laughed about the prep school joke
Derp derpie Derp Derp Derp
I've been waiting this video for a long time (Coming from a diehard Giants fan)
Five Point Vids and UrinatingTree, my life is now complete, Iâ€™m ready to pass on now.
As a Giants fan I have been waiting for this video. I honestly hate this team. 2 Superbowls don't mean shit if you can't become a perennial contender and miss the playoffs every year after. They fore Coughlin but then keep the front office intact and promote the fuckboi McAdoo to be the head coach. If not for the browns I'd say they have the worst front office in all of football. Eli Manning is hugely overrated by giants fans because he managed to beat the Pats twice in the Superbowl. It's not saying much tho besides YA Tittle and Fran Tarkenton the Giants never really had a good QB. And he might be talented, but I hate Odell Beckham. HE has such a shitty attitude he makes it impossible to like him. I stopped watching this team about a month ago, I don't think I am missing anything by not watching them.
I was there for the game in your thumbnail
As a Giants fan, I am embarrassed by this season. This is NOT the same team I saw in the Super Bowl back in 2012. Absolutely pathetic.
Fuck you Spanos
Is that kto?
Fuck Ben Mcapoo
7-Jan
Iâ€™m a giants fan. Now hand me the Lâ€™s of sorrow.
Yo tree go check out TPS's last war video currently, there's an entire thread just making your references and jokes. Your on the rise my friend!
This video makes me realize that my giants will probably suck for at least 10 years
Ben McAdoo? More like Ben Derp-Dee-Doo, amirite? ;)
This video was VERRRRY satisfying. Thank you, Tree.
364th.
fire mcadoo
Please do the sharks for the love of us all
"FINALLY, a lolcow video on my Giants. I've been waiting for it for two months now.

Loved everything you said in the video, and could relate to the poor Giants fan. Only two things though:

1: I'm surprised you didn't flame Jackrabbit and how goddamn overrated he is. The guy is basically a clone of Eli Crapple. Hasn't made one good play since the preseason.

2: Since when did the Giants have a 'vaunted offensive line'?"
Basically New Yorkers should only watch baseball and hockey to avoid misery lmao
ben macadoo probably looks up how to beat your wife instead of play calling
YEEEEESSSS
Stay in yo cell
LMFAO
18-1 bitch
As a Giants fan, donâ€™t draft anything else except A LEFT FUCKING TACKLE
Still tho I'm hoping for a Giants win against the 49'ers so we can have 2 0-16 teams this year
Fuck you spanos! From sunny San Diego
YES! YESSSSSSSS! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Ben McAdoo: the most successful pedophile ever
Chiefs next?
"pauses

Gets into the fetal position to prepare

Resumes"
I never expected the New York Giants were going downhill after being Super Bowl contender to becoming a Derp fest on the field.
Shitton of holding on the helmet catch.  But at least Pete Carrol fucked up and Atlanta imploded so I guess it evens out.
No fuck you Spanos ?? Who are you and what did you do to UT ??
the giants are also very inconsistent, they switch between good, decent, bad, and awful with the jets every year. i love it, also fuck you spanos
Yesssss
I mean eli has thrown for 1820 yards 12 tds and 6 ints. That's better than most starters in the leauge. He isn't the problem this year.
FUCK YOU MARA
as a eagles fan thank you for posting this
UT & FP Vids, name a better duo
j-e-t-s
This is why if you are a Pats fan in NY you are ALWAYS called a bandwagoner
i was waitn g
Donâ€™t trust comments that are edited
Geno
This is great
Yessss... YES!
1 like=1 prayer for this Giants fan ðŸ˜­
Thank god I have the Rangers and Yankees. This season has been a complete dumpster fire
As a giants fan Iï¸ really needed this
"Oh god, this is going to suck so much.

Update: THIS hurt more than watching that FG. Again."
Your friend is not as charismatic as you are, UT. Also, I needed to jack up the volume to hear anything that he said.
do one for the la chagers
Still more successful than the Jets
"So I like the Giants, Mets, Islanders, and Knicks.

At least the Knicks don't all the way suck. For now."
I'm glad you weren't like every mindless Eli hater saying HURR DURR ITS ALL ELI'S FAULT LETS TRADE HIM AND A 7TH FOR AARON RODGERS
Game of the year this weekend: Giants vs. 49ers.
jerry reese is the premiere lolcow of nfl gm's.
That was fucking hilarious. Thank you for that it greatly needed.
Not even one clip of mr derp from South Park? Just disappointing, Tree.
I've been waiting for this collaborationðŸ˜‚
Hello? Do you not notice that this team has 4 Super Bowls, and that Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP?
This is the best day of my life. Never thought urinating tree would make a video of my team
Cowboys fan here. This was beautiful
Still not as derpy as the San Diego, oh oh my bad LOS ANGELES chargers
"Um." - ben mcadoo
I'm a Giants fan and this is the truest video i've seen
At least Manning has two rings...unlike my Eagles... sobs, then looks at the current Giants and Eagles records Much better...
You made a Giants lolcow video and didn't mention the miracle at the meadowlands??? Not 1 or 2??? Wow...
Fuck you Spanos
Three NFC East teams now. As a Cowboys fan, Iâ€™m nervous for when our video comes out, but i love watching our rivals get shit on. Donâ€™t worry, I know weâ€™re Pro Footballâ€™s Outlaw.
I didn't even know Geno Smith was in the league lol
"Somehow i feel, deep down...







This is all Dean Spanos' fault"
Lolcow much
Grab some popcorn  Eagles, Redskins, and fellow Cowboys fans ðŸ¿
No Detroit Lions video yet but at least we get a good surprise courtesy of the NY football derp Giants.
This is your BEST work yet.....and im a Pats fan
Tom coughlin is the most underrated head coach of all time
I'm a simple man. I see UrinatingTree, I beat the fuck out of my dick so goddamn hard that I can't even feel my left leg.
"Five Points & Urinating Tree...
Now that's a sports show that could go places!"
Pc principal from south park

Great collab guys! Loved it! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ™ŒðŸ’ª

It could be worse for them. At least they've won 4 super bowls as a franchise haha. Not that that helps the mess of a team they have right now...
Handley never won 11 games in a  season McaDoo at least did that. This season may make me a Jet fan. Nah not hat bad.
Do the calgary flames legacy of dissapointment
Welp, now who is gonna be the next lowcow?
Fuck you Kroenke
Oh boy my team, here we go
"One day there will be a Patriots lolcow...

and that day will be a good day."
Do a this week in basketball from now on urinatingtree.
"Ben McAdoo blaming Eli Manning?

He's the one keeping them from becoming the Browns."
as a Giants fan, seeing this makes my body shiver out of anger.
Fucking finally
Oh God, the pain is unbearable.
The only accurate game of thrones scene that accurately depicts the Giants' season is the end of hound vs viper.
With the first pick in the NFL draft the gaints select Josh Rosen quarterback UCLA
So a team with No O-line, a horrible rushing game, All the good WR's are injured, and a completley overrated defense, how do we fix this you ask? Draft a new quarterback and replace Eli, he's the reason we are terrible this year! I mean no, I'm a ravens fan (that hasn't been that fun this year either) but even I can tell getting a quarterback is the LAST thing the fucking giant's need right now. Fix that O-line and if your lucky (meaning if you tank hard enough), Barkley will fall into your hands, and just tough it out with one more year of Eli.
The derp sound effect should be my new text alert ringtone
"Suggestions for next videos:
Tennessee titans 
Arizona cardinals
LA Rams
Detroit Lions 
Chicago Bulls
Detroit pistons
Orlando Magic 
That's about all I can think of hope you see this"
From what Iâ€™ve seen, theyâ€™re about to call an article 15 on mccadoo
Five points gaming + Urinating Tree + Me getting plastered on Veterans Day = Pure gold
As a Jets fan I'm loving this
"I'm convinced Eli has the 2 rings because life figured it was the best way to spite Peyton.

Fuck you Spanos."
Ummm Barkley is from Penn State, HAS ANYONE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM DRAFTING FROM PENN STATE!?
Do the Texans
I wonder if this guy is going to run out of teams to talk about
As a Giants fan I can only agree
How long until McAdoo gets fired? Taking all bets!
Where were you when their entire receiving corps was kill

As a giants fan this was hilarious as usual and thanks for acknowledging Collins is a stud
"YEEEEESSSS
As a Giants fan I have been waiting for this for eons..."
As a eagles fan, this give me joy.
I dreaded the day this video would come but I knew it would, justing adding another bullet to the chamber to a game of giant's fan suicide roulette
I watch these to feel better about my Bengals
5 point gaming and urinating treeðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’ðŸ–’

Lol
OH HEY IT'S ERIC FLOWERS!
They even got defeated by the Chargers. Fuck you, Spanos.
Eli Manning looks like a homeless Goomba
YES I LOVE THESE VIDEOS BRUH.
I knew this video was coming. As a Patriots fan a must say... thank god this derp era exists. Now we just need Giants fans to realize those 2 superbowls from 7 and 10 years ago don't mean much anymore.
As a giants fan I will say the accuracy in this video along with the humor is great. My g-men are shit this year and likely to continue to be shit for years to come.
Do a Chicago Bulls Lolcow video!!!
the giants bad season is due to macadoo
This hurt like a kick to the crotch.. and to end it with Buckâ€™s fake excitement at the end just more painful
I know it has nothing to do with LA but I have to say, FUCK YOU SPANOS!
Why does Ben McAdoo look like the PC Principal from South Park ?
Been waiting for FPV to make an appearance
As a Giants Fan ive been waiting for this
And you S T I L L have not done those pussy cats (lions)
"anyone remember that chubby dude that said Odell doesn't contribute towards the team

Im a giants fan and i find this funny and true af
51-17 to La Rams really
Somehow my saving grace this year is the god damn New Jersey Devils
great video
"Sees UT video
Looks at rope

Not today, friend. Not today."
Leave my giants alone tree I canâ€™t handle the truth ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I know we suk
I think the Giants will finish last in the NFC this year.
I think that after this video I will just be a Rams fan #goff=ðŸ
New York and sports. Same old same old
its his fuckin acumen, kid
Mcadoodle doo sucks big fat veiny elephant cock
What is great about UT is that he hates everyone equally.
As a Giants fan, we were fucking due for this treatment after the season we've been having.
THE FUCKING PENGUINS.
lolcow should be a adjective
fuck you Spanos
as a giants fan i truly appreciate this
derp
It pains me to say it but do the Houston Texans
As a Giants fan this hurts
I only take comfort in those 2 super bowl wins years ago and that this horrible season doesn't fall on Eli when previous bad seasons did or usually does for a QB.
Derp
God damn it I knew this was coming...
My question is how did it take so long. It took so long for them to be bad they used to win with like the same team
They need to sign pekka rinne
As a giants fan. I wanna cry. I love u tho
How can you make a Giants Derp video without including DJax's Punt Return "Miracle at the Meadowlands 2"? Cmonnnn
18 likes and 2 views YouTube you're high
"No wonder my family are fans of Division rivals.
Maybe we'll win the NFC East if Romo or Cousins somehow derp harder than Eli Manning and lose a couple games in a row.
Although, I already knew we were screwed once Odell got hurt, so...
This is what I expected. P.S., we'll probably be in the basement once Eli is gone and Odell gets sent to a real team because tanking."
This video was MADE for five points, I wouldnâ€™t be mad if just narrated the whole video ðŸ¤£
5 points vids has a good ass channel. Good to see him with Tree.
We need a lolcow video on the most lolcow teams, Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Mariners and the LA Clippers those teams are the meaning of Lolcow
"First




Dislike"
The Rangers are due for a Legacy of failure. 1994 was 23 years ago.
Doesn't even hurt that bad because I can always watch those two championship DVDs of the Giants beating the Patriots. You're welcome, everyone.
Could you do a video on individiuals? The Zeke Elliott saga would make an awesome video!
I was anticipating this video. Go Giants!
All we need is the Cowboys and he did the entire NFC East under 2 years.
Please make an Arizona Cardinals lolcow vid. Thanks. They haven;t accomplished much throughout their 120-year existence.
Who's the biggest derp on this Giants team? My answer would be Ben McAdoo. Eli Manning is a very close second.
At least they are having a better season than the 49ers lmao XD
The derp is just too good right now.
As a Giants fan let's just sign pekka rinne and the whole preds defense to be our o line- they "find new and unique ways to kill you" right
Please do the Arizona Cardinals next
It was worth getting off my cristian   minecraft server for this
Welp, I Guess its time for our anal pounding
I live in NY and almost all my friends have been Giants fans for years and whenever I joke around about the Giants they always tell me how they were never Giants fans and were always Bills fans lmao
I knew this was coming eventually and here it is
Flyers please?
Tank for O-line and kill Everyone who isn't a player, Spags, or Mara.
cant wait until macadoo gets a horseshoe dildo shoved up his ass on the way out of town
As a Die Hard eagles fan I love this.

41 seconds ago? Last time I was this early, the Giants were upsetting the Patriots
You know itâ€™s a good day when Urinating Tree uploads a video.
YES
As a jets fan surrounded by giants fans I thank u unrinating tree
Atleast I got the Yankees and Knicks to hold me over for the moment
Jeffrey Loria or Marlins next
omg i am so early :O
2nd
Warning: derp alert
Sad..... but I'm a saints fan lol
These videos are so so good. Glad I found your channel
WHO DEY!
Is that really five point vids??
Seahawks fan here, weve had issues also. BUT!!!! We have Michael Dickson!! Our punter is iffy though
Damn I miss Phil Dawson
i always thought flemro was really short
Real brown is the Baltimore raven the now is the replacement brown LOL but it true
Us kickers are the are the best
Why does everyone hate on Cincinnati
The best kicker EVER https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morten_Andersen The "Great Dane".
You could easily make a series on crazy kicks. Each episode with a story. Of the top of my head, the New Orleans missed XP, the Eagles recordbreaking 60+yards last year, FG and XP returns, fake FG (has there been any?), and on and on and on...
I am Utah's token Browns Fan! See you at the Denver Saturday Game?
I was completely intrigued by that video! Great job buddy.
Rodrigo Blankenship is incredible. I hope he goes on to be as good in the Pros as he is right now.
My dad was at that packers vs bears game where the kicker ran it in
Well Iâ€™m here to waste my time but this truly took the cake
That fat kid on tiktok is a fat ass
What about Tom Dempsey? Man kicked with his right foot, which he only had HALF OF. He still holds one of the longest FG attempts in game, which he made. Again, with half a foot!
2:05 no pads? and why does he have what looks to be a cameltoe
"Imagine being a Bills fan...we lost a Super Bowl because of a missed kick. 

Still waiting....

Maybe by 2050."
gb packers best team dont argue
the cowboys probably gifted seatgeek the tour facility, practice field time, and box. so in effect they're rewarding the scalpers of their own tickets. gotta love it. they even swindle taxpayers to build stadiums. great video btw.
Garo Yepremian ...1971 Dolphins kicker ...comedic gold
Viniterri running down Herschel Walker...hilarious
I reckon  the  Grammatica brothers were high on something when they used to kick.  They were crazy,  we'll at least one of them was,  Martin right?!
How do you not have 1M subs? Thatâ€™s my only question... ðŸ˜‚
Kickers might have bad days because someone else is doing something wrong. I mean, the ball might not be held properly by the person who holds the ball for the kicker, and that would affect the kick. Also, Charlie Brown can tell you that you can't kick a ball that's yanked away from you.
â€œPretend to be a bears fan.â€ But I hate the stupid team. Theyâ€™re not even good. From, the biggest football fan in the universe.
Lol, now Adam V is the all-time leading scorer ðŸ˜‚
#BringBackDawson
Go Browns!
Raelly gary andreson had to miss that kick
Yes my favorite team vikings kicker bad
Kickers literally have one job
funny an undafted kicker is the nfls all time points leader adam vinitari
You want to make the kicking game fun.  Make all kickers use the straight on style. I still have my toe kicking shoe if needed.  I t took 30 years for the soccer style kicker to break my high school records.
HOT ROD, RESPECT THE SPECS!!!!!!!!
As a Dawg fan... Herschel and Hot Rod are my favoritesðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
bengals trash excuse you?
Love ya kto but you canâ€™t be calling the bengals trash like that
It felt like you were building up to a point the whole video and then it just ended. Maybe Iâ€™ll have to watch it again, by this video felt like a book with a beginning and middle but no end.
Hey man, don't be so sad. Our old kicker back at Minnesota lost us the Packers game. You're not alone. Yet somehow, this dude is making 60 yard field goals in my Madden franchise, no joke.
RIP Morten Anderson is the all-time leading scorer statistics
Bye bye browns Head coach and OC...
Ohhh yeah  BULLDOGS
Lol, Vinarteri is all time point scorer now.
im an Alabama fan an its nice having a great offence/defence but everytime our field goal unit comes out i get nerves.
PRESURE IS THE NAME OF THEIR GAME ...not the same to hit bullseye ina bar when nothing is on the line , and no one caresÂ  ... than to do it when there are millions of dollars at stake and the world is watching
Ayyeee Iâ€™m a browns fan
4:20 now vinatieri is the leading scorer #goat
LMAO that Green Bay kicker railed some white lightning and was like "F*CK, F*CK, F*CK" and scored
There are still Browns fans? Wow, they really suck
Is five point vids a ravens fan. Because Tree is a Steelers fan. Flemlo is a bungled fan. KTO is a browns fan. Youâ€™ve got the AFC north as the 4 best sports YouTubers.
"â€œImagine being a bears fanâ€ 
sheds tear â€œI donâ€™t have to imagineâ€"
Rodrigo Blankenship gets the loudest cheers during the lineups at UGA
Man I miss Phil Dawson
Was the all time points leader
then i might as well be a kicker for denver
Adam just beat the overall points!
Great vid. Keep it up.
Yo I'm a bears fan
hotrod is the man
I miss Phil Dawson.
fuck seatgeek and ticketmaster and all the others
I love Adam Vinatieri
Makes me miss Phil Dawson. Smh
Please what is that song from the end
I live in south dakota and Adam vineteri and brock lesnar inspire me to try
If someone knows beat when he shows the dawson field goal let me know
I saw that â€œbengalsâ€ trash Iâ€™m a bengals fan so try me lol
Ironic Iâ€™m watching this as the browns new kicker missed a fg and PAT against the Steelers
Watching Steelers versus browns right now and write has to is watching this video of the brown making the kick the Browns just made field goal
Why are Qb's and the kickers the most scrawny?
Cleveland native, life-long browns fan here. I remember watching that game with my folks. Things got crazy in my house lol. WOOF WOOF
Weâ€™re you playing with big dick jezzer
kickers are wierd
Browns are trash foh
Nice to see this guy finally getting the views he deserves
Blair walsh
Finally, someone who tells the outcome of the game for people who donâ€™t know. Subbed.
5:06 who is that?
"Gonzales has missed to the left
Has missed to the right 
He even has missed thru the middle"
"A Rugby Fly-Half watching Football kickers....

This might be interesting...."
One of your best vids yet brother. Keep em coming!
The Browns. The emblem on the field is a Brown helmet. They suck and are a shit team called the Browns. When you go to take a shit you're bringing the Brown's to the Super Bowl. Change the fucking name already and maybe they might actually have a record better then 3-13.
Hey Iâ€™ve been a fan for 4 months now Iâ€™d love to see a collaboration with you and flemlo you went to the game with him Iâ€™m also a fan of his and I think you guys could make some really good collaborations
so the moral of the story is: ZANE GONZALEZ SUCKS
ZI am a Browns fan and I like baker.
okay so i was 9 when the ravens browns game happened at the end of this video and i was also there in the stadium "Ravens fan" and they said it was no goood and the announcer told everyone to drive safe and have a nice evening. half the stadium was gone by the time they decided it was good and to send it to overtime. i was so pissed and heart broken lol.
Why didn't browns renew Phil Dawson's contract ðŸ˜£
I'm a browns fan to
Mmg did all this
Your channel makes my lazy Saturdays at college worth it. Your content is among the best I've seen. Thank you, sir.
College football has more action because they want to make the leagues.
You went back to the 80s, but you should've gone one more decade for Tom Dempsey. I mean he kicked a 63-yarder and the dude only had half a foot.
Bengal trash what
RIpping on them physically?  Look at most kicker's bios they were generally star position players in high school on top of basketball/baseball/track.  Adam Vinatari was a stud in high school as a QB, Middle Backer, and other sports. Plus how can there not be 32 competent kickers?  Ok, how can there not be 32 competent QBs?
Those were missed intentionally lol
5:13 I actually am a bears fan
Urinating tree was there!
Bro idk why but you sound like mr nightmare
Man I'm from sweden and while american football isnt a big sport here I watch all of the highlight reels. Stumbled across this video and I gotta say you have an amazing storytelling capability! You keep it so interesting for the viewers to watch these different videos since you are cunning and have amazing production value.
Seatgeek is giving us tons of free shit to lure people to their site. Fuck off dude. You dumb as shit?
Chargers had that Korean kid that missed everything.  Where is he now?
Just subscribed I'm a Browns fan to
FLEMORAPS!!!!
"â€œKickers on Cocaineâ€





Heh, Cocaines a helluva drug"
Zane Gonzales played with a torn groin against the Saints. This information was just released
I'm with flemlo Bengals 4 lif
WE CANT HELP IT WE HAVE TO WEAR SPORTS GOGGLESðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
When it hits the crossbar for me in Madden 18, it's good.
F'ing awesome video, well done sir.
And CAN YOU KICK A FOOTBALL?
Kickers have by far the most points ever scored.
Rob Bironas. 60 yards. Never forget.
0:50 fite me boi
Glad we got rid of Zane Gonzalez
They get paid a bunch of money to kick a ball then chill and enjoy a front row seat of nfl games lol
Being a ex semi pro âš½ football player, I'm pretty confident that I could kick one of your eggs the entire length of the field...
TO BROWN'S
"So THATS what the urinating tree looks like 
I know he already did a face reveal but the quality was shit"
SodakðŸ’
just get mayfield out there to do a drop kick
Iâ€™m a ravens fan too lmaoðŸ˜‚
Rodrigo Blankenship is the best kicker in all of college football
Browns have 8 championships, they will return to glory soon with or without a good kicker.
Blair Walsh and Nick Folk are straight ass. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Zayne Gonzalez! Put yo motherfuckin head back down you god damn BUM!!! - Chiseled Adonis
Skol browns
Who dat!
Iâ€™m a ravens fan and Iâ€™m gonna be honest that lost to the Browns wasnâ€™t that bad that was a hell of a game and suspenseful as fuck rip Justin Tuckerâ€™s perfect extra point record lol
Surprised you didn't put anything about ganos 63 yarder
Itâ€™s not easy kicking a football. Itâ€™s not easy kicking a ball in general. The main point of kicking a ball is aiming at. You have to hit the ball in certain spots in order to go the direction you want to go. Ask soccer players. If you want to shoot  for a goal in a far distance, You need to aim and kick it in a certain spot of the ball. Thatâ€™s because all ball textures all have a certain ways that balls move. A plain âš½ï¸ soccer ball has all those octagon line shapes because it causes the ball to spin in clockwise motion. Thatâ€™s why you can sometimes see a soccer ball curve while itâ€™s in the air. As for a football ðŸˆ . Itâ€™s main creation was for it to be throw. Itâ€™s egg shaped. ðŸ¥š. When QBs throws the football, it in the air, the ball is in a spiraling motion. When it comes to kicking the ball, that egg shaped ball can be really hard to aim for a kicker. It gets worse if the weathers not on your side. Sure, Field goals and extra points are made most of the time, but itâ€™s not easy kicking a football. Try it yourself. Warning though, they give you blisters
NICK ELLIOT.................google that scumbag. kicker for kc chiefs......
Phil Dawson was a beast and I was pissed when our Browns let him go..
I'm glad you brought up that Dawson kick. I remember watching that game live. Ray Lewis & the Ravens were pissed off that they play could even be reviewed. They ran into the lockerrooms thinking they had won the game.
Ravens just experienced the bad parts of kicking from their veteran.
I was at game 1, browns vs steelers... people left after we were down 7-21. They missed such a good game but it ended so annoyingly. We did get lucky when the steelers missed their FG but def should've won (that being said it was pooring down rain, but no excuses for week 2 for Gonzalez)
Cocaine is kicker juice
first of all your seats are the most perfect seats in all of Texas like I didn't think they came that visually appealing if I win the lottery first thing im doing is buying lifetime tickets to that suite
That opening photo...that was the Mount Rushmore of sports Youtubers. Stung a lil bit when I saw the shirts, though
Footballs such a weird sport because of the specifics with each position. Yeah other major sports have variations in positions, but itâ€™s not like the difference between being a linebacker or a place holder haha
Tom Dempsey setting a record that stood for years (62 yards) with half a foot should be in this video
Kickers are so underrated just look up for the KC vs NE game no one talk about Gostkowski, he was perfect in the game with long FG and no one gave him the credit he deserves
Everyone is somewhat fit and then there is Tree.
You think your kicking just this season is bad Iâ€™m a Vikings fan and we can never kick ðŸ˜‚
3:53 "WHAT IS UP DRAMA ALERT NATION!"
You should do a video on the CAFL also known as the China Arena Football League, when I was in China just recently it seemed like a big deal.
Browns to the super bowl this year
Do the best NFL teams with a terrible quarterback
No one is wierder than Harmon.
Whats the name of that fancy tune in the outro ?
3:55 well that stat is kinda depressing dont ya think
Blankenship a beast go dawgs
MMG was at that seat geek thing
A lot of Kickers are sorry asf and only the Cowboys old kicker was Beast
I had club feet when I was born, there is less than 200,000 cases each year. Yes that is a big sum, but out of 7 billion people on the Earth this is a very rare case. Though because of the way my toes are shifted and slightly twisted I am a better kicker.
please do a video on last chance u players
I like the Georgia kickerðŸ˜Ž
Finna drop the browns in the super bowl
when you mentioned bad kickers you forgot kyle bambard
Stephen gostkowski few years back omg. 50/50 weather he would make it.
Wait WHAT ? cleavland has a football team last I heard they moved and haven't been seen on a score board since
Liked solely for rodrigo Blankenship in the thumbnail lmaoo
Hey KTO could you do a video on the 2016 Penn state football team and how they rallied from 2-2 to the rose bowl
What's the song at 9:00?
Kickers on cocaine. Murica
Iâ€™m a Vikings fan.  Iâ€™ve had to deal with some of the worst chokes in nfl history
Did you see mmg
You can hear the amount of anger ravens fans were feeling. The stadium just entirely erupted XD
I hope you remember me been here since 25k
As someone who has marched on the cowboys field for band and am doing so again this year. The stadium sucks. The seats are jist plastic and the fieild was smaller than it should be. Not really sure why
Justin tucker.
Do tua tagovailoa next
Us vikings fans also hated Blair walsh
"Marvel: Infinity War is the biggest crossover ever.
SeatGeek: Hold my beer"
Hey KTO could do a video on the rams this season or the huskers and the rebuild?
Donâ€™t let this change your mind from the fact they lost every game last year
Don't start sentences with "so".
The only players that use their FOOT in American FOOTball.
I was at the cowboys and lions game
Suites are the best. I went to the vikings preseason game and it was so fun!
What about the saints kicker with half a foot
Not as bad as aguayo
Blair Walsh?
Wtf why wasnâ€™t EDP445 there for the flag football gameðŸ˜‚
0:49 what makes this ok to say, I'm insalted, and your name just got on the List-who ever the F you are, putting a bengals fan out like that, your a coward, I'm calling your Comment Random and inflamatory, i would suspend you over this. make a mental note your Welcome in cincinnati , please come visit us, remember we dont want to visit the Puppy Farm
#steelersnation
You could have titled this browns kicking montage ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I'm a browns fan myself and I just got to say that I havent felt safe with a kicker since we had Phil Dawson
Has any team tried using a soccer player to be a kicker? It would be interesting to see how they would play
You should make a video on the past 10 heisman trophy winners and where they are now
Mmg was there
Love how you gotta a shot of Hot Rod... GoDawgs
My boy rodrigo
My dad actually coached mar Mosleyâ€™s son in football and is good friends with him me and my family have been to his mansion and farm
Blair Walsh has is the worst kicker donâ€™t at me
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAjQiRsdMCtBJUwCz4N02w
"KTO: imagine if you are a bears fan 

Me: I am a bears fan...."
Iâ€™m a browns fan too, and Gonzales makes me want to cry. He legit lost us two easy games.
what if vick never got arrested
Rodrigo is my favorite kicker of all time ðŸðŸðŸ
What's the song at the end of the video
4:38 why is this dudes feet so long and skinny wtf
What about eagles vs. giants last year. 63 yards?
You should do a video of Jimmy Weirick who was a god at North football and won offensive player of the year for Ohio as well as qb of the year
MMG was there at that flag football game
Heartbreakingly bad kickers? One name: Scott Norwood.
"not sure if this has been done before but..
what if drew bledsoe never got hurt ?"
Iâ€™m a saints fan and I remember laughing at the end
Hi Hi hi hi hi Pin pin pin
man whats that song
Walsh,Carlson,and forbaith all suck but still SKOL VIKINGS
How can you say the bengals are trash when they are better than the Browns by a mile. Baker is trash
VENEZUELAN COCK SLUTS.....
Now that was an entertaining video!
Lol I caught your rag saying flemlo is Bengals trash. Ouch! Love both of y'alls content. Keep up the food work!
I wonder who the browns fans hate the worse among the AFC north division
So this video was a let down. We didn't learn about any odd behavior of kickers. The point of the video.
I Subbed because you said you were a browns fan my favorite player is nick chubb
the browns legend! mr phil dawson! love that dude. the browns won alot of games bc of that guy
wait are you from ohio and a rams fan? wth so am i!!! lol i doubt you are but thats awesome. im sorry to hear your a browns fan... ive watched my dad go through depressing times over the last 20 years..
kicking so much more complex than just kicking the ball, if any part of the operation(snapper, kicker, and holder) makes a mistake it compounds. and in the pros if the ball isn't kicked 1.5ish seconds after its snapped, its probably gonna get blocked because of the disadvantage the line is put at and a man that can likely run a 4.4 coming off the edge. people take the efficiency of kickers today for granted, the margin of error that a kicking play can have and still go well is slim and kickers still can keep 90% accuracy with all those variables is impressive.
Poor Cleveland Browns
Make a video about a great linemen
Kto's a browns fan like me
Wow SDSU... It's not very often you see good guys from FCS teams. Carson Wentz was just a very big coincidence... Ugh of only there were more griz in the NFL.
Talk about the 1982 nfl season with the player strike and the special edition 16 team playoffs!!!?? ðŸ”¥
As a Georgia fan rodrigo is my man
yes. yes we are
My cousin is a kicker and is good friends with the QB
I love how ur vids end bro â¤ï¸â¤ï¸
Rdcworld1 was there
9:00 song?
Cocaine is one hec* of a drug
"I'm just happy Justin Tucker is my kicker.






For now..."
"I am a bears fan this pisses me off
At least he got cut"
Why did he cover it up at the beginning.
Browns fans RIP I like the browns RIP me
Same happened with Randy Bullock while with the Texans. Highly promised kicker in college, bust in the NFL
go dalliscoboys
Urinating Tree is the image of Yinzerdom he could be my neighbor (I mean this in the most positive way possible)
Believe it or not Some Teams their Kickers are the all time high in points scored.
Do a what if the Packers took Barry Sanders instead of Tony Mandrch!!!
will you do a video on what happened to tavon austin?????
Falcons #1 kicker lol our best player got hurt matt bryant
I think the number 2 is cursed for the browns
Who-Dey
The number 2 is cursed for the browns
Imagine being a bills fan. Lost the super bowl bcuz of a kick
I'm a die hard UGA fan and Hot rod is a God and Herschel is even more
Everyone is a Browns fan deep down inside.
Adam is a god
Do a video about the Redskins superbowl bound replacements in 1979
Harmon from Blue Mountain State
5:12. I'm a bears fan. And if you include that clip one more time. I'm never ever watching another one of your vids again. This is your 1 and only warning
How about this for a crazy field goal. I think it was Robbie Gould, though it could have been Paul Edinger, but there was a time when the ball hit all 3 bars and went through. It hit the right upright first, then the left upright about halfway down, and finally it bumped the crossbar on it's way down. It went through but it was that crazy kind of event that had you thinking wtf.
Same thing with hockey goalies
he said â€œimagine to be a bears fanâ€... first time iâ€™ve ever heard that come from a browns fan LMAO
justin tucker ????????????
That is my my uncle
Hey kto I saw a 27 yard line theory for the Skol clan I saw it on nfl network please do a video on that
Troydan gaming was there
Papa Meages was there
Why does the vikings somehow always fuck it up
They Might be weird! But the game is still rigged ðŸ˜ Just Like the NBA
Best football channel on YouTube.
1:00 Thank me later.
Nice vid
"""98 NFC championship game"" - slam your fist onto any flat surface whilst saying ""damn"" 

hopefully someone will understand where this is from."
Kickers are actually goats
Just found your channel browns fans for life man. There gonna beat the bucs. GO BROWNS!!!
The browns suck
wasnt zane gonsalez injured in the pelvic area when he did those kicks?
Fuck the Shitty Browns, Ravens Nation yâ€™all getting that ass dusted when yâ€™all come to Bmore
Browns are my home team.... but they suck
I'm8
I'm a kicker
Only reason Jets lost to Browns, the league SCREWED Jets; that was their 3rd game in 11 days.
yeh go brows
You've gotta do the Texas rangers 2010 and 2011. The best team to never win a World Series.
I guess you just forgot that Justin Tucker exists, because one would think he might warrant a mention in a video like this.
As a Chargers fan, thank you for not mentioning Josh Lamboâ€™s performance against the Browns in 2016 ðŸ˜‚
"I'm surprised you didnt bring up the kicker for the Colts in Super Bowl V.  A rookie, Jim O' Brien, at kicker won the game for them under threat by his teammates. After the game, the men in the Baltimore lockeroom put away their scizzors in front of him, saying they couldn't cut the young mans hair (long hair was considered a no-no).
I'll give you props though for avoiding the obvious Gary Yepremian(?) gaffe against the 'skins in their perfect season, or showing his badly balding head, as every other topic bringing up kickers tends to do."
The Vikings have a history of having good kickers every other time of the season but they turn terrible when needed he most
I love that you're an underdog guy.. I'd love to see some GT love
OH SHIT WHAT UP UT FLEM FPV
Is this because you met mmg
How are you gonna have a video about kickers, and not mention Tom Dempsey?
To much pressure on the kickers
Go browns
I am a browns fan to
best in state of georgia for the fresman class ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
im a kicker
No mention of Justin Tucker the god of kickers rn
seatgeek=dad
Yo weâ€™re not weird weâ€™re just different ðŸ˜‚ sometimes I kick barefoot
Post more plz I watched all your videos
bengals aint trash
what a random vid
This Channel is a replacement Kicker.
Kickers are like YouTube Content Creators. Most of them don't have enough talent or creativity to run a Media Channel but they make incompetent videos like this for attention anyway. It's like you missed the Point of your own Video... They aren't doing anything weird. The Barefoot thing is Kinda wierd... I guess... The MVP was because of a Strike so they Had to give it to someone... The Odd fg at the end is cool but Footballs are shaped weird, had nothing to do with the Kicker... Why don't you answer your Original Statement? Isn't that what a Report is about? Do you not know how to write a Report?
KTO can you please do what if mike jones doesn't make the tackle in super bowl 34?
Letting go of Awesome Phil Dawson was a huge mistake. Regardless of the franchise tag. Pay that man. He still kicks today and is still one of the top!
Your a lefty just like me
Rodrigo Blankenship , by far the best kicker in the ncaa. And he plays for my favorite team. Go dawgs!!
Keep god first not football
Troydan was there
White guys need SOMETHING to do in the game
1:27 gives me Blair Walsh flashbacks, so so terrible...
i am a bears fan
Love the Herschel walker nfl vids
Seat geek is trash
Stop talking shit on my bro rodrigo
What about Robbie Gould's kick in a driving wind that ended up being way, way wide?
It's all a head game with kickers. They have the skill strength and talent. If they aren't there mentally they are nothing
Do a 100th video specia
"5:11 I don't need to imagine...




I am one."
Not-so-ramdom SeatGeek guy.
Haven't seen the Alabama crimson Tides kickers you could make a full video of that
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen on YouTube. Extremely informative, entertaining, and eye-opening. Great content!
Where is rodrigo Blankenshipâ€™s field goal where he passed the ball, ran back and made it
"You should do

The most forgotten receiver in college football,
Devin Smith"
Brown's auck
Small victories browns fans..very..very small
every player has an off day games will never be perfect kickers qb's rb's recievers will have of days. The fans are the ones that make things worse for the players. fans are by far nowhere near perfect so why should they expect athletes to be perfect.
Okay, I know browns have had some bad field goals lately, BUT FUCKING LOOK AT THE VIKINGS KICKERS. We have way more of a history of shitty shitty kicks.
Itâ€™s cool u like the browns no bandwagon here
ahem, Hot-Rod is NOT weird. He is kicking goat
I am a bears fan. This truly tics me off.
As a kicker myself, Iâ€™ve missed a game winner once and that was 7 weeks ago but since, nuh uh
What's with the Browns & Ravens always ending their games in kickoffs?
"Great video but...
Fuck the browns."
Urinatingtree anybody?
What about Doug flutieâ€™s drop kick Field goal
You should do a vid about that Brad banks iowa team that got crushed by USC in the orange bowl. A few hall of famers on that team
How are you not going to mention Justin Tucker
Steven haushaka is the best kicker in the NFL hands down
What about the kicker who kicked a game winning field goal with one foot.
I laughed so hard when  you said kickers on cocaine
I'm born and raised in Buffalo ny and been a life long bills fan Scott Norwood
Shameless advertising at the beginning. Times were better before everyone resorted to this.
Rondrigo blancinchip aka hot rod
For real though the browns need to trade their kicker
I love your vids keep it up
You gonna talk about kickers and not even mention Tucker?
Did I Just See Bengals trash ðŸ˜¢ Cmon man Atleast They're Better Than The Browns....Oh Sorry.....
Stop sucking your own dick
Browns need a new kicker!
Is that the training facility that got BTFO'd in a wind storm?
"Pure gold as always.  

I have a suggestion for a future video:  The History of the NFL Bye Week.  There's surprisingly a lot of material there to mine.  I think you'd do a great job telling it."
So, I'm a CFL fan. There's this kicker in my favourite team... He kicked 44 consecutive field goals this season, and counting. He's 5'7. I mean... 44 CONSECUTIVE field goals! He's a rookie.
You forgot about player you know the one in th thumbnail
Go Browns! :D
How tf you hook that bad
"Kickers on cocaine"
Do a video on Marcus Lattimore!
There are still a few barefoot kickers left these days :)
Iâ€™m surprised Joey Julius didnâ€™t get a shoutout.
9:01 bars
No Justin Tucker wow
I am a bears fan...ouch
Titans baby! Got the best kicker in the world, Ryan Succop.

MMG was also there with him
I love the bears
You gotta admit that outro gives you the chills
Whatâ€™s the song in the beginning?

Bengals are afc north champs and the browns will always be the cellar dwellers. WHO DEY!

What about graham gano
Rip 5:35 Iâ€™m a bears fan
4:36 mans got big ass feet lol
Why was Herschel Walker Iâ€™m here again?
You really need to get a button to skip the seer geek ads
Dislike the video if you remember the last time the buffalo bills were relevant..like if u forget about them alot
Whyâ€™d u put Blankenship in the thumbnail. DO NOT @ my man man Rodrigo blakenship
I saw mmg
Hell yeah brother Iâ€™d love to meet you at a Browns game!!!!
Oh wasant troydan there

Little did they know about mmg
Five points Vids is old a fuuuuuuuck
I feel so bad for that browns kicker
what do you mean brother the Bengals are legends WHO DEY
I'm a browns fan to
Tell the kicker thing to the chargers
Remember the Chiefs vs Broncos two years ago? Crazy TD to Tyreek Hill as regulation ran out, went to OT, came down to a FG bouncing off the left post barely sneaking in behind the right post for the win? Crazy.
One more tik Tom ad and Iâ€™m ending my life
5:15 imagine being a bears fan I am one that hurt watching that
Go Browns
5:13 I donâ€™t have to imagine. Iâ€™m already a Bears fan.
In Dawson We Trust!!
Im a cowboys fan
I will forever remember watching that Phil Dawson game tying field goal with my dad and being overly emotional that it saved the game.
You didn't add the clip where will hill III ran one back for a game winner off a blocked field goal :) #Ravens Nation
As a Vikings fan this hurts
I am a bears fan
Come on man. I'm a Ravens fan that loves your channel. U CAN'T END THE VIDEO LIKE THIS
my 8 year old son can make a 20 yard field goal!
What about Janikowski the 270 lb kicker
Can you do a video on Quinton Flowers
MMG was at that game too Lions vs Cowboys
man i miss phil dawson
As a Vikings fan, this triggers me
how does seat gear make money?
feels bad good luck in the NFL
Mason Crosby missing 5
Are u even from cleaveland or are u just a bandwagon fan??
4:16 WAS the all time leading scorer.... GO VINI
Ray Lewis is a murderer
It great to be a Packers fan 5:30
Did you see mmg?
Brown's doo doo
Justin Tucker. he is goo.
Don't talk about the Gary Anderson thing
Zane was injured though... I feel bad for him. His career is over because his coaches made him play through an injury
Zane gonzalez is from the blair walsh school
7:10 this is why I hate being a Vikings fan we only miss the most important field goals
Zane Gonzalez breaks my heart, as an asu fan I love the guy, and he was the most reliable kicker Iâ€™ve ever seen, Iâ€™m so confused
But i mean hey the ravens have 2 super bowls
Fck da Brown's
He says bengals trash what team does he like again cough cough Browns
You just need to look for the biggest, drunkest Polak you can find
2:32 and third place was Younghoe Koo - another disaster in the NFL
ðŸ‘
I feel you man, we have had trouble punting this season but I think that we have our guy in Greg
"Thats harsh for me when ypu said just imagine being a bears fan well for u i am 




There pretty bad"
First youtuber I have heard of that likes the browns too
Dude you sat in the same suite as me but I sat there during the Oklahoma tcu big 12 championship
Browns are trash
I love bro, but you can't be calling people randoms 0:15 when they get more subs and views than you.
KTO KEEP UP THE GREAT VIDEOS ; highly entertaining
What is the name of the song that starts at 9:00
Yo who else is a browns fan
im also a brown fan and sometimes its hard to watch a team that does good at the begging and at the end just lose from bad calls and the ref making bad calls losing us the game and missing easy field goals and if you are a browns fan like this comment
"I saw that Bengals trash mister ...







And I totally agree"
Hot rod is insane
Did u meet mmg
329,451st view
I wish I would knew that you  were in the dfw would of loved meeting you plus could of showed around the area
I am a browns fan to
I miss Phil Dawson every day
Hot rod!
Goggles best college kicker
The dude at the beginning is for no raps if didn't know now you know so go check him out
Hot Rod is a beast
did my boy say left crossbar 8:39
Go browns
Who was QB in the game they played?
did you meet mmg in dallas?
Donâ€™t be talking crap about the bengals boy they are the next best thing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
make a video on tyreek hill pressing charges on the patriots fan who threw beer on him
The only reason that that guy is older than some of his teammates only because he is a kicker and u have less of a chance to get hurt
KTO pumping these videos out so quickly makes me wet
Hot Rod!
Bengaâ€™s are not trash
This brings back bad memoriesðŸ˜¢
I'm a vikes fan and Carlson sucks
9:21 song please
Who is that dude at 5:04
I actually like kickers and punters they are so underated
Great video KTO!
Ghram Gano is the best kicker. Go Panthers!
Fun fact at 5:34 the kick was under the influence of cocaine it says in his book alive and kicking which i have meet him
The kicker on coke is hilarious that shit gives you super human powers
not only is it bad for the chargers. but imagine being a vikings fan. your team has lost or tied 50-100 games because of their kicker.
where mmg
You trash b*tch
I've been curious of the course of a long time about Kickers (Put , Holders nd Snappers) ... I appreciate the small insight about The Kicker.
Bengals is lit wtf are u talking about
adam is on my favrit team rite now the colts
Bears had a kicking identity with Gould. Now there is just a hole at kicker. :(
Good video as a Bengals can I don't appreciate that jab lol.
The bears are back
What you saying about the bengals
You should talk about janikowski
2:28 and thereâ€™s Younghoe Koo on the far left
Iâ€™m a browns fan too!
I am a punter and this vid is great
Dont worry KTO im a browns fan too, i was upset.
"Here is what I think the NFL will be like in 10 years:


Read more"
My grandpa was the kicker/punter for the Lombardi packers. He won two world champs and super bowl 1-2. All of his friends would talk about how important he was to the team and I really idolized him. Sadly though he passed away a couple of years ago. RIP Don Chandler
Can't believe I don't remember Vinatierri running down Herschel Walker!!!  That is IMPRESSIVE!!!
You should do a video talking about the Bengals and Browns gunslinging game in 2007 week 2
"KTO: 
""Watch this next scene and imagine being a bears fan""

Me:
""fuck..."""
Blair Walsh is the most hated guy over here in Seattle (we lost so many games because of him.)
I thought ncaa football games were the only place to get crazy name mashups like lebron oâ€™malley, then UGA signed rodrigo Blankenship.
what is KTO!>!
we need vinateri
The game during the saints Gonzalez was playing on a Groin injury
I am a browns fan and I was at that browns V Saints game and it was truly sickening because of Zane Gonzalez
As a Vikings fan I knew Gary Anderson was going to come up
You started to play that blocked field goal video and I immediately got upset. I was at that game and had never seen so many angry browns fans including myself.
Hey Iâ€™m a big auburn fan, and Iâ€™m also a big Vikings fan so it was really sad to see Daniel cut. I wish the would have given him a second chance.
KTO putting the â€œBrownsâ€ logo over his Cowboys shirt is the best thing Iâ€™ve seen all morning
He had a torn groin
"Wanna hear something sad?




Alabama can't get a good kicker."
GO BROWNS
Lucky you got to go to a cowboys game I am a big cowboys fan
Of course it was Pete Morelli officiating that Browns game at the end. He seems to always be officiating when weird things happen. He also just so happens to be the President of a private high school in the city I live in ðŸ˜‚
Remember Sebastian Janikowski was drafted in the 1st round
the ending to this video was perfect
Hope Hot Rod will be good in the NFL.
Also great vid forsure sub and notifications
Almost any kicker can hit field goals in practice. Where they earn the paycheck is when the pressure is on can they still make those kicks.
How can you have a list like this and not include Tom Dempsey of the New Orleans Saints. Guy didnâ€™t have toes in his kicking foot and set a field goal distance record that lasted for more than a decade.
remember when the browns went 0-16?
I didn't know five points looked that old, damn
As a Browns fan I MISS PHIL DAWSON
Morten Anderson doe sent have all time Adam venetaire
Was that trip in the beginning of the vid at the Frisco facilities?
"Kickers on Cocaine" Sounds like a movie
That kick by Phil Dawson in Baltimore you featured I was there right behind that field goal believe it or not absolute pandemonium, oh yea me and my brother were wearing Browns jerseys
So a browns fan a bengals fan and a steelers fan. Mustve been a pretty entertaining time
Letâ€™s go Cleveland !! #DawgPound
Thank god for Matt Bryant
You just had to bring up Gary Anderson and the '98 Vikings. Twenty freaking years ago, and it still hurts like it just happened :(
Didn't the Jets have to use a kicker as a QB in a game if I remember correctly he actually had a decent game
0:15 I think that was Mopi
Ok is this a video about kickers or a dig on Vikings fans?
Poor fivepointvids. Stuck with the kids lol. Love all y'all content.
I canâ€™t believe we lost that gameðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜­
"Nobody gives a shit about the kicker until they start missing.

Dope channel, my friend. I really enjoy your videos and especially the song at the end when you top  off the video."
Always love your endings in your videos
Holy shit dude!... You are ridiculous with all these Browns videos. And you throw the ball like a fairy.
"I had to pause at 7:00 and skip ahead
It hurt too much"
ROBBIE GOULD IS THE BEST KICKER IN THE NFL!
Wowwwww. I wish I wouldnâ€™t have watched this video. Even tho I kinda was annoyed at how much of a Browns homer you are, I still would watch your videos bc I respected your knowledge of the game. But after seeing you on the field and throwing a ball, I canâ€™t watch anymore. Youâ€™re an embarrassment.
It's not an easy thing to do to make 95% of your kicks. Just ask Mason Crosby.
Who's that Browns kicker with the mustache and the single bar face mask
I also just met Brian Hansen! He came to my church to talk to us lol
I went to the same highschool as Adam vinateri my freshman year
You didnâ€™t talk about Justin Tucker wtf?
As a Ravens fan I totally remember all those kicks mentioned at the end.
As a chargers fan, i feel the same way last season.
Dang get off flemlo raps man.
Blankenship was on my middle school football team
"Aye my boiiii Younghoe Koo,



WTF MANNN!"
what year was that dawson kick?
"i love being a browns fan 
even through all the rough stuff i still love it"
thank god for harrison butt kicker
Browns shoulda started 5-0
Did you meet mmg there!?!?!?
Once again, another quality video. I really love how you look back to my favorite era of NFL football (80's-90's). I appreciate the hell outta that man, keep em' coming.
Lol this video was a waste of time.. disliked
What I want to know is how all these good kickers are missing this year.
Alabama has the most consistently garbage ass , always suck ,game losing kickers ever.....
Go Browns
gonzales... man did i feel bad for that guy. #SaintsFan
What song is used at the end of the video?
donâ€™t say nothing about kickers until your a vikings fanðŸ˜”
Kickers are people too
For that Best Kicker award in college, shouldâ€™ve been Drew Brown from Nebraska all the way, the Brown family are kicking legends at Nebraska and 3 out of 4 brothers made it to the NFL
Same event as Mmg?
Please do a vid about Davante Adams
Think vinatieri broke the all time scoring record
my boy flemlo rapsðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥
Fire Amos Jones. No idea why we even picked him up in the first place. Cardinals ST was atrocious with him and now then we pick him up. Kickoff coverage and returns are absolute garbage, and why is Jabrill Peppers returning kicks and risking injury?
#ForTheBrand
theres was a kid at my highschool,(he plays for ut now) who could kick better then about 60% of the other people in the nfl his last names dicker and i wouldnâ€™t be suprised to see him start in the nfl
Hanging out with the salty yinzer must have been a lot of fun.
#fucknatekaeding
Did u see mmg
What if if KTO pronounced 'field' correctly?
I would love to play career mode with a Kicker on madden
As a kicker I find this offensive... but true. I honestly canâ€™t explain why sometimes Iâ€™m on and sometimes Iâ€™m off
Blankenship for the dawgs is good very good
Why making my team look bad aka ravens
KTO, man... I MISS old man Phil Dawson. Iâ€™d trade a 4th rounder to Arizona RIGHT NOW if they would take the deal. He was Mr. Consistent FOREVER for us. I miss him and Josh Cribbs. Wish we had them and Joe Thomas back, then we would be really cooking because Baker wouldnâ€™t have to worry about his 6 EVER. He could rest easy knowing 9.9 times out of 10, Joe Thomas is gonna take care of business and clean up that pesky pass rush because playing Thomas in pass protection was like getting locked by Deion on the outside. Ainâ€™t no one gonna hear from you that week.
I just discovered a football league called the AAF (alliance of American Football), it's set to have its inaugural season 1 week after this coming super bowl.... wondering if you could make a video on it
Chester Marcol is a badass
4:35 nasty ass mothafuckas
When the browns won that game against baltimore i was so upset because im a ravens fan
I hate kickers and punters!
Itâ€™s hard being a titans fan, our kicker was Mr. Irrelevant
i have to say this as a vikings fan f*ck carlson
How about Tom Tupa coming in at QB for the Jets? Or Danny White and Sammy Baugh and Bobby Lane and George Blanda bring QBs who kicked?
Herschel walker went to Georia
Rodrigo Blankenship is not a â€œhot rodâ€™â€™
I was at that ravens browns game with the crossbar kick. I fucking hated that game.
Mason Crosby against the Lions though
Pretty neat that they call that extension the Dawson Bar now!
"Browns
1st quarter 7-7
2nd quarter 21-21
3rd quarter 35-28
4th quarter 42-42
Overtime browns win by a field goal once again"
You know, I've never got nfl kickers. I've know kids on my soccer team that's been able to kick 50 yarders in middle school (i could kick a 40 easily in 8th grade) And yet that's a hard kick in the nfl. Just a thought.
BoomSports is a Browns fan.
And Iâ€™m a kicker
Go pack go
I am a bears fan
I'm a kicker Gonzalez is an embarrassment to the browns as a kicker
Mmg was there too right
"3:03 
FAST AS FCK BOI"
im a bears fan AND TRUBISKY ISNT A BUST!!
GO COWBOYS
2:29 Is that Younghoe Koo? All these guys NFL careers are done after a handful of games.
Being a kicker has to be the most stressful position in football ðŸ˜‚ knowing that the fate of the game relies on your foot and any false move you make can mean all the difference on you having a job the next day!
I never knew Vinatieri ran Walker down.
"Hey bud, I'm a Ravens fan.

At least your kicker won ya that one!!!! 

Man that hurt. Watched it with my girls family of browns fans."
I appreciate Graham Gano more now
Iâ€™m a chiefs fan, by far Harrison Butker was a steal. Hasnâ€™t missed a kick and made 90% last year. He is right now the most accurate kicker in NFL history with a total percentage of 92%. Iâ€™ve seen him kick in person (Iâ€™m a kicker). He is very consistent
Dude the bengals not trash, Marvin Lewis is
My man I man panthers fan but Iâ€™m also cheering for the browns ðŸ‘ðŸ»
#BringBackPhil
You left out mmg
fuck Dallas Fly Eagles Fly
That overtime kick against the Ravens was totally blocked. Look at it. Itâ€™s got topspin. Also, mentioning Gary Andersonâ€™s miss but not the River City Relay?
GOO DAWGS
Dang dawg you were throwing dots out their
Nice video dude.
Cleveland Would Be 3-1 right now, Iâ€™m from Cleveland, shit hurt, and I wanted Tyrod To look good, kicks effected that
Im so mad from that lose againts the cowboys right after the big game
can you do if peyton remained a colt
Browns r doing pretty decent this year
Browns need my boy Pat Murray back he is a freak. Unlucky with injuries but bring back the the Monaghan Monster
"Just an idea, go back to doing some what ifs like some of your old videos. Some ideas:
What if the colts drafted Ryan leaf
What if rg3 didnâ€™t get injured 
What if the Texans actually had a quarterback (before Watson Texans fan here)
Just an idea"
"5:12 I am a Bears fan and honestly that hurt just to watch.
STUPID PACKERS!!!!!!"
@4:36 them feet were unnatural.
As a saints fan. My wife thought I was watching a comedy during week 2
Man I am a Vikings fan and that was hard to watch
my dad is friends with phil dawson
Coked out kicker outruns entire defense :-))
Who else likes that song Morten Andersen made?
When you actually are a bears fan and had to watch that dreaded play again :/
How the fuck does the browns kicker still have a job let alone make any money?
Wassup flemloraps
HOTROD! GO DAWGS!!!
Hey walker is from my Georiga dawgs!!
Hey browns draft Rodrigo Blankenship
I going to the browns vs the falcons
But I am a steelers fan
They are ok
South Dakota State represent
If anyone watches or watched Blue Mountain State, this reminds me of Harmon lmao
Congrats on being decent this yeer
Kickers being bad at kicking is one of the things I will never understand. I mean the only thing you have to practice is kicking the ball from various distances.
Go Browns Clevelander for life new kicker
Go go Vikings I feel bad for Daniel Charalson
Harrison Butker is the best in the league.
A few years ago it seemed like a field goal miss was rare, now itâ€™s considered clutch to kick a 50+ yard field goal.
Dont think I didnt notice how you but the browns logo over that outfit
I live in South Dakota the jack rabbits
Rodrigo is winning the heisman
Urinating tree face reveal
Seahawks have both advanced in the playoffs and been eliminated from reaching the playoffs because of Blair Walsh misses.
It still kills me how old fivepointvids actually is ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Last one was epic
Derek Anderson to the bills king? Whatthe no way, he wull prolly get the start! ðŸ˜³ðŸ‘ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£
Do one on Punters
Please make a video of how gruden ruined the raiders
I can kick a field goal backwards I'm trying out now.
quit speeing up that footage to make it seem like he's running faster
"DAMN

1999 nfc championship game

Yeah

DAMN"
You forgot about kickers who injure themselves while celebrating!
"my flag football team is currently 0-7
1 like = 1 prayer"
"i only like a few kickers:  The Raiders Kicker, Paul Edinger (Bears former kicker), George Blanda, and Robbie Gould.
I'm biased for the bears."
Did you see MMG
I know how you feel about the Browns and kickers KTO. I am a Vikings fan Gary Anderson and Blair Walsh make me question why we go for field goals. #bringbackdropkicks!
Cool to see Flemlo again
good lord the browns have the worst kicker ever. get rid of that fucking flop after the second game and get someone better. At least the Raiders' Kicker is a legend.
Respect the specs
"ZANE GONZALEEEEZ!!!
I would rather eat a bowl of nails w/out any milk for breakfast than have you as my kicker. PUT YOUR MUTHAFLIPPINâ€™ HEAD DOWN!!!!"
In a way, i feel slightly glad that many kickers have bad games recently because i think one of the main reason kickers are underappreciated is bcos ppl expect them to make all fg and pat so with what happen recently, fans will appreciate good consistent kicker more than ever
I miss dawson
born and raised a Browns fan. Dawson kicking in field goals during a blizzard is a thing of beauty.
Kickers are amazing. It just funny when they miss a close kick.
I miss Joey Julius.
Life long eagles fan and as much as I love Jake Elliott, I love and miss David Akers.
Well of course you and flemo dominated both of yâ€™all use to be good athletes
How do you miss 4 kicks straight
Y
T
Maybe Zane Gonzales and Daniel Carlson just needed some of that Chester Marcol booger sugar
Dude, youâ€™ve been killing it lately. Truly awesome and original content. Keep up the good work!
I love being a kicker
We Broncos fans love Gary Anderson for missing that field goal. Cause instead of Minnesota, who would have disemboweled Denver, we got an easy repeat against Atlanta.
Flemlo!!
the referee at the end used to me my dean at st. marys high school
A team canâ€™t win if they have no leg to stand on. ðŸ˜¶
So how come on an onside kick, if the kicking team gets the ball it's there possession, but on a regular kickoff, if the kicking team recovers the ball, it's considered down and the other team gains possession
Does cocaine count as a PED? Asking for a friend...
As a browns fan like you, I understand the troubles and I know that we have gone through a hard struggle, but this year and next year we have a future
What about tom dempsey
As a Titans fan, I can definitely vouch for the value of kickers. We've had some good ones over the years (Del Greco, G. Anderson, Bironas, even Succop isn't too bad), and lord have we needed them. We've had some winning seasons where they were our leading scorers, by a pretty wide margin.
As a falcons fan i appreciated the 1998 nfc championship game
Better than Peterman
"Imagine being a Bears fan" I am a Bears fan;(
Punters are people too
Everyone makes fun of kickers until they win you the game
0:50 OH HELL NAH BENGALS ALWAYS BEAT THE BROWNS WHODEY FOR LIFE BRUH
Papa MMG was there iâ€™m pretty sure
Kickers usually end up being the leading scorer for their team. I have this feeling that kickers will some day be as sought after as running backs, maybe second only to QBs. And we'll see more draft coverage of kickers and they'll be bigger stars in the league.
I Browns fan
Herschel walker is also an extreme trump supporter
I might jinx him but Eddy Pineiro might be the new Adam Vinatieri. All Gator fans loved eddy when he was at Florida because he was the only one we could rely on for points the past few years.
God I miss Phil Dawson on the Browns
1:57 all around me are familiar faces
KTO you are truly one of a kind XD. You make better content then real NFL reporters.
Daniel Carlson ... smh.. Us Auburn fans back here were watching you with such high Hope's brother. I picked you up in  all 3 of my fantasy teams.
BUFFALO VS  NY GIANTS  - wide right
Kickers are usually the most important piece in a team. They can make or break you. Ask Peyton Manning or even Tom Brady. If your kicker canâ€™t convert the extra point or kick from 40-55 then youâ€™re going to lose 3-4 games. Some games are decided by 3 or less points. Invest in kickers.
"""Why are there not 32 competent kickers in the league?""
Game theory: if the kickers become better, the coaches will demand longer field goals - which in turn lowers the success%.
In other words, about 16 of the 32 NFL kickers are by default below average."
Urinating tree revealed
You know you're a Brownsfan: when winning 2 games becomes "some games".
Wow that was a crazy ending, I've never seen that type of scenario before!!!
If he did coke at halftime theres no way in hell he was still feeling it in overtime. Even coke from the 80's didn't last that long.
@4:10 those shorts bro...
Herschel Walker is still a badass. 56 years old and he does MMA now. Dude still looks like hes 30.
Top 10 scorners in NFL history? Kickers.
Bengals trash lmao
Gonzalez tore his groin in the saints game and had to play through it
im a Bengals Ravens Cowboys and Titans fan
Donâ€™t forget Kyle Bambard, the NC State kicker who missed like 4 field goals and an extra point against Clemson, if he made just one they wouldnâ€™t beat them... Clemson goes on to be national champs
Bengals are not trash
0:48 oh hell no
9:15 I did that in madden
Go Browns but Iâ€™m a packer fan
Bro if I could hang out with KTO and Urinating Tree it would already be awesome
Great vid
The you should know the answer for when the stupidity of Hue Jackson will be fired from Cleveland
Hi
Hi
Hi
I was so upset when Carlson missed those kicks
Bangel trash? That was harsh man! His content is great he happens to like a team that cant win in the playoffs so what!
Zane gonzales is the least talented human on this planet.
Imagine Being A Steelers Fan Right Now Just Waiting For BOSWELL To Get It Together. Yes BOSWELL
the only reason i watched this is bc hot rod was in the thumbnail
Alabama needs to find a fucking kicker ðŸ˜ 
Jan Steneruud deserves a mention...
Please i made 3 bets for 5 10 and 5 please go to the playoffs browns!!
Not as weird as Hockey Goalies man
The browns need rod
too much kicker duds this year
S/o to Phil Dawson, longtime Browns MVP
Dude you deserve the trip. Hope you had a blast. Keep making great vids.
Lmao intro video seems like dilfer and elielitr. Camp drills
The patriots had a terrible kicker in about 1985
This video never answered one very important question--who's the Browns guy with the 1-bar and the awesome mustache?  The dude looks like a 60 year old biker.
My favorite kick as a Chiefs fan was Santos' donk heard round the world.
Morten Andersen is the only player from my country to play in NFL
5:10 I AM a Bears fan damnit!
Ya know what's crazy? Adam Vinateri's nephew is also a kicker at SDSU, and is getting NFL buzz. Adam has been kicking longer than the kid has been alive. Man the dude is old
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ when he said he snorted cocaine @ Halftime I died lmao boy was high running that TD ðŸ’€
Great video boss I usually go by ur stats and assume they right I wish I could be in shit like this
come here after watching Mason Crosby got redeemed and made game winning field goal for Green Bay
Zane Gonzales would piss me off even if I was cheering for the Saints in that game
Kto just drop kicked a field goal from about 65 with this video.
So thatâ€™s what urinating tree looks like
Iâ€™m a 49ers fan. Just lost tonight due to Crosbyâ€™s redemption. I wouldâ€™ve loved if he continued having a bad season. Ugh. Gotta tell you though, this is the greatest video anyone ever has made about NFL kickers.
We had Chester Marcol as a school speaker
The Vikings will never win a Super Bowl because their kickers can never hit a clutch fg to win or tie or to give them a bigger lead
Your videos are my fav I hope one day you run ESPN or SB Nation or bleacher report or make enough to buy them out KTO
Vinatieri broke the record
Flemlo looks like Cole from Martin
Scott playyyyyer
Best outro in all of YouTube
Go Brownies
Did you see MMG?
Did you have to show the Gary Anderson miss
Honestly it might be just the fact that some kickers are mentally strong and some are not. Once you get to the pros they have it in the back of their mind that now Iâ€™m getting paid for this if I donâ€™t perform Iâ€™m out of a job. Which might cause shaky knees and missed field goals
Notice Younghoe Koo 2:30, he was third place and was cut for missing clutch field goals.
Great vid! I'd like to see your take on something involving the Packers
Go Browns!
My boy gano hit a 63 yarder
Whos the #5 holder for the browns?
CHESTER MARSHALL, CHESTER MARSHALL LMAO!!! WOW
Flex on!
Vinnie won me my fantasy last week lol
Kickers are people too
Imagine being the high kicker. "Oh, shit! I've caught the ball."
As a cowboys fan watching Dan Bailey get cut was hard but Brett Maher is looking to be a great kicker who was undrafted and was picked up from the CFL.
I met Adam Vinateri at my elementary school in a tiny town called Northbridge Massachusetts. I was in 5th grade and I am 31 years old. All I remember is a a kid asking him a question about Vincent Brown an old linebacker and him giving an answer like" I don't know I think he was getting ready to retire before I got here." We all got signed cards of his. Imagine how crazy it is that our class got to meet him when he first got to New England. He seemed like an extremely humble guy and looked nothing like a football player in my memory of him BTW
U will never as good As any of the members of 2hype Humphrey has more clout than youðŸ˜‚
Why you got hurt me like that KTO
Wanna talk kickers KTO? One name...SEBASTIAN JANIKOWSKI! Nice vid bud, Go Stillers!
I seem to remember one of Dawson's field goals at the end of a game bouncing off the top of an upright and there was a long review to determine whether it was good or not.  Maybe around 2004-05? Anyone remember that?
Cocaine is a helluva drug
such good content bro
If you donâ€™t think us vikings fans have some sort of curse youâ€™re wrong. Gary Anderson then Blair Walsh fucks it for us then that new fuckhead loses some games for us, itâ€™s tough
No love for Tom Dempsey? the half foot kicker with a shoe filled with steel so he could kick farther?
missed opportunity to not show garo yepremian in the super bowl
Honestly what happened to kickers it used to feel like they almost never missed and now so many miss all the time I mean look at the pats kicker he was famous for not missing and now he misses a lot
Zaaaaaaane Gonzalez!!!!!!! I would rather ride with a blind Asian woman than have u as my kicker!!!!
Ayyyyye Flemlo
Finally us kickers are recognized
I'm a Vikings fan, why did I click on this video... :(
Zane Gonzalez, Daniel Carlson, Blair Walsh, Conner Barth, NICK FOLK!! PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN' HEADS BACK DOWN!!
2HYPE GANG
Put respect on Goggles name
Wow anybody else surprised about what urinating tree looks like??!!
Vinatieri... Greatest kicker of all time
"Mans said bengals suck and the says he is a browns fan lol 


Great vid btw"
That throwing form tho
Thoughts on Tyrod?
Phil Dawson, Hook 'em.
Thought he would talk bout crosby
While I always respected what the more known positions in football can do (QB, RB, WR, LB, so on), I always respected the kickers and punters as well. If I tried, the farthest I could kick a ball is 30 yards. Most can kick from 50 with great accuracy, which is a pretty amazing skill.
No wonder why mmg acts like a absolute dumbassðŸ˜‚
Matt prater the goat
"Different position but punting as Iâ€™m sure most know used to be the secondary function of quarterbacks and no one did it better than Sammy Baugh. 
Httr"
I was at the chargers buccaneers game in 2016 and that was a shit show. Lambo vs Aguayo. Who could miss more kicks?
Jon Ryan TD was crazy
How do you beat the Bears? COCAINE BITCH! LOL
CrackheadspeedðŸ’¨
And no mention of the recent and crazy Arizona-Seattle showdowns that feature ultra bizarre kicking moments
Here after Mason Crosby just hit the game winner a week after having the worst performance of his career.
Who is the asian at 2:39?
Remember watching that Dawson one live. One of the craziest moments ive seen.
I live in Cleveland it is about damn time
I saw hot rod so I clicked
Anytime that song with the siren u know something crazy about to happen.
I wish I had the skill and "cool as ice" nature to be an NFL kicker, could you imagine doing basically nothing the whole game and then 3 seconds left you're called in to win the game?
KTO why did you have to mention Gary Anderson? :'(
Man this video seems even more relevant now after Crosbys shit game last week and redemption this week
SOUTH DAKOTA BABYYYYYYYYYY
As a vikings fan watching that pains me
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
S/O to Hot Rod. Best kicker in college today
Whatâ€™s the Outro song ?
â€œKickers on kocaineâ€
Fun one I think of as a chiefs fan is Santos game winner against Denver 2 years ago on Sunday night
I got a kick out of watching this video.... (Except for the ad plug)
Mmg ahhh did u see him kto
4:35 LOOK HOW LONG THOSE FEET ARE
Yes, yes they are
How do you make a video on kicker and not mention Justin tucker
:48 "bengals trash" edit had me rolling @KTO
2:30 peep younghoe koo
Keep up the good ass videos
Our kicker in highschool literally never came to practice, smoked weed constantly. Dropped 50 yrd fgs in his sleep though. So yeah. That was nice
BRAVO!
Great video
Mark moseley wasnt a kicker he was a football player that kicked, when he was in college he played qb and linebacker as well as handling kicking, and he was the redskins scout team qb, that man was a football player
Zane Gonzalez is the new blayer Walsh
And after what Mason Crosby just did
Whos the really old browns kicker? the one with the white mustache at 5:02
Bring back straight-on kickers, and drop kicks and things will get interesting
Jesus what is with the Vikings and kickers
2:32 laclan on the left
I saw MMGâ€™s video of the Seatgeek trip but didnâ€™t see you in the video. I love both of you. I just wondered if you guys met.
Where's Garo Yepremian?
KTO with another banger
You have no idea how many high school games I lost on one field goal alone.
Coming from Akron Ohio .... itâ€™s tough not having Phil Dawson when the browns really need him
Kickers are underrated. For example they can end up being your most consistent scorer in fantasy lol
"B e n g a l s
T r a s h"
Iâ€™m a Viking fan and we have always struggled with finding kickers
Calling it Crosby misses
Iâ€™m a kicker, and itâ€™s not as easy as it seems tbh... itâ€™s actually really hard
Way to end  a Monday A kto video perfect ðŸ˜´
Phil Dawson better get into the Hall of fame
I watch flemlo too
Finkle!!!!
Kickers finna get PAID watch...at least the â€œgoodâ€ ones
Feel so bad for that saints kicker (can't remember his name but was one of best in history as 3rd leading scorer in nfl )that missed the pat after the crazy and only successful lateral TD as time expired losing the game wich knocked them out of playoffs surprising he wasnt mentioned in this video
Where is mmg?
Only the browns lol
Phil Dawson was a goat
What about the Jets punter that played QB?
No mention of mason Crosby
As a baseball player I dont play football but I kick to get a chance to play(without injury)
Mason crosby missed 4 straight in a game against the lions was hard to watch
Needed to put the panthers 63 yard field goal in
FlemLo crushing that food ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Justin Tucker the goat
Iâ€™m a die hard raiders fan but Iâ€™ve always had some love for the Browns
The field goal to beat ravens this year was the most Cleveland like field goal ever
Adam has the most points now for a kicker or all time. He did it couple weeks ago
FLR, UT, 5PV and KTO playing flag footbal?! I would've killed to be there
All Day ðŸ˜…
Dude you probably could make calculus interesting
I remember watching that field goal at the end live. At the time field goals were not something that could be video reviewed (which is why the ref said "after further discussion"), which they fixed in the following offseason.
My boi flem
Lol phil dawson a god
That shit hurt. Browns should be 4-1.
"Question. I dont know this might br stupid. Is it Mandatory for the kicker to have like those steps back to kick the football? Or can you stand closer to the holder and do it?
Been watching football but I dont know this."
You forgot the half foot kicker. Mr Tom Dempsey
Best video yet.....haha
That mike Nugent kick vs the Seahawks was crazy
Kickers are one of a kind but KTO is one of a kind youtuber
I respect you kto being a browns fan takes a lot but donâ€™t worry the Cardiac kids are upðŸ’ªðŸ¾ðŸ’ªðŸ¾ðŸ’ªðŸ¾
Highly underrated Channel you just earned a sub
Dude thatâ€™s sick that you got all that
"This video is a work of art! What a great topic to talk about. It seems almost taboo to even bring up because you NEVER hear about it on national tv. 

Amazing video bro! This was a lot of fun to watch as a fan!"
papa meags
That packers play just ruined my night
as a fellow Browns fan, GOD BLESS PHIL DAWSON. holy trinity of post â€˜99 Browns: Joe Thomas, Josh Cribbs, Phil Dawson. Phil won us games on multiple occasions
Flemlo with the Bengals jersey lol
ALL DAY
You deserve waaaaaay more subs
GO BROWNS!!!!
Do a video on Lyle alzado
KTO I was just rewatching Joe Thomasâ€™s retirement speech and he talked about that Dawson kick. He said he thinks itâ€™s the only time the browns won in that stadium while he was playing for themðŸ˜‚
Yes one of my favorite youtubers is in the lefty gang
0:08 I think this is urinating treeâ€™s face reveal?
What's your outro song
Imagine being a Chargers fan. Weâ€™ve missed playoffs and lost multiple playoff games including the AFC championship because of missed kicks. I would be willing to trade 2 first rounders for a consistent kicker at this point.
"Varsity football practice got me so tired 
Im a right guard"
While my broncos have really SUCKED the past few years... at least we have a solid kicker in Mcmanus. If we need a game winner we can trust him
Not enough guys named Chester anymore.
"You should do a video on Pete Gogolak: The kicker who changed EVERYTHING.

You should also do one on Ray Guy: The only Punter in the Hall of Fame."
zane gonzalez thought it was soccer
How likely do you think that Daniel Carlson gets signed by another team
I honestly think kto is hilarious but i dont like how we said tht bengals were trash
Yes Vikings fans did feel that same wayðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­Minnesota boy here
Damn KTO is SLINGING that pill
Flemlo raps anyone
Matt Bryant needs some love tho
Iâ€™m glad somebody knows who Rodrigo Blankenship isðŸ˜‚ Great video KTO you never fail to keep me entertained.
Great video. I had no idea a kicker has been MVP
"I know your not a hockey channel... but goalies are the same way! Truly one of a kind and some very weird! 

Your Chanel is amazing, excellent editing, superb narrating & top notch content."
Please do a video on fotu leiato aka â€œthe huddle legendâ€ (his huddle highlight tape had over 1 million views.
My main question is why woman donâ€™t play in the NFL
Hey just FYI Zane had a groin injury and never shouldâ€™ve been out there kicking in the first place, and Iâ€™m a browns fan because of him, he went to ASU the college I follow.
You've done it again! Great content!
Canâ€™t relate.
:51 are u mad were better than u
Yo mmg was there
aye papa was there
Special teams like special ed.
I heard Hershel Walker in a video about kickers and knew what was about to go down. The fastest man alive was going to make an appearance.
KTO is beast he make the best vids!!!
Go Georgia Bulldawgs!!!!!
I feel you too my dude. Iâ€™m a browns fan too.
Why did you stop showing your face?
How u make a video about kickers but not mention the goat Blair Walsh?
Go over the top ten players in 2009 nfl draft like you did with the 2006 nfl draft
Iâ€™m a ravens fan so that last part hirt
Never talk about Zane Gonzalez again please. He went to my high school and I love him.
Plz fuck right off seat geek
FlemloRaps steals content. Fucking scrub.
Letâ€™s go seat geek sponsorship
Wasnt MMG there
Lmaoao you would put Georgia's kicker on the thumbnail
Blankenship is wild af much love for that dude
As a ravens fan, im glad we got tucker
Iâ€™m wondering why they cut Ross Martin (kicker who was cut in preseason)
I really miss Phil dawson
Alabama fans know what it feels like being traumatized during special teams
Are we just gonna ignore how long that dude in the middles feet areðŸ¤£
Did you see MMG there
Donâ€™t u dare talk about the goat hot rod
Where is MMG
Please try to upload more I would really like if you would!!
Did you meet mmg
"I kicked in high school and I have to say compared to other field skills it was a bizarre learning curve. As the placekicker and qb3 I had no illusions as to my real role on the team: I helped the meatheads with homework and learning the playbook. The most fun years of my youth.
Great video, mang."
Ktos 'theme music is legendary and perfect for every video
Pet peeve of mine. Gary Anderson did not lose the Vikings the NFC championship, he did not cost them the game. There were over 2 minutes left in the game and the Vikings had a 7 point lead. The Vikings defense chocked and their offense couldnâ€™t move the ball anymore either. That kick would have made it a 10 point lead making it much more difficult yes, but itâ€™s not like they were suddenly losing after he missed.
Looks like Gonzales used to kick for Alabama.
7:48 what's the song? It's a BOP af.
It was great to see be a Baller for a Day in a Suite! Good Stuff KTO!
Who is the Browns guy in the thumbnail?
Blankenship is a GOAT
Add me on snap: corymcgee04
What about the 3 college kickers who wore the jersey # 100? (I believe one of them played for WVU and another for Kansas sometime in the 60s)
I feel so bad for Zane Gonzalez.
Karsten = Tom Brady
Go dawgss
Real quick on the coked-out kicker... If he did coke at halftime, and that play was at the end of the game, or anywhere in the 4th quarter even... he was definitely NOT feeling it. Unless he did a completely insane amount. That shit wears off in a half hour tops. Which makes that play even more impressive, since he was more likely crashing.
Great video! I love your channel. Keep up the amazing work ðŸ˜€
Shut up I wear goggles and Iâ€™m started wide receiver so shut up
Was MMG there
0:07 picture of 4 G.O.A.T.s right here. No seriously I'm subbed to all 4 of u guys. Ur amazing and keep up the good work.
I didn't know Hulk Hogan kicked for the Browns
Just jealous of tucker lol
Phil Dawson is my teams kicker now and heâ€™s not that good
Go dawgs I saw hot rod on thumbnail and couldnâ€™t help it
Frick you Bengals don't suck
You met Tree and Five Point? Man, if only you could also meet ThatsGoodSports/Brandon Perna, the best sports analyst in the world and a Broncos fan like me. You, Perna, Tree, and Five Point are the GOAT's.
Kickers are people too, except Roberto Aguayo and Blair Walsh we can make fun of them all we want
"Great video, dude.

Seriously though... what's with the Browns and kickers?

Also, Mark Moseley, the only kicker to win the MVP, also kicked for the Browns. He kicked a GW against the Jets in 2OT the 1986 Divisional Round... after missing a chip-shot 27-yarder in OT."
You beat us in OT (coming from a Baltimore Ravens Fan, Go Tucker)
Saw Blankenship... clicked
I remember seeing that Browns kicker and thinking not only is going to be out of a job, but that he was probably getting death threats before he even got on the plane home.
Yes, yes we are weird but weâ€™re proud of it
Lowkey coulda ended it with the Chris Davis kick return
Mmg
Did u see mmh
ha Roberto Aguayo
What about that dude with the foot problem and the weird boot, Tom Dempsey I wanna say  was his name
As an actual bears fan that clip just made me pissed
I watch urinating tree, flemlo, and 5 point. and of course yours
Blankenship will be the GOAT in 20 years watch
Oh, you think you have kicking problems? #boltup
that last FG you mention was the weirdest thing. As a Ravens fans all I can remember is that pretty much all of Baltimore's players were heading the to the locker room if not already there when the decision came in. So they had to re-dress and get ready for OT. Also no mention of Tucker who is an opera singer, Place Kickers are truly... eccentric hahahaha
Justin tucked and Adam viniteri both went undeafyed
You're not going to talk about success stories like Tucker or Viniteri
Your intros keep getting longer and longer
Iâ€™ll be honest I donâ€™t watch a lot of ur vids, but hearing u are a browns fan ! Oh man I fell Inlove. Subbed
Respect the specks
I just got Blair Walsh flashbacks(Seahawks)
Daniel Carlson won Auburn a whole game with 6 field goals and had about two on the other games each i was really disappointed when the Vikings cut him. His brothers Anders is playing horribly also at Auburn at kicker
You just not going to talk ab the 63 yard kick
Shoudn't kicker and punter be the two easiest positions to translate to the NFL?
Man I would play Madden 2005 and watch the opening video with Jeff Wilkins in it showing off his one white shoe and one black shoe. Kickers are truly one of a kind man. Dope video
You and FlemLo would have lit the field up if you played together in college
New Englandâ€™s kicker is beast
My boi Rodrigo ðŸ¤“
Respecthespecs ( Rodrigo Blankenship Georgia kicker )
freaking love this guy
The good ole Dawson bar
Daniel Carlason was probably nervous, it was his first ever game and he had pressure to do good. Iâ€™m an Auburn fan and he is GOOD
Rodrigo Blankenship mah man
Where did you get the music?
Thank god im not the only browns fab in existence
You went d1 I expected that you would show out at that flag football cmon
0:49 You gotta do your boy Flem like that bro ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
no mention of mason crosby?
I only subscribe CAuse you played in Dallas at the cowboys compound
My lil homie Rodrigo Blankenship on the thumbnail ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m not even a UGA fan... Iâ€™m a bold fan and we play them like every year ðŸ˜‚
KTO is the goat! Good content
All Day!
"kickers on cocaine"
RODRIGO IS NOT WEIRD! #fearthespecs
Mmg??
Blair Walsh all I gotta say.
There is criminally low amount of comments giving love to the all time scoring leaders sweet ass song and shorts
Did u see MMG when u went to see the cowboys?
Problem with finding a good kicker from a coaching standpoint is that it doesnâ€™t matter if they are 100/100 in practice. All that matters is if you can do it with all eyes on you. Tough job man.
You see troydanðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Flemlo represent!
Yo! It's my boi Hotrod! Also i'm not a browns fan but gonzalez is hot trash.
Letâ€™s not talk about ravens browns field goals
0:50 no
Great video, but you shoulda squeezed in 30 seconds of Garo Yepremian trying to throw a pass in the Super Bowl vs. the Redskins. :)
Are u left handed/Iâ€™m left handed
Aye KTO still got it
Did u see mmg because he was there and met Barry Sanders
7:00 Oh so that's what happened.  The announcer put the mouth on him.  "He hasn't missed in two years"  Way to go announcer.
No joke, you've got one of the best outros ever with that song coming in
Flag football lul
What no mention of wide right and the Bills?
Why was Hot Rod on the thumbnail but wasnâ€™t in the video??ðŸ˜‚
but still R.I.P to theÂ browns
Rest in peace Paul Allen. You deserved better...
did you have to put the clip of the patriots winning against the chiefs.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  chiefs fan.
KTO you should check out Braden Mann from Texas A&M. Heâ€™s an amazing punter who recently caused a fumble recovery against South Carolina.
Cocaine a hell of a drug
Phil Dawson is a browns legend
I'm a Steelers fan and in that first clip of kickers missing fields goals we missed first so you have no right to talk lol.
Phil Dawson is a Browns legend
i clicked this video cause wanted to say i love your work bro and almost 98 percent of the young guys you allways talk abt comen out of collage and every now and then i woneder were are they or what happend to them like mcfadden seen him in one game with oakland. or lamicheal james again one game for 49ers. abt about price petty from balor he was good. i seen u did his w.r. a video on him corey something.alot of my era games cuz im 33 u make videos and answer very very bless you are. mean how do u get the on going ideas from.ur fans i guess right?. but were at like comments here twitter ig? let me no
Speaking of good kickers in college I hope HotRod Blankenship can have a great NFL career
One of my good friends is Matthew Statfords 2nd cousin
Every time I see a notification from YouTube saying that you uploaded a video, I am more than happy to click on it. Youâ€™ve been uploading great content for a very long time, and I wish you would have even better success with all that work youâ€™re putting in. Keep it up.
The 80s must some shit if even the kicker was hittin the yay in the locker room ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Awesome video man
Thank you for including Rodrigo Blankenship in this video
Why weâ€™re u at the star at frisco lol
No hate at all bout you made a video about kickers and didnâ€™t talk about Justin Tucker :( Great video still
He was high on cocaine. You dick I was drinking sweet tea and I spit it everywhere
U forgot the kicker with half a foot
In the late 1980â€™s I traveled to Lawrence, KS to see my Baylor play KU. The Bears won but what Iâ€™ll never forget about that game was when the KU kicker attempted a field goal and it hit the crossbar dead center, proceeded to bounce virtually straight up and then fall barely short of the bar. From our seats near the 20 yard line, it was almost like a slow-motion replay, lol.  Iâ€™ve always loved the kicking game. Great video as always!!
I think MMG also attended that thing
that moment when you realised browns should be at least 4-2 or 5-1
RESPECT THE SPECS
â€œBengals trashâ€ lol
Thank you for not mentioning the disaster that was Russel Erxleben.  People forget that outside of the Dome Patrol and a few brilliant moments from Aaron Brooks, Saints fans haven't had a lot to cheer about since their inception.
Watch this and imagine being a bears fan, me a bears fan â€œdamn I should probably change this huh?â€ Then I didnâ€™t change it and a coked out dude ran for a TD smh
Itâ€™s good to know there is more browns fans out there it feels lonely sometimes
Only if yâ€™all young boys knew about Hershel walker ðŸ’ªðŸ˜ˆ
Kickers on cocaineðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
KTO is one of the best qbs to wear a browns shirt of all time
How dare you call my boi Hotrod Blankenship weird lol
Did you see Rodrigo Blankenship (Georgia's Kicker) Last week vs Vandy he had the weirdest field goal.
Can you do one about Derrick Thomas??? Please? Go Chiefs!
Yes
Flemlo got those hands lol
Us charger fans can relate too man :/
I was wondering if you could make a video on your thoughts on the Alliance of American Football
How just gunna put my kicker in your clickbait
â€œKickers on cocaineâ€
Great vid as always keep it up
I respect kickers, but I donâ€™t see how a kicker EVER gets hurt. I just donâ€™t understand
Comparable to goalies in hockey. Iâ€™ve never been on a team where the goalie wasnâ€™t the weirdest one on the team
You should be in the nfl my guy. You can be the hero the browns need.
You make the absolute best football videos on YouTube. A very big thank you for keeping me entertained. Seriously...who else would make an in depth video on kickers??!!! I love it!
Kto glad your a browns fan im too
ANOTHER BROWNS FAN REJOICE FOR ALL BROWNS FANS
#respectthespecs
How are all of your videos so good?
Man I hope the browns do better!
You and Flemlo should do a video together for the bengals v browns game...and maybe yall just do a lil special collab video on why ur team will win the game or the keys for your team to win or play madden with ur teams against each other..maybe make a public friendly wager for the actual game
FlemLo is way bigger than I thought he would be.
I love Adam ðŸ˜
How bout them Chargers:)
mmg was there
how can you make a video about kickers and not mention dan bailey
459th
I think that the browns kickerâ€™s brother is Blair Walsh
FUCKING HOT ROD THIS GOAT
7:02 That right there is the commentator jinx in full swing!
KTO, a truly one of a kind YouTuber. I've never been so engaged in the lives of kickers haha.
The fact you put a highlight in from SNF last night wonâ€™t get enough credit. Props KTO
KTO, later in the year make another most disappointing teams video, and teams that turned around their season
Fuck you KTO I am a Bears fan
browns fa life
finally some love for the kickers
I donâ€™t need to imagine being a bears fan I am one
Videos dropping like crazy. Love it man
As a Saints fan for life that week two game belonged to the Browns. I remember chanting before the kick â€œheâ€™s gonna miss it. Itâ€™s the Brownsâ€ out of sarcasm, but woah I wasnâ€™t ready for that. That sucked.
Im a simple football fan, see Rodrigo "HotRod" Blankenship, I click
Iâ€™m going to write a book called â€œKickers on Cocaine.â€
Kicker lives matter
"""See this game and imagine being a Bears fan.""

Vietnam Flashbacks of being a current Bears fan and seeing them loss

""SKIP!"""
Nice video
My dad is a Vikings fan and he remembers that game and hates when he hears about it
another great video
What about the man himself, Young Hoe Koo?
ya mom is maybe straight
Eagles fan here while he became an instant legend last year with the 61 yard game winner against the Giants still have to hold my breath every time Jake Elliott kicks a FG or Extra Point because he's had some misses too.
I'm a huge ravens fan and I was mad that we tipped the kick and it went in but Browns put up a good fight
This video comes out two days after Kirby Smart try to get Rodrigo Blankenship to run the ball on 4th and 9 after a fake punt... It didn't work
"I have to admit...that's a pretty nice little gift via your sponsor...I'm impressed they would do something like that...I haven't been to a sporting event in years but I promise I will check them out if I do...

Semper Fi!!!"
Carlson sucks
8:10 Yeah that one time Auburn won after returning a missed field goal to the end zone clinching the SEC West in front of their home fans
Mason sucks too man.... I lost my shit when Green Bay played Detroit (I'm a cheesehead). It was awful
Five points sounds way younger than what he looks. This is the first time I seen him.
Imagine being a vikings fan....
Urinating Trees dad is big ben. Big Ben raped trees mom that's why he hate big Ben and calls him fat fuck. True 100% facts
Ya, itâ€™s like when you have an absolute DOMINANT team but somehow have a worse kicker every year
"This hurt. As a Ravens fan. This hurt. 

Good video though"
bengals trash
papaaaaaaa
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. Thereâ€™s too many kickers who canâ€™t handle pressure compared to those who can
"â€œI have never been so unsettled watching a special teams unitâ€
I bet he made this before the Packers-Lions game"
IMO a good kicker (zurlein, gostowski, Etc) is worth around 1st-2nd round pick. Thereâ€™s too many kickers who canâ€™t handle pressure compared to those who can
You forgot to mention the Clef Foot Kicker.  He kicked straight-legged, had a custom boot for his kicking foot, and because of the way his foot was deformed he was dead accurate kicking straight-footed.
You fuckin labelled flemlo Bengals trash im dead that was so funny
Go browns! Iâ€™m from NE Ohio
â€œWeâ€™ve seen kicker on cocainâ€ ðŸ’€
Lol bengal trash that had me dead
I'm a Steelers fan, can't wait to see y'all next week
Urinating tree looks like ben roethlesberger
We need a new kicker for the bears
The browns kicker  went to my high school and I fill ashamed but at least he was good enough to make it
Hop off my man Hot Rod... only UGA fans would put this ^^^
Please do a video on why vontae Davis retired at half time
"KTO youâ€™re such a great youtuber








Now that heâ€™s not looking the browns suck the ravens are better"
This is awesome
You missed the kicker with half a foot who had a rule made for him.
it's weird to think that the browns should be 5-1 if they had a decent kicker
"I guess you can say every dawg has its day 








I will see myself out now ðŸš¶"
Pat Mcafee was on the Rich Eisen show last week and said himself kickers aren't football players. They're mindset going into each play is different compared to any other position during a game.
I love my kicking brethren.
You've got such a great feel for this. Can't believe a network hasn't recruited you yet. Or maybe they have.ðŸ˜®
Nice
Dude Iâ€™m subbed to Flemlo too!
What college did Hershel walker go to
Holy shit that dude running that kick in coked out of his mind is hilarious
Favorite youtuber
Lol KTO and Flemlo at a Cowboys game wearing Browns and Bengals gear
Underrated YouTuber
You should talk about fair catch kicks and drop kicks
Yo can you do a video on concrete charlie
Whatâ€™s the song at the beginning?
Kick 6?
Any ideas on why great college kickers are so bad in the NFL?
Is it just me or have kickers just sucked in general this year, in college and the nfl?
Kto the goat
Best edits ever ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Barefoot? Ouchie
Stop shit talking the players who have the most pressure on them at all times
I knew you were gonna do something related to that browns saints game the second i saw it happen ðŸ˜‚
MMG recently released a vid at the same place. I was trying to look closely at the 7 on 7 game but couldn't find. @MMG
lmfao now you know how us chargers fans have felt the last 2 seasons ROFL âš¡ï¸âš¡ï¸ðŸ¤—
Well, on the bright side, they have this in common with Alabama.
is everyone just going to ignore the fact that a kicker made a TD while high on cocaine?
â€œbengals trashâ€ðŸ˜‚
"Bengals Trash"
Browns, draft Rodrigo "4 eyes" Blankenship.  You won't regret it, he is legit great
Dan Baley used to be the most accurate kicker before his injury

Hot rod!
Nice vid man keep making them!!!
Lol 0:05 edited browns merch
Was that Georgia I saw? ðŸ˜‚
Carlson won it (he's middle)
blankenship is a god
I don't understand why soccer players are not used more for this? In the NFL Europe Manni BurgsmÃ¼ller had quite the career as a kicker after being a soccer pro.
Adam vinetari is actually the all time scoring leader.
Bengals Trash!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
bengals trash
Did you see mmg
Rodrigo Blankenship is a physical specimen
Papa mmg was there to and a kicker
Iâ€™m a kicker a punter and a linebacker for my city league team and a quarterback wide receiver linebacker and cornerback for my middle school team and out of all of those kicker and punter are my favorite
The GOAT behind Adam is Matt Bryant
Yooo that's a way better look at UrinatingTree
ZANE GONZALEZ I WOULD RATHER TAKE HIDE AND SEEK ADVICE FROM ANNE FRANK THAN HAVE YOU AS MY KICKER. PUT YOUR MUTHAFUCKIN HEAD BACK DOWN
Tree has the athletic ability of Homer Simpson and looks like Big Ben's younger brother
Your amazing KTO
Shouldve mentioned Jason Hanson since he experienced 2 decades worth of kicking
Maybe Gonzalez is cursed by his number look at other flops that wore that number Tim Couch, Johnny Manziel.
Iâ€™m a browns fan cause of u
meanwhile Jason Myers goes 7 for 7 for the Jets.
I love your channel kto :)
Hot Rod Blankenship and Herschel, damn good Dawgs! Go Dawgs!
Hi person to lazy to skip ahead in the video
As a bears fan, kickers are gay
I go to school with both of Phil Dawsons kids
Cool video
It's good win still win the head to head record  of all time plus remember 2015 when we won on a miss field goal and we returned it,  good times.  Don't worry we will get you
I was hoping u would talk about Rodrigo Blankenship, the greatest kicker of all time
Will never understand why the Pats didn't hold on to Vinatieri.
KTO=ðŸ
yo man where the browns "Hard knocks" review i thought you were doing?
Saw Scott player on the thumb nail and clicked immediately! Also KTO you doing a video vlog of the Dallas trip like UT?
As a Bama fan this is true lol
favoite team is batimore
Rip
Yo man... where is the Browns
I hate to now because  I am a raven
Kickers on cocaineðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Chester Marcol proved that the White kept him hyped!!
You shouldâ€™ve said something about nick folk
Rodrigo Blankenship sounds like the most Madden-generated name I've ever heard
Zane Gonzalez missed kicks from the east, to the west, back to the east, baaaaaacccck to the west
Try being a Bama fan, we can't find a kicker to save our lives.
"0:09
What is the name of that song?"
Mmg
Rodrigo on the cover â¤ï¸ðŸ–¤â¤ï¸ðŸ–¤
Happily, as a Ravens fan we have Tucker.
Was papa there? Or known as MMG
Who actually dislikes KTO videos??
whats your intro song?
You should do biggest NFL jumps of all time.
my dad
Ahh kickers...
Damn, you are so awesome man, keep up the great work
Hot rod
Any real Browns fans know Phil Dawson is the GOAT
Who's the kicker with the handlebar mustache. I must know.
"Oh man sometimes middle of the pack kickers will hit some ridiculously long kicks 
(Andrew Franks 2016 @Buf)
Or the fact Cody Parkey has literally been winning Miami games since 2016 and he was only on the Dolphins for the 2017 season
(16â€™ CLE @ MIA, 18â€™ CHI @ MIA)
Kickers are really crazy at times and you canâ€™t really judge them because they will continue to surprise"
Back when Phil Dawson was actually good
KTO's Flag Football team > Entire Bucs Team
What's up Karsten Mayfield? Tree says hi.
As a Raven fan let me tell you The KICK-SIX was waaaaay Better ðŸ˜‚
Phil Dawson was the greatest kicker the Browns have ever had!
Glad you came to my hometown!!! Hope you enjoyed downtown.
KTO youâ€™re such an awesome YouTuber.
As a georgia fan, Rodrigo is my favorite Georgia player all time.
"I immediately thought of you for both of those heartbreaking browns games earlier this year lol

As an FSU fan it's weird seeing how bad Aguayo turned out as it just seemed like he couldn't miss in college. His younger brother is currently really struggling, so maybe he'll be good in the NFL? Seems to be how it works heh"
Don't say the Bengals suck you freaking idiot in then i will unsubscribe to you and plus they suck and if you even think they're going to win the Super Bowl you thought wrong cuz you're dreaming a little bit too big
Being a Browns fan canâ€™t be easy or fun. But if it makes you feel better, Iâ€™m a die hard Lions fan. We share an unfortunate record together. But true fans donâ€™t care about their teams records. Youâ€™re a fan no matter what
You look like a npc form bully
BRUH MY TEAM 0:49
The refs are still against us!
Who else is here before 1000000000 views???
Kto is my dude
will you make a vlog about the trip like UrinatingTree?
Iâ€™m a bears fan but that was bad ðŸ˜”
4:18 until Vinatieri breaks it in a few weeks
The dislikes are kickers
Memphis is a kicker factory, between Stephen Gostowski and Jake Elliot theyâ€™ve got two guys with a ton of power #stripeup
KTO you forgot one kick. Georgias PAT when Rodrigo Blankenship stopped and made it.
Yo you you should do a collab with MMG now that youâ€™ve met him
Justin Tucker is the kicking GOAT
The 1980s: still proving that cocaine made everything you like happen
Ive never seen a channel more loved and appreciated more than KTO. Great job on your videos dude. Keep it up.
Was mmg there?
I know you get music from Epidemic Sounds, but does anyone know the song titles of some of the songs he uses??
John Madden jinxed the f*ck out of Gary Andersen
What about crosby
"Hey KTO. 

Can you do a video about Non-Americans playing In the NFL? I would like to see It one day."
KTO, your videos are awesome dude.  Keep up the good work!
"We can't really trust kickers anymore. 




I even worry when Dan Bailey goes out on the field."
Did you meet MMG?
Im a kicker and I love it. The anxiety is real, but in the end its fun
KTO has been in the facility with MMG
"Nate Kaeding has a nickname when he played with the Chargers






Kicks Ass Except During Important NFL Games"
Kickers are people too
Last winning season the browns have had 2007 10-6 never forget my guys Derek Anderson jamal Lewis kellen Winslow and Braylon Edwards... but thatâ€™s back when the browns had one of the best special teams units in the league with cribbs Dawson and zastidul
Ahh kickers the nerds of the team
hell just watch the 57 yard kick matt bryant made against the buccaneers that ended up with HAMSTRING INJURY to see how important kickers are
5:47 fucking evil
Such good editing, always much respect KTO
That ending was actually insane
HELP WANTED:kickers
Browns really need to draft a new kicker
Wait@kto, were you there at the same time as MMG?
what position holds the ball for kickers
KTO to replace blake bortles
Dak
Apparently Zane was playing with a torn groin against New Orleans
Karsten rodgers
Dark to the future
The Browns' kick 6 is one of my all time favorite plays. LOL
Loved the video
I live in dallas
If you want the black guy with dreds youtube itâ€™s flemloraps
Punters are people too...
Gary Anderson still haunts us today
You see Rodrigo Blankenships extra point a few weeks ago when the holder bobbled it and Hot Rod stood there and stepped back a foot and just swung his leg and made the extra point? That was some impressive stuff.
You were there too? I was watching UrinatingTree's video...he's great! :3
Kickers are people too
You played flag football with a Bengals fan and a yinzer? Does seatgeek exclusively sponsor fans of the AFC North or something?
Kickers are the deciding factor between a couple games every yr for teams... just this past weekend, a chip shot 37 yard miss by Washington cost them the game vs Oregon and basically ended their season
Heyyyy any got football practice today
Mmg went there to check him out
Bro the game is fixed
Rodrigo Blankenship is a god
You didnâ€™t even mention the only 1st round kicker. Smh
Do a vid on your thoughts or criticism on roughing the passer this year
Adam Vinny best kicker ever
The picture of them in Dallas, is one of the greatest photos, that I thought Iâ€™d never see, it was honestly beautiful
The Moral of the story is cocain is one hella a drug
Not as bad as the Vikings ðŸ‘ðŸ»
should have shown rods no run up kick
I miss Phil in Cleveland. The only bright spot on the team for years.
I know special teams players rarely get in, but Vinatieri should be in the Hall of Fame when he retires. IF he retires.
This was a fun video
"Zane Gonzalez!!!! I would rather be best friends with Nichole Brown Simpson than have you as my kicker!!!

Wait wrong channel..."
Morton and Gary Anderson are actually brother's in that Vikings Falcons 98 game!
Do a vid on Herschel Walker because as a Georgia player I don't think there was a better player in college football history
Adam vinatieri is my friends uncle
ðŸðŸðŸðŸ
I wanna 1v1 KTO one day. I just wanna see if I can man coverage you lol.
Nice vid, I'm kicker in my junior football league
YYEESS AANNOOTTHHEERR VVIIDDEEOO
That feeling when the browns should be 5-1
Get him more subs
â€œyouâ€™re only as good as your kickerâ€ tell that to alabama!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Thank god the Browns got rid of Zane Gonzalez
Wait thats really 5 point vids, damn
You know he had to do it em
KTO You a goat. I am a razorback fan and its been tough the last 8 years, but we had a kicker named steve little who kicked the farthest field goal in ncaa history.  The story that happened with him was so sad.  He became a parapelegic the night after he got cut from an nfl team.  No one here will remember that unless they are 40+ years old but it was a different era
Yeesss! KTO uploaded, you know it's a good day
as soon as i saw blankenship on the thumbnail i clicked, that man is the real goat
"Tree, Five point, KTO and Dallas Cowboys all in one (I saw UTs video earlier about the trip)

What kind of paradise Is that and how much are the tickets? And can I find them on seat geek? ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥ðŸ's"
Bruhhh seatgeek gave you the hook up. Looked fun as hell
I wish I could've played football with flemlo and kto
Make a video on Dick Butkus
KTO > Mariota & Carr
THE GODS OF SPORTS YOUTUBE
Calling â€œOvertimeâ€ â€˜Sudden Deathâ€™ is so much cooler
Where my boys from SOUTH DAKOTA AT?!?!?!? SDSU 4 LIFE!
I actually canâ€™t believe you made a kicker video and didnâ€™t mention Justin Tucker
One of the best channels on YouTube the absolute best football channel
Why'd you have to do this to me
Got to respect Adam vinatieri
Iâ€™m a bears fan =( this week against the phins shouldâ€™ve been a W
Kto is a BOSS
As a Vikings fan all I can say is that I'm glad you didn't put Blair Walsh in here too
Holy cow this is the best video Iâ€™ve ever watched on YouTube ðŸ‘
Was mmg there
Iâ€™ve been watching u for a while now and realized I wasnâ€™t subbed till now but I just did
The nfl Ball is bigger than college which is why they have a harder time kicking it imo
Video so fresh, he has Gostkowskiâ€™s game winner from last night.
Weird vid but still cool
Mason Crosby 1-5
Did you really have to bring up Gary Anderson?! And CARLSON?!!! WHY NOT JUST RUB IT IN FURTHER AND BRING UP WALSH TOO?!?!?!? STOP TORTURING US VIKINGS FANS WITH OUR LONG HISTORY OF KICKERS CHOKING!!!!!!! ITâ€™S CRUEL!!!!!!
Only the Browns. Haha
Hot Rod the god
Now punters
they should have 4 point kicks for 60 yards just to encourage people to do that
The Washington kicker saved the day against my Oregon duck hahaha
Cool
Thank you for not ending this with Blair Walsh.
Kickers are the goaltenders of football... except less athletic.
You should make a full video on the kicker that on mvp
Thought graham gano was in here with the 63 yard field goalðŸ˜‚ panthers fan
i love your vids keep up the work ðŸ˜ i am going to ude your code for seat geek for the detroit lions game when i go to one again browns are doing  good in my books this year keep up the good work ðŸ‘ðŸ™Œâ˜º
not having janikouski in the vid is a shame
"YEAAAAHHHHH IM NO QUITTER 

Someone pls continue"
Kto in his videos sounds like a dude who is like Andrew luck but when ever he's actually talking about football he just shit posts endlessly. He is amazing.
Kickers hate the vikings
Dicker the kicker
GOAT
Please no not Gary Anderson KTO :(
I'm a simple guy if I see a KTO notification I'm clicking
What was with players in the 80s and 90s making songs and having songs about them? The eagles and the fridge both have songs.
Kickers score more points than QBs.... think about that!
About time you did a video on a kicker haha
can you guys check out my stud or bust on bryce love i tried rly hard om in but its not doing very well
Kickers miss all the time! cough cough Browns cough cough
Rodrigo for Heisman
KTO your kicker in week two suffered a torn groin.

Karsten Mayfield
Love your videos bro
Robbie Gould was the goat tbh.
Hmm  a browns and yinzer fan together how'd that work out
I always see seat geek but never use it
I seriously hope that KTO has a collaboration with Flemlo Raps and maybe even The NBA Storyteller one day tbh.
You know who else is underrated? KTO.

Kto finally again.
Second
First
The title is a definite overreach. No mistake , a terrific, filthy slider, but not the best. During his playing years? Perhaps. For the last 5 years, Chris Sale, imho, throws a better slider. Two of the greatest to ever play the game.
Thanks lots for the video. :D
Would you get into a snowball fight with pitching great Randy Johnson?
Diamondbacks best pitcher thats why i have a RJ jersey
From a dbacks fan Randy Johnson has always been the GOAT
Also Full LEGIT.... Didn't need no Juice to get to the HOF. Him along with the Braves Pitchers and Chipper, Last ones you don't have thoughts in the back of your mind about.
Without the slider he would have been a below 500 pitcher. Anybody can time a Fastball.
Ever hear of Steve Carlton or Ron Guidry?
I'd legit be scared to stand against him in the batters box
WHAT A BEAST!!!
THE BIG UNIT
A bunch of these were curve balls
Reminds me of Sale's slider.
These guys re big leaguers and miss the ball by a foot
search up randy definition on google
HALL OF FAMER !????
I watched him pitch in veterans stadium as a kid. I remember it was the 7th inning and I was sitting right behind home plate and 4 guys had radar guns up a few rows in front of us. He had to know it was likely his last inning and he was getting clocked at 100-103mph on every fastball he threw that inning.
Have you seen the highlights of Steve Carlton’s? That’s the filthiest I’m sorry. Love Randy’s but Steve’s is better
Lou would've taken him deep to win the playoff for the Twins on one of those sliders if fucking Ken Griffey Jr. didnt Rob the homer
Chris Sale slider is more filthy imo. But Randy Johnson the most dominant pitcher I've seen in my lifetime.
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HIT HIS SLIDER WAS .......A BIRD ????
I hate sale. But I think his is better
JR Richard had a nasty slider that clocked at 94 mph
Steve Carlton would be a close second
J.R. Richard had the best slider.
Became a star in Seattle. Became a legend in Arizona.
Goose Gossage >
Since when did Johnson pitch for the Giants? I feel like I should remember that
It was a split finger
The split finger? John Smoltz The changeup? Greg Maddux. Fastball? Dwight Gooden. 4 seam? Mariano Rivera.
Do Kershaw curve Edit Nevermind
roblox death sound
The Big Unit at his finest
So glad I got to see this monster play in his prime. Definitely the meanest slider of all time. I remember that slump before he went to Arizona and then him coming back even stronger.
You have at least three repeats in here.
Steve Carlton, Ron Guidry, and Sparky Lyle have to be considered also...
If you can foul tip him, you’re probably a BEAST.
Pls do best 2018 walk up songs, loved the 2017 one
Why o' why did the Expos trade that guy... I know hindsight is 20/20, but damn, i bet there would still be a team in MTL had he been there in his prime
Watch a steve carlton video. No one will ever come close
The most unhittable pitch of all time.
I can’t tell you how many times I’ve typed “Randy Johnson slider” in the search bar... You’re a saint.
Honestly a top 3 starter
I hate that on most of these camera angles you can't even see the movement
Now that he is retired he still slides into DMs
See these are true sliders. They break a lot horizontally and some vertically. Most guys now just throw sliders the look like cut-change ups
When I think about those days all I can do is sit back and smile, as that was when sport was a sport. -----John Cougar Mellencamp.
IN MY HONEST OPINION, Chris sales slider is filthier
When my sliders pitched down from 9 feet 7inches high aren't visible from home plate. His mechanics trashed his body since he was a teenager. Mister Snappy is a joke compared the lightning terror pitches from hell which are not visible from the batters box. The world series teams coming up I could slaughter them with six outs an inning of a baseball game against both teams. Four games punkx
Degrom slider??????
Some stats and some explanations would have made the video better.
4:36 of nasty
I want to see the home runs hit off of this pitch.
It is confirmed: Randy Johnson is Chris Sale’s father
THE BIG UNIT. I miss that guy.
this isn't Andrew Miller????
And do "the best Cutters"
Threw at least high 90’s and had this, basically unhittable when he was at his best
Randy wasn’t human
Rumor has it that his slider is still breaking
The big Unit.
Randy GODson
All the steroids in the world wouldn’t be enough to hit that slider
Sale?
Do "the best changeups and curveballs"
Johnson had one of the best sliders ever, no question. Maybe the best ever, although I think Steve Carlton has a pretty good case too. Right handed pitchers... hmmn, think I'll go with Bob Gibson.
Why do left handed pitchers have this wide angle that makes the ball "swoop"...i cant put it into words.
I go to the same high school to randy Johnson
This video could be 3 hours long.
Notice no one snapping on the ump for looking 3rd strikes. Good times
Steve Carlton
Don't know which is filthier, Johnson's slider or his mullet
Adam Ottavinos???
Hall of fame pitchers vs hall of fame hitters
One of the best pitchers ever
Do a video of Kershaws 12-6 curveball and change-up
The wing span Randy Johnson had made that pitch start so far out or behind batters on top of that he had amazing break no wonder it seemed unhittable
Looks so effortless
I'd put Bob Gibson up there too
Wrong slider pitcher... BRING ME SPIDERMAN OTTAVINO
Denis Eckersley should be in contention
Dave Steib had a wicked one too
This is Chris sale before Chris sale
Max scherzer
Mr Snappy!
Garit coles slider is insane also
I just sub like
Randy definitely the slider GOAT Great to see more of these - such a wonderful pitch and always looked so damn hard to hit
my dick is the goat slider :O
best player ever bartolo colon
2nd place would probably be Chris sale
Hey great content keep it up
Smart play by Baez.......
Do homeruns out of stadium
4:28 doesn’t even show what happened...?
1:28 That's why u should always run on a foul
I’m confused what happen at 2:25
How were those high iq? Pretty sure people taught them to do that. They didn’t come up with it themselves. Look a base, let’s run around
Isnt 4:50 infield fly
2:06 am an amateur can someone explain this
What about Daniel Murphy taking 3rd on a walk in playoffs against the Dodgers?
Infield fly rule?
What about the infield fly rule?
The pump fake to first by Atlanta though....
Do most passionate players/ plays
Locain is the smartest player on the ENTIRE field!
2:48 this wasn't a high IQ play? I would argue it's a low IQ play. Bautista didn't have the situation awareness to realize the runner might try to go home. Nothing smart on Cain's part
Food baseball
Where is the in field fly rule for some of these?
How do you not have Utleys deke in the 08 World Series against the Rays?
@2:51 so how is this a high baseball IQ i just see a good base hit that resulted in a rbi
2:33 When the O's weren't hopeless and helpless.
Next do a low baseball iq moments
I'm noticing most of the "high IQ plays" on offense are just terrible defense
Several of those are just the umpire failing to call infield fly.
Hey Kids! This is how you win baseball games.
It would mean a LOT if y’all checked me out ??????
THE BEAUTIFUL GAME FOR REAL MEN.
Reminds me of when I played SS. Super stardom all the way baby, Praise the Lord for ALL my talents, gifts and abilities !!!!!!!
At 2:10, how does the infield fly rule not apply?
I do not understand this sportart
What's with the Holliday one?
Lady cow actually demand bone hunt entity vital grand successful iron.
0:32 where he go lol
All of these High IQ videos have the same plays
When I saw the title "Baseball High IQ" the first thing that popped into my head is "Javier Baez." Sure enough the first highlight features none other than... El Mago.
2:08 This was about Anthony Rizzo but I love it when lazy guys - Matt Harvey of the Mets at that time - get thrown out for lack of hustle.  There is no way this would have been a double play if Harvey had run out that bunt.  Rizzo is a an excellent player, he saw Harvey give up and stop dead in his tracks a couple feet out of the box, and played the double play.  Only after Harvey watched as Rizzo let the ball drop did he decide maybe he should be running to first.  You might think just maybe Harvey would want to protect or build on his 1-0 lead in the seventh against the Cubs.Same deal with Swisher at 1:23.
combination of smart plays, and inattentiveness by the other team...
Machado psyched the the camera man
What happen at 2:21 ? Oops.. I didn’t see the tag at third
Really nice plays here. BTW, in the video thumbnail, "Let's" should be "Lets", without the apostrophe.
Low IQ moments: ""Let's" ball drop"
Man, run to first...you’d think by the pro level, guys would realize this
RIP Fernandez
Do MLB best reads off the wall
I would have included the play on the sac fly where arenado leaped to cut it off and threw to third
2:47 - what’s the deal here? The base runner realized the throw was going to 2nd?
dude u really gotta fix ur audio
I have been watching since 1000 subs
2:48 WOW this is so smart !!
ALWAYS RUN HARD TO FIRST!!
Báez ??????
I tried to drop the ball at short and the ump yelled at me
I love these plays, it shows that there is still some players out there that play hard all the time and don't just take things for granted.
1:23 everytime i watch these videos i still try to figure out how that counts as an out lol
first
I saw that Miguel Cabrera inside-the-park "home run". It was hilarious!
Oof
I can tell u are a Sox fan , so m i
1:05 um this is actually the most beautiful play in baseball history
im surprised the astros vs pirates walk off error wasnt on here
i never understand how a pitcher can fuck up a infield assist.. you pitch 90+ mph for strikes but you can't throw the ball properly that doesn't need to hit 90
100% CRINGE??????
0:43 that one was probably the most cringe worthy one for me ????
Wouldn’t The last play be a close play if Castillo threw directly to home base?
so why are these called plays?
??????
??????????
"Here's the shortest throw you'll ever see ".... "Just missed the cutoff man by a little bit". That made my day.
Damn that Ian Kinsler for making us all have to watch a 7 and a half hour game of baseball.. smh
I’m a Sox fan and once I saw it was made 5 hours ago I just had to see if Kinsler was on there and sure enough, I was right.
I saw the first one live it was retarted my grandma could make that play
Never show that 86 world series play again
The thing is, we laugh but these individuals train for years and years to get this good. It could happen to ANYBODY..... ....except Manny, this stuff always happens to Manny :D
How is Ruben Rivera's base running blunder not on here?
Betance’s throw had to be the worst play I’ve ever seen
Castillo should hang his head in shame forever for that play
Click bait with Bregman
5:02 Scully is a national treasure.
3:12 Segura and Braun were both on the bag meaning Braun is out, HOWEVER, Segura comes off the bag to head back to first and gets tagged while off the bag and the ump missed it
Jayson werth losing it in the lights game 5 of the 2017 NLDS
Puig is dumber than a bag of hammers.
That first play tho. If Kinsler makes that throw, the Red Sox would have swept the Dodgers in the WS.
Needs more Ruben Rivera.
1:10 ... As a Red Sox fan, that clip hurts a lot less than it did 15 years ago...
The ugliest plays the last 20 years but not in history. A lot of missing plays here.
See its mostly infielders making theses plays??
everybody giving kinsler shit but look at what pedroia did lmao
As an Orioles fan I'm surprised there weren't more orioles clips.
No u
Should have had the two plays involving the Nationals in 2015 where a base hit got by the outfielder and then went all the way to the wall for an inside-the-park home run -- once as the team at bat, and once as the team fielding (same playing doing the hitting and then fielding too, IIRC).
Manny's play never gets old??
Slow roller gets me every time????
Definitely the string of errors from the Dodgers. U-G-L-Y. Hello again Made The Cut. I’m a proud subscriber, and also a Cubs fan
Commentators are kinda being assholes
I lost my mind as a Red Sox fan when Kinsler made that stupid error. Still world champs!
Im getting ptsd from the first clip lol
How the hell do you lose the ball while throwing like dude did in the outfield. Retarded
i jsut got here
hey made the cut!
Hail Donald Trump!!!!
First comment and hi Made the Cut!!!.
If you include "just not bothering to run" as a true outcome, Machado wipes the floor with Dunn.
ðŸðŸðŸðŸ
It's like a competition about who can be the laziest.
I guess I donâ€™t know anything about baseball, because I couldnâ€™t decide if they were saying he was good or bad
Get chart party going
Took clayshaw to the woodshed
Lmfao Barry bonds â€œ eating well balanced breakfastâ€ do you mean steroids ?
Breakfast actually means steroids...
"I just hit ground balls and run like hell
 

most of the time I somehow get to first"
I'm sorry, but the least Adam Dunn person of all time would be Juan Pierre. Someone who leads the world in the opposite of 4 true outcomes.
I don't watch sports, but this is great
Why is the music always so much louder than the spoken word!?
The vid not even attempt to explain what the heck happened to him against lefties from 2011 on. Did I miss something?
Adam Dunn, Dave Kingman and Joel younblood have a lot in common. Look it up
Standing around and getting paid= the average government worker.
Wait, what?
Fuck Pujols
I would like to see an all-time 4 Outcomes lineup.  Does Joey Gallo have the necessary credentials to make the team, or does he need a minimum number of plate appearances?
Damb that music gets annoying
5:41 He talks about how crazy it is that Dunn was so good against Kershaw, but at least Dunn was a very good player. I wanna know how the hell Brad Hawpe is 4th in career slugging against him.
Martin Dihigo had the weirdest career. Best player to never play in the MLB (because he was black AND cuban during the "no black people allowed" era of baseball.) He basically played every single position in all the different teams he ever played in. The most impressive thing is that he was good at every one of those positions. He has impressive numbers both at the bat and at the pitching mound. He played in 17 different teams in 4 different countries (USA, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela), sometimes he would spend the summer season on one team then go to another country on the other side of the Equator and play the summer season on ANOTHER team the same year (because, you know, summer is on December on the  southern hemisphere), then travel back up north and play the next year and so on and so forth.
At 5:40 is it suppose to be Gary Sanchez cause it says gabby Sanchez
Ah yes the big donkey being a donkey against Lefties
could alex keep speak a little quieter, or can yâ€™all turn down his mic? dude is gonna blow out my eardrums
Cool video. Very interesting about Dunnâ€™s 2011 season and just killing Kershaw.  Bryce Harper is turning into an Adam Dunn type player. Of course he is better than Dunn but his game is getting very similar. Look at their age 25 season which was Harperâ€™s season this year and their stats are virtually identical.
I love the content but câ€™mon guys can you possibly be any more monotone and uninspired? At least pretend you want to be there. Letâ€™s spice it up a bit fellas, I could use this to help fall asleep. Lol but seriously, great content just need some enthusiasm.
I have Adams bobble head for the bats in AAA
Disappointed I didn't see a clip of a player hitting a home run and driving to home base.
I kinda disagree with the pointless labor thing haha
I dont understand what they are talking about
Let's not forget that Adam Dunn's nickname was Big Donkey ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I guess playing injured is never taken into account.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
so this is cricket for overweight people?
Pujols is never gonna catch bonds on a team like the cardinals... needs to go to the Astros or something
Is there any science behind momentum in sports? I mean, when a team catches up from a 4-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth, you kinda have a gut feeling that they will keep the momentum and go on to win, and for me, that happens every time, whether I like it or not.
I worked at Adam Dunnâ€™s house. Remodeling business.
That Bonds joke. lol.
2011 was a terrible year for everything
Every person mentioned in this video is a roidhead.
Eather your intro is way too loud or your mics are too quiet.
"Nobody plays baseball for fun. They play because they are contractually obligated. 

And nobody... actually plays... when Adam Dunn is at bat"
Lose the annoying "music".
Versus, dude, versus.
Very Millennialish.  Full of oh-so-funny irony, and also very Jew-soaked.
I remember the Mendoza line being 192. And thatâ€™s without using google. Youâ€™re welcome.
Fun fact. Adam Dunn once had to sit out several games because he stabbed himself trying to open a package containing a movie.
Gaby Sanchez.
Why is this formatted like a religious apologetics video
Ate a well balanced breakfast lmao can't stop laughing at that line
I'm a die hard Reds fan & you guys definitely nailed Adam Dunn's career by saying weird. As much as that guy drove me crazy I always loved him. I kinda miss watching the Big Donkey lay into a baseball. He definitely had power. That's about it.
Can you balance the volume between the mic picking up and the intro. Ouch.
5:38 Gaby Sanchez ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
His divorce, which led to depression, which led to a lack of working out and eating unhealthy was a big reason why his 2011 season was so bad. He really never bounced back to the old Dunn after that.
"lol

Well I was trying to get likes but Iâ€™m not getting 5.3k cause Iâ€™m not MLB"
I miss dorktown
how about an entire team that stands around and does nothing, The San Diego Padres, the Cleveland Browns of baseball.
"*versus 
It's pronounced that way too... ""versus."" Not ""verse."""
"Something that occurred to me, it'd be really easy for any player with exceptional power to turn themselves into a ""3 true outcome"" player.  Just only swing at pitches you feel you can crush, and then swing as hard as you can.

Though honestly it's easy for anyone to turn themselves into the perfect ""3 true outcome"" player.  Never swing."
SB nation
yo the audio levels are all over the place in this video
"For a brief moment, they turn baseball into golf" lmao
Yo speak louder into the mic
Nice
Pretty good, but not PRETTY GOOD
Person on the right sounds like Tyler Joseph
The backround music sounds like an alarm
I donâ€™t have a ton of great memories from the Reds at the time Dunn was on the team, but one that has always stuck is Dunn hitting a walkoff grand slam to win by one run. Legend.
This guy in 2018 would be a 30 million a year man. Homers. .360+ OBP.  Lefty.
Incredible
three true outcome players make baseball boring though...
YOur like Rhett and LINK
Please please please talk about Joey Gallo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Itâ€™s honestly garbage and I donâ€™t know how people deal with it. And Iâ€™m certain it doesnâ€™t have any real advantage at all, 99% of the perceived difference is all in the playerâ€™s head because some streamer told them it definitely, totally makes them better. This game isnâ€™t nearly precise enough for a slightly larger hit box to make a difference at all, and even in games like CSGO, it still isnâ€™t going to mean the difference between getting a kill or not.
Home run, or a walk , or a strikeout
What about Jimmie Foxx? The fastest guy to 500 home runs (at the time) but ended his career as a pitcher.
Even without steroids bonds was a great baseball player
"Dunn was just fine in DC after his time in Cincinnati and Arizona.

Wish heâ€™d stayed there or at least in the NL. That emergency appendectomy took a toll before he even took a swing for the Sox but it was a disappointing last few years other than HRâ€™s."
where do they get their adderall
The three true outcomes players are ruining baseball but I like Adam dunn idk why just something about him I find entertaining.
versus, not verse
As someone who isn't interested in baseball at all, I'm surprised I watched almost all of this video. Kudos.
please make a video about mr joey gallo in the future
When Adam Dunn was a Cincinnati Red he not only hit the ball out of the park he actually hit it into another state. It bounced off of Mehring Way,( a street that runs along the south side of the stadium) then rolled down a slope into the waters edge of the Ohio River,  which is the state line between Ohio and Kentucky.
Adam Dunn reminds me of Mark Bellhorn. He had a similar tendency to be a true outcome "hitter". He was nearly a 50% true outcome in 2004.  He was really the first Sabremetrics impact player in the playoffs where a player with poor traditional stats (batting avg.) was effective on the right team and didn't break the bank.
Come on. Bonds took steroids
Strange audio mixing.
Mr. All or Nothing.
ADAM DUNN HITS DINGERS
I remember when the white soxs got him, I was so excited... then he started playing.
Coaches should have placed the infielders/ outfielders on top of the wall to give them a shot at catching a dinger Lol even though he had his fair share of 450ft plus bombs
I remember meeting Adam Dunn at soxfest a couple years ago and he was a great guy to meet but damn he had an interesting career
Also this guy retired because he couldnâ€™t bring his son into the dugout with him during games anymore
he had a huge dick too
Guys, you may never read this, but Adam Dunn had his appendix removed right after the very start of that season. In 2012 he mashed again. He didnâ€™t take time to heal.
Wgas?
The music in this is the absolute worst. It would be so much better without it.
So basically he was a predecessor to the modern game?
Bonds breakfast was one from the blue and two from the red pills..
kyle schwarber
well balanced breakfasts = HGH
You didn't explain the thumbnail
Barry bonds also took PEDâ€™s
Pinteresting
If Adam Dunn and Rickey Henderson ever come into contact, they'll annihilate each other and release an amount of energy sufficient to destroy the planet.
He is a hero, isn't he? ðŸ˜œ
Not that weird, Bryce Harper is doing a pretty good impression in 2018
would Fouling Out result in a 'True Outcome'? you don't have to run to first
â€œBut then thereâ€™s Dunnâ€
Xd Barry Bonds "exercising and eating well balanced breakfasts" cracked me up.
Iâ€™m a total math/stats geek an LOVE your guys videos! I often find myself looking up your stats and checking them for myself. Keep up the great content!
Can we get a re-upload without that god awful background music? I couldn't get past 3 minutes b/c of it.
I want to meet the 1.3K people that have disliked this video and simply ask why they didnâ€™t like it, cuz this shit is awesome
I feel like this video couldâ€™ve been made in about 2 or 3 minutes.
"Another Anti-Dunn is Victor Martinez, at just 23.6% (8000 PAs, 242 HR, 721 BB, 874 SO)
In 2015 alone, he got the number down to 19.4%"
Did he stop taking "roids" in 2011?
Didnt mention barry bonds steroid problem?
A 3-toed sloth? OMG.
DO MORE DORKTOWN
He also hit exactly 40HRs 4 years in a row
Awesome vid. How in the hell did he hit Kershaw that well?!? Also, Dunn was a pretty great athlete in hs. He was a 3-4 star recruit as a run first qb. Imagine that...
There was one season that Rob Deer didn't get his first single until September.
Bonds CHEATED He used steriods
why am i watching this? im english, ive never even seen a Baseball game
Again. You do not relate your topic with a player of that era.   How did he compare to Bonds?
This is gonna be Chris Davis
What happened to Austin Kearns?
LOL
Dunn was the prototype of the modern Home Run Derby player.  (they don't play baseball anymore; it's home run derby now).  As A Reds fan for 60 years, frustrated the hell out of me.  There should be a stat for how many times a hitter bats with a runner on 3rd and less than two outs, and see how many times Dunn got the runner home.  When all it would take was a ground ball to the shortstop to score a run, Dunn would strike out.  Typical year for Dunn was 40 home runs and 90 rbi.
This was amazing.
Anyone that not baseball fans understood what they were talking about?
Sad...
Between the two of you have you ever picked up a bat?
Purest 3 outcome hitter of all time.
The soundtrack now available on itunes
Ted Williams also missed all of 52 and most of 53
people say Americans are dumb. they should take a deeper look into their favorite sports. this could be taught as a subject in school. fuck me this is so complicated. and Americans understand it...
How could you NOT talk about his long home runs...dude has hit some of the LONGEST bombs ever...come on guys!  Has to be part of his story in every conversation...
That Rob Deer stat is amazing
Remember that time Dunn pitched the 9th inning?
Wow, you guys should think about entering data politics. Seriously, it would help Congress actually work and pass laws
You made an error, the home run king is Henry "Hank" Aaron, not Barry "my head grew 37 sizes" Bonds.
And he quit baseball because he couldnâ€™t bring his kid with him into work... talk about weird
Joey Gallo is going to give Rob Deer and Dunn a run for their money this year lol
1.2k statistical weirdos hated to press the like button!
Adam Dunn: stud AND dud?!
"Speak up, 'blonde narrator'! Sorry idk your name
But you're too quiet."
"versus
[vur-suhâ€‰s, -suhâ€‰z]

You can go here to hear the correct pronunciation as well. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/versus"
I'm not even a baseball fan and I thought this was hilarious.
hilarious.
This video is fuckin amazing.
Whatever we may say, he's one of the most powerful hitters ever. A terrific slugger in his prime
He sucked and he was great
You two should kiss
He's my step cousin so does that make me cool?
Steroids Barry Bonds went from speed guy to canâ€™t run HR machine
As a White Sox fan, fuck Adam Dunn. ðŸ˜‚
"9:00 made me burst out laughing.  
Oh to watch a game of two full teams of Adam Dunns... guess it's called the PGA tour."
GET A POP FILTER PLEASE!
Barry bonds roided. I know you were joking about the breakfast, but just wanna remind everyone the facts.
"From where your sitting, it probably looks like a 24k streak of bad luck. Truth is, it was rigged from the start."
Some of their comments are so dumb, people can say that about any sport. You obviously have to be athletic to play a sport
*sense
Baseball makes zero sens, LMFAO wtf
Some of those guys used steroids to get those homers
Well balanced breakfast of roids
This is awesome.
Bryce harper is quickly turning into adam dunn.
I just remember him and his damn kid with the White Sox. What an annoyance.
Here's a thing that could be done. How many home runs could Mark McGuire had should he kept in the game another ten seasons? Hint: McGuire had the best home run record per at bat in history. He averaged 1 home run  per 10.6 at bats. The next best was The Babe at 1 home run at just 11.7 at bats and Barry Bonds at 1 home run per 12.6 at bats.
This why I don't watch baseball
is it sad that i knew the answer to the least Adam dunn player ever?
I don't watch or know anything about baseball yet I watched the whole thing.
Lol dunn might of had a weird career but he hit some of the farthest home runs I've ever seen
this would be watchable without the creepy music
1:37 he took roids u dud
"You guys gotta learn to mix audio lmao
You almost blew my ear drums out"
I think most baseball players donâ€™t like to run
I can't watch this video cos the background music sounds like my alarm
How many people clicked on this thinking a player actually brought his car on the field????
Lets look at it like this: He had so much power and such a beautiful swing that all he needed to do was touch the ball a little for it to go over. Downside is that he was obviously visually impaired.
The Dude CARRIED 3 of my fantasy teams. I refuse to say anything bad about him.
Jon bois is nothing but consistent, alright. Every video he has a hand in has out of wack audio levels. That's Pretty Good.
Now compare this to Chris Davis' 2018 season.....
I never played baseball...
F
Ruth did it with hot dogs and beer. Aaron did it with class. Bonds did it by exercising and eating a well-balanced breakfast. ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…
Why are people disliking - pure unadulterated stats ? Literally the most non biased video on sports you could possibly get ... so people dislike the absolute truth - pathetic
Ahhh Adam Dunn. As a Nat, he was amazing. Here's a thought for you guys though, if they ever make a movie about Adam, who agrees with me that Will Farrell should play him? Seriously, they look so much alike.
I was watching spiders and Hornets fight and now I'm here. This was awesome though.
I farted
Iâ€™ve met this guy. Heâ€™s pretty cool
Bonds was Juiced
I remember booing him at US cellular
My all time favorite Red!
Also if they didnâ€™t sign them then what would happen when they played other teams idiots
They said that the other 7 fielders are doin nothing they actually are they have to stay in ready position unless itâ€™s caught a strike a ball a strike out and the outfielders and backing up the infield of a ground ball so are other infielders also the outfielders are moving to see if thereâ€™s a chance for a catch even if it looks like a homer there moving towards it
JON!
Note: Hank Aaron if the all-time HR leader, with 755. Bonds and his 760 doesn't count... How many of those HRs need to be taken away because he was juiced up and hit "illegal" HRs.
What's so weird about it? He was an all or nothing hitter... He's not the first, and certainly won't be the last. You know why? Cuz chicks dig the long ball.
1:38  Yeah, well balanced breakfast of Steroid-O's.
fun fact, he went to high school in my home town i knew several people who knew him, great athlete but huge ego. Hope he matured after going pro.
So, what what you're really telling me is I should exercise and eat a well balanced breakfast if I want to hit home runs...
I thought at the start of the video they were saying "The Story of Adidon" and i was like wait a minutes this was made on May first
Dude, fix your mics.  One is loud, and the other is barely audible. Normalize them.  And get rid of that crappy, crappy background music.  Itâ€™s crap.
Weirdest career only having to run to 1st base half the time? Never having to field either? Should call it the "smartest" career.
You mean he took damn steroids many years of his career
Man, sabre metrics are like a nerds version of classic art. It is simply amazing that you can take that much out of baseball stats when I can barely figure out the first 3 stat lines in the batting order from each team in the news paper. Well done lads ðŸ˜€
He practiced Satanic rituals.
"Well balanced breakfast"
lol eating well and balanced steroid/hgh %
you guys...
Adam Dunn was easily the worst outfielder and base runner (on the rare times he was on base) I have ever seen.
I can sum up Dunn's carrer in just 2 words.  Strike 3.
not a sport
So he is the best worst hitter??? Or is he the worst best hitter???
So what does this have to do with a car on the field?.....
The audio sucks.
dork
No way Albert catches Bonds. Not even close man
Adam Dunn went to my high school so this is pretty cool ðŸ˜‚
Your intro is way to loud
lol this used to be a COD team I was in.
Aaron Judge 2K17?
Subbed
Subbed
"HR, Walk, or Strike out -- very very true in his career.
500+ ft HR distances -- several of them  -- he didn't sneak them over the fence.
I think with Dunn, he knew the strike zone very well.

Dunn's operation -- 
1.  He knows when it's a strike
2.   But he can't hit it 
3.   But when he does, it goes out of the park a very long way.
4.   Subsequently,  he puts up numbers that nobody else can (or even wants to) match."
Next up â€œJoey gallo and the worst 50 homer seasonâ€
The video is awesome as usual, but the background music!!!! ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨
Awww man. I held onto such a sick twisted hope when the white sox got Dunn.
MLB players arenâ€™t really paid for their fielding.
Cool video. Also that was the best Bonds was on steroids explanation I ever heard lol.
So the point is Adam Dunn is a communist?
"Explain to the folks at home" https://youtu.be/5r9LsHF71UQ
"Well balanced breakfast" = Anadrol, Decadurabolin, test-400, etc
"9:26 
what do you mean by he's a hero and there's nothing more heroic? and the pointless labor comment?"
5:24 Madison Bumgarner is apparently good against Kershaw
Rizzo pounds Kershaw
"Well balanced breakfast"
Bonds. Steriods. Cheater. Fake.
Lol
This was extremely interesting. Good job guys!!
Madison Bumgarner up there casually slugging .500 against Kershaw
1:42 "exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast. Is that what they're calling steroids now?"
I really like this video, but I hate this music. I cannot italicize anything on my phone, but just imagine hate in the previous sentence is italicized.
Who in the hell has the time to sit down and figure this out.
An American hero
Gaby or Gary Sanchez
GOAT
Babe Ruth is still alive and I ask these guys to make a video on how that's possible.
It says gaby Sanchez not Gary
What happened  to hin
Bonds should be striped of all records no cheaters allowed
7:56 I love Judge and heâ€™s a great player, but heâ€™s going to be on that list one day lol
Adam Dunn is my favorite of all time. Going to the reds games was always exciting when he was playing because I knew there was a good chance he would hit a hr....or strikeout....but he kept it exciting
penis
"He started eating a well balanced breakfast" lmao yeah barry
we need a dorktown bar, where people can go to talk about the most obscure trivia.
i feel like these guys are the voiceover voices for a lot of videos I have watched on American sport.
"Come on guys Bonds only eats a hearty breakfast of Wheaties







And Steroids!"
My dad hated Adam Dunn (die-hard reds fan), said he only ever tried hitting homeruns
5:27 Gimme a moment... I'm just trying to wrap my head around how a guy was able to record a 170% slugging average
1:37 LMAO OOOOOKAY LETS GO WITH THAT....
i wish i could do half of what adam dunn...
"And that's without even talking about his defense.  I'm surprised you guys didn't talk about the 2009 season.  How often do you see a player notch 4 wins above replacement at the plate and manage to be a worse-than-replacement-level player?!

That whole Nationals outfield was one of the most amusing 3-ring circuses I've seen above the single A level.  All three outfielders had negative dWAR with Adam Dunn alone costing the Nationals a wopping 45 runs in the field."
Hmmm...I wonder how Dave Kingman compares.  He hit a bunch of meaningless home runs.
too much math for my hangover
Damn Kershaw is a beast
This is the video you show to your girlfriend to explain why you love baseball so much -- right (?)
â€œHe started exercising and eating a balance breakfastâ€ HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This background music is so unnecessary
Chris Davis would be able to put a dot even further on the outlier as DunnÂ in 2018 but he can't hit home runs any more.Â  As of now, 166 PA, 4 HR, 14 BB, 60 K.Â  78/166 comes out to 47%.Â  He was above 50% a couple weeks ago but decided to ground into the shift a bunch of times rather than swing and miss.Â  And the Orioles still owe him over $100 for the next four plus seasons.
1:45 Cough, Steroids, Cough
Rickey Henderson...hell yeah.
I love his name Jon Bois
I dont think alberts on the same nutritious diet Barry bonds was ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’€
The new series is good but I miss the dramatic music and incredible graphics of chart party.
This is awesome
Now Kershaw is straight doo doo
Would like to see it, but don't see Albert passing Bonds.  He looks like he is playing without his legs under him.  Shame. Still one of the Best hitters ever.  He has the most intentional walks of any other member of the  3000 hit club.
Bumgarner hitting .500 off Kershaw and has 2 homers
Two words - Herb Washington.  WEIRDEST. CAREER. EVER.
Adam Dunn: A true hero.
Pujols didnâ€™t take PH Drugs like Bonds did either
WOW! great stuff guys
Adam Dunn once went two calendar years without a sacrifice hit. In all the times he came up to the plate, not once during that perod did he hit a fly ball out that advanced the runner.
"You wanna talk all-or-nothing type players?

Two words: Dave. Kingman. Thank you and drive through."
That 40-100-150 Line May be broken by Aaron Judge right? I mean last year he went 52-127-208. This year he is on pace for 43-142-221 already tying for 2nd place on that list.
Rick Ankiel is up there...
The meaning of life is 42. Just read hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
"I don't even watch baseball, and I came here from a youtube channel talking about Ed, Edd, & Eddy but this was fascinating.

thank you."
I often wonder what sort of numbers Rob Deer would have had if he played now.  He didn't get to play as much because when he played, K's were frowned on,  Now, they're just a part of doing business.  Deer would have played more, and would have put up some impressive HR and K numbers.
Iâ€™m a White Sox fan and his 2011 season was horrible to watch, him and Konerko were suppose to be a power combo but Dunn was horrible, he came back and made the All Star team in 2012 though. Biggest letdown in White Sox history.
I'm waiting for the Henderson video.
Double dorks definitely
Less silliness please.
Donâ€™t forget the fact he didnâ€™t have a sacrifice fly the entire 2004 season when he hit 49Hr. I went to a ton of games that year, it drove me mad!
the music is horrible and distracting
Adam Dunn was also one of the worst defenders ever.
Enjoyed the video
the money saved is a bit of a stretch dont you think. i mean if there were nobody on the field then he could have took a different approach than to homer or strike out... like getting on base with a solid bunt down the 3rd base side... i mean there would be nobody on 1st for the pitcher to throw it too...
Honestly Dunn was ahead of his time. Hitters are trending more towards the "three/four true outcomes" and the launch angle revolution has everybody hitting more fly balls than they used to. Even his career strikeout rate of 28.6% wouldn't be that high today but was very high for his time.
Where does Jack Cust rank on the HR/BB/HBP/K rank on the list, especially when he was with the A's?
The LEAST like Dunn would be a high average, low power, low strikeout, low walk hitter. Ichiro, perfectly.
That chart completely disregards the number of games in each season, you should compare homeruns per game or per at bat!
Iâ€™m subscribing just because of this video
Jon Bois could chart and narrate the science of paint drying and I'd watch with rapt attention.
barry bonds joke was hilariously deadpan
Adam Dunn career was ruined by the infield shift. No that complex.
What they said about Barry Bonds made me laugh out loud in my classðŸ˜‚
And then there is our old buddy Barry Bonds who towards the end of his career learned how to work out (and ingest PED's)  to go along with a well balanced diet.
did you make a new one yet
The fact that Jay Bruce hit 2 homeruns in the same game against Kershaw is amazing!
cant be weirder than charlie sweeney.
For the first 3 minutes I had him confused with Aaron Boone
I like Adam Dunn and I don't care what anybody says and/or thinks. 'Nuff said ...
U WROTE GARY SANCHEZ WRONG AT 5 MINS AND 40 SECS
Two more things to add -   The guy had only 40 career sacrifice fly balls..   14 years, 40 sac fly balls..   Also he played over 2000 games, and never appeared in a postseason game
He also got randomly dissed by a GM of a team he wasn't even on (Toronto) on some radio show when a caller mentioned him as someone they could trade for. The GM went on a tirade about how Dunn was basically a beer league caliber player. Then claimed he called Dunn to apologize but Dunn said he never did. Strangest thing I've ever seen.
So where's this Ricky Henderson episode??
What on Earth was that thumbnail
Dad always said he had a piano strapped to his ass when he would run
Jon Bois is the only person who can make baseball interesting
"Weirdest baseball career since the inception of the sport" - lol and we forgot all about Rube, would up and chase fire trucks mid game.
:')
baseball is alout more than you guys think I play AAA baseball so im not the best but I know baseball isnt just duing nothing
Bonds is the GOAT. Pujols exercised and ate just as much breakfast as Bonds. Just like everyone else in that era. There's is/has/always will be guys who are much bigger than Bonds who hit way fewer home runs than him. But Bonds was a jerk to the sports media so a bunch of pencil necked jagoffs who couldn't hit a 75 mph fastball are getting their revenge. He disgraced the game? No, a bunch of hacks who names no one knows keeping him out of the hall of fame is the disgrace to the game.
BOIS
Very well done! Great dimensional analysis and hilarious conclusion. Loved the balanced breakfast jab.
exercising and eating "well balanced breakfasts" XD
these guys know nothing about the game. this is pathetic.
Joey Gallo is basically the Adam Dunn of this era
Haha, "Poo holes"
I LOST IT AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY MLB TEAMS WASTED LMFAO
The Mendoza line is .220.  Just thought you'd like to know.
This channel is phenomenal.
Gotta love Big Donkey
"Adam Dunn? If you're watching".  The end of civilization.
Well balanced bowl of roids
This was great!!
Could you guys turn the volume up a little on your intro card? My left eardrum didn't quite explode.
All fastball hitters hit Kershaw well just look at the list itâ€™s not perplexing at all
did you really do one on Ricky Henderson, or was that a joke?
LMAO 1:37
As someone who lives in Baltimore, I feel like Chris Davis has got to be somewhere high on that chart of the 4 outcomes
What a great video. I love doing nothing, its my favorite thing to do. I could have been an infielder for those 55 games, i woulda been great at it.
That was awesome!!
This is good. Your sound mix sucks
Adam Dunn was always one of my favorite players. He either walked, homerun, or struck out. This video just reinforced my opinion.
Every Jon Bois video has the loudest intro music on the face of the planet. It's literally twice as loud as his speaking voice.
I have no idea about baseball. I only watched this video for our Lord and Saviour, Jon Bois! Hail Jon!
Hank Aaron??
Bonds started exercising and eating a balanced breakfast ðŸ˜‚
Guys please turn down or choose less distracting background music. Its particularly distracting 230-245
If you not going to insult the guy you don't need to apologize.
This was pretty good...
WTF was up with Eddie Mathews in 1964?
is he good or bad haha
I read somewhere that Dunn actually made a legend come true.  Playing for Cincinnati, he hit a ball out of the park which, with the help of a parking lot and a concrete plaza rolled into Ohio river (which geographically begins the state of Kentucky).  Adam Dunn once hit a ball into the next state.
The background music had me in a wicked trance! Now I feel like a lubricated imbecile .. thanks
BONDS = ROIDS
Career .237 BA. 2,379 Strikeouts in 14 seasons. Sadly, he probably made more than $100,000,000.
These guys dress as girls
â€œExercising and eating well-balanced breakfastsâ€ lmao
interesting video
Barry bonds.. started exercising and eating well balance breakfast... you said STEROIDS wrong
The planetarium music really brings it all together
"Funny stuff.
That game where Jay Bruce homered twice on Kershaw was an epic Sunday night duel Homer Bailey won 2-1, in a weekend sweep..."
Porter Texas baby
Between a drunk penguin and a blind sloth? Thats still better than me.
how about some Dunn highlights fellas?
Great video, terrible sound editing.
Fans in Cincinnati used to ream the crap out of Big Donkey  because he sucked in left field and struck out alot. He made Manny Ramirez look like a gold glover.
Nice to see rizzo at the top of that lefties vs Kershaw list
it was fun playing with adam dunn on video games especially when he was with the reds
So wtf happened in 2011???
Watching this while drunk as fuck
VERSUS not verse.
that was good, thank you, i wouldnt even mind if you dropped the humor next one. the humor in this one was great tho
The quintessential all or nothing ball player. Good player,  nothing more.
Soriano and Rizzo tho
Barry never failed a drug test
He also has a Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club.
So like the mlb just lets players who were found positive for steroids or other enhancing drugs  keep their records?
Loved it
That's what Aaron judge is too
Bruh he from outside of Houston
This just proves baseball has a stat for every thing
Tim Kurkjian, Buster Onley, Jon Bois.
This music drove me bonkers
Donkey
i was at the game when Dunner hit his first home run, 2001. he had the kind of stroke that looked effortless when he made contact...............WHEN he made contact.   the rest of the time he looked like a little leaguer.....at the plate and in left. i'll never forget his walk-off grand slam against the indians
I'm in awe. Absolute unit
What if every baseball game ended in a walkoff??
Watching this video without skipping through it over and over is just not possible.
Fascinating.
HÃ¤? Can anyone explain what these numbers mean?
Lmao pujols is natural bonds wasnâ€™t wouldnâ€™t even compare the two
Barry Bonds is a cheater
Bonds was juicing dumbass I hope youâ€™re playing dumb
Dunn also played a lot of his career batting behind Griffey JR.
Well balanced breakfast ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚
Adam Dunn consistently hit 30-40 dingers every year.  You can't do that!
i hate baseball. and most sports.. used to come on and replace saturday cartoons.. bs
Bonds started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast lol,  nice
the barry bonds one at the begining cracked me up
Always hated players like Dunn.   I didn't know that stat vs Kershaw tho.  That's pretty wild.
Chris Davis must be in the four true outcome group...
Exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast...epic.
NO CAPES!!!
AKA The Big Donkey. his 2011 season with the white sox was the worst of any player that season. It wasn't necessarily his fault, management kept saying, send him out there he has to get hot one of these days. NOT.
5:22 I like how Bumgarner is at the top of the list against Kershaw
Ted Williams lost 5 years to military service, 3 in WW2 and 2 more in Korea
He refused to run after a ball in right field that he could have easily gotten to. Because he did not get to the ball it ended up a ground-rule double breaking a guys nose the section over from me.
I loved Adam Dunn. He hit 40 plus homers for 7 straight season. Give or take
Lol Barry bonds starting exercising more and eating a more balanced breakfast, thatâ€™s what caused hat size to grow well after his 30th birthday of course
Stupid music in the background, I couldn't watch it all
Adam Dunn was my favorite player growing up in Cincinnati. I cried when I accidently broke his bobble head the night I got it. He, to me, really was a hero, because he gave me an early love for baseball that I still have today.
Good video but i was expecting them to give a reason why. Why did his career fall off? Why is he a 3 true outcomes player? Why does he destroy Kershaw?
9:51 - 9:57 I wish someone would look at me the way Alex looks at Jon.
this video needs to just get to the point. why is he weird? bc he didnt run bases just hit home runs or struck out. the end.
Any speculation on WHY 2011 was such an outlier?  I literally thought that would be the topic of the entire video and it wasn't mentioned.
jon bois...MORE VIDEOS PLEASE!!
"Hi, Humans. Magic is as magic does. Does magic create more Magic? Does a fire make magic more magical? The flames from a fire, grow to a new form of magic. Everything magical leads to something without magic.

TERRANCE OUT"
Gaby Sanchez
Ah the steroid usage yes the well balanced diet
Bonds also did steroids
When is pretty good returning?
What was Barry Bonds eating for breakfast?
Not every strikeout means no running to first. Don't forget about dropped third strikes. But I'm guessing that he was so unaccustomed to having to run to first that he never beat the catcher's throw.
john 3.16
John Bois is my Waifu.
That was awesome
Adam Dunn became the prototyocal for.mlb now. Walk home run or strike out
gREAT aMERICAN bALLpark is a shallow low 404
BOIS BOIS BOIS BOIS BOIS
At 5:40 you put gaby Sanchez instead of Gary Sanchez
greater sound mixing. the sound effects are at least twice as loud as the speaking audio
"God, he could have broken that strikeout record. He was READY to do it.

When he retired, I was so upset for that reason."
Trending BAYBEEEEEEE
Bonds only beat the HR record because he used PED.
barry bonds didn't eat well balanced breakfasts, he just used steroids
RIP my headphones when the music came on....
Former CHATTANOOGA LOOKOUT! ðŸ‘€
I was a little disappointed in this, I thought it was going to take a closer look at his mysterious futility against left-handers.  Overall, still an interesting video.
"Creator of pointless labor." Haha
As a Reds fan, I have to love Dunn.... how can you not though...
"Baseball is the one sport where is you play it right, you don't have to do anything." That might've been the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
"Oh dear...I love Adam Dunn. And I love Jon Bois.
And now I get to listen to Jon Bois talking about Adam Dunn?

I'M NOT READY."
fucking dorks
After watching this I feel like I need to go sign up for nasa
And with this video, the entire "Nerds are cool" construct has been demolished.
"dunn was not only one of the best home run sluggers in history, but his walk ability (not shown in the video as it relates historically) also had him in the top-40 all-time when he retired.
here is one to ponder:
who was better at the primary concern for a baseball hitter, getting on base, between adam dunn and ichiro?
.364 dunn
.355 ichiro
you read that correctly. if you needed a guy to get on base, dunn was just plain better than ichiro. now throw in the fact that dunn had 460+ career homers in only 14 seasons, and it isn't even close. dunn was just as good as ichiro in getting on base AND had legendary power.
FACTS"
Are the hosts married to each other? Seems do.n
This video is so low key, yet somehow interesting.
joe panik clayton kershaw
Well balanced breakfast! ðŸ˜‚
I love the content, but the music is too loud
Bonds was juicing. He was taking PEDs. Bonds was taking Steroids. His teammates didnâ€™t congratulate him when he reached his big milestones, so that says something.
Gaby sanchez? Isn't it Gary sanchez
this is like.. my new favorite video
It's obvious what happened in 2011: Adam Dunn stopped exercising and eating balanced breakfasts.
If Jon is consistent wrong about everything then Iâ€™ve never been right about anything in my life
"5 singles + 1 double = 7 bases.




Sounds good to me."
If Dunn had spent his career as a DH he would've been a great, great player, bc his offensive value was tremendous. Endless walks and power. His defense - which was truly terrible, people think Schwarber who is actually mediocre rather than atrocious in the field is bad, they talk about him like he's Dunn, but no, Dunn was Dunn - was such a liability that over the long haul it significantly cut into his value. He still ends up a player with like 16 or 17 WAR but if you park him in the AL his whole career he plays longer and doesn't have the negative D value and is a 40+ WAR player.
1:42 yeah thatâ€™s what it was....
Exercising and eating a well rounded breakfast lol
One of the great natural sluggers of our time! Mr. Dunn, I'm sorry I greatly under-appreciated all you did for the sport
Jon Bois is the degree that separates Griffin mcelroy and Chapo trap house. Idk what this signifies
Albert Pujols is probably the best Homerun hitter
Will Ferrell
Background music is terrible, ruined video.
this is amazing
I miss chart party
Hey it's Jon Bois!
Can we go back to Chart Party?
â˜º
Standing around doing nothing 90% of the time is the definition of baseball.
He should be arrested for the money he stole while in Chicago
Gaby sanchez
What a video
Slugging percentage does not properly weigh extra base hits....
Iâ€™m shook
Barry Bonds "started exercising and eating well-balanced breakfasts"  hahahahaa
Who's Gaby Sanchez?
Stat nerds. The least fun nerds
Hysterical!!!!
Barry Bonds started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast towards the end of his career lol!
Please say the entire word "versus," not just "verse."
Good gravy.Â  I finally ran into a guy who's wasting their life more than I am.Â  Wait!Â  TWO guys wasting their lives more than I am!
He was my favorite player when I was a kid.
This is beautiful.
The fielders were hardly pointless.   If you remember later in his career,  they were all stacked on the right side of the infield.  Since I don't consider a Bb and hbp to be a different outcome,  he really had 4 outcomes.  Walk,  strikeout,  hit directly into the shift or homerun
But why did he start sucking?
This was great. You guys have entirely to much time on your hands. Lol
Hahahahaha exercising and eating well balanced breakfasts! Love it!
Ted Williams lost 5 years to war basically. 3 to WWII and 2 to Korea. He hit 13 homers in just 37 games in 1953.
What is this spa music?
CAN YOU MADE ONE FOR SADAHARU OH? HE CLOBBERED 106 MORE DINGERS THAN BONDS.
As a Brewer fan, I never expected ROB DEER to be mentioned in these videos.  Well done!
Aaron Judge was a Four outcomes player last year.
Bond's "Well balanced diet " should be recommended for everyone.
" E X E R C I S I N GÂ  A N DÂ  E A T I N GÂ  AÂ  M O R EÂ  B A L A N C E DÂ  B R E A K F A S T . "
The neckbeard ruined him
lol
"Speaking for myself here, I played the game up to 92.  My last game that I played was in Cooperstown over Fall Ball in College.  Now during my short but very satisfying baseball years I dominated one particular HS baseball team in Upstate NY.  I had more success over that team than lets say half the teams I had faced. For some reason I hit more Home runs off their pitchers and all I can say was that at that time I could see the ball better, my batting stance was corrected by my father before the season began and it paid off.

Now just guessing here, and not relying solely on Advanced Matrix to try to define the game is that in the case of the Dodgers Ace vs. Adam Dunn perhaps he saw the ball better off the Lefty than others.  It could be the Arm angle of the pitcher where Adam could see the ball better.  There are so many dam factors on why he could dominate one pitcher vs. the rest.

Do you know if Adam and Clayton played before, perhaps in College?  So while it might seem odd to you, for those who played the game even at the HS and College Levels we can tell you that the story of Adam isn't that strange to begin with.
I'll give you this on your opening;  BABE would have hit over 800 if he didn't pitch first.

Now for your comment on ""Pointless Labor""  it's comments like this that makes me believe you never played the game."
He was the chosen one!  It was said he would be the strike out king of all time!  You retired to early, I was counting on it!
Funny story about Dunn. My hitting coach played with him briefly in Chicago. Dunn went 0-4 with 4K in spring training. Came back to the dugout and looked at the sky and saysâ€that fucking sucked, oh well. Still a millionaire.â€
I got to watch Dunn play single A ball in Dayton. he was freakish even then, his balls would leave the park regularly.Â  After he left the Reds Is when I saw a decline though.
I remember when he was on the nats. I was listening to the car radio. "A routine flyball... and dunn cant make it to the ball"
The meaning of life is 42.
Lmaooo that bonds comment
How many of those strikeouts were dropped 3rd strikes?, which would require fielding.
I donâ€™t even like baseball why am I here
my first ever mlb game i was 11 years old, ill never forget, it was Cincinati  at  Phillies, and Adam Dum hit 3 home runs in that game
Also lol
Nice, that was a great rundown.
Judge was 392/678 that's 57.8%
"How about judge
52hr 127BB 208k"
I like you dorks because you're cool and like baseball. You forgot one thing in your equation of 54 games- the outfielders craning their necks as a Dunn -hit baseball sailed high over their heads into the bleachers. HRs can't be factored into the equation of watching a game where no ball is fielded because HRs are exciting.
I'm coming around on this format. The three of you have really great chemistry.
Hey back in the early days of the Washington Nationals Adam Dunn was one of the coolest if not the coolest thing about the team. He was the "big donkey"
5+1=6
Like kershall and Dunn were bffs before MLB and they said when I face you let me hit good
1:41 Right...
White Sox fan. I remember how bad that Adam Dunn season was.
One problem with your idea of wasted money on paying guys not to field: in baseball, position players are paid to hit, not field. Iâ€™m a Red Sox fan. Do you think Jackie Bradley Jr. will ever make what J.D. Martinez makes? No. Yet Bradley is a far better fielder than Martinez but canâ€™t hit a lick (except for the occasional Eutaw Street shot). Good hitters who are bad fielders are forced to play the field (well, unless youâ€™re David Ortiz), so yeah, Iâ€™m not buying your point there...
Barry started exercising at the end of his career? LOOOOOL if you kept watching this joke of a video after hearing that you are probably a Trump supporter.
â€œHe started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfastâ€ lol Barry loved his breakfast
Slugging Pct does not "properly" weight extra base hits.  It weights them, yes, but wOBA is the one that does it properly.
Joey Gallo is the first major leaguer to reach 50 HRs before 50 Singles, he struck out 300 plus times already, talk about all or nothing.
You remind me of jim from the office
Joe McEwing owned the big unit Randy Johnson, at least during his Mets tenure.
Love Jon.
Exercising and eating a healthy breakfast. I'm weak
Man that Kershaw stat blew my fucking mind
i couldn't play with a guy like dunn, he would drive me nuts, the number of runners he left stranded must have been high too.
Sort out your volume levels!!
Your full of shit about Barry Bonds. He was on roids!!! Started working out and ate a well balanced meals lol!!! Your a douche!!!
I at least wanted some theory of why.  Was it lefty vs. lefty yips?  Did his contract with the devil expire?
"Are you looking for more great content like this? That's good. Hope you find it. Bye." - Jon Bois' best sign off ever. No sub begging, gets 200K views and 247K subs anyway.
I donâ€™t even watch sports but damn this was interesting
What is the name of that music in the background?
Can't wait for the Rickey Henderson episode!
8:23 - 9:45, one of my new favorite Jon Bois moments.
Weirder than Jeff Franceur?
Great video. Interesting
When Dunn was with the Dayton Dragons (A) I saw him rob a home run.
Also, if the umpire calls infield fly rule, then the fielders are unnecessary, except for just being on the field for the rule to apply.
Adam dunn is my life goal ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
The first player to ever hit a home run into another state!
O
1:45 AMAZING description of Barry Bonds! Nice work, fellas....great video!
Barry bonds also used steroids ðŸ˜‚ you forgot about that
Adam Dunn went to my High school New Caney High school
How does the clock jump several hours in the middle of the episode?
That balanced breakfast does it
just sent this video to the dunn family - I know adam's dad, the sheriff of a town near me - gonna update this comment on what adam says
I have a practice used bat from Adam Dunn
JON BOIS
Russell "The Muscle" Brayan is another good 3TOs player.
"He started exercising and eating a well balanced breakfast" ..... LMAO
5:32 Gaby Sanchez?
I can only laugh lmao the only memory I have of Dunn running is absolutely running over a catcher at home plate like the 18 wheeler that he is
Lol I have a Adam Dunn White Sox jersey. He was my favorite player.
Will Pretty Good ever return
Ground rule double is a true outcome
JON
Did yâ€™all factor in dropped 3rd strikes that ended in strikeouts were he had ran to first instead of getting tagged at the plate? I wonder if There would be enough to skew the numbers to below 50% of not running to first.
You had me at Rickey Henderson.
Ah, Jon Bois and you're goofy, charming editing
yes, Ricky Henderson is the antithesis of Adam Dunn.I was recently comparing statistics of Th Cobb(who's been my favorite player since I was a little kid), and looking at some of Henderson's records(especially in regards to stolen bases) are just mind boggling. in many of them, he is just miles beyond the next closest competitors.
awesome video.
I remember Adam Dunn got booed all the time at the Cell
MLB never wanted Adam in the ALL STAR HR Contest.  He would have kicked Bondsâ€™ roided ass EVERY time.
wheres the fuckin car
As a Reds and Adam Dunn fan. Thank you for this
please do jeff locke!
Legend has it that Adam Dunn was also a very good basketball player capable of dunking, and was recruited by Mack Brown (as a quarterback, not a safety)
Gaby sanchez?
This is the best version of this show keep it like this.
Who here doesnâ€™t even watch baseball?
love this
Gaby Sanchez?
Kershaw just felt bad
Aaron judge is going to kill these numbers
Wow
I only clicked on this video because of the terrible Photoshop on the thumbnail
JON BOIS
this was published may 1st.....but you show a picture of pujols as a card. LOL
No google earth? or was it just extremely subtle :(
9:36 "He's a creator of pointless labor." ....... Yup. I'd say the guys who made this video know a thing or two about pointless labor.
" Barry Bonds started eating healthy"?!?!? He started juicing on steroids you morons
.074 batting average? That sounds like my entire little league career... might even be a little high
S T E R O I D S
How did you not mention that Dunn had four seasons in a row of exactly 40 HR. Such a satisfying stat line. Such a minor complaint though, I friggin' love anything Jon Bois does. Great episode!!!
Great video
Way to ruin shit w analytics. Nerds
"His 4 years in Chicago he stunk up the place.

In 2012 he was AL Comeback Player of the year for batting. 204. He won because he stunk in 2011 for hitting. 159.

When he did hit a home run it was a pointless shot.

If he came to bat with RISP and 2 out, it was a near automatic strikeout. 

He struck out 704 times. One season he didn't play for most of the last 2 weeks of the season. Supposedly an injury. Most people thought it  was so he wouldn't set record for strikeouts .

Everyone was so happy when he left. Wish we could have gotten more for the  $64M he was paid."
talk quieter please...
Adam Dunn is da real MVP.
lmao that's great stuff, absolute nonsense
"Ted Williams missed more than 3 years in the military.

He flew in Korea and missed games from April 31 1952 to August 1953"
hit AN home run?
Please...stop the willy wonka music. Great video though
Barry Bum Bonds
Of course he started sucking right when the white sox got him.
Your lighting fucking sucks
I got drafted by Stl., and although injury prevented me from making it up to the majors, I played a while in the minors....so I know my shit. And let me tell you: For a RHP like me, a dude like the Big Donkey presents a pressure situation. On the one hand, locate some good pitches and you can earn a K. On the other hand, get too much plate with a dick-high fastball, throw a flat change, throw a frisbee slider or spin a flat curve and The Donkey can snap your head straight backward and send your manager to the bump with his hand out and palm open.
Rickey Henderson says that Rickey Henderson can't wait for the Dorktown about Rickey Henderson, cuz Rickey Henderson ain't no Adam Dunn!
I don't know if this is just for this video or what... but please turn the audio up on your microphones!
where is Jon?
When they said "least Adam Dunn", my immediate guess (before they said the name) was Rod Carew.  One of the weirdest ever stances, but his BA proved he was right.
I'm gonna watch this video every night before bed because I have trouble sleeping and I think this will help
He was certainly the bright spot on some very bad Bowden-era Nats squads.
You guys gotta fix the audio. I keep changing the sound level when the different guys talk.
I really wish he had played a couple more years...just because
Uhmm... I donâ€™t really get the point of this video
I might be preaching to the choir since I see a lot of fellow die-hard Jon Bois fans... but seriously you need to go check out 17776. Like right now.
dropped 3rd strike? catcher & 1B needed for this, eh?
Baseball sucks. So boring
Every time I thought they were going to go into something interesting they moved on. Iâ€™ve never been had a video leave me with a more empty feeling
lol
This isn't chart party
Pujols needs to start taking more vitamins to make sure his line doesn't cross other peoples' lines. Crossing lines is not fortuitous!
Is this the Bon Jois everyone's always talking about?
Anyway twist yield God disaster head relevant influence plain climate sauce
HOW do you not mention he went from the most home runs in the NL to the most strikeouts in the AL in 1 season lol
I wanted to hear more about his 2011 season...
Bonds and Pujols are steroid users.
Well this was stupid.
Video does not go anywhere
He was from my home town we went to the same high school
Jon looks like Freddie Freeman
I thoroughly enjoyed this video, and can't wait for the Rickey Henderson counterpoint.  I also wonder how Ichiro stacks up.
I enjoyed the conversation. Everyone in a three-mile radius of my speakers enjoyed the theme music.
Only Reggie Jackson and Jim Thome struck out more than Dunn...and Reggie had 7 more years and Thome 8 more years than Dunn did. Only early-career Mark Reynolds keeps Dunn from having the most strikeouts in a season. Right now, it'd take Reynolds 573 Ks to catch Dunn, and seeing as how he's currently not in the majors, but with the Syracuse Chiefs, it doesn't look like he's gonna get that chance, especially since he doesn't have the power that Dunn did.
JON BOISSS
What about the Rube? Isn't he weirder?
Work on the audio levels please. the music is blasting, but i can barely hear you two talking.
"Breakfast" really had Barry Bonds smackin the ball huh hahhaa
Google Earth must be updating...
Big Donkey!
Not all heroes wear capes, but this one happened to wear a cap.
My favorite Adam Dunn moment:  when Dusty Baker told him to bunt and Dunn said ... "We'll just see about that."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE0R3O1-xGE
Haha. We win. They let Bois out of his cell!
I'm a big baseball fan and this was a truly extraordinary video. Well done, boys.
I knew Dunn would be statistically weird. And you guys really talked him up. But my God...I never expected this
Love the context of the video. Did not like having to adjust the volume every 30 seconds. Get an audio engineer or fire the one you have lol
Lmao breakfast of roids
"Where is did chart party???







Really tho John bois is my favorite YouTuber ever"
God has returned
Very Good Video
RICKYYYYYYYYYY
intro was super loud
"Just making sure I understood this correctly: Adam Dunn was absolute garbage against left handed pitchers during some time of his career. But against that one particular left handed pitcher who absolutely dominated left handed batters, he was exceptionally good?

Also, please turn down the volume of the music!"
It was interesting at the beginning but the end with the salaries was kinda stupid.
Why why why and why ??? Do you think playing the music in the background is a good idea ???
I need some john bois basketball
JON BOISSSSSSSS
Bonds started exercising and using roids
Where's Mark Reynolds on these charts?
Omg you totally made baseball make sense to me when you talked about the four true outcomes. Iâ€™m fine now. THank you.
And the other 50% were ground rule doubles
Baseball champion
Yeah... it was exercise and a well-balanced breakfast that was the reason Bonds hit so many home runs at the end of his career... that is just as likely as me shiting a leprechaun holding a bowl of Lucky Charms
I'm pretty sure Barry Bonds was doing more than just eating healthier and exercising.
Oh the reds....we are the Cleveland browns of baseball but still my home team. But hey we still got the cyclones and fc Cincinnati!
All Pujols needs to do to hit more bangers is go see Bonds' dietician and personal trainer, right?
The meaning of life is 42.
Love the video guys keep up the great work
Adam Dunn is the fucking man
where's jon
Ricky still hit dingers, but bruuuuuuuuuuuuh this gone be fun!
You can't fool me! This is Chart Party in disguise!
honestly great vid
Damn Bruce Chen gotta feel awesome!
"Kinda want pretty good back
:( but this episode was better than the first"
Great insights!
Anyone else notice Madison Bumgarner at 5:23? .500 SLG% vs Kersh.
Joey Vottoâ€™s game ages like fine wine.
Surely this is 'Pretty Good', no?
This was awesome
Dunn once hit 41 HR with a .204 BA.  Not to be outdunn, Mark Reynolds hit 32 HR while having a sub .200 BA (.198).
He also smoked crack but...
Much better. Actually bringing the charts from chart party into it! Don't make dorktown a budget chart party, you're better than that, Jon.
Gaby Sanchez
Hahahaha Bonds started hitting more homeruns because he started eating a balanced breakfast! Yeah, hormones balanced with steroids lol
Eating a well balanced breakfast!!!!!! Youre killing me Jon. HAHAHAHAHH!!
Adam "The Big Donkey" Dunn is the only player in MLB history to hit a ball across state lines. In 2004 smashed a ball off Jose Lima that left Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio, bounced off the road and into a section of the Ohio River that is part of Kentucky.
This year Aaron Judge has 132 PA, 1 HBP, 7 HR, 25 BB, and 41 SO. That puts him at 56% if anyone was wondering.
I am a simple man. I see Jon Bois in a video, I like.
I love your vids but the audio is always too low.
Jon Bois is the GOAT
Great video. Adam Dunn was my favorite Reds player when I was younger. Everyone thought he was terrible because his batting average was never particularly high. However,  after looking at his his stats today and putting more emphasis walks and slugging, I am convinced Dunn was one of the more underappreciated players in baseball. Dunn posted an OPS slightly above .900 during his eight seasons with a terrible Reds team. The only other Reds player I've seen to produce comparable hitting numbers is Joey Votto.
The AL eats people alive
Rickey Henderson is the real GOAT of baseball. Imo
Only like 4 years late on this topic but Iâ€™ll take it
PLEASE do more of these.
I feel that the fact that Bumgarner has a.500 slugging percentage against Kershaw needs to be noticed
1:42 by "started exercising" you really mean taking steroids.
This video was good, not Trump getting impeached good.
That Barry Bonds joke was hilarious ðŸ˜‚
This wasn't Pretty Good... but it was close.
You guys realize the word is pronounced verSUS, right?
His 2011 season he played 122 games with 11 homers and batting 159... that's crazy
You know, growing up watching Dunn, I always knew there was something different about him
Damn it now I'm going to have the scour the MLB rule book to see if there is any rule against players wearing capes.
The meaning of life is to live.
Make a Rob Deer video
Jon Boissss
Forgot about Gaby Sanchez. At first I thought it was a typo. Hhaha
Socialist slant at the end doesn't go unnoticed.
5:22 ayyy, jeff francouer made it to Dorktown! Say hello, everybody!
Return of the king!!
We want chart party back!
What's with the masseuse music
Funniest thumbnail Iâ€™ve ever seen.
What's The music being used in the background? Really liked it.
Like if you wanna give Jon a peck on the cheek
Thanks for checking on me dad.
Also hit the second longest homerun in Chase Field
He was great on the Nats, but 5 years later you might say his career was â€œDunnâ€
I am a Reds fan so I like Adam Dunn... He's getting elected to the Reds HOF this season...
Jon I love you but learn how to mix your dang audio
bro what r u guys talking about lol
Everybody should read 17776.
I once attended a baseball game when the Baltimore Orioles played the Chicago White Sox, and the whole time the 2 guys sitting behind me were just yelling at Adam Dunn, making sure he knew that there was an 18% chance that he would get on base.
Bois is just Ginger speak for BOSS
Adam Dunn was also pretty much the strongest player of his era. Check out his homerun distances.
I'm going down to Dorktown, the dork's a friend to me.
Jon has an amazing twitter
Bc anything with Jon bois is amazing so
Lol actually good I just like chart party better and pretty good. Will those return?
Remember the time Adam Dunn literally hit a home run into a different state
Rob Deer! My dad caught one of his home runs in the left field bleachers at County Stadium back in like 1992. He made the highlight reel on the local news, and I was so bummed out because I missed it because I went down by the Brewer's dugout ball hawking, bugging Mike Fetters for a ball, lol
Matt Adams homered off kershaw In 2014
THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND JON BOIS
Adam Dunn was the player that originally got me a baseball fan
"I still remember... ""The Nationals fortune rest on the broad shoulders of slugger Adam Dunn""
Great times..."
Adam Dunn was one of my favorite players when I was a kid.... now he's my hero
Wait...he hit 169%? He it 69% more than he was thrown? I don't understand baseball.
You have given us so much to like about this video! Thanks for posting! Alex's use of the word "verse" is like fingernails on a chalkboard throughout the narration. And the word you want is "versus." That change would make this video go from good to pretty good.
I wonder why SB Nation doesnâ€™t have more subscribers?
My all time favorite player lmao
Didn't Adam dunn hit a 535ft homerun
i see jon, i click like.
Anyone know the song that plays throughout? I really dig it.
this is............PRETTY GOOD
One ofbmy favourite athletes every guy made bank never ran put in minimal effort true hero and role model to all
SB nation is finally giving the people what they want
I love RH! Can't wait. The music sucks; make it quieter. I like these videos, because the absolute absurdity makes me laugh for 5+ minutes straight.
Pujols is what 38 he'll be 42 at the end of the contract he can still crank 17 to 21 long balls but 762 ain't happening definitely hall of fame caliber but he's at 619 and 4 years left in that 240mil contract i don't think he'll make it. Come on 4 years left i say AP finishes at 690 career home runs
Make Chart Party Great Again
The king has returned.
I had hoped that Adam "Mutant Will Ferrell" Dunn would stick around for two more years so he could break Reggie Jackson's strikeout record.
Do a video on the Rube.  That would make a pretty good pretty good episode
So by healthy breakfast he means roids
Hey Jon, Upload much?
More fun facts about Dunn, he is in two other rare list. One, he is one of the only people to hit an ultimate grand slam, a walk off grand slam weâ€™re the home team is down by 3 runs. Two, he is in the over 500ft homer club, where he has 2 of them. Since the Cincinnati stadium is right by the Ohio river and the Ohio river is land of Kentucky for some reason, Dunn hit the ball in to the Ohio river which means Dunn hit the ball into a different state
Like this comment if you want card show back.
When Adam Dunn started with the Reds he either struck out or knocked the cover off the ball.
YEAH THE BOIS
Always liked Dunn as a kid because i loved baseball but i only wanted to hit homers that was kinda his thing he either struck out or hit a bomb ðŸ˜‚
14,589th view 185th comment
"My brothers name is Adam dunn 

Not this person 
But has the same name"
I watched Adam Dunn when he played for the Reds.  I remember joking around that it was always either a home run, strikeout, or fly out.  Those infographics were insane.
I'm a reds fan. Adam Dunn almost drove me to suicide so many times.
Comrade Adam Dunn instituted the universal basic income
Here's a statistical outlier for ya - in baseball right now 12 out of 30 teams have a better record on the road than at home.
Adam Dunn is not watching , but continue
Posted on my 19th birthday! Thanks Jon and Alex!
I LOVE DORKTOWN (I did scream that)
Our messiah has returned to us!!!!
"Adam Dunn is a weird beast.
Thing is, in video games, he was a MONSTER. But he was just like real life: Jack, K, or Walk."
Adam Dunn was also only on only one playoff team in his entire career, the 2014 Oakland Aâ€™s that lost in the wild card game to the Royals. This was the last season of his career, and I believe he was the only position player for the Aâ€™s to not appear in the game. He retired soon after, never being able to play in the playoffs.
He signed my Emperors New Groove DVD years ago when he played for the Dayton Dragons. I asked him to sign my bat but he said he would only sign that DVD case.
jonnnnn
Who the fuck are these two hipster douchebags?
My sentence is: From groundouts to dingers.
Dunn sucked
You are doing the right thing
JON THE PRODUCTION QUALITY IS TOO HIGH YOU NEED TO GOOGLE EARTH LO-FI IT FOR US NEXT TIME
Dorktown is very good.
Great vid!
The other strange is Adam Dunn went over 1000 at bats without a Sacrifice Fly.  Dunn went the entire 2004 season without a Sac Fly.  How is this possible???
Kind of off topic... But who bought the season 4 battle pass
Chart Party Only. I don't like change.
Matt Carpenter owned kershsw
Adam Dunn was one of my favorite Reds players...
I like Adam Dunn.
The Big Donkey!
This was great. Can't wait for Rickey Henderson.
I went on a Wrigley Field tour about 10 years ago.  One of the visitor's clubhouse attendants told our group that Adam Dunn would eat 10 McDonald's cheeseburgers before every game.
Gonna be the same video about Joey gallo after he retires
Jack Cust https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/custja01.shtml was a 53.47% 4-outcome hitter
He went to new caney high school.
Ruth also played less games per season compared to modern players.
Great vid
Great video
I might be the only one but I liked the big lumberjack guy
Awesome series keep it up! Also all the Jon Bois stat shows are great too.
Regardless, it's always fun to watch a mammoth of a human being hit balls 500 feet
I love this channel.
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHART PARTY
Go Reds!
I canâ€™t believe he hasnâ€™t played a single playoff game
WHERE IS JON
"THIS WAS GOOD BUT NOT, PRETTY GOOD"
Is it just me or is the audio in the dorktown videos extremely quiet?
The greatest ambition any athlete can have is to have their story told by Jon Bois.
This was a complete waste of 10:28
Jon I thought your favorite player was Jeff Francoeur
More!
I miss chart party
I don't understand, why do you guys respect Bonds so much knowing he did steroids?
Make chart party great again
"I think Jon Bois knows when one of his followers is extremely sad. Every time I even contemplate my own mortality Bois is there to save me.

Thank God for Saturday College Football."
This was a show but it wasn't Card Show.
Geektastic.
Adam Dunn is the first, last and only dude BORN to play DH....
This is really cool and all, but where is chart party. I need some more smooth jazz in my life.
praise be
that was pretty good
I love it when Jon bois and Jon bois 2 come together to make a video
Rickey is my favorite player ever
Gaby Sanchez
This is one of my favorite channels on youtube. I love how detailed your research is on these stories. Keep it up! Can you make a video sometime focused around the mariners, or griffey or edgar or something?
Every one of these videos Jon makes is time hes spending not making Pretty Good and Chart Party
Jonâ€™s not dead.
So this is like Pretty Good but way worse
As a sox fan I can confirm he was unwatchable in 2011
Show is good. But itâ€™s the worst name ever given to anything ever.
Can y'all just make a playlist with every Jon Bois video so I know I didn't miss anything
HE'S BACK
Ah, that good old unmixed audio is just music to my ears
"""So if you think about it, Dunn's a hero. He forced baseball teams to pay guys a total of nearly seven million bucks to just stand there. He's a creator of pointless labor. There's nothing more heroic than that.""

Happy International Workers' Day! â˜­"
why do you keep putting people who arent jon bois on screen, i dont get it
I'm a simple man, I see Jon Bois, I upvote
Hi, the music is a lot louder than the rest of the show, if some leveling or other audio magic could be applied for future eps it would be very nice please
"there was this mlb player in the early 1900s who would wrestle alligators and follow firetrucks.
Heres a couple of his sites:
https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/waddell-rube
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Waddell"
"DORKTOWN!!!

YES!!!"
this is the best video about a single baseball player since your Franceour spotlight
Hail to the Bois!
This was good, hell iâ€™ll say it. This was pretty good. Also didnâ€™t touch on his power. Of the 10 longest home runs hit in the MLB 2 of them belong to Dunn. He hit a ball 535ft one time that started in Ohio and ended in Kentucky (look it up).
Please bring back Chart Party!
Jon Bois looks like a gnome from the side
WHERE'S JOHN BO...... Oh thanks SB Nation
Not as good as chart party or Pretty Good
I'm starting to enjoy these as much as Pretty Good/Chart Party. I hope the injection of other personalities and the added outside research and perspectives helps these come out more often.
I didn't watch this video but I heard it had Jon in it. Hey, Jon.
Where's chart party?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Adam Dunn quoted saying something along the lines of "I don't even like baseball, I only play because I'm good at it and I get paid a lot of money to do it" ?
Alex may be the mayor of Dorktown but we all know he's just a figurehead for Supreme Commander Jon Bois.
Jon Bois is the true hero.
"B O I S
O
I
S"
This was party but it wasnâ€™t chart party
Bois!!!
this is good...but it isnt...
welcome to College Football Saturday
I literally stop whatever I'm doing when I see that a video bearing the visage of Jon Bois has been uploaded to the World Wide Web.
Thank god you ditched that sad, brown couch.
Does this count as a Pretty Good episode?
If by â€œwell balanced breakfastâ€ you mean â€œinjecting himself with horse semenâ€ then yes.
B.o.i.s
You can see a preview of Ricky Henderson on one chart from their 8 runs on 9 Pitches (Fernando Tatis half-inning video).  The guy was an INSANE base stealer.
1:37 "he started excising and eating well balanced breakfasts" lmao
Ah, good ol' 'No-run' Dunn.
This was way better than the first episode.Almost pretty good.
This was OK but not Pretty Good
Itâ€™s yo Bois
JoN bOiS
Oh my god that was an amazing video.
Yeah, he ate that special brand of cereal called Roid-O's.
This was pretty good... but not Pretty Good
I'm new here can someone explain the Jon bois meme to me lmao
Great Video again as always. #Dorktown
"he started exercising and eating a healthy breakfast" Roid-Os
Joey Gallo literally set a higher record for "four true outcomes" last season.  532 PA, 41 HR, 75 BB, 196 K, 8 HBP = 60.1%  THE NEW GOD.
John Bois sneaks in. Good thing I chose to watch this
*Adam Dunn has reasonable to nice hair
BOIS
'well balanced breakfast' that makes you double in size
you know a Jon Bois video just by the thumbnail
As a reds fan, I always said Adam Dunn either hit a home run, struckout, or walked, just by watching him on a day to day basis. Cool to see that my idea actually is confirmed in statistics
ALL HAIL JON BOIS !!!!!!!!!!
The GOAT. Great research and excellent presentation. Can't get better than SB Nation
Daddy is home #saturdaysareforthebois
Hey this is pretty good!
JON BOIS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR
this was good, but not Pretty Good
Oh hai John. You aren't working on any special projects are you?
YEAH BOIS
Is there a John Bois podcast? Because I would watch the hell out of that.
Bring back chart party.
"Towards the end of his career he started... exercising and eating well-balance breakfasts". :D
This isn't Chart Party or Pretty Good so I'm unhappy
This is pretty good
Drunk penguins and blindfolded sloths hit very well
Dunn and my baseball classmate were #1 and #2 in steals in the Houston area
God bless Jon Bois
8th
JON GODDAMN BOIS
Like if you love Jon Boissssss
Boiiiiis
BOISTIFICATION SQUAD!!!
All hail the King!
JON!!!!!
Yay more jon Bois
HES BACK
BOIIIIIIISSSSSS
No bulls highlights?
Kelly is cute asf tho????
That Boban play thooooo??????
Embiid blocked brown
Watch out for Levert this might be his breakout season
Did I just? Am I a Trey Young fan now? Was not expecting that to happen I only clicked to rewatch D-Rose drop a Curtis Jackson on the Utah Jazz YO I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU FIGHT FOR BELLATOR DEREK ROSE!
0:46 travel
The lack of DeRozan in this clip is blasphemous. 2 game winners and they're showing preseason shit SMH
Nice!
he commentator at 16:40 had me dead ¨
That first defensive play from Kawhi is just inhuman.
16:40 16:40 16:40
First we have the no look pass but now we have a no look steal
where can i get a good ad blocker
??????
at 1:00 Durant missed a clutch shot, but no one is talking shit... xD imagine that being Lebron
Everyone’s just shooting from half court now?
Doncic is special
October was honestly an amazing month of basketball. One of the best starts overall Ive seen
J Allen has blocked Blake Griffin twice...
That double block is the staple of the Rap coming/current season niceee
Did anyone else get thrown off by piglet @16:40?
The Lakers try to start the season 3-6 to honor Lebron
Allen’s block on griffin ??
1:26 I miss when blake used to jump out the gym
11:16 that's some 2k cheese..
Khawi Leonard Sick ,KD is snake
It is just me, or is there a lot of last second highlights in less than a month?
Plenty of preseason clips on here and dumb put back lay ups and flooded with Atlanta hawks plays but not a single DeRozan clip and he's been going off making crazy plays in October. Spurs stay getting no love that's crazy
15:50 that dance nigga 6ix9ine got NBA players doing stupid shit ????????
It say nba season you put some preseason
16:40 lol this commentators voice is so good
i don’t know you and you don’t know me but if you hated or doubted d ?? then don’t act like you’ve been there and start hyping it up.. of course any positive energy towards him is appreciated but you know what i mean. not tryna start something just stating what i’ve seen these past hours
No russ alley oop??????
14:30 Wait What?????
Any special for lbj ? Just a dunk
NBA should have shown the highlights of LeBron missing 2 clutch free throws to win the game
14:31 get out of my hood
The commentator at 16:40 sounds like Kermit The Frog.
Derrick rose dropped 50 ??
There was so many half court shots.??
Trae Young Rookie of the year for sure !
No Zach LaVine love
Why the two lebron's wide open dunk are there ?
I'm happy 'cause most of movies related to the NBA are filled with what DRose has archived tonight
my hawks are ballin tf out. Just wait ??
like this to live
Trae Young is proving a lotta people wrong so far.
Where is the slam dunk of lillard againist lakers ??
that announcer at 16:40 was the best
Can’t lie raps jersey’s are dope
2011 mvp
damn sam deker broke tatums ankles
Bruh why are they showing preseason games
16:40 . Foreign commentators crack me up
The commentator at 16:40 had me dead ??
Trey already got a signature move, the nutmeg pass
DSJ still pushed off on Butler tho
29
man still , watching D Rose dropping 50 last night, truly it was something to behold ! that emotion coming out of him, thanks for not giving up on the fans bro, just incredible
There are a lot of teams surprising us from the Bucks being undefeated to bad teams like the Kings to having a 500 start to their season to teams we thought that were going to do well like the Lakers and Rockets having a 1-6 record to Ty Lue getting fired from the Cavs this season has kicked off to a great start this year and I hope there is more greatness to come from these teams
It was getting good then I heard "BINGO!" , man I hate that guy.
blake getting blocked at the rim all the time, they used to be posters
Charlotte footage looks like it's from 1990
Minus GSW being unbeatable for a ring, this is a very exciting season filled with surprises.
2:15 Hype scream inc.
The game of basketball seems easy for kawhi
Derrick 2011 MVP Rose!
??????
Toy story :the claw!!
a very entertaining October NBA
Watching D.rose dropping 50 pts was crazy man?? and that moment of him crying was one of the best moments in NBA history, Thanks for never giving up??.
im a school like if you agree
Bulls Derrick rose is back
Yag
This has been one of the best starts to an NBA season in a long time. So many epic moments!

Fuck the knicks
Knicks have Laker delusions. Thing is, big names actually like LA. Knicks players have all the pressure from all sides for no apparent reason. Why do the fans have such high hopes, I mean even the Nets are doing better.
Bench
Archaic
The NY Rangers: Once, Twice, 50 years a lolcow. When?
Forgot to mention Dolan charges regular season admission prices as if the Knicks are in the NBA Finals, in which they will NEVER be in as long as he's still owner.
Four words guaranteed to piss off Knicks fans: Eight points, nine seconds.
Not my utah jazz man Hornaceck. Not gonna lie prolly spelled that wrong. I been off basketball since Malone went to LA, and I forgot how to spell.
Porzingis is too much of a player for the NY Knicks.
You know there’s another team in New York..
Holy crap, this is Fat Mann ? The Fat Mann that did the hilarious Batman for Sega Genesis review? Ohhhh maaaannn! "How...the f***...do you get up"??!! haha cracks me up everytime SUBBED!
So true
I like this series... do the Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders next
NYC just has the Yankees lol... Possibly USA's most recognizable city only has one great sports team.
The only thing the knicks deserve is to disband and leave the nba forever and get killed in a second 9/11. Because thats the only thing new york is good at
If the Knicks didn't play in New York, they'd be about as relevant as the Sacramento Kings.
I've seen people get into arguments online about who's better (or worse): the Knicks or the Nets.
The new York Knicks are terrible!
An incompetent boob who happens to grope them as well....that might be my new favorite insult.
James Dolan gives very Michael Scott-like looks when he starts speaking bullshit.
"Latvian Hulk Smash" I'm a Knicks fan but that was so damn hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing at that part.
Thank god the Giants and the Yankees are always competitive watching the Knicks and the Rangers are so depressing.
Is that really the correct way to say Joakim Noah's name? Mind fucked if it's true, I've been saying it wrong for years
Knicks plz trade porzingis to the raptors plzzzzz
FYI, his name is pronounced Joe-ah-kim, not Wah-keem.
Every year I am right about the Knicks, for once I want to be wrong and see this team surprise me.
@urinatingtree Remember Isaiah Thomas bankrupted and entire league. Remember the old Continental Basketball Association?
I am a diehard Knicks fan from Brooklyn and this is so true!
Remember the 12-13 season when the Knicks were favorites to upset Lebron and the Heat only for Tyson Chandler to make Roy Fucking Hibbert look like Ralph Sampson and blow it to WHADDAYA KNOW THE FUCKING PACERS. Porzingis is the greatest Knick since Ewing...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand there goes his ACL. Here's hoping he recovers and doesn't lose all his talent when he comes back or worse end up like Derrick Rose. But knowing management he's fucked.
Srsly, why are New York teams, aside from the Yankees, so bad?!
Isaiah Thomas was so fucking embarrassing.
Please do a video about my team, the Memphis Grizzlies. They absolutely suck this year.
The Knicks best summed up by Wee-Bey from season 1 of The Wire. "Damn...the Knicks fucked up they draft again"
Without our Porzingis your team would be like the Coyotes of the NHL.
New York Basketball is horrible... utterly horrible, that’s why we all clinch baseball lol
Knicks fan here haven't watched them since 98 just awful
I miss Linsanity
That "huh" at the end was perfectly executed. Just like both teams' playoff hopes for the next few years.
Lakers need a lolcow video ASP Goddamn Ball family
This team is going to be shit for as long as I live, jfc
WTF?!?!?!?! 00:54 to 00:56 if that is not a travel then WTF IS??!?!?!?!?!?! Dude took 4 steps at least
At least the good news is that the Knicks got rid of Phil Jackson a month after this video was released, so they did SOMETHING right.
Ugh, you had to throw in the Rangers postseason loss too, huh?
What you said about getting names instead of making them sounds just like the Miami Dolphins. Please do them
do the bulls lol
Los angeles Lakers lonzo balll
Do more nba videos
this is facts the kicks is trash
this is facts the kicks is trash
Can you do the Charlotte Hornets next
it's pronounced joe-kim noah, that's how i know you don't really watch basketball. you tried to sound like you knew what you were talking about by pronouncing his name like joaquin phoenix while just googling other peoples' opinions about basketball and parroting them in your video. you're like the youtube version of skip bayless
I don't know if you could still call the Knicks the Professional Basketball's LolCow, when they are in 7th place with a 16 - 13 record and a 4 game winning streak!
Speaking of the Bulls... Have you seen them this season?
The Memphis Grizzlies: Pro Basketball's BLUES The Phoenix Suns: Pro Basketball's Eclipse And still waiting on CLIPPERS LOF
M u h T r i a n g l e
That ranger clip at the end. You have made my day
New York basketball is like California football
well not this season so far. Thats Chicago at this point
what's the name of the song at around the 5:00 mark??
Please do the shit out of my Dallas Mavericks next.
Danica Patrick.
Knicks will trade their best player Porzingis for a 40 yr old Lebron James within the next few seasons. That would be a typical Knicks' move. LOL
The Knicks have been a joke for decades. Overrated big market franchise. No NBA title since 1973!
The Knicks are 5-4 right now. It is too early in the NBA season, but they're definitely looking better than last season.
Wakeem Noah
Phil Jackson is probably happy now just being home in Montana and smoking weed all day
Anthony... Thunder now.
You called him "wakim" noah.
"Muh triangle!" -Phil Jackson, head coach of 11 championship teams, worst executive in Knicks history
They're even more fucked without melo now
2 words tell the story of the Knicks... Jared Jefferies
I like that line, passive aggressive twat, think I,ll use it.
you should do the wizards as the former lolcows
As a Knicks fan I approve this video
The Orlando Magic
I like to see a video on the T-Wolves. For the exception of the Kevin Garnett years, they have been pathetic. Bad draft after bad draft.
Fuck the rangers
Do the Phoenix Suns or Bandwagon Warriors fans!
I'm beginning to think this guy commentating is a nerd stuck in his house.
This team sounds like me playing gm mode in NHL games, taking big names with no care for anything but the fact I know their names
You say Joakim Noah's name wrong.
I can't even blame people for despising the always awful Knicks, it's like if the Yankees' only championships were those ones at the end of the 70s and had the exact same smug personality.
Two Letters Off...
DO THE WNBA!! A league of lolcowdom!!!
Ugh that Ranger dig at the end hurt even more lol
DO SD/LA CLIPPERS LEGACY OF FAILURE VIDEO
Tingis Pingis!
I am a knicks fan, and rape isn't allowed on ytube!!
Make one of these on the Phoenix Suns, I would have a blast watching that one.

Knicks Fan A Knicks fan dies on match day and goes to heaven in his Blue and Orange jersey. He knocks on the old pearly gates and out walks St. Peter. "Hello mate" says St. Peter, "I'm sorry, no Knicks fans in heaven." "What ?" exclaims the man, astonished. "You heard, no Knicks fans." "But, but, but, I've been a good man", replies the Knicks supporter. "Oh really", says St. Peter. "What have you done, then ?" "Well" said the supporter, "Three weeks before I died, I gave 100 dollars to the starving children in Africa". "Oh" says St.Peter. "anything else?" "Well, 2 weeks before I died I also gave 100 dollars to the homeless." "Hmmm. Anything else?" "Yeah. A week before I died I gave 100 dollars to the Albanian orphans." "Okay", said St. Peter, "You wait here a minute while I have a word with the god." Ten minutes pass before St. Peter returns. He looks the bloke in the eye and says, "I've had a word with God and he agrees with me. Here's your $300 dollars back, now fuck off". Genie A Knicks fan and a Celtics fan stumble upon a magic lamp. The Knicks fan gets to it first, picks it up and gives it a rub. There's a flash, a puff of smoke, and a genie appears The genie looks at the 2 men and demands to know who it was that rubbed the lamp. Delighted, the Knicks fan announces that it was him. "Okay," says the genie, "So you get 3 wishes. But there's a catch." "What's that then?" asks the 'Gers fan. "Well, whatever you wish for, I'll give the other guy double." "That's alright with me," says the Knicks fan, and starts the ball rolling by wishing for a million pounds. "Granted!" says the genie, "But the Celtics fan gets 2 million." "Fair enough. Now, I'd like a nice new Ferrari," "Done. But the Celtics fan gets 2 Ferraris." "Okay," says the Knicks fan, "I'd like to donate a kidney.  submissons by: heykohasan, mikeagostinelli, noahlondon94

Y'all got rid of Phil, you're about to trade Melo, you got some young players, just embrace the tank and stockpile future assets. You aren't luring any big free agents to NY any time soon.
such a joke of an organization
I stopped being a Knicks fan in 2010 (I'm now a Spurs fan) and it looks like I haven't been missing much.
what a shitty team I choosed to cheer _ _ '
You see, in New York you can only get one or two good teams a year. Giants and Yankees seem to get their shit together and the Knicks and Rangers seem like they're that 20 year old waffle house down that was taken over by the crack addicts down the street, wait, that didn't happen and it's just poor management? What's the difference?
I have considered becoming a Boston fan if they traded for Porzingis. Then a 6ers fan because they have Redick and a functional team now. Or the Raptors simply because they are better. Or literally everyone else in the NBA except for the Nets, especially after the draft. #PhilJacksonSucks #KillTheTriangle
next lolcow should be the Mariners
There needs to be one of these on the Hornets/Bobcats. They at one point a few seasons ago had the worst record in the history of the league.
Make a Phil Jackson got fired video!
knicks fans unite
I'm from nyc so yea this shit hurts??
Phil Jackson is now gone. So, who's going to lead the New Knicks Reign of Terror now?
That Rangers part at the end made for a great laugh!
Phil Jackson is finally gone...
clippers legacy of failure?
PHIL'S GONE NOW HURRAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP HIS TRIANGLE
Anyone else watching this after Phil got fired?
With Phil Jackson gone, the New York Knicks will make significant strides to suck a little less.
The irony of this, Dolan just told Phil Jackson to fuck off.
The Zenmaster has left the building
Please do a lolcow video on the Bulls.
re for knicks
Wahkeam Noah
Do a Lolcow for the Chicago Bulls
The Knicks give me crippling depression
might as well be the fucking Bermuda triangle lmfaooo
this was fcuking hilarious!
Lets be honest the knicks dont even compare to the nets
more nba videos, dude you're the man!
The knicks are the saddest team in professional sports. They have the money. They should be good. But they don't need to be good to make insane money. Phil Jackson is ruining the team and is only still here because he drafted KP. Just let Hornacek run his offense and stop overpaying has beens
Do the Phoenix Suns, but focus on the bad management, and not talent (because they've had great players).
No wonder Stephen A. was so mad when he talks about this team.
- The funny thing is, Dolan also owns the Rangers too; granted, they haven't won a Stanley Cup since their epic 1994 season, still their lone Cup since 1940, but at least they've been a perennial playoff contender...although they only have 1 Cup Final appearance( lost to the LA Kings in 2014 in 5 games, lost all 3 games on the road in LA...all in overtime )to show for it anyway.
0:54 How is that not traveling?
I'm so happy Dolan knows nothing about hockey and keeps his hands out of the Rangers.
The 76ers got rid of Sam Hinkey, and he worked wonders for them. I say put Sam Hinkey on the Knicks and pray.
Do the Lakers or Timberwolves next!!
As a Wisconsinite, all of our sports teams are good enough to not be on this list. Thank god the brewers have decided to be good and have offense this year.
I'd talk shit about the Knicks, but the Sonics no longer exist.
UrinatingTree Do the Bulls please. They got one of the shittiest front offices in the league and are doomed to stay mediocre in the foreseeable future.
Weird how the biggest lolcows in the NBA are all in the Atlantic division...
Forgot to mention the part where Linsanity made them almost good for one year and then they got rid of him instead of developing him to potentially be good in the future
At least the New York Knicks aren't the Brooklyn Nets.
fuck all jews
the NBA been cheating the New York Knicks for years!!!! fuck the fake ass NBA
the NBA is fucking fake ass a fuck!!!!!
Los Angeles Clippers = Washington Capitals... A Legacy of Failure
video request, The Texas Rangers: A Legacy of Failure
as an arsenal f.c fan i can relate to this all to well................
do suns next there a bigger lolcow than knicks
Phil Jackson is a damn Lolcow go back to Indiana or whatever he was
My family has had Knicks season tickets for 30 years. I feel the pain.
Do the padres
Bills
So the New York Knicks are pretty much the Washington Redskins of basketball?
Superteam
I know you don't like the NBA that much, but can you do a video on how boring these playoffs have been?
Do something about the MLS (Just a suggestion)
do one on The patriots legacy of annoyance
Also do the Buffalo Bills
Do some baseball teams such as the marlins padres white sox reds Phillies and maybe the mets if they don't turn it around
I just wanted to let you know, We have a lolcow watch for the St Louis Blues IMO
Do a mets lolcow
you should do the Anaheim Ducks or the Texas Rangers next
lol Yoakim Noah. I love his vids but you can tell he doesn't watch a ton of basketball.
"ouch" - Knicks fan ??
Do Buffalo Bills please
we just gonna act like he didnt take 7 steps at 0:57
Don't care much for NBA but I love your videos so much. Just subbed
Buffalo Bills The " Lolcows"
I'd love to see one about the Philadelphia Flyers ???? Keep making these videos dude. I love them!
I don't think you like soccer but some teams would make the Browns and Knicks seem competent like Newcastle United, Blackpool FC, and Leyton Orient. You will laugh your ass off in incompetence.
Can you do one for the Detroit Lions?
"Might as well be a fucking Bermuda Triangle?????? as this rate"
That rangers clip at the end lmao ??
????????
lol I don't even like basketball but I still watched your video cause you make good entertaining videos
Hey I love you're channel man. You should do some college football lolcows
Can you just make a lolcow video on the NBA in general? It is the most predictable sport in history. Nowadays, you can predict the NBA Finals before the season even starts. It's always gonna be Cav vs. Warriors. We need a more exciting sport...
Do a Lolcow video on the Celtics losing 130-86, 72-31 at the half.
And they still charge 80 bucks for the cheapest ticket
Can't wait for a low cow on the Denver nuggets and maybe the low cow history that was the Seattle sonic
I know it's a long shot, but if the Celtics happen to win the series, you've gotta make a "Congratulations Cavs" video. It's almost definitely not gonna happen, but if it does...
do the supersonics rise and fall
I truely love this Channel
Do the Mets, especially after this shitstorm of a season.
I'm a Knicks fan and I couldn't agree more
Deflowering Carmelo in the media? Ewww.
I'm not even a Knicks fan and this hurt my feelings a little
Ah, the Knicks. Always somehow more disappointing than the 76ers.
You need to do a lolcow video for the Toronto Raptors.
this video hurts so much and cuts very deep. unfortunately you got it totally right!
Buffalo lolcow/failure video next
You're forgetting that all of the Knicks problems, the mediocrity, the going after big names, all started when James Dolan bought the team in 2000. He is easily the worst owner in all of sports.
How come you don't do any baseball ones?
Urinating Tree what is your favourite sport?
After stumbling on this video, I binged on a bunch of your others. For somebody who doesn't like basketball as much as other sports, your stuff is amazing. Your hockey stuff was also great, I actually want to watch hockey for the first time ever now.
Great channel and fantastic amusement - keeo up the good work and Urintain us more :)
I am hardly follow NBA those days , but I am sorry to see what has happened to the team that I used to root for in the 90's. They were good team - not a great team - they were lacking a clean cut second elite player - especially on the offensive side of the ball. Love Starks, but he wasn't the answer.  But they had identity , they had consistency. Once they drafted - I empasise the word DRAFTED - their franchise player in Patrick Ewing - they stuck with him, and built around him. He didn't have his Pippen, he didn't have his Kobe (Shaq era in LA I mean), Clyde or even Tony/Manu. You can question if they were a real challenge to te Bulls - they were team to deal with, they meant business. Lolcow they were not , by any means. Today's Knicks are light years away from being as much contender for todays Cavs, as the 90's Knicks were for the Bulls.
New York Knicks vs Washington Generals! Make it happen!
The typical NY sports team tradition of signing big name FAs to big contracts to sellout crowds, without think of the consequences if it does not work out.
damn this spot on @ urinating tree please keep that good work
Knicks are the Cleveland Browns of the NBA ???????? Fuck the Knicks Lakers ALL DAY!
Did u just say Wuakim Noah? It's Joakim noah. As "Joekim"
As a Knicks fan, the players are not lolcows, the front office are the lolcows. Honestly I don't know, I don't watch basketball as much as I want to.
Can you you do some Detroit team
Any chance that you'll do Major League Soccer lolcow vids
we suck so much lmao it's rough
That melodramatic "huh" at the end is one of the best things I've seen today.
Knicks are the main reason why I stopped watching the nba
this channel is gonna get big!
last 15 ,20 years of NY basketball is a complete num skulls of travesty. why even open a season when u have no chance in hell or high water.
This is what us knicks fan have to deal with
1:08 lol in before more knee injuries
The only time that New York Knicks had hype was when Linsanity was carrying them
I would love to see you make a video on the king of lolcows in the NFL: Rodger Goodell and the NFL itself.
Thanks for uploading quality content on a regular basis. It's great to see a YouTuber put all this effort into his videos. Nice job Tree! :)
Anyone else notice that crazy travel at 0:55
I was waiting for this one. nice.
I really think it would be cool to branch out and do lolcow videos on College sports team too. There are plenty of viable candidates, like Nebraska football, Osu basketball, the NCAA, the Big 12, Texas football, any team in women's basketball besides Uconn, Kansas basketball, Tennessee football, etc. Plenty of places to go.
i wish he would have said "at least the knicks were the team on bobby's shmurda's hat that he threw"
This is so true
I found a new favorite channel easily. But for real, the Knicks have been an incredibly sad franchise. I can't even say anything else. That's all that needs to be said
As a knicks fan I resent but agree with this video
We also need a St. Louis Blues Legacy of Failure video haha
I love the new york accent with garden at 4:27
This video was well made!
As a knicks fan, we're sooo bad, we can't even tank properly. How the fuck we don't have the first pick every year?
Do the Mets please
Imagine a worse Billy King, and your result goes to the Knicks. 100%. No fail.
As a Knicks fan, thank you. This needed to be done.
Please make a video for the Seattle Mariners
Although I'm not a fan, can you the Bills?
About time thanks for reading me responding to my comment! Lol
I knew it was coming but still shocked he didn't talk about Joakim Noah how he is getting 16 million a year while the 2nd and 3rd string guys won more games than when Joakim Noah was on the floor
Do a Cubs lolcow
Wahkeem Noah?
finally
memphis grizzlies next please
we need to do something
St. Louis Blues: A Legacy of Failure DO IT PLEASE!
Im a knicks fan n i enjoyed this
If you're going to do one on the Knicks, then you better do one on the Leafs since the Leafs are the Knicks of the NHL. It'll be fun to hear you rip them as a fan.
Do the Pistons
OH HE GOT DA MANGO SENTINEL
When the pens get eliminated please do a lolcow I know your biased as fuck so you won't
Toronto maple leafs lolcow
Music as loud as speech so difficult to hear you.
Thank you so much. I'm not sure if it was based on my request that you did the Knicks but I'm going to act like it is. This is my pain. At least with the Rangers they will show up in the playoffs and make a run. The Knicks will just be totally embarrassing. Every move is one blunder after another. James Dolan is like cancer. What else can I say but the Knicks suck
113 copies sold. Dam that's just cold man. You didn't have to go there lmaoo. 4:05
but we know where bermuda triangle is located unlike knicks offense
how have you not done one on the Detroit Lions and my team the Falcons. they practically SCREAM lolcow!
I have almost given up on the Knicks and the NBA
Wakim noah is not his name
As a D.C. Teams fan I can say u should do an episode on D.C. Teams always get to the playoffs with promise and then underperform
Always glad Dolan doesn't really care about hockey, Rangers could be of much worse.
Good thing my sons aren't going to play there
i had to dislike this video because of that jab at the rangers at the end. :(
Urinating Tree I am a Rangers fan that gets frustrated every time the rangers don't play well in the playoffs. Please make a rangers lolcow video.
My team yaaay go knicks
At least we hav porting.....ooh fuck
Wait, no Spike Lee? That dude is a lolcow
b-but muh triangle
When will it get through Phil's head that the zone defense has rendered his precious triangle obsolete?
What teams are you a fan of?
Where tf are the bills?
They made a tons of shitty trade after Patrick Ewing era. Congrats Knicks fan you have the greatest draft position in this year's draft
That last part hurt me ouchie
Orlando!
The Knicks are the Redskins of the NBA. The main difference is that the Redskns are actually good sometimes.
As a Baseball Fan, I can't wait until the MLB Lolcow team. Whichever you decide to do.
Derrick Rose isn't wrong. Knicks ARE playing random basketball. I bet he faked his knee injury
Love your Chanel I just wish my teams would quit earning vids on it!
R u gonna do a haters guide to the NBA Finals
Phil jackson deserves his own lolcow videov
Are they much of a lolcow
Atlanta hawks????
Need to do the Arizona cardinals the oldest franchise in the NFL and have not won a damn super bowl
yes! a Knicks one
The 76ers and nets say atleast we are not the knicks
Can you PLEASE do the Saint Louis Blues?
Finally
Next lolcow Milwaukee Brewers
More video game lolcows like Sonic The Hedgehog!
YES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SOOO LONG
Finally
finally you do one of my teams!! thank you for shitting on my favorite NBA team UrinatingTree.
Do a lolcow video on the afc east. The empire known as the patriots have ruled over it with an iron fist for over a decade
Buffalo, specifically the Sabres and the Bills. Evander Kane is... something.
CFL: professional international lolcow!
As a Magic fan, I feel we're next in line for this...
NBA Sucks
Let's not forget that the Knicks were the losing team during Wilt Chamberlain's legendary 100-point game in 1962. Yep, their lolcowdom stretches back that far.
You could honestly rank 90% of the NBA as a low cal. Bucks, Knicks, 76ers, Kings, Suns, Hawks, Timberwolves, Clippers, Pelicans, Hornets,.... fuck it... basically the entire east. Lebron basically saved the Cavs from being a lowcal just in recent years and GSW just became good in the past 4 years. Almost every franchise in the NBA is garbage with the exception of the Lakers and Celtics.
You should do a video on the NY Mets. That would be epic
Great video as usual
Fuck Dolan, fuck Dolan, fuck Dolan. Also, fuck Dolan.
Should've been the Bills video we were all expecting
I am a sad knicks fan and have been waiting for you to post this
timberwolves pls they are worse than this team
At least MSG has the Rangers lol
Unrelated to the video bur did anyone else watch that Pens game last night
this took a while.
Please do the Bills!
Urinating Tree I'm a Rangers fan it's sorta the same shit with the Rangers and Knicks cause of Fucking James Dolan.
The Buffalo Bills: Professional Football's Shitshow
is kristrap in Charlotte now?
Do buffalo sabres, a legacy of failure.
THANK YOU! "At least we have the Rangers...huh."
wakim lol
I'm Knicks fan, and unfortunately, all of this is very true. It's not easy to like this team nowadays
I got triggered at this. But it's all true
You truly captured the shit show Hurricane Katrina like disaster that is Madison Square Garden and the teams the reside in the arena. Much applause from a NY fan.
Thank you so much for finally doing my shit team
I feel bad for KP. I believe he'll leave the Knicks for a competent team.
I don't watch basketball and I know how much the Knicks suck
this was the one i waited for as a die hard knicks fan this was spot on. brilliant work bro
THE RANGERS WENT TO THE PLAYOFFS. KNICKS HAVEN'T SINCE 2013
Finally! A Knicks lolcow video, and it doesn't disappoint!
Very funy video, I have a request, as a Marlins Fan, our team is the very definition of LOLCOWDOM. I would love to see you skewer the Marlins for catharsis
you should do the clippers, there is A LOT to talk about lol... I love them but I want to see you tear them apart
You should do a video on Detroit, a city of lolcows
do Buffalo Sabres plz!!!!!!
The Knicks? LMAO!!!
"and an incompetent boob who tries to group them, too" I'm dead ????
Anyone see that monsters travel at 0:55
I've tried to watch a knicks game and they just don't care
Why the fuck would they trade Porzingis?
What's odd is that Dolan has largely ignored the Rangers...and they are very successful.
I am a self-loathing Knicks fan
This is why I love you!
I love the guy narrating this
Triangle offense
I've been waiting
Do a baseball lolcow!!
Welp had to happen eventually, my only criticism is that he is supporting Melo. Melo was just an overhyped fool and once you watch about 4 of his games, you realise he is nowhere near good enough to hog the ball like he does.
do the Minnesota timberwolves
You should make a lowcow video for the LA Clippers aka the LA's red headed stepchild.
Now do the Lakers so that you can get me to start crying about that debacle lol
Could you make fun of every single team? I'll watch anything you make
That Rangers burn at the end really hurt lol
This is perfect. NBA Basketball in NYC is horrible. Do a video about the L.A. Clippers because they have the superstar players and still can't get past the conference semifinals.
im surprised you didn't roast Dolan more! Great hilarious video!
So if/when you get to soccer, you're going to do Arsenal, right? While I could write a dissertation of their suck, just know that Stan Kroenke owns the team. Well the majority. A minority stake is owned by a Soviet-era gangster and rapist.
Do a LA Lakers lolcow :)
You make damn good content, my dude. I've seen your sub count explode over the past month and you deserve every single one. Keep it up and ESPN is going to start cribbing your notes without giving you credit
You deserve more subscribers man keep it up??
Do one for LaVar Ball
Sell the Knicks to Floyd Mayweather he'll be a good owner lol
I'm a Porzingis fan. I hope he achieves success at a good team.
That fucking "huh" at the end. I'm dying
After a shitty day at work and a sorta kinda shitty continuation at home, watching your Knicks video was able to relax me and take my mind off of things, even for 6 minutes. Thank you kind sir; keep up the good work!
Suprised that you didnt find any flaw with Porzingis. I guess he is that good then ??
for somebody who once said he doesn't care the NBA you're doing a damn good job with the content on the sport, keep up the great work and also my friend recommend you take a look at the bulls front office for lolcow quality.
How's that 5-1 L taste
Worst sports franchise ever.
you missed the chance to make an Isaiah Thomas celtic joke
Do the Orlando Magic.
James DOLAN dolan pls
That rangers clip at the end was uncalled for
Whenever you inevitably start doing baseball lolcows, the Padres HAVE to be first up.
Do Edmonton oilers
Update the Nets fucking up now that the draft lottery is over?
Now which team is next? starts rubbing hands vigorously
Future Lolcow videos: NFL Indianapolis Colts Detroit Lions Miami Dolphins New Orleans Saints NBA Phoenix Suns Dallas Mavericks Charlotte Hornets Orlando Magic NHL Florida Panthers New Jersey Devils MLB Seattle Mariners Chicago White Sox Cincinnati Reds Tampa Bay Rays Miami Marlins Texas Rangers Los Angeles Dodgers Washington Nationals MLS D.C. United New England Revolution Real Salt Lake Colorado Rapids. Lolcows Fulfilled: Buffalo Bills Buffalo Sabres Pittsburgh Pirates San Diego Padres New York Mets (twice)
Love the lolcow/legacy of failure content UT. I know you want to do the Pirates as a baseball lolcow first (based on comments), but I think the Mets are worthy of consideration as well. Cheap-ass ownership, god-awful personnel decisions, the worst team money can buy, having Las Vegas as an AAA affiliate...the list is endless :P
Do the lions
Dolan is such a clown, seems like he wants to be more of a GM than an owner... vetoed a very good trade for Kyle Lowry at the last moment in 2013 because Masai Ujiri (Toronto GM) fleeced him in the Carmelo Anthony trade when he was with the Nuggets and he didn't want to be made to look foolish by Ujiri again
Now they have the 8th pick. They're gonna butcher it aren't they?
The Dolans are good owners of the Indians. When Dolan dies the team better not go to this dumbass.
Go fuck yourself for putting that rangers clip at the end I was just getting over that loss ??????
You should do Pierre mcqire!
Another great video. Will we ever see MLB content from you?
any team not named the warriors or Cavs: professional basketball's lolcow
I wish you made more nfl videos but I guess we will have to wait, keep up the great content you deserve way more subs than u have
the knicks what a joke
You should cover the green pastures of lolcows, otherwise known as Buffalo.
That owner is such a mean little man. What he said to the 72 year old fan, it's just insulting to all sports lovers.
Great vid!
Not watched basketball for years, so I can't imagine the Knicks without Ewing. the '90s truly was the best decade before everything went downhill.
Finally!! The worst team in NYC!! Thank you for that! As a knick/Rangers fan we have suffered through James Dolan for a long time now! Please keep pouring it on that guy so he finally gives up and goes back to wherever the fuck he came from!
Love this video! And here's one more detail that makes the Knicks the premier lolcow. The Heat were their rival in the '90s. Couple of decades later, whenever the Heat beat the shit out of them, the fans would chant LET'S GO HEAT. Not kidding. Look it up on here.
At least merlo and kris taps actually do something on offense
Pittsburgh Pirates next!!
Still waiting for a Bills/Sabres lolcow video, and that's as a hardcore fan of both. But whatever you make in the meantime (I mean, it has to be inevitable, right?) is plenty good to hold me over.
Do the Cincinati reds! They have been terrible these past couple of years and its probably not gonna get better
Which is worse: the band or the team? Discuss
Always a pleasure to laugh at poor teams with you good sir!
Do the Marlins, as a Marlins fan it's a joke how mediocre they are.
Damn I knew my knicks was going to be on here sooner or later ??
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN
As funny as these videos are, what always gets me is how astoundingly accurate they always turn out to be. Poor Knicks
This channel is pure gold. I get adrenaline rushes just to see the notification that another video is up. Keep it up
If someone forced you to root for either the Knicks or the Nets, which one would you choose? Or would you rather swim naked in the Hudson? also it makes my day when you put out a new vid. keep up the good work!
A Knicks video without Spike Lee or a Spike Lee Joke?!?!? FeelsGoodMan
Dude do a Seattle Mariners Lolcow episode. They're the most Lolcow team in Baseball right now.
sums up the knicks shitness since 1999...
KEEP DOING MORE BASKETBALL UR AWESOME
Dude one day your channel is gonna explode. Your content is just too good for it not too.
Porzingis to the Spurs :):) #gospursgo
>tfw you're a knicks and mets fan Just fucking end it all. Speaking of, a Mets lolcow video would be awesome, watch out for Ray Ramierez' voodoo doll though.
lakers,suns,sixers,twolves>knicks and nets
do the 76ers
Another good NBA Lolcow would have to be the Minnesota Timberwolves.
"Incompetent boob who also happens to grope them." Hilarious!
Hey you should do a LOLCOW video on Detroit Michigan
Just do the Ranger Lolcow I know you want too
You should do a Lolcow for the Orlando Magic that would be perfect.
update on the NETs. They got the first pick :)
there's one lolcow in the NBA your forgetting (Phoenix Suns)
There it is, and about time, too! :D
Where's the baseball lolcows?
I'm a Knicks fan. Pray for me
Hey UT, could you do a review on the Blue Jays franchise at some point?
lmao!!!!!
These videos are getting cancerous... Literally every team is a "lolcow" to you... any team can pretty much make your channel as long as they have not won the championship in the past few years...
Can you do a reverse Lolcow series?
This channel is underrated, and should have way more subscribers
Should leagues be allowed to punish players for what they do in their personal life?
When I think of "lolcows" in professional basketball, the names Gilbert Arenas and Metta World Peace immediately come to mind. I mean, Artest's name change alone makes him an absolute court jester. Also, Why in the Sam Hill is someone like James Dolan still allowed to own a sports team?
As a Pacers fan, Fuck the Knicks and Fuck Spike Lee
The day has finally come to all my disappointments the Knicks (sadly my favorite franchise) has finally gotten a lolcow
As a fan of Kristaps Porzingis, i hope he gets traded.
Welcome to New York the city that bleeds heartache and tears from its sports fans.
5:22 Splendid pun!
The last line of the video killed me. The way you're just like ".... huh..."
Do my Mets next
Hey man, You should do the haters guide to the NBA Finals when it happens
Please do more
Another great video, still waiting for a lolcow episode on a MLB team though
This guy deserves way more subs
You guys should start doing MLB videos. Expand the buffoonery!
I'm a die hard fan, but I need a Lolcow video on my Detroit Lions
Somewhere in MIA, GM P. Riley is laughing hysterically at (No rings as GM) P. Jackson and his former employer. If only the NYK dropped in value as fans stopped buying tickets..Oh well. I'm sure you will have a 2019 update after Phil & Carmelo exit NYC.
You should really do some baseball lolcows, specifically on the Brewers and Mariners
You should do video on a good team so that you can be more appreciative of the lolcow's
Where da bills at doe?
Who's Wakeem Noah?
Your pronouncing of Joakim hurts me
I think the Trail Blazers are long overdue for a Lolcow Analysis.
do the mets next.(mets fan)
Watch Dolan see this and ban you from ever going to a knicks game, not that you'd want to anyway in their current state
The Carmelo trade was stupid he was public about leaving Denver along with wanting to play in NY. Even with all that when he had 1/2 year left in his contract the Knicks traded half there fucking team and so many draft pick that the last pick from the trade was last year 6 years after the trade.
Lol my first ever NBA game I attended was a Knicks-Heat game a few months ago. I didn't expect them to put on a show, but Madison Square Garden is nice.
The Knicks sound early similar to the Jags. Big name free agent signings that are well past their prime and could possibly flop
You should do a prediction video on this upcoming NFL season I'm a huge fan and I love your videos
knicks better not mess up with their draft pick
Roflmao you are a genius
Did you say at least MNG had the rangers
Your videos are always great even When I don't know much about the sport.
Why do free agents keep choosing this garbage organization? I'm confused,
As a Knicks fan, this video was LONG OVERDUE
U are purposely avoiding doing a lions episode and we all know it. You are being a lolcow rn
to quote Yipes MVC2 commentary: "FUCK THE KNICKS!" Great video as always.
"Blah blah do the Bills blah blah blah"
Ayyyyyyyyyyye he's back
m8 love the video, but I really thought you were gonna do the Buffalo Bills this week
no mention of jeremy lin? i get that he's a dead horse but that was probably the only time the knicks had a spike in relevancy for the past ten years
I love the small details you out into these videos, like the Mario sound effects.
This is like my Cocaine, the more I get the more I want
I hope your channel blows up, these videos are fucking great!
Bills next please!
Can we get a Kansas City Chiefs legacy of failure vid?
I love your videos man, but since im a New York sports fan, you must really hate New York
had a feeling this was coming... ITS SO PAINFUL BEING A KNICKS FAN
New York Kn'Ecks
This was awesome, but we need hornets next.
Do the Bills
as much as a fan of them i am, you might as well do the bucks. we've been a lolcow since Kareem left.
HA!!! I WAS 100% CORRECT ABOUT PORZINGIS!! My entire family is Latvian and I've constantly said to my fellow latvian sports friends and family that he deserves better than the Knicks!
The Big Apple's other lolcow in basketball has been torn apart by the great UT. How long will the Knicks and Nets dwell in the NBA's cellar?
Love your vids man. Keep up the good work!
Do epl lolcows
Oh my god! As a Knicks fan I've been requesting this video since the 76rs vid. Thank you sooooo very much for making this
wanna hear a joke Phil Jackson
im a knicks fan and this was so fucking hilarious, but why did you have to bum me out with JG fucking Pageau
isiah Thomas ain't no rapist when has a athlete actually raped someone Oh wait ............ Cough BEN ROTHLESBURGER Cough
FINALLY, i was waiting for this video since the Oakley incident
I don't follow NFL or NBA but watch these Lolcow masterpieces anyway
Do a Marlins lolcow
thanks
Been saying for years. This team is a dumpster fire. They're like a dull basketball train without brakes heading no where
Carmelo Anthony is a Lolcow in himself. You should do a video on him Tree!
dang 30,000 subs
Do the saints.
I forgot the Knicks exist
Why don't you do any Lolcows for baseball?
0:53 Travelling much? I think I counted at least 5 steps. One of the many reasons I never watch basketball...especially NBA.
You starting to like basketball more? Phil Jackson is probably 2nd or even the best coach of all time but he got brain cancer or something since he went from G.O.A.T or CO G.O.A.T to trash coach RIP NY
do the nba lottery, the ammount of salt given by phoenix fan this past 2 days could feed the entire continent of africa
Wahkeem no uh
As a Knicks fan, the phrase "at least we're not the 6ers" is our team's mantra.
Hi
i was just about to talk about knicks franchise
BUFFALO BILLS!!!!!!!!!
this has been a long time coming
good evening Mr. tree
Holy crap. I've finally found a YouTube channel thats Actually entertaining!
i love this shits
Charles Oakley looks like what Gary Bettman will be in a couple of years
Mariner lolcow please
Make a video on Kevin Pillar saying Faggot and PC sports people losing their minds.
last time i was this early knicks fans were complaning about drafting porzingis
This was pure gold. Keep it up!
THANK YOU IVE BEEN ASKING FOR SO LONG - SUFFERING KNICKS FAN
Always nice to see another video from you.
Hey be gentle with the Celtics LolCow vid plz
Asparagus
this video shouldve been made when the Knicks decided to bring Phil Jackson on board!
Growing up in a family of Knicks fans, I'm not sure if I should show this to them to risk being Disowned.
Great video but please do the pirates next the yinzers need to be taken down a peg or two
I love this channel so much! Very unique with great commentary. If the Knicks trade Porzingis, they are hopeless for the next 20 years at least.
notification squad :)
Lions next! please
o boi
FIRST ALSO YES FINALLY THANK YOU YOU PISSING TREE
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!
They aren't real Basketball Either.

Ive been trying to improve on my editing recently. Hopefully you guys can notice a difference in quality. Lets see if we can hit 2000 likes on this video. That would be AWESOME! I hope you guys enjoy this video and have a great day!
Isnt that the intro from the behind the scenes talk show for Stranger Things lmao
A+ on something that you didn't produce? Ruining education
How was that the shortest game in NBA history? The game was the same 48 minutes as every other game that just happened the be played on two different days. That comment doesn't make any sense. If we start a chess match today then pause after 5 minutes and come back tomorrow to finish it does that make it there longest chess match in history? No fucking way. So who the hell is replaying the last few seconds of a game constitute your notion that it's the world's shortest NBA game? Stop using unnecessary hyperbole to hype your story. It just makes you look stupid in the Iong run.
Lol this is nowhere near the weirdest NBA game.
This isn't the weirdest game. The weirdest game was when the Golden State warriors won a game with 7 suited players and I believe two of them got injured. One came into the game injured. This was the game that Stephen Curry let the world what he was about.
Nice intro and if your going to ask for likes at least thank us for watching the video
I don’t think nba insider will heart this...
Lol every comment on this video was hearted
I sent a clip of your intro into Netflix due to copyright issues hahaha!
no gon lie that outtro was pretty smooth
Not surprised that David Stern let a team full of stars and Pat Riley got to replay the game but was totally fine the Raps getting screwed. Fuck David Stern.
3:34 Russel Westbrook’s a time traveler ??
Not hating at all but that video title is BuzzFeed level cringeworty ??. Nice good though.
YES!!! You remembered the T.J. Ford incident.. that's impressive!
Hawks score keepers are known to be hella shady.
bro you should make a wes unceld story
Wya
Come back dad
Since 20o
Great intro and why haven't you been uploading
This nigga died ??
R U Dead
I miss you bro please come back
When the next video i miss u so much
Well fuckin made
Even worse than fouling shaq out: I guess my high school basketball team was in the championship years ago and both teams had the same jersey and 1 more foul would foul them out of the game. The opposing player got a foul called, but they fouled the wrong person and fouled the player from my school. My team ended up losing the game. Glad I wasn't on the team that year.
english
Stranger things to the intro
What accent is that sounds funny
You made the script of this video with Edusson.com. I see what you did there. #lowkey
0:26 the pic is fake dude #5 is actually in the bench running to them so it means one of the 5 dudes will is on the way to sit at the bench since he is replaced
If Adam Silver was the commissioner back then that game wouldn't of happen
If I didnt know this was true, I wouldnt have believed you because you didnt explain how Shaq was credited with the foul. Did they notice it was his 6th and foul him out and the refs just went with it? Or did they realize he had 6 later and toss him? Its confusing this way.
I remember that game
It would have been awesome if shaq had to play, lol.
Can the Pacers get a replay with the cavs in game 5 starting right after the goaltending and are awarded the points for it. I don't want to start when Young knocked it out of Lebrons hands out of bounds.
I only noticed your accent about 5 minutes in, I love it though.
Why the hell does the the title say "(RARE)"?
Any footage of this?
Bro I need a longer version of that intro
Stranger things head ass
3:42 la laekers
The 2 games on one day was on my birthday March 8th
been missing that music
I like the stranger things intro ????
What
You also could say it was one of the longest games in nba history
Stranger things intro I love it
Wait so u can pay edusson to do your homework? Where the fuck was that when I was in high school?
dude.. pronounce FOUL correctly. the U is not pronounced. it's like "fowl"
The entire protest was nonsense to begin with. It was in fact Shaq that picked up that foul and not Haslem.
In recreational playground basketball, it is possible for games to end in ties. In one instance, I saw a team play 5 games that day. That team won 2 games, lost 2 games, and tied 1 game. They could have played a 6th game put the recreational facility closed for the night so they could not even start the game. Of course, those games were against different opponents.
Coach
Sounding a little Scottish there
Yo you’re sponsored by some scummy ass shit
stern worst commissioner
I had a stroke listening to this
They should have let O'Neal suit up as a heat for that replay game.
ur an idiote
I forgot about this
Stranger things intro. Nice ??
I need a longer version of that intro
Only reason I knew this was because I’m heat fan. Great video
O
His intro makes me wish stranger things was still on
nice intro
Stranger things??????
Stranger things squad
great intro
I flipped when I heard Stranger Things.
1:54 it say go Rockets!
Why do people watch the garbage you make.? Your voice is literally nails on a chalkboard
How would nobody realize that haslem fouled but Shaq fouled out without doing anything.
That intro was lit
Beyond Stranger Things Intro
Stranger things intro tuff
Been here since 400 subs and ur still kicking it ??
That intro is ??

That stranger things inteo
That intro
I love that intro
These refs get things wrong every single day
Yo that outro was??
I see you WIT DAT STRANGER TINGS MUSIC
??
I remember I read an article on this after the Cavs Warriors game
Tj ford low key lookin like Richard Hamilton
Damn and i am a hawks fan
This was covered in 2008. It received some attention for being unusual (playing the end of a game over again). No one really took it seriously though since the Heat were a bottom-dwelling team that season.
That was a fun one!
David Stern's earlobes disgust me
Best youtuber
That was one dope intro
Please keep this intro its lit big fan of stranger things
Then intro and outro music is tight
Schlenk : "We need to tank this year!" ATL scorekeepers : "We will pay attention to our job mandates this season."
Great intro.
What if Shaq was traded to the hawks?
One question: Did Shawn Marion inherit Shaquille O'Neal's five fouls accumulated from the earlier game, which would have put him one away from disqualification, or was there no league rule covering this particular situation? Or maybe the Heat would have assigned the five fouls to Marcus Banks, figuring that he might not get in the game anyway?
Lit intro brother
That intro was spot on
I was there when they played both games.
RARE
intro music?
What Is that accent
This isn't rare, most die hard nba fans know about this but good vid
Bro I thought I would be the only one to comment about the intro but keep that jawn it's ??????
are there any clips ?
He sounds asian
If I were in this situation as David Stern, I would just nullified the game. No effect on anyone.
Why is your name NBA Insider if your don’t have a job in the NBA
Good ass intro bro
omg I had the screen upside up and I you thought you putting this??
Great Vid!!
Bro that intro ??
That intro was dope
Your channel is so underrated

Bruh your footage is so irrelevant... Anyway great coverage and amazing intro....
Keep the intro that was dope
I’ve heard of stranger things in this video
Amazing video and intro
My AAU team lost 4 games in one day
this video=????
This not the weirdest game ever . This happened so many times !!!!!
At the beginning, doesn't it have to be below the belt
Why was shawn marion the only applicable player of having 2 lost game if the other heat players like wade were involved on both games?
I heard of it,
Not gonna lie that’s an amazing intro
I remember when this channel had 2k subs wow ??
good vid insider
Damn, I been watching the NBA heavily since 1998 and I never heard of this. Good job. I have to sub and check out the rest of the content. ??
Intro got me to sub, content got me to stay
3:34 I didn't know Michael Jordan and Russell Westbrook were pals??
Love the intro because of Stranger Things

Stranger Things song, ok??
Love the new intro

In head soccer you can only score 20 or 30 goals or higher like ????2-24????
On this site, a list of the highest football score https://sequanodionysien.jimdofree.com Feel free to share this site
Although was it an official FIFA game? As in registered under FIFA? Or was it just any random tournament?
I have no Idea what you said
JON BOIS!!!! JON BOIS!!!
Football*
Nice shirt
I don't know, one of these days, someone is going to break that record by one goal, not as a form of protest, just because they can hold the record
Wait soccer not ending in 1-0??!?!? Oh my.
By soccer you meant the real football right ?
Haahaha
149-0 When you play FIFA with your younger sibling
Its called football America
“FOOTBALL” game
Football, not soccer
Football
Football * :^)
I did not understand
Oh yeah yeah
they should have scored 153 since 36 (prev. record)+117 years = 153
When you play fifa on amateur mode
149th comment??
Who is jon bois why everyone here is talking about him
FOOTBALL
7-1
it's "de facto," not "de factor."
The 149 - 0 should not have been counted
Only south Canadians call football soccer.
Props for not backing down on saying names of our people.
Here is a tip for Americans. ?? It's called Football. Is that so difficult to remember? What you call Football is actually a variation of Rugby
BOI.............s
I want to see the games now.
I think I know one goalie who got more than benched
I love how their props are always in this weird gray area of quality and never totally shitty or highly professional looking.
Did any Adema players touch the ball? There was an Australian rules football match where a team won 400-0.
My record is 4 home runs in one
Australian Rules Football has been played since at least 1858. In 2007 the biggest winning margin was recorded. 119 points separated the winning Geelong Cats from Po Port Adelaide
You can just say in 2002.....
The only goals to ever be scored in soccer
imagine the pay out for a person that bet that team to lose by over 100 goals
Imagine that goalies stats now lol
The first 19 top comments all have to with Jon Bois. Seriously, I love him, but do you sub just for him?
Pretty good video. I'm sorry I read the comments. None pertain to the video.
What was that banana pun
My football team won a game 34-0 to s team who have -160 goal difference and came bottom of the league for 4 years in a row
The highest scorning game in soccer was 3-3
Say point one more time and There’ll be issues
1:43 Lol literally me when I first started playing fifa??
poor goalie
Hey, I want some likes! Uh...Jon Bois?
What happened to Jessica?
Changing the host is the best thing you ever did.
Soe
Lol, soccer sucks. International soccer really sucks.
It's not a "soccer game", it's a "football match". Soccer match is also acceptable.
Where is the boi
Jon Bois fanboys at it again lol, they just won't go away
I want "pretty good" so bad :(
SB Nation subscribers: 90%-because of Jon Bois 10%-because of Other Content
Could have been 150 to 1.
Me in FIFA 17
Lets not be too hasty here. I only subscribe for Jon Bois too, however this guy did a good job and I wouldn't mind other content by him.
The fact they didn’t cancel the game is already a waste of time and money for the fans and stadium. Why play it when the champion had already been decided?
Should do one about the hit by pitch record.
More than half of these comments mention Jon bois or pretty good, neither of which are in this video.
This should have been done by Jon :/
The rest of the world calls it football why can’t you do the same
Can't wait for the Jon Bois version of this.
I'm new here, so I must ask: Who the eff is Jon Bois and why won't people in the comments shut up about him?
RIP MATT. Goodbye Uffsides :(.
Jon Bois??
so is this a football only channel
I digg the animation for the match.Looks cute. Good show
Jon Bois
We'll miss you matt
Nice Sub Pop shirt. SEATTLE REPRESENT
90% of the subscribers here are just waiting for Jon bois
I love these unbreakable record videos! They’re crazy lol

#FREEJON
This is Pretty good trash
They were only down by 4 points, could've rallied and actually won it if they really tried, but instead they had to pull this stunt. Shameful.
I almost feel bad for everyone not named Jon Bois on SB nation. They make good content but so many people are just here for Bois.
SB Nation YouTube page: Hey guys we've decided to give you all $100 for being a subscriber Y'all: where jon at tho
RIP MATT WE LOVE YOU
So this was like Cumberland-Georgia Tech, but in the exact opposite way, if that makes sense.
You people who constantly complain on every video that doesn't have Jon in it are pathetic
Jon bois
Jon Bois should probably just continue his personal youtube channel. Just sayin'
Where's Jon Bois?
why did y'all lay off matt ufford
This should have been a Pretty Good episode.
Ufford got canned and Jon Bois is nowhere to be seen? I'm not gonna say SB Nation's other content is bad but I'm starting to wonder what I subbed for
Such a shame Matt Ufford is gone. One of SBNation's best contributors. Hope he gets a deal elsewhere, he deserves it.
Every comment is about where’s Jon Bois? Why can’t you guys please us? Can’t you realize that he is a god among men?
If it’s Not Jon Bois doing this you don’t get my like
Jon Bois?
Should’ve been Jon Bois
Pretty good...
Everybody's screaming for Jon and I can really understand. Jon Bois = GOAT
Hey, Vox/SB Nation. Way to upload this after Ufford got canned. Real cool move.
I only follow this channel for John
This was a perfect video for Jon Bois :(
Soccer is boring and for douchebags
Needs more Jon Bois.
This should have been used in a pretty good by Jon Bois.
We loved you Matt ?? good luck in your years to come
Honestly, I think Arbroath's 36-0 win over Bon Accord or Australia's 31-0 win against American Samoa are more deserving of a "Pretty Good", I find the earlier to be a more interesting story and the latter to be more historically significant to international soccer. Y'all can have this.
Where is Jon
Thats not pretty good. Where is Jon Bois?
Way to ruin a perfectly good Jon Bois story.
#FREEJONBOIS
The USA losing in soccer, what's New? ??????
:'( miss you Ufford
this would be a good idea for a pretty good video
This would be better with Jon Bois.
Can we get more Beef History
It's decent but not pretty good
This is not pretty good
Stop stealing Jon's material
This topic should have been saved for Jon. This stinks
Why wasn't this a pretty good episode, the topic is the same.
Jon Bois or bust!
I thought Ufford was laid off? He is my favorite SB Nation contributor, after Jon Bois of course.
I hope this video doesn't get laid off
This is the same thing as that pretty good was about. You guys are just recycling old content.
This was good, but not pretty good
Where's Jon Bois?
Where is Jon Bois
If you remake the 222-0 I’ll be salty
First
If you're still making these videos you should do one on Dean Saunders scoring from a throw in as the lone attacker by bouncing the throw off the back of the goalie
Hipsters talk sports
So the score is 18-1....(!)
My boi Mr. Gill
IN THE YEAR 2000
P.O.I.N.T.S
they have the gayest white ppl on this show
There was one game between the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Canadians, I think it was 2 years ago in the preseason but the Bruins were winning like 14-2 and in the last 10 minutes of the 3rd period they just stopped calling all infractions against the Canadians so they could just end the game faster
Here’s a question, can basketball refs score and it still count, if so, can the players stop them?
1:20 "So the score is 18-1" "Ok" No not ok...can we have a rewind on this game pls
Player 3 has entered the game.
The referee they are talking about was suspended for seven weeks and the goal was revoked.
When you figure out how to use cheat codes on FIFA 19
It’s also called laws in America... I know it was a joke, but as an ex referee I see passed it. So it kinda sucked.
For me I have reffed soccer for about 4 years and I never thought of doing this although I did know that the ref is part of the field
That pure black background looks so good on oled screens...
I have scored a goal like the first one animated, not with my head, but with my butt. I had the penta-hexagon pattern from the seams on my left butt cheek for a week, and oh boy, what a week.
WIMPole
As a current referee myself, I can confirm that this, however unfair, is legal. And I neither understand why they are called "the laws of the game" and not "the rules of the game"
(0:25) In IIHF (international ice hockey rules, used by some countries), if the puck touches one of the officials before going into the goal, it will not count. I don't see why this wouldn't be the case for other sports too. This would avoid two cases: • biased official helping a team to score • using an official to rebound to score Although the case of an official preventing a goal won't be solved in either case. But that doesn't matter.
Is it just me, or does this Ryan guy talks about Europe, and more specifically, Britain, in a mocking way? I'm not getting all butt-hurt over it, but he knows that it's not an island of pretentious people with monocles walking around, right?
This Ryan guy is so annoying
22-goal thriller. The ref was definitely on their side
hey look its pat
An AR should never be on the field unless it's a PK and he's standing on the 18 and the goal line.
300th comment!
Imagine the uproar if it happened in Jamaica and they did a Jamacian accent mon.
In Britain, it's called football. Get it right.
Originally happened in Turkey. Fenerbahçe Besiktas.
As a formerly licensed referee, this is true, but frowned upon.
Read the rule, did the exam to became a soccer referee myself, and is true. Lol
Pffft . Americans and their stupid ideas .
I'm a fan of this channel and the "weird rules" series of vids, but this one was not my favourite. I don't know if it is my bias, but too many times when I hear Americans speaking about soccer, I don't know, there is this naivety, ignorance or just plain condescension when they speak about it. It just doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious sport. I don't know, maybe I am being unfair.
I want to see this video and I’m not even a soccer fan but I still would like to see the video. Anyone got a idea of where it is
"Here comes that scorin' ref again."
Guy on the right does a really good british accent :)
Team of refs sounds cool
It was Essex... you know...
In hockey, I've scored multiple goals directly hitting a referee's skate or something and the puck went in and it counted. I've also scored a goal on my own net one time that counted for the other team on a delayed penalty call I mistakenly thought was on our team.
As a referee I can confirm this is in fact a rule. That's why in training they tell you to never to stand in front of the goal.
soccer = football football = american rugby/football
I'm from the UK, and I'm actually borderline offended by that accent.
Not as crazy as the goal scored by the ball boy.
Is there really the need to be so racist throughout this video?
The best way to get yourself killed
How great would soccer be if all the refs were running around trying to score goals against both teams? I might actually watch then.
shabi nation
i'd like to say that ref wouldn't have continued to do it given the extreme circumstance of why he did it, if he really wanted to do it more he probably would have done it that game
u are annoying guys to me.
Totally legal for the ref to score on purpose... Gets suspended for 7 weeks...
Team of referees? = The New England Patriots
I get the impression you pair don't know what sport is. The types of "i forgot my kit again" types.
I dont play soccer... i play football... wtf is soccer?
The refs already have their own team its called Real Madrid
Disliked when i heard soccer
Football
Clickbait?!!!??
The attempted accents are awful and cringy, it’s a goal not a point and there are much more stereotypically ‘English’ place names (in Essex we also have Six Mile Bottom for example)
Yeah, but did Nintendo retweet the Toad?
He said you get a point... I hate americans
Should a referee be called for being offsides?
I can't believe the fact that the ref did get the living daylights beaten out of him
I honestly don’t follow a single professional sport (though I know how all the American ones are played), but this series cracks me up.
Pointkeeper
Ok, the ball is still in play no matter where it hit the ref right? So a ref could literally pick up the ball and run into the goal and it would still be in play.
Wouldn't it be crazy if the ref scored early on in the game and that came down to the winning goal?
ITS NOT SOCCER IT IS FOOTBALL
I’m a soccer ref for kids and I swear on my last game I’m doing this
? this is a sport? look....... unless an internal combustion engine is involved its not a sport. its just adults arguing over a ball..
Ugh Ryan's so cute
It's football not soccer.
A wild pat appears
Was binging through these and heck! It’s a surprise Pat Gill! The coolest floppy-haired socialist gamerboy this side of the Mississippi!
I've lived in Essex my whole life and I've never even heard of these places! Also, I play hockey, which has rules and not laws.
Do any of these video comments have any video footage to prove it ??? Or they just sit and talk and we don't know if any of this is true.... but just only talk. Cuz there's footage of almost every aspect of every sport right ???
Ref team sounds cool, but how about a square field with four goals and four teams... hell throw another ball in there too.
Soccer
0:06 if ya ever wanna see this happen , I recommend looking into james milner’s own goal in the liverpool vs roma game (2018 champions league semi final) ball flew off the poor lad’s head and into his own goal ??
Thank you for satiating my love of weird rules.
I can't focus on the video because the British ref's last name is Savill. I'm too busy imagining the ref as a friend of the Queen and English knight who maintains dual careers as a murderous pedophile and host of several BBC programs.
I wonder how British people feel, watching two Americans talk about their sport of "soccer" while doing fake British accents, lol. It must be like watching two Brits talk about "American rugby" while doing fake Texas and valley girl accents, haha.
Dude in plaid actually does a believable British accent for me. I feel like English can do American wayyyy better than the other way around.
What would the stats look like
Wtf i literally lived in earls colne and had no idea this ever happened. Classic Brian
I'm from Essex....and this is a story we tell all the time on sundays. P.S. No one in Essex talks like that down here haha
Idiot on the right keeps referring to goals as, "points". Stick to what you know.
this british accent/calling a goal a point thing is so damn cringy
These guys look anemic, all that soy doesn't help?
OMG Pat, hiiiiiiiiii
How can you say your sport has credibility a if referee thinks he can do this? Seven weeks wasn't enough.
God, what a pair of Melvins.
If the ref thought he unfairly blocked the initial shot that would have otherwise been a goal, then good on him! Seems fair. Make up goal for the one he prevented by being in the way. But if the shot that hit him wasn't going in, then WTF? I would be more pissed if I was in the losing team! Because the only thing worse than critique is well deserved critique; I imagine that the only thing worse than having a ref give you charity is that it was much needed charity. P
Jokes on him, mike dean already plays against arsenal
These people have no idea what they are talking about
The dude with the long hair sounds like the asian dude from buzzfeed unsolved
I played for an amateur team called Refs United FC. We were all licensed referees, and some of us were even officials in this same amateur league! We were also the most argumentative, dirtiest team in the league!
That's hilarious, I'd love to me meet this guy
These guys no nothing about soccer
The Laws also say referees should act in accordance with the spirit of the game. There’s no way a deliberate action by the referee that alters the score other than a decision concerning the players’ actions is in the spirit of the game.
I’m sorry 18-1 I have a harder time believing the score line rather than what the ref did. I have been playing Sunday league for 10 years and have never seen a score line like this ??
You know someone has no clue about soccer (or has ever talked to anyone who does) when they call goals "points" :/ ew.
If what he did wasn't technically against the rules, how could they suspend him?
Can we get Ryan and Patrick to the gym?
Good video but I believe that the rule could have been interpreted so that the referee's action did not count as a goal. The rule contemplates a "rebound" off the referee, not a voluntary decision by the referee to direct the ball into the goal. Otherwise, there is a patent flaw in the system which could allow referees to decide the result on the field and also require the defending team to defend the referee as well as the opposing players. Didn't they seek legal counsel on this?
What about the time a shot deflected off a beach ball and went in and it counted as a goal
Um polygon?
this is why soccer is such a shitty sport
These guys shouldn’t talk about football again
I instantly clicked off when he said a point
Americans talking about football smh
It was not bounced off of him or brushed off in play. He actively kicked it in, that was not allowed in the rules you showed. "Saville", was he a relation to the sick pedo j saville thay they all gave up after he died, so they could appear to be "good" and avoid having themselves looked at while it also prevented any justice being served?
2:45 terrifically *
Guy on the right kinda looks like Dwight's friend
They're also called 'goals', never 'points'
Who are these soy boys
Jon Bois Jon Bois
why do they sound like Shane and ryan from buzzfeed
WHERE IS BOIS :(
I dont understand, what sport is this?
I haven't checked but you should do a video about Jean Segura stealing first base, when he was on second
Unfortunately Brain has passed away now, but his spirit lingers on in his funny acts such as these
There copying buzzed feed supernatural
42,965th view 956th like 89th comment
The funniest thing about this is if you go DEEPER into the rules, it's basically worded in a way that DRIBBLING the ball is ILLEGAL
All you Americans who don’t knows anything about these two teams, They are both Sunday league teams, It’s anything goes it’s a dangerous place
Unprofessional from the ref, course he should have been suspended. Also it’s a goal not a point and football not soccer.
This dudes comb-over... Presidential!
You guys have good topics, But this format of asking stupid rhetorical questions is terrible.
Nice grout fit dude
If Patrick kicked a ball off Ryan's head and it went in, Ryan would be credited with the goal.
A team of refs would just make themselves win. Foul! Auto goal!
Announcer: "3-3, just a minute added time...- The referee scored! And the winner is- the ref! " Every single game the refs win.
This is an instance where this one goal did not affect the outcome of the match, and thus should have been allowed without consequences for the ref in question. had the match been closer (say, 2-0 or 2-1 at the time of the offending goal) the goal should have been rescinded and the ref suspended
This is not Jon bois
When garbage ball gets so bad they just tell the ref to lend a hand to the losers ??????
for the love of god, they are not funny.
I'm Intentionally asking for John Bois... John, where you at?
Bring back Ufford, Bois and GIF guy!!
So you are doing videos about amateurs matchs?
PAT!
A ball boy can score a goal too. Happened a few times I think and the goal by rule has to count
This channel is Pretty Good, but there is someone even better
Bois or unsub
The B in SB Nation is Bois
calling a goal a point, makes me cringe
Uhhhh... Ten pounds to Essex FA?
Oh did Polygon put Pat on waivers or was there a trade?
is this what happens when Vox fires all the unionizers? Polygon has to help SB nations make videos?
This kinda reminded me about a thing that happened in 1930 World Championship. In semifinals Uruguay vs Yugoslavia a police officer that stood behind Yugoslavian goal just stopped the ball that was shot by Uruguayan player and kicked it in the goal. Brazilian ref had to allow it because the home crowd was armed(they celebrated the goal by shooting in the air) to the teeth and really keen on Uruguay going to the finals.
AHH IT'S PAT!!!
“Fifa are doing pretty good,” I wouldn’t exactly agree with that statement.
Jon Bois or Riot
ayyy I live near Wimpole
RefC would be an unstoppable force
Whitest guys on earth???
why is patrick gill, a good video game boy, on sbnation
The world needs more "Weird Rules". Keep 'em coming!
I see Pat has been caught by SB Nation after being released by Polygon for his performance in the Winter Video Games.
There's also this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_4%E2%80%932_Grenada_(1994_Caribbean_Cup_qualification)
Pointball is fun gamesport.
2:44 "I know FIFA's doing great . . ." Nope, couldn't get that one out with a straight face.
They’re called laws everywhere
Sounds like something that'd happen at a regular Sunday League game
For those of you non soccer fans...the craziest thing about this story is the 20-2 score.... that's like a 102-10 NFL score... But another good video, this is an interesting series
Love these videos but, it’s not a point it’s a goal
Obligatory Pretty Good joke
Soccer could take over as the US most popular sport?
This is a weird video for Polygon but ok
This is hilarious.
Brilliant
Second

Thanks for all your suggestions... As promised, here's your version of the Top PL comebacks video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNobZcmrBKA
Football is life
"That's goodnight Tottenham Hotspur". United!!!
9 music name
What about 4-2 vs Arsenal?
Pls make UNITED GREAT AGAIN!!!!
The difference between a club like mu and Real Madrid is that mu knows how to respect their legends which real doesn’t. I feel proud to say glory glory mu
Why can't the team playing like one of these comeback right now ??
and 6-1? (city)
I'm from Angola and I love this club <3
Imagine not including the comeback against Tottenham in 2009
“One of the all time great comebacks” “the comeback of comebacks” stfu LOOOOOL such a terrible commentator. It’s Blackpool in the cup bruv
Manchester United the true comeback kings
GGMU!
Steward Gardner commentary. I'll watch elsewhere thanks.
Now it was 2-0 down against Newcastle they won 3-2
Beckham is da best
2010 -2011 the power of van persie and chicharito
Lmao u can tell Berbatov hated passing to Chicharito
Now you should put the come back vs new castle
Becks V.Nistelrooy era forever NO.1. . . . . Miss watching them play so much . . .
I thinks that needs a little upgrade
who in here after Man Utd comback 3-2 New Castle
anybody else here after the Newcastle game?
And then the last match
United is the best
No 11. HT ManU 0-2 Newcastle. FT ManU 3-2Newcastle, EPL 6/10/2018. MANU FOREVER. From's VIET NAM. ??????
Where is the comeback of man city and man utd 2-3 .... that was lit . Pogba??
Let's see them come back & return to their former glory. ?? No chance!!
Arsenal fan here??
in the #1 game: Blanc, Veron, Van Nistelroy, Neville, Beckham. How united miss having players like that
Why isn't the the game against Tottenham here (5-2) ??
I miss Fergy time!!!
We want to attack, We want to attack!!! We're Man united we want to attack.. Attack Attack Atttack
Where is Manchester United won 4-3 against Newcastle United?
You forgot Man Utd 3-2 Man City (Premier League 17-18). That's the greatest comeback ever
Lol... now it’s time to come back club as well.. is Jose sacked????????????
Manchester derby 2010??? 4-3 come back??? Thats one of the greatest Derby's
What happened to Chris Eagles?
WHO MISS THE OLD UNITED WHO MISS 2000-2013 WHO MISS SIR ALEX FERGUSON
At the end of the video do u hear the crowd saying chealsea
The macheda goal just isnt the same without the other commentary
Where is the Manchester Derby. 3-2 Manchester United at the shittyhad
Top 10 goal saves by degea and sar
Wow we really made spurs fans cry
it’s manchester united culture
MU always in my heart <3
Manchester United, King of Comebacks
The no4 game made me miss Fergie era united??????????
Did I see Fergie dancing dancing during the Blackpool game??????
Lads, it's Spurs.
2017/2018 man city 2-3 man united is the best
What about when united went 2-0 down and ended up winning 5-2 against spurs back in 08/09?
MU V MC 17/18 should be here. I was watching the game through the TV and after I saw the first goal of MC, I instantly turn off the TV and go to bed ( cause i live in Asia so the game usually start at midnight ). When I woke up in the morning, It really make me shocked and excited after i know that MU won the match. It was the best moment of my life supporting MU. Who says MU do not a miracle moment like that anymore
The 17/18 game where pogba score two goal against man city should be here
I think best come back mu vs Bayern in final champions leage
One thing i remember about the 2012/13 season was the amount of games in all competitions where we've had to come from behind to win
Make United Great Again!!!!
Best moment ..Love United..??????
Ferguson time
Legend player .
U missed one the game at Old Trafford where spurs we leading 2-0 at halftime. Then we won the match. Rooney Ronaldo berbatov all scored in a classic encounter. One of the best matches at Old Trafford.
babi haram dimakan
vs Middlesbrough the best end year party and feeling ever
I miss Van Persie
where is the comeback from 2-0 down away against Man City last season?!!!
No one can bend it like Beckham.
Why is mou still here go please before juve at home or young boys away
That Giggs pass to Cantona was insanely beautiful
This is the old Man.utd we've known but now ... so sad but true
that will take a lot of time now to see the old UNITED :'(
Ronaldo ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??
Is Alan Partridge doing the commentary ????
why can't united play like that now
Nothing here compares with Istanbul... Just Saying
Miss those glory days
Class that’s how United should be playing , I miss how we don’t play like this at the moment ??
Degea-cesar Valencia-Maicon Bailly-samuel Lindelof-lucio Shaw-zeneti Matic-Cambiassi Fred-motta Pogba-stankovic Lingard -sneider Sanchez-etoo Lukaku-milito
Degea-cesar Valencia-Maicon Bailly-samuel Lindelof-lucio Shaw-zeneti Matic-Cambiassi Fred-motta Pogba-stankovic Lingard -sneider Sanchez-etoo Lukaku-milito
Where is Man U 3-2 Crystal palace 17/18 and Man U 3-2 Man city 17/18
this is the reason no matter what happens , we keep supporting man united .. GGMU . RedDevilForever
What the hell MU right now!
I miss that winning attitude these days
Bayern vs man u 1-2
We missed that determination & passion yesterday :(
No champions league final 1999 v bayern?
Today's game tho Mark the date
Man Utd vs Bayern 2-1 comeback? To win the treble?
you missed our win against city last season mate
Commentator is awful
Such a shame you posted this before this season's away City game
utd 3-2 city the game last season remember?
Man city vs Man u EPL season 16- 17, ended 2/3. Man city was up 2/0 then Man u came back with pogba scored a brace.
Actually couldn't finish the video coz of the commentator just worse than watching united play under Jose mourinho
Beckham's expression after scoring is the epitome of a united player. Never Die
The 4-3 against Citeh when Owen got that 95th minute winner!
The commentator for the games against West Ham and Blackpool is APPALLING! Every comeback is the comeback to end all comebacks!?!?
Where is MU 2-1 Bayern UEFA Champions League final 1998
5-2 v Spurs 2009?? 2-0 down at half time
Beckham Beckham!
And that is goodnight Tottenham Hotspur
Fu*&* commentary
From 0-3 to 5-3 blownmind
Wer is the champions league final vs Bayer & Tottenham 5-3
manchester the biggest History team in the world
woooooooooow we were sick during fergies era sad i was 12 or 13 when fergie left only seen rubbish football as a teenager and didnt watch regular football before 2013
17!!! machedddddddddddddaaaaaaaa
who's chris eagles loooool
miss the giggs hernandez berbatov days
the west ham 4-2 game ive been looking for that for some time still remember it i think rooney got banned for swearing into the camera after his pen comeback?
??????????????????
Commentator is Awful
look at the fire and attitude of the players in these games.
The greatest comeback was the Champion's League final in 1999. The whole game it felt like United had no chance. And stopped attack after attack from Bayern. And a crossbar. And yet they clawed back in it...
And where is the comeback against Aston Villa in 2012/13 when Chicharico scored 3 times??? and he was substitute. No chicha, no like.
???? ????? ??????
We miss ronaldo
Forgot one big one City Vs Utd 4-3 to Utd Owen scored in extra time
Best play pirmeir league Manchester united?
I want CR7 BACK in united
MU forever
Where is ManUnited 4-3 Newcastle??
most of epic comeback came from fergie's era...
epic comeback
really legendary
miss. those. moment.
Ronaldo Back!
united 5-2 spurs? city 2-3 united?
Just recommendation, Man U 2 Chelsea 1 and Man U 3 Man C 2 both in 2017-18 season.
1-0 to 1-2 isn’t a comeback it’s easy
Rooney my best player ever at united
I miss Ronaldo at the team
Always Comebacks needs Beckham! Glory united??
What a club!
Berbatov tells a story, that right before United beat Spurs 5-2 in 09, Fergie had them watch the 5-3 win from 01. Coincidentally they were 2-0 down at halftime.
wheres martin tryler commentary for mechada?????????????
All super united games.........
I wish Crystal Palace vs Man UTD and City vs United was here ..... Those matches this season were awsome especially against City was amazing
City 2-3 United at Emptyhad 2018 was best
RvP the Real Beast! ??
MU epic comeback
what type of dance is pogba doing
i love manchester united
As always the best team in this world
ggmu
No 2 is the best for me! Ggmu??
the first game I saw and unforgotten were Spurs vs Man Utd, even though only second half.. but that match made me loved football and Man Utd until now..
THE UNITED COMEBACK!
What about the recent Manchester derby comeback fellas!!
Arsenal 7 Reading 5
Can you please show the time
Park please
Where's Martin Tyler?
You should keep the score up so we can tell what the score is. The score you give at the beginning is confusing...is that when the video starts or when the other team scores or what??? Just a thought!
Comeback kings
Van persie vs saints ????.... The song as well ?? is brilliant.... What is the name of the song?
I want to live in the past
Rooney back to United
You've got to put the derby game from last week lads
Miss U RVP ??????
Chelsea
You could wait with this video for this year's Etihad derby.
Man City 2-3 Man Utd
I would like Jose to bring back Chicharito if Martial leave Old Trafford
Berba is so underrated
I miss ferguson af
City 2-3 United would be here
GO GO MU....
How about that 3-0 comeback vs Chelsea in 2011? That was vintage united
Now you have to add the great comeback against city :)
the latest match vs Man City@Etihad...!! ABSOLUTELY CRAZY..!!
Bayern vs Utd 98/99 Champions League Final should be no.1.
Update it!!
New update is required for the Manchester derby of 2018. Great memories.
City 2-3 United 07/04
Dont to forget the derby game 2-3 hehe
Missing 3-2 when City should have won the league
Sometimes in the future, we should include THE Manchester Derby, when United confirmed Manchester is RED
Might need to add one
Todays win should be on this
Just got today's derby game to add to that list :D
There were some fantastic comebacks in that video!! Love watching the Red Devil's making me proud to be a Utd fan!!!
Javier Hernandez's United career should be up here. What about Spurs 5-2 and of course Munich 2-1?
miss rooney young
This club makes me so happy ????
I love Manchester United
To me, the best Utd comeback has to be the 1999 UCL Final
Me Love Manchester United forever
Mata is the best
Merinding??????
beckham curve ball is the best thing ever happened
I guess you guys should be adding the Crystal Palace comeback huh ?
Manchester is always red
Was weird seeing ronaldo celebrate when someone else scored
Coming back is our culture GGMU
Crystal Palace 2-3 Manchester United Yet another Comeback
Chicaa Is A gem...
2 great comebacks back-to-back in the PL since this video was posted.
The way ball is flying in the air, with clinical finishing. What a love
best
who’s here after the palace game?
We need a new vid... 3-2 Crystal palace 2018 WOW
Best comeback Man Utd vs Bayern Munich UEFA Champions league final 1999
The game between man utd and man city that ended 4-3 should be included as well
#11 Crystal Palace 2- Manchester United 3. March 2018!!!!!!!!
RVP IS ORRROSPU EVLADI
??????????
Some great comebacks come on United
That Middlesbrough game was the best game under mourinho. It was like the United of old
Lads, it’s Tottenham
MANCHESTER UNITED IN MY HEART!!!
I think Manchester united vs tottenham 5-2 was worthy of this list.
Brian Kidd running on the pitch celebrating is iconic as hell.
R10
Memories worth their weight in gold.
come back kings
nice comebacks may i know what is the title of the background song is used in the #9? :)
ye!!!
You must add tunnel cam videos.Greetings from Bosnia ?? GGMU
Mint
Hello
Oy sir Alex
I'm sure if it wasn't PL only then the 1999 champions league final would be here
Van perse :(
Viet Nam  : ok
11)Leicester city vs Man Utd (5-2)
Then: its Spurs lad Now: its Man United lad
Wayne Rooney ??
best channel ever!!!!!!!! love united stand and the full time devils ..but this is the original legend
its tottenham lads....
Being honest i am a Manu fan but it was extremely boring video
Manchester is my life
If this was all comps, it would be Bayern vs MUFC, Champions league final
The Macheda goal was epic
United 4ever ??
Villa vs United 2012/13; Chelsea vs United 2011/12; United vs Spurs 08/09
2-1 Chelsea :DD
Could have made it a top 20 but love the momories. Glory United!!!
Man I miss roomy my old favourite player why was he so bad
What about the Michael Owen winner game against Man City which ended 4-3 ?
GALATASARAY
Only haters dislike these comebacks
There's one more match against Tottenham where Ronaldo and Modric played... I can't remember the scoreline but that too was very interesting.
Hi
van persie uçuyor burda. bizde yatti zepevenk herif
Is this new or already man utd have an official youtube channel???
Vayy v.persie vayy
The music is very loud and noisy
To all Neuer fans, Neuer is an unreal Goalkeeper and is superb with his feet. But when it comes to shotstopping De gea is the best
??????
Algum Br aki?
This compilation epitomises what United is about. We used to win games literally by force!
I think the recent victory of 2-1 with Chelsea also deserves to be one of the greatest comebacks
am turkey abone manchester united i like bekchamm
Hands down the 5-2 comeback from 0-2 against the spurs at half time should be there. That was the day grown men cried tears of joy.
That's a very awesome
Where on earth is the 2009 Spurs game, 5-2? Incredible game and of huge importance. Instead we've got 2-1 Boro.
Lads, it's Tottenham.
happy day
Makes me cry a lil
Chichadios ??
Beckham ??
Manchester United 5-2 Spurs. 2008/09
Red armyyyyyy
Brilliant comebacks
Sir Alex Ferguson years was the best.
I thought the caption said Premier League comebacks but why is there a match from Carling ?
GGMU,,THANKS FOR THE CHANNEL
miss them days
yeah that game against spurs was truly inspirational.Comeback kings for a reason
rename it please this is only united, very dissapointing
Sir Alex was the King of Comebacks.
Tuy?t v?i! Fan ? VI?t Nam di?m danh :))
That just upset
considering how much chelsea had us pinned in the first half i consider that win a great comeback.
fergie time
???????? ????????)
I am a Rayal Madrid fan since childhood.But I still remember there was a time Rayal and Manchester at pinnacle of their form.Rud Vaan Nistle Roy,Giggs,Beckham,Ferdinand,Brown..What an era ?.that was an another level of Manchester.
Magnificent
For me Utd-Tot 5:2 has to be on the list... 2:0 down on OT and some fascinating football in 2 half... CR7, Rooney and others on top of their game, sublime
Vintage united
Great content already on this channel, everybody make sure to like and share this and all the other videos. Congrats to whoever is putting it together....
Ahh Ferguson's emotions <3
Isn’t there a game 3-2 with chelsea in 09/10 season or something ?!
The Champions League Final 1999 should be here
5-2 vs Spurs The Rooney-Ronnie's destruction of Spurs?
I love you Manchester United Meh I come in Thailand
Nistelroooooooy!!!!!!!
Where is our 2-1 comeback against Munich in champions league final???
Idc what u say manchester united is the best
I still remember that 5-3 win against spurs. I already losing hope when the half time whistle is blown and turn off my TV,but a curiosity about how united manage to do something in the 2nd half made me to turn on the tv again and instantly witnessed the first goal, then i choose to stay and the rest of comeback is happened, and then since that day i never doubting united will make a comeback again. SAF is the only manager who can produce such quality play and mentality with such an average squad. The best manager ever be.
should add aston villa 2-3 utd into the video
WE ARE UNITED WE ARE BEASTS
What about the comeback on bayern Munich in 1999
Everybody let's subscribe to man utd
Missing Ronaldo !
Comeback Kings #United4Life
Man I miss Chicharito at the club!
No one club ever can get that remark perfectly Like united
How about the champions league final back in 99?
tu putadsadas
GGMU
those days..
The chant at the end is similar to megadeth's symphony of destruction
lol
lol
I loved Pogba's celebration ??
Manchester United 2-1 Chelsea: 2-25-18
i still hear "Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea!" at 8:17
european cup?
Chicharito 1:40 VIVA México
When you’re watching the second one and realize how old Mark Noble is and how sad it is that he spent his whole career at West Ham...
5-2 against Spurs (Rooney and Ronny) 4-3 against Newcastle (Hernandez winner from a sublime Carrick pass)..
nobody does it better, nobody does it like manchester united. the comeback kings!
Final champions league 99 in Barcelona against Munich
Leeds leeds leeds
About time you Brought the team up to date with social media, I expect to see player challenges and interviews here
For me the best Manchester United comeback when beaten Bayern Munich in the UCL Final 1999
I love my home team i have seen your man united/BEST EVER TEAM i think you should try to get rid of filani and i think your the best maniger in the world your bigest fan in the world George thank you cant ewait for livipoo to play you i wish you luck i hope you win
Plz do a de gea montage of his best saves

Subtitulos en español para los fans de latinoamerica ?

Thank You, Kiko! <3
Tunnel cams! that's all we want
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
LOVE MUFC.
Tottenham 5-3 game
De gea keeper is the best
Rooney is a legend
WEEEEEEEEE LOVE YOU UNITED WE DO WE LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE U UNITED WE DO!!! OHHHHHHHHH UNITED WE LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. CITY IS CRAAAAAAAAAAAAP. Like if you agree
MUTV commentary is so whiny and dreadful
Loving that United are now on YouTube, could watch for hours, just wish we could play as brilliantly as (most) of these United team's did.
3-3 vs chelsea little pea
If only we were watching great performances and passion like that today
The comeback against spurs 5-3 2008/09 was epic and best ever!
2-1 against chelsea love ittt
FINALLY! you guys got a channel im so happy been the biggest manu fan ever since i was little! xxx
We are the best team in the league
United 5-2 Spurs was a very special game in my opinion. 45 mins of Rooney Ronaldo Tevez and Berbatov at their best brutally demolishing tottenham and making absolutely sure that title no.18 was coming to OT. That 4-3 vs city in 09/10. Chelsea 3-3 in 11/12 from 3-0 down 2012/13 season had quite a few comebacks villa2-3 united, united 4-3 newcastle on boxing day, southampton 2-3 united
FC Bayern Final Champions League
The City and Spurs comebacks were unreal, that first time ball from Giggsy for the 2nd against City was world-class.
chicharito i miss you
Cole & Beckham were my 2 favs!!
outside of premier league, i think one of the best combacks would be 1998/99 UCL Final VS Bayern Munich
Training cam's.
I miss those glory days ??
i love it
Replace number 10 with the 4-3 vs city when Owen scored the winner
Just what i needed
IF YOU NOTICED MOST OF THEM WERE FROM THE FERGIE TIME . BACK THEN ALL MAN UNITED KNEW WAS TO "WIN" . THEY HAD PASSION & DESIRE TO WIN. NO FANCY HAIRCUTS ,NO FANCY CARS , NO FANCY CELEBRATION JUST PURE CLASS. HOPE JOSE BRINGS MORE POSITIVITY TO THE TEAM . GGMU??
Machedaaa!!!!!!
comeback kings
United 5-2 Spurs, 2009 should be in there!!
#GGMU #MUFC ??
Literally don't remember number 4 dunno why
plz dont leave man u
Love that RVP hat-trick, I thought we'd blown it when he missed the pen
1:14 Look at how he puts away this half chance. Rooney used to be an absolute predator in the box. Especially around 2010-2011.
Hope the Macheda winner is on here
United United United ????
Man united aka the comeback kings
This channel is AMAZING so far
hello Tottenham
4-3 Comeback vs Man City in 2009 where Owen scored at the last minute
RVP forgot how good he was.
5:14 that assist from Giggs :O
oii , esse time é bom dms
That spurs game was the greatest comeback in PL history
United 5-2 Spurs was a good one
i think the current team is as good as previous teams. just need to be more clinical and lethal in attacking!
The only thing I can say is GGMU
5-2 Against Spurs?
The only people who dislike are definitely city fans just so it has dislikes
Man utd vs liverpool in 1998/99 fa cup.
The game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Feb 2012 3-0 down after 50 minutes and came back to get a draw
Where was the game that Ronaldo scored the diving header against Tottenham?
RVP absolute legend.
This team is the comeback kings/devils
Coloquem na velocidade 1.5x pra ver a dança dos caras kkkkk.
Loved it... ?
Subtitle indonesia please haha
Song ??
United!!!
Sir Alex ??
David Beckham 7!
GGMU....Manchester is and always will be red....
Hes a united fan and a commentator but not showing as heart tbh
Utd 5-2 Spurs 2008/09
10 isn't enough.. more about 30 i think
If only you add the minute of the goal.. it would be much better
Time after time under Fergie we'd comeback from the dead, so many epic moments over the years.
Biggest club in the world man United
That spurs 3-5 United the 1st match I watched live as United fan.that time I didn't even know Man United is country or club Then I started following the matches and become die hard United fan.but you missed United 5-2 Spurs game.
Vs chelsea last night?
Add the tunnel cam videos
Munich comeback???
I'm a massive man utd fan From Jack !
GGMU??????????
Missing the 5-2 vs spurs in 09
What about Man UTD 4-3 Necastle on boxing day 2012? Newcastle took the lead three times and we still won!
Give the dreadful music a rest, eh?
During Sir Alex Era, United were totally something else.. With an unmatched never say die attitude, the game never seemed to have slipped from our hands.. In the post Ferguson Era that attitude seemed to have lost though United are slowly getting back there..
Why are we soo good! ???? Oh yess we are the best. Glory Glory Man United
Up United
We do make it hard for ourselves. But these matches ????
I love united ????????
Honestly you could make a top 50. So many magical moments over the years. What a club. Just what a club.
Vs man city in community shield?
where is the 5:2 vs spurs..not the 5:3 the 5:2
5-2 spurs at home ?
Chris Eagles, very underrated
United 5-2 Spurs ,United 3-3 Chelsea, United 4-3 Newcastle, all should have been honorable mentions. Great list regardless.
This is Manchester United!!!
Great comebacks, awful commentary ??????
No ´99 Champions Final...oh dear, who made this? a twelve years old kid?: C´mon is in the history of football!!!
5-2 spurs instead of 2-1 spurs
What a coincidence. I just searched for a united comeback few hours ago and here we go.
Wayne Rooney ??
You missed the 5-2 against Tottenham in 2008/2009.
