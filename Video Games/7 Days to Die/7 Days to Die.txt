Hehe. Sorry Dora.\n\nEdit: My plane is taking off so hopefully this goes through - the series is taking a break after today. Next Friday is a Frighty Night, then a differenty video the next Friday, then after that a new series!
Brilliant way to end the series guys I was in tears with laughter watching the last 10 mins, the song is brilliant nice work guys
I'm going to miss this show, so so so soooo much??
I love it hahahahahhaha
I dub this piece: Symphony of Carnage by maestro Adahop
Listening to Dora laugh through this entire ordeal was perfect.  Probably the best series I have watched on YouTube.  Amazing job and really excited to see your next project.
that ending was just to much for me seeing some thing so great come to an end. this has been my favorite series ty ada for the great video editing on every episode
A little late with this question but its actually about game play.  Why didn't you guys ever build a castle type set up? instead of digging into the hill near the light house, actually build something on top of the hill and dig a mote?  was it a resource gathering issue, I can understand if the materials are hard to gather, I just haven't played the game yet and I was curious about that side of things.  Sometimes games have a way around that kind of problem, I mean its easily solved in fallout 4 by unlocking you chem station straight away and becoming a drug baron selling Jet to make piles of caps and just buy in bulk lol.  So glad to hear you might revisit this game in the future after they do more updates.
One of the best videos I have ever watched on YouTube or any other medium.
waiting for season 2~~
I've been off 7dtd for a while due to the immense wait time for the new build, and I must say, being linked this play through a couple of weeks ago reinvigorated my interest in this game. Incredibly well edited, great scenes, and endless humour throughout! Great work to you all!
More plz
Is the series over or are they gonna come back for the new alpha update?
My gf got me into neebs gaming about a year ago. Since then I discovered Hank & Jed (got through all hank & jed). \n\nI was having trouble viewing all the neebs gaming videos tho. Not enough time, so I had to quit my job to make more room to watch more videos. You guys are friggen awesome! I think this is my second comment ever on youtube. Keep up the great work Neebs Gaming team, you peeps are legends! \n\nAlso I don't care what games/vids you make, just keep doing them. Hell you can even do one about watching grass grow, I am sure it will be awesome! I am on a mission to like and watch every video!
Ive watched this ep like 5-6 times already best one yet. Sad to see it go but i know there are a few new series coming up soon. Cant wait!!! Thanks Dora for such a great send off lol
I love that rock song at the end great episode neebs gaming.
I'm laughing my head off. This is one of the funniest episodes. Next episode you guys should write a note to self. Do not camp in a death hole on hoard night.
why was ada doing that
1812 overture I played it in concert band, I may look uncultured but I in fact not. What?
Anyone else notice that they use creative for the base now and the trader... Normally I would be mad but its funny to watch
This series was awsome & funny & i hope tha you all will return to it soon for a 2nd series of it. Cant wait
I like how at the start, the little clip was him messing up the game, making it 5x harder, and he also fiddled with the thermostat. Nobody EVER touches the thermostat, that little devil...
This series was an absolute MASTERPIECE!  Amazing work Adahop and the whole neebsgaming crew, this is most definitely my favorite game series!
I got some terrible news today...my girlfriend called it off after a year...i thought it was the worst news i could get today...until i saw the word FINALE in a thumbnail of 7Days to die...it was then i knew true heart break. Please revisit this series...dont pull a \"DICE/EA\"  and veer away from a winning formula for to long(cough BAD COMPANY2 cough!) . This has been your best work...when i watch this series,i get the feeling of family,like you guys are together as family..maybe its the survival,band together thing,who knows...and being an expat in a country away from home for 6 years now,this show always warmed me.\n\nThanks guys,sincerely.
Can you keep making 7 days to die videos
that it?  noooooooo
I want to see red dead and fallout 76.
Doraleus score:1\nAdahop score:10 for creating a great final episode\nLoved this series
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
Favorite part of the video is knowing that:\nThe room was terribly build structurally\nThe strategy should have been a flawless success\nThe strategy would have been a flawless success if Dora had built the room the right way round\n\n\nActually though, the way to get to the room from the rest of the house was where you expected the zombies to come in from. If you had built it the other way, its more likely that the zombies would have gone down the hole. Absolutely hilarious video anyway guys. Enjoy the break and I hope you enjoy an eventual second season
:( i want more !!!
This series will be missed :'|
I hope they do another season. This series is great. <3
Aw, I didn't want this series to end. But that- THAT was perfect! Everybody at their finest!
Thia makes me sad but happy hope to see something new and dangerous soon ;) much love to u guys ?\n\n#simon4life
jesus....that was an absolute bloodbath
I didn't think that there could be a hole worse than Courtney Love's band but I was very, so very wrong!
This is the best 7days to die video
Best saved for last! Thanks for the map download Adahop!!
The Doraleus inner monologue segments of this series were my favorite part.
\"Wow, what a hole\"\nName that movie
i liked the parts about colorblind plushophilia
great series. i watched most of its first half in non-chronological order, and with the chronologically changing locales and constructions/demolitions, it was a simple mindgame to solve for chronology.\n\nspoilers are really minor towards the fun of piecing together some causality.
Went from looking like it was going to be the BEST horde night to he worst one BY FAR!!! Good word Doraleous!
Dam u guys died alot lmao good job thou
7 days to die was your best series so what now..
One of neebs gaming's best videos ever. If you don't come back to this series I will disown you.
Loved the music in the beginning of this episode it created and adventurous mood.Almost like the beginning of a movie or epic tale.Would like to see sumthing similar in future videos.-Simon I'm still waiting for that sandwich video,I lack the judgement and pallet to craft a \"Simon Sandwich\" Teach your wisdom
Absolutely the best end to the best series I know on Youtube!  You are are so funny and make these things so very entertaining.  Keep up the good work and I look forward to your next series, whatever that turns out to be!  :D  Loved the nefarious intro too!  You all rule.
Wow guys gonna miss watching the show
Love u
wow...you got some good ass editing and effects skills...….  I started recording my game with 2 friends..but I rented a server so if im at work..they can play if they wanna.  ….just lowed a day length to 1 min so jack it from 30 days to 70 cuz our blood moons are pathetic.  but wow..your editing skills are awesome...and audio.  crystal clear
Wait this is the last episode
I remember watching your guys animations years ago as kid. Whether it was BFF or Doralious and Associates, I always had a good laugh. When Neebs Gaming was made, my brother and always had a good time talking about what went on in Ark or 7 Days. And now that he's a Marine and I'm a soldier attending AIT here in Fort Sill, I have a much greater  appreciation for you guys. What I'm trying to say is, from the bottom of my heart I thank you for filling our lives with laughter, and keeping both my brother and I sane while away from home. Love you guys!
That was so funny and an amazing masterwork of editing, for a future series you should look at playing some 7 Days to die modded or a game called Subsistence
Love that intro though
Doraleous is the Thick of 7 days to die
So much blood
Is there gonna be a season 2?! Or is this the end
The Doraleous Score was very generous . . .
Guys, for future reference, the zombies are attracted to the players position. If you are underground, they will just dig towards you. You put the hole too far away from you, that's why nothing was falling down the hole. I'm wondering if you knew this already and did this anyways to make  it more interesting. Thanks guys, I'm going to miss this series!
The beginning got me hyped
When i saw the ceiling crumble the first time, i knew it wouldnt be a great day
I hate Edited comments so much!
Great series! It will be greatly missed!
This was hands down my favorite series on this channel. I am truly sad to see it end. You guys did a fantastic job on it, I hope you guys return to it some day
Anyone else notice at 14:30 that on Dora's screen you can see that Simon has died 70 times? xD Poor Simon.
Simon just got\nNAE NAED
I love the song at the end
TV, movie, or video, this is one of the best series I’ve ever watched!!  All of it, the acting, the production, even the music.  Thank you!   \n\nAdahop, pulling up Doraleous’ one tactile mistake “4 days earlier” was priceless.  ?? That’s G.I.B.J. all the way, Doraleous, lol.  Beautiful!
Ya'll should do random gen instead of Navezgane! Much more challenging!
We will miss these men and we will not forget the things they did
This. This. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I love my wife too......but this....
nooooooo
Fuck no! Don't end
Appsro has 16 torches.. as in 16 candles?
Oh yey August 19th was my birthday
well seeing that this series is now over i bet your looking for a new survival game there for i nominate starbroud
... why... why the hell would you digg your self into a corner and have the only exit where they come in... im just why XD i love your stratergys
This was my favorite series
Adahop, the editing with the 1812 overture was brilliant! Well done
NOOOO THIS IS MY FAVORITE SERIES IT MUST CONTINUE!
I have to admit this was the best laugh I had in days. Wonderful vid :)
Why end it
If this is infact the last run of the series having it go out on a colossal fuck up is a great way to end it.
That music at the start reminded me of a classic Christmas movie
You guys are getting better and better at presentations, this was more entertaining than all of your past episodes put together, and far surpasses that of anything else I've seen on the game by anyone else.   Great production value.  Little harsh on the language, and using God's name in vain.  But you guys are really talented, and work well together.   How did things turn out for you guys?  You haven't been active because of the hurricane, did you manage to recover, or will it affect the future of Neebs Gaming?
This was definitely one of if not the best episode yall have done. I feel the only thing that was missing was dora's annoying ass alarm.
On year ago this series started and i watch these videos since October 6 2017
It's Soo funny how he turns down the heat. Haha. And the fact he Pressed A lol.
that lag tho
was that really adahop? and if so do you guys know that he changed the settings?
Hey guys, in panama city just after hurricane michael destroyed the place, this video had me laughing so much through this tragedy, very much brightened my day, thanks guys keep it up!
Is neebs gaming gonna end ;(
Entire time just waiting for one of them to step on a mine. I leave the tab with the video a few seconds before they blow up the dynamite without pausing it. All i can think is \"just as i predicted\".
Fucking gold... By far my favorite episode!
Wow, it takes about two months for a new horde night to come out (7 weeks)
This was quite a finally. Honestly enjoyed the hell out of this series. It was fun to watch. And I’m gonna be honest I binged this whole series in a week. From beginning to end. And I finally reached the end and I’m only a few days late. You guys rock
Great job on the videos fellas! <salute>
Best series from this channel. I wish it wouldn’t end so soon because there’s still a lot of possibilities for places to live and whatnot. Hell, instead of rebuilding a town, why not completely build your own? Build a giant wall around it that’s as impenetrable as can possibly be. I hope this series doesn’t end and will continue on. Here’s an idea, there could be episodes where everybody lives in their own place and defends it by themselves. Gives everybody a lot of space for their own ideas and there could be a town where you all meet up and exchange stuff that you need for stuff and have payment for those items, like a trader, but with varying prices or trade stuff like weapons or essentials. Basically everybody lives on their own, but everybody helps each other out and it’s further off than just down the street. It could possibly make things interesting.
Haven’t watched it yet but plz don’t let this be the last
are they done playing this?
Have to admit Im sort of sad to see this series end but its for the best.  The game is dead and you guys didnt really get the stronghold concept down anyway.  Hell did you even make a forge the entire series?  LOL!  You guys were so busy moving around the map you never really got a chance to make a funny series out of  this game.  You do the same thing with ARK but at least there there's no zombie hordes coming after you so there are definitely funnier moments in ARK than this game.
another great series is finish..  this brings  tears in my eyes i don't know what's or why for because  of the 7 days to die end or because of the how funny this episode was.. but anyways its been a wonderful series i've watched it since day 1. hope you guys make more like this. i love it! and i always listens to your commenting on comment while i'm working.. hope to hear you guys read this comment. thank you!
Going out on a massive high. Brilliant episode. It will be missed.
All that hard work doralious, for nothing????
CAN YOU GIVE US A FACE REVEAL?????
Thank you neebs gaming crew for taking us on this hilariously frustrating but glorious adventure. I for one have enjoyed the ride, many laughs, tears, and fuck yourselves later have left me wanting more while also wanting to kill myself from your constant stupidity(still lol's). Hope you return to the series one day but if you never do thanks for the laughs. I enjoy all your content keep up the good work you glorious bastards! I almost forgot to thank old doraleous for making the best looking, but ultimately useless horde night bunker. You almost had it, but you dropped the ball. And you have no one to blame but yourself, you left the holes open doraleous. You invited them in, and in doing so turned what was supposed to be a safe place to ride out the night into a personal tourtue chamber for everyone...
\"SEASON\" Ending? Not series?
Lads this series has really been a pleasure to watch. I have laughed and cried tears of joy watching it.  You crack me up and are the best you tubers by a flying mile.
Single greatest 7days video
So, what happens now?
Would love to watch you guys play the forest lol with all these shenanigans
Doraleous should have just rigged the place to blow as like a fail safe. Just line the place in tnt. And bring the place down on all the zombies and them.
This is an absolute masterpiece.
Adahop, more of the ghosts when someone dies in any of the games you guys play , like Simons ghost, that was a nice touch. Great job. I hope to see more of that in the future. Really good idea.
It's sad to me this is over even if it's just for now. I was hoping all of you fine gentlemen would try the random Generated map. Given its random maybe each of you could start one choose the best one and invite the others to that world. On another note doras plan would of worked if it was all under ground with no block ceiling, only rock and dirt ect ect, I've actually made a simular base with an underground drawbridge over a casm filled with spikes. My favorite series by far. But if you guys get together and play fallout 76 in a similar way to this , then I'll have a new favorite.
Great editing for the fight montage. Loved the series. Sad to see it's done. Hope we have something as fun in replacement.
YAYA! GOT THE GOLDEN PLAY BUTTON NEEBS! GOOD JOB (even though he wont see this)
Rip seven days to die
Well guess it’s time for you guys to go back to Minecraft winks repeatedly\n\n\n\n(pls don’t)
I'm sure you will address this on the next commenting on comments, but why end both this and GTA?  Tired of it?  Making room for new stuff?  Low views?  Waiting for new content to be added to continue?  Also, is Ark on the chopping block?
For the next 7 days to die series (if you even make a second one) you guys should make it a pvp series against each other without a hord night but where you can raid each other
The doom tomb
That was the most overachieving fail ever. Well done.
Guys, I have loved watching you play 7DTD and will miss it. My 75 yr. old mom and I started playing after watching you play. We call the Bald zombie that wears the jeans and white tee shirt Thick because it looks kinda like Thick's GTA toon. So one day we were playing and my mom was killed and I asked her how she died and she said \"I got Thick'd.\" Hope this gives y'all a good laugh.
5:10 you cant make that door. Ownly cheat it in  ??????
please do! this series was fantastic guys but looking forward to the next one. Dammit Dora, you brilliant moron! You got everyone thick'd
as someone with too many hours in this game, it's been fantastic watching you all play it. can't believe it's been a year <3
That final battle sequence was brilliant! Great edit!
That has to be a record of team deaths in 7D2D all in one horde night
At first i was like wow simon is one of the last ones to die..................... then he never prevails to die 100 times. your the best simon
So Dora... is this what you did with the money from Nom Nom Cat?
This is why you don't do underground bases.
from the prison to journeys end, it was a wild, memorable ride. I now suggest simon plays Stranded Deep
Plz keep going with these videos..
Laughed the whole horde!! AMAZING INSANITY this was hilarious!
OOOOOOOHHHH MYYYYY GODDDDDD!!!! During the horde fight I just had my hands on my forehead with my jaw dropped. And yes, \"I'm in a fistfight with a cheerleader\" is the quote of the series.  Hahahahahahahahaha. Great work fellas, you survived Dora's deathtrap! (Kinda)
August?
By far my favorite episode neebs\nDoralious piece of advice make the pit go all the way around the base\nSimon you are getting better good job
called it! I think this was a much better ending than some bad ass horde mass slaughter. Instead the entire team got slaughtered in one of the funniest ways imaginable. Simon takes the cake and almost killed me laughing...hehe...so good
This has been teh best series you guys have done ever!   That was seriously fun!
It would have been pretty cool if the ceiling collapsed on everyone as they were fighting for the lives and then that is when the season ended
Doraleous is death hole
In another galaxy, four days earlier\n\nEnsign Doraleous: I'm sure this two-meter exhaust port won't be a problem.
those illustrations at the end are amazing!! lol simon has the rug tapped to hes body lmao
best episode ever
Despite having the most impressive construction project, this horde night managed to be the most spectacular failure. A lesson to be learned in all this: Zombies will dig through anything to get to you. I'd like to see this attempted again, though perhaps with two full layers of steel blocks surrounding the safe zone, lol.
But but it cant end..... Whatever you do dont stop doing Ark!!!
I wanna thank you guys for your great series for it has been a joy to watch for not only myself but my wife and kids. We started only last year with your 7d2d series and have watched every week and series. Hope to see y'all try again whenever the alpha 17 come out. Keep up the great work!!!
????????????????????
#Breadstrong
Because I'll never tire of watching Simon die stupid deaths, I suggest you guys do a The Forest mini series.
Holy crap, this is unbelievably similar to that scene in Aliens where the marines see the aliens coming on the motion detectors, but they are actually in the ceilings!\nAwesome vid
Their might be a season 2 when Alpha 17 comes out, their adding bosses, motorcycles, gun mods, gyrocopters, and more to the game
Season finale? But you're coming back sometime soon,i hope??? Please come back some time soon!!!!
Damn just got neeb’d
there needs to be a disclaimer.  \"Do not drink soda while watching this\"....   lol
Doraleous' Death Hole.  The most metal band name ever!
9:30 It was at that moment Doraleous knew.... He fucked up
Last week when doraleis made battle ship I commented he was a building god. I now retract that compliment.
Greatest episode ever....nearly wet myself at work!
I honestly have no words for this video.
sad for seires end
This had me rolling!!
When you guys announced you were going to do 7 Days to Die, I was like booooooring. But I've been glued to this series ever since it aired. So much fun and so many memories.
Fucking love this channel
This was the funniest 7 days video yet, mainly because of the epic fail that was the death cave. Hilarious video, you guys do great work.
Does this mean you guys will have more time for creating new episodes of D&A or Mob Squad?\nProbably not but I love D&A and I hold out hope for more.
Dora that base was very impressive I believe you should get alot of props for making it even if it didn't work in this game... it's not entirely your fault the zombies dont go where you want them too
This is my favorite series on YouTube. Really bummed to see it go, but I'm super excited to see what you guys do with RDR2.
Dame you boys must have something big planned for red dead2 if you dropping 2 of your series cant wait to see it!
If you guys really do end it, please do another survival game, maybe fallout 76. I’d love to see you guys do some PvP.
I remember the first episode, and this last one, and all the ones in between. This has been the series to watch since day one. You guys did an amazing job, please don’t end!
Holy shit this has been the best series I've ever watched on youtube. Thanks Neebs gaming and everyone that has contributed to the making of it.
I think you guys need to continue with a NEW season as the A17 comes out. Love from Romania and don't forget that we LOVE 7 DAYS TO DIE .
Thank you guys so much for this fantastic series. I must admit when you did the poll for what game should you do I hated seeing 7 days to die leading. I'm really really happy it ended up winning this series was super enjoyable I'll miss it.
Neebs, remember when your videos used to get 400k+ views and you had 1/2 the subs you have right now? They used to be so much more entertaining! This is boring compared to the old stuff.
Showed such promise!!
adahop thank you so much, downloading and playing this map was like a dream come true it was amazing exploring through all the places neebs and everyone had been and visted seeing the hibachi cafe, the light house, adahops autoturret shop and more was so fun thankyou for uploading
Nothing built can last forever\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it should last longer than that!
Had to watch it twice because I was crying so hard the first time from laughing.
Please play The Forest!
Been watching this series since the start and loved every minute Thanks so much for the memories.
Thank you, \nThank you for the laughs when some of us are feeling down. Thank you for making us laugh when we are just having a great day. All of you create something that brings thousands of people together to laugh, smile and be happy. I’m a world filled with so much negativity it’s a nice break from that bullshit. Thank all you gorgeous fucking people! Look forward to the next series! \nLoves and Hugs from Montana \nJustin
You'd figure by now that you'll learned that the horde is attracted to you and not heat.
what a wild ride from start to finish! If I may, i'd like to say a little something about everyone~!\nNeebs: micromanaging less and becoming one of the strongest of warriors! \nAppsro: ...really carried the whole team i mean honestly, superb.\nDoralingus: ...you ok?? lost your marbles. but hey, the IDEA was good for this last horde night, but... big fail. \nThick: Learned to stay with the team more and heart growing 2x larger! great job!\nSimon: Saved the best for last. You knew NOTHING and i mean NOTHING for the longest time. had to be taught how to even crouch. but after all this time you learned so much and did great!! \nWonderful job everyone~ hate to see this go but it went out with a bang!
Four days earlier.....just a minor flaw that sounds similar to the death star....
I love all the content you fellas create, but the 7 days content was something else. I will deeply miss this series however I know whatever you guys do, I and everyone else will love it. Keep up the absolutely amazing work you do!!
I will miss this series. My favorite ??????
thank god for Simon
Awesome series, awesome ending.  Good show gentlemen....good show.
Loved this from beginning to end! Goodbye 7 Days to Die. Look forward to watching reruns.
Neebs I'm really Gonna miss this at first I thought this series was stupid. But then when I actually watched it I'm like this is awesome like I said sad to see it go. have fun playing red dead redemption I have also been waiting for it pre ordered it in July.
This was one of the only things i looked forward to every week i hope yall are planning somthing good
By season finale does that mean that you will start over for season 2 on a different map or area?
Neebs you guys should play some Connan exiles.
the somedays mean A17 guys ;) ?
Kinda wish you revisited the other locstions, but this was still a good ending to a great series
u guys need another serious same map just dont let the one who shall not be named build your defences
This episode along with the horde night in the lighthouse are by far the best ones in this series. And this one is just a perfect way to end a series. Everything was well made, thanks to the way you play and Adahop edits. I was actually feeling anxious with all the anticipation. These two episodes I mentioned are the ones I laughed the hardest and for the most parts of the video. \n\nAbout future projects, if you want to entertain, have Doraleous build everything, but if your goal is to have a relatively safe night, don´t let him do anything. \nThe thing the sums up this hole evening is that a bunker where everything seemed well thought out and carefully crafted with all the blades, mines, spikes and the protection wall ends up with Neebs fighting a zombie cheerleader with his fists. \n\nIn the end, I absolutely loved this series, will watch it again someday for sure and I hope that you really return to it someday, if not on this map let it be on the new one. Amazing work by everyone and I can´t wait for the stuff you have planned for us.
No more 7 days??? D:
Damn I can't stop laughing at this video dammit my stomach hurt of laughter
Sad to see it end but my god what a memorable finish. Doraleous's glorious death hole and Adahop's top notch editing. Oh boy how I laughed.
This video reminds me of the last day of high school. I wanted to \"DIE\" 18 times.......
That was an incredible end to an enjoyable season!! I hope you guys do revisit this game in the future. I would love to see you guys create a base from scratch. Until then I look forward to your next series :)
Never got to see Simon build a horde night defense so disappointed.
I hope this isn't the last of 7 days this series is my favorite and id hate to see it go
Time to vote for the next game
Doraleus; you are are a true gem :) don't ever change!
So sad to see it end, but excited to see what is next! Thank y’all for a FANTASTIC finale! ?? It’s been one of our favorites since my husband turned me on to Neebs gaming about a year ago! Seven Days became a big part of date night for us! ???? Keep up the great work!
So can we get neebsyvaina season 2 now please
When do we get season 2, this was brilliant!
“I like to die with a lot of things.” - Simon
???? It's been emotional. What a roller-coaster. Goodbye 7 Days. It's like a little part of me had died. But I'm excited to see where we go next. I wonder what game they have in store for us.
Simon’s acting when he dies, and the noise he makes mid sentence, is so fantastic. I genuinely and without any sarcasm love the way he performs those moments.
Do more 7 day to die videos and i like watching your 7 days to die videos
Aww, I will miss watching this Friday after work. Hope to see more in the future ??
6 minutes and 20 seconds into the episode \"leveling up\" is the exact moment Doraleous doomed you all.  Flashback at 10:15
Oh boy.. i loved this series.. thick singing the song at the end added huge impact, well done Adahop!
7000 deaths to die.
Finale? ur the reason im buyin xb1 n buying 7 days
Thanks guys for making this awesome series :) hope u will pick it up some day again
You played that game already for more than 300h :o
I can't describe what i'm feeling right now, but it's not good :( All my love to you guys <3
Amazing series, hope it returns before too long! Need Simon to build a base!
Utterly fantastic. Great job, loved every minute.
Guys, \nI'm so gutted that this has come to an end, but what a finish, complete chaos as the series deserved.\nYou have turned a game I bought and hardly played, into one of my fave watches on YouTube and a game I play so much more now!!! \nYou are all legends, and i still need to join you guys ha! \nMuch Love x
I hope this isn’t the end because I really enjoyed watching this series from the ground up
Plz hit like on this guys so maybe it can be answered on one of their questions vids. \n\nAre you guys ending this one so you can start on a new one? I know fallout 76 is around the corner, and Dayz is starting to pick up speed on console (which a lot of us console gamers watch you guys too). Just wondering what’s next?
Anybody else smell a Conspiracy going on?
This was the video that I watched untill there was 1% left one my phone glad it was this one
Do a random gen!
Nooooooooooo
this episode is even better the second time you watch it. \nif you know whats gonna happen, it's just great to see how confident they are at the beginning.
This funny as all get out
Had complete confidence with their plan. Then the hoard started.
Anthony you filthy saboteur you! I'd recognize those pudgy hands anywhere!
Great success!!!!
Wall of blade traps and a tower...
This is by FAR one of the best videos you guys have done!! I have never laughed so hard!! LMAO fantastic!
Best video in the series yet. Too damn hilarious all around. :,)
its was verry funny to watch, loved it
so, is this the end of season one of 7 days to die? or the end end? if its the end end, play Unturned next. Its broken and awsome, lots of guns, thick would love it
With this series on hiatus for the time being and the GTA one looking like it's going on pause for RDR2, I make the following suggestion: Have Simon do Conan Exiles for 7 days (or episodes) alone. No help. He can do his own research on the game, but no other help. The game got several updates recently including animal taming, has a basic structure like Ark but with decent NPCs, and even has some quests in it. Have Simon work on the game and setting up a base, town, castle or whatever his architech/homebuilder heart desires, and THEN allow the rest of the crew to come in. Let Simon, for once, try taking the lead.
?????? Bravo guys, Bravo
clap clap clap
thick's original 7 days to die theme is unbelievably awesome...and that's an understatement
An absolutely brillliant ending to an excellent series. Had me in stitches so many times. Definitely looking forward to whatever you guys do next. Thank you all.
You should have had a backup plan to place explosives in the tunnel to collapse it if shit hit the fan. Which, lets be honest, was inevitable.
you guys are the best.  so good.
Season or Series Finale?
So does that mean more time for another series like GTA, Ark, or Scrap.
laughing so much this video. Working a 12 night shift and the other guys in the office were wondering what I was losing my shit, so rewatched it with them now safe to stay Neebs gaming as two new fans as both of them are now binge watching ark and 7 days to die and BFF.
Neebs Gaming Crew, you lightened my path through dark days of illness and depression with all your hard work and humor. If therapy didn't work ... you did. Even if it was only for an hour here and there.\n\nYou may not reach the whole world, but THIS is world peace for me, that's for sure.\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH! There aren't enough words, to describe what you've given me.\n\nAnd being someone who has spent a lot of time lately on youtube, I'd also like to thank this fabulous community. I have never read or felt so much positivity anywhere else!
This was by far the best 7 day i sean from you guys keep up the good work an this is the funniest i sean in a while
Nooooo I want it to keep going
Please do some rust
I feel like those baby hands at the beginning of the video are Simon.
Lmao this episode was amazing I never laughed so hard in a while
Season finale of series finale? ????
Sad to see this series go. But what a clusterfuck to end on. I can't wait to see what you replace 7 days to die with. I was hoping to see Simon prepare for a horde night :P.
Remember on the first episode they all ganged up on a deer and fired the arrows all at once?
Gonna miss this series.
I fucking love every single one of you.
GOLD haha who knew they could dig so much dirtXD
OMG awesome video. The editing is outstanding. Adahop you are a master sir.
That was epic, great ending to the series guys bravo!!!
I really hope another company picks up 7 days for the console. I loved this game.
Every episode i see is the best i have ever seen on the channel ??
Well that went better than expected.
This is now in tomb raider
The FPS arghh
i guess that's me done watching  until A17 arrives, 7 days brought me to Neebs and i don't play any of the other games so i have zero interest in watching them. try some of the modded versions until A17, i'd love to hear the guys when the voices in the night start :)
I say Doraleous experienced water damage during the hurricane, but he started building this long before that. The real evil here is Adahop cranking up the difficulty to Max.
The noises Simon makes when he dies are the best lol
the death noises made me laugh instant
oh season finale i hope not a series finale
Congrats, epic finale.
7 days song version at end of video is best ever. Awesome finale boys. Love y'all.
all I can say about dora death trap is to quote Karl Kraus \" A paradox arises  when premature insight clashes with prevailing nonsense \"THICK44 ROCKS
I wish the air drops wouldn't have been added. I'd rather find buried cashes instead of the airplanes in a post apocalyptic world.  Still love this game
Wait so is 7 days to die really done for?
And here I thought the last horde night was a clusterf**k...
Safest horde night ever
By far the funniest episode ever.... sitting on a bus in Japan literally laughing my ass off! Bunch of Japanese people sitting all around me, staring at the white guy giggling....judging.... but hey! Worth it!!!! Don’t quit this series!!! We love it!!!!!
Best series ever with a really hilarious ending sad to see it go but this will always one my series
so whens season 2 coming?
season final nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!\nthese r the best 7 days to die videos ever!
duckduckgoose
Don’t end it here!
Amazing just amazing ??????
So is this the end for 7days please don’t be
I enjoyed this so much keep up the great content guys.
Wow, the whole series flew by just like that. Welp, time for a rewatch
Well you cant fault Dora, the room did exactly what it was designed to do. Kill. Lol
So...Doraleous Simon Thick'd everyone? Is that another new saying?
doraleous you fuckung idiot
Couldn't have asked for a better ending.
play the forest
I feel like I just watched a loved one die with the ending of this series
This was just what I needed. Thanks ya'll. I love you.
Incredible Cant wait for next time you guys  revisit this game
That was freaking amazing. It was awesome I tell you. Great ending.
Noooo why does it have to end I loved this game you guys are the best but on the up side it was in hell of a way to end
Good episode and is it end of the series? If so why thought, can you kindly explain why? Thx !
Its over, damn i was hoping to see Simons horde night base.
You guys always cancel the best series :(
What game are you guys gunna play and make a series out of now?
Best. Horde. Night. Ever. Thanks guys. You're the best!
it would have been boring otherwise. not much interesting in this game to do.
This is the best 7d2d vid in your whole series might even be one of the funniest if not the funniest vid you guys have made, good job
LOL epic
I knew this was going to happen ever since Dora revealed it.I literally thought \"the zombies are just gonna dig to em\"Btw The zombies will always go to the closest block to the player and dig through the rest.
Hi
i hope you will continue someday and hope alpha 17 will come out soon because with the new system it would make the game feel different
i cant believe how long its been since episode 1 feels like only a few months ago you started this, i wish there was more to come but i'm keen to see what will replace this. love you guys time to rewatch the entire series!!
Hands down the best episode of anything on neebs gaming! And whatever is next on the list is a distant second. You guys have truly outdone yourselves!
Ah man, haven’t laughed that long and hard in a long time!
You guys raised the bar on this one this is easily the best video on YouTube ever I really hope to see more 7d2d maybe war of the walkers mod yall would have a blast with that one please don't let this series die it's too damn good and brings happiness to people who need it you guys rock and Simon for president of neebs gaming lol with neebs telling him how to do it from the background lol
Who wants to see them play Conan exiles?
I laughed so hard my chest hurts now.
Please continue this or start another series like it.
Doraleous just Thick'd you guys.
End of an era. Such a good season of laughs!
So is it over?
If I'm stuck in a zombie apacolypse with doraleous, I am not letting him make defenses, maybe kill him just in case.
Anyone else notice that Simon says: Bob Wire?? As opposed to Barbed Wire? ??
The crescendo on the music was good but with all those deaths back to back I'd have used the death music from Ninja Gaiden xD
Doraleus's Temple of Doom
Lost for words on how spectacularly funny this episode was. Excellent works guys.
If the game's AI wasn't retarded it would have worked fine
Where will my life be without this series?
One vote for sooner than later.
This got me laughing so much it was great. thanks guy for making my day a great one. keep up the content, you are my top favorite channel to watch and have a good time watching you guys. Thanks again MotoIB
So sad to see this series end! It was what got my husband and I into watching your channel... You guys are amazing, thanks for the hours of entertainment!  Can't wait to see what you guys come up with next :)
Is this the last 7 days to die episode ever? If so I am sad to see it go
14:16 simon has died 5 times in a matter of seconds
That was glorious.
Am not gonna lie I didn't like the game but I only liked it because new s and the gang was In it
Loved this video! Great job with editing adahop! I laughed so hard. If you guys are moving on to a new game please let it be one where you all play together and go from day 1- end, like Ark, Minecraft and 7 Days. KEEP IT UP!! Best thing on YouTube
I really hope you guys decide to come back to this game soon, i had a lot of fun watching you guys play it
Bravo! I want you guys to know that you literally create art. I love the way you guys stage your story lines, and the way you execute those stories. Love all of your acting. Your characters are great. Editing is on point, which probably pulls it all together, Phenomenal job, phenomenal channeI.  Your work is truly at the top of the YouTube spectrum. Keep up the great work, can't wait for the next thing you do.  Doraleous, FYI you still owe me twenty bucks from that bar tab in Charleston earlier this year. #FourManMosas.
Ok that didn't quite work out the way you anticipated but we can move on from this. This was an awesome series and thanks for sharing it with us. I look forwards to what's next, you haven't failed me yet. Kisses
Maybe you guys could do another 7d2d series, but everyone starts in creative mode and builds one big horde night  defense base or their own horde night defense base and then they defend said base against a massive horde, especially if you fast forward the days to something like day 1001. The guys could even be given a choice of 5 weapons that are random quality from 450 to max, then allowed to stock as much ammo and supplies as they want. Then Adahop could also spawn in a bunch of zombies of various/random types on top of the horde night ones, up to a random number between 20 and 300.\n\nAfter that Adahop showcases his horde night defense base, while the guys each take turns in creative mode spawning in a random number/type of zombies
Ye got fu#ked up!!
Do you guys plan on going back to playing kingdom come deliverance again now that it's finished? I think all of you except simon would love it
Best horde night ever
You guys should start the Forest!!
Season finale! Does that mean there's a season two? Cause I'd love to have that.
Fucking well done adahop!
omg guys that was amazing\ngreatest fail ever i couldnt stop laughing\nadahop especially insane job with the editing and making the death montage and flash backs
By far the best possible finale ever! That bunker may have collapsed but it made the whole season end just perfect. Well Done!
Best episode ever, Simon I'm sorry but you getting worked over bye those traps was perfect.
SO Here I am With my dinner watching Need Gaming But I cannot eat my food do you know Why??\nBecause I could not stop laughing my  ass off\nDoraleous you are Fucking Awesome I give you a greeting
This was the funniest episode by far! Great work guys. Keep up the amazing work!!
That was fabulous! What a way to go out!
And y’all got Thickd
Please don’t end this series
Absolutely loved this series, great ending, so glad it didn’t end with a cliff hanger.  I like how adahop has his own button. Can’t wait till you guys get back to it.
Well, if there actually is a zombie apocalypse.. I'm teaming with Thick. Least amount of deaths, cause he gets kills not killed. #TeamThick44
That was a glorious cluster fuck!
Thanks for the laughs fellas! I will miss this
What a fantastic episode and I'm really going to miss this series.
So this is it? The last 7D2D? Like ever? Or is this just the end of the season and they're going to another one?
7:46 thats what she said!
Wait is thick leaving?
This was truly a magnificent piece of work from the whole neebs gaming team, Thank you for the amazingly hilarious last episode of 7 days!!!
\"Download the map, just remember to fill the hole\"
So much for just sitting and drinking a beer for this hoard
Fuck ya wat a way to end 7 days????
Fun ending guys
I hate to see this series end, it is what brought me to this channel!  Absolutely fantastic finale. Doraleous always means well...??  I just hope after you take a break from this game- you’ll wanna revisit it. Love, love, love, you guys!  Keep up the great work. I look forward to any content you guys create.
Zombies shouldn’t be able to dig in the first place..good job Dora, that shit was dope
Anyone wanna count the amount of deaths for this episode please let me know
Neebs gaming I just love you guys man??\nYou guys create the best content and y’all are very entertaining
Doraleous sure knows how to throw one helluva Halloween party
Great ending. I am glad you guys are letting it rest, so when the update finally come out we'll be ready for more.
and then everyone died. the end
And also i wanna say that it WAS the torches that made your plans fail.
If you look up what FUBAR means you'll probably find this video. LOL
This is really sad but i think its a good Idea becuase you have already milked this com cus when Youve built a giant-ASS bunker and defaeted like day 50 or so then you have besat the game and hopefully you find another really good series to play. Kisses
Season finale! What am I supposed to do on a Friday now? Go out? Talk to the wife? What are you guys trying to do to me! At least my Saturdays are still safe... Ark is life
best episode so far!!!
I hope its not the end of these series.
Season Finale!?! please don't take too long to pick this game up again. this has been one of my favorite series made by you guys. every time I watch you guys play this game I get the urge to play, then I remember I don't have any friends to play with and it goes away... FML. you guys are the best! keep up the good work!
Omg guys that was the best episode yet! I am holding my 8 month old and woke him up so many times laughing my ass off. This is seriously my favorite series
The Neebs Gaming crew death sounds!
Note to self never let doraleous plan horde night.
That was fucking hilarious...
When building underground bunkers zombies will always go to the closest point to you which is directly overhead fire barrels also do not attract zombies like it says they do capp00 tested this out you were never gonna get more than a few to fall down that whole unless you stood under it the whole time :)
well, that was a cluster fuck.
Please say this isnt the end..
So when they say Season Finale are they ending 7 days. Or are they just taking a break from it. Also the Fallout 76 Beta is coming soon. Maybe you guys should hop on
That was one of the best episodes ever.\nThere have only been a few Youtube videos I have watched that have made me laugh so hard.\nBTW; what was the song at the end?
Ya'll got {°~°}THICK{°~°}awesome job adahop.. keep up da guud work NEEBS GAMING like wise ALOHA NUI LOA
Doraleus! If you’re going to fail, fail spectacularly! This was hilarious. \n\nThank you so much to Neebs Gaming for this awesome show and I’m sad to see it is the end of the season! But all good (possibly great) things must comes to an end. Can’t wait to see what coming next!
Only you guys can fuck up something like this ????
My wife and me love the series , AMAZING !!!!!!!! video you made guys. I hope you make another season with the new updated for 7 days to die
That was great best ep thanks sooo much
I don't know why but I found this series more entertaining than the Ark episodes. Maybe it's because of all the ideas that go terribly wrong.
simply epic!
I miss only one sentence \"We survive the horde night\"
Best Horde Night EVER
The best episode of the series! It's funny how I saw this coming lol
Shouldve called the video simon died
OMG - I laughed so hard!  Congrats on your 1 Million subs ( I am prob late in saying so but oh well) .... what a way to celebrate that.  So many little moments that one could speak of and cheer at or jeer at, but honestly I want to say Thank you for the many laughs and time WELL wasted lol !
Much love and thanks for the beautiful journey guys #DoraTomb
Amazing finale guys! I think i can safely say i've watched every episode since go! I can't wait to see what's next for you guys! :)
This is why we don't cut corners folks!!
Does this mean 7 days to die is over?
This is the single greatest one of the series. I'm so blown away from the intro to the exit. Watching the evolution process, from the editing to the gameplay antics, which takes place with every new release is a thing of beauty. Can't wait to see what you guys do next. ??#KissesCuteButt
Hey for the Next Comment on Comment, this episode was on my Birthday and now I am 27 years old. I have been watching your 7 Days and Ark for a while after work and great to watch after having a bad day. Thick you are the best including Appsro. Neebs being to technical and picky, Lord knows why. Dora you are a cheeky son of a gun and Simon being Simon. I can't wait what's in store for you guys in the future videos.\nPeace out and #Thick44GetsKills
Fuck Man i will really Miss this
Soo goof im sad its over. Bless yr hearts
This is the best episode lmao. Fist fight with a cheerleader. Omg lmao.\n\nSo 7 days is no more? Or just taking a break?
this was the best thing very i loved every second of it. i'm sad that this is the finale video, but ill be really happy whenever you guys do go back to it this was one of your best seasons. thank you guys so much for the great content and for all the laughs. and also cheering up my bad day. i love you guy. and keep making great content
Oh, It was August 19th. It should've been right time to stop playing A16 and wait for A17 to be released. Too bad it's delayed.
This is my favorite  game that you guys did u  did a great job it's sad to see it end
And with this our intrepid heroes learn why everybody lines their bunkers on all sides  with reinforced concrete  XD
Well
That was such a good freaking horde night and a perfect ending to the series.
Favorite Series by far from the beginning to the end it as the best to watch by far.
Thanks Doraleous for making my day, Doraleous for NGP\nSeriously if Dora be the president we will have this kind of fun stuff all the time and I like it this way
No I can't live without this series
Oh Lord that was a damn good video. I've not laughed like that at something for a while. Doraleous, it was such a good plan on paper, I'd have loved to see it all pan out as planned but this was so much better than anyone could have imagined. Thanks for all the amazingly good content guys keep it up. Cant wait to see what else you guys get up to in the future.
This was the series I looked forward to every week. I hope you guys decide to carry on with it at some point, but if not, watching the episodes over again still makes me laugh. Love you guys!
In all the  years I have been subscribed, this is without a doubt the finest, most spectacular creation I have witnessed on your channel, I honestly haven't laughed aloud so much in my recent history. Thank you Doralicious! Doraleous for President of Neebs Gaming, it's no longer a competition.
So funny thank you for the great videos.
Just build a tower and surround it with blades and spikes
This was an AWESOME series!!!!!! LOVED IT!!!! Need shirts for this game too ^_^
AMAZING!! Absolutely hilarious
This isn't a mine it's a tomb.
who knew zombies were so smart
Epic way to end.
Bravo, everyone! Seriously enjoyed the series. If make more, we'll watch more.
i wonder what would the result be without the hardening before
Awwwww what a great way to end a fenominal series I'm going to miss this so dam much!!!
Ah well, might as well end the series on a high note. Thanks a lot for making it (and to Adahop for editing it), it's been a blast to watch!
You guys should do a state of decay 2 series next it's a really fun zombie survival or you should do a coop dying light with appsro and thick
Great use of Tchaikovsky's Cannonball
I can’t express how many laughs and good times you all have given my boyfriend and I over the past two years. We love all of your videos and wait in anticipation for each one to be uploaded. I’m going to miss the 7 days to die series as it was my favorite but I’m hoping you’ll be playing Red Dead soon! We love you guys!!
I like the music at the end i dont normally like rock but i liked that doing
I really hope you guys bring this series back soon
OK, this is the best episode ever made.
Great wrap up video.  Now for some SEA OF THIEVES videos..
Is that Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture? Man this is among the best video of the channel!
My girlfriend and I watch all your videos and 7D2D has been our favorite series. When/if you visit 7D2D again we will be watching.
Is that really the end of the series?
Best ever. \nBest ever from Neebs & Co. \nBest ever 7D2D video. \nOne of the very few re-watchable 7D2D videos. \nI’m going to watch it again, right now, and probably annoy my wife, again, by laughing out loud, while she’s reading.
Hopefully for season 2 will be after next update and random map
Eh, I aint watched just yet but I need to know...\nWhat the hell is meant by \"season finale\"??
Absolutely loved every episode.  You guys are fantastic!
PLEASE tell me you guys are going to start another season in A17
Lmfaoo!  Well played guys.  Hate that's the end I watched the entire series multiple times.  P.s. I could watch you guys die all day.      \"OH NICE PUPPY, BBLEHHH\"  rolling!
I think the guy in the intro is Thick44 because he always claims  \"I ... AM A WARRIOR!!!!\"
Will you be doing another season, this was sooooo fun to watch me and my girlfriend look forward to it every week
Thank you for all the great videos in this season....you guys rocked it
Dangit I thought they noticed that if ur underground the zombie that are on the surface dig right on top of you please pin this so others see
I'm 42 seconds in and I already know it's funny like a midget sjw????
Dora's base sucked so much Simon die here more then all of his deaths added together
So sad to see this series end.?? My Fridays won't be complete anymore. Always looked forward to 7 days episodes, please come back to it when alpha 17 hits. Love you guys!!
My favourite part was when the the zombies attacked...
Ugh... So now it's Ark... :( I loved Subnautica, grew to really enjoy this but have always disliked Ark. Now the two best shows on the channel are gone... >_< Revisit Subnautica or do something similar. :(
This was good
y'know, i thought this would be the most safe horde night they would have, and that it would just be them watching zombies drop and get shredded. Exact opposite
If this show ever comes back, I want to see Simon's action plan for the next horde night. Can't be any worse than Dora's build.
RIP Simon
Now you guys should play empyrion
Rock n roll thick. I'm genuinely impressed with you guitar skills, I'm sure that's you playing. Right on man.
I only think they are gonna make a new season fresh and spawn with nothing again... maybe this is just my theory.\nOr this could be the end:(
Sucks when the horde doesn't follow the plan! LOL
Simon  score : rrraaawwrrbaba(sound he makes when he dies) great finale!
When the music started I was saluting for remainder of video.
The best laid plans of mice and Neebs Gaming.
I have been with you guys since before neebs gaming but I swear to Christ, if you kill this serious but keep playing scrap mechanics, you guys are dead to me.... Ok, probably not, but I will be pretty disappointed
Not your day!
So next season Simon should be in charge of hoard night.
Wait, was this the last video of 7days? I loved this series so much!
This is the best video yet!! So much death and faillure, love it!
Please keep doing some kind of zombie survival game series....even if it's not 7 days to die
I cryed from the laugh ;D But I feel little sorry for Dora He really worked lot for this horde night and it's becomed an epic fail.
hey guys theres a prison by that that green fog place if u guys can I would love to see u guys build there for the next horde its already build to hold against a small horde.
What's that song right in the end?
This is one of the best episodes I have seen. I cant not tell how hard I laughed. From the zombies digging  down to the epic fail of everything. Thanks for the entertainment you guys rock.. well except Neebs because I do not want your heads to swell
\"He wants a torch! GIVE THAT MAN A TORCH!!! \" - Neebs \nI'm done ????????
Dorralleus didn’t plug holes
FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST...now that I have your attention, I think it's time for you all to replace this game with the forest. I feel like you all can have a good series out of this. My kids and I had a great laugh through out this episode.
How the hell did the zombies get stuck
My dad just passed away yesterday morning. Not looking for likes or sympathy just wanted to say thank you neebs gaming for making this less hard on me.. Hug your loved ones and tell them how much you love them.
hey neebs try out fortnight save the world it has zombies too (:ps:love the channel
Omg this was the best series I have ever watched on youtube. Been here since the first episode and was sooo excited for every new one. When I saw your 7 days to die videos in my sub box, it was always the first video I clicked. Excellent series and I hope to see season two in the future.??????????\n\n                                         -Ethan
Love it, you guys help fight depression! Thank you!
Minecraft holes or Doraleous Death Holes... Simon just can't resist um.
such a good intro. Very creative and fun
You couldn't find a better way to end this season! Thanks Dora, you are responsible for the best episode ever! \n\n\n\nNow we just wait for that update, right? :D
I love how Dora is laughing the whole time....
Oh god I'm so freaking sad that this is over!!!! :( :( This is my favourite series by far and i love them all so that's saying something. Hopefully you guys will start again with Alpha 17 since there's so much more to come with that release. Love you guys, Jocelyn (aka iwuuvyew) p.s. Ada, you have outdone yourself my friend. Absolutely amazing job!!!
Dora completely ignored the hole leading straight into the bunker??
Great final episode fellas
Championship episode! You know you succeeded when Neebs has to break character. Epic series, epic team. I wonder if there is a death tracker to see how many ways Simon died. Best way to start the day. Hugs and kisses from Corpus Christi.
Now you guys have finished 7 Days to Die will you be starting a fallout 76 series ?
The bunker seemed like a good idea on paper Dora
Loved this series so much, thanks to all involved.  Hope to see you back when they eventually update the game.
(Insert ‘The???? Office’ Reference Here ??) Zah Best!! -Hei-De
FFS Doralingus! I wanna see what this horde would be like without those holes above the safe room!
Thanks for the memories!
Doraleous should be punished for causing the most deaths in the series
No matter what happens in the future, there will never a fuck up like this colossal mess.. absolute loved it, this would have killed cooter if he hadn’t already died, and yes we know it’s a different game
this was the best horde night ever. i was laughing so hard. \n\nand then i realized\n\nTHIS IS THE END OF 7 DAYS???? this series was a masterpiece
Sigh... you know. Journey’s End should be spelled with an apostrophe. I know, I know. But the End belongs to the Journey, right? Just cause we are drowning in Russian collusion, doesn’t mean we should spell like em. Just sayin, later fellas. I really enjoyed the series.
If i could only ask for two things in this life, it would be more Neebs seven days to die, and more Doraleous and associates.
The only thing to make this episode better would be if the bunker was a trap the whole time and it was blown making it the final tomb.
Season 2? ??
Spectacular, this failure satiates me.
can someone explain the copy and paste at the end?
You guys have to let doraleus prep for hord night everytime this was definitely the most entertaining one yet
this palce aint haunted this place is cursed
Silly fuckers
More seven days to die????
The 1812 Overture playing at the end was massively epic! I saw Doraleous Death Hole on the Family Values tour in '98. Please bring a new season on this series if A17 ever releases in our lifetime. (I want an Adahop key on my computer now)
Next time have a plan 2.\nYes, I'm using numbers instead of letters so I don't ran out of plans.
Just for future reference you guys got upset over the beakers in the supply drop, but beakers actually sell for a lot of tokens at traders
F
Oh the carnage, an epic end to an epic series
This may have been the third time I've watched this video. Thankyou
Best hoard night ever
I'm so fucking sad right now. Loved this series. Hope updates makes it come back better.
One of the best youtube series of all time
After weeks of Dora preparing for hoard night all by himself while the others piss fart around doing sweet fuck all episode after episode, the second it goes wrong you all blame Dora? Fuck you guys. Dora should have left them all to fend for themselves on the surface. Love you Dora, you sexy sexy man!
Is that metal thick at the end? Hopefully the fun pimps hear it and sneak you guys into alpha 17! Great episode, so funny I spat out my Weetabix
I'll save y'all the trouble of watching with 3 words... Failed death montage
For all this y'all should've just made a big ass pitfall
Please Check out Osiris: New Dawn for possible new content!
...really had high hopes for this
A great way to end a great series well done guy's well done
Nooo! This series was gold. Gold I tell you!
Will you guys do a PvP game just for fun?
- German encirclement and subsequent occupation of the Maginot Line - 1940 colorized
I loved it I just kept hearing Benny hill chase music in my head
LMFAO!! Called it XD\n\nWell done guys :D I dunno what's funnier.. the fact that Dora fucked you all or the fact he laughed the entire time XD
T-shirt concept,  “Simon died again”, “did Simon die?” , Or “ Simon’s dead”
BRAVO Gentlemen...……….BRAVO !!
I would of liked to see Simon organise a horde night setting it up how he wanted it. but great series, amazing ending. Can't wait to see the next one you bring out! keep it up :)
All good things come to an end.
338 hours? them are rookie numbers boys
Now I really can’t wait for alpha 17 to drop
I've been being patient this whole time with the devs getting A17 out, but if my favorites series from you all hinges on it then my patience is suddenly out the window.
I loved it
I'm going to miss this series!
you know they'll never return to a game when they say they'll probably return to it some day... but damn what an awesome run this series had, especially for a game that is mediocre at best
I ain't even sad about the end of this series because that just means we may be getting a new series, and that's always good. Can't wait to see what it could be.
Ok fella that was amazing. Thanks for the wonderful series and props to ada for the perfection that is his editing!!
damn what a way to end the series! Whether or not you guys make another one is up to you, but this was fantastic and I certainly hope you do! Good luck my boys
When I said best base yet ....i was mistaken. It just looked good..and could have been good... apologies.
I love how Doraleous had zero concern for that hole while he was building this bunker.
Actually kind of glad the bunker failed as drastically as it did, in truth it made for a better end to the series than seeing the guys just beast through another horde night.\n\nOutstanding series from beginning to end, can’t wait to see what you guys come up with next. Would love to see this game revisited in some form down the line
Dear god, I was waiting for the score at the end and instead noticed that you said something like you were gonna stop making 7days to die videos. Please put this on commenting on comments and answer what you guys really mean. Is the series on a halt?
Play Call of Duty BO4. Zombies and Blackout. Will be great/funny videos!
Best. Video. Ever! Can’t wait to see what y’all do in alpha 17.
Even better than your usual awesomeness. Looking forward to when you return to this game, and what you plan to play next. Maybe Fallout 76?\n\nAnd Adahop for president.
Please play dont starve together next
Damnit, Anthonyhop.
Anyone else notice the date of the break in didn't match with the date the last time 7dtd was played? Also, I'm so sad you won't continue the series. I loved the amount of laughter it brought and you guys made it such a show. You guys are awesome and Simon is also funny ????
Get rid of the shitty cookie cutter music.
The 1812 was nice touch guys.
One of the best series to watch, sad that it had to end. Hopefully you guy play Alpha 17 when it come out.
Please don't stop making 7 Days To Die videos!!!!!
So did Doraleous finally break and kill everyone? Was that his plan all along?
What's next for Friday's? Coc?
Best season finale ever..... BRAVO Neebs gaming and Adahop!!!\n\nAnd BRAVO Anthony duck whatever..
Don’t u guys dare end this series. Il let u have a break till alpha 17 and that’s it go to random gen or something
I work late shifts every other week. That means that im alone at the kitchen table with no one to talk to. But watching this 7D2D series has kept my mood up and given me comfort after a days hard grind at the saltmines.\nSo thanx NEEB´s Gaming Crew and everybody who goes into making this possible for ME to watch. \nBig hugs from Sweden. You have given a worn soul some light to warm itself by. Keep it up. :)
What editing software do you guys use? Love what you guys do!
It was a great season
I am so sad this is the end ??????
The forest

Thus is the best finally
That song was awesome!
I LOVE IT, but one thing NEVER EVER LET DORALEOUS ever build you base please??, and this mark (hopefully??) end the 7 days to die series, and the start of season 2 of it or the start of minecraft survival again, or ( which is what I want) the start of emperion galactic survival ( I'm hoping its emperion galactic survival, because that would be SO COOL just saying)???????????????????????? #winnerwinnerchickendrumstickwinner
Your video titles have been dark lately, you all better not be breaking up the band or some dumb shit like that. We all love the videos way to much.
That was painful.
The setup wasn't bad and that covered hole wasn't really the problem. You need to plan how to lead them to you. Zombies will take the easiest route to you and will path through doorways even when closed. \nIf you lock yourself in a room without doors or climb to a spot they can't reach, which looks to be the case here, they will path straight through terrain to you.\nAlso, need an exit plan if they breach..
Will there be more next week
I love your taste in music lol
This was a funny way to end it but I can’t help but feel sad that it’s over I’ve been watching this series since day 1!!!!
Nooooooo!!\nIts the end????\nMake season 2 please?
Well done boys! Amazing ending to a great series.
The only thing to make this better is if there was a fail safe of just blowing the entire room up
I retract last weeks comment that Dora should be president
Thick44 can sing I like that song at the end
Thank god this show is ending. The only episodes worth watching were the hoard nights.
You Sank my Battle Hole
21:36\n\nTrying to use the communication wheel in ARK like...
OMG can stop laughing
Noooo! Please don't end the series Neebs Gaming. 7 Days To Die is my all time flavored series by you guys. it is awesome. You guys are awesome. Anyways keep up the stellar work guys, especially you Appsro.      \n\nP.S.\nWhy the fuck does Neebs build a Fucking barn in every video game.
I'm so happy that I waited all day to watch this, a rough day of 16hrs of work finished off with laughing out loud with my cat at Simon blender hopping lol I think my neighbors think I'm crazy now. You guys are so fucking cool!!!!
Why are you stopping!?
That was so craptacular I was laughing so hard I cried.
Hi neebs gaming
That was glorious
All that work Doraleous did couldn’t have been more anticlimactic.
Eh pretty great episode despite adashit rigging the game. Great job as always 5 of you guys are hilarious.
The fortress was a lie all along!
“I’m in a fist fight with a cheerleader”\nQuote of the day neebs my good man.
Man, I really love y'all NOOBS!
Start a new series - Commenting on Public
Your thermostat is broken
I know this is likely not even gonna be featured on next commenting on comments, but why is this series ending? By far my favourite series by you guys.\n\n(I've seen several seasoned youtubers do playthroughs of late game horde nights and Doraleous' idea was the general strategy of all of them. I was puzzled how this one was failing from all the rest, about a minute later I got my answer. Best horde night ever!)
Holy fuck balls best horde yet
Is that why y'all wanted to travel to journeys end? Well gta say i loved the series and i'm looking forward for somerhing new.
do you guys ever play with your fans?
Bravo gentlemen. Bravo. \"Slow clap\"
Quote of the vid: \"Doraleous' death hole\" - gold!
Great series, gutted to see it finished but totally understand the limitations of 7dtd. I look forward to seeing what you fill the slot with. I understand you just did a first and last day in Aberration but with Extinctions delay it's never a better time to give Aberration a go.
Favorite episode by far
Frikcen spazing out coz the outro so dang amazing
Who has control of the thermostat in your office? I’m sure you guys argue about the temperature all the time.
Best/worst/funniest 7 dtd episode EVER!??????
Died more than every other episode combined
Fantastic editing, great bunker, I'm sorry we didn't get to see it work quite as intended. Well done, everyone.
I'm genuinely sad, please come back to it, my Fridays will never be the same :(
Holy poop you guys ended that right on the expiration date and I’m not disappointed whatsoever
This was the funniest 7 days video I've seen. Doraleous you really out did yourself.
The most spectacular fail ever ??????. Not only did they try to attract zombies with burning barrel that doesn’t increase the heat map, they also trusted Dora’s “plan”. Simon probably died in this horde night as much as in the rest of the series ??. Now comes the hard part. Waiting 3 months for the A17 season ??
Zombies were using hacks. Knew exactly where to dig and drop.
I'm going to miss this, This was my favourite series
I fucking piss my pants so hard I need a sponsorship from OxiClean. Funniest shit ever
COOTER
epic
Scrap outlasts 7 days? Really?  Y'all can do a random gen map if you need something new.
i really loved this whole series. great job all round!
I hope this isnt the end of the series. I play myself on xbox and everytime I watch you guy, I play mine at the same time on another tv beside my gaming screen. You guys are hilarious and I get into every episode yall do like an actual tv show. Hopefully this isnt the end......
epic fail
No wtf!!! This was my favorite series
2:25 i could kill em. \n\nHaha love it when dora does that
Why did he assault the thermostat like that?
This better not be the last ep because I will be so so so very hurt
I hope you guys WILL continue this series once the alpha 17 or beta or whatever, it will have new content for you guys to make out with it.
Hey remember in The Matrix 3 when all the machines were coming in through the ceiling at Xion? Yeah this was nothing like that.
This is the best
Hell of a finale.
fantastic series. i thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to every friday nights adventure. thx guys
Haven't laughed this hard in quite sometime guys, really lifted my spirits today and I think I peed a little yeesh
Don't  Be cunts
Thanks for always entertaining us. Just a quick question. Did y'all know that there is a character in the new assassins creed game named testicles (or however you spell it) like from Doraleus and associates? I was just curious if it was a shout out to y'all in the game. Thanks again for all that you do.
perfect base with the perfect back door what a piece of shit hahahahaha love u Dora!
So is the next season is when you guys start playing Alpha 17 comes out?
Holy shit, that was amazingly ridiculous! Please don’t take too long of a break, always need Neebs Gaming’s 7Days to die. Return for Alpha 17?
oh man it seems like we just started
Dorealous is the type of guy who 3 problems and then only overly solve 1 leading to his fate
I've been following the series since it began last year! Man, while I'll certainly miss the series, I have to say this was the best way the series could end! Just a real Murphy's Law of a night. I hope one day y'all return to the game!
hopefully we can get more ark going, yall still need to beat island boss
Its like a time when you beat a very good camping to a game then it starts rolling through the credits and a good song starts to play
Nooooooo no more 7 days ????
it's what happens when you half ass a construction
This must have been a nightmare to edit. Best 7d2d ever, great job guys! appsro for PONG!
best episode ever guys:) Doraleous should have had the who ceiling covered in blocks that is why it failed lol
What's that song called
Can't wait for season 2 with Alpha 17 and Random World Gen.
Simon Score 0\nDora               2\nNeebs            2\nApp                8\nThick             10\n\nNeebsGaming  100\nKeep up the good work!\n\nI admit though i thought this was going to work great.  Sucks put so much time and effort into and it didnt go right still was fun to watch.
I never really liked this series but now that it’s done I think I might miss it.
Why why whyyyyyyy nooo 7 days it was the best part of my video week??????????????????
Bring back raft
What a hell of a year! Thank you guys so much for this amazing series. I love how much passion and character you guys put into your shows, and for me, 7dtd has been one of the best (if not the best) shows that you guys have ever produced. Thank you gentlemen for the memories, and the fun for my Friday evenings!
Thanks for this!
Adahop, this was your masterpiece. Gentlemen this series has been a joy since day one. I will miss it.
This was great ??. I’m Hoping the next new series will be red dead 2 online. Or Minecraft I miss those days.
That was great!
This videos is just a montage of all you dying ??
horde night was an inside job
Neebs and team totally got Doraleoused. This is where he comes up with a incredibly elaborate half baked idea that ultimately fails horribly. Just like in his scrap mechanic vids. Seriously best episode though guys. My girlfriend and I couldn't stop laughing.
You tube is currently sucking the joy out of my already sad soul. Had a huge smile 15 seconds in...then that buffering swirling Bitch pops up and I want to pull my pubes out with my teeth? Can I get my one smile in for the day thanks YT.
I won't suck up to you and beg for a second season. We need a break, and all good things need to come to an end. But if you cancel it... you're dead to me.
Sooooo... what's worse? Blindly charging into things a fucking everyone over (Thicked) or preparing for something but leaving a Death Star style flaw in your design (Doraleous'd/Dored)???
Simon you're like the 1 single herpe in the group. You've got a good looking group of players doing well and then the herpe gets spotted by a potential suitor and embarrasses everyone involved. Excellent video guys! Including the herpe. ????????????
Lesson learned. Never trust Dora to design anything.
I wonder what theyll be doing next. Such a good series.
I haven't laughed this much in a long time.. thank you guys.
I had such high hopes for this episode but...... DORA FUCKED IT UP!!!!!  GOD DAMNIT.  I love you guys thanks for the videos,  fuck off dora.
Woah... my dudes, I already commented but I just had to come back and watch this episode again. Holy shit what a finale, by the time Neebs was fist punching that cheerleader at the end.. I just can't even believe it, that was a straight up masterpiece. I really hope you guys come back to 7 days after the update and when you find time again. That was a golden episode, and a fantastic series. Neebs Gaming 4 Life !
The Wife and I have not laughed so hard at your stuff in a long time. We saw this happening as soon as the reveal and its the best way to end the series.
This has been, by far, my favorite series. I hope Season Finale doesn't become Series Finale. \n\nJust think...  What will this game be like once they finally get to full release version. :)
My wife just gave birth to our second son two days ago. We both just came home from the hospital around midnight tonight on very little sleep. Obviously  she needed rest more so I volunteered to watch him while she slept first.  Currently holding him in my arm while writing this. Shhhh, he's sleeping.\n\nThanks Neebs Gaming for being with me in this memory and helping me stay awake.
A beautiful end.
Helluva finale.  Gonna miss this series.  Empyrion, maybe?
Worst vacation evar
No more 7d2d???? Noooooooo life itself is cancelled!
This was the best 7 days to die episode ever, it made me laugh so much.love this series  I’m going to miss it . keep creating great videos
Loved it... Great job\nSoundtrack plz.\\m/
I love you guys but how in the hell did you get this far in the game and still need to search for med packs. I guess it's why we all love you so much.
The journey has come to the enemy
Complete blood bath. I think doralios maybe should of dug deeper? I heared of someone playing this game that built nice base, then one hored night the zombies collapsed the whole base from underneath.
I cant believe thats it????
We're gonna die here\nIn Doraleous' death hole\nAll hell lets loose as the ceiling falls in on them along with piles of zombies.\nDoraeous giggling in the corner like a LIL BITCH.\nFUCK YOU DORALEOUS\n\nMeanwhile Simon dying (more than the others) to the sound of music as the FPS hits apocalypse levels.\n\nA truly spectacular end to a great series. Love y'all. Was the tampering Ada's doing?
Awesome series!!!!!!
What’s the next series
ALL OF UR STUFF IS ENDING WTFF , FIRST THE OTHER ARK MAPS, SUBNITICA WHYY
Oh, Doraleous... keep being you, man.. even if it means spending too many hours building what inevitably would become a death trap. A massive, massive death trap. What a great episode haha.
\"I bet you there's paper in him\"; Simon, 2018, 7 Days to Die: Journeys End
I'll never forget that Appsro uses his clipped finger nails for toothpicks.
Wait season or series
wow. the edits the song choice. best episode yet. ps pretty sure you guys would have been fine except Simon was taking away the defenses lol
You built our tomb lol
What an ending, and what a series. Can’t wait to see you guys return to this someday. Great series!! Excited for what the future holds!
They will probably come back when alpha 17 is out
Don’t think I’ve ever laughed as much as I have in this series.  Maybe Neebsylvania, I’ve watched that one at least 10 times thru, laugh every time Simon falls in a hole still.
Doraleous.... Omg.... Dude!!! That fucking bunker man, I had such high hopes that it was going to be the BEST HORDE BUILD EVER IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR HISTORY OF PLAYING THIS GAME. EVER. I'm sorry it fell apart so quickly, but omg what a hell of an ending. Love you guys and will miss this series so much
A great end to a great series. Now that you’re done with 7 Days to Die will you be putting AdaHop away in storage?
Fantastic show guys!
You know what this means guys... SUBNAUTICA IS COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow just got to say the whole episode was amazing from open song to the tears of laughter. Derelious ur bunker was a horrified failure but your vision was in lack of stability. Neebs crew do any of you have xbox? GT Shadowflyer11 I got a bunker even needs would love with 300 farm plots.
best... cluster..... fuck.... ever! 10/10 even with a plan you somehow fail and make one of the best videos ever. i laughed so hard at the dead screams i scared my cats haha good job guys
If it hasn't been discussed already I would like to bring up the idea of Red Dead Redemption 2 Rage Deputy.
Doraleus surely did do a good job and I know it’s scripted...u guys “if serious” wouldn’t of built below the holes in the ground but none the less I loved this and I want more 7 days
The editing was on fleek.
I love the #breadstrong song at the end....
Hands down. Nothing else but all I can say right now is I freakin loved it.
So whats next? Im excited
This makes me so sad.
Please don’t let this be the end!!!
So... Doraleous for president?
rip to the best youtube show ever
You guys should play this again but use mods
Awesome you broke 1mill on my birthday!!!!!
As usual, another amazing Neebs Gaming series, keep doing what you're doing because it's great!
love this series guy please bring it back around after awhile
Best vid ever!! Omg almost pisted my self.
Haha...just.. hahaha...this was great! ????
This is officially your best Fubar compilation
I knew they wouldn't path right so i wondered how you guys were going to twist it
Damn this was awesome.  and that bunker looked sick, doralious is some kind of mastermind... evil or not (this is still a deathtrap). looking forward to whatever your doing next!
Y’all never fail to make me laugh.
That was epic, awesome video!
I died laughing the whole time!  Hope you guys come back to it or do an equally as awesome series in it's place.
i totally hope you guys revisit 7 days to die after the patch 17 comes out
Hey neebsgaming I luv all you guys your are my favorite you tubers been watching sins battlefield friends seson 1 you guys are amazing and the best youtubers you guys should have like 100 million subscribers..... Any who happy Halloween and great job with the series I would luv a heart from you guys and maybe even a reply comment from all of you wish I could meet you guys in person but I'll never have that kind of $$$$ so a heart and a comment will do????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????.      To Appsro ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? from you #1 fan
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!
That was fucking spectacular. Kudos to all of you crazy mofos
AWESOME SONG DURING END CREDITS!!!
Can we just hold one candle light vigil and call Simon good :D
The end of 7 days to die for neebsgaming for a while ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
wow . really .
Best hord night ever. Ty for making these amazing videos. Greatest channel in all of youtube.
What are you going to post on Fridays now. I always look forward to a 7 days episode on Fridays.
I just hear dora laughing his ass off and having the time of his life. Price less
Bottom line, epic season finale! Thank you guys!
Man that was such a good episode.
I loved this series so much it became my favorite, other than ark. It only seems like yesterday you guys started it, But everything has a end and, I can't wait for whatever new game you guys are planning for a series next. NEEBS GAMING IS #1 \nohhh yeaaa, I noticed the channel is getting pretty close to 2million subs. We are still coming for you Pumkinpie!
Simon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died
simon's deaths always brings me joy lmao!! best episode yet!!!
What does this meeeeaaann!? I'm scared!!
By far the most successful ford night
Conan? On Fridays? Plz? Btw loved every episode such a fantastic series
Sitting at work on my break in my truck  And  Laughing my butt off as people walk by and wondering what the hell as I scream no Simon    Easily the best 7 days to die video I have ever seen
Oh nelly. When will you learn that earth can be torn through easier than metal.
this was so bad in the best way! love it!!
Lol i love the zombie kill count. Neebs and dora are neck and neck. Appsro does his thing and plays out safe when he can. Simon is,well, he's Simon. Hes not about skill, but a nessessary addition. Without Simon, neebs gaming wouldn't be the same.\nAs for thick, he's the go too man. Wtg.\nOne question, who's seepyg?
This was the best
A beautiful disaster. Cheers for a good series. It was nice to see both human and zombie come together in the end and live without borders, in the most difficult environment one could imagine, sharing the same devices of death and pools of gore, in complete chaos and disharmony, like Europe. Just Kidding, or am I? I hope to see someday once more, man and zombie share a mortal dance in a dungeon of death, that only the mind of an isolated Dora could craft. Cheers.
Pls play dyinglight pls like if you agree
Any excuse to use the 1812 Overture is great, and this was a grand display.  Can't wait for you guys to return to it.\n\nI suppose this could be a Commenting on Comments question: Do you guys plan on replacing 7 Days to Die with something else for Fridays?  I know you've mentioned Conan Exiles a few times and its definitely something I'd like to see you give a proper go.
So sad this series is ending! I loved every episode! Hope you come back to it eventually, as it was such a great laugh! Keep on keeping on guys!
Adahop, thank you for all your awesome work on this series! Hope you and the crew are back at it very soon.
If I know anything from these guys... Their ideas NEVER work the way they want. Who else saw that coming from a mile away?
Ending just in time to do a red dead redemption 2 series. Smart move boys. Lots can be done there. Really looking forward to you guys getting your hands on that. Rage sheriff maybe? Loved it guys. You kept this game alive long after I got bored waiting for A17 on console. Can't wait to see what's next. Thanks guys
Go get the drop simon..see you in hell.
MORE 7 DAYS!!!!!!
Great video adahop!!! And Thick’s song at the end was so good!!!
Addy. I must commend you. You have brought a fresh perspective to Neebsgaming that they were looking for. Look at what you did with Subnautica when it returned. Look at CSN. Where would that channel be w/o you? You are the no-neck face that brought this channel to 1.7+mill. Great job. Love your face and btw Scrap has been renewed with you at the helm.
Thick must have chosen the music, reminda me of avengers sevenfold. Good stuff! Ps. Neebs you said you would do an aberration series
Awesome video, and I'll definitely miss this series ;-;
Just like in Dwarf Fortress, \"Losing is Fun!\"
Adahop, that was some diabolical shenanigans. Doraleous, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Simon, watch out for the mines.
Thanks so much for this season.  Please times 5000 do alpha 17.
My grandma walks in the room and asks where’s all that noise is coming from I just told her I was watching porn because it was easier then to acutely explain what the fuck I was watching at the middle of the night ??
About to watch this for the second time today. Once was not enough to take it all in. Is this the last ever episode of 7 Days To Die or are yous just taking a break for a bit?(Edit: I watched to the very end this time, I found the answer to my question) Peace and prosperity guys
ok that was great, not surprise it didn't work. there is not something right about someone that talks to themselves with a gun pointed at there friends .... lol
Man, this is like a Kenny death of constant proportions. I needed a good laugh after the week I had lol.
C'mon man, if you're going to stop one of the best series you have, get all the videos to show up in the playlists. There's a bunch missing.
Hahahahahahaha poor simon
great episode as always, but in particular this intro ... loved it, good job guys :)
I never comment but i have to say that song at the end absolutely rules. And simon you just suck man... sorry
Simons score shouldn’t be a 1 it should be a 10 just like Dora and the rest of you guys , thank you so very much for making a fantastic episode and making me look stupid in front of my already disappointed father as I screamed in laughter and yelled at my phone  is so awesome
Well I guess it's back to watching Megazord.
I have never spent 24 minutes giggle snorting at a video until today. What an amazing setup and  even if it was a failure it still was fantastic to watch
Do the prison and make simon do all the fortifications it does not take much its almost all concrete
Haha death Trapped because of that hole ??
Much preparation..much death.
Too fucking good. Lol!
I shouldn’t have watched this while eating dinner. I think I inhaled a metric ton of rice as I gasped for air while laughing hysterically. Worth it. Thank you for a great series!
I laughed so hard I think I peed a little
what a beautifully edited shit show
21:37 fucking killed me ????
I loved this series
No please play more
sees the rumble that was shown falling \"My god...  they evolved...\"
Duck duck goose
So long 7 Days, twas funny while it lasted ????
Love you guys so much! Can't wait to see the next series!
Once again Simon is a douche
Guys, I don’t know how to explain how much your videos mean to me and my mental health. You guys can cheer me up no matter what mood I’m in and it’s something really special. Please for the love of god don’t finish this series, we all love it, clearly! I’ve never met you but you feel like good friends, that’s mental when you think about it. I may of had a few beverages, but I mean every word.
Let’s see what Simon can do
That was great. Bravo neebs cast bravo
i knew dora's base design was gonna fail........but damn..........this exceeded my expectations in so many ways. best episode yet.....cant wait for alpha 17
That was epic, great producing as well
It the end of the season at journeys end
Sweet chocolatey Jesus that was the most glorious failure I have ever witnessed! Friggin LOVE THIS CHANNEL! KEEP IT UP GUYS!
Gods this was glorious.  I've loved the whole series, but this was epic.  You guys are awesome, Congrats on the button there.  Me and my guys love your vids and look forward to more. (of any game not just 7dtd).  <3
Shall now be referred to as The Great Collapse
What does August 19th represent?
Play more beamng drive
Why did you end it here at least let Simon host a hord night guys
Holy fuckin shit. I laughed my ass off Simon I love your balls to the wall approach to everything especially when it gets you killed, Dolorion hell fuckin yeah what a build in what will now forever be known as the glory hole
Fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've been looking forward to this!!! I am only :49 into the viedo. Y'all take care it's time to watch.
I am going to Miss this series and one thing you guy forgot to put a way your Spider-Man game because in August spider Man didn't came out till September
Non stop ACTION! ! ! Awe man! !...?????? Great job guys....really enjoyed this series ??????????????????
Well that backfired.
I have loved this series since you started making it and have been watching every episode the day it comes out. Thank you so much for the entertainment. If you ever get back to creating 7 days again try the pitfall trap build.
Masterpiece
I'm definitely gonna miss this series but hopefully you guys will bring it back later. That was the best one, great work you guys
Guys that was the best video of neebs gaming ever .??????????
Congrats guys, well done on another great episode and an amazing series! Is the the end, or will you go to a new map now?
Best worst episode ever, or is to the worst best ever. Whatever fucking hilarious!
This was the greatest use of the War of 1812 Overture I've ever witnessed
Why does it have to end!!!!??!
so will the series continue?
Next challenge  build base on top of metal bridge #thickchallenge
All the props I gave Dora last episode, ya I've got to take it all back. How did you not fill those holes in. A bit disappointed in that, all that planning gone to waste
I see you guys are signed up for the 7 days to die A17 stream event, you gonna be streaming that? playing on 17????
A wonderful end to a wonderful series hope it comes back
Really hope that there more of this in the future. You guys crack me up!
What's next gents.? Hope its something as fun as 7Dd was world peace! An much love! From trigrhap gaming!
as as suggestion if you ever do another horde night, dig a continuous long tunnel lined with torches deep inside of a mountain lined with all kinds of obstacles for the horde to try and reach you.
Awesome work guys what's your plans from here?
This was awesome, wish you could do another horde with Simon doing the defenses. At the bottom of the map kind of to the left is a prison that would be perfect for him to build up. Thank you guys for making many laughs for me and your fans. Since I started watching your videos, my days have been more happier to say the least. I have also been going back to watch all of your videos from the past. Thanks again for making my days better!!!
Would love to see entire series death count for everyone if available.
What a glorious end for a glorious series
Hahah! 19:10 thick’s shock was so sincere??
Hope season 2 of neebsyvania is coming
I predicted this would happen. I thought about saying something but decided it would be funnier if I didnt. I was not disappointed.
Best horde night ever...
Don't let this be the end. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Truly an epic ending, no other channel can claim to produce as high quality gaming videos as you all kisses all round
End of an amazing Adventure
You guys should try MODDED 7DTD.
It's over, so what will replace it? Honestly though this is better than any TV series and film. This has been the best thing, and each episode and brought me so much joy, thank you Neebs crew xox
That’s the best ending anyone could have done for this series.  SOOOO FUNNY
Pew - pew pew  LMAO ?? ????
always wanted to watch a neebs gaming SAW movie ??
Welp, that went pretty much exactly the way I expected it to. I think you guys said it best, it was a fantastic, fantastic failure.
Whats going to replace this series then my dudes???
That was just fantastically entertaining.
Simon's death noises are always the best part of the show.
Dora, thank you. I needed that good of a laugh after this week.
Great way to end a series. Although I know you will probably return in 2020(I know you guys I have watched every series ,I know how lazy you are).
VRV, enough said.
That intro music is so Nightmare Before Christmas -ish
I can't imagine how frustrating that night must have been to get through but damn was it funny to watch. I have so many tears from laughing so hard. ????????????
That was the most hilarious and epically  disastrous horde night I've ever seen. Thank you guys for such a great series. Spot on editing in this one Adahop.  I'm sad to see this end, but hopefully after A17 goes stable you guys will do a season 2 for 7DTD. Loved it and thanks guys.
This is basically my rust experience so far
Is this the last episode ever?
That was fucking epic...
that credit music is actually kinda good
so will you guys be back in alpha 17?
Fantastic episode!
FFS Doraleous I wanted to believe in you soooo bad. But if it has to end like this at least it ended in a BIG WAY.
You guys are awesome. I loved the game only from watching you play it. I really wish that I get to meet you guys just to tell you how funny you are. ??
I'm so sad. Why did it end? Next base, simon is in charge? Each person has their own \"death trap\" at least. Like each person has their own location for a horde
I'm seriously gonna miss this series
Best episode ever! Spectacular disaster indeed.
\"Downfall\" haha
i laughed so hard i started choking
Is this the end? Either way this is my favourite series on the neebs gaming channel.
wow ada has a special A key and wow what build up to a hopeful horde night to 1 big disappointment
I dont even know how you guys do it. you take something and make it a million times more badass. Always hilarious film gold.
When I saw the thumbnail it said \"season finale\" and I thought instead that it said \"series finale\"and I almost died inside thinking this was the end.
Soooo, why exactly did anyone think this was going to work? DORALEOUS BUILT IT!
Holy fuck,I love you guys so much. I can’t wait for a possible next season and I can’t describe how much I loved this one. Too sad to have it come to an end. But what an ending it was.
this is gold, pure gold i love it especially the montage of deaths, then neebs when he says \"im in a fist fight with a cheerleader\" cracked me up
I can't like this video enough. OMG guys well done that was hilarious AND epic!!!  The playing of the 1812 Overture was genius, i laughed my ass off.  Bravo!
I have loved the series so much I just hope you go back to it or maybe start fallout 76
Nice ending, sad day... This is my favorite next to Ark.
Glad this series ended on such a high note.  Would like to see an occasional revisit just for a big horde night defense if someone had a creative base idea, even if it was built in creative mode to start and everyone was given some gear and levels.   These horde nights were what I looked forward to the most in this series.  The chaos and excitement really brought out your dynamics like back in the neebsylvania days.   Will miss it, but looking forward to whats next
We shall salute this great ep
Alpha 17 let's go!
It’s sad to see the series end
Holy shit. What a cluster fuck that was. Loved every minute of it.
Just want to say. Great job Doralius
I hope you guys have some great stuff planned!... I loved the weekend line up and now this!. I trust you guys (1st ever sub was to you guys). And more pod casts as I drive alot at work and you guys make a hour feel like 2. Thanks. ARE YOU A MAN
Absolutely, hands down the best series of deaths I have ever seen, and I am glad I got to see it on the one and only NEEBS GANING!!!!
Wait is this the end of the 7 days serious
Ya'll better be back for version 17 of the game! :)
At least it ended the way it should have. With you all getting what you deserve.
Best ending ever, even though Adahop uped it all, and you guys died time and time again. And in my own personal opinion, I think Neeb's lighthouse and Dora's original bunker would have faired better. Can't wait for Appsro with RDR2, I know he can't either. Love you guys, and kisses for everyone ??
this video made my night lol  best part is watching Doraleous  watch and laugh ... man i am 32 yrs old and i love watching your video  hands down i  really hope for a season 2 of 7 days to die ... random gen map ... ?
Thank you for bringing us this series, it was so entertaining, I can’t wait to see what you’ll be working on next and start a new series with you guys
Holy crap, I lost it when they started falling in! The I instantly thought to myself about Simon dying a lot. Lmao he never fails to deliver! Hate to see the series go though it’s one of my favorite, but with the big update coming it’s a wise decision. Play some Conan Exiles dam it !!
What a way to go out, not in a bang or an explosion but with several bangs leading to a boom that collapses the whole ceiling. Well done!!
Anybody else recognize the music from the scorched earth boss battle?
I love this series. You have gone from being noob's scared out of your wits in the police station, to building your own houses, and it all ends like this. I've gotta say this whole thing has taken many turns. Some for the worst... Looking at you Doraleous... Fantastic, all of you get a cookie in my book
ROFL this episode was one of the best, if not the best one.
Looking forward to Red Dead hijinks now this is over for now.
I will never tire of the \"Simon death noise\"  I smile every time he makes that sound  and it happens a lot so I'm pretty happy
I’m going to miss this series it was one of my favorite but now apsro can do subNautica sub zero
I love 7 Days to Die and I love the videos you guys make I hope one day when Alpha 17 comes out that you guys will return to this series refreshed and eager for new challenges but it's been a fun ride and I've enjoyed every episode and I just want to thank each and everyone of you!
Now MINECRAFT AGAIN! :D :D
Simply.Fucking.Amazing. \nWell done Ada! \n\nOh and thanks for showing us how do use your maps. Been trying to figure that out since the Valley House.
This is the greatest 7 days to die video. Ever. \n\nBest horde night. Ever. \n\nThank you Dora for providing me with hours of entertainment today while I’m nursing a major hangover from the night before. \n\nYou guys are amazing. \n\n#worldpeace #doraforpresident
Ps love your cute butts all equally
Another fan-f**king-tastic 7 days video. Love how you guys just gave Neebs a silent stare over his comment \"Apprso's bringing the heat. Would you guys ever get your  partners in as guests to narrate over a ark video like it was a wildlife doco?
This episode has made me laugh harder than I ever have in a very long time!
so sad to see it end it was an amazing series
The fact that the APSSRO crew is exactly like me and my friends scares me and I said apssro crew to see if it would piss off neebs
Nooooooo. Is this the final of the season or the series?
I’ve watched this series from the start and loved every minute of it! Sad to see it go but looking forward to more adventures!!!
This was fucking epic
Gotta love Simon... at least he's persistent... LOL  GOTTA GET MY STUFF!!!
So.... what's next?
That was without a doubt the best episode of 7 days yet!
“Simon, I just saved you.” “Why?” LOL
This was the best thing I have ever watched
BEST SERIES ENDING EVER!!!
Por favor regresar a esta serie! Please return to this series!
Gloriously FUBAR... XD
What a coup de grace! I'm sad to see the series ending (for now), but this was a special one. lol Will we see another poll for the next series?
IMO better than The Walking Dead. Thnx Guys!
Why are you guys ending the series?
The best ending ever made ???
A blooper: when Dora blew the hole, it sent all the barrels up in the sky, but next scene it's all on the ground like nothing happened.
I wanted this to work for you guys! I wanted yall to kick ass for 24 min and walk out like badasses! Instead I got the most entertaining and funniest YouTube video I have seen in a very long time. I enjoyed this immensely! You guys are good at what you do, and most importantly good peoples. P.S. remember this quote. “The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.” - Phil Jackson
Probably the best and funniest episode by far! I had a shitty day at work so I decided to order chinese food, drink some beer and watch Neebs Gaming :D I love you guys, pretty sure I want Neebs to carry my baby.
if this series is ending which game are yall moving to next?  not sure how many people might had suggested this but yall might get a kick out of \"Dark and light\", similar to ARK but more magical instead of tech.
Hey can we just have like 1 more episode of a set up for hoard night made by Simon. I would love to see that mess lol
Love the 7days to die Videos. Definitely I loved this one. Great job to all at Neebs Gaming. Thanks so much. ?? I just want to say I loved the first part of the video.
Oh dorabolus...
This is probably the worst horde night ever. (thanks doraleous) ??
1812 overture, nice choice
Y is it ending, now I don't have something to watch on Friday
Is it just me or does most here agree that Doraleous makes the worst decisions out of the entire group
hahaha my stomach hurts to laugh so much hahaha how much death and destruction I love, Greetings from URUGUAY
Omg, fuckin brilliant, I loved this XD
That was the most beautiful failure I have ever witnessed. Doraleous, you have outdone yourself, sir!
You guys need to play medieval engineers for your next game
wait is this the end of 7d i really hope its not it is my 3rd fav series you guys made
Awsome intro!
First episode both me and my wife  have ever yelled at the tv , \"Simon dont run that way, theres mines!\" Could not stop laughing, best editing of deaths and added features yet. Thick gave me an epiphany of how I wish to die, surrounded by zombies with a rocket launcher. Great jobs guys.
First Raft is over and now this?!?\n\nBut seriously this is a series that I look forward to every week and I'm sad that it will be gone, I really hope you replace it with something that you guys enjoy making. All that matters is we get to watch something that you all love doing and hopefully have a lot of fun with. I think the most enjoyable part is seeing the interactions of group of people that have learned to work well together at times, and other times beautifully fall apart.
Nice office guys??
So is this the last 7 days video?
Will there be a new season or is this the final 7dtd
what a great way to end things. Looking forward to more one day and to see what else you guys do.
I'm going to miss this SO much!
Sad ti see 7 days go, everything you guys do is great but this series was especially great. Thank you for all the laughs and scares in 7 days guys
exceptional episode, however, 2 things tho: no escape plan and understanding the zombies programming, if he had those it would have been... a shit house and boring episode lol. he would have been better to build an island and filled a mote with spikes and propeller blades with turrets as support, or dug a super deep hole with concrete floors and turrets surrounding the floor whilst you all  just sit around the bottom shooting survivors of the falls lol.
Why trust him? He’s the worst at planning anything. Just look at the terrible mountain idea he had. Idk who’s worse, him for his shitty plans or you guys for following them.
Last episode: Doraleous for president. \n\nThis episode: Crucify the sumbitch.
When I realized this was the season finale, I went through the 5 stages of grief :(. This was my fav series apart from subnautica.
Next series should be space engineers i think it would be funny watching simon float out into space and the gang mounting a rescue mission to save him
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
So is Red dead 2 taking the 7 Days To Die Friday
does that gold subscribe button work?  the red one on my screen keeps failing me
WoW, Just Wow
Rip 7days to die ??
bloody simon died like 7 times and made me laugh so my mum said can i see this and then she laugh
Never laughed so much before. My husband an I love you guys. Always can't wait for new videos up, no matter what it is. Loved this series. Can't wait for what else you guys put up :)
Gentlemen this was your very best recreation of the battle of the crater. Well done.
the safest of safe lol
I will miss this series??. Y'all always deliver. I can't wait to see your next co-op series!
By far the best episode ever ????
thanks so much fir this  season guys loved it been playing 7 days to die from start but had to move to modded 7 days as  it got old fast  maybe next time you take this up you would try a mooded one war of the walkers would be a fun one for the neebs gang
OHHHHHH The Humanity!!!
Oh Simon, dying with lots of things. That's pretty much everyone's goal. Also I think you should of went to 32 for that blood moon zombie count, especially since every horde night the zombie count naturally multiplies by how many days passed.
Doraleous I fucking love you
Was that adahop or doralous that changed the settings in the beginning? I think they would have been in a bit better of a situation if they had made moltoves or explosive crossbow bolts. Fire. What they needed was distruction
Play trail makers
That... WAS THE BEST VIDEO IN EXISTENCE!
This was better than Thick’s hoard night. \n\n\n\n\nAnd then it wasn’t.
Sa sa sa sa sa sa, sa sa sa sa sa sa, SA SA SA SA SA SA SANDWICH SHOW!??!
Lmao this was brilliant! I had so much hope for that bunker! what a disaster!
Fricking hilarious
Absolutely great ending....thank you guys for all the joy and laughs
you guys had me Rollin in my own tears with this one??????
Doraleous was so sure his base would work that when it failed all he could do was laugh
I watch all of your videos, but this... this may have been an absolute masterpiece with all of the editing you guys put into it. When we saw the last video some of us knew you guys would face some issues with the design and the zombies AI, but the way you guys handled being killed so many times with 1812 death montage and the addition of ending the video with that song? This has to be my all time favorite video you guys have put out! Thank you so much for your hard work, your creativity, and all the laughs. Assuming this is the end, that was the perfect send off to a game I love to play and loved watching you guys play.\nMuch love!\nA long time fan\nP.S dang that 7 days song is so awesome, can you guys drop the sound clip somewhere for viewers like us?
If you'd only made short characters... Moria got nothing on this place as a tomb!
That is series done?! Boo.
So sad that i wont be watching this serie again every week ,every friday i was waiting for this video. But im not too worrie i know you guys will come up with something as good if not even better
Fucking standing ovation. Amazing.
After a long week of work i look forward to 7 days to die Friday's crazy ark Saturdays and laid back GTA Sunday's love the channel keep up the good work
Oh I have never laughed so hard at one of your videos. Bravo gentlemen to a most excellent series!
This was an awesome series I love every video on the series so what comes next?
Dorealaese  u fuccing idiot u were spouse to be the smart one who would have guessed that they'd dig  ten feet down
Season finale ??!!!!??
I'm speechless!!! That was the most amazing carnival of death I've ever witnessed!! Hazaa!!!
A M A Z I N G
Could have made an actual zombie blender with those blades, bullet proof glass and the hole.
Simon for Neebs gaming president. No one else has the stones to rush into certain death 18 times. \nAppsro is a vandal\nDora secretly plots everyone’s death \nThick well. Just remember cooter\nAnd Neebs he’s to busy planning global peace to be el presidents
Top notch series guys. Gonna miss the series, it was what got me to play 7 days
That was a freaking fantastic end to an exceptional series! Ada, magnificent editing as always, you outdid yourself sir! It is truly sad to see this series end, but am looking forward to seeing what's next. Kisses!!!
So what's next guys?? Love the series hope to see it again
Dora's plan all along and ya'll fell for it. ITS A TRAP!!!
Play together when the game updates. And the series will Never Die.
Season finale!  Does this mean your making room for a new game, RDR2 perhaps!
Doraleous....I have no words.
Best video ever!
Thanks for all the stupidity and clumsiness. You guys rock.
Note to self: Dont build bunkers in games where enemys can dig.
Doraleous is called duckduckgoose now?
I love how much you guys suck at games. It always makes me laugh and puts a smile on my face. Thanks for all the hours of fantastic entertainment.
Good job Doralingus.\nHow do you actually lose at this game if you can just keep respawning?
Any hints on the new Friday night series??
Wow Doraleous I can’t believe I thought that this would work. Needless to say that was an amazing horde, filled with plenty of laughs and failures. Great job Doraleous your ability to protect your friends is amazing as always.
Awesome, we need a new series all these dam survival games was getting to be to much.
All that work, and forgetting to fill a hole screwed ya.. Lol
Lmao \"how am I not dead?\", \"don't know but I get a front row gughhhbhh! Haha.
That was so funny love you guys
I love at 12:17 when Neebs thinks he's a Laser pistol! pew pew pew
I hope you guys do more!!!
Nicely done everybody! Enjoyed the series.
I FUCKING KNEW.. the place is called journeys end... AND ITS THE FINAL PLACE.. I called it...
I do love this series and I hope the continue to make more
The difficulty nor the amount of zombies made a difference! It's the slight overlooking of that damn hole Dora! ??
A+++ editing
Adahop messing with the thermostat over there you evil monster....
Just guys i'm literally dying from laughter
Now try Dead by Daylight!!
This is the equivalent of what almost happened the last horde night - what I wish had happened... \n\nThe horde digging from above... I WISH they had successfully dug completely underneath the Hibachi Buffet base so we could see the worst case scenario!\n\nSorry, but makes for a hilariously good video... case in point.
i guess the JOURNEY'S  must END for this series
Duckduckgoose is my favorite character.
Simon going from standing in barbed wire to just jumping on a land mine is classic Simon. His spacial awareness and lack of control over his movements is the equivalent to a newborn baby Giraffe. Great series fellers, keep doin what you're doin! Kisses!
Sad that all good things come to an end.\nI have really loved watching this series, every Friday evening, after dinner and putting kids to bed, I grab a whiskey and enjoy this.\nGoing to miss this a lot, but man, I have enjoyed this so very much.\nSimon's house collapsing was great fun, but this massive failure tops it all, great way to end it! <3\n\nBig thanks to the whole crew, amazing edits, great fun gameplay!
How convenient. You saved the horde the time and effort of digging graves for you all. LOL
Ok so I'm really sad that the series is ending but that was the best season finale ever!!! XD
That’s was amazing!! Funniest episode on the channel. I really hope this isn’t the last we see of this game on here. Bravo guys:)
Loved it love yall
BEST EPISODE EVER! So sad this season is over. Can’t wait for more.\n\nEDIT: Doralingus’ score was way too generous. After all this build up it backfires and got you all slaughtered.
The only way this gets better is if a red dead 2 series is coming!!!
Guys good job on that transition in the beginning. It was flawless just seriously good job.
Well I do have to admit, things would have gone A LOT worse if Doraleous didn't make that whole thing. So I give him a 6/10 for this one.
aww man :)
Doraleous thicked everyone with a Simon level defense. This made a great video. As always. Toodles.
This video has to hold the world record number of times owned in 7 Days to Die in a single horde night
WOW, this was by far, my favorite episode of 7 days to die. the editing was superber and the music was on point. And My sides are in pain for all of the wonderful laughter, you guys have so graciously bestowed upon us all. thank you. Ps. I'm too lazy for grammar sorry.
Anyone who plays this game knew from the moment this place was shown that it was a death trap lol but an entertaining one . Great series guys Loved it all
Can't wait for commenting on comments to hear what the guys have to say. Dora, I had such high hopes because it was pretty awesome, but when I saw you ignored those other holes I thought... well that's the end of him being allowed to make defenses. Anyways... good job adahop the death montage had me in tears.
music at 0:35 pleas
You got dora’d
Dora blowing open the hole was the only thing to go right this episode
Doraleous: First horde night while I hold my beer....
Whoever said “oh fuck” at 19:10 that was the best/funniest thing I’ve heard on this channel and thick died as a warrior by taking a whole lotta zombie with him
Funniest episode ever lol i love it. Death screams sound effects are funny lol
Was that Anthony's sausage fingers at the start?
This might be the best 7dtd video you guys have ever made.
Damm you guys it's going to be hard to top that series finale.
Finger my butt for a piece of candy
BEST. HORDE NIGHT. EVER!!  can't wait to see u guys explore/tame a randomgen map!
Best. Episode... Ever.
Appsro there is a new fallout its fallout 74 or 75 not sure
And sorry Thick, when you were at the top of that building site, I was also hoping something would happen lol, at least you didn't fall to your death like a bitch.  And Doraleous, an ex military guy should know, A cave, is a grave.
Great jobs every one u die lol rip Simon lik omg
Thick it's smarter on games
That was a great disaster of a finally. Probably funnier to watch than to live through.
Watched this series through three times at least, even just as background noise when I'm busy, cant wait to see whats next.  Any idea what game you guys are going on to or is that a secret until the reveal date? Love the D & A to cant wait to see what happens in the new bridge building venture.
God... my d*ck is hard
Needs is better than Doraleous and Simon
Though i am sad that this is the finale, it has been an excellent ride so far, and this episode has been my favourite (and probably the best) episode yet. thank you guys for all the laughs, the action and work that went into this series. I'm looking forward to what's coming next. ????
Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.
10/10 on the editing!
????
OMG Adahop! Way to close it out in a big way. Deserves an award
if you guys do another season, could i suggest a random generated map instead? would be more interesting to see you guys in an enviroment thats not pre-made and will keep alot of people who knows the navegaze map guessing aswell.
Spooky
They weren't just up shit creek without a paddle... Doraleous rowed them into the center of shit lake and threw away the paddles after knocking a couple of holes into the boat.
It is a little sad to think next week no 7 days to die video I have watched you guys since your first ark video and I love you guys my friend introduced me to you guys with bff and I fell in love with the humor and craziness thank you guys you always give me a reason to smile and laugh even when I am depressed.
This is seriously one of the funniest things I've seen my whole life.  I called my friend and was trying to tell him to watch it, but couldn't stop laughing long enough to get the words out.
Is that Thick singing in the end? \n\nAND 7 DAYS TO DIE IS DONE?!  NOOOOOO!  My fiance and I always watch this together like a TV show and it's her favorite series from you guys.  The description says it's a \"season finale\" but the ending message makes it sound like a \"series finale\".  Will this series just be on a hiatus and will eventually be back on a weekly basis or is it done permanently with only a few revisits now and again?
Holy shit, guys!  That was taking epic failure to a new level!!!  Just when I think you couldn't get anymore entertaining... going to miss the series, but all good things must come to an end, and I'm sure ya'll have something new coming down the pipe.  Viva la Neebs gaming!
I'm so glad dora thick'd this up. Probably the best episode in the series
my question is why did they not escape through the door they came in from??? lol Dora, i would have made the sme mistake.
The dog I loved for 10 years has recently passed and when nothing can stop me from crying some how you guys manage to cheer me up and make me smile.
This was the best season finale ever, the constant maniacal laughter from Dora and the death compilation near the end were fantastic. Keep up the amazing work and keep the videos coming.
Off that just hapend nice trap Dora :P\nI like that moment whene your like... Oh that may be a prob... looking at the 2 hole in the cilling and your like oh well what ever :P\nAny way it was really nice well done. (any way it was one of the 2 thing I tought it would hapend AKA... Crazy easy night whit great set up or the zombie go right for your head and fall on your bed...)
What a freaking episode, the music was great. I love the death cams mixed in with the overture. This was one of my favorite series to watch by you guys, I am sad that this is the end. I look forward to your great content and see what you are trying next. Keep up the good work guys.
WAIT WAHT THE SERIES IS OVER?!?! ;-; what will I do on fridays now? ;-;;-;-;-;-;-;-;-
You guys kicked ass!
I swear some people should fallow Simon around and make T-shirts out of every thing he say's. \"I Like to die with a lot of things\"
i just watched the intro right now and doralingus u build a grave.
BEST EPISODE EVER!
21:52 “I’m stuck on a bahb-woiah!” ????
Please, please, PLEASE do another season for Alpha 17! So many new changes are coming that Simon can die in all new ways and Doraleous can create new epic failures! Thanks for a great series everyone!
whats the orchestral song that was used at the end
To be fair it may have worked if the difficulty weren't turned but who knows
this would be a good time to wait for A17 to release and pretend like that really was a journey's end. starting fresh in the new game, yall are gonna love the updates
Is this the final 7 days video? I hope not...
Lol good job Doraleous your now officially worse than Simon
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Ark and 7 days are my favourite things to watch period ????????????????
It be whole new learning curve for them and everyone else when ever the update comes out.
I want to know how many time each of u died
11:55 I love when neebs speaks gibberish????
It's been a crazy adventure through Navezgane with you guys! Hopefully you come back once Alpha 17 releases because it looks to be an almost whole new game. Much love & keep doing what you guys do so well.
I legit grew up watching you guys, keep it up my dudes!!????
BEST HORDE NIGHT EVER!!! Oh My God that was funny.  Excellent editing.  I was watching at work and had to stifle my laughter the whole time.
Well prepared! Hats off to you doral! Looked promising heheha haha
This is so sad ????????
My girlfriend and I just watched this and were laughing the whole time.  You need to make a shirt that says I survived Doraleous's Death Hole\n\nP.s. I hope your next game is Empyrion again unloved that game\n\nP.s.s. Simon is the best.
Oh My God They Killed Simon !
man I love that song !!! please tell me you are going to make a metal music video, out of this footage. that track during the horde was awesome. would love to hear it with the voices in the background and that track turned up.
Great series and love you guys to death
That battle music is awesome am glad am using it in the creation of my doom wad. I guess never make any defences underground.
Please can we have some more on  a new map
Oh doralious, you sure know how to engineer a beautefull disaster.
G.L.O.R.I.O.U.S.
best quality content <3
Been here since you guys were at 150k subs and I must say I think this was your best episode yet. I was laughing the entire time. Keep up the good work!
22:12 Dora: \"This place is haunted!\". Funny
Spectacular failure, Doraleous! Love it!
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader\" this statement made my actual arse laugh ?? but on a serious note Dora should be banned from planning horde nights
Hey guys I was wondering if you guys are going to end your ark series as well because I really don’t want you to. Your ark series is my favourite and I just don’t want to see it die.
I love it when a Neebs gaming plan falls to shit!
Nooooooo! We need more!
who was that guy at the beginning that was screwing with the settings? And how did nobody notice the weird spike in numbers and difficulty, where they to engrossed in the action?
Please at some point come back to this! You guys are the only reason i bought this game
It's like watching home alone again
\"These first aid kits should come in handy.\"
This went as wel as I expected lol
Extremely enjoyable episode!!!!
Omg omg so so fn good! I really hope it's not the end!
I’ll miss this series so much!!
While terribly sad to see 7 Days end, this was by far the best way it could of ended! Thank's to all those who lost their lives in Dora's Tomb and thank you Adahop for the marvelous editing of this masterpiece!
Bravo, One more thing from YouTube gone, but hey, you guys are still rocking Ark so keep it up!!!
19:10 when thick screamed “OH FUCK” I lost my shit??
so close to having an amazing base, hoping you guys are returning in alpha 17
I love how Simon was the last one to die. Good job
Holy shit that was amazing
Lmfao that was hilarious to watch.
You have to come back for the A17 update! We need a sequel series!!   You don't need to use the same map, use a random generated map with the update and fight over who gets to drive the jeep! If there is no sequel series I'll just fling myself into a spinning blade trap that throws my body parts into dutch oven land mine and go out Simon style!!!
That was amazeballs
So is this the last episode of 7 days?
43 deaaths
I would love to see u guys play ark adorachn
Let this be a lesson learn never leave doralious in charge of ur live
Haha haha loved it !!!!!!!!!!’n
Great job guys on raising $11k last night caught the last 5ish minutes of it at least saw Buffett44
Hands down the funniest horde night
7DaystoDie on Xbox One and PS4 is getting cancelled...OH GOD
This episode is amazing.
DORALEOUS YOU FUCKING IDOIT
Great season had fun with the poetry Neebs
The mistake was leaving the holes... Dirt... You only needed dirt. Fill those holes with dirt and the zombies would never have made it down. They can only dig sideways, not down. They fell into the holes and dug forward towards you until the structure collapsed. Best fuck up ever. 10 out of 10 IGN
dude I remember when you guys announced that you were about to start playing this game can't believe you've already done so many episodes I'm heartbroken to see that it is over but look forward to the hopes of watching another 7 Days to Die reboot lol love y'all keep up the awesome work
Super opening!!!
Dang my suspicion about you guys making a base at Journey's End being the end of the series was right! I'll miss this series immensely, but all things must end. I can't wait to see what is coming up next for the channel!
What a great series, sorry to see it come to an end. But I can't wait to see what comes next!
Best series. Looked forward to every week. Will miss it tons. Damn Dora set you guys up for failure loool
Yoooooooooooooooo
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\nthis cant be the end i love this show,  you guys have made me laugh so much the past year. i will truly miss this series. thank  you
Oooohhh nooooo guys please please don't stop yet really really enjoyed this game watching you guys an Simon's pure ?? madness it like every week this is my main YouTube show really going to miss this guys???? ?????
Just got home and my brain screamed oh my God it horde tonight
I'm reading these comment like 'Damn, I can't be only one..' but it seems to be. \nI love you guys, but i really didn't enjoy this. I get that you can't control a mistake, if it indeed was.  After the tour Dora gave of the bunker I was really looking forward to seeing it action, seemed well though out, kind of a mad scientist vibe going on during construction. Now I never expected it to be perfect but maybe to fail partway, not immediately. A lot was lost here. \nGame idiot was awesome and think you did fantastic bringing that to life in Simon but it's feeling extremely forced at times and this episode had a lot of them. This was the first time it crossed from grinning laughter to frustration for me as a spectator, I wished he would just get mad and fuck off at about the second spinning blade death. \nDudes, you rock, I'll always be a sub, supporter and recommender of this channel, I'd just love to for things to go back to feeling less, for lack of a better terminology, scripted. Maybe its an editing and timing thing idk, I just feel the neebs gaming spice is getting weaker in some videos. \nOh, the tumbleweed after neebs' outburst, mmhmm just perfect, big lol right there. \nMuch love bros #nohomo
how do you download the file it says download but its not on my system anywhere I can find anyway
I’ve never seen so much death ever lol
My new favorite neebs quote.... “I’m in a fist fight with a cheerleader” ??
Does this settle the bunker vs no bunker argument?
So is this really it, the end where everyone dies from dorleangus's death tomb hole
The best day ever!
The most I've seen you guy's die.
Please don't end this series ! I know it's just the end of the season ! You all should check out the mods for 7D2D !
RIP 7 days to die good luck old friend.
So this is really the ending I thank you Neebs crew you guys made my Friday nights
wait wait wait is this really the last episode?!
I remember watching the first episode and thinking this could be good
Dang it!!\nI saw the 1st episode and didn't like the game (I thought it was too slow) but I rejoined at thicks horde night\nNow it is stopping again, I just joined!!!!
Play conan exiles plz
Haha great season finale.
Just amazballs!!! Well done guys well done.
This sucks. So what's next?\nI will rewatch the playlist.
The moment I saw all the mines on the ground I knew Simon gonna die a bunch of times
Love Doraleous' score
So will there be another season of this or do you actually mean \"series finale\" ? Because people do that but never upload this again.
Now that's a season finale!
Best \"Death Hole\" ever ????????????????????????????????
Great series guys. I always look forward to watching the content you guys create it’s hilarious and awesome to watch.
Lol??
OH no no no sad sad sad tears I loved this series, binge watched it many times, don't end it :(  You guys are doing an amazing job! Please continue.  IF YOU ALL WANT THEM TO CONTINUE PLEASE GIVE LIKES.
Great build!
This series so so fucking good
Maybe dorlious was trying to get them killed?!!!!
cant beleive its over this show is how i found you guys but what are you gonna do for friday now
Truly excellent and thoroughly appropriate end to a really great series! Can't wait to see what u guys have next!\nPS Assuming it has a rock star editor mode like gta I'd love to see a red dead cinematic series when that's out!
Best thing everrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!???? Kisses
0:11 Simon??
I really don't want this series to end. It is still my favorite series y'all have done and IMO the best thing since Neebsylvania. Please continue it. This was my favorite thing that my Patreon donation went towards. And now I'm severely depressed.
what a great early bday present!
Is this the end of the season
You guys are the only youtubers that can get me to watch and enjoy a video series on a game that I would hate to play. Thanks guys.
I loved 7days to die I watched every episode and will miss the session but will you do a new series soon
Abs of steel ????
Wow. Very epic
Best episode
Perfection.
Perfection.
How old is Simon?
Doraleous is never gonna hear the end of this one
So many death mainly Simon
Adahop is an evil mastermind!
This better not be the last episode if it is I swear I will find you and make you make more episodes
U guys should have the community build u a base for a special episode were u take a day 700 horde in a base they built with a full load out to make it fair and fun
Please don't stop making 7 days videos, it's my Friday night theater
I feel the same way as if I would feel when come back from a good good holidays. Sad. Because it ended. It was a great run... What we will do on fridays now?? :(
Absolutely fantastic job guys!!! Loved this entire series more than I thought I would at the start. Looking forward to you guys revisiting it some time in the future. For now thiugh I'm intrigued to see what you have in store for next/or future Fridays! Kisses!!! ??????
Does anyone agree that neebs can be a dick i when he says over there and doesent shot
Cant wait for season 2
336 hours! I'm so sorry Adahop, truly. Lol
This was the most beautiful pile of shit I’ve ever seen. It’s been a good series. I hope we’ll return to it some day #breadstrong
I love how at 7 mins in the subtitles Neebs style censor Neebs
\"I like to die with lots of shit\" Fuckin love you simon, no homo!
I found you guys because of my love of 7D2D. Now I love you all as much. Thanks for the series. And thanks for being awesome people. Hopefully alpha 17 makes you want to return.
When’s season 2
Lmao major death trap and major destruction ????
Awesome series guys. Sad to see it go, yet excited to see what comes next!
Sooo many deaths lol love the video but dora you should have know better and the rest of you should have known better then to go underground knowing they can dig through anything im hoping you guys will come up with a more efficient way to survive the whored with a mile of defenses i mean spikes as far as the eye can see a tower surrounded with an escape route simon is the only one who should be constantly dying in these episodes thats his thing and falling into holes ????
2:27 YES finally\nbeen waiting for the return of Doraleous' alter egos
So realistically how many times did you have to revert the server back because someone set of a mine too early? lol
Crap!  It's over?  WHY!
I'm so sad that this is coming to an end before we got to see Simon be in charge of prepping for a hoard night.
Please don't end this series.   Or at least start a new one!!!!!
This whole series is fantastic and this the best episode. I will eagerly wait for you guys to return. Oh and Simon your not that bad at the game.
After seeing the video with everyones face and verifying with a second video what appsro looks like. It kills me how everyone looks like you'd expect except appsro. The guy sounds like the pictures of Mr. Plinkett and looks like ... Um... Not Mr. Plinkett. I apologize, thought i would have something more clever by that point.
Damn,there goes my friday routine of watching Neebs 7 days to die and Dead Meat kill count pairing
Everything about this was great. Couldn't ask for a better way to end. Gosh dang f**king zombies! XD
Best episode of 7dtd
Bravo
The greatest Horde Night EVER!!!! I laughed my ass off.. The wife, the cat, the dog, the kids...they all thought I'd lost my damn mind.. Very funny shit.. Thank you for such great content.
Couldn't stop laughing. Best episode of 7d2d.  Have enjoyed everything you guys have done. Keep up the great work. ... sidenote: Appsro has stated he will be useless after the 26th. I hope you will try to develop a series of his escapades in Red Dead 2 as it will not be out for PC for a bit, if at all.
Omg the most epic horde night ever. One of the best of the series. Hope they do a horde night that Simon does the base defense can't  be any worse of a survival rate that doraleous had maybe better, at the very least it will be entertaining. Maybe neebs as his partner just to  be the guiding light he would need.
This death hole would be great to include as a POI in a mod
Doraleous is the best! Brilliant editing, loved it! :D
\"I like to die with allot of things\" ... me too man.
Thanks for this awesome episode! You guys are the best!
When Subnautica almost ended you started a pole we chose 7days to die now it ended will we get a new pole ? I mean subnautica below zero DLC is coming soon
Should of made a pit to hide in they only sug down cuz it was the shortest why to u u need to hide under the pit
Been a great series. thanks guys for making it.
What silly stupid fun. Thanks for such a great series!
Wish there was a love button at the top not just a thumbs up. This video is great. Now I am going to have to start over on watching 7days to die.
There for a minute it looked like Simon was about to go pro gamer jumping and avoiding. But then he got stuck in the death hole and he panicked, good ol Simon never disappionts
ya know i'd like to see a simon owned counter in next series.. every fuckup simon does the counter pops up and goes up 1.
im sad now.
GREATEST FINALE FOREVER!!!!!
Simon you fucking idiot you to doralious
Are you guys going to do a different world when the next season starts?
Next season can y'all make a base in the prison
Adahop you maniacal bastard!  You killed them all!  WELL DONE SIR!!!!
the end of a saga!! 7  days is one of the best series you guys have done yet.
Dora may have messed up thier protection but made an amazing episode!!! I laughed so much XD (sorry Simon) 10/10 for comedy!
BEST EPISODE EVER! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
so season finale just means you're taking a break right? still a downer but really anticipating you guys with Alpha17. beating a dead horse but underground, zombies dig above wherever you are. stupid zombies CANT FOLLOW SIMPLE DIRECTIONS! YOU IDIOTS! this was more fun than the lighthouse. thanks guys. Always good R&R after repairing railcars next to a group of Simons
@ Neebs Gaming Yes double ark uploads hopefully love the vids
It's like the Medical scene from Aliens but everyone died... Also zombies.
Nice
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader!!\" ~Neebs; by far the best episode I laughed myself to tears! Loved the series!
well,that is a great end of the journey,best video of all
Most epic death scene ever.
Normally when I watch people playing a game I know very well (I'm in the 7days club since alpha 5) it annoyes the hell out of me when they don't know shit. With you guys it's the opposite. I already had to chuckle the whole way threw dora's tour of the horde shelter last episode. That turned into loud laughter threw out this episode. I love you guys!
Whole time he just making their grave and pretending to be smart.  ??.  I bet you feel wrong guy who commented to me he'd do something this time lol
Simon makes the best \"im dead\" sound lol
That intro music reminded me of Bugs and Taz Time Busters for the PS1.
AWESOME EPISODE!!!
Thanks guys for the laughs, I’ll miss this series please do bring it back my good sirs
LOL - they come directly for you, you have to be around the hole for them to come down, if you are off to the side they will dig for you, lol\n\ni love this vide, great job guys, :D
Why August 19th?
Sad to see the end but loved the series...Simon you came so far in this game ...but I have enjoyed watching how each character kinda fell into certain roles  and the 7 days song at the end is one of my faves Thick44!       love y'all \nAnd still so grateful my friend intruduced me to your guy's videos    ????????
This is a sad day for this series??\nBut are you guys going to do a pull for a new series like last time?
Wow exactly what I said happened ?? who knew??????????
I love how Simon sounds like a Deformed Borker while he dies
Best. Episode.Ever.
Shoot, now what am I supposed to watch on friday after a long week of high school and work?
If the intent was to make this a sacrificial pit then job well done. Trap yourselves behind impenetrable defenses and await the slaughter. \nDoraleous was hoping to summon what exactly with this build?
Damn that gave me chills at the end the song really did it for me
Who changed the games settings
Duckduckgoose: \"Ill kill them right now.\" Simon: \"I like to die with alot of things.\" Neebs: \"Fist fightin a cheerleader, yeah!!\" Appsro: \"Do whatever you gotta do maaaan!\" Thick:\" Thats it, your goin with me!\" One liners that explain each of you in a nutshell. Fantastic stuff guys even if the failure of base wqs a tomb. Good ending
Wow awesome series guys it’s amazing that you guys have such fun with it \n\nMakes my weekends awesome to know I wake up on a Saturday morning and watch 7 days then Sunday I get ark \n\nPlease have something entertaining and fun to replace 7 days i think all your fans would appreciate it very much :)\n\nYour my favourite YouTubers :) so glad I subbed
I think they meant to put October 19th not August 19th
So sad to see the series possibly end. Im so happy I took the time to watch it! Simon you are the greatest part of the team! Thanks for an amazing series!
Nooooooo it ended
Dont forget guys zombies are like dogs and you're their reluctant owners, they like to dig, and they will stop at nothing to give you cuddles
lol, after all, that time doral spent on this he forgets to cover up one hole that kills you all what a shame lol.
we need a rd2 serie
This series was one of the most funiest series you guys did it was a great playthrough
Its been a while since one showed up. DuckDuckGoose [Dora] and that was it for the psycho names this time around.
after a mentally taxing day filled with midterms and studying, I'm glad to see one of my favourite series up once I got home
Were the deaths in the end for this episode, or the whole series? How many times have you guys died  since you started the show? Want to know.. Best episode yet of any series. Can't wait to see more!
Such an awesome series Neebs Gaming. I'm sad to see it end, but enjoyed every episode.
I hope you guys keep making these videos!!! I love 7 days from you guys so much!!!!
I loved every second of this
Duckduck goose
Dora score...1 lol
Omfg, I am so empty now! What am I going to do on my Saturday mornings now! Great episode and I can’t wait to see what you move on to now!
I'm letting Dora design my nuclear bunker not to protect me from the nuclear holocaust, but so I can have fun gunning down zombies while they break through the walls.
The bunker was a good idea in theory. IN THEORY, communism works. In theory.
No you guys can't end this series because this and ark are the best ones yet
The best one ever!!!
Seriously guys you have outdone yourself this was the funniest episode of this show ever my God I was howling laughing... I can't wait for you guys to come back to the series and I also can't wait to see what you've got in store for us in the meantime hopefully it has something to do with Red Dead Redemption 2 ... Doraleous What a Beautiful Disasterpiece!!!
Seems like you guys are clearing your schedule a bit, with the end of this and the end of ark seemingly on the horizon.\n\nI’m hoping after some frighty night fun it’s going to be some epic Red Dead 2 cinematics.
Ya kno, if nothing else, you sure can't deny that the zombies in this game are genuine experts at completely fucking up your best laid plans, just about every time. It's been fun boys.
Such a good way to end the series. Honestly cant wait for red dead. I love you guys so muxh you just seem to get how humor works and by far my favorite team of youtubers to watch! Please never stop
Y'all ever notice when the camera switches to neebs view he is rarely if ever actually fighting the zombies? I mean every now and then he'll fire off a few shots but for the most part he is just watching the others
Dog pile on Appsro!  Oh my damn!  Dora! You really suck at building defenses!  Wait, you're abandoning the series?  Damn. That means all I have to watch is your Ark series now.  To be frank, the rest just plain bites ass.  No GTA.  No Far Cry.  Very little resembling action, and comedy.\n\nI think you're dropping the ball.
have been a sub since the beginning and this is the best episode you have done keep on this wonderful work love you guys
Wonderful finale. Was expecting a burial but got much more than I expected!
During this final horde setup when dora was working under the house I was betting with my girlfriend that the plan would be to create a big pit to lure all the zombies in under the house and when enough of the zombies were confined to the chamber you guys would blow all the supports and drop the house on the lot of them while you guys escaped out of a back tunnel. I suppose the ceiling did come down but I have to ask.. Why in the hell didn't dora make an escape route? Thank you guys so much for your creations. This has been one of my favorite series to date and I'm sad to see it end for now.\nSimon, don't ever lose that 'never say live' spirit.
Awesome guys, just thanks for all of these series.
Seriously had a rough day and this video made me laugh and smile so hard!!!
what a great way to end a great series!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!  Thanks for splitting my side in laughter!
Loved this series, fantastic finale.
Not even a minute in and I had to comment... best opening EVER!!!
This series has been so entertaining to watch!!!! Love it guys ?
Thank you guys.  I don't know what I'm going to look forward to on Fridays now
What a sexy, sexy video.
Fucking hell, doraleous ??
This was so much fun to watch! Thanks for sucking, guys!
Sucks it's the season finale, but can't wait for the next. Thanks Doraleous for show us what NOT  to do for a horde night ??....or ever in general! ?? should have had Simon do the structure! I think he can fill in a hole properly! ?
The final chapter was as epic as they get. Thanks for the great fun guys. Loved this series.
This series has become my favorite to watch. It has allowed you guys to channel your creativity better than other games and I'm sad that it's done. With that said I look forward to whatever you guys have planned next. \nThanks neebs gaming crew for the great series
Season finale? Will you guys be taking up another survival game in the mean time while you wait for A17? Or will you be dropping the series longer, even permanently?
I'm actually glad it failed, it was a lot more fun and hilarious than any other horde night!! ??
well guys thanks for entertaining us that was the most epic horde night yet!! keep it up and show us me the struggling youtuber how it done simply amazing.
My sides hurt so much right now! Funniest episode ever. ????????
Honestly the best episode. It somehow beat Simon's house collapsing. The music crescendos when rocks fell and the awesome guitar solos during the action. Was perfect in everyday. Watched it during school and my class looked at me funny and my friend even asked if I was ok cause I was laughing so much. Love yall wo much! Hope this returns with the next big update
And the not my fucking job award goes to...... DORALEOUS! For single handedly dooming what should have been essentially a battleship of a base that you Titanthick'd ?? not sure which was the iceberg the zombies or Doraleous' engineering ??
I almost spit coffee on my screen when Simon got the ceiling to his head and his spirit floated away.  Well done boys!
Best series finale EVER, I have literally pissed myself laughing!!!
So that how 7 days to die dies well I call that a epic success for the zombies in the epic failure for neebs and Friends
Greatest episode I’ve ever seen on YouTube by far I will watch this episode again and again and still laugh about it
I'm just waiting for the Neebs Gaming Porno \"Get Thicked\"
No plz
They have a adahop button
Wow! Boom Baby!
congrats trophy
o wait is this the last episode?
I feel so bad for Doraleous. I mean, he tried so hard to make a bad ass Bunker for the whole team to survive the Horde Night and spent so much time building it... All just for it to completely backfire on him and literally all fall apart in the end.\n\nE for Effort, my friend...
I love this series!! I hope it comes back soon, Neebs team thank you for always making such of great content!!!
Best one yet
This episode the zombies have revenge on the neebs crew and it is so funny and awesome
Great season cant wait to see more later
I was so excited for this walking to my car to eat my lunch and watch this video.  It exceeded my expectations and made all my dreams come true.  I love Dora but I think we all knew exactly what was going to happen and I still giggled like a 12 year old girl when it did!
Seconds in and I knew I was going to love this episode. I have had many times laughing at your videos but this one I definitely laughed the most, genuine hysterical laughter. Love you all so much.
can we christen a new term now? Dora'd: definition: when Dora builds anything that backfires royally.
Nnnnnnnnoooooooo!!!!!!
I'm sad to see it end but what is next on game plan to take over 7 days spot
fantastic stuff, had tears from laughing too hard.... plus im now late for work XD glorious episode!!!
What an epic ending to an epic saga. It is said that Simons ghost still haunts what is now known as Doraleous' Pit Inn
Great series guys. Thanks for all the laughs.
My mom thinks your hot neebs
Can't wait to see what you guys do next congrats on this series you guys are without a doubt the best youtubers looking forward to seeing what's next keep up the good work guys
I absolutely love watching all your videos but this has been 1 of my top 5 favorites. Cant wait till the next season of it. You guys are amazing!!!
So........ What did you learn?
Single greatest episode ever!!!
BRAVO! BRAVO! \nCANNONS! !! BRAVO!!
Go back to Minecraft now lol XD
First time commenting, on any video actually... but what a Fantastic Season Finale! \n\nMy girlfriend and I found your channel when you all first started making 7 Days to Die videos. We were looking for a video that would give us a tutorial on how to play the game without dying so much and what we got was so much more...\nWe have been obsessed with Neebs Gaming ever since and have been watching everything we can get our hands on from each of you religiously for the past year.\n\nWe are sad to see this series end, as it was our favorite, and hope you pick it back up when the new update eventually drops. \n\nLove you guys, keep up the good work, we look forward to your videos each week!
August 19th? 0:03
Your the best YouTubers
Didnt give Simon a chance to set up a base for horde night
Is this the complete ending
SEASON 2?????
Nooooooooo
Make Simon the next horde night supervisor
This is now my favorite episode. That hole was the most deceptive thing I've ever seen. Looks safe but in reality it's more dangerous then anything I've ever seen made. You should leave a sign showing the world this is your tomb after that fiasco.
I was pretty sure it would go the way it did, hahah, but it wouldnt be a Neebs gaming episode without the chaos, ffs guys, but still great <3 btw neebs is gonna need a lot of meat stew after this :D
Damn well goobye for now 7daystodie on neebsgaming it was fun watching while i played on ps4 time to start over till next episode of something on neebsgaming
I love this video! ?? what am i going to do without 7 days ??\nYa'll better play more Scribble.io
What a beautiful finale
It was night at my house I woke everybody I was laughing so hard
I love Ya'll this is the best channel on the youtubes, this made my week THANK YOUALL
Bring back Subnautica...????
I knew from the reveal that the zombies were going to dig straight down and ruin that whole thing
You guys probably already know what you’ll be filling the Friday night hole with, but if not, might I suggest, we look to the stars. wink wink
What does this “season finale” thing mean?
THE MOST ANTICIPATED EVENT IN CHANNEL HISTORY!!! WILL THEY MAKE IT OUT ALIVE??\n\n\n\n\nNope.
oh p.s thanks for the entertainment... you know it's good shit when you don't mind re watching an entire series.
When the green fatty fell on appsro, what song is that playing?
rage quitting bastards! ( drawn to death narrators voice )... Come back when the  alpha whatever is finally released? or maybe move on. greener pastures?? like... red dead maybe?
That's what I call an EPIC fail.. I couldn't stop laughing.
I assume they are coming back to this (prob once A17 drops) as it is a season finale not series finale
No plan survives contact with the enemy.
I'm kinda upset you ended this series; I stopped watching arc videos 4 months ago because they've gotten boring and are all the same. What am I supposed to watch now??
your stopping it, please don't.
Y'all screams were the highlight of my day
The flaw in Doraleous' base made this a great episode, as well as the editing. I think this was the greatest episode in the whole series.
That was wonderful, it went so wrong!! Enjoyed this series as much as ark. Looking forward to what’s next guys!! Rdr2? What ever it is I know you all will make it wonderfully entertaining.
Dora really fucked the pooch on this one. It doesn't look good for a possible Dora and co construction
15:23 a wild simon appears LOL!
A whole year of fridays that made my day a whole lot better are over. I enjoyed every second, from the prison to the haunted house. Thank you for making such a great series that was adored by many.
Jesus, the music with the constant Doralingus chuckling... Best horde night so far by far
So sad the series is ending now. Alexa, play Jeep Stuff by Neebs Gaming
I was expecting a badass bunker but this was much better. The music was especially good. Thank you neebs for making me laugh and than you Adahop for a fantastically edited video.\n\nEdit: That's it? I understand this game has limited endgame but god this was a great series. What's next?
omfg, that was hilarious. can't wait for next season.
In BFF you guys ever notice o\nAbout the Colonel 100s, that the one that totally owns it you respect but the one that made a new account you made fun of.  Just thought it was interesting
Fantastic intro.
this is the best episode of 7 days ive watched. great ending to my favourite of your series on this channel. great work guys
Btw simon jumping over spinning blades i was shocked he was able to get off 3 jumps before his demise it was like watching emmit smith shake off defensive tackles for the touchdown run
THANK YOU
Best horde night ever!
Ada you outdid you're self sir
Thank you all for making my fridays the best .going to miss the seven days to die episodes they are the best .
Bravo sirs. Better series then most tv shows. I tip my hat
Should have been in neeb's cabin
Had to be the dumbest series
I watched the whole video 2 times and I couldn't stop smiling. This is one of your best videos and the editing is amazing. The overture and Thicks song really put the cherry in top. Does anyone have a link to the full version of Thicks song because that one is going in my playlist.
Yoooo this was THE BEST EPISODE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
Lamp
loved that intro lol
lol what a disaster. I love the sounds simon makes when he dies.
Doraleous Disaster!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, now there will now be a 7 days to die sized hole in my life... what am I supposed to watch as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? This series better get replaced with Simon's sandwich show lolz #Breadstrong????... Thanks for the laughs, it was great while it lasted!
This the last episode? Or it just reads like it.
Shit didn’t even hit the fan and went straight for their faces
When did Minecraft get so realistic
My favorite series by far and it was an awesome last episode! I hope yall return to it soon.
I hope to god this isnt the end of the series.    I was so excited for todays episode me and my buddy from xbox watch every time one comes out and we play 7 days together. I was taken by surprise by the outcome of dorals horde defenses. I didnt expect what took place one bit. All that hard work he did to make it and they dig in behind his defenses lol.  That sucks
I've enjoyed this so much. Im excited to see what comes in its place. Thanks for all the funny moments. And Dora you really Thicked up that one.
??7 Days, never forget!\nPS...the song at the end is amazing guys.
I predicted this, just not at this scale of shitshowness. Great editing btw
Most spectacular episode ever! Great work, absolutely loved every second of the series!!!
Gud vid luv your channel
I love it when you guys fail, never go pro, always be the everyman (men) of gaming
Season or series?
Bittersweet. An amazing epic finale, but a finale nonetheless. And an incredible editing feat. I hope that you guys can come back to this in a year or so when the game has been updated and heavily patched. Maybe a nice random map. I love this game and you guys made it that much more entertaining. Thanks.
Well that went...well.Don't ever stop 7 dtd you crazy M.F.ers
Lol that was a spectacular fail. I love this series
This is by far my favorite 7 days video!
It looked like such a promising idea.. A+ for effect, Dora.
Even though this didnt go to plan, great job Dora. I was laughing so hard! Funniest ep so far.
Wait what 7days to die is over... why???!!! ??
Know that was epic
THIS IS AWEEESSSOOOMMEE!!!!
Had to re-watch this 4 times, because I kept laughing thru the entire thing.  This was so well done!!!  Editing was just dead on and hysterical.
What an epic way to end it ??
What?!?! Finale when's the new season?
Could not stop laughing, almost died while eating my lunch hahaha
NOOOOO DONT END!
Might be the best episode yet, EPIC!
This was the best episode ever in any series you have made yet. Amazing job boys. Id like too thank you for the years of entertainment and i would love too see more from your channel for many more years to come. Even if \"doralingus\" lead you to your perfect death i dont think it could have ended any better. Hows that beer taste now boys? Well earned and bloody maybe? #COMMENTINGONCOMMENTS
I knew this was a bad setup, but had no idea it would be this bad
Wonder what new series you guys could come up with! Really enjoyed these over the year, well done! ??
If you end Ark I'm unsubscribing...well prob not but still. Something good better replace this.
Bravo, Fellas! What a great finale. I loved Doralious just giggling at everyone in full panic mode.
I for one will miss this series. But, its was a hell of a send off. I kinda was hoping Doraleous had rigged add the whole ceiling with TNT and he had a secret switch wired to it. Just waiting for the climax moment to in tomb them all.
OMG BEST EPISODE EVER!!! AND IVE ONLY WATCHED 10 MINS!
I was so happy to find that Simon finally got the torch he wanted
Best one yet gonna miss this
The forest next?
Is this really the end of 7 days to die because I am going to miss you guys playing this
Hey needs gaming y'all should play the forest since this little series is over with now just an idea check it out needs will like it
What a fucking amazing way to end a series cant wait to see what's next!!
One of the best 7 Days video you guys have ever made. Super hilarious, great work guys!
Best. 7 Days. Video. Ever.
Wow nice job Dora...\"you really prepared well\"
Oooh Simon
Awe dangit. I don't want it to end ??
Absolutely loved this episode so so funny well done Doraleous?? and gutted the series is ending it is my favourite that you guys have done. But I hope whatever is to come, whatever is going to replace it is just as good! High expectations guys! Much love :)
When i saw the word \"End\" i hoped it was the last spiderman video but ya know its Friday. I can dream cant I.
I could not have hoped for a better ending
Great finale! Hope you guys return to 7 days soon. Alpha 17 is dropping soon and it has all kinds of badass improvements. I think you guys can contine making this great series when it comes out. Just think of the fun you guys can have with the new vehicles. You can get bikes, mini bikes, motorcycles, jeeps and even a Madmax style gyrocopter. Just think of it Simon flying a gyrocopter.
Seriously, laughed my socks off... “best laid plans” curse strikes again. ??
This made me cry c:
Simply amazing
This was so good, that it makes you wanna slap yo momma!\nThanks for the series! Made my friday evenings or hungover saturdays a whole lot better!
It saddens the shit outta me to see this end. But i know theres something just as good, if not better coming. Thank you guys for this incredibly amazing series. Cant wait to see what you have in store for us next! And thick44 sir... well done on the song! Great fucking cut! Doraleous... for shame! I love you, but holy fuck....  great video, again fellers!
O sweet lord I have not laughed that hard in forever. So needed that after a rough week. I now need a break for my break just to recover from my break. Spectacular epic fail Dora! lolololol
Brilliant! Only Doraleous is capable of making something this ingenious  on paper that fails so effectively in application.\nReally though, what made him think zombies wouldn't eventually start raining from the sky?
Im subscribed to many youtubers, but Neebs is the only channel where I always watch new videos. I think its safe to say that Neebs Gaming is my favorite channel. Thanks for the great content!
oh fuck that was great.  after a long day of work, this is just perfect to come home to and watch after the kids go to bed.  unfortunately theyre all awake due to me laughing my ass off.  and i think my bronchitis is making a comeback.  thanks guys, i see you next season! orr else..(shakes fist at the screen)
Great finale guys
I wish I could be on comments with comments that part when thick looks up and sees all them zombies will forever go downs as the funniest shit in the world. Hands down also keep it up your guys videos are getting better and better every time.
When neebs put on thick's duster... https://imgur.com/a/AsQrmCL at 22:49
And so it really did become a grave. Best way to end the series. Love you guys!
Looks like I'm the mayor of Itoldyousoville. I called the roof collapsing last week.
I love how confident Dora was this whole time.. haha love you all!!
so THAT'S why the place is called journeys end
Video hasnt even started but I see the title......why.....this has been great...but I understand yall prolly tired of doing this
Please tell me the series will continue. Please tell me you guys aren't done with 7 Days
NOOOOO I NEED MORE
Is this the end of 7 Days? Whats next?
Funniest episode yet!!!
I want to think the “Duckduckgoose” Dora name was a dig at his dirty Minnesotan name for that game (Duck Duck Grey Duck)
Can we get a video of just how fucked journey's end was? Thanks!
The only part that worked was the tunnel demo.  The rest was a shit show.  It would be awesome to see you guys actually pull this off just once.
Barrles dont make heat or torches
I love the Irony that this was the most well prepaired Horde Night, and ended in the biggest fiasco
omg that was amazing! Totally didnt expect the fantastic failure until i saw debris falling above them.
Im sad to see it go but thank you for all the good times guys great work and much love cant wait to see what's next but i must admit i will miss 7 days to die
well death iI guess
Loved this episode! especially when neebs was safe and simon brought them all over to him haha
holy jesus how much did i miss
NOOO 7 DAYS TO DIE WAS THE ONE THING U WATCHED BC YOU STOPPED DOING RAGE COP AND GTA MODS pls continue rage cop with and without cinematic and mods and gta without cinematic bc i loved those pls
Damn. Fall back to ark I guess
Guys the video pic said SEASON FINALE. Not series finale so this is on hiatus. \nOn that note Neebs Gaming crew thank you for ending it on a high note and not some cheesey slop thrown together. \nLove guys and cant wait to see what you guys bring our way. ????
Guess before watching Dora finally goes full crazy.
You're sending this series but not Ark? Man, Ark is so boring anymore compared to this.
Dude  literally our whole company chills out  In the squad Bay puts you up on our entire wall and watches you one episode after lunch.  We're always done early in the day anyways, If you guys succeed in your mission we leave without having a final formation.  However  With Simon we make a company bet on him falling down a hole And base it on heads or tails if we leave at 13:00 or 16:00. Simon please stop falling down holes. Love you buddy but dam look down more often. Not too much pressure. This is from my platoon sergeant NEEBS  Make a print out of  The map of whatever game you are playing You're like an LT You get lost easy thanks for the laughs just a helpful Tip.  Semper Fi
oh dora, form the police station to the death pit, you never seemed to considered that you dont know what you're doing.
Why didn't you guys visit all the old places like at the end of mine craft. Would made this video even better.
Was gonna call Simon stupid for saying he wanted to die with a lot of things. Then I realised that that's what we are doing in real life as well.
They got doraded.
This was the all time best episode, with the all time best defense strat, with zero flaws in its design. It was all user error which caused the so called “failure” #Dora for president
Hahaha
NOOOOOO NOT THE FINALLEEEEEEE IM SAD
Finally! Finally they used the Seven Days to Die song in a 7 Days to Die episode. They just had to wait for the finale, lol. xD \n\nBtw, who didn't saw this coming? People have been warning them way back the first horde night that zombies can and will dig regardless and Doraleous insist on building bases underground. xD So when is the next season going to start? I hope it won't be until Aplha17 comes.\r Damn, Doraleous parctically ended the series with that horde night. Lmao.
WAIT YOU CAN'T END THE SERIES, THICK DORALEOUS HASN'T FOUND SARAH'S TREASURE!!!
Loved this series , been so funny to watch I hope you do season 2 !
Back to it some day?! You fucking fucks better start playing this shit at the start of next year. Don't know what I'm going to do Friday now, it's not like I get out of the house and have a life or something, who needs a wife when Neebs and crew satisfy your needs.
Best episode by far!!!!  Gonna miss the series. GOOD JOB FELLAS!!!!!
I loved Dora's maniacal laughter as everyone is being slaughtered.
most entertaining 7 days to die video in the world! holy crap
Waiting now for a17?
You guys like it at 75? Jeez, I keep it at 68 degrees in my house. Great video, as always!
little sad about the last note saying might return to it someday, i hope you guys are planning to continue to do it :( also i noticed it was the dora scora not simon score
might have seven days to live,but I probably have 7 DAYS TO DIE.fantastic job guys
Bim bum bam, you keep being the best guys!\n\nFrom Italy with love, can't wait your next job!!
dora your hole would have worked to lure them if you placed a ladder to the surface in the hole you blew up to give them a path to follow, they had no path so the got stuck on the surface and dug down on top of you guys
It does say season finale not series finale, I dont think its over is it?
An absolute fantastic end to the season.
Man! Had such high hopes for this hoard night. WTF DORALINGUS!? Still was funny but.... End like that. t-.-t
This was an amazing series and I'm kinda sad to see it go but you guys ended it so great! Loved the song and death count at the end, it was a nice and funny touch
fire doesnt actually attract zombies
FUCKING GLORIOUS!!!!!
Best episode ever. I laughed So hard I nearly pissed myself. Great job Dora... \"I'll show them how to stay safe.\" Thanks for all wonderful hours of entertainment.
This series is great
2:24 duck duck goose!!!!!!\nAdahop > anphony
Doraleous you put your heart in that fort and the damn zombis trample all over it like if it were grass at a consert!
My expectations were so high.
Best series you have ever donw in my opinion, nothing but a great adventure with none stop laughter all the way. I hope you will continue this when alpha 17 drops. You're the best :)
Heat doesn't mean things burning - barrels, torches etc etc... It means any activity like a heatmap. You dig underground, running a forge, building a base, and all that will cause congo lines and screamers to spawn.
I have never laughed so hard and been so disappointed at the same time in my life!
This has to be one of the best most epic and funniest 7 Days to Die video you you guys have ever made!!! This episode was so freaking awesome and it was a proper season finale to the series! Hopefully we will return. Oh, that's 7 Days to Die song is now stuck in my head and it is awesome! ??I have 7 Days to Live but I probably have 7 Days to Die!!??
that intro had me like... oh... OH NO thick is gonna freak about the thermostat
So sad that this is the end of the journey, but what a way to go out.  Great Job Dora!!!
Fuckin epic!
Bra-fucking-vo!\nSo does this mean you guys are starting from scratch on a pristine new map? When?
I loved this episode. I was waiting for the day where you guys would all just keep dying on horde night haha 10/10 would watch again.
NOOOOOO   This series match perfect with the week every 7 days it's like waiting for f***** Saturday morning cartoon you look forward to it no no no  Dam it
Awesome tomb guys, cool song aswell.
Well done)
Loved, loved, LOVED this series.  Thank you guys so much for the wonderful entertainment.  I could not have thought of a more perfect way to end the series.  Looking forward to what's next.  #WorldPeace
So many great quotes from this series. Hats off neebs gaming
I have no words to express this video.
Fantastic, best hoard night ever!
Wait Wait WAIT!!! is this the las Ep.???????
Thank you Neebs Gaming for ending the 7 Days to Die series I hope you start a new 7 Days to Die series. Thank you and keep making new videos like my second favorite series Ark Survival Evolved.
Love that song
Easily the best episode ever.
how many times did they all die????? i know simon died the most lol
You guys have outdone it this time what an amazing episode massively enjoyed it well done
is this the end
I got a new server for u to try it is one of the most easy but hard severs I have been on it has all fiber craft no starve no thirst but u have to watch your surroundings the surver name is Fiber craft custom drops 7
You can see thick's face at the start of the video when he changes temperature.
Best end to a series ever.
How do you give this series a finally before ark
I also loved the music made is even funnier
sad to see it end, but hey, it was fun, thanks for all the laughs and all the good times from this amazing show.
Was anyone else thinking of Home Alone during the opening sequence? Thanks to the song.
I’ve never laughed so hard!
makes giant bunker fails to fix the 1 small hole that leads to failure...
think you guys are being to kind to Doraleous giving him a 1 at the end of that. worst and most prepared for horde night ever . How could he leave those holes open. Go sit in the corner Doraleous and think about what you've done.
Omg this was the funniest ep ever haha first no therapy then no school today now this best day ever i love you guys
BEST HORDE NIGHT EVER!!
My 2 favorite series have died in less then a month. I will miss 7dtd and raft....
OMG I don't think I have laughed this hard in along long time. Awesome job all!! \n\nSpecial note,  I love the sounds you all make when you die! Lol
The Death Star all over again...On the surface, a force to be reckoned with, yet built with one simple flaw that brought the entire thing down in a blaze of glory. Great video!
What A Into To The Video Loved It. Love watching you guys. you guys are hilarious.
Poor Simon doesn't have a fucking clue what's going on its hilarious ??....??
I saw this coming MILES AWAY
Started watching the series from the first episode and now to look back at it you guys made a fantastic series guys.
That was beautiful! I think I might just watch it two more times just to really let it all “sink in”. You guys are the absolute best.
best one ever loved it laughed so hard thanks ya'll
Series Finale gives me hope that there will be more after the update since it isn't titled Series Finale.. If this really is the end of a series I am excited to see what is next!!
I love you guys. Seriously, nothing more enjoyable than watching what you’ve created. I’ve said it many times, I don’t watch tv anymore. I rewatch old anime, i keep up with Always Sunny in Philadelphia, watch you guys and game. Besides work and a social life, y’all make up a big part of my routines!
I'm saddened to hear that the series is over considering you can do unlimited nights but I understand that there's other games that need to be play and there's other projects that need to be focused on. If you guys need the end it you ended on a really really good note. I wish I could see what the final score was but I'm happy you put the death toll towards the end. thank you for bringing the series to life thank you for your friendships and sharing your adventures with us 7 days was a really great series and hopefully in the future if you guys are still doing this maybe you could bring it back on the night that you're on and keep it on the level you're at as well as everything else. You guys are true Warriors so it should be set on that difficulty at all times if an when you get back into the game and keep it as that many zombies that looked very interesting but it also look like it was dropping your frames and whatnot. I'm really sorry your Hunker bunker didn't turn out the way you wanted it doraleous it looks like it took a long time to make and it looked like it was inpenetrable. Rest in peace Journeys End rest in peace 7 days, for now hopefully, to be honest I was actually expecting the building to fall apart but this episode exceeded my expectations. On a top note, I could not stop laughing as soon as the music came on for all the deaths my sides are still killing me XD I guess I'm having the same feeling as like having the same feeling I had for their one-day of Ark Aberration. I would love to see them continue the Arts Series going step by step especially with Extinction going to be released but that's probably why they also did the one day there. maybe once they're done with Ragnarok they will be done with Ark in general who knows but I highly doubt it I believe the next season if you want to call it that of Ark since they only did the one day of Ark aberration it's going to take place in extinction but that's not my place to call or say that's up to Neebs Gaming to decide. Who knows maybe we might get some more time in the raft videos now that they're done with one project and a new door has open. Sad to see 7 Days Go I'm pretty sure we got to see neebs thick doraleous build their bunkers and everything for horde night and I was looking forward to seeing Simon and Appsro building forts of Their Own but as I said before and as I said again if this was the season finale this was one way of ending it as well as ending it on a high note with so Much Death Carnage explosions suicides by traps this is definitely needs gaming material here material that's going to last for so long and material that's going to keep us laughing and coming back for more. Keep making great series guys keep making us laugh keep gaming and you will always have our hearts no matter what :)
Ok guys, I don't want to be the demanding kind of fan but you just told me you're stopping my favorite show for a while SO YOU GUYS BETTER BE WORKING ON SOMETHING GOOD!!! ??(`?´)??
So sad and so hilarious
So when Adahop asked what we think Dora was doing in his room did anyone guess elaborate trap to turn his friends into zombie food? Those must've been the happiest zombies..
Best 7 Days to Die episode ever
I was so sad to see that this was the series finale. But what a finale it was.  Thank you guys for all the laughter.  \n\nTo my grand kids , here is the proof that I knew about Neebs Gaming. When they were just a Youtube channel.
I've never laughed so much for a video before. Best finale ever. thanks Ada and neebs crew
Great episode!!! Your downfall was because the 7 Days pathing leads the zombies to you in a straight line, so they detected you through the ground above you and... well... best-laid plans of mice and men...
August 19th is my birthday!!
Best hord night ever :) thanks for this!
Dang, that one fat zombie got lit up
It was beautifully done, the music, the collage, the cartoons, and the epic wipe out of you all. \nI must ask, are you just bringing up hope or will there be a zomb squad, like mob squad but for 7 days to die? Like seven 24 hrs worth of cartoons of you guys?
Is neebs gaming stoping the series ?
great video guys really had a laugh watching this, Dora you did a great job fucking this up, I loved it. Who got more kills? the team vs zombies or Simon vs himself
That intro tho\nNoice
So umm overall a total success eh bois?
Well done. I can't wait for the redemption base.
Great episode.Waiting for more or maybe on next A17/18?
great vid guys
Best series ever done by the Crew :)
lol
Y’all should play star bound. It’s a well put together survival game that takes place in space.
That was so fucking funny i laughed the whole way through the video
He should have built the base under the house it would have worked
My favourite series from you guys. I will miss the laughter and the slaughter!
That was the most spectacular failure I've ever seen. Bravo, Doraleous, bravo.
Why would you blow a hole to start with?
Don’t quiiiiiiit!!!!!!!
does this mean no more 7 days to die
This episode was hilarious....Thank you Guys !!!  Always makes my day better !!!
More classical music in all videos please and thank you. Classes up the place
Fantastic job as always guys. Dora, I expected this night to go really smoothly, and I'm really disappointed in you. Love you all.
This series has been very fun to watch. This might have been my favorite episode of all (maybe). You guys are great!
noooooo it cant be over!
Appsro Im just putting this out there but was wondering if you have taken a look at Breaths Edge on steam. Its suppose to be a Space style Subnautica. just thought you may want to take a look into it.
Does anybody know how to download their map I think I saw it briefly at the end of this episode but it moved kind of fast
This was an amazing way to end the \"season\" of 7 days! Adahop, sir, you have done one hell of a job with everything you did for this series. It is by far one of my favorite series and I am sure I will watch it countless more times! thanks guys for the laughs. Hope to see something soon to replace this on the weekend lineup!
They got Doraled
Awesome awesome awesome series guys THANK YOU!! Thoroughly enjoyed watching on a friday night and hope you giys do revisit soon, but for now its obviously time for a change of scenery and something new for a friday night, whatever it is im sure you guys will make it epic, as always, well, im gonna go find the playlist amd go watch em all again ?? been an experience guys, and again, thank you ??
what an explosive episode
I’m gonna miss this... love the opening scene tho! You guys are great, this series has always been one of my favorites
You guys are trully awesome. Thank you so much for a trully awesome final episode of 7 days. my partner and I haven't laughed so much in ages xx
This was the funnyiest 7 days to die video ever
all of you including Simon have been promoted
Great way of ending the series, forward! on to the next death bunker. Just lets leave the mines.
Don’t feel bad Dora, you had a great idea. Unfortunately, video game logic. I’ll never stop loving you buddy!
Now that you guys onow alot more of what your doing amd need i think u should start a part two of series and start over i love watching these every week dont stop lol
This was the BEST Finale anywhere - even including TV finales!!!! And every few minutes hearing somebody exclaim \"Damn it Doralious!!!!!!\" as they are being decimated in the Dora-tomb land LOL. And can always have Asspro give a great one liner : Somebody has a rocket launcher.....Shoot Dora with it!!!!\" LMFAO
This was so entertaining it hurt
Someone THICKED the shit out of y'all LOL
best video eveeer
Aw man.  This series is ending?  \n\nI hope ya'll return to it at Alpha 17 when they get jeeps and such.\n\nThanks for the awesome show! I truly enjoyed it!
No
So no more 7 days huh?  I hope there's more!
the deaths are just so hahahaha
This episode was great guys thanks for the barrels of laughs and hope you guys had some fun.
So no more 7 days to die videos?
What an absolutely amazing failure guys! That was so much fun to watch
Best video I’ve ever seen love you guys your all the greatest YouTubers to ever live you all deserve more subs I can’t believe you guys aren’t the biggest channel on YouTube yet but I know you will get there. Keep up the great work
Best,episode,ever
Using the 1812 Overture in the last third of the video is fantastic, love you guys, can't think of a better ending!
<3
So this is the nightmare before christmas?
Figures i get into your 7 days playthrough right before the end of a season. Lol
Great job guys!!
You guys going to start a new season when the next 7d2d update comes out?
Tried warning them lol
Best episode!
Honestly, I love everything you guys put out, but that is the hardest I have ever laughed at a YouTube video. Absolutely loved the death screens/1812 cannons part.\nY'all did an amazing job on this one. Thank you :)
Best video on YouTube by far
That was so epic! I can't think of any other content maker who's more suitable to play this game than you guys. I'm still laughing just thinking of this episode. You are truly masters of the art.
Well, thanks guys.  I came for the underwater shennanigans of Subnautica and stayed for 7 Days.  Now you're done, I guess I am too.  Quite a bit too old for all your other stuff, but I've had a blast.  So thanks for all the laughs and have fun with whatever else you do.
I can't wait to see Simon preparing you guys for the horde night
OMG people, that was EPIC! It makes Odysseus look tame.
Liked before opening title.. this is gonna be goooooddd
The editing coupled with the 1812 Overture, was a stroke of genius!   Great job guys!!!!
Please continue with a17, you have to come back to it please please please please please please please ??
Is it just me or did this all seem like a bigger more hilarious version of Simon's glass house?\n\n\n\n\nAnd to think I had faith in you Dora! xD
The 1812 Overture was perfect. Good job as usual Anthony.
I have no idea why but when Adahop turned down the heat, that shit was beyond funny. Adahop is like my mom!!!!! Always setting the temperature to freezing. Who knew all this time that she was protecting us from creating too much heat on horde nights.
Press F to pay Respects.
This episode was absolute perfection on all levels!
That was awesome guys..Thank you so much for all the good times and making  me laugh at work..8-)
Doraleous is no longer in charge of prepping for horde nights
You guys should definitely make that outro song into a full song
Best one yet
This episode needs every award that exists and another twenty that doesn't exist yet!
More please I haven't laffd so much in a long time
First episode I thought I was going to hate this series because of how wonky and ugly it was but It ended up being one of my favorite series to watch and i think its because of the chemistry you guys have together that makes every episode a great time and the creativity you guys bring is just fucking awesome . Crazy doraleous was my favorite and especially the silly name changes like dorito and knees. Love you guys and keep up the great work!!!
BFF was one of the funniest series you guys have done but... as far as all out entertainment, 7D2D has held my attention, always looking forward to friday! The editing gets better every episode and even though you've created a  base in every biome I could probably watch you guys play this game for another year! It's been inching up as my favorite series and I gotta say I think this episode tipped the scales. BEST EVER. Sad to see ya'll take a break from it. PLEASE! Come back to it when Alpha 17 releases!!! Now... who's gonna start this series over from the beginning?... again lol follow me!!!
That's like if snafu and klusterfuk had a baby
This was so sad. It's like your favorite heroes getting their asses kicked over and over. 10/10 guys.
So to be clear, Doraleous change the game settings at the beginning ?
Wtf is DuckDuckGoose
Simon is the best :)
Simon needs a fucking brain not his stuff most of his deaths was from stupidity
::stands and gives a slow clap ovation::
I love it when everything seems secure......and then goes to shit in a big way! A la Doraleous ignoring the glaring hole right above your heads! Classic! 10 outta 10, 2 thumbs up and so forth! ??
Watching this at 5 am makes it 5x funnier, Simon being Simon, the constant GAAAGGHHH and screams in the distance, by far my favourite 7days video
Honestly the best way to end the season.  I loved the death count.  Doraleous, you ignorant slut, I had so much hope for your bunker.  Ella Marie looks down in disappointment.
One of your best episodes of all your series hands down, including Subnatica. Very well done in all aspects sans reinforcing the roof lol
I haven't laughed this hard to tears in a while LOL Simon and Appsro have the most comical death screams. I really thought this would be their easiest horde night yet somehow you guys always seem to know how to subvert all of our expectations.
Dora for PREZZZZZ
called it!!! i knew it was the end!!!
I'm gonna miss this series. You guys made a fantastic series with an awesome finale. Thanks you for the hours of laughter
Masterfully done and a fitting end to a magnificent series. Thank you.
This show has been fantastic guys. Its brought many laughs to the end of a stressful work week and I appreciate all that you do. I'm sad to see it go, but excited to see what else you guys come up with! Keep on keepin' on.
Fuck Thick\nFuck Appsro\nFuck Simon\nAnd Fuck Neebs (and Ada but hes not important) \nDoralious has been the best of all these past few moths. Seriously it's like he planned this to fail as revenge for all the times his builds get ripped on sense you guys do t kill each other as often as you should. Live you Dora.
Season 2 coming soon
Well if you've gotta go you may as well go with a bang haha, brilliant :)
Great video ??????
Just had surgery and this literally hurts because of how much I’m laughing!
I hope this isn't actually the end of 7 days. This is something I didn't think I'd ever enjoy watching but my God every upload I've watched the day it's gone up. I love this series so fucking much.
Great job guys
no more 7 days? :'(
august 19th is my birthay
Since when do zombies die on wood spikes under warrior difficulty?
You're abandoning 7 days to die? Well aint that some bullshit?!
Please for the love of god, do this series again soon! It was great!!
Is this the last 7 Days to Die or will there be a new season when the new update come out, either way we've still got Ark their best series.
Worst day in the game for you guys and the best day on YouTube for me. Well done guys on creating such a entertaining and enjoyable series, you guys deserve a lot more credit and subscribers then you already have, So thank you Neebs and Crew????????
awesome music during the horde,reminded me of john petrucci's solo album
It saddens me to see the series end for now. But this series provided me tons of laughter and this will forever be one of my favorite series by you guys. Thank you so much for the time and effort you guys put into this for our entertainment.  Love you guys stay safe~?
Hurricane in real life is immediately followed by a hurricane of zombies and death in the game.
No season Final
Is this the end of 7 days forever
Everyone watch your step! Simon what are you doing out here! Oh hey thick... lol and on that day no cares were given to Thicks safety
That was effing amazing. The deaths syncopated with the music...
The greatest gaming channel ever
You guys are the best, I watched this three times and still laughed just as hard as the first. That song at the end too, glad you used it, love it and found it to be very fitting. Seriously, awesome work you guys - THANK YOU for all that you do! Much love to you all. <3
That was great guys. I've been playing this with my wife for over a year migrating from PS4 to PC. We got bored at our main base and had pretty much the same thing happen a few weeks ago at an improvised base. Hope you come back for alpha 17 since it looks like a lot of new content. I'm sure Simon will be able to fly a helicopter better on here that on GTA5, what could go wrong?
Love this series, please bring it back one day ????????????
I'm so god damn sad this series is over but I'm so god damn glad this is how it did.
Hope you guys do a season 2 on a random generated map! Be fun you see you guys explore the unknown!
I'm a bus driver... I should not watch this in mine breaks...  People asked me why I cried...
That was was the best. My eyes are still watering.
HOW BEAUTIFUL, I LOVE YOU GUYS ???
HAHAHAHA!!!  I just don't understand how you can be this bad after playing for so long. I love how awful you all are. Thanks fellas!!!!!!!
Love the content and thank you for an amazing ride along with you fellas. Went from Mexico Fort to Death Hole! And you all didn’t learn a thing lol
I want to see Simon make the fortifications for the next horde night please make it happen!
Please don't end seven days. You guys should start a new game on random gen.  I wouldn't even mind if you gave yourself a minibike to start with. Just sayin
Time to start Fallout 76!!!
Nooooooo don’t leave. Love these episodes will 100%watch it from the start about like 3 more times and Apstro will u tell thick fuck u it’s so funny
Man, I got kind of emotional over this! I remember the night i was lying in bed, and watched the very first episode the day it came out. I love this series! Thanks guys for always making the best gaming content on YouTube! You guys are awesome!
HAHAHA! I love you, Adahop!! Great editing and nice ownage. I haven't laughed this much in a while.
Just imagine what the next season finale will be like
Dope
Best episode yet...don't worry Simon i'm right there with you on the death count cause I seem to suck at living in 7d2d also...but on also, is this gonna be the last of the 7 days episodes??? :(  if so
This has to be the best 7 days video ya'll have.
sweet Jesus on rye this is the best thing I've seen this week
WOW my sides hurt from laughing so hard yet again guys. sad to see 7 days go. hope it comes back some day. great work all of you.
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader...\"
Simon was determined to trip every mine in the death hole.
Loved this series, my mom and me watch it together.  It’s the only video game she will play and she is always making me play with her lol. Ur guys videos have helped her and me through job changes, family health issues, and much more. Love u guys and keep up the amazing videos.
FUCKING EPIC!
DONT STOP PLAYING PLEASE
What’s the music you used at the end? Epic!
The safety of the base Doralious built is equivalent to a death star
Best episode ever. Fucking love you guys.
So we learned Simon is very determined. Thick isn't as good as he says. Appsro is the best gamer out of them. Neebs is a lucky guy. And Deraleous is the laziest horde night defence designer. But man do I love them all. Great stuff guys.
When they eventually come back to this, I hope they let Simon create his own horde night place lol
Lols, best failed base ever.
Reading the comments before watching the video (shame on me, i know), i learned that it would fail, and was actually really sad. I went into the video expecting to leave it with a bad taste in my mouth (shame on me, i know), because I felt so bad for Doraleous. But the way you guys reacted to everything going wrong made me enjoy the video even more than I probably would have had it succeeded. Congratulations on being able to laugh uncontrollably at your complete and utter failure, and allowing others to as well :-)
god damnit dorarara
Noooo it cant be the end
Nice going doraleous you've made the safest tomb in exsistance but to be fair i could have made anything near as awesome looking also is that it for 7 days?
7 dAYS TO DIE IS MY 2 FAV GAME YALL PLAY.. MY FIRST IS ARK SINCE IM A BIG ARK NERD...BUT I LOVE YALL VIDEOS.. I BEEN A SUBSCRIBED TO YALL SIINCE YALL HAD 23K SUBS
The blue spirits when they died had me in stitches
I really wanted this to work, Doraleous
That was by far, the most brilliant and sophisticated way to lure your best friends into a death trap to mauled by a zombie horde. Tip of the cap Doraleus!
OMG Best episode ever! laughed my floppy tits off!
So now are you guys taking a vacation to the Hilton for the toothpaste convention?
\"Appsro bringin the heeeaaat!!\" -Neebs\n*cricket noise* \nI'm dying right now... ??????
Best episode ever !!!!!
Dor: I just saved Simon\nSimon: Why?\nlarf
7 days to die has been my favorite neebs gaming series so far.
What a finale, almost shit myself laughing towards the end. Bravo chaps. Look forward to your next series
Well... What can I say !??. That was   with out a doubt just Epic. ?? You guys really put me in a good mood . Please never stop and always be friends.
Thank you guys for this series. It was fantastic. Do you guys think you'll ever do a short series of The Forest? You guys would love it.
Beauty of an episode! Would have been one boring night of standing around for you guys, if Doraleus didn't F up with the cave in while building the thing :D
That was fubar haha
That was the most successfully spectacular failure I have ever seen. Best episode ever.
SIMON HAD ME DYING IN THIS EPISODE
I feel bad for Dora, all that work went to shit because he didn't feel like making the \"safe\" room a reinforced metal box and fill up a hole over it.
LOL, doraleous score! lol, im ded
Love you neebs gaming. You guys keep up the good work and awesome content. I live in Indiana and my buddy showed me your channel one day and I’ve loved it ever since. He has since moved to Minnesota about 11 hours away from me but we still keep in contact and talk about you guys constantly. Give a shout out to Justin Dickey for me on the next commenting on comments please!  (ThAts his real name)
Doraleous secretly works for whatever corporation is making the zombies. The whole series he's always been different, remember the sniper rifle scope moments? And now he showed some enthusiasm about making  a horde night place and it turned out to be a death trap for all of them. And he's been laughing maniacally the whole time.
I have been watching religiously for 2 years now, and this is by far the best video you guys have ever made
You guys have a direct line to my funny bone because damn this shit show of a horde night has been the best these have ever been!! Thank you all so much!! And Adahop you chinky bastard way to crank that challenge bar to fucking Warrior!!!!
I'm sorry to see this series end, but what an ending! Perfect! LOL
good stuff fellas . i hope we see more after the update
\"Is that the 1812 Over-... oh god...\"\n\n\nThank you guys for making this amazing series. ^_^
Sad that this series has met its end, but what better way to end it with this episode. A killfest. Of both zombies and Simon's. \n\n\nAlsowheresthesimonscor-
OMG!...OMG!...OMG!   :D    Best Youtube video of all time!!!!  I was laughing and giggling so much!!!
Best episode ever
What a weak ending. You guys built this series for like a year! And you end it with a shitty title screen at the end saying blah blah blah we MIGHT return to your second best series. This game is more than horde nights. Do a random gen map. Mess with the settings a bit. But to dump it so suddenly is a slap in the face to everyone.
Omg lmao u guys! Great job!
Isn't it weird how we show our love for this group of people simply by watching ads and clicking a button...
what's next?
Nice intro
What a great and hilarious video! Sad to see this series ending as i enjoyed it so much, but you cannot do a single game for years (except ark). It was a great run and i am looking forward for the replacing series
The series ended and we never saw a  \"doraleous castle\" being built.
100% will miss this series.
thank you for such a great series!!!
GLORIOUS! pretty cool of you to include the map. TY
Yep. Wile E. Coyote
I have to say, Neebs finally made me happy in this game. No poetry, no whining,  just pew pews and first fights with cheerleaders. Basic happiness.
You guys should encase yourselves in a giant metal box and place TNT all around it.
I NEED MY STUFF!
I love this  editing lmao
Simon's composure is non-existent.
Please don't end this series!! This was the best one yet. I'm going to start a monthly Patreon subscription for you all because I enjoy the 7D2D videos so much. Knowing there'll be a Friday video make the whole week off waiting with it. Keep up the great work guys. I'm a fan.
It was all becaue of one man
5:26 \"I'M  ABOUT TO BLOW THE TORCH\" ?????? Doraleous we all love you, ya cheeky get.
That was golrious ,...... LEVOLUTION !
Kinda like Fraggle Rock watching this. Fraggles trying to stop the Gorgs getting in.
Good concept idea by Dora, to try and get all the zombies to focus from one direction, too bad he missed one or two details that would've made it an easy night, the key mistake was building underground. Good series though, I just wish some of the mods were better optimized and didn't make the game run like potato for anyone without a high-end PC, as the Ravenhearst mod would be good for them otherwise.
Hands down your best video yet. Love you guys. Keep up the good work.
Amazing editing, loved it!
Get that cheerleader neebs
This episode was so chaotic. I love it.
How the tables have turned... Looks like the hole fell on simon. My favorite episode so far! You guys are too damn funny.
You guys are the best .I want to thank you all for making my day happier every time
Nice series guys. Good ending.
This was exactly what I needed to get through this 3 hour layover at this bus stop/gas station in the middle of Idaho. Sad to see this series go
Best horde night ever.
Simon: Shouldn't we be shooting. \n\nEveryone else: didn't hear him over their gun fire.
Jesus tap dancing Christ you would have thought with all the showboating, demanding, and acting all superior towards making them survive to end up with one flaw that he actually knew about 4 days prior?? ?????????? Please bring this series back so we can all hear the Dora roasting. Effed up idea but let Simon do the next hoard night with Neebs as an advisor
Wow, just wow. How did you not see that coming? Adahop you are a masterful editor though.
Ada, is that you on the reflection of the screen between the 0:10 and 0:12?
Love the death voices! That was funny af!!!
Loved this series and hope to see it return one day. It provided many laughs and good times. Thank you neebs and crew for the great entertainment and hours of hilarious misadventures love the channel. WORLD PEACE??
@21:53 Neebs ~ “I’m fighting a cheerleader, yeah!” ??????????
uh is this the end of the first season of 7 days to die
Hey neebs can y’all do a Red Dead Redemption 2 series like your gta5 stuff
This is how things go in real life, someone drops the ball in some really really mundane task... like... leaving the rock in front of the door.  Or... drinking 2 cups of coffee every morning when their ration is one leaving less coffee.  Or not cementing or resodding open half blocks. Well... and know you know!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD6qtc2_AQA
best episode ever, was too good.  you cant give this series up we love it
Awesome hilarious final episode. Love it!
This went worse than I was expecting somehow.
and everyone thought it was thick 44 who got kills
Season finale?
This is EXACTLY why Dora should be President of NEEBS GAMING!!! He made something beautiful but at the same time fucked up massively. Excellent episode, fantastic editing and a fitting way to finish the series. Can’t wait to see what you have planned for the future!! ????????????
Season 2? Please
Lols, simon is like an egyptian pharaoh. \"I like to die with a lot of things.\"
Been here since the Birth of this beautiful Season and I am sad to see it go but I have a feeling something really cool will be replacing in somewhat soon and I can't wait....   To Adahop Good Job Editing this shitfest I loved it Thank you sir..   To the bag of dicks we know as Dora YOU HAD ONE FECKING JOB Love Ya..    To the beautiful bitches Neebs and Appsro You provided so many funny moments and made this Game fun to watch Thank you my FAV Neebs Gaming People.. To Simon Get Good.. To Thick You Did your best and we thank you...          To this Season you will be hard to replace and hopefully In the future we will see you again.
Thank you guys so much for this amazing series, I've enjoyed every single second of it, and I will watch it again as a whole soon! I'm curious what game will replace this gem! Again, thank you
So what's next?
I think Simon has the best dying noise out of anyone
Thick44 eliminated Thick44\nHe gets kills
I heard that Neebs, you bout said meschatic i stead of Schematic! Hahha long live our dyslexia but also nice save ;)
Season finale ?? noooooooooo
Brilliant series guys, well done! Sad to see it go but glad I was here for the ride
Wow! I could not stop laughing! This was an amazing episode!!!
Holy hell fanfreakingtastic guys
This was by far the best episode you guys  done in days lol I could not stop laughing you guys are comic geniuses! Thanks for the great laughs.
That was one of the best ones. Great job guys
All I have is WOWWW, that was awesome!! :D
Simon is reenacting the million ways to die in the west.
Wait so is this the end of 7 days
Season finale? When does the next season begin?
Just a beautifully orchestrated  cluster fuck. A symphony of asses and elbows.
Its funny because you guys completely suck at the game regardless lol
neeb  gaming    team     change  Diffculty  settings warrior    64 Enemies        cheat          not happy  next    ark  survival  evolved   ?
Senseless SIMON...FUNNIEST FUCKING HORD NIGHT EVER.. NOT SEASON FINALE...FUCK THAT 6.5 DAYS TILL NEXT ONE..SOMEONE GET TO WORK.. I KNOW THAT IT WAS ADAHOP OR DORALOUS DUMB ASS WHO FUCK UP THE SETTINGS...BAWH HAHAHAH
Is there no more 7days ???
The editing is great sirs,better every ep.??????
No plan survives first contact with the enemy.
A great way to end it. I loved this series and will love it if it eventually returns. But till then I can’t wait to see what is next on the list for you guys.
Best hoard night ever!!!  Seriously could not stop laughing. Just wondering, did Simon died more from self inflicted or combat injuries?
Best Horde Night Ever!!!
?????? Best episode to date! Laughed so hard I started crying!
Wait?  So no more 7 days? : (
I loved the idea but did anyone else know the underground bunker was gonna end poorly?
That 1812 overture edit at the end was amazing.
comedy gold! ty for the entertainment
HAHAHA Dora's score should be -100 for building that death chamber. Awesome deaths guys. I couldn't stop laughing =D
\"I need my stuff!\" STOP RUNNING THROUGH THE BLADES! -Proceeds to run through the blades several more times
That was absolutely the funniest episode I've ever watched
I'm glad Simon finally got his torch!!
\"But I like to die with a lot of things...\" Awesome episode guys
that was the best worst plan that turned out better than anyone expected it too.
Sad to see this series go but at least it went with a bang
Congratulations on your 1,000,000
Masterpiece!!!
Jesus....
Yay!! A new 7 days video!! It’s the life blood that fuels ‘Merica!!!
Doraleous, you suck lmao
Just a tip:  Gather sand and rocks,  research cement making.  That plan would have gone off without a hitch with a quad pass choke point above the room.  To create this make a hole down.  On 4 sides create cement paths that are 3 blocks high, 2 blocks wide, 7 blocks long.  Have a space of  2 blocks open so zombies etc can go through 1 at a time.  Each block if I recall has 5k health and can withstand 3 explosions from the exploding police.   One thing you can do is modify this using blade traps to slow runners.   Mines around dirt etc is bad because it creates instability in your structure.  However,  if you have steel upgrades researched,  you can dig up 2 blocks deep,  replace ground with cement that upgrades to concrete that upgrades to steel which has 9k health and takes -25% reduced explosion damage.   Place mines at 4 block intervals and woila...you can sleep safely.  Keep in mind though, zombies during horde night Always target players no matter what you do.   So this trap idea is intended to be doje on all 4 sides of your location.  I hope this helps.
Loved the intro guys. I hope y'all do come back with more 7 days to die vids. As I said to Thick44 once \"I love everything you guys do and thank you for making my day several times a week.\" Music, vids, animated shorts YOU GUYS ROCK! Kisses
What does Thick44 and Jonny Sins have in common?.....Being bold and being a gamer...love you guys see you in Commenting on comments
Goodbye to one of my favorite series I’m gonna watch the whole season from start to finish right now just so I never forget and if it ever comes back I will watch it without fail! I love you guys in the respectful fan way !
Did anyone else pause it to try and see the face in the thermostat?
Empyrion next?
I will probably buy this game this week thanks to you guys
Easily my favorite series! Sad to see it go but hopefully it will be back soon! Also that was one of the best episodes of 7 days to die! Maybe always do the outtro of your song?
The ending is absolutely towards the end when you guys all just die it’s just priceless
It was a great series!
NOOOO DONT LET THIS SERIES END!!!
God dammit Dora You should have built the safe zone on the other side of the bunker then you should’ve blown up a big hole in front of the cabin and also she could’ve this goddamn holy fucki you should have built the safe zone on the other side of the bunker then you should’ve blown up a big hole in front of the cabin and also should have covered up those holes,You’re freaking lazy
OMG the begining
So what if you dig a cave that's square our octagonal with open sides going up to the surface with a square base like the one doraleous made and also possibly have some sort of sniper tower in the center. Thanks you guys see great
Such a great series and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed binging it (several times)! Thanks guys, for all the work you put into your channel
Shit finale? Cmon
Loved this series!!!
Followed this series from day 1. Don't normally like zombie games but as usual you guys make it a must watch. Will never forget when Simon fought off all those military zombies in that army base all on his own.
You should burn Doraleous on a wooden stake like in the Salem witch trials
It's Aliens, when they're waiting un the big hall and the Aliens come from the ceiling
This was epic!
I didn't think anything could top the bulletproof glass horde night plan, but this went several times worse than that. Made for one hilarious finale, and the death montage was perfect for this episode. Bummed the series is taking a break, as this is honestly my favorite show on the channel, but I suppose that'll make me all the happier when it returns. Can't complain about Frighty Night and whatever else is coming.\n\nAlso, I remember I wasn't too hot on Thick's 7 Days metal song, but after what happened in the episode and it being the season finale, it actually worked really well as a closer.
Absolutely flawless
IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful gents
It takes a hell of a lot of work to look this inept....thanks for the laughs.
talk about an epic finale
Epic
When the series first released, I was skeptical, but after watching the first few episodes, I realized you guys just shit out gold with everything you do.  Great run, hope future content will allow you guys to return to this. Appsro 4 president
11:32 Thick44 doesn't get kills, Adahop gets kills!
OKAY MAYBE NOT DORALEOUS FOR PRESIDENT
So many deads caused by Doraleous's hole.
Hell of an ending. Better that Lost
That was fan-f*cking-tastic.  I don't think I have laughed so much during one of your guys' videos as I did during the \"1812 Overture-Death-Montage\".  Well done.  Well, on the entertainment aspect.  Dora, an engineer you are not.  Don't quit your day job buddy. ;)
what song is played in the end?
This is a bittersweet moment for me. I’ve loved watching you guys play this game, but I guess it’s time to move on. I know we’re going to see some awesome things from Ark: Extinction and hopefully, Red Dead Redemption 2.
PLEASE DON'T BE THE END!!! Seriously yalls 7DTD series is my absolute FAVORITE thing to watch on... Hell, it's my favorite source of entertainment! I mean if yall need a break for a little bit you could always go back to Empyrion =) or something of that nature
Back when the first Neeb's episode of 7 days to die came out I loved the video series so much I immediately ran out and bought a copy of this game.  The makers of this game should sponsor Neeb's Gaming for that very reason.  Anyways, amazing video series but then again any game you guys play turns to gold.
Trying so hard not to laugh out loud at work. I am sad that it’s done.
What a stupid game...zombies home in on them from above and start tunnelling straight down? Motherfucker’s have ESP or what?
i hope they bring it back with a random Gen Map.\nThis was my 2nd favorite series, keep up with the amazing work.
So Thick'd is when you screw up, and Dora'd is when you FUCK up
I wished for the other series to be picked, but I was glad that 7 days to die was picked. I hope you guys do the other choices that was selected. I wish you guys re visit Minecraft
mistakes were made, MANY MANY HILARIOUS MISTAKES ??????????
Yalls' best video ever by far!!
I’m really gonna miss this series! I still remember yalls first horse night at the prison and how amazing it was! And then how y’all made numerous bunkers within mountains or caves, not to mention the Mexican fort or the desert fort! I really hope y’all decide to do more of this series!
5:52 Did that explosion just uncovered a treasure chest?
NOOOOOO ITS OVEER!!!! NOOOOOOOOO *world population drops down to 0.1 *
1812 overture at the end, excellent
On horde night i should go underground
I honestly wasn't ready for this series to end.... Sad day. Question.  Will you guys be doing a Fallout 76 series or at least an episode? Please discuss on C.o.C. Thanks you guys are Awesome!
That. Was. Amazing!
The zombies had a better plan.
horde horde Horde HOrde HORde HORDe HORDE HORRDDEEE!
I kinda want this game, but it seems that a lot of people dislike it and so do some of the crew. Can someone tell me if it's worth it?
Poor simon... LMAO
Thick went out like John Wayne, taking a few of them down with him with that rocket blast. Slow salute to you sir. You and your squad will be remembered.
Jesus Christ simon you really are something else my man
Bro soda came out my nose
THIS. WAS. HILARIOUS
So sorry to see this series end. I loved it!  This episode was by far your best. Hope you do more seven days to die very soon.
Im so gutted its over, hope its only just for now!
That was a rough follow up from the scrap mechanic battleships episode Dora
I hope you will come back after  new updates  they doing  lots of news coming up
Fantastic series guys, I love the way the audio gets edited in every video! Can't wait to see what you guys come out with next!!
You guys once was at a place that had automatic rifle turrets. Why not just go inside there on hord night?
Hahahahahahhahaah. Epic failure.
For who ever edit this and may conserved, I’m sorry you had to edit that ether you hate you life with all the deaths or couldn’t stop laughing but in the end I thank you. P.S. Simeon you used more of the traps than the zombies ran into
As man I was really hoping for his bunker to work. It would have been awesome!
Great episode makes me sad it's the last episode... hopefully whatever u replace it with makes me super excited for Friday vids.. because Fridays were great bc u guys do such a great job with this game...so sad to see it go....
This is amazing work guys! Best 7 days video by far. Thank you so much for creating something that everyone loved. This was a great series and probably the highlight of my Fridays! I’m sure going to miss this series, but I’m sure you have something amazing to replace it! Love you guys, cheers!
Season 2
rofl literally cannot breathe.... yall r awesome hahaha that was great tyvm all of you
Simon says: \"Eh deh deh hee wah deh gah dah geh. dah.Urk.\"  And I quote.  LOL>. Solid finale guys, you really some fun ass dudes.  Keep it coming, and can't wait to see what comes next.
May I quote dora on this one \"this will be the easiest horde night so far.... or I'm building our grave\"
Bravo..... bravo!!!!!! I laughed so hard at this. You guys are awesome. Yet another great video
Freaking loved EVERY minute of it. At first I was thinking to myself ' How is Simon still alive and everyone else died...' then once he died I was like 'there we go' which made me chuckle at the thought of it until I saw thick hadn't died yet either.. Thank you Ada and the Neebs crew for making me laugh till I cough and cry. I will most definitely miss this series next week.
Quite possibly the most epic video you guys have done!
Not sure if you guys heard about telltale games closing.....I believe the new walking dead they are doing will be there last production. Not sure were that leaves 7 days to die but probably not in a good spot ??
Now you guys can fill the hole with water and have an in-ground pool....
I hope y'all make a second season love watching y'all
Ada amazing cold open but I am a lil disappointed you didnt do a panning opening shot with the drone . Great stuff man !!!
WAIT IS 7 DAYS OVER
Nice try Dora
So this is it?
Take a lesson, Dexter, this is how you properly end a season.
Who is the genius that decided building a death hole was a great idea. Oh wait y'all been thicked by fukn Dora!! Lmfao. Great series hope revisit some day or highlights of failures and accomplishments.
Really enjoyed this series, guys. Thanks for all the laughs!
Wonder whats next for Friday series.
What a hilarious shit-show.
Am lost for words, what I just seen
5 seconds to die
Murphy's Law at its finest!  ??
Hey idiots. SEASON FINALE\n\n\nThe show isnt over. Stfu!
Delorean Score
This isn’t the end of a series right
:/ I hate when a series ends. Neebs nooo this Minecraft and gta have been my favorite series other then doraleous and associates.
Lol... I so called it last video.
14:30 -  \"FUCK  YOU  DOLARIUS\"  -  I burst  out  laughing.\nDOLARIUS ... YOU  GET  A  1  out  of  10.\nYou  get  a  1  for  Effort.   I would  have  given  you  a  4,  but  you  tried  to  cover  up  your  blunder.  The  hilarious  cursing  was  inevitable  -  lol
Awesome way to end the series! GREAT adventure start to finish....... That's said I think it's time to MAHA!!!\n\nMAKE ANOTHER HYPERION ADVENTURE!
I love using gas barrels to make an underground mine.
Thank you guts for an awesome series!
the zombies take the shortest path to the heat.
Never end this channel even when you are all in your 90s get together and keep this channel going
SIMONS SANDWICH COOKING SHOW!!!
Man, my heart sank a bit when I read the final message.  I was introduced to Neebs through the 7DTD developer diary back in February and became a HUGE fan... Helped me through some of the worst months of my life (3rd immediate family member passed away within a 6 year period). Ark, GTA5, Subnautica, Neebsilvania, Toonstone, live streams on Thursdays... Now the thing that brought me to Neebs Gaming has come to an end sniffles - It's all good, can't wait until the next venture!  You guys have a special talent and are great!!  A serious, THANK YOU for what you bring to your fans.  World Peace and kisses!
Hey is the map you guys have on google docs updated? \nplease let me know on commenting on comments it would make my month :D
This channel deserves so many more subscribers the amount of effort and how much they care for each video they put out should be getting millions of views each one
This might be my favorite 7 days video y’all have ever made
Thank god you are finally quitting this fucking game!  Please move on to conan exiles or something else... anything else.. thanks :)
Can’t wait for another season with a new map! This was my favorite series in a while now
I love the vigorous fingering of the thermostat ??
Favorite episode yet! Amazing editing job ada!
This was the best horde night by far.. From the intro to the ending credits. To the bad ass 7 days to die song.. Love you guys.. The best yt entertainment..
Are you guys going to play MOD War Of The W 5.3        7 days die????????
Thank you all for your hard work. You went out strong, very funny episode!
out.... fucking.... standing.
Such a beautiful mess of a bunker that committed both big bunker sins. 1)don't assume earth will protect you in place of concrete/steel. and 2) zombies will go above where you are so you need to have the hole real close to where you're hiding. Excellent job all hope to see you back in this shitstorm eventually
another big part of this game is being raped! on the pvp servers as a group of noobs, might be fun to see gang join a pvp server.
Dora might have messed this up, but remember that time he built battleship in scrap ??
I hate the series is over, but it was amazing to watch. Keep up the good work fellas and lets start to see more GTA V episodes again.
Brilliant!!!
Who knew this horde night can start so boring and end with a death comp, great job Dora it went exactly how I thought. Love ya'll
did you guys know ada was screwing you over?
Simon just stay at the spoon next time
That death montage though... omg the lols ... My cats are freaking out at how loud I'm being. Best 7 days yet GJ Dora
That intro was great.
So sad to see 7days end. Was absolutely brilliant! Thanks guys you bossed that game
On 2nd viewing you can see the holes while Dora is making his announcements.
Thicke needs more character development. He seems to disappear and is very forgettable. Are you guys able to mention this in further discussion on the next commenting on comments please?
Are you guys gonna live stream alpha 17?
Oh My God!!! This episode was AMAZING Holy Shit! Funniest thing I have ever seen!
Can't wait to see what new series takes the place
Doraleous the king of really good ideas executed half assed and the baron of the not testing his shit. I love you guys
Ok guys! Best episode yet! Loved it! Yall are awesome, but I also gotta give props to your editing master, well done sir!
?????? hilarious deathtrap
At first I wasn't into this series but not after a long time I got to love it. It's soo sad that it ended but non the less a great finale!\n\nPs: Please comeback to this game someday
So is this the end of 7 days for good? It definitely when out on a strong but disastrous note
You f*cked this up beautyfully! Fun to watch!
This.... this is great. As a member of the NYPD. This is literally the best thing I seen all day. Made this day the best. thank you so much for this.
You know guys, you could find someone who is actually competent to tell jokes if that's why you're keeping Simon around.
End of 7 days?!?!
15:20\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\n\n.. just another day on Neebs gaming
Please start the new season soon! Love you guys!
\"Fantastic failure\", thx for the laughs
Appsro bringing the HEEAAAT
I have to say this wos the most fannyes, best, survaiving episode of 7 days to day and the end with the song wos fantastik i fit the game perfectly.greate job gays
Does Simon think it's called \"bob wire\"?
What's the opposite of a fort again?.. hemmmm Dora.. humm  p.s I've never in any other video, laughed more than this one. And I've watched every single one I swear to God... every one 10/10
I am really gonna miss this series!! I loved watching you all argue and mess around. Every horde night is funnier than the last!! Love all the edits and find-adahops. Even funnier is simon trying to do simple things. Dora is the Brains that over does everything. Thick is just mr. Badass. Needs is trying to keep the culture alive with his poetry. And apstro is that one survivor guy that just knows how to work with what hes got. LOVE YOU GUYS
7 dies to die and ark are your best 2 playlists  please dont stop 7dtd  its one of the best YT playlists ever!!!
Best line ever \"I like to die with a lot of things\"
Oh man. This was the first series that I watched. This series got me  hooked on the channel, I can’t wait to see what’s next.
did dora put shotgun bullets into the turrets
R.I.P. !
This is why I fuckin love watching u guys????????
Neebs keep this going I love this series
watching you guys die over and over again brings me such joy. good job doraleous.
This episode was like a really bad smell  that I just could not  stop sniffing!!! Great work
NO, Please dont let this series end! Its way better than ARK and GTA.\nFor the love of god, keep it going :'(
Man absolutely a great series!  I'm going to miss it alot.  Usually put these series on to fall asleep.  It's been a great run guys!  The Dora tomb did not disappoint.
Goodby 7 deys to day. We will mis you.
Guys for a new series could you play don't starve togeather
This is quite possibly the funniest epic fail I have ever seen on any seven days to die video ever.
So is 7 days really over.. I would think you guys would have done like ank ending saying goodbye to all you're past houses and forts however in ark there was a success ... aka killing manticore
Ima miss this show for sure
When are you beginning on \nbff's bf v
Finally joining the men? You are almost playing 7DTD on manly settings. You girls!
Best hoard night ever!!!
One of my favorite series on this channel sad to see it end but I'm sure something will replace it and it will be just as awesome
I expected no less. Everything Doraleous touches is gold. Thus the Doraleous standard.
1st scene adajop gets tired of editing... so he decides to end the series then and there...
I'm absolutely not surprised by any of this.
Doraleous you doomed us all, you doomed us all Doraleous. -Appsro     Best line ever and moral of today's episode.  Can't wait to see what else you guys have planned and also please do a series for Don't Starve Together
Thanks for another great series boys. Looking forward to not only what you replace this with, but maybe, seeing it again after a few game updates. Cheers!!
What kind of break from 7 days are we talking about? Like a break where it comes back after a few weeks and all is good? Or the kinda break where she runs off with your cousin and you don’t hear from her again until you get papers in the mail 3 months later filling for divorce?
23:58 why does simon walk off if dora has most deaths???
Guys this was one of the funniest playthoughs ever thank you
When this game was chosen to be the next series, I wasn't overjoyed by the idea, but still watched as it was you guys. This ended up being by far my favourite thing you guys have ever created.\nThe editing, the music, the thumbnails, the little stories you all told, everything has been fantastic.\nAbsolutely gutted that the series has came to an end... Temporarily I hope. But I know that whatever you guys put out next will also be a masterpiece.\nYou truly are the best YouTube channel out there.\nKeep up the fantastic work, and thank you for everything you do.
Good job not fixing the holes Doraleous
Woah i should’ve got my peanuts for this episode
But if this is the end what will i watch Fridays. What next no more ark on Saturdays I’m only now just getting over conquest and kittens and you pull a stunt like this its too much guys ??
I am both insanely sad to see this laid to rest, and excited for whatever is coming next. This is definitely one of my favorite things to binge over and over again. All your videos bring me joy. You guys are the best
That failed just as horribly as i hoped
Way to end the journey Doraleous, without a hitch
Here's hoping the next alpha drops soon, so we can have more of the wonderful mayhem of Neebs and Friends versus the endless hordes!
Damn... getting thick'd does seem so bad now. Great series I enjoyed watching every week!!!
This was great loved it. The whole series, you guys made 7 days to die fun for me a console player who doesn’t have nearly as much stuff as pc. Great series much love! Hope to see you return to it in a year  or so
Lmao keep up the great work guys really really love what y'all do thanks guys
What does season finale really mean though guys? No more at all? Few weeks off? Different game each Friday?
Holy shit, what a way to end things. Gotta be honest, seeing all of this last week, I figured it would be a walk in the park. Never figured things would go so horrifically awry
2:11 So true ; so true
I loved the series im sad to see it go.
This...was...awesome
Wow. What a monumental fuck up. Absolutely brilliant to watch. Hope you go back to it in the future.
Sad to see this series end... But I think it's a good way to end, it just all went to shit. lol I do hope you guys return to 7 Days one day, cos it's nice seeing you guys all together and just having a good ass time (as Appsro would say :) Can't wait to see what series you guys bring next, I'm sure we'll all love it and I tip my hat to Adahop for all his hard work editing this series, it's been fantastic! love to all of you!
Wait when's the next series?
Thank you Adahop! AS much as I love my boys, this was hilarious and well worth the entertainment! Also DAMNIT DORALINGOUS!!! NEVER LEAVE ANY POTINTIAL PROBLEMS FOR SUCH INCEDENTS! \nLove you guys (account jacked by Cathleen)
Love Thick44's outro song. Awesome!
You replyin everyone today?
OMG that had me in tears I love your series so much the Simon death close up was classic. Keep it up guys!
\"Without a hitch\" - Dora, describing his death tomb.
What will you guys be playing in the near future, loved this 7 days to die stuff completely, helped me get through hard times an it’s just sad seeing it all go away
#Breadstrong
That was better than watching Picasso paint!! Art in its highest form, bravo gentlemen!!!
yup... I was right... you're ALL the dumb one.
The best episode bar none. ( Warrior with 64 genius ! )
Simons death sounds are the fucking best
Is this because alpha 17 is close to releasing?
Taxi driver out of town on a 6 hour wait. Thanks y'all for all the hilarities, the Deaths and the epic content. Well except when Simon dies like always. In all seriousness y'all are a great team and fun to watch.
I laughed more at this video then I can remember any other video from you guys. Amazing job. Doraleous for President of Neebs Gaming!
This series better come back
Great finale!  Sad to see it end but I'm looking forward to the new content that's surely to take it's place.  (D&A?)
Freaking best one in a long time. That sh*t had me dying too!
For a complete cluster fuck   It was amazing!
Awesome ending, good job guys
Somehow I knew this wouldn't work.
Thick's Seven Days To Die song should be the outro for all the 7 Days To Die gameplays.
To say I laughed so hard I shit myself is an understatement. Well done Dora.
This is why I dont prepare. Also, why the hell can these zombies dig through rock? I dont think Ive ever seen zombies do that before in an IP
Ada you are one great creator. Thanks for the awesome episodes
So.. many... death noises...
Doraleous,  great plan and horde preparation, but poorly executed.   Otherwise great entertainment.
Most people under pressure produce something 'good enough'. Adahop not only pops out a freaking diamond, but he continually pushes himself and those around him to a new level every time. And honestly it's because he cares so much about our community. I am so proud of this series and this episode, I can't wait to see what comes next. Wawdee!
Noooo I wanted more 7 days to die vidz from you all... it is a great series to watch.. Thanks for the entertainment guys really love it.. Thank you
This ended too fast
What a great ending to this series. Freaking amazing guys.
Best episode yet. I hope you guys keep making 7 days vids.
GREAT song at the end boys! Loved it
Will this huge hole in the ceiling make us all die? Nah, it's fine. Just hide it with one block and nobody will see.
Probably one if the best videos this year. But definitely y'alls. This was freaking hilarious!!! Love you guys
NEEBS GAMING ROCKS!! Always a good job and never a bad!
Inspired! Never... has it taken so much energy... to fail, so spectacularly hard... Genius! Worked as intended eh Dora... ;)  10/10       'thank you & kisses'
Nooooooo
that was awesome dora dont quit your day job
So is this the end until alpha 17?
Simply amazing ?????? \n\n\"SIMON!\" ??????
I loved watching your guys series on this every Friday evening after a long day I’ve watched every single episode at least twice and now that it’s over I hope you guys find an even better game to play in place of this but I feel like there will always still be a gap where this game used to be loved watching it you guys are amazing
And the song at the end who made that did you guys. Cuz I like it. it's really good.
seen you guys die so many times it's the most funniest thing I have ever seen in my wife
I'd give Simon a solid \"Sham Sandwich/10\" in the finale
Oh my GAWD what a wild ride that was. Twas the greatest 7 days video ever.i dont know how yall are gonna top this one.
EPIC truely awesome sooooooo funny :)
I totally forgot doraliusesessisses rape dungeon reveal from last video. So hyped for this video.
Epic!!!ALL BECAME SIMON AND SIMON BECAME LEGEND IN HIS CATEGORY!
Journeys End indeed and a marvelous one at that, thanks for the laughs in this Series.
Dora you have fail harder then Simon ever has
Love the outro! The full 7dtd song \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krgDoMQtuCk
BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i loved the death montage.I laughed so hard i probalbly pissed myself. I cant tell, still dieng of laughter. Thanks for this epic, most eventful 7 Days to Die video EVER.
So what now boys?
I have not laughed so hard in a long time. That was the best episode I’ve ever watched!! I’m having a shit time atm I really needed this, thanks guys, awesome.
A fantastic failure, hit the nail on the head lmao
EPIC!!!! but now im sad bc its over lol. Whats next? ??
Absolutely fantastic, amazing job Doraleous and great season finale Neebs Gaming!
Well, one day you can all look back and see that this debacle made you stronger... Actually, scratch that, I've watched enough of your videos to realize you've learned nothing :D
How can you guys ended on that. are you guys going to bring back the series on a different map. if not then this was an amazing series.
Dude I loved it. One of the funniest and best episodes. I needed a good laugh & again Neebs Gaming delivered. Semper Fi Doraleous.
And what a glorious season it has been! Can't wait for season 2 you guys!
Oh man I hope this isn't the last of the 7 days but def a great episode to go out on
This better not be the end of 7 days to die! Seriously won't be happy. It's my Thursday treat!!
Superb bloody editing this episode. I mean, all of the episodes have impeccable editing, but this one, this one is absolutely bloody brilliant. Well done.\n\nBut make a Simon Makes Sandwich’s series a thing :)
what is the music at 11:13 ?
What a disaster. Great episode
Fantastic!
loved the intro and the music!!!
what a great massacre, bravo
The Neebs Gaming crew's biggest enemy: Game Lag
Well if this is the finale then hopefully you guys revisit empyrion. Its about time it makes a channel comeback.
next time let needs do it  and doraleous i am truely your plan didn't work
Hate to see this end such a great series! Can't wait to see what you all get in to next
Best horde night EVER!! could not stop laughing during the death montage ?????? unlucky dora was a cool idea but what an epic fail. Still got to be one of my favourite episodes lol.
Spectacular ending, guys!! Thanks for the laughs and tips for how to better survive this game myself. Love ya’ll and hope to revisit 7dtd again someday. Now go on git!
Well what can i say? That was brilliantly terrible, and i had such high hopes for doraleous's plan. What a great episode to end on though, here's to hoping you guys come back to this one day.
Well now I am sad that the Season is over :-( now I have nothing to watch.
Guys 3 weeks till ark extinction. Y'all might want to shift into overdrive if you want to beat ragnarok on time for extinction. I don't think wyverns can enter the boss arena so you are probably gonna need a lot of rexes/spinos and heal hogs and yutyrannus.
Frighty Night next week!!!
I had the most unique laughter I've had in a long time!  I've been following this series, saw the youtube notification, and definitely underestimated this!  I was wheezing with laughter at the end, thank you for everything that you do!  It makes my day, love you guys, the best OC out there!!  KEEP IT COMING NEEBS!!!    BATTTLEEEEFIEEELLLLDDDDD!!!!!!!
BEST FUCKING VID EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is that song in the beginning? Can someone let me know?
i would have liked to see this horde night when the base actually worked correctly
This is one of the best episode ever.\n\nPlus Thick rock song in the end is the best song ever
I thought it was just ark but neebs' 7 days character also ended up looking like some sort of green hipster
Thick, your singing is terrible. FUCKING terrible.
It wasn't the holes in the ground that they went for, the AI will go right for you no matter what. Heat doesn't draw them, light doesn't draw them, YOU draw them. Even if you are at the deepest point you can go in game they will just keep digging right over your head to get to you. A deep pit with a mini base over it is the best kind of horde night trick you can do, the zombles with run into the hole trying to get to you and then you can just chuck TNT down the hole.
100 percent best episode everrrrrr loved the chaos hahaha
I havent watched yet but i feel like this is gonna be a good horde, ill bet the tunnel collapses
Best opening Montage ever
By Far the Funniest 7 Days to die episode EVER!! As I'm sitting at my desk at work trying not to let everyone hear me !! Can't wait till you start it back up again.
Or will his shoddy workmanship be their downfall.... Downfall! I didnt put 2 and 2 together, lol
Best episode of anything. Ever.
\"brain him\" proceeds to shoot directly into his anus
Best one yet.
Insert roblox \"oof\" sound for every deaths you guys had.
Love how Doraleous saw the hole... what could go wrong Dora said to him self its gonna be great.
keep it going its one of the best on the channal
Wait August 19th that's my birthday.
And THIS, gentlemen, is why we build from the bottom up when building underground. Next time you have a bunker, layer the top of your ceiling (which needs to be several blocks deep anyway) with spikes, traps, and turrets. Zombies can dig, guys. Cover the top (ground) level with dirt so you don't injure yourself. Vertical defense is key, as I think you've figured out. Also, the zombies are attracted to meat, including you. You can use raw meat in a container (like a chest, for example) to bait them into traps. Light weakens them, so make sure the area is well lit. Above all else, HAVE AN ESCAPE PLAN. All that said, the video was very entertaining, thank you for all the work these take to make. I'm an Ark player mainly (I run an unofficial cluster, hit me up if you'd like to come check it out), but I've dabbled a bit with 7 days, and I feel your pain. This was almost as bad of an idea as the Alpha Carno incident, and that's hilarious.
Awww.. noooo! I love the series, don't let it end guys!  \nBeen looking forward to every episode, gonnna miss it! :'(
Awesome...Thank you so very much for so many hours laughing.\n\nYou guys are my heros and one of the reasons Why I fell in love with the United States.\n\nThank you...and please stay the same...ever and ever\n\nPS Doraleus...great work
Will you do a survey on wich game you guys should play next or have you already decided?\nAlso this as an amazing ending to a great series, I especially liked that you chose “Journeys End” to be your journeys end.\n\nLove and Kisses from austria, keep it up!
Great series guys, and well wrapped up
funniest one so far lmfao
its my favorite series... TwT
Omg doralious
Even finish watching it yet and doraleous so far has built the best hord night shelter
I seeee a torch do you seeee a torch?
i like the last song
Say it isn't so? Loved this. Hope to see more of 7D2D
the best video EVER!!!
Doralingus, you have truly outdone yourself. The amount of time that you put into this beautiful masterpiece of a failure is absolutely amazing. I am blessed to be able to see the whole team fall apart. Especially Simon who couldn't seem to know which direction was up. Bravo team.
Best episode yet?? the music, death noises, needs/Simon spirits. Fucking GREAT Bois.
Nice job with the editing Anthony!
Needs spirit
best hoarde night yet!
Awesome.. haha. that shit was great! .... 18 deaths.. hahaha Simon
Please keep playing this and if you replace it replace it with EMPRION I really enjoyed the 4 episodes you made on but I would still prefer seven days to die but I can understand you’ve probably got bored of seven days
Good job
I love this series! I didn't expect that many deaths lol looking forward to seeing what you guys do for Frighty Nights and hope we get more 7DtD eventually.
Hahaha that was the best episode ever. Dont know who was killed more often , you guys or the zombies ;) .
Please keep making 7 days to die videos...  Lol
lol, this turned into your 7 Days Overlook Hotel hahaha. Dora should have known by now that the Z's always b-line to the players, the hole was never gonna work lol. Always great to have a morning episode, gets me in a good mood before I head to work. Can't wait for some new episodes already, awesome job as always guys!
Loved the show but very sad it’s over. What will it be replaced by?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh, Doraleous. The best of intentions.
A part of me feels bad for Doraleous since he put so much time and effort into it, but at the same time that was the most hilarious failure I've ever seen in my entire life. Literally could not stop laughing after the point where they burrow through the ceiling. My cheeks hurt so bad from smiling and laughing so hard for what felt like a never ending cycle of worst-case-scenarios one right after the next. Sad to see that it's coming to a hold/end but I eagerly look forward to more content like this. Well done boys, especially to Anthony and Adahop for adding so much flare and dramatic elements throughout the series, and also a big double thumbs up to Simon for sticking with it after going through so much shit and making me laugh my ass off the most. Great work guys!
You guys are awesome and you are my favorite youtubers
So this is finished yet scrap mechanic gets allowed to limp along like a puppy with Lupus?
I love how Doraleous just decided not to fix the holes in the cave above his platform ?? he has single handedly doomed this hord night toooo funny ?? ??( kick ass 7days to die song )
Poor Dora it's like herding fucking chickens lol
Will there be a season 2??
Haha absolutely love the orcasta music at the beginning
Wow, just wow
I shit myself laughing seriously!!!
the traps killed more simons than zombies
Sad to see this season end. But Hopefully we'll see a a new season when A17 drops...
I loved this series ty so much for making it. Sad to see it end.
I regret clicking the like button near the beginning of the video, because I got to the end and wanted to like the video, but it was already done.
Sad to see it go.
I have never laughed so much in my freaking life, omg this was just absolutely fantastic in every way!!!
Hey guys , thank you for all the episodes you did , 7 days is one of my favourite series on your channel, and I enjoyed every single episode, I sincerely hope that you will return when a17 releases , it looks like a new game , thank you for making an amazing series , and I hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did , also do you plan on playing another survival game that will replace 7 days for the time being ? This is getting too long so , ill cut it here.
I cried a little bit at the end. Working on some sounds until you come back next season. PANG.....WOO-BAP!!!.....TING!
Awe man. I stopped watching ark and seven days, bc i got so damn busy for these last couple weeks,  but I suppose that i can binge all these new episodes I've been missing.  \n\n\nstill. this was one of my most favorite series so far!
does this mean no more seven day's to die :(
So what's the new Friday night regular gonna be?
Glorious, just glorious.
I love your videos been watching for years now, always gives me something to sit down and enjoy toughly. Thanks Neebs Gaming Crew, any idea on what we can expect to see take this spot if 7 days to die is over?
Dora, you of all people should know it’s actually DuckDuckGrayDuck, but, i still love you.
Thank you. This has really helped me get through a lot of stuff. Can’t wait to see what’s next
Simon...you kill me bro...????????????
Read this in next commenting on comments, This is without doubt the best series i have ever seen and i always looked forward for more please dont end it... cant you start again and do random generated world?  I love you guys vids and its honestly kind of sad to see this series end, it feels empty. Keep up all good work though? im in tears.. and whats the most motivating thing for you guys in Youtube?
One word!!! Pure
I don't own 7 days to die...I've never played it, but I've watched every episode you've put out...ever...but I would run out today and grab a copy just to jam with you guys. This is the funniest shit ever.
How to end a series in a nutshell
Read the title and screamed NOOOOOO
Super awesome ending to a terrific season! Appreciate you gentlemen and thanks!
NOOOO, not my second favorite series after ARK. But like for real now can y’all bring back some old series like top 20 plays? Plzzzzzz
Wait this is the end!\n\nNooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!
This is a masterpiece, a FUCKING MASTERPIECE. You guys did a textbook season finale, couldn't do it anyway better. God! I have not laughed that much for a while!
What a fun ride. Thanks for the laughs!!!
Best hord night ever
I just wanted to give a big THANK YOU to all of you at Neebs Gaming. This series has been so fun to watch and has made a place in our home. As I spent the next hour being saddened by this news, it also made me realize just how great this show has been. Like any good tv show, the finale is depressing. Its like moving away from a loved one or saying goodbye to a friend. Can’t wait to see what you guys bring to the table next. Again, thank you!
The epicness just cannot be contained., Thank you guys so much.
Damn, what an ending. Who was duckduckgoose?
I knew this was gonna fail miserably. At least it was funny.
Season Finale, it was a good run folks, but we still got ARK so we good!
GG Dora
For a potato quality game you guys sure do make it interesting and funny as hell. Thanks so much for all that you all do, it always puts a smile on my face. Can't wait to see what's in the works next.
Please come back
Get harpoons on ragnorock
Sooooo I would like to put “ Thicked” to bed. But don’t feel bad caused being “Doraed” is replacing it.
thankyou for an awesome go at a game you originally had no hope for at all.  hopefully we will see you all back whenever alpha 17 comes out. alot of changes, and i can see neebs going nuts over the new motorcycle.  but what next?!
Man. I was looking forward to Simon's horde night :/
Beautifully done, boys! Beautifully done!\nLove you all so much-thank you for all your hard work and efforts, it's much appreciated!!!!
As on old friend of mine, who was quite a zombie slayer in his day, once said, \"first to aid; last to die. \"
What am I supposed to watch now  Netflix pfft
Haha! Fuck yes Dora! Have never laughed so hard seeing this go so horribly F.U.B.A.R. Great job guys keep up the great fucking work!
Thank you so much guys, I'm a firemen and love watching you guys in my free time at the station. You all make me laugh and relax. 7 days to die was amazing. Thank you again!
That went bad. Real quick. Lmao shitty its the finale though.
Would love to see a SIMON mini series of the house cleaner/repair man
Best Horde night so far you guys are great
The Home Alone theme at the beginning... proves that this channel is the best!
19:39 and all death sounds IM DEAD????????????#breadstrong
Seriously tho. Is bf friends ever coming back?....
If only the walking dead would end in such an epic fail!
As a 7DTD player, that intro got me hyped!
I hate if this is truly the end but if so hell of a way to go out Ilook forward to the next series p.s. I hope you guys have something special for Halloween
and thus a season of 7 Days to Die has ended, the mystery man who thus made the ultimate bunker into a literal death hole may never be known, CURSE YOU MYSTERY MAN!
Did Thick spill his ??!? ????
I cannot tell you guys how much I love the channel. I came to youtube looking for Ark playthroughs and found the Neebs Gaming Ark series. Since then,  I was blown away by the work and effort you put into each of your series. You made 7 days a joy to watch and I loved every moment! I do not regret subscribing!!
nice of you putting my favorite song in at the end (edit) thanks for the likes
Thank you guys so much for this game series! You did the best 7 Days to Die game series and this was an awesome journey! We love you guys!
Plz do more 7 days to die plz
Oh my God that number of deaths. This has got to be the worst/best horde night yet. Props to Ada for messing with the settings LMAO. It's a little sad to see the series go (for now? wink wink nudge nudge) but I do agree with some of the comments here, at some point it gets very repetitive and the grind for resources will eventually wear you down so it was bound to go at some point.
Even tho chaos is the norm for you guys.\nThis caught me by surprise, now my eyes are leaking and my throat hurts from laughing so much.\n\nFlu + neebs gaming is a lethal mix
What a epic finale!
Best episode ever :)
Walked into my room turned my iPod on, it went to this video instantly. Even my iPod is a huge fan
This was awesome. We all knew something like this had a high probability of happening. \n1812 overture!!
darlous did great, if only he had a team to help him
Great intro to this episode! And that revelation from 4 days earlier... Bravo Sir!!!
And also can u tame a titanboa in ark
Y'all have no idea how sad I am that this series is ending. It was my absolute favorite thing to watch on YouTube. Thank you all, especially Simon, because he is the most like me, in the sense of dying at every possible point.
That was quite an impressively built tomb Doran-Doran. Best horse night ending y'all could've possibly had.
I wonder what simons score is gona be this time
This was fanfuckingtastic! Thank you Doralingus for this amazing failure fort! XD
Don’t end it all plz
The music on the background makes it all so much more amazing,  who agrees
Would love to see Appsro play We Happy Few as a series like he played subnautica. You guys are great and keep up the fantastic work.\n\nP.S will we see any new battlefield friends or battlefield top plays from battlefield 5?
Slow clap as the comment section builds to a roaring applause. You guys are my favorite content creators even though I never seem to get on Commenting on Comments I leave comments from time to time anyways. Just got to say this series was a fine work of art. I always enjoy the series with all of you in them I think its what makes a lot of your content popular. What ever replaces this series needs to maintain that thread of the team together against something. Thanks for the free laughs.
What is going to replace 7d2d?
Intro: Gold Youtube thing. Second phase: Anthony's chubby FINGER! 3rd phase: An enoying voice coming out neebs vocal cords
AMAZING use of the 1812 Overture.
Simon rating 11
So are y'all halting production of this for now because the next update is coming out shortly?
The season ended because of Ada not because of Dora's death trap
Very Funny Episode. Loved the series guys Thanks.
Who's DuckduckGoose? \nThat dora \"sniper vision\" wasn't on his camera I think
Please do it again or something, just like ARK en Raft
All these death noises. ??
What a show! incredible!
That was so epic, great editing, the death montage was hilarious.  Hope you guys start up again with alpha 17, I look forward to my Friday work distraction that is this series.
That beginning thou. Ada you creative bastard
Is it really the end? I liked this series...! Besides ark
Wait was that really the end!!! No!!!! So sad
i hate you guys now like really ending the show dafuq?
I cant believe its all over??
The 11 assholes who disliked y'all can suck a dick 9:01 am 10/19/2018 Pacific time.
you guys got Dora’d
Sure did come a long way, from the Police Department of day 1, seriously was a lot of laughter and a lot of gripe, But lets put it to a vote, Should there Be a Season 2 or should we let them stay buried.\nThank you Neebs for being there, Simon, your great man, Just take your time and don't rush in. Dora, Chin up you may get another chance to Prove your self, Don't screw it up. Thick, Best I have seen you perform since day one, Appsro, if i need a friend in the Apocalypse I would be Honored to be shot by you.\n\nAs a company of men just trying to survive I wish to count My self among you.
god dammit this vid is nothing but a 20min laugh track at my house
Epic end to the journey.
The zombies just completely flipped those defences. \n\" WE'RE NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU! YOU'RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH US!\"
Best episode hands down
This was a great series and I hope you come back to it.
Sad to the series end. It will be missed.
INCREDIBLE INTRO! WELL DONE ADAHOP!
???????????? WOOOOO!
When will the season be back???
Soo does that mean it's the final episode or your just doing seasons for it now
Here's to hoping the new series will either be The Forest or Conan Exiles.
Uhhhh.\n\nWhoah boy.\n\nAfter canyon horde, it should have become an accepted fact that zombies can dig. \n\nFast. \n\nSo, if one is underground on horde night, and starts to see debris falling from directly above, one would be well advised to prepare for a zombie to drop on one’s head. \n\nAs for the title card at the very end: YOU BETTER. \n\nWhat game is next, fellows?
I would've loved to seen how it was suppose to work
I kind of thought this would happen lol they always know exactly where you are on horde night heat Dosent matter then. This might work against a horde on any day that isent horde night. I feel bad for doraleous.. all that work for nothing lol
Can't wait for Simon's Horde Night!
The death noises????
Loved this episode
Is it even possible to wipe in this game or do you just keep respawning?
Hahahahha ?????? this was absolutely fantastic lol but finale ?????????? noooooooo god why? Lol I love these video
I cant believe Anthony did that to you guys!
Hahhaaaa I spilled coffee everywhere and almost passed out from laughing. Superb disaster ??????
Thanks to the whole group for the entertaining 7 days videos. Hopefully you all return to the series soon. It's my favorite of all your series.
To be fair you cant really blame doraleous for this game's bullshit
SEASON 2!
17 seconds in.. \"is this...the first FRIGHTY nights!??\" Its 12am...\n\n(9:47) Damn, well you tried Dora.\n\nSo is that the end of this series?
Now that's what I call a finale
Thank you guys! That was the best content from 7 days to die! i was laaughing my ass off the whole time!!!
The Doraleous laugh gets me every time..too contagious...lol
So the finale was a glorious shitfest because Doraleous didn't bother to try fixing a hole, now if that isn't the spirit of this series, I dunno what is
There was show one liners that will make me look laugh for some time you guys will have a hard time topping this finle but if mean no more 7 days then I will hold my breath tell there a new one
Crying at simon.  Finally getting out, getting chopped, then land mines.  HAHA  One of the best videos yet!!!!!
That was amazing. I think Dora should head up all the horde night builds.
I honestly haven't laughed this hard in months, this was an absolutely amazing season finale. Please revisit the game when Alpha 17 drops, it's the best series of yours imo.
that was impressive. I felt like I was at the movies.
Brilliant series. Replace it with Simon Does Sandwiches please.
Adored this series! Can't wait for the next one! :D
One of the best damn episodes y’all made , you guys had me laughing keep them coming. We need longer episodes for Ark and 7 days
This was probably the funniest way to end this series lol ??
Doraleous thanks for making this such a legendary fail! Only you guys can psyche something up so damn well and then have it all crumble around you in moments. Literally. Y'all are the best.\n\nI found your channel through 7 Days to Die. My partner and I were on Day 250 or so and we were looking up some videos on farming and bases to help make our builds better. Somehow you came up--and I'm so glad you did! We've been addicted to your channel ever since, and are now trying to make my way through the Ark game thanks to that series. \n\nI'm really excited to see what comes next. Thanks for entertaining!
THAT WAS AMAZIMG HAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAAA epic video couldn't stop laughing so good
This was an amazing series
Will there be another poll for the next series
That was epic
please dont end 7 days to die it is the most funny and insteresting gameplay in your channel and I like it very much
Well is over now what
I’m gana miss Simon getting destroyed by everything in 7day to die
Greatest episode ever! Are you guys picking up again for 17? Soonish?
Are you guys going to make ark aberration series please do
that death montage!
Thank you guys for such an amazing series :-) cant wait to see what y'all play next
Well do Random gen and put it up 5 so you can explore more.
Im sorry but this bass idea was stupid AF. Yall should know by now the zombies take the most direct route possible. As shown in your desert base when the majority of the horde tried to come directly at you from the other side... you know.. the gorge.. You should have been able to figure out they were going to dig strait down onto you.
I’m sad the series is ending but I can’t wait to see what takes its place
Honestly who dislikes these videos? You need to grow the fuck up and troll your own life these guys rule
By far, the best episode yet! I couldn't stop laughing! What a way to end the season. I am sad to see it end, but I look forward to whatever you guys have planned next! Maybe give The Forest a shot?
Fantastic series. Loved it. The horde nights were mixed, varied and creative. Look forward to see what you guys do next
Sad to see this series coming to an \"end\". Had the greatest time watching it, comes in at second place in my fave series, after Ark. Btw nice plot Dora, couldn't have asked for a better ending than a deathhole and faulty ceilings LOL
I have been so excited for this video that I ALMOST feel ashamed.
:`^)
Fucking gold.
Hold up, can we talk about how amazing that outtro is? Like dayum!!!!!!!
This was way better than the walking dead
That is some Deathstar level design flaws. Good Job.
Doraleous YOU HAD ONE JOB!  \n\n\nWill we see 7 Days again? ??
I was anticipating a perfect horde night... and I guess it was! perfect finale...great laughs! I recognize feeling safe while digging my own grave in this game. respect for ending  the series at it's zenith point. You squeezed all the fun out of this game and I will follow you into the next adventure!
Don't feel to bad Dorra.   I spent a month building an underground base  just to have a bug in the game fill it all in and wipe out all my stuff.  I play on console and we have never got any love from the devs of this bug ridden game.  No up dates no patches no fixes.  Just empty promises.  I'm glad telltale is gone they made a ton of half finished games took a shit ton of money from fans that believed in them and just shit all over them.    I will miss this show.  Can't wait to see what is next.  ??
Ha RIP Simon. The end of this series has me thinking RDR2 will take up this slot :)
Please have season 2 of this series ??
This was fucking great! Might of been the worst day for you in the game but it was definitely one of the best for me!!
Great stuff guys keep it up.
Who is champ wild?
Saw the comment from Adahop, I think you guys are misunderstanding him it's not a new season but a new series...\nNeebs gaming crew please keep playing this game, there's other days of the week and no offence to scrap fans but I'm sure many of us would prefer this over that. You only played seven hordes cmon this game is a playground for your type of content.
What about the next season though?
Plz replace with gta or subnautica
Plz don't end this series
No more 7 days to die .......  not cool at all guys
What a massacre????
THANK YOU!!! Seriously.  I'm a 911 dispatch supervisor and it can get a little stressful at times.  On my breaks, I'll hide outside and watch you guys. 7 Days is my favorite but any one will do the job. Thank you for helping me though the hard days like today.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY WHY IS THIS THE END!??! (by the way i was dissapointed in Doraleouses build, i really wanted it to work it would of been amazing) A+ on Effort but it's a Mega F for performance
Dat ingame lag
they should've given the RPG to neebs cuz he's an RPG genius
\"I could kill them right now\" \"That doesn't make sense, let the environment do it\" best lines ever!
NOOOOOO! I love this series
This channel and community is AWESOME!!! And it keeps getting better and BETTER! Been following since yall were at 10k!!!
So that's what catastrophic failure looks like!
So I have a lot of down time at my job, and nothing fills the void of boredom like watching Simon play video games in an incredibly novice way. Thank you fuzzy little man peach for doing your best
Fantastic end to the season.
On the one hand, this was a great way to spend some time before having to go to work! On the other hand, this might have been an accurate representation of the day I'm GOING to have at work.
thick is a real surviver
Fucking Simon makes neebs gaming lmfao! I guess all of you do ??
This can not be the end, I look forward to seeing these.   Every thought about doing a fallout 76 season that would be awsome.
Still pretty pissed yous guys never filled the lighthouse moat
Time for deep rock galactic now or what? Been waiting for it for months!
Fucking epic.  Doraleous is the only one who can turn a complete and utter failure into the most entertaining episode of the series.  That was the greatest shitshow ever, Devil Dog.
Noooooooo
You'd think a season finale would be a bit longer.... ;)
Doraleous should have completely encased the room. It at least would have delayed the horde
Nice season finale.\n\nA couple of bugout boxes around the sides with spare guns & ammo might have helped.\n\nNice of Simon to keep testing the spinning blades to ensure they were constantly working.
Definitely haunted..
Fantastic. I know everyone's going to say \"Oh no please don't end the series!\" You know what, I loved this series but I love you guys more. Just do whatever you want I'm sure I'll love it. I, like many of us, have yet to dislike a single video you all have made. That's just a testament to how much time and care you put into your videos. That combined with your comedic talent and mind boggling ability to shit the bed in a video game in such an epic manner when it seems that you're not trying to. Love you all. kisses, pats on the butt.
PLS MORE BUT NEW SEASON NEW START
most worse horde plan yet. whose the ediot design this thing in the first place, \n\n\n(hahah....)
336 hours of this game!! How much do you have on ARK
Killing simon simulator
By far you guys (Simon) blew up more from your mines than the horde did.  Nice.
Please don't end this series whyyy
See y'all next season!
RIP 7 days to die. You will be misssd
Yay!  I get to say I CALLED IT!  Those zombies dug straight down on top you all and you got Thick'd- no a Doracaust (should put that on a T-shirt).\n\nDoraleous your idea was sound and could've worked.  Next time try on the surface instead in a \"Death Hole\".  Maybe a LOTR Helm's Deep base with the same setup,  though likely better just to make an Alamo instead and hope you survive.\n\nGreat episode, hilarious, looking foward to more to come!\n\nEdited a week later:\nM'kay guess this is the last one.  Too bad but I believe in you guys and I know you will make more fun content beyond this in the future.  \n\nIf I get on commenting on comments somehow please let us all know what your plans are now that you have ended both GTA5 and 7DaystoDie series?
Wh...wh..wh..what, this series is ending? Awww... Well, I really appreciated this series. Entertainment isn't meant to last forever, and I understand. I hope there is another series y'all have in mind. #breadstrong
Get em ADA!
well that happened
This is a artistic masterpiece
...And with a heavy heart and a heavy soul Adahop ran out of time and money so the story ends..some say they all live. Some say Simon was the only one who did not make it. No one will ever know.
No more? But this was my favorite of their series.
make a new map and survive horde night in a sky scraper
OMG ??????????THIS IS THE MOST FUNNIEST VIDEO I EVER SEEN???????? \n\nThe title of the video shoud be \"1000 way to die in 7days to die\" ??????
This was the best way to end a series!! I absolutely loved it and couldn't stop laughing. It's was an amazing ending to an even better series.
Beautiful series ending. Sad to see it go, but beautiful nonetheless. Keep up the amazing work, and Doraleous, you should go into tomb building. Your pretty good at it!
Take a shot every time Simon dies.
I was expecting this to get bad, but not that bad. Loved it. Reminds me of when my brother and I turned the spawner all the way up.
That was... entertaining. Ooh God I love that song! has been my favourite since it came out :D Not talking about 1812 tho, I wasn't alive when that came out lol.
You need to sell keyboard keys like the ada key for everyone on the team.  Outstanding.
Amazing finale guys! Can’t wait to see how you guys top that! For your next adventure you guys should check out a game on steam called Hobo: tough life,  Cheers keep up the good work ;-)
This was a great series....I hope you do another in A17.
This was honestly one of your best videos!! Loved the finale and I'm looking forward to season 2 in A17
Easily the best episode in the entire series. Failure = Entertainment\nGreat job Dora!!!
I'm gonna miss this series so much!!! :'(
I think it's safe to say this went  well
The moment I saw the debris I started laughing :D \nThe most spectacular fail in a while.
I have loved this series. Thank you lads. Dora your hole is amazing
I really hope you guys return to this series, it's one of my favourites.
\"Smaller nipple for a more breast like teat.\"\nThat's the ad I saw when starting this vid lol I don't even have kids
What’s going to replace 7D2D now??? \n\nEdit: I was always pumped for the weekend because I get to watch 7D2D in Fridays and Ark on Saturdays. New series better be good.
This was the most epic of the hords loved the fact adahop showed us takeing it to the max
Simon fails, because he doesn't care about the details or didn't pay attention.\nThick fails, because he thinks he knows what he's doing and just goes for it.\nNeebs fails, because he thought he was prepared, but kind of underestimated the situation or got cocky.\nDoraleous fails after putting in a ridiculous amount of effort, but somehow missing a minor detail, that results in something spectacular.\n\n\nAppsro fails to fail.
Can't wait for the frighty night next week!
Ouuu Frighty Night NEXT WEEK!!! Always a treat!
best 7d2d ever
HORDE NIGHT BABY!!!
What a wild adventure, that I enjoyed so much. Can't wait to see what you guys have in store for the next series!
Favorite series on one of my favorite games.
Well, if this truly was the series finale, or if you're waiting on Alpha 17, then I would say this was truly one of the best endings to one of your series but I wish you continued it.
Nooooo!! One of my favorites series ??????
?????????? sad to see it go. ???????????????????? glad to rewatch it!!!!!
I hate this game, yet I love watching you guys play. Damn fine way to end the series. Well done all. Dora, way to play for the Zombie team with that death trap. Couldn't have gone better!
Neebs Gaming crew should join an online server together, that is at day 500+
Awesome! I'm going to miss this series. Great job once again, you guys are killing it!
Neeebs beating cheerleader by hand...  Never thought I would be alive to see this moment
BRAVO !!!!!  *throwing flowers and Xanax for Simon* !!  Unbelievably amazing series, guys.  That was one hell of a climax!  Made me wet and tingly.
Most epic gaming award goes to Simon. Dora and his good intentions and instincts got everyone thicked
I'm so sad to see this series end but also super excited for what ya'll will replace it with!!
Sorry I couldn’t make it to the stream last night love the video tho
Worst Hoard Night shelter....of ALL time.\n(love the ending song guys)
wait.... season finale??? what?!?!?!?!
Oh man i just finished watching the video and wanted to like. Then i realized that i already did. xD\nGotta like a Neebs Gaming video before it even starts cus it is going to be good 100%!! \nAWESOME SEASON FINAL, GUYS!!
Wait did that just say it's over
They looked prepared
New series please
What did I just watch :O
Duckduckgoose is powerful
I think you meant October 19th not August
Neebs and them should do a team v team death match.\nThey form 2 teams on a map and spend 1 week making bases and then killing each other among the zombie hordes.
Can’t wait for season 2
Man .. Ada should have also joined the gang for the finale..
was that simon singing at the end?
I hope for more
The most entertaining horde night ever and did Adahop partly fuck you up with changing the maps settings
Thanks so much for this series and for what you guys do. You bring so much happiness and laughter to so many.\n\nSeries such as this get my whole group friends exicted and playing games together. Cant thank you enough. \n\nAlso when Simon got killed by the murder vomit, I just lost it. \n\nBadda bing pizza pie
Holy crap this one was the best to date....the horror...the horror!!! Awesome edit
Damn you boys are good at this. I don't look forward to football games or new TV episodes, I look forward to your new episodes. So well made and enjoyable. Seems like the new fallout game would be perfect for your recording format + it would be good for views, discuss on the podcast pretty please!
I like the bunker \n\nReminds me of a underground mining system
This was painful
This was the most amazing episode ever guys! I don't think I've ever laughed this hard!! Very very well edited Adahop! And thank you Doraleous for an excruciatingly beautiful bliss of a failure! I am honestly filled with pains of bittersweet closure. I never wanted this series to end... Between this and Ark, I have no favorite. But this game just oozes content from you guys. There is a hole in my heart now. Guess it's time to rewatch it again from the beginning. Thank you Neebs Gaming for being amazing.
For some reason, seeing a shirtless Simon in the thumbnail made me smile. As usual.
This is the best episode ever I love  it
Wow I’m an hour late
7 weeks of 7 days to die. Great end to a great series. To think I was praising Dora on his defense work last week! Oh well, made for one hell of an episode!
more like seven...teen WAYS to die!
Beautiful season finale just beautiful
Doraleous you f*** up. But is funny as hell!!!
season finale??? But i look forward to my friday fix of zombie neebs mayhem noooooooo
Yall need a simon death counter on all the games
Best .....day....ever:D:D:D Dora you are the man !!:D
Now i know what means \"bittersweet\" I loved every single moment and i hope it continues soon. Love you all
I dunno if you heard from the Raft community, but there was a huge update recently. They added big islands, puffer fish, and a big bird called the screecher. :)
FINALE?!?! Wait no more 7DTD?!?! NoooOOoOOoOOOoOOOO!! Conan or Empyrion better be replacing it!! Anything else would be a travisty!
So this is the season final\n\nWill there be. New season?
But... The 7 Days series will continue.. Right?!
That was amazing. Love you guys
Nonstop laughter this is what I subbed for
duralious is the best
Zombie Sun Tzu: always leave your enemy a path of escape. \nDoraleous:  Watcha' gonna do now Zombie Sun Tzu.
https://youtu.be/jBLyyexZZoc Appsro and Simon kiss rl!
Best finale ever in history LOL
so is this like gonna be the last 7 days episode?
N is for no survivooooooors when you-
I'll miss this series ??
Noo this I one of my favorite ??
This is definitely the funniest 7 days horde night in the series. #RIPMegaBunker
Play the forest !!
nice intro
you all deserve a pat on the back great final! dora shame on you not covering the holes haha bless simon he did not stand a chance. hope u come back when alpha 17 hits love all of you thank you so much...ps great video editing truly amazing!!!
Shoddy? lies! dora did an excellent job how dare you Anthony.
No that cant be it why why wwwhhhhhyyyyyyy
Ffs Simon.
By the way it’s 1:30 am and I had to watch this lol
this was painful to watch
Top 100 deaths in Anime XD
After this I would be done too
so season finale isnt the same thing as SERIES finale is it?
The zombies finally won thanks to doraleous's bunker. Good effort big fail love it.
that was thick greatest moment!! That's it you are going with me!!!! Bloom!!
Bravo fellas, bravo! Encore! Hate to hear that this is the finale but I’m sure what you guys have next is going to be better than the contraption doraleous built! Love the videos, you guys make my day. Keep it up.
Please do random gen map next season.
My mom comes in my room to find out what's so funny, I'm laughing so hard.  Thanks for posting this so early West Coast time, LOL.  You made me wake my mom up.  I don't wear jewelry, and I don't like to cook, Simon.  I guess that's why I'm part of the female minority in your viewership.  I swear I tell everyone I know to watch you guys, even the tow truck driver the other day, LOL.  You have the best produced gaming videos on YouTube.  Also, with all the hours I've play 7 Days to Die, I've NEVER died on a horde night...and I'm a girl.
Commenting because I want to be on the next episode ??! Hello ! I love you guys in a none gay way! You cunts rule ??
Best thing on the internet
I like how Dora is laughing the entire time that the crew is dying around him. It's like he knew this cave would be the death of them. ????
No I love you guys and this game.  I can’t believe it the final season
No don’t end it my day has already been crap don’t make it worse ??
Masterfully edited once again
Doralious shooting simon, he obviously did this on purpous to get him lol
Sad the Series is ending for now. I'm sure it's just exhausting to even edit the show. But if a new series is coming then I'm sure it will be good.
Noooo this can't be the end! This is my favourite series!!! :'(
omg, first 30 sec and i'm sitting on the edge of the chair, excited like a little boy the night his first new year's eve.
Now that is entertainment!  If I had a billion bucks in the bank, I would pay you each $10,000 a day to make a daily 7 Days to Die episode! Unfortunately, I don't have a Billion of anything,! I do have 37.2 trillion cells in my body, and they ain't worth much!
good idea... poor execution.
6:41 I can already tell this is going to be the best horde night ever
THIS doraleous is why you ALWAYS have an escape plan
This has been one of my favorite series from you all. Got me playing the game too! Thank you all for it! Been a wild and fun ride, hope it gets a return soon!
Flawless Victory!
Best episode ever
I'm lowkey glad the series ended at first it was interesting then only the horde nights were interesting, if you are going to start new series I suggest you to try Terraria it's a really good survival game with lots of activities in it, but if you gonna play Terraria I suggest you to play in the expert mode it would be way more fun or you can play Terraria with mods it's up to you. But it doesn't matter what will you upload I'll still watch it.
Season finale or series finale? I'd love a 2nd season
Yep they are all fucked
One of the most epic videos ever lol!
R.I.P Simon 2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018....
Oh my freakin God that shit was funny!
I take it that's the end for now until the new update comes out loved every minute of the series. What a great ending but a great disaster love it keep up the good work guys. Maybe when the new update comes out you can do a random map. Oh and love that Dora laughed pretty much all the way through it haha?????????? Don't you go and finish Ark now keep that up for a little longer please would be devastated if that finished as well.
Should hav ended it with public execution of dora.. like in minecraft
Doreaous you are a wenkar.
You have to put spikes and traps above yourselves so zombies dont drop down on you
Best video on youtube
My favorite show from Neebs Gaming.  Gonna hold you to it being a \"Season Finale\" and not a \"Series Finale\".
8/10
I hope this is not the last one
I had such high hopes...
Hay Yaa'z ..... Thanks For The Laffs, Sad to see it end, but there will have to be a Brady Bunch Reunion at some point. ??
They probably won’t make more till Alpha 17 guys. So around December. (The company of 7D2D are very slow updaters...)
perfect .. nothing more to say
Ada you evil monster
I really though that doraleous has a ton of explosives just buried somewhere and he was going to just blow everything to hell at the end. I’m kind of glad this series is over, it was starting to get boring not just for me but it also seem to be getting boring for them. You can tell when they had enough of a game. Anyways, love you neebs gaming and great job on the stream last night. World peace.
Wow..... what a way to finish the series! That Dora score is the most accurate score yet.
I'm gonna miss this series. Always makes my midday Fridays at work more enjoyable knowing I have a 7 Days video to keep me preoccupied
its like home alone
sometimes all it takes is one flaw for an entire plan to fall to pieces.
maybe the  best episode in years
Hahahaha Simon spent more time spawning then fighting, next time give him the torch lmao
Wtf noooooooo you can't end this series omg I love watching 7 days to die. It's my friday must watch...boohooohoo (internet lingo crying)  but on the serious note nooooooooooo. And the award for the most times died during hord night go to simon (all please give a round of applause). Love you guys but you got your work cut out trying to replace this series
Hope to see more next season .
Dora seemed to be at the top of his game with the introduction of the battleship build and what promised to be the best horde night base to date. The people were even about to elect him for president! Its always awful to see someone fall from grace
Such a bitter sweet ending to it all had me laughing so hard the entire time this team is by far the best gaming team out there absolutely a huge fan of every single one of you would very much hope and love to see some more 7days to die in the near future and try not to give poor old doralious a hard time he spent a lot of time and effort into that death hole ?????? great video guys
Ah man ... I'm so happy and sad all at the same time
If after you died in the game you were reborn as a zombie hoard nights would be much crazier than this. Especially for Simon because there would be 18 more zombies that were way more competent than Simon actually is. I personally would have gone with the good ole thick escape plan like in the canyon but that's just me.
Wow, fantastic editing on this episode. My compliments to the chef!
This is by far the funniest shit I’ve ever seen ??????
As sorry as I am to see the series end it was a fantastic finale! I came to find Neebs Gaming from this series and have since watched many of their series.  Thank you all for the wonderful content and all the hard work you obviously put into it. I do hope you come back to a17 when it is stable and treat us all to more wonderful episodes of one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI do have to say something that I learned in the army many years ago. \n\n\"The harder you make it for them to get in, the harder it is for you to get out. \"
This was the most epic disaster I've ever seen. I approve.
Man, seriously!? This is the end of 7 days to die?! This was my number 1 series!!
I never laughed so hard in my life.
Best outro ever
Wow
Noooooo this is my favourite show don’t stop now
Ended the best way it could have, cheers! Also I don't think they are so much attracted to heat as they are Simon's delicious flesh.
You fuckers... You get me completely invested in a wonderful series only to take it away from me. If you stop playing Ark any time soon, there will be hell to pay. I’m talking to you Thick44. HELL!!!!!!!!!!
7 Days is my favorite series you've done. so much so i've went out and got the game, still trying to find a play group on PS4, but i know the game is kinda old. I fear the day when thi series ends, cause i know i'll miss it alot. Also, Dora...WTF. That was the worst horde night plan, well aside from the Hospital Bullet proof glass night. I dunno, the death hole seems worse.
What a great and hilarious way to end a great series... Thanks guys (esp. Adahop)!
Epicccccc big love !!!
Record for most deaths on a horde night\n\nIt'll be safe -doralous
It wouldn't be Neebs Gaming if it actually worked as planned. Still love you though big D!
Definitely shoddy workmanship lol. Talk about out of frying pan and into the shitter lol. Hope you guys have a good vacation to recharge. Can't wait for more great content from y'all
not even a minute in and i gotta pause to ?? and salute that intro! lol
Loved it keep up the good work!
Noooooooooooo make a season 2
Plz say on alpha 17 you start over again! ;( ;( ;(
We all love simon this is a death trap
Not watch the episode yet just on my way on from work to watch it on the big screen but what the hell is this about season finale ???? I love this show hope it comes back when alpha 17 drops with all the new stuff and hope you have something for in the mean time what else I'm I going to look forward to on a Friday night
I hate to see it go GOOD BYE 7 DAYS TO DIE??
A worthy finale.
RIP Simon, Apsero, Doraleous, Thick44, and Neebs. We will continue to survive the zombie apocalypse in memory of everyone who died in the bunker/tomb.
Holy hell, just send Simon to post-war areas and have him find and clear all the mines.
OMG thick's song at the end is priceless
Oh adahop you troll
Welp doraleous really knows how to bring the comedic value...
Nooooo, not the season finale, hopefully you do another, maybe do a modded one like war of the walkers, but keep up the great vids, love watching you guys
Best epic episode yet
What a fantastic disaster! If nothing else, Doraleous is a guarantee to put in the most effort, create the best defenses and still have the most epic failure in the shows history, you're a hero in the world of comedic gaming sir! Just keep kicking the chain!
best show ever
i cried
Nooooo I'm so sad it's over
Loved it so much 7 days to die was great thank you for the memories neebs gam will definitely miss this
Oooooooooooooohhhhh this is about to be really really really reallly good
Fantastic. Those holes Dora conveniently left above them worked flawlessly. Great episode. Haha
The best 7 Days to Die finale ever seen! Absolutely loved it ^_^ Also lol to Simon 16:21
7000 views in 35 mins ...not bad
omg Simon cracks me up
Does this mean no more 7 Days Videos, if so what will you guys be doing next. Can't wait to here it on Commenting on Comments
can't wait to see the next series you guys make. This was probably one of my favourites.
i hope you guys don’t quit this series. it’s awesome and there is so much more you could do....
Is anyone keeping count of how many death there where
Simon is a WARRIOR
I blame you!!! I just put my kid to sleep for a nap and I laughed so hard when I saw the \"little problem\" I woke him up I tried to get up and tend to him but I was laughing so hard I almost threw up and dropped my phone
The best episode in a long time , love the way simon hope get high , just to be cruch by some epic way to die, keep up the good work boys love your videos .
This was a godlike episode
Best.episode.ever! I wish I could like this more than once
Not the hardest difficulty. Disliked and unsubbed. Also punched a kitten for good measure.
Do you want a president that hits Cheerleaders? Say no to woman beater nerbs, and yes to Simon/Fozzy Bear 2018
Red dead?
0 likes so far
This was so majestically retarded. I'm sad it's the end but what a fucking episode
Came for the finale, stayed for the great editing skills
Wow this game series is a year old. Doesn't feel like it's been that long at all
Will this be a season finale or series finale? Since I heard that they are no longer going to be running the console servers anymore.
Even  1st horde night was better then this this lol
Lol simon
Masterful, what an amazing series. Thanks everyone for the great show, looking forward to the next!
The Last Stand of Neebs Gaming (2018, Colorized)
Next season we need a Simon death counter!
The addiction factor of your shows is going up. I can't live without Ark or 7 days to die.\nIf you stop 7 days to die I'm going to need another Neebs Gaming production series to get through the week.\n\nP.S. Dora don't listen to the haters. Ada screwed you over and I think the Death Hole... hermmmm... I mean bunker was a great idea.
Dont end it Neebs\nLike if you want the season to continue
so are you guys gonna update the game now and play w the new stuff?
It's over ????
well shit its last
This channel and the guys are HIGHLY underrated.
Wait, is the 7 days series over for good?
Hi can I get 100 likes for no reason :) and if no likes then at least a heart from NEEBS GAMING :)
Who IS laughing like that at 10:07?!?!?!?!!? lmao
Pleeeeease do come back with a second season of 7DTD...maybe once Alpha 17 is released?  It's been the most enjoyable series I've seen so far!  Also, how do I get an Adahop button on my keyboard?!
OMG! I laughed so hard at this! Love the fact that Dora KNEW that hole was there and was like \"oh I hope that doesn't become an issue\". He invested so much into this place but didn't fill those holes? Also how did Simon not fall in them lol.
What?! Season finale. Hmmmm but I want more.
I love the name of the D drive
This might quite possibly be the funniest thing I've ever seen. I love you guys
August?
better than the glass box, but not by a lot :p  untill 21minutes in, then i noticed it was worse xD
#ooza #booza
Omg.....that was EPIC! ????
Watching this at 2:05am in Australia right now\n\n#WorthIt
Journey End is the name of place in the video. I dont think it is the End of the Journey
This is the best season finale of any show you've ever done lol
I am really sad that this show is over for now... But still it was a great finale!
Please go to a random gen world next! This show is too good to end! Random gen worlds are 10x bigger and I know y’all will love it! So will we the fans!
Only Doraleous could build something so complex with such a simple flaw. Proud of you Dora :)
666th like
I hope the new series is going to be Minecraft or empyrion
21:13 to 21:43 best funny death montage ever!!!!!!
Sad to see this series go. I've had so much fun watching it. I'm sure you'll come back to it once they update it....whenever that is...??
Wow, this was quite the Doracaust. Think Dora's kill count got padded quite nicely in this one.
Oh yes D's inner monologue is back!
The 1812 Overture was perfect =)
How did they get two drops?
Greatest ever
Praying for all in South carolina
I thought Doraleous was being loopy,  but that was a master stroke.  God bless Marine Corps training!!!
What a deathtrap... love it
May we never forget the massacre of Day 50 that Doraleous brought upon everyone. Yet it maybe the best episode of any Neebs Series yet. Absolutely hilarious. Thank you Doralingus.
God dammit guys you guys killed it on this one.  Wow i laughed so hard i snorted...lol  LOVE the 7 days to die ones to death.  Also gratz on last nights stream watched from start to finish and loved it all.  Waiting for the next one (im Srrock61 in twitch and Srrock on steam)
Plus the 7 days song at the end hell ya
This was great
By far the best episode of the whole series. I knew when we got the preview of doras setup something fishy was just waiting to happen
Thankfully they added body count. That was great
New season soon pleaseeer
I liked the death count at the end \nAnd this was one of the funniest episodes yet guys great job keep it going
hey guys i have a series idea  for you, you guys should play dying light
Is this goodbye forever or are they getting ready for the next alpha release?
The greatest episode EVER!!!
Gotta get ready for work, so will have to wait til tonight to watch the full episode, but that intro has me HYPED!
Haha hahahaha best hoard night ever my side hurts
God damn it doraleous
Kinda suck that yall had to end blaming doraleous. Doralingus ftw
How often does this happen
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Best season finale EVER!
F
Nah his cant be the end we haven’t seen Simon fortify his own base yet \nI mean can’t be as bad as Dora’s
This episode was the most brutal and bloodiest horde then any other horde
Best horde night ever!
#MoreThanOne Horror game this October.
I don't think that there was any other way this could end.
I knew they were goin to dig
Is this really the season finale
Hands down, this is by FAR the most entertaining 7 days episode in HISTORY.
Lmao
\"Im in a fistfight with a cheerleader\"\n-Neebs 2018
HELL YES!! Beautiful ending!!! You guys are fuckin amazing!!
Dorbjorn planned this from the very start, it was revenge for all the times the guys made fun of his haircut
This is my happy place. This and whiskey.
How funny would it be if the gimp randomly made an appearance in 7 days lol. He just makes random appearances in dif games
Absolutely love your content guys, keep it up cute butts!!
This was fucking great
Why didn't dora just reverse the layout of the horde area?
Why stop this is great
Season finale \n\nMe: nooooooooooo\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 2?
When you literally get defeated because you left a hole in the ground. That could not have played out any worse! Doraleous’ Death Hole is the best horde night in my opinion! Lmao
This game must feel frustrating. Too bad the zombie drillers makes it hard to innovate every Horde Night to be different.\nWonder how a horde night on water would go.
Oh god not warrior difficulty!! How could you be so cruel ?! ;c
DIE SIMON DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Love the intro!!!
Am I the only one who thinks the music in the beginning sounds like Star Wars for a second?
Dora has earned his \"Maker\" coin.
THAT SONG WAS SO EPIC! WHO'S DICK DO I HAVE TO SUCK TO GET THIS FUCKING SONG IN MY LIFE?
Guys from Neebs, have you seen Dark and Light? Its Ark, but with magic.
You get a like just for that INTRO!
It didn't take them seven days to die though, only like 20 minutes.
I have to do it again SEEPY GOAT!!! Also the next zombie game you should play is unterned and its free
YEAAAAASSSSS!!!!!
At first I thought it was overkill, but then I realized it was designed so the zombies can go over and kill the crew.  THE BEST DEATH TRAP.
Appsro is like the Bill Paxton of the group . God rest his soul .
so this is the last episode?  nooooooooo
Best fucking horde night ever. I love this shit. Let everyone know on commenting with comments how fucking bad ass u all are. God job doraligus
Wait no more 7 days?
But why were the shenanigans done in august, its october so they havnt noticed since then?\nLol
Nightmare before Christmas the perfect underline music
Shit went south real quick lol
You had one fuckin job.....
Yeaaahhhh!!!
Congrats guys. This was freaking awesome. You guys earned it. Keep on being you????
But it’s October.......
Neebs plz do more ark
Please don’t say “season finale”. I’m having flashbacks to EPISODE 2 of Ghost Recon: Wildlands -_-
The intro gave me goosebumps. I love the work guys
Hell of an intro :D
I'd say revisit minecraft, a conan or a appsro series
Guys, you better give us a season 2 or you'll... umm be cursed with noodle dicks YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
Say it isn't so
Haha loved the start of it. The music made it so dramatic! Can't wait for when you guys starts Red Dead 2\n\nEDIT: Watched the rest of it. This entire thing past 19 mins is practically everyone's death montage. Well done Simon, a new record.\nAnd Dora? You are an idiot. Congrats.
We all know it was thick because he turned up the thermostat
You guys should try \"Generation Zero\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvVuF3dE1c
I guess everything ends at some point.
The next game you should all play. is Rust.
Doralingus is beast
Well now.....THAT was unexpected! Frickin torches
Do a season 2 at alpha 17 update a lot of new things been added. Also if u don't want to do it in navazgane do a randomly generated map
Is that a chest or what at 5:51? Middle of the ledge made in hole.
Not survivalist?
Is there going to be another season??
Appsro de booty yeah
SEASON FINALE?!?!?!?! NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is this the last episode of 7 Days to die??
I'm so hyped for the Frighty Night episodes!!!!
lol strap in, here we go boys n girls.
HEY SIMON.... SHUT UP
final episode, just in time for the incoming A17 update. nice timing.
Already super pumped 1 minute into the video
screams
WAIT, do you guys all have an Adahop button ? What does it do ? Does it make a wild Adahop appear and fetch you ice tea or beer ? Does it squeek when you press it ? Is Adahop trapped in a cell unless the button is pressed to release him ?
Cat Herding simulator 2018
season finally! better come back this is hilarious! how do you get these angles? \nBTW barrels and torches are only good for light not much heat you want to fire up camp fires and forges.

Great job Capp as usual
Yeah my experience here ended just about how the walking dead did.
I hated the prison as a base. The perimeter is rather large which makes it impractical to defend. Whenever I left the base for too long, some sleepers would spawn inside. It's fine for a temporary base, but would not recommend for long term.
Ask that a Prison Guard and you´ll spend time there.
I would like to see a bigger horde, maybe one with cops against the prison. great video as always
Yes this is the best place for a pre built base. I used it without upgrading it for 3 horde cycles. I was on day 317 using that base tell part of the inside that had my crafting things like forges and cement mixers and farm got reset. My outside wall was still up but that made me quit along with no updates for a year. I might comment a pic if the base under here
@Capp00 I just wanted to ask if you could do a video idea I just had, that being the refurbishing of the Prison, or other POI's in 7 Days To Die. Also I think everyone else who does 7 Days to die videos should band together and help support 'The Fun Pimps' if anyone knows anything about coding please see if it is at all possible to get Alpha 16 running on console, maybe even a fundraiser of sorts. Sorry I got carried away with ranting, I Like all your Videos.
Do zombies just...Expire? I’ve definitely been around zombies and they just drop dead after a while. I’m playing on the console version
Me and my brother have been using the prison for horde night for nearly 100 days and it's still going strong. We've built a second exterior wall with spikes and we've started on some catwalks between the towers with a tree and plant farm and a mine in the middle and the mine leads to and underground bunker
Hey Capp, do you use any kind of visual enhancers (Similar to what you'd do in fallout with reshade). Your game looks a bit crisper then mine despite my settings being maxed, I need to know your secret.
The only place in real prison where there are no doors are the bathroom..??
dont you mean glock. as you both speak the same.
god test and i have used the prison as a perma/horde base before and nothing got in only thing i did was put wood frames all the way rounds so i could kill em all lol
what happened to your subsitence playthrough? It's such an underrated game, please play more.
Is this a worst case scenario test where you got caught out during horde night without weapons that’s why you weren’t shooting from the catwalk all night?
Yeah if you want to make this a base your going to have to go around and place wood frame blocks where all the zombies spawn points are because just putting your bedroll down doesn't work. The prison is bigger than the bedroll safezone of 15x15 so if you block all the spawn points with the wood frame blocks then you can live here easily.
issue with the prison and with all premade buildings, is sleepers... it seems safe, but, go exploring and return to a prison full of tenants... and lower levels ok, but on higher levels... hehe. well its gona be fun!
The roof of Zoes , has a ladder on the outside to get up, I break the bottom step, so the zombies can't get up. Zoes has buttresses, all around the outside for sight lines down the walls that are I believe 6000 hit points each. Also Joe's building site, the platform near the top of the building has a girder extending out to the part of the crane, that does not collapse, when you or the zombies knock down the main part. If you stay up on the crane, the zombies just run around under you during a horde night. Even if you stay on the platform beside the crane, the zombies do little to no damage to the girders holding up the building, they just run around the girders, looking for a way up.
I used to live on top of that building. Very easy to defend!
Good vid man, I can't wait to have a pc that can handle this game well, been playing on console but building a beast in about a month.
TL;DR warning The best building armor in this game is air. To exploit this, your blood moons should be fought on platforms outside the reach of anything but barf or fliers. Start by finding some reasonably flat terrain. Build a solid, flat foundation on top of that, and slope up to it with shallow ramps. Using 5x5 or 7x7 pillars, construct a ring around the outskirts of your foundation, four to each side (12 total). The hollow interiors will house electric fence posts triggered by trip wires, saving an enormous amount of power. Access for drawing cables between the pillars can be created with a sideways hatch on a fence post without compromising structural integrity, and preserve the posts from stray damage. Lay barbed wire flat to your foundation in a ring beneath the electric fence. In the center of the platform, build a keep to your liking, and protect the keep and pillars from spider climbing by skirting them with inverted spikes. Any ground-level surface that isn't an open access point should also be skirted with spikes. Stretch a catwalk network between it and the pillars. This is where you'll fight your blood moons, standing over open space on catwalks just outside the reach of the dozens of zombies constantly milling about beneath you. If a friend can stand on the open-air catwalk across from you, you both can shoot at the zombies beneath each others' catwalks. With enough ranged cover, you can realistically send a looter down to gather supplies before corpses disintegrate. You may want a ramp entrance from outside your facility to avoid zombies breaking down a ground-level door, and a way for you to get your bikes in and out of your base. Random hordes may approach from any direction, and most of them will either die, lose limbs on a pass into and out of the space between your pillars and keep. For day-to-day activity, place things like campfires and forges inside your keep, but not at ground level (which shouldn't have a door anyway). Build your pillars up a bit higher, and construct a flat platform ring around their tops. Then place a dirt ring on top of that. Instant farm. (5 dirt wide for a 7x7 pillar). If need be, build up higher and construct a second farm ring on top of that. Sunlight will reach the lower layers as long as you don't wall them in, but one farm ring should be enough. __The reason I bring this up is that with modifications, the prison can be the perfect template for this style of base.__ Of course, PVP will change things up a bit. If 100% claim blocks are on, you can build yourself a nice tunnel network outside the base and place difficult-to-spot spiderholes, using soft materials, from which to snipe at players probing your base's defenses or engaged with your allies. If you would like a sniper tower, "wood windows" provide a nice dazzle camo effect and make it difficult to spot people in the tower. A few can be rotated out to shoot from. Not much experience in destructible base mode, but I would be more inclined to hide.
Great video I had a similar experience when I held up in the police station one night. They broke through the concrete walls but couldn't get through the cell door. It was funny
You can go into the towers above the cells
I always try to base in a prison ????
I was turning the prison into a base towards the end of A15, it's pretty solid but one important thing to note is to place player-made blocks everywhere... Zombies spawned inside on the other end of the prison and got me D: Also make sure to build against Spider Zombies, they got me the second time X'D Great vid as always Capp!
@Capp00 do you know of anyway to fix the chunk glitch in a random gen world. This is my second random gen that got ruined by this glitch.
Idea for a few episodes. Maybe after you do a few of these, you go back and redo an old one, but with a far later day horde, like a 200ish one, and see if they could hold up in later games
Have you tried the house on stilts in the middle of one of the lakes for a horde night?
great vid as always tks capp
Guess what isnt out yet.... 17.
Hi Cap, can you test that can burnt forest alter regular forest?
Hey wild idea what about a jail door "wall" zombie defense base. Where all the walls are the jail doors. Just a thought I might have to try myself. ??
I've used the prison poi a lot, and I can tell you its a great place to hold up for a little while, but on random maps its often built on top of sand. :( Which means if you build any trenches or use earthworks the moment the zombies ddig under the walls then you've got a serious issues on your hands.
Still want you to try and shoot down the air drop plane.
You should dock Sylvia’s pay.
u deserve so many more subs!!!
Nice video Capp.
To be fair this is not a solid test. U did this for day 35 hord. Now try day 140 and ur already in quite a different story.
Capp attack
#Capp00 U should try the Colosseum across from the school as a horde base
How about trying fall damage with max height difference? like.... +50 blocks high/up/into the air base down to bedrock? Maybe that'd affect some zombies that took no damage in the previous fall damage video.
do you have t-bag reflexes? 2:43 3:38 11:20
Can you make a tutorial how to put own make buildings in world seed generator archive? If already you make it, pass me the video,my intention is make replicas of other famous game scenarios and share with everyone. Thx a lot.
How can you play 60fps full resolution?
Now I want a pc badly,this game on pc looks and is better,we'll most games are
Lol the safest place on pc is the trader,you can live in the trader during night if you modify the closing time,must be funny seeing a day 7 horde just trying to get on but are punching essentially bedrock
Some paint, a couple of smg turrets, and maybe a bit of air freshener and it would make a neat castle/fort. :)
Damn you Sylvia! After everything Capp has done for you, you continue to betray
Friday evening.. a glass of 12 year Glenfiddich.. and the newest Capp video! now thats a good way to start the weekend :) great video Capp!
Me and my m8 made a base from the jail pritty cool whit a spike pit around it mini bike garage small mine and 2 walk ways the orginial small rebuild to that and one around the tower 's :D Sadly we cant play long some times ....:duo bugg:/error :(
I wouldnt stay there anyhow... the ambient sounds there annoy me(im not scared, you are!) Plus the mines in the area, they can make you shit yo pants :D
Heyo, Capp. Love your science vids, mayn! Thank you!
The zombies always go straight to the position of the player. If they can walk under you, all they will do is break through anything in their way towards that position and do no further harm. Some bladetraps under your position will nicely dispose of them. By varying you position a bit, you can guide them around, to prevent one bladetrap bearing it all alone. Put the bladetraps on the iron bars and have a room beneath them, then you can repair the bladetraps through the iron bars from below. The zombies dont care if you are above or below them, they are kinda two dimensional.
The prison is indeed on the console version's
u did my sugestion im gona have to watch ive wonderd how well it would work against a horde for a wile
Roger: One day i'll get that hug in... one day
Really enjoyed the courtesy tea-bagging. ??
Yes
9:05 It's not betrayal if you betrayed her first. #Sylviadidnothingwrong On a more serious note, it's funny that you posted this now, because I just found this for the first time on my single player world the other day. Never seen it in random gen. Cool place though, and good to know it can withstand a horde
Like it. Might make it my main base. Thanks for your time.
So capp00 if you have a wrench you can take the mobile spot lights I took the ones at the missle base lol great video btw
Thanks for the video Capp00. I made this a base once with a garden out front but I forgot where it was located.
Awesome video as always, I was just wondering what if you built a base only from prison cell doors or any other doors, will zombies attack from one direction or will they try every possible door to get you?
Ahhh im feeling so bad because i started in random house and i have a lot of stuff (day 88) and i reinforced it but i want move to prison because it looks awesome and strong
I use that as a base in one of my playthroughs. Not for hordes though because it’s not really set up for that.
Man you should watch this horde video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARfIhypkk3U Worst players ever but damn funny as hell. Funnies shit ever specially if you are a good player like you.They should probably colab with with someone like you to put their shit together:)
Capp00 I would suggest that you test it with a higher Gamestage. On my Day 35 horde I had several Cops, Feral Whites, and Hawaiians. If someone is really grinding the resources, and playing on 2 hour days, they will have a high gamestage, and the above Zombies would do a lot more damage than that weak horde that you had.
Ok
You should do a survival series
Can u pin me
hey Capp great video thank you. I have a premise that you might like to explore. A steel block wall vs a vault door wall. My thinking is as a steel block is 12000 hps it should be better than a vault door. However although a vault door is 8000 it has three layers of 8000. So in theory the door wall should last longer unless the second and third layers degrade faster.
Great video as always, thank you for this. The prison is absolutely amazing as a base, with some fortifications, and clever ingenuity, you can not only double the walls, build catwalks on the exterior, and dig a mine right inside with a farm, it's just too bad that on navezgane, it's way out where it is ??
Zero dislikes that’s how it should be
test if zombies path around ramps on their sides
Very interesting. With the zombies being able to dig with the alpha 17 I am going to have to start thinking creatively with base building. I liked your treehouse vids, maybe I will try that.
At least we know it’s safe to drop the soap
Love the videos man. keep up the great work
The real question is, updates will they ever happen? With Tell Tale shuttin down probably not
Anyone else excited for Alpha 17? Capp's gonna have a LOT of stuff to experiment with all the new features
I found a cave at 1029 S 752 W Can you check it out?
Do you use the simple UI mod with no extra storage?
I don't know about anyone else but this reminds me of a episode in the Walking dead, were the survivors held up base, it's perfect, you got zombies, you got death, what else could you ask for. Thank you Capp for making an great episode, also could you and Glock do a build challenge on the prison, it might be short but I'd watch it. Keep on being you
I find teh prison makes a good starting block, but as is, its not very useful. At the very least i like to add a moat and spikes. You can make some fun mazes/gun trap layouts though :) Happy Friday, hope you have a good weekend
Great video bud! I love the prison. It's secure and durable. Just need some tweaks. ??
Wow really good
11:24 teabagging? :D
Me and a buddy completely redid the prison took forever and a day awesome vid capp #Cappnation
3:40 i love how you did a little teabag lol
Ha!! I built in Prison before I like it!
Superb video Uncle Capp... Please start 'Scavenger' in the next video.. I'm waiting..
Yeah. German Beer. And Capp's Videos. ??
Thank you for the tour! I have not run across the prison yet! Great to get a preview!
Dont mind me asking but uh whats your graphic settings for 7 days to die coz im running my game on good quality specs and the game kinda looks dark even in the brighter part of the day.
Is this like a mod for skyrim or on the same engine??
I wish the console version looked this good
I've never played this game been considering buying it this video was very helpfull great work
Awesome!
Your voice is dope.
why didnt you check the box right above the entrance at the traders.... or the box in the right corner.... just curious could of been some good stuff in the munition boxes
good job
chujowa gra
I’m calling alpha 17 in February
i am going to watch this tonight i almost fell asleep to passionlips ‘sweet dreams’ beat cause it was so good but i will watch this now
I like this just got ps4 game of this
I like how you clipped this video. :) Looking forward to the next.
Hello Sir. Greetings from the UK. I have been following you now on your channel for well over six months and I just wanted to say, as a fan of this game, both on PC and console, I love your 'series' videos and enjoy watching the challenges you set yourself on this game. Very entertaining channel and I cannot wait for Alpha 17, to play myself and also to see what you will get up to. Keep up the great content mate. Cheers
is 64 enemies standard. i am back into 7 days im looking for a challenge but dont want to spend a month figuring out what a reasonably good player should set the setting to. anyone have suggestions? thanks.
YESSSSSSS! If only PS4 7 days to die was like this
Please do me a favor and put your night vision goggles on so you have at least 1 more spot open in your inventory.
Wait, what? No trader? Why the heck not? Its compatible with the 'Ramblin Man' theme, you find them, use them, move on. Maybe just use each one once, then mark them with an X on your map?
You forgot to Show Loot ON.
Very cool! I love starting new games in random gen and wandering. Don't overlook snow berries as a food source. You can eat 3 safely in a row every 1/2 hour or so in-game. Great way to keep you topped off between meals as you're rambling around.
I'm surprised you didn't take advantage of the secret well at the Traders to scavenge some of the stuff you can find there.
Awesome challenge. Glad theres another series up and going. Can't wait to see where this leads.
Nice new idea Glock
I decided to set up a world to torture myself I lasted 2 days it was insane difficulty zombies set to always run 200% block durability 50% loot
You said no crafting a storage, but why not use existing cabinets or other things?
You left a backpack in the first cabin you looted
Aside from the caveat about traders, this is more or less how I spend my time in the first 28 days or so. I try to plant a tree fort near one of those forge house POIs, then I roam around between bloodmoons. By day 20 or so I have plenty of mats to begin a serious fortification. I dont ramp the difficulty though, it just turns the Zeds into bullet sponges and "it takes longer" is not my kind of hard mode. Come A-17 I plan to expand on that by using the new vehicles and setting up a multiplayer server. I envision a clan using copters to scout for roaming hoards, bikes to skirmish and loot and at least one jeep to carry the nightly fortifications and other supplies. moving in a nomadic circle, following the respawn cycle around the map.
Lord knows i was born a ramblin man. Allman Brothers. Love it!
Another great series! So when you get the minibike, are you going to be living out of that storage as well or still just the backpack?
Looking forward to this series. Good stuff brother.
what happened to scum
So Glock just a suggestion for you... for a survival scenario where you don’t stay in one area and never build or store I would advise you to just go with full survivor and smelt everything you can into useable stuff... Iron into forged iron, led into bullet tips, brass into casings etc.
Me and my friend have done this challenge with not staying in the same spot. We also add the rule that we can not build or place any blocks unless we found frames inside of crates. We do use storage if the building has it.
woulda been better if you could use the trader.. you know, sell him those weapon parts, and buy food cans, water, in retrurn
Whenever you try a new modpack you should try Ravenhearst Insane cause me and my friend are playing that right now we are at day 4 or 5 it's Scary cause there are Scary New Zombies/Monsters
Looking forward to this season
I think 50% loot and not being able to use the trader is a bit much, doesn 't make sense to me except to make things harder for some reason. Love the series though! No hobos ever shopped when they had money?
Best of luck mate hope you do well this should be a good challenge you
After the first 30 seconds I was excited because you put the loot abundance on 50% and I’ve never watched someone do that
This reminds me a little of The Road Challenge in which you can only use things harvested on, next to, or reachable by a road. In addition you have to sleep on or next to one as well..
Love this idea! crazy hard :)
If you went down the well at the trader you'd get some good stuff
Got an idea from this I am going to try. Calling it Stumped, Trashy Vegetarian. Only veggies allowed for food. Can't only take what is found in trash or stumps. Can search other places, but not take unless in trash or a stump. What it comes down to is if someone might possibly own that item, then it can't be taken. Cars are off limits which will make it nearly impossible to get a Minibike. Going to be hard to refuel it as well. Nests are fine to scavenge, but not those inside a dwelling or shed. I don't expect to live more than a day or so because of the veggie rule, but what the heck?
always look forward to your series Glock.
good idea man, good first day, alpha 17? never heard of it, lol
This looks great. I'm not a big builder - it bores me. Are you going to put something outside each house to remind you that you have stayed there? After a while those houses start to look alike :)
don't keep brass or lead or plant fiber. your inventory space is too valuable to waste on those.
hey i did a play thru when i ran strait to the wasteland biome and never left...super hard..did it in nav gain so the bio was big..if a17 drags that might be a option for ya
Series like these are WAY more enjoyable than the house flipper series.
Love the idea man. You have some awesome gameplay! Glad to have been here since a few thousand subs!
I think you need a buddy to drag along like needs gaming has Simon . I am willing to be that person I love the game and already have a great name dollar bill blog a baby
no storage??? no staying in the same place?? no forge???? LOL, gl
You are deffinitly one of my favorite 7dtd gamers would like to see you do a modded series
not really big into making no containers but IF your going to use Workbenches and stuff, you should use Found containers, I think loot should have been normal.
I'm glad you're doing this series, I hope it stays around ?? When you first mentioned the idea, I really liked it and started a game, so it will be cool to see how you approach it.
It's a great start to a new series. Can't wait to see more. It's definitely a challenge I would love to try sometime.
Hi Glock, you should check out Patrol Gaming. He started a series very similar to this last week, he's called it The Hobo Series. Its good.
I've been trying to watch this episode comfortably but I've been shopping with the Mrs for the last two hours! Wish me luck guys!
This seems like a great challenge! You can also cancel quests on the quest page. There's a button that looks like an exclamation point with a crossed out circle.
The workbench was destroyed at the trader and that forge might be too. I'd say there's only about a 10% chance any crafting station you find in the world is functional in A16.
Does insane difficulty up your chances of finding better gear? Finding a iLvl 300+ club, a mining helmet and night vision in a single area, I would assume yes? lol.
That's going to be quite a challenge, going to enjoy watching that... Are you using any mods, or is it vanilla?  Do zeds not smell meat in your inventory anymore, or did they remove that mechanic from the game?
Will he be able to use a minibike basker?
Dude you're crazy with all your rules hahaha. Cool idea though man
This new series means no aloha 18 this year!
ZOMBIES ALWAYS RUN! This is too easy. But still, I love ya vids.
Excellent first day! This is going to be fun!
My week is made knowing that you started another 7 days campaign so quick! I was worried there would be a lull in time before seeing a other video Just another reason why I love your channel ?
Putting brass and lead in desk seems to break storage rule
You put a lot of restrictions on yourself. Wear the NVGs to free up an inventory slot! I also think that you may be making it too hard on yourself with the no trader rule, but it's your game.
I just watched it and I was wondering where the next episode was, then realized you just uploaded this one today. I am dumb
Here's another challenge for you: Put yourself in the top left corner of the map, so extreme North West, as far as you can go. So basically use "teleport -1950 1950". And then "settime 1 4 0" to begin at dawn on the first day. Then start heading South East. When you get to the extreme South East corner of the map, mark your time, in game days, hours, and minutes. Then your fans can try to beat that time with the same seed and identical conditions. The rules are: you can take any route you want. Take shelter as needed. Scavenge and craft as you go. But if you die, you're out. It's approximately 5 1/2 kilometres from corner to corner. The guy who gets to 1950 -1950 the fastest, wins. Edit: I just tested this challenge out with the seed "CornerToCorner". I made it by 8 pm on day 2.
Why not just smelt the brass and things in the forge now?
im at school!
That is an amazing challenge looking forward for the next episodes
Is Ramblin Man a reference to the Allman Brothers?
You need a trader, so does this mean you cant use your storage on your mini bike ether? No storage sounds kinda lame and unfun in my books.
Love the new series
You can wear the NV goggles with your mining hat Glock. It counts as a pair of Glasses, not a helmet or hat <3 Lovin the series and happy to see you open with a new one cx Cant wait to see what you get into!
Hey 50% loot and u get this OH Vraccas
Nomad type of game eh? I'm not sure about the no trader thing. Barter has always been a part of humanity.maybe just no secret stash and no putting points in barter ?
Love the concept! Hardcore survival...nice!
Wear the night-vision ... saves you space.
Liked this before I even watched it..This dude knows the game inside out..Greatest game ever for me..Keep them coming sir..
i did the same but also some more things i did and you should also add: 1: you are not allowed to use shotguns. 2 ak-47 and silenced cannot be used with more than 50 bullets (except from the magazine loaded) per day, and 3: you must craft at least one gun before the first bloodmoon or you break your leg-by doing this you learn how to advance quickly. if you agree with any of these please add them. the 3rd one is the most difficult.
What about mini bike basket? Id say its fair game to use but thats just me.
Great first day!
It's truely a challenge, though i think you should allow yourself chests. Not like a central depot, since you will be moving all the time. But if you search a bunch of houses, you would drop all the stuff at one place and decide in the end what to take away. With 30 days until respawn i wouldn't count these as a depot. Or, regarding the forge, why not leave the melted stuff in it or closeby? Real hardcore otherwise would be like - you are not allowed to use the forge at the same place twice, meaning you have to disassemble it and take it with you. In the end it's your rules, and you always make it an adventure to watch you. And since you promised to play this way already, don't change it, but maybe be a little nicer to yourself next time.
I love this series already
Your gonna die lol
Just a thought, doesn't that type of trader post have 2 munitions boxes? Should be a room above the main gate with one, and one in a watch tower in the back corner.
7 Days to Die: Nomad's Land
Glock, I'm curious if you take a peek at the random gen worlds you use in your series, not so much memorizing or trying to map it out, just a quick overview to make sure it isn't full of water?
Sooooo, Alpha17? Do you know anything? I recall you mentioning something about September...
I think you should put most of your skills into scavenging, will be more useful than crafting on the go.
I don't agree with your take on not trading - if anything that is more what a ramblin man would do! Very fun new series idea though, I'm going to start one up myself! Cheers!
Great video bud! The difficulty settings change the amount of hp the zombies have. Can't wait for the update
Why are you using POI? Current or prior Military or just something you picked up from games? Just a rarely heard acronym outside military circles.
Always get a boneshiv from your first zombie!
Awesome new show man, keep it up!
Don't forget to put on your NVG.. you have no other glasses on and they'r takin up a spot in inventory.
I'd call that a good first day. I like this form of challenge. Not staying at the same POI more than once will definitely make it harder.
Holy hell! Tough, tough rules here man
Can we have longer videos please Glock?. 45 mins like GameEdged does always seems more enjoyable
Yeah, hardcore baby. I was hoping you'd do this hardcore version of nomad style. Looking forward to this series.
Any stipulations on the mini bike when you get 1? Like no basket for storage etc
Awesome to see a new series! Any chance of another Scum video? Looks like an interesting game but is there a storyline or objective besides survive? (Singleplayer wise that is)
This looks really cool I think you should utilize the traders though, almost a caravan type trader. I think it would help keep the series viable.
This is an amazing idea for a series, well done.
Another 7days restart, this shit aint gonna keep your channel alive. its time to move on.
hmmmm, this rambling man series doesn't appeal to me, but wish you the best in it, glock9.
Hi Glock, this look awesome, question tho, why don't you put on the night vision and open up a spot and i agree with some one else said you should be able to use the trader because nomads and such would use trader/store ETC for supplies and such, keep em coming and of course Tigress Hugiess!!!
Glock has become my zombie guy on YouTube
Awesomeness! Thanks for keeping us entertained as we wait for A17.
Why don't you just make a series Play it until a17 make it always run no airdrops make it like a real scenario if the world came to an end you wouldn't have any airdrops you only can use the stuff you find and make
Putting the brass and lead in the desk would be utilizing storage and breaking your own rules
Remember to search tree trunks for honey
My friend, you should use the stone shovel on stones in the beginning to bring your mining tools up, the stone axe only affects your construction tools. Common mistake.
Good episode. This will be a good series. Although, I do think you should rethink the trader thing because if you think about it, rl world backpackers will use stores for things such as food and stuff. Also, the trader might be your saving grace...just a thought.
Will we celebrate your 80th birthday around the time Alpha 17 launches?
You may have checked this but are you sure that the forge is not a destroyed forge? Also, did you notice that the workbench at the trader was a destroyed workbench?
If it's on insane why are they walking I thought they run all the time? Correct me if I'm wrong.
You should try out the starvation mod to ramp up the difficulty. I think you'll love it. Got eaten by an alligator on my last run while fleeing from a feral, busting my legs in the process.
Ah ,earliest i've ever been woohoo on plenty of series before A17 Glock :D
Like this comment if you think glock should live stream these before he uploads
Will you at least get to use the basket on your mini bike when you get one? i vote yes as it travels with you.
Hello glock you are the best YouTuber good luck
I love your videos
You forgot to turn on airdrops you always say to turn them on but you always forget to turn them on
Glock m8...how many new series will you make...?
New series
Whee..... A new series.... Please don't make it Perma-Death..
Yay new series!
hi
Im new to this game do tutorial plz
is it youtube or when you start riding the bike you kinda start to lag
Nice super. Well done bro all very cool shot!
una pregunta  ya salio la alpha 17  alguien sabe cuando saldra 
do you ever play valmod its amazing basically alpha 17 lol so many more recipes... lock picks you can craft for gun safes.. more guns.. red bull to drink and run 100-mph ...just sooo much more than vanilla the list goes on and on.. more zombies... bigger backpack...legendary itemsgunstools
if they improve the graphics i would come back but there just to dated for me
can i enjoy the game without any people is this online i donyt have anybody to play with tho but i like games like dayz
I’m actually disappointed that you’ve never seen that trader, he is the first, the official,the original Trader Joel the owner of the business
What the balls man
The half-life within which uranium-238 falls to lead-206 is 4.46 billion years. After 4.5 billion years (the alleged age of the Earth), there would have to be at least the same amount of lead as uranium on the surface. Of course, there are elements that have even longer half-life. Since the common man can imagine these unimaginably long periods poorly, the current leadership of physics is considering introducing a new SI time unit. Here, the scale of the elapsed time no longer counts the years, but the time the Funpimps need to get from one Alphastate to the next. The so somewhat awkwardly abbreviated unit with the name 7D2D-A2A describes thus much understandable half-lifes of e.g. thorium for which were previously accepted 14.05 billion years, now simply with 1.33742 7D2D-A2A.
Love the channel. Does anyone know how to reduce the minimum value for player Heath under 70 in the xml files I'm trying to make a mod but I'm stuck in this and can't find it anywhere. Thanks for the help
can you break all those washer down for electric and mechanical parts
Awesome video!
At 1730 there is a well bunker house off to the right good loot
wooo you finally drove by the town I set up my main base in...btw the trader is the snow biome...there's another very close to the west same biome
That trader is even on Navezgane, not far from where I usually make my first base. Not super common in RWG, but they do pop up.
Sell Machety knifes !
Ah good thing you teamed up with Baryshnikov the augerologist!
Kickz i dont believe That the blue building with the double roof is a thing in vanilla...
Kickz why why WHY do you loot with full inventory when your bike inventory was empty It just hurts my soul!
It's trader Joe. House
If your wellness under 100 which it was eating a meat stew will give its max wellness (+5) taking u to 103 ) and trader was selling 1.
That's one of the great things with this game - even with all the hours you've put in, you can still find new POIs that you haven't seen like that trader (and yeah, the one with the towers and the secret underground bit that you were thinking of is the one that spawns in the snow biome). Sadly the blue house you were hoping to find (yeah, we know what you're looking for ;) ) is from compoPack (and you're right - running animals over with the bike is a mod only thing as well - it got removed from vanilla when they went from A15 to A16 - one easy way to tell (because it's part of a small pack of bike fixes that several mods use) is if you can open your map (or inventory) while you are on the bike, then you should also be able to run over animals (and zombies)).
My NightsDays are max length and i have set to have 32 zombies and medium-low dificulty D A fun game, when i finish the base will change to medium hard.
I never sell SMG S
traders at 577, 567 and just to the north east, 430, 1018
lol this is the town i started at
Your're really dependent on that auger. I make subways with whatever tools i need if i have cement mixers. I have stone for days and night travel is easier. Sure, it is a buttload of grind, but the stone is worth it. That laundry mat looks like a good place for an early horde base.
Who else rewind the video to see kicks reaction when he found auger in the secret stash
Another trader at 1024n 1142w
If the trader has a bookcase behind him you can actually loot it.
Mr Kickz this is the tunnel I was talking about httpswww.youtube.comwatchv=BX-3oaopGic&t=6s
I do not know about pc, but on console you can run over zombies and animals with the minibike and kill them. It could also depend on the version being played, maybe I have a video of the 1st base that me and my roommate built, on my channel. It is from a few years ago, when I 1st got into the game. Never finished it, but it worked for every horde night we did until we started a new game
Good video
kickz has never been to that trader that i know of, i've watched all his episodes since alpha 15.2 starvation mod. also finally on the auger and that blue house is not in vanilla.
I play on console so not sure if all things are the same. But I search the empty tree stumps and get guns, gun parts, food and clothing. And that desert with the high hills could be good for oil shale. Dig ground level into the side of it. I've found shale at all different depths, but seem to find most at -33 and deeper. I'm always mining for it. And that trader is my favorite. Such a nice guy. Lol. If I get lots of gun parts on a loot run, I assemble them just to clear room in inventory, then disassemble at trader. I run over any animal and zombies when they aren't looking. Takes a lil away from bike strength
Kickz the blue house your looking for isn't a vanilla spawn, its modded
You should tear down the tents to get cloth it's annoying to sell but they take up to 1500 cloth at atleast 3 dollars a piece and selling em 1 by 1 raises barter quick
Im playing on same seed and The City you have found today is were i started There is police station next to big crack book
Funny story about those oil refineries A few months ago myself and 2 friends were looting one of those buildings. We'd just gotten bikes and stumbled across it and decided to grab as much fuel as possible while we could. As per we swept the building clearing it of zeds before we got to looting it. Just as we got back downstairs, to the room where u got all the barrels from, we hear a lot of banging on the door that construction guy came in. I got this, don't worry. says one of my friends. She heads to the door we turn to grab the barrels. Next thing we know she's shouting her head off and I see her run straight past me closely followed by 6 feral wights (Benny Hill style). The 7th one clocked me and before I could react, due to laughing so hard, took a running swing at me. Fortunately he missed me, unfortunately he did hit the barrel I was stood in front of about to collect when this fracas started, which subsequently exploded, which in turn caused the barrels surrounding it to also explode killing all 3 of us and the server. A quick restart later (sarcasm it took nearly an hour lol) and we load back in on our beds as expected. Being just down the road (10 mins on bike) we decided to grab our back up gear and head back to retrieve everything we'd lost. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the spectacle of witnessing the explosion again, from outside this time, 4 more times as after each explosion the part of the building that got blown out, repaired itself and a couple of seconds later would explode again. We still haven't retrieved our bags.
If you aren’t using Compo pack you won’t have that blue building
There's no blue house in vanilla. Oil shale machine was a thing in Starvation.
I don't know if anyone has noticed but the dihong tower said slow sounds like dies young.
A while back you could run over game entities. I remember you doing it a few times, but it was some time ago.
Kickz, I've been commenting for about a year, for you to go loot the Oil Refineries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you should look for a trader just south of the dessert town ;)
Oh hey, that's the trader where I got an Auger on Day3 D
Gesundheit
Also, be sure to check the bookcase behind where the trader is standing. Sometimes it has schematics in it, and there’s a bunker in a well in one of the houses near the academy, in town.
I bet your took smithing is pretty high, you can make a new auger blade! Great video!
That’s my city and my trader! He’s actually the nicest trader I’ve ever been to. D
The only thing from laundry is when you just need a lot of parts you can rip down all the machines.
I think the point of the laundromat is to level up your scavenging skill quickly looting all the machines
kickz you have auger but do you know how to repair it and all  if you don't, auger only good until it breaks
probably this serie will get 200 episodes before alpha 17 releases
I think the blue house is only in War of the Walkers Kickz
The crates you hate is the random shipping crates, and just the name give it away, so it would be that they need to remove,
Kickz the blue house with the ammo crates is not in vanilla!
Do you guys feel like Alpha 17 is never coming
We have them in consol version
You never seen that Trader! I've found them on my console games which means they've been around since A15 haha
In my opinion you should paint the second row grey bricks like the first row.
i hear from some one that A17 is comming next year , i hope not but if it is then we have to wait a little bit more
You could make a “waffle and grind” series and I would still watch it. ??
When alpha 17 comes out you could build a base like the trader and try surviving i did it on my xbox one it is very challenging by best base i every had i got to day 150 before my console crashed
4 years later and the game looks exactly the same.
Just keep coming back to this
0:06 wuts the song name? I remember hearing that song a long time ago
“I’m about to thirst to death” (Gavin Free)
you just have it in your inventory and hit cook and it comes out in output it's easy once you get used to it
Jesus fuck when one of you guys said o there's a horde coming I shit you not I look out the window of the place i'm looting and I see a horde passing by. lol wtf
Ryan and jack, you never know who is talking because they sound EXACTLY THE SAME
Crazy how the old version of 7 Days is much better than the new version.
16:35 lol all them beating on that zombie reminds me of this https://youtu.be/W4tVH7BPb-Q?t=78
This game have come a long way, I remember that radar.
The progress this game has made is awesome unlike some other zombie survival game (cough cough) dayz standalone
nice to see you keep it up to date, thank you very much
This game looked bad 3 yrs ago
Who else is re-watching this series in 2017?
two full guns in s safe; the good ol days till those retard developers decided to ruin it with updates
Not bad its entertaining but I have never been a fan of time cuts in LP vids because it leaves out stuff like where you guys found a sledgehammer and stuff and what led to the hole thing starting. Also maybe an indicator that shows who is talking?
This game changed a lot OMG!
God i miss this version of 7 days god i would pay 100's to get it
i'm so glad they came back to this
Just watched the other videos of 7D2D, and now how is Geoff the first one with an axe?
amazing that they are still making videos with this game 3 years later. Also the game has come a long way in 3 years.
This game looks different now. Much better.
its amazing how far this game has gone, it's so much better now, not that it was bad during this build
That potted plant shoulda been a shirt 'I take him everywhere with me'
Had to come back an watch some old 7 days to die. Love watching them play this. Can't get enough! Almost 2 million views? Nice!
9:45 GameSocietyPimps
Just realized the house they're in at 32 mins looks almost exactly like the one they use in their latest Let's Play.
Watching this again i realized Geoff was much better before in this game than he is now!
This game looks way better now in 2016.
Watching this after recently finishing 7 Days of 7 days to Die and it's really amazing how far this game has come. I've been playing this game off and on for a while now and I'd forgotten just how broken this game was in it's earlier stages. The progression is just so much better now, AH did a good thing waiting to give this game a serious playthrough.
now this is og ah
This game looks so different now!
i remember 2 years ago, seeing that barbed club reminded me of negan. now that thought is even more relevant.
the health/etc bars here are way better than in the update. Wish these developers would leave well enough alone
That game was Nice back in the days
getting hyped for 7 days of 7 days to die
So 11 episodes 9 hours of video BINGE IT!!!!
"I'm gonna dehydration to death" Gavin 2014
2014 "This game is in Alpha still." 2016 This game is in Alpha still.
I like how they went back to this vid to change the title so ppl don't get confused
Wow, I've been playing this on Xbox One and the game is very different now.
Sees barbed club... cries hysterically
spider goats now rabbit dolphins they need to stop messing with nature
Still a more complete game than no mans sky.
wow this games changed so much since it came out on console.
quick survival tip for you end of days survivors dont fuking eat rabbit without a fat
Man I forgot how different it was...
better than the updated version with the stupid fucking schematics, as if this game wasn't hard enough
Definitely one of their best series
22:32 Go Gavin! Dig down to China and get help!
shovel your ass
The characters look like Ted Danson
did they change the title of this video?
They were a lot quieter back then
it's disappointing looking at how smart the zombies are here and how dumb and boring they are in console
how come the pc looks different?
Who's this Roy guy? /s
"breaking rocks in the hot sun, I FOUGHT the LAW, and THE LAW WON."
Game looks so much better on PC.
Jesus this let's play came out two years ago...
After more than two years of development, I think they've actually managed to make this game worse. Still a ton of fun to watch, but having owned it for a while now, it's not really that fun to play...
did they add pc to the title?
I decided to try the 3 way bacon burger from Hardee's... The experience was very underwhelming, not worth the money
Oh they changed the names of the videos. it now says "for PC."
I liked when Gavin started digging, Jack made a joke about Hogan's Heroes.
After watching the new one it makes me want ray back to the crew :(
9:45 - 9:57 does that house and barn look very similarly to where Geoff and Jeremy were in the new video
Saw these a while ago then just saw the new one and now watching these cause they are better
I watch these first then the new one then came back
They changed the title
Years later... still in alpha
They all sounded much different two years ago.
God i miss you Roy..
22:36 Ryan with the Hogan's Heroes reference that probably no one in the office got, and maybe only 1% of the audience will get. And I thought I couldn't like Ryan more. I was wrong
Damn, it's been over two years since this video came out :/
wait....wheres lil j?
I just noticed that whoever edited this did a bad job. It could just be that some of AH didn't do a good sync but the editors should have noticed and fixed that.
I fell asleep with this in the background and I wake up to an rt podcast commercial???? anyone else have this?
Intro music?
Who else is watching this after seeing the new one
Nostalgia brought me back.
Just watched their recent upload playing this on the console and instantly came back to watch this video again lol
WOW, two years ago???
sucks Michael missed out on this amazing lets play series
no offense but your tareble at this game
i would probably play this game but it is so ugly i just cant bring myself to buy it
i miss ray
so half way through the video i thought it was the xbox version and that ray was just a special guest, now ive realised what it really is...
You gise can play it on Xbox one!
they need to do a new lets play in this game
26:54 Ryan's Daryl DIXON
25:17 Jack's Negan from the walking dead
i miss ray :c
Can we come back to this please? Like, now that this is on xbox, id love if you guys played it every once and a while!
"She's showing me her growler" ~Gavin Free
this game looks super cheap
anyone else notice the bong at 27:32?
bast game
gavin: "can someone shoot me in the head?" geoff: "where are you gavin?" no hesitation lol. then he asked jack if he was ready to die with his gun pointed
It is refreshing to see and hear everybody being calm, speaking softly, and getting along lovely-like. Shame they probably can't achieve this sort of thing nowadays :/
Do an Xbox lets play featuring Ray
pee band-aid lol
What happened to Ray
While I was watching, I wondered when a console version would come out. I looked it up, and it came out yesterday. What were the chances?
this is my favorite let's play series they've done. I'd love them to come back to it now that the game is on consoles
Watching this in preparation for the console letsplay!
Watching this in preparation for the console letsplay!
Michael needs to be here to tell jack to shut the fuck up
this like the walking dead and ARK
More blueberry pie
i know i'm gonna get hate from this but.... i don't miss Ray. Never really liked him....
I need to know if I should buy this game or not, and I would be buying it on console because my friends don't have PCs
I need to know if I should buy this game or not, and I would be buying it on console because my friends don't have PCs
I just realized after watching this 4 times that namworb is Brownman backwards.
Play this again please and more gmod!!! Love your vids so much!
It'd be great if the Achievement Hunters came back to this game when it comes out on consoles at the end of this month, these lets plays were fun!
So Ryan's Daryl Jack's Negan and Gavin is... Sledgehammer Man?
I miss team lads
man i want them to make this a series when it comes out on console
This series and Prop Hunt are probably my favorite Lets Plays
17:59 oohh eww why Growler? is it angry?
ok so honest question: is this game worth getting or is it another the forrest/minecraft clone ?
What if... They treated it like the walking dead, where they have a big cast, and once someone dies, they're out of the seven days to die lets play series
They really should carry on playing this. It's improved, and I think it'd be a good minecraft replacer for a bit. Honestly so sick of minecraft
jack is negan confirmed
Who else is excited for this game to release on console?
Is this on ps4 as well?
Loved this video. Pleas make another video:)
They announced it on Xbox yay they should start it again on there
"How do I put crossbow in bolt?"
GHOST RAY!!!
This video is nearly 2 years old, feels just like yesterday
Hello from March, 2016
Im so glad Ray hadn't left before this!
Play more 7 days to die, please.
I finally got this running well, I spawned in a charred area and got hit by a burning zombie
Geoff with that blackjack
this game is so much better now, they should play it again now.
i miss ray playing with the rooster teeth group
Wobbly Scraglification?
Should really consider playing this again, it's been improved significantly since this.
hardcore ray. taking out zombies with his fist.
35:13
??????
Love 7 Days to Die
These guys have such generic names haha. I love it.
Nice Video , i like it.
I could've done that with two less redstone
were is Michael?
I wish they would continue this gameplay.
At 3:55 I swear they lowkey missed a supply box
They should totally play more of this game. Minecraft is getting seriously boring. The only thing that is worth watching is GTA 5.
I'm gonna dehydration to death.
46:19 "how do we know he's not infected" -gavin free ;)
more
Forever laughing because ray went "Oh... That's a bandaid... Pee bandaid."
lol thirst to death
You guys can say Jack isnt funny in this video or many others but i dont care he seems funny to me, he kinda reminds me of me when first start playing with someone on another persons server.
I laughed so hard at 10:09 for some reason xD
Hey Gavin, "it puts the lotion in the basket"
Sounds like Seth Rogan
Please more
This was my favorite series
ryan the weapon guy
is it me or do they all look like Marshall from How I Met Your Mother (In The Game)
Really do hope this becomes a recurring series like on a thursday or sunday
Jack is using Lucille, Negan will not be happy
"I've dug a hole, now I'm stood in the hole. I found a shovel and I dug it." Gavin Free...what a minge.
does any one know how they were all able to play in a private game? trying to have my buddy join my world and dont know how
This game sounds kinda fun ya sure it's gameboy
Is Ray Black?
PLease sync
Re-watching old videos... RAY'S BACK, oh wait...
ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY!
Ryan: "It's a lumberjack zombie, look, he's * lumbering * BOMP" Everyone else: * Groans * 5:13
THATS WHAT U GET FOR HURTING A DAWG JACK!!!!!!
Why is Gavin so dume
Why is Gavin so fume
Sorry but I found it hard to sit and watch this "exploration" by newbes. Everyone doing their own thing and everyone's so uncoordinated. People searching stuff others have searched, one person getting killed by a zombie while everyone else does their own thing. And when serveral of you guys attack a zombie, I saw some really lame attacks. Come on, it's only one lame ass slow zombie! WTF??
are you guys using TEAMSPEAK? you sound so clear where as we have echos and delay
How is it that Gavin seems to make smart decisions (making a sledgehammer and annihilating zombies) and still looking like an idiot (Letting his food, water, stamina AND health literally go to shit?)
Couldn't you drink from water with your fists back then?
What gaming system are you using?
It is confirmed, zombies love nobs
The beginning of the derpiest adventure ever.
Can someone help me I'm trying to find the lets play series they did where Gavin collapsed the roof is that this one?
Oh Ray....
Who else is in the 1,337,000+ club?
Bought this game a week ago... Found a guy Killed him Took over his house 10/10 would rek again
I don't get why people loved these lets plays so much
I love that jack is like a little kid with a parent during the whole beginning of the video, and anytime he lost ryan he stopped and started freaking out XD
"Ugh, she's showin' me 'er growler" - I lost my shit.
More
This reminds me of unturned
Ray "Theres 4 zombies, we're probably gonna die instantly." Just wait until its night
I hope they put out more Seven Days to Die videos. And I feel like that house at scenic overlook would've been more secure- made of stone, an upstairs, and a ladder to the roof for sniping.
Best moments are when they all go into some impromptu singing stuff.
Hhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiii
anyone else think they need to bring back this series??
Who else thinks the way the animals run is funny
Soooo... Are they going to finish all seven days?
*me screaming at my computer because Ray had a cooking pot the whole time they needed food*
Of course. A zombie dog just had to be a Doberman. Haha.
MARK NUUUUUT
Please do more of these would be better since the updates
please give me link download 7 days to die craced :)
"I'm gonna wack it in the ass with a sledge hammer!" Funniest moment haha
Im hear son
May name is gavin
38:00 "THERS A HORD!" most people are like "OH NO!" I'm like "the mini map makes the hord look like a penis" LOL
You guys should continue this and make its own play list c: you guys are great
Aw, no Michael. Not amused :(
god i miss this
If you try hard enough, you can get this feeling that Jack and Ryan are the same person just talking to themselves sometimes
Check out my lets play video
For all you guys who like the relaxing Let's Plays - have any of you ever listened to any of the great ASMR videos on YouTube?
Why is everyone saying this game is shit? Yeah the graphics aren't amazing, because it is in alpha.  This isn't a massive AAA title like Grand theft auto or Battlefield.  They don't have millions of dollars to spend on graphics and an engine. The game plans to have a massive graphical overhaul in the near future. Graphics play a very small part in a game. There is Enjoyment, how much fun you have playing the game on your own or with friends, story, content, how many players is fairly important if you want to play multiplayer. The more people who buy the game the more money the devs can afford to splurge on graphics. Think about it. Remember when the first COD came out? Or the first battlefield? Where the graphics amazing? No but people still played them. Then companies started making big money and improved the games.
I PICKED UP A CHAIR
This was such a great series.
So cool love this vid!
Another video?
i wish they'd play more games like this, or dont starve together. I am so over minecraft and getting sick of GTA crap
"There's a horde coming" "What do you mean" "I mean there's a horde coming" Hahaha??
MOAR!!!
Been playing this, it's changed so much since this episode.
SILLY MEN FUNNY MEN!
ok i have a question when i play this game and log out and come back in i loss all my stuff can someone tell me why thanks
The flag block thing lets have stronger blocks in the area but only for other non alliy players and no zobeies spawn in the area as well.
2:38 That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen and I fucking love it
So ugly game!
I started cracking up when they finally decided to do something about the rotting corpse in the corner of the room.  It's kind of like the post-apocalyptic proverbial "elephant in the room".
In this game, can you create a world to play ONLY with my friends? also by creating world pc/internet has to handle with the players that join the server?
friggen 10,000 BC going on here smashing away at boulders
what settings do they have
Ray has Jarate (its a tf2 reference)
You guys should definitely bring this back. These 4 7days to die lets plays are the best!!
One time I was playing this game and night was approaching while  I was on this farm. Going into the house I saw I had to options; hide in the basement or the attic, remembering the the basement is where that asshole died in night of the living dead while the attic is where the black guy survived I went up there. Come morning I come down from the attic and find the the zombies had completely destroyed the first floor, like there was no floor just the basement.
Solid episode
This vid was purial shite. Thanks.
is it just me but the audio and video is off a bit
As soon as he got that Sledgehammer, Gavin went from group burden to MVP
The only thing I didn't like in this game was that jars disappeared after drinking water.
tish game sucks ryan and so do you. but youre cute says ryan lol telepathic agents on fired job looking for this lol i dunno
MORE!
lol i love rays lack of hope....Gavin: ray hows the lake? Ray: uh full of zombie we'll prolly die instantly.  lol he has a diminshing ray....of hope in the apocalyptic world.
Makin' my way downtown, walkin' fast, Zombies passin'; they're assholes.... >__> I have a love/hate relationship with this game.
gavin the rock punching guy
Add me on skype my 7 days to die wont load please  help me! Skype-Littlehhhtheminecrafter Thanks for helping!
Like Minecraft with guns  10/10  IGN
NARUTO NINJA STORM 3    STEAM ACCOUNT FOR SALE!!!      plus other awesome games  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Black-ops-2-DAYZ-Naruto-Ninja-storm-3-Left-4-Dead-2-PC-GAMES-Steam-Account-/181597386630?pt=Video_Games_Games&hash=item2a480c3786
Gavin is my favorite
i demand part 5!
OMG I just realised Geoff if Griff from RVB. That's why his voice sounded so familiar XD
For some reason, i cant watch any of their videos. All other youtubers work but not theirs. I wonder why
Why the switch every 5 seconds?
The way Geoff says "I made a torch" is literally so adorable.
I have read some comments here that seem to indicate a common thread between this game and the game Rust. For those of you not familiar with Rust, be warned, between the server wipes, absent admins, and RAMPANT cheater / hackers, you will never be able to actually accumulate progress w/o cheating. To be honest, despite all of it's differences, this game doesn't seem much better.
I agree, the sound effects are awesome XD
Is this game coming out for the PlayStation 4 in the future?
I don't get it... if you see that you are in a house with a shit load of zombies why would you go up stairs?
Who's who?
Minecraft rip off
a girl zombie tried to bitch slap ray
PLEASE answer! I just want to know, no matter what you set the 'Enemy Spawning' level to, zombies will ALWAYS spawn? I just want to make sure this isn't one of those games that has a limited number of enemies, i.e. fun.
http://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/2kmbpx/usnew_survival_server_1028_zombies_n_more_us_pvp/ Server Ip = 50.159.228.235 Server Port = 25000
Show me yer growler! ( ?°?????° )
How do you stop the bad 7dtd lag?
Zombies in this game are VERY op ... being able to punch through steel and reinforced concrete . Edit: There is a structure in the desert that is a "gold mine" for scrap. In general normal hoses are very bad places to camp.
you guys really should keep these going their really funy
Awesome
beavis and butt-head
Love Ryan's laugh
I bet the finished product of this game will be as good or even better than minecraft! Maybe not in sales but just an all around better game to play and have fun! It should definitely come to consoles.
36:50 Gavin always wanting to build watch towers on roofs
If you get the game on steam, you can take off zombies because I have it
can you play this as a single player all by oneself kind of game?
bring this back?
please
i imagine it would be hell to play a d&d campaign with them.
how big is the map?
1:02 animal jumping
Gavin: if anyone needs a hole, I'm your guy Ray: you're the hole guy FANFICTIONS AGGRESSIVELY BEING WRITTEN
This would be a lot easier to follow if it didn't have 4 people talking at the same time.
I love how everyone has picked up one another's speech quirks...everyone describes things with British words once in a while or uses Gavin's swears, and around 10:40 or so Gavin uses Ray's usual 'Aha!' I just like to see that after knowing each other for so long they just start to pick up one another's habits.
I can't stand these idiots.
Rust is better
I'd like to see a part 5. The 9.1 update added randomly generated worlds. Just make the B team (kerry,kdin,lindsey,matt,jeremy) get your characters together first.
I know the fanboys will bitch but i dont see a reason to pay for a game like this  it looks ridicules ill stick with the last of us rather then this or day z because its better in  quality make etc ill take better games on console over a lot of games on steam but if you are lucky you can buy som games on al system for less if you catch the sale
dying from a little dog, lame
I have my own single player thing and it's as difficult as it could get and I have survived about 100 days in total over this entire summer
I'm going to buy this game in a few minutes, it would be cool to have some people to play with. Add me on Steam and send me a message to join :)
It's like Minecraft if it was a zombie game and didn't look like shit!
48:01 LOOK OUT THE FUCKING DOOR OMG STFU WTF IS THAT
If anyone needs help getting started or crafting items, Check my Channel! Lots of Tutorials!
great idea for a game, but the graphics are utter shit.
if you already made something you can click on the name and it will atomically make it and it takes less time. just a heads up.
38:00 look at the mini-map. It's a scrotus
Can people watch my 7 days to die videos, there awsome
Can people watch my 7 days to die videos, there awsome
@pro4skill Why the fuck would you want to bang a zombie
Ray "Like Edgar" Ryan "Who?" WTF
Giving away 7 days to die this Saturday 23/8 and more games every weekend up for grabs check out the video on my channel to see how to get that sweet winnery ;)
3:46 LOL
I jsut got this game and my hud looks nothing like this.  Also you can't find where you are on the map.
LMFAO XD I SHOT IT IN THE TUCASE 25:58
hi
Ya... I wish my let's play of this game was this good...
Was this game created by the same people that created the forest ?
+pro4skill the fuck!
I wish there was a game like this but with strangef stuff. Like every tuesday a lady will attack anyone who isn't in a building or something.
The Field of View in this game is too small...90 fov would be nice
This game looks like shit, It'd be funner if they buffed up the graphics.
Xbox?
"Ray, how's the lake?" "Eh full of zombies. We'll probably die instantly". I don't know why but I found it really funny how nonchalantly he replied xD
i really hope this become a weekly series i love these lets plays
Gavin came in like a wreaking ball
If you add each other to your friends lists the others show up on the map
"Hey, guys, does someone want to shoot me in the head an see what happens?"
this lets play has inspired me to play this game not sure if this is good or bad will update as this develops
in the begining when the guy opened the door and all the zombies came. Fuck Me. XD
they finally fixed mine craft so the graphics aren't just blocks
if you play the video at half speed it sounds like they are all stoned
the hispanic had to find the hub caps
7 Days to die or Gmod?
They should play unturned
Its nice to watch actual realible friends. How help each other. Nice vids guys.
After part 4 gavin IS definitely the hole guy
How did gavin get out the hole ? lol
This game is heaps underrated.
jack at 1:21 I found way funnier than I should have
@TodNicholson something like Survivors 3.0 I don't think it ever got updated much, but you may be able to find itm
Wow an hour for the next part and only 20 minutes left of my shift
I just recently started watching these so idk but Jack and Ryan sound EXACTLY the same to me
wow this zombie has huge tits... i feel bad doing this. - ray
No Michael equals good times, he's so annoying.
They really need to update the terrain. flat...hill...flat...hill. lake...flat.. hill. wheres the mountains?
this is what i wanted minecraft lps to be sometimes. me gusta :3
7 days or DayZ?
I love Ray's Get Him To The Greek reference in minute 42.
I love how you hold bullets like magneto
How do people play this for long enough for a let's play series? It randomly crashes on me all the time and I lose much of my progress. It's pathetic.
So at the very end... I just noticed Micheal wasn't in this lets play.
YES A HOGANS HEROES REFERANCE!!!
1. This needs to be on consoles 2. This needs to be a weekly thing.
Get so annoyed with people saying voxel based games are rip off of Minecraft.. This is clearly not ripping of Minecraft and its not trying to. Not to mention Minecraft basically just rips off Castle Miner, Dwarf Fortress and more. Just because something is popular and you like doesn't mean something you don't like is ripping it off.
hey gav she had a knob in her growler
Funny thing, that house they set up shop in, is the same house my gf and I used for our initial BoO
wish i had this...
Why did they think a cabin next to a lake would be a safe idea? Rule 1 of a zombie apocalypse when trying to find a safe location: no cabins in the woods or by a lake.
I cringed every time Ray wasted ammo on that deer.
Okay, I didn't give this lets play a chance, since I'm turned off by alpha stage games, but I decided to give it a second chance, now Im lookin forward to more.
Gavin: I'm going to starve to death and thirst to death. Ryan: you're going to thirst to death?
Does anyone remmeber the lets play that was like slender man, but it had a devil creature as the antagonist, and the achievement hunters were construction workers holding wrenches?? If so please do tell me what the namebof that lets play is
STTTTTYYYYYXXXXX! :D
CHEEEEEEEEESE! XD
site off
I hope they play more of this game!
Why did they skip the night?
just incase anyone wonted to know if u add your friends to ur friends list u can see them on the map if u arnt near it helps when u are trying to find each other
I love let's play's without Micheal's yelling.
Geoff master race
This really reminds me of my first time playing 7 Days To Die; just wandering all of Navezgane, lost, dazed, and utterly confused... good times!
It's so painful watching Jack play... Dx
Gavin is the best
14:47 bookmark
Time to ruin your day: https://imgflip.com/gif/arrty
Omg I got here by http://7daystodie.com/8-8-hotfix-pimp-news-and-alpha-9/ Now you guys have to make a part 4.  You're supported by the creators :)
That low-res corn texture xD lol jk this is better than any game I could make lol
What is this game and what are they doing ?
shout out to hogan's heroes! Also noticed jack thinking about clubbing Ryan near the middle of the video.
What happend to the video where Gavin was playing by himself?
this is the coolest game. glad you guys are playing it.
Make this a new series of let's plays.
ryan is like the roosterteeth version of sips
Is 7 days to die free
YOu can drink from the lake! Use ur hands! D:
12:34 I've watched this 3 or 4 times now on my TV and I still cannot see "them" in the distance
I can't wait for this game to come into beta, there is already so much, and its so fun. It will be great when it's finished.
i was sad when you skipped the first night.
Anyone thinking to buy this game and thinks it is a casual game don't be fooled. I promise you, if you don't find cover at night and a way to defend your self right away. Then this game will fuck you!
I really like this game, there should be mods for this to be without zombies, I'd like it more that way. Like theres a mod of DayZ without zombies, I love that one too.
what program do you use to record 7 days to die because overwolf doesn't work for recording 7 days to die?
The player Models in this game look like Joe Pesci
This was the most boring video yet
Surprised Gavin didn't find any window wiper fluid
Fun let's play but this game seriously looks like shit.
Where is Michael?
Anytime someone says Fatty Boombalatty I lose my shit.
ryan the corn guy
<------ Dont Click me.... Too many awesome secrets may be REVEALED!
i would play this game all the time if there weren't any bees or dogs in it. those things are creeping me out
woohoo
they should play no more room in hell
You can drink straight from the lake... If you have an empty tool bar slot(empty handed) right click on the water and you'll sip some from the lake.
Yay! Hopefully this gets some more publicity for 7D.
In the beginning: "Fucking dog"... Welcome to 7 Days to Die ;)
What a bunch of noobs .
Guys you need to get to the friends tab and add each other so you can see all your friends in the map :)
awesome MOAR please
7 Days to Die > DayZ(Pure Shit) That is all!
Fun to see :)  Reminded me of my play the first couple times I played.  Too fun game.  Alpha 9.0 is going to be so cool from the sound of it.
this game show promise... I would like to see it complete, hit off  then make its way to console since thats were i do all my gaming....hands down it can become just as good if not better than Minecraft ( It takes from what was good in minecraft and adds what should of been in it)
"Let take em' out, I have a rench!"
Naked zombie VAGINA @ 15:34! (right after the search timer disappears) They should add the ability to impregnate female zombies or zombies to impregnate humans to make zombie-human hybrids which are immune to zombie attacks and have only a partial craving for humans.
My respect for Ray went down just a little when he pronounced "nuclear" incorrectly.
Jack has Lucille...
LOOL 6:23  Gavin: Ray, hows the lake? Ray: Uh, full of zombies, we'll probably die instantly. Gavin: Oh....alright.
"You scared the nob out of me" Whoa there bud
this looks way more fun than destiny
Wheres michael he hasn't been in there videos for a bit
I like michael but the commentary is much better without his constant over-reacting, screaming, and swearing
42:24 lol I get the reference, Ray
Rays infected LOL!!!
Is this comming to ps4/xbox one
reminds me of rust
Try playing unturn if u like dayz and minecraft
If The Walking Dead has taught us anything, it's that when someone says "There's a horde coming," you DON'T  go to the barn.
CHEEEEESE!!!!!!
I find it hilarious how food and water wasn't their first priority when they lost all of their supplies upon death! XD
needs to build achievement city in this game
Pc fucking sucks!! 99% of pc gamers are fat virgin nerds that dont get any love from anyone except their right hand ??. Console is the way to go especially when console is catching up ahem caught up to pc's graphics and shit
guys find this one house in this game. its made of cobblestone and it a two or three story house. it right outside of the outskirts of the neighborhood. also you need to find the neighborhood and check out every house. there is also a military base that has land mines you can pick up to protect your hide out. never stay out at dark unless you want to run into zombies. watch out for the zombie cops they explode when the see you, don't get too close. watch out for radioactive and nuclear waste. wasps and spiders have stepped in it and grew huge they will kill you. you can mine in this game and I suggest you do so. also at night block every possible entrance for the zombies to enter. zombies are faster at night but you can slow them down with a light source. you also need to build a farm as well I suggest you attach it to your hide out but make it on the second story so zombies don't destroy it. put plenty of support beams under the farm as well. also you can store stuff in the fridge and other items in the house. search dead guys and the undead. especially nurses, they carry pain killers and medicine that can heal you from attacks. make plenty of torches and build a fire in the house for cooking over. you can cut down trees with your fists, ax, and shovel. I suggest you dig the tree out from the root. also check out Markiplier's and Yamash's channel it will show you the things you need and they will make you laugh. from what I know from when I talked to you on facebook you have dirty humor so yeah. also tell Esteban I said hi
I'd like to see the guys play Minecraft in adventure mode and see if they can survive and work to a goal of some kind.
I was eye rolling so hard at another alpha zombie survival game, but i played this game a bunch and its actually pretty far along. It's really fun to play with friends, and surviving the night is terrifying.
is this game going to be free and is just in early access or is it always going to cost money?
I completely forgot Michael wasn't in this video. It wasn't until the very end when I realised lol
"oh this guy has no... skin on" LOL
lol Growler. gotta love Gavin's English slang
why do people hate jack? how i see them geoff - grif gavin - always the first to diee michael - always swearing and gavin's bestfriend ray - the one who always shouts ryan - the cynical bastard who wants to kill everyone jack - the whiny bitch (as i was told he was)
i like this game
It's kind of funny reading "this is just a ripoff of Minecraft". Because being a survival game with crafting, means it will be similar obviously, the similarities bring in fans of the genre and the differences, (Zombies can survive in daylight on this game, firearms, and the hydration bar). will bring other fans. IF this is a rip off of Minecraft then ALL fps games are rip offs of the DOOM/Wolfenstein games.
22:40 I'm disappointed in Ryan that he didn't immediately run over cover up the hole and say " HELLO NEW EDGAR " in a creepy voice :(
Where did the chesse thing come from
yeah if it costs 25$ its not an alpha and should not be excused just because it says alpha on the homepage.
You know... if you think about... PC is just an expensive console with a really sucky controller
The character holds the axe the wrong way.
Let's Play DayZ Standalone?
I hope Elisha Cuthbert reprises her role as the main character in the resident evil series
Gavin: Hey, Ryan. Ryan: Yo. Gavin: How do we know he's not infected. Geoff: I'm not infected. Ryan: You raise an interesting point. lol
i love 50 minutes to 1 hr lets plays
Hey guys, every survival game that you collect resources will always be a not as good version of minecraft. (What every comment says.)
I really like the digging mechanic, it reminds me of the book Tunnels.
Jack references Tyrion instead of Daryl Dixon /).-
Did they try to put the food in the box above the "cook" box/button? Since the slot for cookware was labeled, I would think you'd put the raw food in the labeled slot as well
no they have the same voice
i'd love to see this game come out for xbox one & PS4! it would be a top seller no doubt.
Thats what happens when you do drugs jack.
http://youtu.be/okFfbONE9sw
2:30 calm down Michael Vick
Everyone knows you never dig straight down
People in comments saying "PC Master Race!" You know who else called themselves the "Master Race"? The nazis
Someone do fanart for this it'll be awesome
I love how Ryan at 33:25 is just sitting there calling out shit eating a can of salmon. Like someone watching a game with popcorn
HER GROWLER.
Is it just me or is the a/v slightly out of sync... They say things earlier than they see it
Is this game free?
is that a companion cube o.o
I want a death counter for all their let plays
Never expected Jack to being back the early 2000s with "Beautiful Life". God, I feel so old. XD
I hope the lumbering zombie appears in part 3
37:55 the horde appears to have taken the strategic formation of a large penis for maximum penetration
judging by them playing both of them this definitely looks better entertainment wise
how do you open the craft menu?
Tuna is called "Seaman's own". True story, saw it with my own eyes.
man this game looks like poop
Ray's name: "namnworb" is Brownman backwards. It took my 30 minutes to realize that
dig a moat and put spikes in it so zombies fall in and die
The dogs are literally aids in this game :I wish there was an option to disable them
This is entertaining. Nice video fellas
you guys should play apocz on xbox
I love the amount of retarded arguments in this comment section.
Make more!
Castration might be less painful than hearing your intro splash again. Otherwise a fun vid.
I keep waiting to see one of you attack a zombie with corn.
When they kill that fat zombie out side with the sledge hammer and club, it reminds me of the scene out of Shaun of the dead In the bar when the bar owner attacks them, and there hitting him at the same time as the music.
????? ? ?? ????
make a part two please
Episode 2?
Do more plz from you big fan
is it just me or do jack and ryan sound almost exactly the same
More please
I really wanna see some more of this, although it's maybe not the best game ever but it's fun to watch.
34:55 insert cleavage pun here
Fat zombies make a noise that sounds EXACTLY like Regenerators in Resident Evil 4 when you shoot them in the plagas
WHY CANT THEY JUST AY FUCKING DAYZ ALREADY?????!!!
did they make a part 2
This is great
PLEASE make more videos , also up grade the house
Moooorreee
Play more of this!
Please play more of this. I so want to see 100+ eps of 7DTD just like you have the Minecraft series. It's a grittier version of minecraft with harsher zombies. So fun watching you guys have no idea what to do!
Darude - sandstorm
Please continue this
Make a series!!!
Why do they switch screens every 10 secoonds
Why wood u cut  down a tree with a shotgun?
I know this comment will be lost in all the other comments but when I'm scared I dig a hole in my backyard take all my clothes off and concentrate really hard and then it happens, I turn into a potato
If u place a bed down it sets ur spawn
I know what im getting on steam
MORE
Is there going to be a part 2? Or did i miss it
Please do a part 2 of this soon you guys are so funny and good at this game thanks
Hm, I'm not very excited for this one, to be honest. The fact that you've got to get a lot of extra shit to build more extra shit is kind of tedious and the sounds are downright annoying. Also, is anyone else weirded out by the fact that the deer sort of hop around like rabbits when you chase them?
Moremoremoremoremore
This would be fun if they continue it.
Closest to a DayZ lets play that we'll get.
Please make more
i want to play this game
Just noticed that every woman zombie has big tits and is either in a nurse costume, cheerleader costume, a V neck down to her growler, or an evening dress that shows the tits off….hmmm I think the devs were a bit lonely
I love how jack knows everything about any regardless of playtime JACK FOR THE WIN
DARUDE SANDSTORM
I take DayZ than 7 Dayz to Die any day. My opinion.
I take DayZ than 7 Dayz to Die any day. My opinion.
use the rench to heal blocks
yea frankly I don't fucking care how the game looks as long as its achievement hunter failing like shit
More of this ! xD
Tried to build a house out of upgraded wood frames... 3 hordes came through mid build and I only had a crossbow...
Supposedly, there's a really funny/disturbing story Ryan tells involving a gnome in 7 Days to Die Part 3.
RYAN+JACK <3
are they going to make another one because i enjoyed this.
pls upload part 2 already!!!!
Gavin with the sledge hammer Ha ha
Do they use fraps for PC recording
38:30 it's like the walking dead the Zombie are coming for the barn somebody check on Carl!
Can you make a part 2 of 7 days to die? Please?
Can u make a part 2 of die in 7 days? Please.
And henceforth, they shall call Jack....the Tree Puncher.
I think it'd be awesome if they played this and did the thing where when they die, they stop talking. I think it'd go good with this kind of game
Wow they did a lot better than expected with these last few survival game GG AH, GG
That was like an ending to a game of thrones episode. "What's going on, uh oh, he has a weapon, oh god he killed him!" End episode
more 7 days to die please :3 pretty please :P
This has been the best of their recent PC let's plays. I've never played this game, but it looks really good, and the map and private server and easy crafting make it a better let's play. Much better than Rust, The Forest, and Stomping Grounds. I would love to see more, but the paltry amount of views on this video tell me it will never come to be.
Need part 2!!
I kinda want more of this
Pff diggin' the Skyrim style detection meter x)
I think it's time for you guys to upload.... PART 2!!!!!!!!
All these fucking hop-on survival horror games are starting to piss me off. Mostly because each one of them has its own distinct audience full of whiny little bitches arguing that their game is the best game. I really hope a new genre emerges, because I don't know how many more Minecraft clones I can take.
Get wood to make a fort
At night the zombies run faster
If you're just listening to the video in the background and not watching it, it sounds like they are playing a modded version of minecraft
Wheres part2,3,4,5,6?
where is the pc elitist now?
I really like it when they play miscellaneous computer games like this and prop hunt (and other Garry's mod games), always funny :) The survival themed games have been a really refreshing change lately they're really interesting and funny.
My graphics settings don't even display higher than 360p. HELP.
I don't care about the graffics it looks fum and I wanna see more game play... Maybe a full play on it is needed? :)
Can this be a weekly thing lol...
This game is awesome but there is a way to get it free but I can't remember the link sorry
Please play dayz mod please lol. I would LOVE that. Use the commander. It's really easy for everyone to install.
I think that dog is.... A BOXER!!! Oh god... Barbra has infected me....
Oh My God! Please do more of these. I've been asking for this for months since I starts to play 7DTD. It's so freaking fun and amazing. I would love to see you guys get 100 of these too, just like minecraft. The world is entirely interactive, and when it gets out of alpha (Like minecraft) it's just going to be more and more amazing Please do more 7DTD, forget Rust and all those other chump survival games where you can't change the world
there making a part 2 of this right?
At the beginning where everyone yells cheese they should have someone say quietly in the background "and crackers"
43:20 = OMG its CJ from SA!
Huh. Took me until like 40 minutes in to realise that Ryan is named after a prime minister of New Zealand. ...Odd choice. He was a... Colourful character at best lol.
I have to say,This has been one of the most interesting and fun Lets play I've seen in a while.
this is like minecraft on major CRACK
Of course Jack would be the one to punch a dog.
I actually really enjoyed this Let's Play
Make more of these!
They should play more of this
Lol zombie lady's lol
I really enjoyed this Let's Play! I hope there will be more.
im laughing so hard at the run animation for the stag omg that's incredible
For crack 7 days to die go on my channel
I'd love to see them do a series of this, along with one od Dayz Overpoch or whatever it is where you make the bases and such.
Moooooreee
How did you make an iron pickaxe, I can't figure out how to make them.
They should make another let's play for this game
Where the hell is prop hunt part 2
please make more episodes
play more  so good
plz make more
Oh god, it's so confusing listening to Jack talking to Ryan.
To all who say "Play Minecraft, not a rip off" One word. Graphics.
you guys should play this more!!!! this is a lot like mine craft but more real. this should be a multi part
"If you need a hole, im your guy" -Gavin, well now we know his job at Roosterteeth XD
Part 2!
More more
I remember seeing Utorak play this game when it was SUPER alpha lol I thought it looked fun but broke as hell. I didn't realize that's what this game was when it was on sale... Or that it had multiplayer.... Wish I woulda purchased it now cause it looks like it's coming together pretty well.
I honestly don't care as much about graphics if the game is fun to play
People complain about what game is better.... Blah blah blah as long as YOU enjoy YOUR type of game what's the problem? Why yell at others for a game you hate. Unless it's call of duty.....that game is always the same...... Jk just stop complaining and enjoy the video.
This lets play is dope ????
5:30 "Fuck yo grass, fuck yo grass, fuck yo grass" I don't know why but I died laughing XD
Please more.
More!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will be very happy:)
lol
? ..... try getting  a valble thing lets say uhh diamonds!!!!! blahgjdfherhdojweihfihtfjiowerhfigrgf
You can tell Ryan is the PC guy because his hotbar is actually full.
I actually kind of hope this becomes another game that they play more frequently. its actually pretty cool!
Play this more its really fun to watch
They completely skipped the night in this video.  The night time would have been the funniest part with all these guys.
Make a pt. 2
More plz :) this was great
Quite liked this ! I just recently became a large fan of this game - I'd love to see one more part if possible !
Part 2!
The horde of zombies were situated in a penis form. gigglegigglegiggle
fucking ed sheeran commercial... i just had to watch it :// that was mean :3
Good Job AH
i always thought it said get-off not geoff
"Can I just eat coffee?"
If I said I knew the creator, would you believe me?
this is painful to watch... never before have i seen you guys fail so much...
I don't think they should let the Brit cook..
More please.
Make a 7 days to die series. Seriously.
zombies love doorknobs needs to be a shirt.
Part 2 please
Moarrrr!!
do more o this
Ryan and Jack sound exactly the same.
I would like more videos of this game from you guys
Why does the Steam community love early access survival games? This, The Stomping Lands, The Forest, and Rust are the most popular games on Steam right now.
You guys are fucking..just....bad.....
Part 2?
More
Why doesn't this have more views?
This is the first lets play in a while that Michael hasn't been in
CHEEEEEEEEESE!!!!! Roflroflroflroflroflrofl
So when is the Rust Let's Play?
I'd like to see more
You should do Slender.
More of this please
"He he he, Zombies LOVE the doorknobs..."                                                            --Gavin Free, Podcast Personality
"I'm gonna whack it in the arse with a sledgehammer...."                                                                   --Gavin Free, Immersion Test Equipment
Make another one! This is my favorite! :)
"She's showing me her growler!"                                              --Gavin Free, Slow Mo Guy
play this again!!!!!!!
I am really enjoying this game so far. Nothing quite like being in your house at night and having a zombie horde of 40+ swarm over your area. My brother and I just hid inside hoping to stay undetected. Suspenseful moment that is enhanced by the sound of the horde.
play more.
is there going to be a part 2
you guys should play this again
Jack is Negan with that bat xP luciel
I have a question for everyone, what happens after 7 days?
DayZ's better
more plz...
More please!
Imagine if you made an underground fallback bunker.
do more of this and the forrest
so apart 2 this was so good
I hope this becomes a new series
lol they all look like michaels GTA character in this game not the face thuo
another minecraft bo0oooooo
a horde of zombies attacking a farm sounds familiar :D
there'll be part 2 right? this game is awesome
Hmm... so dogs are more deadly in a zombie Apocalypse then the actual zombies (in sun). Wait will the next patch introduce zombie dogs? hehe
Funny how everyone looks like Michael's Gta char, and the only one missing is Michael
Please part 2
You can drink water straight from the lake and if you friend each other using the friends tab when you press I you can see each other on the map
Do more of these! This Lets Play was surprisingly really enjoyable!
Who needs a map?
please make more!
They should play castle minerz if they are going to play this shit
leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeets die!
Series please?
Please make more episodes this would be a cool series
PART 2
Poop
I feel they should have put food in the fridge misc items in the chest and spare weapons in the gun case
quick point, the ad in front of this video was about kids making a difference in the world and I thought "wow that's amazing, these kids are grea-" "CHEEEEEEESE!!!!!" haha, damn you wonderful idiots, haha
This really is just a glorified minecraft.
We need more of this and more of The Forest
More more 7 days
You know when you post your opinion and disable replies you're essentially saying "im an idiot and im wrong"
Dickbut
i really liked this. you guys should upload more! :)
At first I was thinking that this was another piece of shit wannabe game (kinda is) but after watching the full thing, I think it actually has some potential. It's like a DayZ, Minecraft mix. It's pretty cool. I hope they play more in the future.
Perhaps a tad cynical but i'd honestly just like a complete experience at this point for 25 bucks. Early access burned me like a scornful lover, and now my weary heart is too afraid to love again, mostly due to the fact these types rarely get finished. It's a shame really
Are they going to add more stuff into this game or is this it
PLEASE MAKE PART 2 LIKE THIS SO THEY SEE IT!!!!
is there a part 2 to this? or are they still making it because i really enjoyed it..
was anyone else hearing don't stop me now by queen when they were in the circle beating the fat zombie
What no part with you guys getting rekt at night? D:
welcome to another 10000 part series.
can you guys keep playing this? :D
So...... We'll get a part two right? Same with that Dinosaur survival game? Because they get good the second you all find each other.
I really love this, hope they make a series out of it! I know they don't read the comments but still :P
Part 2 please
I really like it when they play these type of games...or is it just me
Rust
Uh, is it only me that on ryans radar the horde looks like a giant schlomb 37:49
Is this going to be a series or just this one video? Really like this game so hope we will see more.
cheerleaders always have knobs in their hands lol
Ryan Haywood as Daryl Dixon
This... looks pretty bad. The Let's Play was funny though.
7:10
a part two and three and maybe four or as many as they deem necessary would be awesome.
Please please please please play more of this game.! You guys should make achievement city on here!!!
I love this game... please make more videos on this.
37:50 on the maps, the zombies make a penis on the map >:D
Please make a series on this!
Hope they make a part 2
That corn-breaking noise sounded like a Creeper hissing. Made me instinctively cringe.
Hope there's going to be a part 2
38:36 the second Gavin said "oh Man alive" I thought "Wheatly O_O " that and "people actually say that?"
took me way long to realize there's no Michael.
Lol, no one listens to Ray...
"Can we make a door? I found in a backpack." Best game ever.
part 2 all the way... this or stomping land, cause they are basically the same thing
I really wanna see more of this
I wish Michael was here :(
moaar
PLEASE play this again
yayyy! Gavin is back, im a huge fan of his cause he makes videos funny
in order to cook with a cooking pot you need bottled water, you can boil meat and you can boil unclean water to clean it. you can also make coffee with it by boiling coffee beans.
Once again stop saying its a minecraft rip off I dont see a nether portal anywhere i dont see a skeleton or giant spiders any where
Honestly most of you are saying any game with and inventory and a quick bar is a minecraft rip off personally I like the game idk why and im very judgemental when it comes to the video game industry
That was fun to watch. Part 2?
I love it when they do games like this where they have to survive and have no idea what they're doing at first.  Didn't even notice Michael wasn't in it until I read the comments... Sorry Michael!
That retarded deer was hilarious
ZZZZZ
was it really 6 and a half hours?
Was I the only one who thought Ray was going to say flint coal when they said coal
this looks horrible
i hope they continue this
wheres michael
You should continue!
Make a part 2
MOAR!!
7 days to die = first country zombie game that i know of. Most are in towns or cities.
Makin my way to the lake
Wonderful video, love watching the gang fight zombies for some reason. I have an idea for a future let's play, not sure where to put it so it will go here. When alien isolation comes out, I know it would be tempting to do like slender and have gavin and michael play but I think lads vs gents last man standing would be much funnier. last one killed by the alien while completing objectives, best out of three. I want to hear the group freak out as faces are being nomed by the alien :)
Keep playing this dudes.
And suck staying together!!!!!!!
37:52 ... Just look at the map, am I really the only one noticing this, or am I just sick minded
You guys SUCK at finding each other!!!!!!
I feel that this Let's Play needs to continue. I'm not sure about anyone else, but I think this is a really satisfying video and game and it just works out.  One of the best Let's Plays in my opinion.
I would like to see an ongoing series of this. Really enjoyed it!
This is really cool! I'd like to see more episodes of this
unturned 2 maybe???
2012 : Year of Bows & Arrows 2013 : Year of Lava, say Michale ... Guess 2014 will be Year of Free-Roaming & Sand Boxes
So you could build a underground network of tunnels? That sounds fucking awesome. Can you imagine just having a giant base underground? No one could fuck with you all you would have to do is occasionally pop out to look for food and supplies
Why is it every time that I watch a let's play like this, I always seem to have lost money by the end of it :P
Please continue this as a series
Hey achievement hunters you guys should make a lets play about cube world, it is a very cheap game on picroma.com it has 4 different classes with leveling and leveling up skills. So if and when you read this just think about it please and thank you.
Will the y ever do another episode?
Acheivment hunters vs creature hub
a "the world according to Garp" reference Ryan?
How much is this game
Is it just me or is Gavins' accent slowly disappearing?
I hope it saves
I like the survival games that u guys play
I hope it lets them continue
you guys should play this more
Make a trout around the house next time to keep the zombies away from the house so only you guys can get in an out of the safe house so its for sure a safe house!!! 0u0
Make a trout around the house next time to keep the zombies away from the house so only you guys can get in an out of the safe house so its for sure a safe house!!! 0u0
I thought Gavin was referring to Sam Cooke's 'Chain Gang.'  Were the seven dwarfs prisoners?  Because that movie is messed up enough already!
More!!!!
I really enjoyed this Lets play i hope they make more :D
I hope they do another episode
So I didn't read the description and I only noticed that Michael isn't here because of his honeymoon, 30 minutes and 15 seconds in.
22:50 It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again!
Well, killing zombies seems to b a team thing, not with any A.Iiii. ( A. I
FIRST COMMENT
If you set the speed to .5, it sounds like they're high... Might just be me.
so am i the only one who sees what is basically a minecraft parody with prettier graphics.
As usual, Ray's the one with the pot.
please make this like the minecraft series, King Geoff... Make me a house in 30mins which ever one you like best wins.
this game looks awesome, all it needs is a neather
Did anyone else think that it said seven ways to die when they clicked in this video :p
9/10- could do with more mogar
pt 2!
I caught that Gears of War reference...
Hope this becomes a multipart series
I'd love to see them carry this on
Part 2 is needed
It's like the walking dead
The way they blocked the door with 3 wood and one wooden plank is killing me #ocd
as u played the forest, stomping lands and this. can u do a lets play on dayz standalone
Are you guys gonna make more of these? I liked it. You guys can make a miniseries out of it. Much like Node did with mine craft.
I've been working on the raaaaaailrooad.  Aaaaaalll the live long daaaaaay.
Ryan is like Darrell from Walking Dead lol
I just want to thank jack for close captioning what he does in the game. Its not like I'm watching it or anything.
MOAR!
part 2!
This was by far my favorite Let's Play in a while. Really hope they continue it.
I hope you'll continue this game. It's the most interesting co-op so far. :)
The female zombie sounds are similar to Dead Trigger.
it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video
If you pause the video when Ryan locates the hoard near the barn , it looks like a dick on his mini-map lol
more
Want part 2.
More please
Took me about 5 minutes to realize that Mikey Wikey was not in this video. No wonder why it wasn't as loud.
I kinda wanna see these guys struggle in DayZ. 90% of it would be them running round like a chickens with their heads cut off but I think it would still be good
totally freakin sick! 342 real followers today from INSTAPHAMOUS. COM
wish michael was in this video. would have been much funnier
For people who have played both games, whats better... this or Rust?
Im sad that Michael isn't in this :( he was probably still in Australia when they recorded this though...
Hi
I wanna see more of this!!!
Please oh please make this a continuing Let's Play...Bring in Michael and bam full on series, I'm not even done with this video and I almost peed. XD
Where the fuck is Michael you sons of bitches! *Shakes fist angrily
Kdin seems like a nice guy but his editing is atrocious
More of these!
is it freezing then skipping but playing audio for anyone else? i mean lke every 10 seconds it will freeze but the audio will keep playing then it will skip to the sceen it was suppose to be on.....
lol "how do i put crossbow in bolt" XD
Geoff: "I have collected some sticks" Ray: "I got hubcaps" The inner Puerto Rican has been unleashed in Ray.
Skyrim+Minecraft+Dayz if they were all still alpha makes this game
dying of thirst. that kendrick tho!
Like for part 2
Hope to see more episodes of this.
Ryan....."how do you put crossbow in bolt??"- haha lmao
part 2 please
Continue it
you guys should play nether
Don't care whether it's DayZ or 7 Days to Die, don't care whether it's KYRsp33dy or the Achievement Hunters, these zombie apocalypse survival games are boring as shit to watch. I hate to say it, as much of a fan as I am of the AH Crew.
15:33 Zombie vajayjay.
moreeee
Though it would never happen, i think this would make an excellent series!
MOOOOOOORE
Are they going to continue this?
Will there be a part 2?
Why do you guys keep playing these games in alpha or pre-alpha, itll be years before these games are released and we'll have long-forgotten this video. Why not play it when its in a more presentable and relevant version? something that might better represent the game we'll buy when it comes out.
Do more
22:41 it puts the lotion in the basket else it gets the hose again
The whole time they were talking about corn I was thinking of freak on a leash.
Y'all should play nether if y'all liked this game
Moar pls. Feels like Minecraft from the very beginning again :>
more
You guys should play Rust.
I hope they continue this.
Moooooore
More
ray " i just play the drums and make the African face" get him to the greek reference
I wanna see them continue.. They haven't experience what happens at night....all hell will probably break loose.. Lol x)
I took a wrong mysterious turn. - Only Gavin.
Gavin: So ah ray how's the lake ? Ray: Full of zombies we will die instantly
geoff sounds alot like joel in this
Do a part 2
So this is just in the alpha/beta phase, right?  I really want to play this when all the kinks are fixed.
NUKILER!
That awkward moment they're trying to cook food and that the cookware can only make bottled water...
The walking Dead: Achivement Hunter style!  by Tell Tale Games/the show (yes Ik they dont really match the characters but this is just how I am seeing it lol)  Gavin- Ben Ryan- Daryl Geoff-Kenny Jack- ?(help)  Ray- ?(help)
The title doesn't say "part 1" and I'm scared because I really enjoyed this and want part 2 ;-;
I like this. I hope to see more
The six of you guys should play Contagion together.
I was probably the only one who was dying to know what the bottom of the mine looked like after the time skip...
This was awesome. moreee
Here's hoping they do more. Liking this.
I adore Jack: "I'm gonna got get a dining set for us!"
i dont know why but i'm terrified while watching this
We Demand Mooore!  ... this was a great watch!  keep up the good work. you guys playing 7Days to die is more fun than sex and tv combined. One love
I would watch this as a series until they made it to day seven lol =P
Didn't even realize Michael wasn't in this until the let's stop
That game looks awesome, is it only for pc?
Another average survival game made to earn the developer's quick money just because survival game are popular as of late.
hit zombies I. the head to do more damage
u need full water and food to get health
I love it how Ryan stockpiles all of the guns and tells no one about them.
This was my favorite lets play in a while.
you need bottled water when cooking
They should do this again but when one of them dies cut out there audio and just have them be out for the rest of let's play. Kind of like a heist. This is just to see who can survive the longest and the last one to be alive is the winner. They can be against each other or they can work together. I am just suggesting this because it sounds fun, if they don't think so oh well, just thought I would suggest something different! :D
Forget DayZ, this game looks much better
More!
setting a bed down DOES set your spawn
"zombies love the doorknob" sounds like a shirt
Stamina affects damage
The map needs to be expanded, however. Also, vehicles.
Let's play apocz
This game looks fantastic
This game looks like it's out of 2004...
Not a game I would buy, but I like watching it
Please make another episode!
The keystone block (the stone looking one with the flag on it), that geoff put down, makes it harder for others to break blocks in a radius around it, kind of marking your "base"
MORE!
I died when jack said whats that screwing sound!
Why was the first upload of this video made private?
Make this a series
part 2, i demand it!
label these by part please
AH roles in a zombie apocalypse Ryan: the guy who loses his mind and kills his team Gavin: the guy who dies first Geoff: the leader who has no clue what to do Jack: the guy who wants to raid all the stores for food Ray : the guy who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time Michael: the guy who rages at the zombies for ruining his week Lindsay: the girl who is tougher than the rest of the team
It's been years and I still cannot tell Jack and Ryan's voices apart. No matter how hard I try, it just doesn't happen.
15 minutes in and I only just realized that Michael wasn't in the game. Whoops.
Dear roosterteeth, can u please play this game again. It was funny as hell.
I think you'll only lose your stuff in your hot bar when you die.
Frame rate cries for help :(
This needs to become a series, this is great.
you got to do more
That intro sounds like Novawar from LagTV
Loved it
Please make a part 2! This is almost better than minecraft!
So what happened to the night time footage of the game....??
they should definitely make a part 2
part 2 !!
Please make a part two
For some reason this is one of my favourite off their videos
This should be it's own series
Yeah I'm pretty sure they have more in this one since they re-uploaded it
i love this keep it up =}
more 7 days to die!!!!!
As much as I like Michael (And all the guys for that matter.) It is nice to have a calm lets play without him yelling the whole time.
Somehow they make even shitty games fun
ahahaha 10.00 10.15
Make more let's plays of this please
Love this :D
Love this :D
more of this please !
Part 2 of this would be great.
biscuit tins and hub caps in the middle square = scrap metal,  scrap metal in 3 squares across= ingot
I need part 2.
I would like to see more.
Now they can repopulate the Earth. With 5 men.
I want a part 2
Wheres Michael
I guess this being Reuploaded is why it has a tiny amount of Views for a AH video?
35:13 shoutout to George Bush
22:50 I was waiting for someone to cover the hole...
This was very entertaining to watch. Good job guys.
In order to cook you have to but a glass jar with water under the meat
More Plz!
WHY DO I HAVE SO MUCH LAG? I just want to watch AH play a game without the delay. I miss Micoo <3
There is a horde near the barnhouse.....walking dead reference by the makers perhaps??
Great video! 11/10 would watch again.
Yeah, those pudding rocks are a sight to behold.
Part 2! Get michael involved aswell!
more...! :D this was a very interesting looking game!
i think they should have a deathmatch towards the end where they spread out a bit and hunt eachother
More please.
Top let's play. Would like to see more of this.
LLLLLLEEEEETTTTTSSSSS DIE...
Can you guys do more of this? Really like it!!
Was the rumbling noise Jack heard when he said his sound is fucked up, isnt that a plane dropping a supply crate?
Play stomping land again
Much better than stomping ground, you can actually set spawns and find each other with ease.
MORE
Please continue making more vids of this game! It was so interesting!
more please!
So awesome,do more
Could someone explain what the hell is with the 6.5 days later and stuff like that? I absolutely don't understand any of these comment threads. It just fucking baffles me.
Make a series of this pls I want more
the guys should play rust
This Pressfarttocontinue dude is not original at all he took press heart to continues name and put fart in it and has to be on every popular video to get views...... And here I thought the world was getting better
Generic "this was re-uploaded, moan, complain, boo, hiss"
Mooooorreee
Make tis a lets play pls
FYI, and Im sure some one said already, You can Drink directly from any water, Just use a open tool belt and right click :D
This game is trying SO hard to be minecraft and that's exactly why it will never take off. Why get a rip off when you can play the original
Well it's official this is replacing Minecraft ... Im joking
You guys should play 5 minutes to kill yourself
How did Gavin get out of the hole?
Great to see you guys in 7daystodie! hope you enjoy the game!!
so do they choose where they start in this game?  Or did the game just instictively know to drop ray in mexico?
Rays audio line                                                --                                           --        -                          -----------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------  -------- ----------------
so is this on steam? looks cool
You should start a series off this
MORE
I would love to see them play this some more, just saying.
PLEASE MAKE A PART 2!!!!
This was a nice LP, I hope they do this again.
More
just setting a bed or sleeping bag down will set spawn
Lets Play-7 days to die part 2
I really hope they continue this or at least make a series :(
Just love the Hogans Heroes reference
Want more! this was to fun and funny as hell x'3
Good to know cheerleaders like nobs :)
why did they cut this so much?  In my opinion they should not cut it as much
I really hope they play more it was awesome to watch :D
Part 2!
is this a skyrim mod?
Please make a part 2!
Where Michael
Please do a part two to this
More please
I wanna know where the 2nd part of prop hunters is......
Ray's name in this is naMnwor8. Which backwards is 8rownMan. Coincidence? I think not!
Do a part 2 please that would be an amazing let's play
i like eating hot pockets wile watching this
love the bromance between ryan and jack
love it they need to continue
do that again it was awesome
Part 2?????
Plz do more uf these
Hopefully another one? :)
This needs to be a new weekly video series
I like how this game uses the exact same sneaking crosshair icon that Skyrim uses.
i could've sworn this video was already uploaded .. why the re-up?
Play fifa world cup
Oh yeah pc games look so pretty. You console peasants and your shitty graphics. Pc is the way to go. All of the most popular pc games are the prettiest looking games today! Stomping land, dayz, and this. Man us pc players are spoiled with good looking graphics!
Please play again
what if you put your bed down right before a big group of zombies in case you were killed by them?
Anyone notice that the horde on Ryan's map at 38:00 makes a penis? lol
moooore
Please do more of these !
Did anyone else think of the walking dead when Ryan saw the horde at the barn?
Did anyone else think of the walking dead when Ryan saw the horde at the barn?
Can't wait for part 2. This was way more entertaining than your latest minecraft let's plays. (Besides Bodyguard)
More 7 Days to Die please.
I cant hear it. The volume seems to be quite low on it. :(
Awesome video please make part 2, I have tons of fun watching your videos!
More!
definitely a fun lets play, would love to see more.
mooooreeeee
This was pretty freaking cool. I'd watch them play this anytime.
Why did they re-upload it?
dose it bother anyone else that the sneaking mechanic is the same from skyrim with the eye
Did anyone else have the page refresh itself and a showing that the video was private, only to re-click on the video and have everything working smooth?
Part 2?
This is the game that DayZ standalone should've been. Literally, every single thing about this game is better, and it's very similar, only with better crafting, loot system, combat, play-ability, stability, zombies, players, creators, terrain, weapons, gods, water, grass, dirt, potatoes, etc.
I don't know what people are talking about, Ray seemed more alive and happy in this one than he has in the last few.
They were surprisingly energetic this Let's Play! I enjoyed it.
I really hope they make a part 2, 3 etc...
That's Kansas....lol
You should play more games like these
this is a game worth looking in to
What kind of blue jeans and brown coat cult is this?
Let's stop
1080p!
Awesome keep posting these videos
This is one of my favourite Let's Plays. Really hope they upload part 2 within the upcoming days as opposed to one every few weeks/months...
moar of this !
I hope they make another one of these
reuploaded?
cant wait till part 2.
Id watch another part
Please make a series out of this guy's....
7 days to get scammed. This turd of a game was pretty much abandoned in alpha once the developers made enough money from pre-sales and realised their promises were in no way realistic. The description on Steam even vaguely admits this: "This Early Access game may or may not change significantly over the course of development." Hint: It won't change at all, cause they already have your money.
I'm starting a petition to stop people from giving every comment by PressFartToContinue hundreds of likes and replies.
Definitely interested in seeing more videos of this.
Make. More
This is A Reupload don't comment about it Make This A Top Comment So People Stop Spamming With "Is This a Reupload"
Ya know for a game without a single original thought this doesn't look so bad. I like the little touches like the Skyrim sneaking and Minecraft building. Actually looks like they put thought in what to steal to build a new experience and I appreciate that. Might check this out.
Favorite lets play ever! Please make. A part two!
Why reupload?
more please?
Aww, no Michael.
This game looks flipping fun to play with a bunch of people omg.
The editing wasn't so bad that they needed to do a reupload, but, it's an improvement.
More please
Not many big gamers play this. They should do this weekly.
HAHAHAHA if you put the spped of this video to 0.5 they all sound like they are just coming round from anesthetic.
This should be a series like Minecraft
Is this a reupload?  I remember watching this yesterday.
this is the only PC game I want to play
i cant wait for the nextt one!!!
Need to start putting these out faster, i watch through them too fast
also get Mogar!! if you dont mind..
MOREEEEE!!!!!!! please..
The moment I saw the title, I was like, YES. :D
I forgot Ray was in the LP
Was this uploaded again? I swear I saw this last night.
I watched 3/4ths of the video and realized I already watched this yesterday. I thought this was part 2 >.<
3:47 , team same voice ception. Is he punching n talking to himself?
This is what DayZ should have been.
First let's play in a while were I really fucking enjoyed every minute of it, hopefully they make more
Part 2 por favor
Tyrion kills Tywin in the newest GoT episode
this was awsome and I want more
I hope there are lots of parts/episodes for this! It looks like it has great potential to keep going.
That time when 2 identical (in-game) persons meet... 3:38
Really enjoyed this Let's Play! Nice progression from the start. Can't wait for more :)
That stupid deer and it's jumping makes me laugh when I see it. XD
Please keep playing!!!
more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do more of this!!!
Really hoping they do a Part 2 of this one!  :)
i Need mor of this,
This is lot better than Day Z please continue to play this...
Alright, Now this game needs some walking skeletons, a green moss monster that explodes, some NPCs, a alternate dimension that resembles hell, and we'll be good.
That awkward moment when you realize that it took you way too long to notice that Michael isn't in the let's play... 32 minute mark...... facepalm
This game actually looks awesome, Minecraft plus zombie apocalypse? they can do so much with that? With good graphics too?
"This zombie has huge tits. I kinda feel bad doing this." Oh, Ray.
This might become a mini series. Hopefully a part 2 will come out soon!
"alright, calm down with the crossbow tyrion." too soon jack, too soon...
"Zombies love doorknobs" - Gavin 2014
This looks to be something that could be a little series to see how long you guys last
play more
Play more plz, really like it. Nice series and fun to watch!
This was awesome they should make it a series.
the new minecraft??
I've been waiting so long for this lets play!
Where the hell is Prop Hunt part 2?
More! :D
PLAY MORE PLAY MORE PLAY MORE
If anybody did not notice the zombie dogs make a tie fighter noise when they die.
we want more of this, Like if you came here thinking it was a 2nd episode
I don't know all the things they did differently but at 25:15 they added the screen that says "6 and a half hours later"
I got this game last night and I keep having issues with it freezing on me. It is annoying but when it isn't freezing it is a fun game.
This was actually really good, I thought this wasn't gonna be as good, but I wanna see more. Even if this game seems pretty easy with a bunch of friends
It says alpha but the game has been out for almost a year now
shhhhh.... im hunting wabbits
Did they just skip night time or did it never come? I'm a little disappointed at night everything goes to hell but it never happened.
More!
Make this into a series
More
Play Rust
please do more soon
never seen this game before they should do another video of it
More episodes plz!!!!!!!!!
I don't know if it would be possible but I think it'd be really funny to see you guys do a lads vs. gents: Star Wars edition! Thanks and keep up the great work I'm a huge fan of you guys!!!:D
Please more
Ahah i love this game, just too buggy and the devs seem a little too arrogant to take criticism.
Re-uploaded due to copyright?
Gavin: Ray how's the lake?  Ray: Uh full with Zombies, we'll probably die instantly.
BOOM "I'm The Hole Guy" T-shirt idea.
Definitely make more of these, really fun watch
Can we get a The Stomping Grounds part 2? The first one was really fun to watch.
Really want a part 2
Did they reupload this? I could swear I watched this last night.
Am I crazy or did they re-upload this?
Am I the only one here who is watching this for the first time?
Didn't they upload this yesterday?
running effects from Minecraft?
This is just every game ever at this point.
Moar!!!!!!!!!!
Fantastic let's play!
MORE! That is all
Part 2 if possible please???
I would greatly appreciate more of this, thank you!
Did they re-upload this or something? I've seen this video this very morning (UK). Well at least 12 hours back.
great video
Is this made by Besthesda?
Is this to fix the edit fails from the last one?
They have to play DayZ
I thought this was part 2.  My pants were shat.
Its really not that big of a dal, they redid some sloppy transitions, its not like too much to expect from a production company roosterteeth has become. They either had a new person doing it, or they didnt watch it all through. I appreciate the re upload.
Other than the consumable jars and the atrocious walk cycle on the deer, this game looks promising.
Unfortunately let's plays like this one, the forest, and stomping grounds all look really similar and end up being just a repeat of each other. I would rather them pick one and do a few episodes of that one instead.
I saw this video went private for a bit and got scared. Thought we had another Let's Build Portal House situation on our hands!
More please
maybe there was a new editor that messed up so they had to fix it and reupload
MORRREEEE!!!!!
Its like dayz and Minecraft meet.
Its like dayz and Minecraft meet.
"So thirsty.... So thirsty...."-Jack 2014 Make that a shirt
Good Group Roosterteeth, going back to fix the editing like a champ. Way to listen to feedback you all-stars.
Be sure to make more of these.
I guess this is Roosterteeth's new approach, re-upload videos for maximum views. Also Jack is worthless. 50 minutes of him whining and asking how to make shit, fuck you Jack.
Id really like them to continue this
15:50 is when they all meet up if anyone wants to skip the beginning stuff.
More please
played grooses theme this whole lets play, it was funny to me :3
Is this an old game, or are the graphics made this way?
why don't they just play DayZ
More
Jack, why do you have to steal the minorities job? I thought hitting the trees was Ray's job?
"Calm down with that crossbow Tyrion." Jack you have GoT to be kidding me
This Let's Play was great, but I'm REALLY getting fucking tired of ''Minecrafty Survival Horror Early Access Alpha for 3 years" games.  I mean really.  What happened to making a game, testing it, and releasing it?  Are those days over?  Am I that old?  What happened to polishing your product to make sure it was bug free BEFORE you released it?  Nowadays all these stupid people are paying to be Alpha/Beta testers - when not so long ago that very job paid well.  Stupid fucking sheep.
is like DayZ but this game works.
Geoff is moron, Ryan said wait till we get in a group and Geoff said Oh okay I'm already here, HE DESERVED TOO BE EATEN!
"I'm nervous, Ryan. I'm scared when you're not near me." Aw, I love moments like that.
aww i was hoping it was a second session...
Is this a reupload?
Wow, this game looks awesome! Why did I not buy it on steam when it was on sale?!?!
make this a series
Didn't they upload this yesterday?
This needs to be a series. Who else agrees? Imagine the carnage of them fighting for survival, fending off the undead hordes of night as they scavenge and forage about the multifaceted landscape. Watch as Gavin mercilessly clocks Jack with other heavy blunt implements. They should at least finish off the week.
God damnit.  I thought we were going to get two 7 Days to Die videos in a row.
didn't they post this yesterday??
Play more PLZZ
There best be another let's play coming.....
This count as a let's play for today
raise your hand if you want to be the official ah video screener
They need to make more of these it's cool
the editing on this was trash
did they reupload it to fix the technical issues?
Fuck you Ryan. No one wants you in these Lets Play's.
Do a series on this :D
This is my favorite game :)
Ray probably edited it the first time
Mooooore!!!
Reupload?
Love the way the video has only 300 views at the moment but 1000 likes
team same voice have matching character models, first thing one does after that is punch the other in the nose.
Wasnt this uploaded yesturday on the RT site?
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. :)
It's Thursday.
This is what is going to replace lets play minecraft! .!
i swear i watched this yesterday
Please play this again!
more of this
they fixed that 25:11 flash of text so you can read not flash by in less then half a sec
I already watched the whole thing last night, even with the couple sync and transition issues there were. Whelp, time to watch it again! :D
was this reposted to anyone elses subscription wall more then once
its so peaceful without Michael. not sayin i dont like him, i love him, its jsut without his loudness, its odd.
why uploaded again?
REUPLOADING VIEW WHORES, jk. It was probably an accident
I want more i love it!!""
ok guys if you play the video at 0.5 speed it will be the funniest thing you have ever seen, i promise xD especially 26:55 and 10:40 they sound so drunk and wasted
why is this up again? What was wrong with the other? :p
Shame about the need to re-upload. YouTube should really add a feature to just replace videos with another so it keeps it's stats. Though YouTube would also need a way to auto-check the video to make sure it's the same (with minor differences). It'd work well for videos that have had their audio censored too due to copyright.
Why did they reupload this?
Didnt they release this yesterday?
Am I the only one that was waiting for Ryan say, "Well, there doesn't have to be five of us".
Awesome series (?) keep it up :D
I've been watching Lets Plays on 1.5 speed. It sounds like all of them drank sooo much coffee.
Why did they reupload somthing they posted yesterday
fixed
Omg yes I love this game it's the best
This was good I would like to see more of these.
I thought i had bought some good stuff that sent me back in time, nope reload.
Is it my computer or does everyone else have 360p?
Does this mean they are going to upload another let's play later for the Thursday let's plays?
Is this only available up to 360p for anybody else on mobile?
They made the other one private. Guess they had to reupload it.
Deja-vu
Why did they re upload it
now i get to watch it again c:
Well if you insist Achievement Hunter, I suppose I could watch it again.
Make part 2 please.
so it's minecraft mixed with dead rising? ...interesting
Re-upload much?
I didn't think the editing was distracting enough for them to need to reupload it, but it's neat that they did.
Oh...thought it was a part 2 :( didnt read it properly
Thanks for the proper edited version, it wasn't a major deal but it was cool to redo it so it wasn't so choppy.
is it only 360p for anyone else?
Dat 360 P Though
They Re-uploaded this?
Moar
Minecraft: Realistic Edition
Did they literally not upload it in 720p cause it's been a hour and I still don't have 720p option :L
so my video is only in 360p...anyone else? .-.
How convenient, I was just starting to watch the non-fixed one.
At first i thought it was part two
Awwww, I thought this would be part 2.  Really cool game so far.
More !!
Deja Vu!
??? i saw this yesterday...
Plese do a series of this
i have a feeling that gavin may have put some moldy bread in the fridge....
What if they played this every friday instead of minecraft?... I wouldn't mind...
Thought all that transitioning lag blips yestreday was just wifi lag
Whats with the reupload?
It's baaaack!!!
Why 360p
1:38 dick cactus
Wtf they played this game for almost 7 and a half hours wow that's crazy I wonder what happen in that 6 and a half hours or did they took a break and when out of lunch then continue playing
Why only 360p?
they should play charlie murder cx
re-upload?
ladies love knobs
wow 150th comment
I'm really not a fan of these survival lets plays, mainly because nothing tends to happen
why is it stuck to 360p?
I was wondering if they'd re-upload since the first one was a botched edit/render. In any case, this let's play made me consider trying this game out!
There were some transitions last time they uploaded it that just lingered on the last frame of one shot for a couple seconds before going to the next instead of the instant cut like they always do.
Wow, this was a very good, fun enjoyable Let's Play! :)
I want to see them build a castle stone walls and wooden turrets and of course moats filled with zombies.
I want to see them build a castle stone walls and wooden turrets and of course moats filled with zombies.
they uploaded this already??
There were awkward pauses in the old one
Please do more of The Forrest, Prop Hunt, and this game! ?
This is waaay better than the stomping land to watch in my opinion
Dammit I was hoping for part 2
Oh darn, I thought this was part 2 already. Silly me, now I'm all disappointed.
It was so nice, they uploaded it twice! Though seriously it's really great that they would take the time to fix minor editing problems in their videos despite how rotten some of their YouTube 'fans' can be.
There were editing problems with the other.
they take forever to release videos. usually not until 5 EST.
is it only 360p for anyone else?
they probably reuploaded because the first video had a problem, where the screen cuts were .00001 second long with the video paused for a second or two.
what was so wrong on the last one that they needed to re-upload it
Why r we watching this again
My hopes and dreams were shattered. It'd be amazing if they did more episodes of this.
Oh look they reuploaded it because it had editing problems :) To the retards telling me it had no problems I believe the term I'm looking for is "suck it"  or perhaps "I told you so" :)
Why is the vid only in 360p? Just wondering...
I tried watching this yesterday and they stet it to private WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT. I was really confused for a while :p
WHAT DE FUK IZ DIS
I'm wondering how Gavin got out of that hole...
I know what prisoners sing get me the fuck out of here
what???? I got to like 10 min and was like ??????? Dident I just watch this
To again echo the other people who noticed, several of the cuts in the original upload were dodgy so they re-uploaded a higher quality video.
Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese!
COME ON 720P ITS BEEN 30 MINUTES!
where's micoooo :(
Aw I thought this was part 2 :(
Stop copying  SeaNanners :S
I was wondering what was up with those pauses. Audio seemed fine so i could care less but very professional, unlike Gavin's nob
dam i thought this was part 2
They should make a series of this
is this edited to the point where i should rewatch it?
Deja Vu
29:20 Chris Brownman
do more parts of this!
Re-upload because of an editing issue.
is it just me or does every one have to watch this in 360p?
Ummm this came out already?
Woah! Deja vu! :o
They fixed the timing of the text cards
MORE!!!!!!!!!!............please.
I think there was something wrong with the other one, they took it down
Somehow better than their mine craft ones recently, the LP's are best when they are trying to survive and do whatever it takes, rather than the incredibly elaborated games in mine craft.
For everyone asking why it was reposted. There were a few minor editing mistakes.
and now its 360p whatever i watched it yesterday anyways :)
Re-upload?
Why'd they re-upload this?
Wasn't this uploaded yesterday?
why was this uploaded again !! fucking gavin
didn't they upload this yester day it says it was uploaded today?
why is this re uploaded they did this yesterday
Somebody find the nights, I noticed the video had weird cuts with frame long annotations last time.
FUCK YEAH!
A Rooster Teeth video and no PressFartToContinue? This is my chance! Insert clever remark about video here
Why the re-upload? I thought the last one was fine.
Is anyone else having a case of serious deja vu?
Eh, whatever I'll watch it again
didn't we already watch this? lol
This already came out?
Hi
Why was this re uploaded
reupload?
The editing is fixed on this video.
was this not posted last night? i remember watching it when i got home from work.
You guys should try Red Orchestra 2: Rising storm! It's definitely underrated, and way better than this game.
again?
deja vu
Ayyyy
More
Ray and the zombie with big tits. Still a better love story than Twilight.
It says it wa uploaded 8 minutes go, but I was watching this last night at like 2 AM on my Xbox
I hope they do more of these. This is a great game to play and watch LP's in.
They probably reuploaded this because they needed to fix the errors where the video froze right before the time cards.
They should add each other as FRIENDS in the game.  Friends show up on your map in the game.
wtf, this came out yesterday. GIVE US THURSDAY'S VIDEO
PENIS
I just refreshed to get 1080 and the video went private. Now it's back and it only goes up to 360 :(

Why did they upload this twice? It had like 400,000 views..
Love your videos :3

Why do people write first ? Fucking losers
I'm confused I just watched it and now it's up again?
