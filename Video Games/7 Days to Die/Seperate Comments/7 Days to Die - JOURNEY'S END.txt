Hehe. Sorry Dora.\n\nEdit: My plane is taking off so hopefully this goes through - the series is taking a break after today. Next Friday is a Frighty Night, then a differenty video the next Friday, then after that a new series!
Brilliant way to end the series guys I was in tears with laughter watching the last 10 mins, the song is brilliant nice work guys
I'm going to miss this show, so so so soooo much💔
I love it hahahahahhaha
I dub this piece: Symphony of Carnage by maestro Adahop
Listening to Dora laugh through this entire ordeal was perfect.  Probably the best series I have watched on YouTube.  Amazing job and really excited to see your next project.
that ending was just to much for me seeing some thing so great come to an end. this has been my favorite series ty ada for the great video editing on every episode
A little late with this question but its actually about game play.  Why didn't you guys ever build a castle type set up? instead of digging into the hill near the light house, actually build something on top of the hill and dig a mote?  was it a resource gathering issue, I can understand if the materials are hard to gather, I just haven't played the game yet and I was curious about that side of things.  Sometimes games have a way around that kind of problem, I mean its easily solved in fallout 4 by unlocking you chem station straight away and becoming a drug baron selling Jet to make piles of caps and just buy in bulk lol.  So glad to hear you might revisit this game in the future after they do more updates.
One of the best videos I have ever watched on YouTube or any other medium.
waiting for season 2~~
I've been off 7dtd for a while due to the immense wait time for the new build, and I must say, being linked this play through a couple of weeks ago reinvigorated my interest in this game. Incredibly well edited, great scenes, and endless humour throughout! Great work to you all!
More plz
Is the series over or are they gonna come back for the new alpha update?
My gf got me into neebs gaming about a year ago. Since then I discovered Hank & Jed (got through all hank & jed). \n\nI was having trouble viewing all the neebs gaming videos tho. Not enough time, so I had to quit my job to make more room to watch more videos. You guys are friggen awesome! I think this is my second comment ever on youtube. Keep up the great work Neebs Gaming team, you peeps are legends! \n\nAlso I don't care what games/vids you make, just keep doing them. Hell you can even do one about watching grass grow, I am sure it will be awesome! I am on a mission to like and watch every video!
Ive watched this ep like 5-6 times already best one yet. Sad to see it go but i know there are a few new series coming up soon. Cant wait!!! Thanks Dora for such a great send off lol
I love that rock song at the end great episode neebs gaming.
I'm laughing my head off. This is one of the funniest episodes. Next episode you guys should write a note to self. Do not camp in a death hole on hoard night.
why was ada doing that
1812 overture I played it in concert band, I may look uncultured but I in fact not. What?
Anyone else notice that they use creative for the base now and the trader... Normally I would be mad but its funny to watch
This series was awsome & funny & i hope tha you all will return to it soon for a 2nd series of it. Cant wait
I like how at the start, the little clip was him messing up the game, making it 5x harder, and he also fiddled with the thermostat. Nobody EVER touches the thermostat, that little devil...
This series was an absolute MASTERPIECE!  Amazing work Adahop and the whole neebsgaming crew, this is most definitely my favorite game series!
I got some terrible news today...my girlfriend called it off after a year...i thought it was the worst news i could get today...until i saw the word FINALE in a thumbnail of 7Days to die...it was then i knew true heart break. Please revisit this series...dont pull a \"DICE/EA\"  and veer away from a winning formula for to long(cough BAD COMPANY2 cough!) . This has been your best work...when i watch this series,i get the feeling of family,like you guys are together as family..maybe its the survival,band together thing,who knows...and being an expat in a country away from home for 6 years now,this show always warmed me.\n\nThanks guys,sincerely.
Can you keep making 7 days to die videos
that it?  noooooooo
I want to see red dead and fallout 76.
Doraleus score:1\nAdahop score:10 for creating a great final episode\nLoved this series
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
Favorite part of the video is knowing that:\nThe room was terribly build structurally\nThe strategy should have been a flawless success\nThe strategy would have been a flawless success if Dora had built the room the right way round\n\n\nActually though, the way to get to the room from the rest of the house was where you expected the zombies to come in from. If you had built it the other way, its more likely that the zombies would have gone down the hole. Absolutely hilarious video anyway guys. Enjoy the break and I hope you enjoy an eventual second season
:( i want more !!!
This series will be missed :'|
I hope they do another season. This series is great. <3
Aw, I didn't want this series to end. But that- THAT was perfect! Everybody at their finest!
Thia makes me sad but happy hope to see something new and dangerous soon ;) much love to u guys ❤\n\n#simon4life
jesus....that was an absolute bloodbath
I didn't think that there could be a hole worse than Courtney Love's band but I was very, so very wrong!
This is the best 7days to die video
Best saved for last! Thanks for the map download Adahop!!
The Doraleus inner monologue segments of this series were my favorite part.
\"Wow, what a hole\"\nName that movie
i liked the parts about colorblind plushophilia
great series. i watched most of its first half in non-chronological order, and with the chronologically changing locales and constructions/demolitions, it was a simple mindgame to solve for chronology.\n\nspoilers are really minor towards the fun of piecing together some causality.
Went from looking like it was going to be the BEST horde night to he worst one BY FAR!!! Good word Doraleous!
Dam u guys died alot lmao good job thou
7 days to die was your best series so what now..
One of neebs gaming's best videos ever. If you don't come back to this series I will disown you.
Loved the music in the beginning of this episode it created and adventurous mood.Almost like the beginning of a movie or epic tale.Would like to see sumthing similar in future videos.-Simon I'm still waiting for that sandwich video,I lack the judgement and pallet to craft a \"Simon Sandwich\" Teach your wisdom
Absolutely the best end to the best series I know on Youtube!  You are are so funny and make these things so very entertaining.  Keep up the good work and I look forward to your next series, whatever that turns out to be!  :D  Loved the nefarious intro too!  You all rule.
Wow guys gonna miss watching the show
Love u
wow...you got some good ass editing and effects skills...….  I started recording my game with 2 friends..but I rented a server so if im at work..they can play if they wanna.  ….just lowed a day length to 1 min so jack it from 30 days to 70 cuz our blood moons are pathetic.  but wow..your editing skills are awesome...and audio.  crystal clear
Wait this is the last episode
I remember watching your guys animations years ago as kid. Whether it was BFF or Doralious and Associates, I always had a good laugh. When Neebs Gaming was made, my brother and always had a good time talking about what went on in Ark or 7 Days. And now that he's a Marine and I'm a soldier attending AIT here in Fort Sill, I have a much greater  appreciation for you guys. What I'm trying to say is, from the bottom of my heart I thank you for filling our lives with laughter, and keeping both my brother and I sane while away from home. Love you guys!
That was so funny and an amazing masterwork of editing, for a future series you should look at playing some 7 Days to die modded or a game called Subsistence
Love that intro though
Doraleous is the Thick of 7 days to die
So much blood
Is there gonna be a season 2?! Or is this the end
The Doraleous Score was very generous . . .
Guys, for future reference, the zombies are attracted to the players position. If you are underground, they will just dig towards you. You put the hole too far away from you, that's why nothing was falling down the hole. I'm wondering if you knew this already and did this anyways to make  it more interesting. Thanks guys, I'm going to miss this series!
The beginning got me hyped
When i saw the ceiling crumble the first time, i knew it wouldnt be a great day
I hate Edited comments so much!
Great series! It will be greatly missed!
This was hands down my favorite series on this channel. I am truly sad to see it end. You guys did a fantastic job on it, I hope you guys return to it some day
Anyone else notice at 14:30 that on Dora's screen you can see that Simon has died 70 times? xD Poor Simon.
Simon just got\nNAE NAED
I love the song at the end
TV, movie, or video, this is one of the best series I’ve ever watched!!  All of it, the acting, the production, even the music.  Thank you!   \n\nAdahop, pulling up Doraleous’ one tactile mistake “4 days earlier” was priceless.  😂 That’s G.I.B.J. all the way, Doraleous, lol.  Beautiful!
Ya'll should do random gen instead of Navezgane! Much more challenging!
We will miss these men and we will not forget the things they did
This. This. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I love my wife too......but this....
nooooooo
Fuck no! Don't end
Appsro has 16 torches.. as in 16 candles?
Oh yey August 19th was my birthday
well seeing that this series is now over i bet your looking for a new survival game there for i nominate starbroud
... why... why the hell would you digg your self into a corner and have the only exit where they come in... im just why XD i love your stratergys
This was my favorite series
Adahop, the editing with the 1812 overture was brilliant! Well done
NOOOO THIS IS MY FAVORITE SERIES IT MUST CONTINUE!
I have to admit this was the best laugh I had in days. Wonderful vid :)
Why end it
If this is infact the last run of the series having it go out on a colossal fuck up is a great way to end it.
That music at the start reminded me of a classic Christmas movie
You guys are getting better and better at presentations, this was more entertaining than all of your past episodes put together, and far surpasses that of anything else I've seen on the game by anyone else.   Great production value.  Little harsh on the language, and using God's name in vain.  But you guys are really talented, and work well together.   How did things turn out for you guys?  You haven't been active because of the hurricane, did you manage to recover, or will it affect the future of Neebs Gaming?
This was definitely one of if not the best episode yall have done. I feel the only thing that was missing was dora's annoying ass alarm.
On year ago this series started and i watch these videos since October 6 2017
It's Soo funny how he turns down the heat. Haha. And the fact he Pressed A lol.
that lag tho
was that really adahop? and if so do you guys know that he changed the settings?
Hey guys, in panama city just after hurricane michael destroyed the place, this video had me laughing so much through this tragedy, very much brightened my day, thanks guys keep it up!
Is neebs gaming gonna end ;(
Entire time just waiting for one of them to step on a mine. I leave the tab with the video a few seconds before they blow up the dynamite without pausing it. All i can think is \"just as i predicted\".
Fucking gold... By far my favorite episode!
Wow, it takes about two months for a new horde night to come out (7 weeks)
This was quite a finally. Honestly enjoyed the hell out of this series. It was fun to watch. And I’m gonna be honest I binged this whole series in a week. From beginning to end. And I finally reached the end and I’m only a few days late. You guys rock
Great job on the videos fellas! <salute>
Best series from this channel. I wish it wouldn’t end so soon because there’s still a lot of possibilities for places to live and whatnot. Hell, instead of rebuilding a town, why not completely build your own? Build a giant wall around it that’s as impenetrable as can possibly be. I hope this series doesn’t end and will continue on. Here’s an idea, there could be episodes where everybody lives in their own place and defends it by themselves. Gives everybody a lot of space for their own ideas and there could be a town where you all meet up and exchange stuff that you need for stuff and have payment for those items, like a trader, but with varying prices or trade stuff like weapons or essentials. Basically everybody lives on their own, but everybody helps each other out and it’s further off than just down the street. It could possibly make things interesting.
Haven’t watched it yet but plz don’t let this be the last
are they done playing this?
Have to admit Im sort of sad to see this series end but its for the best.  The game is dead and you guys didnt really get the stronghold concept down anyway.  Hell did you even make a forge the entire series?  LOL!  You guys were so busy moving around the map you never really got a chance to make a funny series out of  this game.  You do the same thing with ARK but at least there there's no zombie hordes coming after you so there are definitely funnier moments in ARK than this game.
another great series is finish..  this brings  tears in my eyes i don't know what's or why for because  of the 7 days to die end or because of the how funny this episode was.. but anyways its been a wonderful series i've watched it since day 1. hope you guys make more like this. i love it! and i always listens to your commenting on comment while i'm working.. hope to hear you guys read this comment. thank you!
Going out on a massive high. Brilliant episode. It will be missed.
All that hard work doralious, for nothing😂😂
CAN YOU GIVE US A FACE REVEAL?????
Thank you neebs gaming crew for taking us on this hilariously frustrating but glorious adventure. I for one have enjoyed the ride, many laughs, tears, and fuck yourselves later have left me wanting more while also wanting to kill myself from your constant stupidity(still lol's). Hope you return to the series one day but if you never do thanks for the laughs. I enjoy all your content keep up the good work you glorious bastards! I almost forgot to thank old doraleous for making the best looking, but ultimately useless horde night bunker. You almost had it, but you dropped the ball. And you have no one to blame but yourself, you left the holes open doraleous. You invited them in, and in doing so turned what was supposed to be a safe place to ride out the night into a personal tourtue chamber for everyone...
\"SEASON\" Ending? Not series?
Lads this series has really been a pleasure to watch. I have laughed and cried tears of joy watching it.  You crack me up and are the best you tubers by a flying mile.
Single greatest 7days video
So, what happens now?
Would love to watch you guys play the forest lol with all these shenanigans
Doraleous should have just rigged the place to blow as like a fail safe. Just line the place in tnt. And bring the place down on all the zombies and them.
This is an absolute masterpiece.
Adahop, more of the ghosts when someone dies in any of the games you guys play , like Simons ghost, that was a nice touch. Great job. I hope to see more of that in the future. Really good idea.
It's sad to me this is over even if it's just for now. I was hoping all of you fine gentlemen would try the random Generated map. Given its random maybe each of you could start one choose the best one and invite the others to that world. On another note doras plan would of worked if it was all under ground with no block ceiling, only rock and dirt ect ect, I've actually made a simular base with an underground drawbridge over a casm filled with spikes. My favorite series by far. But if you guys get together and play fallout 76 in a similar way to this , then I'll have a new favorite.
Great editing for the fight montage. Loved the series. Sad to see it's done. Hope we have something as fun in replacement.
YAYA! GOT THE GOLDEN PLAY BUTTON NEEBS! GOOD JOB (even though he wont see this)
Rip seven days to die
Well guess it’s time for you guys to go back to Minecraft winks repeatedly\n\n\n\n(pls don’t)
I'm sure you will address this on the next commenting on comments, but why end both this and GTA?  Tired of it?  Making room for new stuff?  Low views?  Waiting for new content to be added to continue?  Also, is Ark on the chopping block?
For the next 7 days to die series (if you even make a second one) you guys should make it a pvp series against each other without a hord night but where you can raid each other
The doom tomb
That was the most overachieving fail ever. Well done.
Guys, I have loved watching you play 7DTD and will miss it. My 75 yr. old mom and I started playing after watching you play. We call the Bald zombie that wears the jeans and white tee shirt Thick because it looks kinda like Thick's GTA toon. So one day we were playing and my mom was killed and I asked her how she died and she said \"I got Thick'd.\" Hope this gives y'all a good laugh.
5:10 you cant make that door. Ownly cheat it in  🤔🤔🤔
please do! this series was fantastic guys but looking forward to the next one. Dammit Dora, you brilliant moron! You got everyone thick'd
as someone with too many hours in this game, it's been fantastic watching you all play it. can't believe it's been a year <3
That final battle sequence was brilliant! Great edit!
That has to be a record of team deaths in 7D2D all in one horde night
At first i was like wow simon is one of the last ones to die..................... then he never prevails to die 100 times. your the best simon
So Dora... is this what you did with the money from Nom Nom Cat?
This is why you don't do underground bases.
from the prison to journeys end, it was a wild, memorable ride. I now suggest simon plays Stranded Deep
Plz keep going with these videos..
Laughed the whole horde!! AMAZING INSANITY this was hilarious!
OOOOOOOHHHH MYYYYY GODDDDDD!!!! During the horde fight I just had my hands on my forehead with my jaw dropped. And yes, \"I'm in a fistfight with a cheerleader\" is the quote of the series.  Hahahahahahahahaha. Great work fellas, you survived Dora's deathtrap! (Kinda)
August?
By far my favorite episode neebs\nDoralious piece of advice make the pit go all the way around the base\nSimon you are getting better good job
called it! I think this was a much better ending than some bad ass horde mass slaughter. Instead the entire team got slaughtered in one of the funniest ways imaginable. Simon takes the cake and almost killed me laughing...hehe...so good
This has been teh best series you guys have done ever!   That was seriously fun!
It would have been pretty cool if the ceiling collapsed on everyone as they were fighting for the lives and then that is when the season ended
Doraleous is death hole
In another galaxy, four days earlier\n\nEnsign Doraleous: I'm sure this two-meter exhaust port won't be a problem.
those illustrations at the end are amazing!! lol simon has the rug tapped to hes body lmao
best episode ever
Despite having the most impressive construction project, this horde night managed to be the most spectacular failure. A lesson to be learned in all this: Zombies will dig through anything to get to you. I'd like to see this attempted again, though perhaps with two full layers of steel blocks surrounding the safe zone, lol.
But but it cant end..... Whatever you do dont stop doing Ark!!!
I wanna thank you guys for your great series for it has been a joy to watch for not only myself but my wife and kids. We started only last year with your 7d2d series and have watched every week and series. Hope to see y'all try again whenever the alpha 17 come out. Keep up the great work!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🤭🤭😪😪😪😪
#Breadstrong
Because I'll never tire of watching Simon die stupid deaths, I suggest you guys do a The Forest mini series.
Holy crap, this is unbelievably similar to that scene in Aliens where the marines see the aliens coming on the motion detectors, but they are actually in the ceilings!\nAwesome vid
Their might be a season 2 when Alpha 17 comes out, their adding bosses, motorcycles, gun mods, gyrocopters, and more to the game
Season finale? But you're coming back sometime soon,i hope??? Please come back some time soon!!!!
Damn just got neeb’d
there needs to be a disclaimer.  \"Do not drink soda while watching this\"....   lol
Doraleous' Death Hole.  The most metal band name ever!
9:30 It was at that moment Doraleous knew.... He fucked up
Last week when doraleis made battle ship I commented he was a building god. I now retract that compliment.
Greatest episode ever....nearly wet myself at work!
I honestly have no words for this video.
sad for seires end
This had me rolling!!
When you guys announced you were going to do 7 Days to Die, I was like booooooring. But I've been glued to this series ever since it aired. So much fun and so many memories.
Fucking love this channel
This was the funniest 7 days video yet, mainly because of the epic fail that was the death cave. Hilarious video, you guys do great work.
Does this mean you guys will have more time for creating new episodes of D&A or Mob Squad?\nProbably not but I love D&A and I hold out hope for more.
Dora that base was very impressive I believe you should get alot of props for making it even if it didn't work in this game... it's not entirely your fault the zombies dont go where you want them too
This is my favorite series on YouTube. Really bummed to see it go, but I'm super excited to see what you guys do with RDR2.
Dame you boys must have something big planned for red dead2 if you dropping 2 of your series cant wait to see it!
If you guys really do end it, please do another survival game, maybe fallout 76. I’d love to see you guys do some PvP.
I remember the first episode, and this last one, and all the ones in between. This has been the series to watch since day one. You guys did an amazing job, please don’t end!
Holy shit this has been the best series I've ever watched on youtube. Thanks Neebs gaming and everyone that has contributed to the making of it.
I think you guys need to continue with a NEW season as the A17 comes out. Love from Romania and don't forget that we LOVE 7 DAYS TO DIE .
Thank you guys so much for this fantastic series. I must admit when you did the poll for what game should you do I hated seeing 7 days to die leading. I'm really really happy it ended up winning this series was super enjoyable I'll miss it.
Neebs, remember when your videos used to get 400k+ views and you had 1/2 the subs you have right now? They used to be so much more entertaining! This is boring compared to the old stuff.
Showed such promise!!
adahop thank you so much, downloading and playing this map was like a dream come true it was amazing exploring through all the places neebs and everyone had been and visted seeing the hibachi cafe, the light house, adahops autoturret shop and more was so fun thankyou for uploading
Nothing built can last forever\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it should last longer than that!
Had to watch it twice because I was crying so hard the first time from laughing.
Please play The Forest!
Been watching this series since the start and loved every minute Thanks so much for the memories.
Thank you, \nThank you for the laughs when some of us are feeling down. Thank you for making us laugh when we are just having a great day. All of you create something that brings thousands of people together to laugh, smile and be happy. I’m a world filled with so much negativity it’s a nice break from that bullshit. Thank all you gorgeous fucking people! Look forward to the next series! \nLoves and Hugs from Montana \nJustin
You'd figure by now that you'll learned that the horde is attracted to you and not heat.
what a wild ride from start to finish! If I may, i'd like to say a little something about everyone~!\nNeebs: micromanaging less and becoming one of the strongest of warriors! \nAppsro: ...really carried the whole team i mean honestly, superb.\nDoralingus: ...you ok?? lost your marbles. but hey, the IDEA was good for this last horde night, but... big fail. \nThick: Learned to stay with the team more and heart growing 2x larger! great job!\nSimon: Saved the best for last. You knew NOTHING and i mean NOTHING for the longest time. had to be taught how to even crouch. but after all this time you learned so much and did great!! \nWonderful job everyone~ hate to see this go but it went out with a bang!
Four days earlier.....just a minor flaw that sounds similar to the death star....
I love all the content you fellas create, but the 7 days content was something else. I will deeply miss this series however I know whatever you guys do, I and everyone else will love it. Keep up the absolutely amazing work you do!!
I will miss this series. My favorite 😪😢😭
thank god for Simon
Awesome series, awesome ending.  Good show gentlemen....good show.
Loved this from beginning to end! Goodbye 7 Days to Die. Look forward to watching reruns.
Neebs I'm really Gonna miss this at first I thought this series was stupid. But then when I actually watched it I'm like this is awesome like I said sad to see it go. have fun playing red dead redemption I have also been waiting for it pre ordered it in July.
This was one of the only things i looked forward to every week i hope yall are planning somthing good
By season finale does that mean that you will start over for season 2 on a different map or area?
Neebs you guys should play some Connan exiles.
the somedays mean A17 guys ;) ?
Kinda wish you revisited the other locstions, but this was still a good ending to a great series
u guys need another serious same map just dont let the one who shall not be named build your defences
This episode along with the horde night in the lighthouse are by far the best ones in this series. And this one is just a perfect way to end a series. Everything was well made, thanks to the way you play and Adahop edits. I was actually feeling anxious with all the anticipation. These two episodes I mentioned are the ones I laughed the hardest and for the most parts of the video. \n\nAbout future projects, if you want to entertain, have Doraleous build everything, but if your goal is to have a relatively safe night, don´t let him do anything. \nThe thing the sums up this hole evening is that a bunker where everything seemed well thought out and carefully crafted with all the blades, mines, spikes and the protection wall ends up with Neebs fighting a zombie cheerleader with his fists. \n\nIn the end, I absolutely loved this series, will watch it again someday for sure and I hope that you really return to it someday, if not on this map let it be on the new one. Amazing work by everyone and I can´t wait for the stuff you have planned for us.
No more 7 days??? D:
Damn I can't stop laughing at this video dammit my stomach hurt of laughter
Sad to see it end but my god what a memorable finish. Doraleous's glorious death hole and Adahop's top notch editing. Oh boy how I laughed.
This video reminds me of the last day of high school. I wanted to \"DIE\" 18 times.......
That was an incredible end to an enjoyable season!! I hope you guys do revisit this game in the future. I would love to see you guys create a base from scratch. Until then I look forward to your next series :)
Never got to see Simon build a horde night defense so disappointed.
I hope this isn't the last of 7 days this series is my favorite and id hate to see it go
Time to vote for the next game
Doraleus; you are are a true gem :) don't ever change!
So sad to see it end, but excited to see what is next! Thank y’all for a FANTASTIC finale! ❤️ It’s been one of our favorites since my husband turned me on to Neebs gaming about a year ago! Seven Days became a big part of date night for us! 😊❤️ Keep up the great work!
So can we get neebsyvaina season 2 now please
When do we get season 2, this was brilliant!
“I like to die with a lot of things.” - Simon
😂😭 It's been emotional. What a roller-coaster. Goodbye 7 Days. It's like a little part of me had died. But I'm excited to see where we go next. I wonder what game they have in store for us.
Simon’s acting when he dies, and the noise he makes mid sentence, is so fantastic. I genuinely and without any sarcasm love the way he performs those moments.
Do more 7 day to die videos and i like watching your 7 days to die videos
Aww, I will miss watching this Friday after work. Hope to see more in the future ♥️
6 minutes and 20 seconds into the episode \"leveling up\" is the exact moment Doraleous doomed you all.  Flashback at 10:15
Oh boy.. i loved this series.. thick singing the song at the end added huge impact, well done Adahop!
7000 deaths to die.
Finale? ur the reason im buyin xb1 n buying 7 days
Thanks guys for making this awesome series :) hope u will pick it up some day again
You played that game already for more than 300h :o
I can't describe what i'm feeling right now, but it's not good :( All my love to you guys <3
Amazing series, hope it returns before too long! Need Simon to build a base!
Utterly fantastic. Great job, loved every minute.
Guys, \nI'm so gutted that this has come to an end, but what a finish, complete chaos as the series deserved.\nYou have turned a game I bought and hardly played, into one of my fave watches on YouTube and a game I play so much more now!!! \nYou are all legends, and i still need to join you guys ha! \nMuch Love x
I hope this isn’t the end because I really enjoyed watching this series from the ground up
Plz hit like on this guys so maybe it can be answered on one of their questions vids. \n\nAre you guys ending this one so you can start on a new one? I know fallout 76 is around the corner, and Dayz is starting to pick up speed on console (which a lot of us console gamers watch you guys too). Just wondering what’s next?
Anybody else smell a Conspiracy going on?
This was the video that I watched untill there was 1% left one my phone glad it was this one
Do a random gen!
Nooooooooooo
this episode is even better the second time you watch it. \nif you know whats gonna happen, it's just great to see how confident they are at the beginning.
This funny as all get out
Had complete confidence with their plan. Then the hoard started.
Anthony you filthy saboteur you! I'd recognize those pudgy hands anywhere!
Great success!!!!
Wall of blade traps and a tower...
This is by FAR one of the best videos you guys have done!! I have never laughed so hard!! LMAO fantastic!
Best video in the series yet. Too damn hilarious all around. :,)
its was verry funny to watch, loved it
so, is this the end of season one of 7 days to die? or the end end? if its the end end, play Unturned next. Its broken and awsome, lots of guns, thick would love it
With this series on hiatus for the time being and the GTA one looking like it's going on pause for RDR2, I make the following suggestion: Have Simon do Conan Exiles for 7 days (or episodes) alone. No help. He can do his own research on the game, but no other help. The game got several updates recently including animal taming, has a basic structure like Ark but with decent NPCs, and even has some quests in it. Have Simon work on the game and setting up a base, town, castle or whatever his architech/homebuilder heart desires, and THEN allow the rest of the crew to come in. Let Simon, for once, try taking the lead.
👏👏👏 Bravo guys, Bravo
clap clap clap
thick's original 7 days to die theme is unbelievably awesome...and that's an understatement
An absolutely brillliant ending to an excellent series. Had me in stitches so many times. Definitely looking forward to whatever you guys do next. Thank you all.
You should have had a backup plan to place explosives in the tunnel to collapse it if shit hit the fan. Which, lets be honest, was inevitable.
you guys are the best.  so good.
Season or Series Finale?
So does that mean more time for another series like GTA, Ark, or Scrap.
laughing so much this video. Working a 12 night shift and the other guys in the office were wondering what I was losing my shit, so rewatched it with them now safe to stay Neebs gaming as two new fans as both of them are now binge watching ark and 7 days to die and BFF.
Neebs Gaming Crew, you lightened my path through dark days of illness and depression with all your hard work and humor. If therapy didn't work ... you did. Even if it was only for an hour here and there.\n\nYou may not reach the whole world, but THIS is world peace for me, that's for sure.\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH! There aren't enough words, to describe what you've given me.\n\nAnd being someone who has spent a lot of time lately on youtube, I'd also like to thank this fabulous community. I have never read or felt so much positivity anywhere else!
This was by far the best 7 day i sean from you guys keep up the good work an this is the funniest i sean in a while
Nooooo I want it to keep going
Please do some rust
I feel like those baby hands at the beginning of the video are Simon.
Lmao this episode was amazing I never laughed so hard in a while
Season finale of series finale? 🤔🤔
Sad to see this series go. But what a clusterfuck to end on. I can't wait to see what you replace 7 days to die with. I was hoping to see Simon prepare for a horde night :P.
Remember on the first episode they all ganged up on a deer and fired the arrows all at once?
Gonna miss this series.
I fucking love every single one of you.
GOLD haha who knew they could dig so much dirtXD
OMG awesome video. The editing is outstanding. Adahop you are a master sir.
That was epic, great ending to the series guys bravo!!!
I really hope another company picks up 7 days for the console. I loved this game.
Every episode i see is the best i have ever seen on the channel ❤️
Well that went better than expected.
This is now in tomb raider
The FPS arghh
i guess that's me done watching  until A17 arrives, 7 days brought me to Neebs and i don't play any of the other games so i have zero interest in watching them. try some of the modded versions until A17, i'd love to hear the guys when the voices in the night start :)
I say Doraleous experienced water damage during the hurricane, but he started building this long before that. The real evil here is Adahop cranking up the difficulty to Max.
The noises Simon makes when he dies are the best lol
the death noises made me laugh instant
oh season finale i hope not a series finale
Congrats, epic finale.
7 days song version at end of video is best ever. Awesome finale boys. Love y'all.
all I can say about dora death trap is to quote Karl Kraus \" A paradox arises  when premature insight clashes with prevailing nonsense \"THICK44 ROCKS
I wish the air drops wouldn't have been added. I'd rather find buried cashes instead of the airplanes in a post apocalyptic world.  Still love this game
Wait so is 7 days to die really done for?
And here I thought the last horde night was a clusterf**k...
Safest horde night ever
By far the funniest episode ever.... sitting on a bus in Japan literally laughing my ass off! Bunch of Japanese people sitting all around me, staring at the white guy giggling....judging.... but hey! Worth it!!!! Don’t quit this series!!! We love it!!!!!
Best series ever with a really hilarious ending sad to see it go but this will always one my series
so whens season 2 coming?
season final nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!\nthese r the best 7 days to die videos ever!
duckduckgoose
Don’t end it here!
Amazing just amazing 👌😂😂
So is this the end for 7days please don’t be
I enjoyed this so much keep up the great content guys.
Wow, the whole series flew by just like that. Welp, time for a rewatch
Well you cant fault Dora, the room did exactly what it was designed to do. Kill. Lol
So...Doraleous Simon Thick'd everyone? Is that another new saying?
doraleous you fuckung idiot
Couldn't have asked for a better ending.
play the forest
I feel like I just watched a loved one die with the ending of this series
This was just what I needed. Thanks ya'll. I love you.
Incredible Cant wait for next time you guys  revisit this game
That was freaking amazing. It was awesome I tell you. Great ending.
Noooo why does it have to end I loved this game you guys are the best but on the up side it was in hell of a way to end
Good episode and is it end of the series? If so why thought, can you kindly explain why? Thx !
Its over, damn i was hoping to see Simons horde night base.
You guys always cancel the best series :(
What game are you guys gunna play and make a series out of now?
Best. Horde. Night. Ever. Thanks guys. You're the best!
it would have been boring otherwise. not much interesting in this game to do.
This is the best 7d2d vid in your whole series might even be one of the funniest if not the funniest vid you guys have made, good job
LOL epic
I knew this was going to happen ever since Dora revealed it.I literally thought \"the zombies are just gonna dig to em\"Btw The zombies will always go to the closest block to the player and dig through the rest.
Hi
i hope you will continue someday and hope alpha 17 will come out soon because with the new system it would make the game feel different
i cant believe how long its been since episode 1 feels like only a few months ago you started this, i wish there was more to come but i'm keen to see what will replace this. love you guys time to rewatch the entire series!!
Hands down the best episode of anything on neebs gaming! And whatever is next on the list is a distant second. You guys have truly outdone yourselves!
Ah man, haven’t laughed that long and hard in a long time!
You guys raised the bar on this one this is easily the best video on YouTube ever I really hope to see more 7d2d maybe war of the walkers mod yall would have a blast with that one please don't let this series die it's too damn good and brings happiness to people who need it you guys rock and Simon for president of neebs gaming lol with neebs telling him how to do it from the background lol
Who wants to see them play Conan exiles?
I laughed so hard my chest hurts now.
Please continue this or start another series like it.
Doraleous just Thick'd you guys.
End of an era. Such a good season of laughs!
So is it over?
If I'm stuck in a zombie apacolypse with doraleous, I am not letting him make defenses, maybe kill him just in case.
Anyone else notice that Simon says: Bob Wire?? As opposed to Barbed Wire? 😂
The crescendo on the music was good but with all those deaths back to back I'd have used the death music from Ninja Gaiden xD
Doraleus's Temple of Doom
Lost for words on how spectacularly funny this episode was. Excellent works guys.
If the game's AI wasn't retarded it would have worked fine
Where will my life be without this series?
One vote for sooner than later.
This got me laughing so much it was great. thanks guy for making my day a great one. keep up the content, you are my top favorite channel to watch and have a good time watching you guys. Thanks again MotoIB
So sad to see this series end! It was what got my husband and I into watching your channel... You guys are amazing, thanks for the hours of entertainment!  Can't wait to see what you guys come up with next :)
Is this the last 7 days to die episode ever? If so I am sad to see it go
14:16 simon has died 5 times in a matter of seconds
That was glorious.
Am not gonna lie I didn't like the game but I only liked it because new s and the gang was In it
Loved this video! Great job with editing adahop! I laughed so hard. If you guys are moving on to a new game please let it be one where you all play together and go from day 1- end, like Ark, Minecraft and 7 Days. KEEP IT UP!! Best thing on YouTube
I really hope you guys decide to come back to this game soon, i had a lot of fun watching you guys play it
Bravo! I want you guys to know that you literally create art. I love the way you guys stage your story lines, and the way you execute those stories. Love all of your acting. Your characters are great. Editing is on point, which probably pulls it all together, Phenomenal job, phenomenal channeI.  Your work is truly at the top of the YouTube spectrum. Keep up the great work, can't wait for the next thing you do.  Doraleous, FYI you still owe me twenty bucks from that bar tab in Charleston earlier this year. #FourManMosas.
Ok that didn't quite work out the way you anticipated but we can move on from this. This was an awesome series and thanks for sharing it with us. I look forwards to what's next, you haven't failed me yet. Kisses
Maybe you guys could do another 7d2d series, but everyone starts in creative mode and builds one big horde night  defense base or their own horde night defense base and then they defend said base against a massive horde, especially if you fast forward the days to something like day 1001. The guys could even be given a choice of 5 weapons that are random quality from 450 to max, then allowed to stock as much ammo and supplies as they want. Then Adahop could also spawn in a bunch of zombies of various/random types on top of the horde night ones, up to a random number between 20 and 300.\n\nAfter that Adahop showcases his horde night defense base, while the guys each take turns in creative mode spawning in a random number/type of zombies
Ye got fu#ked up!!
Do you guys plan on going back to playing kingdom come deliverance again now that it's finished? I think all of you except simon would love it
Best horde night ever
You guys should start the Forest!!
Season finale! Does that mean there's a season two? Cause I'd love to have that.
Fucking well done adahop!
omg guys that was amazing\ngreatest fail ever i couldnt stop laughing\nadahop especially insane job with the editing and making the death montage and flash backs
By far the best possible finale ever! That bunker may have collapsed but it made the whole season end just perfect. Well Done!
Best episode ever, Simon I'm sorry but you getting worked over bye those traps was perfect.
SO Here I am With my dinner watching Need Gaming But I cannot eat my food do you know Why??\nBecause I could not stop laughing my  ass off\nDoraleous you are Fucking Awesome I give you a greeting
This was the funniest episode by far! Great work guys. Keep up the amazing work!!
That was fabulous! What a way to go out!
And y’all got Thickd
Please don’t end this series
Absolutely loved this series, great ending, so glad it didn’t end with a cliff hanger.  I like how adahop has his own button. Can’t wait till you guys get back to it.
Well, if there actually is a zombie apocalypse.. I'm teaming with Thick. Least amount of deaths, cause he gets kills not killed. #TeamThick44
That was a glorious cluster fuck!
Thanks for the laughs fellas! I will miss this
What a fantastic episode and I'm really going to miss this series.
So this is it? The last 7D2D? Like ever? Or is this just the end of the season and they're going to another one?
7:46 thats what she said!
Wait is thick leaving?
This was truly a magnificent piece of work from the whole neebs gaming team, Thank you for the amazingly hilarious last episode of 7 days!!!
\"Download the map, just remember to fill the hole\"
So much for just sitting and drinking a beer for this hoard
Fuck ya wat a way to end 7 days👍👌
Fun ending guys
I hate to see this series end, it is what brought me to this channel!  Absolutely fantastic finale. Doraleous always means well...😹  I just hope after you take a break from this game- you’ll wanna revisit it. Love, love, love, you guys!  Keep up the great work. I look forward to any content you guys create.
Zombies shouldn’t be able to dig in the first place..good job Dora, that shit was dope
Anyone wanna count the amount of deaths for this episode please let me know
Neebs gaming I just love you guys man☠️\nYou guys create the best content and y’all are very entertaining
Doraleous sure knows how to throw one helluva Halloween party
Great ending. I am glad you guys are letting it rest, so when the update finally come out we'll be ready for more.
and then everyone died. the end
And also i wanna say that it WAS the torches that made your plans fail.
If you look up what FUBAR means you'll probably find this video. LOL
This is really sad but i think its a good Idea becuase you have already milked this com cus when Youve built a giant-ASS bunker and defaeted like day 50 or so then you have besat the game and hopefully you find another really good series to play. Kisses
Season finale! What am I supposed to do on a Friday now? Go out? Talk to the wife? What are you guys trying to do to me! At least my Saturdays are still safe... Ark is life
best episode so far!!!
I hope its not the end of these series.
Season Finale!?! please don't take too long to pick this game up again. this has been one of my favorite series made by you guys. every time I watch you guys play this game I get the urge to play, then I remember I don't have any friends to play with and it goes away... FML. you guys are the best! keep up the good work!
Omg guys that was the best episode yet! I am holding my 8 month old and woke him up so many times laughing my ass off. This is seriously my favorite series
The Neebs Gaming crew death sounds!
Note to self never let doraleous plan horde night.
That was fucking hilarious...
When building underground bunkers zombies will always go to the closest point to you which is directly overhead fire barrels also do not attract zombies like it says they do capp00 tested this out you were never gonna get more than a few to fall down that whole unless you stood under it the whole time :)
well, that was a cluster fuck.
Please say this isnt the end..
So when they say Season Finale are they ending 7 days. Or are they just taking a break from it. Also the Fallout 76 Beta is coming soon. Maybe you guys should hop on
That was one of the best episodes ever.\nThere have only been a few Youtube videos I have watched that have made me laugh so hard.\nBTW; what was the song at the end?
Ya'll got {°~°}THICK{°~°}awesome job adahop.. keep up da guud work NEEBS GAMING like wise ALOHA NUI LOA
Doraleus! If you’re going to fail, fail spectacularly! This was hilarious. \n\nThank you so much to Neebs Gaming for this awesome show and I’m sad to see it is the end of the season! But all good (possibly great) things must comes to an end. Can’t wait to see what coming next!
Only you guys can fuck up something like this 😂😂
My wife and me love the series , AMAZING !!!!!!!! video you made guys. I hope you make another season with the new updated for 7 days to die
That was great best ep thanks sooo much
I don't know why but I found this series more entertaining than the Ark episodes. Maybe it's because of all the ideas that go terribly wrong.
simply epic!
I miss only one sentence \"We survive the horde night\"
Best Horde Night EVER
The best episode of the series! It's funny how I saw this coming lol
Shouldve called the video simon died
OMG - I laughed so hard!  Congrats on your 1 Million subs ( I am prob late in saying so but oh well) .... what a way to celebrate that.  So many little moments that one could speak of and cheer at or jeer at, but honestly I want to say Thank you for the many laughs and time WELL wasted lol !
Much love and thanks for the beautiful journey guys #DoraTomb
Amazing finale guys! I think i can safely say i've watched every episode since go! I can't wait to see what's next for you guys! :)
This is why we don't cut corners folks!!
Does this mean 7 days to die is over?
This is the single greatest one of the series. I'm so blown away from the intro to the exit. Watching the evolution process, from the editing to the gameplay antics, which takes place with every new release is a thing of beauty. Can't wait to see what you guys do next. 😘#KissesCuteButt
Hey for the Next Comment on Comment, this episode was on my Birthday and now I am 27 years old. I have been watching your 7 Days and Ark for a while after work and great to watch after having a bad day. Thick you are the best including Appsro. Neebs being to technical and picky, Lord knows why. Dora you are a cheeky son of a gun and Simon being Simon. I can't wait what's in store for you guys in the future videos.\nPeace out and #Thick44GetsKills
Fuck Man i will really Miss this
Soo goof im sad its over. Bless yr hearts
This is the best episode lmao. Fist fight with a cheerleader. Omg lmao.\n\nSo 7 days is no more? Or just taking a break?
this was the best thing very i loved every second of it. i'm sad that this is the finale video, but ill be really happy whenever you guys do go back to it this was one of your best seasons. thank you guys so much for the great content and for all the laughs. and also cheering up my bad day. i love you guy. and keep making great content
Oh, It was August 19th. It should've been right time to stop playing A16 and wait for A17 to be released. Too bad it's delayed.
This is my favorite  game that you guys did u  did a great job it's sad to see it end
And with this our intrepid heroes learn why everybody lines their bunkers on all sides  with reinforced concrete  XD
Well
That was such a good freaking horde night and a perfect ending to the series.
Favorite Series by far from the beginning to the end it as the best to watch by far.
Thanks Doraleous for making my day, Doraleous for NGP\nSeriously if Dora be the president we will have this kind of fun stuff all the time and I like it this way
No I can't live without this series
Oh Lord that was a damn good video. I've not laughed like that at something for a while. Doraleous, it was such a good plan on paper, I'd have loved to see it all pan out as planned but this was so much better than anyone could have imagined. Thanks for all the amazingly good content guys keep it up. Cant wait to see what else you guys get up to in the future.
This was the series I looked forward to every week. I hope you guys decide to carry on with it at some point, but if not, watching the episodes over again still makes me laugh. Love you guys!
In all the  years I have been subscribed, this is without a doubt the finest, most spectacular creation I have witnessed on your channel, I honestly haven't laughed aloud so much in my recent history. Thank you Doralicious! Doraleous for President of Neebs Gaming, it's no longer a competition.
So funny thank you for the great videos.
Just build a tower and surround it with blades and spikes
This was an AWESOME series!!!!!! LOVED IT!!!! Need shirts for this game too ^_^
AMAZING!! Absolutely hilarious
This isn't a mine it's a tomb.
who knew zombies were so smart
Epic way to end.
Bravo, everyone! Seriously enjoyed the series. If make more, we'll watch more.
i wonder what would the result be without the hardening before
Awwwww what a great way to end a fenominal series I'm going to miss this so dam much!!!
Ah well, might as well end the series on a high note. Thanks a lot for making it (and to Adahop for editing it), it's been a blast to watch!
You guys should do a state of decay 2 series next it's a really fun zombie survival or you should do a coop dying light with appsro and thick
Great use of Tchaikovsky's Cannonball
I can’t express how many laughs and good times you all have given my boyfriend and I over the past two years. We love all of your videos and wait in anticipation for each one to be uploaded. I’m going to miss the 7 days to die series as it was my favorite but I’m hoping you’ll be playing Red Dead soon! We love you guys!!
I like the music at the end i dont normally like rock but i liked that doing
I really hope you guys bring this series back soon
OK, this is the best episode ever made.
Great wrap up video.  Now for some SEA OF THIEVES videos..
Is that Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture? Man this is among the best video of the channel!
My girlfriend and I watch all your videos and 7D2D has been our favorite series. When/if you visit 7D2D again we will be watching.
Is that really the end of the series?
Best ever. \nBest ever from Neebs & Co. \nBest ever 7D2D video. \nOne of the very few re-watchable 7D2D videos. \nI’m going to watch it again, right now, and probably annoy my wife, again, by laughing out loud, while she’s reading.
Hopefully for season 2 will be after next update and random map
Eh, I aint watched just yet but I need to know...\nWhat the hell is meant by \"season finale\"??
Absolutely loved every episode.  You guys are fantastic!
PLEASE tell me you guys are going to start another season in A17
Lmfaoo!  Well played guys.  Hate that's the end I watched the entire series multiple times.  P.s. I could watch you guys die all day.      \"OH NICE PUPPY, BBLEHHH\"  rolling!
I think the guy in the intro is Thick44 because he always claims  \"I ... AM A WARRIOR!!!!\"
Will you be doing another season, this was sooooo fun to watch me and my girlfriend look forward to it every week
Thank you for all the great videos in this season....you guys rocked it
Dangit I thought they noticed that if ur underground the zombie that are on the surface dig right on top of you please pin this so others see
I'm 42 seconds in and I already know it's funny like a midget sjw😂😂
Dora's base sucked so much Simon die here more then all of his deaths added together
So sad to see this series end.😢 My Fridays won't be complete anymore. Always looked forward to 7 days episodes, please come back to it when alpha 17 hits. Love you guys!!
My favourite part was when the the zombies attacked...
Ugh... So now it's Ark... :( I loved Subnautica, grew to really enjoy this but have always disliked Ark. Now the two best shows on the channel are gone... >_< Revisit Subnautica or do something similar. :(
This was good
y'know, i thought this would be the most safe horde night they would have, and that it would just be them watching zombies drop and get shredded. Exact opposite
If this show ever comes back, I want to see Simon's action plan for the next horde night. Can't be any worse than Dora's build.
RIP Simon
Now you guys should play empyrion
Rock n roll thick. I'm genuinely impressed with you guitar skills, I'm sure that's you playing. Right on man.
I only think they are gonna make a new season fresh and spawn with nothing again... maybe this is just my theory.\nOr this could be the end:(
Sucks when the horde doesn't follow the plan! LOL
Simon  score : rrraaawwrrbaba(sound he makes when he dies) great finale!
When the music started I was saluting for remainder of video.
The best laid plans of mice and Neebs Gaming.
I have been with you guys since before neebs gaming but I swear to Christ, if you kill this serious but keep playing scrap mechanics, you guys are dead to me.... Ok, probably not, but I will be pretty disappointed
Not your day!
So next season Simon should be in charge of hoard night.
Wait, was this the last video of 7days? I loved this series so much!
This is the best video yet!! So much death and faillure, love it!
Please keep doing some kind of zombie survival game series....even if it's not 7 days to die
I cryed from the laugh ;D But I feel little sorry for Dora He really worked lot for this horde night and it's becomed an epic fail.
hey guys theres a prison by that that green fog place if u guys can I would love to see u guys build there for the next horde its already build to hold against a small horde.
What's that song right in the end?
This is one of the best episodes I have seen. I cant not tell how hard I laughed. From the zombies digging  down to the epic fail of everything. Thanks for the entertainment you guys rock.. well except Neebs because I do not want your heads to swell
\"He wants a torch! GIVE THAT MAN A TORCH!!! \" - Neebs \nI'm done 😂😂😭😂
Dorralleus didn’t plug holes
FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST FOREST...now that I have your attention, I think it's time for you all to replace this game with the forest. I feel like you all can have a good series out of this. My kids and I had a great laugh through out this episode.
How the hell did the zombies get stuck
My dad just passed away yesterday morning. Not looking for likes or sympathy just wanted to say thank you neebs gaming for making this less hard on me.. Hug your loved ones and tell them how much you love them.
hey neebs try out fortnight save the world it has zombies too (:ps:love the channel
Omg this was the best series I have ever watched on youtube. Been here since the first episode and was sooo excited for every new one. When I saw your 7 days to die videos in my sub box, it was always the first video I clicked. Excellent series and I hope to see season two in the future.👌🏽👌🏽😊\n\n                                         -Ethan
Love it, you guys help fight depression! Thank you!
Minecraft holes or Doraleous Death Holes... Simon just can't resist um.
such a good intro. Very creative and fun
You couldn't find a better way to end this season! Thanks Dora, you are responsible for the best episode ever! \n\n\n\nNow we just wait for that update, right? :D
I love how Dora is laughing the whole time....
Oh god I'm so freaking sad that this is over!!!! :( :( This is my favourite series by far and i love them all so that's saying something. Hopefully you guys will start again with Alpha 17 since there's so much more to come with that release. Love you guys, Jocelyn (aka iwuuvyew) p.s. Ada, you have outdone yourself my friend. Absolutely amazing job!!!
Dora completely ignored the hole leading straight into the bunker😂
Great final episode fellas
Championship episode! You know you succeeded when Neebs has to break character. Epic series, epic team. I wonder if there is a death tracker to see how many ways Simon died. Best way to start the day. Hugs and kisses from Corpus Christi.
Now you guys have finished 7 Days to Die will you be starting a fallout 76 series ?
The bunker seemed like a good idea on paper Dora
Loved this series so much, thanks to all involved.  Hope to see you back when they eventually update the game.
(Insert ‘The📝🗄 Office’ Reference Here ➡️) Zah Best!! -Hei-De
FFS Doralingus! I wanna see what this horde would be like without those holes above the safe room!
Thanks for the memories!
Doraleous should be punished for causing the most deaths in the series
No matter what happens in the future, there will never a fuck up like this colossal mess.. absolute loved it, this would have killed cooter if he hadn’t already died, and yes we know it’s a different game
this was the best horde night ever. i was laughing so hard. \n\nand then i realized\n\nTHIS IS THE END OF 7 DAYS???? this series was a masterpiece
Sigh... you know. Journey’s End should be spelled with an apostrophe. I know, I know. But the End belongs to the Journey, right? Just cause we are drowning in Russian collusion, doesn’t mean we should spell like em. Just sayin, later fellas. I really enjoyed the series.
If i could only ask for two things in this life, it would be more Neebs seven days to die, and more Doraleous and associates.
The only thing to make this episode better would be if the bunker was a trap the whole time and it was blown making it the final tomb.
Season 2? 😏
Spectacular, this failure satiates me.
can someone explain the copy and paste at the end?
You guys have to let doraleus prep for hord night everytime this was definitely the most entertaining one yet
this palce aint haunted this place is cursed
Silly fuckers
More seven days to die😍😘
The 1812 Overture playing at the end was massively epic! I saw Doraleous Death Hole on the Family Values tour in '98. Please bring a new season on this series if A17 ever releases in our lifetime. (I want an Adahop key on my computer now)
Next time have a plan 2.\nYes, I'm using numbers instead of letters so I don't ran out of plans.
Just for future reference you guys got upset over the beakers in the supply drop, but beakers actually sell for a lot of tokens at traders
F
Oh the carnage, an epic end to an epic series
This may have been the third time I've watched this video. Thankyou
Best hoard night ever
I'm so fucking sad right now. Loved this series. Hope updates makes it come back better.
One of the best youtube series of all time
After weeks of Dora preparing for hoard night all by himself while the others piss fart around doing sweet fuck all episode after episode, the second it goes wrong you all blame Dora? Fuck you guys. Dora should have left them all to fend for themselves on the surface. Love you Dora, you sexy sexy man!
Is that metal thick at the end? Hopefully the fun pimps hear it and sneak you guys into alpha 17! Great episode, so funny I spat out my Weetabix
I'll save y'all the trouble of watching with 3 words... Failed death montage
For all this y'all should've just made a big ass pitfall
Please Check out Osiris: New Dawn for possible new content!
...really had high hopes for this
A great way to end a great series well done guy's well done
Nooo! This series was gold. Gold I tell you!
Will you guys do a PvP game just for fun?
- German encirclement and subsequent occupation of the Maginot Line - 1940 colorized
I loved it I just kept hearing Benny hill chase music in my head
LMFAO!! Called it XD\n\nWell done guys :D I dunno what's funnier.. the fact that Dora fucked you all or the fact he laughed the entire time XD
T-shirt concept,  “Simon died again”, “did Simon die?” , Or “ Simon’s dead”
BRAVO Gentlemen...……….BRAVO !!
I would of liked to see Simon organise a horde night setting it up how he wanted it. but great series, amazing ending. Can't wait to see the next one you bring out! keep it up :)
All good things come to an end.
338 hours? them are rookie numbers boys
Now I really can’t wait for alpha 17 to drop
I've been being patient this whole time with the devs getting A17 out, but if my favorites series from you all hinges on it then my patience is suddenly out the window.
I loved it
I'm going to miss this series!
you know they'll never return to a game when they say they'll probably return to it some day... but damn what an awesome run this series had, especially for a game that is mediocre at best
I ain't even sad about the end of this series because that just means we may be getting a new series, and that's always good. Can't wait to see what it could be.
Ok fella that was amazing. Thanks for the wonderful series and props to ada for the perfection that is his editing!!
damn what a way to end the series! Whether or not you guys make another one is up to you, but this was fantastic and I certainly hope you do! Good luck my boys
When I said best base yet ....i was mistaken. It just looked good..and could have been good... apologies.
I love how Doraleous had zero concern for that hole while he was building this bunker.
Actually kind of glad the bunker failed as drastically as it did, in truth it made for a better end to the series than seeing the guys just beast through another horde night.\n\nOutstanding series from beginning to end, can’t wait to see what you guys come up with next. Would love to see this game revisited in some form down the line
Dear god, I was waiting for the score at the end and instead noticed that you said something like you were gonna stop making 7days to die videos. Please put this on commenting on comments and answer what you guys really mean. Is the series on a halt?
Play Call of Duty BO4. Zombies and Blackout. Will be great/funny videos!
Best. Video. Ever! Can’t wait to see what y’all do in alpha 17.
Even better than your usual awesomeness. Looking forward to when you return to this game, and what you plan to play next. Maybe Fallout 76?\n\nAnd Adahop for president.
Please play dont starve together next
Damnit, Anthonyhop.
Anyone else notice the date of the break in didn't match with the date the last time 7dtd was played? Also, I'm so sad you won't continue the series. I loved the amount of laughter it brought and you guys made it such a show. You guys are awesome and Simon is also funny 😆😜
Get rid of the shitty cookie cutter music.
The 1812 was nice touch guys.
One of the best series to watch, sad that it had to end. Hopefully you guy play Alpha 17 when it come out.
Please don't stop making 7 Days To Die videos!!!!!
So did Doraleous finally break and kill everyone? Was that his plan all along?
What's next for Friday's? Coc?
Best season finale ever..... BRAVO Neebs gaming and Adahop!!!\n\nAnd BRAVO Anthony duck whatever..
Don’t u guys dare end this series. Il let u have a break till alpha 17 and that’s it go to random gen or something
I work late shifts every other week. That means that im alone at the kitchen table with no one to talk to. But watching this 7D2D series has kept my mood up and given me comfort after a days hard grind at the saltmines.\nSo thanx NEEB´s Gaming Crew and everybody who goes into making this possible for ME to watch. \nBig hugs from Sweden. You have given a worn soul some light to warm itself by. Keep it up. :)
What editing software do you guys use? Love what you guys do!
It was a great season
I am so sad this is the end 😭😭💔

Thus is the best finally
That song was awesome!
I LOVE IT, but one thing NEVER EVER LET DORALEOUS ever build you base please😓, and this mark (hopefully😓) end the 7 days to die series, and the start of season 2 of it or the start of minecraft survival again, or ( which is what I want) the start of emperion galactic survival ( I'm hoping its emperion galactic survival, because that would be SO COOL just saying)🤘😘😍🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗 #winnerwinnerchickendrumstickwinner
Your video titles have been dark lately, you all better not be breaking up the band or some dumb shit like that. We all love the videos way to much.
That was painful.
The setup wasn't bad and that covered hole wasn't really the problem. You need to plan how to lead them to you. Zombies will take the easiest route to you and will path through doorways even when closed. \nIf you lock yourself in a room without doors or climb to a spot they can't reach, which looks to be the case here, they will path straight through terrain to you.\nAlso, need an exit plan if they breach..
Will there be more next week
I love your taste in music lol
This was a funny way to end it but I can’t help but feel sad that it’s over I’ve been watching this series since day 1!!!!
Nooooooo!!\nIts the end😣😣\nMake season 2 please?
Well done boys! Amazing ending to a great series.
The only thing to make this better is if there was a fail safe of just blowing the entire room up
I retract last weeks comment that Dora should be president
Thick44 can sing I like that song at the end
Thank god this show is ending. The only episodes worth watching were the hoard nights.
You Sank my Battle Hole
21:36\n\nTrying to use the communication wheel in ARK like...
OMG can stop laughing
Noooo! Please don't end the series Neebs Gaming. 7 Days To Die is my all time flavored series by you guys. it is awesome. You guys are awesome. Anyways keep up the stellar work guys, especially you Appsro.      \n\nP.S.\nWhy the fuck does Neebs build a Fucking barn in every video game.
I'm so happy that I waited all day to watch this, a rough day of 16hrs of work finished off with laughing out loud with my cat at Simon blender hopping lol I think my neighbors think I'm crazy now. You guys are so fucking cool!!!!
Why are you stopping!?
That was so craptacular I was laughing so hard I cried.
Hi neebs gaming
That was glorious
All that work Doraleous did couldn’t have been more anticlimactic.
Eh pretty great episode despite adashit rigging the game. Great job as always 5 of you guys are hilarious.
The fortress was a lie all along!
“I’m in a fist fight with a cheerleader”\nQuote of the day neebs my good man.
Man, I really love y'all NOOBS!
Start a new series - Commenting on Public
Your thermostat is broken
I know this is likely not even gonna be featured on next commenting on comments, but why is this series ending? By far my favourite series by you guys.\n\n(I've seen several seasoned youtubers do playthroughs of late game horde nights and Doraleous' idea was the general strategy of all of them. I was puzzled how this one was failing from all the rest, about a minute later I got my answer. Best horde night ever!)
Holy fuck balls best horde yet
Is that why y'all wanted to travel to journeys end? Well gta say i loved the series and i'm looking forward for somerhing new.
do you guys ever play with your fans?
Bravo gentlemen. Bravo. \"Slow clap\"
Quote of the vid: \"Doraleous' death hole\" - gold!
Great series, gutted to see it finished but totally understand the limitations of 7dtd. I look forward to seeing what you fill the slot with. I understand you just did a first and last day in Aberration but with Extinctions delay it's never a better time to give Aberration a go.
Favorite episode by far
Frikcen spazing out coz the outro so dang amazing
Who has control of the thermostat in your office? I’m sure you guys argue about the temperature all the time.
Best/worst/funniest 7 dtd episode EVER!😂😂😂
Died more than every other episode combined
Fantastic editing, great bunker, I'm sorry we didn't get to see it work quite as intended. Well done, everyone.
I'm genuinely sad, please come back to it, my Fridays will never be the same :(
Holy poop you guys ended that right on the expiration date and I’m not disappointed whatsoever
This was the funniest 7 days video I've seen. Doraleous you really out did yourself.
The most spectacular fail ever 😂👍🏻. Not only did they try to attract zombies with burning barrel that doesn’t increase the heat map, they also trusted Dora’s “plan”. Simon probably died in this horde night as much as in the rest of the series 😂. Now comes the hard part. Waiting 3 months for the A17 season 😂
Zombies were using hacks. Knew exactly where to dig and drop.
I'm going to miss this, This was my favourite series
I fucking piss my pants so hard I need a sponsorship from OxiClean. Funniest shit ever
COOTER
epic
Scrap outlasts 7 days? Really?  Y'all can do a random gen map if you need something new.
i really loved this whole series. great job all round!
I hope this isnt the end of the series. I play myself on xbox and everytime I watch you guy, I play mine at the same time on another tv beside my gaming screen. You guys are hilarious and I get into every episode yall do like an actual tv show. Hopefully this isnt the end......
epic fail
No wtf!!! This was my favorite series
2:25 i could kill em. \n\nHaha love it when dora does that
Why did he assault the thermostat like that?
This better not be the last ep because I will be so so so very hurt
I hope you guys WILL continue this series once the alpha 17 or beta or whatever, it will have new content for you guys to make out with it.
Hey remember in The Matrix 3 when all the machines were coming in through the ceiling at Xion? Yeah this was nothing like that.
This is the best
Hell of a finale.
fantastic series. i thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to every friday nights adventure. thx guys
Haven't laughed this hard in quite sometime guys, really lifted my spirits today and I think I peed a little yeesh
Don't  Be cunts
Thanks for always entertaining us. Just a quick question. Did y'all know that there is a character in the new assassins creed game named testicles (or however you spell it) like from Doraleus and associates? I was just curious if it was a shout out to y'all in the game. Thanks again for all that you do.
perfect base with the perfect back door what a piece of shit hahahahaha love u Dora!
So is the next season is when you guys start playing Alpha 17 comes out?
Holy shit, that was amazingly ridiculous! Please don’t take too long of a break, always need Neebs Gaming’s 7Days to die. Return for Alpha 17?
oh man it seems like we just started
Dorealous is the type of guy who 3 problems and then only overly solve 1 leading to his fate
I've been following the series since it began last year! Man, while I'll certainly miss the series, I have to say this was the best way the series could end! Just a real Murphy's Law of a night. I hope one day y'all return to the game!
hopefully we can get more ark going, yall still need to beat island boss
Its like a time when you beat a very good camping to a game then it starts rolling through the credits and a good song starts to play
Nooooooo no more 7 days 😔😔
it's what happens when you half ass a construction
This must have been a nightmare to edit. Best 7d2d ever, great job guys! appsro for PONG!
best episode ever guys:) Doraleous should have had the who ceiling covered in blocks that is why it failed lol
What's that song called
Can't wait for season 2 with Alpha 17 and Random World Gen.
Simon Score 0\nDora               2\nNeebs            2\nApp                8\nThick             10\n\nNeebsGaming  100\nKeep up the good work!\n\nI admit though i thought this was going to work great.  Sucks put so much time and effort into and it didnt go right still was fun to watch.
I never really liked this series but now that it’s done I think I might miss it.
Why why whyyyyyyy nooo 7 days it was the best part of my video week😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Bring back raft
What a hell of a year! Thank you guys so much for this amazing series. I love how much passion and character you guys put into your shows, and for me, 7dtd has been one of the best (if not the best) shows that you guys have ever produced. Thank you gentlemen for the memories, and the fun for my Friday evenings!
Thanks for this!
Adahop, this was your masterpiece. Gentlemen this series has been a joy since day one. I will miss it.
This was great 😂. I’m Hoping the next new series will be red dead 2 online. Or Minecraft I miss those days.
That was great!
This videos is just a montage of all you dying 😂
horde night was an inside job
Neebs and team totally got Doraleoused. This is where he comes up with a incredibly elaborate half baked idea that ultimately fails horribly. Just like in his scrap mechanic vids. Seriously best episode though guys. My girlfriend and I couldn't stop laughing.
You tube is currently sucking the joy out of my already sad soul. Had a huge smile 15 seconds in...then that buffering swirling Bitch pops up and I want to pull my pubes out with my teeth? Can I get my one smile in for the day thanks YT.
I won't suck up to you and beg for a second season. We need a break, and all good things need to come to an end. But if you cancel it... you're dead to me.
Sooooo... what's worse? Blindly charging into things a fucking everyone over (Thicked) or preparing for something but leaving a Death Star style flaw in your design (Doraleous'd/Dored)???
Simon you're like the 1 single herpe in the group. You've got a good looking group of players doing well and then the herpe gets spotted by a potential suitor and embarrasses everyone involved. Excellent video guys! Including the herpe. 👍😂🤣😂🤣😂
Lesson learned. Never trust Dora to design anything.
I wonder what theyll be doing next. Such a good series.
I haven't laughed this much in a long time.. thank you guys.
I had such high hopes for this episode but...... DORA FUCKED IT UP!!!!!  GOD DAMNIT.  I love you guys thanks for the videos,  fuck off dora.
Woah... my dudes, I already commented but I just had to come back and watch this episode again. Holy shit what a finale, by the time Neebs was fist punching that cheerleader at the end.. I just can't even believe it, that was a straight up masterpiece. I really hope you guys come back to 7 days after the update and when you find time again. That was a golden episode, and a fantastic series. Neebs Gaming 4 Life !
The Wife and I have not laughed so hard at your stuff in a long time. We saw this happening as soon as the reveal and its the best way to end the series.
This has been, by far, my favorite series. I hope Season Finale doesn't become Series Finale. \n\nJust think...  What will this game be like once they finally get to full release version. :)
My wife just gave birth to our second son two days ago. We both just came home from the hospital around midnight tonight on very little sleep. Obviously  she needed rest more so I volunteered to watch him while she slept first.  Currently holding him in my arm while writing this. Shhhh, he's sleeping.\n\nThanks Neebs Gaming for being with me in this memory and helping me stay awake.
A beautiful end.
Helluva finale.  Gonna miss this series.  Empyrion, maybe?
Worst vacation evar
No more 7d2d???? Noooooooo life itself is cancelled!
This was the best 7 days to die episode ever, it made me laugh so much.love this series  I’m going to miss it . keep creating great videos
Loved it... Great job\nSoundtrack plz.\\m/
I love you guys but how in the hell did you get this far in the game and still need to search for med packs. I guess it's why we all love you so much.
The journey has come to the enemy
Complete blood bath. I think doralios maybe should of dug deeper? I heared of someone playing this game that built nice base, then one hored night the zombies collapsed the whole base from underneath.
I cant believe thats it😞😞
We're gonna die here\nIn Doraleous' death hole\nAll hell lets loose as the ceiling falls in on them along with piles of zombies.\nDoraeous giggling in the corner like a LIL BITCH.\nFUCK YOU DORALEOUS\n\nMeanwhile Simon dying (more than the others) to the sound of music as the FPS hits apocalypse levels.\n\nA truly spectacular end to a great series. Love y'all. Was the tampering Ada's doing?
Awesome series!!!!!!
What’s the next series
ALL OF UR STUFF IS ENDING WTFF , FIRST THE OTHER ARK MAPS, SUBNITICA WHYY
Oh, Doraleous... keep being you, man.. even if it means spending too many hours building what inevitably would become a death trap. A massive, massive death trap. What a great episode haha.
\"I bet you there's paper in him\"; Simon, 2018, 7 Days to Die: Journeys End
I'll never forget that Appsro uses his clipped finger nails for toothpicks.
Wait season or series
wow. the edits the song choice. best episode yet. ps pretty sure you guys would have been fine except Simon was taking away the defenses lol
You built our tomb lol
What an ending, and what a series. Can’t wait to see you guys return to this someday. Great series!! Excited for what the future holds!
They will probably come back when alpha 17 is out
Don’t think I’ve ever laughed as much as I have in this series.  Maybe Neebsylvania, I’ve watched that one at least 10 times thru, laugh every time Simon falls in a hole still.
Doraleous.... Omg.... Dude!!! That fucking bunker man, I had such high hopes that it was going to be the BEST HORDE BUILD EVER IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR HISTORY OF PLAYING THIS GAME. EVER. I'm sorry it fell apart so quickly, but omg what a hell of an ending. Love you guys and will miss this series so much
A great end to a great series. Now that you’re done with 7 Days to Die will you be putting AdaHop away in storage?
Fantastic show guys!
You know what this means guys... SUBNAUTICA IS COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow just got to say the whole episode was amazing from open song to the tears of laughter. Derelious ur bunker was a horrified failure but your vision was in lack of stability. Neebs crew do any of you have xbox? GT Shadowflyer11 I got a bunker even needs would love with 300 farm plots.
best... cluster..... fuck.... ever! 10/10 even with a plan you somehow fail and make one of the best videos ever. i laughed so hard at the dead screams i scared my cats haha good job guys
If it hasn't been discussed already I would like to bring up the idea of Red Dead Redemption 2 Rage Deputy.
Doraleus surely did do a good job and I know it’s scripted...u guys “if serious” wouldn’t of built below the holes in the ground but none the less I loved this and I want more 7 days
The editing was on fleek.
I love the #breadstrong song at the end....
Hands down. Nothing else but all I can say right now is I freakin loved it.
So whats next? Im excited
This makes me so sad.
Please don’t let this be the end!!!
So... Doraleous for president?
rip to the best youtube show ever
You guys should play this again but use mods
Awesome you broke 1mill on my birthday!!!!!
As usual, another amazing Neebs Gaming series, keep doing what you're doing because it's great!
love this series guy please bring it back around after awhile
Best vid ever!! Omg almost pisted my self.
Haha...just.. hahaha...this was great! 😂😂
This is officially your best Fubar compilation
I knew they wouldn't path right so i wondered how you guys were going to twist it
Damn this was awesome.  and that bunker looked sick, doralious is some kind of mastermind... evil or not (this is still a deathtrap). looking forward to whatever your doing next!
Y’all never fail to make me laugh.
That was epic, awesome video!
I died laughing the whole time!  Hope you guys come back to it or do an equally as awesome series in it's place.
i totally hope you guys revisit 7 days to die after the patch 17 comes out
Hey neebsgaming I luv all you guys your are my favorite you tubers been watching sins battlefield friends seson 1 you guys are amazing and the best youtubers you guys should have like 100 million subscribers.....

Can we just hold one candle light vigil and call Simon good :D
The end of 7 days to die for neebsgaming for a while 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
wow . really .
Best hord night ever. Ty for making these amazing videos. Greatest channel in all of youtube.
What are you going to post on Fridays now. I always look forward to a 7 days episode on Fridays.
I just hear dora laughing his ass off and having the time of his life. Price less
Bottom line, epic season finale! Thank you guys!
Man that was such a good episode.
I loved this series so much it became my favorite, other than ark. It only seems like yesterday you guys started it, But everything has a end and, I can't wait for whatever new game you guys are planning for a series next. NEEBS GAMING IS #1 \nohhh yeaaa, I noticed the channel is getting pretty close to 2million subs. We are still coming for you Pumkinpie!
Simon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died\nSimon Died
simon's deaths always brings me joy lmao!! best episode yet!!!
What does this meeeeaaann!? I'm scared!!
By far the most successful ford night
Conan? On Fridays? Plz? Btw loved every episode such a fantastic series
Sitting at work on my break in my truck  And  Laughing my butt off as people walk by and wondering what the hell as I scream no Simon    Easily the best 7 days to die video I have ever seen
Oh nelly. When will you learn that earth can be torn through easier than metal.
this was so bad in the best way! love it!!
Lol i love the zombie kill count. Neebs and dora are neck and neck. Appsro does his thing and plays out safe when he can. Simon is,well, he's Simon. Hes not about skill, but a nessessary addition. Without Simon, neebs gaming wouldn't be the same.\nAs for thick, he's the go too man. Wtg.\nOne question, who's seepyg?
This was the best
A beautiful disaster. Cheers for a good series. It was nice to see both human and zombie come together in the end and live without borders, in the most difficult environment one could imagine, sharing the same devices of death and pools of gore, in complete chaos and disharmony, like Europe. Just Kidding, or am I? I hope to see someday once more, man and zombie share a mortal dance in a dungeon of death, that only the mind of an isolated Dora could craft. Cheers.
Pls play dyinglight pls like if you agree
Any excuse to use the 1812 Overture is great, and this was a grand display.  Can't wait for you guys to return to it.\n\nI suppose this could be a Commenting on Comments question: Do you guys plan on replacing 7 Days to Die with something else for Fridays?  I know you've mentioned Conan Exiles a few times and its definitely something I'd like to see you give a proper go.
So sad this series is ending! I loved every episode! Hope you come back to it eventually, as it was such a great laugh! Keep on keeping on guys!
Adahop, thank you for all your awesome work on this series! Hope you and the crew are back at it very soon.
If I know anything from these guys... Their ideas NEVER work the way they want. Who else saw that coming from a mile away?
Ending just in time to do a red dead redemption 2 series. Smart move boys. Lots can be done there. Really looking forward to you guys getting your hands on that. Rage sheriff maybe? Loved it guys. You kept this game alive long after I got bored waiting for A17 on console. Can't wait to see what's next. Thanks guys
Go get the drop simon..see you in hell.
MORE 7 DAYS!!!!!!
Great video adahop!!! And Thick’s song at the end was so good!!!
Addy. I must commend you. You have brought a fresh perspective to Neebsgaming that they were looking for. Look at what you did with Subnautica when it returned. Look at CSN. Where would that channel be w/o you? You are the no-neck face that brought this channel to 1.7+mill. Great job. Love your face and btw Scrap has been renewed with you at the helm.
Thick must have chosen the music, reminda me of avengers sevenfold. Good stuff! Ps. Neebs you said you would do an aberration series
Awesome video, and I'll definitely miss this series ;-;
Just like in Dwarf Fortress, \"Losing is Fun!\"
Adahop, that was some diabolical shenanigans. Doraleous, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Simon, watch out for the mines.
Thanks so much for this season.  Please times 5000 do alpha 17.
My grandma walks in the room and asks where’s all that noise is coming from I just told her I was watching porn because it was easier then to acutely explain what the fuck I was watching at the middle of the night 😂
About to watch this for the second time today. Once was not enough to take it all in. Is this the last ever episode of 7 Days To Die or are yous just taking a break for a bit?(Edit: I watched to the very end this time, I found the answer to my question) Peace and prosperity guys
ok that was great, not surprise it didn't work. there is not something right about someone that talks to themselves with a gun pointed at there friends .... lol
Man, this is like a Kenny death of constant proportions. I needed a good laugh after the week I had lol.
C'mon man, if you're going to stop one of the best series you have, get all the videos to show up in the playlists. There's a bunch missing.
Hahahahahahaha poor simon
great episode as always, but in particular this intro ... loved it, good job guys :)
I never comment but i have to say that song at the end absolutely rules. And simon you just suck man... sorry
Simons score shouldn’t be a 1 it should be a 10 just like Dora and the rest of you guys , thank you so very much for making a fantastic episode and making me look stupid in front of my already disappointed father as I screamed in laughter and yelled at my phone  is so awesome
Well I guess it's back to watching Megazord.
I have never spent 24 minutes giggle snorting at a video until today. What an amazing setup and  even if it was a failure it still was fantastic to watch
Do the prison and make simon do all the fortifications it does not take much its almost all concrete
Haha death Trapped because of that hole 😂
Much preparation..much death.
Too fucking good. Lol!
I shouldn’t have watched this while eating dinner. I think I inhaled a metric ton of rice as I gasped for air while laughing hysterically. Worth it. Thank you for a great series!
I laughed so hard I think I peed a little
what a beautifully edited shit show
21:37 fucking killed me 😂😂
I loved this series
No please play more
sees the rumble that was shown falling \"My god...  they evolved...\"
Duck duck goose
So long 7 Days, twas funny while it lasted 👏👏
Love you guys so much! Can't wait to see the next series!
Once again Simon is a douche
Guys, I don’t know how to explain how much your videos mean to me and my mental health. You guys can cheer me up no matter what mood I’m in and it’s something really special. Please for the love of god don’t finish this series, we all love it, clearly! I’ve never met you but you feel like good friends, that’s mental when you think about it. I may of had a few beverages, but I mean every word.
Let’s see what Simon can do
That was great. Bravo neebs cast bravo
i knew dora's base design was gonna fail........but damn..........this exceeded my expectations in so many ways. best episode yet.....cant wait for alpha 17
That was epic, great producing as well
It the end of the season at journeys end
Sweet chocolatey Jesus that was the most glorious failure I have ever witnessed! Friggin LOVE THIS CHANNEL! KEEP IT UP GUYS!
Gods this was glorious.  I've loved the whole series, but this was epic.  You guys are awesome, Congrats on the button there.  Me and my guys love your vids and look forward to more. (of any game not just 7dtd).  <3
Shall now be referred to as The Great Collapse
What does August 19th represent?
Play more beamng drive
Why did you end it here at least let Simon host a hord night guys
Holy fuckin shit. I laughed my ass off Simon I love your balls to the wall approach to everything especially when it gets you killed, Dolorion hell fuckin yeah what a build in what will now forever be known as the glory hole
Fucking awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've been looking forward to this!!! I am only :49 into the viedo. Y'all take care it's time to watch.
I am going to Miss this series and one thing you guy forgot to put a way your Spider-Man game because in August spider Man didn't came out till September
Non stop ACTION! ! ! Awe man! !...😂😂😂 Great job guys....really enjoyed this series 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Well that backfired.
I have loved this series since you started making it and have been watching every episode the day it comes out. Thank you so much for the entertainment. If you ever get back to creating 7 days again try the pitfall trap build.
Masterpiece
I'm definitely gonna miss this series but hopefully you guys will bring it back later. That was the best one, great work you guys
Guys that was the best video of neebs gaming ever .😂😂😂😂😂
Congrats guys, well done on another great episode and an amazing series! Is the the end, or will you go to a new map now?
Best worst episode ever, or is to the worst best ever. Whatever fucking hilarious!
This was the greatest use of the War of 1812 Overture I've ever witnessed
Why does it have to end!!!!??!
so will the series continue?
Next challenge  build base on top of metal bridge #thickchallenge
All the props I gave Dora last episode, ya I've got to take it all back. How did you not fill those holes in. A bit disappointed in that, all that planning gone to waste
I see you guys are signed up for the 7 days to die A17 stream event, you gonna be streaming that? playing on 17????
A wonderful end to a wonderful series hope it comes back
Really hope that there more of this in the future. You guys crack me up!
What's next gents.? Hope its something as fun as 7Dd was world peace! An much love! From trigrhap gaming!
as as suggestion if you ever do another horde night, dig a continuous long tunnel lined with torches deep inside of a mountain lined with all kinds of obstacles for the horde to try and reach you.
Awesome work guys what's your plans from here?
This was awesome, wish you could do another horde with Simon doing the defenses. At the bottom of the map kind of to the left is a prison that would be perfect for him to build up. Thank you guys for making many laughs for me and your fans. Since I started watching your videos, my days have been more happier to say the least. I have also been going back to watch all of your videos from the past. Thanks again for making my days better!!!
Would love to see entire series death count for everyone if available.
What a glorious end for a glorious series
Hahah! 19:10 thick’s shock was so sincere😂
Hope season 2 of neebsyvania is coming
I predicted this would happen. I thought about saying something but decided it would be funnier if I didnt. I was not disappointed.
Best horde night ever...
Don't let this be the end. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Truly an epic ending, no other channel can claim to produce as high quality gaming videos as you all kisses all round
End of an amazing Adventure
You guys should try MODDED 7DTD.
It's over, so what will replace it? Honestly though this is better than any TV series and film. This has been the best thing, and each episode and brought me so much joy, thank you Neebs crew xox
That’s the best ending anyone could have done for this series.  SOOOO FUNNY
Pew - pew pew  LMAO 😂 😂😂
always wanted to watch a neebs gaming SAW movie 🤔
Welp, that went pretty much exactly the way I expected it to. I think you guys said it best, it was a fantastic, fantastic failure.
Whats going to replace this series then my dudes???
That was just fantastically entertaining.
Simon's death noises are always the best part of the show.
Dora, thank you. I needed that good of a laugh after this week.
Great way to end a series. Although I know you will probably return in 2020(I know you guys I have watched every series ,I know how lazy you are).
VRV, enough said.
That intro music is so Nightmare Before Christmas -ish
I can't imagine how frustrating that night must have been to get through but damn was it funny to watch. I have so many tears from laughing so hard. 👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was the most hilarious and epically  disastrous horde night I've ever seen. Thank you guys for such a great series. Spot on editing in this one Adahop.  I'm sad to see this end, but hopefully after A17 goes stable you guys will do a season 2 for 7DTD. Loved it and thanks guys.
This is basically my rust experience so far
Is this the last episode ever?
That was fucking epic...
that credit music is actually kinda good
so will you guys be back in alpha 17?
Fantastic episode!
FFS Doraleous I wanted to believe in you soooo bad. But if it has to end like this at least it ended in a BIG WAY.
You guys are awesome. I loved the game only from watching you play it. I really wish that I get to meet you guys just to tell you how funny you are. 👍
I'm so sad. Why did it end? Next base, simon is in charge? Each person has their own \"death trap\" at least. Like each person has their own location for a horde
I'm seriously gonna miss this series
Best episode ever! Spectacular disaster indeed.
\"Downfall\" haha
i laughed so hard i started choking
Is this the end? Either way this is my favourite series on the neebs gaming channel.
wow ada has a special A key and wow what build up to a hopeful horde night to 1 big disappointment
I dont even know how you guys do it. you take something and make it a million times more badass. Always hilarious film gold.
When I saw the thumbnail it said \"season finale\" and I thought instead that it said \"series finale\"and I almost died inside thinking this was the end.
Soooo, why exactly did anyone think this was going to work? DORALEOUS BUILT IT!
Holy fuck,I love you guys so much. I can’t wait for a possible next season and I can’t describe how much I loved this one. Too sad to have it come to an end. But what an ending it was.
this is gold, pure gold i love it especially the montage of deaths, then neebs when he says \"im in a fist fight with a cheerleader\" cracked me up
I can't like this video enough. OMG guys well done that was hilarious AND epic!!!  The playing of the 1812 Overture was genius, i laughed my ass off.  Bravo!
I have loved the series so much I just hope you go back to it or maybe start fallout 76
Nice ending, sad day... This is my favorite next to Ark.
Glad this series ended on such a high note.  Would like to see an occasional revisit just for a big horde night defense if someone had a creative base idea, even if it was built in creative mode to start and everyone was given some gear and levels.   These horde nights were what I looked forward to the most in this series.  The chaos and excitement really brought out your dynamics like back in the neebsylvania days.   Will miss it, but looking forward to whats next
We shall salute this great ep
Alpha 17 let's go!
It’s sad to see the series end
Holy shit. What a cluster fuck that was. Loved every minute of it.
Just want to say. Great job Doralius
I hope you guys have some great stuff planned!... I loved the weekend line up and now this!. I trust you guys (1st ever sub was to you guys). And more pod casts as I drive alot at work and you guys make a hour feel like 2. Thanks. ARE YOU A MAN
Absolutely, hands down the best series of deaths I have ever seen, and I am glad I got to see it on the one and only NEEBS GANING!!!!
Wait is this the end of the 7 days serious
Ya'll better be back for version 17 of the game! :)
At least it ended the way it should have. With you all getting what you deserve.
Best ending ever, even though Adahop uped it all, and you guys died time and time again. And in my own personal opinion, I think Neeb's lighthouse and Dora's original bunker would have faired better. Can't wait for Appsro with RDR2, I know he can't either. Love you guys, and kisses for everyone 😘
this video made my night lol  best part is watching Doraleous  watch and laugh ... man i am 32 yrs old and i love watching your video  hands down i  really hope for a season 2 of 7 days to die ... random gen map ... ?
Thank you for bringing us this series, it was so entertaining, I can’t wait to see what you’ll be working on next and start a new series with you guys
Holy crap, I lost it when they started falling in! The I instantly thought to myself about Simon dying a lot. Lmao he never fails to deliver! Hate to see the series go though it’s one of my favorite, but with the big update coming it’s a wise decision. Play some Conan Exiles dam it !!
What a way to go out, not in a bang or an explosion but with several bangs leading to a boom that collapses the whole ceiling. Well done!!
Anybody else recognize the music from the scorched earth boss battle?
I love this series. You have gone from being noob's scared out of your wits in the police station, to building your own houses, and it all ends like this. I've gotta say this whole thing has taken many turns. Some for the worst... Looking at you Doraleous... Fantastic, all of you get a cookie in my book
ROFL this episode was one of the best, if not the best one.
Looking forward to Red Dead hijinks now this is over for now.
I will never tire of the \"Simon death noise\"  I smile every time he makes that sound  and it happens a lot so I'm pretty happy
I’m going to miss this series it was one of my favorite but now apsro can do subNautica sub zero
I love 7 Days to Die and I love the videos you guys make I hope one day when Alpha 17 comes out that you guys will return to this series refreshed and eager for new challenges but it's been a fun ride and I've enjoyed every episode and I just want to thank each and everyone of you!
Now MINECRAFT AGAIN! :D :D
Simply.Fucking.Amazing. \nWell done Ada! \n\nOh and thanks for showing us how do use your maps. Been trying to figure that out since the Valley House.
This is the greatest 7 days to die video. Ever. \n\nBest horde night. Ever. \n\nThank you Dora for providing me with hours of entertainment today while I’m nursing a major hangover from the night before. \n\nYou guys are amazing. \n\n#worldpeace #doraforpresident
Ps love your cute butts all equally
Another fan-f**king-tastic 7 days video. Love how you guys just gave Neebs a silent stare over his comment \"Apprso's bringing the heat. Would you guys ever get your  partners in as guests to narrate over a ark video like it was a wildlife doco?
This episode has made me laugh harder than I ever have in a very long time!
so sad to see it end it was an amazing series
The fact that the APSSRO crew is exactly like me and my friends scares me and I said apssro crew to see if it would piss off neebs
Nooooooo. Is this the final of the season or the series?
I’ve watched this series from the start and loved every minute of it! Sad to see it go but looking forward to more adventures!!!
This was fucking epic
Gotta love Simon... at least he's persistent... LOL  GOTTA GET MY STUFF!!!
So.... what's next?
That was without a doubt the best episode of 7 days yet!
“Simon, I just saved you.” “Why?” LOL
This was the best thing I have ever watched
BEST SERIES ENDING EVER!!!
Por favor regresar a esta serie! Please return to this series!
Gloriously FUBAR... XD
What a coup de grace! I'm sad to see the series ending (for now), but this was a special one. lol Will we see another poll for the next series?
IMO better than The Walking Dead. Thnx Guys!
Why are you guys ending the series?
The best ending ever made 😂❤
A blooper: when Dora blew the hole, it sent all the barrels up in the sky, but next scene it's all on the ground like nothing happened.
I wanted this to work for you guys! I wanted yall to kick ass for 24 min and walk out like badasses! Instead I got the most entertaining and funniest YouTube video I have seen in a very long time. I enjoyed this immensely! You guys are good at what you do, and most importantly good peoples. P.S. remember this quote. “The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.” - Phil Jackson
Probably the best and funniest episode by far! I had a shitty day at work so I decided to order chinese food, drink some beer and watch Neebs Gaming :D I love you guys, pretty sure I want Neebs to carry my baby.
if this series is ending which game are yall moving to next?  not sure how many people might had suggested this but yall might get a kick out of \"Dark and light\", similar to ARK but more magical instead of tech.
Hey can we just have like 1 more episode of a set up for hoard night made by Simon. I would love to see that mess lol
Love the 7days to die Videos. Definitely I loved this one. Great job to all at Neebs Gaming. Thanks so much. 😂 I just want to say I loved the first part of the video.
Oh dorabolus...
This is probably the worst horde night ever. (thanks doraleous) 🤨
1812 overture, nice choice
Y is it ending, now I don't have something to watch on Friday
Is it just me or does most here agree that Doraleous makes the worst decisions out of the entire group
hahaha my stomach hurts to laugh so much hahaha how much death and destruction I love, Greetings from URUGUAY
Omg, fuckin brilliant, I loved this XD
That was the most beautiful failure I have ever witnessed. Doraleous, you have outdone yourself, sir!
You guys need to play medieval engineers for your next game
wait is this the end of 7d i really hope its not it is my 3rd fav series you guys made
Awsome intro!
First episode both me and my wife  have ever yelled at the tv , \"Simon dont run that way, theres mines!\" Could not stop laughing, best editing of deaths and added features yet. Thick gave me an epiphany of how I wish to die, surrounded by zombies with a rocket launcher. Great jobs guys.
First Raft is over and now this?!?\n\nBut seriously this is a series that I look forward to every week and I'm sad that it will be gone, I really hope you replace it with something that you guys enjoy making. All that matters is we get to watch something that you all love doing and hopefully have a lot of fun with. I think the most enjoyable part is seeing the interactions of group of people that have learned to work well together at times, and other times beautifully fall apart.
Nice office guys👍
So is this the last 7 days video?
Will there be a new season or is this the final 7dtd
what a great way to end things. Looking forward to more one day and to see what else you guys do.
I'm going to miss this SO much!
Sad ti see 7 days go, everything you guys do is great but this series was especially great. Thank you for all the laughs and scares in 7 days guys
exceptional episode, however, 2 things tho: no escape plan and understanding the zombies programming, if he had those it would have been... a shit house and boring episode lol. he would have been better to build an island and filled a mote with spikes and propeller blades with turrets as support, or dug a super deep hole with concrete floors and turrets surrounding the floor whilst you all  just sit around the bottom shooting survivors of the falls lol.
Why trust him? He’s the worst at planning anything. Just look at the terrible mountain idea he had. Idk who’s worse, him for his shitty plans or you guys for following them.
Last episode: Doraleous for president. \n\nThis episode: Crucify the sumbitch.
When I realized this was the season finale, I went through the 5 stages of grief :(. This was my fav series apart from subnautica.
Next series should be space engineers i think it would be funny watching simon float out into space and the gang mounting a rescue mission to save him
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.
So is Red dead 2 taking the 7 Days To Die Friday
does that gold subscribe button work?  the red one on my screen keeps failing me
WoW, Just Wow
Rip 7days to die 😯
bloody simon died like 7 times and made me laugh so my mum said can i see this and then she laugh
Never laughed so much before. My husband an I love you guys. Always can't wait for new videos up, no matter what it is. Loved this series. Can't wait for what else you guys put up :)
Gentlemen this was your very best recreation of the battle of the crater. Well done.
the safest of safe lol
I will miss this series😢. Y'all always deliver. I can't wait to see your next co-op series!
By far the best episode ever 😂😂
thanks so much fir this  season guys loved it been playing 7 days to die from start but had to move to modded 7 days as  it got old fast  maybe next time you take this up you would try a mooded one war of the walkers would be a fun one for the neebs gang
OHHHHHH The Humanity!!!
Oh Simon, dying with lots of things. That's pretty much everyone's goal. Also I think you should of went to 32 for that blood moon zombie count, especially since every horde night the zombie count naturally multiplies by how many days passed.
Doraleous I fucking love you
Was that adahop or doralous that changed the settings in the beginning? I think they would have been in a bit better of a situation if they had made moltoves or explosive crossbow bolts. Fire. What they needed was distruction
Play trail makers
That... WAS THE BEST VIDEO IN EXISTENCE!
This was better than Thick’s hoard night. \n\n\n\n\nAnd then it wasn’t.
Sa sa sa sa sa sa, sa sa sa sa sa sa, SA SA SA SA SA SA SANDWICH SHOW!??!
Lmao this was brilliant! I had so much hope for that bunker! what a disaster!
Fricking hilarious
Absolutely great ending....thank you guys for all the joy and laughs
you guys had me Rollin in my own tears with this one👍👍👌
Doraleous was so sure his base would work that when it failed all he could do was laugh
I watch all of your videos, but this... this may have been an absolute masterpiece with all of the editing you guys put into it. When we saw the last video some of us knew you guys would face some issues with the design and the zombies AI, but the way you guys handled being killed so many times with 1812 death montage and the addition of ending the video with that song? This has to be my all time favorite video you guys have put out! Thank you so much for your hard work, your creativity, and all the laughs. Assuming this is the end, that was the perfect send off to a game I love to play and loved watching you guys play.\nMuch love!\nA long time fan\nP.S dang that 7 days song is so awesome, can you guys drop the sound clip somewhere for viewers like us?
If you'd only made short characters... Moria got nothing on this place as a tomb!
That is series done?! Boo.
So sad that i wont be watching this serie again every week ,every friday i was waiting for this video. But im not too worrie i know you guys will come up with something as good if not even better
Fucking standing ovation. Amazing.
After a long week of work i look forward to 7 days to die Friday's crazy ark Saturdays and laid back GTA Sunday's love the channel keep up the good work
Oh I have never laughed so hard at one of your videos. Bravo gentlemen to a most excellent series!
This was an awesome series I love every video on the series so what comes next?
Dorealaese  u fuccing idiot u were spouse to be the smart one who would have guessed that they'd dig  ten feet down
Season finale ??!!!!😐
I'm speechless!!! That was the most amazing carnival of death I've ever witnessed!! Hazaa!!!
A M A Z I N G
Could have made an actual zombie blender with those blades, bullet proof glass and the hole.
Simon for Neebs gaming president. No one else has the stones to rush into certain death 18 times. \nAppsro is a vandal\nDora secretly plots everyone’s death \nThick well. Just remember cooter\nAnd Neebs he’s to busy planning global peace to be el presidents
Top notch series guys. Gonna miss the series, it was what got me to play 7 days
That was a freaking fantastic end to an exceptional series! Ada, magnificent editing as always, you outdid yourself sir! It is truly sad to see this series end, but am looking forward to seeing what's next. Kisses!!!
So what's next guys?? Love the series hope to see it again
Dora's plan all along and ya'll fell for it. ITS A TRAP!!!
Play together when the game updates. And the series will Never Die.
Season finale!  Does this mean your making room for a new game, RDR2 perhaps!
Doraleous....I have no words.
Best video ever!
Thanks for all the stupidity and clumsiness. You guys rock.
Note to self: Dont build bunkers in games where enemys can dig.
Doraleous is called duckduckgoose now?
I love how much you guys suck at games. It always makes me laugh and puts a smile on my face. Thanks for all the hours of fantastic entertainment.
Good job Doralingus.\nHow do you actually lose at this game if you can just keep respawning?
Any hints on the new Friday night series??
Wow Doraleous I can’t believe I thought that this would work. Needless to say that was an amazing horde, filled with plenty of laughs and failures. Great job Doraleous your ability to protect your friends is amazing as always.
Awesome, we need a new series all these dam survival games was getting to be to much.
All that work, and forgetting to fill a hole screwed ya.. Lol
Lmao \"how am I not dead?\", \"don't know but I get a front row gughhhbhh! Haha.
That was so funny love you guys
I love at 12:17 when Neebs thinks he's a Laser pistol! pew pew pew
I hope you guys do more!!!
Nicely done everybody! Enjoyed the series.
I FUCKING KNEW.. the place is called journeys end... AND ITS THE FINAL PLACE.. I called it...
I do love this series and I hope the continue to make more
The difficulty nor the amount of zombies made a difference! It's the slight overlooking of that damn hole Dora! 😡
A+++ editing
Adahop messing with the thermostat over there you evil monster....
Just guys i'm literally dying from laughter
Now try Dead by Daylight!!
This is the equivalent of what almost happened the last horde night - what I wish had happened... \n\nThe horde digging from above... I WISH they had successfully dug completely underneath the Hibachi Buffet base so we could see the worst case scenario!\n\nSorry, but makes for a hilariously good video... case in point.
i guess the JOURNEY'S  must END for this series
Duckduckgoose is my favorite character.
Simon going from standing in barbed wire to just jumping on a land mine is classic Simon. His spacial awareness and lack of control over his movements is the equivalent to a newborn baby Giraffe. Great series fellers, keep doin what you're doin! Kisses!
Sad that all good things come to an end.\nI have really loved watching this series, every Friday evening, after dinner and putting kids to bed, I grab a whiskey and enjoy this.\nGoing to miss this a lot, but man, I have enjoyed this so very much.\nSimon's house collapsing was great fun, but this massive failure tops it all, great way to end it! <3\n\nBig thanks to the whole crew, amazing edits, great fun gameplay!
How convenient. You saved the horde the time and effort of digging graves for you all. LOL
Ok so I'm really sad that the series is ending but that was the best season finale ever!!! XD
That’s was amazing!! Funniest episode on the channel. I really hope this isn’t the last we see of this game on here. Bravo guys:)
Loved it love yall
BEST EPISODE EVER! So sad this season is over. Can’t wait for more.\n\nEDIT: Doralingus’ score was way too generous. After all this build up it backfires and got you all slaughtered.
The only way this gets better is if a red dead 2 series is coming!!!
Guys good job on that transition in the beginning. It was flawless just seriously good job.
Well I do have to admit, things would have gone A LOT worse if Doraleous didn't make that whole thing. So I give him a 6/10 for this one.
aww man :)
Doraleous thicked everyone with a Simon level defense. This made a great video. As always. Toodles.
This video has to hold the world record number of times owned in 7 Days to Die in a single horde night
WOW, this was by far, my favorite episode of 7 days to die. the editing was superber and the music was on point. And My sides are in pain for all of the wonderful laughter, you guys have so graciously bestowed upon us all. thank you. Ps. I'm too lazy for grammar sorry.
Anyone who plays this game knew from the moment this place was shown that it was a death trap lol but an entertaining one . Great series guys Loved it all
Can't wait for commenting on comments to hear what the guys have to say. Dora, I had such high hopes because it was pretty awesome, but when I saw you ignored those other holes I thought... well that's the end of him being allowed to make defenses. Anyways... good job adahop the death montage had me in tears.
music at 0:35 pleas
You got dora’d
Dora blowing open the hole was the only thing to go right this episode
Doraleous: First horde night while I hold my beer....
Whoever said “oh fuck” at 19:10 that was the best/funniest thing I’ve heard on this channel and thick died as a warrior by taking a whole lotta zombie with him
Funniest episode ever lol i love it. Death screams sound effects are funny lol
Was that Anthony's sausage fingers at the start?
This might be the best 7dtd video you guys have ever made.
Damm you guys it's going to be hard to top that series finale.
Finger my butt for a piece of candy
BEST. HORDE NIGHT. EVER!!  can't wait to see u guys explore/tame a randomgen map!
Best. Episode... Ever.
Appsro there is a new fallout its fallout 74 or 75 not sure
And sorry Thick, when you were at the top of that building site, I was also hoping something would happen lol, at least you didn't fall to your death like a bitch.  And Doraleous, an ex military guy should know, A cave, is a grave.
Great jobs every one u die lol rip Simon lik omg
Thick it's smarter on games
That was a great disaster of a finally. Probably funnier to watch than to live through.
Watched this series through three times at least, even just as background noise when I'm busy, cant wait to see whats next.  Any idea what game you guys are going on to or is that a secret until the reveal date? Love the D & A to cant wait to see what happens in the new bridge building venture.
God... my d*ck is hard
Needs is better than Doraleous and Simon
Though i am sad that this is the finale, it has been an excellent ride so far, and this episode has been my favourite (and probably the best) episode yet. thank you guys for all the laughs, the action and work that went into this series. I'm looking forward to what's coming next. 😄😄
Amazing.  Absolutely amazing.
10/10 on the editing!
😭😭
OMG Adahop! Way to close it out in a big way. Deserves an award
if you guys do another season, could i suggest a random generated map instead? would be more interesting to see you guys in an enviroment thats not pre-made and will keep alot of people who knows the navegaze map guessing aswell.
Spooky
They weren't just up shit creek without a paddle... Doraleous rowed them into the center of shit lake and threw away the paddles after knocking a couple of holes into the boat.
It is a little sad to think next week no 7 days to die video I have watched you guys since your first ark video and I love you guys my friend introduced me to you guys with bff and I fell in love with the humor and craziness thank you guys you always give me a reason to smile and laugh even when I am depressed.
This is seriously one of the funniest things I've seen my whole life.  I called my friend and was trying to tell him to watch it, but couldn't stop laughing long enough to get the words out.
Is that Thick singing in the end? \n\nAND 7 DAYS TO DIE IS DONE?!  NOOOOOO!  My fiance and I always watch this together like a TV show and it's her favorite series from you guys.  The description says it's a \"season finale\" but the ending message makes it sound like a \"series finale\".  Will this series just be on a hiatus and will eventually be back on a weekly basis or is it done permanently with only a few revisits now and again?
Holy shit, guys!  That was taking epic failure to a new level!!!  Just when I think you couldn't get anymore entertaining... going to miss the series, but all good things must come to an end, and I'm sure ya'll have something new coming down the pipe.  Viva la Neebs gaming!
I'm so glad dora thick'd this up. Probably the best episode in the series
my question is why did they not escape through the door they came in from??? lol Dora, i would have made the sme mistake.
The dog I loved for 10 years has recently passed and when nothing can stop me from crying some how you guys manage to cheer me up and make me smile.
This was the best season finale ever, the constant maniacal laughter from Dora and the death compilation near the end were fantastic. Keep up the amazing work and keep the videos coming.
Off that just hapend nice trap Dora :P\nI like that moment whene your like... Oh that may be a prob... looking at the 2 hole in the cilling and your like oh well what ever :P\nAny way it was really nice well done. (any way it was one of the 2 thing I tought it would hapend AKA... Crazy easy night whit great set up or the zombie go right for your head and fall on your bed...)
What a freaking episode, the music was great. I love the death cams mixed in with the overture. This was one of my favorite series to watch by you guys, I am sad that this is the end. I look forward to your great content and see what you are trying next. Keep up the good work guys.
WAIT WAHT THE SERIES IS OVER?!?! ;-; what will I do on fridays now? ;-;;-;-;-;-;-;-;-
You guys kicked ass!
I swear some people should fallow Simon around and make T-shirts out of every thing he say's. \"I Like to die with a lot of things\"
i just watched the intro right now and doralingus u build a grave.
BEST EPISODE EVER!
21:52 “I’m stuck on a bahb-woiah!” 😂😂
Please, please, PLEASE do another season for Alpha 17! So many new changes are coming that Simon can die in all new ways and Doraleous can create new epic failures! Thanks for a great series everyone!
whats the orchestral song that was used at the end
To be fair it may have worked if the difficulty weren't turned but who knows
this would be a good time to wait for A17 to release and pretend like that really was a journey's end. starting fresh in the new game, yall are gonna love the updates
Is this the final 7 days video? I hope not...
Lol good job Doraleous your now officially worse than Simon
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Ark and 7 days are my favourite things to watch period 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It be whole new learning curve for them and everyone else when ever the update comes out.
I want to know how many time each of u died
11:55 I love when neebs speaks gibberish😂😂
It's been a crazy adventure through Navezgane with you guys! Hopefully you come back once Alpha 17 releases because it looks to be an almost whole new game. Much love & keep doing what you guys do so well.
I legit grew up watching you guys, keep it up my dudes!!😄😁
BEST HORDE NIGHT EVER!!! Oh My God that was funny.  Excellent editing.  I was watching at work and had to stifle my laughter the whole time.
Well prepared! Hats off to you doral! Looked promising heheha haha
This is so sad 😭😭😭😭
My girlfriend and I just watched this and were laughing the whole time.  You need to make a shirt that says I survived Doraleous's Death Hole\n\nP.s. I hope your next game is Empyrion again unloved that game\n\nP.s.s. Simon is the best.
Oh My God They Killed Simon !
man I love that song !!! please tell me you are going to make a metal music video, out of this footage. that track during the horde was awesome. would love to hear it with the voices in the background and that track turned up.
Great series and love you guys to death
That battle music is awesome am glad am using it in the creation of my doom wad. I guess never make any defences underground.
Please can we have some more on  a new map
Oh doralious, you sure know how to engineer a beautefull disaster.
G.L.O.R.I.O.U.S.
best quality content <3
Been here since you guys were at 150k subs and I must say I think this was your best episode yet. I was laughing the entire time. Keep up the good work!
22:12 Dora: \"This place is haunted!\". Funny
Spectacular failure, Doraleous! Love it!
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader\" this statement made my actual arse laugh 🤣 but on a serious note Dora should be banned from planning horde nights
Hey guys I was wondering if you guys are going to end your ark series as well because I really don’t want you to. Your ark series is my favourite and I just don’t want to see it die.
I love it when a Neebs gaming plan falls to shit!
Nooooooo! We need more!
who was that guy at the beginning that was screwing with the settings? And how did nobody notice the weird spike in numbers and difficulty, where they to engrossed in the action?
Please at some point come back to this! You guys are the only reason i bought this game
It's like watching home alone again
\"These first aid kits should come in handy.\"
This went as wel as I expected lol
Extremely enjoyable episode!!!!
Omg omg so so fn good! I really hope it's not the end!
I’ll miss this series so much!!
While terribly sad to see 7 Days end, this was by far the best way it could of ended! Thank's to all those who lost their lives in Dora's Tomb and thank you Adahop for the marvelous editing of this masterpiece!
Bravo, One more thing from YouTube gone, but hey, you guys are still rocking Ark so keep it up!!!
19:10 when thick screamed “OH FUCK” I lost my shit😂
so close to having an amazing base, hoping you guys are returning in alpha 17
I love how Simon was the last one to die. Good job
Holy shit that was amazing
Lmfao that was hilarious to watch.
You have to come back for the A17 update! We need a sequel series!!   You don't need to use the same map, use a random generated map with the update and fight over who gets to drive the jeep! If there is no sequel series I'll just fling myself into a spinning blade trap that throws my body parts into dutch oven land mine and go out Simon style!!!
That was amazeballs
So is this the last episode of 7 days?
43 deaaths
I would love to see u guys play ark adorachn
Let this be a lesson learn never leave doralious in charge of ur live
Haha haha loved it !!!!!!!!!!’n
Great job guys on raising $11k last night caught the last 5ish minutes of it at least saw Buffett44
Hands down the funniest horde night
7DaystoDie on Xbox One and PS4 is getting cancelled...OH GOD
This episode is amazing.
DORALEOUS YOU FUCKING IDOIT
Great season had fun with the poetry Neebs
The mistake was leaving the holes... Dirt... You only needed dirt. Fill those holes with dirt and the zombies would never have made it down. They can only dig sideways, not down. They fell into the holes and dug forward towards you until the structure collapsed. Best fuck up ever. 10 out of 10 IGN
dude I remember when you guys announced that you were about to start playing this game can't believe you've already done so many episodes I'm heartbroken to see that it is over but look forward to the hopes of watching another 7 Days to Die reboot lol love y'all keep up the awesome work
Super opening!!!
Dang my suspicion about you guys making a base at Journey's End being the end of the series was right! I'll miss this series immensely, but all things must end. I can't wait to see what is coming up next for the channel!
What a great series, sorry to see it come to an end. But I can't wait to see what comes next!
Best series. Looked forward to every week. Will miss it tons. Damn Dora set you guys up for failure loool
Yoooooooooooooooo
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\nthis cant be the end i love this show,  you guys have made me laugh so much the past year. i will truly miss this series. thank  you
Oooohhh nooooo guys please please don't stop yet really really enjoyed this game watching you guys an Simon's pure 🍆 madness it like every week this is my main YouTube show really going to miss this guys👏👏 🤗☹🤪
Just got home and my brain screamed oh my God it horde tonight
I'm reading these comment like 'Damn, I can't be only one..' but it seems to be. \nI love you guys, but i really didn't enjoy this. I get that you can't control a mistake, if it indeed was.  After the tour Dora gave of the bunker I was really looking forward to seeing it action, seemed well though out, kind of a mad scientist vibe going on during construction. Now I never expected it to be perfect but maybe to fail partway, not immediately. A lot was lost here. \nGame idiot was awesome and think you did fantastic bringing that to life in Simon but it's feeling extremely forced at times and this episode had a lot of them. This was the first time it crossed from grinning laughter to frustration for me as a spectator, I wished he would just get mad and fuck off at about the second spinning blade death. \nDudes, you rock, I'll always be a sub, supporter and recommender of this channel, I'd just love to for things to go back to feeling less, for lack of a better terminology, scripted. Maybe its an editing and timing thing idk, I just feel the neebs gaming spice is getting weaker in some videos. \nOh, the tumbleweed after neebs' outburst, mmhmm just perfect, big lol right there. \nMuch love bros #nohomo
how do you download the file it says download but its not on my system anywhere I can find anyway
I’ve never seen so much death ever lol
My new favorite neebs quote.... “I’m in a fist fight with a cheerleader” 😂
Does this settle the bunker vs no bunker argument?
So is this really it, the end where everyone dies from dorleangus's death tomb hole
The best day ever!
The most I've seen you guy's die.
Please don't end this series ! I know it's just the end of the season ! You all should check out the mods for 7D2D !
RIP 7 days to die good luck old friend.
So this is really the ending I thank you Neebs crew you guys made my Friday nights
wait wait wait is this really the last episode?!
I remember watching the first episode and thinking this could be good
Dang it!!\nI saw the 1st episode and didn't like the game (I thought it was too slow) but I rejoined at thicks horde night\nNow it is stopping again, I just joined!!!!
Play conan exiles plz
Haha great season finale.
Just amazballs!!! Well done guys well done.
This sucks. So what's next?\nI will rewatch the playlist.
The moment I saw all the mines on the ground I knew Simon gonna die a bunch of times
Love Doraleous' score
So will there be another season of this or do you actually mean \"series finale\" ? Because people do that but never upload this again.
Now that's a season finale!
Best \"Death Hole\" ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great series guys. I always look forward to watching the content you guys create it’s hilarious and awesome to watch.
Lol😂
OH no no no sad sad sad tears I loved this series, binge watched it many times, don't end it :(  You guys are doing an amazing job! Please continue.  IF YOU ALL WANT THEM TO CONTINUE PLEASE GIVE LIKES.
Great build!
This series so so fucking good
Maybe dorlious was trying to get them killed?!!!!
cant beleive its over this show is how i found you guys but what are you gonna do for friday now
Truly excellent and thoroughly appropriate end to a really great series! Can't wait to see what u guys have next!\nPS Assuming it has a rock star editor mode like gta I'd love to see a red dead cinematic series when that's out!
Best thing everrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!💖💖 Kisses
0:11 Simon??
I really don't want this series to end. It is still my favorite series y'all have done and IMO the best thing since Neebsylvania. Please continue it. This was my favorite thing that my Patreon donation went towards. And now I'm severely depressed.
what a great early bday present!
Is this the end of the season
You guys are the only youtubers that can get me to watch and enjoy a video series on a game that I would hate to play. Thanks guys.
I loved 7days to die I watched every episode and will miss the session but will you do a new series soon
Abs of steel 😂😂
Wow. Very epic
Best episode
Perfection.
Perfection.
How old is Simon?
Doraleous is never gonna hear the end of this one
So many death mainly Simon
Adahop is an evil mastermind!
This better not be the last episode if it is I swear I will find you and make you make more episodes
U guys should have the community build u a base for a special episode were u take a day 700 horde in a base they built with a full load out to make it fair and fun
Please don't stop making 7 days videos, it's my Friday night theater
I feel the same way as if I would feel when come back from a good good holidays. Sad. Because it ended. It was a great run... What we will do on fridays now?? :(
Absolutely fantastic job guys!!! Loved this entire series more than I thought I would at the start. Looking forward to you guys revisiting it some time in the future. For now thiugh I'm intrigued to see what you have in store for next/or future Fridays! Kisses!!! 💚🖤💜
Does anyone agree that neebs can be a dick i when he says over there and doesent shot
Cant wait for season 2
336 hours! I'm so sorry Adahop, truly. Lol
This was the most beautiful pile of shit I’ve ever seen. It’s been a good series. I hope we’ll return to it some day #breadstrong
I love how at 7 mins in the subtitles Neebs style censor Neebs
\"I like to die with lots of shit\" Fuckin love you simon, no homo!
I found you guys because of my love of 7D2D. Now I love you all as much. Thanks for the series. And thanks for being awesome people. Hopefully alpha 17 makes you want to return.
When’s season 2
Lmao major death trap and major destruction 👍😂
Awesome series guys. Sad to see it go, yet excited to see what comes next!
Sooo many deaths lol love the video but dora you should have know better and the rest of you should have known better then to go underground knowing they can dig through anything im hoping you guys will come up with a more efficient way to survive the whored with a mile of defenses i mean spikes as far as the eye can see a tower surrounded with an escape route simon is the only one who should be constantly dying in these episodes thats his thing and falling into holes 😂😂
2:27 YES finally\nbeen waiting for the return of Doraleous' alter egos
So realistically how many times did you have to revert the server back because someone set of a mine too early? lol
Crap!  It's over?  WHY!
I'm so sad that this is coming to an end before we got to see Simon be in charge of prepping for a hoard night.
Please don't end this series.   Or at least start a new one!!!!!
This whole series is fantastic and this the best episode. I will eagerly wait for you guys to return. Oh and Simon your not that bad at the game.
After seeing the video with everyones face and verifying with a second video what appsro looks like. It kills me how everyone looks like you'd expect except appsro. The guy sounds like the pictures of Mr. Plinkett and looks like ... Um... Not Mr. Plinkett. I apologize, thought i would have something more clever by that point.
Damn,there goes my friday routine of watching Neebs 7 days to die and Dead Meat kill count pairing
Everything about this was great. Couldn't ask for a better way to end. Gosh dang f**king zombies! XD
Best episode of 7dtd
Bravo
The greatest Horde Night EVER!!!! I laughed my ass off.. The wife, the cat, the dog, the kids...they all thought I'd lost my damn mind.. Very funny shit.. Thank you for such great content.
Couldn't stop laughing. Best episode of 7d2d.  Have enjoyed everything you guys have done. Keep up the great work. ... sidenote: Appsro has stated he will be useless after the 26th. I hope you will try to develop a series of his escapades in Red Dead 2 as it will not be out for PC for a bit, if at all.
Omg the most epic horde night ever. One of the best of the series. Hope they do a horde night that Simon does the base defense can't  be any worse of a survival rate that doraleous had maybe better, at the very least it will be entertaining. Maybe neebs as his partner just to  be the guiding light he would need.
This death hole would be great to include as a POI in a mod
Doraleous is the best! Brilliant editing, loved it! :D
\"I like to die with allot of things\" ... me too man.
Thanks for this awesome episode! You guys are the best!
When Subnautica almost ended you started a pole we chose 7days to die now it ended will we get a new pole ? I mean subnautica below zero DLC is coming soon
Should of made a pit to hide in they only sug down cuz it was the shortest why to u u need to hide under the pit
Been a great series. thanks guys for making it.
What silly stupid fun. Thanks for such a great series!
Wish there was a love button at the top not just a thumbs up. This video is great. Now I am going to have to start over on watching 7days to die.
There for a minute it looked like Simon was about to go pro gamer jumping and avoiding. But then he got stuck in the death hole and he panicked, good ol Simon never disappionts
ya know i'd like to see a simon owned counter in next series.. every fuckup simon does the counter pops up and goes up 1.
im sad now.
GREATEST FINALE FOREVER!!!!!
Simon you fucking idiot you to doralious
Are you guys going to do a different world when the next season starts?
Next season can y'all make a base in the prison
Adahop you maniacal bastard!  You killed them all!  WELL DONE SIR!!!!
the end of a saga!! 7  days is one of the best series you guys have done yet.
Dora may have messed up thier protection but made an amazing episode!!! I laughed so much XD (sorry Simon) 10/10 for comedy!
BEST EPISODE EVER! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
so season finale just means you're taking a break right? still a downer but really anticipating you guys with Alpha17. beating a dead horse but underground, zombies dig above wherever you are. stupid zombies CANT FOLLOW SIMPLE DIRECTIONS! YOU IDIOTS! this was more fun than the lighthouse. thanks guys. Always good R&R after repairing railcars next to a group of Simons
@ Neebs Gaming Yes double ark uploads hopefully love the vids
It's like the Medical scene from Aliens but everyone died... Also zombies.
Nice
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader!!\" ~Neebs; by far the best episode I laughed myself to tears! Loved the series!
well,that is a great end of the journey,best video of all
Most epic death scene ever.
Normally when I watch people playing a game I know very well (I'm in the 7days club since alpha 5) it annoyes the hell out of me when they don't know shit. With you guys it's the opposite. I already had to chuckle the whole way threw dora's tour of the horde shelter last episode. That turned into loud laughter threw out this episode. I love you guys!
Whole time he just making their grave and pretending to be smart.  🙄.  I bet you feel wrong guy who commented to me he'd do something this time lol
Simon makes the best \"im dead\" sound lol
That intro music reminded me of Bugs and Taz Time Busters for the PS1.
AWESOME EPISODE!!!
Thanks guys for the laughs, I’ll miss this series please do bring it back my good sirs
LOL - they come directly for you, you have to be around the hole for them to come down, if you are off to the side they will dig for you, lol\n\ni love this vide, great job guys, :D
Why August 19th?
Sad to see the end but loved the series...Simon you came so far in this game ...but I have enjoyed watching how each character kinda fell into certain roles  and the 7 days song at the end is one of my faves Thick44!       love y'all \nAnd still so grateful my friend intruduced me to your guy's videos    🐯💙💙🐯
This is a sad day for this series😭\nBut are you guys going to do a pull for a new series like last time?
Wow exactly what I said happened 🙄 who knew🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
I love how Simon sounds like a Deformed Borker while he dies
Best. Episode.Ever.
Shoot, now what am I supposed to watch on friday after a long week of high school and work?
If the intent was to make this a sacrificial pit then job well done. Trap yourselves behind impenetrable defenses and await the slaughter. \nDoraleous was hoping to summon what exactly with this build?
Damn that gave me chills at the end the song really did it for me
Who changed the games settings
Duckduckgoose: \"Ill kill them right now.\" Simon: \"I like to die with alot of things.\" Neebs: \"Fist fightin a cheerleader, yeah!!\" Appsro: \"Do whatever you gotta do maaaan!\" Thick:\" Thats it, your goin with me!\" One liners that explain each of you in a nutshell. Fantastic stuff guys even if the failure of base wqs a tomb. Good ending
Wow awesome series guys it’s amazing that you guys have such fun with it \n\nMakes my weekends awesome to know I wake up on a Saturday morning and watch 7 days then Sunday I get ark \n\nPlease have something entertaining and fun to replace 7 days i think all your fans would appreciate it very much :)\n\nYour my favourite YouTubers :) so glad I subbed
I think they meant to put October 19th not August 19th
So sad to see the series possibly end. Im so happy I took the time to watch it! Simon you are the greatest part of the team! Thanks for an amazing series!
Nooooooo it ended
Dont forget guys zombies are like dogs and you're their reluctant owners, they like to dig, and they will stop at nothing to give you cuddles
lol, after all, that time doral spent on this he forgets to cover up one hole that kills you all what a shame lol.
we need a rd2 serie
This series was one of the most funiest series you guys did it was a great playthrough
Its been a while since one showed up. DuckDuckGoose [Dora] and that was it for the psycho names this time around.
after a mentally taxing day filled with midterms and studying, I'm glad to see one of my favourite series up once I got home
Were the deaths in the end for this episode, or the whole series? How many times have you guys died  since you started the show? Want to know.. Best episode yet of any series. Can't wait to see more!
Such an awesome series Neebs Gaming. I'm sad to see it end, but enjoyed every episode.
I hope you guys keep making these videos!!! I love 7 days from you guys so much!!!!
I loved every second of this
Duckduck goose
Dora score...1 lol
Omfg, I am so empty now! What am I going to do on my Saturday mornings now! Great episode and I can’t wait to see what you move on to now!
I'm letting Dora design my nuclear bunker not to protect me from the nuclear holocaust, but so I can have fun gunning down zombies while they break through the walls.
The bunker was a good idea in theory. IN THEORY, communism works. In theory.
No you guys can't end this series because this and ark are the best ones yet
The best one ever!!!
Seriously guys you have outdone yourself this was the funniest episode of this show ever my God I was howling laughing... I can't wait for you guys to come back to the series and I also can't wait to see what you've got in store for us in the meantime hopefully it has something to do with Red Dead Redemption 2 ... Doraleous What a Beautiful Disasterpiece!!!
Seems like you guys are clearing your schedule a bit, with the end of this and the end of ark seemingly on the horizon.\n\nI’m hoping after some frighty night fun it’s going to be some epic Red Dead 2 cinematics.
Ya kno, if nothing else, you sure can't deny that the zombies in this game are genuine experts at completely fucking up your best laid plans, just about every time. It's been fun boys.
Such a good way to end the series. Honestly cant wait for red dead. I love you guys so muxh you just seem to get how humor works and by far my favorite team of youtubers to watch! Please never stop
Y'all ever notice when the camera switches to neebs view he is rarely if ever actually fighting the zombies? I mean every now and then he'll fire off a few shots but for the most part he is just watching the others
Dog pile on Appsro!  Oh my damn!  Dora! You really suck at building defenses!  Wait, you're abandoning the series?  Damn. That means all I have to watch is your Ark series now.  To be frank, the rest just plain bites ass.  No GTA.  No Far Cry.  Very little resembling action, and comedy.\n\nI think you're dropping the ball.
have been a sub since the beginning and this is the best episode you have done keep on this wonderful work love you guys
Wonderful finale. Was expecting a burial but got much more than I expected!
During this final horde setup when dora was working under the house I was betting with my girlfriend that the plan would be to create a big pit to lure all the zombies in under the house and when enough of the zombies were confined to the chamber you guys would blow all the supports and drop the house on the lot of them while you guys escaped out of a back tunnel. I suppose the ceiling did come down but I have to ask.. Why in the hell didn't dora make an escape route? Thank you guys so much for your creations. This has been one of my favorite series to date and I'm sad to see it end for now.\nSimon, don't ever lose that 'never say live' spirit.
Awesome guys, just thanks for all of these series.
Seriously had a rough day and this video made me laugh and smile so hard!!!
what a great way to end a great series!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!  Thanks for splitting my side in laughter!
Loved this series, fantastic finale.
Not even a minute in and I had to comment... best opening EVER!!!
This series has been so entertaining to watch!!!! Love it guys ❤
Thank you guys.  I don't know what I'm going to look forward to on Fridays now
What a sexy, sexy video.
Fucking hell, doraleous 😂
This was so much fun to watch! Thanks for sucking, guys!
Sucks it's the season finale, but can't wait for the next. Thanks Doraleous for show us what NOT  to do for a horde night 😘....or ever in general! 😂 should have had Simon do the structure! I think he can fill in a hole properly! ❤
The final chapter was as epic as they get. Thanks for the great fun guys. Loved this series.
This series has become my favorite to watch. It has allowed you guys to channel your creativity better than other games and I'm sad that it's done. With that said I look forward to whatever you guys have planned next. \nThanks neebs gaming crew for the great series
Season finale? Will you guys be taking up another survival game in the mean time while you wait for A17? Or will you be dropping the series longer, even permanently?
I'm actually glad it failed, it was a lot more fun and hilarious than any other horde night!! 😂
well guys thanks for entertaining us that was the most epic horde night yet!! keep it up and show us me the struggling youtuber how it done simply amazing.
My sides hurt so much right now! Funniest episode ever. 😂😂😂😂
Honestly the best episode. It somehow beat Simon's house collapsing. The music crescendos when rocks fell and the awesome guitar solos during the action. Was perfect in everyday. Watched it during school and my class looked at me funny and my friend even asked if I was ok cause I was laughing so much. Love yall wo much! Hope this returns with the next big update
And the not my fucking job award goes to...... DORALEOUS! For single handedly dooming what should have been essentially a battleship of a base that you Titanthick'd 🤣 not sure which was the iceberg the zombies or Doraleous' engineering 🤣
I almost spit coffee on my screen when Simon got the ceiling to his head and his spirit floated away.  Well done boys!
Best series finale EVER, I have literally pissed myself laughing!!!
So that how 7 days to die dies well I call that a epic success for the zombies in the epic failure for neebs and Friends
Greatest episode I’ve ever seen on YouTube by far I will watch this episode again and again and still laugh about it
I'm just waiting for the Neebs Gaming Porno \"Get Thicked\"
No plz
They have a adahop button
Wow! Boom Baby!
congrats trophy
o wait is this the last episode?
I feel so bad for Doraleous. I mean, he tried so hard to make a bad ass Bunker for the whole team to survive the Horde Night and spent so much time building it... All just for it to completely backfire on him and literally all fall apart in the end.\n\nE for Effort, my friend...
I love this series!! I hope it comes back soon, Neebs team thank you for always making such of great content!!!
Best one yet
This episode the zombies have revenge on the neebs crew and it is so funny and awesome
Great season cant wait to see more later
I was so excited for this walking to my car to eat my lunch and watch this video.  It exceeded my expectations and made all my dreams come true.  I love Dora but I think we all knew exactly what was going to happen and I still giggled like a 12 year old girl when it did!
Seconds in and I knew I was going to love this episode. I have had many times laughing at your videos but this one I definitely laughed the most, genuine hysterical laughter. Love you all so much.
can we christen a new term now? Dora'd: definition: when Dora builds anything that backfires royally.
Nnnnnnnnoooooooo!!!!!!
I'm sad to see it end but what is next on game plan to take over 7 days spot
fantastic stuff, had tears from laughing too hard.... plus im now late for work XD glorious episode!!!
What an epic ending to an epic saga. It is said that Simons ghost still haunts what is now known as Doraleous' Pit Inn
Great series guys. Thanks for all the laughs.
My mom thinks your hot neebs
Can't wait to see what you guys do next congrats on this series you guys are without a doubt the best youtubers looking forward to seeing what's next keep up the good work guys
I absolutely love watching all your videos but this has been 1 of my top 5 favorites. Cant wait till the next season of it. You guys are amazing!!!
So........ What did you learn?
Single greatest episode ever!!!
BRAVO! BRAVO! \nCANNONS! !! BRAVO!!
Go back to Minecraft now lol XD
First time commenting, on any video actually... but what a Fantastic Season Finale! \n\nMy girlfriend and I found your channel when you all first started making 7 Days to Die videos. We were looking for a video that would give us a tutorial on how to play the game without dying so much and what we got was so much more...\nWe have been obsessed with Neebs Gaming ever since and have been watching everything we can get our hands on from each of you religiously for the past year.\n\nWe are sad to see this series end, as it was our favorite, and hope you pick it back up when the new update eventually drops. \n\nLove you guys, keep up the good work, we look forward to your videos each week!
August 19th? 0:03
Your the best YouTubers
Didnt give Simon a chance to set up a base for horde night
Is this the complete ending
SEASON 2?????
Nooooooooo
Make Simon the next horde night supervisor
This is now my favorite episode. That hole was the most deceptive thing I've ever seen. Looks safe but in reality it's more dangerous then anything I've ever seen made. You should leave a sign showing the world this is your tomb after that fiasco.
I was pretty sure it would go the way it did, hahah, but it wouldnt be a Neebs gaming episode without the chaos, ffs guys, but still great <3 btw neebs is gonna need a lot of meat stew after this :D
Damn well goobye for now 7daystodie on neebsgaming it was fun watching while i played on ps4 time to start over till next episode of something on neebsgaming
I love this video! 😭 what am i going to do without 7 days 😭\nYa'll better play more Scribble.io
What a beautiful finale
It was night at my house I woke everybody I was laughing so hard
I love Ya'll this is the best channel on the youtubes, this made my week THANK YOUALL
Bring back Subnautica...😖🙏
I knew from the reveal that the zombies were going to dig straight down and ruin that whole thing
You guys probably already know what you’ll be filling the Friday night hole with, but if not, might I suggest, we look to the stars. wink wink
What does this “season finale” thing mean?
THE MOST ANTICIPATED EVENT IN CHANNEL HISTORY!!! WILL THEY MAKE IT OUT ALIVE??\n\n\n\n\nNope.
oh p.s thanks for the entertainment... you know it's good shit when you don't mind re watching an entire series.
When the green fatty fell on appsro, what song is that playing?
rage quitting bastards! ( drawn to death narrators voice )... Come back when the  alpha whatever is finally released? or maybe move on. greener pastures?? like... red dead maybe?
That's what I call an EPIC fail.. I couldn't stop laughing.
I assume they are coming back to this (prob once A17 drops) as it is a season finale not series finale
No plan survives contact with the enemy.
I'm kinda upset you ended this series; I stopped watching arc videos 4 months ago because they've gotten boring and are all the same. What am I supposed to watch now??
your stopping it, please don't.
Y'all screams were the highlight of my day
The flaw in Doraleous' base made this a great episode, as well as the editing. I think this was the greatest episode in the whole series.
That was wonderful, it went so wrong!! Enjoyed this series as much as ark. Looking forward to what’s next guys!! Rdr2? What ever it is I know you all will make it wonderfully entertaining.
Dora really fucked the pooch on this one. It doesn't look good for a possible Dora and co construction
15:23 a wild simon appears LOL!
A whole year of fridays that made my day a whole lot better are over. I enjoyed every second, from the prison to the haunted house. Thank you for making such a great series that was adored by many.
Jesus, the music with the constant Doralingus chuckling... Best horde night so far by far
So sad the series is ending now. Alexa, play Jeep Stuff by Neebs Gaming
I was expecting a badass bunker but this was much better. The music was especially good. Thank you neebs for making me laugh and than you Adahop for a fantastically edited video.\n\nEdit: That's it? I understand this game has limited endgame but god this was a great series. What's next?
omfg, that was hilarious. can't wait for next season.
In BFF you guys ever notice o\nAbout the Colonel 100s, that the one that totally owns it you respect but the one that made a new account you made fun of.  Just thought it was interesting
Fantastic intro.
this is the best episode of 7 days ive watched. great ending to my favourite of your series on this channel. great work guys
Btw simon jumping over spinning blades i was shocked he was able to get off 3 jumps before his demise it was like watching emmit smith shake off defensive tackles for the touchdown run
THANK YOU
Best horde night ever!
Ada you outdid you're self sir
Thank you all for making my fridays the best .going to miss the seven days to die episodes they are the best .
Bravo sirs. Better series then most tv shows. I tip my hat
Should have been in neeb's cabin
Had to be the dumbest series
I watched the whole video 2 times and I couldn't stop smiling. This is one of your best videos and the editing is amazing. The overture and Thicks song really put the cherry in top. Does anyone have a link to the full version of Thicks song because that one is going in my playlist.
Yoooo this was THE BEST EPISODE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
Lamp
loved that intro lol
lol what a disaster. I love the sounds simon makes when he dies.
Doraleous Disaster!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, now there will now be a 7 days to die sized hole in my life... what am I supposed to watch as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? This series better get replaced with Simon's sandwich show lolz #Breadstrong💪🍞... Thanks for the laughs, it was great while it lasted!
This the last episode? Or it just reads like it.
Shit didn’t even hit the fan and went straight for their faces
When did Minecraft get so realistic
My favorite series by far and it was an awesome last episode! I hope yall return to it soon.
I hope to god this isnt the end of the series.    I was so excited for todays episode me and my buddy from xbox watch every time one comes out and we play 7 days together. I was taken by surprise by the outcome of dorals horde defenses. I didnt expect what took place one bit. All that hard work he did to make it and they dig in behind his defenses lol.  That sucks
I've enjoyed this so much. Im excited to see what comes in its place. Thanks for all the funny moments. And Dora you really Thicked up that one.
😢7 Days, never forget!\nPS...the song at the end is amazing guys.
I predicted this, just not at this scale of shitshowness. Great editing btw
Most spectacular episode ever! Great work, absolutely loved every second of the series!!!
Gud vid luv your channel
I love it when you guys fail, never go pro, always be the everyman (men) of gaming
Season or series?
Bittersweet. An amazing epic finale, but a finale nonetheless. And an incredible editing feat. I hope that you guys can come back to this in a year or so when the game has been updated and heavily patched. Maybe a nice random map. I love this game and you guys made it that much more entertaining. Thanks.
Well that went...well.Don't ever stop 7 dtd you crazy M.F.ers
Lol that was a spectacular fail. I love this series
This is by far my favorite 7 days video!
It looked like such a promising idea.. A+ for effect, Dora.
Even though this didnt go to plan, great job Dora. I was laughing so hard! Funniest ep so far.
Wait what 7days to die is over... why???!!! 😡
Know that was epic
THIS IS AWEEESSSOOOMMEE!!!!
Had to re-watch this 4 times, because I kept laughing thru the entire thing.  This was so well done!!!  Editing was just dead on and hysterical.
What an epic way to end it 😂
What?!?! Finale when's the new season?
Could not stop laughing, almost died while eating my lunch hahaha
NOOOOO DONT END!
Might be the best episode yet, EPIC!
This was the best episode ever in any series you have made yet. Amazing job boys. Id like too thank you for the years of entertainment and i would love too see more from your channel for many more years to come. Even if \"doralingus\" lead you to your perfect death i dont think it could have ended any better. Hows that beer taste now boys? Well earned and bloody maybe? #COMMENTINGONCOMMENTS
I knew this was a bad setup, but had no idea it would be this bad
Wonder what new series you guys could come up with! Really enjoyed these over the year, well done! 👍
If you end Ark I'm unsubscribing...well prob not but still. Something good better replace this.
Bravo, Fellas! What a great finale. I loved Doralious just giggling at everyone in full panic mode.
I for one will miss this series. But, its was a hell of a send off. I kinda was hoping Doraleous had rigged add the whole ceiling with TNT and he had a secret switch wired to it. Just waiting for the climax moment to in tomb them all.
OMG BEST EPISODE EVER!!! AND IVE ONLY WATCHED 10 MINS!
I was so happy to find that Simon finally got the torch he wanted
Best one yet gonna miss this
The forest next?
Is this really the end of 7 days to die because I am going to miss you guys playing this
Hey needs gaming y'all should play the forest since this little series is over with now just an idea check it out needs will like it
What a fucking amazing way to end a series cant wait to see what's next!!
One of the best 7 Days video you guys have ever made. Super hilarious, great work guys!
Best. 7 Days. Video. Ever.
Wow nice job Dora...\"you really prepared well\"
Oooh Simon
Awe dangit. I don't want it to end 😭
Absolutely loved this episode so so funny well done Doraleous💜 and gutted the series is ending it is my favourite that you guys have done. But I hope whatever is to come, whatever is going to replace it is just as good! High expectations guys! Much love :)
When i saw the word \"End\" i hoped it was the last spiderman video but ya know its Friday. I can dream cant I.
I could not have hoped for a better ending
Great finale! Hope you guys return to 7 days soon. Alpha 17 is dropping soon and it has all kinds of badass improvements. I think you guys can contine making this great series when it comes out. Just think of the fun you guys can have with the new vehicles. You can get bikes, mini bikes, motorcycles, jeeps and even a Madmax style gyrocopter. Just think of it Simon flying a gyrocopter.
Seriously, laughed my socks off... “best laid plans” curse strikes again. 😂
This made me cry c:
Simply amazing
This was so good, that it makes you wanna slap yo momma!\nThanks for the series! Made my friday evenings or hungover saturdays a whole lot better!
It saddens the shit outta me to see this end. But i know theres something just as good, if not better coming. Thank you guys for this incredibly amazing series. Cant wait to see what you have in store for us next! And thick44 sir... well done on the song! Great fucking cut! Doraleous... for shame! I love you, but holy fuck....  great video, again fellers!
O sweet lord I have not laughed that hard in forever. So needed that after a rough week. I now need a break for my break just to recover from my break. Spectacular epic fail Dora! lolololol
Brilliant! Only Doraleous is capable of making something this ingenious  on paper that fails so effectively in application.\nReally though, what made him think zombies wouldn't eventually start raining from the sky?
Im subscribed to many youtubers, but Neebs is the only channel where I always watch new videos. I think its safe to say that Neebs Gaming is my favorite channel. Thanks for the great content!
oh fuck that was great.  after a long day of work, this is just perfect to come home to and watch after the kids go to bed.  unfortunately theyre all awake due to me laughing my ass off.  and i think my bronchitis is making a comeback.  thanks guys, i see you next season! orr else..(shakes fist at the screen)
Great finale guys
I wish I could be on comments with comments that part when thick looks up and sees all them zombies will forever go downs as the funniest shit in the world. Hands down also keep it up your guys videos are getting better and better every time.
When neebs put on thick's duster... https://imgur.com/a/AsQrmCL at 22:49
And so it really did become a grave. Best way to end the series. Love you guys!
Looks like I'm the mayor of Itoldyousoville. I called the roof collapsing last week.
I love how confident Dora was this whole time.. haha love you all!!
so THAT'S why the place is called journeys end
Video hasnt even started but I see the title......why.....this has been great...but I understand yall prolly tired of doing this
Please tell me the series will continue. Please tell me you guys aren't done with 7 Days
NOOOOO I NEED MORE
Is this the end of 7 Days? Whats next?
Funniest episode yet!!!
I want to think the “Duckduckgoose” Dora name was a dig at his dirty Minnesotan name for that game (Duck Duck Grey Duck)
Can we get a video of just how fucked journey's end was? Thanks!
The only part that worked was the tunnel demo.  The rest was a shit show.  It would be awesome to see you guys actually pull this off just once.
Barrles dont make heat or torches
I love the Irony that this was the most well prepaired Horde Night, and ended in the biggest fiasco
omg that was amazing! Totally didnt expect the fantastic failure until i saw debris falling above them.
Im sad to see it go but thank you for all the good times guys great work and much love cant wait to see what's next but i must admit i will miss 7 days to die
well death iI guess
Loved this episode! especially when neebs was safe and simon brought them all over to him haha
holy jesus how much did i miss
NOOO 7 DAYS TO DIE WAS THE ONE THING U WATCHED BC YOU STOPPED DOING RAGE COP AND GTA MODS pls continue rage cop with and without cinematic and mods and gta without cinematic bc i loved those pls
Damn. Fall back to ark I guess
Guys the video pic said SEASON FINALE. Not series finale so this is on hiatus. \nOn that note Neebs Gaming crew thank you for ending it on a high note and not some cheesey slop thrown together. \nLove guys and cant wait to see what you guys bring our way. 😚💜
Guess before watching Dora finally goes full crazy.
You're sending this series but not Ark? Man, Ark is so boring anymore compared to this.
Dude  literally our whole company chills out  In the squad Bay puts you up on our entire wall and watches you one episode after lunch.  We're always done early in the day anyways, If you guys succeed in your mission we leave without having a final formation.  However  With Simon we make a company bet on him falling down a hole And base it on heads or tails if we leave at 13:00 or 16:00. Simon please stop falling down holes. Love you buddy but dam look down more often. Not too much pressure. This is from my platoon sergeant NEEBS  Make a print out of  The map of whatever game you are playing You're like an LT You get lost easy thanks for the laughs just a helpful Tip.  Semper Fi
oh dora, form the police station to the death pit, you never seemed to considered that you dont know what you're doing.
Why didn't you guys visit all the old places like at the end of mine craft. Would made this video even better.
Was gonna call Simon stupid for saying he wanted to die with a lot of things. Then I realised that that's what we are doing in real life as well.
They got doraded.
This was the all time best episode, with the all time best defense strat, with zero flaws in its design. It was all user error which caused the so called “failure” #Dora for president
Hahaha
NOOOOOO NOT THE FINALLEEEEEEE IM SAD
Finally! Finally they used the Seven Days to Die song in a 7 Days to Die episode. They just had to wait for the finale, lol. xD \n\nBtw, who didn't saw this coming? People have been warning them way back the first horde night that zombies can and will dig regardless and Doraleous insist on building bases underground. xD So when is the next season going to start? I hope it won't be until Aplha17 comes.\r Damn, Doraleous parctically ended the series with that horde night. Lmao.
WAIT YOU CAN'T END THE SERIES, THICK DORALEOUS HASN'T FOUND SARAH'S TREASURE!!!
Loved this series , been so funny to watch I hope you do season 2 !
Back to it some day?! You fucking fucks better start playing this shit at the start of next year. Don't know what I'm going to do Friday now, it's not like I get out of the house and have a life or something, who needs a wife when Neebs and crew satisfy your needs.
Best episode by far!!!!  Gonna miss the series. GOOD JOB FELLAS!!!!!
I loved Dora's maniacal laughter as everyone is being slaughtered.
most entertaining 7 days to die video in the world! holy crap
Waiting now for a17?
You guys like it at 75? Jeez, I keep it at 68 degrees in my house. Great video, as always!
little sad about the last note saying might return to it someday, i hope you guys are planning to continue to do it :( also i noticed it was the dora scora not simon score
might have seven days to live,but I probably have 7 DAYS TO DIE.fantastic job guys
Bim bum bam, you keep being the best guys!\n\nFrom Italy with love, can't wait your next job!!
dora your hole would have worked to lure them if you placed a ladder to the surface in the hole you blew up to give them a path to follow, they had no path so the got stuck on the surface and dug down on top of you guys
It does say season finale not series finale, I dont think its over is it?
An absolute fantastic end to the season.
Man! Had such high hopes for this hoard night. WTF DORALINGUS!? Still was funny but.... End like that. t-.-t
This was an amazing series and I'm kinda sad to see it go but you guys ended it so great! Loved the song and death count at the end, it was a nice and funny touch
fire doesnt actually attract zombies
FUCKING GLORIOUS!!!!!
Best episode ever. I laughed So hard I nearly pissed myself. Great job Dora... \"I'll show them how to stay safe.\" Thanks for all wonderful hours of entertainment.
This series is great
2:24 duck duck goose!!!!!!\nAdahop > anphony
Doraleous you put your heart in that fort and the damn zombis trample all over it like if it were grass at a consert!
My expectations were so high.
Best series you have ever donw in my opinion, nothing but a great adventure with none stop laughter all the way. I hope you will continue this when alpha 17 drops. You're the best :)
Heat doesn't mean things burning - barrels, torches etc etc... It means any activity like a heatmap. You dig underground, running a forge, building a base, and all that will cause congo lines and screamers to spawn.
I have never laughed so hard and been so disappointed at the same time in my life!
This has to be one of the best most epic and funniest 7 Days to Die video you you guys have ever made!!! This episode was so freaking awesome and it was a proper season finale to the series! Hopefully we will return. Oh, that's 7 Days to Die song is now stuck in my head and it is awesome! 🎶I have 7 Days to Live but I probably have 7 Days to Die!!🎶
that intro had me like... oh... OH NO thick is gonna freak about the thermostat
So sad that this is the end of the journey, but what a way to go out.  Great Job Dora!!!
Fuckin epic!
Bra-fucking-vo!\nSo does this mean you guys are starting from scratch on a pristine new map? When?
I loved this episode. I was waiting for the day where you guys would all just keep dying on horde night haha 10/10 would watch again.
NOOOOOO   This series match perfect with the week every 7 days it's like waiting for f***** Saturday morning cartoon you look forward to it no no no  Dam it
Awesome tomb guys, cool song aswell.
Well done)
Loved, loved, LOVED this series.  Thank you guys so much for the wonderful entertainment.  I could not have thought of a more perfect way to end the series.  Looking forward to what's next.  #WorldPeace
So many great quotes from this series. Hats off neebs gaming
I have no words to express this video.
Fantastic, best hoard night ever!
Wait Wait WAIT!!! is this the las Ep.???????
Thank you Neebs Gaming for ending the 7 Days to Die series I hope you start a new 7 Days to Die series. Thank you and keep making new videos like my second favorite series Ark Survival Evolved.
Love that song
Easily the best episode ever.
how many times did they all die????? i know simon died the most lol
You guys have outdone it this time what an amazing episode massively enjoyed it well done
is this the end
I got a new server for u to try it is one of the most easy but hard severs I have been on it has all fiber craft no starve no thirst but u have to watch your surroundings the surver name is Fiber craft custom drops 7
You can see thick's face at the start of the video when he changes temperature.
Best end to a series ever.
How do you give this series a finally before ark
I also loved the music made is even funnier
sad to see it end, but hey, it was fun, thanks for all the laughs and all the good times from this amazing show.
Was anyone else thinking of Home Alone during the opening sequence? Thanks to the song.
I’ve never laughed so hard!
makes giant bunker fails to fix the 1 small hole that leads to failure...
think you guys are being to kind to Doraleous giving him a 1 at the end of that. worst and most prepared for horde night ever . How could he leave those holes open. Go sit in the corner Doraleous and think about what you've done.
Omg this was the funniest ep ever haha first no therapy then no school today now this best day ever i love you guys
BEST HORDE NIGHT EVER!!
My 2 favorite series have died in less then a month. I will miss 7dtd and raft....
OMG I don't think I have laughed this hard in along long time. Awesome job all!! \n\nSpecial note,  I love the sounds you all make when you die! Lol
The Death Star all over again...On the surface, a force to be reckoned with, yet built with one simple flaw that brought the entire thing down in a blaze of glory. Great video!
What A Into To The Video Loved It. Love watching you guys. you guys are hilarious.
Poor Simon doesn't have a fucking clue what's going on its hilarious 😆....👍
I saw this coming MILES AWAY
Started watching the series from the first episode and now to look back at it you guys made a fantastic series guys.
That was beautiful! I think I might just watch it two more times just to really let it all “sink in”. You guys are the absolute best.
best one ever loved it laughed so hard thanks ya'll
Series Finale gives me hope that there will be more after the update since it isn't titled Series Finale.. If this really is the end of a series I am excited to see what is next!!
I love you guys. Seriously, nothing more enjoyable than watching what you’ve created. I’ve said it many times, I don’t watch tv anymore. I rewatch old anime, i keep up with Always Sunny in Philadelphia, watch you guys and game. Besides work and a social life, y’all make up a big part of my routines!
I'm saddened to hear that the series is over considering you can do unlimited nights but I understand that there's other games that need to be play and there's other projects that need to be focused on. If you guys need the end it you ended on a really really good note. I wish I could see what the final score was but I'm happy you put the death toll towards the end. thank you for bringing the series to life thank you for your friendships and sharing your adventures with us 7 days was a really great series and hopefully in the future if you guys are still doing this maybe you could bring it back on the night that you're on and keep it on the level you're at as well as everything else. You guys are true Warriors so it should be set on that difficulty at all times if an when you get back into the game and keep it as that many zombies that looked very interesting but it also look like it was dropping your frames and whatnot. I'm really sorry your Hunker bunker didn't turn out the way you wanted it doraleous it looks like it took a long time to make and it looked like it was inpenetrable. Rest in peace Journeys End rest in peace 7 days, for now hopefully, to be honest I was actually expecting the building to fall apart but this episode exceeded my expectations. On a top note, I could not stop laughing as soon as the music came on for all the deaths my sides are still killing me XD I guess I'm having the same feeling as like having the same feeling I had for their one-day of Ark Aberration. I would love to see them continue the Arts Series going step by step especially with Extinction going to be released but that's probably why they also did the one day there. maybe once they're done with Ragnarok they will be done with Ark in general who knows but I highly doubt it I believe the next season if you want to call it that of Ark since they only did the one day of Ark aberration it's going to take place in extinction but that's not my place to call or say that's up to Neebs Gaming to decide. Who knows maybe we might get some more time in the raft videos now that they're done with one project and a new door has open. Sad to see 7 Days Go I'm pretty sure we got to see neebs thick doraleous build their bunkers and everything for horde night and I was looking forward to seeing Simon and Appsro building forts of Their Own but as I said before and as I said again if this was the season finale this was one way of ending it as well as ending it on a high note with so Much Death Carnage explosions suicides by traps this is definitely needs gaming material here material that's going to last for so long and material that's going to keep us laughing and coming back for more. Keep making great series guys keep making us laugh keep gaming and you will always have our hearts no matter what :)
Ok guys, I don't want to be the demanding kind of fan but you just told me you're stopping my favorite show for a while SO YOU GUYS BETTER BE WORKING ON SOMETHING GOOD!!! ｡゜(｀Д´)゜｡
So sad and so hilarious
So when Adahop asked what we think Dora was doing in his room did anyone guess elaborate trap to turn his friends into zombie food? Those must've been the happiest zombies..
Best 7 Days to Die episode ever
I was so sad to see that this was the series finale. But what a finale it was.  Thank you guys for all the laughter.  \n\nTo my grand kids , here is the proof that I knew about Neebs Gaming. When they were just a Youtube channel.
I've never laughed so much for a video before. Best finale ever. thanks Ada and neebs crew
Great episode!!! Your downfall was because the 7 Days pathing leads the zombies to you in a straight line, so they detected you through the ground above you and... well... best-laid plans of mice and men...
August 19th is my birthday!!
Best hord night ever :) thanks for this!
Dang, that one fat zombie got lit up
It was beautifully done, the music, the collage, the cartoons, and the epic wipe out of you all. \nI must ask, are you just bringing up hope or will there be a zomb squad, like mob squad but for 7 days to die? Like seven 24 hrs worth of cartoons of you guys?
Is neebs gaming stoping the series ?
great video guys really had a laugh watching this, Dora you did a great job fucking this up, I loved it. Who got more kills? the team vs zombies or Simon vs himself
That intro tho\nNoice
So umm overall a total success eh bois?
Well done. I can't wait for the redemption base.
Great episode.Waiting for more or maybe on next A17/18?
great vid guys
Best series ever done by the Crew :)
lol
Y’all should play star bound. It’s a well put together survival game that takes place in space.
That was so fucking funny i laughed the whole way through the video
He should have built the base under the house it would have worked
My favourite series from you guys. I will miss the laughter and the slaughter!
That was the most spectacular failure I've ever seen. Bravo, Doraleous, bravo.
Why would you blow a hole to start with?
Don’t quiiiiiiit!!!!!!!
does this mean no more 7 days to die
This episode was hilarious....Thank you Guys !!!  Always makes my day better !!!
More classical music in all videos please and thank you. Classes up the place
Fantastic job as always guys. Dora, I expected this night to go really smoothly, and I'm really disappointed in you. Love you all.
This series has been very fun to watch. This might have been my favorite episode of all (maybe). You guys are great!
noooooo it cant be over!
Appsro Im just putting this out there but was wondering if you have taken a look at Breaths Edge on steam. Its suppose to be a Space style Subnautica. just thought you may want to take a look into it.
Does anybody know how to download their map I think I saw it briefly at the end of this episode but it moved kind of fast
This was an amazing way to end the \"season\" of 7 days! Adahop, sir, you have done one hell of a job with everything you did for this series. It is by far one of my favorite series and I am sure I will watch it countless more times! thanks guys for the laughs. Hope to see something soon to replace this on the weekend lineup!
They got Doraled
Awesome awesome awesome series guys THANK YOU!! Thoroughly enjoyed watching on a friday night and hope you giys do revisit soon, but for now its obviously time for a change of scenery and something new for a friday night, whatever it is im sure you guys will make it epic, as always, well, im gonna go find the playlist amd go watch em all again 😁 been an experience guys, and again, thank you 🙏
what an explosive episode
I’m gonna miss this... love the opening scene tho! You guys are great, this series has always been one of my favorites
You guys are trully awesome. Thank you so much for a trully awesome final episode of 7 days. my partner and I haven't laughed so much in ages xx
This was the funnyiest 7 days to die video ever
all of you including Simon have been promoted
Great way of ending the series, forward! on to the next death bunker. Just lets leave the mines.
Don’t feel bad Dora, you had a great idea. Unfortunately, video game logic. I’ll never stop loving you buddy!
Now that you guys onow alot more of what your doing amd need i think u should start a part two of series and start over i love watching these every week dont stop lol
This was the BEST Finale anywhere - even including TV finales!!!! And every few minutes hearing somebody exclaim \"Damn it Doralious!!!!!!\" as they are being decimated in the Dora-tomb land LOL. And can always have Asspro give a great one liner : Somebody has a rocket launcher.....Shoot Dora with it!!!!\" LMFAO
This was so entertaining it hurt
Someone THICKED the shit out of y'all LOL
best video eveeer
Aw man.  This series is ending?  \n\nI hope ya'll return to it at Alpha 17 when they get jeeps and such.\n\nThanks for the awesome show! I truly enjoyed it!
No
So no more 7 days huh?  I hope there's more!
the deaths are just so hahahaha
This episode was great guys thanks for the barrels of laughs and hope you guys had some fun.
So no more 7 days to die videos?
What an absolutely amazing failure guys! That was so much fun to watch
Best video I’ve ever seen love you guys your all the greatest YouTubers to ever live you all deserve more subs I can’t believe you guys aren’t the biggest channel on YouTube yet but I know you will get there. Keep up the great work
Best,episode,ever
Using the 1812 Overture in the last third of the video is fantastic, love you guys, can't think of a better ending!
<3
So this is the nightmare before christmas?
Figures i get into your 7 days playthrough right before the end of a season. Lol
Great job guys!!
You guys going to start a new season when the next 7d2d update comes out?
Tried warning them lol
Best episode!
Honestly, I love everything you guys put out, but that is the hardest I have ever laughed at a YouTube video. Absolutely loved the death screens/1812 cannons part.\nY'all did an amazing job on this one. Thank you :)
Best video on YouTube by far
That was so epic! I can't think of any other content maker who's more suitable to play this game than you guys. I'm still laughing just thinking of this episode. You are truly masters of the art.
Well, thanks guys.  I came for the underwater shennanigans of Subnautica and stayed for 7 Days.  Now you're done, I guess I am too.  Quite a bit too old for all your other stuff, but I've had a blast.  So thanks for all the laughs and have fun with whatever else you do.
I can't wait to see Simon preparing you guys for the horde night
OMG people, that was EPIC! It makes Odysseus look tame.
Liked before opening title.. this is gonna be goooooddd
The editing coupled with the 1812 Overture, was a stroke of genius!   Great job guys!!!!
Please continue with a17, you have to come back to it please please please please please please please 😂
Is it just me or did this all seem like a bigger more hilarious version of Simon's glass house?\n\n\n\n\nAnd to think I had faith in you Dora! xD
The 1812 Overture was perfect. Good job as usual Anthony.
I have no idea why but when Adahop turned down the heat, that shit was beyond funny. Adahop is like my mom!!!!! Always setting the temperature to freezing. Who knew all this time that she was protecting us from creating too much heat on horde nights.
Press F to pay Respects.
This episode was absolute perfection on all levels!
That was awesome guys..Thank you so much for all the good times and making  me laugh at work..8-)
Doraleous is no longer in charge of prepping for horde nights
You guys should definitely make that outro song into a full song
Best one yet
This episode needs every award that exists and another twenty that doesn't exist yet!
More please I haven't laffd so much in a long time
First episode I thought I was going to hate this series because of how wonky and ugly it was but It ended up being one of my favorite series to watch and i think its because of the chemistry you guys have together that makes every episode a great time and the creativity you guys bring is just fucking awesome . Crazy doraleous was my favorite and especially the silly name changes like dorito and knees. Love you guys and keep up the great work!!!
BFF was one of the funniest series you guys have done but... as far as all out entertainment, 7D2D has held my attention, always looking forward to friday! The editing gets better every episode and even though you've created a  base in every biome I could probably watch you guys play this game for another year! It's been inching up as my favorite series and I gotta say I think this episode tipped the scales. BEST EVER. Sad to see ya'll take a break from it. PLEASE! Come back to it when Alpha 17 releases!!! Now... who's gonna start this series over from the beginning?... again lol follow me!!!
That's like if snafu and klusterfuk had a baby
This was so sad. It's like your favorite heroes getting their asses kicked over and over. 10/10 guys.
So to be clear, Doraleous change the game settings at the beginning ?
Wtf is DuckDuckGoose
Simon is the best :)
Simon needs a fucking brain not his stuff most of his deaths was from stupidity
::stands and gives a slow clap ovation::
I love it when everything seems secure......and then goes to shit in a big way! A la Doraleous ignoring the glaring hole right above your heads! Classic! 10 outta 10, 2 thumbs up and so forth! 👏
Watching this at 5 am makes it 5x funnier, Simon being Simon, the constant GAAAGGHHH and screams in the distance, by far my favourite 7days video
Honestly the best way to end the season.  I loved the death count.  Doraleous, you ignorant slut, I had so much hope for your bunker.  Ella Marie looks down in disappointment.
One of your best episodes of all your series hands down, including Subnatica. Very well done in all aspects sans reinforcing the roof lol
I haven't laughed this hard to tears in a while LOL Simon and Appsro have the most comical death screams. I really thought this would be their easiest horde night yet somehow you guys always seem to know how to subvert all of our expectations.
Dora for PREZZZZZ
called it!!! i knew it was the end!!!
I'm gonna miss this series. You guys made a fantastic series with an awesome finale. Thanks you for the hours of laughter
Masterfully done and a fitting end to a magnificent series. Thank you.
This show has been fantastic guys. Its brought many laughs to the end of a stressful work week and I appreciate all that you do. I'm sad to see it go, but excited to see what else you guys come up with! Keep on keepin' on.
Fuck Thick\nFuck Appsro\nFuck Simon\nAnd Fuck Neebs (and Ada but hes not important) \nDoralious has been the best of all these past few moths. Seriously it's like he planned this to fail as revenge for all the times his builds get ripped on sense you guys do t kill each other as often as you should. Live you Dora.
Season 2 coming soon
Well if you've gotta go you may as well go with a bang haha, brilliant :)
Great video 😂👌🏻
Just had surgery and this literally hurts because of how much I’m laughing!
I hope this isn't actually the end of 7 days. This is something I didn't think I'd ever enjoy watching but my God every upload I've watched the day it's gone up. I love this series so fucking much.
Great job guys
no more 7 days? :'(
august 19th is my birthay
Since when do zombies die on wood spikes under warrior difficulty?
You're abandoning 7 days to die? Well aint that some bullshit?!
Please for the love of god, do this series again soon! It was great!!
Is this the last 7 Days to Die or will there be a new season when the new update come out, either way we've still got Ark their best series.
Worst day in the game for you guys and the best day on YouTube for me. Well done guys on creating such a entertaining and enjoyable series, you guys deserve a lot more credit and subscribers then you already have, So thank you Neebs and Crew💪🏻👍🏻
awesome music during the horde,reminded me of john petrucci's solo album
It saddens me to see the series end for now. But this series provided me tons of laughter and this will forever be one of my favorite series by you guys. Thank you so much for the time and effort you guys put into this for our entertainment.  Love you guys stay safe~❤
Hurricane in real life is immediately followed by a hurricane of zombies and death in the game.
No season Final
Is this the end of 7 days forever
Everyone watch your step! Simon what are you doing out here! Oh hey thick... lol and on that day no cares were given to Thicks safety
That was effing amazing. The deaths syncopated with the music...
The greatest gaming channel ever
You guys are the best, I watched this three times and still laughed just as hard as the first. That song at the end too, glad you used it, love it and found it to be very fitting. Seriously, awesome work you guys - THANK YOU for all that you do! Much love to you all. <3
That was great guys. I've been playing this with my wife for over a year migrating from PS4 to PC. We got bored at our main base and had pretty much the same thing happen a few weeks ago at an improvised base. Hope you come back for alpha 17 since it looks like a lot of new content. I'm sure Simon will be able to fly a helicopter better on here that on GTA5, what could go wrong?
Love this series, please bring it back one day 🙏🏼🙏🏼🤧😪
I'm so god damn sad this series is over but I'm so god damn glad this is how it did.
Hope you guys do a season 2 on a random generated map! Be fun you see you guys explore the unknown!
I'm a bus driver... I should not watch this in mine breaks...  People asked me why I cried...
That was was the best. My eyes are still watering.
HOW BEAUTIFUL, I LOVE YOU GUYS ❤❤❤
HAHAHAHA!!!  I just don't understand how you can be this bad after playing for so long. I love how awful you all are. Thanks fellas!!!!!!!
Love the content and thank you for an amazing ride along with you fellas. Went from Mexico Fort to Death Hole! And you all didn’t learn a thing lol
I want to see Simon make the fortifications for the next horde night please make it happen!
Please don't end seven days. You guys should start a new game on random gen.  I wouldn't even mind if you gave yourself a minibike to start with. Just sayin
Time to start Fallout 76!!!
Nooooooo don’t leave. Love these episodes will 100%watch it from the start about like 3 more times and Apstro will u tell thick fuck u it’s so funny
Man, I got kind of emotional over this! I remember the night i was lying in bed, and watched the very first episode the day it came out. I love this series! Thanks guys for always making the best gaming content on YouTube! You guys are awesome!
HAHAHA! I love you, Adahop!! Great editing and nice ownage. I haven't laughed this much in a while.
Just imagine what the next season finale will be like
Dope
Best episode yet...don't worry Simon i'm right there with you on the death count cause I seem to suck at living in 7d2d also...but on also, is this gonna be the last of the 7 days episodes??? :(  if so
This has to be the best 7 days video ya'll have.
sweet Jesus on rye this is the best thing I've seen this week
WOW my sides hurt from laughing so hard yet again guys. sad to see 7 days go. hope it comes back some day. great work all of you.
\"I'm in a fist fight with a cheerleader...\"
Simon was determined to trip every mine in the death hole.
Loved this series, my mom and me watch it together.  It’s the only video game she will play and she is always making me play with her lol. Ur guys videos have helped her and me through job changes, family health issues, and much more. Love u guys and keep up the amazing videos.
FUCKING EPIC!
DONT STOP PLAYING PLEASE
What’s the music you used at the end? Epic!
The safety of the base Doralious built is equivalent to a death star
Best episode ever. Fucking love you guys.
So we learned Simon is very determined. Thick isn't as good as he says. Appsro is the best gamer out of them. Neebs is a lucky guy. And Deraleous is the laziest horde night defence designer. But man do I love them all. Great stuff guys.
When they eventually come back to this, I hope they let Simon create his own horde night place lol
Lols, best failed base ever.
Reading the comments before watching the video (shame on me, i know), i learned that it would fail, and was actually really sad. I went into the video expecting to leave it with a bad taste in my mouth (shame on me, i know), because I felt so bad for Doraleous. But the way you guys reacted to everything going wrong made me enjoy the video even more than I probably would have had it succeeded. Congratulations on being able to laugh uncontrollably at your complete and utter failure, and allowing others to as well :-)
god damnit dorarara
Noooo it cant be the end
Nice going doraleous you've made the safest tomb in exsistance but to be fair i could have made anything near as awesome looking also is that it for 7 days?
7 dAYS TO DIE IS MY 2 FAV GAME YALL PLAY.. MY FIRST IS ARK SINCE IM A BIG ARK NERD...BUT I LOVE YALL VIDEOS.. I BEEN A SUBSCRIBED TO YALL SIINCE YALL HAD 23K SUBS
The blue spirits when they died had me in stitches
I really wanted this to work, Doraleous
That was by far, the most brilliant and sophisticated way to lure your best friends into a death trap to mauled by a zombie horde. Tip of the cap Doraleus!
OMG Best episode ever! laughed my floppy tits off!
So now are you guys taking a vacation to the Hilton for the toothpaste convention?
\"Appsro bringin the heeeaaat!!\" -Neebs\n*cricket noise* \nI'm dying right now... 😂😂😂
Best episode ever !!!!!
Dor: I just saved Simon\nSimon: Why?\nlarf
7 days to die has been my favorite neebs gaming series so far.
What a finale, almost shit myself laughing towards the end. Bravo chaps. Look forward to your next series
Well... What can I say !??. That was   with out a doubt just Epic. 😆 You guys really put me in a good mood . Please never stop and always be friends.
Thank you guys for this series. It was fantastic. Do you guys think you'll ever do a short series of The Forest? You guys would love it.
Beauty of an episode! Would have been one boring night of standing around for you guys, if Doraleus didn't F up with the cave in while building the thing :D
That was fubar haha
That was the most successfully spectacular failure I have ever seen. Best episode ever.
SIMON HAD ME DYING IN THIS EPISODE
I feel bad for Dora, all that work went to shit because he didn't feel like making the \"safe\" room a reinforced metal box and fill up a hole over it.
LOL, doraleous score! lol, im ded
Love you neebs gaming. You guys keep up the good work and awesome content. I live in Indiana and my buddy showed me your channel one day and I’ve loved it ever since. He has since moved to Minnesota about 11 hours away from me but we still keep in contact and talk about you guys constantly. Give a shout out to Justin Dickey for me on the next commenting on comments please!  (ThAts his real name)
Doraleous secretly works for whatever corporation is making the zombies. The whole series he's always been different, remember the sniper rifle scope moments? And now he showed some enthusiasm about making  a horde night place and it turned out to be a death trap for all of them. And he's been laughing maniacally the whole time.
I have been watching religiously for 2 years now, and this is by far the best video you guys have ever made
You guys have a direct line to my funny bone because damn this shit show of a horde night has been the best these have ever been!! Thank you all so much!! And Adahop you chinky bastard way to crank that challenge bar to fucking Warrior!!!!
I'm sorry to see this series end, but what an ending! Perfect! LOL
good stuff fellas . i hope we see more after the update
\"Is that the 1812 Over-... oh god...\"\n\n\nThank you guys for making this amazing series. ^_^
Sad that this series has met its end, but what better way to end it with this episode. A killfest. Of both zombies and Simon's. \n\n\nAlsowheresthesimonscor-
OMG!...OMG!...OMG!   :D    Best Youtube video of all time!!!!  I was laughing and giggling so much!!!
Best episode ever
What a weak ending. You guys built this series for like a year! And you end it with a shitty title screen at the end saying blah blah blah we MIGHT return to your second best series. This game is more than horde nights. Do a random gen map. Mess with the settings a bit. But to dump it so suddenly is a slap in the face to everyone.
Omg lmao u guys! Great job!
Isn't it weird how we show our love for this group of people simply by watching ads and clicking a button...
what's next?
Nice intro
What a great and hilarious video! Sad to see this series ending as i enjoyed it so much, but you cannot do a single game for years (except ark). It was a great run and i am looking forward for the replacing series
The series ended and we never saw a  \"doraleous castle\" being built.
100% will miss this series.
thank you for such a great series!!!
GLORIOUS! pretty cool of you to include the map. TY
Yep. Wile E. Coyote
I have to say, Neebs finally made me happy in this game. No poetry, no whining,  just pew pews and first fights with cheerleaders. Basic happiness.
You guys should encase yourselves in a giant metal box and place TNT all around it.
I NEED MY STUFF!
I love this  editing lmao
Simon's composure is non-existent.
Please don't end this series!! This was the best one yet. I'm going to start a monthly Patreon subscription for you all because I enjoy the 7D2D videos so much. Knowing there'll be a Friday video make the whole week off waiting with it. Keep up the great work guys. I'm a fan.
It was all becaue of one man
5:26 \"I'M  ABOUT TO BLOW THE TORCH\" 😂😂😂 Doraleous we all love you, ya cheeky get.
That was golrious ,...... LEVOLUTION !
Kinda like Fraggle Rock watching this. Fraggles trying to stop the Gorgs getting in.
Good concept idea by Dora, to try and get all the zombies to focus from one direction, too bad he missed one or two details that would've made it an easy night, the key mistake was building underground. Good series though, I just wish some of the mods were better optimized and didn't make the game run like potato for anyone without a high-end PC, as the Ravenhearst mod would be good for them otherwise.
Hands down your best video yet. Love you guys. Keep up the good work.
Amazing editing, loved it!
Get that cheerleader neebs
This episode was so chaotic. I love it.
How the tables have turned... Looks like the hole fell on simon. My favorite episode so far! You guys are too damn funny.
You guys are the best .I want to thank you all for making my day happier every time
Nice series guys. Good ending.
This was exactly what I needed to get through this 3 hour layover at this bus stop/gas station in the middle of Idaho. Sad to see this series go
Best horde night ever.
Simon: Shouldn't we be shooting. \n\nEveryone else: didn't hear him over their gun fire.
Jesus tap dancing Christ you would have thought with all the showboating, demanding, and acting all superior towards making them survive to end up with one flaw that he actually knew about 4 days prior?? 😂😂😂😂😂 Please bring this series back so we can all hear the Dora roasting. Effed up idea but let Simon do the next hoard night with Neebs as an advisor
Wow, just wow. How did you not see that coming? Adahop you are a masterful editor though.
Ada, is that you on the reflection of the screen between the 0:10 and 0:12?
Love the death voices! That was funny af!!!
Loved this series and hope to see it return one day. It provided many laughs and good times. Thank you neebs and crew for the great entertainment and hours of hilarious misadventures love the channel. WORLD PEACE✌✌
@21:53 Neebs ~ “I’m fighting a cheerleader, yeah!” 😂🤣😂🤣😂
uh is this the end of the first season of 7 days to die
Hey neebs can y’all do a Red Dead Redemption 2 series like your gta5 stuff
This is how things go in real life, someone drops the ball in some really really mundane task... like... leaving the rock in front of the door.  Or... drinking 2 cups of coffee every morning when their ration is one leaving less coffee.  Or not cementing or resodding open half blocks. Well... and know you know!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD6qtc2_AQA
best episode ever, was too good.  you cant give this series up we love it
Awesome hilarious final episode. Love it!
This went worse than I was expecting somehow.
and everyone thought it was thick 44 who got kills
Season finale?
This is EXACTLY why Dora should be President of NEEBS GAMING!!! He made something beautiful but at the same time fucked up massively. Excellent episode, fantastic editing and a fitting way to finish the series. Can’t wait to see what you have planned for the future!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Season 2? Please
Lols, simon is like an egyptian pharaoh. \"I like to die with a lot of things.\"
Been here since the Birth of this beautiful Season and I am sad to see it go but I have a feeling something really cool will be replacing in somewhat soon and I can't wait....   To Adahop Good Job Editing this shitfest I loved it Thank you sir..   To the bag of dicks we know as Dora YOU HAD ONE FECKING JOB Love Ya..    To the beautiful bitches Neebs and Appsro You provided so many funny moments and made this Game fun to watch Thank you my FAV Neebs Gaming People.. To Simon Get Good.. To Thick You Did your best and we thank you...          To this Season you will be hard to replace and hopefully In the future we will see you again.
Thank you guys so much for this amazing series, I've enjoyed every single second of it, and I will watch it again as a whole soon! I'm curious what game will replace this gem! Again, thank you
So what's next?
I think Simon has the best dying noise out of anyone
Thick44 eliminated Thick44\nHe gets kills
I heard that Neebs, you bout said meschatic i stead of Schematic! Hahha long live our dyslexia but also nice save ;)
Season finale 😭 noooooooooo
Brilliant series guys, well done! Sad to see it go but glad I was here for the ride
Wow! I could not stop laughing! This was an amazing episode!!!
Holy hell fanfreakingtastic guys
This was by far the best episode you guys  done in days lol I could not stop laughing you guys are comic geniuses! Thanks for the great laughs.
That was one of the best ones. Great job guys
All I have is WOWWW, that was awesome!! :D
Simon is reenacting the million ways to die in the west.
Wait so is this the end of 7 days
Season finale? When does the next season begin?
Just a beautifully orchestrated  cluster fuck. A symphony of asses and elbows.
Its funny because you guys completely suck at the game regardless lol
neeb  gaming    team     change  Diffculty  settings warrior    64 Enemies        cheat          not happy  next    ark  survival  evolved   ?
Senseless SIMON...FUNNIEST FUCKING HORD NIGHT EVER.. NOT SEASON FINALE...FUCK THAT 6.5 DAYS TILL NEXT ONE..SOMEONE GET TO WORK.. I KNOW THAT IT WAS ADAHOP OR DORALOUS DUMB ASS WHO FUCK UP THE SETTINGS...BAWH HAHAHAH
Is there no more 7days ???
The editing is great sirs,better every ep.💪👌👍
No plan survives first contact with the enemy.
A great way to end it. I loved this series and will love it if it eventually returns. But till then I can’t wait to see what is next on the list for you guys.
Best hoard night ever!!!  Seriously could not stop laughing. Just wondering, did Simon died more from self inflicted or combat injuries?
Best Horde Night Ever!!!
😂😂😂 Best episode to date! Laughed so hard I started crying!
Wait?  So no more 7 days? : (
I loved the idea but did anyone else know the underground bunker was gonna end poorly?
That 1812 overture edit at the end was amazing.
comedy gold! ty for the entertainment
HAHAHA Dora's score should be -100 for building that death chamber. Awesome deaths guys. I couldn't stop laughing =D
\"I need my stuff!\" STOP RUNNING THROUGH THE BLADES! -Proceeds to run through the blades several more times
That was absolutely the funniest episode I've ever watched
I'm glad Simon finally got his torch!!
\"But I like to die with a lot of things...\" Awesome episode guys
that was the best worst plan that turned out better than anyone expected it too.
Sad to see this series go but at least it went with a bang
Congratulations on your 1,000,000
Masterpiece!!!
Jesus....
Yay!! A new 7 days video!! It’s the life blood that fuels ‘Merica!!!
Doraleous, you suck lmao
Just a tip:  Gather sand and rocks,  research cement making.  That plan would have gone off without a hitch with a quad pass choke point above the room.  To create this make a hole down.  On 4 sides create cement paths that are 3 blocks high, 2 blocks wide, 7 blocks long.  Have a space of  2 blocks open so zombies etc can go through 1 at a time.  Each block if I recall has 5k health and can withstand 3 explosions from the exploding police.   One thing you can do is modify this using blade traps to slow runners.   Mines around dirt etc is bad because it creates instability in your structure.  However,  if you have steel upgrades researched,  you can dig up 2 blocks deep,  replace ground with cement that upgrades to concrete that upgrades to steel which has 9k health and takes -25% reduced explosion damage.   Place mines at 4 block intervals and woila...you can sleep safely.  Keep in mind though, zombies during horde night Always target players no matter what you do.   So this trap idea is intended to be doje on all 4 sides of your location.  I hope this helps.
Loved the intro guys. I hope y'all do come back with more 7 days to die vids. As I said to Thick44 once \"I love everything you guys do and thank you for making my day several times a week.\" Music, vids, animated shorts YOU GUYS ROCK! Kisses
What does Thick44 and Jonny Sins have in common?.....Being bold and being a gamer...love you guys see you in Commenting on comments
Goodbye to one of my favorite series I’m gonna watch the whole season from start to finish right now just so I never forget and if it ever comes back I will watch it without fail! I love you guys in the respectful fan way !
Did anyone else pause it to try and see the face in the thermostat?
Empyrion next?
I will probably buy this game this week thanks to you guys
Easily my favorite series! Sad to see it go but hopefully it will be back soon! Also that was one of the best episodes of 7 days to die! Maybe always do the outtro of your song?
The ending is absolutely towards the end when you guys all just die it’s just priceless
It was a great series!
NOOOO DONT LET THIS SERIES END!!!
God dammit Dora You should have built the safe zone on the other side of the bunker then you should’ve blown up a big hole in front of the cabin and also she could’ve this goddamn holy fucki you should have built the safe zone on the other side of the bunker then you should’ve blown up a big hole in front of the cabin and also should have covered up those holes,You’re freaking lazy
OMG the begining
So what if you dig a cave that's square our octagonal with open sides going up to the surface with a square base like the one doraleous made and also possibly have some sort of sniper tower in the center. Thanks you guys see great
Such a great series and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed binging it (several times)! Thanks guys, for all the work you put into your channel
Shit finale? Cmon
Loved this series!!!
Followed this series from day 1. Don't normally like zombie games but as usual you guys make it a must watch. Will never forget when Simon fought off all those military zombies in that army base all on his own.
You should burn Doraleous on a wooden stake like in the Salem witch trials
It's Aliens, when they're waiting un the big hall and the Aliens come from the ceiling
This was epic!
I didn't think anything could top the bulletproof glass horde night plan, but this went several times worse than that. Made for one hilarious finale, and the death montage was perfect for this episode. Bummed the series is taking a break, as this is honestly my favorite show on the channel, but I suppose that'll make me all the happier when it returns. Can't complain about Frighty Night and whatever else is coming.\n\nAlso, I remember I wasn't too hot on Thick's 7 Days metal song, but after what happened in the episode and it being the season finale, it actually worked really well as a closer.
Absolutely flawless
IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful gents
It takes a hell of a lot of work to look this inept....thanks for the laughs.
talk about an epic finale
Epic
When the series first released, I was skeptical, but after watching the first few episodes, I realized you guys just shit out gold with everything you do.  Great run, hope future content will allow you guys to return to this. Appsro 4 president
11:32 Thick44 doesn't get kills, Adahop gets kills!
OKAY MAYBE NOT DORALEOUS FOR PRESIDENT
So many deads caused by Doraleous's hole.
Hell of an ending. Better that Lost
That was fan-f*cking-tastic.  I don't think I have laughed so much during one of your guys' videos as I did during the \"1812 Overture-Death-Montage\".  Well done.  Well, on the entertainment aspect.  Dora, an engineer you are not.  Don't quit your day job buddy. ;)
what song is played in the end?
This is a bittersweet moment for me. I’ve loved watching you guys play this game, but I guess it’s time to move on. I know we’re going to see some awesome things from Ark: Extinction and hopefully, Red Dead Redemption 2.
PLEASE DON'T BE THE END!!! Seriously yalls 7DTD series is my absolute FAVORITE thing to watch on... Hell, it's my favorite source of entertainment! I mean if yall need a break for a little bit you could always go back to Empyrion =) or something of that nature
Back when the first Neeb's episode of 7 days to die came out I loved the video series so much I immediately ran out and bought a copy of this game.  The makers of this game should sponsor Neeb's Gaming for that very reason.  Anyways, amazing video series but then again any game you guys play turns to gold.
Trying so hard not to laugh out loud at work. I am sad that it’s done.
What a stupid game...zombies home in on them from above and start tunnelling straight down? Motherfucker’s have ESP or what?
i hope they bring it back with a random Gen Map.\nThis was my 2nd favorite series, keep up with the amazing work.
So Thick'd is when you screw up, and Dora'd is when you FUCK up
I wished for the other series to be picked, but I was glad that 7 days to die was picked. I hope you guys do the other choices that was selected. I wish you guys re visit Minecraft
mistakes were made, MANY MANY HILARIOUS MISTAKES 😂🤣😂🤣👍
Yalls' best video ever by far!!
I’m really gonna miss this series! I still remember yalls first horse night at the prison and how amazing it was! And then how y’all made numerous bunkers within mountains or caves, not to mention the Mexican fort or the desert fort! I really hope y’all decide to do more of this series!
5:52 Did that explosion just uncovered a treasure chest?
NOOOOOO ITS OVEER!!!! NOOOOOOOOO *world population drops down to 0.1 *
1812 overture at the end, excellent
On horde night i should go underground
I honestly wasn't ready for this series to end.... Sad day. Question.  Will you guys be doing a Fallout 76 series or at least an episode? Please discuss on C.o.C. Thanks you guys are Awesome!
That. Was. Amazing!
The zombies had a better plan.
horde horde Horde HOrde HORde HORDe HORDE HORRDDEEE!
I kinda want this game, but it seems that a lot of people dislike it and so do some of the crew. Can someone tell me if it's worth it?
Poor simon... LMAO
Thick went out like John Wayne, taking a few of them down with him with that rocket blast. Slow salute to you sir. You and your squad will be remembered.
Jesus Christ simon you really are something else my man
Bro soda came out my nose
THIS. WAS. HILARIOUS
So sorry to see this series end. I loved it!  This episode was by far your best. Hope you do more seven days to die very soon.
Im so gutted its over, hope its only just for now!
That was a rough follow up from the scrap mechanic battleships episode Dora
I hope you will come back after  new updates  they doing  lots of news coming up
Fantastic series guys, I love the way the audio gets edited in every video! Can't wait to see what you guys come out with next!!
You guys once was at a place that had automatic rifle turrets. Why not just go inside there on hord night?
Hahahahahahhahaah. Epic failure.
For who ever edit this and may conserved, I’m sorry you had to edit that ether you hate you life with all the deaths or couldn’t stop laughing but in the end I thank you. P.S. Simeon you used more of the traps than the zombies ran into
As man I was really hoping for his bunker to work. It would have been awesome!
Great episode makes me sad it's the last episode... hopefully whatever u replace it with makes me super excited for Friday vids.. because Fridays were great bc u guys do such a great job with this game...so sad to see it go....
This is amazing work guys! Best 7 days video by far. Thank you so much for creating something that everyone loved. This was a great series and probably the highlight of my Fridays! I’m sure going to miss this series, but I’m sure you have something amazing to replace it! Love you guys, cheers!
Season 2
rofl literally cannot breathe.... yall r awesome hahaha that was great tyvm all of you
Simon says: \"Eh deh deh hee wah deh gah dah geh. dah.Urk.\"  And I quote.  LOL>. Solid finale guys, you really some fun ass dudes.  Keep it coming, and can't wait to see what comes next.
May I quote dora on this one \"this will be the easiest horde night so far.... or I'm building our grave\"
Bravo..... bravo!!!!!! I laughed so hard at this. You guys are awesome. Yet another great video
Freaking loved EVERY minute of it. At first I was thinking to myself ' How is Simon still alive and everyone else died...' then once he died I was like 'there we go' which made me chuckle at the thought of it until I saw thick hadn't died yet either.. Thank you Ada and the Neebs crew for making me laugh till I cough and cry. I will most definitely miss this series next week.
Quite possibly the most epic video you guys have done!
Not sure if you guys heard about telltale games closing.....I believe the new walking dead they are doing will be there last production. Not sure were that leaves 7 days to die but probably not in a good spot 😢
Now you guys can fill the hole with water and have an in-ground pool....
I hope y'all make a second season love watching y'all
Ada amazing cold open but I am a lil disappointed you didnt do a panning opening shot with the drone . Great stuff man !!!
WAIT IS 7 DAYS OVER
Nice try Dora
So this is it?
Take a lesson, Dexter, this is how you properly end a season.
Who is the genius that decided building a death hole was a great idea. Oh wait y'all been thicked by fukn Dora!! Lmfao. Great series hope revisit some day or highlights of failures and accomplishments.
Really enjoyed this series, guys. Thanks for all the laughs!
Wonder whats next for Friday series.
What a hilarious shit-show.
Am lost for words, what I just seen
5 seconds to die
Murphy's Law at its finest!  😂
Hey idiots. SEASON FINALE\n\n\nThe show isnt over. Stfu!
Delorean Score
This isn’t the end of a series right
:/ I hate when a series ends. Neebs nooo this Minecraft and gta have been my favorite series other then doraleous and associates.
Lol... I so called it last video.
14:30 -  \"FUCK  YOU  DOLARIUS\"  -  I burst  out  laughing.\nDOLARIUS ... YOU  GET  A  1  out  of  10.\nYou  get  a  1  for  Effort.   I would  have  given  you  a  4,  but  you  tried  to  cover  up  your  blunder.  The  hilarious  cursing  was  inevitable  -  lol
Awesome way to end the series! GREAT adventure start to finish....... That's said I think it's time to MAHA!!!\n\nMAKE ANOTHER HYPERION ADVENTURE!
I love using gas barrels to make an underground mine.
Thank you guts for an awesome series!
the zombies take the shortest path to the heat.
Never end this channel even when you are all in your 90s get together and keep this channel going
SIMONS SANDWICH COOKING SHOW!!!
Man, my heart sank a bit when I read the final message.  I was introduced to Neebs through the 7DTD developer diary back in February and became a HUGE fan... Helped me through some of the worst months of my life (3rd immediate family member passed away within a 6 year period). Ark, GTA5, Subnautica, Neebsilvania, Toonstone, live streams on Thursdays... Now the thing that brought me to Neebs Gaming has come to an end sniffles - It's all good, can't wait until the next venture!  You guys have a special talent and are great!!  A serious, THANK YOU for what you bring to your fans.  World Peace and kisses!
Hey is the map you guys have on google docs updated? \nplease let me know on commenting on comments it would make my month :D
This channel deserves so many more subscribers the amount of effort and how much they care for each video they put out should be getting millions of views each one
This might be my favorite 7 days video y’all have ever made
Thank god you are finally quitting this fucking game!  Please move on to conan exiles or something else... anything else.. thanks :)
Can’t wait for another season with a new map! This was my favorite series in a while now
I love the vigorous fingering of the thermostat 😂
Favorite episode yet! Amazing editing job ada!
This was the best horde night by far.. From the intro to the ending credits. To the bad ass 7 days to die song.. Love you guys.. The best yt entertainment..
Are you guys going to play MOD War Of The W 5.3        7 days die????????
Thank you all for your hard work. You went out strong, very funny episode!
out.... fucking.... standing.
Such a beautiful mess of a bunker that committed both big bunker sins. 1)don't assume earth will protect you in place of concrete/steel. and 2) zombies will go above where you are so you need to have the hole real close to where you're hiding. Excellent job all hope to see you back in this shitstorm eventually
another big part of this game is being raped! on the pvp servers as a group of noobs, might be fun to see gang join a pvp server.
Dora might have messed this up, but remember that time he built battleship in scrap ??
I hate the series is over, but it was amazing to watch. Keep up the good work fellas and lets start to see more GTA V episodes again.
Brilliant!!!
Who knew this horde night can start so boring and end with a death comp, great job Dora it went exactly how I thought. Love ya'll
did you guys know ada was screwing you over?
Simon just stay at the spoon next time
That death montage though... omg the lols ... My cats are freaking out at how loud I'm being. Best 7 days yet GJ Dora
That intro was great.
So sad to see 7days end. Was absolutely brilliant! Thanks guys you bossed that game
On 2nd viewing you can see the holes while Dora is making his announcements.
Thicke needs more character development. He seems to disappear and is very forgettable. Are you guys able to mention this in further discussion on the next commenting on comments please?
Are you guys gonna live stream alpha 17?
Oh My God!!! This episode was AMAZING Holy Shit! Funniest thing I have ever seen!
Can't wait to see what new series takes the place
Doraleous the king of really good ideas executed half assed and the baron of the not testing his shit. I love you guys
Ok guys! Best episode yet! Loved it! Yall are awesome, but I also gotta give props to your editing master, well done sir!
🤣🤣🤣 hilarious deathtrap
At first I wasn't into this series but not after a long time I got to love it. It's soo sad that it ended but non the less a great finale!\n\nPs: Please comeback to this game someday
So is this the end of 7 days for good? It definitely when out on a strong but disastrous note
You f*cked this up beautyfully! Fun to watch!
This.... this is great. As a member of the NYPD. This is literally the best thing I seen all day. Made this day the best. thank you so much for this.
You know guys, you could find someone who is actually competent to tell jokes if that's why you're keeping Simon around.
End of 7 days?!?!
15:20\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\nSimon died\n\n.. just another day on Neebs gaming
Please start the new season soon! Love you guys!
\"Fantastic failure\", thx for the laughs
Appsro bringing the HEEAAAT
I have to say this wos the most fannyes, best, survaiving episode of 7 days to day and the end with the song wos fantastik i fit the game perfectly.greate job gays
Does Simon think it's called \"bob wire\"?
What's the opposite of a fort again?.. hemmmm Dora.. humm  p.s I've never in any other video, laughed more than this one. And I've watched every single one I swear to God... every one 10/10
I am really gonna miss this series!! I loved watching you all argue and mess around. Every horde night is funnier than the last!! Love all the edits and find-adahops. Even funnier is simon trying to do simple things. Dora is the Brains that over does everything. Thick is just mr. Badass. Needs is trying to keep the culture alive with his poetry. And apstro is that one survivor guy that just knows how to work with what hes got. LOVE YOU GUYS
7 dies to die and ark are your best 2 playlists  please dont stop 7dtd  its one of the best YT playlists ever!!!
Best line ever \"I like to die with a lot of things\"
Oh man. This was the first series that I watched. This series got me  hooked on the channel, I can’t wait to see what’s next.
did dora put shotgun bullets into the turrets
R.I.P. !
This is why I fuckin love watching u guys😂😂😂😂
Neebs keep this going I love this series
watching you guys die over and over again brings me such joy. good job doraleous.
This episode was like a really bad smell  that I just could not  stop sniffing!!! Great work
NO, Please dont let this series end! Its way better than ARK and GTA.\nFor the love of god, keep it going :'(
Man absolutely a great series!  I'm going to miss it alot.  Usually put these series on to fall asleep.  It's been a great run guys!  The Dora tomb did not disappoint.
Goodby 7 deys to day. We will mis you.
Guys for a new series could you play don't starve togeather
This is quite possibly the funniest epic fail I have ever seen on any seven days to die video ever.
So is 7 days really over.. I would think you guys would have done like ank ending saying goodbye to all you're past houses and forts however in ark there was a success ... aka killing manticore
Ima miss this show for sure
When are you beginning on \nbff's bf v
Finally joining the men? You are almost playing 7DTD on manly settings. You girls!
Best hoard night ever!!!
One of my favorite series on this channel sad to see it end but I'm sure something will replace it and it will be just as awesome
I expected no less. Everything Doraleous touches is gold. Thus the Doraleous standard.
1st scene adajop gets tired of editing... so he decides to end the series then and there...
I'm absolutely not surprised by any of this.
Doraleous you doomed us all, you doomed us all Doraleous. -Appsro     Best line ever and moral of today's episode.  Can't wait to see what else you guys have planned and also please do a series for Don't Starve Together
Thanks for another great series boys. Looking forward to not only what you replace this with, but maybe, seeing it again after a few game updates. Cheers!!
What kind of break from 7 days are we talking about? Like a break where it comes back after a few weeks and all is good? Or the kinda break where she runs off with your cousin and you don’t hear from her again until you get papers in the mail 3 months later filling for divorce?
23:58 why does simon walk off if dora has most deaths?🤔
Guys this was one of the funniest playthoughs ever thank you
When this game was chosen to be the next series, I wasn't overjoyed by the idea, but still watched as it was you guys. This ended up being by far my favourite thing you guys have ever created.\nThe editing, the music, the thumbnails, the little stories you all told, everything has been fantastic.\nAbsolutely gutted that the series has came to an end... Temporarily I hope. But I know that whatever you guys put out next will also be a masterpiece.\nYou truly are the best YouTube channel out there.\nKeep up the fantastic work, and thank you for everything you do.
Good job not fixing the holes Doraleous
Woah i should’ve got my peanuts for this episode
But if this is the end what will i watch Fridays. What next no more ark on Saturdays I’m only now just getting over conquest and kittens and you pull a stunt like this its too much guys 💔
I am both insanely sad to see this laid to rest, and excited for whatever is coming next. This is definitely one of my favorite things to binge over and over again. All your videos bring me joy. You guys are the best
That failed just as horribly as i hoped
Way to end the journey Doraleous, without a hitch
Here's hoping the next alpha drops soon, so we can have more of the wonderful mayhem of Neebs and Friends versus the endless hordes!
Damn... getting thick'd does seem so bad now. Great series I enjoyed watching every week!!!
This was great loved it. The whole series, you guys made 7 days to die fun for me a console player who doesn’t have nearly as much stuff as pc. Great series much love! Hope to see you return to it in a year  or so
Lmao keep up the great work guys really really love what y'all do thanks guys
What does season finale really mean though guys? No more at all? Few weeks off? Different game each Friday?
Holy shit, what a way to end things. Gotta be honest, seeing all of this last week, I figured it would be a walk in the park. Never figured things would go so horrifically awry
2:11 So true ; so true
I loved the series im sad to see it go.
This...was...awesome
Wow. What a monumental fuck up. Absolutely brilliant to watch. Hope you go back to it in the future.
Sad to see this series end... But I think it's a good way to end, it just all went to shit. lol I do hope you guys return to 7 Days one day, cos it's nice seeing you guys all together and just having a good ass time (as Appsro would say :) Can't wait to see what series you guys bring next, I'm sure we'll all love it and I tip my hat to Adahop for all his hard work editing this series, it's been fantastic! love to all of you!
Wait when's the next series?
Thank you Adahop! AS much as I love my boys, this was hilarious and well worth the entertainment! Also DAMNIT DORALINGOUS!!! NEVER LEAVE ANY POTINTIAL PROBLEMS FOR SUCH INCEDENTS! \nLove you guys (account jacked by Cathleen)
Love Thick44's outro song. Awesome!
You replyin everyone today?
OMG that had me in tears I love your series so much the Simon death close up was classic. Keep it up guys!
\"Without a hitch\" - Dora, describing his death tomb.
What will you guys be playing in the near future, loved this 7 days to die stuff completely, helped me get through hard times an it’s just sad seeing it all go away
#Breadstrong
That was better than watching Picasso paint!! Art in its highest form, bravo gentlemen!!!
yup... I was right... you're ALL the dumb one.
The best episode bar none. ( Warrior with 64 genius ! )
Simons death sounds are the fucking best
Is this because alpha 17 is close to releasing?
Taxi driver out of town on a 6 hour wait. Thanks y'all for all the hilarities, the Deaths and the epic content. Well except when Simon dies like always. In all seriousness y'all are a great team and fun to watch.
I laughed more at this video then I can remember any other video from you guys. Amazing job. Doraleous for President of Neebs Gaming!
This series better come back
Great finale!  Sad to see it end but I'm looking forward to the new content that's surely to take it's place.  (D&A?)
Freaking best one in a long time. That sh*t had me dying too!
For a complete cluster fuck   It was amazing!
Awesome ending, good job guys
Somehow I knew this wouldn't work.
Thick's Seven Days To Die song should be the outro for all the 7 Days To Die gameplays.
To say I laughed so hard I shit myself is an understatement. Well done Dora.
This is why I dont prepare. Also, why the hell can these zombies dig through rock? I dont think Ive ever seen zombies do that before in an IP
Ada you are one great creator. Thanks for the awesome episodes
So.. many... death noises...
Doraleous,  great plan and horde preparation, but poorly executed.   Otherwise great entertainment.
Most people under pressure produce something 'good enough'. Adahop not only pops out a freaking diamond, but he continually pushes himself and those around him to a new level every time. And honestly it's because he cares so much about our community. I am so proud of this series and this episode, I can't wait to see what comes next. Wawdee!
Noooo I wanted more 7 days to die vidz from you all... it is a great series to watch.. Thanks for the entertainment guys really love it.. Thank you
This ended too fast
What a great ending to this series. Freaking amazing guys.
Best episode yet. I hope you guys keep making 7 days vids.
GREAT song at the end boys! Loved it
Will this huge hole in the ceiling make us all die? Nah, it's fine. Just hide it with one block and nobody will see.
Probably one if the best videos this year. But definitely y'alls. This was freaking hilarious!!! Love you guys
NEEBS GAMING ROCKS!! Always a good job and never a bad!
Inspired! Never... has it taken so much energy... to fail, so spectacularly hard... Genius! Worked as intended eh Dora... ;)  10/10       'thank you & kisses'
Nooooooo
that was awesome dora dont quit your day job
So is this the end until alpha 17?
Simply amazing 😂😂😂 \n\n\"SIMON!\" 😂😂😂
I loved watching your guys series on this every Friday evening after a long day I’ve watched every single episode at least twice and now that it’s over I hope you guys find an even better game to play in place of this but I feel like there will always still be a gap where this game used to be loved watching it you guys are amazing
And the song at the end who made that did you guys. Cuz I like it. it's really good.
seen you guys die so many times it's the most funniest thing I have ever seen in my wife
I'd give Simon a solid \"Sham Sandwich/10\" in the finale
Oh my GAWD what a wild ride that was. Twas the greatest 7 days video ever.i dont know how yall are gonna top this one.
EPIC truely awesome sooooooo funny :)
I totally forgot doraliusesessisses rape dungeon reveal from last video. So hyped for this video.
Epic!!!ALL BECAME SIMON AND SIMON BECAME LEGEND IN HIS CATEGORY!
Journeys End indeed and a marvelous one at that, thanks for the laughs in this Series.
Dora you have fail harder then Simon ever has
Love the outro! The full 7dtd song \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krgDoMQtuCk
BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i loved the death montage.I laughed so hard i probalbly pissed myself. I cant tell, still dieng of laughter. Thanks for this epic, most eventful 7 Days to Die video EVER.
So what now boys?
I have not laughed so hard in a long time. That was the best episode I’ve ever watched!! I’m having a shit time atm I really needed this, thanks guys, awesome.
A fantastic failure, hit the nail on the head lmao
EPIC!!!! but now im sad bc its over lol. Whats next? 😊
Absolutely fantastic, amazing job Doraleous and great season finale Neebs Gaming!
Well, one day you can all look back and see that this debacle made you stronger... Actually, scratch that, I've watched enough of your videos to realize you've learned nothing :D
How can you guys ended on that. are you guys going to bring back the series on a different map. if not then this was an amazing series.
Dude I loved it. One of the funniest and best episodes. I needed a good laugh & again Neebs Gaming delivered. Semper Fi Doraleous.
And what a glorious season it has been! Can't wait for season 2 you guys!
Oh man I hope this isn't the last of the 7 days but def a great episode to go out on
This better not be the end of 7 days to die! Seriously won't be happy. It's my Thursday treat!!
Superb bloody editing this episode. I mean, all of the episodes have impeccable editing, but this one, this one is absolutely bloody brilliant. Well done.\n\nBut make a Simon Makes Sandwich’s series a thing :)
what is the music at 11:13 ?
What a disaster. Great episode
Fantastic!
loved the intro and the music!!!
what a great massacre, bravo
The Neebs Gaming crew's biggest enemy: Game Lag
Well if this is the finale then hopefully you guys revisit empyrion. Its about time it makes a channel comeback.
next time let needs do it  and doraleous i am truely your plan didn't work
Hate to see this end such a great series! Can't wait to see what you all get in to next
Best horde night EVER!! could not stop laughing during the death montage 😂😂😂 unlucky dora was a cool idea but what an epic fail. Still got to be one of my favourite episodes lol.
Spectacular ending, guys!! Thanks for the laughs and tips for how to better survive this game myself. Love ya’ll and hope to revisit 7dtd again someday. Now go on git!
Well what can i say? That was brilliantly terrible, and i had such high hopes for doraleous's plan. What a great episode to end on though, here's to hoping you guys come back to this one day.
Well now I am sad that the Season is over :-( now I have nothing to watch.
Guys 3 weeks till ark extinction. Y'all might want to shift into overdrive if you want to beat ragnarok on time for extinction. I don't think wyverns can enter the boss arena so you are probably gonna need a lot of rexes/spinos and heal hogs and yutyrannus.
Frighty Night next week!!!
I had the most unique laughter I've had in a long time!  I've been following this series, saw the youtube notification, and definitely underestimated this!  I was wheezing with laughter at the end, thank you for everything that you do!  It makes my day, love you guys, the best OC out there!!  KEEP IT COMING NEEBS!!!    BATTTLEEEEFIEEELLLLDDDDD!!!!!!!
BEST FUCKING VID EVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is that song in the beginning? Can someone let me know?
i would have liked to see this horde night when the base actually worked correctly
This is one of the best episode ever.\n\nPlus Thick rock song in the end is the best song ever
I thought it was just ark but neebs' 7 days character also ended up looking like some sort of green hipster
Thick, your singing is terrible. FUCKING terrible.
It wasn't the holes in the ground that they went for, the AI will go right for you no matter what. Heat doesn't draw them, light doesn't draw them, YOU draw them. Even if you are at the deepest point you can go in game they will just keep digging right over your head to get to you. A deep pit with a mini base over it is the best kind of horde night trick you can do, the zombles with run into the hole trying to get to you and then you can just chuck TNT down the hole.
100 percent best episode everrrrrr loved the chaos hahaha
I havent watched yet but i feel like this is gonna be a good horde, ill bet the tunnel collapses
Best opening Montage ever
By Far the Funniest 7 Days to die episode EVER!! As I'm sitting at my desk at work trying not to let everyone hear me !! Can't wait till you start it back up again.
Or will his shoddy workmanship be their downfall.... Downfall! I didnt put 2 and 2 together, lol
Best episode of anything. Ever.
\"brain him\" proceeds to shoot directly into his anus
Best one yet.
Insert roblox \"oof\" sound for every deaths you guys had.
Love how Doraleous saw the hole... what could go wrong Dora said to him self its gonna be great.
keep it going its one of the best on the channal
Wait August 19th that's my birthday.
And THIS, gentlemen, is why we build from the bottom up when building underground. Next time you have a bunker, layer the top of your ceiling (which needs to be several blocks deep anyway) with spikes, traps, and turrets. Zombies can dig, guys. Cover the top (ground) level with dirt so you don't injure yourself. Vertical defense is key, as I think you've figured out. Also, the zombies are attracted to meat, including you. You can use raw meat in a container (like a chest, for example) to bait them into traps. Light weakens them, so make sure the area is well lit. Above all else, HAVE AN ESCAPE PLAN. All that said, the video was very entertaining, thank you for all the work these take to make. I'm an Ark player mainly (I run an unofficial cluster, hit me up if you'd like to come check it out), but I've dabbled a bit with 7 days, and I feel your pain. This was almost as bad of an idea as the Alpha Carno incident, and that's hilarious.
Awww.. noooo! I love the series, don't let it end guys!  \nBeen looking forward to every episode, gonnna miss it! :'(
Awesome...Thank you so very much for so many hours laughing.\n\nYou guys are my heros and one of the reasons Why I fell in love with the United States.\n\nThank you...and please stay the same...ever and ever\n\nPS Doraleus...great work
Will you do a survey on wich game you guys should play next or have you already decided?\nAlso this as an amazing ending to a great series, I especially liked that you chose “Journeys End” to be your journeys end.\n\nLove and Kisses from austria, keep it up!
Great series guys, and well wrapped up
funniest one so far lmfao
its my favorite series... TwT
Omg doralious
Even finish watching it yet and doraleous so far has built the best hord night shelter
I seeee a torch do you seeee a torch?
i like the last song
Say it isn't so? Loved this. Hope to see more of 7D2D
the best video EVER!!!
Doralingus, you have truly outdone yourself. The amount of time that you put into this beautiful masterpiece of a failure is absolutely amazing. I am blessed to be able to see the whole team fall apart. Especially Simon who couldn't seem to know which direction was up. Bravo team.
Best episode yet😂 the music, death noises, needs/Simon spirits. Fucking GREAT Bois.
Nice job with the editing Anthony!
Needs spirit
best hoarde night yet!
Awesome.. haha. that shit was great! .... 18 deaths.. hahaha Simon
Please keep playing this and if you replace it replace it with EMPRION I really enjoyed the 4 episodes you made on but I would still prefer seven days to die but I can understand you’ve probably got bored of seven days
Good job
I love this series! I didn't expect that many deaths lol looking forward to seeing what you guys do for Frighty Nights and hope we get more 7DtD eventually.
Hahaha that was the best episode ever. Dont know who was killed more often , you guys or the zombies ;) .
Please keep making 7 days to die videos...  Lol
lol, this turned into your 7 Days Overlook Hotel hahaha. Dora should have known by now that the Z's always b-line to the players, the hole was never gonna work lol. Always great to have a morning episode, gets me in a good mood before I head to work. Can't wait for some new episodes already, awesome job as always guys!
Loved the show but very sad it’s over. What will it be replaced by?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh, Doraleous. The best of intentions.
A part of me feels bad for Doraleous since he put so much time and effort into it, but at the same time that was the most hilarious failure I've ever seen in my entire life. Literally could not stop laughing after the point where they burrow through the ceiling. My cheeks hurt so bad from smiling and laughing so hard for what felt like a never ending cycle of worst-case-scenarios one right after the next. Sad to see that it's coming to a hold/end but I eagerly look forward to more content like this. Well done boys, especially to Anthony and Adahop for adding so much flare and dramatic elements throughout the series, and also a big double thumbs up to Simon for sticking with it after going through so much shit and making me laugh my ass off the most. Great work guys!
You guys are awesome and you are my favorite youtubers
So this is finished yet scrap mechanic gets allowed to limp along like a puppy with Lupus?
I love how Doraleous just decided not to fix the holes in the cave above his platform 😂 he has single handedly doomed this hord night toooo funny 😆 😘( kick ass 7days to die song )
Poor Dora it's like herding fucking chickens lol
Will there be a season 2??
Haha absolutely love the orcasta music at the beginning
Wow, just wow
I shit myself laughing seriously!!!
the traps killed more simons than zombies
Sad to see this season end. But Hopefully we'll see a a new season when A17 drops...
I loved this series ty so much for making it. Sad to see it end.
I regret clicking the like button near the beginning of the video, because I got to the end and wanted to like the video, but it was already done.
Sad to see it go.
I have never laughed so much in my freaking life, omg this was just absolutely fantastic in every way!!!
Hey guys , thank you for all the episodes you did , 7 days is one of my favourite series on your channel, and I enjoyed every single episode, I sincerely hope that you will return when a17 releases , it looks like a new game , thank you for making an amazing series , and I hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did , also do you plan on playing another survival game that will replace 7 days for the time being ? This is getting too long so , ill cut it here.
I cried a little bit at the end. Working on some sounds until you come back next season. PANG.....WOO-BAP!!!.....TING!
Awe man. I stopped watching ark and seven days, bc i got so damn busy for these last couple weeks,  but I suppose that i can binge all these new episodes I've been missing.  \n\n\nstill. this was one of my most favorite series so far!
does this mean no more seven day's to die :(
So what's the new Friday night regular gonna be?
Glorious, just glorious.
I love your videos been watching for years now, always gives me something to sit down and enjoy toughly. Thanks Neebs Gaming Crew, any idea on what we can expect to see take this spot if 7 days to die is over?
Dora, you of all people should know it’s actually DuckDuckGrayDuck, but, i still love you.
Thank you. This has really helped me get through a lot of stuff. Can’t wait to see what’s next
Simon...you kill me bro...😆😆🤣🤣😂😂
Read this in next commenting on comments, This is without doubt the best series i have ever seen and i always looked forward for more please dont end it... cant you start again and do random generated world?  I love you guys vids and its honestly kind of sad to see this series end, it feels empty. Keep up all good work though❤ im in tears.. and whats the most motivating thing for you guys in Youtube?
One word!!! Pure
I don't own 7 days to die...I've never played it, but I've watched every episode you've put out...ever...but I would run out today and grab a copy just to jam with you guys. This is the funniest shit ever.
How to end a series in a nutshell
Read the title and screamed NOOOOOO
Super awesome ending to a terrific season! Appreciate you gentlemen and thanks!
NOOOO, not my second favorite series after ARK. But like for real now can y’all bring back some old series like top 20 plays? Plzzzzzz
Wait this is the end!\n\nNooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!
This is a masterpiece, a FUCKING MASTERPIECE. You guys did a textbook season finale, couldn't do it anyway better. God! I have not laughed that much for a while!
What a fun ride. Thanks for the laughs!!!
Best hord night ever
I just wanted to give a big THANK YOU to all of you at Neebs Gaming. This series has been so fun to watch and has made a place in our home. As I spent the next hour being saddened by this news, it also made me realize just how great this show has been. Like any good tv show, the finale is depressing. Its like moving away from a loved one or saying goodbye to a friend. Can’t wait to see what you guys bring to the table next. Again, thank you!
The epicness just cannot be contained., Thank you guys so much.
Damn, what an ending. Who was duckduckgoose?
I knew this was gonna fail miserably. At least it was funny.
Season Finale, it was a good run folks, but we still got ARK so we good!
GG Dora
For a potato quality game you guys sure do make it interesting and funny as hell. Thanks so much for all that you all do, it always puts a smile on my face. Can't wait to see what's in the works next.
Please come back
Get harpoons on ragnorock
Sooooo I would like to put “ Thicked” to bed. But don’t feel bad caused being “Doraed” is replacing it.
thankyou for an awesome go at a game you originally had no hope for at all.  hopefully we will see you all back whenever alpha 17 comes out. alot of changes, and i can see neebs going nuts over the new motorcycle.  but what next?!
Man. I was looking forward to Simon's horde night :/
Beautifully done, boys! Beautifully done!\nLove you all so much-thank you for all your hard work and efforts, it's much appreciated!!!!
As on old friend of mine, who was quite a zombie slayer in his day, once said, \"first to aid; last to die. \"
What am I supposed to watch now  Netflix pfft
Haha! Fuck yes Dora! Have never laughed so hard seeing this go so horribly F.U.B.A.R. Great job guys keep up the great fucking work!
Thank you so much guys, I'm a firemen and love watching you guys in my free time at the station. You all make me laugh and relax. 7 days to die was amazing. Thank you again!
That went bad. Real quick. Lmao shitty its the finale though.
Would love to see a SIMON mini series of the house cleaner/repair man
Best Horde night so far you guys are great
The Home Alone theme at the beginning... proves that this channel is the best!
19:39 and all death sounds IM DEAD💀💀💀😂😂😂#breadstrong
Seriously tho. Is bf friends ever coming back?....
If only the walking dead would end in such an epic fail!
As a 7DTD player, that intro got me hyped!
I hate if this is truly the end but if so hell of a way to go out Ilook forward to the next series p.s. I hope you guys have something special for Halloween
and thus a season of 7 Days to Die has ended, the mystery man who thus made the ultimate bunker into a literal death hole may never be known, CURSE YOU MYSTERY MAN!
Did Thick spill his 🍺!? 😨😆
I cannot tell you guys how much I love the channel. I came to youtube looking for Ark playthroughs and found the Neebs Gaming Ark series. Since then,  I was blown away by the work and effort you put into each of your series. You made 7 days a joy to watch and I loved every moment! I do not regret subscribing!!
nice of you putting my favorite song in at the end (edit) thanks for the likes
Thank you guys so much for this game series! You did the best 7 Days to Die game series and this was an awesome journey! We love you guys!
Plz do more 7 days to die plz
Oh my God that number of deaths. This has got to be the worst/best horde night yet. Props to Ada for messing with the settings LMAO. It's a little sad to see the series go (for now? wink wink nudge nudge) but I do agree with some of the comments here, at some point it gets very repetitive and the grind for resources will eventually wear you down so it was bound to go at some point.
Even tho chaos is the norm for you guys.\nThis caught me by surprise, now my eyes are leaking and my throat hurts from laughing so much.\n\nFlu + neebs gaming is a lethal mix
What a epic finale!
Best episode ever :)
Walked into my room turned my iPod on, it went to this video instantly. Even my iPod is a huge fan
This was awesome. We all knew something like this had a high probability of happening. \n1812 overture!!
darlous did great, if only he had a team to help him
Great intro to this episode! And that revelation from 4 days earlier... Bravo Sir!!!
And also can u tame a titanboa in ark
Y'all have no idea how sad I am that this series is ending. It was my absolute favorite thing to watch on YouTube. Thank you all, especially Simon, because he is the most like me, in the sense of dying at every possible point.
That was quite an impressively built tomb Doran-Doran. Best horse night ending y'all could've possibly had.
I wonder what simons score is gona be this time
This was fanfuckingtastic! Thank you Doralingus for this amazing failure fort! XD
Don’t end it all plz
The music on the background makes it all so much more amazing,  who agrees
Would love to see Appsro play We Happy Few as a series like he played subnautica. You guys are great and keep up the fantastic work.\n\nP.S will we see any new battlefield friends or battlefield top plays from battlefield 5?
Slow clap as the comment section builds to a roaring applause. You guys are my favorite content creators even though I never seem to get on Commenting on Comments I leave comments from time to time anyways. Just got to say this series was a fine work of art. I always enjoy the series with all of you in them I think its what makes a lot of your content popular. What ever replaces this series needs to maintain that thread of the team together against something. Thanks for the free laughs.
What is going to replace 7d2d?
Intro: Gold Youtube thing. Second phase: Anthony's chubby FINGER! 3rd phase: An enoying voice coming out neebs vocal cords
AMAZING use of the 1812 Overture.
Simon rating 11
So are y'all halting production of this for now because the next update is coming out shortly?
The season ended because of Ada not because of Dora's death trap
Very Funny Episode. Loved the series guys Thanks.
Who's DuckduckGoose? \nThat dora \"sniper vision\" wasn't on his camera I think
Please do it again or something, just like ARK en Raft
All these death noises. 😂
What a show! incredible!
That was so epic, great editing, the death montage was hilarious.  Hope you guys start up again with alpha 17, I look forward to my Friday work distraction that is this series.
That beginning thou. Ada you creative bastard
Is it really the end? I liked this series...! Besides ark
Wait was that really the end!!! No!!!! So sad
i hate you guys now like really ending the show dafuq?
I cant believe its all over😭
The 11 assholes who disliked y'all can suck a dick 9:01 am 10/19/2018 Pacific time.
you guys got Dora’d
Sure did come a long way, from the Police Department of day 1, seriously was a lot of laughter and a lot of gripe, But lets put it to a vote, Should there Be a Season 2 or should we let them stay buried.\nThank you Neebs for being there, Simon, your great man, Just take your time and don't rush in. Dora, Chin up you may get another chance to Prove your self, Don't screw it up. Thick, Best I have seen you perform since day one, Appsro, if i need a friend in the Apocalypse I would be Honored to be shot by you.\n\nAs a company of men just trying to survive I wish to count My self among you.
god dammit this vid is nothing but a 20min laugh track at my house
Epic end to the journey.
The zombies just completely flipped those defences. \n\" WE'RE NOT TRAPPED IN HERE WITH YOU! YOU'RE TRAPPED IN HERE WITH US!\"
Best episode hands down
This was a great series and I hope you come back to it.
Sad to the series end. It will be missed.
INCREDIBLE INTRO! WELL DONE ADAHOP!
👏👏👏👏👏👏 WOOOOO!
When will the season be back???
Soo does that mean it's the final episode or your just doing seasons for it now
Here's to hoping the new series will either be The Forest or Conan Exiles.
Uhhhh.\n\nWhoah boy.\n\nAfter canyon horde, it should have become an accepted fact that zombies can dig. \n\nFast. \n\nSo, if one is underground on horde night, and starts to see debris falling from directly above, one would be well advised to prepare for a zombie to drop on one’s head. \n\nAs for the title card at the very end: YOU BETTER. \n\nWhat game is next, fellows?
I would've loved to seen how it was suppose to work
I kind of thought this would happen lol they always know exactly where you are on horde night heat Dosent matter then. This might work against a horde on any day that isent horde night. I feel bad for doraleous.. all that work for nothing lol
Can't wait for Simon's Horde Night!
The death noises🤣🤣
Loved this episode
Is it even possible to wipe in this game or do you just keep respawning?
Hahahahha 🤣🤣🤣 this was absolutely fantastic lol but finale 😭😪😭😪😭 noooooooo god why? Lol I love these video
I cant believe Anthony did that to you guys!
Hahhaaaa I spilled coffee everywhere and almost passed out from laughing. Superb disaster 😂😂😍
Thanks to the whole group for the entertaining 7 days videos. Hopefully you all return to the series soon. It's my favorite of all your series.
To be fair you cant really blame doraleous for this game's bullshit
SEASON 2!
17 seconds in.. \"is this...the first FRIGHTY nights!??\" Its 12am...\n\n(9:47) Damn, well you tried Dora.\n\nSo is that the end of this series?
Now that's what I call a finale
Thank you guys! That was the best content from 7 days to die! i was laaughing my ass off the whole time!!!
The Doraleous laugh gets me every time..too contagious...lol
So the finale was a glorious shitfest because Doraleous didn't bother to try fixing a hole, now if that isn't the spirit of this series, I dunno what is
There was show one liners that will make me look laugh for some time you guys will have a hard time topping this finle but if mean no more 7 days then I will hold my breath tell there a new one
Crying at simon.  Finally getting out, getting chopped, then land mines.  HAHA  One of the best videos yet!!!!!
That was amazing. I think Dora should head up all the horde night builds.
I honestly haven't laughed this hard in months, this was an absolutely amazing season finale. Please revisit the game when Alpha 17 drops, it's the best series of yours imo.
that was impressive. I felt like I was at the movies.
Brilliant series. Replace it with Simon Does Sandwiches please.
Adored this series! Can't wait for the next one! :D
One of the best damn episodes y’all made , you guys had me laughing keep them coming. We need longer episodes for Ark and 7 days
This was probably the funniest way to end this series lol 😂
Doraleous thanks for making this such a legendary fail! Only you guys can psyche something up so damn well and then have it all crumble around you in moments. Literally. Y'all are the best.\n\nI found your channel through 7 Days to Die. My partner and I were on Day 250 or so and we were looking up some videos on farming and bases to help make our builds better. Somehow you came up--and I'm so glad you did! We've been addicted to your channel ever since, and are now trying to make my way through the Ark game thanks to that series. \n\nI'm really excited to see what comes next. Thanks for entertaining!
THAT WAS AMAZIMG HAHAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAAA epic video couldn't stop laughing so good
This was an amazing series
Will there be another poll for the next series
That was epic
please dont end 7 days to die it is the most funny and insteresting gameplay in your channel and I like it very much
Well is over now what
I’m gana miss Simon getting destroyed by everything in 7day to die
Greatest episode ever! Are you guys picking up again for 17? Soonish?
Are you guys going to make ark aberration series please do
that death montage!
Thank you guys for such an amazing series :-) cant wait to see what y'all play next
Well do Random gen and put it up 5 so you can explore more.
Im sorry but this bass idea was stupid AF. Yall should know by now the zombies take the most direct route possible. As shown in your desert base when the majority of the horde tried to come directly at you from the other side... you know.. the gorge.. You should have been able to figure out they were going to dig strait down onto you.
I’m sad the series is ending but I can’t wait to see what takes its place
Honestly who dislikes these videos? You need to grow the fuck up and troll your own life these guys rule
By far, the best episode yet! I couldn't stop laughing! What a way to end the season. I am sad to see it end, but I look forward to whatever you guys have planned next! Maybe give The Forest a shot?
Fantastic series. Loved it. The horde nights were mixed, varied and creative. Look forward to see what you guys do next
Sad to see this series coming to an \"end\". Had the greatest time watching it, comes in at second place in my fave series, after Ark. Btw nice plot Dora, couldn't have asked for a better ending than a deathhole and faulty ceilings LOL
I have been so excited for this video that I ALMOST feel ashamed.
:`^)
Fucking gold.
Hold up, can we talk about how amazing that outtro is? Like dayum!!!!!!!
This was way better than the walking dead
That is some Deathstar level design flaws. Good Job.
Doraleous YOU HAD ONE JOB!  \n\n\nWill we see 7 Days again? 😢
I was anticipating a perfect horde night... and I guess it was! perfect finale...great laughs! I recognize feeling safe while digging my own grave in this game. respect for ending  the series at it's zenith point. You squeezed all the fun out of this game and I will follow you into the next adventure!
Don't feel to bad Dorra.   I spent a month building an underground base  just to have a bug in the game fill it all in and wipe out all my stuff.  I play on console and we have never got any love from the devs of this bug ridden game.  No up dates no patches no fixes.  Just empty promises.  I'm glad telltale is gone they made a ton of half finished games took a shit ton of money from fans that believed in them and just shit all over them.    I will miss this show.  Can't wait to see what is next.  😁
Ha RIP Simon. The end of this series has me thinking RDR2 will take up this slot :)
Please have season 2 of this series 😁
This was fucking great! Might of been the worst day for you in the game but it was definitely one of the best for me!!
Great stuff guys keep it up.
Who is champ wild?
Saw the comment from Adahop, I think you guys are misunderstanding him it's not a new season but a new series...\nNeebs gaming crew please keep playing this game, there's other days of the week and no offence to scrap fans but I'm sure many of us would prefer this over that. You only played seven hordes cmon this game is a playground for your type of content.
What about the next season though?
Plz replace with gta or subnautica
Plz don't end this series
No more 7 days to die .......  not cool at all guys
What a massacre😂😂
THANK YOU!!! Seriously.  I'm a 911 dispatch supervisor and it can get a little stressful at times.  On my breaks, I'll hide outside and watch you guys. 7 Days is my favorite but any one will do the job. Thank you for helping me though the hard days like today.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHY WHY IS THIS THE END!??! (by the way i was dissapointed in Doraleouses build, i really wanted it to work it would of been amazing) A+ on Effort but it's a Mega F for performance
Dat ingame lag
they should've given the RPG to neebs cuz he's an RPG genius
\"I could kill them right now\" \"That doesn't make sense, let the environment do it\" best lines ever!
NOOOOOO! I love this series
This channel and community is AWESOME!!! And it keeps getting better and BETTER! Been following since yall were at 10k!!!
So that's what catastrophic failure looks like!
So I have a lot of down time at my job, and nothing fills the void of boredom like watching Simon play video games in an incredibly novice way. Thank you fuzzy little man peach for doing your best
Fantastic end to the season.
On the one hand, this was a great way to spend some time before having to go to work! On the other hand, this might have been an accurate representation of the day I'm GOING to have at work.
thick is a real surviver
Fucking Simon makes neebs gaming lmfao! I guess all of you do 😝
This can not be the end, I look forward to seeing these.   Every thought about doing a fallout 76 season that would be awsome.
Still pretty pissed yous guys never filled the lighthouse moat
Time for deep rock galactic now or what? Been waiting for it for months!
Fucking epic.  Doraleous is the only one who can turn a complete and utter failure into the most entertaining episode of the series.  That was the greatest shitshow ever, Devil Dog.
Noooooooo
You'd think a season finale would be a bit longer.... ;)
Doraleous should have completely encased the room. It at least would have delayed the horde
Nice season finale.\n\nA couple of bugout boxes around the sides with spare guns & ammo might have helped.\n\nNice of Simon to keep testing the spinning blades to ensure they were constantly working.
Definitely haunted..
Fantastic. I know everyone's going to say \"Oh no please don't end the series!\" You know what, I loved this series but I love you guys more. Just do whatever you want I'm sure I'll love it. I, like many of us, have yet to dislike a single video you all have made. That's just a testament to how much time and care you put into your videos. That combined with your comedic talent and mind boggling ability to shit the bed in a video game in such an epic manner when it seems that you're not trying to. Love you all. kisses, pats on the butt.
PLS MORE BUT NEW SEASON NEW START
most worse horde plan yet. whose the ediot design this thing in the first place, \n\n\n(hahah....)
336 hours of this game!! How much do you have on ARK
Killing simon simulator
By far you guys (Simon) blew up more from your mines than the horde did.  Nice.
Please don't end this series whyyy
See y'all next season!
RIP 7 days to die. You will be misssd
Yay!  I get to say I CALLED IT!  Those zombies dug straight down on top you all and you got Thick'd- no a Doracaust (should put that on a T-shirt).\n\nDoraleous your idea was sound and could've worked.  Next time try on the surface instead in a \"Death Hole\".  Maybe a LOTR Helm's Deep base with the same setup,  though likely better just to make an Alamo instead and hope you survive.\n\nGreat episode, hilarious, looking foward to more to come!\n\nEdited a week later:\nM'kay guess this is the last one.  Too bad but I believe in you guys and I know you will make more fun content beyond this in the future.  \n\nIf I get on commenting on comments somehow please let us all know what your plans are now that you have ended both GTA5 and 7DaystoDie series?
Wh...wh..wh..what, this series is ending? Awww... Well, I really appreciated this series. Entertainment isn't meant to last forever, and I understand. I hope there is another series y'all have in mind. #breadstrong
Get em ADA!
well that happened
This is a artistic masterpiece
...And with a heavy heart and a heavy soul Adahop ran out of time and money so the story ends..some say they all live. Some say Simon was the only one who did not make it. No one will ever know.
No more? But this was my favorite of their series.
make a new map and survive horde night in a sky scraper
OMG 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣THIS IS THE MOST FUNNIEST VIDEO I EVER SEEN🤣🤣🤣🤣 \n\nThe title of the video shoud be \"1000 way to die in 7days to die\" 🤣🤣🤣
This was the best way to end a series!! I absolutely loved it and couldn't stop laughing. It's was an amazing ending to an even better series.
Beautiful series ending. Sad to see it go, but beautiful nonetheless. Keep up the amazing work, and Doraleous, you should go into tomb building. Your pretty good at it!
Take a shot every time Simon dies.
I was expecting this to get bad, but not that bad. Loved it. Reminds me of when my brother and I turned the spawner all the way up.
That was... entertaining. Ooh God I love that song! has been my favourite since it came out :D Not talking about 1812 tho, I wasn't alive when that came out lol.
You need to sell keyboard keys like the ada key for everyone on the team.  Outstanding.
Amazing finale guys! Can’t wait to see how you guys top that! For your next adventure you guys should check out a game on steam called Hobo: tough life,  Cheers keep up the good work ;-)
This was a great series....I hope you do another in A17.
This was honestly one of your best videos!! Loved the finale and I'm looking forward to season 2 in A17
Easily the best episode in the entire series. Failure = Entertainment\nGreat job Dora!!!
I'm gonna miss this series so much!!! :'(
I think it's safe to say this went  well
The moment I saw the debris I started laughing :D \nThe most spectacular fail in a while.
I have loved this series. Thank you lads. Dora your hole is amazing
I really hope you guys return to this series, it's one of my favourites.
\"Smaller nipple for a more breast like teat.\"\nThat's the ad I saw when starting this vid lol I don't even have kids
What’s going to replace 7D2D now?😡 \n\nEdit: I was always pumped for the weekend because I get to watch 7D2D in Fridays and Ark on Saturdays. New series better be good.
This was the most epic of the hords loved the fact adahop showed us takeing it to the max
Simon fails, because he doesn't care about the details or didn't pay attention.\nThick fails, because he thinks he knows what he's doing and just goes for it.\nNeebs fails, because he thought he was prepared, but kind of underestimated the situation or got cocky.\nDoraleous fails after putting in a ridiculous amount of effort, but somehow missing a minor detail, that results in something spectacular.\n\n\nAppsro fails to fail.
Can't wait for the frighty night next week!
Ouuu Frighty Night NEXT WEEK!!! Always a treat!
best 7d2d ever
HORDE NIGHT BABY!!!
What a wild adventure, that I enjoyed so much. Can't wait to see what you guys have in store for the next series!
Favorite series on one of my favorite games.
Well, if this truly was the series finale, or if you're waiting on Alpha 17, then I would say this was truly one of the best endings to one of your series but I wish you continued it.
Nooooo!! One of my favorites series 😭😭😭
😥😥😥😥😥 sad to see it go. 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 glad to rewatch it!!!!!
I hate this game, yet I love watching you guys play. Damn fine way to end the series. Well done all. Dora, way to play for the Zombie team with that death trap. Couldn't have gone better!
Neebs Gaming crew should join an online server together, that is at day 500+
Awesome! I'm going to miss this series. Great job once again, you guys are killing it!
Neeebs beating cheerleader by hand...  Never thought I would be alive to see this moment
BRAVO !!!!!  *throwing flowers and Xanax for Simon* !!  Unbelievably amazing series, guys.  That was one hell of a climax!  Made me wet and tingly.
Most epic gaming award goes to Simon. Dora and his good intentions and instincts got everyone thicked
I'm so sad to see this series end but also super excited for what ya'll will replace it with!!
Sorry I couldn’t make it to the stream last night love the video tho
Worst Hoard Night shelter....of ALL time.\n(love the ending song guys)
wait.... season finale??? what?!?!?!?!
Oh man i just finished watching the video and wanted to like. Then i realized that i already did. xD\nGotta like a Neebs Gaming video before it even starts cus it is going to be good 100%!! \nAWESOME SEASON FINAL, GUYS!!
Wait did that just say it's over
They looked prepared
New series please
What did I just watch :O
Duckduckgoose is powerful
I think you meant October 19th not August
Neebs and them should do a team v team death match.\nThey form 2 teams on a map and spend 1 week making bases and then killing each other among the zombie hordes.
Can’t wait for season 2
Man .. Ada should have also joined the gang for the finale..
was that simon singing at the end?
I hope for more
The most entertaining horde night ever and did Adahop partly fuck you up with changing the maps settings
Thanks so much for this series and for what you guys do. You bring so much happiness and laughter to so many.\n\nSeries such as this get my whole group friends exicted and playing games together. Cant thank you enough. \n\nAlso when Simon got killed by the murder vomit, I just lost it. \n\nBadda bing pizza pie
Holy crap this one was the best to date....the horror...the horror!!! Awesome edit
Damn you boys are good at this. I don't look forward to football games or new TV episodes, I look forward to your new episodes. So well made and enjoyable. Seems like the new fallout game would be perfect for your recording format + it would be good for views, discuss on the podcast pretty please!
I like the bunker \n\nReminds me of a underground mining system
This was painful
This was the most amazing episode ever guys! I don't think I've ever laughed this hard!! Very very well edited Adahop! And thank you Doraleous for an excruciatingly beautiful bliss of a failure! I am honestly filled with pains of bittersweet closure. I never wanted this series to end... Between this and Ark, I have no favorite. But this game just oozes content from you guys. There is a hole in my heart now. Guess it's time to rewatch it again from the beginning. Thank you Neebs Gaming for being amazing.
For some reason, seeing a shirtless Simon in the thumbnail made me smile. As usual.
This is the best episode ever I love  it
Wow I’m an hour late
7 weeks of 7 days to die. Great end to a great series. To think I was praising Dora on his defense work last week! Oh well, made for one hell of an episode!
more like seven...teen WAYS to die!
Beautiful season finale just beautiful
Doraleous you f*** up. But is funny as hell!!!
season finale??? But i look forward to my friday fix of zombie neebs mayhem noooooooo
Yall need a simon death counter on all the games
Best .....day....ever:D:D:D Dora you are the man !!:D
Now i know what means \"bittersweet\" I loved every single moment and i hope it continues soon. Love you all
I dunno if you heard from the Raft community, but there was a huge update recently. They added big islands, puffer fish, and a big bird called the screecher. :)
FINALE?!?! Wait no more 7DTD?!?! NoooOOoOOoOOOoOOOO!! Conan or Empyrion better be replacing it!! Anything else would be a travisty!
So this is the season final\n\nWill there be. New season?
But... The 7 Days series will continue.. Right?!
That was amazing. Love you guys
Nonstop laughter this is what I subbed for
duralious is the best
Zombie Sun Tzu: always leave your enemy a path of escape. \nDoraleous:  Watcha' gonna do now Zombie Sun Tzu.
https://youtu.be/jBLyyexZZoc Appsro and Simon kiss rl!
Best finale ever in history LOL
so is this like gonna be the last 7 days episode?
N is for no survivooooooors when you-
I'll miss this series 😢
Noo this I one of my favorite 😭
This is definitely the funniest 7 days horde night in the series. #RIPMegaBunker
Play the forest !!
nice intro
you all deserve a pat on the back great final! dora shame on you not covering the holes haha bless simon he did not stand a chance. hope u come back when alpha 17 hits love all of you thank you so much...ps great video editing truly amazing!!!
Shoddy? lies! dora did an excellent job how dare you Anthony.
No that cant be it why why wwwhhhhhyyyyyyy
Ffs Simon.
By the way it’s 1:30 am and I had to watch this lol
this was painful to watch
Top 100 deaths in Anime XD
After this I would be done too
so season finale isnt the same thing as SERIES finale is it?
The zombies finally won thanks to doraleous's bunker. Good effort big fail love it.
that was thick greatest moment!! That's it you are going with me!!!! Bloom!!
Bravo fellas, bravo! Encore! Hate to hear that this is the finale but I’m sure what you guys have next is going to be better than the contraption doraleous built! Love the videos, you guys make my day. Keep it up.
Please do random gen map next season.
My mom comes in my room to find out what's so funny, I'm laughing so hard.  Thanks for posting this so early West Coast time, LOL.  You made me wake my mom up.  I don't wear jewelry, and I don't like to cook, Simon.  I guess that's why I'm part of the female minority in your viewership.  I swear I tell everyone I know to watch you guys, even the tow truck driver the other day, LOL.  You have the best produced gaming videos on YouTube.  Also, with all the hours I've play 7 Days to Die, I've NEVER died on a horde night...and I'm a girl.
Commenting because I want to be on the next episode 😬! Hello ! I love you guys in a none gay way! You cunts rule 😝
Best thing on the internet
I like how Dora is laughing the entire time that the crew is dying around him. It's like he knew this cave would be the death of them. 😂🤣
No I love you guys and this game.  I can’t believe it the final season
No don’t end it my day has already been crap don’t make it worse 😥
Masterfully edited once again
Doralious shooting simon, he obviously did this on purpous to get him lol
Sad the Series is ending for now. I'm sure it's just exhausting to even edit the show. But if a new series is coming then I'm sure it will be good.
Noooo this can't be the end! This is my favourite series!!! :'(
omg, first 30 sec and i'm sitting on the edge of the chair, excited like a little boy the night his first new year's eve.
Now that is entertainment!  If I had a billion bucks in the bank, I would pay you each $10,000 a day to make a daily 7 Days to Die episode! Unfortunately, I don't have a Billion of anything,! I do have 37.2 trillion cells in my body, and they ain't worth much!
good idea... poor execution.
6:41 I can already tell this is going to be the best horde night ever
THIS doraleous is why you ALWAYS have an escape plan
This has been one of my favorite series from you all. Got me playing the game too! Thank you all for it! Been a wild and fun ride, hope it gets a return soon!
Flawless Victory!
Best episode ever
I'm lowkey glad the series ended at first it was interesting then only the horde nights were interesting, if you are going to start new series I suggest you to try Terraria it's a really good survival game with lots of activities in it, but if you gonna play Terraria I suggest you to play in the expert mode it would be way more fun or you can play Terraria with mods it's up to you. But it doesn't matter what will you upload I'll still watch it.
Season finale or series finale? I'd love a 2nd season
Yep they are all fucked
One of the most epic videos ever lol!
R.I.P Simon 2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018-2018....
Oh my freakin God that shit was funny!
I take it that's the end for now until the new update comes out loved every minute of the series. What a great ending but a great disaster love it keep up the good work guys. Maybe when the new update comes out you can do a random map. Oh and love that Dora laughed pretty much all the way through it haha😂🤣😂🤣😂 Don't you go and finish Ark now keep that up for a little longer please would be devastated if that finished as well.
Should hav ended it with public execution of dora.. like in minecraft
Doreaous you are a wenkar.
You have to put spikes and traps above yourselves so zombies dont drop down on you
Best video on youtube
My favorite show from Neebs Gaming.  Gonna hold you to it being a \"Season Finale\" and not a \"Series Finale\".
8/10
I hope this is not the last one
I had such high hopes...
Hay Yaa'z ..... Thanks For The Laffs, Sad to see it end, but there will have to be a Brady Bunch Reunion at some point. 👋
They probably won’t make more till Alpha 17 guys. So around December. (The company of 7D2D are very slow updaters...)
perfect .. nothing more to say
Ada you evil monster
I really though that doraleous has a ton of explosives just buried somewhere and he was going to just blow everything to hell at the end. I’m kind of glad this series is over, it was starting to get boring not just for me but it also seem to be getting boring for them. You can tell when they had enough of a game. Anyways, love you neebs gaming and great job on the stream last night. World peace.
Wow..... what a way to finish the series! That Dora score is the most accurate score yet.
I'm gonna miss this series. Always makes my midday Fridays at work more enjoyable knowing I have a 7 Days video to keep me preoccupied
its like home alone
sometimes all it takes is one flaw for an entire plan to fall to pieces.
maybe the  best episode in years
Hahahaha Simon spent more time spawning then fighting, next time give him the torch lmao
Wtf noooooooo you can't end this series omg I love watching 7 days to die. It's my friday must watch...boohooohoo (internet lingo crying)  but on the serious note nooooooooooo. And the award for the most times died during hord night go to simon (all please give a round of applause). Love you guys but you got your work cut out trying to replace this series
Hope to see more next season .
Dora seemed to be at the top of his game with the introduction of the battleship build and what promised to be the best horde night base to date. The people were even about to elect him for president! Its always awful to see someone fall from grace
Such a bitter sweet ending to it all had me laughing so hard the entire time this team is by far the best gaming team out there absolutely a huge fan of every single one of you would very much hope and love to see some more 7days to die in the near future and try not to give poor old doralious a hard time he spent a lot of time and effort into that death hole 😂👍🏽 great video guys
Ah man ... I'm so happy and sad all at the same time
If after you died in the game you were reborn as a zombie hoard nights would be much crazier than this. Especially for Simon because there would be 18 more zombies that were way more competent than Simon actually is. I personally would have gone with the good ole thick escape plan like in the canyon but that's just me.
Wow, fantastic editing on this episode. My compliments to the chef!
This is by far the funniest shit I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
As sorry as I am to see the series end it was a fantastic finale! I came to find Neebs Gaming from this series and have since watched many of their series.  Thank you all for the wonderful content and all the hard work you obviously put into it. I do hope you come back to a17 when it is stable and treat us all to more wonderful episodes of one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI do have to say something that I learned in the army many years ago. \n\n\"The harder you make it for them to get in, the harder it is for you to get out. \"
This was the most epic disaster I've ever seen. I approve.
Man, seriously!? This is the end of 7 days to die?! This was my number 1 series!!
I never laughed so hard in my life.
Best outro ever
Wow
Noooooo this is my favourite show don’t stop now
Ended the best way it could have, cheers! Also I don't think they are so much attracted to heat as they are Simon's delicious flesh.
You fuckers... You get me completely invested in a wonderful series only to take it away from me. If you stop playing Ark any time soon, there will be hell to pay. I’m talking to you Thick44. HELL!!!!!!!!!!
7 Days is my favorite series you've done. so much so i've went out and got the game, still trying to find a play group on PS4, but i know the game is kinda old. I fear the day when thi series ends, cause i know i'll miss it alot. Also, Dora...WTF. That was the worst horde night plan, well aside from the Hospital Bullet proof glass night. I dunno, the death hole seems worse.
What a great and hilarious way to end a great series... Thanks guys (esp. Adahop)!
Epicccccc big love !!!
Record for most deaths on a horde night\n\nIt'll be safe -doralous
It wouldn't be Neebs Gaming if it actually worked as planned. Still love you though big D!
Definitely shoddy workmanship lol. Talk about out of frying pan and into the shitter lol. Hope you guys have a good vacation to recharge. Can't wait for more great content from y'all
not even a minute in and i gotta pause to 👍 and salute that intro! lol
Loved it keep up the good work!
Noooooooooooo make a season 2
Plz say on alpha 17 you start over again! ;( ;( ;(
We all love simon this is a death trap
Not watch the episode yet just on my way on from work to watch it on the big screen but what the hell is this about season finale 😱😱 I love this show hope it comes back when alpha 17 drops with all the new stuff and hope you have something for in the mean time what else I'm I going to look forward to on a Friday night
I hate to see it go GOOD BYE 7 DAYS TO DIE😭
A worthy finale.
RIP Simon, Apsero, Doraleous, Thick44, and Neebs. We will continue to survive the zombie apocalypse in memory of everyone who died in the bunker/tomb.
Holy hell, just send Simon to post-war areas and have him find and clear all the mines.
OMG thick's song at the end is priceless
Oh adahop you troll
Welp doraleous really knows how to bring the comedic value...
Nooooo, not the season finale, hopefully you do another, maybe do a modded one like war of the walkers, but keep up the great vids, love watching you guys
Best epic episode yet
What a fantastic disaster! If nothing else, Doraleous is a guarantee to put in the most effort, create the best defenses and still have the most epic failure in the shows history, you're a hero in the world of comedic gaming sir! Just keep kicking the chain!
best show ever
i cried
Nooooo I'm so sad it's over
Loved it so much 7 days to die was great thank you for the memories neebs gam will definitely miss this
Oooooooooooooohhhhh this is about to be really really really reallly good
Fantastic. Those holes Dora conveniently left above them worked flawlessly. Great episode. Haha
The best 7 Days to Die finale ever seen! Absolutely loved it ^_^ Also lol to Simon 16:21
7000 views in 35 mins ...not bad
omg Simon cracks me up
Does this mean no more 7 Days Videos, if so what will you guys be doing next. Can't wait to here it on Commenting on Comments
can't wait to see the next series you guys make. This was probably one of my favourites.
i hope you guys don’t quit this series. it’s awesome and there is so much more you could do....
Is anyone keeping count of how many death there where
Simon is a WARRIOR
I blame you!!! I just put my kid to sleep for a nap and I laughed so hard when I saw the \"little problem\" I woke him up I tried to get up and tend to him but I was laughing so hard I almost threw up and dropped my phone
The best episode in a long time , love the way simon hope get high , just to be cruch by some epic way to die, keep up the good work boys love your videos .
This was a godlike episode
Best.episode.ever! I wish I could like this more than once
Not the hardest difficulty. Disliked and unsubbed. Also punched a kitten for good measure.
Do you want a president that hits Cheerleaders? Say no to woman beater nerbs, and yes to Simon/Fozzy Bear 2018
Red dead?
0 likes so far
This was so majestically retarded. I'm sad it's the end but what a fucking episode
Came for the finale, stayed for the great editing skills
Wow this game series is a year old. Doesn't feel like it's been that long at all
Will this be a season finale or series finale? Since I heard that they are no longer going to be running the console servers anymore.
Even  1st horde night was better then this this lol
Lol simon
Masterful, what an amazing series. Thanks everyone for the great show, looking forward to the next!
The Last Stand of Neebs Gaming (2018, Colorized)
Next season we need a Simon death counter!
The addiction factor of your shows is going up. I can't live without Ark or 7 days to die.\nIf you stop 7 days to die I'm going to need another Neebs Gaming production series to get through the week.\n\nP.S. Dora don't listen to the haters. Ada screwed you over and I think the Death Hole... hermmmm... I mean bunker was a great idea.
Dont end it Neebs\nLike if you want the season to continue
so are you guys gonna update the game now and play w the new stuff?
It's over 😭😭
well shit its last
This channel and the guys are HIGHLY underrated.
Wait, is the 7 days series over for good?
Hi can I get 100 likes for no reason :) and if no likes then at least a heart from NEEBS GAMING :)
Who IS laughing like that at 10:07?!?!?!?!!? lmao
Pleeeeease do come back with a second season of 7DTD...maybe once Alpha 17 is released?  It's been the most enjoyable series I've seen so far!  Also, how do I get an Adahop button on my keyboard?!
OMG! I laughed so hard at this! Love the fact that Dora KNEW that hole was there and was like \"oh I hope that doesn't become an issue\". He invested so much into this place but didn't fill those holes? Also how did Simon not fall in them lol.
What?! Season finale. Hmmmm but I want more.
I love the name of the D drive
This might quite possibly be the funniest thing I've ever seen. I love you guys
August?
better than the glass box, but not by a lot :p  untill 21minutes in, then i noticed it was worse xD
#ooza #booza
Omg.....that was EPIC! 😂😂
Watching this at 2:05am in Australia right now\n\n#WorthIt
Journey End is the name of place in the video. I dont think it is the End of the Journey
This is the best season finale of any show you've ever done lol
I am really sad that this show is over for now... But still it was a great finale!
Please go to a random gen world next! This show is too good to end! Random gen worlds are 10x bigger and I know y’all will love it! So will we the fans!
Only Doraleous could build something so complex with such a simple flaw. Proud of you Dora :)
666th like
I hope the new series is going to be Minecraft or empyrion
21:13 to 21:43 best funny death montage ever!!!!!!
Sad to see this series go. I've had so much fun watching it. I'm sure you'll come back to it once they update it....whenever that is...😟
Wow, this was quite the Doracaust. Think Dora's kill count got padded quite nicely in this one.
Oh yes D's inner monologue is back!
The 1812 Overture was perfect =)
How did they get two drops?
Greatest ever
Praying for all in South carolina
I thought Doraleous was being loopy,  but that was a master stroke.  God bless Marine Corps training!!!
What a deathtrap... love it
May we never forget the massacre of Day 50 that Doraleous brought upon everyone. Yet it maybe the best episode of any Neebs Series yet. Absolutely hilarious. Thank you Doralingus.
God dammit guys you guys killed it on this one.  Wow i laughed so hard i snorted...lol  LOVE the 7 days to die ones to death.  Also gratz on last nights stream watched from start to finish and loved it all.  Waiting for the next one (im Srrock61 in twitch and Srrock on steam)
Plus the 7 days song at the end hell ya
This was great
By far the best episode of the whole series. I knew when we got the preview of doras setup something fishy was just waiting to happen
Thankfully they added body count. That was great
New season soon pleaseeer
I liked the death count at the end \nAnd this was one of the funniest episodes yet guys great job keep it going
hey guys i have a series idea  for you, you guys should play dying light
Is this goodbye forever or are they getting ready for the next alpha release?
The greatest episode EVER!!!
Gotta get ready for work, so will have to wait til tonight to watch the full episode, but that intro has me HYPED!
Haha hahahaha best hoard night ever my side hurts
God damn it doraleous
Kinda suck that yall had to end blaming doraleous. Doralingus ftw
How often does this happen
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Best season finale EVER!
F
Nah his cant be the end we haven’t seen Simon fortify his own base yet \nI mean can’t be as bad as Dora’s
This episode was the most brutal and bloodiest horde then any other horde
Best horde night ever!
#MoreThanOne Horror game this October.
I don't think that there was any other way this could end.
I knew they were goin to dig
Is this really the season finale
Hands down, this is by FAR the most entertaining 7 days episode in HISTORY.
Lmao
\"Im in a fistfight with a cheerleader\"\n-Neebs 2018
HELL YES!! Beautiful ending!!! You guys are fuckin amazing!!
Dorbjorn planned this from the very start, it was revenge for all the times the guys made fun of his haircut
This is my happy place. This and whiskey.
How funny would it be if the gimp randomly made an appearance in 7 days lol. He just makes random appearances in dif games
Absolutely love your content guys, keep it up cute butts!!
This was fucking great
Why didn't dora just reverse the layout of the horde area?
Why stop this is great
Season finale \n\nMe: nooooooooooo\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 2?
When you literally get defeated because you left a hole in the ground. That could not have played out any worse! Doraleous’ Death Hole is the best horde night in my opinion! Lmao
This game must feel frustrating. Too bad the zombie drillers makes it hard to innovate every Horde Night to be different.\nWonder how a horde night on water would go.
Oh god not warrior difficulty!! How could you be so cruel ?! ;c
DIE SIMON DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Love the intro!!!
Am I the only one who thinks the music in the beginning sounds like Star Wars for a second?
Dora has earned his \"Maker\" coin.
THAT SONG WAS SO EPIC! WHO'S DICK DO I HAVE TO SUCK TO GET THIS FUCKING SONG IN MY LIFE?
Guys from Neebs, have you seen Dark and Light? Its Ark, but with magic.
You get a like just for that INTRO!
It didn't take them seven days to die though, only like 20 minutes.
I have to do it again SEEPY GOAT!!! Also the next zombie game you should play is unterned and its free
YEAAAAASSSSS!!!!!
At first I thought it was overkill, but then I realized it was designed so the zombies can go over and kill the crew.  THE BEST DEATH TRAP.
Appsro is like the Bill Paxton of the group . God rest his soul .
so this is the last episode?  nooooooooo
Best fucking horde night ever. I love this shit. Let everyone know on commenting with comments how fucking bad ass u all are. God job doraligus
Wait no more 7 days?
But why were the shenanigans done in august, its october so they havnt noticed since then?\nLol
Nightmare before Christmas the perfect underline music
Shit went south real quick lol
You had one fuckin job.....
Yeaaahhhh!!!
Congrats guys. This was freaking awesome. You guys earned it. Keep on being you😎🍑
But it’s October.......
Neebs plz do more ark
Please don’t say “season finale”. I’m having flashbacks to EPISODE 2 of Ghost Recon: Wildlands -_-
The intro gave me goosebumps. I love the work guys
Hell of an intro :D
I'd say revisit minecraft, a conan or a appsro series
Guys, you better give us a season 2 or you'll... umm be cursed with noodle dicks YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
Say it isn't so
Haha loved the start of it. The music made it so dramatic! Can't wait for when you guys starts Red Dead 2\n\nEDIT: Watched the rest of it. This entire thing past 19 mins is practically everyone's death montage. Well done Simon, a new record.\nAnd Dora? You are an idiot. Congrats.
We all know it was thick because he turned up the thermostat
You guys should try \"Generation Zero\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvVuF3dE1c
I guess everything ends at some point.
The next game you should all play. is Rust.
Doralingus is beast
Well now.....THAT was unexpected! Frickin torches
Do a season 2 at alpha 17 update a lot of new things been added. Also if u don't want to do it in navazgane do a randomly generated map
Is that a chest or what at 5:51? Middle of the ledge made in hole.
Not survivalist?
Is there going to be another season??
Appsro de booty yeah
SEASON FINALE?!?!?!?! NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is this the last episode of 7 Days to die??
I'm so hyped for the Frighty Night episodes!!!!
lol strap in, here we go boys n girls.
HEY SIMON.... SHUT UP
final episode, just in time for the incoming A17 update. nice timing.
Already super pumped 1 minute into the video
screams
WAIT, do you guys all have an Adahop button ? What does it do ? Does it make a wild Adahop appear and fetch you ice tea or beer ? Does it squeek when you press it ? Is Adahop trapped in a cell unless the button is pressed to release him ?
Cat Herding simulator 2018
season finally! better come back this is hilarious! how do you get these angles? \nBTW barrels and torches are only good for light not much heat you want to fire up camp fires and forges.

21 seconds after upload, new record
Season finale meaning the series finished or just Dora’s terrible plans
My house was destroyed by hurricane Michael along with my town I just got service and it’s so nice to be able to lay down and watch all these videos I missed
