It's so fun to watch Canada play
1:48:17 its mei
1:33:47 was that an all-star reference??
1:16:15
I don’t get it someone please explain. Is XQC Canadian or American? Wasn’t he playing for Dallas fuel? Do people play in teams from countries they’re not from?
Can we get a playlist
neil bad AF
AS a norwegian i have to hope Norway wins????????????????????
ADD THE COUNTRY SKINS TO THE GAME! #NORGE / #NORWAY <3
So happy to see XQC back
xQcunt is back!!!
Doa Monte is too good. Love them.
USA
Yeah I’ll watch the whole thing
Man the nose on note ??????
4:01:00
That thumbnail is such a big spoiler!
Overwatch can I come in the overwatch Thailand team pls
I like how XQC sprayed the Dallas Fuel logo even after they kicked him off the team, haha.
They played Zarya tbh she was making plays
The commentators talking about Austria after that third game was so sad ??????
did agilites change his postion?
Match 1 intros start at 29:37
Pregame starts at 14:37
You know I had to do it to them
It’d be funny if this whole World Cup was scripted

I saw mercy picked atleast twice out of all of those world cup games, is she just not good or fun anymore or something? Havent played overwatch in a while.
Heia Norge
É BRASIL POHA
The world cup is a good idea in theory, but in reality, its just a ton of total blowouts. Get rid of the scrubs next year. USA Canada Sweden Finland France Korea are the only teams that should be there.
can you stop banning maximilianmus
Vaaai Brasil!!
1:46:05 the best part hands down
3:34:05 broken Rein charge
That Canada vs Austria match was brutal and hilarious. Amazing moments and crazy strategies.
Which is the first game in the 2018 world cup?
NOTE HAS A BIGGER SHNOZE THAN XQC
blizzard your advertisement game sucks, ive already missed owl finals, all star games and now first day of world cup just because i didnt know, and i follow oyu on all platforms :C
Hi my name is Ian i'm 13 when I grow up I want to work with blizzard!
VAI BRASILIAN
Pelo menos da noruega nois ganha
I hate how there's always some annoying girl screaming their lungs out in like every one of these
I am from Norway
EU > NA
Hey Overwatch character designs. Can you make a skin of Genji with a Baseball bat? That would be really cool paired up with the fastball Zen. It would also be really funny to see him deflect his balls with a baseball bat.
Dude potg should be like these highlight reels. With the slow-mo and speed ups
Assisti 8 horas de live ontem, e hoje mais um dia. FERIADO BOM ESSE
0:00:01 this should work
When they are playing do they have their country skins on? Because in one shot of their monitors it looked like they all had the default skins on
Make an Overwatch League channel. Different interest between Overwatch and Overwatch League. Some people just have no interest in it and you create 300 videos and alerts about it.
NORWAY????????????????????????
GO CANADA
TriHard 7
Wow when I saw the thumbnail for a second I almost had the reflex to unsubscribe to the channel because I thought someone was talking about football.

6:27:30 "That high noon looked more like an 11 45"
Spoilers in thumbnail, good job
Are these skins comming to the game so i Can Buy them?

Yeah Brasil! South American power!

Thought xqc was out of OWL... not watching another match with him a homophobe on the rosters. Utterly disappointed.
XQC is a horrible human being!
Man xqc looking like a snack on that ow camera :^) go daddy xqc
they play tanks on EU? since when i cant get a single tank in my groups
Team Canada ????????????????
I give props to the commentators, idk how they can talk that long and say every details in seconds, I wish I was like that lol
I for some reason play the game and yet almost never watch is that a crime or just flat out sin.
Canada!
GO CANADA! Singapore is not in so I'm supporting my boy xQc
Why is the video starting at 4 hours?
Are all these world cup skins be available to everyone to purchase?

xqc has a dallas fuel undershirt.. so passive aggressive
XQC’s back!!!

Is it just me or is Ashe just a better Widowmaker? Headshot non-tanks, get height easily (now with damage!) throw an explosive that DOT's (but you can shoot it early and its an AOE!) and an ult that summons an extra TANK--WHO CAN APPARENTLY CONTEST THE POINT??? My god. And I thought I was tired of seeing Widowmaker in every damn game...
I think i’m gonna need to borrow Bruce’s credit card. I need a new setup in the Fortress of Solitude.
#stopbobabuse
? ?????? ??? ?????
"Bob do something." Bob stares at wall.
Whos eats cereal with water eww eww
Twomad of the day: DADDY
Or tired or to make funny
Needs a Nerf, immediately.
I'm Punk so I must rebel, I'm Asian so I must like maths, I die my hair crazy colors so I must be looking for attention, I'm Bob, So I must do something.
I think BOB is hero 30.
BOB = Michael Jackson : O
Wait what’s wrong with eating cereal with water
XQC can make a good flex main
Ashe looks fun, let’s se how long until everyone’s starts crying for her being too powerful
cereal used to be eaten with water, the only reason we use milk today is because of milk and cereal companies working together. thus the norm became the oddity.
10:00 My foster parents used to make me eat my cereal with water almost every morning, it was torture and disgusting.
poor bob
of course the twomad clip had to be lowered lol.
OGE is an absolute madlad.
Is she free for everybody now or is this PTR
Effect was actually sorry about killing bob unlike everyone else who just laughed
This morning when I was on ptr someone landed Bob on one of the rocks at hanamura and it looked like he was tea bagging.
Im glad Twomad's dad was able to help him :)
Finally my boy twobad on the spot
Bob must be under a lotta stress
Bob: Exists R34 artists a week later: ( ?° ?? ?°)
1970s: In the future I bet we'll have flying cars! 2018: Eating Lucio-ohs with water instead of milk
i watche like 10 ads on this video, wtf
F in the chat for Dafran btw
God bless Bob. At least he tries.
Forget Ashe, I'M A BOB MAIN NOW!
0:37 What, that's insane.
XQC new ana main who dis?
balanced
Bob M I N D I F I EXTEND? DO SOMETHING
Poor bob. He was told to do something. I didnt think he'd do that
With great pointing ability comes great responsibility
BOB! DO SOMETHING! kills his own team
Spiderman: Mr. Stark can I do something?
5:00 A new feature, Winston's bubble is now a DiscoBall
Not even psychopaths eat cereal with water.
At 5:20 that was me
Hey wait it means that now you can do a 7 men shatter, 7 men dva bomb or a 7 men EMP Pog
Double te-he <3
I’m gonna have to agree with Sideshow here. We have to put OGE down. For everyone’s sake
Double charachter, double 'teehee'
Ok now kephrii is not a widow god anymore ... he is a widowasher god... no wait
points the cliff BOB, DO SOMETHING Bob dies '' I'M SORRY BOB '' Dafuq dood, what's your problem? :<
144 days left!!
The moment I saw the title, I immediately thought that it was because B.O.B was going to fall through the map... #IGotJebaitedBecauseOfThat
Blizzard needs to patch the game so B.O.B. can't be summoned into pits #justiceforBOB
water + lucio oh's = transformation into owl player
Well BOB has had a hard life, being bossed around. Wouldn't it be expected if he doesn't do something?
They're gonna Nerf Bob being able to cap points
HeeTee !
Fitzy was the first one to see Winston's new disco skin
that is one S P I C Y angle if I've ever seen one
DO YOU MEAN ANYTHING*
I'm watching during school shhhhh
There's now a second hitscan sniper, i guess kephrii can play 2 heroes now and not only widow. Still doesn't deserve to be in OWL.
A TwoMad clip and two "teehee"s? I can dig it
Birdring_ow aiming is different than what is usually see. Very rough and fast yet precise. Unlike the usual smooth tracking. I like it. Its exciting to watch
Wow you showed someone eating cereal with water and didn't warn us of NSFL content. Reported and unsubbed
8:16 kephrii kills me xD
I guess kephrii has a new main... so do I :D
Roll that beautiful BOB footage!
I wish i could be good at Bob
3:39 He is saying: "sleep sleep"
Is this a mythbusters video for Big Omnic Boiii (B.O.B)
Twomad "MY DADS COMIN. HES COMIN. DAD DO SOMETHIN"
two teehees? that's something new
Sideshow is right: That guy is a psychopath and must be killed.
? ??????? ???? ? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??????? !!!!
5:58 Ashe: BOB DO SOMETHING Bob: CANNONBALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Great video buddy??
I don know can I just get a shoutout. ^^
EFFECT IS PSYCHOPATH .
Dude, back in the day it was normal to eat cereal with water. Milk companies advertised milk in cereal to increase profits.
Can we all just think of How stressful Bob has it with all the yelling and him accidentally running of the map We have to pay respect that he needs to rest sometimes
Bob dO SoMEtHiNg
Bob can do everything a player does, is Bob hero 30?!
You know which Ultimate would be OPAF? "JEFF, DO SOMETHING"!
nO No no NO.. lucio oh ohs is a no no for water
Bob takes the point better than widow.
The funny thing is in the next clip Bob is doing something that I can't be asked to do
Dafran just left overwatch Can we get an F for him?
first
Today's video was like a new school subject called B.O.B.
Bob's a little bit special guys don't judge him
10:08 cant agree more
Bob just did the Moonwalk
You know what else is great about him? If you play as Lucio and speed boost him, he becomes Usain Bolt
5:59 BOB DO BUNGEE JUMPING!!!
Okey, editor officialy kidnaped. Im calling 911
Bob respects Alfred Hitchbot too much to jump on his car
First
I guess bob can do alot more than just "something"
This is why bob should’ve been a hero instead
Subscribe to pewdiepie danke
Good life for who read this comment
B O B D O S O M E T H I N G
Sah dud
Bob! Don’t do anything
I LOVE ALL OF YOU
What hero guide or other tip video would you like to see next? Let us know!
This video is fucking retarded
Roadhog hog is op now im buying his ice fisherman skin aka tuna skin lol
I'm a rain,.doom, zarya,junk main at the moment in 1800 so is that good
Reinhart and Zaria
Idd brig is op, played her for 24 games competitve and got 21 wins with her bronze to gold ez ??
wom wom wom wom wom
I use winston and ana.
"For the first time she's gonna take it from d.va" Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh season 1-3?
So...I should not have Gold Damage as Reinhart...darn
Shortened guide: Just run goats. Bronze could run it.
YES Phara I'm Good with phara and especially since I'm on console it's harder to hit her while in mid air
Much appreciated bruh
I disagree with the low pressure statement. Bronze/Gold is low-pressure to you, but not to the people ranked there.
4:40 record and put on loop. You're welcome. Now you have an ASMR video.
As a biased junkrat main, I’d say I use him in both comp and qp as a shield breaker since...he’s probably the only hero I can play decently...anyways, yeah I call him my shield breaker, so like the shield tanks have barely any time before their shields go down.
More bronze advice pls!
Fissure got his shatter back instantly damn
You forgot Reaper! He is Overpowerd! He can go easy in and go with shadow out. He do sooo hard damage against tanks and all others!
No spacial awareness here, no Doomfist for me.
wooom-wooom-wooom-wooom <3
Pro Tip #1 don't go for any kills with your ult, only use your Ult for creating space, and when you lose the game its because you didn't do it right.
10:10 That actually made me throw up
I don’t play overwatch too much but i win games and frag out with hammond,
@0:45 fappy potter
I still use mei all the time is she still powerful?
Where’s sombra? :)
Ana and zarya are meta? Well it's a good day to main genji!
The Ana to widow switch lol
I'm a mid-GM Torb player and it feels like everyone (including the pro players I get matched with) hate me playing Torbjorn.
first pick hero.second play hero.and last,stop play your main hero and play mccree and genji
Briggs shield is garbage now, I can't even protect my team for 5 seconds before getting killed...
Dva had a near 100% pick rate during the OWWC? Not best off tank?
There’s is a word cup lol
There was a Gale clip at 10:15 and you have it credited towards Ml7 please fix it and credit the correct person. Thanks
One tricking Torb (nearly, I still flex) has let me gain 200sr from all my season highs since Season 8 on my DPS account. I went from hovering around the 2400/2500sr mark to a placement at 2638 with an 83% winrate, and then started climbing. The rework has truly helped him.
trash list
can you make one of these for console players? Elo hell escaping is a bit different on them.
Is averaging 7.6k-9kish heals in two rounds of C2P as Ana any good? I hit 7.6k when a portion of my time is to defend against flankers with little to no support, and/or I die early in a fight because of poor positioning.
Chipshajen clip, did he stream lately?
Already loe 8 games in a row. I was almost diamond and now im gold. I love this game, the players are great
I've mained Moira and Doomfist since they came out respectively, Thanks for the tips
Ultimate suck
I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t play anyone but hanzo so uhhh torb I guess?
Hot hog
Thx for this video
WHERES MY BOI WINSTON, YOU FORGOT TO EVEN SAY HE ESXISTED IN OFF TANK!!!
I use overload as an engage tool on enemies with large hitboxes so I can kill them with shotgin
I'm now a torb main and I'm actually pretty good lele
whats the best way to get suspended? play the game. everyone will report you. aint it fun?! this game is dead but still manages to have millions playing it. blizzard has sunk so low they even put AI into comp games. what is wrong with you people?
what does cc mean, i haven’t played in ages
gonna start playing again lol
WOMWOMWOMWOM
So I should stop playing doom in high gold? Damn it, I just started to get the hang of him. Oh well, better start learning pharah and torb then.
I haven't played since season 7
This is the first vid I’ve watched off yours and I subbed straight after cos it was super useful
In my Plat exprerience this Season is very very very stong: 5.Widow Maker 4. Wrecking Ball 3.Winston 2.Moira 1.Torb
Do meta trends really matter in a lower tier bronze to silver fight ?
I came here because it said bro you wack viewers watch
I climbed from bronze to masters in 2 weeks with doom
The best tip in this vid ? I guess taht you should switch to widow when you slept someone and headshot him
ive watched all your videos on ranking up and getting out of bronze but nothing seems to work im not even that bad of a player i just feel that NONE of the videos help help me plz
Its gonna be a toxic meta ...
i knew for a fact that doom ana and brig are gonna make it in the video .. while im still insisting on playing zen this season lol
soldier ?
When only one teammate has had a mic in 5 placements
Ty for making this Video!!!!!!
that widow switch at 10:10 hahaha
Are people still so braindead they're convinced Brig is STILL OP?
But D.vas dps I higher than zaryas cause dva doesn’t have to build charge
However I must add I did enjoy the video. and the content from this channel as far as over watch channels go this stuff is often pretty good. but my thoughts still stand no matter the meta or the state of hero's due to the current patch. I believe being on voice chat matters more than the choice of hero.
Have you guys done a guide for competitive TDM? I would love to see one, thanks.
I am zarya/rein/pharah main ????
Soldier decent pick?
Im really good in doom but my team they think im trolling ??
holy shit i hate bastion
Omg....you actually had really good Torbjorn tips. I have over 70 hours on him myself. Played him a ton before the rework and not so much with the rework. Granted I don't like the rework but it was easy for me to make him work. Just....not one bad tip for Torb play.
Lucio is way better then brig as off healer
Only 75000 subs? Wow
USE THE SLEEP OFF COOLDOWN AHAHHAHAHAHAH
I was gonna say put Brig as a dps but then i remembered that in silver, my rank, we use her as a healer instead of dps
7:42 I get to 3400 with Doom and then back down becouse teams :(
10:12 smart plays
Recomending ana to player below masters :/
I am a Tracer/Mercy main with over 75+ hours on both and to be honest it is really hard to play both. Tracer bc of Brig and Sombra and Mercy bc of her kinda weak state right now. I am currently learning Sombra and Zen but I just don't want to let go off Tracer. I just love her so much. I am in Plat and it's really hard to do anything there. No one is in team chat and the most people are really toxic in Team Chat. I am overall a very positive person and I always try and do my best but to be honest all the Toxicity is getting really hard to avoid.
In my opinion, road hog is still a great tank, I’m an Xbox player so maybe it’s different on pc...
LoL i was in low silver and i played whit doomfist and winston all my placements and placed low gold... woh says gold ppl cant play doom?
What abt the new reaper in bronze to gold? Is he viable there?
Idk, I would give off support to Lucio... yes Brigitte is a beast, but his utility is insane
I can only assume you have either forgotten what it is like to be a low tier player, or never were. Reinhard is boring to play, Zaria is frustrating because the shield time is so short and Pharah is really hard to learn. I have about 150 hours in the game, and admit I'm a below average player, but recommending these to low tier players is just a bad joke. I'm not saying they are bad hero's or that I don't have respect for those who play/master them, but I only got 5 minutes into the video before I'd had enough. For those in low ranks, learn Orisa, Hog and/or D.VA and you'll do well and have fun.
10:09 this Clip was actually from Game Adelade lol
Thanks! Did my placements before watching this video, I’m ded
Solo heal brig is the new gold meta dont @ me
dude I'm so pissed at this season and its matchmaking in general. for reference, I've placed plat on 2 accounts(one flex only, one dps only) for 2 seasons in a row. I start placements on my flex account with friends ranging from 2.2k-2.9k sr. we were a 4 stack. we won 8 of our matches, and everyone in those games were between 2.5k and 3k sr. I played main tank and main support for all of them. didn't even touch dps. consistent POTG and gold/silver medals. signs of doing well right? WRONG! I placed at fuckin 2180, the lowest ive placed in 3 seasons as a tank. WTF!!
Do you think that some kind of ammo or stamina for briggites main flail would help balance her?
why isn't doomfist a good hero for plat to diamond?
This video is fine and all, but saying only use Torb's overload and Doomfist's Meteor Strike as escapes and rarely as engagements? Yeah, maybe use your own footage that don't contradict what you're saying. We saw how you could use both offensively. Don't try to act like these are only escape tools and barely anything to engage with. Because that's not true
Oh look, its only 3 heroes that I CAN play (Reinhardt, Torbjorn, & Brigitte) in this list. Also the only way Hammond is the main tank, is when the player that is playing him is good with him.
Ah... none of the heroes on this list do I play or enjoy playing - except for maybe learning Ana. No wonder I don't have fun in my matches anymore :(
Doomfist is definitely OP, but damn are his mechanics hard to get down.
This is my standard response to these vid's and I should simply copy and paste. The best hero's to play in any season for most tier's unless you're like top 500. The best hero's to play in any season is the hero you're used to the one you've played most time on. Zarya maybe awesome for instance but if you have no play time on her. yes as an example I have hours on her in quick play but I'd likely be considered a thrower if I took her into comp. I play orisa as a main tank, and yes she may not be considered according to this vid rein is better, but if i have no hours on him and several hours on Orisa then she's the best tank. ..... I'm rambling granted but yes take these vids with a pinch of salt, and play who you enjoy that's how you'll do good in anyone season.
Lucio as off healer as his main ability is to speed boost which can avoid choke holds and get the game rolling
Is genji good?
brig probs needs a rework or stuns should be reworked.
Nicee video I was late for notif squad tho
Can you help me I am a gold Player who is playing much phara and genji. I'm stuck in gold on 2100-2200 SR my hit rate is with phara 50-70% and with genji 30-45%. I think that I have an OK positioning I try to stay every time on high ground how can I Rank Up? By the way I am a german so sorry for my Bad english
U should’ve done bronze-silver, gold-plat, diamond and masters +
Made it 300 likes! Keep up with the hard work!
Just finished my placements this morning. I won 6 and lost 4 but still got placed in low bronze fml
I am trying to main Sombra rn (in gold). Do you think she is a solid pick?
Love this channel, ?? thanks.
All I want them to do with brig is remove her self healing. We don't need another lifesteal hero and I think people would have an easier time dealing with her one on one.
A brig guide OMEGAlul
I think either Lúcio or Moira instead of brig
my god, i swear, if i see genji and snipers in silver.. we about to lose some sr :(
Can someone Maybe tell me why Lucio is not on the list ? Would love to know because i main him
Play torb lul
she isn't brig she's BAGUETTE
hey c:
So im better off not playing this season bc non of my mains are in the list?
You’re the best! Thanks for all these video’s
10:12 was insaane :0
Why is it always the exact gameplay? I ike your vids but i think this is too much..
How tf does this channel have so little subs it definitely deserves more, it's so helpful
thanks for the video! I haven't played OW since the beginning of season 12, so I forgot which heroes were more effective and haven't kept up with what's meta. Now I know which heroes to play and will transition back in OW comp more smoothly.
Torbjörn is Op but Underrated nice vid. :)
anybody have thoughts on playing tracer right now? I'm low diamond if that makes a difference.
Thank you
How long do you think it will take for the flank guide to be done???
Is the Reaper any good because he looks pretty damn cool
Torb definitely not LOL he really really sucks
Should i get the game?
Nice guide
time for top 500 torb only

Congrats on 600!, What song is that at 2:50 ?
Minecraft is better
Why am I watching this when I don’t even play over watch
WOW I just got an EPIC potg!!! Come check it out on my channel ???
'insane Skill or Dumb luck' 3:33 Common fucking sense, I see an enemy, I attack said enemy 3:47 Animation was already cast, neither luck nor skill, the stun simply hit to late, same with your melee cancel, at a certain point you can't stop 3:59 Not really lucky again, just doomfists Horrible decision making, he saw the Mei spam and still went for a Pick. 4:12 now i don't know the Skill level of this player, but anyone with some experience on mei or at least knowledge on the Duration of meis abilities could have predicted it 4:20 Obvious Path choosing, nice Prediction tho Overall, non of this was 'luck' based or insanely skilled. most of it was simply Possible by using your fucking brain
I need this song on 2:50!
yeeee, My highlight is shown in Dabacabb, I promise send more and more :D
sound effect at 8:26 please
Does evreyone want 2 be on the dabafan fan of the day bit people do this 2 be featured and then it will be me lol
0:20 Top 10 anime betrayals.
HAPPY 600TH!
???? ???? ??? ????
no offense bu these videos are repetitive, first with the mercy killing someone, and she being killed, with that Stupid flute music, and then are you ready for a miracle, then with the awesome plays, i would subscribe if you did things different.
600 Episodes of Dabacabb. I hope this never ends.
Me as widowmaker: I don't miss ( missed a shot ) I missed ( Gets eliminated by another widowmaker )

Dabacab Nice video great work are you best youtuber with content top Moments
Dabacabb is a fan of equal rights. He takes videos from console and low grade pcs alike.

The moment you realize you have been in a video over 10 times.
3:34 music ?
OMG MY HIGHLIGHT! :D THANK YOU DABACABB!!! Holy heck, alone in a room with Doomfist...how the hell did I survive that.

There’s a special place in Hell for DPS Moira’s
I have recently started youtube and would really appreciate if you guys could check me out and drop a sub. Also, advice and criticism is very welcome, I'm still trying to figure out everything.

Wow 1 like
Welp there goes my chance at being first
Do you think this hero idea is good? Name: unknown Primary fire: crossbow on head shot sets enemy on fire (does not do extra damage and insta kill like hanzo and widow when they head shot) Ability 1: shoots an arrow which explodes on impact leaving a pool of fire on the floor Ability 2: shoots an arrow which leaves fire behind it as it travels Ultimate : shoots alot of fire arrows in the sky over a large area, dealing damage and setting that area on fire.
