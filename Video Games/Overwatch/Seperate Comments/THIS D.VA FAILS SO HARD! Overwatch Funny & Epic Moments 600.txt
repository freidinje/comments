05:04 typical moiras
7:32 Music "resolution warptech ft. cory friesenhan"
You better get out of the way!
Song on 3:36 Cut & Shut - Jungle hook
8:15 anyone notice how moira was waiting for health when she couldvr used for heal orb but used a damage orb to protect her wtff
music at 3:50 ?
Never trust a Mei, even if she is on your team.
GG
That tasty planet music brings back so many memory's
0:56 nice aimbot :D
"Nerf this" "No nerf this" Jeff heavily sweating Nerfs Mercy
Congrats on 600!, What song is that at 2:50 ?
Minecraft is better
Why am I watching this when I don’t even play over watch
WOW I just got an EPIC potg!!! Come check it out on my channel ???
'insane Skill or Dumb luck' 3:33 Common fucking sense, I see an enemy, I attack said enemy 3:47 Animation was already cast, neither luck nor skill, the stun simply hit to late, same with your melee cancel, at a certain point you can't stop 3:59 Not really lucky again, just doomfists Horrible decision making, he saw the Mei spam and still went for a Pick. 4:12 now i don't know the Skill level of this player, but anyone with some experience on mei or at least knowledge on the Duration of meis abilities could have predicted it 4:20 Obvious Path choosing, nice Prediction tho Overall, non of this was 'luck' based or insanely skilled. most of it was simply Possible by using your fucking brain
I need this song on 2:50!
yeeee, My highlight is shown in Dabacabb, I promise send more and more :D
sound effect at 8:26 please
Does evreyone want 2 be on the dabafan fan of the day bit people do this 2 be featured and then it will be me lol
0:20 Top 10 anime betrayals.
HAPPY 600TH!
???? ???? ??? ????
no offense bu these videos are repetitive, first with the mercy killing someone, and she being killed, with that Stupid flute music, and then are you ready for a miracle, then with the awesome plays, i would subscribe if you did things different.
600 Episodes of Dabacabb. I hope this never ends.
Me as widowmaker: I don't miss ( missed a shot ) I missed ( Gets eliminated by another widowmaker )

6:00 what actually happened here?!?!?!
Dabacab Nice video great work are you best youtuber with content top Moments
Dabacabb is a fan of equal rights. He takes videos from console and low grade pcs alike.
The good old silver border for this series now
The moment you realize you have been in a video over 10 times.
3:34 music ?
OMG MY HIGHLIGHT! :D THANK YOU DABACABB!!! Holy heck, alone in a room with Doomfist...how the hell did I survive that.
When you have never been dabafan of the day and you'e been around since episode 20 :(
Your vids are so funny, it was hard for to not laugh at any of them!!!! Love your channel!!!!
everytime i watch a console clip it just reminds me how garbage 90% are
wow 600 episodes, nice <3
There’s a special place in Hell for DPS Moira’s
I have recently started youtube and would really appreciate if you guys could check me out and drop a sub. Also, advice and criticism is very welcome, I'm still trying to figure out everything.

My main fear playing Overwatch is that I'll end up in one of these videos... :-P
Battle Mercy POTGs aren't worth shit if team mates die because of it, or won't get rezzed.

Wow 1 like
Welp there goes my chance at being first
Do you think this hero idea is good? Name: unknown Primary fire: crossbow on head shot sets enemy on fire (does not do extra damage and insta kill like hanzo and widow when they head shot) Ability 1: shoots an arrow which explodes on impact leaving a pool of fire on the floor Ability 2: shoots an arrow which leaves fire behind it as it travels Ultimate : shoots alot of fire arrows in the sky over a large area, dealing damage and setting that area on fire.
First

#600!
