Hacktuber, YOU ARE SO TALENTED AND CREATIVE! You have inspired me to try and share some of my ideas with people on my YouTube channel, thank you for all your videos and time you have put into them!
wasted 1 channel audio to make a Bluetooth speaker? i don't think that was good idea.. you should buy class D 5v simple amplifier.. put them 2 speaker are more better..
hahaha.. the last mystery box was no security.. cause people will try to on all at once 1st.. useless to put fake switch but it's do nothing..
should of used a better speaker that one sucks ass
where we get bluetooth module
the first one is fake all
?????????
Why would you need a 5 volt regulator when a USB port can maximally output 5v?? That makes no sense

Bluetooth is not connected up,sucessfully
Why we didn't use direct current
Not in detail....who'll tell about programming..ur dad?
You should make that last combination lock so that the other two switches aren't useless. the way you have it if someone presses on all the switches it still goes threw but if you were to put the other switches so that they would short the circuit and have a braker throw if they mess it up and keep it locked then you can keep it so that they cant just guess it.
are you a mad??? you are saying that check the link below but where is your link???
1st model is using $2 Bluetooth, but why don't buy cheap class D amplifier as well? both using 5V input..
very nice
this americanhacker!!!!
the security lock system is very bad idea.. easily i can switch all ON... you shuld use 2 line switchs and connect all switchs..

hi i dont understand why all the switches in the electromagnet lock? at first i thought it was to make it hard to unlock but then i seen you put 3 upside down and 3 the other way so someone can simply see choose the 3 that are the same way facing the same direction and its done you unlocked it hehe.
So by adding a microphone at time =5:44 sec. The mic pick up the music and converts it into impulses?? How that that work?
