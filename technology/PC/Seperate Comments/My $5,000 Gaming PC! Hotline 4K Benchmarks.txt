hold up, did he just call 1440p 2K?
do you have time to talk about building workstation PC for 3d animation?
Spend 5k on a pc with two 980ti’s....
the only sound i heard during the fan noise test was only my own fans
Fuck is sexy
Watching this in 2017 and by today's standards your PC is slow lol the new Core i9 processors can get you up to 8k gaming now lol crazy stuff imagine in 5 years time how advanced PCs will be again
fast forward to 2017 and a basic mid range gaming pc is better than this ! Gots ta loves the pc gamingz :D
4K Roblox?
This pc is 5x the cost of mine....... my god....
nu esti pasionat de nimic , esti un pusti arogant care crede ca a descoperit roata din/pe banii parintilor ...
Pc case?
whats the name of that computer case?
it is funny how 980ti s on sli got similar fps with one 1080. a few years down the line we will treat the 1080ti like it is a decent gpu lol
Are you using pepto bismol to cool your pc?
Salut . Observ ca esti pasionat de hackintosh. Putem discuta pe tema aceasta ? eventual prin mai sau chiar prin telefon. Merci
You know the drill But do you know the screwdriver?
Lol how now just one 1080ti or even 1080 performs like this
I know i'm, uh, late, but why does Metro have a lower minimum frame rate at 1080p then at 4k?
2:37 That's my case in the background!
the performance is not as good as my 4x 1080 sli
Oh wait...this was made in 2015...before the i7-7770k and Quadro...
What I would change is if you got a i7-7770k and a Quadro with 24 Gigs of VRAM. You only need one montior.
case?
was wonderinf what led strip you used?
how did you make the graphs?
This ni??????a has a $5k pc. I'm dreaming for a $500 budget gaming pc :/
Can someone tell me of this is a good pc im new to pc gaming Motherboard- MSI gaming intel B250 LGA 1151 DDR4 ATX Graphics Card- MSI GTX 1050 gaming X 2G CPU- Intel core I5-7600K LGA 1151 CPU Cooler- Cooler Master Hyper 212 evo RAM- 16Gb (2 X 8Gb) G.Skill Aegis DDR4 PC4-24000 3000MHz Hard drive- Seagate 2Tb BarraCuda SETA Power supply- EVGA 600 B1, 80+ Bronze 600W Case- Corsair carbide Clear 400C compact Mid-tower case
So how does this pc handle Arma 3?
Yes tacos
S E XXXXX Y!!!!
A E S T H E T I C S
Fridged 36 degree Celsius?
what is the`case?
its just to much
I just wonder how he got an idle of 19C that's 65 degrees Fahrenheit! Living in in California that means he must be running the Air Conditioning non stop.
that is not very good I can make a 3000 dollar pc better he put way to much on a gpu that sucks and you could buy one gpu that is better for the same as the both of those
I am the only one who noticed the audiojungle mark on the beginning of the audio? :D Spends 5000 dollar on a pc and dont have 10 dollar for a sound clip... Well done... :D
Can someone please tell me the name of the case he has?
TACOOOOOOOSSS!!!
Hi Kyle, I have almost exact same pc rig (except the CPU, and RAM) and I wanted to ask you are you still using this rig for your daily usage? If yes, have you had any problems with it (USB 3.0 issues, BIOS and etc.) Thanx for answering and good luck!
Can it run Minecraft at above 60 FPS though?
Can it run minecraft at 30fps ?
Can it run minecraft at 30fps ?
what´s his tower?
ahhh Awesome sauce was a thing
Video seen in 2045 Like!
Lol as he let us listen to background noise a train passed my house ??????
This is the machine from my dreams. Literally. I have a shitty budget build with an i3 processor, 4gb of RAM running a GTX 950. I actually just had a dream last night that I came home from school, sat down at my computer. And something seemed different about it. I was running this EXACT build, but all the flashy colors were blue. Along with the glass being tinted blue. I had an 18 button MMO mouse with a flashy mechanical keyboard. And I got a new monitor that does 1440p. I also got a Playstation 4 plugged into the same monitor and simply needed to turn on to play it. Life was good. Until I woke up. Then I looked over to my left... and there it was... shitty i3 950 4gb RAM. Full specs: GPU: MSI GTX 950 2gb MEMORY: 4gb of RAM CPU: Intel(r) Core i3 520 Storage: 1tb hard drive + 100gb SSD FPS: Due to lack of ram and cheap i3 processor, I bottleneck the performance of the 950, badly. So I generally, on games like The Witcher 3 and Battlefield 1, get around 40 FPS on the middle-low settings.
Negative air pressure?
why only 16gb or ram
that expensive cpu bottleneck tho
bending?
You should've picked a better case but other than that pretty good.
i know when dat "hotline" bling
i only get 11 to 16 fps on pay day 2 on 720p not even 1080p and you guys want 100+ fps on 4 k craaazy
oh man that watercooling makes me wet
I guess you can say he has hotline bling.
Thanks for this series, I'm just now getting interested in building a water cooled system and this was a great reference for what to expect.
Best looking case is c21 versa RGB with strix gpu inside and water)
ayy, uploaded on my birthday!
2x Titan Xp are better
Time for a revamp
Yo I'm making a 800$ pc build. It this a good pc for gaming? https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Oasis_Angel/saved/Lr9P6h
I like how in the intro hes wearing a linus tech tips t-shirt lol
Whats the pc case? its not in the part list
Win
whats the case plz reply
Personally i would upgrade to a 7700k but thats just me.
Tacos???
can it play chess at 15 fps?
why not a titan x pascal
But can it run Minesweeper?
Can i have it plz
tacos ;)
I can buy a better computer for cheaper.
yeah msaa is very taxing
its bad that you have a 19ºC idle temperature as moisture will build up on the die
Tacos.
Very nice rig!! Congrats on the build. Very nice indeed
But... why. My $550 pc can run any game very smoothly.
I FUCKING LOVE THAT GAME.
I wish i have that huhuhu in the future ill have that????
whats the case name
cpu botleneck? mmhhmhhh
what case is he using?
I can't hear your PC's sound over how loud mine is...
TACOS
Can someone tell me what Res/Pump he is using?
max temps on package 98°C? O.o 2:00
It's better the fractal r5 or the s for watercooling?
is it ironic that i could not hear his fan noise over the sound of my own computers fan noise.
1440p is not the same thing as 2k
Excellent Video! If you have time could you please check out my vid as well?
But... is it vr ready
i cant tell if its my laptop or the 5000$ pc did i mention the hard drive
Wait can it run candy crush ?
How come I don't see the Zotac GTX 1080 AMP Extreme on any builds? They are currently(as of December 13th 2016) the most powerful(correct me if I'm wrong) GTX 1080 on the market and maybe the most powerful gaming graphics card on the market.
You know that SLI bridge is a bottleneck. I upgraded to better SLI bridge and saw a noticeable improvement. 10-20%
But can it run roblox at 10 FPS????
but can it run minesweeper at 5 fps ?
do you have a degree or certification or anything like that for pc building?
when you did the sounds of your pc all i could hear were the roars from mine...
lol can't hear your computer in the video over mine.
ahhhhhhh why did you use plastic brackets in your cooling?!
Try This Parts https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dLXCFd This is my Build Now Can Run Any AAA Games in Very High to Ultra on 1080p 1440p and 4K No Issues Shipping: $15.61 Total: $5156.18
Tacos? lmao, awesome video man. Thinking of making myself a custom water cooled rig with SLI 1080's, a little insane but should be almost future proof :P Keep at it!
Separate bat poster svznxgy extra alien diamond heavily
6:11 Yeah! Tacos!
you have too much money
my pc is loud lik ae jet engine.
But can it run pong?
at such budget I would have went for Intel i7 6800k or 6850x and titan x
He swearing Linus tech tips short
THESE ARE THE BEST RATED PERFORMANCE GAMING LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS http://www.originpc.com/?aid=3069
couldnt hear the PC mine was too loud.....
Tacos?
What case is that
was the mic on when the system was underload. My hp pavilion was louder
What case did he use?
jeeeeezzass, I'm jealous :<
That's still nothing.
does anyone know the pomp/res he's using i cant find it in the parts lists. i know he mentioned it in the first one but still cant find the exact one. If anyone could give me a link that would be great.
1:11 I thought there was 32gb of DDR4 ram?
dont you think 16 ps4s will do a little better job?
What chassis is that?
but can it run arma 3? lol
I bet I can run minecraft
bet you got the bequiet fans
la consentida #samsung
i think 1440p is the sweet spot for gaming you get the high frame rate with great visuals the leap from 1080p to 1440p is pretty noticeable but if i look from 1440p to 4k its not nearly as noticeable
7 minutes is a bit much for an ad
whats the thing that is like an sli bridge but is used for wtercooling.PLS HELP
Question why didn't you go for 2 1080's?
what the point of custom water cooling if CPU still gets almost 100c?
Cool pc dude but can it run Crysis
sorry guys stop trying to act just get to the point......
But can it run Stick Rpg at 10 fps?
those temperatures are kind of high... i have, on a corsair cooler (h100i gtx), a 5820k @ 4.3GHz and it idles at 28-32 C, regular gaming load at 40-45 C and full stress test peak of 60 C after many hours. my single 980ti hybrid from evga runs at identical temps in similar situations to the cpu, though the 980ti is at its stock overclock, sometimes cooler than the cpu since it is stock. i have a second 980ti hybrid shipped om its way but i know it will the same temps, after all these all have closed loops. maybe that loop you have is not enough for an overclocked 5960x and two 980ti's. Your system is a little quieter though. but i also have a lot more fans.
probably can't run crysis 1
Can I play minesweep on it ?
Those benchmarks are a fucking lie, even 1080's in 2x sli get an average of arround 60fps in most 4k games and he's not even using that good of cards in his system and is claiming bullshit results.
am I the only one who always thought 4k was 1440p??
They don't call it "4K" because of the pixels. They call it "4K" because that's how much money you shell out to get a PC that can run it.
wait so can this run minecraft?
Does he have trues?
What case is this? Sweet build by the way!
would this pc run arma 3 and gta v on high +60fps cause im moving from console to pc: -intel core i5-6600k 3.5gh -cooler master cpu cooler -16gb ripjaw ram -msi geforce 970 or 1060 (not sure which one) -650w 80+ gold power supply
Im gonna build this machine, so that i can run minsweeper at 2.6 fps
I watched this video just to know which computer case he used and he didn't mentioned it even once.. ??.. Anybody else??
That dude in the start is in loads of tech videos for some reason. Like jayztwocents, that guy was there
Will minecraft work?
hey does anyone know what the name of the case is?
who's got the money for this?!?!? you have to be rich spend all of your savings lol but who really wants spend all of that?
0:19 wtf is that behind ?
Is that a LinusTechTips shirt that that guy had?
Why do people bother with HDD's with such a budget ,just use SSD's?
Awesome
Tacos?
what case is this?
I ate tacos for dinner
But can it run hotline miami...?
i have a 500$ pc that can run pretty much every game at ultra lol dont see the point of a 5k pc
you should of been able to get atleast +400 on the memory :P
why do people use water t water cool use coolant car or motorbike coolant
I dislike water cooling because the water pipes could breaks at any moment
You need better specs... This machine will barely run minecraft at 15fps
The 6950X is $1700!!!
I like dat colour
Awesome looking, and performing, pc!
Dumbass budget Looks for me actually bootz videq"when
Will it play LOL and CGSO & DOD ?
slam 2 gtx 1080s in sli in that build
I couldn't hear the sound test over my loud PC...
But can it play minesweeper?
Literally just picked up a GTX 960 for $140, best deal of my lifeeee
Your PC is colorful like bling I know when that Hotline Bling!
Do company sell pc made like that?
2:00 wow, my NH-D14 air cooler gets better temps... :0
ohh its my pc case :D
lol that guy from the start of the vid had a linus tech tips shirt
Pink liquid!!! I was wondering if you have build this PC for someone else.
is it capable of running minesweeper?
looks like the color scheme is based on the game hotline miami.
already slow, just 9 months later you need 1080s son.
tacosss

i liked the SOUND at idle and load! ITS SO RHYTHMIC
amazing setup !
can i have this pc? thx...
change the gpus with 2x gtx 1080s
I'm planning on doing a magneto-esk color theme on my build for a red mobo and memory was going to do 4 purple fans but was debating on doing 2 red 2 purple one of each as top exhaust and one of each as front intake. can't decide if I want to just go straight pruple and get a red led strip to highlight or mix match the colors and I'm losing my mind haha. I've tried looking for purple and red fan configuration but found nothing, I'm jot sure if the red will drown out the purple or vice versa, what do yall think?? would love some input x]
idiot test watch dogs then see the results I guarantee you will not be happy with the results
Why use liquid cooling?
Dude I think you uploaded this in the wrong website. This belongs on PornHub. Look at the curves,the pink color, that body! Kreygasm
i wish people making these awesome videos about watercooling would tell us how many of each fitting they used. i making almost the exact same system and have no idea what fittings to buy.
All i heard was my amd stock cooling fan spinning at 5000 rpm
u probably didn't see those extra frames on 4k.
you can get a 4k gaming pc for only $1500 now
but can it run minesweeper?
Burritos?
Witcher 3?
But can you run PONG?
What case is that
Kyle Hansen. Your list for epic nano PC on amazon is very well built and i'm thinking of ordering the whole list to make myself one! No sarcasm... obviously
hahaha im just noticing this now, but you don't have back fan :p
Did your wife see the expenses check yet?
Can it run club penguin at 10 fps ?
A high price pc and you run shitty FPS at 4k, not worth it.
That awkward moment when you watch this and your pc only has i5 650 and a gtx 470
My intel hd 3000 is 3000 times better than your build
I didn't know your second name was Hansen Kyle Hansen ??????
I'm curious. Is Fractal Design really good? I just bought the Design S case as my first part for building a PC (starting from scratch). Next up is the motherboard but I'm looking for good a good company that I can trust and stick with that doesn't over price the SH*T out of it's products.
lol get rekt'd by a 1080
Now time to replace the gpu to the 1080
You here about all these PCs and I just make do with my MacBook Pro
I literally have everything this computer had except the 980 gtx (Mine is 970), and the ssd (I have 128 ssd + 2 TB HDD 7200). And o bought mine for $1,000 lol...
;) Look at this guy asking me about tacos ;) I like tacos
Is that the shirt from linus tech tips?
I want it....
does it bling
I can dream
Upgrade to 32 gb ram
Glass tubing???
wuts the case
can it run hotline miami on low settings at 5 fps
what mobo is kyle using?
Ti*
I run 2 gtx 750 to in sli and I get nice frame rates
when kyle showed hotline's acoustics i could hear my computer's fans running while i had the headphones on XD
The question is: will it run minecraft?
Overall nice looking case. But I got to say: Dem 90 degree bends on the tubes are amazing.
what is that amazing case it is sitting in?
I feel he went weak on ram. should have gone for 32 gb
I really like your channel and I was wondering what pcs do you use on a daily basis, and what do you do with the ones that aren't in use? Do you keep them in display like ironman with his suits?
You used to call me on the cellphoneeee
"frigid 36 celcius" you do realize that's like 80 - 90 Fahrenheit right
DOEST IT RUN CLUB PENGUIN?
Did he say 16 gigs of ddr4?
What case is this
what is the brand of the your computer case? (Sorry I' m Turkish)
Ok I'm officially jelly. Lol. Nice build dude. Very sick.
I'm torn on what to do. I desperately need to upgrade my i7-3960x. I see you rocking the i7-5960x, but with broadwell coming out soon I don't know if I should wait for the deca core or go with this. I have seen a lot of good things from the 5960x but would broadwell be worth waiting for?
Enyo Essence on property
rose? bah
good to see my pc can handle 30 fps sometimes when lucky and usually around 20 fps... pfff
And here I am playing skyrim on lowest settings at 20 fps
can this run minesweeper????
replace your 980Tis with 1080s. alot better and no need to replace Ur psu. that is so convenient
My PC: Intel Core i7 4790k MSI GTX 960 4GB Asus Z97-A Motherboard 16GB Crucial DDR3 1866MHz Be Quiet! Dark Rock 3 Cooler 5TB Seagate Barracuda Hard drive Samsung 850 Evo 250GB Ssd Corsair CX600W power supply All packed in a White NZXT Noctis 450
What Reservoir is that?
yesssss tacos!
That is a lot of money for a computer. You could pay about only $1200 and get a computer that can run most games.
UPDATE THIS WITH GTX 1080s ASAP PLEASE. Thank you.
at 2:44 i can't hear something cause my computer sounds so much Dx lol
You own so my Titan x's and I'm sure go have a Titan z or 2... Why use and 980 ti SLI when you have the better gpu's??
Running twin 7950s, manages 4k alright. Latest amd beta drivers have them running together much more smoothly. It used to run ok with the exception of the odd update that didn't agree with xfire. GTAV runs quite well at 4k but naturally with old cards it requires fiddling. Nice to see software support for a card thats close to 4 years old now.
Can someone please tell me the name of the pump and reservoir combo? My son needs it for his upcoming water cooled build, in the Define S.
Gotta love him sitting there in an LTT shirt...
Seriously can't find this pump/res combo. I ended up getting alphacool's all-in-one lighttower and an alphacool pump, but 1, they don't have enough room to stack because you can't mount the res vertically, and 2 I'm pretty sure they left out the plug that blocks the huge hole on the side where you would mount a pump. I'm about ready to ditch the pump/res that I have, but can't find this combo anywhere. HALP PLS!!!
But it look's like a box? why pink? where is cool looking PC Gaming design???
Can it run minesweeper?
I hate how no matter what you get, there is always something to make it look bad. But i guess that is the way it is.
Is it possible I can run half life 1 at 10fps
Why PINK!
What is the name of the pump and reservoir combo?
60 fps gaming is so 2012, 144 hz is the future.
"CPU bottlenecking", what cpu do you have? i7 5960x..............
I have seen some water cooling pc's EXPENSIVE AS FUCK
would 2 960s in sli run games in 4K?
spill a glass of coke on it, "there goes my bank account
What is the case?
TACOS!!!!!!!
if you want swag gameplays check my channel out and subscribe
But will it run Crysis?
Dude you don't need a so expensive PC you can get a PC that runs every game on 60 fps for a 1000 bucks
what is the case?
Mmmmmmm Tacos
can this run minecraft? I might ask for this for christmas if it can
Can someone recommend a simple desk for dual monitors?
I bought all the parts for this build to play Minecraft.. Overkill? I think not!
MUST BE NICE!!!!!!!!!!!!
retro ?
Just wondering can I play Minecraft on high settings? And what monitor is best for playing Minecraft and club penguin? All advice is helpful :)
During the acoustics test, I only heard my loud ass H100i GTX lmao
what's that difference between custom water cooling and the ready made cooling kits like the ones that corsair provides for cooling CPUs and GPUs.
My PC would score ~200 on 3DMark Firestrike on 720p.......
Only two 980 tis in SLI? What a fockin' scrub. But in all seriousness, how the hell is this build so quiet? My room's ceiling fan is noisier 3:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS COMPUTER TALK ;_;
whats Cable?
I'm fairly new to PC gaming and I just bought a desktop with these specs: Processor & Memory: Intel® Core i7-6700 Processor 3.4GHz 16GB DDR4 2133MHz RAM Drives: 1TB 7200RPM SATA3 Hard Drive DVD-RW (Writes to DVD/CD) Operating System: Microsoft® Windows 10 (64-bit) Graphics & Video: 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 Graphics Communications: 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Audio: Integrated High Definition 7.1 Channel Audio Processing Keyboard & Mouse: USB Keyboard USB Mouse Expandability (Total Slots): 2x 5.25" External 1x 3.5" External 3x 3.5" Internal 2X 2.5" Internal 1x PCI-E x16 1x PCI-E x1 2x DIMM 288-pin Ports & Slots: 1x PS/2 Style 4x USB 3.0 4x USB 2.0 1x LAN Port 3x Audio Jacks Additional Information: Power Supply: 600W Dimensions : 19.9” x 8.2” x 18.5” Do you recommend upgrading anything?
Tacos
Wait, isn't bottle necking at this top end PC level due to the poor software utilisation of the hardware? I have heard some games run shit on 4k even if you have 4x titans in SLI. - none of the games he tested if any for that matter are designed with 4k in mind. Probably has something to do with '3d effects' scaling differently relative to the increase in resolution too.
How come his define r5 has a much larger window than the usual window?
Water cooling is a damn waste of money ! Just pick up a Noctua NH-D15
All I heard during the audio sample was my computer fan and cpu whizzing...
Do you sellf this? LOL
My rig: GPU: GTX 970 FTW CPU: Intel Core i5 6600k (Overclocked to 4.5GHz) Motherboard: Asus Z170-A RAM: 8GB Kingston HyperX Fury DDR4 2133MHz Case: NZXT Phantom 240 CPU Cooler: Cooler Master TX3 EVO
what case it that?
what graphiccard do you think is needed to play on a 21/9 1440p monitor? right now i have a 144hz 1080 normal 16/9 monitor, but i really want one the Ultrawide monitors, so do thing i need a 980ti or two of those to play on it? i have a 980, so not a big deal for one 980ti, but two?...
Lol in 2369 we use organic matter to compute data. None of this ancient quantum computing or watercooled nonsense. And I'm here to tell you that we could have done it thousands of years ago too :/ Hell you could do it right now if you wanted to, all you need is a baking tray, horse urine, a dead rat and a box of lemons.
this is why ppl think pc gaming cost to much to get into. why would you need to spend 5000 on a computer. my $600 rig is amazing and is the strongest rig that anyone I know owns.
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Hodgie1231/saved/f8DG3C I was wondering if this is a good build for playing fallout 4,rainbow six siege,and bo3.
im happy to see that he didn't pick titan x 980 TI FTW!!!!!!!!
Yes to tacos, but even that won't make me cozy up to the Pepto-pink theme of this system. That said, the color is the only thing I don't love about this system. Design, components, everything, it looks really good, everything but the pepto... I also say that 4K is overrated, especially compared to 3440x1440 gaming on 34" curves. I know their prices are ridiculous, but so is the experience of gaming on that sweet mother of a monitor.
78 fps playable ahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahah i barely get 40fps in minecraft
what case is that?
If you have enough money to get a £5k PC, you could have got a better case xD
$5000 is 5K not 4K !!!
shes kinda really ugly for $5000
the start is how advertisement should be done!!!!!
Great vid bro plus 1 sub ... seriously nice hotline!great qualiy video!
Damn that hotline make me blink!
Whats the pump res combo model?
tacos? lol
So does this build do email!
I couldnt tell how quiet your PC was, because mine was being really loud... I hate california in the summer.
what case is that
It's fine.
can this play runescape 800x600 60fps max settings?
Now my GT 650M is insecure of itself :(.
WHATS THE POINT WHEN THEY BUILD GAMES ON XBOX/PS . all games still look like shit
Will that run Minecraft? or Terraria?
taco, taco
imyou have the best videos in computer entertainment you would probably tie with austin evans and linus and one question what degree do you have ??
does the define S window panel fit on an R5?
What has been your experience with the motherboard sabertooth so far? It is better than the "ASUS X99-PRO" or "ASUS RAMPAGE V EXTREME"?
Man, I'm addicted to your videos.
It's ok intel celeron 1.5ghz you can run lowest settings in 5ps in my heart
Can anyone recommend a good optical drive? I'm looking for a decent blu-ray player
TACOS

You have a problem with sequence of tubing. I don't know how is your sequence is? But as I see you feed CPU with a hot water because water that come out from GPU is hot. thats why you have 98 degree at 4.4GHz of CPU. So what you should to do change sequence Reservoir-> Radiator -> GPU --> Radiator --> CPU --> Reservoir I like color that you choose it is very nice and you choose very good hardware finally good job.
I wanna kill myself my graphics card is amd radeon 5450....
Whats the pump/res combo? Thanks :D
But can it run Club Penguin?
someone tell me please the pc case model
Tacos
A LinusTechTips shirt?
Im drooling all aver the place because im in my note 3
The guy at the beginning had a linus t shirt
MSI GTX 970 Gaming, 4GB GDDR5 or Gigabyte GTX 970 Gaming, 4GB GDDR5 wich is better???????
can you make one in $3000
LOL! This PC is way too expensive. I am building a machine using GTX 980 Ti 2-way SLI and really it's only 2720$ for a watercooled version
What are the advantages of playing at 4K?
"Run Minecraft and Roblox on it" - Some 10 year old probably
I overclocked my MSI GTX 980 Gaming 4G to +190 on the Core Clock and +550 on the Memory Clock with the stock MSI cooler. Never goes above 75 Celsius. Is this a good overclock? (fan speed on 55%)
A gép gyönyöru lett, és az eredmények?! Nem semmi. Szép munka!
A gép gyönyöru lett, és az eredmények?! Nem semmi. Szép munka!
i couldn't hear your computer over the sound of my computer
Dude was tryna Netflix and chill lowkey
IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLL
What case is he using ?
It's pink.
GTA V 80 fps with 2 980 ti? My ass!!! 50-70 Average maxed out!
At first I thought it was overkill due to the fact PCs way less could max out games then I looked at the part list and realized why .... The water cooling and the kind of storage he used .
Chuck Norris plays Crysis 4 at 8k 144fps with the integrated graphics of an intel 8080 8-bit CPU. One might ask, "Where is the integrated GPU on that 80s processor?" to which I reply, "Chuck Norris found it."
tacos
Tacos lol
Thats a gay computer.
Ill take jays 3 titans for 1000$ more
As crazy as it seems, I can't help but thinking that building crazy PC's is still a very affordable hobby. For $4000 you can pretty much get the fastest PC around. Yet a decent college degree cost $20000 per SEMESTER. All of a sudden, buying a gaming PC, let alone a console, seems like candy.
I vote tacos
its funny how his videos get more views than subscribers on his channel each time
no avg fps. nice.
Lol. GT640 masterrace you fucking pigeons.
Can it run minesweeper at 4k ultra settings?
is gt730 is good for playing dota2 guys? does it have a high fps?
I like LinusTechTips better XD [just joking]
I heard my fathers desktop over that really loud pc
i have a 4k pc and i have 235fps on gta 5 ultra
It plays hotline bling a max
Can this computer run Minecraft at far rendering distance
LTT  T-shirt
Yes tacos
just want to ask, how do u earn that much money
What's with the LinusTechTips shirt that that guy was wearing in the beginning
My car is not worth $5,000 and I depend on it everyday...fuck i'm poor.
Could you show the price list?
Pascal should get us over 60fps@4k for most games... Volta will make 4k the new 1080p and bring us closer to 8k gaming...
wouldn't Just cause 3 be more demanding ?
lol for the sound test all I could hear was my own computer
A question...where would the money go on a $5000 build that was focused only on 1080p gaming?
what's the case called?
0:49 dat arm jiggle do
MAD TINGGGG
Just curious on what brand those dual monitors are and which 4k monitor you are using if neither of those 2 are 4k. Another great video as always. Really enjoy your channel
what kind of case is that?
PInk??? Ok then......¯\(?)/¯
What about CS:GO?
Hawt.
What Case Is That?
Would I be able to have a setup like this (including the water cooling) in an NZXT H440.
can u give me the aftermath of dota 2 ?
Imma just say this real quick.. I FREAKIN LOVE THIS CHANNEL! (mic drop)
Damn nice
Tacos?????
are you gay?
how do you get that ES chip?
Awesome Video Awesome Build
4K: AMD Radeon something x2 8 GB VDDR5 RAM each, and cooling and skylake cpu. Nothing else.
while watching the sound test using my headphones, my own pc was way louder
TACOOOOOOS
Yeah yeah, but it can run Hotline Miami? LOL
I vote yes for tacos
idk what it is about this guy but he makes me laugh every video he seems like a very chill person. thats all i have to say
I want it.
if anyone is wondering, i think the case is a NZXT S340
dude did u actually pay 5000? or r u just assuming the cost. thats a ridiculous price for the performance boost you're getting. im running an r9 390x on an i7 4790 with 32gb of cas 8 ddr3 1600 a cpl ssd's and a 3tb bare drive and get close to the performance you get. and i probably payed about 650, 700 max to build it. i get probably like a 10 frame difference from your rig. and thats with aa on and ultra settings. just sayin.
Real men don't feel the need to use pink coolant.
The fact that a $5000 PC can't even manage to surmount the FPS dips in GTAV really says something about the quality of the port.
Hello, wat for Fitting do you use for the PETG. you wrote only the Flex tube fittings down i dont think so they working for the PETG aswell.. iam searching this fittings but can not find.
LTT SHIRT!!!
Thumbs up, because tacos.

5960k bottlenecking ur gpus?!?! holy crap
Intel sucks ass.
ummm... tacos! wait what???
Tattoo ,
can it run dayz though?
To pink uaghhhhh so ugly
No buy intel for gaming buy amd is very best for gaming. Amd is very best processor on time very fast very speed very power full buy now you best cpu just do it !
My dad can get CPUs for free so what is better for gaming 6700k or 5960xeveryone says differently
what's the best gpu for $200
4:12 you misspelled tessellation.
Rofl he has gauges.
you earned my subscription through tacos lmao
Damn beastly PC.
Awesome build but red/black would've given a better look pink seems a bit too bright
What case is that?
but can it run minesweeper
Its so pretty, i wanted a pink n black color scheme to but I had to get an rog board soooooo.....I cry, sick bends
5k pc? And mine was 2k and has better parts than yours ?
tacos
But will it play minesweeper at 240p lowest settings?
are you can smells it my 9400gt is geting toast
.
0:49 jiggle those wings
can anyone tell me the parts that he is used in the watercooled system ? all of them
$5,000..............
i thought i was doing good with my new 970, and my custom built $1300 computer...
The script and actor playing at the beginning ad reminds me one of those cheap porn movies
bling
Im suprised nobody commented to the Taco? Tacos? Yes please!
WHAT CASE IS THAT?
damn if that pc was green themed i would fall in love with it
what case is that?
KYle could you please list the amount of each fitting
I prefer to be ignorant and play everything at 1080p, what you dont know .. you dont miss.
GTA 5 is an amazing PC port
can this run minecraft at 144p 3 fps ?
guys i have one question on the game debate i checked for the cs:go for my specs and it says i can play on ultra at 30 fps wtf and when i had cs:go on med i had 30 fps with dropping of 3 to 4 ans specs are down motherboard:ASUS A58M-K gpu inetagetd:r5 7400k cpu is:AMD A6 X2 7400K black edition wich i have no clue what that means and memroy 4gb wich 2.97 is free now please help me guys
I built a 12000$ gaming pc..... Where I got the money? I got a small loan of a million dollars...
id rather buy a motorcycle with 5000 much more fun than a overpriced computer for browsing porn and facebook
Where does he get his money? Just his job?
the ltt shirt tho
Can anybody tell me the perfect build that can run csgo and tf2 at least 60 fps on mid-high settings?
But if you run two titan Z in SLI, and two 5960x it should easily crush crysis 3 right? RIGHT?
oh crap i just realized i wasnt subscribed. all this time ive been watching your videos because they were just showing up in my recommendation tab. let me go subscribe right quick
What case is that?
The benchmarks were pretty surprising to me. Even with 1 980ti and an i7 4790k with no overclocking, I was getting similar framerates in 1080p in Metro Last Light. But with 2x SSAA...
pascal cards will bring 4k to the forefront.
totally unnecessary to have to spend $5000 .if u have the money go for it.. you can still do perfectly fine with a less expensive pc
Gonna guess it was based off of Hotline Miami??
its a pretty cool pc but 1 quistion of all the colours you could pick why pink?
did anyone else sing hotline bling when he said "hotline"?
That pink is absurd lol, yuck. I don't know how this thing is $5,000 as the pc build in my about section of my profile came out to around $1,400 and runs games very well at 1080p. If you are a 4k snob then yeah that's a major point to make for this build, but I'm not. Was a cool video if not entirely unnecessary and unrealistic. Always neat to see expensive pc builds as someone who loves gaming rigs and pc gaming.
Does anyone know what tower case he has on this build
IMHO, definitely chimichangas!!
why did the console gamer cross the road? to render the building on the other side.
Is there space for a 120mm radiator at the back with this setup?
fps 120over and laptop spoil?
Hey Kyle how is the overclocking on the Sabertooth board? you should post an overclocking guide !!! Oh and what is your opinion on the oc tuner function in the sabertooth board

So I might be building a computer here soon. Is Windows 8 compatible with most games people play? (mainly focused on csgo) plus i been shopping around literally all of the computers have windows 8 or 10 so i might just go to the pc shop and have them help me build one
If you like games an like to watch other ppl play please view n follow my Twitch i do a bunch of steam give aways an more to all my viewers add me http://www.twitch.tv/reeeebzz im on an streaming daily an play a bunch of games Thank you!

I wanna go and cry in a corner. I don't even have a 500$ Gaming Pc, if you could even say that it would be a gaming one. :( My laptop sucks.
Yes tacos!
A single NVIDIA PASCAL will be enough for 4k AND that day is coming soon AND the 980ti SLI will be forgotten
TACOS!
TACO!
the only thing i could hear in the sound test was my own pc lmao
Yay, Tacos!
ps4 way better
I have got the asus R9 270 2gb, I am gonna buy the msi gtx 970 4gb, Is that good enough for playing games with high settings 40+ fps?
lol I couldn't hear your pc noise over my pc
Welfare intensifies
why is there a huge drop from average to minimum fps on gta v?
where do you get the costom cables from i wanna get some
that is the box model???
tacos
#overkill
if you spent 5k it should be hotline 5k??
Whats the name of the pc case
Ok know what? Everybody here listen we are trying to make pc's better to handle games right? Why don't we just make the games handle the pc's better? Taaaadaaaa
Great pc! One problem though, who the ** has 5,000 dollars!
#HotlineBling
every good PC who can get any game on 4k with 60 avg fps that is ok for me. For me ppl should not spend to much money just to have PC who cost like this one 5k LOL
dang, i cant even my antivirus without it slowing down (i dont even have a good enough video card and or graphics card to run minecraft) (pc model is the dell optiplex 360)
I've been wanting to get 2 monitors and a gaming desktop, but I'm 14 and a girl, so my dad thinks it's so horribly wrong that I love gaming =.= he's into building stuff though, so maybe if I ask him to help me build a desk top.. he would be alittle more ok with it x.x I really want to build one v.v
can it run CS:GO at 60 fps..... :D

Yeah my monitor is the Asus PG278Q. Definitely worth it wow.
My pc on minecraft makes 30fps so bad OMG
what GPU waterblock is that?
does it bling tho?
@FlameHead490 yeah at 720p. And when we say "it can tun at ultra" means it never goes below 60Fps
@khalid alhussein yes. I think the hotlne mght win.
@Backyzoo its because most of those games can only use 4cores. So in that case. A i7 4790K or 6700K would have been better
Holy shit
A 5960X is bottlenecked by 980 Ti SLI??? I'd think a processor of that tier wouldn't even come close to ever being bottle necked...
Can anyone recommend me a 1080p monitor for a budget of £100 - £120 please (with a hdmi port)? <3
Hey can u make me a amazing gaming ps pls and hit me up and we can talk
skunk works vs hotline! anyone want that?
Hotline Bling
And then a Car enter Your house And destroy It,although It saved your life (It really happened to someone)
You should build another PC and name it Bling. Then you can put the two PCs next to each other so it would be Hotline Bling.
6:37 is that a camera lens?
YES! I got the same case
Hey, It looks like you used acrylic tubing but the fittings you linked are for soft tubing. Is that correct?
Paid 700$ for parts, runs games at ultra just fine
Gay color, gay earnings, gay hipster glasses, gay voice, this planet lost a real type of MAN..... But damn bro goooooood PC!!
a pc for drake...hotline bling
heh I just built a pc with 4 980ti's :|
lol and i still have a gtx 645... ;-; help me
I like tacos.
I KNOW WHEN THAT HOTLINE BLING!
5000$ for a PC... damn... i'm jelly....
yeah, but can it run minesweeper?
Your mannerisms are extremely annoying. I couldn't finish the video.
BRO I COULD HEAR MY PC OVER YOUR PC
liquid cooling costs more than air cooling?
it can only mean one thing
What is the case?
taco plz ?
what gtx 980ti on brasil is r$ 5000 on usa is 1250$
1:43
LOL! I love A Christmas Carol!
I wish you would have shown some in game gameplay
why pink?
The pink pipes look whack, but otherwise that's some piece of work!
but can it run minesweeper?
You like the hotline miami too? Sneak a litlte herb in some night and play that game... Itll rape your mind.
That thing is insane!!
LOL i was trying to listen to the idle sounds and all i could hear was my computer
LOL what a peasant, my boy JayzTwoCents has 3 Titan X's and a 5960x even more overclocked.
Next gen should be promising for 1440, with AMD's new memory and Nvida always has something cooking up. Two generations and I think everyone will be on 1440-4k within 5 years.
tacos?
What case is that again?
When Pascal GPUs come out they will shit on the 980ti. Sorry mate you wasted money on these gpus.
PINK! PINK! i like it!
dude why 16gb of ram with a 5960x! 64gb would have been nice!
How does one get sponsored for building rigs like this? I've built myself a similar rig with a CaseLabs SMA8 case, spent around $7,000 which I paid for completely with my own money, no sponsored parts. Sponsored parts would allow me to continue to modify and improve this system (upgrading the GTX980 classifieds to Titan X's would be superb).
you used to call me on my.... oh never mind
Why didn't you benchmark Minecraft?!?
Update: landfill
i feel like it won't be able to handle the newer games at 4k.. like ass creed syndicate and such.
what is that pump?
"Hotline" bling ?
Your idle temp are clearly wrong, it is not possible for your CPU temps to be running cooler than the rooms ambient temperature. So unless your house is sitting at 53 degree F then your temp readings are wrong. Your CPU temps were probably more accurately sitting around 20-24 Celsius (room temp)
ewww pink awful
That's the best looking pc I've EVER seen
Everything is nice... but dat pink doe...

yes... tacos
i7 5960x ... cpu bottlenecking... how did i get here?
use nvidia titan x and GTX 980TI
Anyone know where i can get those led's lined along the side panel from?
Galaxy http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/XBdqCJ Galaxy V2 http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/yxjGpg These are 2 builds I made on pc part picker. They are my first builds and was wondering if their any good or if their complete crap, idk what's good and what's bad so any constructive criticism will be helpful thanks.
In the sound test, the only thing I heard was the sound of my HP Pavilion Slimline :)
Fractal gang?
That is beautiful.
He predicted hotline bling
Add more leds, doesn't have enough bling
4K is quite affordable already... My single R9 290 runs Dirt Rally on high settings at 4K.
@Awesomesauce Network Congrats to this nice project. Maybe I missed it somehow but is this the regular window panel or did you make it yourself? What PSU did you use? Thanks and keep on rockin'
Looks freakkking amazing....
that awkward moment when the only thing i could hear at 2:30 was my own computer sounding like a fighter jet taking off
Im sorta new to the building scene and this is what i have come up with... Case: NZXT H440 HDD: WD Red 2TB GPU: GTX 970 Power Supply: Corsair RM750X RAM: Hyper X Fury White 16GB DDR3 Motherboard: MSI Z97A CPU: Intel i7-4790 Quad Core Cooling: Corsair Hydro Series H105 Liquid CPU Cooler Is This a good rig? Can it handle The Witcher 3 maxed out or Skyrim with graphics mods at 60+ FPS?
Yeah. Tacos.
dude just wait till like spring 2016.. this pc will be obsolete via whatever the next gpu that comes out, it will have more power than this whole pc... hope you were sponsored.
"DYES" = Failure waiting to happen....
Only thing I heard from the fans were mine.
4K is still 2-3 years away from being affordable.
taco for sure.
Tacos.
What case is he using in this video? I looked in the description and clicked on the parts list but the case wasn't listed...

I just spent $5000 on this PC and tried Minecraft. It was horrendous, about 10 pixels every screen, sometimes even less. Disappointed.
Am I too late for the giveaway?
But the question is...can it run minesweeper?
i know when that "Hotline" bling, that can only mean one thing....
Drake: "I know when that hotline bling" Kyle: "My hotline doesn't bling I makes no bling no noise so shut the fu*k up drake"
Hitman runs faster on 1440p than 1080pHow does that work? :L

I couldn't hear it over my laptop.
And i know when that hotline bling That can only mean one thing
The Kool Aid man really threw me off.
For $5,000 this thing should do better than "incredibly pleased with results." For that kind of cash you should be saying something like "Holy Sh!t I can't believe how amazing this is!"
What do you do for work
Can it run minecraft at the lowest settings
wallaper link?
hot line bling
But can it run minesweeper?
When Pascal comes out next year two of those cards in SLI should take care of Crysis 3 as well as Metro 2033 at 4K.

ROG Swift PG27AQ or ROG Swift PG279Q please.
Where is the DVD-ROM DRIVE?
Pink color scheme?? That's just a little odd for a guy.
at this point, i am down for a ps4, wii u and new guitar. $5000 is overkill

meh my pc better
good luck maintaing that liquid Rig!
Tacos? :D
Hotline bling...
But does your Hotline bling? That could only mean one thing....
my pc runs crysis 3 at 1,000 fps at 5k.
My 5930k also feels some bottlenecking from the 2x 980Ti's :(. even bottlenecking on the 5960X is just rediculous lol... Custom watercooling for me is more of a hobby and keeping all my components cool and the overall system whisper quiet is just another bonus it provides :D.
Does it bling?
Drake would be so proud
That Hotline is really Blinging
damn that computer the hotline got some bling and that can only mean one thing
and i know when that HOTLINE BLING!
Man I really wanna see a 4k sli titan or 980 ti build with an even higher end processor than the 5960x

When listening for the Fans, i heard my brother Fap in his room. across the floor. through 2 doors. he either has a big problem or this pc doesnt even have any fans.
I don't think, people would spend so much on a pc. Most of them wouldn't!
You should go triple 980ti's
Taco.
as the price of 4k monitors drop over the next 2 years 4k gaming will become much more popular

Damn. Hotline Bling.
My PC is waaaayyyy slower than it was when I first got it 6 years ago (playing the same games and doing all the same things) what's caused it to slow up? How can I gain some speed back?

the ender dragon is a pc gamer.
Can this run minecraft at perhaps 25fps?
1440p 144hz is the best gaming.. Sure, there's 4k 60hz gaming, but it gets a little choppy and I'd prefer a higher refresh rate..  I'm sure once 4k screens hit 120-144hz and the gtx 1280 ti comes along, 4k will be there(at a very flashy price point)
OMG awesomesauce i love that pc black and pink is the stufff dood.
what about 720p?
Why did you choose Haswell-E over a Skylake??
Case?
Such a badass PC. Really digging the colors a lot. Wish I would've seen this before I started my build. I went with the typical red/black color scheme with a hint of gold lol
+Awesomesauce Network Can you give a count on the fittings you used? Some of them are actually quite hard to decipher based on your video work.
all I can afford in this video are those nachos :'D
Turnips
Hey is this a good build?? Would it get to hot? Do I need a cooler? And any other advice would be awesome, it's my first build so i don't know to much. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/QG6tGX
SELLOUT
I can't wait for 4k movies.
is that case the fractal define S?
everything I have ever owned doesn't even account for fraction of the price of that...that thing
How much out of the $5K is allocated for the custom watercooling? b/c the 2x980TI is about $1k each here in Canada. Do you think it would perform similar with an AIO ?
Checkout and subscribe to my channel. Thanks
Checkout and subscribe to my channel. Thanks.
My mate mixed universal indicator, indigo carmine and something else (I'm not too sure) and his water cooling is rainbow. Actually
That thing is pure sex.
Can it run csgo? xDDDDD
why do we people keep looking at stuff that we will never afford?
dude i just heared my own pc when you were showing the noise levels
2017 will be the year of the 4k. It's just gonna take another 2 years for people to upgrade their setups for 4k.
i didnt saw how many gtx 980ti were there? 2 or 3 ?
I own this Fractal Design case. One of the most elegant and beautiful (and though-out) towers out there.
How you get those power cables to be so clean inside case?! Do you use some holds?
i think i just came xD
still too much $ for the dawm 4k. I will stick with my 2k config. for the moment which is more than fine, and upgrade to full 4k in a year or so...
Which led strips did you get?
Hotline blinggggg
People buy a car for 5000$ :O
how much fps do you get in CSGO? hahaha
Tacos? Tacos.
This PC can run Ark and Battlefield 4? Motherboard – MSI Socket AM3+/AMD 760G/DDR3  Graphic Card – Club 3D R9 270  Processor – AMD FX-6300 6-Core Processor Black Edition  RAM – Crucial 8GB Single DDR3  Hard Disk – Seagate 1TB Desktop HDD SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache  CD Drive – Samsung SATA 1.5 Gb-s Optical Drive  Power Supply –EVGA 500W
okay i need to get this straight... 1440p,60hz and 4ms or 144hz and 1ms at 1080p
I love my 750ti it's been giving solid fps at great settings for over a year now!;)
How are you able to overclock your memory with the new drivers? I have 2 GTX 980s in SLI, but for some reason, neither MSI Afterburner nor EVGA PrecisionX can overclock the memory. I click apply, and the number reverts to zero. This happens on both 355.82 and 355.98.

what is the case name?
That PC used to call me on my cell phone
Why do I watch videos of things i could never have....
+ Awesomesauce Network how are your fans configured? From my angle view I can only see 3 fans on top of the case all exhausting airflow, wouldn't that create a negative air pressure and be detrimental for your built causing dust to be taken in from everywhere you don't want compensating the negative air pressure?
The backplate u used for 980 Ti is from Titan X?
what leds did you use?
s this build good? If not please tell me what to change Intel Core i5-4460 with Cooler - MSI B85M-P33-V3 Motherboard - 8GB 1600Mhz hyperX Fury DDR3 (1x8GB) - Geforce GTX960 GPU 2GB GDDR5 - Seagate 1TB 7200RPM - Enermax Fulmo. Q - 2x 120mm - with 500W Enermax NAXN Power Supply Show less
why no hotline miami benchmark?
Most all of these best video games could get better to incredible benchmarks if they optimized them better, but they're in kahoots with the video card makers, they get a kickback, this is just like viruses with the anti-virus companies! Did you know they sell your information? Here's just one, http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/19/avg-privacy-policy-update/ These anti-virus companies not only sell your information, they create a ton of viruses, consider it job security! Microsoft should be able to fix its own software and it can, but this would put third party software vendors out of business so Microsoft allows them to do it for the kickback and this is only a couple things, it's truly never ending
of course it's worth it. Who needs cooling, it looks sexy af
But can it run Minecraft..?
cool. I'm working on my first water cooled PC as well. It's called the imperius
Which Reservoir is that ?
19ºC? Were you on the freezer?
I wish I could start building and repairing computers as a job right away, but the only problem I have with it is still needing to go to school. I love working with computers and always manage to miraculously solve a problem if I put my mind to it strongly enough (which I do), but even in this small little town few people ever actually try to repair their computers let alone their cars that they drive around. With a car, after regular maintenance they only fix it if it breaks, or toss it and look for another if it's been too banged up by then. With a computer, though, they don't even try to actually fix it often times. They just keep using it until it quits, and then they take it directly to Sarcan and buy a new one. I saved one of these Sarcan machines that was being tossed, and I am typing on it right now...this Dell Latitude D530 looked brand new and even had a CD/DVD burner and everything. I asked them if they were going to toss it and they said yes. I asked to look at it and he let me...the computer was just lacking a hard drive. I paid him $20 for it, and now so many years down the road it's rocking an 80 GB SSD and EASILY keeping with $300, sometimes $400 laptops. The total cost of this machine was $120 including the used SSD I replaced the hard drive with.

Does anyone know what kind of case Kyle used? The window panel looks sick.
Do you sell pc ?
ITS SO PRETTY!
What pc case is that
For people that are saying custom water cooled PC's are not worth it, let me point a few things out to you. Yes it is very expensive BUT! I don't hear a leaf blower next to me when I game (Sometimes 2 leaf blowers in Sync) Very Pleasing to the eye Water pumps which Can be turned all the way down and be silent PWN. (Unable to get this on AIO's) The ability to set your fan curves on practically the lowest RPM possible, even Idling fans of you have enough Radiator for passive cooling Highly Over-clockable CPU and GPU and still remain stable A feeling that you have accomplished something which not many people can do (master race) The ability to add more components to your loop if Radiator space suffices. I was running air for years till I discovered water cooling in 2006. I will never go back.
I love every computer tech channel makes there own pcs!
that's overpriced
!TACCOS
Why not benchmark witcher 3?....
But can it run minecraft at 240p???
am i the only one that noticed the cpu is an engineering sample? why use an ES cpu?
I self would use a i5 4690k and a gtx 970 just to play GTA V and Battlefield 4 at 1080p or 1440p at ultra settings... but still a nice video
waste of money. spend 1500$ and save the rest.
Awesome build i like the pink too
+1 if you noticed the linus tech tips shirt
c?u hình oc và gaming th?
Shoulda called it the Pepto Bismol machine
what is the case?
If build mostly for gaming (no video rendering) that coice of CPU is retarded. No Game can make use of so many cores, The 6700k would have been much cheaper and probably would have bottlenecked you less due to its much higher speed. (and still have 8 threads for the average Prosumer production)
this is so awesomme
I still don't see the bennefit from custom water loops, A closed loop h100 or whatever for about 400 dollars less and maybe a 5degree difference seems more reasonable. If u got the money tho u good.
and you still a noob at gaming seems legit
+Awesomesauce Network , At 4:39 , 1080, 1440, 4K are the monitor resolutions?
What's the case ???
I just got a computer that I build for 500$. Max settings on WAW 60fps without even going into overclock
Nah don't show any game play, that would be ridiculous!
Nah don't show any game play, that would be ridiculous!
sorry but the venturi fans are loud ! ive had 3 of them in my system for my main coolstream pe 360 rad ! fuckin loud and vibrating ! changed the fans for my old af 120 from corsair and more quiet no vibration and better cooling !
There's no mention of the pump res combo. Ek right?
Will a i5 4690 be enough to handle the awesomeness of 1 989 ti in my new pc ?
very nice setup! i also have a FD Define S case, the PC is wc-ed too and my 4690K is at 4.7GHz with 1.37v and the max temp, after 2 hrs of Mad Max, hit 73 Celsius. is this ok? compared to you, my temp is pretty high. thank you
What is the outro song?
390x or 980?
Arma 3
My dream build http://pcpartpicker.com/p/JP9sNG My current build (Note, I didn't pay the price listed, that's just what it would cost today. I paid about half of that.) http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2gpDRB
"bottlenecking" a 5960x? wat
wow! Cool!!
Water remains the same temp throughout the entire loop... The top card is warmer because it is the work horse compared to it's sli linked companion below. Facts.
It would be sad if someone built this and only played games at 1080p. :( I know there are some who would.
Great... now I want tacos
hitman absolution lmfao... thats a 2012 example... please use games from 2013 and up preferably 2015 and up seeing how this needs to run smooth 4k with games coming up, and not 3 year old games
Gtx780 zotac turbo2.0 1,100mhz-1250mh. Still I would want your PC modes Kyle.
5 GRAND FOR A PC! some people have too much cash float
purple looks gay!!
why not 2 r9 furys???
"Tacos?" ahhahaha epic
your info is cool but your videos always make me want to punch you in the neck
Tacos... indeed.

Hey Kyle. What res/pump is this? all the combo pumps on ek's website are way shorter.
Hey Awesomesauce i was wondering,are you intrested on trading my Yu-gi-oh super duper original version and a couple of pokemon cards for this?If you dont like those i have an old gameboy wich worths billions now,I mean i give you tresure here mate so think about it
can you pleas check your Facebook
Beautiful build and badass performance!!
damn the build looks cool despite having pink stuff in it
What if I just use fans instead of water cooling is that fine
Since games are really bad at utilizing multiple cores, a highly overclocked i7-6700k may give you better results, with its better single core performance.
where is the build log for this?
Your temps are quite high. More rad space required. But the hard line loop looks great!
Why do you have 3.0Ghz processor in a 5,000 dollar gaming pc ( my computer has 4.2ghz Overclocked and i bought it for £319)
hey its me ur brother
why did you use airflow fans on those radiators?
#TACOS!
"a whole degree colder than Ebenezer Scrooge" lmfao xD
is this quad 980 ti or two cards
when i first started pc gaming, i was all for the best low cost builds. now its just big dick syndrome
What's it's FPS with minecraft?
Love how he puts much more effort in promoting his sponsors by doing a short.
This is so gayming..
its, its beautiful :o
i couldnt hear your computer over my computer
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE POWER BUTTON ISNT PURPLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I just got back from the store , I could have had homemade TACOS tonight! What a great job you did; especially if it's your first hardline build. I hate pink, but that takes absolutely nothing away from your attention to detail and great execution here. Serious props. Awesome saucy job, Kyle.
Hey I'm a noob in computer how does water cooler work ?
My Xbox has better specs then this and only cost 350. What a waste of 5 grand
My Xbox has better specs then this and only cost 350. What a waste of 5 grand
very nice video on 980ti sli, I can only dream of having such a system
Can this PC run Minecraft?
I got question to you, what are you thinking about i5-4690k + G1 Sniper z97 + GTX 960. Am i going to play all the new games in at least 60 FPS in FHD?
4K gaming is the most retarded shit ever
I just want to say: What a sexy pc!
5000 with 60 year old hard drive tech ?  LOL
The  benefits come from the 980 Ti  ... not from the water cooling.  And your premise that water cooling is expensive is also wrong.  The answer to your question is your machine would have been better without the water and a modern hard drive because a digital drive makes a big difference and the water almost none.  Don't believe me ?  Disconnect it and you will see the fps is still above the hertz of the 4K screen.  Any fps over the hertz of the screen = 0
i didnt no my pc was so lound till i was tryn to hear yours
Can it run Minecraft?
I couldn't hear the sound test over my computers fans :P
This video has "4k likes" atm. lol
Awesome videos love your builds !!
Hey, should i get the r9 390 8gb vram or gtx 970 4gb vram. Please no fanboyism here. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/DZM9mG

woo purple pc's are the best
damn, being a youtuber makes you enough money for a 5000 dollar PC, pay mortgage for your nice looking suburb house, and a beautiful wife?! geeze i need to switch my job...
All I can think of is Vice City when looking at this, gorgeous.
What case is that?
fuck man i still have to play my games a 480p
dat moment when a 5960x is bottlenecking your GPUs,LOL.
YES YES YES YES YES!! That's all I can say. :p
thank you for using degrees Celsius and not °F
tacos
Tacos indeed
One mistake tho, 1080p = 2k. But such a "hot" rig :)
Meanwhile I'm enjoying my HD 4670 running old games at 720p 30fps low settings.
I love tacos
gtx 950 will be awesome of those kids on budgets or regular home PC's
can you guys please sub to my channel
The CPU is a beast but couldn't handle 2 980ti's ? Is this even real ?
http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/V4Ys4D very Good build
Awesome looking build - nice work!
Brilliant machine love it ! And hats off for the build :) If you have the money and the enthusiasm, It's a great hobby. But if you are doing it just to try get the best out of games and getting skint about it, That's where people are going wrong because the actual difference in gaming performance between a 5000 bux liquid cooled X99 system and a fan cooled z97 system (with the highest cpu for each) Is never worth hitting the breadline for lol
Water cooling is justified by the cool factor alone........the performance is just icing on the cake!
Still cant buy the node 202

I'm going with tacos.
Loll why the hell would you spend 5000 dollars on a gaming pc just get a console which is cheap and it's easier cause of the controller
nice system but you should get more ram since youre video editing
Tacos!
holy shit what a tank pc
Hi kyle, I checked your amazon and list and i couldnt find the case you were using. Im probably super dumb but is it the fractal design r5?
I think he got the name hotline from drakes song hotline bling
You want us to leave our thots in the comments?
I want to have sex with your computer, its so fucking beautiful.
Hey everyone. I'm just getting into PC gaming and have a question. Are the specs listed below adequate to play games like Arma 3 and Rust on at least medium settings. Eventually I plan on upgrading graphics card and power supply. Thanks in advance! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intel® Core i7-4790 Processor 3.6GHz 16GB DDR3 RAM 1TB 7200RPM SATA3 Hard Drive Microsoft® Windows 10 (64-bit) 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 720 Graphics Integrated High Definition 7.1 Channel Audio Processing Power Supply: 350W
They are actually 5k benchmarks. Lel

Well my graphics card idles at under 30 degrees celsius and i have the stock cooler on it.
I say.... Tacos
Tacos?
Yes, Tacos.
TACOS
Stylistically, I really like it. Some of these games though, they must be pushing systems really hard, those FPS numbers were a li'l bit on the low side considering the hardware investment. Let's hope DX12 or Vulcan sort this out for us and you should have a real monster when those come online.
Tacos. Definitely tacos.
Ummm...why does it state above that the Fractal Design giveaway closes Sept. 10th, but when I follow the link the contest is ended and someone won already (it's Sept 6th as of this comment)?
Right so I just went on pc part picker and i did everything I needed to do like cpu,motherboard,ram and etc, I chose the graphics card listed and wanted to know if there is anything better I could choose, here is the link http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/ ,thanks in advance, you can change the cards if you edit the build.
That pink look is so sick!
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! ROFL
hotline bling
Does it run HL3?
I can't belive that the 5960x, especially OCed, could ever bottleneck in GAMES...HOW??
I like to know where you can buy those venturi fans so I can get some, can't find them for sale anywhere?.
Fuck 4k. That shit's gay.
ASUS Motherboard? Lawl.
4K is garbage gimmick BS, only way you can benefit from 4k is if you're 1 foot from the screen or have an 80 inch tv!!!!!!!!!! Plus PC games are garbage now days. They either suck or are bad console ports.
What case is this I'm planing on building a water cooled pc :D soon
dislike, ugly build and pretty standard really. 5960x with 980ti in SLI, pffft.
a frickin 500$ ssd xD
This system look great, even if i'm not into pink/purple. Anyways you can always change the color of the liquid anytime. I don't think 4k will be available for most people under 1-1.5k $ before a few years. But its getting there! Now, i only have an Asus 770OC and i'm might need to upgrade when VR headsets hit the selves. But im sure not going to put 5k on a computer haha! Money is hard to get by in Quebec.
+1 for Tacos
The real question is can it run Minecraft ?
5+ grand to play video games!!!!! Madness.
So it says the giveaway closes on Sept. 10th, but it has already ended......
so you spend 5k on a gay pc that only gets 54 fps in cysis while my 2.5k rig runs crysis 3 at 7680x1080p at a constant 60fps. Fail sauce.
I can hear the prodigy at the back.
Tacos
The giveaway definitely closed prior to the 10th, or at least that is what the linked page says.
Hey what is your keyboard? Can you link me to it
Moded skyrim benchmark or I have No idea how powerful the system is!
Lol u should have custom mod your case' make it even cooler
Why does it say in the description that the contest closes the 10th, but the link says it has ended already?
Damn.. that's one quiet PC! Nice Job.
My laptop idle's at 90 degrees Celsius... yes I meant Celsius ;_; and your computer doesn't hit that at max...
How can anyone sit and listen to this nerd hipster douchebag talk.
tacos?
I mean I'm down for tacos if you are.
I can barely hear anything over my own PC.
im to late ;~;
mmm tacos.
...TACOS!!!
Tacos. Ofc tacos
Tacos rule!
burrito bowls
Damn max temps of the i7 hitted 98 degrees. Nice knowing that a watercooled cpu can get that hot.
That shit is nothing. My i3 and hd 4400 graphics gets 30 fps in csgo at low settings.
this might be a dump question, but wount he get condensation on his parst at sub room temp temps?
I know when that hotline bling
This is my dream PC.
Tacos sound good...... I'm gonna go get some now.
FINALLY! BENCHMARKS!
Hey guys. i am joining the pc mustard race and i wanted to ask u waht u think of this build http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/7prs4D
why no 240p benchmarks? afraid your pc wont run at 240p resolution?
Lmao tacos
Tacos.
Why so cheap?!
It's going to be another year or two before there is a single card solution to 4k/60fps gaming that is also affordable for all the capitalist peasants.
meawhile.. I have lag in cs:go
Hardtube is for hipsters and dudebros.
So, the competition says it is open until 9/10/15 but when you click on the link in your description it says the competition is now over....its currently 9/5/15.

Hi Kyle, seems to me something is off with your temps - idle below 20°C. I thought you re living in California and not Antartica or did your AC cool down the room to chilly 10-15°C?
Congratulations on your beautiful build mate, it will serve you well! The force is strong in this one!
outro song? pls
You don't need 8 cores for a gaming pc
Ewwww everything is in series
HELP ! my old motherboard died and i cant boot off my new motherboard i put in ! how would i fix this ? i dont want to reinstall windows as i have spent alot on applcations that i can only download once (steam)
10 seconds on the givaway
All i heard when listening to the sound test was my load ass pc :(
4 way sli with 980 ti
nicest build ive seen
Tacos?
"Tacos?" IM DYING
U KNO WHEN DAT HOTLINE BLING ??
How do you feel about Maxwell architecture running like shit on DX12/(and presumably) Vulkan? You figure by the time DX12/Vulkan is relevant it'll be time to spend 5k again?
WOOWW....
Tacos
+AwesomesauceNetwork so i have a question, i was wondering what recording software you use for the benchmarking and also if you tutorials and if so, if you could do a tutorial on how to set up and use the recording software that you use. i am trying to start a youtube channel so i would appreciate some tips :)
I think giveaway ends in 6 hours, but he mistakenly took it in as days.

Kyle, you should make a bobble head Kyle to sell. Reason, your head moves around like a bobble head in your videos.
those are some toasty cpu cores.
that pc looks SICK IM CURRENTLY HAVING A NERD BONER!

can someone explain to me how a 5960x bottlenecks, this is the second video i'v seen with that being said and it scares me, i need explanation q-q
New intro?
Nice PC, well Built
tacos? no. no tacs. Turnips.
I just realized that I have the same desktop background as you! xD
i only heard my pc blowin at 2:55
14°C on the CPU?!?!?! How is that even possible? My i 7 4770 (non k) runs about 35°C in idel with my corsair h100i. I know aio Watercooling units arent nearly as good as custom loops but 14°C?!?

I heard my PC over yours in the sound test ;~;

You lucky bitch. Much jealous, many money
i just cant understand why it takes youtube ppl days, weeks and months to do a build, when a mong like me can do it in a few hours haha
Me WantTaco's.... . Going to wait until pascal or Greenland to see that 4k is doable without dual gpu's #PcMasterRace, 900p/1080p console peasants.
That PC is sick the only one thing that sorta sucks is the case. (personnel preference I guess)
A $5000 PC is an indulgence I'd love to invest it :P
Yep that thing is a BEAST! looks "Awesome" too! ......aaand Tacos!
Could you do the benchmarks Jayztwocents did to see how they compare?
Hnnnngh so beautiful
I wish i had the money for custom WC :/
What kind of tubing did you end up using? acrylic or petg?
awesome
Another awesome build Sir! I can say with my hand on my heart that you are one of the only people on youtube whom I would trust to build me a system if I could not do it.
liked it for the pink lol
mhhh... Tacos
I heard something, I know it.
It's bootiful
I could only push my 980 ti to 1430 MHz :/ Jelly in ma belly
Tacos, for sure.
Crysis 3, the bane of every GPU made before 2018 lol.
Yes, this machine is 4K Battle ready!!!
crysis 3 is a very nice game
Tacos? I say yes.
I lost my shit when the kool-aid man came bustin through
wow its done! congrats!
no witcher 3, disapointed D:
Definitely tacos.
My GPU cries when she saw this
4K beast!!!! Super jealous man, I want to experience 4K at those frames wow. Awesome build man
I wouldn't be surprised if Josh did that on the regular.
Reference to Hotline Miami's pinkish artstyle ?
impressive!
When you tested the sound of this pc i was actually hearing mine lol xD
More than 80° on the CPU? Wow
you look very manly in those earrings.
Do the GPU cooling blocks reduce the card height to a single slot?
I kinda laugh every time i see a "4k rig". I get it you want quality but the cost is nowhere near the benefit. (well i'm sure if you are pulling in 6 figures it would be easier) It's tech we just won't be ready for for the next 4 years.
Wtf that shirt doesn't look blue. I want one.
A 5960X, 8-Core, 16 Threads Beast of a CPU on 4,4 GHz is the bottleneck .... I don't wanna live in this world anymore !!
i actually hear my computer through headphones which is in idle ... while yours was in load aaaand with my headphones bumped to 100% Q.Q
tacos
best computer you can buy today
Welcome to the 301+ clu ... oh ... shit. Youtube. What have you done.
whaaat?? LOL
when you have a parallel terminal your GPUs should always have same temp, since they share the same intake water.
Why not a Giveway of Hotline? It's a joke, please don't kill me !
i liked this vid because of tacos
"its so beautiful"
0:48 you're welcome...
should have used AMD GPU
Tacos :)
no witcher 3? but regardless would've did well
what was the ambient temperature when you tested the pc
+Awesomesauce Network Hey Kyle, next time you watercool multiple cards see if there is a way to make a parallel water thingimagig intead of using series. That way both cards get much needed fresh coolant.
I still think it looks like it's cooled by Pepto Bismol.
So much head bob kyle. Love it
Where are the harddrives?
TACOS!
2 cheap
But why...
TBH I liked "Pink Panther" better :)
That pink is such a good pink
TACOS!!!!! :D
Giveaway? yeah right
Excellent ad (y)
first
The tubing remind me of windows xp screen saver
Try running firestrike ultra on a GT 640. I got 0 FPS while running it.
you should run the coolant to the top card first, as SLI is only used in gaming, in rendering it would leave you using the hot card, and the cool card doing nothing
YES tacos pls
Kyle I don't mean to sound rude but i dislike your outro, you sound like that fruit cake Phillip De Franco dork..
Can I play minecraft with this build, I'm looking into building something like this but with 4 Titan X's in SLI instead of 2 980 Ti's
awsome build, awsome benchmarks, awesome sauce :D
D: is so purple I WANT PURPLE ON MY PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Forget 4k; high refresh rate 1440p is where it's at.
Great vid Kyle, the editing skills are getting better all the time. Also i could watch a half hour commercial with Josh in it, but then again im a Fractal Fanboi
Use it in good health!
Yes I would love some tacos.
What was your ambient temp?
I would like to see some newer benchmarks. Witcher 3 and MGS 5. No one cares about crysis 3 anymore, well not for the gameplay anyway. 4k Ultra Battlefield 4 above 60 fps makes me feel warm and fuzzy as well. Its a damn good looking game.
TACOS
nice
IT'S THE PINK PANTHER!!!!~
What is the outro music?
This is an awesome build
Beautiful system, love the colour scheme :)
You could throw all these specs at me and i'd still be thinking "damn.. that pink is fucking sexy"
CPU bottleneck, you know what that means, reverse the loop so the cpu is first in it, and overclock it some more. Also 2k is 1080p, 1440p would be 2.5k
Kyle, you are running a parallel terminal, both cards will get the same inlet water temp. If it was serial then the coolant would be heated by the lower card first. Upper card being hotter is probably just usage difference or just slight difference in thermal efficiency or maybe thermal paste application. Nice build though bro. Looks really nice and great performance. Good job.
I'm really crossing my fingers that I win the contest! I NEED to win so badly! School started and my PC does not have to horsepower I need for all my 3D modelling projected, video editing, and my gaming hobbies!
It will always be the pink panther!
I love your channel and the videos! They are just awesome and so much fun to watch! Keep up your amazing work <3
tacos
My fans in my PC which is under and at the other side of the wooden desk is LOUDER than your PC o.0
Why do people keep calling 2560x1440p , " 2k"? 2k is 1920x1080p. Why? Simple. 2k is most commonly an abbreviation for 2000. 1920 is a HELL of a lot closer to 2000..than 2560. The terms " 2k" and " 4k " in gaming terms refer to the horizontal pixel count. Although it's technically NOT correct for someone to call 3840x2160p, " 4k", it is much more acceptable. 2560x1440p = 2.5k This is common sense.
tacos plz
How about some Witcher 3 benchmarks? I would think that would be an excellent test for Hotline.
Hotline. I like it, glad you didn't go with "Pink Panther" like 90% of the comments wanted you to
Tacos? Yes. Always. It looks great, glad it runs well. As for 4K, I think the bigger deal is getting variable refresh rate tech ubiquitous, much like how progressive scan is standard now. HBM 2 should help the illusive consistent 4K@100Hz+. I'm rather curious as to what in or about the setup is bottlenecking: core/thread count, SLI implementation, the Haswell microarchitecture, or something completely different.
Why are those minimums so low? Also I can buy my car twice for the price of your PC. Nice.
Tacos for sure.
I want a gaming pic so bad but I'm young so I can't pay for that wonder when I can buy one I can't build one idk how
its ok my little evga 750ti you run at ultra in my hart... actualy at very high 60 fps, close enough...
tacos?
you dun good, son
Core 0 was at 55 degrees F?? What was your room temp???
tacos yes
lmao all these new fractal ads are hilarious. GG to whoever is coming up with these ideas! XD
#PinkPantherIsBetter
yes tacos, approved :p
Financially and functionally, water cooling is completely fucking stupid. So are Ferrari's. That doesn't make either any less awesome. Nice work, Kyle! Congrats on reaching a point in your career where rewarding yourself by building a true tech lovers system like this is possible. : )
Does anyone know if the asus strix gtx 980ti have a water block yet?
This build is awesome. Nuff said...
Miami
dam that's nice i built a pc too tho and i'm happy about the price/performance of it! https://pcpartpicker.com/b/6hpbt6
I agree with tacos. Tacos are good. Tacos are life.
pink panther was a better name imo
winter is coming
and in a year has to replace everything
What you guys think about this build? http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VH9QWZ
At what point does a custom water cooling system ever warrant the cost? I build them because they look bad ass, thermals and cost come second to me when we get into this price range.
Allways talking about 3k,5k "MOSNTER PC".... And e with a Intel Q6600, Asus Gt610 and 3Gb DDR2 ;( Life Sucks
I'll take an Intel i taco and a quad sli burritos
Tacos!
hell yeah tacos
Badass PC!!
That intro ?? great vid
When does the Node 202 go on sale? I want to soooo bad but i cant find it anywhere :(
Question: if i wanted an awesome purple liquid cooling setup for my SLI 980ti's as well, what would be the easiest way to do it for someone who has no experience with liquid cooling? I've heard that soft tubing is easier than hard tubing but other than that, i do not know where to start.
Tacos and Chill?
did you just include the value of your PC in your title? so very unprofessional and expected from a newb youtuber. also...you didn't buy it all, so it just ads to the cheesiness of this video. unsubscribed.
taco
tacos
Skylake-e? the wait is on
+Awesomesauce Network Hey love the videos keep on doing what your doing, do you take fan mail?
No 720p medium settings. need some console representation. xbox one vs ps4 vs hotline 3 way showdown of performance and wallet size... xD
The real question is, can it run minesweeper
any chance of a comparison with Skunkworks (J2C) and Arctic Panther (PH)?
Where'd you get that table at 2:36 (my gf loves it haha!)?
which is more demanding crysis 3 or the witcher 3....
Fajitas!
mmmm tacos.  BTW, love the Machine. Awesome job.
Oh, this is the epileptic dude.
+Awesomesauce Network You wear grey cpu shirt in video, but sell blue one in store. What gives bby gurl?
fire.
Pink Panther was a better name.
LOL you should have been like i could hardly hear the fans over my spinning SSD's....i'm not dumb it would have been funny because of course they dont spin
Is it safe when my i7- 4790k @ 4.6ghz hits 100 degrees Celsius under stress? It's water cooled by the Corsair h55 quiet edition.
Would you say you spend more time building pcs than playing games ?
Y pink?!.... Y ?
Are you gonna use your 750 SSD in here?
When I get a job I am going to make one of these!
Did you really just include the price of your rig in the title? See ya
tacos
I call horseshit on the sound test, if you have HDD's you'll hear them, no fucking way your PC is THAT quiet.
Cat tail spotted 0:17
$5k -.-
My headphones have a noise treshold so high they didn't even turn on
Was he looking to Netflix and Chill?
Wait what? At idle you had min of 12C? Does that mean your room temp is 10C????
Why no Withcer3 benchmarks ?
Why were there no 480p benchmarks?
TACOS
200 fps.. not big deal
What are you going to do about dust falling into the top? That's one reason I never opened the top of my Define.
All i could hear was my pc xD
Can it play Minesweeper at medium settings?
Why use Zotac why not EVGA,MSI or asus
I'm jealous :(
Hmmmm i have a fx 6300 with a h60 in it and the idle is 17c hottest it got in game was 35c wierd i thought intel is cooler and plus u have a custom water cooler and i have a tiny rad lol
Such a cool pc, congrats dude!
You should've called it the rape machine cause that's what happened to those benchmarks !!
Tacos?... Tacos
:D
I could go for some tacos...
This system looks amazing but I would switch the blue LED on the front of the case for a pink one to fit the colour scheme
Tacos? TACOS!!!
I just hope you don't paint something grey thats already grey again
would you please tel me the name of EK sli water block
That sli bridge though. What happen there Kyle ?
That system is freaking EPIC Kyle. So jelly. Great job and video! :)
But can it play solitare?
The only difference between this and my computer, is my cpu is only a 5930k, and my case is and Enthoo Luxe. If only had thought of going Team Pink instead of the usual, Red/Black w/ white LEDs.
sexy as f
How were you getting cpu temps below ambient temperature? I'm assuming your room isn't below 15 degrees Celsius but I suppose it could be.
The answer to taco's is never not have taco's.
WHY DO YOU ONLY MAKE BLACK SHIRTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yeah but does it run crysis 3 in 4k @ 60fps? XD
Cpu bottlenack? I think its the ram, because 8x(16x) 4,4 ghz, is very a high clock, but the ram I think is on stock speed and has "just 16gb" which is for 4k not very much. I have the same setup, but only 1x 980 ti. I installed 32gb and the fps go up. Dont now the exact result I´m not at home, where the pc and the scores are...
5960x bottlenecks?
Still think dropping 5k on a pc that can't handle 4k with ease is a waste in my pov.... I rather just build a computer for 1440p and save some money for next gen cpu/gpu. Again it's just my ''POV''
The intro ads remind me that I can't buy a Node 202.
Why do you put ads of products that aren't on sale? Sure maybe a week before release to try to build hype but we've been waiting WEEKS for the node 202. GIVE IT TO US NOW JOSH!
yes, tacos
+awesomesaucenetwork
that is the best fractal design commercial have seen
Hey I'm new to the pc thing and I was wondering if the new driver is compatible with all gtx 960 and for windows 10
A Rapper Bro U don't know and Big Fan
The only noise I heard during the sound test was my 9800GT D:
I'd say you're ready for 4K now, but the water cooling question: For performance? No. But who builds a custom water cooling for the performance? It's for enthusiasm :) But the quiet is nice though :P
He called it hotline because of the Drake song
Fractal Josh lol.
When you realize the only noise you hear during the sound test is your PC... while wearing headphones lol
:10 cat, :20, cat gone
Tacos!
its a damning indictment when people actually spend 1500€+ on a pc just for playing games, I am also often. feeling bad that I have spent 1100€ on my PC, considering an xbox1 costs 350€ and can make a smart TV out of a normal one, but the controller on consoles are shit for FPS, thats why I stayed on the pc side
Arent those gpus in parallel with that manifold?
Air cooled 980 ti go over 1500mhz
Still not over how beautiful that pc is
Whilst you're using all of this fancy nancy components, i'm stuck using a GTX 750 ti because of my awful budget pls send me good hardware ;-;
Lovely color scheme with black.
23 like a pro ????????
The colors remind me of GTA Vice City for some reasons.
Couldn't care less about 4k. At this point it's still an early adoption gimmick for turbonerds judging by the international availability of 4k Freesync/G-Sync monitors and their prices, let alone additional hardware to drive them. 1440p is more than enough for me for the next few years.
Looks Güd
TACOS!
Bench stuff in 5k and bench minecraft!
Why didnt you benchmark any newer games?
First ! :D Great build
