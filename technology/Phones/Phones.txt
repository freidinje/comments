Hey furious Pete
you should have done this on the Iphone 7 you put a headphone jack in.
Face ID
if you have spacing issue would it be easier if you use styrofoam rather than foam to push the connector? because styrofoam is more rigid but not enough to break stuff if the thickness is right?
Apple HQ: "Guys, have the lawyers got anything on him yet???" Apple Minion: "Not yet master. But the lawyers work tirelessly."

You know, you could put pressure on Apple by install Android phone features on iPhone. Just to show to Apple that is never been engineering problem but management bullshit and we can fire them.
memag gile betul teknologi china
So is this wireless charging module only for Apple? Or is it possible to also use it for android phones?
Build ur own iPhone 7, add headphone jack, and add wireless charging
Podia ter legenda em todos os vídeos pois gostei muito do conteúdos!!!!
I see the benefits of learning how to do pretty much anything, and I praise your efforts. What I can't see, is, relative to the efforts of hacking the device, the difference between putting down a phone on a mat as opposed to inserting it in a plug. How about removable storage? removable battery? a better camera? that would be the iPhone everyone is dreaming of! Anyways... that was just me being me, keep it up, whatever the way, as long as you are having fun.
do i need to solder this to my logic board?
Next Challenge: Put super super amoled screen something that neither the iphone Xs has
I will be in shenzhen for the day, in a few months and want to take my old iphone 6 to get updated with more memory. You said at the end of the video there are repair shops where can wait while they do a job, Can you please tell me the address or name, or how to find a repair shop. Thanks alot
What is the name of the song in the intro?

How to install trash ColorOS - In China
Hey, does anyone know how I can get hold of the wireless charging part for the iPhone 7???
I saw a Xiaomi Power Bank :^)
Your Videos are awesome
Love the iron man with the glowing eyes.
Time for apple to go to china for engineering not cheap labour.
U look like a slimmed down Furious Pete, and u sound like him too. ????
Nice video. This video is not just about the wireless charging but the creativity behind the people and how the markets and the surrounding ecosystem. A wild wild EAST out there! Love the statement in one of your video - "the future is already here but just not evenly distributed!". Keep it up.
I cant even find screen replacement for iphone 5s and do it myself... But in China, they already has, not just each iphone part, but also a wireless charging pad for iphone.... ??
It's a 1A charger?
Oh look, the "iDealer" is back!!
Have you tried the camera?
Install audio jack in it also
You should have put it in your custom phone
what is the laptop that you're using
The thing about “wireless charging” is the way it is now it’s not actually wireless. The phone essentially has to make contact with the charging plate to work. Not only that but wireless charging actually costs more energy because some of the energy dissipates before it is absorbed by the receiver. This is true with the Tesla wireless charging as well. I’ve seen another video stating that the average car would via as much as the electricity in the average 3 bedroom house to fuel per month. The cost is one thing but all that energy loss is definitely not a good thing. That energy could easily be used for something else. If more people actually utilized this technology it would put massive unnecessary strain on the country’s electrical infrastructure. I’m just saying sure this tech is neat but it only exists because people are do dang lazy to simply plug in the phone.
love how you're able to just set aside the problems you find for the next day instead of banging your head throughout the night trying to solve it immediately. I would kms to solve it now rather than waiting, which would probably result in less productivity.
@strange part , Scotty you should think of producing your phone brand whit all freedom possible to modify .
What game are they playing at 18:36? It looks interesting.
iPhone With 4000mAh battery
Amazing !
Lmao 0:22 kid in the back flicks him off

Dude,make a dual camera setup on iphone 6
Take a pair of quality headphones like the AT M50’s and add a W1 chip to them so we can use the seamless setup of AirPods with a quality sounding headphone.
Dude just buy a damn Galaxy. Every stupid mod you do already exists on the old ass Galaxy phones. Gave up on iPhones when the aux was removed, I have Bluetooth but I also love the plug. iPhone used the excuse to remove it to add battery life but you already proved the gap was filled with a plastic part
You play high tech lego
He's actually called one way
Nice video!, very surprising. What about if I need one?, Where can I buy it? Has a webpage to order it? Regards from Mexico City
iPhone 6s Plus?
Hahaha love your style you make mistakes and you "POWER ON THROUGH" you dont try to be anything else but a average guys trying to fix things up a bit and not making out your some kind of rocket scientist with attitude. Stay cool and would love to see some Samsung and other brand name works as i actually despise Apple.(sorry bout that outburst lol) Yes i subscribed...Peace
Hello sir, can you show how to do this on redmi note 3?
?????????~??
wow apple products dont have this ? sorry but androind phones have this for years ... really for years
Don't understand, why i need to buy iPhone for some $, buy wireless charger kit for $70 and do it myself, when i can just buy another phone with this function and many others, that not exist in iPhone. iPhone is not good choise for thos, who need all of this stuff.
I've been watching your videos scotty from the beginning and I'm hooked. I'm a slightly older geek but love your videos and the way you present them.keep up the good work and keep those videos coming.makes me want to go to the markets now even more than ever when I do eventually visit.
You need to make a video if possible, how to replace home button with Touch ID if it breaks or you break one while swapping it, and if it is possible to reprogram it to the motherboard you want to use it with
next put this in the one with a headphone jack
Iphone 7 with a headphone jack and wireless charging please :D
Next challenge: iPhone 7 camera on iPhone 6S or iPad
Apple was going to release this next year :/
Anyone else get to the part where the wireless charging worked and saw that you weren’t even half way through the video ????????
Can you please tell me the market's name and place Please
24:00 and you know why this is possible there? Because they dont give a fuck about copyright or Apple's restrictions. Do you need anymore evidence of why copyrights RESTRICTS creativity and engineering innovation than this?
Something I use a lot are IR blasters on smartphones but they are slowly disappearing. Can we see an IR blaster perhaps in an IPhone!
it's sad that in indonesia . i can't get the parts so i can't try this. :((
I got to say from watching your videos this is going to be my second. These sort of videos give me inspiration to further more take on more challenges like soldering iPhone logic boards and other electronics
is there any overheating during the charge?
SUGGESTION: Use a solder shield, I know you will have to improvise one. Then use this electrically conductive glue to coat to each land thinly ( https://www.ebay.com/p/Repair-UltraFire-Flashlight-Conductive-Glue-No-Heat-Solder-Soldering-18ml/1300453321?iid=302627500938&chn=ps ( https://www.ebay.com/p/Repair-UltraFire-Flashlight-Conductive-Glue-No-Heat-Solder-Soldering-18ml/1300453321?iid=302627500938&chn=ps ). You will still use the foam tape so that the glue will cure under tension.
I can find my comment
good
Some extreme Apple fanboy tried to tell me that Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 to increase the size of the battery, among other reasons. Yet here you are, taking a iPhone 7, putting the headphone jack back, and even adding wireless charging. Apple fanboys can make some insane excuses for that company sometimes.
??????????
Hey Scotty! Why don't you start selling personalized phones???? I would buy a personalized phone from you!
How come he was talking through his phone translator at the beginning, then all of a sudden he speaks Chinese ?
Can’t we buy 7 plus version?
Ever thought about learn chinese properly??????
Please try to install type c port in iPhone !
You are getting better on Chinese!
APPLE CEO AND APPLE SECURITY IS LOOKIN FOR YOU! YOU ARE WANTED!
??? ??? ??? ???
i think there is a more reliable method , you should have tried , before installing the flex cable of the wireless charger , the connection points that is going to be touching on the main board should have beed cleaned , because there is always some residue on the solder that is on the mainbaord , and it will prevent the wireless charger connectors from connecting properly , or maybe you can just solder the whole thing its just 4 connections points , as i saw from your video , it needs some skills and fine tip solder , your microscope will definetally be a good help , if you did this at the begining , it could have been easier
apple should hire this man
how much is an iphone 7 over there that u just buy these things xd?
so geek
SP are my initials!!
Now all we need is a home button for the iPhone X

You should get some people , and get in the smartphone business .
Do you have wangweis we chat ?
samsung users can install this in 5 seconds
maybe use rubber instead of foam, rubber will keep constant compression over time.....
I am not sure if I missed this in your video but does that result in the phone loosing its water resistance rating?
Try putting a glass back on a 7
Once more on an iPhonexs, you will be cooked.
You'd think the foam would go on the connector before you slap the flex board and top connector on. This way the foam puts some spring on the flex board portion, so that there is a range of tightness on the closed connector that results in contact. With the foam outside the connector, it has to press it all the way down for good contact with the flex board.
Could you upgrade the screen of the new iphone xr into 1080p?

Finally noticed some of the utility of the phone surgery tray - the matrix of depressions for screws and such - though might be nice to have broader, curved ones. The tool areas to encourage finding them quickly are handy. Thanks for another repair video and for taking us through the process - never give up when you know it can be done, learn how to adapt.
Is this kit avail for the 7Plus? or just the 7?

Well done!!! I really admire you enthusiasm and the motivation to do something. I can clearly see in your videos that when you are upto something it really makes you unsettled until you finally do it. For next why dont you add 512GB storage to you modified iphone 7. It will not only enhance the storage but will give you higher scores in performance benchmarks as well. Just for the record 512gb will only be working for iphone 7 and 7 plus.
I want free iPhone 7 wireless 128gb can

Next challenge : put ip x camera on ip6
The best word to describe what you're doing is "mod" (short for modify). Not "hack". Modding is when you physically alter something to achieve a function or goal that would otherwise not be possible in it's original form. A "hack" is when you intentionally cheat an existing system without altering it to achieve a desired result that is otherwise not "supposed" to occur. So his product is a Mod, not a Hack.

Hello, I have an idea for you, if you Know Redmi Note 5, a lot of people like this smartphone, but practically the only problem of this smartphone is that it doesn`t have a USB type C conector, so why not to change the micro USB conector to a USB type C conector?? I think that this would be a great idea. So guys, like this comment!!!! Pleaseeeeee

the outcome i got from this video is: takes ages to a considered "smart" western guy do a job that average chine guy does everyday
Liquid cooling in iPhone!! Especially the plus models
i like this videos but most of them just show people things that they will buy assembled.... because you have rather two options 1- you live in a place where there is someone to sell it done to you (probably just china) 2-you will never try it on your phone
Next challenge!!: Add a 120hz refresh rate display to any iPhone
he sounds like a typical sassy white girl during the 0:20 HAHA
You should get some sound absorbers so your voice doesn't echo so much around in your room.
I would wanna see it on a iPhone 4 ????
Hi Scotty I learnt a lot about the manufacturing know-how that the Chinese workers have to make an iPhone but I'm really curious to know if it is easy in China to create your own android phone or laptop ground up. Like is money all it takes to just throw in all the parts and make a good android phone?
Batery upgrade
If u live in China how do you get access to YOUTUBE? Or do u live in Taiwan?
Dude that was insane ‘ iPhone 7 on a whole crazy level. Much respect man
U should work in huawei then bro ????
I love this channel so much :D
Maybe there is a way to make 7th iphone screen ration bigger. Iphone 7 4.7 with iphone X screen like.
If you are affordable, could I ask something? My favorite iphone is 3GS, but it doesn't have any front camera. could you install the carmera in front of 3GS? If it's impossible, I'm gonna be okay. :)
Can you make reasonably priced good performance hackentosh?
in china in china in china in china hdscuibhasnjchuasnchine
What app are you using for translation?
Im sorry but the other guy did his job wtf, now its boring ????????????
you're an absolute unit if you think the whole apple android windows conversation is interesting at all, everything has it's place now, and because of that i tend to use all platforms. apple for convenience and workflow, android to test and develop apps, windows as a graphic workhorse. don't be one sided, be all sided. everything has a use
Where is all your stuff?
This is sick
Yeke is a genius tho
Bravo... Next target... Install USB/type C with vooc charging
is it possible to use this wireless charging thing on an iphone 6?
Love the videos but cannot stand this guys face or voice
can you build an apple watch?
Make the kit for 6s pls!!
Do it on Nokia brick ??????
Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! Please can you install a home button on the iphone X!!!! ?????????????????????? Ps. I know it's technically challenging but I will buy the kit if it can be done. Also a headphone jack. ???????? thank you.
Can you increase it's battery capacity ?
How about running 2 iphone boards as a single op device like those dual socket motherboards.
Modders are always better than developers themselves whether if its a game or a phone or anything... ??
I absolutely love how the guy from the shop just casually opened up his phone to check out if wireless works, China is amazing ??
Is it possible to have led notification lights in any of the iphones like samsung or other brands have.
Make a glowing strange part logo for iPhone RGB
u doin it the wong way Cx
Good work getting on to the BBC! When i saw it, i was like... "I know that guy!!" Its weird the connection you feel you have with people on YouTube. Well done man.
you guys are genius !!!!
Scott just curious if you would be attempting to add a w1 chip to airpod clones. That would be quite a cool project
Convert lightning port to USB type c or micro, that would be interesting!!
All Designers to be employed in apple are in china
What’s the translator app you used with the guy who sold you the iPhone?
that is not hacking its called modding
You can really touch the techniques by your hands when visiting China, amazing video.
now that combined with the headphone jack... would be the ultimate iphone7
If possible.. Start doing some software and hardware modification.. By installing android on an iPhone x.. Replace the internals with pre-installed android rom.. It would be amazing :D
The classic YouTuber would split a video like that in multiple parts, but you don't and I REALLY appreciate that. They are like short documentaries.
The look the guy gives you at 2:48
thanks for the video! I like the way you edit your videos
I like how he adds his own commercial breaks in the video
Nice Job! Can someone give me the ID of the intro music pls, we can also hear at 5:25 I already try all the musics in the description but I can't find it...
why not try solder it
that look of 12 min 8 sec. LOL
I see in your video loctide 460 glue with a small needle. I'm looking for such a small needle, but I don't found this in the internet.
Does it fit to iPhone 6s/6s plus?
Pro Tip: Pass your local Apple store on the way to buy your Samsung
????????,???(=_=)
ahh China, where everything i own was probably made there.
Guys, why don't phones have smoke detectors? How many lives have been needlessly lost because phones don't have smoke detectors?! Do it for humanity!
Next challenge: Move the fingerprint sensor into the logo of an iPhone 7, 8 and one into the logo of the X.
Put an A11 processor chip on an older iPhone
Next challenge is put RGB lighting in iPhone speaker
Just saw the interview with the BBC reporter. U r a legend man. Keep the videos coming they are never boring and inspirational. Proving that if u put your mind to difficult challenges they can be solved. Well done.
30:10 Feels like there is tension now. he he!
Can we order stuff from Yeke?
Well done on getting to 2nd most watched on BBC news
Would you be able to pay them to do it for you? I would be too worried about messing it up.
Sir you’re a legend sir
Congratulations on getting on BBC News UK for the iPhone headphone Jack.
Were can I get the glass conversion kit to got your the iPhone 7 but for a 6s ? Please lol someone link
Thank you for recording and showing your failures! It's awesome to see your perseverance! Looking forward to more of your can-do attitude and more videos with Strange Parts.
If you could micro solder those pads to the corresponding pins on the charger port connector pins it wouldn’t move and stop charging. Great idea though!
Your videos are awesome man keep up the good work. ???
This guy is like a more tech savy m13
FEEDBACK: Given the detail in the modification and what I understand about how the connection itself is made, I'm surprised that there isn't a pre-cut foam border that adheres to the top of the ribbon cable for the wireless charging module. If it were made of a dense enough foam at an appropriate height, it would fit around the female connector on the logic board to help with setting up alignment and, most importantly, KEEPING alignment while providing even distribution of force on the cable that wouldn't require distortion of the male connector itself to cause potential damage or eventual loss of connection.
I've seen this on Ebay for about a year or so now, it comes with housings with a glass back already installed
Maybe next step - Stereo speakers?
Did you check if the touch ID on the new phone works
Why is your mouth open for every thumbnail, makes me feel some type of way.
Make a watercooled xperia z3+
Do white Samsung
Amazing job. Im amazed about your enthusiasm, inquisitiveness and perseverance making all this stuff. Keep going and most important do not leave video making behind. Its exciting what are you doing. Greetings from Latvia! P.S. whats the audio name at 5:25 - 6:36 :)
Upgrade 4 4s LTE support
What app do you use to translate?
apple, holding tech back 20 years or more.
designed in california. badly.. improved in china, greatly.
I love how he's such a smiling person. Even if i wasn't interrested by the content, i'd watch his videos just for his positive attitude :)
??!
next challenge: OLED Displaymod
China is going through a golden age. Can you imagine being a smart young man in China with access to cheap tooling components and intellectual property with barley any red tape! The US is a nanny State compared to them.
I love the modding and changing of a product you own
Man, you make me wanna fly to Shenzen to explore that market.. it's glorious
Finger scanner behind screen?
Ur a tech genius man.
That men it's a fucking Genius and he doesn't even know it
can't stand your face mate
This DIY spirit is worthy of praise, but I have used the iPhone 8 for almost a year and never used wireless charging. Because the current wireless charging is too slow.
apple could learn something here xD
Gotta be honest I kinda want to buy an Iphone just so I can learn and try to mod it like this... this is so amazing!
12:58 wtf 10:43 AM 8/28/2018
With all these modifications your doing, I'm surprised you haven't started your own phone company?
Next challenge: put together all your projects and create an iphone 7 with 128gb, 3.5mm jack, led logo and wireless charging!
Nice video! But what is that for Amp meter 33:40 ? That seems very complicated to install. My Motorola Nexus 6 have a broken MicroUSB connector but lucky enough it have wireless charging. I have been looking after a repair shop here in Malmö, Sweden that can fix it but no luck :/
Next challenge ad a 1080 ti to and a core i7
yeke's kung fu is greater than your ninja moves, it seems. ha ha ha!
your genius men.....
What abou to add Wireless charging into a Xiaomi Mi8?
Question : do you live in (i’m guessing) China?
The thing I really love about Scotty: He genuinely sounds excited to make videos. None of that "OH MY GOD GUYS" rubbish. Legitimate excitement. The key to YouTube. 00:30
All this work when you could have just said siri add wireless charging to my iPhone.
Another amazing and entertaining video. So much brain power in this video. When biohacking becomes a thing, I know you'll be first ??
Scotty install USB-C With Fast charging !
Where do you get your lightning connector wireless charging pad?
i wouldn't be surprised if this channel was secretly paid by the chinese tourism board or something like that, theres always lots of stuff showing off china
00:00 Have to speak like Yoda to get the most accurate translation.
You like technology but you don't have a Samsung..
Damn Those B-Rolls!
How about the headphone jack and the wireless charging in a iphone 7???
In China we call these ?????? (Huaqiangbei sorcery)
Maybe you can ask yeke to integrate the design into the ribbon cable or presoldered onto the ribbon cable, so that when we add that to our phone we just replace the whole ribbon cable wireless thing, which I think will not require that much technique to install. This is just my suggestion, hope it helps.
Add a SD card slot to any iPhone :)
8:46 "Lightning jack" 12:06 AM (yep) 8/28/2018
5:25 Why did I watch a minute and then second (70 seconds) long time-lapse montage of an iPhone being disassembled again?... 11:47 PM 8/27/2018
You should've worn a pair of rubber gloves.
This camera makes your head look really really big
WHAT THE HELL !!!! WHY ARE THEY MOVING SO FAST WITH TECHS!!! USA YOU ARE BEHIND !!!!
That guy responded: "Wow! Cool" Unless he is also an English speaker, how did he do that?
Ingenius. Scary to think of what Yeke could do with an engineering degree!
you actually the coolest!!!!!!!
I was replacing my wifes iphone screen when the phone started to get extremely hot, i managed to dc the screen from The battery when I noticed that a scree from the screen had pierced the battery. I was so worried it would blow up I ended up just chucking it in the bin. advice dont mess with electronics with batteries!
Chinese people are so cool ????????????
MORE FOREST, LESS BUSHES
How does it compare to a non wireless charging phone after an EMP?
These gentlemen are very clever. Apple should hire them.... :)
Incredible how comfortable the shop keepers are taking apart these phones and putting them back together. Very cool
You should make THE ultimate iPhone 7, headphone jack+wireless charging.
Please tell me the name of the song
Next chapter. A bigger battery capacity
wait do you live in china now or are on a realllly long vacation
iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charger
Could you try and add the iPhone 7 home button to the iPhone 6s? I like the feel but don’t want to pay for the upgrade. Thanks!
I love this video. Such a neat little project, and I love the way you edit. I’ve done a few repairs on my own iPhones over the years but nothing on this level. I have some fun working on my 15-year-old BMW, fitting subtle features that appear “stock” to the naked eye but make it a little more bespoke and personal to me. Kinda similar I guess. Keep up the great work!
Put Android on iPhone
next challenge getting outta china before they abduct any 1 thats not chinese for concentration camps
Oh so you have to actually take the back off to do this hack cool.
Wow! Cool!
ain’t know one buying it and installing it without the problems you ran into ide really love one but don’t have $70 ?? like your videos as i’m in to iphones and taking them apart to ??????
Nice work! :D What kind of translation app you are using?
4:53 The microphone?... 1:42 PM 8/27/2018
Why risk messing up your phone when you could buy a mophie case that has a qi pad inside and can wirelessly charge your iPhone?
USB C
?????????
it is just so much fun and super interesting to watch you videos
20:55 what is the boiling water over the Buddah?? what does that do?
With my Samsung Galaxy s5 neo i only need to buy a different back plate. Actual smartphones are becoming every year more ... "stupid" for the use of basic functions (Apple Iphones in first places).
4:38 I wonder why he was pointing his phone away... 11:36 AM 8/27/2018
Get a plug in wireless pad that fits into your connector port and blam sorted ??
Why does everyone stare at you when you are Talking into the camera walking on the street?
Can you make a video how to make android phone would be interesting
adopt me sir
I FUCKING LOVE THE SLOMO B ROLL
Setup tour
Wireless Charging and minijack headphone connector inside one phone! and lighting logo back!!
wow this is cool! but ill stick with my 8 plus xd
Is it possible to add a USB C to a PS4 controller?
I love your videos. You are one of the most genuine people I've ever see and I love your enthusiasm for technology. A++
How do people still like iPhones? I’ve had two of them and I hated it. I love my iPad but I hate iPhones.
i‘ve made my own iphone6s wireless charging !Thank you! ???????iphone6s???????!???!
make IPhone with 2 sim cards
you should have used etched translucent glass.. it might look really awesome..
Seems like microsoldering the flex to the actual connector might be the most reliable way for those equipped to do it. Might give it a shot!
This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
?????!
That's nice ??????????
I know that you wanna do these upgrades to the iPhone because of views and because its fun, I agree. but have you heard of Android Phones?
Wireless charging is garbage and inefficient anyway. People should just buy a decent charging cable, they'll save money and their phones will charge faster.
Next challenge: Install MicroSD Slot, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Wrong Way. for me personally I would love to see someone mod a way to add widgets to an iPhone home screen.
M O R E F O A M T A P E!!!!! But seriously great video, keep up the great work :)
how much you spend money for this project?
how about soldering the pads to the flex cable. may be with a heat gun and some soldering paste if necessary. iphone is not my thing. sorry! But YOU ARE AWESOME
please bring back Framed Headphone Jack Circuit Board. I want one for my office
Yeke, Scotty, brilliant. I was willing it to work by the end. Great story, great tech, great outcome. Congratulations.
challange, install vga port in i phone for pc monitor
Yeke do u love me?
iPhone 8? Who needs that garbage? Get your iPhone wireless charging yourself
Micro SD in an IPhone
heads up... :D https://www.redmondpie.com/hacker-manages-to-add-wireless-charging-to-iphone-7-video/
Next try adding a SD card slot to an iPhone
Remove the notch from iPhone X
It’s iPhone Ten, not iPhone X 19:54
27:00 what is she doing?
Iphone X with Touch ID
3:43 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH
can yeke add the rgb on the iphone logo ? like if you want rgb on the iphone logo
Yeke should be offerd a job in apple or samsung, he is amazing!
but can you water proof it??
honestly, being able to communicate with other people with different languages with a good working translator in your pocket, thats pretty amazing these days.
funny thing is my Galaxy s6 from 2015 has wireless charging. also nfc, a 1440p screen with 575ppi, Android 7, a heartbeat sensor, and fast charging, an octa core processor, 3gb of ram, a 3.5mm Jack and is factory gsm unlocked. yet this iPhone is no where near it. apple needs to step up their game
Try installing the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone X. It's hard to get it working both software and hardware wise, but I'm confident you can do it.
next is, do it all you did to your current iphone project to 1st gen iphone. see if they still have it...
and next chalenge intaling fingerprint on under screen...
can u instaling dual camera, on your iphone?
you know there are usb pads that have a pass through right they plug into the charging port and stick onto the phone like a sticker and if they have a pass though they allow the standard cord to be plugged in also
he is so HOT
how many phones do you have, if I may ask?
Excuse me!!! I have a question? You have iPhone 6s Wireless Charging Kit? Thanks
is it safe to use?
Thanks for sharing this man! Always looking forward for your videos.
Finally...??
iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging... And bright apple logo, That would be sick !!
hello since a long time I have been following your channel and the truth I congratulate you for your achievements and you have inspired not to give up thanks
What a nice video,You are an inspiration !
Can someone tell me what app he used at the begging of the video to translate via voice ?? Thanks !!
An Engineery Student Over here, Greetings From El Salvador!! I like your vids man xD
This is a Cyberpunk dystopian world just embrace it
Next up: Remove the wireless charging from iPhone 8
could you hot air rework it so to just predominantly attach the wireless charger to that socket?
13:36 what's the music?
i want one for 6
great videos! worth the waiting
The red and black is pretty slick looking.
next project : install ios on an android phone
This guy is the perfect mix between Tavarish and Cody's Lab
Your dedication and persistance is just unbelievable. The help and pacience that Yeke has given to you is awsome.
What translator do you use?
Lol I got a wireless charger commercial ??????
Get you a samsung note 9 ,stupid iphone phones makes you crazy
this mufugga lookin like 2000s justin timberlake been on a fastfood benge
Next challenge: wireless charging, light up logo, headphone jack and usb type c on an iphone 7
I generally don't like or have any interest what so ever in apple products, but the head first diy approach you have in these add-ons, mids, and hacks on these products is amazing.Those Shen Zehn markets are definitely something I would like to see some day .
What about a double sided connector? So you don't have that pressure problem. One connector on the top, and one at the bottom of the wireless flex-print. But eventually the metal plate doesn't fit anymore...
Would the connector method work to add headphone jack?
What would be soooooo cool is if you made an iPhone X but without the notch, I'd rather have no Face ID and no notch!
Now make an iPhone 7 with wireless charging AND a headphone jack AND USB-C AND an OLED screen :D
Initial guess is that the pcb paths or connection tabs can not/ are not made thick enough to easily carry a full charging current.
Please do a iPhone 4 with Wireless charging
Dont need to attach a wireless adapter when you have one already on a samsung
Might not be a bad idea to send a kit to Louis Rossmann and see how well he fares at installing it. He is definitely experienced and would be a good measure of the difficulty.
I made my phone wireless for 1,50 euro
I want to see dual sim iphone but i think that might be impossible . because of software as well .....!
Is't possible to install the camera of an iPhone 7 P on a normal iPhone 7?
I would to see you make a normal iphone 7 into a completely waterproof iphone (ip68)
But they actually have that now on the iPhone 8 and 10
What's that green sign on all of the steps of the stairs say?
Very interesting video I’m so glad it popped up in my recommendation makes me want to start modifying my iPhone but I’ll probably wait until I can afford another iPhone just Incase I screw up ??
or you know just buy a driod because their not 4 years behind in phone tech like apple
Hey here is an idea: You have heard of the apple watch, now on this watch is what they call a "secret" port, it is not secret any more because a lot of people know about it. I also saw iBus tools online, what can you actually do with this port? Might be interesting to find out if it has some sort of backdoor option.
This guy makes iPhone feel like cheap smartphones only it's not. Great video as always.
Love the content you're putting up, always great editing & I love that you even have some b-roll! Also you're not far from 1M 0_0
Why not Bootcamp?
That's one hell of bloody iPhone ????
i love what you do and all of that, but sometimes things can get pricey. How can i do something similar to what you do, have lots of room of doing whatever i want and most importantly being cheap enough so that if you fail or break something you wont lose $100?
Challange : put a laser beam near led flash light.
Really cool vid as always ! I wish i lived in china so i could go to those markets and just buy random stuff and frankenstein my phone and other stuff ;) Keep up the great work and great vids! Edit: i just bought a htc one m9... i know i'm late in the game, but it has infrared beam on the top to use as a remote... Is that something you can do on an iphone? I've seen those infrared jack (3.5mm) plugs that can turn your "average" phone into a remote. You can get them for iphones also. Iphone with 3.5 jack, wireless charging, and infrared? hehehe
Or get an android... just sayin. Seriously though I enjoy watching your vids.
iPhone 6s please! i need it badly.
The video stabilisation on this makes me sick
39 minutes... Completely worth it, so hard to see such quality content here on YT! What I most like is that you don't simply show what you did but also the effort you put into making that work, and that's amazing :D
For someone who has lived in China for a while, your Chinese sucks!
Why not tin the pads on the charger? And worst case, couldn't you just precisely heat the flex with an SMT soldering iron and eliminate the pressure fit issue altogether? Just my two cents.
is that 5w wireless charge or 10w?
Watching this, i was thinking, why bother installing wireless charging on such old phones? then i noticed ONLY the latest iPhones have wireless charging, while my Samsung Galaxy S6 had wireless charging back in 2015! Apple really is late to the game on some stuff... Good video however!
Scotty: Okay. So, Uhm, I'm here with Chinese Guy: Yea Scotty: And you have seen my videos before? Chinese Guy: Yea Scotty: So, you only speak a little bit of english? Chinese Guy: Yea
Apple will invent this technology on their next flagship
I cringed when you cut your finger....
Strange parts is a sell out he makes ads about how asia has everything
I wish you worked for Apple. Our phones would have all the cool shit androids do if that was the case.
Meanwhile at the Apple HQ: Guys!!.... He is at it again!!
There is only one thing left... user-replaceable 3rd-party battery, will need new back design and a sturdy redesign of the cavity where the battery lives... will also need a warehouse full of batteries coz I would guess demand would be huge (especially after "performance-gate")
It's not a proper electronics project until you slice or burn yourself somehow.
That guy is great! and cute
That guy was on spot! Thanks for all the time you put into the videos
Wow tried this and broke my iPhone X... thanks d bag
IPad the next time
Awsome! Next, you should try: make Airpods using Earpods. No one done this before.
Can you get a PS4 Pro in there?
Uh that’s a iPhone six not seven it’s rose gold ???????
My iphone 6s Plus mic doesnt work on video calls (fb messenger, imo etc)....it works normally on regular calls....any idea anyone how to solve this issue
So many spudgers
Awesome project! Well done!!
This is so cool! You have to replace an iPhone screen into an OLED display for the next video. Goodluck!
Yeke is very nice. If someone was on Yeke place, he may not be willing to share every details with you.
Please please: Install Custom Android Rom on iPhone!
Please please: Install Custom Android Rom on iPhone!
Next Challenge: Add 5000mah battery into an iphone.

Next project make a iphone with graphics card

Watching you is better than watching movies, thank you for this adventure.
AWESOME as always.

Its weird how the apple company didnt banned your channel

NEXT CHALLENGE PUT NFC ON A PHONE
The stabilization is fucked up; buy a gimbal Scotty.
Would have loved to see this done to a IPhone 4 ????
That is awesome man inprsove
uh just buy an iPhone 8 or above and get wireless charging lol
This one of the best video so far.
You took this phone apart and then rebuilt it from scratch. You have the patience of an old Chinese man. I cannot believe that you have also the patience to wait until you're rested again
32:51 D E M O N E T I Z E D

Question really is how much will you ask for if we send you are phones to do it with parts or pay for parts
Wow
some one is going to get rich
?????
Why not solder the wireless charging cable to the flex connector?
What app was used so you could speak to each other?
When your an Apple fan boy but the features is not enough.
Did you check if your e-compass still works after the rework? my experience in doing that with an external flex plugged on a Note4 was that the solenoid was perturbating the hall effect sensor and the e-compass so the phone was locked like the flip cover was on and the e-compass was just lost.
He did impossible things
It's back packer in china and In Philippines we call that buy and sell, ??
Next challenge: Buy micro-soldering tools and stop pushing stuff in with your fingers!
Yea.
Can you do the same for the Pixel 2XL
Ever heard of the palm pre? You could prob buy just the wireless charging back cover and steal the internals from that
???
You're awesome. What you do here it's so inspiring. The interview was really good. I believe all this effort is really worth it. Congrats!
hey, bro, you should take a bath & change your clothes if you want your work done quickly because by bathing & changing your clothes the body becomes clean and the mind becomes fresh..Lol.Good Job very inspiration not because you rarely bathe & don't change clothes but Make wireless charging to iphone...hahahahha
Ok I will subscribe because it looks like you have some interesting content but I am not a fan of the iPhone maybe you could tackle some other phones.
This channel has gotten me bitten by the tech bug. I want to start modding and working on my own tech now.
I'd enjoy older iphones honestly. Like the 4 or 5.
Ha I like you make a video about to change on iPhone 6s or 7 plus lightning port to type c and increase the RAM to the max 4 GB or 8 GB Ram and increased the storage max 512 GB
hi bro
16:09 What kind of precision screwdrivers are those? They look more comfortable than the ifixit driver.
@Strange Parts can you try putting iPhone 7 battery in iPhone 6s
70 dollars -.- lol
Pls more ads
You rock Scotty!
Great video - Really like the look of the screwdrivers you are using too
PLEASE DO THIS WITH AN IPHONE 4
Been so long since you posted I thought maybe the Chinese caught and ate you.
Wish i was patience as you are
This is awesome, but at the same time I'd never attempt it. Hope the target audience for these do well with it though, I've owned 3 wireless capable phones and they are mad cool :)
I dont even like iOS devices but your videos are always very interesting
Haha all the people in the background when he's vlogging look confused
Next Try to Install 2080 Ti . For more smooth graphics .
Just buy a better phone iDiot
I love these long videos,keep up the good work
make things easy... design a charge port that has wireless charging module pre soldered onto it no issues with lining up things and can use the line from cable without having to use legs on fpc connector Simple
NFC possibility?
Please do a video on your perfect jailbroken iPhone.
Install Android on it!
U deserve ALOT more subscribers!
Your videos just keep getting better and better! ??
Yeke is a cool dude tbh
Maybe try putting the wireless charging on the back on the lighting port? Like where the pins come into the phone connect it there instead of the flex cable jack or make a lighting port with the wireless charging already installed, or make a flex cable and have the wireless charging connected to it so you dont have to worry about aligning it properly
22:29 is that Dj Sona ?
Dang that chick was hella rough with those Flex cables they very fragile
What tools do you use because you do a lot of iPhone stuff and you always have good tools
Your videos are always edited hella good !! They always look hella smooth
is amazing
Say anything 'bout the Chinese, the fact is, they are tech junkies, blows Japan out of the waters. Japan is slipping behind...
Why u don't try to turn an iPhone 7 into iPhone x
Try to put it into a iphone 8 back housing
That was my main concern. How reliable a pressure fit mechanical conenction would hold up over time. A few drops and bumps could easily sever the connection between native flex and aftermarket flex. What would make this hack more robust would be soldered connections. However, the DIY difficulty factor increases an order of magnitude greater than that of a simple press fit connection.
I don’t know why people dislike video! Can any of the 250 people explain to me?
Can you please make different facial expression on next video preview?
This video is so cool I got goosebumps watching it. Yeke's a genius
add another sim card in iPhone 7
there will be blood
I worked at asus for a few years all my chinese friends gave me shit about my big hands , im guessing people give him a bit of shit too lol, never really had any issues but it was always funny
how about 2x battery ? put 2battery on your phone with new THICC coustom case
Dual cam in iphone 6 pls
With how how much it would cost to get a plane ticket to China to get wireless charging I could just get a new phone with it
What an intelligent humble young man. I have been to China on business so many times. Yeke sort of reminds me of the smart and hard-working people that I met during that time. They've got great potential in many ways and they do deserve more resources.
You make awesome vids!
It would be cool if he did an iPhone 6S with the headphone jack and change the lighting cable with usb c then add wireless charging
I absolutely love these videos. Not only do you get to see the tech parts, but you also get a look into the Chinese culture.
New apartment? Since kinda clean
I hope videos like these keep that arrogant asshat Phil Schiller up at night.
this looks terrifying
Awesome video as always, love to see those clever Chinese people. Would love to see more videos, maybe build your own 3d printer from parts from the market kept up the good work and cant wait to see what you do next..
a melody beginning in 5:25 ?please
i love your bag. can you tell me brandname ?
Update 2 camera iphone 6s
Can you put a DSLR camera on an iPhone ?
china number one!
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Next: Adding in-display fingerprint scanner
Next up: How we added Face ID to an iPhone - in China
What does the strange parts logo represent? It looks like the Bluetooth logo.
We need a video on how to get the Apple Pencil to work with an iPad Air 2. I shouldn’t have to upgrade when I already own both just because Apple wants money. Have I not give them ENOUGH!
change camera
Please ask your friend to try and design one for the oneplus 6
You are using Gimbal while vlogging??
No risk of changing the antenna RF field with a non-metallic backside? I am thinking of the SAR value and the certification for that.
kirim ke indonesia,,,saya mau satu yang seperti itu... ??
Name of music
this guy is so canadian
dude stop popping on my recommendation list .... I hate iphone, it's a stupid company with stupid OS and rips consumer's cash. good for this guy who manages to fuck around apple's brainwash but we non apple user are way ahead of monkeys just learning to walk.
Next challenge - add infra red to control home appliances
my social anxiety gets worse and worse the more I watch you walking with a selfie stick in China, all those people turning their heads around
Can you it be done to an iphone 6s?
You look like Chris Pratt man, xD
next challenge: Frontal fash
Great video! How about adding all the modifications you have done until now plus a few future ones into one single device as a "final" challenge? ;)
Greetings from Norway!
You are a programmer right Did you try to create Custom frameware for iPhone it will be Awesome like LineageOS for android
I always wonder what if you put a iphone 6s screen into a iphone 6 will it support the 3d touch?
Should of do that on the one that you add headphone jack
You are a genius
The Chinese, the ultimate in Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
I life in the netherlands and i am a begginer in slodering and rebbaling stuf so my question is Where can i find icloud blocked motherboards for learning greatings from riccardo
You can also buy a kidney or a liver in China
You have a lot of money, why not just buy an iPhone X? These DIY thing is for the poor!
Start @ 37 min
Hey there As I see that the cable just touched together without welding So if you drop your phone much times.Will it still connect together tightly?
why is the title saying "we" added wireless... who is we?
I understand nothing at all but , have no idea why still watchin this vid.
Can you make your own galaxy s8 phone
Omg ur amazing
That seems like an induction coil type issue. Try plugging in a really short cable and see what happens. i.e cut it really short. Then cut the cable off completely and test again just with the plug. That should help tell you whether its the plug or the cable length that is effecting charging.
Very cool, but can you make an iPhone with a Snapdragon 845? :D
Put a headphone jack in it
I love it, you are creating awesome videos each time!
Every time Strange Parts makes a video about an Iphone - Apple cringes. Between the headphone jack and this - this really shows how much they slack. It's one thing for the OneMinus 6 to be a sad, little toy that has nothing going for it, it could make the phone less useful, more expensive and yet save on wireless charging... But it's a totally different when you shit costs 800$+.
Never liked the Iphone bud still i love your videos
I want to see if you can add a notch to iPhone 7 and battery capacity
wow this is so cool....
Next replace the LCD panel with AMOLED planel
Next challenge: Add flexing audio and touch ICs to a samsung!
Add a damm back button like android phones please
Here is a challenge... user replaceable batteries.
When you think you've added enough pve foam, add more foam. Great work man. Keep up the learning.
Amazing, Good Sir... Which app is used for live translation Chinese to English in interview
Ive watched a buzzillion screen protectors being installed and cant do it. Needs asian fingers! ~ Im naming it the REDBACK SPIDER
In China tea in Australia beer ??
I love your passion for this.
Louis Rossmann anybody?!
How about charging efficency?
Just wanted to say thank you so much for making these videos. They show a really cool perspective on China that I honestly find inspiring. It’s almost like how Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown want really entirely about the food, it was about using food as a gateway to learning more about different cultures. I also really enjoy how honest and humble you seem, and how respectful you are to everyone you interact with.
Make the ultimate iphone 7!
Please add an usb c
i bet someday apple will pay a significant amount of money someday to hire you !!!!
Next challenge: adding a headphone jack to the wireless charging iphone 7
Next challenge is dual Sim card in a iPhone if it's possible
I think you put too many promotions on that video
Next video you should add an spen like product to the iPhone and have it slide in.
He went the Wong way
You're a really respectful guy. It makes the whole experience a lot more interesting to watch. I'm subscribing right now.
Your video was very educational and informative. However you make me appreciate my Note 8, with all the functionality you've had to add to your iphone, you still fall far short on the features you can get on a Note 8. You will always have the last laugh however because you have nearly 900k subs, that certainly pays off in the end.
wow,it's really cool things! Respect
You translate your message and show off the translated message to the Chinese guy and his response was "wow... cool..." the Chinese guy has translator built in his throat... wow... cool... jk :))
Some excellent music choices
This video is another interesting by adding wireless charger in iphone wow
your debuging skill is really impressing
Never understood wireless charging. Why use it if you have the pad to put it on. It's the same way stationary like a cable.
Another amazing video! ???? Love your content mate, it's relaxing to watch.
A sd card reader would be cool I feel that is the one thing iphones are missing
Just buy an Android phone = 1000000x easier
I think it would awesome to make one for an iphone 5c because it already has a plastic body.
This was so much more than I was expecting!! such a great video thank you :):)
Haung Wei (sorry for misspelling your name bro!) is super nice man!
2013: niggas I built my own PC 2019: Built my own Iphone
Good job!
i put wireless charging in my DS. thats how cool i am
id love to meet you, i litterally love your smile it makes me really happy! gettin them positive vibes when you smile and i love your vid and u just recived a new sub because u deserve it, #gettingTo1000000subs
It still amazes me how professional these guys are sometimes. The fact that they're picking apart iPhones, and even using their own for testing, just shows how much of a second nature this job is for them.
This man is motivating me to go to china ??
I don't know how to do DIY iphone wireless charger.
Yeah
Try Charge with Some Case.
It's just an IPhone, leave it, forget it, go forward, let's improve, dare to live... seriously, you are much more than this. Millions will hate me for this comment, they also will improve, just a little bit later. I am patient.
Love these videos!
Next challenge , Install 2 camaras in a iPhone 7
why don't you try learning chinese finally?
very good ..... now i wonder what will happen if we ditched the whole idea of forming the back of the phone from glass nor aluminium either and bulid it from copper what will happen ... this will give us a unibody and hard one two ... also don't forgot the wireless charging capability
bruh you want 70 dollars for that kit wtf
I'm so happy that you had upload a new video!
Nicely done!
u r amazing duuude <3
Relying on solder pads touching a flex PCB isn't super smart, it's super flaky when it comes to long term reliability.
Another great video, thanks for sharing your efforts and the local scene. I love seeing the locals and the local markets, streets.
Hello Strange Parts, I love you sooo muchh <3 I am yours biggest fan, Greetings from Czech Republic
i love this and really want to do it, will the kit work on an iPhone 6s?
R u Magneto ? ... by #ambedkartist
Another classic Strange Parts video! Love your style as as well as the cultural aspects you always include!
Do you have the link of the QR code - the video you watched?
Lets do this tomorrow ... Goes to the market? That's a fun way to pass time I guess! :-P
I bet it would be nearly impossible, but my mind keeps imagining an iPhone 7 with wireless charging, a backlit Strange Parts logo and a headphone jack.
very nice editing during the building/taking apart of phones!!
This is over-rated, only a wireless pad was added to the USB connection. So this ain't magic. Such 'hacks' was always existing. He just added the glass back. From chinese standards this is pretty ordinary stuff.
Really loving these videos - thanks! I'm not even an Apple fan (more an Android user myself) but these things are fascinating, and I love the approach you take, showing us your struggles each step of the way. Keep up the good work :)
icloud lock removal if possible
wtf is with the random cut to buda being burned by hot water
How to talk to people in China if they do not know English: I just talk Chinese
Would the SE ever get this?
apple needs to hire Scotty already...
Apple, take notes.
I'd definitely be interested in a 6s (or 6s plus) version of this kit. Hopefully your store does well and you can expand soon!
We were supposed to have instant translation to have face to face conversation like nothing was in between.. Instead we have some electronic voice activated dictionary.. Future sucks..
This might sound crazy, but if possible can u make an expandable memory slot like samsung had ?
awesome!
Chinese people seem amazing.
i am vietnamese . B?i vì tôi ko nói t?t ti?ng anh nhung r?t thích xem video c?a anh . Anh có th? ch? type c cho iphone du?c không ???
Can it working with ip 5s?
You can buy this wireless charging flex cable off Aliexpress and it is relatively cheap
Oh boy I am in Shenzhen my self I have watch all your videos from Miami Florida and took the adventure to here
I thought that that guy was Mike Chen. Rotfl
hey, can you do project on android phone, like building it from scratch
?D?o?r?a? ?t?h?e? ?e?x?p?l?o?r?e?r?
Next vid: face id
you should make your own smart phone bro.. and I will buy it for sure.. hehheee..
next project: install stock android
I have never had to watch/skip so many ads on a video before, it made watching this so painful! :-(
You.are.awesome.
Apple is CRAP.... Buy a real phone, with wireless installed from new, ANDROID! ??
Totaling inspiring dude!!!! I dig it all because i a;ways wanted to do stuff like u do. Keep it upllll Following 4 lifel Thanks for sharing...
?????
Apple's managers should see this video and give resignations
So, how much is a refurbished iPhone X? And, can you buy refurbished gaming laptops?
How do you post on YouTube in China? Or do you go back to ur country to post?
waterproof iphone 6 or iphone 7
all these days you spend on that will NEVER compensate the hundrets and thousends of times you would spend by just connecting the normal charging cable.
Great videos, you make me want to visit Shenzhen again. I walked around the markets 10 years ago when I lived in Hong Kong.
Dam I would like the mod that makes my phone a disco @ 22:29
I can also buy an iphone 8 red that can do the same things, but everyone is free to do what he wants.
I think it is important to add Vietnamese subtitles to each of your videos because Vietnamese people watch his videos a lot
You have to get USB-C working on an iPhone.
IPhones are trash
I hope you may try to assemble samsung phone especially the s and note series
What is that translator
my iphone has wireless charging :/
Apple should offer him a job
the notch need to die
If they make that in Apple, it would be called as the "iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED Strange Parts edition".
Next challenge: replace ios with android!
Not not note
My YouTube channel
To note ti i am sorry but it corrects the words automatically
Con i react ti your YouTube video i ment.
Con i react to YouTube YouTube video to post it in mine?
I would love to be able to add that feature to my new iPhone 5S build but I guess it's a phone too old to be even supported by these kind of things, anyway, thanks for the great video!
Try installing a 1400p screen onto an iPhone.
Combine all the different iPhone mods on to one, ultimate iPhone.
What!? No audio jack? I'm disappointed in you Scotty :(
can we get this for android phones with usb-c?
Next u should install USB C
Collab with Zack from JerryRig and do something on an Android Phone?
Waiting for a long time for your video.
Yes another one
It gave me chills and I’m smiling almost 30mins total! This is by far your most amazing video! It really is amazing to look at DIYers exchanging their techniques and project. And that custom glass back with your logo is dope??????
OMG, I'm so glad I found this video!! FANTASTIC!
"I really want to do that" wait I've got an iPhone X ...
definitely no DIY for me, I admire your perseverance!
Wow, really great video/project. I wonder if it's possible to make a iPhone SE 2 with the same size as the SE, but with a iPhone X screen or updated specs like the iPhone 8 or X in China.
Amazing video... apple should view this. And apple should decrease the price.
You seem really nice and funny I love your vids keep it up don’t let anyone ruin your career
impressive
I have a plan of buying iphone 8 plus 256gb from China in the month of Oct... (BTW i am from India) after i saw this video that no one has ever done...I have an insteresting question... is it Possible to add a wireless Charging kit to an iphone 6s....just like u did on iphone 7 and 7 plus... If yes then i would really want it on iphone 6s 128gb... i really want it in iphone 6s cause it still have a Headphone jack and can record 4k Video that is why i still love Iphone 6s..
Scotty, do you realize that you are basically turning the iPhone into an Android phone?
Why don't you speak Chinese ? You've been there for a long time it seems, that's the least you can do when living in another country and not your native one (it's difficult blabla I know don't care, its work thats it). Still enjoyed your video
You upped your game! Video editing and phone hacking! Nice job!!! Love your work! You should learn more chinese, to better get involved in the community!
Is it possible to install a bigger screen on an older phone like the iPhone 5s?
Be careful, the Chinese government has proof you bought a phone off the books.
Try making the iPhone 7 all screen front and back!
Aaaah a new 40 minute strange parts video
usb c iPhone
Hi ! Great video !! Which translater did you use please ? Thanks and keep it up !
WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE COMMERCIALS!!!! YOU HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, WHY NOW!!!!
All these people looking at the camera like: Is that guy crazy?
Fake the first and Second guys are the same
Long time no see. I have to say that your disassembling and recording skills have been increased so much. Keep making good stuffs bro!
Hello,can you post your video on bilibili?Your channel on bilibili hasn't been updated for a long time.??You know, most of us can't directly access YouTube in China.Thank you.??
U didnt screw the bottom screws so that might not put enough pressure?
Just saved myself loads of money just swapping my iPhone 7 housing with an iPhone 8y looking one, idk if I wanna take apart my phone again just yet though but this is cool ;d
14:53 for all the shit we (United States) give China for ripping off patents and reproducing at low-cost, expensive technology, they seriously know what they're doing. Man broke out his personal phone to test out a component. Guy knows his shit!
As awesome as this is, I got a weird sense of a coming cyberpunk dystopia at the end...
13:29 I literally said out loud "WELP." LOVE these videos! Big loves from the ol' US.
Pixel 2 headphone jack would be an interesting video
How well does it charge through a case?
"time to take this thing apart"......and completely blow me away. super slick skills brotha. much love and respect.
Is this available for 6s if so can I have a link
you can see the alignment that piggy backs on the connector needs to be "really" accurate!! mis-align it you "screw up" your phone ! NOT FOR NOOBS... p.s. (I'm sure he could do it in one go, but he 'acts' as a noob for you guys! ;D)
Love your videos...
Anyone think that the white home button on black screen would look better? Also, he wouldn't have to replace the logic board
Quality content. 39 minutes is pretty long for a youtube vid but you showed me how you love what you do and its one of the reasons why I glued in watching the whole vid. Really interesting and very educational. Keep up the good work.
Upgrading the memory on an android or samsung phone (without a SD card). Specially a 8gb or 16gb phone for example or even an old 2gb phone/upgrade. That would be cool to see too.
@9:07 LOL fanboy mode
I have i will made my own iphone i like you
Honestly just get yourself a Samsung and you can plug your earphones in while you're cordless charging!
Cool project! What kind of camera rig are you using? Everyone on the streets is looking at you like you're a white guy in China. :)
I always in joy watching your videos..
Man after the video of the headphone jack, I said what’s next with this guys, and you’ve managed to always come up with something amazing, I really love your job and ideas. Btw i recommend you as a next project to add Face ID to an iPhone 7 plus or 8 Plus. Please I’d love to see that. I mean Face ID with the TrueDepth Camera and the dots projector, everything taken from the iPhone X.
sick video as always. keep it up dude.
It's cool if you know how to do it if you don't then you just have to buy a device that already has it
can u show the location plz,im going to Hua Qiangbei right now
What good is this if you can't do it or you can't find someone that can do it it's called this buying a brand new iPhone 8 or whatever device you want Samsung LG that has wireless charging this is too complex to do
Would you be able to do this for me put the wireless charger on or do you want anybody that could do it I would had no way to do it it be too hard to do let me know respond to my comment if you can do it or I can send it out
No Beijing Bikinis in the b-roll, not the real china. Lmao. love the video, keep em coming. What I really love is how a rando chinese guy figured out how to make a wireless charge kit for iphones. I don't know if he copied it or adapted it or figured it out himself, no matter what, damn ingenious.
this is amazing wow
??. ?????. ?? ???, ?? ????? ?????.
Wow. Your videos are so chill. Love them. Would buy kit if I had iPhone but I am android user. Editing was great. Love how chill interview was with tea and everything. Was wondering when those red shelfs that were behind you are now? What is that blue thing you used to disassemble iPhone it looks cool? If there is another channel with same theme I would love to subscribe to them too.
Great video as always! Side question, are you moving? I see your tv and items from the corner nook are gone
????????
The Chinese man that sold you the phone seems really humble, not sure why lol
Would love to see this for an iPad!
Hay you should do a collaboration with Naomi Wu. She is a maker that lives, I think, in the same Chinese city as you do.
I exchanged home button of 2 iPhone 6 and ended up with both of them not working. When put them back on their original phone it started to work. Can any one help me sort this issue. The same happens to the camera,earpiece etc. Pls help.
Really exciting video. So enjoyable
Try converting lightning to usb charging.
These videos could be like 3 days long and I'm still watching him put something on his iPhone and ive never even owed an iPhone
That's so easy in China, a lot of stuff about wireless charging in taobao
23:20 In Brazil we call it "Gambiarra"
Next challenge... Order the Mophie Charge Force case for $50
try to upgrade them to A11 Bionic and put iPhone 8 camera on it
?????
amazing... slowly becoming a fan :) . Can you also make a video on how to make a wireless charger
Where place i can buy refurbished iphone working with cheaper price dude pm mee pless i want to buy
Who else noticed the world cup in the background in the interview
Less feet
Excellent videos as always. Love the effort that goes into your videos.
I have a 7 but I'm moving to a note 9 so sadly I shall skip for now
Indeed, everything is possible in China.
What I got from this video, just pay the Chinese guy to do it correctly the first time.
You should buy the enclosure to make the 7 look like an 8 with a glass back
This is so sick! It’d be awesome to do a phone build with as many of these upgrades as possible! Take a 7plus Do the 512gb memory, wireless charging, and a few extras, including the cool custom glass back and maybe change up the colours a bit. Green would look cool
Hi how about use iphone x screen to iphone 7. It really interesting.
Great new video!
So if you come to visit the U.S. do you feel like Apples Covert Goons ar following you??????
Pretty pointless since iphones have wireless charging already........
These videos are always awesome
??
next thing is to install a micro usb connector lol. I'm joking, install wireless charging on an iphone 4 or 4s then try to add an led kit for the apple logo on it so it lights up. Also i subscribed!
Scotty, your story line and the way this video is put together is getting better and better! I felt like i was watching a documentary on a tv network! Thanks for this amazing content.
I hope this works out for you.. and that Apple isn't going to be a jerk about this. We won the battle to repair our phones.. but I have no idea about modifications.
I would say those "MADE IN CHINA" are actually pretty well-made for its price.
I suggest you to try to make a non waterproof phone waterproof
Next: iPhoneX without notch.
why not invent a case that had this built in , and you just plug it into current usb
Is it possible to change the cpu to that from a new iPhone?
That editing when taking apart the iPhone 7 wow.. big step up in quality 10/10
Would it be possible to do this a on a OnePlus 6, the phone already has a glass back, but no wireless charging.
Next Challenge: Install Microwave + dishwasher
Hi, great video again again! I wonder if it is possible to fix the iPhone 7 home button, when it is broken?
This guy exploits Apple like it's a fun challenge for him, what a legend he is. So far he has added a headphone jack and wireless charging. I really hope he goes in for a USB C connection, if that's possible!!
Useless. Iphone already has it
Headphone Jack - check! Wireless Charging - check! Next challenge suggestion: notch removal I've been blown away by your technical (and not to mention people) skills! If you can remove the notch, it will be the crème de la crème! Since you're a programmer too, maybe you can come up with a hardware and software hack?
Try to make The iPhone That i want and it must have A headphone jack USB type C Face ID Wireless charging
MicroSD slot next.
It would be more reliable if the would sell the charge flex with the wireless module already solderd in.
CR7 minute 5
How samsung did it 5 years ago
WongWei or another, i'm gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha WongWei!
Try to wipe clean iOS and install android into iphone. I wonder if hardware could support it.
Awesome video!
lol just buy one of those external pad and hook it up via lighting xD (just a joke chill)
Great video, love that you are very open and honest about the pros and cons of this. Very interested in one for my 7plus if that ever happens.
Nice video
I like, that you can do a break, if something won’t work out - When I’m working on my old cameras, I’m often not able to do that and I’m stuck to my 100 year olds forever :) - great video again!!! Keep them coming!
I don't understand how modification kits like the wireless charger are profitable. I know people in the US aren't buying many, if any. I'd guess the same for Europe and Canada, and South America and Africa. So are Chinese really buying these kits themselves and taking the time to install them I enough numbers to provide a market?
Customize an iPhone X please
is there a website for buying parts to build your own smart phone?
by throwing that shit in the garbage and buying a super duper amazing samsung
You are insane!! JUST BUY AN ANDROID!! lol but I'm inspired by your mods, great vids
All that work for wireless charging...
I wish there was a go fund me for the kid to open a shop I'd support it and i know a lot of people would...
Change the touch id colour in the next video
Adding expandable memory would be a great thing to add to an iPhone also. Expandable memory, headphone jack, wireless charging, all the things Apple should be doing. I love Apple but they are getting stale.
do you have any solutions on how to fix a iphone 7 that has a boot loop and wont update or restore?
Shame it’s not Apple innovating and making the iPhone better, still lets see what they bring this September. I still don’t think they will wow me though. The only thing they always seem to improve for sure is the price.
Plz do this for an Huawei P20 Pro, its an amazing phone thats only held back by missing that feature, also has a plastic back on default, and because of the camera sticking out you could even get away with making it a little bit thicker with a new shape back to accommodate for that without making it really feel any bigger, ie: you could use like 80% the back for the charging pad rather then only half of it.
my samsung s3 has wireless charging, old shit
Yeh
Add fast charging to your iPhone 7
Cool
I wonder how many have sold so far
Because this is news related to Chinese science and technology culture. For the YouTube mobile client without automatic translation, I hope to add Chinese subtitles, no matter whether it is traditional Chinese or simplified Chinese. Of course, if you can introduce a stable, high-speed, reliable VPN or SS/SSR network provider that offers 180 RMB or less for viewers from China, it’s great. In this way, I/We can watch the Youtube web version that supports automatic translation under the strict network supervision and review of the People's Republic of China, instead of modifying the DNS and Hosts, which is difficult and even failing. Thank you very muck.
Basically: MOAR FOAM
On ios you can download testM app. It lets you to test iphones practicly automaticly.
very cool video
Great video again! Is there a way to get hold of the schematics? I'm really curious.
Nice edit! Very easy to watch!
Very good video !!! you just make them with iphones ? when you will try with android ?
Iphone x
You always have these good transitions using street food but you never buy the foood in video
Does anyone know the name of the songs specially the one when he is disassembling the iPhone 7, thanks
I think u should release video in part as many of us doesn't have that much time plus it will give u the excitment of viwers
Nice!
Woaahhh talk about patience...great vid
I liked the social interaction with the people. Usually a hacker is using social engineering on people. But you work very well with others. I love watching and learning from you.
so he put a jack he built a phone he should put usb type c and just for fun put android to
Haha flashbacks to any project: carefully bending a thing *THWACK*
Scottie, I love you dude but please, get a 4K camera "upgrade"... this isn't 2010 anymore. Thanks buddy.
its not really wireless charging really more cordless toothbrush technology induction lol
37:15 Is it from Yeke or You? You made it unclear because you said you bought 100 to sell to us.
I thought to myself why does he keep working only with Apple phones. Second later I realized all other phones already have these features built in Facepalm
Headphone jack kit PLEASE! Honestly, I think even if it was $100-$150 in parts costs alone to make something that didn't require so much modding as we law in the video you did on it, I think people would pay for it, because unlike wireless charging, or probably soon USB type - C support, which you can get by just spending more money on a newer iPhone, a headphone jack is likely something you'll never be able to get on a phone faster than the iPhone 6S which at this point is 3 years old...
I'm a software guy... and having a great time watching your videos. Plus Shenzhen is like Disneyland for Geeks for me
If Apple can't do it, then you won't be able to... After watching the video... ... ...
You are working harder than pewdiepie and rice gum combined. Credit to this guy
Answer bought an iPhone X and you have that
You make something beautiful! Thank you!
strange parts aka smart ppl. amazing achievement!
Hi, i'm wondering that is it possible for you to remake/restock the headphone jack circuit board for iphone 7
STOP BOTHER THIS POOR IPHONES OR I’ll CALL GREENPEACE WWF OR I DONT’KNOW.... IRONMAN!! P.S. you are awesome.
Translators of nowadays... WOW! I can bet in the future, learning a language is going to be more of a 'commodity' and not a necessity. :D
@ strange parts iphone sd slot!!!!
You could make a fortune selling custom modified iPhones... until Apple sue you for making counterfeit phones using legit parts.
i wan't you to make ultimate i phone 7
Wireless charging Iphone with a headphone jack light up logo annd you have to custom solder it all ??
Etch the glass with your design.
Collab with Zack from JerryRigEverything...plz
Wish u could give me dat custom made iPhone 7 with wireless charging to me... It will be my first iPhone??????
you should have shown that its charging more and more on the last minute rather than talking and talking. its like the journey got to a bad end because of your talk. This is a tip btw to improve your video
conan!
instered of placing the flexpcb below connector, make a pcb for charging port which has additional connection of connecting wireless charge on top of that.
I love your filming style!! When you show how you trade and all! And the music! It‘s really beautiful how you make this DIY videos in an artistic masterpiece!
Where can one purchase a work mat like that?
Man, can you do other phones too
This is really very clever how he has managed to make contact with the connectors! Thanks for the interview, i would like to see you meet more innvoators like yourself there in china! Those videos make me feel inspired!!
What can be done with an older smartphone? For say an IPhone 4? Would it be possible to make a "sleeper smartphone"? or even a two-screened Iphone? (one screen on each side
for how much did you buy that iphone 7 ?
Definitely amazing channel! Thanks for new video ??
Next chanllenge adding Apple pencil inside the Apple IPhone
Feel that I jinxed you when you were using that metal sheet to separate the glass, I was thinking "he's gonna cut himself". Next second, "ouch!"
Everythingapple pro...??????new project
collab with jerry rig everything
Combine headphone Jack and wireless charger
An idea: Soldering the wireless charger flex to the bottom connector flex instead of pressure contact. You'll need to redesign the wireless charger flex with contacts on both sides so you can solder it (microsoldering).
next video : in china we removed notch on iPhone x and installed android 8.0 (Oreo) on iPhone x ????
I love how you put little bits of b-roll between the main parts of the video! Makes the video even more enjoyable
Next chalenge youse iPhone x
Genial, excelente conteúdo e qualidade de produção no vídeo
you can already get aftermarket bottom flex cables, very cheap, why not make a bottom flex cable that has the wireless charging as part of the same flex?
Holy shit..this is so damn cool
I have become a fan of your videos. I come back from office and check out your videos. I am also an electronics engineer, although I do not do DIY stuffs. But watch you turn these phones into something totally different, is really satisfying. Kind of clears all the commotion going in the head. Please continue doing such stuff and keep us engaged. Thank you so much Sir.
888k subscribers! That's like damn auspicious in Chinese belief. En route to 1mil subs, well done Scotty!
is it me or anyone else also think that the reassembling of iphone was so satisfying.. or it was pure editing magic, ??
Next challenge: make an open source phone that we can 3d print
Just wondered if a slim layer of foam around the connector on the logic board to hold the wireless charging flex up against the charging dock connector flex plug would give a better connection without over stressing the plug onto the logic board, maybe even a custom cutout rectangular foam for this purpose ?
153 Apple developers disliked this video.
Great video , i can't see any advantage of wifi charging if you've got to still have the charger plugged in to a plug socket .
wouldn't the iphone 5c be the perfect phone for this kind of a hack?
I'm getting a black t-shirt that just says, "I void warranties..."
nice to meet you. I live in South Korea. I already see your third video. Your actions allow everyone to be addicted and challenged. When I wanted to give up sometime, I was impressed by the video that fitted your stereo jack. So I think it is a fight against time rather than giving up. So I really appreciate it. I wonder what the next video will be and I have another expectation. Once again I appreciate your respect for your actions and inspire countless geeks. PS I'm not good at English and I use Google Translator
This is awesome. Keep it up, Scotty!
Build ur own phone with custom android os
How do u feel about the restaurant in ur part of town using recycled sewage?
why not stack paper pieces rather than squeezy foam
You’ve mastered quality & quantity on the YouTube platform - every video an adventure and a triumph of perseverance over adversity. It wouldn’t surprise me if you managed to build an iPhone SE with a notch and FaceID if Apple doesn’t. Those guys from Shenzhen are just so ingenious!
David fighting A LOT OF goliaths , well done sr!
Love from India
INSTALL ANOTHER OS TO IT
The editing is getting much better
Install wireless changer on ip5s
Install wireless changer on ip5s
Can you please make an update video in the future like a few months ahead about the reliability of the wireless charging?
Next change :upgrade the capacity of the iPhone you know the low battery problem is so annoying ??
i wonder if you would install face id next time
Linus was not respectful to you. Shame on him, you are the guy!
I don't understand anything. BUT IT'S SO FUCKING COOL
Well because of trumps import tax you'll now need to go to china
Scotty, can you share a link to the Tool Brothers stuff if they're selling internationally? Also, which tools you'd recommend.
I'm not an apple fan, but Your videos only gets better. Amazing work!
you deserve way more suscribers, this is awesome
Try to add an OLED display to an iPhone in your next project/challenge!
Stop
I’d like to get a wireless receiver so I can try to put it on my 7 Plus..
I have to say I moved away from iPhone years ago and been a loyal Samsung user since. But I really enjoy watching the videos you do on hacking the iPhone and making your own mods to them. It's awesome to see the collaboration you have with the people you meet in China. Everyone seems so open to work with you and have some amazing ideas and hacks themselves. So many crazy talented people, including yourself. Thanks for what you do and inspiration you give people.
love the video keep it up
Yeah how about installing USB-C Instead of a Lightning jack
And you got yourself an iphone 8.
That's great I've now got a use for laser cutter I bought for thousands years ago on a whim. You have a lot of patience and trust that it would work.
16:34 do not plug out your cable like that your gonna break it plug it out on the plastic part
is a genius :0
will there be a chance whereby you will venture into andriod phone mod?
Why dont you try building an android phone It should be easier
Its amazing how popular this has become starting from adding the jack back. etc its so cool to see what you can actually do
Put "Old IPhones" in the title instead and maybe it will get more views?
First video: How to disassemble iphone This video: How to disassemble iphone like pro
????????????(Chinese???)
Hey I'm loving all the iPhone enthusiasm, but to be truly honest I don't use one and haven't for a while. I'm using a Huawei here in the U.S and I think it be cool to see you build other devices particularly Android devices and judging by your audience so would they!! Thanks man keep it up
Wow, are you really getting 1 Amp of charging current from the wireless charging module? That's impressive- i had assumed it would only do ~100 - 200mA trickle charging.
so pointless
can anyone share more details about yekke how to contact him
i watched all your videos. it's really inspire me . and i also works on HuaQiangBei , hopes could meet u someday..
august 22 is my birthday u made the phone at my birthday what a coincidence
Thank you for showing the failures and troubleshooting!
Since the iPhone X doesnt have a fingerprint scanner, turn the apple logo on the back into a scanner. That has always been my idea, apple logo fingerprint scanner on the back
You are awesome!!!!!
??????????????????(???????)??????YouTube?????,??????????!
Man start producing your own phones in large quantity
This is great Scotty! Finally, a wireless charging iphone! Awesome! here's another challenge for you Scotty, Oppo has released a mobile phone where you can fully charge you phone for 5 minutes. As I check out their website, it seems that their charger is giving an output of 4 amps instead of 1 amp. I don't know if its only with their charger and battery or needs another add on logic board for it.... and I want to see this also on your Iphone. :)
This Caucasian man is humble and secretly good at what he does. He listens carefully before opening his mouth. In this aspect he has very Chinese values and I really respect him
Your editor does a great job.
I want one for my PH-1
China: this is communist country pls stop making capitalist videos Strange parts: How we added wireless charging...
?????? ^?^,,,
add lightning port to iPhone 4s
Buy a samsung note 9.. Video Challenge ends in 2 minutes
I would be all over this if I didn't have an iPhone X...! I can't get enough of watching your videos and how you go through everything so methodically. You then show us your failures/upsets, but also the victories and explanations about what you did wrong. It's a different culture and an awesome area of the world that most of us will never have the pleasure of being in and you make us feel like we are there coming along for the shopping trips... Just as an aside - you should add more blueprint photos to your shop of other things so I can own a sweeeeet piece of Strange Parts to put on my wall! :)
hjust sayin. See thru back with rgb...
Scotty I think you'd make way more AdSense revenue if you split videos like this up into multiple parts! Would also be good as a viewer, 40-min videos are tough to watch all in 1 sitting and then you forget to pick it up again later. This is just a minor note though. Video is great, editing is great. I always love when new Strange Parts comes out :D
Great video, it's incredible what's available out there.
Are they guys playing DDR...dance dance revolutions at 34:13
?????? ???????
he sell that module for 7 dollar ? dang
Your works are good. But however, what you did is like turning an iPhone 7 into an iPhone 8
Honestly these videos have motivated me to want to go back to china and visit this crazy country one more time. Love the videos
Your channel fucking blew up bro. GOOD JOB MAN. That had work definitely paid off. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THESE FOR US THAT REALLY LOVE THE VIDEOS.
In India we call it Jugaad ??
I’ve heard explanations, but why is the accessibility button so popular in China? One reason I’ve heard is there is a fear the button can wear out. It was turned on in this video which features an iPhone 7 which doesn’t have a mechanical button.
The video quality is getting better and better!
Literally turning into an android phone
it is possibe to more "DIY" part in one device? ex: adding a wireless charging, led blink when music turn on and, a headphone jack on one device??
not goner end well like the dreaded apple logo light mod from back in the day for the 4s or 4 cool idea but they need a better design then just foam
this method just looks smart, but connection is not reliable, someone needs to improve it obviously.
Try make the custom Android phone...??
Grand master Scotty
If you could sell it for iPhone 6 or iPhone 6sPlus i'll buy a few and test them out. Maybe I'm able to combinate this with a glowing Logo... Could you try to make a glowing powerbutton wich only lights up when the screen is turned off? That's too complicated for me... Don't know how i could do this...
240p squad!
Why so much problematic. Why cant it be just plug and play. I do not understand the problem, was that the design of wireless coil pcb or connector. Please explain.
Hi could i ask for 1 ip with modding by you?
why go through all this trouble? the adapter looked to only make contact with like 4 or so of the mounting legs of the connector, you could just solder those few connections to it joining those parts before normally connecting them. in fact that should be done anyways! given its for power/charging that light pressure point problem could become high resistance and cause a variety of issues or heating. its neat but it should be soldiered.
Im in my mind , hell yeah that's cool , me in real life changed iPhone 6s+ to Samsung s8+
"Ye"
Could you not just use one of those really cheap wireless receivers that stay on the outside of the case, so it doesn't matter if the case is metal, and plugs into the charging port. Although I suppose it does block the port.
You can get a magnetic charger for that device then it's technically plugged in but it's not. That could work and a challenge with USB C is one I'd like to see
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
!
No need to do all this, just buy an android device like a samsung or an lg flagship with all features you want
Firstly you should ground your self while installing this module. Human body can be easily charged with static electricity. That’s event cause serious damage to the electronics devices.
Hi Im your biggest fans in China I very very hope u release you video to China video web. and Translate to Chinese. like LTT in http://bilibili.com Have their channel https://space.bilibili.com/12434430/#/ My english no good hope u can read it
What translation app are you using
I wish youtube will stop pushing your videos on my recommended feed. not interested.
what iphone are you using now? iphone x?
i wish I could get mod on my oneplus 6 by using sort of the way you modded on your iphone cause the op6 was released w glass back of the phone w/o the wireless function
Oh man! You meet some brilliant minds out there. Most of the 'hacks' and 'DIY' minds are influcenced by the western minds so the rest of the world us just follows but the great firewall makes these guys more original maybe? Any case this is great.
Congratulations you got an iPhone 8
Yeke is a Chinese god.
He is popular just because of apple..what a brand apple is .damn
Install notification led on iPhone Next project .
or buy an iPhone 8)))
How can you sure that wireless charging from those parts will be safe? it must be programmed in the motherboard ( for charging and safety purpose ) remember how samsung galaxy note 7 started exploded just because there were issue with the program that didn't pass the signal to the motherboard that phone is charged and charging signal from the wall should be block in order to avoid overcharged.
You have a lot of patience.
awesome video
Your work is Awesome sir
Love your videos <3
EEV, GreatScott, Strange Parts, Louis Rossman must do a cross over
For some reason i wan't to see you build an iphone x
Well this 39 minutes video went like a magic , thanks man
Man, whats your main job? Are you a programmer?
song name 5:25
Algorithm
Srange Parts is the proof that Apple makes inferior phones by design. I'm sure that there are tons of clever people working at Apple which can do what Strange Parts does, Apple only choses to make the phones inferior to make more money. Do not support companies like this, buy other brands.
Toooo many ads!
Hey Scott I live in shenzhen and I speak decent english and perfect chinese, I am also into tech (phone laptop camera etc), let me know if you need help looking for strange parts or a free human flesh translator, i think i will be able to help :)
that guy sells himself so short, what he does is nothing short of talented!
Is there not an aliexpress link for just the circuit and not the whole package like on his site?
Here's a thought, why don't you make an i-phone 11 in your own case with 1 tb memory, IP10 guts and everything you want into your own style case, mega battery the works rather than using old and making it later.
Your great man. I'm your fan from India Kerala
He made that in a tiny shop. Imagine what he can make out of rocket parts in a cave.
Can you please do a USB-C installement iphone 7 version
Those 133 dislike are apple employee who dosen't like what strange parts do. ??
How about Apple's newest a11 bionic chip & iOS 12 update in an iPhone 3g ?
I love the people in the background XD Good job scotty! Keep going man, love your videos! Always!
You've got great skills, well done. :-)
Step 1: Throw it out the window Step 2: Buy a Galaxy Note 9 Step 3: Use wireless charging
I hope you get to sell those kits, down really know if many people are willing to risk their iphone over this
Quick question it's probably silly but how do u remember how to put every single tiny piece back when u took them all out in the beginning? What if you put them in wrong
Hi your link dont work! it should be this one, thanks google https://store.strangeparts.com/products/iphone-7-wireless-charging-kit
anyone know what the song is at 5:25?
That LED Light mod is really chinese aesthetic
thats no good. you turned the iphone into an android.
9:16
Just buy an iphone 8
That little piece of rubber you pulled out from under the battery is supposed to be pulled upwards to pull the battery out
Oh so that black dude from tokyo drift was a backpacker huh
Hello! This this open source? I think you can IMPROVE reliability by creating a new design which include not just this hack but also usb connector and everything related to this on 1 flex cable and place motherbord connector onto it. It will be more easily to install just by replacing standard usb flex by new desig and also more reliable.
China is a amazing place.. Me and a friend is gonna visit just because of your videos !
Started a company that build custom iPhone. ?? maybe that's the only way I'll use an iPhone.
Hahaha DIY =) complete kit for wireless charging nice!! You should test some extra stuff like listening to music with a jack adapter and charging at the same time. But this is truly awesome. Apple probably won't like this
Srange Parts ! how much did the iphone 7 cost ?
Now, do it on your Strange Parts iPhone.
Dude why dont u add face id in iphone 7 ??
What have you not done? Honestly like next a rocketship out of an iPhone
Could you make I phone 6s to case I phone 8
Can someone tell me: iPhone 7 boot up without the home button? Or ir stuck on apple logo? Thanks.
next challenge : Transform an apple phone into a samsung one
22:18 lol
Nice job mate.......
iPhone X without a notch? XD
You can only do that with plastic backcovers
With all those upgrades you're gonna turn your IPhone into an Android
Since it is just sandwiched, just shaking the phone hard would disconnect the pins. Better if you could solder the power pins themselves.
Thought when you changed the dock you would lose the Touch ID
Buy a iphone 7 16gb version.. upgrade to 128gb storage + wireless charge... thats superb...
Please make an Android with i phone......!!!!
You're awesome, keep doing awesome stuff!
Please include the prices too..
When you usually see at 40min video on YouTube you never click it because it’s usually boring and far to long, but when it’s strange parts the longer the better because the whole video is a learning experience for everyone involved. Keep up the content love watch your videos scotty. Bring on more DIY projects!!
Do you live in China ? Or hk ?
I would love if you could modify my s9 but you I know you cant but I really love your videos
Next project, design and build your own phone with all these tinkerers from the market. Imagine what these guys could accomplish.
This reminds me of the good ole Nokia days in the early 2000's where you could totally customize your phones and add new features in!
There is an app on the AppStore called testm which tests everything
Is it me or Scotty trying to prove wrong the Asian guy's design
Is the headphone jack still in it now?
Chinese guy sneaking into those dms
It is always great journey of ups & downs in your videos and I love that.
next challenge: Windows Xp on a IPhone
Any chance to make iphone 8 1tb ?
how about wireless charging and 3.5mm jack on the same Iphone??
Just buy a iPhone 8 lol
Thumbs up for the video editing!
you have some good skills. i couldn't be bothered or the talent to do this ,so i choose a company with phones that still have headphone jack and wireless charging, I dont like apple cause they will make their phones obsolete by changing things so they wont work with previous generations
That's why don't be a isheep n do not buy icrap . I mean after paying flagship price for n iPhone still being missing out on flagship features makes no sense...
Ive been wireless charging my iPhone 6s since I got it, using a wireless charging receiver (look it up) the only disadvantage is that it takes the lithning port, which you can plug out if you want to though, but its a great thing for less then 15 bucks
well done iphone guy..
I love how big the phone modifications market is! Who would have thought that this was huge!
You need another camera man.....am available for employment and I have lots of ideas too??
THIS IS AWESOME!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
Apple is just being lazy
Yet another amazing Strange Parts video Scotty. Brilliant idea and design Yeke, I hope you sells a thousand kits. ??????Strange Parts??Scotty?????????Yeke,???????????? http://strangeparts.com/wireless
Scotty you never fail to amaze me and lots other viewers with what you do. I enjoy your fascinstion with your work and really appreciate the passion you put in every video you upload. Salute to you and the people behind strangeparts
can u make the iphone have usb c?
Can u install dual camera like iPhone X ,it will be cool
Basically an iPhone 7 in an iPhone 8 body am I right?
Scott did you change your camera? Video quality is so much better! If you could do tutorials (like idiot proof step by step videos) that would be awesome, especially for engineers in training or has in engineers like myself wishing to go back into the field as a hobby :)
Next challenge install an s-pen and type c port please
Great.. Amazing.. waaoo.. My question is how much does that wireless charging coil costs?
Yyyyeeeeessssss!!!!! Wireless charging for older iPhones
Hey, i think you have to use other stuff instead of the foamtape. Maybe some plastic-retention, that doesn‘t shrink over the time.
Funny how the world cup was in the backround in the TV on one part...and that ended nearly 2 months ago.
Call me cynical but it seems to me that after it is all said and done if you want wireless charging it'd be cheaper and less hassle to sell your iPhone 6-7 on eBay or Craigslist and use those funds to buy an iPhone 8 or X.
bro will you make a video of best iphone x clones in china....
Just wanted to say wow, never seen this channel before and didn't think I'd sit through the entire video but you proved me wrong. Amazing journey, having done some DIY's myself I know the pain of putting it back together and having it break a few hours later. Awesome seeing you persevere, awesome seeing you work through the issues, and awesome seeing tinkerers and modders like you and Yeke doing what you do
Such a great video .. (I own a one plus device) but I appreciate these videos and I believe the colabs are great. Also I love the interview portion of the video however the subtitles went a little fast. If you could slow them down a little bit that would be great. Thank you for this video.
What an awesome video Scotty! Btw, what's the song that starts on 5:25 ?
please combine your custom iphone that you've made earlier like, putting earphone jack, custom casing and glowing logo, adding the storage and this wireless charging module. it would be cool in my mind!
hey i was wondering is it possible to get the ironman flashing led back and the the one in which the light was sync with the music and that light was from both the back logo and the speaker holes....
Wow you already near 1 mil subscribers. You and Jerryrigeverything channel are on the opposite. You build phone, Jerry disamble it. It will be fun if you two have collaboration together.
I can say with almost 100% certainty that this guy is still a virgin.
awesome its too complicated to call it as DIY
And with your iPhone 7 headphone jack mod on this, you can now have the wireless charging iPhone 7 with a headphone jack
What about another phone my radmi 3s prime is this work?
How about cpu and ram upgrade since you already did rom upgrade
I REALLY want you to put USB C in an iPhone next.
Adaptation, Improvisation. But your weakness is not you technique..
nice improvement for iphone 7,
amazing. broooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. but it was too long. hahahaha
Electronic components are getting closer everyday to organic.
While wireless charging is cool to try out it is not all that efficient at delivering power and heat from it tends to cause accelerated battery degradation. I have owned 2 phones that support wireless charging and it is next to useless in a real charging scenario. It charges so slow that you would have to leave it on all night so if you have to do that you are better off just plugging in any way.
You are the friendliest youtuber!!! And your journey is my inspiration... KEEP DEBUGGING LIFE ! ! ! ????
I was looking for a video like this THANK YOU SO MUCH!
How did u fix the scratch on the back ?
i hope you survive china
damn this video make me want to travel to Shenzhen...
Like This sir > Awesome ... good job
Awesome !! Toi bad my phone is a 6s ;)
We said to try it on One Plus 6.
The information and scenes covered in 8 minutes of the video is absolutely insane. You can learn so much just from 8 mins of this 40 minute video
Could just solder the pins (like even a slight bit) on the wireless charging ribbon to the battery flex cable then plug it in, should work, it's just an issue with the wireless charging cable not touching the flex cables pins right
which part of the china i can get it? i i wanted to order it from SG.
Body of iPhone se but big for iPhone 7 to see how it would look? Or is that just me?
Cool strange parts ??
Im sorry man, but nothing is more impressive then adding the 3.5mm jack in an iPhone 7 ??
Great video. Appreciate the time and effort you put into this to make it happen. Clearly this isn't said and done within a day, truly enjoy your videos. Thank you!
It's kinda interesting to see someone with a tremendous amount of knowledge like Yeke working on a hardware market, what level of formation this dude have? I mean, I'm finishing my electrical engineering graduation an I'm not even close to design something like that. He should be hired by some major tech company, or at least start selling this products internationally. Amazing video as always, China is truly wonderful.
Whats the song playing when u take apart the phone at around 6 mins?
Why brought you to china originally? What do you do for work now in china that keeps you there; other than youtube?
Next project suggestion >> You can try to replace the iPhone Lightning Connector for a Type-C Connector :), Great idea to save money and don't buy Apple OEM Lightning Cables Crap ever again. Anyways, good luck in any future adventure :)
Good story. But the product is not. No one will buy such a thing. Too much work to install and very unstable.
"Local man add an feature a billion dollars company struggle to implement."
IMO if you know you would not take it off later, you could just solder the connector onto the board. This would eliminate the mounting pressure problem.
Is there any bigger battery with custom iphone 7 back shell on chinese market? I’d like to have iphone 7 with bigger battery, not bulky battery case :)
I truly admire your perseverance and dedication - keep up the great work!!!
make one for iphone se please......
Just buy an Android.
How i can buy iphones from Wang Wei or other china seller for cheap?
great
do me a favor and come back when your over 45, and post a comment on your current eyesight.. ;)
Next time build an iPhone with a headphone jack and wireless charging
I'm always been a huge fan of u...i never miss your video. Great effort.. i am also trying the same but not getting all the parts..??
The second most electronic device people seem to have in China, CALCULATOR......
I would love to know where (online) I can get THAT USB meter that you used. I don't know if there is room in the phone for this, but if there is wouldn't it be more reliable and easier to install if there was a daughter board with connectors that could bridge the stock connector, the wireless charging connector (add a proper connector to it) and the iPhone?
We should get your friend’s info so we can buy him some iPhones and help him get the money for his shop!
Who will do a Chinese subtitle?
This seems so complicated. I would rather just work and save money to buy an iPhone 8...
First off love these videos. Got me back into modding. Makes me want to try seeing if I can put a wireless charger on a psp 3000. 5v 2amp input is doable just where to connect the qi wireless unit. And will it still let me plug in the ac adapter.
Any time frame on when it will be available for iPhone 7plus?
This brings up the idea, Can you wirelessly change an iPad?
There is one like it but sticks on the back of any iphone and connects through the lightning port
nice of you to take us through all the struggles
Why exactly did you take apart the whole display? Ie top speaker flex back aluminum plate etc.. you didn't need to do that unless u broke the display taking it off.
Nice
I would chuck a little solder on those gold contacts on the cable to give it more to contact with the dock pins.
Can you please make a video on adding volume button to AirPods?
nice project ! ! ! Awesome video again and amazing skills.. you are so genius.. i hope your next project will doing something with the iPhone X.
Honestly, NONE of this is necessary if you just buy a $5.00 EXTERNAL lightning port adapter for QI Wireless charging. These just plug-in to the lightning port of your iPhone and stick to the back of your iPhone (under your case). NO voiding of warranties (if still applicable) and NO disassembly of your iPhone. These can be bought almost anywhere online these days. What's the point of this video, just to say you can do it... Internally??? Not worth the time, effort or risk!
It seems that every time I come to the Strange Parts channel, I never leave dissapointed. Very awesome video! Look forward to more content in the future!
I would gladly buy one if you can get it for iPhone 6.
4:58 When he said “Hey Siri its me.” My phone literally went off??
China is awesome
If you had a website with these modded iPhones I would ssooooo buy one ??
why all these things is possible to do in china (Shenzhen)
WOW! Everything possible in China, especially in Shenzhen. Does it work with iphone se?
Just an FYI Scotty, you can buy colored stickers that go over the touch ID sensor. Fingerprint still works too, works even a little better. Changed my rose gold 6s to a fully black front that way.
as an ee this is amazing. It's also scary that their culture is so competent and ours (usa) isn't. I'd love to be in that culture
You are more innovative than Apple itself
iPhone 7 with Edge screen?
another awesome project, i love it!
Just wondering, did Yeke ever mention how he fixed your phone? I'm kind of curious to know if it was an issue with the installation, the wireless charger, or something else.
we need more weekly videos even if their short.
8:40 Wouldn't adding some more solder to the connector legs make better contact, giving it a little more hight?
??“?”???????????
Awesome video!!!!
this is dope! plz post the 6s
Hey, this might be a dumb question but i was wondering what the mat that you use to take the iphones apart is called?
i wish i have just regular iphone
Man can you make wireless charging for oppo f1s?
How can I get wireless charger for Honor 8 lit?
Stubby Clapp
Amazing as always mate. I love being inspired by your videos and seeing the great work done at the markets that allow people to customize their phones. Keep up the exceptional work.
god dammit man.. i didn't watch yet but i already did hit the like button!! please, make more videos "touring" around China.
Feeling proud to get my idea working love u brother Its me who sent u all that emails(Siyam)
Dude, wich camera do you use?
WOW
I'm an android user yet I still watch everyone of Strange parts videos
Nowhere else on youtube will you find someone who puts this much work into a video, and can manage to make a 40 minute long video entertaining. Really impressive work!!!!
what app were you using to translate ?
iStrangePart Phone
You should have been a surgeon with that precision and delicate work!
China is damn! Seems like one can get each and every tini tiny part of mobile phones there.
Inspyring! Now add a headphone jack!
Wow, another great experiment video! I hope this wireless receiver will available for any Android phone
I don’t know if you know this but Chinese smart phones don’t have play store or google play store services and downloading them still doesn’t work. I’ve tried a couple of things from the internet but nothing worked. I’ve tried on Samsung and huawei. Probably you can find someone in huaqiangbei or you could do it yourself. I live in Chengdu. ??
Are there any for the plus
is Iphone 7+ has more place to work with?
Apple is screaming right now. They are now worried it will make the iPhone 7 outsell the iPhone X due to the price and wireless charging modding.
You should swap the Lightning Jack with USB type C.
Always trying something new ??????
I know it sounds crazy but ive always wanted to know if you could take the iphone 5 or 5s take that and add a bigger screen like a mod almost im pretty sure i couldnt even work but it would be cool. Love the vids scotty
Always good to see you upload Scotty!!
I am probably not going to do the wireless charging, but I indeed want that the Strange Parts logo back. Maybe you can consider sell phone cases or stickers, I believe they are not hard to make in Shen Zhen. I would definitely buy them.
but the question is wierless is not the fastest
I love watching all your vids. I will say however, you are a sucker for frustration.
I love the fact that you show that you can upgrade parts in a phone like you would a desktop, it just may be more difficult.
Dude! Love the assembly music! B-roll of phone assembly
I need an iPhone 6s Plus one... THANKZ!
Does anyone else get that Blade Runner feel? Like when is he going to meet the guy who makes snakes and owls and stuff? I love it!
Love it, but holy jump cut batman lol off to ebay to buy parts
What did you used to do for a living (or still do for a living) before you were making these great videos. At one point I remember you saying you’re not specialized in a certain area as you worked mostly on some other area. I believe you were making ur own iPhone or upgrading the memory 800%.
just buy iphone 8
what do the steps say on 2:32?
As always this place keeps surprising me ?? The work you're doing is absolutely amazing and big respect for that. Good luck in discovering even more amazing stuff on a market. This city really looks like a place I could have fun every day ??
you know they sell things on Amazon that plugs in the lightning port and then you can put the phone in a case and you can wireless charge, much easier.
You should make the iPhone completely waterproof
plz korean sub!!!
if i could afford it i'd pay starange parts to build me a 32gb droid phone from parts found in those markets but alas living on SSD doesn't give a person much "disposable" income :(
If every nationality can work together then the human race can fix every problem! Unfortunately, politicians and the media don't allow for this.
Can you try turning normal apple earphones to wireless airpods?
Pointless
Even though I'm no longer an Apple fan, I still found the inner workings so interesting. I love your videos. You have a knack for explaining complex technical terms in a way that's easy to understand for us some folks.
Adding wireless/Qi charging= easy. Adding RFID/NFC capabilities along with Qi charging= incredible. The title doesn't explain what you're doing. The title makes what you're doing seem less impressive. Wireless charging is just hooking up a coil to the battery. Adding the RFID/NFC is the special part.
scotty thanks to you i was able to repair two iphone screens...not hardcore like you yet though lol
Has anyone tried this with iPhone SE
Wireless charging will really come in handy when they finally manage to remove all of the ports from phones. To waste such technology on mere electric toothbrushes...
Should have chosen an iPhone 4 because it already has a glass back, or a 5c
China is the best place for hackers.
I love these videos??
you truly inspire me. i want to do what you do but i dont know where i should start hehe
I want 1
Wow apple should hire you :)
Love the backpacker marketer insight. So great and human. More details and interviews like this please!
Love your videos. Enjoy very much seeing China. ?,????????
Woww...Iwireless????????
Scotty how about a tour of your home in China?
I believe these videos prove to serve an ulterior purpose. Whether you realize it or not, Scotty, these videos show me, as a consumer of technology that not only is America's technological prowess lacking, it also shows how other companies, even companies founded on American soil are taking advantage of everyone by not providing the latest and greatest to their end-users, even though it could damn well had been engineered with certain advancements in technology in mind. To show the inside of such devices, to do these things companies disapprove the average consumer of doing which ruins their deceptive magic. As somebody who has been concentrating strictly on Apple devices, had you encountered any legal trouble by Apple as of late? I wouldn't think Apple would take such things laying down, as they certainly go after mom-and-pop shops who specialize in Apple repair, let alone one who tinkers with such things on YouTube. I'm curious if you've been hounded by Apple the same way others in the tech and repair space had been.
16:51 i legit checked my phone
Yay! U r back!
This was awesome! Always so interesting and entertaining to watch, can't wait for the ultimate modded iphone video, should be amazing :D
Your great iam watching all of your video....
Great interviews and cinematography. Wondering if foam is the correct coarse of action to take if the foam gets compressed at an odd angle then it won't have the right pressure. So that seems more like the issue. As other comments have stated and I really think the design is great but the right pressure is needed it seems. Silicon or rubber or even plastic does seem like a good course of action but some experimentation with the right size and shape would be needed. Maybe like a full rectangle piece of silicon with the middle hollowed out so it just goes around the whole foam pad that already ships with the iphone... Basically like these shapes: [ Would have added cost ofcourse but the goal is to make this plug and play as the dismantling and rebuilding takes long enough as it is for people like us that aren't going to be pros at dismantling these things. Soldering would make this more permanent but we are trying for the plug and play style I am sure.
where's the custom back with laser etched design and backlight?
Do you sell these phones? I would love to buy one of your creations.
i loved your videos! the name "strange parts" is just fit your videos. all about strange parts. I have a question, can you put iPhone 7 plus' dual camera to the iPhone 7? it would be so cool
what app you used to translate?
the kit is still available as of 9pm eastern time 22aug2018
i hate apple products but these videos are amazing. i now really want to go to shenzhen and just explore the markets.
Respect is so a good thing and you good at it, appreciate it. Like the talk with the designer. However the edits are different, not to want you see struggeling all the of time but it make sense to show effort, to give some idea how many time it takes to solve a problem. Your video's are mostly different, not as 'sleek' like others and that makes an import difference, that's the charme of your video's. Don't try to hide details because it seems not imortant to you or you think it is not important to others (or boring). Try to keep it informative like you did before. The short shots in between of country life is a great addition.
if it were 50, id buy it ,but 70 is so close to 100 to me for some reason, and for that price you should just buy a 5 dollar qi adapter, and put a case on it (which most do to their iPhones anyway) on top of that I know how much you guys probably manufacture these for. there are many documentaries in which describe how easy , simple , and cheap it is to make and produce things in China. i honestly think 40-50 dollars would be a great price. the housing is cool tho.
Hey is it possible to replace a 30 pin on an iPhone 4s with a lightning charger?
Amazing! ??
Are you going to be attending the Beijing conference where they release new products and toys? PLEASE DO, because I? want to meet you there!
Your old customized backboard for Strange Parts is pertty cool :)
Man, I love tech community. It trascends cultures and languages. Great video ??
When you think about it, he is basically just making an iPhone 8
You should make the ultimate iPhone 7 with wireless charging and a headphone jack,that would be quite cool
you have awesome videos man keep doing what you're doing
I know that this video only came out today, but I am a bit surprised that the kit is not sold out yet. I'm sure it is close, I bet it will be out by tomorrow like last time her some something
Anoyher very high quality video, thankyou!
I just use a MagQi with the connection to the lightning connector hanging out so I can disconnect it to plug in Apple Car Play. I've been doing that for over a year. No need to open the phone, I just put it under the case. :) Still, love you vids and the tear downs! Impressive!
i love your videos. continue it man
Its always amazing to see the passion and effort you make sharing this with the world, keep doing great as you've been doing ;) greetings from México!!!
Uhm, I would have used a solid material little piece instead of foam. I think that might solve the issue.
Is the language they speak hard to learn?
FLEX TAPE
See if you make an iPhone with USB-C
Your camera skills have improved so much, I love this video so much :)
Pretty cool how you communicated so effectivily with your Chinese fan. I'm glad he didn't take anything you said the Wong Wei.
So can u put A11 chip on iphone 6?
I love watching your videos. Very intereresting. And these chinese people, some proper brains over there. But my question, why didn't you just get iPhone 8? :D just joking, great video. I have an iPhone 7 too, loved to watch it.
I would love to see this on iPhone 4 mostly because the back is already glass and doesn't already have wireless charging. And cause it's an old iPhone
i don't think its really that hard, since you just have to put one of those adapters in the phone
but the thing is, all the new iphones have wireless charing anyway, but still cool I guess.
Yall out here preaching about how iphones are better but this mans videos have mostly been adding features androids have that iphones dont/didnt for a long time
Someone is going to sell this as an iPhone 8
"A CHINESE GUY"
Why everyone says metal back is not good for wireless charging while all metals are conductive in various levels?
Now add a USB Type-C instead of the Lightning connector :).
The only thing I noticed in this video. 34:27, is that knock-off Pump it Up? Those panels are unlike anything I have ever seen.
The interview with Yeke was amazing. Thanks for taking the time to edit it all together so smoothly. Please keep featuring DIYers from around the markets.
Love your videos. I've been repairing phone for over 4 years now, and love learning more from your vids. So thank you. They are both entertaining, and educational. I look forward to your future ideas. Also, just watching this video gave me a headache. I won't be trying this anytime soon, but I hope there are some brave "patient" souls out there who successfully complete this upgrade.
Foam tape doesnt work? WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY FLEX TAPE
Hi, can you customize an iPhone X ? Like what you did in this iphone ?
very very cool!!!
I have that exact same blue silicone soldering/parts mat!
WTF...nearly a 40 minute video of excellence. Great video work, and an excellent project....I loved every minute.
I love watching your videos so much. Even if they take a long time to make, id gladly wait for them
Do you think this wireless charging mod would work in a phone that also has your headphone jack mod?
I find it sad that the Chinese market chose the most locked phone in the market to make a lot of diying for it. I look forward to an android DIYing video.
Why does the introduction video have the same audio as the pornhub videos?!...
This channel is the only channel that I don't mind a 40 min long video
This is fucking epic man!!!!
awesome video! grat project! and hey! where do you get your music from?
I wish I could be there and try that on my custom iPhone's!!!
Great video my man! I always look forward to seeing them in my notification tab
can i get only the red cover with your logo on it, please??
apple gonna sue this channel down hahaha screw you apple charging so much for simple tech
Are you still in Shenzhen? maybe we could meet up..lol
excellent video, is there anything more you can do to the phone?? seems like you've done it all! If you plan on doing a different phone, Android would be great!
You are a savage and a legend. I love you bro. Best electronic projects i have ever seen.
Have you thought about building a Samsung Galaxy S5 to S7 Phone?
Is it just me or does anyone else want to know where the selves or part went.
Can’t wait for the next video.. amazing.. how about a dual sim iPhone for your next video. !!!
Handsdown,Scotty is the best vlogger and technician on youtube.Props to you Mate.
Handsdown,Scotty is the best vlogger and technician on youtube.Props to you Mate.
Brilliant, as always
what a jigsaw an iphone is
Would you be willing to do any Android phones like Samsung? Would love to see some of the things that you could do with those. Or is there just not the market for that where you are?
That first phone dismantling segment was really cool and well recorded. Just shows how intricate the making of our everyday smartphone is.
I literally want to walk into an apple store with this phone, ask them does it wireless charge, wait for them to say no, then test it and have it actually work ??
You should've used an iPhone 8 body and put the iPhone 7 internals
quit it with the creepy face thumbnails
Woohoo finally a new vid
Definitely want to see the proper guide before i buy it :P
I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S4. All the newer ones have it built in. Guess Apple can't afford to put in a wireless charger so they can sell replacement cords and worn out sockets. My G4 I just pulled off the back. Maybe you can boost the memory for the new Samsung 512GB microSD chips out.
Just plug the beggar in. Seems way too much faff to me and surely now the iPhone 7 water resistance has just gone clean out the window. Yes, it’s an interesting object lesson but there’s no way I’m butchering my iPhone 7 anytime soon.
iPhone ex ???????? its pronounced iPhone ten.....
Just a few thoughts. First you are awesome and you do things I couldn’t imagine myself tackling. Second when people bust Apple’s chops because it takes them a long time to bring new features to market they need to think about the reliability they bring to the table. Yes they lag behind Samsung and Huawei but they want to make sure their products work correctly and I respect that. For what it’s worth while I do own all Apple products I really respect Samsung and I love their products as well.
Efficiency of the wireless chargers are in general 50% so when you see the draw of 1 amps it is actually charging about 500 ma
I live in hk and I would like to go to his store to buy it, can you please tell me where is his booth, nice video I love all of your videos
How much cost the microscope you use
Wonder if he could do this to the OnePlus 6 lots of people thought with the glass back it could do with wireless charging.
Dude you are AMAZING !
Did you change camera? The image quality is better today... ^^
i knew you would cut yourself 10 secs before it happened. always move blades away from body parts, but i guess this advice comes a little late....
If you got an iphonr 7 with the storage bump, headphone jack and wireless charging it would be the ultimate iPhone 7
Awesome vid I wish I could get one for my 7+
You can buy a Qi sticker on Amazon that plugs into the data port to get wireless charging. No need to take apart the device.
I think Apple is searching for your phone number.
In this video: buy an iphone x. lol
Maybe you should sie flexible plastic and print the part in 3D printer instead od foam
Awesome love it
thumbs waaay up !
Hahahaha it won’t be an iphone anymore
Your not a hardware tech. Not even close!!! How long are you working on these 1 or 2 hours a day?
Can we get some iPhone six. I was considering buying an I phone seven just for this. Little out of my budget.
Easier just get a wireless charging case- lol.
So we can use Samsung fast wireless charging for the iPhone?
This will probably get lost in the comments somewhere and I’m sure it’s been asked before... but is there any possible way to mod the iPhone to show a notification light like on Samsung so users don’t have to unlock their phone to see if there’s a notification? Like at night waking up and looking across the room I can see my girlfriends phone blinking blue in the dark but I have to physically touch my phone to see if I have a notification. Is it possible? Or would you have to mod the firm/software to make it happen?
Waiting for Strange Mods Shop
While I quite enjoy your videos, after all this work just for some basic phone functionality I don't understand why anyone would willingly purchase or use an iPhone.
Can you add an NFC ? Writer and reader?
Hi love your vids!!! Could you please put the price of the parts that you use in your projects so we could compare them?
Ooooooo, you cursed. (For the first time)
Well done !!!
My friend, you just proved that the iPhone 8 is useless. Awesome video!!!
great videos, such a great vibe!
Where exactly can i find Yeke? Which Adresse/market booth? Thank you for this nice video!
Life tips from strange parts... I think this is a project for tomorrow... I’ve been saying that my whole life ??
I don't understand why apple did not do the same thing as aluminium is more durable than glass , having a cut out makes sense. I have always wondered if they could have used another material other than glass. In your headphone series you used a special circuit board, why is that not used more in circuit boards in phones ?
you're the guy that built an iPhone from scratch right? how was I not subbed to you before?
Budget iPhone 8 basically.
Now you are a pro iphone destroyer????
now the final act please, wireless charging with headphone jack on the 7! :D
hack the newer phones, add new hardward features like your doing to the old phones, then sell the phones, scale, hire people, turn it into a new thing!
Awesome video Scotty! Just love how you capture the all the problems encountered. Do you know how to get iphone7 working logic boards outside of China? Keep up the good work!
Hi Scotty, i think this idea can be improved a lot with a little modification to the main board connector. The issue you now encounter is due to very small tolerance in the connector for what I can see. If you could shave off the thickness of the added flex cable off the socket, this might even snap into place without added foam. For what I can see, the main board connector makes contact from the side, giving you maybe just enough room for some sanding or shaving off. Keep up the great videos!
man i love your screw drivers all of them send me a link or where to buy them
Almost million subscribers. Keep it up man. I loved your videos. ?? ?? ??
6s please!!!
Won't it interfere when using apple pay? Great video as always. Now put a fingerprint scanner on an iphone x ??
You should work for Apple your videos are awesome
What is the cost of a refurbished iPhone 7?.. Great video!!??
I really love your patience and calmness when things seem to not be going your way. I also think your grin and charisma make welcoming you super easy.
I love how open and honest you are to us, the viewers. showing the real struggle which comes with this mod. I'm sure other people, doing a project with the goal of selling stuff, would probably cut a way a lot of the footage showing how difficult it was to install the thing they want to sell. But not you, which is what I really appreciate. Good job!
4:40 THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS
A small question that i got is, how did Yeke(?) found out about all the pins that he needed at the connector? Did they just test all thr 28 pins (or how many there are) or did they got the scematics somehow from apple?
0:12 "MORE FOREST, LESS BUSHES" lmao
"I'm here with Wong Wei" "ye" "and you've seen my videos" "ye" "you only speak a little bit of english..." "ye" "okay..."
It would be great if you make a shorter videos
Why was the guy waterboarding the little Buddha?
Great video and nice job yeke ????. Honestly I'm good with my port charging
What an absolutely fantastic video! So humble in your approach to everything. It's such a breath of fresh air and a pleasure to watch your content.
In between random video shots are absolutely beautiful.
Can you make a magnetic charger?
You should do this with an iPhone 3GS or 5c they both already have plastic backs.
Is it possible to move the Touch ID to the back?
Another great video...
After watching one of these I always feel that any project is possible... I then try something and am brought back to reality but still so inspiring! I am currently trying to mod an old macbook pros touch pad and keyboard connector to work via usb for a raspberry pi in the casing. (My way of trying to reuse a totalled seawater damaged macbook) and always have one of your videos in the background to keep me persistent and humble in the face of project adversity just like you.
iphone 7 w/ headphonejACK and wireless charging and jailbroken? = best iphone ever.
when will you sell your own merch like shirts and like tech and stuff?
Love the videos you remind me of jailbreaking. you modifying apple's products will surely influence others to begin doing these things themself and truly spark the new wave of creativity and rebels to Apple's totalitarian reign over their products and bring back the freedom of owning what you bought instead of being controlled what you do with it.
You're an inspiration. Your future will be bright
YOU NEED TO ADD THIS TO THE IPHONE 4S !!! so its like the iphone X
70 bucks hahahah im sure you bought it for 1 bucks hhhhhhhh
Upgrades the iPhone 6s or iPhone 7(with headphonejack)with it so your iPhone 6s/iphone 7 (with headphonejack)will be the king of all iphone and also how about some NFC
Hi
Have you tried duck tape it seems to solve everything ??
stop shaming apple xD
Genius !
Love your videos. When you first went viral, to your video with Linus, every video you put out is inspiring and shows what happens when you learn from your mistakes and don't lose sight of your goal. Thank you for everything that you do to provide this content and I would love learn more from you personally about your mindset and what helps you push forward. I think a lot of people want to know what it takes to be so positive like you.
Is it possible to have a type C connector on an iPhone instead of lightning?
Do something with android phones please!
Above all you're a great storyteller. Entertaining to the last end.
Make iphone 7 bezel less :/
How old is Scotty? He looks hot.
How come you always look to the left when you talk? Do you have tourettes or a twitch or something? No disrespect meant, I'm just curious as I watch all of your videos and just noticed it.
this is your best video to date
This guy just basically turned his iPhone 7 in to a product red iPhone 8 just add the a 11 chip
did I hear right? "ni ha" - "don't sayin 'ni ha'!"? 13:45
Pretty amazing video.. always wait for your uploads! They never fail to amaze me!
I need for iphone 7 plus ...
Someone told me that in china there is no middle class. Then why the fuck since the starting of your channel im seeing middle class chinese people in your videos?
Awesome video. I really love this kind of DIY stuff. Thats why i will go to Shenzhen i November to the market and shop some cool stuff. Where can I/we find Yeke if we are in Shenzhen. Like if he is near the Huaqiangbei in witch building, floor and stall number?
I’m a big fan of your videos, thank you for the interesting content.
That looks like an expensive hobby you got there.... nice work.
Only your channel am I happy to watch 5 adds on I enjoy every minute of your videos
Love your videos. Deserved the growth!
oooo sweeet new strange parts video !!!!!!
Yee
I have problem with my iPhone 6, connector doesn’t work if I don’t plug the headphones it is really weird and annoying I used it about a month and it started working normally for a week then it fucked up again I don’t know what to do
You're the Bob Ross of this generation. I can never ever get bored watching you and hear you speak. I wish you could post daily. Keep up the great work!
Nice structure of the video strange parts this is a awesome video
That moment when you think that is just putting a flex cable under the connector easy job , but...No it is not that easy . Even Scotty struggled doint it ,great video by the way keep doing these cool projects ,many thanks
In the past it was said Made in China stands for bad quality. For me today Made in China means a kind of quality of its own.
so this channel transformed into an apple fanboy place?
Very nice video! Although I prefer multiple shorter episodes instead of one very long one. I'd say about 15 minutes max. That also gives you more channel views ;) Anyway, great video, keep up the good work!
Again a great video to watch. Maybe just an idea for improving the product... Perhaps sell a battery with the wireless charging pad (including a single 'connector', without the need of a passthrough) already integrated in each other. The product might be a bit more expensive (as a battery must also be included), but is less prone to error as you just have an 'original' connector to connect, as the passthrough seems to be the culprit.
I love your Videos. Wish you could make 2 videos. One shorter video and one Longer video(which you normally do). I sometimes don't end up watching your entire videos and wish I could see the just of your projects in a scaled down,shorter video.
convert the phone to use a type c usb port instead!
Please share the schematics that he gave you
33:36 its actually an ammeter Sorry for being annoying
Does it have a headphone jack though
Hey Scott! I love watching your videos and I was wondering if you could show us your apartment in a video, it would be very interesting to see. Thankss
I'd love to see you do something interesting with a Samsung phone, but I'm not sure what that would be. I've been repairing Samsung phones for three years now and they are so very differently put together compared to the Iphone. I have a feeling that the Samsung products doesn't have the same kind of after market mods as the Iphone does though.
Do a collaboration with JerryRigEverything
and Strange Parts is at it again!! A BIG THUMBS TO THIS GUY!!!
100k views day 1. Wow!
I was waiting for some time for a new video, this actually was worth the wait... looking forward for the new one :)
Love you did it but if iPhones Apple products in store explode and they make addons to mess with bord battery charging ports and PCB... must be on the back on your mind if it explodes.
My Siri got activated
please add Turkish language as subtitles.
What about replacing lightning with usb-c?
3:33 I bet “yeah” is the only English he knows ??????
I got a Samsung ad lol
Great! I'd enjoy one for an iPhone 6
I tend to agree to most of the comments below - brilliant job, great video, was very interestion to watch! Just one question: was there any way to put the wireless charger receiver underneath the Apple logo so that there was no need in a big hole on the back and the glass and all that? Like, when you was making your glowing logo instead of the Apple logo you cut your logo on the back of a case. Could it be possible to cut an Apple/Strange Parts logo and place the reciever behing it so that the metal back was intact? Just a thought and maybe an idea for a new project and video. ;-)
How you added ads to this video in china
can you make your own note 9? plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Dude you are the inspiration that I can overpass my limits. I am starting to program in Arduino. Good job men.
Great video my friend !
Wireless Charging is the future. Also, this is how I Like Wireless Charging! (Since Samsung Already Have one)
You missed an opportunity to put "GONE WRONG (Blood)" in the title
Next we need the iPhone 7 512gb version with wireless charging and a headphone jack
Thank you for another great video. The assembly sequence editing was great! Now that you have a store selling kits will you have some other items for sale like strange parts stickers, t-shirts, or other kits?
Strange Parts: I want to build a thing China: okay call two weeks later China: as a random coincidence we have built a thing that is magically exactly like the thing you wanted to build. Come next door to your apartment, also a random coincidence, and we will show you how to install it.
Scotty your perseverance is awesome, watching you fail again and again was hard but the way you handle it is so humbling. Thank you for having a crazy adventure and letting us join in on the fun. P.S. never give up on your crazy crazy ideas :).
I really like his videos. I personally don't have skills to do these things, but I am happy to see others doing such amazing projects.
Damn that’s expensive
Does anything actually ever go right the first time?
Next project: Quick Charge?????????
You should start vlogging man you are awesome!!!
Build a Special Phone with Special Specifications like no other phone at this moment.
Well done. To be honest i Love Phones and i have to admit that i would'nt do that by Myself. Too Scared of breaking anything.... or just screw up by Losing the screws.... Greetings From Germany!
wow so not worth the hassle. Thanks for showing that though :-)
Hey man! Love your videos!! Would be hard to make a Pixel 2 with more RAM and a bigger battery and solve the problem that Google seems to not be able to? I see you working with iPhones all the time, so here is a new challenge haha. Keep it up!!!
The only Youtuber that I can watch a 40 minute video straight and still be interested! Love your vids man please keep them up!!
Anyone who wants a 6s kit reply to my comment to let him know.
I think the real issue is that you went out for dinner and came back and the phone was STILL charging. I'll stick with my OnePlus 5T wired Dash charging, in the time you went out and ate, the phone would have been fully charged.
I want a "pimp my iphone" series
how many screws did you loose
Awesome edit by auram and you!
Can you do a video on upgrading the ram on on iphone
That's why I like electronic so much. Didn't exist ... And Someone created. This is fantastic. Congratulations for sharing that.
Yo have yo make a iPhone with Jack wirelles charging logo lightning
I love these projects so so much. Also I feel like your Chinese has improved so good job on that :D And keep the Shenzhen street shots, makes me a bit nostalgic, but always great to see some shots of one of the best cities on this planet.
Why couldn't Apple have given us wireless charging years ago. Just one connector and a bit of foam. Simple.
They should sell it so the wireless charger pad is soldered to a battery so all you need is to buy a battery with it already soldered in. So no need to take in and out the logic board or having to lineup the connector
Can you make a video explaining how you got to this point , you said you were a software engineer (the job I wanna go for) but u do all this kl stuff. Great videos
would you consider making Strange Parts logos the same size as on your phone so that I could put one on my pixel 2xl? I think that would be cool. Thanks for all of your content, really enjoy what you are doing.
Wait. Can you add wireless charging to an iPhone 4S
Wow cool xD
Your editing gets better with every video. Jealous.
Maybe you can change an Iphone from Lightning to USB C
I would love to see a 512 gigabyte iPhone 7 with the headphone jack and wireless charging
How do you access youtube from China? Why do people in China look so strange at a guy who films himself on the street? I thought they were a bit more advanced...
Or just get a samsung, it had it since the samsung galaxy s6....
Now the ultimate wirless charging, headphone jacked, 512 gigs iPhone is possible!! You should totally do it!!
20:59 THAT BATH DO :v
Great Video! Really enjoying to watch you doing this amazing stuff and showing the processes and people behind this modifications! Sorry for bad english skills, greetings from germany! ??
If on IPhones were written "Designed in China, assembled in California" it could be much smarter :D
The Amazing man does it again. Although one thing I would like to know is this, do you think this will cause the battery to degrade and spoil quickly like in a case where a person buys or uses a bad charger for their phone?
You're absolutely amazing
I was just going to sleep at 1.45am and this pops up. Stay strong eyes its only 39.14 mins more.
Scotty, question for you, where do we find that mat that you were using?
Will it work with AirPower wen it comes out
6x Ads? Is that necessary? Maybe 4? ??
Why does the iphone look so tiny in your hand ??you must have big hands
How much did you have to pay for the first iphone?
The real star in these videos is Apple. It shows how beautifully designed and engineered the iPhone really is. Truly a work of art.
What to say , great video keep up you adventures !!
You need to make it have a back light too for the logo AND have it so that it blinks like at 22:26
Are you moving??
At 32:45 what mat is that you are using also you have inspired me to brle like you
I haven't the slightest clue as to what you're doing in most of your videos, but boy is it entertaining!
Can u do that for one plus 6?
I want that phone! I love the color!
Your storage needs more video.
Do you know what microscope camera your using? It's really good quality picture, I've bought two cameras and the quality isn't good at all. Thanks
I'm just waiting for a non-apple project. A premium smartphone is a premium smartphone, you should be able to do this stuff to anything. There may not be as many ready made 3rd party parts, but that's what the channels all about right?
Your videos are very inspiring
Next upgrade, a coffee maker.....
just get a samsung
You sir, are an inspiration.
Can you do it on an iPhone 4 because it already has a glass back?
20:58 You are not doing it right
How to trick people into thinking you have an iPhone 8
i realy enjoyed this video series so much!!! please keep it up!!! greetings from berlin, germany!!!
This is a really fun idea. If I was rich and didn't have exams to worry about, I'd be all over this. It'd be fun to get an update later on how it went with the experiment. How fast it sold out and stuff~
How much is he getting from the 70 bucks?
I am wondering if you could put the bad of the wireless charger below a dbrand venyl thinking
Do u have any for 7 plus?
Can you setup everything and sell the phone
Does anyone have link for this kit on AliExpress?
Just buy an android already!
Awesome video ever want to visit Pakistan ???? lahore just saying ??
This video is so beautiful.
Try to put force touch on iphone 6
Have respect for Made in China products.
I absolutely love your channel. The quality and originality of each video more than compensates for the quantity. If only we had markets like these in the states!! Keep up the great work, hope to see another video soon.
What about ip rating on an older iPhone, you know like the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5...
Hi, well done. Very good work. I like your channel, but 70$ for the kit? I`m sorry, not for the “adventure” of maybe killing an iPhone7. To expensive.
Cool editing. You could of used the conversion kits and made it look like an Iphone 8 which has a glass back. Would of made it easier
bruh these chinese are crazy. The connecter situation is just brilliant:)
Watching this on a charching up iphone lets me look if i damaged the cable everytime i hear this sound.
Your videos are absolutely incredible
Scotty and his bloody red phone :)
Lightning to USB-C conversion ?
amazing video
Next episode: How We Added Self Deployed Airbags to an iPhone - in China
Hi Scotty. How about looking into fitting something like that to the Apple mac mouse so it wont have to use that stupid charging port on the bottom of the mouse ... ;)
U should Collab with Jerry rids everything
What about making a back plate with no hole of lighting connector and make an iPhone with wireless charging only
Can i buy your modification iphone? so great upgrade..
Remove the notch next on some phone with it. That area doesn't need touch functionality but you can take it as a bonus challenge if you want ;)
The thing I love about your videos is that you show you messing up. That is what doing any of this is like. A lot of trial and error.
I like your videos and ideas, now how about taking the inside of an iPhone ( maybe the logic board only ) and put it inside a different phone, for example a Samsung or Huawei phone that has a wireless charger, a headphone jack, dual sims and usb c connector, basically an IOS in an android phone! I think this well be the ultimate project.
Just put a glass back on it and put a wireless charger in it bam you're done
This so amazing keep up the good work scotty.
??????? ???????? ?????
maybe it is better to weld in some way, than to depend on the pressure
Love your vids. So interesting!
Great video as always, I just love you enthusiasm when throwing yourself into a new project! Shenzhen truly must be heaven for anyone into electronics hacking and tinkering!
I absolutely HATE Apple, but I find your videos very interesting.
I think iFixit could be a great sponsor if you want any. They have sponsored YT channels in the past so there is a possibility.
This video gave me chills, honestly I enjoyed it so much! I love how you are so humble and respectful to the people you come into contact with. I also love the fact of all the modding and different ideas. I love seeing a project come together, also love the scenes where the video cuts to different things going on around the city! Please keep up with what you're doing! It's absolutely fascinating! Thank you!
Apple will go nuts, if they watch this??
I’ve been asking for you to do this for months. I don’t know if u did this from my comments, but thanks for this worth the wait
buddy can i send you my huawei mate7 to modify it lol
Could you make an ultimate iphone 7? Led apple, led speakers, wireless charging, headphone jack
U r a amazing guy tht i ever saw u on youtube compared to other
Well excellent, thanks for great video. Love your videos . Can not believe how clean the streets are .
Couldn't the pressure on connector issue be fixed with swapping sponge for rubber? like hard rubber mat cut to right thickness.
Talk to Gamers Nexus They sell anti static matts -> they sell usefull produkts to their fans like you maybe they can tell oyu about shippping and stuff :P
Put a new ram chip in ur custom phone
Hey sorry I’m a repair technician and repair a shit ton of iPhones and noticed one thing you did that isn’t really recommended, on an iPhone 7 screen, always put the plate on before the camera/proximity flex and the home button, I’ve seen people damage the screens and the home buttons by putting the place on afterwards , just a tip??
Great video but always love all your videos
can you start modding android phones too?
I'm commenting since minute 7, your patience and will is to congratulate man , I would've left it open lol ??
This guy just keeps blowing my mind. Amazing.
Only speaks a little bit of English and can only say "yeh" lmao idk why I thought that was so funny. GG tho man this video was awesome!
the conversation was beautiful
Awesome video again and amazing skills :) Your video editing is impressive. From what I understood some is doing this work for you, correct? So a question come to mind. When you are filming your work at your own desk, who is filming? I am talking about the B-roll of the assembly... Thanks for what you do. I think it is in the likes of Rich the guy who rebuilds Tesla cars. No large corporation is protected from the ingenuity of its clients.
It's a sheer resistance issue - the plugged cable with it's connectors have the right resistance to allow the phone recognizing a charge "happening".... though it actually is charging. It has to do with the software and how it's written - certain perimeters need to be served to make the phone displaying the info "phone charging"...
6:36 "thats about it for today" i was thinking 'no already'
What happend to your voice man
As a person who loves tech. These videos are the most entertaining things in the world
Holy heck! This is fantastic, I am inspired by your channel.
the most important thing has the jack?
Try to put dual camera
Now put a headphone jack in it
I don't usually comment videos, but this was an impressive project. Really liked interview part too, gave some depth! Good job!
Been subbed since 40k. And ur close to 1mil! Woah!!
Add wireless charging to a iPhone 4
Knowing you got a Chinese fan base you gotta at least try and get Chinese captions now
Absolutely brilliant!
yea
Just get a android
Will it also work for an iPhone 7 plus?
I suggest a leaf spring from ss steel springs instead of compressible tapes
Wrong way?
Mod a iPhone X
USB type c in a iPhone?!
Love your content! It's so awesome to be able to peer into such a completely different world that I myself would never have lived in or known about without this channel! Keep it up :D
Bro..love you..and what you make...the small dissapointment is your videos are half a day...so I have to watch multiple time..could you make it like a part1/2... One video every 3-4days..just a sugestion..I love you
That connection is very dodgy, I thought this as soon as I saw it, I think it will be problematic unfortunately. Lesson learned don't buy apple, great video.
Real nice just wouldnt it have been easier to use the 7 that you put the headphone jack into? Anyway real nice as always keep it up
Basically an iPhone 8 now lol
You deserve more subscribers then 900k subs
I follow your channel for quite some time now and i really love all your video's its amazing to see what you do and to have a look at the chinese market...i have a question, what is your experience with the Nintendo Switch? Because as you may know it doesn't have bluetooth and I was wondering if it is possible to build it in?
i would love to see a video of you upgrading the storage on a iphone 8 plus just because it is so new and i think there are gigantic options for the amount of storage
What is STRANGE PARTS ? JUST A YOUTUBE CHANNEL ? NAH IT'S AN ADVENTURE ??
i totally love these videos xD
Yeke should have his own YouTube. Damn he's clever.
any kits for a iphone 6?
Subscribed Your video is amazing Keep up the good work ????????
TBH, your videos are getting boring, every video has the same pattern. Bring some change.
Awesome work
Hey Scott! Could you create a dongle which does converts lighting to 3.5" audio jack? Essentially a lighting female to 3.5" male dongle so I can connect we can connect iPhone earphones into a regular audio source.
Great video again and good job Yeke really smart. Today i swithed for the first time a LCD from a galaxy j3. Not that hard for some people but it was the first time i swithed a LCD screen. I bought it online from China. So i like to fix phones but i am just a rookie. I only did a screen swap for a s4 and fixed a few s4 phones by swapping some elements. Now i orded another j3 LCD and hope to fixe more phones. I am a crypto currencie miner and i mine a currency called Electroneum with the phones i buy and fix. A lot of fun. Thanks for this video and can not wait for the next video. :P:P
I am currently at like 12:30 and he's almost finished, why is the video still so long? :D
Great project, but you could do same thing with cheap Qi receiver, just plug cable in charging port and stick receiver to back of the phone, much simpler than all this surgery
Satisfying edits
ARTILLERY ONLY!!!!!!!
Please can you give this phone to me with strange part logo Thanks for yak.nice technology.
do more factory tours please
Steve Jobs wants to know ur location
Really good efforts. Very impressed.
Now make a PERFECT IPhone that Apple has never been able to make: a IPhone with both Wireless Charging and 3.5mm jack.
Is it possible to do this with an iPhone 5?
iPhone 7 +
Nice but can you make it on huawei? Cuz i want to try it too
3:33 "ye"
Hey , amazing video , i have been watching you and waiting for you to make more cool projects , can you send me a private message or an email because i think i can give you a hint to make this very stable. and i you agree i am willing to risk my only iphone that have, take care and god bless you
Are u going to fix that white front on black case ?
What a brilliant young man. I would be interested in a 6s kit in the future if possible. Thank you for the great video btw!
These techy Chinese market-type shops must feel like candy-land for techy savy enthusiast like this dude.
I want to see an iPhone 10 with the headphone jack...
Can u do a q&a about yourself?
Incredible journey, What a impressive upgrade. I have one concern and i thing your struggle is base on that. The connection of the wireless power board rely only on flat cable contact touching the connector soldering. Soldering is not consistent in thickness and shape. This connection is far from being perfect and is prone to, miss connection and oxidation. Clever trick, but reliability??? Keep your good work.
Amazing job!!!!!!!!!
Cool project, and very interesting as usual :) Any plans for hacking an apple watch?
GOOD VID
Nice project ??
awesome video....wireless charging for android
Hello, hello, can you please jointly design the schematic of the automatic disconnection circuit? I want to know if you can, thank you.
Wish i can do in india
I added a pad to an acer liquid Z320, worked for a while then battery seemed dead would not charge. LSS a 1 penny cap shorted out in phone power filter killing the phone, batt etc.........
Respect
Very few YouTube channels will make you get off the computer and do something productive! And this is one of them!
Love your work! it's awesome!
How about designing and make a mass produce phone. better features anything else in the market. Call it SP01. :)
Is there any way you could install a screen like you have it on the iPhone X on an older iPhone ?
I actually enjoyed the ads haha
Nice informative video, like that you also your mistakes/failures. That's part of learning how it works ;-)
When r u gonna come back to dubai
These kind of mods are hard I did similar mod to PSP to add Video out and PS2 controller plug in used same kind of pressure contact method. your headphone jack used ribbon cable much more reliable but not possible in some situations. don't take it personally I reopened and tried my PSP mod kit many times back in 2009/2010.
Awwww man, I really would like to try this project for myself, I already have the tools and have worked on many iPad's in my time, but never an iPhone, if you still have a kit for sale by the time I can afford to buy a used iPhone 7 to try it on, you'll have a customer in me. It's so good to see this not only being produced, but being sold around the world in such a way that anyone can buy one regardless of where they are geographically situated. Good on both of you guys for the design and for having the will to sell this further afield.
I remember when I was trying to wire up an eternal power source for my iPhone 2 with a bunch of AA batteries. All I wanted to hear was that damn happy charging chime. So fleeting.
There no YouTube in China if it’s there we can gain more knowledge
Scotty's alive! Haven't heard from you in a while, was starting to get concerned!
4Real, i LOVE YOU, your videos are awesome and its good to see what is possible at home (with correct hardware and knowledge)
Get infinity display or 18/9 or 19/9 display on older iPhone
6s Pleeeaaaseee :D
Today you made my day!!!!!!
you should be sponsored by ifixit
DIY my ass...das majik
China man China ????
thank u for talking to the creator. its really interesting
You’re the best
Next video headphone jack iphone X
great video man...im commenting halfway through the video and i just had a crazy idea:- HOW ABOUT YOU TWIN-SIM AN Iphone??!!
Engineer question: how do you deal with magnetic shielding to avoid induction heating of other elements in the phone, or is it not an issue? I started a similar project on a ZTE and scrapped it because of crazy overheating issues whenever it was on the coil.
Next is Bezel Less IPhone 7
Why not make an iPhone X with a headphone charger & glowing apple logo Also iPhone 7 with wireless connection, headphone jack & glowing apple logo Strange parts Thanks
What an amazing job Scotty.. congrats!... Is a pleasure see you videos... Chinese engineers are in other level...
sure is cheaper the the 900 euros i pay 4 mine
I would love to see an Iphone SE version
u are in china..why u dont buy a p20 pro?
Can you please help us I am look to buy some products to sell in the UK as I am starting A wholesale business can you please help how to do this when buying from China
I think you should try to put a iPhone 10 screen on a iPhone 7
Woudln't soldering the cutout to connector solve the issue? But I used the external Qi charger patch on my SE below a plastic cover, but heating up is a bit of concern. How does this kit, heat up the battery?
now build the ultimate iPhone 7 with headphone jack + wireless charging + 512gb storage ?
Your video are so long but it's so interesting that the time passes away really loved your work can't wait to try it out
Dude iphones are for children do something more impressive
Grate job Ecco..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you pls make an ipone with usb type c?
Awesome Video Keep it up :) :)
I honestly live for these uploads.
Ah, I can smell the baked Apples from here! ;^) Seriously, THIS IS NOT A NEWBIE PROJECT! I'd suggest some step-up projects before tackling this. I think a laptop upgrade would be a great start. Start with the very basics: Upgrade the RAM and exchange the HD for an SSD. Make sure it works, then take it completely apart, every last screw and clip, then reassemble it. This will get you familiar with compact electronics, but on a scale that doesn't need a microscope. Next, get a cheap used phone with a cracked screen and replace the screen and battery. The main thing here is to get used to working at a tiny scale. Like, no caffeine, OK? Then, take it completely apart, all the way down, and put it back together. Don't start until after a full list of recommended tools for this kit has been posted. If you have none of the needed tools, plan to spend more on tools and parts than the cost of this kit! There is nothing worse than stopping a project in the middle to wait for tools to arrive (that's when teeny-tiny parts evaporate away). Don't be afraid to go cheap if you don't think you'll be doing much more of this. For example, my banana-sized hot air gun cost $8 on sale at Harbor Freight, and my "microscope" is wearing two pair of cheap +2.0 reading glasses at once (which works amazingly well). The Ikea JANSJÖ LED lamp is a decent work-light, so get two!
Nise due
I bet if there’s enough time and resources, this guy can do anything with his limitless tenacity. Inspiring.
Can you collab with jerry rig everything
Another great Video from you
Wow man you engineering the shit out of this things. Apple should hire you but i dont know that would be good for your creativity...
Super BGM Very nice!!!
Brilliant proyect as always, greetings from mexico city :)
Alrighty now i have a question for you this might be challenging and might not so here it is: Can you make an iphone 7-8 waterproof again if u have disassembled it before ?
Is that guys name really Wong Wey? I wouldn't ask him for directions.
100 units is like nothing for those chinese vendors. I think he is only polite.
3:44 PORTUGAL na TV crl!!!!
This guy is amazing one day scotty will make his iphone fly too :D
58 Apple Employe thumbs down
please make a video about modifying iphone 5s
Man I didn't even remember your voice!
1amp to 1.5 amp true small strip that touches the soldered feet of connector is quite n hack that will come to bite you eventually ... just saying.. keep flame proof mat close by when you go to sleep and nothing fabrics close by so you dont die while sleeping on house fire.. It will work for while , but dont expect it to last long as oxygen starts to corrode the contact points when it heats up and cools down and moisture starts to form on connector area..
Is there one for oneplus 6 ?
You're video is stir up my curiosity!! I want to watch more video:)
This is just amazing. Fantastic video Scotty! I really enjoy your creativity for contents. I dont even own an iphone and watched this through. Try expanding your horizon with videos for other devices too like samsung, one plus, HTC, etc. Good luck in Shenzhen!
1:56 Am I the only one who thought he is going to say Dremel?
So, will you make some iphone X mods? Is there something special in China for X's? Thank you for videos.
Awesome video as per usual, just one question. @ 5:35 you didn't disconnect the battery first. Any reason for this? I always disconnect power before I start work on any device. Thank Stranger Parts
Now get that iPhone 7 with the Strange Parts logo, glass back and wireless charging, and put a headphone jack in it! That's gonna be like a Strange Parts special limited edition iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging.
Well done bro!!! Was waiting for your video!
A kit that wouldn’t look out of place on a production line is not DIY. Kudos to all of you.
here's a suggestion for a project related to this one, try adding nfc to a phone that hasn't got nfc.
Every time I see these videos I'm always distracted by the concept of recording people, recording factories, recording businesses. I wonder if the approval/rejection rate of "can I record here/you?" is higher/lower/same in Shenzhen vs. anywhere in the U.S., Canada, Europe, etc.
Make airpods
I think it would be good to invest in a gimball or something because the software stabilization is a bit disturbing
28:15 maybe the iPhone detect a chip in the cable and allows the charging. The wireless charger doesn't have any apple chip and it just ignores it
You should combined it with the iPhone 7 with the headphone jack!
no skip ads
dudee, love that process let's appreciate yeke for his idea awesome
China
Not to brag, but couldn't you just buy an iPhone 8 and put a different back glass on it? Just saying, it really does look like the Product RED iPhone 8 (nonetheless great video and great experiment!!!)
The blinking light mod is pretty sick lol.
Scotty these are the videos I love from you! There so great and this is what separates you from everyone else x
Wow that’s amazing
Making iPhones better than apple
What part of china is this? I don't remember
dying for this in the red in iphone 7plus
God! I love your videos.
China is wayyyyyy ahead ....
Hi Scotty I know I am 3hours late,but still great video keep up the good work Scotty what will be a reasonable price for an iPhone 6s Plus I would like to do some of your mods on it
I don't know why wasting your time On apple
Your videos are always a good adventure! Even for us Samsung users!
Next challenge: Install USB C!!
It’s not the same quality and you have to be specific in where you place your phone
By far the most interesting channel on youtube. Keep up the good work scotty!
i wonder if you could install a speaker upgrade thats more music focused , we have lost audio quality in recent years due to wanting slimmer phones i remember at its peak of mp3 / music phones with like the sony Ericsson walkman phones they had decent volume and quality with a some what decent bass but everything sounds a bit tin like these days. was just wondering if out in china they might have speakers that small that a good that are not being put into phones for some reason . just a thought ! :) great vid as always (or if not do a vid /series of doing as many upgrades to 1 phone as possible) :)
this guy can shut down apple if he wanted to
This is superb Scotty!
I mean if I had that china marketplace I'n my reach, a iPhone is the last phone I would buy.
Well done amazing video/+idea can you do like a part whare you tall us the prices pls
Try to add solar charger
1amp is too slow.
Wouldn't you need the glass backplate to install this?
800th COMMENT GREAT JOB
This is like Tesla trying to tutor Edison. Quite literally, when you take their motives into account.
you're lit bro.
me patiently waiting for a give away
Actually, this kind of wireless charger attachment is very common on Alibaba or other online shopping website, and u can buy it under 5 dollars.
Dude this was sick!!!!
Uhhmm can anyone enlighten me, if apple will soon catch after them? Coz i wanna make the same stuff but in Canada..
I loved your videos man keep going ????
Always wait to watch your videos
Another awesome video. Always happy when new videos come out from you.
In the next episode of Strange Parts: "How to add a bigger battery to an iPhone"
I love your channel you are so calm uaaa support from italy ????
Hey why dont you try to put together the headphone jack iphone 7 you made and 512 gig storage and this wireless charging pad in one phone and make the ultimate iphone
I love watching and learning your channel and even sharing a few long distance laughs. I do have a question... have you ever considered doing anything with androids?
Hey Scotty, Mike Boyd (somebody you might be aware of on YouTube) mentioned in passing he should try and make his own phone in his latest video. It'd be awesome if you guys could collab on something, might be worth trying to contact him! Love your videos Scotty, always excited to see a new post from you!
Finally new vid "!!! why so late !!
Another awesome video. Greetings from Chile!
Amazing video ! Thanks to your videos I’m now saving up cash and hopefully next year I will be walking around in same market -that’s my goal ! As I’m repairing phones on daily basis I very often was thinking about these kind of “extras” mainly just experimenting with parts swapping like Samsung wireless charger connected to lightening port iPhone 6 as you mentioned- soldering it inside to it (yes I manage to get it charging but with screen down - only issue was that it didn’t last long and you could see “something under screen ) as alu body won’t let signal pass ) .. anyway great videos man ! Keep it up !
Apple has to hire this guy for real he's doing what Apple hasn't or isn't
Very awesome video, i like how it is edited and all those shoots with people in the streets, good luck in the future.
Need plastic shims not soft foam
Another awesome video, thank you Scotty!!!!
I think you should make a video about upgrading/adding a new camera to an iPhone.
Wonder if you could take that glass back off an iPhone 8, and replace it with something more robust that could still be charged wirelessly. Even if it's just a cut out window over the charging plate covered in thick plastic. I dunno. hahaha
This video paves the road to 1M ASAP
I really love your videos, it's really great to see what is possible
Dear Apple,Hire That guy who designed PCB unconditionally.
@0:09 Okay, what about the software implementation? Does it work because of the internal connectors?
You are the only youtuber that i can actually watch the whole video without skipping! Keep up the good content!
You are new "Jonathan Ive"... ????????
Another super interesting video, Thanks.
Apple should hire people like these who keep taking things back to iphones.
First day first show....
cool video again! I love the videos, when they have a duration of >30 minutes. Sit back, grab some food and watch :D Maybe some more videos like 'Inside the RFID Stickers from a Chinese Cashier-less Store' would be cool :) thanks!
everything can be happen in China
Holy adds. sets of 2 adds back to back whyyy YouTube this will be your downfall
Best vid untill now, you really getting the hang of it!
Well done dude, yet another awesome video. That jaka dude is a genius!!! Give him a high five from me next time you see him
If the main difficulty is making a good connection around the pcb plug, why not design it to attach by reflow soldering? There is already solder on the plug and a little extra on the wireless ribbon with some user applied flux might make a reliable connection once soldred. If the ribbon were made with Mylar you could solder it directly with an iron. Alternativly, it looks like you were applying foam tape on top of the plug to press the wireless charging ribbon against the pcb? Why not make a thin foam backing for the wireless charging ribbon that gets compressed under the plug when the shield is screwed down?
Hello can you make more Headphone Jack Circuit Board
Waiting for the next video
Excellent video. Thank you. Your subscriber from Russia:)
You have a small link problem in this line: "Music (all tracks licensed through http://strangeparts. com/artlist ): "
Congratulation! Your iPhone is very very smart. It's very very cool your project and your iPhone is approaching an iPhone X! Congratulations on your project for iPhone 6 and for the commitment that you used to learn all this for only one project you've never touched ... Thank you for the commitment you have used...
I always love watching these vids keep it up man !
Why this is not on trending..!
Amazing video!! Been following your videos for a little while and really appreciate the effort you put to bring to us these very interesting contents. Will be in Shenzhen in a couple of weeks to buy a phone, could be nice to get some tips from you. Wish you loads of success!!
Add gddr5 ram in a phone
These videos always inspire we to mess around with my phone
Sir I want it.....
This is absolutely amazing!
I love your videos! I get every time very impressed by your work. Keep on the awesome work!!
Why don't you solder both flex at connectors ?? . Awesome video as always ?????? ,keep coming like these cool hacks .
this is what i call quality content
headphone jack and wireless charging both in an iPhone 7? :v
Everyone and everything in this video was awesome!
Here before it gets viral ?
Shame on you apple
Love the idea. You thinking on working with Android phones?
Hey Scotty, you're in China, but you're posting to YouTube, how do you get around the great Chinese Firewall?
Can't wait to tear down the phone I don't even own yet. Bought my kit and will have fun with my local repair guy, who will surely be begging for more.
Man you are Mr. Incredible!
Are you crazy man
Shenzhen is really a magical place imo
Why don't you put USB C in iPhone That's a great challenge Keep up
finally a video
??????…??
are you going to have a 7plus kit?
You are Genius.
Apple needs to employ this guy
Looks painful
*makes the iPhone 6 screen into a iPhone x
I just wondered why don't you use iPhone 8 shell instead
Oh my god i was waiting die this :0
Great, you incompetently installed a kit someone else designed, and now you're trying to sell it.
I’m a 16 years old boy... and i’m really interested about all your videos and project because you never give up and this take you to have all you want... I think you really good at this thing and I really love this thing in fact I’m doing high school of Electronic and I love Computer Technology... In future I hope to begin an Electronic Engineer and be good in this thing like you... DON’T GIVE UP, you are my example of life for this, really respect you :) P.S Sorry for my English... I’m not still good enough
Would it be possible to put a usb -c input in an iphone? faster charging and more universal?
Great video as Always! I think a really challenging and fun project would be to try and make a phone with all your changes into a single phone, so like adding the headphone jack, expanding the storage, adding wireless charging, and maybe even the light up strange parts logo with the laser etched back case. I think that would be amazing to try and get working even if you fail to get it working it would be awesome to watch anyway!
That restaurant looks good
Please add headphone jack to this iPhone!! ??
I would like something like this for the iPhone 5S.
Scotty u don't reply to our comments. Please make sure u do next time
Damm so now you can have a wireless charging, glass back and 800% storage iPhone 7. Let's call it the 7SP
Only at 26:41 but since it connects to the flex cable parts a "spring spunge" under the cable pressing it upwards would be more logical than pressing it down, there are a bit of air up and down there. Or add solder to the 4 pins on the wireless charger so they get a bit higher. Maybe you guys say that but just had to get this of my chest. Continue watching now :D
Such a unique channel man keep it up!!!
Is there anyway to flash iOS on to the android phone...in previous video while doing expansion of memory of iPhone you copied total code using one kit.in the same way you copy code from iPhone.... customise according to android phone hardware and dump in android phone....
May i have that phone hehe
How can u upload a video on YouTube if u live I China????? Isn't there censorship for yt in there?
When the video ends faster than you'd like- and then you realize it's almost 40 minutes long. Good job man
Seeing translate work that good in a situation like that is pretty cool.
Awesome man. Really informative as well! Keep up the good work
Wow, What a cool video and cool little piece he made! Thanks for making the video
China has like a 105-108 IQ average. I'm not surprised that they're so industrious and creative.
I’ve been thinking about modding my iPhone. I don’t want to have to lose my rose gold though...
You are now my favorite youtuber. I have also come to a conclusion that traveling alone is okay. I love the dedication and fun you put in every video. ????
I love you brother do you love me.
To show my support to your new video I watched all 6 ads that appeared in the video, and 2 of them were Nokia 6.1 Plus.
Interesting stove and water on a meeting table!!!
Chinese market is Awesome...
Amazing! I learn a lot from this video.
I was hoping he would do something like this, I love these videos
I bet these people already figured out a way to remove notches from phones.
I wanted you to try this for a pretty long time
hey dan reynolds
Many people say China is shit they don't know anything......but they doesn't know the people of China is really intelligent. People who says this kind of thing they aren't good themselves....
To be honest I got my matte black iPhone 7 converted into a gold iPhone 8. I haven’t seen any other person in Houston do this. Its basically a gold iPhone 8 with a black screen & home button, if that makes sense. So if I was to get the wireless pad I wouldn’t have to cut anything I’m assuming if my back is already glass.
I have literally commented on one of his videos saying that his next project would be about adding wireless charging to an iphone
Man you never fail to impress with your innovation and hardwork!! Good work.
Beyond the enthusiasm! The 1st video with over ten million views make me doubt this channel will only be the one hit wonder and can't make it to even 100k sub But I was wrong! Good content and good fanbase, all you do is so amazing.
how about a link where we can buy just the internal wireless charging board assembly for our own DIY?
Why dont you get a 90' hdmi connector for the microscope
Can you change lighting to USB type-C?
why do you only do iphones can you mod a p20 pro plz
"DIY" "DIY" "DIY" "DIY" "DIY"
Amazing ??
Where is the best place to buy used/ refurbished iPhone 7 in general thanks if you see this
First
Next video: how to add 3d face scanning.
Is it possible to make dual sim port for iphone 6/7/7p/6p
This is just like the glowing apple logo kit and it would be amazing if this guys could integrate this two mods into one cable refine it and sell it like a replacement back on eBay like the glowing logo sells
@blackgeek
Great video again! You should do the same thing for the OnePlus 6. The 64GB model already has a glass back and i would definitely try this at home!
if the connector is pressed against the solder joints wouldn't it be easier to apply some heat and actually solder the connector to the board? maybe redesign the flexpcb/cable to contain another connector to maintain easy swapping of the charging module. I dunno how feasible that is but I think if that's possible it'd be a lot sturdier.
@blackgeek
I have learned from u a lot patience and hard work.becouse of u hard u got follow.great video sir.??????????.
How about change that screen to an OLED always on display.
is there a DIY way of adding waterproofing back onto a phone once you recked the gasket?
This video is soo fake !! The Chinese guy was using a calculator ???
Typical Apple, you need a cable Adapter for wireless charging...lol
Please do a giveaway of that scratch back glass your signature on it
What is the blue mat @32.41?
Could you do anything other than iphone stuff? I know it's whats been most successful for you but there's so little to work with there.
Does it buzz when using headphones via lightning cable? Just curious
Man that guy is genius Both of you can can do things that we can't ever imagine
I like you d’ont give up easy
why dont you use a jewler monocle to look at parts in the store in more detail?
Great video thanks.. I can feel how much of stress you had it failed.. How energetic you feel when you succeed cz am a tech ??
Really love the new video style
I wanted to watch but had to stop 1 minute in. Fisheye lens and shakey camera made me motion sick and nauseous. Either or in the future please.
Wow so gorgeous with the new pent
You can use an app called test m and it will give you a full report of the phone and shows your what works and what doesn’t
You are an inspiration to engineers like us...great job.
8:50 reminds me of Louis Rossmann's style of videos
Yeke, you a a goddamn genius
Charge time? :D
Hi, I did it. I already bought it and installed it on my iPhone 6s. AND it WORKED, but I don’t know why after I put everything back and everything did worked but it makes the 3d touch on some area of the screen hard to press (iPhone6s) because of the wireless charging receiving module is a little bit thicker than the other parts of the iPhone, it’s thicker than the logic board and battery beside it. but just I said before, it just a little bit thicker. but still, it affects the 3d touch of the screen. So I spent around 2 hours to make it as thin as possible, I pushed it to make it as thick or as tall as the logic board and the battery beside it. so it don’t affects the screen. But I still didn’t make it. At last I contacted the store, they said they want to contacted the company. And then the day after they replied me that the company can’t make it thinner, they also said that the original LCD won’t have this problem. So i tried to install again, I pushed until the maximum and i suddenly broke one part of the module, so i uninstalled it. Maybe I should buy another one to tested it out. I also bought for the iPhone 7, this one is more more hard to do than the iPhone 6s... I put foam on it, put three foam that is thicker than the one that the store gave me because i lost it. I put back everything, didn’t work. Put some pressure, it works sometime. I arranged the position of the module again and again. still didn’t works...... gave up, just put everything back with the module still hooked up. And I found ANOTHER PROBLEMS, the speaker (not the earpiece) didn’t work and the taptic engine is very weird. And then gave up hahahhahaha, uninstalled it. BUT STILL IT’S A BRILLIANT IDEA. I hope somebody will helped me to make it works ??????
Please build a iPhone 7 with wireless charging AND a headphone jack
actually divide the video in parts as it will be easier for us and and it will generate more rewinue and u can do more projects and more frequently
Oh man I ve been following you since day 1, you are teh reaon why I am coming to China this month! but I still have some worries can you please help me out here or wechat me @hmoumine
He's back...cinema mode on
Wow, google translate in China. Every time I went back home on vacation, the damn Gmail wouldn't even work, it used to a few years back even after google quit Chinese market. When I needed to search in other languages, I had to use Bing or buy a VPN somewhere because Baidu somehow always try to give me Chinese results that magically contain some of the foreign keywords even German.
Hey, I'm really interested in this but I'm not really happy with the way the red glass backplate looks. Is it possible to use a iphone 8 plus backplate?
Do you have a collaboration with JerryRigEverytihng? Maybe that would be awesome! Thumbs up!
These videos are so inspirational!!! Thank you Scotty!!!
i bet this guy sells the phones that are robbed in my neighborhood
what do you use for your triwing screwdriver? I cant for the life of me find one that I can get to work
Love the videos all the way from India. Would be great if you have something nice for android phones, like adding RAM as that's the major issue with android phones (old ones)
6 ads..... 6.
So you made an iphone 8
New project idea: water resistant/proof iphone/Android.
Niggardly stop apple go to Android now
I am a Malaysian who know English and Chinese I hope that next time Scott can just record your own or any other people while he saying chinese so it will be great for me or any others people who know both language Keep on dude, you are the reason why i always hope to go Shenzhen
Well I get that it's not easy but I don't get why apple didn't do it until iphone x. I would probably buy an iphone with a headphone jack and wireless charging.(cant stand the notch and the lack of fingerprint sensor though in iphone x)And I am a hardcore samsung user. Damn you apple. You have so much potential but no vision. (Sorry for the rant)
I want one for a 6s
iPads Next!
If you could put a charging coil in your custom phone that would be aweseome
I would have loved to see the illuminated logo show up in the strange parts logo on the wireless charging phone too
I feel very honored to provide iPhone for this project. I love your Videos I will always keep an eye on your work. ???????????????????????b????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?? ????der~ ????
Man your videos never disappoint!
Most informative and best videos !! Keep on the good work scooty !! Much love from India ????
nice and keep it coming i love to do stuff that is not done on routine basis
add USB-C to iphone vote up if you want to see USB-C on iphone !!
Nice !!!!
Sell the 7 Plus kit please!
Much love from Indonesia,,,, ??
lots of love from India we like Ur work one request groom Ur self very well, good work
32:51
Awesome! A lot of other people have commented this but for the next video can you change the lightning port into a USB-C port?
Awesome work man
Scotty, consider doing video card modifications as well! This is the market I'm in, and not iPhones. With the new nvidia cards just releasing perhaps a good opportunity! Adding a custom cooler or custom VRMs for example
this really is amazing!
When everything works...but in minute 17 * insert meme *
Love the conversation with the designer, definitely the most interesting part of the video.
Love every video that you post, it's very interesting and awesome to see. Keep on the good work okay
Great video but maybe change the title to adding wireless charging to an OLD iPhone? Then it would make more sense. Idk just a suggestion. Great video as always! ??
10:47 trying to use a lightningcable with a Anker wireless charger, I saw that ??
Change the charging port to usb type c pleaseee ??
Only utube video that I watch for 40 min
It's always nice to see you fiddle around until you get it done. Appreciate your efforts to verify that it's repeatable! Keep being amazing :D
I watch your videos it awesome
Finly new video
I keep looking at your videos and all the stuff you do to make the perfect iPhone, but it already exists, it's called a Samsung. You could just buy it instead
Weird idea: Is it possible to change the lightning connector to something else ? (USB-C, Micro-USB or something more exotic)
I'm sort of an apple hater. But what you are doing is totally awesome. I've seen your previous projects : making an iphone from pieces, the custom back, the led logo, the 512GB storage version. Keep up the good work.
Just buy iPhone 8
Im guessing at this point you can probably disassemble an iphone with your eyes closed and one hand tied behind your back! Awesome job. Great video.
i love ur videos even tho i dont understand anything
VIDEO WAS AWESOME "RED AND WHITE IT IS SO COOL COMBINATION" AMAZING #INDIANsqad
Just have the iPhone 6S, but this makes me to want to buy the iPhone 7 to test this kit! Great video as always!
I forget that this video is 40mins long. You make videos where it’s hard to stop watching. XD keep it up. Also why not make a cut out in the Apple logo? For the wireless charging. Like layer the coils in a compact style.
He is really good I think even an apple care support guy cannot do this, that is the power of self-learning.
You're amazing man l really love to watch your videos but how do you use YouTube in China I think it's not working there??
is that part can work on others phones? that's a cool part.
He is really good I think even an apple care support guy cannot do this, that is the power of self-learning.
you are a good person, it's nice to listen to you)
9:12 I suspect installation would be easier, and more reliable if the bottom flex to the Lightning Jack etc was taped to wireless charging flex around the edges. Then install the mainboard, and plug the combined connector in.
Started watching it had 19k views, ended watching 40 minutes later and it has 40k views. AWESOME! Super video btw!
That’s is great Job ??
Just casually disassembling iphones in a market stand...
YAAAY!!! I was sooo looking forward to a new of your building videos! Thanks!
Awesome!!!
You’re videos are just unnecessarily long and exhausting out. Why don’t you get to the point
Had a pretty depressed day. Your video lit my day up a little. Thanks. :)
MOAR LONG VIDS
How do you upload to YouTube from china?
Amazing work "beam me up Scotty"!
Happy to see u back after a long time... Salute to ur work????????
I love your Videos
Couldn’t you have put all of the parts in an iPhone 8 chassis? That way the receiver would be behind the glass instead of it just dangling out of the housing
Damn to think Yeke missed out on a video showing how he created this. Would have been trending on Youtube for sure. Poor guy did all the hard work and Strange Parts gets all the views.
Scottie PLZ keep making videos. I honestly jump forward when i see you have posted new videos. You deserve so much more recognition for what you are doing. Thank you man.
Bloody Ham Fisted Gweilo Interesting and entertaining Scotty Keep it up Cheers
9:09 i have the same HDMI cable haha ur great keep going
INSTALL THE LIGHTS ON THE BACK AND THE SPEAKER PLEASE I WANT TO BUY IT
can you put ceramic back for iPhone x and USB? c
This video is going viral. 37k views in one hour
I admire how you work. Again after again you are trying to make sure everything works fine. I went to Gunazhou and shenzen. I will go again for my work and i hope we will meet even coincidentally :)
Love it !!! Thanks for your videos !!
Do an apple watch! :)
Scotty, I hope this doesn't come off wrong but it's kinda great when something fails in one of your crazy projects. It turns into a much better learning experience and consequently a much more interesting video than if everything had worked flawlessly. Now to put a headphone jack back in your wireless charging iPhone!
China is my DREAM COUNTRY! I hate it when people attach low quality things to China. Those guys are geniuses!
Pirate
Any chance of this getting a version for the Iphone SE?
2k likes and 10 dislikes looks like Scotty has a captivated audience
Go crazy and just make your own android phone. That way you're not bound to iOS and hardware limitations. You're in hardware heaven. There is an appeal to making apple stuff do what it isn't meant to do to flip the bird to apple... But I think you could do something crazier.
I am genuinely impressed by the quality and content of your videos. Keep up the amazing work! Love your new edit style with music and culture! (please add some chinese music too if you have the chance!)
Love your vids!
Liked b4 watching ????
You need some glasses!!
2 weeks later: How We Built The Iron Man Suit in China.
This is my favorite channel on YouTube.
????????You can get everything you want in Shenzhen.
wow, 14 of em have already been sold
Why is Furious Pete a tech guy now??
Niceone, keep it comming ;-)
Awesome work, does he planned do this also for an iPad mini? (probabbly not, but I've had to ask)
?????
Off-Topic Question: Can you transplant an iPhone 6s logic board and Touch ID into a larger iPhone 6 Plus? Has anyone tried that yet? My biggest worry (aside from making it fit) is the large screen may not be recognized.
Awesome Video!!! About time you did a new video, I was having Strange Parts Withdraws!!!!! ??
I'd purchase if it was available for iPhone 7+ and perhaps if we could customize the color and design of the shell, this is a great business idea!
YOU ARE THE KING!!!
Realy enjoyed The video!! Keep it going. Cheers from Finland
i know nothing about “hacking phone” but when i look at your video, thats look amazing! and i never bored to see your video ?? keep up the good work bro your fans from indonesia
Now slap a big heatpipe on that rear case
I HAVE AN IPHONE X SO.., I DONT NEED TO DO THAT BUT , THANKS FOR THIS EFFORT IN ALL OF US AND THE BIIIG WORK DOING ALL THIS. YOU ARE PRETTY AWESOME, ANS YAKA TOO FOR DESING THAT WOW.
Many people say that this will ruin your battery very fast? :/
Amazing mod
If you r visiting India,please do visit Bangalore (indias city for tech lovers)....I'm sure you will love it there and maybe you can try some projects there
Ask him to put the kits on Ali Express or ebay. I’d buy them for every model
I just checked out your online store and it's amazing. I'm just wondering how I can build my own online store
That notification is the highlight of my day
what app are you useing to translate in the start of the vid?
Hey is there a way to install a front flash in an iPhone?can u please work on that
Hi
You put so much passion and effort into your projects... That's inspiring
It's so satisfaying to watch you working.
This is amazing what did you done!!!! My mind blows away when i saw the title. You are a realy smart guy. Thank's for this video and never give up this thing!!!!!!!!
The hero here is foam tape ??

YEA
Mod an Android phone just for fun plz cuz I want to see wat u can add to awesome Android
How much did you buy the iPhone 7 for?
Hello Scotty! I am at Shenzhen now. I am interested to put it into my iphone. Which part of huaqiangbei is that shop located? Haha
this video makes me wanna live in china
Where can I buy this for my iPhone X? oh wait...
Nice to see you using a mod that is an actual product, is your earphone jack in the market already? are there "knockoffs" already?
Hey... We would like to see some ANDROID HARDWARE MODS too, please. BTW, love your hardware mods videos
Man why do these people always turn back and look so strangely at you
Oh, My, Gosh, The man, the legend!! The Myth! He's back at it again! Superb video! I thoroughly enjoy all your videos and I'm always looking forward for your next project! Greetings from Mexico!
You should make a strange parts iphone + wireless charging + headphone Jack + light behind the strangeparts logo
Seperti belajar dikelas, caramu membuka mata saya agar tidak menyerah dalam proses kesuksesan. Thanks strange part, to blow my mind know. Nice job man. And i appreciate. I dont care bout the long videos. Cause in your videos, its the education. Once again thanks man.
is there something like this in hong kong?
What about the water proofing after you open the case?
Again another fantastic video. Thank you for your effort.
first of all i love your channel you make good work can you please make a video changing the charger port to USB-C
great work,but why you teardown the screen?
Vídeo top como sempre né. ;)
You should start carrying a Jewelers eye Loupe. Get a necklace version so it's always with you. So when you get your chip thingies you can expect them properly
Now add FACE ID in this...????????
Watch your finger. ??????????
After seeing your videos I wanna visit shenzen and mess around with electronics!
Awesome job!
Superb Videos! Amazing content! Love the videos!
Never clicked on a video so fast...
An iphone that do not have it??????? The single iphone that have one is iphone x .
..and an ace adventure it was! Thanks Scotty!
i think if you reflow the solder pads and thiking them little bit would be better
Thumbs up for your attempt at speaking Mandarin ??
What Iphone you use personality ? If iphone 7 or 8 why you don't buy for youself Iphone X ?
Your production quality is on a whole new level. Congrats!
39 minute video. Gotta get the popcorn ready!
really really nice video
Now I want to make a completely transparent IPhone... Not sure if it is possible but i wanna try it.
Your video editing is awesome
Yeke is cute.
you make good iphone humiliation videos, I like it. With the sky high price, iphone never gave enough features it should
Just buy a iPhone 8+ ??????????
What is the name of the backpacker... Maybe I bought some phones from him
that was great video and i love the long videos
The side bit about "backpackers" was super interesting! Thanks to the fan, and good luck getting your shop!
I so have to buy this even though I'm not a iPhone user and you make me want to visit China!! Damn the people there are so cool.
hey what is the app u use for translating
Appreciate all your vids @Strange Parts!!!
Man keep up the great job. I myself have to left hands when it comes to electronics but watching you work is somewhat mesmerizing. Love the longer format too :)
Again with the iPhone.
Damn I need that for my 6 and 7
Wow
Make a iPhone SE with a glass back, more RAM/Storage and maybe a better processor. Please.
I don't know shit about hardware modification... but seeing you do this is satisfying AF. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
it's just nice to know that some features can actually be ubtained ... good job and thank You for the video  ????
gif that man a cookie !!
Fire ?? ?? ?? ??
you are such a nerd ! In a great way!!! love it! Hope you get to sell the 100 pieces! And Yeke open his shop !
Maybe you should add an USB-C port to an iPhone. This would be one I would love to adapt and have some real world usage out of it.
I want to build iphone 7 red and black with wireless charging ????
you can only put wireless charging on glass back, right?
I hade the same pression issues with a apple light at the back,it was working after several experiments but now my front camera its black ????
Maybe instead of relying on a friction fit which seems to be the weakest part of the install , solder it in directly ... By adding some solder to the wireless charging pads some flux on the connector , then sandwich the two together and heating the wireless charger fled from the back with your iron till the solder melts and it adheres I realise this is like the 400th comment on your video but here is hoping you see it
How much time do you required to take apart that iphone.. Just curoius. Love your project and all the cool stuffs.... ??????????
Please visit India again and do some projects.
Watched the whole video.....these things are so complicated but u made it..well done
just when I was thinking about how you will top of the previous video you come with this........?????????? love your work man....big fan........
Best if you have 8 or more gd ram please do a video for that
Your iPhone is the iPhone that people would really like
Put a fingerprint reader on an iPhone X. This could be a stretch or way to costly but would make for a very interesting watch. Btw Love the channel.
Is it even possible to make an iphone w a snapdragon processor?
When I watch Strange Parts videos, I do not skip the ads. :D Amazing video as always ????
Can you make face ID at iphone 7
Raspberry Pi 3 Project!!!!! (please)
Please add an IR blaster in Iphone.
Can you add wireless charger to my iPhone 6
UNFORTUNATELY Wireless Charging is Slow and very inefficient
40 mins long. I know what I'm watching tonight. Just ignore me while I leave this tab open until then :p
German shop: "I opened and on the first day already five customers came." Chinese shop: "I opened and on the first day I had 450 orders from 60 different countries"
Iphone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging ????
hardworking pays off??????
Why metal back and wireless charging doesn’t exist?
Another great effort but time to start messing with real phones
Just love you bro!
Awesome, your vids always cheer me up. So glad you've uploaded again. Hope you're well? ??
Since you installed glass back Couldn’t you remove the camera ring that sticks out and make it flash with glass back
Need a StrangeParts and JerryRigsEverything collab.
Add wireless charging in Nokia 3310.
Strange parts: Adds wireless charging to an iphone -> Me: Struggles to install replacement battery. +1
wireless charging on iphone, got to watch this
Yeke should be working for a big smartphone company... Someone hire the genius..
brilliant af
I'm not an Apple fan but love this DIY's (Heikè) you do Scotty, Nice to see the Struggles too.. Great B-roll!
name of the translator app do u use?
im surprised that apple hasnt hired you already
???????
I love these documentary kind of videos, keep up the modding scotty ! Much respect.
If you read all comment please like.. I Watch all your video from start to end..
I am gonna give u one idea hope that its work and that would be your next project...its that buy same two iphone one icloud unlocked other locked tear it down transfer the unlocked hdd into locked one and locked hdd into unlock one and restore that both the iphone will be working
Love you ?? The best tech channel
What happened to your stuff in your flat?
Now go to apple service centre and ask them...'why the wireless chargn not workn on my iphone 7?'
Wow! This is an amazing idea! For all kinds of debugging purposes in almost any device these days! One could use this flex-between technique to breakout and probe all pins! Simple and really cool
how do you upload videos from China where all google apps in the region are banned????? including youtube?????
Now combine the jack 3.5mm with the wireless charging
Im gonna go to china for dog festival one day
I love Shenzhen
before it goes to trending ??
Just watching, still not finished. Two thoughts come up, wireless will work with plastic also, it doesn’t need to be glass. And translator Pro slowed you to pair with the other persons phone, you talk in yours, and the other phone received the translation. It’s a well thought out great app. I think it uses Bluetooth, so I believe it’s cross platform also so a cross andriod and apple will work. Ok, now to finish watching the video.
Thank god you are alive
Now, add a faster charging battery to the iPhone while designing your phone so that the battery is exchangeable
Great Vid Scotty, keep up the good work
just buy an 8 or X
Thunderbolt 3?
love your videos but hate your thumbnails
Apple doesn't want to include wireless charging and a headphone jack in their iPhones? Pff, just do it yourself!
Dam! Apple should hire him! Btw I watch all the ads to support you like 4-5 mins long in total ??
Love your videos
The cinematography ??????
No giveaway projects
Lol he triggered Siri on my phone when he said “hi Siri it’s me”
Add USB 3.1 to OnePlus 6
Dude Can you upgrade the back camera of your iPhone to 41 megapixel camera.
This was such a cool insight.
Which translation app do you use?
These vids are amazing!
Cool.
Dude is one of the guys that are chill and fun to hang out with
youtubers get it so easy when i do screen replacements or battery replacements there always 1 damn screw or the pull tabs on the battery rip:(
now do something with android phones pls!
i love the long video thanks for sharing ??
Also, i think one negative side to your iphone mods is that IF the phone is dropped there would be a high chance of it breaking your mods. But I appreciate your vids, theyre very educational and pleasing to watch.
I would love to see a phone with all your current mods: - Aux Jack - Charge Kit - Modded case with backlight - 64GB/128GB upgrade etc... keep the amazing videos coming!
I think the cable activate the chip in cable for charging
This is one of the best You Tube channels
“Yeah”
why do you only do iphones?
Yo dude why didn't you use ur original 512gb iPhone 7
Great work?? ,it would be awesome if there is face I'd unlock on the strange parts phone
Nice vid bro !!!
Lmao 7 ads, I'm not going to watch this on mobile
How many times you assemble and disassemble your iPhone?
can you add fingerprint on iphone logo in iphone x
Soooo many ads
Great video, love iPhones
Great video as always. Im not an iphone fan but i am a huge tech fan and find all of this stuff so interesting. I'd love to go to China one day. It looks amazing. I'd have a field day.
Genius level: 9999999 Adding another limb to iPhone and calling it just a DIY. Awesome.
You're getting closer and closer to building and manufacturing your own phone one day. Looking forward to buying the " Strange Phone 1 "
????????
This is one of the best "Technical" channel on youtube . you are simply best .
But but how about 7+?? And I don’t want your logo i want costume logo?? You know what would be wonderful: A kit of wireless charging+Custom glowing logo of 7 plus in red plz put this in store????????
Hope you're mapping out a place on your wall for that golden play button you'll be receiving soon enough. Congratulations in advance Scotty! Well done! Roll on diamond play button!
Your really don't mind the price ?if you search on chinese eBay taobao
o(???)d good
this is so badass. and i don't even use iPhones.
These are some really good videos
Awesome video. You need to put this in the headphone jack phone. Ultimate iPhone.
I appreciate the long videos than the short ones. Love the edits as well! Keep up the good work Scotty and the team behind him!
This is fun adventure.
Your videos really make me raise my views of Chinese tech
I have a Xiaomi Mi Note 3, you think it is possible to put wireless charging pad in this?
That is so cool dude love your videos
A translator haha
i like how you hand the money to wongway :) (definately not the way it is spelt)
I was planning to do this on oneplus you guys think its possible???
In love with the vids
apple will get his ass soon or later
Loved the editing on this episode. All your videos are brilliant. ??
Shenzhen looks like a nice city
Scotty, you have supreme sneaky camera skills :)
You should try upgrading the memory of a Nintendo switch. You could use that flash memory reader you bought for the iPhone and get the new chip from one of your failed iPhone experaments.
Bro I have some bad news... I think you may have voided the guarantee on that iPhone 7....
It's like you have a magic!!!
This is another I usually never comment comment, but dude, your videos are amazing.
I should've bought iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 case
I don't think there's ever been a time where I haven't dropped everything I was doing to watch one of these videos.
Yeke, bring us the headphone jack \0/
why not do it on an iphone 4 or 4s? it already has an glass back ;D
Here before 15,000 views
Standard wireless charge pad with pass through port or extension cord for usb micro, c, and lightning?
amazing
Your content is amazing
When dad uploads ??
This should go to trending
the power draw is just for the charger there is a big loss in the air so the charger is drawing 1 A but the actuelle phone is charging at a much lower current !!!
I have a very different question. Could the microscope cameras work to take photos and videos normally with a normal objetive adapted?
You never give up, do you?
YEAH
just my two pennys to tour assembly and testing methods: you cannot really expect die charging to work reliably when you dont test it with the phone fully snapped back together, as the connection is a pressfit and relies on the pressure applied by the screen when fully assembled.
please make a netflix documentary
Always excited to watch ur video?? nice work .. keep it up??????
I can't afford a I Phone
who said that Steve jobs is dead?? huh?? this is him....
HACK MOAR ANDROID PLZ Do any of your friends in Shenzhen hack Android stuff? Maybe you could do a collab with them?
Didn’t think I’d wake up to this!
Always full of ideas ?? Keep it up Scotty (and Strange Parts crew of course)! ??
Glad to see another vid! Missed you! Love the vids, channel & your cinema photography. Pretty great. Can't wait for more vids. Cheers, A
Now add USB-C to a iPhone!
I think Apple really hates you
Nice Scotty again! Everytime I see one of your videos I can't wait to be able to move to Shenzen.
Apple really need you guys
Which app u use to translate from English to Chinese
Would you consider building an android phone like you did with the iphone?
The quality of your videos had improved so much!
Nice music
These things already exist ...u can buy them in 6 to 10 bugs on ebay...but they are super unreliable.....you make 39 min long video on this.....???????? What happens to your NFC tag project you told us in last video...I was super excited to watch it...but now I am....??????????
Brilliant B roll footage and editing, I’d hate to see your timeline. Any chance you could post a link to the blue work mat you used in the later part of the video ?
Bro I support you soo much keep up the good work. You are better than everyone
You do some awesome work, man, I only wish you did Samsung phones too,... Seeing as the apple is a slowly dying product, lol
You know how to make someone's day! Keep up the work dude!
This guy is a beast Wonderful work bro !
Is this even an "iPhone" anymore? (X)Doubt. Again great video :D
Wondering if it on my oneplus 6 ??
it would be awesome if they can do it on iphone se
That's so cool and the shots of the city are filling the video beautiful
This is like a TV show
Son glad to see the strange parts posted a new video notification
Im from Portugal and there is Cristiano Ronaldo on TV at 4:41 xD
It's funny how many things you've changed in the markets while being there.
Absolutely love these videos! Great job! Keep it up! ??????
we want fingerprint scanner on iphone X??????????
I would actually buy only if there is your custom case on it??
my contry is called DIY
It would have been more useful if you had done this to a phone that isn't a useless garbage apple product
Another easier type of this thing works with a lighting cable plugs directly into the charging port of the phone and all you need to do is just stick that thing on the back of your phone.Moreover,it sells on taobao for 40 yuan,which are 6.5 US dollars.But the obvious shortage is that when you need to use headphone via the transfer,you must unplug that cable in the charging port.
Interesting one!!!!!!!????????????
Before 10k views ??????????
What do you think about dual speaker in to your phone?
I love your channel Scotty! Very entertaining. I find myself hanging on for the whole video. You do great work Scotty (even though I'm a strict Android guy). I appreciate your great respect for Chinese culture too. I look forward to your next project. Lots of love from Canada! ??
you are truely amazing and inspiring sir !
I love your videos man
Can you buy different color housings?
I need this on my 6S+, already have the led light mod.
You are the happiest guy alive, and never get frustrated when things don't go well at first! I love it.
this channel.. its my favorite on youtube, you are so sympathetic and with a great personality, you make me want to buy a iphone just so I have the same as you, and i am a heavy pc masterace person.
Cool cool
FINALLY THANKS MAN
24:00 i think hardware mods are easier than software mods also can u maybe look for some strange ps4,Xbone parts u can show or other interesting hardware
Thanks God. He's alive!
Next time, please build an USB-C Port into your iPhone 6s! Greetings from Germany ????!
Dude you should work on Apple company
I love it! :D
Gorgeous project! Love the others too! Also could you do an iPhone with a fully transparent glass back? I feel like this would look awesome. ??
Wow, Shenzhen is indeed a magical place.
Cool
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
How many years would it take for a DIY iPhone X?
Great video, like always
God you're so positive,enthusiastic and you are always smiling..you inspire me a lot..??????
Wow cool!

Request, Case cutout to work with existing glowing logos, and iPhone 6 version link! My iPhone 6 has a glowing Apple Logo, and Lights to the music, this was the only other thing I wanted!
Absolute best youtuber on the planet. You rock!!

Could you do this on the iPhone SE?

Yo scottie how is life in china? & nice video :D
Wireless charging is the best way to charge phones
Patience yong one! Lol. Like the WTF
wow damn never clicked on a vid so fast cooll love your vids
Wow that is genius. Who ever thought of that is amazing.
Scotty, you should do a face reveal.
Bro you should try out some other display to iphone like 18:9 Panel to the i phone it will be awesome with iPhone x gesture means the ios of iPhone x????????????????
I always wanted to add wireless charging to any Android
I'm really glad to be subscribed to you. Thank you so much!
Your videos are always so informative and relaxing.
1 year too late :)
I love how you take iPhones to higher levels.
Ah yes some good content to watch after work ??
The idea itself is so cool. How much further can it be customized i wonder?
How Do you even do this??? xD
Wow this seems awesome!!!
How will this mod affect reception??? iPhones use the back metal case as part of its antenna system.
Comment nr. 108 ! Nice :)
Cooool! I want to wirelessly charge my iphone 6s ??
We love you
Your Chinese is improving :)
102 Ali from iraq?
The camera and composure of your videos are pure art
How nice he is!!!
If he can do it how come Apple can't? Well apart from money but this thing is turning into like THE ultimate Iphone!
Dear Strange parts, can u customs ip6 for me with my design? I love to buy it.??????
Not even half way through the video and I already love it
You can sell the all part of iPhone it can help me and all please do it we have to do it please let you do it
Perfect timing, just as food got ready! Watch Strange Parts and have good food, best evening ever! :D
O.k..now What about Android ( Linux) not iphone ( ios)
I love how you had added little bits of Chinese culture in between the technical Parts ... brilliant video
Couple more of these crazy videos and you'll have something sorta close to a Samsung from 5 years ago!
YES FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
early
Finally new video!
I hate talking about money, but I just wonder how much does these projects cost. How much does the "recycled" phone cost?
Let's go SE))
The shots you take of Shenzhen are Gorgeous!!! Makes me wanna go there one day.
niceeeeeeeee!
A new video from Strange Parts, I click 'like' then watch.
YES, another video from Strange Parts. Love this guy
Here before this video gets taken down by Apple and the SJWs
What if you have a jet black iPhone 7 do you then need to get a custom back to get this to work with the wireless charging?
That's so crazy that you guys are using google translate speak to talk to one another. That just seems so futuristic to me for some reason. Great video again!
I watched you video with Linus. Your negotiation skills were lacking bro. You can always get a better price. If your going to live over there, maybe it’s time to speak the language. I used to live in Shanghai for two years and studied and spoke as much as I could. Either way,I enjoy your videos. Do a street food video. They don’t all have to be tech videos. Just a thought.
We learn every time u upload
Can you add wireless charging to a normal Android phone
I think it would be easier to put it on the 4S because it has glass back right?
Here before this video goes viral
This is good! Keep it up.
W??W
i dont own an iphone or can afford it neither do I have any experience with electronics development. I do some web development. But I still love to watch your videos being in Pakistan china seems to be so close but feels so far.
How about changing the lightning port to USB Type C port
Strange Parts is one of the greatest YouTubers out there.
Crazy idea, add an analog controller and shoulder buttons to Iphone- basically turning an Iphone into a gameboy.
Yess finally a new video to start the day
Keep the videos coming.
Finally
you should get backtrack 5 for android and learn how to hack wifi
I bet on 1.5M views within next 48h :)
Early on a viral video
saludos amigo
Please assemble iphone x!!!
I'm a simple gal, I see a new Strange Part vid, I click it
yea
Sir for how long u have been living in China ???
"its 2020, we're going to add a stove and a dishwasher to my Iphone... in China."
Wow
For me it more and more feels like you should get a Samsung S8 instead of all that work... cheaper/wireless charging/aux ;- )
40 minute video to add wireless charging? lol wtf it's easy af
Scotty, try upgrading an early 2000s apple mp3.
Woah! Does this support Fast Wireless Charging or just the standard Chi wireless like the iPhone X?
Those people staring at you at the start ????????
What did you just do
I just write something for likes.
How We Mao-de a Super Communist iPhone ? - in China
??another like
Oooh, almost 40 minutes???? Can't wait to watch it when I'm out of class
Now change the charger port to USB-C
Strange parts is back!

Hi
Does the heat pipe have some water in it?
Hi, What temperature do you use the heat-gun at?
I cringed when you scratched the metal
Can I get 1
I watch most of his teardown's because of the satosfying sound of pull tabs but unfortunately there's no pull tabs here so meh ima pass
5:19 OR you could just disable Bixby and never have to damage or remove anything Edit: btw that was the power button you were contemplating murder on, definitely don't damage that.
Nokia has had that variable aperture mechanism on their camera phones since 2001 or so! I was able to hear it click as it switches aperture! and you can definitely see it
plz any b0dy tell me s9 best or s9plus 0
Hi friend
S9 plus durability test
vibrator
5:12 That's not the Bixby button because that's there under the volume buttons (on the other side of the phone) :D
You can put back camera and will work, but don't have any focus
watches video on S9 plus
U just destroyed my dream phone ?????? Thats it i am gonna unsub!
Realme 2 pro test pls
You can toggle off the Bixby
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" - Zack 2018
I will trade you a brand new iPhone 6 for the Galaxy S9 that you tore down
Glad you're doing those vids, I can get good RMA with them lmao
Who is watching this on galaxy s9 or s9plus?
Watching this on Samsung Galaxy S9 lol
5:12 u wrong :v, thats the power button, bixby is on the other side. Are u sure you want to murder it?
Where can i get this double sided tape?
i love how u roast apple in the most gentle way possible
My camera is getting replaced. Will my water resistance change?
This is an amazing, a very informative video. I learned a lot of what's inside my S9 (plus). Didn't know the mechanism behind the variable aperture and the the flash that is now with diffuser, until I watched this video.
Does the camera have a 10 bit sensor like the LG v30?
No lithum polymer same old cheap litium ion battery
Aaa q hijo de puta eres!!!
I'm tread down my s9 is better Samsung is better company than others
it would be nice to reassign the bixby button to turn on the light instead.
Uhm.... you made a very stupid mistake Jerry! The button you called the Bixby button is in fact the power button! ?????? Bixby is on the other side under the volume button??????
1:20 mini go pro
When you reinstall all back , is the phone still ip68? Everything is sealed again?
Crazy apple disses????
Hi Jerry ! Hope this message finds you in good health. I am very much fan of your videos and i always watch your videos before buying anything. I am planning to buy POCO F1, hopefully you will give us a cracking video soon which will help me to take decision Thanks Ziaur Rahman Bangladesh
yeah....i want to desconnect Bixby cable......
Nice video, can the lens be changed...from a 12 mp to a 16 mp?
Man i still got the iphone 2g
Ð?t m? th?ng phá ho?i
Who else is watching with s9
You l see that in iphone on 2020 hahah ????
please do a S9+
My s9 keeps pausing the video
So does the s9 not have that water cooling thing anymore?
I have the purple s9
Sony camera. Not Samsung..
"Apples are 2 years behind so you'll be able to see this in 2020 in an iphone"... ??
Jerry bro it's very nice to see your video. I need a help bro! Today I accidentally inserted the ejector pin in the bottom mic hole and pressed gently to pop up the sim tray.Soon I realised that it is the wrong action.I checked the mic sensitivity and it works fine! But am bit confusion about the water resistance bro!Does this action causes any fall in water resistance? Please respond to this comment bro, heavily tensed ??
hello jerry , pls could you do a durability test on the xiaomi mi 8
Apple removed the headphone jack and said it's for the future. *includes dongle for headphone jacks
Where can I buy the S9 plus battery
Just pop a little piece of kapton tape on the contacts and bye bye bixby, and its completely reversible. ;)
Trash phone tho
Give it to me please to teardown and look I am an electronic enthusiast like you
Kerren.. ??
Thank you for sharing the video. That was educational.
i learned that glass is glass
It's like my heart teardown.
5:13 Dude that is not the bixby botton?????? if you disable it your phone won't wake up
4:19 hahahahahah
Nlw only they put the heat sink ??
WOW that is a lot of work to replace the battery. I hope it maintains a charge for the next 5 years considering how much they charge for a new phone.
95% battery capacity retention after 2 years? That's funny with wired charging and just ludicrous if using wireless charging.
Where does Samsung claim the 5% capacity loss of the battery?
??????????????
"Apple are about 2 years behind so you'll see this in 2020" Don't forget when they do add this feature that they invented it. Not to mention it's a brand new feature that justifies the phone costing 1/3 more than any other on the market.
?????, ????? ?? ??????? ????????!????? ?????????? ??!
5:12 that is the home button!! :o
Lol at 6:43 it said 9 o'clock as this is the s9
Wasn't the "Bixby" button you were talking about the power button? I'm using my s9 right now and the volume was on the other side and the Bixby button is right underneath it. I don't know, I'm probably wrong.
5:24 dont lie to us
I wanted to ask about the purpose of the hole beside the SIM card lock (the one on the top right corner), because I accidentally inserted the pin in it instead of the the SIM card slot.
These are the best apple roasts he's done
Try the lenovo tab 3 10 business. Durability Testm
Officially the best looking clear phone
love my s9+ is just amazing
So you send out old broken phones parts ?
He is roasting apple????..every 2- 3 minutes..i can't stop laughing????
Too many apple potshots
Test your phone
Love your videos and hate modern phones the sam time! Making a non removable battery just to make the phone "water resistant" & not water proof is not a justifiable reason reason for me! They should made if real water proof and add over 7kmah battery if they will make in non removable.
plese give me this phone 8093345873
Now send it to me. For further tear down ??
Its just sad to see how a person saves months of money to buy phone like these they just buy couple of these just to break them.
We're still waiting for the vibration motor video!
Let's just say I dropped my phone outside in the rain for like 20 mins maybe and my phone did not get destroyed hope my water damage thing did not change??????????
No Flash diffuser is a deal breaker for me
Am i the only one that noticed that he actually showed the power button instead of the Bixby button?
Yaampun, buat gw aja
676 Apple fans :D !
baldy
/l l /_ l __l
Jerry wreck everything
I think this is not samsung s9 phone
le li 90000 ke phone ki
Wt duspin is this?
please give away
Watching on my S8+,nothing impressive except the camera and the Cpu
He still loves Nokia more than Samsung ?????
Jery can you please do a warning when you make the scratches sound on your mobiles because i get goosbumps when i hear scratch sounds
Where is the different type of phone vibrators video? I've been waiting for that video for so long now.
???? ??
"Apple's usually two years behind so we will be seeing this on an iPhone at around 2020" Lol
It's not murder its just removing Bixby's larynx.
I've had my Galaxy S7 since it came out, and I've had my Galaxy s4 since it came out. Both of the batteries work amazingly, and I have never had to replace them.
I wish it can switch to any aperture.
Samsung should start using better haptik motors like the one found in Pixel.
Watching this with my s9??????
using that razor blade to pop the camera off made me squint and feel naked not wearing protective eyeware. good video +1
BUNU bana gönderirmisin lütfen
Wait where can I get the clear backing for phones?????
Why the camera failed?
I don't know how my S9+ camera cover glass broke, but can you help to find the best product that would replace the glass cover without effecting the water resistance of cellphone...??!!
HI IM A FAN I HAVE A S9+ AND I DONT HAVE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT THE BIXBY BUTTONAFTER A FEW WEEKS
You look like a monster but you are funny ??
Good excellent
watching it on s9 is painful for me.
dbrand is a scam... it doesn't do anything to protect your device from fall damage and try taking that s*** off after a year... it's a nightmare lol...
Does anybody else cringe when he scratches the phone ??
Apples 2 years behind. XD
Two jabs at Apple in one video means you lost my subscription... it’s not necessary and you are clearly showing your bias.
Damn. Do you have to make a jab at Apple in EVERY video?
I want that phone.. Even without cameraa
The black camo skin in slippery I do not suggest buying it!
Will you give me any teardown phone ?
"bixby's little home" is on the other side, that was the power button :))))
Stupid!!!!
2020
Camo skin for your phone, work too well, you never find it again
Very honest .
when samsung saw this video how you disassembly and assembly back may be he will be tears drop ????
Is this his job or does he do something else and this because he buys pretty much every phone
I've had my s9 not even a month and the speaker is blown and bixby constantly crashes.. and of course my wife didn't get the insurance when she got it...
That fucking SSKSKSKRREAATTCHCHCHCH sound. Eugh.
I've had the S9+ for less than a week and I think my charge port is already broken. Tried multiple charges and multiple outlets, doesn't communicate with the computer. Tried to turn it off then turn it back on but it wouldn't turn back on except a blue light was on when the phone was off. Doing the volume / power button did turn it back on. I upgraded from HTC 10 so I don't have a wireless charger to test on yet. Thankfully I can take it back. Other people are having the same problem, what would cause this? The rubber tab on the otterbox does seem to put a lot of pressure on the cable plug, that's my best guess.
I'm tempted to do this just to disconnect the Bixby button??
$18 for a piece of paper with glue? No thank you xD
"I'm not suggesting murder, butt it's possible"??
The way he scratches things stresses me the fuck out... but then his soothing voice calms me down again... ;x
Give away this phone after test or salr
I watched this video on my s9+ ,my phone cringed the whole video
Gluing in the battery is just evil.
i'm one of the unlucky person who bought an s9 that have the dreaded "dead zone" problem, and samsung said they wont replace it. they can only repair it for free :-(
What about clear glass???
HI SIR IMA 9 YEAR OLD KID AND WHAT IS YOUR DAILY DRIVER MINE IS THE S9+ MIDNIGHT BLACK
And now sell as "slightly used"
Suggesting murder ????
Can someone buy me an s9 plus
Tod diya kutte ????????
Apple is TRIGGERED!!!!
Takle le pass jyada paise hai
Hey Jerry, can you do a Xiaomi Redmi 4X durability test n teardown. (Repairs included)... Much appreciated.
Am confused.. so all of the parts are attached to the screen? Iphone are attached to the back glass. If I remember correctly, in your most durable phone of 2017 or whatever you said that iphone are the least repairable but in my opinion. People most breaks the front glass not the black glass but whatever what am saying is that am confused to how replacing the s9 screen differ from replacing the iphone back glass?
nice
Teardown Galaxy S9+... I see you all videos alltime.
Someone buy me an S9... I'll suck yo dick!
Lets see how long it takes Samsung to copy FaceID
Roasted apple lmao
He makes the teardowns look so easy
i remember the nokia n82 and i think n8 have something like that in the camera.. i hope you explain the different if there is a different
stil waiting for that ''vibration motors'' video Zack
I think it is 1.7 not 1.5
nice video bro...
Every flagship teardown hurts my poor heart.
Jerry You amazing man. So interesting to these phones getting tear down. I can go and on watching them.
Why does The s9 only have 3000mAh but The s7 edge 3600?
Who is watching this in an s9 or s9+ device ?
what are magnets
Wow, I am amazed! I’m subscribing to this channel
Dude variable apature was in my Nokia n8 back 2011??????
Wow is that a Nintendo Switch colored dbrand skin at the end? Damn that's sexy.
Beast!
Can you change s8 camera to s9 camera
Could you please send me one of your s8 or s9 for me for exploring the internals I don't have enough money to buy one I am a electronic enthusiastic person if you send me it will be a great gift for me
Amazing!!!
Awesome.
I love that lego engineering, smartphones are so impressive to look at.
Can you teel me please the double sided tape where can i find or if you you have a link to share... Please. And how many mm must be the tape? Thanks....??
Can you do teardown for xiaomi blackshark.. I was kind wondering what was behind the back cover..pleasee??
Watching it on my s8 plus...!!
when ull do of nokia 8 sirroco
still cant get enough of the teardown with the variable aperture on the lens :"(
Thumbs up for Samsung
I'd like to see Samsung be as dedicated to Android updates as Google is with the Pixel phones. Technically it's Google's fault for handing copies of the keys to too many phone makers and not regulating them.
great video, king of random brought me here thanks Nate
fuck. technology is amazing.
I wanna see you do a tear down of a robot.
Tear down king.. awesome:)...loved it... still hurts to see the beautiful phone being ripped...
Some one pls tell me how can i know that the phone is repaired or not planning to buy somewhere cheap.
"Apple's is usually 2 years behind you prolly see this on 2020" ??????
Enough!!!! Stop with the D-Brand shit. D-Brand SUCKS!!
Just wondering, does anyone know the manufacturer or part no's for the little lego connectors he he mentions? They look incredible!
best youtubers ever, thanks
Best Teardown video till now....AWESOME
I am like what the hell man I saw you tear down a iPhone x with tears( only for the phone) and now this one... So you got so much money huh.... Donate to someone who deserve but they didn't get.... Spend it on someone's education dude
the selfie camera looks like a mini go pro!
now your phone blind
Bro you mollested the poor s9
This was hard to watch!!!
Whats that lense next to the front facing camera?
APPLE IS 3 YEARS AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION!! STOP PROVIDING WRONG INFORMATION DUMB????
Hi sir you are a genius in dismantling the phone????
@jerryRigEverything Dear Jerry!! Since i am no mechanic, just like your tearing down and ripping cells phones. "Bro" Your voice is very soothing i fall asleep while listening to you last night. why don't you starts singing lullaby not kidding LOL just kidding :D
Put the camera back in place without lenses and you will see magic already did it with S7esge and S8.
But a diffuser makes the light less powerful
Hey Jerry can you do a tear down video of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo please
The microSD slot can actually take 2tb.. All microSD slots on high end phones take this much since the LG G3.. But still no 2tb card though??
?????????????????? ????
funny how u base all the tech around iphone comparison, can u imagine apple doing that? oh apple has no need as samsung is just another android with half an iphone processor
the phone is a8
DUDE wear a Gloves. It will look professional
is 95% battery retention after 2 years also for Note 8 or just s9/+ ?
Your a dick, always bagging on Apple!!
You are a doctor for these phones man ! ... nice surgery doc !
Samsung also claimed that Note´s battery won´t explode you know?
Your head looks like a white chocolate cadburys creme egg
Please give me a s9
Can you put ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 and Redmi note 5 pro under test.
Samsung por fuera y por dentro es feo !!! Su tarjeta más fea
MURDER BIXBY!
make video on xiomi blackshark teardown video
Can we please agree to not say those cable unclip like little Lego? Lego is inseparable lol
"Vibrator explanation video"....yes please
I have a serious question. If you replaced the camera in a phone with a higher quality one (say replace an 8mp camera with a 12mp) would the phone take higher quality photos, or would they still be the same default quality?
Hi there! I wated to take the sim card out and accidentally placed the needle in the upper microphone, not the one near the mouth. I didn't press it too hard. Is there any chanses to brake somethin there? The phone is a samsung galaxy s9+. Thanks!
Really, nobody going to mention "vibrator explanation video"?
...If it had the same selfie cam as last year (and I saw that video), then why didn't Samsung go and enable the OIS? Strange... That means to date, the HTC 10 (which I have and will probably keep until it finally dies) is still the only phone in existence with this particular feature, which is very helpful with selfie videos...Not even its successor, the U11 has it... Getting back to the Samsung, maybe selfie OIS will be something that will appear on the upcoming Note 9, or next year's "10" iterations of the S or N-Series devices... Even HTC is considering bringing that feature back for the U12... Here's hoping, anyway...
No wonder Samsung used such a small battery. They have the mother board spread out all over the place. I saw that Huawei concentrated most of them it the upper part of the phone so they can use a much bigger battery like the Mate 10 Pro.
Apple ist usually 2 years behind????????... Nice video????
Jerry rig ....your voice is mind blowing really superb
Jerry you worth it ????
Do the s9 plus +
Pls give me s9 plus plz
Hey jerry do you know which adhesive tape is best for water resistant or know the name of the special adhesive tape
I hate Bixby and I hate that you can't deactivate it or that you can decide which app to put on there
It is difficult to repair. The same is mate 10 pro. It is a real problem if the display is proken. Nevertheless I love Samsung
Would you make a video about Samsung A8 2018. I would like to buy one but Im not quite sure.
Do huawei p20 durability test please!
What about NOKIA 2018 New Flagships..
Hello @JerryRigEverything Great video ! I was wondering if it would be possible to use the camera outside of the phone with a long cord of sorts. What cord type would be needed to connect the camera to the motherboard if so? I have a severe physical disability but love doing photography. I did some decent work on an S3, but my body keeps getting weaker and phones keep getting heavier. I'm trying to think up small lightweight alternatives, and an S9+ cam on a stick seems like the best option on the market that I can find if it'd work still. Thanks!
Yeah, 2 years from now, we'll see Apple claim variable aperture is innovation by them.
Apple 2020: Now We are removing The Screen! Because that shit is so old school!!!!
waiiting xperia xz2
S8 or S9?
Did you check the front camera to see if it is using OIS ?
How much bigger is the S9 earpiece speaker than the S8?
Eh man why you had to scratch the surface. Gave me goosebumps.
Apple be like. O YES I LIKE THIS GUY, GIVE ME THE TECHNOLOGY.
Lets fire some really hot heat waves at the battery What a great idea
Cool camera
This man murder phones instead of giving it to me. ??..i will raise this issue in united nation phones rights commision.
I want that camouflage cover give the link
Very informative
Where can I bay display for S9?
try p20 lite
You Should definitely do a Moto X4 teardown/tests. Would love to see it.
Instead of tear down , you can also gift it to me ????
Apple will implement variable apertures in 2020??
Is that Galaxy S9 plus for your usage?? I mean why didn't you teardown that??
"Probably because it just doesn't exist anymore" ????
I dropped my s9 from about 3 feet, it had the sylicon case that came with it... could the fall have made any damage to the internals, or the camera?
Thank you @JerryRigEverything for the teardown! Always doing great work. Just a thought, is it possible you were looking at the power instead of the bixby button? Looks like bixby and volume keys are all in one flex cable. Sorry if I am wrong.
You deserve more subscribers so I cloned the button so that’s why you have 1mil subscribers TrUe StOrY........ maybe
I like your videos. Mr Jerry nicely done
Can u make a video about xperia xz2 pls?
Xperia xz2 bend test please i bought it feels realy solid heavy!
JerryRigEverything - What's directly perpendicular to the microphone holes? Looks like the waterproofing and mic are parallel to the holes... Curious because I accidentally stuck the sim tool down the top mic hole (great design, Samsung), it went straight thru til it hit what feels like the chassis.
In another words when phone start to give you problems get rid of it because every year gets harder and harder to fix them yourself..........
I can't wait until someone releases a phone with a fully variable aperture, from f/1.5 to say f/16 with every half or quarter stop in between. Ooh... maybe a physical shutter too! Once one phone has both of those, they will all follow that trend.
"my little buddy jack" haha. That jack is my buddy too. I'm surprised how small it is inside of the phone..... "cough"
Any link for that "double sided tape?"
Please honor 9 lite k as karo sir
Get a pop filter.
??? ????? ????? ????? ????
good
“I’m not suggesting murder here, I’m just saying it can be done”
please water resistance tast review Huawel colour brand a2
I like these videos. There's loads of new phones out that need scratching, burning and bending. But. The Bixby button shown in this video is actually the power button. Ask Alex R, apparently he ripped his out according to this video. Hahahahahaha.
Did u just break ur new s9 and dont feel like using the free samsung warenty then pay alot to break a phone
You are very skilled....great upload...Thank You
Samsung is whooping apple's ass in the technology department, and the mobility department
Exactly... apple is a behind

Love Samsung on how they add new features without having excuses to get rid of older tech like a 3.5mm jack and microSD expansions. Heavily considering a S9 to replace my aging S5 now...
This guy hates Apple
Thanks for shoving us how to murder bixby.
Hello buddy @jerryrigeverything I wanted a help that u should do a video regarding the scratch test and durability of tempered glass for flagship androids...would love. To see a future video ????
Could we just have an informative video without trashing another company, as both Samsung and Apple have their pros and cons? I mean I love my videos non biased, it’s just a tad annoying to hear iPhone this all the time. Yeah we know and yeah we get it, Apple sucks according to you...
You should go to Samsung and say "id like to upgrade my s9 to s9+ because my s9 doesnt come with a camera."
o.o !! Inside the rear camera of S9
I want this guy to yell once and a while. He’s secretly the chocolate guy from spongebob

I was waiting to know how that variable aperture works. Thanks a lot.
I hate how this idiot knows nothing about Apple and juts mindlessly bashes them non stop for the dumbest reasons. 2 years behind? Apple was first to add 4K video recording at 60fps and dual OIS and still have better video stabilizing and color accuracy. Such a stupid angry Apple hater for no reason and who doesn’t know what he’s saying
Sir Jerry can you text VIVO APEX WORLDS 1$t perfect vessels phone of 2018................

Huge Respect for Jerry.
I love to see a video about vibration motor in phones. ??
Loving your passive aggressiveness towards Apple.
R U RICH?!?!?!?!?!?!?! HOW CAN U AFFORD ALL THESE PHONES AND JUST PUT THEM TO TORTURE?!? U KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY UR SPENDING!!!
You r blocking all mobiles and here i don't even have my own phone so i request you to give one phone plz plz plz plz
So dumb question, I accidentally put in the sim ejector tool in the microphone on the bottom near the charging port. I tested it out and it still works but did that compromise the water proofing on my phone? From your video, it doesnt look like poking the sim ejector will do anything to the bottom mic but I could be wrong
Dear jerry please help me fix my iPhone 7 my power adapter exploded and now my phone doesn’t charge
whats with the constant apple sarcasm? we get it baldie, you dont like apple, but no need to wave it in our face every goddamn time
Wow
Thanks for showing this. I've asked in several forums about how the aperture mechanism must work but no one had a clue until now! Cheers :)
Can you install 6GB RAM on Galaxy S9???
If the flash is the size of an LED, it doesn't really matter for how your photo wil look, since it's the size of the lght source, and not the diffusion that makes light soft on a photo. Sure it will give you a tiny difference, but not something so big that I'd say it'd be worth to market toe phone for.
You need bring it back to Samsung warranty centre ??
JerryRoastsEverythingAboutApple
I’m just here to hear “like a little LEGO”.
lol the sarcasm towards apple is hilarious
Your videos can be entertaining but the random jabs at Apple are completely unnecessary and just get annoying.
What cloth are you using to clean your screens?
Just why did you scratch that inner metal after prying out the battery?!
Amazing engineering!
Hahahaha @JerryrigEverything i love the little apple remarks your starting to throw in your Teardowns they are quite enjoyable keep up the good work mate !!
Dbrand is all hype, once anyone owns it they know it’s trash as hell. Removed mine within one month

Camera tear down...it's more cool than a phone tear down.
You never spoke about BP measuring in S9, or is it only for s9+?
Awesome video

Hurts to watch
SD slot isn't even worth mentioning, it's shit it slows your phone down.
I really appreciated the "being fair" part. It was way overdue. ????
Hahaha, You hate/don't like Apple more than I do. And, Indeed you're best YouTuber/ Person :)
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind, so you'll see this in an iPhone around 2020" Zack, I watch your videos just for the Apple comments. ??

diagnosis natural these pile lead never like and/or approve fresh random operating
?????? ?????? ??????
Hey Jerry, if YouTube didn’t pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars, would you still do these videos?
good work
Do a "tear-down" for a calculator for April 1st
You should test the Alcatel a30 fierce
Dont know about that 95% tho, switched my battery a week ago after 10 months or so of use because it was way worse
But...will it be your daily driver?
Do a Tmobil REVVL
Hey @JerryRigEverything Would it be possible to maybe take he camera from the 8 and put in 9. And the other way around, i know you can download the cam app for s9 online. It would be pretty cool if you could mod it like that XD
You should grow beard. You will look like Cratos from The God of War-4 Tall, muscular, rough you are a perfect real life character for that
Can you make a teardown of a Xiaomi Mi A1?
What is Emergency mode?
S9 HUINYA!!!
Bixby ???
the inside isnt very innovative like the iphone x
Dope looking but bank breaking skin. Seriously, Dbrand are too expensive
Still plastic SIM tray... no, thanks.
Instead of ripping off the contacts from the Bixby button, you could just put kapton tape over them.
I love the smell of Roasted Apple in the morning.
Webtekno
nice video
dband: hey zack, i want to sponsor your video. zack: but i prefer clear back of my phone dband: just choose one, you got 2 phone zack: okay, i choose the expensive one for skin, because i want to tear the camera off of my phone for clear back one. dband: deal
so finally somethin sensible is available o youtube...
Zack at it again with the apple roasts!
$900 is my 7 month salary... I will die before buy this phone
RIP S9
thumbs up????????
355
Honestly the quality of those PCB’s look barely better than what’s in a $2 calculator. Apple does the inside of their products so much better and also Apple is 2years ahead when it comes to facial scanning. Not two years behind. Jerry you are being to harsh on Apple just because they got rid of the headphone jack. That’s unfair and it would be nice if you equally shared shame across more phones instead of targeting Apple exclusively just because your not a fan. As a reviewer you are not suppose to express your bias so boldly. You can mention it but stop rubbing it in. It makes it hard to enjoy your videos
Apple doesn’t fall 2 years behind every year. They do come out with things after other companies but only if it’s worth it. Most tests show that the variable aperture is barely noticeable.
Oldsongshindi o
i wish you can give that phone to me
I think Zac you are talking about the power button, not the Bixby one
and the point is?
use this phone in the future for slomo, you now use 240fps. the s9 has 960fps
Always taking a dig at Apple.
Nice video
To much hate on Apple. Might as well get rid of this channel.
Can you tell me where is the parts in the phone that make phone vibrate??
I don't get why did u say that IP68 is not the same as waterproof if IP68 is dust/WATERPROOF over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes... is it just because of this 1.5m and 30 min?
Lol Apple introduced the telephoto lens way before Samsung.
It'd have been cool if you'd detached the bixby connector and made a non bixby triggering bixby button.. ??
Great video and thank you very much for showing us those amazing new technology??
u are a certified jerk.. sorry just couldn't help.
Thumbs up for sony not for Samsung because its use a sony camera
The video name is wrong -How To Remove The Bixby Button From Galaxy S9 2018
Please make a video on Sony experia xa 1
I want to see a phone with the camera UNDERNEATH the backpanel!
Why you gotta hate on apple any chance you get? Annoying af. I have an android but common iPhones are good
"Apple is about 2years behind so u will see this in 2020"
Who hurt you, man?
This is the first time i’ve heard him complimenting Apple.
Gary please do a video on how you can remove U.V filters on some old smartphones to make a night vision camera??
Why not leave one camera with a bigger aperture than the other instead of putting a mechanism that opens and closes?
Apple Inc will have variable aperture camera in 2020 ????love for anti apple fanboy ??
(y)
where do you put your phone after surgering it?
'Apple is usually two years behind, so you will see it in apple around 2020', It was sarcastic indeed ??????
rip s9
Loved the idea to disable Bixby!! :D
The back camera's aperture blades aside, the inner parts of this phone are better put together than those of any phone I have seen in your teardowns.
I'm kind of done watching your videos. This is a Samsung video and you still manage to find ways to shit on Apple.
Shifdelenetden gelenler
Yes ! Kill Bixby, Zack Bixby is nothing and you are brilliant
U R the best
hahah 2 years behind apple..
Was waiting on this one Jerry good teardown as always.
Such a "NORMAL" voice
Variable aperture isn't actually a new thing in a phone. Nokia N86 from 2009 already has it ;)
Webtekno'dan gelenler
Dude! Love your videos. Could you do a durability and tear down of the Oppo latest flagship? Kind regards, Sian.
Watching this video really makes my tears down????
Owo very nice thanks
jerry you rig camera
gj jerry you are one of the best
Hi Jerry, I have a request. Can you do a test on "AGM X2" phone? It's the most toughest phone in late 2017 and I'm thinking of buying it due to the durability and other pros. Thanks in advance if you read my comment.
OIS can hardly help with video smoothness, it's way too tiny to compensate for any type of hand shaking, let alone when walking. But it's incredibly helpful in low light. Also I must say I'm amazed by marketing. Camera modules are so cheap, that you can install the S9 module into their cheapest model, and buyers won't really feel the difference in price, while having top notch camera. But then a lot less people would by S9 if they can get same camera experience in cheap phones, and so cheap phones get shittier cameras just because of that .
The best YouTuber ever. ??
Drop TEST!
I'm not suggesting a murder??????
as always quality stuff
This tred down is a8
“I’m not suggesting murder, I just say it’s possible” - Hitman 2018
If apple is 2 years behind then what the hell is face id. The glass back, fingerprint sensor and the s9 whole camera is UI is a rip off of apples except its up.
stupid guy doing stupid everthing . wtf. what a waste of a premium phone
Call burning increasingly typical reluctant reputation resolve chemical
Good teardown... To bad the variable aperture is a gimick, low light shots aint better than the S8, some are even better on the S8
variable aperture already was done on nokia phones years ago
Did you guys notice that Zack was showing the power button and not the Bixby button? ??
can you tell why screen flicker
Its a shame you drive a big ass Toyota truck and still manage to make those whimpy little apple jibes. Aww kid.
Your selective points you make comparing Apple to Samsung are unintelligent. Everybody knows Galaxy's do not last as long and as well compared to iPhones.
The internals look cheap. I’m concerned.
Do OPPO R11S PLUS
Apple is two years behind..LOL..good one they are!!
Dude your mocking apple jokes are getting boring.
Srsly mate ? We’ll see it in iPhones in 2020 ? The iPhone doesnt need one, it’s useless and it’s bullshit. I’m a photographer, that aperture that’s in FRONT of the lens is useless and has minimal efect of the photos it takes. Take a look at supersaf’s test between the s9 and the X. It’s obvious the s9 camera is a joke.
The Rubber Balls have escaped xD
Try making a transparent Nokia 3310
Good video sir
You sick man
damn that phone is ripped
literally hurts ??
I enjoy your commentary and the cheap shots. I tend to stray away from Samsung since the galaxy 3 or so. The bloatware is what did it and I feel Samsung has become the apple of android.
7:8 thats why i subscribed him.
You'll see this in an iphone in 2020 lmao. But it will be revolutionary when they do it!
There Are Several Type Of Vibrators...??????BTW You Are The King Of Technology...
Hey Jerry, try durability test for bigger devices like iPads, MacBook and Mac Computers. I is more interesting. I have tried it.
S9??
As always, great video. But can you please make a video to explain why all the shade thrown Apple’s way? Sometimes it’s ok, but others it’s just off putting.
Were you fired from apple at some time?
The video I was waiting for
A 7 minute apple diss
Oh that sweet sweet Apple shade xD
Hi, can you show us an example in the next video of how you keep all your screws etc organised? :)
could you review some liquid glass screen protectors PLEASEEEEE :)
Carai borracha
Like
great review !!! bravo
Zack do durability test on Xiaomi Mi Note 3 i wander if he will hold since of that big glass back. Maybe will be new Mi 5 chocolate bar.
Damn, Jerry be cookin' on Apple!
That monotonous apple dissing is just pure gold man
Note 8 don't have cooling sistem?
Do blackberry leap
Jerry you should Do a giveaway on the Samasung Galaxy S9
When you will do a test for s9 plus???And a teardown
I just got my s8+ today im really loving it
R.I.P galaxy s9??
Test Xperia XZ2
"we'll see the same technology on apple in 2020" hhahahahaha
Xz2 durability test pls
The subtle humour in your videos is the best.
Huawei mate 10 pro
do you get sponsored or are you just rich?
Love your comments on Apple...
Rip Stephen Hawking...
Well, maybe you should teardown something other than smartphone, i.e PS4 Pro would be nice.
Was this recorded before you made the back clear
nice video
2020
Awesome Video Zack
Watching this on my s9plus ??
When is S9 + Test and Teardown coming...??? Waiting for it Eagerly...
??????
' I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible'
Am I poor? I cracked my old Note5 back and I cried.
Now these are one of the few videos for which i come to YouTube. Keep it up man!! Inspired by you i repaired my old Nokia feature phones last month. But as you know, they weren't seriously damaged. They were just tired of being omnipotent for so long ??
Like a little lego
Xz2 vs s9+ speed test
2020 ??
Love that he always refers to Apple being behind lol
Can you do a face reveal at 2 million subs?
the new S9's camera module should fit on the S8, so the S8 user can possible to use variable aperture??
What amazing detail, thanks !
"iPhone's usually two years behind, so you'll see this in an iPhone in 2020" Savageness level: 9999 :D
I mostly watch your videos just for your comments. Love you man ?????
Have you heard about DBRAND?
You are the best buddy
I'll keep saying this, that this is the best teardown channel ever!!
You r really hard working Dedication level too high ??

??????????
Please add subtitle for Indonesia thanks you i subscribe you i'm from Indonesia????
Everything looks good with the S9,but is that simcard tray still made of plastic? It's not a big deal but when cheaper phones are using metal sim card tray I thought maybe a much more expensive phone should be too.
us kid administration towards involve chemical ranch gravity point divide.
A great phone for me is the phone with no limitation. I can connect into pc and my phone show just like flash drive device, i can charge it with almost any charging adaptor, i can use any headphone types and I don't scared to showing up my phone on any place/street. That's is a great phone for me.
Please stop scratching metal part with knife, the sound its very very disturbing
Please stop scratching metal part with knife, the sound its very very disturbing
Ur best
Hey Jerry amazing video man totally something I would not do myself but could you do the s9+ too if you want of course lol. I am getting mine on Friday during the release and just wanna know how it looks inside also. Keep up the good work man I love watching these tear down vids. :D
Give me one!!! Jk I wish!!!!
Love the vids, buuut i believe the part referring to Bixby was actually the power key. Keep up w/the great content!
Glass is glass and luckily replacement panels are pretty cheap if you accidentally break one :P
Noikia,N82(2007) ,N8,N808,1020 has a ND filter that closes the camera lens and opens when more light is required. Which was an awesome feature. Its good to see some companies are doing real hardware or optical innovations in the camera!!
Samsung late with the diffuser ?? i noticed my LG G2 has it.
you are saying this different aperture is new in Samsung while Sony did it first and also saying it will take 2 years for Apple to do it. one thing about this is Apple camera still produce the better image than s9+.
Is it just me or anyone noticed the button he said Bixby button is actually the power button???????
You can remove Bixby button pads....... I prefer to disable the button in the settings :)
I'm curious about the processor, which one is the Snapdragon processor in the motherboard section, can somebody point out for me
Lol u showed the power button as the bixby button...!!
Zack for Prez 2018
Waiting for Nokia 7plus??
Hey Jerry ..this is one mother of a video. It explains and confirms so much Thank you. Just asking, can I show this during a training program? Thanks.
I got a ad of S9
im not suggesting murder, had me dead
Halo Mr Tukang Otak-atik
why this is not in hd
why this is not in hd
Plz rig oppo F5
Please test HTC U11 PLUS
As a tech lover It's hard to watch Man..It's hurts??
Yes!!!
Can you do the Motorola E4 durability test
Looks like you are not a fan of Apple. Yeah I agree. They’re a bit slow. XD Love your videos, your professionalism and your pleasure to just scratch. XDDDD it always makes me xDDDDD. More like. XDDDD. Idk how to explain this
Excellent video ????????
hahahha apple is 2 years behind haha funny ??
You should do a video where you say all the facts that make Android flagships different from the Apple iPhones. I feel like people buy iPhones because they just think well it's Apple and it's more expensive so it must be better. However after talking for a good ten minutes with someone who has an iPhone and explaining the facts about the hardware in their phone compared to let's a galaxy they quickly realize they've been scammed.
IPhone 2020????
Do oppo f5 it have really good camera
Sir check the duribilty of nokia 8 Sirocco
still wating for the tear down of the zte dul screem phone, just intersting of the inside of that phone
Wow.... you are best in this...
i love the savage on apple lmao
i wouldnt consider the dual apeture a major deal maker for people to buy it, but maybe the new processor...nvm this is just samsungs version of an iphone 8
The main challenge is to assemble it again.
Brasil SP
Can you show a disassemble of a Huawei ascend xt2 ? I have a broken screen, I need to know how to open the phone properly. I watched a video before, the steps weren't clear enough.
Stop destroying Smartphones
If I get an S9 I may buy a dbrand skin
“And if i’ve earned it hit that subscribe button” now THAT is how you do it man!
I hate samsung! Oh, and i hate apple too btw!
Wow u done it so easily... :-)
I don't even care about this phone, I just enjoy listening to him talk about it ?????
when hardware is explained by a youtuber way better than the actual manufacturer!
Nice to know that we gon see this tech in iphone on 2020
I remember my old phones have the same mechanism. Phones with xenon flash on it. sony ericsson: k800i, w800i and my nokia n82. They have this mechanical iris. If you have one of those, i think you should check that out.
i will buy that clear back than a fuckin dbrand skin!
Samsung > Apple Is there any argument anymore?
Samsung ma be ahead but the iPhone 8 and X still have a better processor. And they still look better but that is not a reason to buy a phone
Your back voice for the video was so catchy man why cant you try in different modulation
Just cover the contacts with electrical tape. Why damage it when you can do a reversible fix?
What is that wallpaper?
So can you show us the pretty sweet camo skin from dbrand
love the popping sound of lego, make it louder please
Speaking of glass backed phones, can you do the Moto X4??
Thumbs up for vibration explanation.
"Apple is about 2years behind so u will see this in 2020"- JerryRigEverything ?? ??
Jerryrigeverything more likely androidboy101 lol
I am just here for the Apple troll bits :P
Tech King called Jerryrigeverything
This is one thing I was wondering about phone cameras. Can you upgrade them? Especially since they come out. I hate the camera in my phone. So that's why.
I came here for the apple roasts. I'm satisfied yet once again. ??
I have a Samsung because of my boy jack
Please do a teradown of lenovo zuk z1
Wow, I'm actually impressed with thing. I'm not often am, but this one, I would consider buying. Do you have any idea if I can easily or somewhat easily flash LineageOS on this thing eventually?
i can't see the s9+ what have you done to it zach
I've seen a ton of your vids, this one with the camera tear down is by far the best.
bro u jst ruined e s9 phone...
Does the phone has FM built in?
iphone x is 10000 time better, poor samsung s8 = s9
I finally get to be that douche who says "watching on my Galaxy S9."
Hey Zack, you always deserve a subscriber when you make videos
Original good tech content w/ humor ????????????
This phone would be perfect if the Bixby button was program go to any functioning wide and you can choose your virtual assistant
When are you going to give us an update on your new truck?
In my opinion, your teardown videos are the most interesting. Please never stop making them
"95 % capacity over 2 years" Absolute bullcrap, according to acubattery my note 8 battery capacity is at 3000.......
I'm not saying murder but it's possible
Dbrand if you read this, you should make a copy of interior of a phone and use it as back skin, it will look cool
I didn't even notice the camera was gone in the clear s9 video
But how does the diffuser work!?
nice
First Samsung Galaxy I am interested in, very nice
Entertaining and informative as usual.
I always listen for those word "little Lego".
You know Zack, your S9+ stayed untouched for 3 videos so far. I have a strong feeling you're considering it to be your new daily driver.
I buyed a iPhone 8 i love my phone ??
I love that he hates apple lmao
Isso é incrível, fazer isso e voltar a funcionar
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible." - Zack, 2018
Pretty well built phone
Just waiting for the fire...
Murder the BIXBY!
"I'm not suggesting murder," Just permanently crippling Bixby. And that's O.K.!
Jerry is the s9 camera fit to note 8 ??
Wow Samsung is known for copying Apple and this liberal says the opposite
Like a little LEGO
You savage!! ????????
I just have liked and subscribed your channel for murdering phone. :p
Apple's always ahead in the weirdest ways compared to Samsung. Samsung is ahead in great ways like reducing bezels, beautiful screens, and cool camera technology, but Apple is ahead of the others when it comes to removing head phone jacks, adding notches, and popularizing a second camera. It always feels like both companies are just doing their own thing, but inevitably most every other Android manufacturer just ends up copying what Apple's doing, for better (two camera systems) or worse (headphone jack and that fucking notch). And this opinion comes from a content iPhone 7 user with no plans to change over.
Roasted!!!??????
Still waiting for the Tesla teardown
How you live torturing phones
How can the Samsung battery be so small in form factor but be so huge
I want you guys to decide, should I move to Samsung or stay at Apple
This channel is the only reason why Google built in that notification icon into YouTube!
So um, yeah. Love your videos, but that "Bixby button" that you pointed out was definitely the power button. It's an honest mistake considering the phone is flipped over..
Apple will put this camera in their phones and call it their own revolutionary idea.
Love d Apple roasts nd d quality of ur vids..
Jerry i"ve watched your videos from a year or so and i thouth of this from a long time what if you replace the back camera with the front what will happen like if you think you should do a video
Wish i could afford a S9 but i dont like payment plans and ¥95,839 is about as much as one month of rent but it is a very nice phone, glad they finally added a hardware solution for the rear camera.
I love how he just casually flames Apple throughout the video
Is it possible to mechanically damage that apperture mechanism? I mean, if you hit the phone, or it falls to the ground... And also, would it be possible for this hardware to change the apperture anywhere between 1.5 and 2.4?
MY S9+ IS COMING SATURDAY OR MONDAY Cant ship sunday
Xperia XZ2 Teardown
GALAXY J5V PRIME please
Those Apple are cold hard facts and they're golden.
About 300 Apple fanboys triggered ??
You should change your channel name to apple roaster everything!
damn, you hate apple hahaha
Sorry Bixby button is on the right side if from bottom,
bravo majstore
Aperture remember me about Portal
Love from India Many thing learn from u I love u.
Goddamn Zach, you know how i love your Apple burns. What's that ? Oh ... You don't ... Well, now you do! Keep the heat high my friend!
Why don't you just buy official waterproof seals instead of using double sided tape so you can retain the water resistance and keep the clear look
Test the Samsung galaxy j7 sky pro
As always Jerry... your teardown vids are amazing get to learn a lot.
"I'm not suggesting murder" after you explain how to kill Bixby. Ha ha ha this is why I love your channel.
weirdly satisfaying at looking the jack audio spinning when it's pop up ??
Love that jab at Apple :D
Should i buy a Samsung galaxy s9 or a Razer phone?
Are we going to P E N E T R A T E ( ?° ?? ?°) it again?
Very fascinating video. The Samsung Galaxy S9 duo is looking to be pretty promising: no stupid notches, they have headphone jack, card slots, and cameras with variable apertures. Now if only they had removable batteries and a 16:9 ratio.??
you wanna give me that phone now
Hey jerry rig everything i love your videos man but why don’t you pick on another smart phone company that just apple. Btw sometimes your jokes about i have to admit they are a little funny? ??
Hey Jerry you scratched your camera lens on the phone of course
Apple will "invent" that camera 2 years from now
do you realise you were saying to the people to remove the power button??? bixby is on the other side...
All of the roasts that you have been handing out to apple makes me ashamed of owning a 6..
You've earned it!
Well done. Now let's wait for the S10
@jerryrigeverything what about attempting to retrofit the so camera module in an s8
Ha phrasing ????
I swear Dbrand is just sponsoring everybody
Bixby finally survived. ??
Very experienced man.
always fun to watch. :D
You are one ruthless sob.
Man I love it how honest you are about Apple! Roasting da heck outta dem unlike most of the other youtubers who are afraid of losing their iSheeps audience!
your video so cool I subscribed for you friend
The Apple bashing is real in this one oof
What up rating is complete waterproof
well, is there any improvement on the speaker this time around ?
nice video
galaxy s9 so so coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool bro????????
Apple will invent it
Jerryrape everything
i like that the PCB is just a general PCB colour, not black etc.
Hahahahaha. The statement was awesome for bixby . I m not suggesting murder, i m just saying it's possible
Dang what's your beef with Apple.
you pointed to the power button, then called it a bixby button
what i don't understand is how apple is revolutionary when its always 2 years behind.
I understand that apple overprices their devices and their latest have not been so innovative but the iPhone 5s had Touch ID before Samsung and when Samsung got it the next year on the S5, you had to slide down. The iPhone 7 Plus had dual cameras before the Samsung phones and a year later, Samsung put it in their phones on the note 8. So i kinda get annoyed when you make it seem like they have no impact in the smartphone world. But I stilled enjoyed the video nevertheless!
I love your content, but after tens of apple burns in every single video, kind of getting tired of it. I get it, you hate apple but its kind of extreme and overused at this point. Apple is not the only one excluding features or waiting some time for them to get better, its not like samsung doesnt make mistakes, I dont hear you joke about their exploding note 7's everytime looking at a battery. Just something I noticed, have a nice day tho :)
Shit Pry tool isn't the same as IFIXITS
what happens if xou open the camera app without having a camera in the phone?
Awesome phone
Nooooo why did u broke the s9 :'( ??
$1000+ iPhone X < $720 Samsung S9
Noooooooooooooooo don't murder Bixby. He's my buddy.
In 2020 There will be no camera on the iPhone ????
You know what I love about your Apple burns? That unlike iSheep who have to stretch reality to make Samsung look bad, you're actually just throwing out pure facts out there. The fact those are actually so stupidly ridiculous is what makes the burn so effective. Kinda makes you think about where you put your money, huh?
You are the best??????
IT IS THE EXACT SAME... Its like an S8s
many bombs thrown at Apple's a-hole
No one's gonna point out the hilarious apple roast? ??
I wish he would stop throwing shade at Apple I used to enjoy this channel but he just won't shut up and review the phone in front of him instead he points out every feature that a phone has that apple doesn't
Waiting for the homepod teardown jerry??
Love how you dirty talk with your phone ????
Hey Jerry, I think that was actually the power button you mentioned in the video. Haha It was face down which flipped the buttons too.
LEEEGO :)
Lol Camera failure msg ????
agent 47!!
I listen to your videos while sleeping. Your voice is so soothing
Can't wait to see Apple inventing that variable aperture camera in upcoming models
your videos are so good!
Try buffing scratches off an iPhone X please !!!
No I don't have enough I'm just a teen
ok come on, stop hitting on Apple so much with the whole battery deal, its annoying. Every video I watch of yours consists of almost one negative comment on Apple...not all they do is bad, and you seem to portray them as a horrible company.....not cool.
still didnt check if the charger port has the same issue that many of the s8's and s8+'s had.
Apples batteries are larger but have less capacity Samsung batteries are much smaller and yet are larger Coincidence?
Now that is something of a manly review of the phone..!!! Learnt something new.
LG gets criticized for making a v30 with new A.I and a few hardware upgrades but samsumg gets praised for making a whole new flagship that only has a better camera than the s8? Makes sense
Apple maybe 2 years behind but when they do it they will always out perform samsung... even look at the shitty retarded animoji's samsung released. I dont own a iphone and currently have a S7 so dont come back at me saying i am a apple fanboy.
I need a phone sooo frinking bad
Low-key bashing on Apple ??????
Only Dbrand skin worth buying are the matte color ones
I like seeing the inside of phones
It's not murder, it's amputation.
Only dumb turds buy Dbrand skins for that overpriced garbage... these skins are like 2 bucks on ebay or aliexpress.
Man, I love this dude’s smooth apple roasts
Finally, what I have been missing on youtube
do a video on how to murder the Bixby button!!!
What would happen if you put the S8 camera in S9 ?
I am not saying to murder the bixby button but it is possible
now if we can only modify that sim tray to hold 2 sims and a sd card simultaneously
I love the Apple shade. ??????
$5 on Apple advertising their future revolutionary camera as their "2020 vision"
Zach to the rescue!!!
Damn I'd like to get S8 or S9, too bad they are using shitty OLED displays...
the 95% battery is so underrated! this is important. all my phones get crappy after so little time! Wish my laptop used that kind of battery too :(
didnt see second speaker... lol was it there? cant find
This variable aperture is a joke, with that sensor size lol "innovative"
Beautiful inside as it's beautiful outside.?? Apple is always behind the innovative Samsung.
You have earned it already ..??????
Is there anything u didnt rig yet? Lol
I really like your videos zack, but i think you’re taking the apple criticism too far!
his voice is so relaxing lol
that wasnt the bixbi button actually that was the power button
This is what makes samsung way superior than apple
If you popped the camera out of the s9 could it fit in the s8? I know you wouldn't get the variable aperture but just curious
"rip off the contact pads, so he never works again. I'm not suggesting murder, just saying it's possible". Zack, i like your honesty on things like failed buttons and premium brands running 2 years behind and claiming innovation :D
Dbrand is shipping so slow, it has been 10 days stil not shipped..
"You'll see this in an iPhone at around 2020" ??
This guy is so jelly of apple! Did they reject your job application at the Apple store or something?
No hate but i cant fcing belive how big of an android and especcially samsung fanboi this guy is
I dont know why but it doesnt feel like 60fps
Life is a diy proyeckt
Jerry is finally becoming who he's meant to be
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" - JerryRigEverything 2018 ??
are you going to do a honor 7x review at some point?? you did the 6x so now what about the new one??
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" indeed useless bixby button.
You should be paid to roast apple consistently Agent 47
His videos are so relaxing like asmr ??
I wonder if the mm change in the aperture can be done over a range rather than what I understand to be a hard `1` or a hard `0` for 1.5 and 2.4. XDA, do your thing.
Why dont you test the samsung galaxy J7 2017 its not a flagship but i want to see its power ??????
Always big thumbs up ????????
"I'm not suggesting murder." Lmao Bixby shade is heavyyyyyyyyy ??
...like a little Lego... :D
Should be able to reassign the bixby button so when pressed it take you to Jerry's YouTube page. Call it the Jerry button.
Solution to get rid of Bixby Software guy: Roots phone, remaps button Hardware guy: Rips cables out
What happends if you decided to dont put certain " important " komponents inside? Will it make the software go bad shit?
I swear the S9 Plus was the only phone with the aperture I guess wrong not the s9
We do what we must because we can
Didn't expect to laugh during a phone tear down video but that was amazing lol the salt was strong
Your iPhone bashing is getting pretty old. We get it, you don't like Apple.
Swap camera s9 to s8??
Don't worry guys, apple will most likely invent variable apertures in the next iPhone!
F you dbrand
I'm looking forward to that vibrator video.
You’re the only guy I watch for teardown videos because you actually give an in-depth review of every product only thing I have to say is I am an Apple fan however I agree with you they need to put the headphone jack back
I love how you are roasting Apple in your videos, they make me laugh a lot. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and it's a great phone. Amazing speed and great camera. You can say iPhones are expensive but if you compare the iPhone 8 Plus' price with the S9 plus, in Europe the iPhone 8 Plus in 100 euros cheaper. And the iPhone is still faster. Camera quality is debatable and since i havent had an S9 in my hands, i can't say anything.
I still like pixel 2's camera more. For me S9 is a little bit of a scam.
"You know what you sign up for" - may these roasts never disappear
oh you earned the subscribe alright. Such a clear tear down and commentary
@JerryRigEverything bro, I think you have mistaken power button for bixby button....
I watch it as a revenge to those phones I can't buy..
you just managed to make 2 videos during one teardown lol
??well see these in apple in 2020
Could you do a review of AGM x2 phone? It claims that it's build strong even a group of 6 or 7 kicking it on the floor won't do much damage. Thanks Jerry!
Is there any particular reason variable aperture has to be done with a moving shutter instead of an LCD?
Not a JRE video w/o the Apple jokes
Why are you always have to say something about Apple? Dual aperture is such a gimmick feature on a phone... watch all the experiment videos on this camera and you’ll se a microscopic change in the light. Plus with this “feature” it lets microscopic light to come to the sensor but you lose so much quality. Look it up in the videos. I don’t hate on your videos i love watching them but your jokes are kinda out of date. Its my opinion. The headphone jack one is not funny anymore because more people are actually okay with that and they don’t need it anymore. Samsung will also remove it. Right now they wait for other companies to take the hate for that. But they WILL REMOVE IT.
20% drop every year for an iPhone battery!! Wow
Great video, thanks.
How U can now have a Destroyer s9 xD
Please perform a durability test on Honor View 10. Thanks!
That reminds me, I would like if somebody built phone from parts from other phones.
Why you hate apple
What a tool
But, I thought that s8 became clear..!!! ??
i love how he says "pretty cool"
gotta give it a lil love how Zack picks on Apple
A W E S O M E
Thank you for making this video
I dont know why but the front cam looks like a gopro
Apple burnt beyond recognition in this video??
The little Apple jabs in your vids warm my heart. Love it. lol
Stop roasting apple lmao
I'll come back to this video 2 years later when apple announces their variable aperture
Apple hire him.....??
Like DSLR? You mean like a most cheap compact camera? :)
why ????????????
Great video and explanation!  Thank you for a job greatly done.
Galaxy S9 teardown and you cant stand not to criticize apple on every step, this is annoying. Apparently you can't make a video without Apple in it, otherwise nobody would watch it.
How do you know when to remove what? Do you watch other teardown or similar, or did you do it often enough to know your way around well enough?
???????
Love all the apple jabs. Great video as always.
Why not disagree s9 Plus
Mmm been waiting for this tear down since the leaks came out. Way to go Zack!
I got my S9+ today but I will not activate until I get my OtterBox Defender case so I don't pull a JerryRig
apple be like ... after 2 years for the first time ever we introduce the variable aperture
Love your videos
That was really do cool zack
Yeah fuck apple
I subscribed to you twice jerry .
With bxActions the Bixby-Button is just great.
Do you prefer the S9 screen or the s9+? and is the s9 Big enough and with wat can I compare the size of the s9 with wat for object Thinking about Buying 1 of the 2. :)
Is the bixby button the same as the power button?
The camera was so much interesting, same as the comment for Apple was????????
Do galium vs aluminium backed phone
I wish I could meet the aliens who designe such complex hardware.
Damn, Jerry is starting to reach new levels of fan-hating Apple.
Does it have Quattro? It means 4 in which language?
This guys really know how to review a phone, in and out.
what if that aperture toggle switch was left in between the end points??? could we not choose aperture between the provided range
At least u don't smash phones
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind. You will see this in an iphone by 2020" This made my day. :)
Jerry, why you hate that Bixby button?
Apple running 2 years behind? Don't you mean 5? ??
U stupid dork piece of shit u are behnd and Samsung crap who always coppies Apple no wonder it can’t have Face ID witch is 3 years ahead of everyone.... looser
This guy is Apple Savage ????
S9 teardown was awesome.the hardware rocks.especially the camera lens..
You speak so well and explain everything so nicely
I like this guy too much
Please test the Nokia 7plus, we gotta know how Nokia is going ??
Great work Jerry, thanks
2010 Nokia N8 also have light Frame please notice that phone
why did you stop doing camera comparisons ?
the way that aperture moves...makes me wonder if samsung could have given more f stops then only 2 options??
I love your apple roasts
Sir u are great clam and sharp Shows there is a possibility u can just pop the connector of the Bixby button ?? legend Just saying indeed. Respect
Sir Am big fan of u r voice
you did suggest Bixbey's murder! LMAO
I like when red arrows point to screw fixtures and I like Jerry...Meow!
Stop hating Apple so much!!!
U r ??
Hey , so you say that camera is controlled with magnets , soooooo if i wanna film a very strong neodium magnet up close will that affect my ois :))))))) ....just saying.....
this guy is the best
Bro its the power botton
yes but still no cat s41 tear down ??
I really wanted him too kill bixby
,,Our replacment backpanel is very cheap,, Apple never said
Zack just keeps getting better and better. He has single-handedly carved out a pretty unique niche on youtube, no mean feat in 2018. He is without question the very best at what he's doing around here. Plus, he absolutely [and accurately] skewers Apple in the most clever, charming and least offensive manner possible. Great writing and production :D
As a non-butthurt Apple fan, I admit I laughed at the 2-years behind comment. The S9 is a well designed and built slab. Not a fan of what Samsung does with Android, though. If only they'd be part of Android One.
In our country shit is fos and we call iphone ifos (iphos) :D
Audio Clarity " The best on any Youtube Channel"
I'm here because this is the best teardown channel and also because I've pre-ordered the 256GB S9+ so I'm getting it tomorrow here in Taiwan so Exynos variant. Roasted Apple is just the perfect topping and this is The Place to get it! The best thing is that they're all facts that sheep are always denying or making excuses for. Thank you Zack for telling it like it is... Raw and straight up in their faces. My 256GB S9+ will cost the same as an 64GB iPhone X LMAO! My 400GB MicroSD card is ready... 656GB!
S9 Good ??!
You definitely earn, to be subscribed Good video quality and definitely good explanation Thanks
"Apple is usually 2 years behind so expect this in the iPhone in 2020." DYING
JerryRapesEveryThing ??
Anyone else getting their S9 tomorrow! :D I also got that Dbrand black camo to go with it!
Should i buy the Google pixel xl?
You are genius .....
Same battery used as in S8?
been waiting for the camera how it works and know how to kill bixby button manually. thank you jack
Samsung is like the only company that doesn’t skip 9.
WEird, my s9+ has a diffuser! maybe theres a difference by market?
this consistent apple hate is amazing
can i send you my phone so you can fix it lol. Im serious it looks pretty bad the screen is broken and the camera lens glass is also broken and i cant afford to buy a new on lol (broke college student)
Rather to have that aperture technology two years later when it's well implemented rather than having it know and making the pictures look mostly noisy.
Amazing
I don't see the hype over the 400gb SD storage size cause the lg v10 went up to 1 terabyte and that phone is so old now
Jerry rig i am samsung galaxy note 3 neo N750 user . I lost my s pen can u please send me a link for buy s pen or send me one from ur mobile garbage
Bro, you're best in narrating things you do. And one reason to click that YouTube icon.
Youtuber by day hitman 4 hire by night lol
Your work is just awsome...
I love it when he throws shots at apple.
would like to see an earpiece comparison so I can understnd why samsung doesn't enable stereo on the s8
Drink Everytime he says" like a Lego " Fuck I am drunk af
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just... saying it's possible." Lol
Lmao iphone got burned in this video
5% watch cause they like technology 95% watch cause of him hating apple :)
ughh couldn't make it early this time because i was taking a nap :( well i guess I'm not one of the notification squad... when it gets to this video at least.
man this is the one thing that I was looking for an explanation for , thumbs up Jerry , you are more thorough in your demonstrations than even the ifixit guys . also thankyou for giving the bare truth about the iphone "2 years behind , you will see the mechanism somewhere in 2020" :D
Who else is using the new black mode of YouTube
A vibrator video...hmm...
LEGO-MAN Returns..
I love your videos and everything dude, but i unsubbed as soon as you became so biased, I’m no fanboy of either party, but you label these videos as teardowns, not opinions
this dual aperture mechanism system i have seen so many times before in some old nokia symbian os phones like nokia n8, nokia n73 etc. but nokia never mentioned that. But if you look close, you will see...
When you take apart phones they always look so cool!
Review + teardown the Wileyfox Swift 2X please
I normally really enjoy these videos but at 4 and half minutes I can’t tell if this is a Samsung teardown video or an Apple bashing video. Kind of annoying.
I will teardown my GALAXY S9 just to remove Bixby button from my phone ??
Thanks Zach! The dual aperture works exactly like I thought, with two shutters closing. Pretty cool, and reliable, though this design eliminates any position but opened or closed. I believe the four coils are electromagnetic lens positioning for the OIS. The aperture shutter should have a micro-solenoid actuator. Thanks again for another great video.
Love you Jerry. I love your sarcastic approach to nearly all your video is subtle and gr8.
Jerry do a review on asus new zenphone 5
Or try with the s9+ With note 8 camera
Can you put this camera part on the s8 or s8+
"Apple's usually 2 years behind...." Steve Jobs cries in his tomb!
You don't just earn the subscribe button, you fuc*** nailed it!
...like a little lego
"Crapple is usely 2 years behind, so u will see this in an iCrap in 2020" Truest shit I ever heard lel
I think apple should exclude a main camera because it takes up too much space
Kick Ass. I won’t touch replacing anyone’s screen on s9. They pulled an HTC and mounted too many parts on the lcd lmao
Do Sony XZ2 vibrator reveal
"My phone"? So you have switched?
That was not the Bixby button. It was the powerbutton. Looks like the bixby button uses the same ribbon as the volume rocker.
Excellent video Jerry.
I just don't understand how anyone could dislike your videos....
turn the csmeraa in without the lens
Man you always go hard on Apple it's weird we still haven't had the 'Dear JerryRigEverything' video from TailosiveTech
"I am not suggesting murder.. " Lmao.
Get that mole checked bud
174 fixed aparture lenses disliked this video...
Team Samsung or iphone? Me iphone ????just kidding
Did you teardown two s9 phones
What if... You dont put te lenses on the camera and try to make a photo?
Thanks Zack.was waiting for that,,keep the job bro :)
Roasting Apple ahead ????
Scratched the camera lens ?? scary
Man you roast Apple so hard! Love your videos, keep it up! :)
and do.. detailed comparison between gorilla glass versions.. it would be interesting..
I like turtles
Good video love it
That poor poor S9 has been used and abused all so we can be amused.
He is a professional mobile surgeon. Dr Zack
Always love your Apple roasts. Very tasty
This guys always bitter about Apple
guess who get free phones from Dbrand???
Would you shut up about Apple I am so sick of you bashing Apple in every one of your videos I am just about ready to unsubscribe your videos would be very interesting if you wouldn’t be such a jerk about Apple.
What do you have against apple bro?
There is no point to buy this phone then, hardly any difference
What do you think, in 2020 will samsung smartphone be as much as powerful as iphone of 2017?
sony xperia xz2 durability an tear down
Samsung variable ads first with imagined camera xd??
Its been 2 yrs since I bumped into ur channel - s7 edge, and I must say I've enjoyed each one of ur videos since then, they keep getting better, entertaining and educative. Keep up the great job
I love the Apple roasts :D
S9+is king
I'm not suggesting murder... just saying it's possible.
Use iFixit's adhesive remover
The internal design of this phone is so much better that the Apples, they are such a mess, 20 different types of screws, glue shit everywhere, you can tell who actually designs their phone internals and who slaps and glues it together.
Need to have him dissect Hillary clintons brain and see why its so sick... lol.. he would do a great job
I wish that his intro name was a bit bigger.
Guys through out the video there's a random flashlight looking thing in the top right... I think your studio is haunted.
You deserve 10 million subscribers real talk
LEGO should start paying you
I love how you roast apple ??
The button that you speak about is the power button
What will happen if you take the galaxy s9 camera and place it into the note8 or s8?
I like that you are so cold
I'm not suggesting murder but....??????
????????????
Any plans on tear down of s9 plus model? I know it would be almost same but, some minor differences might be worth a video.
I love this channel and the videos you make! But I’m starting to notice you are blasting on Apple more and more! I get it they are not everyone’s preference, but I like impartial reviews!
I love the murder part. Sounds reasonable. Well said. Hahahahaaha
I'm goona thankful to you because I have founded the real truth about the Galaxy s9
Can you do a g5plus tear down?
Thanks for the informative video. I was waiting for this. ??
Love when you rip on Apple! Nice vid.
Love from India !!!
Yesssss love the shade thrown on apple 2020 when they get this haha
About the flash diffuser, since it is such a small light source, having a diffuser that tiny isn't noticiable on any occasion
Dude you are the reason I watch a teardown video...Never repaired a smartphone but watched majority of your teardown videos...Thank you for the entertainment and apple roast ..FYI You are literally the 1% of the Youtube community who Shares the truth about apple rest are apple fanboys/sheeps...
Im here for apple bur XD good job
Good job
Wow what ca camera rip Dslr ?
The biggest arms in the tech yt industry with the most delicate hands.
Nice apple burns.
Jack all this videos with tear down you learn me how to fix my old phone HUGE THUMBS UP FOR YOU
Good job
Samsung should thank you for this vid
When you were showing the bixby button i think that was actually the power button
I love how he constantly shits on the iphone
The button you said was bixby was actually the power button. Remember, you had the phone upside down
Your videos are so mind relaxing... everything goes so smooth ????
So you have to destroy the screen to fix the broken glass??
Respect....and love from India????????
This video makes no sense because of the clear rear video from 2 days ago. Still a great video tho
"Apple's about 2 years behind so you can expect this feature in around 2020" will for sure be expensive af and branded as revolutionary brand new camera technology mark these words
Nokia n8 used similar kind of technique 10 years ago, inside the camera, it had extra lens like sunshades, when i point my camera to sun, internal black sunshades pops in
Very clean work ??????
???????? what's this android doctor
Samsung made a really cool feature with that adjustable aperture , but I’m 100% sure Apple will do it better and more technologically advanced than Samsung, this happens just every year???????
inb4 apple puts a variable camera lens in an iPhone and the apple fanboys start saying it's a new thing
When do replacements become available? Have any replacement parts ever become available?
Nice
1
Is it possible if you swap s9 camera to s9+?
Just watched a 2 minutes advertisement for you. So you can upload often.??
He fires 2 much at apple??????
How is Apple 2 years behind the competition when they make the best phone processors, as well as the most secure/advanced form of facial recognition and tracking on ANY phone? There was even 4K video recording at 60fps long before Samsung, but no one ever brings this up, either.
Mind blowing awesome
400gb...with that size...wth...so tiny
Plz do Sony XZ2
So why does the 4k 60 on the s9 do not have ois?
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind so you will see this in an iPhone in 2020." ????
Hey jerry,great stuff...keep up...bro why dont you teerdown smartwatch..just curious to see the modular circuit design of this small tech..hope to see one of it...if possible open the camera fully like you did in lg v30...
one of the most unique channel on youtube
Lol Samsung: don't worry the battery will stay strong for over a year Apple: expect a big drop in battery every year (if we don't do it manually)
Gonna see iphone use this camera tech in 2020 ??????
Give me ones more phone.. please ????
I don't know how u make this look so easy .. I tried opening a iPhone and It took me hours to put it back?? I guess that's what editing is for ??
Please do make a video on the different types of vibration motors :) ! and btw the amount of detail in this video was great!
That was the power button not the Bixby button that you told people how to break
love your videos can you shoot a video telling us how to replace a charging port
"I'm not saying to murder the guy (bixby) i'm just saying it's possible". I died
You should have put the camera back in but without the lens. I am very curious to see how it would look when there is only the Sensor.
"im not suggesting murder, im just saying its posible" hahaha
I‘d like to see a durability test of the MobileStudioPro. Wacom prides itself on durability but it seems to me they slacked quite a bit in recent years.
As always roasting apple ??????
Did anyone else hear the buttons "tick" when he turned off the video?
the aperture does make a LOT of difference to detail even in low light ,set it to 2.5f in a street lit night with slow shutter speed and the bricks look sharper and more detailed than the camersa flooding in more light
"You will be see this in 2 years on iPhone" ?????? Great man, keep going. Hi from Bosnia?
My favorite phone technician
Everything unclips like little lego pieces.
Awesome dude. Incredible work .. Stay inspired.
Is some of the footage reused?
"Apple's usually two years behind, so you'll probably see this in an iPhone around 2020" ????
Remember me thx bro
Now i understand why it is worth that much money
I don't think your patience for taking Samsung phones apart is fully appreciated, lol
2 Million almost there
I've subscribed??
I'm pretty sure Nokia was the first to implement Variable Aperture.
Apple will invent variable aperture in 2020
“I’m not suggesting murder,I’m just saying it’s possible” ??
Why do I feel like Jerry has a shelf full of Lego Builds ;-;
Super
Use a glue diffuser used in ifixit video
Nice vid bro :)
This channel is the best, this channel is the evidence that a channel don't need clickbait. Sorry for the bad English, I'm spanish and I'm learning English, tell me if my english is bad.
I love Sumsung
Swap the part from s9 to s8 and vice versa.
Love from india ...jerry..
Jerry cannot live without Apple. The guy loves the iPhone so much he talks every video about it hahahahhaha
Good job jerry
Apple jokes are the best ??????
how can you make 2 videos but with a phone without a camera and with a camera, and the same scratch on the fingerprint sensor?
I wouldn't piss off Apple folks if I were you. Those guys get triggered easily. We don't wanna have a shitstorm in your comment section.
Why does the teardown video comes after the clear video? Btw i love your channel and voice
Those guys with my name are always intelligent ????
Give me one phone so that i can watch alal your videos insted of killing them
not worth the hype, overpriced phone
hey, i always wanted to know if u can put a camera sensor like this, lets say in a other phone like the s8, u think its possible? would be sick
Great video!
It's hurt to watch this video... But i enjoy it in entire second ??
Test the sony Xperia xz2
i love your hair <3
Love how much trash he talks about Apple in these videos.
Can you actually move the camera and fingerprint sensor to the s8? So you relocate the fingerprint sensor on the s8.
u will see iphone in 2020 for that technology and call it revolutionary....
Zack u r awesome
I asked you so much that I would go to a picnic with a mobile but you did not give me, but rather asked me to subscribe too! You were thinking of a foreigner so long that your mind was very good but now I know that your mind is very small. Thanks for not giving.

Take a shot whenever he takes a shot at apple
Never buying a used phone from you ????????
Great vidéo !!
Another great video from Zack. But one minor mistake, the Bixby button that he pointed out is actually the power button. Since in this teardown we are looking at the back of the phone, the Bixby button will be on the right under the volume rocker. If you kill that button on the left, you won't be able to turn on the phone. Just a word of caution in case someone really wants to go ahead and kill the Bixby button.
Wow the Great video Sir ?? Sir bhut hi accha video h Sir thank you very so much sir ??
One of the best channels on youtube!
Yeah remove that Bixby button, oh wait, that is the power button you are pointing at.
What if you take one camera from the Dual Camera of the S9+? Will the camera app still work, because you got technically 1 camera of the dual camera left?
Wow
I cant buy and he's destroying ?? btw learnt many things from you Jerry ???
How nice.
Thanks for making video sir
Thumbs up for Samsungs Engineers who designed the camera
Sorry but the iPhone X camera looks so much better and realistic then the galaxy 9 camera.
The roasting of apple in this is insane, of course I liked it.
That was the power button you showed us, not Bixby, so guys don't destroy it!
Do the Xiaomi Mi A1!
Why do I find your voice so soothing???
Can some one explain me why many don't like bixby?
What skin are you talking about , I see no phone
Like teardown mini 4wd ??
Hey Zack you had mentioned that Apple removed the headphone jack because they weren't making money of it... And proprietary lightning port makes them money... Using that logic do you think Android Smartphone manufacturers make money by using USB type C headphones and removing the Headphone jack?
Do a Bixby button removal tutorial!
aperture science
Hello, on Samsung S8 you showed us that front facing camera had a OIS ``design`` ... does this S9 have a OIS on front facing camera ? Thanks.
Your channel is not only informative and entertaining, but also, your voice is extremely soothing..
Coool :) Ty!
Hey Zack I remember my Nokia n 73 with the same type of camera like s9. Please check it out and make a comparison video if possible. I watch all of your videos but talking to you for the first time. Bye have a good day
your video make teardowns look easy, but every time I try to teardown my electronics, I end up screwing them.... :')
A very different take on tech videos. Keep Spicing up the tech world. Amazing channel.
Lol 2020 xD more like 2024 took them many years to get wireless charging, fast charging, ip67 so i dont think 2020 iphones will get that camera
You've earned it, two yours age as i remember :-)
Dude...plz test cheaper phones also
Camera lens replacement
I like your explanation
Oh wow I didn't know Samsung was claiming 95% battery cap retention after 2 years. That's very impressive, I learned that Li-ion batteries drop about 20% per 500 charges (so about what apple is claiming) Am going to search for someone that tests this, because it's a major reason why I haven't bought a new phone (without user-replaceable battery) yet.
AppleRoastCounter is exploding xD
Can you make TNT please let me know if you need anything else from me please let me
What do you do with your old phones
'Apple is usually yeo years behind so you will see this in an Iphone in around 2020' ????
I love the Apple burns all the time! hahah
why you gotta hate on apple tho? :/
??????????????
Greetings from Aperture Science Enrichment Center
My view of smartphones was changed by this channel... Love u..
so if I break my screen and replace it will it not be waterproof anymore??
So good
One thing about Android phones which just isn't as good as iPhones is haptic feedback. All around the UI the amazing haptic feedback on the iPhone makes it very nice to use. Samsung is prolly the only manufacturer which comes close to that of Apple yet it is not as good. Hope to see improvement in Android phones in this area.
Plz Stop raping this beast????????
thank for give us details about camera
Lens finally revealed in next video... ??????????
Surgery on the S9 I see...
Iphone ??
circuit board look like 90s walkmans,, so cheap.
Galaxy s9 is only water resistant? Lmao Android plebs. iPhone x is water proof I'm a troll
Apple may invent the mechanical aperture in 2020. Indeed.
so, you have opened this phone twice?! once for this video and then again for the transparent back??? how many S9's do you have bro?!
Test xiaomi redmi 5 plus, please
Jerry is a Bixby fan??
You should not hate other company man
Do a video on the camera of galaxy s9+ on galaxy s9 and check if it works??
This make me subscribe
I ripped out my Bixby button according to the video.. Turns out you showed the power button as the Bixby button...
PLEASE do a seperate video on the S9+ Dragon Camo skin!!!
He is still angry about Apple ?? not inviting in their events ??????
Why do you hate apple so much ?
omg the apple rant again and again and again xd lmfao.
If JerryRigEverything liked this I'll subscribe to every account of him. If not I'll still do it cause he is AWESOME.
He is one of the very few i have subscribed and is a major reason to watch YouTube. Cheers Zack
Apple will probably invent the variable aperture in a few years...
The diffuser doesn't make any sense on the LED. Because a diffuser cant diffuses the light if it's so close to the light source it needs some distance from it.
How many of these tools do you have? :D
On the side I see the cameras fingerprint sensor and flash of the s9 plus but not according else
This guy is the only one who makes the most informative videos on smartphones these days...... Three cheers for this guy and hit like if you agree??????
lmfao Zack points at the pwr button and say things about Bixby
Awesome man... Great... Thank you so much
Can you put an S9 camera in an S8?:D
Not apple is 2 years behind, but samsung and android is 5 years behind apple and its superior OS
One small problem in this video. Before putting the phone back together, Jerry said that in the left is the Bixby button, but that is power button, Bixby is under the volume buttons.
Apple do that by 2020??????
good job bro...
Something new? Nokia N86 camera would like to speak to you
Your constant attempts to roast Apple result in most of the Apple fan base to cease watching your videos, and that’s a lot of people!
variable aperture camera first on iphone 2020
Zack got rid of the Jack
Apple 2020
Here's me using my galaxy S5 from launch day and I really don't mind it. No more updates after marshmallow but meh it does what I want. I have thought about the S9 but just gonna use my S5 until it breaks.
Jerry, prove you have the superpower to keep tabs on every comment and give this a heart XD i wanna freak my friend out.
This channel is the only one thats worth staying on youtube forever (there are a few exceptions)
basically, nokia n86 8s the first smartphone that have variable apperture (thats 3 mode versus 2 mode in Samsung)
I like the smell of roasted apples.
Nice hardware, shit software. Both copied from apple
Can we replace s8 camera module with the one from newer s9 and will it be functional??. If yes then instead it upgrading to s9 just for camera we can replace it with better one.
I just see this and it was nice I just wanted to know about the rear camera that how the aperture changes works Thumbs up for that I liked it And pretty good
Can we replace the s8 camera with the s9 camera?
Yea man explain the types of vibrators lol
Waao nice to see a great build inside Samsung phone ... I am not sure if you will pick my question or not but did you practice before tear down any phone? How you do it so smoothlessly??????
Samsung really benefiting from producing their own li-ion batteries for sure.
Definitely you’ve earned it bro. Especially, when you mentioned Apple’s strategy of arriving late to the party haha. AND I HAVE A REQUEST. CAN YOU PLEASE DO AN iPAD PRO TEARDOWN????
glass is glass
try connecting other camera sensors to the s9!
excellent video very impressive
Wew, Phone without a camera, that's pretty dope ??
glass us glass
I love how you kick Apple every time you can!!!!!
I was so excited to watch this video, I was really anxious to see what the camera lens looked like. ??
Love your tagline, life is a diy project
Did you just assume Jack's gender?! !!TRIGGERED!!
Re-upload?
This channel is my favorite Guide of choosing phones. You owned 1 subscriber!
Apple is two years behind ??????
So I'm not really sure why they went with a two bladed aperture that is limited to two fixed f-stops. Seems like that mechanism could have easily been developed with five or more blades and have additional f-stops. Maybe it was a challenge to make blades that small? Maybe they're saving it for the next Galaxy and this is just a proof of concept. Either way, we all keep skipping over the fact that the aperture does more than just control how much light hits the sensor.
What???? I am not still subscribed to this channel? seen many videos but noticed it now,,,,,SUBSCRIBED
Please give me the s9
I love that you take jabs at apple ??
Still waiting for the tacoma teardown and durability test ??
I need to see a teardown of a Tesla car
Jerry, are you saying the Apple will "invent" Variable Aperture Camera lens in 2020?
So the aperture can be either 1.5 or 2.4? I thought it can change gradually
Why do you hate apple so frickin much???!!
And after a min of watching, I know your video quality is really great. Subbed
I'll stay with my s8. Until another device become better. Probably the s10
"Apple will invent such camera in 2020 " LMAO.......
Jack, try to replace the camera
No Jack jokes ? Shame on you
Hey plz Make LG V20a and V30 Durability Test video.... Plz
Im the first comment?
can you PLEASE post workout videos please? Ive been dying to see your routine
Clean back s9?
Oh i cannot see it ..... Get away from my eyes ....
It was the power button not bixby
"Iam not suggesting murder..iam just saying it's possible"Lol bixby
Recently commented on facebook. Now here too. Hey jerry zack, you're awesome.
Best Mobile In The World
Test sony L1
Thank you for showing this.......i've been waiting for this to be shown by any youtuber........can you open the camera module little more to show the two flaps & the OIS technology.........
I smell some hate for happle here !!
Fun fact, the s9 actually supports up to 2TB SD storage. They only say 400GB because that's the largest microSD size currently in the market and they don't want to confuse anyone.
So how is the iPhone X 2 years behind any Android flagship right now? Save for the 458ppi screen (still competes with the 500-530 of 2K phones) it literally plays toe to toe with all Android flagships. There used to be a time when if you want good hardware, you'd have to go Android, but that's not the case anymore. I can understand the Apple hate as most people can't afford them:), but let's try and be objective
Aloy.testh irukka
The pry tool
"Glass is glass & glass can break"
I love the way Zac gives Apple a bite of their own "innovative" pie :D
Change your channel name to 'Jerrythesurgeon'..
the most stupid idea in the world. the stupidest way to ruin a beautiful phone
You should do a project where you build a smartphone from other smartphone spare parts
The apple shade is real... lmao, you'll see this in an Iphone in 2020
Giving smasung credit for a Sony camera :D
OPEN THE MOTOROLA MOTO G5 (btw the vibrate motor is very powerful and I would like to see how that works)
I'm liking the new features on the S9
Jerry Anna thopu dammute appu
i think you should succumb to the circles to show to screws
i love how you tear down everything and give us an inside look of these high tech phones
2020: we present you with the fist iphone with variable apperture
Best youtuber ever
You've earned it! Subscribed!
I like that he does what he does well and doesn't change too much. Keep it up!
Camera comparaison s7 vs s9???
Most intelligent YouTuber out there ??
Well now someone's going to murder Bixby!!!(I am) B-)B-)
Can u make a video on samsung galaxy j7 prime please!!!!!
Magnets how they work
Thanks Jerry... The most awaited test ??
Amazing video as always. Keep it up Jerry!!!!
Superb video..you had nicely described aperture mechanisms visually
XZ2 NEXT PLEASE!
worker at samsung: omg is that how it works?
Samsung is the king of innovation......but still some manufacturers use words like innovative marvellous ground-breaking blah blah.....??
You are showing the power button!! But calling it a BIXBY button ??
So many Apple haters. So many ignorant where Samsung would be without Apple.
I was waiting for.. this video ????
Is it possible to use camera from s9 to s7edge?
I've never been this early. Whoo!
Samsung can take down this video ..bixby is their child ????
Can you go back to the ZTE Axon M and do a teardown? Would like to see how the cables are ran between the 2 screens.
>Variable aperture in phone cameras >Something new Hahahaha! Wait, you're serious? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Nokia already did phone with VA camera back in 2009! It was N86 8MP! You can Google it if you want. Samsung is 9 years late to the party!
Looking forward to the Vibrator comparison.
This was really interesting. I liked how you tore down the camera too and explained how it worked. I wonder if it becomes possible in the future to have more than two apertures in phones?
Man! So many Indian viewers here
Can we replace s8 camera with s9 camera ??
Lol Apple will be 2 years behind I have an iPhone X but man this guy lol keep it up bro
Hi ..I m from India. .i love your tear down video
Been waiting for this video >.< It's nice knowing what my phone looks like inside, thank you sir!
Asian?
Can you put s9+ cameras on note 8? Will it work?
"If I've earned it hit the subscribe button..." If not hit the bixby button?
It would be nice if Samsung decides to make a "variable" aperture that really means variable like f2.4 all the way up to f1.5 instead of two apertures only
cooooooooooool
Hei!!
No captions=dislike
great work keeps it up bro... can u make the "Two aperture" system to "Truly variable aperture" system like anything we can use between 1.5 & 2.4 like incremental changes in aperture not stuck with only two aperture.
This guy's channel is one of reasons i like youtube.
wow ! this is awesome man ????
You are great
First the back of s9 was in black colour and in the end it turned clear
Imagine if he turned on the rear camera and it worked - showed the table and everything, even though he removed it.
6 : 09 I guess if have to be nice Apple has been defusing their flashes on their iPhones for a quite a while now ??????
Only hating on Apple, not mentioning that S9 is practically S8 with better camera and cheap copy of Animoji. And btw. Samsung is going to discover notch in few years, so don’t worry. ????
Glass is Glass & Glass Can Break.
super ??
What do you do with the s9 plus?
You are awesome
It's Like your a robot knowing how to disassemble the phone and it only just came out!!!
Awesome as always!
Lego Style Connector
5 : 28 I'm not suggesting murder I'm just saying it's possible ??????
Jack from unboxtherapy
is that the same phone on which you did clear back mod...... you must have done this video before modding that.or is this na new one ... ????????
Guzel parcalasin hll
the apple jokes never seems to end :D :D
BC saalle Samsung Ka baap hai iPhone
As usual Zack is the best!!!
Jerry that wasn't the Bixby button, that was the turn on and off button, thank God u didn't killed it
U must be sponsored by Lego??!!
He is a god of phone destoyer
apple is going to "invent" this in two years...
Pain in comments . Tech slayer :D
You are genius
I like how you burn apple all the time
"Apple is always behind" REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
super
LEGO STYLE!!
Amazing to see the variable aperture working from inside ...Great teardown??
I love how he bashes apple in like every video xD
My phone show charging over usb whenever i plugged it with wall charger ?? help me I m using original charger and i try other chargers too ... My handset is moto g5 plus
Hell yea we want a vibrator explanation video ?? Would be great if you'd do a vibrator teardown as well ??
I got a s9 ad
I am curious how will the image look only with the image sensor.
Unclip it like a little LEGO
Best vids
It was a very quick video, we are not professionals like you. Please slow down a little bit. Thank you
THANK YOU FOR TEARING DOWN YOUR EXPENSIVE S9 AND SHOWING US Aperature!??????
Thousand dollar phone doesn't have variable aperture,but a $720 phone does. I N N O V A T I O N
zack just casually roasting apple xd
Best vibrater is taptic engine
Where is the Vacuum Cleaner Teardown?
Can u put front cam in rear with some glue
More wisecracking against Apple?? you're videos are literally the best.. You're the same person as me. Keep going :) your videos are amazing.
like a little lego
My guy about to do a vibrator video. ?????? Great vid as always!
I wish you would have reinstalled the camera to show us how badly you damaged it
??????????
Ahh that 60 fps video <3
Awesome!
did he say little lego ....mehn
"Glass is glass, and glass can break" The best quote of 2018!!!
So detail, thats why you're my fav
*Apple cries in corner*
Im not suggesting murder... Im just saying its possible.
SAVAGE SAVAGE SAVAGE ! Apple and bixby part cracks me up.
Which video did he make first ? This or the transparent S9. Or is this another phone?
like a little LEGO
Nice nice nice
Apple roasting puns are the best ????
Superb camera
Why are there so many Indians here using bold letters?
Hey im getting unsubscribed (by youtube) from other channels including your. its no problem but i want you to know some people may get unsubscribed
Has there been a teardown in which he hasn't mentioned Legos?
Bixby, fuck u!
Hats off to Jerry ????
Apple must be burning right know with those jokes ?? I love your videos man!
Wanted s9 plus teardown but u r probably using it
Jerry how do u feel when u make 900 Euro phones suffer? Is it satisfying?
So... my Note8 don't have Diffuser on the LED flash.... ??????
Oh my god stop bringing Apple to every video and stop comparing to other phone why do you rant in every video ???????
plz test samsung a8 2018
Waiting for this
Wish you will use a single unite for all of those crazy stuff to save money though Zack is Jery Dig Everything
Apple is usually 2 yrs behind ????????
95% battery retention claim from Samsung - PLEASE...and you believe that shit? Show me one Galaxy S7 with decent battery usage, bought from release. total bulshit and you believe it...
Ah yes. The fresh Apple roast. ??
Will you do a PlayStation controller cleared project? Or something like that? I don’t even know if it’s possible
Apple designs their batteries to retain 80% of their capacity.
Never seen a pry tool get bent.
If you are completing the tear down operation you can assemble the mobile as it is and it can work properly or not. ??????
What happened to the clear one?
He must be an Android,IOS surgeon
very amazing video sir. i have watched this in 4k 60 fps
Iphone is literally 2 years behind.Yay Samsung??
Apple will have these features around 2020. Lol
Was waiting for this video only...
Jerry also tears up Apple during his tear down videos. Love that satire ??
Apple 2020 two year behind
Gotta love those subtle jokes in a serious tone of a soothing voice. Interesting vid especially the variable aperture part of the camera.
Waiting for the video on vibrators ??
This video was just a roast of Apple
No scratching or burning in a teardown video ??????
Didn't he turn it transparent? Exposed
That variable aperture reminds me of R2D2 for some reason
Why do you always hate on apple
Did you film this before the clear build?
Dbrand doesnt't have skins for the Huawei honor 9??... I really wanted one
Hey zack do you think its worth the price????
A little part of me died watching him touch the lens with his tweseers.
This phone is soo nice wonder why ??????
Super
I love the rips on Apple. Keep up the good work
great video!!
Hiii
glass is glass and just like a little lego makes me smile all the time
OUR LITTLE BUDDY JACK..????????
I noticed that this video was recorded before the clear s9 video
Samsung is brilliant
"apple is tow years behind" , burning apple is a must XD
just put some tape on Bixby button contact pad????
*Oooo Pretty Pictures Camera Revealed
Haha know what you sign up for.....????get that Isheep
That's the power button! ??
Apple are usually 2 years behind lol.Make that 3 now????????
wow
how to teardown phone while roasting apple
U have a good skills
Nice video.. Keep the good work up.. ????
I watch his videos just for the apple roasts. ??
anytime is a good time to diss apple
Apple must've turned into an Apple pie with all of your flaming roasts.
I from Indonesia. I always waiting ur new video. And now im waiting u upload Teardown galaxy s9+
How could one possibly hit a dislike button for this kind (clear and informative) of video? :/

Yay!!!
'Apple usually 2 years behind??????'
Awesome
How can you tear this. it's so beautiful
How many back glasses do u have?
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" lmao
Your voice is so soothing
That Dbrand camouflage skin is really nice. Imma get one for my S7.
One of the best vids watched today
Samsung takes a while to clip up a new phone... but Mr Jerry takes no time to open it up!!
Well this was so soothing to watch. Your videos are like meditation for the viewer!
I feel like i watched this Video 3 Days ago...?
zack you make no sense. research stuff before you ditch apple. i have an iphne 6s plus that was bought in 2015 and still has 93%battery retention. and i have checked that. apple did the 90% battery retention in 2015.
Jerry is awesome
I will see you around
Apple usually 2 years behind lol
"I'm not suggesting murder I'm just saying it's possible" ????????
LOL HAHAHAHA "IPHONE 2020"
How long do you usually tear down a phone?
10 188th
Best YouTube er ......
Its really satisfying me
Please, can you durability test some of the cheaper but good chinese brand phones like Xiami, Elephone, Doogee, Ulephone etc. It also makes sense on the financial side since you don't have to buy expensive phones
Apple roast lol
How long do you usually tear down a phone?
Your video are really good & you are great. Love from India ????
Finally video is up.... yayyy!!
Awesome man !
That's alot of inners
Who all are watching hit like!!
Was expecting some magic pull tape below the battery. It's quite satisfying to see him pull it????
Hey there Jerry nice hairstyle
Phone doctor ????????
Damaged Camera for Us ..?????? You are Great ..???
Wow
S9+ teardown
Could you review screen protectors?
Apple will invent such camera in 2020
Hay you torn down a non clear s9 and reassembled a totally clear s9??????????????????????????????????????????
that apple joke made me ROFL
That's not the Bixby button. That's the power button.
Hi. Can you please make Durability test and teardown of Huawei P10 Plus? Please

Maza aa gaya bencho
What width cell phone tape is needed?
The first and last part of last part of the video is from S9 clear mod video!!...Good job!! He saves lot of time in editing!!!??
JerryRigEverything It's official, after listening to and analysing that monotone but hilarious wise cracking humor for the um-teenth time I'm convinced that Zack was built by Dbrand Robots.
Teardown video's are so damn interesting!!
Fantasy
Why post three videos of the same phone...!! Even the last one was a near full teardown.!
What if you plug that camera without lens in S9 and then open the camera app. I want to see what will happen's then.
Solid quality content for someone who wants learn how some tech works on the inside :)
hehehe??
15 mins late why ???? What’s inside would be proud
Hi
"this is the same hardware you would find in a professional DSLR camera" Yeah ut waaaaay miniaturized and not as effective. Having this feature in a phone is a gimmick.
If Jerry reads the comments he’ll pin this ?? Enjoyed the vid btw !
i want it... please give me s9
Please make an S8 or S9 giveaway. Like if you agree
nice...

Will the apple roasting statements ever end?
It takes real bravery to tear open such beauty ??????
...
Early
The most awaited test is hare??
Yo
Ohh yeah sure apple is always 2 years behind... right. Just like the touch ID and dual camera’s
Jerry Hate apple. U said Apple is 2 years behind in innovation. Who brings potrait mode first in camera. Obiously Apple. Samsung also copied this
I'm not suggesting murdering, I'm just saying it's possible
Ohoo
As ur Chanel mention RigEverything, Sir u did really good wit details...kip it up.
finally??
135th
Apple is usually 2 years slow! Laughed so hard on that joke ????
It's all in the details! This video and that phone has plenty of them. I'm loving the variable aperture camera!
Your video and a cup of coffee is all that i need everyday
Dude!!!!! That was awesome. .. You are just famtastic at what you do. And joking as well. ??
Funny how the EXACT variable Aperture lens was already in a Samsung device in December 2017, last year. Made a video about it too.
Fan from India
yeah
U should do a custom skin below the glass !!!!!! Making it one of a kind !!!
I have a question. I am just curious what the image from the camera would be with the lens removed. Could you test that Jerry? You already removed it.
Deja vu
14th liker :D
:)
Also, could you do a teardown and durability test of the Huawei honor 8 Pro? Like if you want Zack to do this!
Damn..... Wish i could make it first....i fail everytime

Would you want a tiny second phone that shares your phone number?
looks awesome now they need to make a magnetic forearm holder, so much better than a smart watch ;)
why would you need the special Verizon app to get messages on both phones if both phones use the same phone number? That should just work with any text messaging app by default no?
Why not just get a small phone from the beginning. Duh!!!!!
For those of you that don't know Android has been doing face ID for years way before Apple it ever thought about doing it
The idea behind this is great, and I’ve been waiting for an option to use a smaller phone when I don’t want to carry my massive iPhone 8 Plus around. But honestly, how is this any better than getting a cheap, small smartphone and moving my SIM card to it for the same reasons? This is way overpriced for a phone, and you have to pay an extra $10 a month. Doesn’t make much sense
im getting this and the google three for christmas ?? i
Is this a phone for ants!!!?
Wheres the volume buttons?
We heard you like phones so we made a phone for your phone so you can phone will you phone
Unnecessary.
What a stupid idea lol
Nice gift for my unborn baby!! ??
Can we play pubg in it?
So basically, it’s useless.
It's a shame that Verizon has a seemingly monopoly on that Palm Phone. In my opinion, the smartphone market is in desperate need for a smartphone of that size. I would totally pick one up and ditch my too big smartphone for one of those.....
This is so hilarious and so so stupid
Man creates phone. Man shrinks phone. Man grows phone. Man makes small accessory phone because phone is too big.
Meh. Why? I don't know who this is for. If you have a phone, you have a phone. If you want a smaller (and not to mention more capable one) buy a smaller sized flagship that's not watered down. Then you don't have 2 phones to keep up with or an extra $10 tacked on your bill.
My first smartphone was a palm was cool with the keyboard that hid when you closed it The first to use wireless charging
Isn’t that what a smart watch is for Checking messages making phone calls without taking your phone out And it’s the most convenient with it being on your wrist If you had this why not just use you phone? Lol
Why would anyone do that
I want a watch holder case for this. Great video as always btw. We are big big fans of Bohn(d)
What's the point
I would buy it if it could be a main phone
I actually think this is cool, BUT price and limited carrier support is a problem...
No thanks.. I'll just hang on to my se ??
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones....
A really nice mp4 player.
I honestly would love this for work. I work in construction and even the beefiest phone cases with a tempered glass couldn't save my note 9 screen from getting cracked, this would be a great alternative so I can still listen to my music while having a smaller form factor to carry while on the jobsite
This is a good idea! If your going out to dinner, church etc and you don't want to carry a big phone is would be ideal.
a small phone for ur bigger phone. Wtf is wrong with this world. If u want a small phone just buy a small phone
Sooo life mode is basically your standard flight mode with a different name? :D
What a waste of time and money
Is there any launcher that makes stock Android look like this phone's Android?
I think if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone SE is available on a number of sites. Probably get a refurbished one for less than 1/2 the cost of this ridiculous device.
small is always bigger.........
No keyboard? Fail
No!!!! Lol a phone for your phone
Foolishness. What the people really need is a left hand phone for when you are holding your main phone in your right and and your left hand has no phone in it. Also foot phones should be a thing.
Or...it's an crazy idea, but hear me out.... You take your actual phone out and check your notifications ??
As someone who works in a cellphone store. This thing would absolutely kill it as a stand alone device. I constantly get older customers who want as small of a phone as possible but trying to sell this thing to higher end tech users as a connected device is an awful sales plan.
The palm pilot is trying to make a comeback...
Pancakes...
All I hear is a extra $10 a month
I want to use this as a stand alone phone, kinda bull that I can't
"My phones to big." is the ultimate first-world-problem.
What was the point of this video? Turn on life mode, the battery will probably last a while, but we didn't test it. Take a photo, it'll probably look ok, but we didn't look at it on a big screen. C'mon man...
So it’s the answer to the Apple Watch ??
$350? What an amazing joke. Who would want this over a Moto G6, Essential Phone, literally any non-flagship?
I have a babushka phone. When it rings and I just want to answer the call, I disassemble the babushka to the smallest phone and insert it into my ear cavity.
Stupidest idea i ever seen
I'd rather have a compact phone like that but have it be standalone. Seriously not interested in it being secondary, that's a waste of money.
I'll probably buy one. The reason is that I work a lot and having something with an extra battery with phone features would be a good thing. Chargers and cables can fail and they might not die conveniently. Also, when you want to go to the gym and not potentially lose or damage your $1000+ cellphone.
Google Assistant thought you said "And you can do boy stuff". ??
This is why Im interested in the apple watch 4
Lol. Reminds me of my first android phone. SONY XPERIA X10 MINI PRO.
I figured out a good use for it... say you want to keep in touch with your young child but dont want to give them a full powered phone. Can you use it like that?
Why would anyone buy this
What is a weekend phone and why are you advertising this?
Nah, this ain't it Palm. Come back with a physical keyboard, a reasonable size display compared to todays phablet shitfest, load it with the best features webOS had over android and give us a real alternative again.
I sorta guess this would be good for a young child. But I'm having a hard time seeing who would buy this.
An excuse to charge me an extra $10/mo? Sign me up!
It looks a little too much like an iPhone X
Excellent add on phone
why?? lol
And this is why Palm collapsed...
I used to listen to your palm podcast when the Pre came out it was a fun phone. I had a few of the old treo series and loved them.
A phone for when I'm out getting shitfaced
So... a smart watch but less convenient? ?????
I honestly can’t imagine using this thing. By that point just have a small, basic phone that’s a glorified Bluetooth headset that you can use while your real phone is in your backpack. The last thing anyone needs is to decide which phone they’re going to use on which day
The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen
Zoolander phone ??
Im dying to see Xzibit/Pimp my Ride memes of this...
I bet it could do good overseas if they brought the price down
I like thes one
a phone for your phone...I have an old Nokia that it is great when I go out at night for emergency calls and that is great!
It would be more useful if they just released it as a small phone for people who don't want a gigantic smartphone.
This is basically a smartwatch in the case of phone. I mean... it's not bad idea!
Once upon a time this was a normal sized screen, actually bigger then some with slider keyboards
That thing is cute actually and yes, I want my Life Mode to be always on!
They should've just made this a full fledged phone and stuck a keyboard with it and make it a palm pre phone
If this an android phone why is there the Apple Music icon on the screen?
palm phone se
Or you can just not look at your normal phone. Do we really have so little self control?
I could see this be a good phone the following: Jogging, going to the gym, going to the beach, and also going to an evening event where you'll be wearing sleek clothing and don't want your phablet bulging out of your pocket. Of course if you're out in nice clothes you'll probably want the high quality camera on your regular phone close by. I think people who exercise a lot and who also have some disposable income will be very interested in one of these.
Next! Cant even finish the review
This would be excellent for 50-100. Not for 350.
I want it as my only phone.
Would love to use this as an mp3! I might get it ?? it would also elongate my phones life since I wont have to bluetooth everything (I hope) I can probably sync my watch to this thing instead too
Would love to use this as an mp3! I might get it ?? it would also elongate my phones life since I wont have to bluetooth everything (I hope) I can probably sync my watch to this thing instead too
Well, it's an interesting idea if not anything else.
This is literally going backwards, this is what smart watches have been doing for some time and it makes way more sense and still people don’t want to spend the additional $10 a month
I love it ??
So this is what Stephen Curry invested for? Hmmm
Mad thinking behind This one... IF im going to the beach or to the Mountains i dont want to carry with me something that costs 350 bucks... I want something disposable. Id be better off talking my actuall Phone that was cheaper and much better than this
Can I please have the number of the dealer of the guy who came up with the idea for this ?
Should've been stand alone. The fact you MUST pair it with another phone totally misses the mark.
This is pretty stupid. Kind of what I expect from the verge these days.
If I needed this I'd just get a smartwatch
Should of been geared towards kids
This is just a waste of R&D and materials lol.
"A certain age"? Dieter being the Palm Guy is brought up like EVERY WEEK on the Vergecast.
Cute ??
This is the best palm could come up with, does this company want to fail?
I want small phones. I hate the big phones they push now. I dont need it to be able to edit video or game. Who does that? It's a nightmare and frustrating on a phone. I would totally get this phone but I can't swallow the price and having two phones, Ridiculous...
Give me an unlocked version for $200-$300 and I will buy it right now. This is exactly what Ive been wanting. I just wont switch carriers for it.
Lame
When i clicked on this video I thought “I would most likely use this” but after finishing it I can’t help but think.. what??
I want one. Do they export it?
Honestly this seems like a good phone for your kids when they go on field trips or staying at a friends house. When I’m older and having kids if this is still a concept in motion I wouldn’t mind having it for my kids when they’re old enough
Wow....this is stupid. Why not just get a smartwatch? The price on this is $350. You can get a Smartwatch with LTE for that price. You aren't REQUIRED to pay that $10/month if you keep your phone with you. If you don't want to carry around a big phone, why buy a big phone in the first place? I use an Apple watch and without taking my phone out of my pocket, I can do a lot of things. I can send/receive messages and phone calls, see my calendar, play music, use Siri, get directions, etc...Not to mention, i don't have to carry it in my pocket...I can wear it, therefore I get the added benefits of health monitoring and fitness tracking. I understand that I still need my phone with me (since I didn't opt for the LTE model) but it's available to use without your phone. With this, even though you don't have a large phone in your pocket, you STILL have a phone in your pocket.....
Sure, sell it for $50, with no network and just a wifi and parental controls built in I'd get one for a older child. It's pointless.
What a stupid idea
Let me get this straight, ur selling me the same thing I already carry but it does alot less for a similar price....
1:22 it'll let you do boys stuff
I’d be the first person to buy a 2018 pixie or pre. This is not that.
It actually looks really cool. If they made a bigger version. Say a 4.7 inch screen. That would probably be my next phone.
I miss palm. Pre was my first legit smartphone.
Why can't this whole concept just be an app on your device that just limits usage & improves battery life via airplane mode? & the number is already on it? Or get a smartwatch. It solves a problem that doesn't exist.
Where can i buy it from? Please tell me.
Was thinking about picking one of these up for fun but if I have to use Verizon's messaging app I'm out..
Some please put that in the garbage bin.
What's its price
Where do we can buy it
about ten years ago this screen size is the norm.
Looks similar to Samsung Champ
Failed. Big time.
Where can you buy this?! I want it!
Recently downsized to a xperia xz2 compact. Refused to go smaller than that. I must say it's refreshing to be able to use a phone in one hand again.
Darn. I was just wanting a smaller phone.
They should've priced this at $200 or less, but no more. As for Number sharing, $10 monthly? Was $5 really not enough? More importantly, why does Verizon feel the need to make that as a Service???
This is so cute, but I think it’s too expensive.
What is "weekender phone stuff"?
I´m love!! I want it!!! Great Video!
Wow, takes me back to my first android phone, live with Walkman.
I'm sorry to say this but my iPhone SE 128GB is much bettuh.
That is so stupid, why would anyone buy that
I feel uncomfortable looking at the size and lagginess of the phone.
Most pointless thing ever.
anyone remember how big of a flop the Microsoft kin phones where I bet this will be the same
Looks like a small phone, I-pod.
Do you know how stupid you would look trying to explain to someone that you are paying extra per month for a smaller phone to avoid your larger, better phone? Why just why?
Meh, I thought it was neat. Might be good to hand down to a kid with that extra plan..?
Great! Now if we can only get a big phone to go along with the small phone
If the term "weekend phone" is in your vocabulary, you probably also have brunch with people you don't like and do yoga every Wednesday.
This thing is awesome! You all are missing the point! Imagine you're wanting to go on a run or to the gym or working outdoors and don't want a huge phone in your pocket and still want the ability to make and receive calls AND take a pic of something pretty or a selfie while doing those things. You can't with a watch cuz there's no camera and texts stuck on a watch. Enter the Palm niche. You can hardly feel this thing in your pocket and the texting on it is actually pretty easy. It's so small and light it's very freeing. Go out on the town and take all the pics you want, but without having to stuff a huge phone in your skinny Jean's or your bra. Lol Theres definitely many people who would love this product.
I kind of get the idea, I would actually use this as my only phone to see what it's like. But the battery is just too small. With an 1500 mAh battery this would have had a chance...800 mAh is just too little for a full Android at this time. It will probably not even last a day fully connected.
this is horrible. if you want a small phone buy one.
Can it be used as a standalone phone? Because for those who just want a regular smartphone this looks amazing but if it's required to pair it with a plus phone or phablet to make it work that's just stupid lol.
It's really amazing, just like Unihertz Atom rugged smartphone which i have now. This kind of tiny phone is really suitable as a second phone when go outside.
Can you use this with iphone ?
HOW IS THIS A PHONE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ON IT?
I worked for Palm ?? I ??’d my job and the Palm Treo!
so nice
me too !!! I'm a Palm guy !
What I am really thinking, Dieter, is how bad this review was. It's almost as if you didn't even use the phone for 5 minutes. Wow.
What? Why? It seems that one of the leading smart watches with LTE essentially serves the same purpose while also being stylish - possibly iconic - wearables.
I want this to be a stand alone device. I'm done with mega screens.
Soooooo, an Apple Watch?
I would buy it for work. I'm a bike messenger and all I need is a tiny phone for Google maps, Gmail, walkie talkie app and Spotify.. but it should work fast, otherwise it's pointless. Anyways, too bad it's not an own product. 10$ isn't worth it.
$100 i'll buy it
Face ID? Pfffffff- FacePalm
Port a Pixel camera app to it & get HDR+
This is more or less what Apple want me to do with my Apple watch and my AirPods. And works very nice!!!
I have an iPhone X and I want a little phone. I had a (well, I still do but it has no sim) Siemens S56 which is .75”x4”x1.75”. No, it isn’t smart (although it tried to be: it had email) but it was easy to carry in my pocket and the audio quality was surprisingly good. Enough about old stuff. I like this new form factor but I’d like to see it as a standalone phone. I’m a bit too entrenched in the iOS ecosystem to switch to Android but the idea of a small, standalone phone would be intriguing.
No sim-card slot meeh
My only question is. Why?
"this thing addresses problem that don't exist" - gilfoyle (silicon valley) i mean now we need a phone for a phone ??
I would love the international SIM version...
3:47 this type of launcher looks great for me...how can i find it or similar of this?
It's got the HW of a fully functional phone, but tnx to Verizon you cannot use it as a phone... nice
This is just a cash grab by TCL. All they accquired from HP was the brand. RIP WebOS, Pre3
Its tiny but not full screen ??????? I think it would be better if full screen.
Besides the processor battery and screen that phone has better specs than my current one!
Android? Never mind.
Apple already solved this problem with the Apple Watch.
Still better than my phone
this is perfect for cheating on test
thats the coolest freakin idea someone as PALM could come up with...mannn got me excited
i need this phone, but not in that price point.
$350?? Better buy standalone Android-Operated smart watch
So it’s like a less convenient Apple Watch with fewer features. Interesting...
whats next. smart Pagers/beepers? because that what i thought when i saw this.
Damnit 34gb it's better then my old phone that is big
i could play fortnite on this thing
the stephen curry phone
This has more ram than my iPhone 8...
Get a watch band for this
I am ready to buy this phone or similar size phone if it has standalone connectivity. Phones are becoming too big to use as a phone. Calling feature of a mobile phone is become 1% of the total functionality of a phone.
We need another iPhone SE but with a 4K oled display and all the other flagship essentials.
So it's a smartwatch...
would make a lot more sense if it was not a "side" phone and if it was cheaper
I think if this gets popular enough, custom roms will come out for it and it will become a little phone on its own.
Still has better specs than the phone im using right now
I'd give this a $50 all 10s
?? pixel 3 turned red!! After watching this side phone I mean side notch
Where's my palm treo!? That thing was super fancy, not this one
This would be great at 50-100 dollars. I would buy it if it worked as a kids use this-to-call-me-to-pick-me-up phone. Like a smart walkie talkie, beeper with GPS thingy for quick coordination and emergencies. Idk but I like it even though it completely useless.
Stop trying to make Palm happen
Gameboy emu masterpiece?
I would want this as my primary phone if it could stand alone. As a physically active person, I don't like hauling around a giant smartphone when I'm playing tennis, golf or riding motorcycle. But this could easily fit in my jeans or shorts without cargo pockets.
Did you say it sells for $350, lol thats more than 2X the price of my main phone!!
No, I don’t want a second smaller smartphone. I want my main phone to be 1 or 2 inches smaller. If this Palm was a real phone, with those specs, they would have my money by now.
I love that UI
Now I gotta buy my phone a phone smh ???????
I'll just buy a notch for that price.
Dang! I was wishing it wasn’t Android but a Palm OS.
Can it be my running phone? Load up Strava and lets run.
Id rather take my sim card out and put it in another phone rather than pay $10 a month fot that bs service. Also id rather buy a cheap android phone than pay $350 for that bs
Weekender phone with all the distracting features of any other smartphone? So basically this phone will give your a headache over the weekend looking at the toy screen. This phone doesn’t make any sense! AT ALL!
$350 for this phone? I can get a decent Samsung phone on eBay at that price
They overegineered this so hard. It would have been PERFECT if they cut out the whole verizon/dual phone thing and just gave us a kind of "ultrabook" tiny smart phone.
I hope this product fails so hard they name an economic phenomenon after it. If they sold it as a normal phone I can stick my normal SIM card into, I'd run out and buy one today. If it's locked into a "secondary only" role and you have to own one of those giant phablet meathook abortions along with it, I hope they don't sell a single one.
I'd happily bin my existing chonker of a phone if I could get this form factor as a standalone offering. Seriously.
Personally, i also like smartphone devices between 5-5.5 inches. For me its easy to use and one hand friendly, but now every company is lunching massive screen size smartphone, company should bring back the smartphone sizes of 4.5 to 5 inches screen....
If it use at least Snapdragon 450, maybe I will buy it.
My mobile but as the same spec but it is 6 inch.
Man I'd rather get my old HTC Aria and make that work lol
This is possibly the most pointless stupidity I've seen in a long time. You either want to use your phone or you don't.
Tbh I would gladly use something like this as my only phone.
I’ll just buy Light Phone
I dig it
Palm Phone Hands on Hah.
Yhe berge
COME TO SPRINT ;-; Its so cute :(
Over-priced for a secondary phone which we may use maybe two days in a month.
If this phone was $50 it would sell like hot cakes and be better then having a smartwatch in my opinion but $350 if rather purchase Galaxy s4 on eBay for $90.
Pretty sure this product will fail
I love the size of it.. I don't use any phone after iphone 5 because they're getting bigger n bigger .. a smart device should be small compact and functional that's it..
I feel like this would be good for kids.
Big Drawback is 800mAh battery at this price point
4G LTE?
OMG I'M IN LOVE!
It looks cute, but it's not a full function android phone. I am keeping my iPhone SE.
Why would you even want a smart phone? My computer can do all that and more with a real keyboard and bigger screen, and with a 70Mbs Internet connection.
But does it run fortnite
I'm using a $20 android phone that's bigger and better than this just no seriously just no throw this idea into the garbage
Why can't we just get a new compact phone? Like 4.5 inches or something?
I don’t get it a mini phone for your phone ? Who wants that...
I think we really just need to use our phones less.
This is the stupidest product I've seen in years
Does it also come with a smaller Palm smart watch for when I don’t want to drag my regular size smart watch around?
If the Palm Pre and Apple Watch has a kid... would of been nice in 2011
I didn't see anything on it, so I'm sorry if I missed it. Is this capable of Wi-Fi hot spotting? This will make this fantastic for those of us on Google Fi!
I despise the "neutrality" of this review. Sometimes you have to be brave, be honest and call it like you see it: this product is superfluous. Do not buy this product. Do some consumers prefer a small(er) phone? Yes. Do any consumers (other than the wealthy ones) want to buy a secondary phone for $15/month + $10/month (in transmission charges), that is much weaker and less functional than their "main" phone? NO. A product review should not just be a dull description of the capabilities of a product, but also an opinion about whether or not a consumer should purchase it. If the latter is lacking, that leads me to believe the reviewer is not doing his/her due diligence and is really just a shill for whatever company wants its product "reviewed".
The only reason I can think of that explains why this product exists is so that Verizon can get more customers to pay an additional $10/month. I'm sure the $350 price will drop a lot, fast - but the main thing is to get more subscribers paying more, and that will still happen
I think it's better as a primary phone if you just need something light that is able to run all the mainstream apps. Not everyone needs a huge phone and right now this seems like an awesome option.
i want this sooo bad
The more I think about it the less sense it makes. Maybe if it was geared towards kids or older people. Why wouldn't I want to use my full sized full feature phone? It really isn't that much bigger or bulkier.
I'd gladly use it as my main phone. I always carry a tablet anyway, so my big phone is for the most part redundant.
hey can u plz give it to me if u don't need that plzzzzzzz???? That's Amazing??
Can we play PUBG on this phone?
I have a s9 plus and s6 which looks tiny comparing to s9 +....
I would love to see an iPhone SE 2... same size as the old one with an iPhone X styled Screen and improved camera. This would be the perfect size and phone for many people...
3:54 “You can obviously move stuff around” fails to move icon then segways into whatever the long press actually triggers ???????
Wouldn't be such an bad idea if it wasn't for a) monthly 10$ b) verizon lockin c) 350$ . A person can just say screw it and goto att or gsm provider and just swap sims on their phones.
If you need a tiny little phone to accompany your "big" phone then you have literally bought the wrong phone.
Bring back the Graffiti input to call itself Palm. May be suitable for its tiny screen!
I would "main" that
I'd love to have this launcher
?? ... ???????
wtffff is this
The question is "why?"
i cant believe how stupid this is
Really pissed off that there are no options for people who like smaller compact android smartphones instead of huge tablets in the name of phones... i mean why cant any brand amongst hundreds of dem dint release any 4'7" to 5" smartphones?? jus dont undrstand... Its clearly evident from this video that not evryone likes phablets as it is...! why not leave an option and u know let uuuus, the customers choose which ones to buy rather dan monopolising the android market as such???!
Obviously needs a second generation. For $10 a month, it is really not worth it for almost anyone. I think it would be cool to see something like this totally 100% optimized for calls and messaging (not just SMS but also facebook and Whatsapp) as a minimal communication device.
This is the reason I use a 4.7” iPhone instead of the big ones. I use my phone for texting and responding to other types of messages and doing urgent things when I have no other devices around. It’s small, fits well in my pocket, and kind of discourages heavy use. I use an iPad or laptop for media consumption.
If they sell more than 1 of these, I would be really disappointed in humanity.
Wtf
$350 well, i would go an and buy an iphone SE
What should we do with such a device? It’s rather small! As you said.
where could be found
then the palm phone will become as big as a regular smartphone so they will release a palm palm phone for the palm phone of your phone .........
I miss small phone, but not this small, iPhone 5s is perfect size to me
What’s the point of this?
Does it support SD card?
Good idea but for that price, bad idea. If it was like £50 I'd buy it. At £350, no way, I can buy a cheap phone I don't care about for that price.
My first phone was Palm Treo 750
I love this thing
gimmick. china has such phones since 10 years
Those specs are way OTT. Should be virtually just phone and text and about 300 dollars cheaper.
It’s a good idea .. it looks very cute and if you want to get off your addiction of mobile
I can't see why or how this would be successful. It's like a big smart watch?? Except it's not a watch..... A watch is on your wrist.....this is just a small phone.... A small phone that's less capable of the phone that you already have. ???????
Palm has really gone downhill! I used to love my pink Palm Centro.
still a better display than pixel 3
There is immense scope for this product if they sold it unlocked and as a totally separate phone,would like to see this trend pick up and hopefully some other brands make it
Ridiculous haha
Just a smart watch in a small phone body
What's the point it's still an android phone. Why not just get a old sony Ericsson as a second phone?
This is a cool idea
can someone tell me why this mini phone needs 3gb ram same like an iphone X
I'll be down to have this as an unlocked device. I'd be down to put a $25 plan with 2GBs and unlimited everything else and just run it on the weekends. If work wonders for me if it was like that.
I mean. I would love to own a device this size again... That's right, phones used to be this size, and didn't require two hands. I want that back. I would say buy this as a second phone, but a main phone.
??????
that's already irrelevant in this generation.
Useless
I was expecting a non-smart phone which could provide longer battery life than your regular phone. I don't have this but I'm already sick of it.
This should have been a phone on its own for $100
Such a small phone
love the size
I'm definitely buying for traveling, I wouldn't want to get mi Pixel 2 XL stolen, I'll rather let the palm.
If you still want a smartphone that is small and efficient, Go for an iPhone SE, Its a shame Apple decided to drop it. There are tons of people out there who hate carrying huge phones.
Hahahaha...
Quiete expensive tho..??
This guy only review Google and apple products. The rest of junks gave to coworkers
When it is going to available in India???
Too bad you can't put a SIM card in it and use it by itself.
Cool concept, terrible execution.
Great phone, but too pricey.
Gonna Get this for my gf so she'll stop nosing thru my phone while I'm asleep.
looks like a beginners smart phone
Why?! The idea is silly imo...
Use the $10 a month to get insurance on your $1000 phone and enjoy your expensive phone
I still have my iPod touch
It only works with android but they had to copy the iPhone design. LOL
Bump the screen up to 4' and sell it for $200-$250, I would have been sold. But 350 for what is essentially a accessory device to use with my already expensive phone...... yeah no thanks. Sorry Palm, but you missed a very unique chance to become the leader of small yet efficient budget phones.
It's so cute
this looks awful
A bigger version of Apple Watch.
This is just idiotic. ?????
Can we place a call...???
i think if i wanted a different phone for this i'd go for maybe a used oneplus x or lg g6. both are cheaper. oneplus x is not as big as a standard 2018 flagship, not too small either. lg g6 looks modern and has good water resistance, and a good camera. you could download some apps to make these phones more distraction free. doing that and having your phone in your backpack while going out of the house should be enough, and you don't have to use verizon, do a connected device plan, or pay as much for any of it. the phone design is cute though
Life mode = flight mode
There is no reason to get a separate small phone
The most pointless gadget I've ever seen.
Nope
When this tiny phone is more powerful than your own phone.
I'd want a palm phone to accompany my tablet/laptop, not my phone.
Yeah better off buying a wearable
Gang Gang
Worst idea I have seen, good luck
Very cute. If it was stand-alone and $100 cheaper it would sell like hot cakes. The ultimate backpacking phone!
Who makes this? TCL?
I don't get the "get a smartwatch" argument of some of you. The use cases are different and as far as I remember, smartwatches are mostly meant to be used along with your phone (when you don't wanna take it out of your pocket) and they tend to be kinda expensive as well. Even of this Palm does poorly on the market for its pricing I can see new phones with a cheaper price doing the same thing in the future.
Fecking pointless
I've been thinking about having an iPod Classic sized phone for the last month or two. Where it's small, just use it as a phone, messages, maps/GPS and podcasts. That's really what I want and need. And something small like this might be perfect. Though battery life might be here and there when actually using it (podcasts and navigation would likely drain it well)
If it were usable on other carriers I would consider it. Palm is limiting this product by making it exclusive to Verizon Wireless. The pricing is high too.
If HP has anything to do w/ it then I don't want it
I actually want this phone to be a prank phone but omg it looks good. I might just get it if the price is right
An Apple Watch series 4 or even 3 would probably be better since this is for quick messages and music
Man, just use your normal phone less, why do you have to pay to use a phone less...
YES, PLEASE MORE SMALL SMARTPHONES!!!
You should change the title to the most pointless piece of technology ever.
It's funny to think that was the screen size of the first iPhone lol! We've come a long way in terms if screen real estate anyways.
I still want a Qwerty phone. :[
This phone is convoluted and pointless should have just kept Palm dead.
This is stupid. LMAO
Yo dawg I heard you like phones so I got you a phone you can use while you're not using your phone!
Uh- Verge? You folks have been posting a lot of flashy but incredibly stupid videos lately. Are you OK?
I wish they make more of these kinds of phone.
If you're going to spend $350 on a small phone so you don't have to carry your main phone around, this is just a pointless device. At $350, this will fail miserably.
Waste of time and money...Just get a smartwatch why would you need a worthless mini phone?
Apart from the fact that the pocophone starts at 300, this palm phone is useless IMO
If it was a phone on itself and if it had a headphone jack, I would have bought it. But not like this. This product will fail miserably.
For $350 you could buy the flagship killer itself PoCO F1 by Xiaomi and still have $50 bucks to spare . What a Ripp off !!!
It needs a bigger battery and an unlocked bootloader.
Hey look its smart watch its much bigger and expensive now ????
I would get it if it had physical buttons. There is no reason to get this otherwise.
Having to link this with an existing phone is what's going to ruin it. If it were a stand-alone device with slightly better specs, it would sell.
Low phone + high price ??
Haha, my smartphone is cheaper than this Palm phone. My sim plan is like $3 a month.
It's 3.3"! The Galaxy pocket was 2.8" and I never thought it was small back then
2:08 This phone is better than my phone (Motorola Moto E 4th Gen)
Palm phone because it's small, not because of the company. Why would I need a phone for a phone. Smartwatch is different in regards to it replacing something we already wear for added function. But if I have a phone, why would I carry a 2nd phone to tell me my 1st phone has a notification?? Doesn't make sense.....
Id use this as my daily. I dont use 90% of the features on my s9.
y tho
I really like this
Wow???????
Stupid idea
Im sorry, but thats complete garbage. 50 dollars would be appropriate.
Dead on arrival
My question is CAN THIS THING RUN POKEMON GO
shall I consider it as vintage or modern?.. ??
A shot for everytime you say "you know"
...but why? I wish you'd addressed WHY they made this. What market they're targeting. Emerging markets?
This phone is smaller than the notch on iPhone x lol
This looks cute, but lbr, this is the 2018 version of the Microsoft Kiln.
will it play pubg?????
Lmfaooo Android done took the straps off a smart watch made the screen bigger and put it on the market lol what is going in the world right now???
Imagine playing pubg mobile on that screen
Is this a joke? A phone for my phone...
so basically a bigger apple watch
Give me a holster to make it a watch and I will be interested
It's one of the dumbest ideas I've ever seen.
WHY
Walmart prepaid, boost Mobile, trap phone, $50 tops!
1:22 I love doing boy stuff.
I love this product??.Can anyone tell me how can i buy that?
The smarter move would be to bring a slightly bigger palm pre with the same specs as a s8+ and color option. For 450 and bam sold out
Who the hell color graded your video ? Its terrible
Weekender phone? Oh shut up
make it the main phone and we are talking something good.
trash, just get s9
Why can't I just have a phone that size? It was possible in the 90's...
I'm glad I still have my iPhone SE from 2016 running iOS 12 perfectly fine. 4" is a really nice size for a smartphone if you're not into watching a lot of stuff and gaming. Make small phones great again, plz!
But Why ?
So we can play PUBG in it
Does it launched in India??
I’d rather just get an Apple or Android watch that’s basically what this is minus the straps and extra bezel space.
@verge how to get this palm phone
looks cool, that's palm for you ...??
This is idiotic.
Palm companion phone, kind of is a extention ( with screen n camera etc) of Sony BT headset, which could be used as a handset too (SBH54).
I loved webos. Thanks for making precentral. I used that site quite a bit.
I would want it standalone as my main phone, I have a lte tablet for everything else
Samsung j6+ comes out with sd425 This tiny phone has sd 435 Shame shame samsung ????????
I wasn't expecting it would hve SND 435 as its CPU. It's a proper smartphone in a small form factor! But yeah the price and the fact that it's Verizon exclusive are the major turn off.
Instead...go for iPhone 5s
350$ for this little kid? What's special in this!?
Needs to be under $100 with a decent camera. People with large phones that want to go out for the evening or to a shady area could get use from this. At $350 a smart watch with LTE is a better option. Ex. Travel to a festival or another country for carnival. You want to have a cheaper phone that can more easily be hidden. Ex. Going out at night with slim fit clothes. You only need to text a little, make a rare call, Uber or Lyft, use a map program. If you loose a $50 phone it’s not so bad. Ex. You’re distracted by your smartphones plethora of apps. Semi-disconnect some days to focus.
i think its a good phone for a childrens
From which store did u get this phone from??
It does less than a smart watch because it doesn't have a heart rate monitor for fitness. For that price just get a smart watch.
Wow
A phone for your phone 2018
Who cares about this device? If you need a small display phone, either buy Nokia 3315 or Nokia banana phone.
The way he's trying to talk to viewers about this product is like somebody selling a bridge from The Onion, if they had a satirical ad space.
what about going back to wired ones. this phone business is getting out of hand
Apple watch even better that this phone
I'd buy this in luxury true gold finish
My prediction: It'll stop production within a year.
This is the dumbest idea I've seen in months
OMG small phones again YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and this is why the NOKIA 3310 is victorious! face palm*
This is the dumbest thing ever...Plus it doesn't even have WebOs that us Palm users used to love
So... its just a small phone?
This is so sad. Alexa, GET Off THE PHONE!!
At that price might as well get a smart watch
long live palm
Just a wierd attempt at a modern day iPod nano.
Lmao!!!! Is this really a thing? How stoned were the people who thought to do this?
A phone for a phone? L.O.L ????
The little beast
I’ve been looking for a concept like this for ages
I rather just use an Apple Watch or buy an iPhone SE as my second phone.
What is this.. A phone for ants ?!!!
What a stupid device
Where to buy
would make great little burner phones, but not at the 350 price point..Also would be nice little phone for you Tweens, when you don't want them to have something elaborate.
So it's a big smartwatch (like an Apple Watch LTE) with a camera that you have to put in your pocket.
Why can't they use their brains to make something mankind actually needs. Everything they come up with is just to make money.
Where can I get the palm phone????
I like the concept. The price is going to kill it though, too high. Also, make it with the option of either having it mirror your number from your existing "too big to be a phone phone" or actually just have it be a standalone small smartphone. I personally love the idea of having a well thought out small phone that can run modern apps.
Can I just get that launcher. Would look cool on a big phone I think
Flop and redundant idea which will fail miserably ??
For $350 just get a Pocophone F1 also holy damn it still has more RAM than most phones
Is this guy available in India??
It is very beautiful though, i could use this next to an iPad or even laptop as a standalone phone
hmm i think i'll make a car that fits in your car when you dont want to drive your car but it's much smaller like a clown car and sell it for 50 grand. Makes sense after watching this.
Great idea, just wayy too overpriced, should be like $90
Why do they even bother trying to make these stupid stuff?
Seriously? Might as well bring back flip phones while you're at it
Am I the only one who want to have this phone?
Recoveryourlife! An intelligent phone never never could steal your life, is smaller than people think! This PALM is perfect.
Let us make our fine bigger, even more bigger so we can have amazing experience on fone. Oh no! Our fone is too big. Let us make a smaller done that connects to your big fone. ????
So it's a smartwatch?
“navigate to the nearest Starbucks”
Why wouldn’t you just buy a smaller size smart phone. Keeping 2 phones isn’t the answer.
phoneception
Why would you even want this at that price when you can just get a smart watch that is smaller and is easier to carry!
Just LOL
Phone needed more battery capacity
Dual SIM Dual PHONE LOL
This is a joke.. right?
I think i like this
This is another perfect example of how stupid us humans are.
It's cute tho
Has better specs that my phone lol
Developers of the this phone working harder than hmd-Nokia
i rather buy an iphone se or a 5s
If you want a tiny back up phone or "weekender" buy a LG Sunrise
or you could get a smart watch
Where to buy it??????
You didn't gave the links????????????????????????????????
I'm minimalist thats smartphone enough for me btw smartphone seized our lives..It's a good chance to stop
Nice phone , can I purchase it
is there any competitor to this phone? im kinda interested in this form factor
This will fall harder than the Steam Machines... I dare you to deny it
Waiting for its upcoming models to become bigger and bigger and then watching them launch a small-smaller phone for the assistant phone of your main phone..
But..... why?
It says PLAM on the back, who's PLAM???
So people are really going to spend 300+ on this plus 10 dollars a month for this nonsense lol.
My phone has been asking me for a phone! This is perfect!
It is designed to be abolished !??
Id use it as a standalone for sure, but the premise they're selling us is absolute bullshit.
Seems too small for watching YT... ??
Where we can buy this ?
Cute Phone??
Fixing a problem that never existed, donate those 10 bucks
Love it
This just made me laugh , well you all know why.
It somehow has more ram and a higher processing power than my current phone
This what the iphone x se should look like lmao
Big smart watch it is :D
i prefer nokia 3310
How can I get this in India ?
why not make a 4"- 4.5" high-end android smartphone ? 120mm in length smartphone is "easytocarry" enough
Haha nice JOKE
OMG!!! Cool!! I want ??????
The funny thing is. If I buy that tiny phone, it would be better than my bigger one.
The makers of this have not heard of smart watches?!
I’m gonna start investing my money towards leaving this planet. I don’t know where we are heading but all seems pointless from here on.
$350 lmao, my nice 5.5" SD 650 Redmi Note 3 has been chugging along for 3 years at $200, can even play heavy games like PUBG decently. What a joke of a phone. Shouldn't be a dollar over $100, and that's being generous.
I really like it but I just can't think of a use case for me
IPOD IN DISGUISE
New additional failure to Palm
I dont trust the verge anymore
Nice design. I would be interested in using it as my daily driver, not as an accessory, because I don't want a large Phablet (I use the now discontinued iPhone SE). In a phone I would like - a phone (and messenger, e.g. Threema, no other social media) - a good music player - a very good camera - internet communication for directions and transport I don't need anything else. I really would like an iPhone SE with a full, bezelless screen and no home button.
Tweezers
Thailand pleassssse i waiting for you baby
I really would like some programmable buttons on the sides. on any smartphone.
It's VERIZON?! jeez no thanks
Wtf
Soooo it's androids dumber version of an Apple Watch ???
Or you can buy the iPhone SE.
Does it have to share your phone number? If not it could be good for teens
why they dint use notch?
I want thissss
I thought it was a cute phone that I'd consider for my daughter until you said it was $350. I wouldn't pay no more than $200
This would make so much more sense marketed as just a regular phone. This "second smaller phone" thing is just... silly. But there are definitely people who might consider downsizing and using this as their only phone.
Good comedy material
I recommend the Unihertz Jelly Pro, which is cheaper and also very tiny.
What about headphone jack????? I would love to have music on this
if it was proper phone i would have bought it.
Price is too high they could just go with 1gb ram 4gb rom to cut out some money around 30-50€
I miss my Palm devices still, and my Windows phones. Not sure this gimmick is worth it though.
Stupid idea. You are better off with an LTE smart watch if you want to leave your phone at home.
Review
It's just a bigger smart watch
If you didn't use a Palm Pilot, you're not the Palm guy. ??
Looks good
.....and I want one!
The phone for when your PDA needs a PDA, that's so Elitist. You can't see it but I'm smiling here. You can't "blame" Apple but, this is so Apple. Create a problem and charge addition to solve it. My big phone consumes too much so I buy a little phone for a companion. Reverse tablet. If you've got that type of money there are kids in schools that can use a workable tablet for schoolwork, just saying. My pet needs a pet. I'm laughing with you not at you.
2018 has been a sad year for phones
I want it!!!
This is one of those ideas alright
Its cool but i make it bezelless and im sold
Useless phone of the year...
What the .....?
Why not just get a simple phone, so you don't have to buy a expensive phone to then get a simple phone?
Just get Apple Watch. Does the same and more
Superb ????????
3gb ram?!
Honestly, this is garbage. I would just buy one of the new Nokias instead. Much more responsive for what they need to do due to the lack of cruft that takes up power, bigger batteries, and the physical keypad is better for typing if you have very little room.
Hey buddy Give me away this phone I am poor ?? I have no money for buy that phone
Way too many custom controls. I don't want to learn an entire new way of controlling my phone when I would be using it for the occasional use.
Hahaha is this an April fool's joke?? What's the point of this haha
just buy a smaller screen sized phone.
A phone for people who hate phones !
Palm best feature was WEBos I stll Have 3 Palm pre’s lol
...So, it's a phone for when you don't want to use your phone?
What is the point of this??????
Its really cool. Its like a full function smart watch. Amazing thing for an outdoor workout or when you go to a bar and don’t want to lose your main phone.
It's BS..it serve more purpose than it is supposed to be...and it cost more money than it should be.
At this point much better XZ2 Compact
But... Why?
Really thought that on Thumbnail it is Small iPhone
That phone's actually better than the one I have right now.... sniff sniff
just 3 question 1 will there be a GSM version 2 Can it work as a stand alone phone 3 how long does the battery last 4 who much would it cost as a standalone that four questions
Bro I want thi mobile , plz this is my dream phone ?
I dont like the concept of this product as it seems excessive, but im glad Palm is back
it's a phone for your phone....that makes sense
Useless until Apple comes along next year calling it "the revolutionary iThing". I seriously don't see the process in which they thought of this thing. Was it like "how do we make people believe that they have a problem that doesn't exist"? It really doesn't make any sense and I REALLY hope this doesn't become a thing.
Waste of money
phone for child.
Pointless.
Can we play pubg on it
Can we play pubg on it
I KINDA WANT IT for running n backup phones and stuff its pretty cute too
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww throw it in fire plz
I would want that as my main phone, but i think the mediocre camera kills it
That's small, but I can see it's fast, ??...
Let me have it
iPhone Xs mini?
Seems like a good festival phone to me. Too bad you can't just buy one.
It's better my phone, spec-wise Like, what
2:22 - TFW that's all you do on your phone anyways.
It's so cute it's for people who has a weakness for cute things
I will stick to my iPhone SE any day.
from where would i buy this phone.. and the price
Sounds about right for shithole countries like mine where getting your phone stolen is extremely common. You give them this tiny thing and hope they don't kill you
I want this phone
Lol this seems pointless. If u dnt want big phone just buy a smaller one in the first place.
2019-i want small phone cuz my phone became a tablet
Get a galaxy watch
if it was a standalone phone it'd be great for loads of people
I like the idea. But even if I had Verizon, no regular sms messaging is a deal breaker. BTW - I also lament the failure of WebOS and for that matter BB10. To this day, I still sometimes swap my sim card over to my BB Classic.
Yeah this phone is trash
What the heck is this sheet?
So a not smart SmartWatch XXL? It's like using a Kettcar when I don't want to use my big car!
You lost me at Android phone. Even tho I have one now (Oneplus 6), it'll be my last. No more smartphones for me. I'm over it all.
I mean, this costs as much as a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro(if not more) and the Xiaomi does everything you'd expect from a phone, and more(considering the price).
Why it isnt priced accordingly to its specs.
This is honestly the most pointless piece of tech I've EVER seen. Rediculous.
Srsly?
what a iphone / ? watch mock up.. damn.
It would be better if this device runs android go.
That's just silly. For less than the price of that you can get an iPhone SE. You can ignore that one, too. But you get better battery life, a reasonably sized screen, a stronger chipset and probably a better camera plus more software updates. Got one and I like it. Why on earth would you buy that thing, for the IP68 rating?
I wish it was bigger!
Phone is very good if price is less than 67$ or 5000?. I liked small screen size and pocket friendly phones but this cost too much. For that price i would like to buy Xiaomi Poco f1 powered by snapdragon 845 with 6gb/64GB Variant @ 285$
Lol everybody hating on this but when Apple makes the SE then they say that's so good
???
It's a good device IF IT IS A PHONE! What's point of having a separate phone to not use your phone?
Can i play pubg on this? ??
Aw man i wish I could buy it for $100. It would be the perfect digital, wall mounted switch for a smart home. With the google assistant on it and support for android apps, just need an elegant way to charge it and mount it and this would be so dope!
It's a money grab from Verizon, it's useless.
so its just a big smartwatch?
Yea buy a smaller phone for your big phone... WTF.
They lost me at $10 extra/month
the screen should be bezeless, n the cam like find x
Another way to make money, pathetic. Just make smaller flagship phones.
Love the looks and the size, Trying to find a new modern upgrade that doesn't go over 5" is a knightmare, Now if only it had a better battery life.
Huge RIPOFF of the original PalmOS and WebOS ffs
A phone to use your phone. I have lost faith in humanity.
4:55 you are wrong, my smart watch can run any android app too. It's got google play store.
Why not just use a wearable
This is my dream. I love tiny phones. I use a tablet otherwise for everything else.
ausam amazing gadget i wana buy but not available in Pakistan i try online buying web but none are offering it so hope soon it will come to Pakistan then ill buy it, its a smart phone batter then iphone x
isn't that why they created the watch?
You can always buy a small cheap phone and save hundreds of dollars LoL.
Just make an actual phone please
buy a small phone jeeezus
It’s trying to be an Apple Watch with LTE but it can’t compete.
It would be better if it was a 4 inch bezeless phone..
For 350$?? Very ueseless
This is nothing new /: and it has never cought on
I would have been satisfied if it could be used as a primary phone, You know for the needy people like me...
cool idea but come on man you really think anyone's gonna spend more than $150 for a phone that is meant to do less? you can get a lot of full sized phones for the same price.
what a stupid idea,.. so now we must buy a phone, if we dont want to use a phone.. LOL seriously people??
Its specs are better than my Samsung
This is nice i cant use bigger phone than 4.7 inch because of my disease i hope Samsung or another brand continue to produce small phones too.
Make small phones popular again
Life mode is Airplane mode with new icon and text
3.5" to 4" to 4.7" to 5" to 5.5" to 6" to 3.5" so on and so on common make up your mind manufacturers
Pointless, Useless
I mean WTF , First you spend 1000+ $ on a big phone like S9+ \ Pixel and then you buy a phone to cover it up just because u don’t want to carry the bigger phone .. Seriously if that’s the case why on the earth did I buy the first phone ? Palm you should name it as Facepalm ?????????????????????
Oh gosh, I don't normally comment but seriously!!!!!!!!??????!!!!!??????????!!!!!!????????????????????????? We buy 1000 dollar phones so we can get another tiny one, that is so much worse than the main phone????????????? Why?!?!?!?!?!?!???? I just can't even!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also the UI is so Apple watch... My gosh!!!!!!! I honestly don't know why I'm so outraged over sth so stupid but OMG seriously?!!???????!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!?!?!?!
I don't want second companion phone bcz of today's phones are too huge, I need 4.7-5.7 inches bezel-less phone.
This is perfect for when you're in a third world country where you're get easily robbed, then you can leave your main phone at a hotel and go around with this one.
I like the launcher, thats about ut
Dieter you look like Star Fox ??
Useless product But it would be better if it could be used on its own
Some making huge 6-7 inches phones and some making smaller 3-4 inches phones but no one making perfect size phones bcz of market selling strategy. I wanted 4.7 - to 5.7 inches completely bezel-less no chin phones.
Will it work with all carriers.
Why would I need one? I don’t ge it. I’d rather buy a cheaper nokia banana phone with LTE if I want a secondary phone.
I keep thinking- which is that watch he is wearing.
Stupid idea. Why buy and take a subscription for a mini phone, when you already bought a 800/1000 dollar phone. Like you buy the “big” phone because you like the looks, feels, software and now you have a second phone just to not use your main phone.... stupid idea as I said
It's cute..
Interesting but...................
But the point is.. can it run PUBG?
This should be the main primary phone and not secondary !
They market this as an extension/accessory of your phone but has a capability to completely disconnect from anything. So what’s the purpose of this garbage again?
Just get a smart watch
Who's gonna game on that?
Palm phone > Pixel 3
fail
better buy sony flagship compact models
Create a problem, sell a solution!!
I’m sure this is some money laundering behind this
Would be so handy to take to work but not available in the UK ??
i hold two phones, damn they should sell this , would be mine main driver ,can always hotspot to a bigger screen phone
I wish they'd bring back small phones. Would love to see an iPhone SE 2.
What s the launcher called???
I think this thing is great! That "Life" feature would literally work perfectly for my needs. If I wanna go biking or snowboarding I'm not gonna hear my phone go off while I'm concentrated on not crashing; may as well have my phone be "off" and not risk breaking a $1000 device. I want one
Actually this is a good concept for when your other phone is unreliable
Thanx but no i dont have money to spend
I would love to go back to a fully featured smart phone that was small like that. I also like the interface/launcher as well. Turns out, after spending hundreds of dollars on my phone, I only end up using text, email, instagram, sometimes map and occasional calling. Nearly everything else the phone can do, I don't use.
The smart watch is supposed to do all that.
Put your hand up if you want a bigger flagship version of this?
Great one
toy
Basically you can use this phone to cheat your exam ?? that's it
Do "boy" stuff lmaoooo
The palm centro was my favorite pre smart phone phone. <3 I had the raspberry color in the soft plastic version.?? I dont think I'd get this though. Lol...
Rather buy a iPhone SE and save couple dollars.
Pointless lol
It's a good phone.....but..way expensive. 350$ If the price is cut to half....then it may rock.
Where can i get this one
It's better than my phone
Since when are smartphones no longer mobile phones?
awesome! I hope small simple phones make a comeback!
It's basically is an android iPod
Why didnt you test it on a big screen??? What that would take 3 minutes extra? Smh
Finally, a phone that is the right size! I hoping it is 3.3" size! Should have Snapdragon 845 with 6GB RAM instead!
you can do boy stuff...
why not just carry your phone?
I love what you did with the volume 2:50 nice move you got a subscriber ??
Wow what a pointless concept ... weekender phone and leave my main phone at home ?
Total bullshit
Haha same processor and ram as the moto g6. Motorola you listening?
This might be good as a bicycle computer.
who thought this was a good idea
It would be cool as a stand alone
Has a smart phone become like a car now... where you have your daily driver, then a weekend car...
so it's basically a smart watch but bigger and can't be worn on wrist
Did anyone ever think he has a weird name when watching The series?
Yes..it would be worth $10 a month. I am an Iphone user and honestly I cant stand this big phone trend. The iphone 8 is the biggest I want to go..I really do not like putting that thing in my pocket. I did have the SE but sold it...I thought Apple was going to do an SE 3...I wish I kept it! I told my wife I was thinking about going back to a flip phone, just for the size and convenience, but realized I do to much on my phone. We both decided to upgrade to the Apple Watch 4 with cellular...just to not have to lug around our phones...but that wont happen until Christmas. But yes, I miss the smaller phones.
Dumbest idea ever.
Wait... what? ?? Welcome to 2018!
Sell it as standalone for no more than $100 and I'll buy it rn
Wonderful....Wow...Please do a giveaway
This guy says "you know" a lot.
Do you guys know any launcher like this? I kinda like that bubble app-drawer.
No Notch ? thats sed
this phone very nice.. hope they have the 5"" screen...
This is hilarious. Wow!
So what is it? A phone? A phone for your phone? Wannabe smart watch? Dual display for your phone? Lmao
This is stupid
iwatch interface
The camera needs to be good
How much? $150?
Did he say $350!!! you got be kidding me For what? must be stupid as hell to buy that thing and then spend $10 a month on top.. if you want to throw away your money like that hit me up @JGtechBlog youtube hasn't been payin well lately
I like it so much I want it
This might be the dumbest product I’ve ever seen... a phone for a phone? Stop and let that sink in... WTF!
When it will available in India
5:15 Hey guys buy this phone and you get to ignore it completely ??
If only you could slap it on your wrist...
Meaning flight mode ????
I sense it will probably flop. When people go away for a weekend, at least one feature they want from their smartphone, that I can think of right out the pocket, is the camera. Doubt people will give that up for a bit of space in their pocket. And not as compact/practical as a watch.
$350? Gtfoh with that noise.
Looks nice!
Verge to the moon!
a side phone. most pointless device ever invented
I cant wait to subscribe to see a non phone with phone pricing review
STOOPID
Could you play pubg mobile on it?
Pay more to use your phone less and avoid all the phone features your real phone has. I see a homerun
I'd rather HTC bring back the m7 form factor with updated specs, waterproof it, and make it bezelless.
Seems a little contradictory. Pay more money each month to use the primary device you paid so much money for less often.
This is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen IN MY LIFE!! AAAAHHHHH
but this is all I need
in 2010 this could be considered an android PHONE.
WHEN YOU WANT TO CATCH YOUR SPOUSE CREEPIN U ADD THIS PHONE TO THERE PHONE. THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE.
Love to see all the possible use case scenarios people can come up with for this.
ehhhhh, I think I'd rather go for one of the compact Sonys.
I like it!! if iphone they release palm phone i will buy!
WebOS was the best back in its day and very underrated! It always makes me smile when Dieter brings it up.
Nice launcher ! Apple watch like interface
I'd rather get a Pocophone F1 for $50 less
Starting 4:07PM with 64% and ending at 4:47PM with 47%...Not sure how long this phone is gonna last...17% drop in 40 mins is a massive battery deal. Skipping PALM - Better remain in shelves.
A second phone for your phone....I don't get it. I guess some people out there just have too much money!
Will be $50 in 6 months. No point being exclusive on Verizon. This would make an awesome tethering mobile hotspot for other devices as long as it's connected to a wireless charger.
Future iPhone
Why
All of my nope.
Plz tell the model no of this ph.
I like the idea, I'd be sold if the camera was high end and the battery lasted over two days.
This is 100% a doomed product.
they just had to have the vertical camera setup huh!
Cyberpunk 2077 looking real good
<3
"Life mode" really palm- android already have aeroplane mode
If this could be some remote/monitor systems for my main phone. It would be perfect
I thought smartwatches were a phone for your phone?, if people buy this they will essentially have 3 phones, their main phone, companion smart watch and secondary mini phone. People keep buying the same thing over and over again.
it's aim towards students. if you know you know??
Got a perfect sized Essential phone for 250. This is 350 to manage your monstrous 800-1000 dollar phone. No thanks Verizon,you're already doing a fantastic job of ripping people off.
This device will fail at that $350 price point... I look forward to seeing them for sold by the truckload for $50 on Ebay next summer.
while this is a little too small, i would hope this would be a baby step (heh) to smaller phones being an option again. i'm tired of big phones! we need options for flagship specs in iPhone 5 sized android devices, perfect for one handed use. or maybe i'm just getting old and every phone cramps my hand
I can’t believe these companies are trying to promote a product you should use less all while charging the same as some flagships lol.
You know,
Super bro
Scam
I dig the UI
Sounds good....... doesn't work
Like a kids' phone
Do you ever use your phone for gps in the car. But u want to text or browse Facebook while driving without interrupting gps. Palm phone
$350!? just get an iPhone se
Aw man the Palm Pre is my favorite phone of all time
This is a phone for people whom are looking to cheat on their partners to have private conversations. ??
When you’re such a rich conspicuous consumer that your phone has a phone.
Worst idea ever
Is this compatible with Fortnite Mobile?
I would totally use it as my music player device.
This would be a good snowboarding phone where I don't want to carry my bulky big phone with me and also don't want to risk catching an edge and breaking my $850 big phone
It looks a bit like the LG Arena KM900.
When one phone wasn't enough..... Such a poopoo idea!
Clearly made for prison use
I want one just to use it as a mp3 player
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones... so we gave your phone a phone so you can phone home when you’re away from your home phone
1:44 why do every time you make a video, you have to mention iphone? Do you really expect people to ask face id on their side phone? People who buy this phone already now what they getting.
My weekend phone Is my weekday phone Mindblown
Whatsapp? Sim card slot? Can it be used in other countries?
When they want it to be tiny little one then why they have so big bezels in top and bottom. They could have cut off those bezels to make it real tiny or given extra screen by going bezeless and having same size. Just a thought. About Palm, there are they? I love Palm and I miss it really much. They deserve to be back in the market and rule it. Haven't heard of them.
You didn't say one thing about how it plays sound. Is there a mini jack hole for earbuds? Does it do bluetooth to earbuds?
I'd get something like this for going out to shows or places I don't want to have to carry a purse. But I also would rather just throw in my Sim or have a real cheap pay as you go plan for it.
I want in iPhone this size!
Honestly? I've been using a Galaxy S4 and Palm Centro side by side for about a year now on T-Mobile. I know it sounds silly but I'd rather keep the Palm Centro on the ground as there's no point taking a phone skydiving.
So it’s not a competition to the iPhone but competitive to phones like the light phone and the seimpo
So... spending more money because you don't wanna use your high-end phone? Get a smaller phone then lol
for $450 you will get iPhone 7. $350 for this phone is a lot.
This is attractive to me as a device to bring on bike rides, hikes or runs. I can use it for Strava, navigation and for contacting people in case of emergency without bringing my big primary device. Maybe the camera is even okay enough for an Instagram story or two along the ride. That 800mah battery would be an issue/dealbreaker though since I can't just turn on life mode as I would like to have it connected to GPS.
I would so get this phone if it were stand alone, with a volume rocker and more battery and possibly a better processor but really that's an afterthought. I don't use half the features on my phone something less cumbersome would really be great
Hahahahhaa dumbest thing I've ever seen lol.. just why.. lol
Doesn't seem that practical. The appeal of smart watch is its small size and easily strap onto your arm. But again I won't invest in a smartwatch either.
Completely & utterly pointless.
I need that launcher, please someone give the link to download it
Not needed, can get a (cheat but decent) 4k tv for that price.
Does it have a headphone jack?
Why though?
This little thing is soooooooo cute !
It is better than one of those crowdfunding minimalist phones
you know its a waste of money you know
This phone is so "first world problems" haha
I need
This is beyond stupid. Face in Palm.
Completely stupid
If this ran AOSP and had a headphone jack, I would be extremely interested.
Why though?
This is stupid. So you buy another phone for your phone so you don’t have to take or use your main phone. What’s the point. You can’t use with iMessage and you need a app to get android text. I’m sry but this stupid they should have just brought back the palm pre I had that phone and thought it was a good for for the time. But this is just silly.
any NFC for Google pay? then I can leave my wallet as well?
@Stephencurry
The Verge OMEGALUL
It's a secondary phone with the specs of a flagship from 3 years ago. This should be sold for $100 off contract without Android, with a sixth as much ram and just enough heft for basic web browsing. Then I'd buy it
So its just a small phone without proper security. Why??
?????
Google should make an Android Watch like that! 1:58
So they're basically reintroducing an iPod touch for android now? Lol.
What the hell is a weekend phone?
What a stupid idea. Who would pay 350$ to avoid using their 1000$ phone? And it's doesn't even have volume buttons? What a waste
You can sell these as kid phones
Plam comming to India
How long until we see a big Apple Watch? I mean Invicta dive watch big.
stupiod
Does it come with a pager?
This phone is cool but direct calls & messages needs to be allowed without pairing
Dear God....they just want the extra $10 a month.
Fail
Forget weekender, this could become much popular as a weekday or all day phone.
Just why would anyone buy this?
Lost interest the moment you said Verizon
Why would I spend $1000 for a phone and then use this. On top of that pay another $350... I feel it’s cheaper to buy a car then a phone. ??
Garbage
Lol thought this was cute but at most $100
$350 + $120 a year for the shared number + $$$ for actual phone... no thank you. It would be cool if it had the features of a good bicycle computer (GPS, daylight visible screen, long battery life, waterproof) so I could take it on a bike ride and still have a phone, but it's not that.
There is a market for small phones. I know people stucked in phones from more than 3 years ago because the size. I think not that small but maybe between 4.5 or 5 inch bezel less phone it could be a thing for a lot of people. It's ridiculous how even 5 inch became "a small phone"
What if you just buy an iPhone 4s as a backup phone ?
1:21 1:22 you can do boys stuff? What's boys stuff? ?????? And also this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard
What the hell this thing has more ram and a better processor than my current phone
This thing will help make sure that Palm stays out of business.
Who in marketing and what manager gave this a thumbs up? Short timers.
Dear phone manufacturers, if you're reading: people want a decent iphone SE android alternative, ideally privacy-focused and bloatware-free as well. This Palm phone is just a crippled compromise but I applaud Palm for bringing back the small form factor.
Captain 2 phones here.. LG G7 ThinQ and iPhone SE ??
looks great. Palm may be on to something here
So COOOL. MOREEE WE NEEE MORE SMALL PHONES!!
I’d love this as a flip phone
I just want a phone that encourages me to use it less. One of these as a stand alone device would be great.
3GB RAM? Ohh just like the cute lil iPhoneX thing
I need that thing my phone got stole because I couldnt hide it bacause its too big now I can carry that phone without it being stole
This would be a really great phone for a kid. Just think abt it. The size, the simplified UI and functions. The price of course! U surely dont want to spend a fortune on a phone that a kid would probably end up breaking it.
lame $350 or $10/mo. I can get a Regular PrePay smart phone for that price as a back up. If you're realy into tiny phones then, no; still no
People who are saying this is a ripoff aren't taking into consideration that people who bought phones like note 9 are gonna buy this. Look I'm sorry your parents let you trap with pocophone but that's not everyone's situation.
So ridiculous
Wish it was a standalone phone for like $150
um... i thought that's what apple water is for...
What watch are you wearing?
So here is my take on it as an investor: If this was a product for doctors to communicate among themselves, or atheletes to communicate within their team or something along those lines. This would be a great product. But this is not for your average consumer. They have steph curry as an investor and to market this. This is how much athletes are not in touch with reality. They think people will buy their 150$ shoes therefore you will spend another 200 to "get away from your phone". Why dont I just go buy a used up iphone from craiglist? Why this? This is my issue with tv stars and atheletes promoting things to average consumer and ripping them off.
Useless, you can get a secondary phone for cheaper.
Nokia 3310 is best for a spare phone..
They overlooked one thing... When the weekend comes around that's when I go hard on my phone. Camera, navigation, videos, basically everything I need a fast phone for. Only time I would need something like this is maybe going to the beach. Shame they used Palms name on this.
So first gen iPhone running android. Got it. ???????
Im really confused. Whats the purpose?
An 800 mah battery.... God damn that's awful.
JUST DONT BUY A BIG PHONE
Is that a giant apple watch?
i can see this being used for a kid if you are a parent and dont want to spend money on something super expensive. And by kid I mean maybe like 11-12 years of age. But as a single person why would you need a smaller phone if you already have a smart phone thats most likely better. Idk what to think about the palm phone..
800maH battery; I'm not interested anymore
Pointless device. It will tank.
PALM DAD HAS RETURNED
It reminds me of a modern day pager.
Would be good for a child just for 10 bucks a month
3.3" thats just 0.2" less than the original ABSOLUTELY BARBARIC ORIGINAL IPHONE ! SO HUGE! (2008)
So a pet for my phone?
This is how Palm goes their comback....muhahaha
$350 = GARBAGE! $40-$60 = SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY...
I think the light phone 2 has a better concept, e-ink display on a smart phone could catch on.
A waste of space
Why not a 4.5" phone with specs like this and a bigger battery? The iPhone 5S and SE are the last of their kind of small flagship-grade smartphones with minimal compromises. I guess I'll just get an Xperia XA2.
A cool little device, killed at birth by its own marketing stupidity. A phone for a phone? This is everything that is wrong with modern smartphone users and the entire industry. I would totally use an unlocked version of something like that as a daily device, since most of the time I have a tablet or a laptop on me. If you need a phone for your phone, you probably need help, too.
It doesn’t have to cost thousands...
Shout out to someone to make something crazy out of this concept
A better way to use it would be 1 sim in your laptop and another in this. So phone calls and other stuff can be done in this, while productivity and media consumption can be done in laptop, which many people do anyway if they are in a situation to carry it around always.
“Weekender phone”??? This makes no sense. Why not just take your regular phone with you if want YouTube and other apps? This idea wasn’t thought out...
This would be good if it can coordinate with main phone via bluetooth, much like how smartwatch works, in case if we don't want connected numbers plan or some short. Like he said, this is kind of like a big smartwatch rather than a tiny phone.
$350 to downgrade to a worse phone? I’m good.
Well the iPhone SE just fits into my pockets. And I will keep looking for devices not bigger than that. But I just prefer the bitten fruit... ??
So apple watch?
Can it do Android Auto? I’d get it just to connect and hide it behind the dashboard.
It's useless, what's the problem with your "normal phone" being bigger, why would you waste 350$ for that, your actual phone would become useless too
Nice key chain. Lol
Stupid idea. Good luck startup from san francisco.
This is so frustrating, because I want a phone exactly like this. Standalone. I don't really want any of the latest phones. When I leave the apartment I want tools to get me places and contact people and that's it. I'm intrigued by light phone 2 but it's never gonna have a decent maps alternative.
If it was $100 it'd be good for running or riding a bike. That's about it.
Can you please put this out without a plan and unlocked...
3.3" is only .2" smaller than the iPhone 4S
play pubg on it
If the screen was completely bezelless it might have been a neat little replacement for the iPhone SE. As it is this looks more like a novelty toy then anything else.
Anyway to get that launcher? I kind of like it.
Is this a new company that is launching the palm brand or is it HP That's doing this? Cause I remember HP was the last known owner of the palm brand
it's the next ipod, but android edition
sick this thing has a newer android version than my G7 thinq
So it's a $350 iPhone 4?
who even needs 3gb of ram on that tiny phone?
This is what I’ve always wanted for cycling! Just need a tiny light phone that can make emergency calls and WhatsApp msg’s.
I need to pee
Better design than most phones.
that would be a dream if Apple brought it out ??
Lmao palm alive again
That’s... the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.
This would have been great if it was cheaper Because the only way I see myself using a phone like this is if I’m going somewhere not safe and I’m afraid to get mugged or something If you still don’t know what I’m trying to say Imagine that your are traveling to a country/state that isn’t as safe as your country/state You will obviously take your main phone with you but when you get there and you want to go out and you don’t want to risk taking your main phone with you but you still need a phone for communication and basic stuff Then a phone like this is great but that’s only if it was cheaper
so it's an Android wear (watch) phone.
You know, you got a xz2 compact with snapdragon 845, 64gb rom, 4gb rom...a relatively compact phone with 2018 flagship specs, for almost the same price, if you want a compact phone.
So this is an Apple Watch for android users
$350? Haha hahaha
It should be able to run pubg mobile lol
Wait what... 3gb ram for a "weekend phone"? My main phone has 3gb ram
Thumbs up if you would buy one of these (if it could actually be a real smartphone that just worked)
Now imagine that.......on a watch
Where can you buy it?
God damn it this is already a failure.
My last palm phone was a treo 650 back in 2004/5 so thanks for remind me those great palm phones and pdas , great times
Just make a normal sized phone which is not giant, like 4.4 inches with a decent camera!
The only good thing about that phone is the launcher.
Small phones are awesome.
This would be a great idea if it was cheaper and less feature packed. I mean, the only reason for this would be to be your "thieves phone". Leave your big, expensive phone home when going out walking and take your tiny with basic features phones for calls and maybe check emails sometimes etc. But it has too many things in. Even 3gb of ram is too much for this purpose.
Good phone for little kids? 25$ extra a month? Sounds like it to me
A phone for a phone? This is one of the stupidest ideas I've ever seen??
So why does it have the itunes app downloaded? Thats apple only
You don't want to carry around your computer, get a laptop. You don't want to carry around your laptop, get a tablet. You don't want to carry around your tablet, get large screen phone. You don't want to carry around your large screen phone... Get this one.
Palm? It says PA lM It’s different
It reminds me of an Archos 29 3" tablet but that was a tenth the price
I WANT THE LAUNCHER ON MY NORMAL PHONE
Hardware - iPhone X knock off, software UI - Apple Watch knock off, great
The pocophone is $300
So this a device that's between my phone and my smartwatch? Ugh.
???? WTF!
I get the case for this phone. Because it's what I like with iPhone5S. It is small and feels comfortable on my hands.
If you came here to know about it's battery, it's 800m.Yes, delete your life's 5 min and go somewhere else.
Pretty pointless imo ??
More like of a pimp phone rather than your backup smart phone.
So it's an oversized smartwatch? :-/
Is not for me..
I can already see the failure of this so called phone. Without sim and high price tag who will want a second phone.
It is not secured as Face ID on the iPhone.. Correct!
Watching this makes me wonder the notch of pixel 3 XL.
If this were a $100 budget phone I could use with any carrier, sure. But they had to kneecap it.
Or you could just buy a high end android smartwatch with lte connectivity that has built in mic and speakers.
maybe its a smart battery pack for when your phone dies...you can just turn this on as a backup
Sounded like his name was ??eter ??one
I would lose that thing in a few days.
When you are a brand like The Verge and you can't even transfer a picture to a big screen to see if it is a good camera. Shame on you!
This made me want a revamped iPhone SE
Stop telling me that I know; I don't, which is why I'm here! Ya know? :p
Basically a iPhone 5s lol
I really like this phone I think it will be good for older people that don’t want to pay to much but just want to keep in touch with family and friends
so its DLC...
Its more powerful hran my nokia 6
Damn was he depressed in his review
Lame Idea. This is just an attempt to grab more money from customers.
This is going to be a mistake. The display size should've been 4-4.5 inches. It makes no sense that it's a carrier exclusive and has to be connected to a main device for the price.
This is bullshit
Pretty useless
What a useless POS
What is the Lauschers Name? I like the Style .
I dont need my phone to have more friends than me.
What a waste of money and natural resources.. ???????
want a tiny phone? buy yourself a SONY XPERIA RAY for 50$ ^_^
Small screen, but turns off cellular easily. So no good for calling kids or grandparents who you are likely to give this phone to. Have to buy with a plan. So no good as a backup phone. Did i hear that right 800mAh battery. You really have to switch it off.
It would be so cool to have a phone this size, but bezel-less
New business model: If you can't make a good phone, don't!
No. You should see my charging table now.
Assuming media apps aren't too cramped on that screen, I'd probably be using it as a remote control for Chromecast more than anything else
I get it because it fits in the Palm of your hand...
All good until "Verizon exclusive" and "$350." Unlocked and below $200, I'm all over it.
It's cute
Sigh, I remember old days of me sitting on the bus, my pre, and web os. Swiping from card to card. Also the honey comb styling reminds me of the apple watch
Verizon getting greedy, bad enough it's a exclusive and it's $350, but having to pay $10 a month is a deal breaker. Making a phone is exclusive is a bad idea especially if your phone ain't that good.
This is a great idea....at $100. It's a total non-starter at $350.
This would actually be perfect for me since I cycle often and id like to have a phone vs a computer to be able to get GPS or calls.
ios has this kinda thing going on for years. it's called iphone se.
?? ??? ????? ????? ,????????? ??????????, ??? ??????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?? 50 ???????,?????? ?? ?????.............
The AppleWatch for android... just bigger... and without bands... and less features... Still the best Android AppleWatch competitor
I never clicked a video so fast before like this!
This is it bois, we have come full circle.
Does it have Bluetooth?
Basically.... it’s a phone....
A parasitic phone. Stupid
"you're going to have to use Verizon's..." You can stop right there. I hate it.
If this is for 60 dollars then it's fine
Imagine playing PUBG on it..lol
But why ?
Why???
"life mode" basicly just airplane mode?
This says a whole lot on the state of Android wear watches that this thing is a market viable product. Ridiculous.
It's better to add extra $350 to you budget and buy a extra premium smartphone.??
Paaaaaaalm!! I miss webOS ??
Will be on sale within 6 months....
Stephen Curry brought me here.
I'm using an iPhone SE to go along with my big android.
For people that hate phones... and mostly want to use their computer.. It's actually great. Whatsapp, SMS and Phone and the rest on a real computer.. Why not?
What’s the point?
No it's not
Stop saying you know
Why? Just use your phone or the smart watch you probably already have
10 years too late.
I would buy it if it was sold separately and for a bit less.
Dislike to the phone in 2018... Like to your video
So palm /life mode is airplane mode.
If this cost $50 and I didn't have to pay $10 every month, then maybe I would consider buying at as a phone to use at home, to avoid work related distractions, but for $350 I can just get another fully functioning phone.
You really have to appreciate the effort they put into the custom Android skin. Its designed to do exactly what they set out and seems very intuitive. Not sure I'd want to use it myself but I kind of love it as a device.
U know.....U know...U know
So basically an Apple Watch being a smartphone, if that makes any sense.
Soon people will have a phone for a phone for a phone for a phone.or a smart watch for a smart watch
Modern smartphones have become so big we now need a second, small smartphone ???????
Stick a strap on it and market it as an oversized smartwatch, and it might have a market. I knew someone who did this once with a smallish smartphone. He was a geek, of course, and didn't care much for style. But there's your market, if there is one at all.
Either get a smartwatch or just buy an iphone se. Buying an iphone se also gives an andriod user the experience of iphone for a low cost and since it's small, it's not bothersome. Win=win
Again the verge not knowing what they are doing. Just stop doing tech, leave it to the professionals
Ughh really that's not a palm phone just because it has the palm name on a piece of plastic don't make it a palm just like blackberry using Android
Sd 435 3gbRam 32Rom. Pretty much sounds like Samsung's mid range devices.
If it was standalone, camera was better and bezelless, i'd be sold. They can minimise the functionality alot more.
Damn! I wish I could get this unlocked on T-Mobile.
But can it run crysis? ??
Thats good for toddlers
I bought a phone for my phone now I need a phone for my phone phone? any ideas?
I’d be surprised seeing this take off.
What a stupid idea. Why would anyone but this
This is a best! 3G ram!?! My phone is only 2 and it's big phone!
As a primary phone it would make more sense!
Does this phone laugh in India ???????
Cute. The Palm too.
This is cool.
Perfect for my 2 year old ??
Useless
Don't really see the use of this and they are making the same mistake again partnering so heavily with a telco nevermind
What’s the point of this phone? I can just use my regular phone. With that price point I could get another regular phone that’s much more powerful than this phone. So it basically boils down to a novelty item. It’s pointless especially with smart watches being the much smaller portable phones.
so basically what my apple watch does with out all the health stuff on top of it and an extra thing to carry? i dont get who the audience is for 350
Deiter Bohn reminds me of Andrew Ilnyckyj from buzzfeed
I rather have a burn phone than this pos.
This is stupid
2:07 You know when you need a new phone when your current phone has less ram and internal storage than this tiny thing ??
How the heck do u come up with an idea to use a phone that needs to connect to another phone. This is nuts!!
I might be use that for going to the gym (if I can use it without a contract?)
What were they thinking ? ... More ways to waste cash
If sharing a number with a second phone isn't exclusive to this phone why not just buy a cheap Verizon prepaid phone and share your number with that... save yourself about $300.
The Ui looks slick but can’t you just buy one of those tiny android phones and swap your SIM card
Love that idea soooooo much!!!!!!!
Apple Watch Please.
As he was using it it was LAG Central...This is going to die faster than the dinosaurs did.
if only this thing cheap, it can be an alternative music player
In Russia we usually say - Eto pizdez!
can Google pls make a step down model from the pixel with the same camera but Al lower tier snapdragon and a 4 inch screen.
is there a phone without anything on it
but why?
Feels like this is supposed to compete with Apple Watch. ??
is there a phone without anything on it
Really, a second phone - not thanks. I am not even into smart watches.
Life mode? You mean airplane mode ???
What was that sidekick device for either HTC or Moto... where you clip it on and it unlocks your phone when you slide your phone out of your pocket? This reminds me of that level of usefulness.
Have you tried webos20090606 yet?
I can buy a poco F1 for around $285!!
they should have used at least 1500mah battery......
For when the computer in your pocket is too big…
Don't understand who this is for.
i appreciate the intent, but if you want to minimize cell-phone usage, why not create an android/iPhone flagship in the form of the deceased iPhone 5/SE to be used as a primary device...? ??
sick people, sick idea. Nothing else.
Cell phones are such a racket, I am ready to go back to a basic flip phone, at first glance I thought that is what is was
Why the hell can't it just be your main phone? Having two phones with the same number is for hipster yuppies with more money than sense lol. "Weekender phone" gimme a break
iWatch size
Would have been great if it was unlocked and standalone, SMH It's has so much potential and yes it's such a waste of money.
If you want a smaller phone the Apple iPhone SE is a full function phone at half the cost of this, I don't see a market for this at that price
So basically a drinking phone :D
This was the form factor we needed, not those TV’s disguised as phones. The huge price is a huge turnoff though.
My smartwatch runs normal Android and it costs a fraction of that thing... Also, what's wrong with calling it airplane mode?
This would be a more preferable alternative to Apple Watch for a smart phone. It's a very good idea and I would really love to see more similar products perhaps from different producers as well.
This thing would sell a lot more if it was just a normal phone instead of an accessory.
I was interested about it. And then I heard 350... Why not Nokia 1
A weekend phone with a poor camera? dont think anybody would use it like that. If this was something you could buy as a stand alone item would be a great kids first phone, its small and just enough. otherwise I just don't see the apeal in things like this =\
Is this what the phone industry has gotten to? I'm sorry, AM I THE CRAZY ONE HERE?! Welcome to 2018 folks. You buy a phone for a phone.
So let me get this straight, the proposition is to spend 10 dollars a month so I don't have to use the phone they want me to spend 800-1000 dollars on?
But why. Who would want this?
This would make an excellent little audio player if it had a headphone jack and a decent dac.
I love it but not the price tag for it. I can use it like a holiday phone whilst leaving my main at hotel.
It's cute I want one
this phone + pixel 3 camera + Snapdragon 660 + 4gb ram + oled ??
Nah.
That thing lags! Just buy discounted flagship or midrange of the last year for $300 and you sorted.
A giant Smartwatch without straps
The market for this seems smaller than the phone itself. Unless mainstream smartphones are too big for you to be able to carry, this tiny phone seems pointless.
Actually snapdragon 435 is very powerful for such a small device which would be used as secondary device !!! Only problem that battery should have been at least 1500 mah !!
Why not just use a smart watch with cellular?
It has more RAM than my everyday 3 years old tablet :)
OR you can find a much better spec'd (but still just as small) iPhone SE on Swappa for a fraction of the price. ??
Can we have just 1 fking medium size phone instead of a small phone with a big phone Make a phone with 5 inch display , with thin bezels or 4.5 inch with thick bezels instead of this stupid thing
it costs more than the pocophone f1
no thx
pointless... it's like having 2 finger print sensor on the same side of a unit..
$100 is the max price this phone deserves.
Basically just DLC for a phone
I want it.
Hopefully it has a Phillips-head screwdriver
Phoneception
That's definitely not what I was thinking.
Good grief. If you must have a weekender, get a cheap android phone,swap out the sim. Turn on airplane mode to save battery and control incomings. This just seems like another piece of kit that's going to end up in the back of your drawer in 6 months.
why did anyone think this would be a good idea? weekender phone? people use their phone more on the weekend than on weekday. and now I have to remember to charge another device? heck no. All this is, is a Palm phone with android OS.
$350?? I'm ready for $99
I think an apple watch would be a better buy, compared to this palm mobile as it has some health oriented features ( not available in my phone) and the rest of the thing's done by this palm phone can already be done by my phone, and iam not that lazy, to not to carry my phone with me. Just my thoughts about this product is its unnecessary ( its the same thoughts that i had for apple watch series 0, but i think even series 0 is more justifiable as on the fact that its a watch and not a mobile phone )
iPhone 2G + iPhone X + Apple Watch = Palm Phone.. ?? ?? ??
Nice joke. It's a joke and only a joke.
i will buy make it cheaper 125-130 dollars or something
Lol I like how its supposed to be a tiny phone so you can use it with one hand and he still uses it with 2 hands like its a 6 inch phone
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. "Weekender phone". HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Yeah... This is just plain bullshit.
Buy an iphone 5s, hahah
So people buy bigger phones because that’s the thing now a days! Bigger better? But they make this little phone to go alongside your big phone because in case you don’t want to take your bigger phone with you? ?? Just remembered a song from back in the day! “ Milk the cow” the best way we know how! Smh ?????
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones, so we made a phone, for your phone, to help you cut down on your phone use!
I used to used Palm phones. They were great. They sure have fallen and this is a stupid idea.
3.3' and we call it funny. iPhone used to be 3.5'
1:22 "and you can do boy stuff"
2:25 tiny midget phone has no headphone jack. So how do I listen to music then. You said I could listen to music. Even the Obama TracFone has a headphone jack
But can it run pubg
But what if I want to leave the smaller phone home? Do I get an even smaller phone? What if I want to leave that one too? Lmao
Get a cheap Nokia
No just no
I'm searching 5 inch screen phone but not a single company making it now a days don't know why
People gonna start complaining the screen isn’t big enough.
xhibit: We gave you a phone with your phone so you can have another phone??
Replaces the tiny useless Apple Watch
Waste of time...
This reminds me of my HTC Aria from like 2010 or whatever
The tiny phone has better specs tham my curremt phone lol
I guess android people could use this but as a iPhone user... No thanks, just use a Apple Watch instead. It does minimal of what a full iPhone could do
Why?
Snap835 that thing is over powered for sure
They should sell the software instead of that phone. What say?
I miss writing in Graffiti.
I don't see a use case for it but I definitely want that launcher
Life mode is just airplane mode wtf haha
This is interesting to me, if I didn’t have my cellular Apple Watch even more so. It would be really freeing to have something so simple, again, assuming I didn’t have my beautiful cellular Apple Watch
A phone for yur child
Still a much better looking phone than Pixel 3. LUL
Subcribe my channel
Is this created by the same palm that designed the palm treo and pilot?
Rather turning the life mode on, I just don’t buy it, and ignore it forever.
Just stop
I was thinking about getting a smaller phone to lighten my pockets on the weekends but this ain't it I'm just gonna hunt down a small android or an older iphone and keep swapping sims
That's the same specs as my Lenovo k6 Note
Is it ip67 or 68?
That looks beautiful
Liked the concept !!
Isn’t this like an Apple Watch that isn’t a watch?
That is better than light phone 2
$350 dollars for a phone for your phone? Android taking the Apple route I see...
Why would anyone want this
whats the point...
And I thought my Xperia Z5 Compact's display is too small...
Need a 4 inch phone like this one with gigantic specs like sd 660 or more and 4 gigz of ram an d battery that lasts a full day
For your homies in the pen
If you don't get this Tic-tack looking phone out of my face. Im not even going to call it a phone any more. This looks like a toy, something you'd loose in-between the couch cushions and never see it again untill like 5 years later.
Yeup :-)
I actually like it alot. It's funny you compared it now to a watch because I initially felt the same. I would definitely buy one. Unfortunately AT&T most likely won't have it. I had an iWatch series 3 and it was ok, but I felt like aside from the heart rate monitor and texts messages it was pointless for me. The price didnt even out for me. This little thing however I like because it can do alot m or then a watch. For me and the job I have, it's perfect. I don't want any to carry around my note 9 all day at work, especially when I'm only checking texts, emails, calls and maybe a little Twitter. So this for the time I'm at work, will fit very nice. Then I can enjoy my note 9 fully once I ok punch out.
Next thing: Finger phone for your Palm phone for your Main phone
$350 gets me a real flagship phone
Honestly I rather buy an android watch or an apple watch because honestly I always take my phone with me
for $100 i'd buy, maybe $150
Please make a video on a phone for this phone. Tanks
This idea only works if it would be 50$ or something
I like the design, but not the idea
$350 to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Capitalism at work
Pointless.
A rip off phone.. on a rip off fraudulent Verizon network. Nice............
I just bought a similar sized waterproof phone for $10. $350 seems a bit steep. ??
I absolutely loved Palm, but with WebOs, not android.... Bring back WebOs ??
So I can get a phone for my phone. nice!
Why tho? I already have a phone.
What is this for?
Steady, old lad, a smakl phond to replace your big phone? You need to take time off work, have a rest, relax. These machines are getting to you
Can this run fortnite mobile? I mean it has enough ram and storage and runs android 8.0 soo.....
$350 ? No thanks I'd pick the iPhone SE anyday.
Still better looking phone than Pixel 3 XL.
I remember when smartphones were that tiny. Good times..??
Facepalm ??????
or just get a cheap Huawei phone???
350$ ? What a rip off !!??
So it’s a Apple Watch competitor?
So, an android iPod?
It's useless specially when apple watch exists !! Like Robin is to batman , apple watch is to iPhone !! .. They should have just made a stand alone smaller phone instead for those who wanna be less tech savvy !!
Stop encouraging this bullshit. Soon, everyone is going to have one of these that they want to sell you. Instead, let’s get phone manufacturers back building reasonably sized devices.
No notch?
Please, please, please, sell this to me with Android one and Project Fi compatibility... Please.
ah look another redundant device flooded in the tech market that will die as soon as it hits launch day.
Lol the app Launcher looks like Apple Watch's. That's interesting tho to try, can someone extract the Launcher as an APK and let us try it on any phone?
headphone jack?
Android iPod nano
Just bring your normal phone! Where are you going!? The favela of Brazil!?
It's fast
350 for a snapdragon 435?!? I got a 180 dollar phone with a snapdragon 626
Pure stupid…
Just buy an iPhone SE.
If this was unlocked it'd be an instant purchase. Instead its covered in Verizon cancer and restrictions. What a sham.
finally somebody else.., I was on Palm heavy back in the day and they made the operating system like forever ago that everybody is just adopting now Palm OS is the freaking man.....
i like the mobile. can we use it as primary phone.
Phones have gotten so big that we need a tiny companion phone now, lol. As a standalone phone, I could see a market for this. But as an "add on" phone for $10 a month extra to my phone bill, I can't see myself ever getting this. When I'm out with this, many times I'm going to wish I had my larger phone to take nicer photos or type an email comfortably. I could only imagine carrying this around for exercising.
Can someone give a decent specs 4 inch andriod phone at reasonable price
is it able to run nova launcher??
Just use your phone normal phone. If your main phone is too big for you get a smaller phone and buy a tablet later
God how I miss small phones.
What's sad is that it is more powerful than my phone.... I'm not even joking :(
A giant Apple Watch??
That is so cute I want it now
Garbage
I can see this being useful as a back-up phone or if you want to go camping and have a phone you won't worry about losing or being distracted by. I'd get it.
I use my number share for my frontier lol
I want a fully-specced flagship that size.
Why would you need a phone for your phone if you have a phone. If you don’t like big phones you don’t have to buy one in the first place. This is pointless and cute.
They should name it "face palm"
Though title..
I would’ve bought this in a heartbeat if it was an actual phone
Y tho
Amazing phone
The Android skin is so well made
Seems to small. I don't think this is what people wanted when they said they want a small phone...
This is totally bs
You know
wouldn't it be better just to buy a $20 prepaid phone and use as a mini tablet with better features?
Nooo Nooooo! We are not going there
his name is so random
Nice, nice till you look at the price.
Like it because it’s small
10 dollars a month!? AliExpress is filled with phones like this. Just get a subscription with a second simcard and buy a used phone.
I brought a Pre due to precentral all those years ago. Still have a mint condition Pre plus which still works albeit with very little function now, so it stays in it's box for nostalgia value.
Or... bare with me... you could just use your phone
is it coming to India?
3GB Ram, wow i could play Fortnite on that
These would be great if they came in a pair. Multiple, low-frills (shared) phones to leave around is an idea I can get behind. $350 for a single unit is absolutely nuts.
You know, I know, everyone knows.
Wow a phone that can play fortnite on HD
Doa
Yo dog, I heard you like Smartphones, so I got you a smartphone to pair with your smartphone so you can smartphone without your smartphone.
The verge and electronics. Name a better combination. Kappa.
I don't get it. It's cute and I like the design of it, but the concept of a mini phone to supplement your main phone makes no sense to me. Who is this for?
Should l use my Sony Ericsson x10 mini again... as it’s more like a palm phone than the palm phone??
Seems like a waste of resources. $350?? Whats the purpose of this phone?? Now you need to carry 2 phones.
Wish it had a larger display ratio for the front and was thicker to have a much bigger battery. I know the snapdragon 435 and with 3gb/32 that's plenty of power for that thing.
I think the tide is turning again back to small phones. excited.
I want one! So tired of phones getting bigger and bigger and harder to hold.
Nice phone if it is like 100$ I would have bought that man
Can You change background on it???
It's a smartwatch for your hand..... Honestly, I really wish someone would make a tiny, durable standalone device about this size.
Having to use VZ Messages is a dealbreaker. I'm actually happy in the Messages/Chat RMS future. Don't take me back to OEM bloatware.
What a pointless idea. Shouldn't cost that much either
I dont get it. I guess its just a cheap android phone?
If this could have It's own phone number it would be a great first phone
a weekend phone...just buy an iphone se and your golden m8.
Oh...no...
When your phone is a chocolate
should've just launched another Pre TBH to capture some nostalgia. This is nonsense.
And the award for the worlds most stupid idea goes to................ PALM
It's only the name. I loved Palm and Web OS. Web OS was centuries ahead of any operation system right now like synch, messaging and multitasking. Palm died long ago and sometimes you have to left the dead behind, sadly.
I don't know why i realy love this phone.. Small and handy..
This is a good alternative to iPhone SE in terms of size, but they need to make improvements and well I am not on Verizon so they need to sell this thing unlocked.
We all feel your pain Dieter ???
Should be $150
$30 will be a slamdunk
now run pubg!
*My other phone's a Pixel 2
So its just a tiny phone with a watch interface
Wear os on a phone
It's kinda ridiculous IMO ????
I would buy this as an iPod replacement ???? oh wow
Smaller than the pixel 3 xl notch
If it was 30M water resistant Dust resistant fire resistant shock resistant It would be nice for your expensive phone( i dont know its price)
What a stupid product. I can believe this is what palm came up with and when it flops they’re gonna wonder what happened and why they’re not relevant. It’s such a shame too, because this thing is actually really cute and the os is really aesthetically pleasing like we’re used to from palm. It’s a waste of talent.
I remember the Palm pre
So let me get this straight. It's a phone for your phone, so you don't have to use your phone and if you want you can turn of your phones-phone phone mode off so your don't have you use your phones-phone? very confusing.
This little thing has far better specs than my smart phone.??????
Phones have been becoming bigger and bigger for the last 10 years. Now they're going backwards.
THIS is why palm died in the first place, LOL What genius with amnesia came up with this
What is this? A phone for aunts?
Im still not sure what the point of this is, who is this for?
This is the most pointless product lol
Wish you could buy it for around £30 outright just as a new iPod like phone
That's a phone, with purpose of communication and no addiction.
I just miss good small phones.. I simply hate huge screens..
This is the dumbest invention ever
Banter
Looks nice. M Missing the PalmOS though.
This should be a launcher.
Now this phone going to go bigger day by day then we need a third phone in 1922....
I would've loved to get this if only it was a true standalone device.
Ram and storage is even bigger than my phone. :'))
A phone for your phone?
Weekend phone? What sort of bourgeoisie need is this? 800mah battery? No. Not worth 25 a month.
Like this!!!
$350? Heh, it's a nice idea for april's fool's day. Otherwise, it's a bad joke. You can literally see the lag, and the lack of responsiveness.
$350? Verizon exclusive? ??
worst product of 2018
A stupid idea . As the kids nowadays say : Epic Fail .
Someone was high to come up with this idea. A phone for a phone that is stupid
??
Can You Give It As Giveaway For Me??
Imagine if Palm did this with iOS? $$$$
Omg that is exactly what i imagine to have for a long time, since manufacturera started to make freaking huge screen smartphones So sad that it's only for Verzion, I'm wishing this from overseas
Is there a SIM card holder?
Wow I like that app drawer ??
At 2999 Rupees This would sell a ton in India, especially with a jio integration
Love it
It must be available with Sim card feature supporting other carriers too.
this reminds me of when palm was trying to make that DOA foleo.
A monumental waste of money
Still better than SAMSUNG J6+ spec wise
A tiny iPhone X
Wish it was all screen in this size. I would buy it without thinking if it was about $150.
This is so weird lol
the specs on this are better then my moto g4...
Cool idea but the screen is way to small
This is a solution looking for a problem
Can I have that launcher
Is it running PUBG???????
So it's a phone?
Dieter is soo happy
price????
I sell phone for living and I think the phone is not a bad idea but the price is too high. I rather get the iPhone 5se. That's the reason why most of the cellphones company are losing the customers because the stupid price . Really you want to come back to business with this stupid price . I will see some people buying the phone but it will be a lost for the company
I think there could be a market for this phone. But at $350, it kills any chance of selling. If it was maybe $100-$150, it could work. Perfect phone for those that need to carry two phones for work/business. Or as a throw-away for when you don't want to bring your main $800+ phone to concerts, parties, hiking, etc. I'm glad they're treating it as a Connected Devices versus a full-fledged phone. Then it would have even less of a chance of being worth anything.
Loved it. I need it
I would use that launcher.
How much Price
What on earth is the point of this? Just buy a smaller cheap Android phone and swap the SIM back and forth tbh
I prefer the Light Phone 2
$350? I think that's a bit much, maybe $150 or even $200. It's cute and stuff but I don't think it's worth that much
What about a smart watch
Is it available in india
I would love this with full screen
So, could it be used (with a few exceptions) like an Apple Watch?
Video is best
I don't understand the phone for your phone thing but if this starts a craze of companies making standalone mini phones, I'll be all over that.
Cute Phone, thank you Dieter! =D
Where I can get the launcher?
Is it bad that, this phone is better than my normal sized phone?
Bezel less iPhone 4
so stupid, get a qwert slide out keyboard android phone instead
That single button will be a nightmare to use.. I have an Elephone S8 (worst phone I've ever owned) and say your on a web page, and want to get to the home screen, i have to bring down the notification shade and then double tap it to go home. Otherwise when you exit, it will also make you go back through the web page. Super annoying
Finally a small phone in 2018 with good specs
If this runs any Android app, you can use pulse sms and access your sms on a web browser across platforms
Looks interesting.. but very niche . I would rather have one 5inch phone and be done with it.
Yo dawg We heard you like phones...
suddenly minimal phones are becoming popular and few companies are asking for ridiculous price for these devices . china needs to step in to tap this market segment to lower the price
It already seems laggy, I would rather buy Nokia 3310
What a good replacement for iPhone SE, guys if apple camcled iPhone SE 2 u can try this instead.
You know..
This seems pretty pointless to me.
I see Fleksy there
trash
I wonder why BlackBerry is the only phone manufacturer with the physical keyboard. I am really bored when I have to do a lot of stuff on my phone ??
$350 kidding me
Have a sim slot in it and you have a perfect phone.
Wow so the biggest feature of this phone (life mode), basically turns it into... Not a phone... 350 dollars... Fantastic.
It looks like a mini iClone X! What was Palm thinking, especially at $350! ???????????
The world damn sure is changing lol very interesting tho
Palm Phone: Money tu burn!
Hold up so this thing costs more than a galaxy s7 nowadays, and is less capable than a galaxy s2? what a ripoff
A cute but useless device. Maybe if you're gonna give your 3 year old a phone? Why does it even have a camera on the back? Why would you want to use the camera on that little thing? ???? It reminds me of the last iPod nano. The way apps look on it and the UI looks similar to me.
I’d use this as my actual phone
Missed the ball on this completely. Sell it as a stand alone, I would want something like that. But as an ad on phone?? That's just stupid (and a rip off).
It's actually nice!
Wow! What an amazing usp it saves 30 seconds a week which you would spend on putting your sim card in and out the cheap, old beater phone you bought for pennies on the dollar
This seems like a great phone to bring out on town when you want to be social, but still need those basic phones features. Also.. its tiny, will easily fit inside your pocket without ruining your look (for those that care about that).
I'd rather buy a Series 4 with LTE
Apple watch you can hold up
Can someone please make this software into a launcher for regular Android devices?? I would totally use it. Love some of the features on this device
Id love a small phone like that with powerful specs, not an alternative or second phone :/
It looks really nice does it have a headphone jack?
Wow this one is even more of a come back than Nokia or Blackberry, now thats what I call creativity at it's best! Good job PALM!! Y'all have done a good job!
So basically a terrible iPhone 3gs with Android
If it were a separate phone I'd buy one for my dad. He doesn't like big phones. But as an add on, tough sell.
I like this. I would get one and just keep in my car just Incase I need it.
It looks like an iPod for Android.
I will look forward to the pixel mini phone
I would LOVVVEE a phone that size.
Give this phone a nice plastic construction, a sim card tray and remove the front camera and sell it for $50-$100 and you have a nice secondary phone which you could take along with you on hikes, camps and such where you wouldn't want to risk your precious premium phone.
not usefull in any manner.
It doesn't really make much sense. I can't think of ways a supplementary phone might be more useful than a phone and a watch. A better supplementary watch might have been much better since we don't really need all the functionality of a full phone most of the time and it'd save us bringing, or at least taking out the phone as often. + leaving the phone at home for workouts would be a lot better.
just bring back palm pre 3 or plus then put an android.
Next up: unbox therapy “I’m switching to the palm phone”
That phone is faster than my phone
Why doesn't it have web os?
My watch can do that why would i need that
Wish it was a real phone...??
Honestly it's a nice gadget, I would have made a hand band to stick it to the wrist and make it a kind of hybrid smartwatch-smartphone though.
literally no one will buy this
Lol...no matter how hard he tried this device doesn't make sense. I've never heard anyone say they want a "weekend phone". Then he says it's meant not to be used that much...so then why buy it? Name one person you know who wants to add $10 to their smartphone bill. It's a smartwatch that you carry and that's just a bad idea.
Cutest phone of 2018.
Such a cute little device. ??
1993: there'll be flying car in 2018 2018: android phone for phone
The front is a8 2018 and back is iPhone x
But can you store in the Pixel 3 XL notch?
NO
If it had its own number this would be a good pre-teen phone.
I want this phone ??
Ideal phone for daily commute or for those who have small hands basically. I dig it
Neat idea, terrible pricing
Reminds me of the light phone 2
This is now stupidity at it's best. So you buy a smaller phone to not walk around w/ your larger phone? Folks need to reassess their lives.
Would be interested if it was stand alone.
it looks decent and professional at same time.... but price is just a rip off
This is a pretty good phone being sold for stupid reasons. A phone for a phone? Just silly
wow this is amazing... simple and professional... i would use it for work only... but it is interesting.????
Give this thing a headphone jack, sell it individually and it'll replace my iPhone 5S.
Seems useless
Good for the 3rd world market. Not worth the investment.
But.. why?
Why would anyone want this?
Nice...& cool...
Dieter bohn
So it's a text message phone that doesn't do text messages right.
Unbelievably useless
so its a galaxy watch in a candybar form factor with no wrist strap.
Whyyyyy??????
Lol what a worthless phone ??
Just another kind of toy...
",ya know"
This is why I bought (and use) a iPhone SE. I wanted a small but powerful phone. Please Apple...release an updated 5 inch iPhone!
jees buy a nokia 3310
More expensive than something like... The Pocofone.
Isn't it just watch sold as a small phone?
here's a question,why didn't Dieter ask a question today??
Web OS ?
1:21 heheheh, you can do boy stuff :)
Omg the spec is powerful than my phone ??
I really like that menu style, kinda suits it, wonder if it would work on a big phone, wish google would roll out some beta version of android with that option
Should be priced at no more than $100-125
So basically it’s an Apple Watch series 3
Does it has whatsapp
He is wearing a nice shirt BTW
So in 10 months, it would cost as much as a standard Apple device. Hmmm.
Please, don't begin to put emojis into your thumbnails!
This may make no sense for some people
Maybe i need this than the smartwatch,but the price make me to think again do i need this.. and will this phone work in my country??
Am I the only interested in this being my main phone? LOL. Maybe not THIS necessarily but I am very interested in trying a tiny phone again. Just much less distracting. If I really wanna get deep into media at home I have my tablet.
Not interested in the phone's phone at all but the UI looks really good. Hope someone comes up with a Launcher that resembles this!
I like the idea on home button, tap one for back twice for home and hold it for task manager. Anyone could tell me pls what else beside this phone that has that feature ? Or maybe a custom rom.
If this was it's own phone and had a headphone jack this would be my dream phone
Dieter! You used the Centro. That's amazing. That was my first smartphone. I didn't even have a data plan with it. I loved that phone to death. It was bulletproof as well. Ironic I say that because it got shot and no longer works lol
Yo dawg, we heard you like phones. So we made a phone for your phone.
This device is quite possibly the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.
Caveat is one of the most overused words in tech YouTube...smh
$350?? You might as well buy another phone for that price...
350, WTF I'd rather buy PocoF1
Maybe it's only a reminder that WebOs is the father of the mainstream UI nowadays...And PALM proved that they can crate better UI on a small screen...that's it. Not a buy definitely.
Why?
how to buy in india?
Shut Up And Take My Money!!!!
This is nice, but is it actually smaller than the iPhone 4?
A phone for when you don't want a phone. It's a phone for your phone. It's a phone to show you why you love your other phone. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a phone!
If this was $100 I would consider it. But over $300!? What a joke.
Where do I buy from?
This is totally unnecessary.
If it wasn't a Verizon exclusive I'd consider it as like an iPod Touch kind of scenario.
Awesome video ????????????
okay, but after this I want even smaller phone for my phone for my phone
Hey Palm, 2008 called... I bet they want it back, but you were on Life Mode.
$350? They've lost their minds. $99-$149 would be the accurate price.
Really pointless phone.
I can't imagine that anyone needs (or wants) this.
It's a sad day when in a age of phones getting so big, and they do so much, we now have to buy a cellphone for our $1,000$+ phones... Sigh
Yo dawg, i heard you liked palm phones....
$350?!?!?!?! plus $10 monthly?!??!?!?!Give me iPhone SE please.
Why?
I'd put my money on the Light phone 2 instead.
atleast it looks better than pixel 3 xl
Anyone rich enough here to buy me a budget gpu?
Hey Verge! Which cameras do you guys use to film these reviews? Thank you
For $350 you can get a Nokia 7.1 with much better specs. I guess this is going after a niche but it's priced way too high
3.3 inch so this is almost the same size as the iphone 2g screen XD
Did he just say that it costs $350 lololol
I like the interface
Stop trying to bring back discontinued tech, Diets...
I don't understand how someone besides fans of the brand itself would spend 350$ to get a phone with specs like this. It'll be way more worth it getting a Xiaomi phone or any other budget phone which would have much better specs.
But how do we know you are not a giant?
this phone is not for sale outright
It should be without any bezels and minimum screen size of 4.5-5 inches, internals irrelevant, it needs to be at least as big as iPhone 4, not smaller...
Idiotic phone.
It's cute but so expensive and useless.
why would I buy another phone to leave my phone behind? And if I leave behind my phone, why would I buy that phone in the first place? Doesn't make sense.
Bring cheap Android smartwatch, thats way better
I wish they made it just a little bit bigger so i could use it as a full time phone, like a successor to the iPhone SE.
Really 350
sounds like something we should all switch to in order to start being off our phones more.
This is basically a smart watch
what a stupid concoction. You could just get a tiny phone or a smartwatch
Dieter is the only one that will even ponder this purchase
I want this now
10 bucks a month? For what?? My contract includes up to nine SIM cards at no extra cost with one number, so I'd rather just buy another phone, let's say a cheap Nokia 3 and put another SIM in there. Hangouts can run on multiple devices with the same account.
Dieter getting into his own element. I'm overjoyed rn.
Can it run pubg??
So it's a phone I can carry more easily than the phone I carry every day and have no problem carrying?
Well that phone is going to compete with other wearables. It’s going to be hard to win over portentoso customers because wearables make more sense then a phone for a phone you already have.
This is weird. It has too much stuff to be a “disconnected life” phone, so it ends up being a too combobulated , slow ACTUAL phone rather than something like the Light Phone 2.
That looks like a pretty good basic phone! Can you use it without a different phone? My grandparents would probably like it.
Looks like it run like an Android phone from 2009 haha
So what's the difference between that life mode and airplane mode?
Very very cute I liked it Hope it would be available
What a world
BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > *the trend phone's size revolution
"We'll have a cure for cancer in the future" 2018 ....
This will fail horribly. Dead on arrival.
Palm should remain dead
Headphone jack???
This could've easily run on Android Go instead of standard Android. It would've cost much cheaper
3.3 inches? My first Android phone was 3.2 inches. I don't think it was this small! Lol
No use. phone for phone, what's next car for car........??????
Really, is this product absolutely necessary? Personally don't see a point to this concept, the whole idea of a mobile phone is that you could take it with you and the product began getting smaller and thinner and then we got the smartphone and they averaged 3.5-4". Then technology began advancing with phones becoming smarter and not just being used to phone others but instead to browse the web, play games, watch Netflix, go on social media, use maps etc. The whole idea of having a bigger screen compensating the need for something bigger and I don't think there are any real flaws with a slightly bigger display. Currently many flagship phones and budget phones offer a larger display phone and a smaller display phone and if you don''t want to lug around a massive display everyone then it only makes sense to buy a smaller display phone. Having another device really complicates things and I mean most phones now-a-days will fit in your pocket or in a small bag.
Uhhhh no.
Palm pre ftw
Inception. Phone for your phone.
It can be fitted in Pixel 3XL notch
At least it doesn’t have a notch
This made me miss my moto defy ????
This is the dumbest thing ever. Why would anyone in their right mind would pay 350 for this?
good for the senior citizens, they do complain about size.
I like the launcher can I get it on my pixel 2 xl?
Son of iPhone X & Google Pixel
but will it play fortnite?!!
If this were a 100 dollars it would be a good
I really like this and I wanna buy it.
Ok, but why don't i wanna bring my regular phone places? What makes this in any way a better option than a smartwatch? Who is this for? What purpose does it serve? So many questions about how this even got made...
I've always liked plams.
Small phones are severely underrated. You will never know how awesome it is unless you try it yourself. It minimizes your screen time / chat time while getting the job done. People unfortunately compare their price to other cheaper flagships and forget the main features of these phones; to make you more comfortable and more productive. I would easily pay 500$ for this rather than a one plus 6 for that reason.
What a cute and worthless little thing.
Why ?
This is what I want from the iwatch. The confidence to leave my phone for days.
That would make a great TV remote... but the price?
This could actually be successful. There are lots of people that want a small smartphones to just google something on the go or call someone. The market is full of gigantic phones; small phones have become a really rare thing
This is just plain stupid, trying to do something which a smart watch is supposed to do.
If google would just put out a primary pixel phone this size with a good camera, I'd be ALL OVER IT, PLEASE. Why does my phone need to be so big??
so no headphone jack.. sigh!..
Erm I fail to see the utility myself but you do you
omg if this is available overseas, unlocked, for that size, I will definitely buy it!
Play pubg
Before 50k
Why would anyone want this
it's depressing to see these has-beens trying hard to come back into the ring
UI looks good??
Practically useless
History Repeats Itself . . Hence, Proved!
Completely useless.
I can't believe that we have 3GB of RAM in a tiny phone.
Why would anyone spend almost a thousand on a. Phone to not use it, and use a crappy version instead
STILL LOOKS BETTER THAN THE PIXEL
I think that if it was waterproof and maybe a little durable (some sort of shock absorbent back/sides) i think this would make a very good 'outdoors' phone, which you could take with you when you go out hiking or something.
Straight up copied apple’s music logo
This phone make more sense than pixel 3xl notch and iphone xs mas price
It's so cute. The hardware and especially the software seem to be very polished as well. I want that launcher.
We will eventually make Phone for phone for phone for phone for phone
This could be really, really great. I'd love a phone where I could do everything necessary - calls, texts, pay bills. Too bad there are so many restrictions on it; price included.
If the screen were 4.0" I would seriously consider getting one of these as my main phone.
The perfect weekend phone is iPhone se, its just sad that apple no longer sells it.
I'd buy for $150
Would probably still get addicted to it regardless????
iPhone SE is $199
If i knew this day would come, i would have bought a tablet and one of those phones which used to be regular sized. Next thing you know, you could be using another phone for your phone which you bought for your original phone. lol
If a famous company,just one or a couple of companies created this sort of small and compact phone,make it much bezel-less,largen the battera and the megapixel of the front camera and make it cheap,then I WOULD buy it. NO JOKE........
This thing is painfully slow.
Is this the new Apple Watch Max I keep hearing about?
Can you put your real SIM in there?
Oooor just get a full Android smartwatch? You know, the ones with normal Android, which can download any app, include a sim tray and sometimes a microsd tray, and are overall a much better product than this is!
Or, you know, just get a better phone like the iPhone SE. Palm is definitely dead after seeing this.
I wonder who came up with this useless idea? A pocophone is the same price I’d rather get a pocofone beside my iPhone. I don’t need two phones but if I did why would I pay that much for such an underpowered device if I wanted a phone to just make calls I would get one of these super old phones that don’t even run apps. I see no point in browsing or watching YouTube on this super small screen, maybe music makes some sense. I don’t usually have a need to point out the flaws of stuff I’m not interested in but this thing is just one big, or rather small??, mistake.
A phone for your phone. What's next? A laptop for your laptop?
This is the saddest thing in tech I have seen in a very long time.
I'm more interested with the launcher. I think it's cool
Waste of money
Goodluck finding it when you turn that palm mode on?????????? Bcoz that thing is going to disappear within seconds??????
I'm a bit disappointed about the review, that seems a better phone than shown, it deserve more credit in my opinion
Ok not exactly a powerhouse but ironically packs more ram than my iphone ....
But.. but.. does it has? a headphone jack?
Hashtag joke! ??????
Tailored to make developers crazy again about the minimum size of phone screens. ?? Android in general deal with size layout so well, automatically, but to an optimal experience the dev need to do some fine tunning. For a long time we don't need be worried about very small screens, but with this damn thing, the good time is probably over...
can i use it as main phone
where is this world heading...
A phone for a phone...why?
This is actually quite nice looking device! ??
Who wants tiny phone nowadays? Gone were the days of nokia 8210.
It is an android phone, cannot use android messages, but can sync iMessage! ??
3 GB ram? Wtf man??
I like it's UI.. And that long press with the option of that particular app.. like apple 3d touch is cool.. I would buy it if it can a carry a sim card
Hands on?! More like palms on I’ll leave
Android Auto works?
Maybe its just me but maybe get rid of the camera and put more battery in? SInce its a compliment to your actual phone just go all the way and make it just for calling and music.
Whyyyyyy, it doesnt make any sense. Either use it as a main or dont buy it. If u want to buy a cheap phone for when youre out and about, get a pocophone, its cheaper and it has a way bigger battery.
Sd435? No nfc, No face/touch id, no ip67 rating, no headphone jck. No buy!!
Pointless. We have smartwatches as backup
Buy iPhone se
I love small phones........enjoyed typing one handed back in the old days.........but this is overpriced and too small.......it should have been 4 inches and priced $200.
Where can i get one?
Companies making fool of people by making big phones, notch, no headphone jack, etc. etc....why not make a 4.5 inch to 5 inch screen phone...and it will be a allrounder.. No need of all extra stuff like this Palm Phone..
I have a super small cheap android phone from company called lava. I just put my sim in that phone when I want to switch to smaller phone.
Still better than my phone
Convient how I am watching on the biggest iOS device u can get!!??????????
I can see this being good for when you go to work and need less distractions from your primary phone or when you go on vacation.. I don't think it's a niche device over all.. Time will. Tell..
They should make a phone like this but bezel less like samsung or lg or other phone manufacture with taller display, and without notch.
This isn't a phone. It's an inconvenient smart watch. Why can't anyone just make a fully featured small Android phone?
Thats a cute phone!
You know!
Not for me
350$? I thought it would be max 150$
...if it had a headphone jack and you could get a case with a belt clip it would be the perfect running/workout phone...it would have replaced my aging ipod nano...
I. Need. Something. Like. This.
Why do people use weekend phones!?
It looks just like a mini iPhone 6s
No thanks.. Should have release this back in 2007 then I'll buy it
Leave my phone behind. Dear God no
its just new new new but nothing in this phone invited me towards it neither the size. Even for the small phone peoples this thing is not practical better call it a spy phone
It’s so cute and awesome ?? I want one! ??
maybe for children connected to the parents phone .
But why?
Hmmm...get this or get the Pocofone F1 for $25 more? Pocofone has snapdragon 845, 8GB ram, and 4000mah battery, and is currently listed on Amazon for $374.49. I know they both have different use cases but that price is not competitive at all.
Soon we'll see the Palm Plus, with a 5 inch screen and... wait a minute...
A phone for phone? P H O N E C E P T I O N
Does every company have to copy iPhone's designs?
Mobile phones were made so that we wouldn't have to carry bulky landlines with us. They evolved so that we wouldn't have to carry a camera, a music player and a plethora of other things with us. And now we're pondering the use of a small device so that we wouldn't have to carry our mobile phone with us?! I am sorry but Palm can stay dead!
So it's basically the most useless thing ever??? I mean think about it, it's a smaller more convenient phone to carry as supposed to an LTE enabled smartwatch, so it is supposed to serve the same purpose. But it's still a phone in your pocket, it's still flopping around in your pocket when you're running, so something strapped to your wrist would be a million times better as a short term phone replacement
Well at least there's no notch ..
Wow keren cuyyyy
I read palm I clicked ??
the question is ...Why?
can it be used as a primary device?
Just get an LTE smartwatch you'll probably lose that thing.
I could see something LIKE this as a great vacation phone rather than weekend phone. However, my criteria would be to have banging cameras, decent storage, and water proofing. This way no matter what I am doing, no one suspects my tiny phone but I can get amazing photos and not carry around a bulky big phone that may attract attention
More worth than te pixel 3
So, you pay over a thousand bucks for a phone and then you go on and shell out for a little 'housemaid' to help your $1000 stay and look pretty at home, while this little helper does the heavy lifting that the more expensive phone was meant to do from the start! This is just going to end up as another "status" symbol.
you know?
That looks cute ??
What for?
that phone is better than mine except the resolution
Would be cool if it implemented a more bezzeless design.
This was incredibly underwhelming
Another failing product, well done ??
We really need a small phone like that
350$ bucks ? It's dead cheap XD .. NICE ONE
this thing has no purpose... unless you use it as a primary phone. if it was cheaper, i think it would make a great phone for going to concerts bars, or anywhere pickpocketing is more of a reality and you wont be ruined if it was swiped. Get yourself a nokia 2 or a ZTE for like... Under $100
So, you have carry around a small phone instead of a big phone and you can do with it something between a smartphone and smartwatch. Why not buying a smartwatch instead? Much more convenient.
I think this would be great for kids in middle school.
I need that launcher tho ??
I'm using your last name for the rest of the year.
Has basically the same specs as my E5 Plus, but it costs more? Something like this should be cheap.
this... was a waste of everyones time.
Can it run PUBG
My phone wantsa friend! I found one! 350$ nope!
Two things are infinite, universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about former
If they can make this in to a watch, that would be awesome
2018 - where our phones are too big that we need a more 'portable' phone
Just buy iphone 4.Problem solved.
I love the design and the Launcher
But WHY ?
NO THANKS
You can get the Pocophone for this price...
So palm mode is really airplane mode... for the price your better off getting actual...real full featured low end/mid range phone for less then what this costs if you need a basic no frills weekend phone... this device is gonna last as long as those Microsoft Kin phones back in the day..which surprisingly were also offered by Verizon..for two months before it was killed off!
Better than Pixel 3's Notch
its better than my phone T_T
Great and awesome video.....??
From the front, it looks like a miniature moto E.
Shut up and take my money!
INCEPTION??
i dont know
does it run pubg
350 for a phone meant to be ignored?
More like $25 a month cuz you said it’s $10 for the plan and $15 for the phone
Back to 2009 3.3inch screen is huge.
first, multiple cameras on the phones and now multiple phones to carry around? what's next?
WTF ??...... Watch for your phone Phone for your phone What next??
I hope it will be cheaper in the future. I really like this.
$350? Funny joke Verizon...
I like it
So our phones are getting so big that companies think we want to spend a bunch of extra money on a phone baby for our phones.... Wtf is going on with phone manufacturers
When palm phone specs are better than your phone.
Why don't you just buy a compact phone from Sony
Be useful if you're out running and don't wanna have to cart your big 6.5" phone around with you
Damn its better than my galaxy tab a
I'm waiting for an android phone that is around the same size as the older iphones (4/5/se) with an oled display and current flagship specs. I haven't been impressed by the sony compacts yet, and i hope the rumored galaxy s10 lineup can offer something along those lines. I reckon the android market is ripe for a small flagship.
But can you play pubg on it
the first iPhone had a 3.5 inch screen, so it's not much off
I really want to buy that phone really bad!
Demn the mini phone has actually more power than my phone.....
Not interested in this phone but think carriers should drop the additional monthly charge for wearables.
I love how the launcher look! It's clean and refreshing (although it looks like Apple Watch OS) but I think Stock Android should be something like this in the future. Just my two cents.
Blown out apple watch ? ??
More expensive than a Pocophone F1. Hilarious.
Congratulations Palm! You've invented a reprocess!!!. For $300 you get to recharge another redundant contraption.
I actually want that phone – as a standalone. I hate how big phones have gotten and if you want to spend less than for an (old) iPhone but still want some quality, chances are your phone's screen is over 5". But actually I just need that palm phone, but without anything else.
It looks like an Obama phone
Why? Who asked for this?
Looks a little like the apple watch OS
Why would anyone use this over their normal phone?
I can't believe this device makes sense at any price.
Soooo disappointed! they really missed the point. No one needs another smart phone to use with your smartphone, we already have other wearables for that like smartwatches. A lot of people would have paid for a decent android iphone SE alternative. Huge missed opportunity, so sad.
This will be dead and forgotten about in no time... Won't even get off the ground... Absolute nonsense lol
i'd rather get an iPod touch.
absolutely ridiculous price
Ouuu I want that seriously
Nice! It's more like a upgraded pager for your main phone. I like it!
WTF is this? early 2000s?
do you have Amazon link ?????
The launcher is dope
Comeback? Or failed?
2:22 CNET is the first thing they search on YouTube before their own channel!!!!
Bruh u can buy a SD 845 at $300 as well as Kirin 970??
Or.. maybe get a dual SIM phone instead?
Not worth the money cuz u can get best phones at $200-$300.. like pocophone,Honor play
Just make normal sized phones, I want a phone not a tablet.
What a waste of money, trash!
This is the extra battery for the Samsung Extinct all over again
Better to buy Iphone SE
If Steve jobs market this it would've been the next big thing
i love it i want it
What's the point of getting a big phone when you buy another phone so you don't have to use your big phone?
So no gestures? Wasn't that the reason to get a palm?
So much for Apple insight and imagination...
Can we now have a proper phone with a small screen?
what are your thoughts on the Lite Phone?
Smartwatch phone ?
Does this phone require another phone??? ????????
I want that launcher
I want this beauty ??
I wouldn't mind having that smaller phone for convenience (alongside my larger phone). Sometimes I'm just stepping out for a while, or going to pick up the kids from school, and the most I do is text, (downloaded) music, and (downloaded) YouTube videos. Size wise I would just use Google assistant for everything...composing text, calendar, etc. I loved my Palm Pre and wish it had a Web OS skin, but oh well...you can't get everything. I hope it has a smart locator feature built in because my wife would lose that day one. LOL!
galaxy pocket neo....
Instead of making a secondary device, why don't companies focus on making a compact phone(no compromises) like the Xperia compact series or the iPhone SE.
Why not buy a pocophone instead?
Why? What's the deal?
Web OS so ahead of its time
I don't get the point of this phone.
Where can I buy this device?
This seems like a great option as a first phone for someone's kid, like the 8-14 range maybe, when kids might not be so hot on "kid friendly" designed phones, but you don't want to give them some expensive thing.
I would rather buy Nokia 3310(2018)
That’s y they got the smart watch
The new iphone 4s! Lol
Pocofone has a great competition in the same price range :3
It’s basically like this: the GPS Apple Watch goes along with the iPhone, so the Palm Phone goes along with any Android
They need to make a sliding side keyboard. A on screen keyboard is too small.
Gimme that launcher on my phone tho
Says it's a palm phone but the guy still uses 2 hands.....Lmao and also who's this phone for MY BABY! The owner now has to worry about 2 phones (charging and handling), btw 800milamp wow, that's too much. Now that i think about it , maybe this phone was for trollin or for memes.
lol ?? a phone for my phone ?? OMG ?????? I thought that’s what smart watches are for.
why i need 2 phones? why i need to leave my main phone at home? ??
Smartphone maker should mimic that amazing 1 button navigation
Anyone else read it as PLAM?
This is the future of the phone... Once the phones become too big people will again prefer the smaller ones...
Why is this phome faster than my 5T...
This 'phone' basically indicates that there's a problem with phone's today
Of course Verizon has to ruin everything
Personally I would rather buy an S7/S8 for the same price used - and just use that?
Oh, I was just thinking about a small phone for second sim card that I have and this is kind of ideal... And also a good phone for runner
You kind of fumbled your way through that review. Trying to show one thing and end up showing another...
Can I get it in India??? Fan of small formfactor phones
First buy a smartphone, then a small smartphone as a substitute phone.??????
Google of course.
I'm better off with large screens mobo
this phone is smaller than pixel 3xl notch
What if I need a phone for this phone
I just want a 5 inches flagship
I don't buying this
After buying a new iPhone, I kind of yearn for this type of "simplicity".........
I would actually want one since I can take this little device out without getting worried it might get snatched. Hopefully other companies follow suit though I doubt it.
Pointless.
Imagine playing pubg on it
I really hope to see on market sub 5" display...again
But why does it exist ?!
or you could just get an iPhone SE? haha
Why don't all the big phone companies make a 5 inch phone like the iPhone 5s and make it bezzelless? I would buy one straight away. I don't know why everyone wants a big 20 inch phone in both of their hands. Does not make sense to me
Faster than iPhone 8...??
Can't wait to do boy stuff.
No notch! Horray!!!
P L A M
Of course i love holding on my big phone. Those who dont there always smaller phones and the android watches. This gadget wont sell
whats next....echo for my echo?
10$ for a "second sim" a month? Why do carriers think it's ok to charge extra for a e-sim? I really wanna know if someone would ever pay 10$ extra a month just to be able to use this maybe once or twice a month maybe?
Maybe it can act as my backup phone or a mp3 player ????
Seriously, why do you need a phone for a phone. This phone has no customers. I'd love to have a small phone which is more convenient than my big one
Waste of money, impractical unless you need a work phone. For the average consumer, you have a phone already. Just use it. This is gonna be a flop.It's a really stupid idea.
I’ve been waiting for this for seven years!!!
Garbage phone
I think I like the idea... as a stand-alone phone.
So smartphones too large in 2018 then we back again to 2007 when we just want a phone smaller?
What a time to be alive
Just get a smart watch or Apple Watch
iPhone user: get a se
I think this is gona be iphone in android aystem
This is insane.
It's so Cuteeeeeeee
palm phone + duct tape = boom, smartwatch
Who would want such a thing? You buy a flagship phone to use it everyday. If you antes this might as well use a feature phone.
I'd buy it if it was available as a standalone phone where I can put a 2nd SIM card.
id like a "pizza for your pizza" ??
i like this phone
I though his name was dinnerbone lol
Interesting little thingy. It was simpler to have smaller phones in the past, but I don't think it makes much sense to have two phones just so you can have a weekend phone. The best weekend phone is no phone :)
how cute
28 nm soc @ 800mha battery??
It doesn't have a headphone jack?
I want this screen on another tiny smartphone - Atom.
So basically an Apple Watch
Ugly as @!
Can we get in India?
Hi , how much does it cost? thanks
looks actually cute
$350? Yeah...a companion phone for that price...no thanks
That’s not a palm phone sorry.
So Palm has released the original iPhone 11 years later? Isn't this basically what a smartwatch does?
350?! Why not get iPhone SE
You can also pick one of their colourful wrist strap to turn it to a smart watch. Jk
Tungsten for Life ????
Is this a 2018 device?
OH OHHHH THE GOOD OLD ANDROID !!!!!!!, ARE YOU KIDDING ME !!!!!, ITS A SMART PHONE WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!
This is so cute. I love this thing lol. I wish I could instead just pop my SIM card into this thing instead of $10 extra
It is run pubg game
Nope
Would've been much better if the web OS made a comeback! ?? That launcher brings back honeycomb memories. Lol ?? I like their launcher. This is a fail. SMH
Does it have a headphone jack?
Love this guy. Does great precise reviews
Don't see much application of it ..I mean ..if want a small phone in your hand ?..get a small phone
1:21 BOY STUFF
How's that different from airplane mode?
Totally pointless. I don't think people will buy it.
Hey when is this official?
I am at a certain age and I have no idea who you are.
Lol my phone still snapdragon 425 ??
I want this. I didn't know I wanted this, but I want this.
WTF...a phone for a phone ??
Well, basically it's a big wearable, right?
So it's technically just a oversized smartwatch without the wrist strap? Um.... Yeah, I'll pass.
Try not to sound so excited, Dieter
At least it doesn’t have a notch
Isn’t a smart watch a better option for that functionality? For example smart watch will always come with you and you don’t need to put it in pocket, so the probability is better.
Lagcity!
Didn't HTC try to do something like this a few years ago? A smart watch with the dual number system would make more sense.
Well I love it Better than Pixel 3 xl or I phone Xs max??
This is the cousin of the flip phone
435 is good enough!
Not first
But who was Phone Phone?
2nd lol
So now we're back in 2007?
Lol
BUT CAN YOU DO THIS?
0of
useless shit.
200k folds before it starts to degrade isn't really too much. Phone would last like a month
Am I the only one who has a problem on how bulky it looks?
Useless gimmick.
How does case will work
Please no
Just another way to part a fool and his money
The ratio is weird
Why?
Still risky!
i have the perfect slogan for this phone for samsung "The new Infinity Flex. Cool Technology, That No one asked for."
it looks like it's useless, people have Tablets and have phones, so......why would i buy this big thing? so i can have a tablet and a Phone wich a lot of people already have.....
But when it’s folded, it’s too thick
The Chinese phone is irrelevant. Wanna know why Chinese phone don't make it to the west? Cause they're garbage and westerners know it
LMAO! The hell is that thing? Samsung fell off for real. This has to be the worst phone design I've ever seen. Why is it so thick, its like a brick.
I currently use the Huawei honor note 8 6.6 inch screen, which means I'd have to downsize or always have it unfolded.... I went back to my old Samsung galaxy note 4 for a few minutes and it just felt tiny ...... As much as I love this concept I'm just not feeling it yet....keep going Samsung and I'm looking forward to various sizes the future is looking good
eewwww its so chunky...
useless and bulky
0:40 that little bluescreen
To all people immediately hating: Do you even know the NAME of this conference?--"Samsung Developer Conference". It is primarily for the "investors" and "developers". They need investor confidence, developer support and at the same time media hype to boost interest and eventually demand and sales. It is still in its prototype stages.
when folded, it reminds me of Nokia x10
the new Nokia looks nice
It looks like crap look how dark the rooms are they’re shown off in. Those are gonna be some bad colours
Apple probably can make one beautiful Foldable phone, but that phone looks ewww...
why would you want a foldable one though its cool but whats the point
Nintendo DS
Why though?
Dont see why people are doubting this. A tablet size screen that can be folded into a smartphone to fit your pocket. Pretty useful in my opinion.
I mean, do we need it? No. Is it cool? Yes. What are some uses for it? It eliminates barrier of phones being too small and too big and instead blends them together. Now you have a full on display to see things better.

who give a shit if it's a foldable phone man at least make the battery last longer they have got the technology but doe want to do it
200,000folds before it degrades? There'll be a lot of people here in the states that'll be buying a new one in three months, given how many times people check their phones in one day.
I’m switching back to Samsung now, I’m fucking sick of my iPhone X
Of course they had to come out with something as keep increasing screen size of phones will make them no portable at all. So if the folds will eventually damage the screen in future, then people will start taking their tablet and small phone separately with them again as a lot used to do before.
After blue balling us for so long, finally (and surprisingly) Samsung announces their foldable phone out of nowhere. I don't know if it'll be successful or not, but glad they didn't just give up on it all together.
This really shows that people are still in love with tablets and missing their bigger screen size.
Lots of haters in the comments. This is the first phone that’s making me want to finally upgrade from my iPhone 6s lol
But it wont stand much longer than non foldable phone...there will be a frequent replace of its part than todays battery problem!!
Fuck wallpaper presentation
Yet another distraction.
Damn. Now thats the S M A L L E S T F L E X E R O F T H E C E N T U R Y.
iFlex by Apple The first to bend ??
This is pure planned obsolescence. Display WILL wear out as clockwork, you will HAVE to buy a new one every year.
Imagine the cost to replace the glass/display
I like it !!!!÷
I WILL DROP APPLES ASS IN A HEARTBEAT FOR THIS SHIT. THIS IS THE COOLEST SHIT. SORRY APPLE. MUSK WAS RIGHT. YOU DIDNT THINK OF THIS FIRST AND WELL IM SWITCHING NOW. I NEED A FOLDABLE FONNNNNNNE
Isn’t this going to canabilize their tablets?
Pointless, just something to hype people up about!!
Samsung wasn't first, Royole wasn't first, it was Apple and the iphone 6... lol
Now i can literally flex on the haters
iPhone 6 2.0
what kind of tempered glass screen protector will there be for this? The Galaxy s8 and S9 tempered glass sucks, nothing stays on.
That lag though
The iPhone 6 is the first foldable phone....
About Royole beating Samsung to the punch for the first foldable smartphone, they didn't do a very good job if anyone's wondering. The screen suffers from major lag issues, apps take a while to open, and the phone sometimes can't tell when it's being held horizontally or vertically. It seems to be a really rushed product.
how many days does 200,000 folds equate to?
Ladies and Gentlemen, The iFlex by Apple Inc. ??
Market it as a foldable tablet instead.
The Chinese one isn't worth mentioning. Any moron out side of Asia that buys it will regret it. It'll last five minutes. cheap shit. Hope Sony brings flex phone out :)
Nice useless tech
Every phone is foldable. Most of them are foldable only once.
https://worldwidetechie.com/samsungs-foldable-smartphone/ Here is the Details about the Samsung's Infinity flex Display used in the Foldable Smartphone
#bendgate
Interesting
Let the guinea pig's try this out first before I spend any of my money on new technology like this, it needs time to be perfected.
It's a prototype
And i thought it was really that bricky.
wow
All this new technology, and noone has the courtesy to have brighter lighting fml
meh
I'm not feelin it
So..... A modern flip phone??
Anyone else thinks this phone is ugly? I mean it's cool that the technology exists but is anyone asking for a huge ugly phone?
Looks like an old Nokia phone
There is a demand for foldable phones???
wow really very techiniacist
Not officiall
Odd Flex, but ok...
Flip phones are coming back!!!! ??
That's so cool! How do you get the vids from? Like your vids so much
Samsung will takeover iphone soon
How is that case though?
99.99% of the viewer = yeah like hell I have money 00.01% of the viewer = hell yeah another collection
Best phone ever.
Were can I get the phone the WEBSITE AND THE Accessories everything that came with it What's the website please
I'm gonna buy the phone and the game vice thing. Just gotta finish saving
Can you attach the fan accessory with the case on?
Makes me bananas wher can I order this ??????????????????
Music at the starting pls
I just saw it today and must say I was like woooooow from what dimension is this?!?!?! It has a price of 1000euro but hey,it's a smartphone worth having,all those features...damn,that's just sick!!! Heheehe,by the way,great video and awesome review of a great device!!! Maybe this is the next smartphone on my list :D
How much does everything in total cost with all of the gadgets
Idk what to get asus rog or IPhone xs max
That side mounted port should be on every phone, especially if they don't have the 3.5 mm jack.
How did u get it??!?!!
A bit too small. I'm getting an error reading, 'abnormalities in charging port.' Battery is getting increasingly worse. It really dies fast once it reaches 50% mark. I had one error when it wanted to do a hard reset of my phone for some reason. It decided not to for some reason. The screen is causing me problems when playing. About 20% of the time it doesn't register my thumb input when trying to shoot the bad guys. Losing many more games than I should be. Sometimes it registers my thumb input when I'm confident I'm not touching.. Just very close. Beautiful screen. No extra crap apps come with it so that's nice. Feels ok in the hand, just a bit small. Wish it had some hard rubber on the edges to assist in holding it.Will be returning it...
How much cost that pandel
Little bit over priced!
It’s an amazing phone but the android market needs more high end games!

Very nice sir. Really nice to see you getting more and more popular!!
Where can you buy this
Geez how much does the phone only costs ? and then the whole combo package cost ?

Satisfied
can anyone link me the background song plz ?
Left out the main part dude. How much does all of that cost!!?
3 docks? Hmm...
Best phone ever. ?? How do I get one.
I love this phone a lot. My only complaint is the Snapdragon 845 chip. It will be outdated in about 3 more months with the Snapdragon 855. If this phone had the Snapdragon 855 chip inside then I would be sold 100%.
Bonkers ??
ASUS should make a macbook style lapdock. Insert the phone like a game cartridge. Tabdock as well.
I just need that suitcase. It just looks cool
Where can i buy this?
IT'S A GOOD PHONE,BUT THE PRICE IS RIDICULOUS! Yeah,in my country its RIDICULOUS!
Do you guys not have phones?
Asus beat razer
But the question is - Can you play Subway Surf, Temple Run and Minecraft on it?
asus just declared a war with himself!
Better reviews than mkbhd and inbox therapy ???? killing it bro ?? especially that outro track adding the cherry on top ??
what is the track name sir ?
Holy mother of GOD????????
Outro song ?
Rog?
Also the gamevice is probably the only accessory i'll get
Wow ??
Give me a one phone??????
#nutted
What you didn't mention is how god awful expensive the accessories are
Very very very few people would buy all this as a set.. Majority of people won't not buy it at all! What a waste of technology..
What's your user name in pubg
This is the best unboxing I've ever seen
Very good phone

I can't believe it took them forever to relase the ROG phone Not to mention the S10 is most likely going to come at February
Gaben has left the chat
Will this phone be able to play Pokemon Go?
ROG = Ridiculously Overpriced Garbage

The best unboxing video ever seen??
Okay I remember vapour god deal, for this I will write the phantom story
The accent. ??????
this phone is sucks
in all honesty.. best phone of 2018 in my opinion. I think it was extremely well done now all we need is timely OS updates and you have the perfect phone.
does these products you can get without getting the phone
And I had thought that the ROG GT51 was too much...
What's the name of the song that he uses at the end that was awesome.....
It's a superb phone..
Where are the good games for these awesome gaming smartphones? Dig the video, but I find gaming smartphones to be ...kinda pointless if all we get is what's in the play store. Save money, buy a switch, get real games without all these crappy iAP's, coins... sprinkles and sh*t to keep us buying crap. Also having a switch, you don't feel compelled to upgrade your phone $$$ EVERY YEAR to keep up. and keep your phone as a phone.
Me : Now What is next
Thumbnail Stuff On 2:38 Thanks Me later
Can I just get this plssss!

How is the camera
Amazing video
better than the ipad pro and razr phone
Asus nailed the 2018
Wow, talk about commitment! The Razr phone looks like a sad little toy compared to this.
Maybe it is easier to bring along my Xbox to game with ...
Damn...imagine the same things for an iPhone... No don't
try samsung j6 on budget
that kit was insane
I think it looks awesome and the gaming controller and the case would really be the only thing I would use out of all of that.
Thanks that u made a vid about this phone...THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FOR GAMERS....My aim is to buy one of these??
And of course battery comparison mrwhosetheboss style
Camera test of it
great video
Just need a 7nm chip in this phone then the performance will be great in battery and gaming both !!
How much does it even cost???
I don't know why but it's the first time i feel like you haven't done justice to a product.
Wow how you gonna use all of that?????
I like the Asus ROG Phone.
i was hesitant to view this video because I've already watched so many rog phone videos .. But was satisfied at the end. great work arun.
I really think is to much for a phone..
You should make a new Hindi or Punjabi channel as you r An NRI
How lucky when you get all that for free
Nice movie
Really this is Ridiculous ??
What's the song at the end?
The truth about the OnePlus 6t video wanted!! ????
It is one of the best phones
i really hope theres no other "sequel" or "series" of this phone coming up in near futute. simply bcs i hope the team just keep improving and maintaining the performance whatsoever on this device I mean.. Look at those packaging!! kudos dedication!
This is one of those videos you feel suuuuuper satisfied after watching even if you're not a techie. It must have been a beautiful experience altogether for you. Now it makes me want to get my hands on one very soon!!!??
Nintendo 3ds, anyone
I wish I would get this for my birthday
Price?
Absolute beast of a phone
Okay, the phone looks lit, but how is it as an actual phone? Good reception? How is the camera, etc.?
i hope you can make camera review asus rogue phone and xiaomi latest black shark.
I have the rog phone I want the suitcase lol
I love your videos man, I actually get exited when I see you posted. Keep it up!
Would you mind tell us does it count as an emulator when using the Dock station for PUBG Mobile ? people say Pubg might lock this out ? is it true ?
a massive contender for the most underrated smartphone of 2018
IT IS MY FAV SMART PHONE can you tell me bro whats the whole price of that phone with its accessories
I guess you could say...he’s the Bob Boss of unboxings :P
Is it even modularity because honestly idk what to call it, but sure as hell Asus has taken it over the top with this baby
So how much is it? That's important info.
I just liked the video before it started... You're always gonna bring us some bomb stuff everytime you upload a video.
Music : Fine Day by Keanu Silva
Camera review plz
Wow! this is bigger than I thought
Think i must become a youtuber....
Mr who I've been subbed sceince 20,000 and ur content is 1 of the best keep up the good work
really ridiculous
I want that ??
Omg ????????????????
Great video as always
THIS THING IS NUTS
Oh God!, u are so hot. I am here just for ur thighs. I have a huge crush on u
Papasito ????????????????????????????
The very best and most informative ROG PHONE video on the web yet!! Kudos... this phone is in my top 3! 1.Samsung note 9 2.Asus Rog Phone 3.Honor note 10
PAPASITO MMMM BAREFOOT SEXY WOW ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I like it
Arrrr ohhhh geee not rog
Wait....if I buy the phone, will I get a suitcase full of accessories?
You are doing a great job! I find my self unsubscribing from most of the MURICA gadget tubers due to your sincerity and trustworthiness.
Best edit ever in unboxing
mail that phone to my house! I can like, subscribe, donate, give birth..
Superb man?
I’m loving it although I’ve bought an iPhone 8 Plus... This one I gotta have it... Peace out!
You seem to get the coolest things...
lets asking the important questions first how you got 1,200 $ :D
The phone simply wow and the accessories are amazing. But thinking whether this phone comes to India or not.
You are quite comfortable with your feet all out on your knee in the thumbnail lol ??.
ROG phone Feels Loser because of Razer Phone 2 and xiaomi Black shark melo 2 that is 10 gb ram and 845 Sd
Dude don't ever wear shorts again, or you're gonna be mrwhosthewolfman
This is a gaming phone. NO!! This is an ULTIMATE GAMING PHONE! ??????????
Lucky guy
The design is so great with a lot of personality.
I love the way the suitcase comes into the video :D
Love it, they actually gave Android users a headphone jack, not 1 but 2 charging ports, many, many features... great phone overall, I did not quite catch the storage size and the availability of an SD card for storage expansion, probably 128GB storage and a yes for the SD Card, but no sure, could you tell me? It will also be great to know the price.
I want to implore you for making this unboxing video not silent and boring at the beginning. You kept dialogue going throughout the video and kept us engage quite well. Great unboxing video, especially for how much you unboxed yet the video is still short.
I don't no ??
NAME OF THE LAST SONG PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE
Watching the video from my ROG
Yes! So ridiculous that it has horrible ping in online gaming. Doesn't give more time on gaming than the Oneplus 6. I have both rog phone and Oneplus 6. And in online gaming performance, Oneplus beats rog phone! If you want great screen on the cost of ping, then rog phone is the best. But if you want great gaming experience with low ping, then go for the Oneplus! If reviewer have these 2 phones, then try to play arena of Valor on both. Then you will see that rog has horrible wifi and lte antenna.
You have great videos. Can i have the bag of ROG?
Needs 1440p
XoXo <3
Amazing . Give me the phone please
Every time he says "rog" instead of R-O-G, I die a little inside
????
It's not ROCK phone it is R O G. P. S what's the outro song?
Man, can you, please, tell me or maybe do a video about the Google Pixel XL, and if is worth it, considering that it's almost 2019? It will be a massive help for my decision.
You kinda sound like a robot in this video (Not Trying to he rude)
when you go and Google it's price welp gonna be a while till I get this phone
Do a camera test of the Asus ROG phone vs the Razor Phone 2 vs the Xiaomi Black Shark Helo
Amazing! Plz make full review of the phn
Does the suitcase come with the phone? Or do you have to buy it separately?
Awesome and outrageous phone I really like asus phone even without other accessories
I'm buying it. I have a little bit of a Linux fetish and that 8Gb RAM and 3 USB ports is looking pretty nice.
Looks fantastic. How are the camera's
Bulge galore!
"when acer sent me a email..." but the ROG is asus right??
"Simple pleasures" of suitcase full of free stuffs!
Sick phone, but I just want that suitcase.
You explain everything i need to know
Great review Arun!
Great review Arun!
Amazing job Asus... that's really impressive
Most amazing video of all time
Insane ??
Definitely wanting to get one.
Way too much for mobile gaming
How much is that phone
Man I wish I had that
This Asus ROG phone looks more appealing then the Razer 2 #IMHO!
GIVE IT TO ME!!!I NEED ONE!!!
You get all of this for the price of a cheap iPhone??
The phone is bad ass.
Really cool and all... But WHY? Playing a game on a tiny phone screen is the equivalent to watching a movie on a laptop.. or phone... Just not meant to be with 38" monitors and 65" TV's being common.
Dang they went all out with this phone??
Those legs are RIDICULOUS
So much packaging ??
This is such an amazing mobile to get and it's also my dream ??
I'm now surprisingly interested in this phone
Why is it so ridiculous.I don't understand ,can you Explain......????
is this phone built for human being ?
Just wow
Still awesome start on the amazing video
He said acer once??
Love You Baby ??????????
?
Well that's a great unboxing
there a link on how much it is and to buy?!
But can it run crysis ?
Very cool concept with an excellent phone but just like the Red Hydrogen these overpriced accessories are almost useless..
Can't wait to play snake at 60fps on it.
He's so well spoken
Will there be a full review?
I ?? ROG Phone
love this phone but how much does it cost
Woah I really want that asus rog phone and I would be satisfied if I had it??
sexy legs
Price please
How much?
ASUS ROG vs Mate 20 X
Pretty dope
It's really a cool phone
oh man the twinview is so cool
Overkill.
Do you need 2 phones for the dual screens?
That was awesome so glad I watched this wish I had some cash to buy this and open it in front of friends just to watch them go green with envy
I want one.....with ALL of these accessories!! Great video Arun.
What's the full cost for all that stuff?
Gaming phones are a scam.
Red dead 2 ??
I'm only here to hear his accent xD ??
Great video man ?? keep up the good work ????
I have an iPhone XS so I’m good. A very simple phone, that shit looks complicated
What a phone! ?? I wanna have it.
Hey what about a speed test between pixel3,note9 &6t..
Man I must say you have a gifted voice .. literally by hearing your voice I feel like buying the phone ;) Keep up the good work ;)
I'll be very simple It's amazing but Android games don't deserve such product
Overpriced for what you get snapdragon 855 next year
Cool video man
Pretty Cool phone!
looks like the future. I want all but unfortunately couldn't afford all.
Background music is lit ????
I believed it was ridiculous just by looking at the thumbnail,but after watching the video i must say,ASUS knew the best person for the job,whostheboss killed it!
i love your voice, i have no interest in this phone but just like hearing you talk
If you smell....... What the ROG is cooking!
Could u jst tell me whr to buy it
I want this set
The quality of videos you make are getting to a whole new level, Hope that you become the best some day, in the world of reviewers. ??
Would you fuck me? I would fuck me. I would fuck me SOO hard!
I need this phone before I die!!
I literally watch all your videos and always wait till to end for that good music.
So cool
great quality but man please reduce the cuts.. it's becoming tiring and less intuitive.
Stop pronouncing the name wrong.
This Asus package is off the hook I'm getting one cuz
I'm loving the design of the smartphone
THIS WAS A BOSS VIDEO
Damn??????????
Is made out of panda?
It's a mammoth phone. Not for me. Just a little over the top.
WHAT?! This is amazing. I can't believe it. Going to Asus website ASAP. Thanks for the video. Just insane!
What the hell is ROG? It's R O G (Republic of Gamers) The way he said it....... ??
What a soft voice and music! Really peaceful video. I felt really good after watching it!
It would be great if you could make a detailed video of all the accessories with pros and cons
MAN I WANT THAT
It's not ROG IT'S R O G
I absolutely love it! That said, if I refuse to pay 1k+ for a Max there's no way on earth I'm buying it, plus all the accessories.
Looks like they went all out this time
What is that outro song at the end?
Background music name please
Love this video man!! Keep it up.
Gaming setups are nothing without good games, hopefully mobile game developers step it up a notch after this phone ????
Just "Wow" is the only word that comes out when I see or hear about this beast with beauty. Truly appreciated
when are u planning a Meetup in INDIA
THE NAME OF THE OUTRO SONG, PLS, ANYONE?
Great video as always... But I am not sure why I cringed every time you said Rog Maybe I am used to R.O.G. Other products from Asus uses R.O.G. and not Rog
Unit?
The best unboxing of this phone. Congrats!
Why dont people say the same shit about IPhone?
Give a full review
Rog phone is R.O.G dont continue the word
? it... ?
Pgl ho gaya h Asus
??
This is the hell of an unboxing ! I'm sure Lewis is seriously gealous of you!
Imagine carrying your phone with a suitcase
Damn you are a lucky guy.. i want those ....!!!
??????
Hope that ppl r not gonna use it to play clash of clans or temple run..
wow, a glimpse of many possible things to come. really like it
Hw much
Like it before watching fam !!
Insanity!
I am getting mine tomorrow. I wish the accessories are available here in the US already! I want the dual screen!
I am jealous because I'm not that rich.. ???? Impossible type dream for me ????
Impressive
Phone made by Aliens ??, RIDICULOUS!
Just send it to me????
Is the cooooooooooolest??
Those accessories are really simmilar to the switch
Asus has done a great job!
Hey, what happened to the OnePlus 6t review ? I've been waiting for your opinion. I love your content.
ASUS is cleanly making a commitment to gaming and user experience. I applaud them for that :-)
time has come to call mobile phone players are "GAMERS". Nice...
This actually looks good. Lol
So now you can be a hardcore casual gamer I guess?
Your voice is heart touching !!??????
But can it run flappy bird?
Bro how much the phone is
More ports than the Macbook
This video was amazing. Loved the shots and the cinematography. The phone with all of those accessories is definitely for those who truly love mobile gaming to the fullest. Keep up the excellent work.
anyone else feels weird when arun said ROG instead of R O G?
Shut up and take my money
Imagine the suitcase got stolen ????????
??
Damn, ASUS aren't messing around when they make a gaming phone.
Cool Video Mate. Keep it going...
Fantastic dude
Loved this video... Did not know ASUS was so serious about this phone!
please tell the epidemic sound name please tell anyone
Well titled video. I’m not sure who this is all for but it was cool!
can you in 78 hours later do a tips and trick for this the Asus phone
how much all this??? (Phone+ accessory)
i see a lot of phone review on your channel,but this one,i cant hold to say it to you but...plz giveaway that.. that would be so cool :))
Awesome
*R.O.G
That thumbnail was different.
this phone is an overkill
Just wondering, is that pronounciation of ROG correct? ??
Ponte zapatos, wn!
are behenchod!!
wo khaty han na unchu dikn pekha pakwn
How much all accessories and the phone cost sir??plz anyone
price bro
accessories are more awesome than phone..
Asus packaging and presentation is awesome
Whaaao.......unbeliveble!!!!
This is something crazy????????
Like for a great phone by the gaming company
Great
I eagerly waited for full unboxing of asus rog device with all his device attachment and which i gotted here thanks sir for great unboxing #i wish if can get one for me??????
The AI Robert is back love your voice bro ???? Love from India ?
Dam, TBH. I am salty I didn't wait for this. I was going to wait for it, then the Razer Phone 2 beat them to release, and I pulled the trigger. Can't believe the phone is only 100 bucks more.
This phone has everything I need But I don't have anything to buy it
I guess it's the best assus rog phone unboxing on YouTube.
This phone is unbelievable. It's Terminator 2 look is for me a five star. I don't need air light device. I like sturdiness and durability.
Best ever gaming phone
Guessing 3000 $ for all of that
This is redicules in a VERY GOOD WAY
Wow, this looks like a gamer's dream! Great job Asus. And great review Mrwhosetheboss. So satisfying :)
Late.
Hey Arun. Nice video. Can you please do a camera test between ASUS ROG PHONE , BLACK SHARK 2 AND RAZER PHONE 2
Lol, samsung dock got just so dead by ASUS! Kudos to ASUS!
Its R. O. G not rog????
But Can it run Crysis 3...?
Nice video looking foword to you future video
I should be building a gaming pc, so why on Earth am I watching this super tempting gaming phone review?
I'm an iPhone user and this and Oppo Find X are the only phones that would make me consider switching to Android.
and that's why i love Asus
it is amazing
I don't think this time ur video has done justice to the Asus gadgets
Gymshark once again :o
release date????
When is apple coming out with their gaming phone? ??
I would rather buy a PS4
Oh my god very nice
Well to game on a tiny screen this games that suck ass id rather buy me a PS4 for way less
Wow
Good video.... 18:9 please
Didn't expected a video today??but was happy to see that,that Asus phone is so ridiculous?? those accessories are little confusing which one to use??too many of em,any way that's a Beast??.And @mrwhosetheboss the last two videos had an amazing and variety starting/intro of U??
Damn!
Really it's incredible for such a gaming phone
Free fire wallpaper lol??
Ending song please,
How much is this total?
best vdo
how much would all that kit set you back? twas most definitely interesting
Phone for gamers rocking a 10nm Snapdragon 845 which can’t even manage to beat last years A11 chip by Apple OMEGALUL
this is better than my gaming pc
How have you got the nicest voice in the world
You should wear more shorts so we could see your sexy legs
Amazing stuff by Asus
wow thats too much ??
Press O to start
super satisifying!!!
????? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? 3310 ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ???? ??? ????? ???? ??????.....?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??? ???? ??
Finally a phone that looks different than the 100 other phones which launched this year.
What is the background music?
This is just ?????????? and is better than any other Gaming smartphones out there!
1:26 im so tilted of that dirty screen lol. Anyway good video my dude.
Ur voice bro ??
By hearing that sigh, pretty much sure that you are not going to use that phone. Give to me, I will treat her as my girlfriend.
I like your style.
Anyone heard in the UK that Xiaomi are retailing the MiA2 and Mi8 Lite for £1?!?! Like if you want one of them for such a low price
That phone is amazing
I see u trying some ASMR by krincling the papers like that ... I SEE THAT MR WHOSE YOUR BOOUSS
I need this but don't know why
This is perfect for my temple run.
It's R-O-G not rog
meanwhile iphone barely has 1 port :D
Loved the start..!!??try doing it more often ????
Imagine casually getting emails from huge companies asking to send you their latest phones
I think I'm okay with the honor play ????
I need a new phone to play pubg 'cause it lags so much on my redmi 3s prime but this ROG phone is overkill but I'll take it anyways. And the video was very satisfying as always. Quick and informative no mumbo jumbo. ??
i want all of that
Brooo i am very big fan of you ????????????????????????
Sexy to a whole new level. U and the phone alike.
This seems slightly overkill, ill just go for ASUS Zenfone 5z, which no popular tech youtuber has review ????
This phone is overkill
Can we have an camera Samples... Because I am planning to but this phone Thanks
How much does it cost?
Note..it's a 30 watt charger
Rog phone is something I don't think is necessary the note 9 is way better in my opinion as it has the same 845 processor. I understand the cooling and controls but I don't think gaming phones as extreme as the rog phone is necessary. The razer phone 2 does it just right by not going too extreme.
Awesome unboxing ????
Please subcribe his channel its just awesome??????
Lol what's with the shorts in the thumbnail it looks like you wore your pajamas and shot that photo before going to sleep ??
lamo i got the razer phone add
Not to mention it has 0.1response rate
Give ..me.plzzz???? ??????
Good for gaming
uk release date and who is doing contracts?
This phone is way better than that Samsung foldable phone imo. I’m an Apple user/fanboy/sheep and this phone looks amazing.
Pretty sure its pronounced R-O-G not rawg, but good video.
I think that this is what the razer phone shouldve been, instead of just a flat squared black chunk with a usb c port
By a huge margin, the best presentation of a phone. Would be amazing if every buyer would recieve that.

True Dope Tech??
Squeeze? I've seen that before.
Hi sir
Wow amazing Rog phone n assoeries wow amazing I wish I have all of it
This phone is dope I just love asus. ?? damnn
PRICE ??
Ridiculoussssssssss ????????????
Does pubg mobile sponsor you Cause u always use pubg mobile to check or display gaming footage
Too bad the Snapdragon 855 comes out in a few months.... this phone is already pretty much outdated...
Overall, best unboxing on ROG phone and its accessories, didn't even know that the peripherals are inside a suitcase ON WHEELS. How I wish to get that. OwO
Still anyone who is complaining about companies still need to pay more attantion to gaming phone..??
Its a 30 watt charger, but still a great video keep it up
Dream phone but I can't afford it
Seeing them supporting a phone like this is what will make people want this phone tho. Literally the polar opposite of the RED phone.
You can't be this hot. Damn bro
This is real innovation.
Are the ancessories free or you had bought them separetly?
Ok you pro gamers this is the phone for you
Super beast gamming phone.
This is very weird, im getting Austin Evans's ultimate setup kinda thing in this video..everything is so over the top :D
Can play GTA 5 with it!?
I want that phone!
As overkill as it is, it's still cheaper than the note 9 or iPhone Xs Edit: Of course the price will be much higher if you plan on getting any of the accessories
Never wanted a suitcase more. Now THAT is a beautiful suitcase with AWESOME accecories????
I love it!! I wishSamsung did this with their note 9 or the upcoming note 10, it would be insane having so many gadgets.
Best video of Phone unboxing ??
Love the video
Do you play free fire?
Completely satisfying video...??
rubbish
"Looks like you have to have 2 of them" but they are 2 ??????
Mate 20 X
wow that's a lot. massive unboxing. more power sir
Him vs zack from jerry rig should compete for the next google assistant voice!
... When Asus goes nuts... ??
plz help me...note 9 or Asus ROG...? plz ????
We are getting trash like this and wondering why Diablo Immortal exists.
Too bad the mobile game industry is still a joke. For now I'm only using my game pc and PlayStation 4
Guess who all are watching this Ya those who can't afford it ...
Nice mobile
2.9 GHz? Holy shit it still amazes me how fast technology moves I think the i5 8300h in my nitro 5 laptop is only 2.3 GHz base clock! Crazy world we are living in.
Bro you are awesome
i would love to have that luggage. even if its still empty i could use that for my laptop and shirts
Wow fuck this guy
The music you used in this video is amazing!
wow
Huawei p20 and mate 20 Pro are better
Crazy! Asus gone mad with this! Wow!
Dude, you need to up your thumbnail game.
Behemoth of a package... THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
I will buy that phone for sure.... If they give that suitcase filled with those modules ??
Bro plz reply what is ur background music plz bro and happy Diwali
Asus is just not building a gaming phone, it's creating a gaming ecosystem. This is why it stands out in the gaming phone segment.
Superb yrr
HOLY SHIZZZZ <3 JUST LOOKING AT IT MAKES YOU ORGASM. MAKES ME WANT TO BUY ONE RT
Asus nailed it
I shouldn't have watched this, now I'm jealous.
Yeah you can chuck loads of crappy addons with the phone but let's not forget the main purpose of the video is to promote the ROG phone which is a bag of shit and looks ugly as hell.....
Banned for pubg... that's practically cheating
I'm sorry but I still cannot understand who games THAT intensely on their phones that they would rather not have a good camera or an actual good looking software but have this "bonkers" of a phone! I never understood who gaming phones are for... not ONE person I've seen games this intensely on their phone to justify the 200+ weight that comes with it! Or the extreme price tag.
Awesome
I'm not a gamer, and at first I thought this was ridiculous ... but it looks amazing and I do want it. I don't know what use I would give it though
Can it fold tho?
??on?? #asusROG #arun . best unboxing ever. ??
Completely nailed it
Why i am watching these????
THAT PANT ??
This is insane
Why doesnt google hire your voice? I would have used bixby if it had your voice :)
Background Sound....?? Source??
Tv name plz
How much is it?
Arun please! It is pronounced as Asus R-O-G phone. (I paused the video to type this comment so if you get to know about it later in the video then sorry)
A serious gaming phone ever
Ill be choosing the mate 20x. Bigger screen(7.2inch) bigger battery(5,000Mah) and a faster K980. And its cheaper with camera specs of mate 20 pro.:)
I just love gaming on phone but don't wanna go with rog phone but like the mate 20 pro bec camera is my main concern... Hope to see mate 20 pro gaming performance
The most satisifiying thing i have ever seen
Wow
Please one give me
I like Asus brand
Nice, no one needs tht many docks tho lol
This is whole new level
Arun please come to India for collaboration.......
This gamer focused design that I hate on laptops looks great on a phone. Asus definitely made the best gaming phone. I wish Sony would enter the game and make an Xperia Playsation Pro. Only the fact that it plays PS and Vita games would put all the other gaming phones to shame. Except... If Valve makes a Steam Phone that plays PC games. Now that would be incredible
What a hell of a gears.
This video deserved likes. Asus ROG phone is so dope ??. Thank you sir for the video. Fall in love with asus.
ROG phone vs Mate 20X speed test ?
Such a confusing device . ROG did not dine its product well ...... How many gamers will be willing to play on a small screen when you can just plug it on the big screen ?? ... Mobile ... Defeats the purpose
Apple cant do that????
TBH I doubt anybody would buy all those accessories. It's like all of them are made for Asian gamers.
The accessories were epic! Asus did a great job
How you guys get the free phone
Bro your voice is so damn amazing Really it's cool ??
much better than mate20
This is insane ??
Do you get to keep that stuff ? Even the suit case was pretty freaking cool I want one
But they forgot a VR headset
That looks absolutely awesome, it’s a gamers dream, Not something I’d go for unless I had lots of money to waste, Asus make great gaming stuff
Best Unboxing ever
Outro song?
How much does it cost in total ????????
ROG> Razer Phone 2
You are my hero
ABSOLUTE UNIT
Phone & video both are great.
that's the wildest ROG Phone review I ever seen. Carry on Arun You're the best
Can I run temple run on it???????
I'm in love with it lol I love to see a company put this kind of effort forward.
This is the only phone which I liked a lot by its looks ! Beastly and Unique phone.. If the front display was more attractive and more in resolution I would have thought of purchasing it !
Can’t handle this . Who needs this . People are not mad to spend so much after just gaming ! Are they earning more than bill gates or Jeff bezoz by gaming
Don't see the point of a gaming phone.. Most games are meh.. Unless they start dropping AAA titles then.... Well... ??
Had to slam the box down. Ahh the life of a Big popular youtuber.. If the product breaks..... Oh well there is more where that comes from.
Cool
Damn those speakers are quite juicy
50 iPhone sheep disliked this video. It shows how blah their rehashed phone is.
Keep on growing
This is a lot....????
#BossStyle
#LikeaBoss
I hope the next rog phone still keeping the same look as the 1st one..so we need to buy and upgrade the phone only..and all the accessories still can be used on the new device..instead of upgrade the entire set..this can be promising mobile gaming rig..
Just imagine my OnePlus 6 runs pretty cool enough without extra cooling ??
Asus????????
Yeah his voice is still chill.. ?????
Jab money ho to sab ridiculous hi lagta hai
A wonderful package!
Why can't gaming phones look normal? This looks like it came out of aliens ass. It looks like it's meant for a 12 year old's cool factor.
Plz give package link
R. O. G. Not ROG
How much did it cost? With all accessories.
Id buy it
so jealous. such a phenomenal unboxing
Just buy console or PC tho if u gonna that much money on this stuff
Just over the top stuff
While im here watching random new flagship/gaming phone using my samsung j1 :'c Ps: i have a job and im pretty much into new phones but my salary was not enough to buy a new one. Ps:yes im saving money but that was for the mother of my incoming child :) Pss:up this maybe someone will give me even a rusted old phone but can run pubg lol ??
Thanks for the detailed review of ROG full package!
wish i had money to get one
But you did cushion the fall of the smaller box with that mattress ??
Your videos are addictive #mrwhosetheboss
I bought this phone not because I wanted to play games on it. I bought it because of all the cool features it has and felt it is the most advanced smartphone on the market.
Makes sense!
Superb
#WOW
Niche or not gamer phones seems to have their share in market as even Samsung rumoured to make one.i think we'll be seeing more of them. And the fact that phone games make ridiculous profits all of game companies want a piece of it. Future gaming - phone gaming
Asus making great forgetting background
Amazing vedio bro....
i actually can how i would use every accesory shown but it just makes no sense to pay for it , probably cost around 5000 usd for everything
Pls compare rog phone vs razer phone 2 vs black shark helo??
The best phone I have ever seen in my life.m with all type of accessories. It's a beast. I would really luv to buy this phone. I
ROG Gaming review pannuga
Grateful Unboxing bro.
I'm speechless.
That's a gaming phone ??
How an iPad Pro 12.9 inchs cant even fits a headphone jack while Asus ROG Phone has 2! FREAKING TWO HEADPHONE JACK!
just WOW!
I will buy this after 29 years when my budget matches its price.
Am i the only one not skipping the outro music , it's so awesome
Let me know ur background music... Wow what a unboxing yaaaa it's cooler than air-conditioning
I jealous. Seriously... Those accessories are amazing..
Love your videos & your outro
The question is How much?
I have the phone it's awesome I want to get a couple of the accessories I just can't afford it.
Did he really sigh at the end of the video
Hi, i m a small blogger and I write about tech and gadgets. Can I embed ur video with my review of Asus Rog phone? My contacts: manasmdg3@gmail.com admin@nextdeskguy.com
To be honest nothing on the whole god damn appstore is worth to be played on this. No AAA quality exclusive titles, every thing is either a shitty clone or a PC port and riddled with stupid ass microtransactions. PUBG Mobile? more like Asian Cheating Grounds Mobile....
3ds+switch+samsung dex
Asus is great as brand, but i don't still understand these gaming phones.. Just nah
Still couldn't beat Mate 20 pro which is not even a gaming phone (Antutu)
The only thing I hate about these videos is the factthat he is almost kissing a microphone when he talks and adds so much base to his voice and when there is a room talk with microphone right on your ears its so unnatural...
Well i would say its just AWESOME
........And then we have iPhone Xs Max with out a fast charger or lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter....... The world we live is really wierd!!!!!??
I've always liked Asus phones. This is a whole new level though.
After a long time the massive unboxing on Boss style
Arun you are as cool as the ROG phone is
I have never seen gaming phones as more than a marketing joke but this video makes me think otherwise. Asus's efforts are evident from all the different accessories they have prepared for different scenarios. I personally wouldnt ever have thought to ever consider using a non samsung apple lg phone but this phone has caught my interest. Awesome video from start to finish.
I got my rog phone november 7th and it's totally awesome! best phone I've ever had.
Gimmick trash, and you unbox fuckboys eat it up.
Dude it's "R.O.G" not rog
is this an out of season april fools joke? who needs a gaming phone like this? what games require specs anywhere near this? if you say emulators then why are you not supporting those companies and buying their systems instead of overpaying for a phone?
That really is a beast!!
Awesome!
bro please give me the phone..i wanted to review it bro plsss
Too much dop Tech bro
I like the idea of using it as a computer on a big screen like the Samsung Dex. I really think that's where the industry should move too.
who wears a hoodie over a boxer at home???
i thought you almost dropped it at the beginning
hey buddy howu dooin???????
what's that outro music?
Gaming on phones doesn't exist. Just remember the applause last time Blizzard introduced mobile game. 95% are cash grabs.
Awesome video man. I saw other videos on the rouge phone. It's definitely a sick piece of tech. I liked the accessories you showed off as well. It shows that Asus really took the time to make a solid device not just for gamers but other techies as well.
For that price you can get a budget phone, laptop, and a gaming pc!
the unbox therapy done right??
If phones can start playing dota2, then I will buy a gaming phone, untill then camera, screen and design are what I'm looking for.
Dont tell me this phone comes with all this accessories ?
Awesome
What are some good mobile games that actually make it worth it to buy a device like this? Just curious
Twinview is awesome! I love this phone! #RepublicofGamers
?? ???????, ?????? ! ????????
Yeah, it's the rock phone. CAUSE IT'S ROCKS.
Soundtrack at the end of the video please?
It's Really Ridiculous...????????????
you need to stop doing that pouting shit with ur lips on thumbnail u bencho
Man but that amount of stuff is overkill like what the....
Damn. Why it looks like the phone and all the accessories are at least $3000.... It looks awesome but not at this price points... Not for mobile gaming. I can buy a kick-ass laptop for that or better yet, build a banging pc and a console.
Ridiculous commenting here
Cool!
7:11 don't forget the 3.5 Jack
I love this bit 7:04
You shouldnt say roge . Pronounce the letters like ROG
If I buy rog phone ...will I get the second box as well with the phone??
Osm arun
lucky you... or do you have to...do you???
@7:04 ..??
Man did you pay for all those items ???
I like the first dock but it misses VGA and card reader....... Do you know any cheap USB C desktop mobile dock with RJ45, card reader, VGA, HDMI, Two or more standard USB 3.0 and one USB C charging port? If so please share the link.
This is great looking phone, and it may be quite Expensive as like IPhone.
That moment when this guy makes a waayyyy better unboxing video than unbox therapy has made for the last couple months if not even longer
Can you give me plz
Rog ??
hello boss giveaway me one this phone to play the game PUBG
Can we buy the phone case separately?
Can you do the Razer Phone 2 later?
Wow, this was epic, well done. I feel this hasn't been covered enough by reviewers
this is so extra
And you didn't say anything about the battery size
In need to know where to get both the suitcase and phone pls
Watching in my Rog phone.??
The thumbnail tho??
I want this just to say I have it
Bang! I'm saying about the video and content presented in a soothing way. Would you kindly tell the price of that phone including the accessories (the suitcase)... Waiting for your answer
How much is this Asus phone? Are all these accessories easily available.
It's a beast of a phone specs wise, I think the only drawback could be the camera.
Now there are two ways to play pubg free on pc: one is you use the Rog phone to connect to the pc while the second is to use MSI app center to connect to an msi pc
I wish Rog phone has AI assistant with Arun's voice
Never thought that ASUS would give this much of importance for phone accessories. Great video to understand what is going around the mobile tech world.
Cool accessories, hope Samsung does something like this to make their phones more 'gaming' with accessories like this in the future... especially since they're trying to push it with the debut of the Note9 and Fortnite.
I got the new Razer for my son who's a big gamer and has the Razer laptop. We returned the phone. Unacceptably hot when the cpu and fps is cranked up. Definitely getting him this. This is a real gamers phone. Will definitely get him the dock with the additional screen too. This will destroy Razer sales. It's a real winner! ??????
wtf
1300$
-No notch -Has a headphone jack
In simple words. Awesome ??????
Mrwhosetheboss on tv 0:06 ??
Lew's gonna love that. Hah!
Great vid mate
That john wick wallpaper please
Ah mate, fancy just sending me that stuff? It's everything I've ever wanted in a phone!
Wow! It's so amazing phone.. I love it....
Your thumbnails are RIDICULOUS fucking annoying
Am I the only one around here who thinks gaming on a touchscreen is horrible for most genres of games? I just want physical controls... 90hz+ is nice to have but please get your priorities straight. Make great games and smooth controls first.
Just a question when you buy the rog phone thus those other things go with it for free?
Bro send me down the rog to janipur, jammu ,jammu and kashmir ,india plz
That's loud
Please do a battery comparison.
Quality content from the boss as usual. ????
Can't afford them
Does rog support 5g and when will it launch in India . I want it to be future proof for 5g network . PLEASE TELL
There is no such a fuckin gaming phone. Its only a gimmick . Gaming pc is still the way to go.
Damn im poor
they forgot to supply a VR headset in the luggage
Bruh, i dont wanna be awkward but can you at least get some pants
Camera comparison? Rog vs black shark vs razer?
This phone is great but what is the cost
Asus has really worked a lot.
Wow talk about an early Christmas present!
Are You Rich Or Are You Kidding me ????????
The real question is “why is he using a VSS???” ???????? @ 5:54 and 6:30
Should have given a VR headset along.
This is some out of the world, non essential, overkill product and i LOVE it. Sorry Razer and Xiaomi but this is the best gaming phone in the market right now.
Iteqd buy a $5000 pc or a gaming laptop saving a lot of money
The black is everywhere,there is awesome man ??????
This video is super satisfying!
Price ? 200k ??
Do the batery test with and without the twinthing
Niche... are you serious!.... OK yes it is a bit niches... but If I had the cash... nothing else would get a look in... Always been an Asus fan, now a ROG fan, and this has got to be the best phone and accessory package EVER.
Another animal....
Nice...& cool...
I can hardly afford the ROG phone and the boss gets everything for free, I presume. Lol. Costs 1.6K SGD in Singapore..... I can get a decent laptop for that money.
AWWWWESOME ?? OPENING THE SUITCASE. ALWAYS LIKED YOUR VIDEO BEFORE WATCHING...?????? ASUS ROG SMARTPHONE ??
They went overboard is just an understatement of the century ??????????????????
THIS IS A NEW KIND OF VIDEO...LIKE....THE WAY U STARTED
So, ASUS was able to put 2 USB ports and a headphone jack in the phone. Now im just feeling cheated by other companies. ??
How much for all the stuff ?
Thumbnail was far more ridiculous!
Dream phone..
Asus went all in.
No it is not... Still watching...
I wish I could like this video a thousand times
Asus brings phones to next level.
How was the camera on asus rog phone
most redicleous phone
I think this is only for gamer
This is game of thrones.. From season 1 to season 9..??????
Seeing your leg hair isn't something I thought I would want to see
Excellent video, Arun! So many accessories! Really digging the design of the phone!
??????
Can someone tell me how many kidneys i need for this whole bundle
Mahn, this was one of the best video. RoG phone, does not have Corning Gorilla Glass 6, while it has a 30W charger.
I enjoyed the video. sooooo where do I get one? ..........Winner chicken dinner!
On the Top Screen, i will Watch Mia khalifa getting pounded. On the bottom screen,i will watch how to stop Masterb***
Best gaming phone
That photo tho hairy af have some hygiene for god sakes
Jesus Christ that's a massive overkill of a product. Why would anyone buy that?
Last one
Whoa...! the phone is...priced to it's worth...!
Unboxing in shorts BOSSSTYLE
it’s kinda overkill in my opinion lol just buy a ps4 or switch
Mrwhosetheboss, You need to change your ending soundtrack asap, its just... terrible. I mean that "la lalalala, e e a a a a...". Its extremely annoying.
Price ???
can you do a giveaway of it
Scrolling through the comments, I DID see you offered a slightly wordier Opinion. You should have been equally succinct within your review. Many of the commenters may miss your latter comments. JaneLee ^_^ ???? 11/9/18 7:53 AM
Aaron you forgot the little fan that comes with it!
If only I had money...
looks cool!
Arun is the best PUBG player
But can it run Minecraft?
Wow super box..
What mobile game it can't handle???
Real question though, why would anyone buy this when they can get a really good gaming PC for the same price?
Nenek
Best Subiltitles' Image..
That thumbnail made me lose No Nut November (no homo tho)
These are all the future of a gaming smartphone!!! Wow!
My most fave mrwhosetheboss intro. ??
I can feel that my kidneu cant afford that.
Why did Asus send their Asus Rog phone in a suitcase that's actually hilarious????????????
We've seen the 845 being put into the first laptops and since it is strong enough for that, smartphones are entering the field of portable computer. Rog is treating its phone as if it can be something like the Nintendo switch. I actually believe that smartphones have a chance of replacing consoles, and if none of the console companies get aboard the ship now they might not be able to get into the mobile gaming market. Remember how the switch also overclocks as soon as you hit the dock? Well, the rog phone gives me an impression it is working towards being a switch, but from the smartphone side rather than the console side. The docks etc. Are a little overkill now, sure, but imagine what the future might hold.
I adore these live wallpapers, I wish more phones would have wallpapers like this
That lot would probably costs hundreds, if not a thousands!! ???? Great! But probably well out of the reach of average gamers, price wise
That thumbnail is so lit
That was some serious unboxing I've seen till date ,,,
Please give link for that blue phone wallpaper at start with the guy shooting
oh i love the phone not the price..??
Too much investment for a single gaming device.
Mobile gaming: Asus>rest. Enough said.
Hearing you say "absolute unit" in that silky smooth voice is something I didn't know I wanted
So nobody is going to comment about how this man is saying ROG?
That was badass!
I can't afford that coz im poor :(
I liked just for those hairy legs???????? No homo guys...??
Nothing better than coming home from Sixth Form and watching your videos ??
You're the hardest working YouTuber, greatly appreciate your amazing work, thanks
The best gaming phone on earth
You > UboxTherapy
Nice toes
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooobrother!
now you can Diablo immortal like a switch!
Now dis is a beast
Dam I wish I could afford that phone because I love gaming but I don't have the money
That's so insane. A gaming phone plus all the goodies. Does buying the phone means you get all the accessories for free? JK! I knowwww, imagine how much quid I need to spend in order to own the entire set. Just WOW!
What happened to the 18:9 Aspect ratio videos? Why did you shift to 16:9?
best smartphone unboxing till date that i have seen
uwu
This is the perfect gaming smartphone, too many accesories that you must use.
Whoa. I want this phone!!????????
Holy moly
You're smashing it bro, that phone is on my radar.
I wish i had this??
link of that sweetshirts plz ?
But can it run Honkai Impact 3 at max settings on a 4K TV and is the control/display latency good enough that you can perfectly time dodges in that game.
Whats the title of your background dance atbthe end of your vlog?
Now thats too cool..but im wondering how much is it?xD
Asus really loves you mrwhosetheboss ??
If I gamed I'd rather her than the Razor 2. The options available!
4:51 the speaker was soo loud and clear that I thought you were actually speaking ontop of the speaker audio lol
Hey Hey Hey ! Working out huh? Gymshark!
Woao
Awesome just love this
Do youtubers get all this stuff for free ??
A headphone jack. Fuck yeah :p
Hi
How many insane guys r really buying that phone??? Xiiii
007 James Bond vibe here. I'm absolutely geeking out about this over-the-top product presentation and accoutrements. I want it only because it's a suite of devices that look bada^^. More than functional applications, it is a work of art. I'd display the whole line, just for the cool factor.
Hi early squad
Holy shit that thing looks beatiful
Amazing video as usual. Keep it up, Arun.
Take my kidney....
Build Quality of Asus?? Just like your Videos ?? Give me some likes??
Ridiculous for sure
Great
Something i would wish for this Christmas
A magnificent masterpiece!

Real gamers don't play on phones
Holy ficking shit!!!
NOFITICATION SKUAD WHER YU AT!?
1.design of phone 2.squeeze to enter X-mode 3.secondary screen ??????????????????????????
That is one kick-ass phone I mean I am into tech and have been since 87, but this is simply wild. How does the rest of the phone stack up to the others like camera or battery and so on?
Notification squad!!
jus wow!
Can us customers find that amazing suitcase to buy too?
Pubg lovers hit like ??
Android combined with the power of mobile GPUs, increase Ram, and cost of phones these days. This is what I imagine phones should be or taking us IMO. Add Windows support with mouse and keyboard. Sprinkle a PSN or Xbox Network like Gaming Experience. And go yourself the future.
GIVEAWAY THAT PLEASE??????????
ROG??nice review. Not just one box it two on this week??i truly happy to see ROG. Mrwhosetheboss got all the accessories for the phone. Btw keep it up Mrwhosetheboss??i truly love your video??
I love it...not ridiculous at all....some of us don't fancy all those camera comparisons and would rather have a gaming phone!!!! ACtually I haven't watched smartphone comparisons for quite a while. It always comes back to the camera and frankly I don't care about daytime, night time shots, noise(whatever the hell that may be)....but this is different. And a chunky phone which you can really hold.
Thats suitcase though! And nothing to about the four speaker combination power ( dope). I think all the gaming phone manufacturing company should follow this and include this amount of accessory for their gaming lineup smartphones. This turn turn a mobile gaming experience into more fun. Loved the video. I wish mkbhd also have made this kind of video ??
how much is this phone anyways?
Did you say ACER at 0:24 ??
Please give us a separate full review of the phone
Insane????
Better than IPhone XR
I see my next phone ??
I love the ROCK phone...
