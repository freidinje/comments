My GTX 960 at home will slightly outpace my GTX 1050 Ti SSC at the office, which is "VR ready" (according to my benchmark testing). That combined with my measly i7 4790 should actually be able to handle some VR applications, then, shouldn't it? Unless there's something special about the 10 series that allows the lower end cards to run VR...
get PSVR on black friday
”Sponsored by Oculus Rift” aaaaand I’m out
Remake this video after Oculus Quest. Lel
I bet I can make one for only 200#$
Why didn't you try overclocking the gtx 1050ti?
Honestly the most affordable VR systems use your phone. It just makes sense because you are already spending $600-900+ and payments distributed monthly. Not too mention 5G and cloud game streaming services... It’s also the biggest missed opportunity of the Razor phone and all the new “gaming” phones.
easiest way to VR: buy 5 euro vr glasses, download vr games on your phone and game!
I expected Linus to say no and the video end
6:18 meme review
Surprise! The VR-Ready card works in VR. Jesus wept.
I wonder what happen if linus user a Oculus Rift with a gtx 950
dat bad . coll stuf
i want it please
What the hell do you know about being on a budget???
i3 8100, and a 1060? That's the same setup I built for budget VR!!
Its called the oculus quest
Hello! Please Subscribe my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtIbYEDVcl_IlwGQ1oOkv6w/
i have whatever :) 5:00
I am glad you did the video. But I think it will be another 10 years of development till I do VR a waste of time and money at this time
Literally just decided I wanted to save up for a gpu for vr then look at my dashboard and THEY KNEW I WANTED TO BUILD A CHEAP RIG
Here in germany i buildet a 700(euro) vr pc and it runs flawlessly
MORE VR!
Great video Linus! But I would suggest getting one off of eBay for around $150(I'm thinking about getting one but I don't have a gaming PC nor the money).
"on a budget"
1060 6gb or 3gb?
The new oculus update is so shit.
Ps vr?
I have been seeing quite a few gtx 1070’s second hand for bellow £300 now, and from the pictures they arent mega dusty or anything, looking quite good actually so if you could get one of those you would be set
I have a GTX 960 :,(
Linus you explained that things had to be rendered twice, 1 for the left and 1 for the right side. what if you put 2 GPU's in? would it let the GPU's focus on 1 side each? i never paid much attention to the whole VR thing so my knowledge is like nil :p
in your list you said ASUS GTX 1060 but you showed a EVGA GTX 1060 what is it?
Been waiting for this
fx8350 with 16gb of DDR3 or hell, even 8gb of ram instead of 16 with a GTX 1060 3gb will run VR and pretty much any other game all day on high settings on a 500 dollar budget.
sooooooooo expensive maan maybe w8 for next price drop ????????
i vr gamed with an amd a10 5800k processor and a 970 windforce card with 8g of ram
Linus, did oculus also sponsor that toilet paper joke on Sony?
I'm able to play VR with a low I5 and a 960, I play Gorn and the lowest it gets to is 60 fps, a little lag in beatsaber though.
Can u test the vr minimum spec on something like dell optiplex 7010 machine? With i7 3770, 8gb ddr3 and nvdia gtx750 2gb gpu...
How about crysis in vr???
Your Vessel t-shirt lasted longer than the company.
399 USD? Laughs hysterically in European For Finland for exmple it's 449 EUR, which is 512.96 when converted to USD. Edit: fixed typo
Linus: Where's your team spirit Ivan: At Home
Now try this with the Pimax XD
I have a 2nd gen i5 and a 1050Ti , Where do i stand?
Disliking for misleading title, I expected cheap, functional alternatives to the Oculus or Vive
I had to return my oculus because of how bad the tracking was
and there is the oculus go which dose not need a pc and werks prity well in normal home play whith no touers and is arownd $399 usd.
Your obsession with sponsors at every freaking turn is getting nauseating. I'm unsubscribing
VR will really catch on once it has 2-3x the fov, 4-16x the resolution, and probably 2-3x the fps... and like half the price lol
Ryzen 3 2200g with RX 570 is the way to go for cheap VR rig. I would also grab a WMR headset for under $200. I know Linus hates WMR, but I have one amd it works just as good as a rift 95% of the time. I use a 2200g and an RX 580, but a 570 will work great for a bit cheaper.
I kinda wanted to dislike it but i ended up likening it instead cause it was interesting too (beside being a bit depressive considering is sponsored). I mean is like sponsored legit news, but news nonetheless. Obviously i expect all the things Linus said to be 100% real or it it would be a terrible shame. That said: VR is still too expansive. Normal people buys G4560 or stuff like that, not i3. They play on APU or 750Ti or 1050Ti when they live in first world. Come on. I hate VR for lots of other reason but being so damn expansive is like the top of the iceberg for me. And it is such an uninteresting technology for me. Like we had the need for more "screens" in our life. Just put a 360° screen on your head. Yeah, why not. I mean: gaming is ok, it is fun inside some limits but come on guys this is too much.
"rgb nonsense" it has finally been said. who the fuck cares about rgb, if it works i am playing a game - not looking at my distracting computer lighting...
Nice forehead mark.
Hello there...maybe a stupid question, but...is it 1060 3gb, or 1060 6gb? ....just wondering :)
Imagine getting banned on Fortnite with this for exploiting.
If the budget is Bill Gates's net worth, then yes.
Still too expensive.
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xMMTV6 https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZmxbGG 820 is my budget, and i like the small form factor look, just torn between which to get.
Sorry had to dislike this one today. Just don't like the fact Oculus is buying youtubers recently to advertise their stuff.
200 dollars is the real budget.
Your price calculation has only 8GB of RAM, yet the system specs on the page with the 1050Ti and the i3 lists 16GB of RAM (timecode 00:03:48). Since you're recommending a build based on $900 (timecode 00:04:55) does the additional 8GB make a difference?
Or you already pirated windows 10
Paid advertisement :(
building new PC apparently isn’t a budget way, especially need for new series graphic card. Please test with GTX 960 or GTX 860 instead. Current video is totally useless.
Bought my oculus in mint condition for 200 dollars. Upgraded my pc to a 4790k for 180 bucks and a RX Aurous 580 8GB for 160... I would say it’s quite possible
Heard nothing about the oculus quest...
Hey Linus I had QQ why aren’t download speeds accurate like I did the math on my rdr2 download and it should have only taken 15 minutes at 100 mb/s but it took way longer then that do you know why?
i have ryzen 5 1600 and gtx970 and hit #1 score on there for my cpu/gpu
now i know that my pc can run vr couze i have ryzen 7 and radeon red devil 8gb gpu
Linus, could you show your feet more please? even if they are VR feet, I don't mind. Maybe you could do a close up of your feet with some raw bacon on a paper plate next to the toes? thanks :)
I got an HP Windows Mixed Reality headset, it cost $200 and aside from the weird home screen, it's amazing. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are the best deal for PC VR stuff imho.
i3 8100/GTX 1060 SQUAD
"Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" Sponsored by "Oculus Rift"
I just want a VR machine to watch porn and play hentai games in it, lmao. Ok, ok. I'm only kind of kidding about that one. Obviously I'd do other things in it.
I just built a PC for VR and will be buying a rift soon. i5 8600K, GTX 1080, 16 GB of ram, and a 1TB SSD. When I get my Rift I hope it runs well.
Question who buys windows?
The main problem of VR is there are no good games for it yet so why buy it when there is nothing decent to play
Buy one of those old dell optiplex towers with an i5/i7, then buy a mini 1060, and finally buy a cheap WindowsMR headset. VR for less than $600. Thank me later.
*tries to vr on a 8y setup* well frick.
gtx 1060 is not modest
I've only used phone VR headsets before but so far my nose is too big to do it comfortably oof
This is a lie. The RGB gives you so much more performance, without it, you'd only hit 2 fps in minecraft.
Still waiting for IRL SAO
No
In what fantasy land of yours, is $1000 relative to "budget." Dude, you lost me man. Go sit on your thumb. Take your head out of your ass first, though.
Phuck facebook!
Gee linus I'm sure glad you're recommending the Intel i3 8100 over the Ryzen 1600X, you almost saved me from having 6 cores and 12 threads instead of 4 cores and 4 threads! With the same single core compute performance at the same price too! PHEW! that was close
You should have run Echo Arena ! That's a free game that needs a good system.
Howmuch time the spend to empty the toilet paper ?
I get it's sponsored and I'm sure Vive wouldn't allow this, but PSVR is a fantastic VR solution for someone on a budget. Used PS4s are dirt cheap these days (100-200 easy). The VR bundles are getting cheaper and cheaper too. For under $500, you could very easily get a full PSVR setup. I'm not saying it's the BEST VR, but it's certainly the best on a budget.
I have a ryzen 5 1600 and a 1050ti. Will it work?
Last week to back Cybershoes kickstarter For those that didn't know, this treadmill allows you to do everything other treadmills do, but they don't restrict you to not being able to run or make your walking unrealistic with a harness. the seat raises to a standing height of 85cm so it's not exactly seated.

The real question is can it run VRChat
Weird how this video is 2 days old and today the co-founder of Oculus quit as the Oculus 2 was binned by Facebook.. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-by-hp-desktop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-1tb-hard-drive-brushed-aluminum/5759916.p?skuId=5759916 . Cheaper and better at $669.99 ..
Oculus should concentrate on Rift 2.0. Not that Oculus Go crap. Or both of course...
Sadly, the segway for sponsorships are becoming stupid now XD
Q: Where is your Team-Spirituality A: Home
As a VR developer (check out Oh Captain VR!) I just gotta echo what others are saying: the WMR headsets are great! They're low cost, plus they run 99% of SteamVR games plus Oculus games via ReVive. Additionally, up until recently, I developed on a Dell XPS 15 9560 with a GTX 1050 and everything ran flawlessly! (Now working on a 1060 pc)
Does a gtx 1050 mobile and i5-7300HQ work? Do you need an ssd?
Oculus Go?
When you where hitting 90 fps all you needed to do was get an RGB VR headset and you would instantly get another 15 fps.
allkeyshop has windows retail keys for 17$ works great for me i can even get them reset if i change my hardware to much. used same key for years
Running stock Asus TC-605 (i5 haswell gen) with added PSU, 16G RAM sticks and 1060, works fine with Vive for fallout, skyrim, Beat Saber and other games, room scale. The big con for me is the text in VR, in both Fallout (pip boy) and Elite Dangerous, the text is pretty hard to read.
I use a 1050 ti and an i5 2500k in my VR rig
Cheap...
i would pay to see linus play BeatSaber
why do we fall Linus?
You need to build a phone linus
"if you already have windows... OR WHATEVER" ;-) love you linus
i can play certain VR Games with a core i7 7700hq and a gtx 1050 4gb
Great video. VR is cheaper than ever and there are tons of great experiences. Next time you are trying a heavy load VR game, I recommend Lone Echo!
whenever i watch a vid of yours now just keep thinking apple fanboy
"relatively cheap budget" 900 euros isn't budget for me
Nice ?????? Done im'joined Please subback my canel guys Thank you:)
Can I get 10 likes?? Please btw I love linuses vids
windows 10 on kinguin: $20 1060 sc ebay: $200
Oculus (owned by Facebook) wants to ruin VR gaming with traditional console war tactics, namely exclusivity. Don't support Oculus.
i run my oculus on a EVGA gtx 760 4gb and it runs just fine, normally when others are losing frames im pretty good
I would like to point out that Linus tried it with an AIO cooler. i3s would thermal throttle after around 20 mins of VR gameplay and would cause unbearable stuttering. Just my experience before I upgraded my cpu.
My system has an i5 2320 and a gtx 1050ti and 8gb ddr3 and all the vr games I have tried including Skyrim vr run completely smoothly on medium to high graphics
If you weren't sponsored you would mention WMR. Which also has optimisation because it is integrated into windows
I was on a 4gb 1050ti and upgraded to a 6gb 1060. Most games ran fine on the 1050ti but the 1060 allowed me to bump the graphics up a bit.
the most important to run is all those MMD porns
But a GTX 960 probably won't be good enough, right?
Hey linus, try the gtx 1080ti and rtx 2080ti in sli
My 1060 is currently running on a Q8400... :/
And of course the i3 is basically a i5 7600
There are 777 dislikes....
Long story short, my current setup can technically play VR...
that vr headset is almost half the cost of that pc build. Might as well enjoy "2-d" and beef up the graphics and cpu with that extra $400
Fatshark FPV goggles have 2d/3d modes, HDMI and AV, and headtracker modules plug n play. then could use a cheap microcontroller to convert ppm signal from headtracker to mouse/joystick input for gaming.
"If you already have windows... or whatever" wink wink
What do you think about VR on an Acer Predator Helios 300
i cant
399 without controllers so yea not really 399..
Valve knuckles and locomotion is going to make a lot of people buy VR. That's what I'm waiting for anyway. VR just doesn't feel complete without finger tracking and foot locomotion IMO.
109 flat can equal 90 in VR? I know there had been some optimizations to stereo rendering, but I didn't know it was that good. Is that actually typical of most made-for-VR games? If so then some very impressive graphics should be possible on an svyusl high-end rig.
Why didnt you at least turn on vr with the 1050? Lame
I still can't afford the cheapest build there, and my current pc isn't up to spec, either...
I love the videos, Scribe chanel my like the yous!
linus games on a 980 ???
Here's a VR build that's on par or better in certain aspects but 19% cheaper. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/tPgbGG I believe the build would be better served with 16 GB's of ram and a hybrid storage drive for better-operating speeds. I also don't understand why Intel and Nvidia are necessary for this build unless Oculus specifically told them to use those companies. The GTX 1060 6 Gb is $60 bucks over MSRP, currently, an RX 580 4GB is going for $199 and the RX 570 is a good alternative going for $170. Even if this video is old, then I would opt for a 3GB 1060 instead of a 6GB to keep the price in check. if it were me I'd get a (non-retail) version of Windows 10 ( I'm sure Linus can't advocate for it in this video ) and get a RX 570 and overclock it, bringing a 33% price reduction from the build featured in this video. ( this is the build adjusted https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HrqmRJ )
Warthunder is a free to play game and realy awsome in vr.
I game on VR on a gtx 970 ... :)
i have a pentium
props for the Total annihilation retail PACK GANG GANG
try to do a $399 pc that can run the $399 vr headset
have u tried to oc the ram on the 1050ti??? i get decent performance bump with +700mhz on the ram and no core clock oc'ing , it goes up to 1898mhz on the core clock with ram oc'ing alone(stock cirka 1750mhz)
This technology will be massive and work around mid 2020s
that i3 is a i5 of the old days lol you are mixing things up mate. dont say just i3.. its better then my i5 6400.
>Can you Game in VR on a Budget? no you cant, not untill headsets are below 150 $, having a GPU capable of running games in VR never was the problem, not since polaris and pascal atleast
Says cost is the main issue with VR *Shows lower end PC w/ VR costing $1300 instead of going with PS VR and PS4 (~$500)
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home" BEST PART OF THE VIDEO.
RGB nonsense
Brao ne si normalen
He should be playing The Forest in VR scary and fun
>$399 >budget pick 1
It's only 399 ( ?° ?? ?°)
But can it run Linus Sebastian in vr at 60fps?
Vr will never be for me until they can get a 270 degree fov, cuz I hate being able to see the sides of the box at all times.
You didn't Fus Ro Dah in VR, just for that i made a script to create a youtube account and dislike this vid, 696 dislikes and counting :P
Seems like this would've been quite the opportunity to use some cheaper AMD hardware... like a 2200/2400G... and an RX570 or 580(which is cheaper than full size 1060s in North America)... and had a comparable performer at a, you know, cheaper price... for a VR budget rig... Jus sayin'...
80's 90's 00's - DON'T sit in front of the TV you will burn your eyes. 2018's here lets see if your eyes can catch on fire.
Was this basically an ad for oculus by Linus?
0:40 your reason to give this a thumbs down & not even bother watching. Seriously Linus.... nobody is going to take even YOU seriously if some of the first words out of you mouth is how you're being paid by someone with a stake in the subject matter. Those no need to even finish the video. I already know how it goes... it sucked way back when, then it got better but expensive, it's almost affordable now though, Oculus is cheaper than a Vive... hit the link for a kickback to me. Someone please reply if that's sums up the video. I'm not giving my that 10 minutes of my life.
Lack of AAA games is the issue. I want call of duty and GTA in vr etc. Gamers happily pay thousands on a gaming rig.
Looks like you need to check Linus' thermals since it was like he was overheating under load with this meager config
which 1060? The GDDR5 3GB model or GDDR5 5GB model, or GDDR5 6GB model, or GDDR5x 6GB model?
I7 1050ti ? Will it work
Can get a refurb HP Mixed Reality headset for like $160. Worked great on many games with Ryzen 3 2200 and RX580 until upgraded to Ryzen 7 later on.
5:59 “oh neat, you can interact with the desktop WOAHHHHH THATS TRIPPY”
imagine GTA in VR.........
This test was not accurate. We all know that RGB gives more FPS.
This video made me buy an oculus.
i have a 1060 gpu andi5 cpu do u think i wil be able to play vr?
Hey Linus this is a great video... I'm gonna wait for VR for a few year :) Totally unrelated - I've not seen a video on this - I hope you could point me to the right direction - is with my pc on and it loads all the familiar sounds and lights on my case etc everything g is spinning. But I've nothing on my screens. I use 2 monitors both dvi definitely not their issue as I bought one of them like 3 months ago. Please help I'm tearing my dreads out I can't go on my pc :-( Thanks in advance pls keep up the great work! Love from the UK x
Oh no, Linus has taken dirty FB money.
Nice watch. I wonder what kind it is ?? (Apple Watch)
How abt a Rift 2 CV2.
"Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" .. More like, "Can you play Oculus Rift on a low spec PC."
pff I have a x5460, DDR2 RAM (seriously) and a RX470, still I manage to play VR
Hey guys. In 2020 adobe flash is going to get removed. For those that don't know, adobe flash is what runs stuff like cool math
Nothing budget about the PC, GFX card or the Oculus. Looks like Mainstream (gaming) VR is still a few years away.
No, because I don't want to.
Stereo single pass is not a nvidia only tech linus.
I think my biggest issue about VR is NOT the budget (even though it is pricey) but the fact that you kind of need space to use it. I have about just enough space in my room for a bed, a desk and a chair, and not much more.
I'm confused, I thought the Oculus Rift was it's own console... does it REQUIRE a PC to use?
Well LMG is officially a platform for tech commercials. What happened to the real content about tech with an unbiased opinion from an experienced tech guy? At least 3 videos per week are 10 minute sponsor spots now. At least we still have honest channels like gamer's nexus to give us real reviews.
but how much is the VR gear?
I find the term "GPU manufacturers" kinda funny when you're talking about AMD and Nvidia. They don't actually make their own GPUs. Global Foundries and TSMC actually are the ones making your GPUs.
vr is for porn u nerd
But will it run iRacing?
we run 1060's and I5-6500k for HTC vive's and it works just fine
im gonna steal my grandfathers 20€ tommorow
Your writers are very out of touch with poor people. No one is saying they can’t afford a top-of-the-line gaming system for VR. The freaking headsets themselves are too expensive. Most people don’t have $400 to $500 to drop on frigging headset gear
I would love to hear your opinion on PSVR. I have one and love it. Out of all options it's by far the cheapest.
What do you mean you're not factoring in your RGB nonsense? It's been scientifically* proven that each RGB component results in 2 more FPS.
wait you got a 980 ti but you benchmark nearly every graphic card and CPU.
the virtal boy
I never brought a windows license, i always crack the windows, so it's think that it's original, but it's not and i always get my new update
How about trying the 970 or R9 290 instead of 1050 ti since the 970 and R9 290 is or was the minnimum spec
I hate the way Linus goes full fake scientist in sponsored videos.
my friend used to bring his vive over and his laptop (1050) it wasn’t the best great experience possible but it worked.
Lol flat mode. You mean 2d
THERE IS NO LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION!!
7:51 Linus what's that mark on your forehead... ?
I once tested "The Climb" in the Microsoft Store in San Francisco. As a Person who occasionally climbs in real life it good. It would be better if it wouldn't show you so much where to grab. There's basically always only one place to grab. And it really really misses the foot/leg movement. VR needs foot/leg tracking. It's so important
ya wanna talk budget? I run my oculus on an Oc'd AMD 6300 and a R9390...
FUCK WHY AM I GETTING TIK TOK ADS ON EVERY FUCKING VIDEO I WATCH? FUCK OFF TIK TOK WITH YOUR FUCKING CRINGY ASS SUBHUMAN GAY COMMERCIALS!
No.
400 still come on oculus
Please make video about turning down page file.
At 400 for the headset you've already went far away from the idea of on a budget. For real if 400 dollars for 1 piece of something that needs many pieces is in your budget money is not a concern.
Sponsored by Facebook*
7:51 Watch out for the guy behind,who's enjoying his life. Thumbs up for him.
You get plus 20fps just because the rgb...
I hove broken my pc
I have a GTX 1060 is it good enough?
Naaaa I will go with my LCD
Pffft, you call that budget VR? I think you need a lesson from lowspecgamer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIc3oUByAbk
#flatmode
The whole point of this video is kinda devalued because of the oculus sponsorship. If this was really “VR on a budget”, you would be using a WMR headset. Difference of 200+ dollars.
Great! Now all I need is an affordable VR headset!
My PC was VR Ready when I built it 2 years ago, all brand new parts from scratch. Prior to any upgrades I made since then and not including the cost of Windows. It was ~$650 dollars. So 909 dollars, or 770 without including windows, isn't exactly what I'd call bare minimum.
VR will only truly take off when someone releases an 'essential' game/piece of software for it. A massive, multiplayer dungeon crawler would be a good place to start.
Would it be possible to make a cheap gaming bundle with a 290 budget pounds
That expansive i3 instead of ryzen is confusing
the only actually interesting vr game (for me) out there is vrchat and thats actually not even a "game". WHERE ARE THE GAMES AT??
The answers no
i’m just going home is a great game to play
Anyone else waiting for him to take out his sonic screwdriver, revealing he´s been real life Doctor Who all the time?
It is great that you can build a vr pc for this cheap, BUT it is also possible to buy FULL BUILDS that are VR ready AND come with windows for $800. My brother did this and it is working just fine for him.
Can you wear this for 6-10 hours straight without it starting to hurt? No? Then it's not ready yet. Is the 'screen door effect' gone? No? Still not ready yet.
You guys want to do VR on a budget? I've got two words for you: NO HELMET! Use a screen and some controllers like the Wii! Sure it won't be as immersive, but it will still be VR!
Just buy a PS4 and PSVR it’s cheaper
Idea for a scrapyard wars: have a budget, and make it the requirement that you spend every dollar, exact change. So if your budget is $823, you must spend exactly $823 on the system. This would be challenging, but I feel like it would be easier than the last "no internet" challenge.
That pc is nearly identical to mine specs wise. I thought it was too low spec to run vr games, but maybe I will pick up an oculus after all if I see one at a reasonable price
Psstt.... This videos results don't surprise me in one slightest https://youtu.be/gIc3oUByAbk
That jagged thumbnail shop though
i P h o n e V i d e o
The Pc is not the problem. I got an amazing gaming PC, the problem is that i now dont have enough money for the 400$ headset.
I hope the Rift will be on Sale on Black Friday i definitly want one!
What if your budget is 1Billioon $?
5:10 skip the explanation and test a game.
How comes linus only has a 980 ti?
Scrapyard Wars VR Edition incoming
Ditch Oculus, it's from Facebook
1060 is budget?
Will refuse to buy anything lockulus until they open up their market to all headsets. I have had my Vive for 3 years and its been amazing and it will be Pimax next!
Well LiNus, that's great. How's it run with those NEW nVidia cards?
I am not a violent person but I can't be the only one that thought "he is going to punch Ivan in the head and I am going to laugh".
WHAT ABOUT GAMING LAN CENTER?
Any updates on 1060 gddr5x ??
see, this is videos we want. BUDGEEEET
what about 470,480, 570 or 580 GPUs?
I want more videos with Igor!
When you read sponsored by oculus and you already know the title is clickbait...
measely core i3!? some people have celeron! (like me)
VR is not ready. Unless of course you wanna play games through binoculars. FOV sucks on all VR headsets. You only see directly in front of you. It kills immersion Until they figure out how to use curved screens in VR sets I won't be buying another set.
Can a zotac 1050ti OC edition run game like h3vr smooth?
Minimum build - 1050. Out here running 970 mini ;-;
I got windows for 20 quid haha
I recently bought an i3 8100 with a rx 570 8gb, is that rig capable of vr? Doesn't matter if needs to be played with medium to low settings.
1050 ti and i3 8100? That's my PC. Perhaps VR will be doable somewhat
can my pc run vr? i5 6500, 8gb rx 480 and 8gb ram
You look like Voldemort on thumbnail.
The the topics on LTT lately have been boring af.
signs that the world is ending a GAMING phone that has no headphone jack. cough cough razer cough cough
Why not Ryzen 5 1400, you Principled LTT.
What do u think about upcoming Oculus Quest? seems like its has only 72hz instead of 90. Is it will cause motion sickness?
finally, the video that needed to be made last year. Want even cheaper and just as good vr? Ryzen 3, gtx 1050ti, a used 480 (even better) and 16gb ram and windows mixed reality. Plus they can optimize the os better, in the screenshot they showed they have some crap on that caused overhead - and running the frame analyzer causes issues too.
Spider-Man*
I would rather invest those 399 into better PC overall then be stuck with decent PC and decent VR.
How can you promote anything owned by facebook? Not a good look Linus.
Lowspecgamer video is better

He never mentioned the Nintendo Virtual boy
Well here's the thing, if you had a vr there wasn't any budget to begin with
8:58 You the man, man.
That frame buffer thing souds like good adishion to a gaming monitor
Join the Zucc army..
but RGB makes the system faster
Yes, you can but budget VR isn't much better than PSVR. You need a Vive Pro or higher and a 2080ti or higher if you want modern resolutions in all titles.
Can someone answer this question please: Gtx960 is "no go"? The rest of my pc is good (workstation machine).
Why couldn’t they make it use G-sync or Freesync?
Simple answer: yes. In 2025.
I'd like to know how Oculus classifies "optimizing" because ever since the new update I've noticed lag in games that previously were not laggy. Also, it uses way more cpu, ram, and gpu power than it did before. One of my mates can't even use his vr because of the update they did.
I used my HTC Vive with my i7/980ti rig and my i5/1060 rig and it ran great. I also used it on my i7/970m laptop and it also ran great on it as well.
Make him beat saber
on a budget 900$ smh
Sponsored by Oculus Rift Already two seconds in and I can already tell it's bullshit. this is just a nine minute ad.
Will Oculus work on my pc: Windows 7 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz 16 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 ??
The dude sitting there looks like JackSepticEye
Can i game in vr with a r9 390 sapphire and an intel 4460
I wonder how RX480 or GTX970 would do I have one of each not that I plan on buying vr headset anytime soon but wondering how they would do.
Ayy, so anybody wanna buy me an oculus? x)
666 dislikes! Devil
8:53 But RGB = More FPS
can the vr run with the 1050 ti?
Wierdley enough i have that exact same setup i3 and gtx 10 50 i still dont have a occulus yet bit i think im gonna get it soon
do you think 960m is still good?
I use a Ryzen 3 2200G on 3,9 Ghz and a RX 580 8GB and it works perfect
Step 1: Get Cheap Phone Vr Headset Step 2: Use Phone and Headset as the headset itself Step 2: Use wiimotes as Vr controllers Step 3: Strap notebook laptop to your back
No Beat Saber. Shame. Also is a 970m in a laptop enough, or is that cutting it too close?
where 4k video?
was hoping we'd see things like GTX970's being tested, GPU's originally stated as meeting VR specs.
whats better vive or rift?
how cheap can you go on CPU, Ram and Motherboard? i think a VR machine would be an awesome idea for scrapyard wars!!!
Uh Oculus Quest
If you dont have $$$ saved and rent paid off then everthing is a waste of time.
hey i have a video idea. Take a bunch of old bad nvidia graphics cards like the gt 730's or something, and then 4x sli them and see how strong they are!
I'm sorry. I don't think VR is getting anywhere. let's wait another 20-30 years
The most fun game currently for VR is hands down the DOOM 3 BFG: VR Edition Mod
You had me until you said "RGB nonsense"
BOYS 970 4gbs and a i5 3570k? you think it would work? 8 gigs ram too
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home."
pirate windows and save $129
Watching someone playing or 'doing' VR still looks stupid :-/
7:50 Ivan is greeting us :D
"In my opinion The Climb is rather a tech demo than an actual game". Welcome to anything made by CryTek!
please do collab with lowspecgamer
Linus pirate 6:22
I have been using on two Oculus rigs some ancient server CPUs (Xeon 5550 and Xeon 5540) and they both performed pretty neat with a 6GB 1060. Haven't tried them with the Vive, but my best guess is that they would have performed even better, because of Vive's tracking not being as crappy.
I have an i5 with 1060 GPU, this is really encouraging!
"Looking throw toilet paper tubes" should of used this excuse when i got pink eye from a truck stop baddie.
You should revisit budget VR but check out "Riftcat"
$900 is a cheap for an i3 and a 1060? woah. i got my i7 and 970 pc for $500 pfft current gen...
Is ChannelSuperFun dead forever?
980 ti !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so you didnt even test games with a 1050ti or 1050? just cause some synthetic benchmarks said its not good enough ? if THE CLIMB runs smooth with max settings then you clearly dont need a 1060 even... so a 1050ti or maybe even 1050 is going to work fine... thats what id expect you to test... how is it surprising thst a 1060 is working well for vr ? nvidia and.oculus and vive and game publishers have all recommended a 1060 for vr for 2 years now...
I'm using the rift everyday with iRacing, but since the last update I'm getting stutter on the tracking of the rift. Don't know if it's oculus fault or iRacing's fault, but I'm pissed off AF. AAAAnd, on top of all this BS, Intel delayed the delivery of the 9700K, so I can't get a new PC until february! Linus help us!
i3 8100 + 1050ti???? LINUS! Are you MAGE? I have that system right now! O_O (no joke)
Superman falls sometimes (c) This will stay with me forever.
You can see how hard linus is trying to not mention Vive.
$400 On a headset... No.
0:43 When Google, Oculus and The Verge sponsores a video??
Was 100% sure you were going to talk about Oculus Quest
oh god look at ur red face linus
Can you watch porn with this too ?
Yea but vr head sets are super over priced. For 600 Canadian dollars I can get a second pc instead.
Why is Linus such a sellout?
Can you run on budget? Linus: "Nah... lets bump GPU to GTX1060 and make video about that." Really, really lame...
yeah if you send me all the crap you dont want.
6:18 - who else creeped out thinking that something opened in their own computer?
You guys need to try DCS in VR...it’d be interesting to see how you guys get such a system intensive game to run.
Robo recall is only free if you get the oculus bundle with touch controllers
I ran my acer wmr headset off of a gtx 945 aspire v nitro laptop, could only run a couple of the least demanding vr titles, but hey, still got it to work!
if you keep hitting j on the keyboard at 0:00 it looks like linus is masturbating
If you really want to use VR on a budget machine you should have tested AMD graphics cards. I personally run my VR rig on AMD and "flat" gaming rig on nVidia.
three nainty nainn
I wanna see VR with raytrace
VR is awesome
watch people do this and play doom VR and fallout 4 VR or whatever......hint hint those games are basically rip offs ......because it's the same game with a patch......OOF
I just came here after watching 'upgrade' movie and linus t-shirt freaking me out.
But can I watch porn with it
I would have been interested to see you play a really physics heavy VR game with that setup. I follow Anton, the developer of Hotdogs, Horse Shoes, and Hand Grenades, on Twitter and pretty often see him talking about stuff like this. For example, some manufacturers were putting out premade computers with 1050 Ti cards in them and people would complain to him that his game didn't run well on it. Or now the steady flow of people wanting him to port the game to the cheaper oculus headsets, which simply isn't possible. But it's not the graphics, it's the physics. Even on my i7/980 Ti rig I can make the game choke by making a pile of spent 9mm shell casing when dual wielding mac 11s lol.
8:56 "This peasant seriously called it nonsense"
Or PSVR? That should’ve been mentioned
Any thoughts on the rift 2 headset being cancelled? I was hoping to see what next gen PC VR is going to look like before taking the plunge. HTC are just rehashing their vive without a new upgrade anytime soon.
I rock an fx-8350 and a 1050ti. It’s pretty much fine. The only game that has given me trouble at all is Fallout 4 VR.
A budget graphics card won't let you get max settings in every single game? No really? Who would have thought. Sarcasm aside great to see that a GTX 1060 can still preform well in VR. I am tempted to get a budget VR headset and give it a go if such things exist. How would the GTX 1060 3gb fair though compared to the 6gb variant?
You still need to sign away your soul to facebook though. Fuck the Rift.
Talks about budget VR... Shows nearly $1000 PC and calls it budget... never mind the headset and controllers plus all the other stuff needed...
The shitty-ness of this video. I can almost smell it through the screen...
2:39 - I don't want my face on YouTube ;)
The question is: "Can you Game in VR even if you have the Budget?" I mean is there anything that I ABSOLUTELY need to play right now? A killer app? I don't think so.
PS4 + PS4 Vr Headset ~= 600€
Buy pre-owned galaxy s6/7 and gear vr.
Iam a simple guy , i dont see WMR ( Windows Mixed Reality ) Or Beat Saber And I Hit Dislike
AdoredTV did it WAY WAY WAY better!!!
So the rig i have in my longe is built of left over pc parts it has a i5 2500k and a gtx780 8gb ddr3 and it runs vr in most games fine
What about an i5 with a GTX 1050ti?
IM GON TOUCH YOU inapropetly
Vomit Reality? No thanks! I will never be able to play in VR. Even word VR makes me motion sick. I remember very well how sick OR made me.
This is not news, every single gaming laptop that is considered vr ready has similar hardware.
You got me with the fake ending :))) !!
every frame needs to be rendered twice? and what about the extra screen on the monitor ???? forgot something ;)
For me, VR is for 3 Things , Racing Simulataors of all kinds, VRCHAT , a social VR Game where you can grope big anime titties, and Custom 3d Maid 2 , a 3d Hentai VR supported Game. Me Living in da vr 2d waifu sex simulator, da daa very good putin approves da
There's no hype around VR anymore since FB acquired Oculus, people are not buying headsets unless triple A titles are available, and developers don't develop games because there's no user base. catch 22
Linus stop dabbling in the low end when you have no expertise in it. Leave that to people like lowspecgamer. Or at least consult / collaborate with them.
Linus gaming on a 980ti really? I'm just surprised I mean it's Linus I thought his home pc would have 2080ti in 10 way sli with a 9900k overclocked to 30ghz being cooled by perma frost from fucking Antartica with 10tb of rgb ram but a 980ti look at you Linus slumming it using a normal setup
Wait why does he use a 980 TI specifically?
V r is so expensive in india
well people did pair a i5 with 1060... but that was before they upgraded the i3 to basically be an i5... Not sure why you are surprised by this.
I think the next scrap yard wars needs to be a VR gaming rig challenge...
"Vr on a budget? Awesome, can't wait to know more about cheap alternative to vr headset." video sponsored by occulus ah..... Guess I'll come back later when the sponsor allow him to talk about something else then the Facebook thing...
should have used a 2400g for the amd side
I've got a Samsung Gear vr A bunch of ps3 cameras Razer hydra Works great on my GTX 1060 FX 8300 8GB DDR 3
Hey, heres the millionth comment about windows mixed reality. By the way you should try WMR again
399? No thanks, I'd rather buy a chair ( ?° ?? ?°)
Can my gt210 run VR? With Intel pentium
Switching to a R3 2200G, Appropriate mobo, and an RX 580 (which you can find for about 240 vs the 310 of the 1060) and you would get performance along the same lines. Although with the price difference, unless you really are just trying to get in the door, I would recommend a R5 2600 with the money you saved from the gpu.
PS4 you can have for much less!
https://youtu.be/S4TBPL7-iRk The real lowspec VR feel.
We'd love to see you give Gorn a try! VR Gladiator Game that's still in early access: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1896033800492877/
I personally think VR is going the same way 3D TV’s and movies did..... It was a novelty at first but never really took off with the masses
I game in VR with a 970
Would the upcomming gtx 1060 "2" make up for a nearly perfekt experience tho?
I hate it when the sponsor of a video is directly linked to the content. How are we supposed to know where the ad ends and where the video starts. Occulus aren't the only VR company so this video is more "Minimum config for the occulus rift". Don't get me wrong, I am not commenting on the quality of the content or quality of the video, just the poor separation between ad and 'real' content. Have a nice day, Mathieu.
or just save 200 pound with a phone vridge/kinovr ps move +ps move service ps move camera and a phone with a phone vr headset then there you have a fully working vr experience or atleast somewhat working
$900 + $400 = $1300 And that's bare minimum specs too. VR simply put isn't going to become the method of gaming for the every man anytime soon.
This is an ad.
Lowspecgamer
Expect more Uganda red Knuckles to appear, now that it is affordable to more people.
Linus' home PC doesn't have the most high end vid card? Le gasp!
One day i'll upgrade, but right now I'm happy with my i7 3770K and GTX 970 for VR
i9 and 2080 ti vr?
VR is kinda dead at this point
Some Indi games won't even run on 1060 , are you really play Linus?
Cool, so I can hook up a $500 headset to a $500 PC and it’ll work.
sure, but what about the headset price?
Future video topic?? Maybe? https://github.com/stec-inc/EnhanceIO
Depends what you're playing. I made my mother a R5 1500 and gtx 1050 system and plugged in my oculus just to check. It ran most things fine. All the 'experiences', well-optimised games too. More demanding stuff... no, but then some games are just poorly optimised. I run it on my R7 1700/ 1080ti and some games (City Car Driving, I'm looking at you) are just stuttery as ** because they rely on CPU to render.
30fps i dont feel anything
Linus, I've been watching your videos for about 6 years and I have to say the content is superb. From the sketches, the jokes (good and so awful that they're good), the quality of your videos, the wit, the depth of knowledge, the social justice tech warrior objectiveness. You're brilliant. Genuinely considering moving to Canada one day haha
Totally out of context but what if a r7 2700x could oc to 5.0 ghz, how would it compare to intel hmm...
I use an fx8350 and 780 and rarely have issues with it?????
a 1050ti is budget now? people have been duped in to thinking £180 is cheap, it's not. It's low quality, compared to current tech but it's not cheap nor budget.
Can't you vr on the PlayStation or whatever?
vr8teen.net + allvrporn.com ???????????????? Virtual reality porn!
????? :3
love videos like these, awesome job guys
Can a ryzen 3 1200 at stock speeds, 3000 MHz 8gb ram and a RX 570 from Asus with 4 GB of vram give any playable results ? (I plan to build this system and now that vr is cheaper it would be nice to have that feature)
Who the heck would buy a vr with pennies
Ur sick.
Linus - measly little i 3 8 gen ME - cries inside
Oculus Quest is coming on 2019 where you won't need a PC anymore!
FINALLY i have been wondering if i could run VR for ages! Thanks!
R9 380 + i5 6400 is enough for vr, which is like a 1050 ti. I think linus should've tried the 1050ti
VRis bullshit
Come-on Linus! let's go 19:9
My recommendation is ram. Get 16gb of ram MINIMUM Especially with the rift. The rift home app uses like 2gb by default. And buy H3VR.
I really liked your “reasons to buy an iPhone” video, because even though those factors were outweighed in your use case, I found it helpful to have a lot of information that didn’t strictly apply to your needs. I think you should do a second video on present day VR featuring Vive and WMR and discuss what they bring to the table, even if they aren’t better options than Oculus in your opinion.
I always wondered why Linus keeps touching his phone in his pocket but is he advancing the script cue or something because he is doing it very regularly I've noticed
I built my rig as a vr machine, then found out I didn't like vr! Just couldn't get over the fact I had a 'thing' on my head! + I missed the crisp clarity of a 4k panel, vr is just so blurry most of the time, I once heard someone describe it as "its just like being there, only you've forgotten your glasses!"
i5 is overspec for a 1060.
Would've preferred an older PC like something like a 2500k 4GHz, 2x4GB of 1600MHz DDR3, and a GTX 780 or a R9 290
Am I the only person who finds the screen door effect a total immersion killer? Anyone have any tips on possible ways to minimise it? Hardware isn't an issue, my laptop has a 7700hq and gtx1070..
Guys I’m on a 1050Ti and i5 3470. Am I set or no?
I want the VR headset that was not more than $150. That what should be affordable for most people because later it will be has TAX and other thing make it higher prices.
909.93 not include the VR headset it self -_-
thanks for all the none benchmark you did on your hrc vive, vive pro , windows mixed reality headset and oculus with a RTX 2080TI ! pathetic influencer ( and you are doing this because it is sponsored by oculus...)
so if you already have windows or...whatever ??
Will you be testing the new oculus quest at some point?
0:42 lul the verge
VR is dead and so 2016
9:25
The advertising ends in the 9:31
How much ram do we need?
Holy shit Linus is getting old so quickly, check out those wrinkles on his forhead starting at 08:37 until the very end of the video ??
$900 for just the computer is considered budget?
or get a gear VR ( mine came free with my s7 )
So how does that rig handle non-VR gaming?
Ok, but what about second hand graphics card on ebay or craigslist. There must be cheaper cards out there that can be just as good as the 1060???
399.00 X 2 is headset and pewdiepie chair
I tried oculus on my 4790k/1080ti about a year ago and it was nauseating. I'll wait for an "Oculus 2" or something to try again
One question - who cares?
Why don't you go with i5 4590? It's only a little slower than i3 8100 but much cheaper, motherboard and ram would be cheaper too for the same performance
Linus, you said you game at home on a 980 Ti? WHY? Why not a 1080 Ti??
My Oculus has been EXTREMELY unstable recently. Half an hour of playing and i get complete USB failures up to my xbox gamepad glitching out. Support says basically that i have to check my everything and reinstall their software about 7 more times. How can you have John Carmack working with you and have such awful software at the same time?!
I run a i5 6600k with a gtx 1060 3gb mini 16 gb ram, IT runs ok...
so, an i7 6700+GTX970 would be a good experience?
My Problem with Oculus Rift are my glasses. I just can't use it. Although i have one
for a info guru you sure seam ... uninformed. vr is NOT io people want, its not matter of price. while its new and interesting exhaustion doesnt play so big role, but with time you use it less and less till you stop altogether. its a gimmick you loose interest in very fast. it rose and died, this time it should die for good
did you guys deepen linus’ voice in post? ????
you could try honey select vr ...
Anyone have any idea how a 970 would go?
Hey Mr Linus I need help my PC is as following h61m-s2pt PCIE V2 X16 board 2*2GB ddr3 ram and 500 gb HDD what GPU could I install to resurrect ?? my PC, I did a reserch and found that amd rx pro wx 4150 just has (.44) Bottel neck, ahh and ci 3 2100 processor please your help will make a nuclear (BIG) chang to my gaming exp and Thanks aloot Linus .????
1060 3GB DDR5 / 1060 6GB DDR5 / 1060 6GB DDR5X?
That system is pretty pricey for a budget... I don't know if I can call it a budget. (Although Walmart had a i5 8g ram 1tb and a 1060 GTX for $499 last year for black Friday) only issue was it had windows 10 installed on it.
Id actually want a VR headset for racing games, but I feel like theyre still developing so fast Id always buy a version thats outdated soon
DO A REVIEW ON OCLULUS QUEST
try a gtx 660
alright let me just go out there and shell out 400 bucks to play VRChat at 10fps
i was looking forward to this video... but damn that was disappointing, considering i ran 1440p vr headset on a r9 280x(almost half of a 1060) with no overclock. this video was really just useless, sorry Linus but its the truth.
Give us you thoughts on the Oculus Quest, please!
how is $400 dollars budget? https://www.newegg.com/global/uk-en/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAD6H6JW4292&cm_re=hp_mixed_reality-9SIAD6H6JW4292-Product this is about 300 and i play it on my 1050ti 16gbs of ram and an i7 3770
why didn't you try a real game with that setup?
Well that's not good. Their exchange rates are a bit off. Still £399. Even tho it's $399 ....
“Gamers in particular” Gamers truly are the most oppressed group.
honestly, each day I feel more regret of buying oculus rift.yea, I was hyped back then, and till now there are just a handful of games that worth playing. and the 480p-ish graphic is just not banging. I bought a gtx 1080 for it, for playing racing simulate type game, that card is just not enough. I can afford a 1080ti but I just dont want to spend that on a few games. like the rest of the vr game can run pretty smooth on a 1070 or 1060 I believe. Car Project 1 and 2 are friggin fantastic but the graphic gets extremely downgraded in VR. but it just feel real in VR and I got car sick pretty much everytime.
anyone know what sort of results you would get with a 6600k and a 1070ti
Hi Linus, Do you know if it exists an extension cable for the Rift with HDMI and USB female to a USB C thunderbolt 3 ? (And do you think it will Worth it?) Thank you a lot for your videos. I love VR !!
we have our phone already, just use that as display to cut down cost (probably majority of it). plus cloud server.
VR is still stupid
Linus... iron your shirt!!!
Go on vrchat and get laid in vr
Or you can buy Windows on eBay for 5$.
Know if you want to budget VR you need a 1050ti and a goddamn Windows mixed reality headset that's a cheap budget rig and it works great
Fun fact: Oculus co-founder left the team just recently after Facebook canceled the Rift 2. Good job, Facebook
Get an office PC with a decent cpu, put a GTX 1050 ti low profile gpu in, stream to Oculus go over fast wifi and your all set. Simples!
Vr sponsored by oculous yeeeeah right. I'm clicking off this commercial.
I have an i7-2700k paired with a gtx 1080ti... should i bite the bullet and see if i can VR?
can u guys do giveaway GPU’s... i really need one ????????
Low spec gamer did this way better. Don’t do a sponsored video because Oculus won’t let you run a budget system.
Cool. You've convinced me that I'll not be buying a VR rig in the near future. Thanks, Linus.
Soooo... my i7 and 1050ti, laptop. Could play vr?
I do always like your videos and always think your job is awesome... But I'm starting to think that your sponsors are in fact always Intel and Nvidia. Why can't you actually make a budget VR test with AMD? I mean, some of us want to see how good they work with liquid VR and a "less gaming" CPU.
how about running flat games in 3D using a vr headset?
I like how Ivan was looking at Linus "Damn Linus you look fly today"
‘Budget’
Play almost 2 years on 780gtx + i5 3570 now on 1070ti +i7 3770 All is good !!
I VR using I7 970 and AMD 480..... it's fine.
Honestly, if you were to buy the same (or extremely similar build) used, you could probably get away with approximately 500$CAD. You can find older i5 or i7 (4th gen) for really cheap and a used GTX 1060 3GB - 6GB can be found from 200$ to 300$CAD used.
How would anyone looking at this think a i5 6600 with a 1050ti handle vr
I like that splash screen color.
Im so mad, that i3 8100 is faster than my i5 4460
Off-topic : Linus knows style xD https://www.gq.com/story/socks-with-sandals-is-cool-now?mbid=nl_102418_daily&CNDID=31203936&utm_source=nl&utm_medium=email&utm_brand=gq&utm_mailing=gqm_details_news_newdb_ACTIVE_20181024%20(1)%20remainder&bxid=MTMzMTc2OTM2Nzk0S0&MD5=ba1c7c7dc07aa7c41e3026123265d1d5&SHA1=0a4b848febf323015c51df07ccc6cd51e7ef6411&spMailingID=14495537&spUserID=MTMzMTc2OTM2Nzk0S0&spJobID=1501907616&spReportId=MTUwMTkwNzYxNgS2 #linusstyletips
5:05 or whatever.. lmao.Also getting rid of the stock, Oculus?
You should have tried a few games on the 1050 ti before moving up. It would have been interesting to see if you found it playable.
#SPONSERED
Cool !
Linus will you bless me with a gpu please :^)?
If a GTX1060 can run VR The Climb, then why can't my RX480 8GB?
VR is dead, just like 3D, and soon HDR will go too..
For VR to truly work the VR manufacturers NEED to support their hardware with (awesome) GAMES. In this way, they will sell more hardware and so draw more outside developers into the VR fold... Better graphics would be nice too...and headsets...
"Budget" $399 JUST for the headset. Great commercial.
The answer to the title is "It depends on the budget stupid"
I've got a 970 and VR works pretty well for me most the time, some games work great with the settings maxed, others I have to lower the graphics options way down. Oddly Skyrim VR even works great after a little tweaking. I know it's not a PC device, but as far as VR on a budget goes, I'm surprised you didn't mention the Oculus Quest, considering this is a sponsored video. lol I can't wait for Quest, even tho I already have a Rift.
Linus is wrong! You need the RGB to run VR properly as it boosts performance by %50
Would my 1060 6GB and a Ryzen 5 1600 and 8GB RAM Run VR?
Who would by Windows at Microsoft? Getting it on gray market sites is so much cheaper. Even if they can kill your license, it was just 5 bucks so who cares
$399??? Any wise consumer would spend that on a Pewdiepie chair instead…
me like R.N. lel
8100 is more than enough for the 1060. Right?
This is what high end user might think which is budget, in reality its not really that budget oriented for some people as it is still a lot, there are other alternative which employ cheaper yet kind of quirky method to get vr running.
couldnt you have just said 2D..... not 'flat mode'.... lol
only $900 USD! AND THEN ANOTHER $400 FOR THE HEADSET!! DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A BUDGET?????
whats linus personal vr spec rig
Probably would have spent way less if he used a CPU that used DDR3. Also, buy used. My VR rig uses an i7 3770 and an RX 580. The CPU, motherboard, and RAM came from an old office computer I got for free. I bought the graphics card used on Ebay. Add in the PSU and USB 3.0 card I bought, and my system was about $300.
omg i think the verge broke all oculus rifts 0:42
GTX 970 and an FX 8350, with a windows MR headset. You can build the PC and get the headset for around 500 bucks, and it performs very well.
They had to wait to make this video until two full rolls of toilet paper had been used up.
Correct me if I’m wrong but wouldn’t it be rendered 3 times? Two on the headset and one on the screen?
Can you do Fallout 4 on PC in VR?
How about RX 580?
But can it run Digital Combat Simulator in VR?
Sorry, but a 10 series card isn't even close to low-end.
I have a pc with parts just like that with some exeptions but still its happy to hear it can run vr. 1x8gb DDR4 GTX 1060 6gb Windows 10 64bit And ryzen 5
I thought the rift was like 1k so I've never even thought about buying it, for 399 I might actually consider it considering I already have a top of the line pc
What's the point of this video?! This PC meets recommended specs for VR! If you want budget VR than try WMR with GTX 1050 (Ti). That would be interesting.
why is linus only using a 980ti at home? surely he could use a 1080ti from his office stores?
A 1050Ti is not low end, I do VR on a 970.
I have an i3 and 1060 in my current rig so that's good to know!
I just got my wireless adapter for my vive... SOO SIC! linus, get luke to do a vive minimalist vid
Im a VR developer and wrote a thesis and developed some tech to make VR games run on lower hardware. A lot can be done in the engine to make it more efficent. Im now making for the oculus go as part of their oculus start developer support, its INSANE. The go is my favourite headset then rift then vive. Vive is so clunky compared to rift, and controller on rift is superior imo. Coming from an unbaised developer.
I am surprised that it worked with Core i3. Normally we'd be discouraged from using anything lower than a Core i5. But here's the catch with this video - The fact that there are "low quality" and "maximum quality" settings on VR games and software, as well as the smoothing tech in current graphics cards, allow there to be a much more vast variety of possibilities with the configuration, with a possibility for a PC that's a lot cheaper than recommended specs - and even your test bench. 1060 is a good GPU for Oculus Rift, but that's only if you want recommended framerates and you've got the budget for that. You just talked about how Nvidia allows to "smooth-out" bad framerates in VR, or the tech that makes rendering faster by not rendering extra polygons/pixels on both sides, yet you've have never mentioned that in your tests... A real barebones stystem for VR would have a 770 or a 750Ti or something like that - as long as you don't use it for too long. There is obviously a chance of eye strain because of the low framerate, but at least it's better than a cheap ol' Google Cardboard viewer, or even an Oculus Go headset which, while it has it's own built-in OS, still doesn't have all the features that the Rift has.
Talking about budget VR gaming and not even mentioning Oculus Go.
But can it run Crysis?
Well im gonna test then if my setup is vr capable, good luck with a 1060 and an fx 6100
The only thing i want is VR Chat
Now you can play all of the mediocre crappy one-day VR games instead of AAA titles.
Forget this garbage. PS4 Pro and a Headset, camera 120 fps ,
its funny one of my buddys has a rift and he only uses a 1050ti and from what i'v seen while using it,the 1050ti seems to be able to push vr quite well(from the games i played anyways mainly job sim and hotdogs horse-shoes and hand-grenades the gun sim) though um pretty sure it's only running at 60fps and not 90 but,it didnt feel choppy and it didnt give me motion sickness
Duuude this is my pc... Core i3 8100 Gtx 1050ti 16gb Ram Wow this feels like watching a review for it
Vive is better than Oculus
In my head during the opening pitch: “Please be my hardware, this is LTT so ‘affordable’ is going to be a 1070 and an i7 8800k” 2:35 “Fucking hallelujah” 3:00 and on: “Ok I have to stick to watching the whole video before celebrating”
Make a video comparing this to PSVR.
This might have changed since the video was shot and edited, but right now can actually be significantly cheaper. I just recently picked up an RX 570 for $160 which is a far more powerful gpu than a 1050 ti while being half the price of a 1060 6g and still under the 500w power limit (though I found 600w EVGA PSUs to be around the same price anyway). If you take windows 10 out and cheap out a bit on the motherboard and ram, you can get that price down to under $600 for a VR ready machine (not including shipping or the cost to build).
My question is could I use a gtx 970 for VR with i5
1:44 huh i wonder if this could be a use for sli / crossfire .. one gpu reandering fore each eye
Ryzen 5 1600x, 1050ti, 16gb of ram, I play and stream VR consitently(mostly pavlov or VRChat and both cpu and gpu are overclocked as far as they can go) but works amazingly. I have windows MR and a Oculus(mostly use the windowsMR mostly because setup and tear down is a lot simpler)
The only way that the HTC is still better is the controllers
so in theory i should be fine with my I5 4690k and my 970 with 16g ram.
PSVR is another budget vr
Here I am playing csgo at 25 fps :(
0:50 linus gets help from the verge. can we just appreciate this.
8:34 linus is playing and in back he is working what a nice boss linus is
I Guess my AMD Phenom II X6 1055T and my Nvidia Geforce 750 Ti, cant run Minecraft VR...
linus has raccoon eyes
Ew sponsored by zuck
I play vr with a i3-8350k and a 1050ti and it runs great
This is probably the worst attempt at VR on a budget. Hell, the worst attempt of anything LTT "on a budget" since you guys go far and above what the minimum specs for VR actually are. FYI, Raw Data and FO4VR are the "Crysis of VR" What a massive waste of time this video is for both the audience and LTT
But will it run Fallout 4 VR?
Wouldn't the cheapest VR rig be a PlayStation with PSVR?
8:48 Ivan when Linus says RGB nonsense.??
Oculus is a pretty great deal
Would a i3 3.6ghz 4th gen and a evga 1050 ti sc work?
I’m VR gaming with an AMD Fx 6300 (OC’d to 4.0), and a GTX 1060. It’s pretty smooth on everything I’ve thrown at it so far.
i thought this is a tips to play VR with android phone + google cardboard
i3-8100 is my favorite chip. I love it, and I put it in my personal PC.
Hey Linus i have a windows 7 laptop and its poop cant run anything without blue screen so i bought a bunch of supplies to build a pc can u help me understand how to put it together it would mean a lot
no way my system can handle this specially with my vid card radeon hd6570
Linus shilling for money again. How come you don't even mention WMR? Oh yeah, sponsored by Oculus..what a joke. Edit: Also LowSpecGamer did a much better job
And... Where's the "budget" part of the video?
Do people really buy those windows keys. All I had to do is use command prompt to activate my windows. It was simple and just search it on YouTube for it. 140 bucks is too much lol
this or vive though?
I actually had no idea that VR had been optimized so well in the last year
"So if you already have windows or ... whatever." I have whatever ;)
why are all the recent videos not in 4k wtf
What happened with the 4k videos ?
obligatory "technically a million dollars can be a budget".
Sony PS4 VR console job done
What case is that ?
That climb thing is really upsetting, having dismembered hands! So the developer could not figure out how to model hands that are actually connected to your body??!!
Okay. So yes the GPU is a big part for single-player games. But for any multiplayer game the CPU is the most important part for VR. Reason being. Your CPU has to know every players movement. I kinda can't believe. You, LINUS! Did not mention this. An if you don't believe me. Lets see you play VRChat with the CPU you used for that rig. Once you enter a world with 20+players and stand in front of mirror, have fun with 11FPS. LMFAO
LTT is not the channel for "budget" stuff. since their term of budget stuff is out of touch.
One of the Windows Mixed Reality Headsets has been on sale for $150 for the HMD and controllers. It's a killer deal. Also, I've been using my Vive with my HTPC, which has an i7 2600 and 1050ti. That's an old CPU and lower end GPU. If you're upgrading the GPU of an older machine and getting the $150 HMD, you can be into VR for ~$300. That's so cheap compared to even a couple years ago.
I would almost bet the sim community buys more VR headsets than anyone. It would be cool to see how a lower spec PC handles sims.
Linus budget gaming vr set is 10k Canadian Dollars.
For the common viewer of THIS channel, I can see that VR is something they might go for. But I look at it from an overall market perspective, and even though those of us who know the details behind it understand that it might as well be a near-to separate system the "average consumer" sees it as a peripheral. To me until basically an Occulus Rift (not a GO, a straight up full featured Rift) or similar product sells for sub $200 it will not be a market changer. It is, from the eyes of the "average consumer" (not the enthusiast, or anything like that, I'm thinking like kid who got a console from mom and dad and mom and dad might pay for it) it is a peripheral and should be priced as such. Which is sub $200. Full featured VR at sub $200 is required for it to truly take off in the market. But that's my opinion.
I wish I had as much money as you Linus. I'd love to have a setup worth sharing.
“Superman falls sometimes”
I just wanna say that you brought 2 toilet paper rolls to make a bad joke
I’ll wait 5 years for VR to be at ready player one level.
No Crysis VR?
Owns one of the most famous, if not THE most famous tech review companies... VR games on a 980ti. I know it still does a great job, but still haha
You can play vr game below $10 but you need a smartphone which have gyroscope.
Could you guys try out an oculus rift on an Predator Helios 300?
The thing is, the GTX 1060 is roughly in line with the GTX 970, which was the Rift and Vive's original minimum spec. Not sure what the point of the video is. "Using a PC that is in line with the PC they say you need works" I guess.
Now that tech is good the y need good games for vr real games
How to get VR for free: go outside
Personally, I wouldn't say the money was the problem. The problem was the shit quality (pixelated) when you put it on. For me, it made games unplayable. I don't know how people said you don't notice em when they're all over. the screen in front of you..
I dont really think VR has rolled over yet. I remember 90's VR when I was a kid. 5 year old me in the 90's knew it was not realistic at all. I remember thinking to myself it was an awesome idea though and couldnt wait till they got it to look more realistic. That time has come. VR is badass now. As a person who grew up on Nes, Snes, Sega, PS, N64... etc. I knew VR was the next step even when I was a kid. I just knew Id have to wait until tech was good enough to make it a reality. The thing is VR is not affordable yet like a ps4 or Xbox One X. Gpu's are powerful enough but the prices are still a bit to much for normal gamers to just buy it like a console or laptop. I think Vr is getting advanced enough at this point where it will be mainstreem in the next 5 years. Headset makers are making affordable sets now and soon gpu tech will be powerful enough to run VR at an affordable price. While the high end cards will be able to power much crazier things like AI.
Is that what you call budget?
i just want to play vr chat and vr waifu games
I thought you were going to discuss Irebe (Oculus founder) leaving the company and Facebook shifting the focus towards self-powered headsets like the Oculus Go
Thats more money than i have
GTX 1060 3GB or 1060 6GB?? I have 3GB will it work?
Thank god the like/dislike ratio is back to normal
lol "flat mode"
This aint budget bro. Oculus DK2, 100 quid. Pc i got for my 13th birthday, 400 quid. Plays warthunder just fine brilliant experience and vr chat. Haven't done much else with it yet because i don't have controllers
the 1050ti would have done just fine if you actually tried, because spoiler alert, benchmarks as usual are bullshit, really the only games that don't run as well as you'd want are badly optimised games like fallout 4 vr source: i play VR games on the htc vive with a gtx 1050ti (the EVGA SC edition) and an amd fx-4300, and again, other then in games like fallout 4 vr which is badly optimised, i get a solid 90fps no issue, and the games run great
Okay, now we can run VR. But what for? VR chat?
But can you run with an 8350? ??
O N L Y $ 3 9 9 . 9 9
Oculus rift in my country costs 600 US dollars
Does Facebook still own the Oculus Rift?
That's a 1060, not a 1050TI.
I hear appt hear tech YouTubers saying things like ohh I only have a 1070 ti and I'm like your Linus tech tips shouldn't you have like 2 2080 ti's and an i9 9900k
ka-ching!
Huh, funny that John Carmack described the Sony Glass-tron as looking through cardboard. He probably didn't realise he'd be working for Oculus 15 years later. Nice Wolf3D and Doom posters on the window/wall
I would love to try Elite:Dangerous in VR. I already played nearly 500 hours on basic monitor but I can't afford any headset yet. Maybe some day in the future.
Linus's S's are painful... Why didn't you EQ them out? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I know when I think about cooling an i3 8100 I decide on a 240mm AIO.
PSVR (use it on PS4 & PC). Anyway, VR needs to go full wireless in order to grow the market to next level.
I’ll pay more for the htc headsets before I give mark f***erberg my money
Hi Ivan! My name is Ivan.??
lol linus the climb isnt the crisis of vr if anything deserves that title its robo recall since for max graphics you need a 1080ti or better
I think I missed it but was it a 3g or 6g 1060? I was trying to figure out if a 1060 6g laptop could do VR or if I absolutely have to have a 1070 in it
yes you can but this video isnt how you can pick up a windows mixed reality headset for 200 Canadian dollars and then any gpu around the gtx 1060
So VR still isn't affordable, in a giant surprise to noone.
Hi
I heard that my HD 7950 vapor-x oc edition with 3gb is better then the 1050ti with 4gb. So it is possible to run VR on this card?
Doesn't the i3 have 4 cores now with HT and the i5 does not have HT? Or did that change already for those models? If not, did it play any part on it? I think having the HT would be much better.
could you figure similar results with a vive?
I run a 770gtx. Help.
Still it's best to get good hardware that can run the games in VR as smooth as possible. I replaced my i7 2600 with a GTX 970 for a i7 7700k with a GTX 1080ti just because some games still would have some troubles in VR. One of them was Sunshine Arizona wich caused some flickering or framedrops when there where many zombies and it would make it harder to keep my balance while playing. I personally like to play mostly VR FPS games that support locomotion movement on both my Oculus and PSVR and smooth frame rates are a must in that case. And because of that experience I don't suffer at all from motion sickness anymore after upgrading on the PC, because I noticed that I didn't had any troubles playing with my PSVR on for several hours on the PS4 Pro and never had any motion sickness at all from the start. The only thing that could unbalance me now or making my virtual hands do stuff that is humanly impossible is if someone walks between me and one of my sensors, or if there is something in the background that interferes as simple as a light source in case of the PSVR. If you are wondering if VR could be something for you, then try it if possible before you invest at all. Sometimes I take one of my VR sets with me to a lanparty and for some reason people don't even dare to try it thinking that it's nothing more compared to 3D movies they watched in the cinema's. I got one guy to try (after telling me VR is not for him and never tried it before) and play Farpoint on the PSVR with the Aim controller and he was amazed and after that it was his best gaming experience ever. But in some cases I had some people try a game and they where like 'Nope'. But you will never know if you don't try, and you won't even come close to the experience when watching people play VR games on youtube, because you have to experience VR by yourself.
I seriously thought this was an Oculus Go update video....
No point in getting the Rift since Facebook doesn't care about the pc market and has canned future versions of the pc rift, as per Iribe.
I have a gaming laptop with a 1050ti and I really want to get an oculus rift
So, with a 1060 AMP edition and a i5 8400 would I be able to run most VR games smoothly? Cool, now I just need a Oculus
come on linus weres the code to buy and get a discount :)
Not factoring rgb? If you're not factoring rgb then how is the pc even "gaming"? You suck. Disliked
Man I was hoping for some 1050ti performance
you bought 8k camera, but the video is not even 4k :(
but can a GT 1030 play VR yes I know it kinda does in a janky way also I dont recommend the DDR4 variant but if you are too poor to be forced to buy the DDR4 I suggest get to look for 7XX class cards
What are the games?
VR is like communism. It looks good in paper but is useless in real life.
lowspecgamer is typing...
VR has always been goofy to me. It also seems like a gold rush than the way of the future. I think what customers really want is augmented reality which has promise
This just goes to show that the 8th gen i3 CPUs are far better gaming chips than they are given credit for. A friend's wife asked me to build a PC for him as a gift and he was somewhat worried when he found out that it only had an i3. He's been pleasantly surprised by the performance. Considering this was an upgrade from a 3rd gen i5, he's doing better!
I was really hoping I could run the rift on my crappy hp laptop with a 930m and and i7 5500u and 8gb of ram, my hopes are probably too high.
No!

could you try making a vr setup with your phone and for the controllers use something like PlayStation move
Did you happen to get to the Oculus Quest reveal? What is your opinion on it?
VR is like 3D,it`s a gimmick and nobody really wants it
"If you already have windows or whatever"
While I normally don't care if content is sponsored, this video is basically a summary of Oculus' specs page: https://support.oculus.com/170128916778795/ I would hope a company's own minimum and recommend specs would provide reasonable performance.
Now I want to see a craigslist VR build. LOL
can I use gtx 770 sli VR ?
vive also dropped price like 200 bucks. and added motion smoothing which helps a lot and you can also get wireless now btw.
Yes. Yes you can. Just check out LowSpecGamer and his video on budget VR that he did months ago.
$399 isn't cheap enough when 90% of people on Steam use dual or quad core cpus and GPU's that are less than $200.
I plan on getting VR next year. Hope my overclocked GTX 970 will be enough.
"Bare minimum system"=GTX1050. I wouldn't call that a bare minimum. Try a much lower end gaming computer.
What about AMD cards? :(
how about amd side i wonder for ppl who have a amd card what is the minimum card that should be used and the minimum recomended to play all games
Thanks for doing this, I already have a PC with a 1060 in it. I want to upgrade to a 1070, put the 1060 in another computer I have, give that to my brother for Christmas/ birthday (he turns 13), and get a VR headset for my Christmas/birthday (mines a month later but hey, VR is pretty expensive)
I accidentally just sycned supernova to the intro music. :) The more you know.
The funny thing is that I am going to build the exact same pc
Linus games on a 980Ti himself? You'd expect better with bins of Titan Vs lying around
Real price is $1300. Forgot to include the $400 headset cost.
MOAR VR plz
Wait Linus plays VR on a 980?!! UNFORGIVABLE!!
Hi!, back(To Ivan) 7:51
Too bad the Rift 2 was cancelled. RIP OCULUS
Pxrnhub released a lot of their videos in VR mode.
I would have liked to see you play test the i3 and 1050 instead of trusting synthetics
Would be awesome for playing race sims
damn, I just bought a 1050ti, sad to hear it's not good enough, but not surprised at the same time. I'd like to get an oculus down the road to play rock band VR.
I mean I've got a 600$ PC with a 980 and an i5-3330 and I can run all VR games with my HP Mixed Reality headset, and I would consider that 600$ PC to be pretty budget.
4:13 got one of those 8100s for the family PC and its actually quite beefy
Are thand controllers you are using for Robo Recall part of the Oculus Rift setup, or some third party input device?
VR is still a thing?
90fps is overrated 30 is buttery "smooth"
Does it feel more natural than it looks? I'm hoping it's better than the impression I get from watching other people's VR action... which do tend to induce motion sickess for me :-/
Coming soon: Getting Over It VR ...
Till wont run on my 6th gen Pentium!
Rift 2 please!
Yeah make a video about VR while being sponsored by Oculus Rift, talking about conflict of interest
Why is Linus using a 980 ti card at home... Conspiracy!
He says you need better hardware for Skyrim vr.... when lowspecgamer got it to run on a gt 1030 and integrated graphics (vega 11)
FAKE NEWS that rgb definitly gave you a huge boost.
Sponsored by Fascistbook... No thanks.
god VR is still a joke...
No 4K available for this video..
I run my htc vive with an rx 580 and a ryzen 7 1700 and works really good, if it helps someone.. :/
Does my 970 support all these features
Why do we need to game on VR? The application is vast for VR, especially for training simulation for certain job roles. The problem at the moment is the movement, we all know how they work. We also know how some small companies are working toward having the capability of running and staying stationary on a threadmill like platform. Doesn't have to be about gaming. This could be used to give someone who is physically disabled to see the world or educate students from home.
rip people who wants to sell their oculus for 100 cheaper XD
ngl, clicked onto this video very quick
What was that case? Looks good
7:25 and 7:41 - the top right corner says "LOW FPS". So, how is it working good then?
Plus if you come from console with this PC you enjoy all the other luxuries associated with PC gaming
you didn't even go min spec. you can play on a gtx 960!
Oculus Rift owner here! Crysis of VR is Elite: Dangerous, to be honest. It's insanely pleasing to see that 1060 is handling 90% of VR games (judging by the games and performance demonstrated) perfectly, though :) P.S:I also have a 980ti, and well... It is OK on 1.0 SS, but if you really want to have fun and clarity - you need 1.5 supersampling and boom, 980ti is not enough :C
I finaly caved and got a rift+humble 1060gtx gaming laptop glad i waited because there is a serious library now, even if this vr wave never goes mainstream whats availible right now is a no brainer for the asking price, and a serious breath of fresh air to gaming.
1050ti says it's above the minimum requirements doesn't test it in actual VR 1060 says it's definetly capable tests it and runs the "Crysis of VR" at max settings with no problems good testing linus :D
how about 8100 and a gtx 1060 3gb?
I'm assuming this largely remains true with SteamVR as well?
Someone is watching LowSpecGamer too much... hahaha~
I would consider it decent if the price was about $250-$299.
seems like vr would lend itsself well to mutable gpu rendering well since its two different images why can't they send off both eyes to differint cards?
6:22 4:20pm (?????)
750ti Dab
#FLATISNOTBAD
5:00 5$ eBay key fam ??
I would not put toilet paper tubes up to my eyes who knows what germs might be on them. I hope they are new and clean
140 bucks for windows 10 ??? So Microsoft forces people again to go Torrent ? ;-)
Really wish you'd have tested on the 1050ti with really low settings.
Don't build a PC you can buy a laptop with an i5 1060 for nearly that price...
just gonna wait for standalone to get better.
Altho I seen lowspecgamer take on this topic I wanna see how linus does it
Still waiting for the VR headsets to drop to a sane price before I go over :D But it's good to see the prices are coming down.
5:13 Wait, what? Linus actually still uses a GTX 980ti in a build at his house? This man literally has a shelf full of GPU's one and 2 generations newer, as well as AMD comparable performance models and he's still using a Maxwell card in a personal rig. That should speak loud and clear to anybody who is trying to build a budget gaming station for theirselves. You truly do not need the latest model cards and processors to have a great performing PC.
VR is Alive and Well
How about the oculus go? It's under $300.
Why not benchmark the 1050 Ti with a faster CPU to demonstrate your point? I'm curious what difference it would make.
I played beatsaber and onward with a gt 1030 and 4gb of ram yes its very possible and no motion sickness. I also have a htc vive
I think I’m the only one that has a gtx 780
I Tried this literally 2 days ago with a vive pro my buddy has, my rig is two gtx 780's and an fx8350 I was able to play doom on perfect frame rates, Everything ran stable on games such as beatsaber, skyrim, and 3 or 4 others. was pretty cool to see that they worked. my buddy was pretty impressed that it worked so well
90fps is BS, human eye can only see 8 fps
Didn't a Oculus founder fund a internet troll farm for Trump?
linus waving that rtx 2080 around in the beginning made me incredibly anxious
Its great what there doing but alas I prefer HTC over Oculus
;inus i dont get why no test this on more old hardware. i have a galaxy gtx 680 4gb edition on a n htpc running with a i5 2400 and 16gb of hyperx dd3 1600 and plays fallout 4 vr, the climb, sarento and project cars 2 flwalessly (not on super max out setting but close). and i have my main rig running a i7 8700k with 2x 1080 msi gaming x on sli and the diferance is nothing to complain about
what camera did you use for this video? I know it's not the same camera from the other videos.
did linus say he games on a 980 TI......
I love how nobody uses a vr and didn’t care but he still posted That’s linus Hahahahahhahahahah
It is sound cheaper in USD But when I convert it to my local currency, it is more expensive than 2 years ago... I mean.. my local currency is decreasing that much $900 is same as $1000 from last year. FML or in this case FMC
Love the disembodied hands. Shades of Dr Terror's House of Horrors!
“Flat Mode”, the way you always play it Linus..
Thanks for the tips for vr uhm here's something cheaper Viewmaster
can you use a gtx 970?
Corsair LPX DDR4 for 71 USD? Works only with Intel?
I swear the Vessel Shirt is being Worn for "Triggering People"
Buying the Oculus puts more money in the pockets of Lizard Zuckerberg.
7:51 hi to you too
I prefer James Jtechnology Journey
I understand this is sponsored by Oculus, but if we're taking about VR on a budget there's Playstation VR. Maybe you already have a PS4. Farpoint, Moss, Astro Bot, Firewall Zero Hour are some exclusives and it's getting better very quickly. I only mention it in case someone is interested in VR and PC VR is still expensive.
PSVR is good to go!

Ill just say it here because i am a huge outlier i got my pc for $400 has windows home a intel i5 gtx 1060 8gb of ram 3 usb 3.0 ports 2 usb 2.0 ports and what i think is a thunder bolt port from a walmart clearence sale
I have a oculus dk2 and my pc is a only a fx-8350 and a r9 280x and it runs assetto corsa and dirt rally fine and I brought the headset second hand for $210nzd (about 105usd)
Hey Linus I was wondering if you could do a video on the best CPU for VR, I have an 7 year old cpu and I'm using it to run VR I think it might be whats causing the frame drops. Thanks
Lol 1060 is not budget. I'd try a used 970 or R9 290.
Its more like the best way to kill your eyeballs - VR.
Makes video on how to be for cheap. Videos sponsored by oculus rift ?????
linus has never met lowspecgamer, I wish there is a collab between linus and lowspecgamer
I really like my windows mixed reality lenovo vr
Do a video on a "premium vr" experince. Like what would it look like on a quardos with NVlink? What does it take to get a high quality VR? Is it even possible? I'm taking High settings on a next gen HMD like maybe the pimax or vive pro.
Yes get really old vr headsets or get google cardboard
Oculus is a better sponsor than apple
An HP Windows Mixed Reality set can be had for around $180. Spend that savings over an Oculus on some pc parts
How would it perform on a q6600 with the 1060?
Knowing Linus I thought the budget pc would have a 1070ti and 8700k
flat mode? I like the sound of it ( ?° ?? ?°)
Well, I guess I don't have to find out if my system can handle VR. I'm running the same GPU as you do at home.
was that a 1060 3gig or 6
900 isnt really budget
These clickbait-y thumbnails is starting to get pretty out of hand..
A gtx 1050 works great for super hot and beatsaber.
copy of RGinHD and lowspecgamer
The 1060 and RX 480 were both advertised as 'VR Ready' on their respective releases. Of course you can use the 1060 for VR. Waste of a video.
A ps4 isn't that powerful, and it can run (a decent) VR
Can you guys do a video on how to run GTA 5 in VR.
who buys windows for 140 $ ?
send vive
I'd love toknow how much you'd need to overclock a 1050ti to get a palyable system?
Some graphic cards say that they are vr ready but they're not, you need at least a little bit more expensive pc setup than a entry pc setup
My pc has a ryzen 1200 @ 3.8GHz and a gtx 1050 ti. Could I pull off VR?
I don’t know why I’m watching this. My 8700k and 1070 aren’t exactly budget.
I bought VR waay ago, right now the prices for it are budget in my eyes :D
VR will not take off for gaming unless they can offer a consistent 'couch' experience. People don't wanna come home and play a game where they have to stand and move around. the controllers for VR schemes are really bad
Did linus jus say his home set up has a 980ti wtf?
A budget would be more like amd fx cpu or a g4500
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home" It really do be like that sometimes
I guess a 1060 is dirt cheap... Now that we've got RTX LUL
I was hoping this would be a video about all the cheap microsoft headsets from the likes of lenovo and hp Not another garbage advertisement video Linus is such a sellout, the ign of tech tubers
Can you do this again, but with team RED?
i have a gtx 1060, a core i5 possessor and 18 gigs of ram should that be vr ready?
The GTX 1060 6GB that I bought more than a year ago literally has VR Ready written on the box... So it's not like it was impossible to use it for VR before?
The $399 price drop rift is nothing new, and WMR headsets can be found for around $200.
as if you can enjoy RGB with that kinky mask on?
I thought they were actually going to talk about low budget alternatives to the Oculus Rift..... Would have made a much better video imho..... Edit: Or at least it would have been a great thing to add to the video!!! I mean come on LTT! You know you're talking about budget but you forget to consider the headset, controllers and other VR components cost about as much as the PC.... for shame.....
You could have tested with an rx 570...
I use my Note 9 with Gear VR. Good enough for me.
But can it play climb?
PERFECT video for me. Medium system, hopes for VR, often wondering when the sweet spot will be on price to quality for hardware and then what kind of bump I'd need so.....NICE!
Ever since I switched to Sim racing in VR, I've never been able to go back even if I wanted to!
Witch 1060? There's like a jungle of them now...
I don't want the VR spec to go down, I want the headset cost to go down. $120 MAXIMUM for VR porn.
I had an i3-7100 2C 4T 3.9 GHz and a R9 Fury. It ran most VR titles fine, however and surprisingly, Rec Room which has among the crappiest graphics of most VR games, told me that my CPU may not have enough threads to play properly, and it was right. Often during paintball or other activities it couldn't keep up with the player movements. Swapped to a 7700K, no more problems.
So "cheap" VR head set is an oculus, which is the price of a PS4. which you need a 980-1080 GPU (about the price of 2x PS4s) and a steam account filled with VR games. I sum this up as 4xPS4's which in my local RRP is about $2000 . An average second hand car 1990's would set you back about $2-3000 for comparison. Cheap certainly doesn't mean the same thing these days lol
Rift, Ryzen 5 1600x, 1050ti runs most titles without noticeable drops.
No one is asking this but was teh 1060 a 3gb or a 6gb? because i have a 3gb and Im desperately trying to find this information
If you have window.. Or.. Whatever ?? If you know what he mean ??
Honestly I love VR - every year I go to conventions and expos and have a blast. But I don't have it basically because it's still kinda Gen1... even if there's been several gens lol. I could atually get on board with the price if I knew more big games supported it, that it was gonna be a 5 year investment, etc. But it still feels like most of the games are gimmicky VR games you'd absolutely never pick up otherwise, and you kind of just expect there to be a next gen or new standard for VR just around the corner. I like it a lot -NOT FOR ALL GAMES, but for some - and I'm very interested. bit by bit it will keep getting cheaper and then I'll be in, especially if anyone comes up with a standard so you can pick and choose various different branded parts
1060 3GB or 6GB?
excellent video. very informative. thanks!
"The Climb is sort of the Crysis of VR". Good job Linus except, it's the CryEngine and Crytek (Same game engine developer and the same in-house content creation team.) lol Educate these masses Bro!! The CryEngine began its life in Farcry 1 by Ubisoft then Crytek had EA produce the Crysis games. Crytek didn't agree with EA on several things so the "Crysis" legacy ended. EA probably owns IP rights on the Crysis games so it would explain how Crytek was the driving force behind Crysis but was having money trouble. EA are a bunch of money grubbing A-holes! Who here hasn't noticed the trend of releasing titles in $150 "Delux, Platinum, Gold, Exclusive" Bullshite?! How is it that development for video games is cheaper and easier than ever and people are paying 3x the "$40-$60" range??!!
i have 1050 and a core i7 8700k
You forgot a great VR game: Beat Saber
Fallout 4 and Skyrim may not have been designed explicitly VR, but they are probably the best fps in VR.
It's boring to me, I've tried it. It will take way longer before I'll look at it again and until hardware and games evolve for it to much better experience.
Without watching the video.. Ryzen 5 1600, GTX 970, bought used PC and went from there. Spent maybe 600 for the PC and 400 for the rift. No problems other than the rift just really being a pain. Possibly just the cables they use are shit but I'll wait till next gen stuff
I built a similar budget system at about the same price. Ran great even with 8gb ram just couldn't open too many windows until I upgraded to 16gb.
It’s absolutely cool stuff to have but it’s still expensive. Likely there are headsets were you can put in your smartphone to experience 3D with supported apps, now if they will also come with accessoires & apps for different systems, we then can use our smartphones with a ps4 or win10 pc etc,,,, without forking out $ 350 dollars for an official ps4 or pc headset!!!!
I have played over 1000h of VR and I can tell you 90 fps is not "required to prevent motion sickness". Fallout 4 (which I have played over 200h in VR) sometimes runs at like 30 fps and I don't get motion sickness at all, even after like 8h straight. It is just a matter of getting your "VR legs". Back when I was using the Oculus Dev Kit 2, I used to get motion sickness after like 10 mins of free locomotion (using thumb sticks to walk) in games. My specs are i5 3750k, GTX 970, and 8gb of ram. Processor, motherboard and ram are all from 2012. I have over 100 VR games combined on my steam and Oculus libraries. Most less demanding VR games easily run at 90 FPS. Edit: Oh, I forgot to mention that I play everything with all VR comfort options turned off. I do still get motion sickness from flying sims and rollercoaster sims.
but no amd test? hmmmmmm
Who the heck has an I3 running an AIO
So my gtx 980 lives on in the new VR world? Yay!
why not just get like an evga sc15 at that price?
opens PcPartPicker Clicks on Guides Boom. Question answered.
And yet I still can't do VR on my 900$+ PC build because it's a tad outdated. ;P
My GTX 1060 6GB did say VR Ready...
I run an i5 6500 and 1050 ti with Windows Mixed Reality and I have not had any problem with motion sickness from lack of frames.
Can a laptop with a GTX1060 and a i7700HQ and a USB 3.1 port suffice? asking because laptops are not as powerful
I will not be impress until it works on the 69$ computer
jes all you need is a android smartphone with wifi ac or wired via usb to the the gaming rig, and the apk vridge and the windows app riftcat 2.0. and viola vr on a budget
S Y N T H E T I C frames
I am already getting VR for my godlike laptop from 2010 so I guess you can?
I totally thought Linus was going to talk about the Oculus Go or the Oculus Quest.
Beat Saber ??
Sponsor ship aside, what is better: Oculus rift or HTC vive?
Do you think running an i5 6400 and GTX 950 could do? Better cpu but worse gpu
1050ti? I only have a stock 760 2gb : / not as modest as I thought.
Facebook (or HTC) needs to fund game development for VR. That's how Nintendo got games for their consoles.
im sad... my computer is exactly ONE generation too old to run VR. (i5 7400, GTX 1050 2gb). Hey, at least im getting a new one soon! (Ryzen 7 2700x, GTX 1070ti 8gb)
Thanks for covering VR Linus tech Media! Even if sponsored ?? VR needs mainstream!
Uhh.. yeah.. I do VR at max setting with an Oculus Rift 3 sensor room scale on a first gen x58 980x system with 12GB ddr3 and a GTX 1060 6GB. Those items overclocked offer 4.02 Ghz on CPU, with a passmark of 10800 and a cinebench of 1000 (998)... the GTX 1060 is @ +212 and +700,...I don't know if I'm even using any of those helper features... I know I have the oculus Async and spacewarp off... but the nVidia one is news to me. That said... oh, Ram is at 1600 btw... but uh... that said, it all works fine... I don't get motion sick really, so if I dip from 90 per eye, I really don't even notice it or care. Though that said, most everything runs incredibly well even at max settings.. oh, and the system ranks in the top 87% on 3dmark... so yeah... doesn't take a lot, just takes some smarts ... a little bit o smarts... I wouldn't use a 1050 or an i3.... seems idiotic. But with some basic reason and logic you should be good with a pretty modest system, at least in regards to cost. And you can often find an x58 system for free, then piece together the fastest bits after the fact. ALSO, windows 10 STILL allows the use of windows 7, 8, and 8.1 keys to be used with it free of charge... and everyone has an old COA on an old system with a 7, 8, or 8.1 key... likely for pro versions... so if you are buying widows 10.. you the biggest idiot of them all. They give that shit away for free, on purpose.
We need haptic suits and 360 treadmills before I'll be willing to drop a grand on vr. Its just not a complete experience yet.
The rift is really well optimized when you tweak some things (running the rift on an amd fx 4100 overclocked to 4.2 Ghz (3.6 default) + Gigabyte G1 Gaming X1 Xtreme gtx 1070 8GB) (45 fps limited)
900 USD for an i3 + 1060 build? WTF? Even if that's in Canadian Rupees not FreedomBucks™ it's still way too much; you can get a build with the same performance for ~500USD + Windows.
lol yep still don't give a shit...
Hehehe... I still don’t have $400... But I can get everything else...? Tbh, I thought this video would give me a vr alternative, forgetting this isn’t low spec gamer XD
What's better than VR? VR with Ray-tracing... RTX On
thank you so much linus really i will get my first gaming pc in 2019 : Gigabyte arous gtx 1070 i5 8400 16gb 3000mhz ram and i thought it wasn't enought but now i am so happy thanks :)
Plus the price of the headset :/
Right after the +1000$ pimax 8k was out
can confirm that a 1050TI can run VR rather well (paired with a ryzen 5 1600, but that should not really change much) I do use a vive as well
no ad right before the review? What sorcery is it?
I wish he could build me a gaming pc i play on a computer with no graphics
What do you mean 1050ti is the most modest you can do? I wish I had a video card that strong.
I'm tired of people acting like you can't ever turn down settings on VR games. Any modern midrange PC is technically VR ready. Yes, it might look worse, but you'll still have high FPS. This is like the idea that any modern console game could be ported to the Xbox 360: there's no technical reason not to do so, only practical ones.
Linus: Drops RTX Card Me: Ohhh good god
I found this informative and interesting. Could probably dive a little deeper if possible? Probably explore how network (internet) latency affects immersion?
Linus I heard you needed friends so sent you a friend request ;)
Oof looks like I gotta upgrade from my trusty 1050 ti then
love the OG doom swag??
Is every video a sell out thing? I understand he has a lot of people to pay, but this is insane.
You can get Windows mixed reality really cheap. I got mine with controllers refurbished for 135
I'm still rocking my head tracking and it works just fine and if not better than rift in certain games.
can you please review fove VR - it has eye tracking and 2440p and its only 599... is it worth it? im about to shell out 1600 on vive pro and maybe another 1400 on eye tracking. thats another computer price.
i was only half hoping for linus to play vrchat..
hey Linus can i come to your warehouse?
if it went that will i say you can go even lower spec!!
Glad that my i5 and GTX 1070 will be enough
$140 for windows? Ahoy!
can my msi gs65 vr ready? if i buy a oculus would it run well?
I'm to lazy for VR. I wanna sit in my chair or on the couch while playing a game. If i'm supposed to sweat in my freetime, i'll go to the gym.
I just don't get VR, all that hassle and money to play vomit-inducing walking simulators.
Save some more money and get a Lenovo Explorer instead of a Rift. You get full room-scale VR without any external sensors, high resolution than the Rift, and it's only $180.
Isn't occulus still doing sketchy stuff with Facebook
for a new PC builder, I ran an AMD rx 570 and a ryzen 3 1200, and it was able to handle almost every game I threw at it...all except for The Institute in Fallout 4 VR, that was the only place in the only game that I experienced noticeable drops in FPS
The stated question of the video in the title doesn't get addressed properly and is better answered on other smaller channels. This is a ten minute video that's no more useful to watch than checking Facebook's minimum specs page. Your method for seeing if the system can run VR is to run it against a benchmark, which you acknowledge isn't necessarily an indicator of real world performance. Then playing for a bit and saying whether it 'felt' like it ran well or not, with no mention of what in game settings or measures you used to improve performance. There's nothing wrong with running sponsored videos but there's no reason this video couldn't have been more informative, with actual testing rather than purely marketing.
this is a big step for vr!
Nice vid linus
How much harder is it to run the htc vive??
Lol, people still use the word 'paradigm'? :D
980ti lol u tramp linus
????!!!!
Hey thats my system!!!
I played vr on a gtx 1050 ti. Im getting a 2070 this Friday tho
Should I get a htc vive or oculus rift
LOL I RUN VR ON MY RX460
Oculus mentions the GTX 970 as minimum and with some technology updates it might be possible to even use a gtx 960. Then linus shows how it's running on a 1060, which isn't just faster in general but also uses new VR technology...not sure what the point was.
I was hoping this was going to be about the headset prices not the pc...I’m fine on that end
Question for people who know about computers: I have a amd fx 8320 8 cores 3.8 hz processor 16 gb of ddr3 1866hz ram and a 600 wat 80+ psu. Could my system run a 1080 ti?
LowSpecGamer has already answered the question.
I get recommendations on videos like 'you can't see 4" and "you don't see more than 60hz". Can you make a video or two about that?
Im using i7 3770 with 16 gb and gtx 780 with my oculus its nice and all but i still want to upgrade cuz i cant play high demanding games
i wish linus had another channel like Linusgametips
the capture almost gives me motion sickness without VR, if the framerate isn't choppy, then surely the input could use a tad bit of smoothing
2018 and still beating the dead horse. Sucks to be Facebook who bought the bad apple for few billions and can't make the investments back lol And over 1000$ rig ain't even budget for most people.
Can I run vr on lower pc like core 2 duo ?
Mixed reality ...
*turns off rgb* *24 fps*
approaching nirvana is a throwback and a half
Cough cough, gearvr + psmove
Here's a "game" that I'd like you to try to run in VR with that setup. "DCS World". I can almost guarantee that you will have to lower the graphics settings to a point where the game is so ugly its not worth running in VR.
What about AMD GPUs... I mean the Radeon RX 570 is right between the GTX 1050ti and the GTX 1060??
VR games are like going back to 2000 and playing on a VGA monitor with terrible frame rates / resolution on rails. The day I see main stream games being played at 60+ fps at 4k+ ill buy a unit.
I would get VR but I don’t know if I could live without VR ray tracing.
For Boxing Day last year, I bought an Acer Nitro 5, that came WITH an Acer windows MR headset, and it was $1200 Canadian. That's about $920 US. Ran everything fine It was the one with the i7-8750 and the 1050ti
VR LUL
1080P?
Was going to question why Luke didn't do this video.... Then I saw it was sponsored by oculus ... Yeah I don't think they'd like a rant
i got 900$ if anyone knows a good gaming pc im looking at the HP-Omen right now
Wait This Video is only up to 1080p.........
I have a Lenovo Mixed Reality Headset. I got it at a Newegg sale for $200+ shipping. Hell of a steal. Paired with my 4790K PC with a 1060 is well worth it. I can even use it with my 1050 Lenovo Yoga laptop and my media center with a 4790 (non-K) and a AMD 380X. My Yoga struggles, but it can do simple VR. My 380X desktop (Dell) skips a few frames every now and then, but I won't replace the 380X any time soon, unless I replace my 1060, then I'll put the 1060 in there... More than likely, I'll give that PC to a family member in it's present state and build a new desk rig.
when Linus' bare bones PC is better than your PC
Wow that's quite surprising how well that rig handled VR. Props to the manufacturers and game devs for optimising VR so well so quickly. I'm picking up some cheap old parts to upgrade from my $200 trash can atm, and hadn't considered if they'd be VR capable, but going by this video they should work a treat (i7 4790k and GTX 1070Ti).
Aww no ryzen 3 2200g vr :(
Oculus Quest. Cant wait.
I'm good with stand-alone VR headsets. I have a Lenovo Mirage Solo (I preferred it's 6DoF and superior battery life to the Oculus Go which I didn't like very much).
Got my Windows MR Headset for 130$ I think that's all that needs to be said
ASW is shit - fact - no body utilises it and turns it off.
You should have overclocked the 1050 ti. It widens the gap a lot from min spec.
Why not just get a mixed reality headset for $150 on Amazon, that thing runs on a 1050
surface pro 3 i5-4300U 2core + 2 virtualized processors no dedicated graphics card? maybe?
urgh yet another sponsored vid, lots of those on your channel right now. Not good
What about a review of the new Samsung Oddysey VR Plus that got released recently to compare it against HTC Vive Pro? :) Nice video though!
Linus please can you do a video on how to make a android game
Turns out I have a vr ready pc at home and even my laptop fullfills the bare minimum specs .-. Now I only need a VR headset. Though looking at the news I'll wait at least for the next gen
PS VR?
Thank you sooo much for this one! how far can you psh this cpu to gpu ratio? any good estimations or tools out there? A ryzen5 2600 OC with a 2080TI?
I’m really not sure what the purpose of this video was, pretty much everyone that is interested in VR, knows that the GTX 1060 is the best budget gpu for VR. I mean I understand that the cpu can be more budget oriented but that doesn’t really warrant a whole video, and to put the cherry on top, I purchased a Windows Mixed Reality headset for 150 dollars!! And WMR has improved drastically since Linus last did a video on it. So really it seems like Linus might have just made this video for the sponsor, which I completely understand but hey, it is what it is
>399 dollars >on a budget
good to know. glad prices went down.
Ssoo, my geforce 710 wont work?
"Flat mode"
I own a rig with an AMD FX8350 and a GTX1060 6G, is it as good as the i3 rig or would the Fps drop and if so ist it possible to play VR with it?
But Linus. Flat is Justice. Especially at 1440p 144hz.
Oh, so you made this video "just for me" because of my previous complaints. Thank you :)
That framerate though
I'm sad that there hasn't been much word on what HTC is up to with the vive ;( Don't get me wrong VR is VR and any improvements is great, it's just that I'm a Vive owner that feels flooded with Oculus news
awesome video as I have been looking at VR a lot lately, but for sim racing - would these kind of specs correspond for that kind of use?
Tape a mac pro to your back and run VR with it.
Just the video I needed.
Will any quad core work?
For me the problem isn't getting hardware powerful enough to run VR. My current rig would have no problems. The problem is having the space to set VR up. You should do a video about setting up VR when your space is limited.
If you want VR for cheap, go to your local mall Your welcome...
More VR!
Cheap ass rgb led stripe with remote and controller 10$ from aliexpress.
i wanted to test my pc as ive been interested in vr for racing simulators i play and i was surprised by the results. USING: Intel Core i3-6100 dual core NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti windforce It managed to crank out 3982 on the orange room with an average of 86.81fps. which places it just above the minimum mark to run oculus vr i may get an oculus yet haha!
he sayed his home rig is a gtx980 ti please tell me that was a slip
Honestly just buy a windows mixed really headset. They run well and cost half the price of the Oculus with no real downside.
Still waiting for the NerveGear...
ayyy i have a gtx1060 amd ryzen 2700x 8 cores 16 threads(overboard cpu)
I highly doubt it but just hoping 1050 i3 will work Edit: I’m like 1 min into the video and I have a i3 7100 and a 1050 so it’s slightly lower than mininum
I followed this for 5 fucking mins and then the bloke says $1k fml
I run VR on a 1050 (mobile) and an i5 7700HQ.
Get r5 2600, much better value, but it's GPU bound anyway, and now 1070ti is the best value too.
I used a Dell Precision T3500 with a Xeon X5670 and 24 GB of RAM with a GTX 970 and it can play VR easily.
Buy your virtual boy now
But can it run minesweeper?
I really appreciate you covering some VR! I think VR is quite incredible, even at this early stage, and doing a VR-centric build was really cool.
For PC there's absolutely nothing to play in VR.
Nice doom poster
But can it be run on a Pentium g3258 anniversary edition?? ??
My budget 7.65€ what can i get?
thanks for crushing dreams oculus
The outro music is Sugar High (Approaching Nirvana)
I run my Vive on a laptop. I'm not kidding.
Everybody knows that putting a lot of RGB LEDS in your PC makes it 1x as fast.
Virtual reality! Cutting edge technology for games nobody wants to play more than 5 minutes. Awesome!
$200. Oculus go. No phone or laptop
"production manager" u guys are really felling your selves
pretty sure people knew that you could use a 1060 for VR....
If they can find a way to implement a physical system to prevent the user from running around and toppling things, then that's when the tech is actually feasible as a gaming machine. Right now it's pretty limited and is nothing more than a novelty toy.
Sony did the "frame guessing" for smoother framerate in psvr two years ago
Ivan's accent in 6:08 makes that soo much funnier
Try flight sim Aerofly fs 2.0 in vr mode,.... Awesome....
Linus looks like a crispy toast 7:46
VR is going mobile probably They couldn't make enough money with the PC headsets
300 ish euro for a VR headset is just too much in my opinion. I bought a 3d monitor when they were all the rage and while its fun for a couple of days/weeks the novelty quickly wears off and then (in the VR headset case) you'd be stuck with a pretty pricy paperweight.
The RX570 should be able to meet the spec then, would like to see a follow up/compare NVIDIA and AMDs VR tech.
Can it run on my I5, Intel inside 620, 8gb ram? ??
Gtx 960 + fx 6300 vr ready thoughts?
It's called Dave and Busters
The answer? Yes. I have a secondary VR rig comprised of a Q6600, 780 Ti, Oculus DK2 and PS Move Controllers. Cost me around £200 total. Works great at Low/Med settings.
a oculus in my country cost as much as my pc which is not a cheap one here(7700k, 1060 6gb). So no vr for me...
Back yard got this bro
I am running a very similar system at home with a ryzen 3 1200 instead of the i3. Now I know what to expect off VR. Thx Linus!!
So what we've learned: The minimum specs that oculus provides is a pretty good indicator of your PC's capability.
was hoping you Would atleast test out the 1050ti ingame
could somebody please tell me if an AMD Radeon r7370 4gb gddr5 is ok? got an I 7 and 16gb ram.
phlat mode
I uessed that he used a core i5-8400 cpu and an rx 580 gpu. Let's see what Linus really used to help play VR content.
VR is bulshit for years now, we don't care. instead get out and meet real people
I have an old system that I used to run the HTC Vive when it first came out. It had a slightly overclocked GTX 960 and a $60, 6 Core AMD FX Processor clocked at 3.5 GHz. It passed the SteamVR performance test and could run games like Onward on Low-Medium settings and games like Audioshield at Medium-High settings. Although I bet it dropped under 80FPS every once and a while, I never noticed any stuttering after I adjusted the in-game settings and never got motion sick. You could build a very similar computer to that one for roughly $400 (including windows 10) right now. I know newer games are going to be more demanding, but I also haven't tried it with Oculus's ways to "increase performance."
I play oculus on a 1050ti with an i3 7100, works fine for me, though at Christmas I'm going to upgrade to a 1070 as big games like marvel super powers run very poorly. (I'm also gonna get an i5 7500)
lol I also use a 980 ti for vr gaming
The tech that helps fill out frames on drops need to be constant in order to not suck when it kicks in, especially in racers. It's nice you can cut down the required specs but just too bad there's no Astro Bot or Firewall or Honor and Duty: D-Day (32 player WW2 battle royale).
But Can the RTX 2080 Ti and i9 can run vrchat at 91 FPS with 30 ppl (with unoptimized avatars)
didn't understand 80% of the things you said in this video but it was still good
You shoulda gone the windows mr route, I got mine with controllers new for $140
who tf pays 140$ for windows when you can get it for under 10$ from ebay
well on my oculus rig, it runs any game max with an i5 and a 1050ti. and probably cost way less than $900. maybe. i don't know it was a gift
will a 3gb 1060 be able to handle it tho? .... says that it should... but will it?
Umm..... OCULUS GO?!
you can make a bootable usb stick using the microsoft media creation app and you can activate windows for $5 using a key from ebay which you will receive in like 1-2hours the same day its not a scam i did it mutiple tiimes jus make sure you get the right key
I'm still waiting for Oculus drop the faith to $99, if it's happen, "auto buy" will be my first reaction...
"some of the RGB nonsense" what! Dislike.
A gtx 1060 is not budget. It's half the price of my entire system.
My rig is a Ryzen 5 2600 and a GTX 1070, great rig to play VR in :3
OR WEREVER....LIKE IM GONNA PAY 140 DOLLARS FOR A Windows I GET for free...i only support small devs
?? Youtube +??Comments +??Originality +?? This folder is empty
Honestly, if the title is "Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" you should check for other VR Solutions as well instead of only Oculus Sponsoring. Check VRRidge / RIftcat with Android. THAT is VR on a Budget (14$ + Initial Smartphone cost, I think) This is getting a common theme in the videos lately, you don´t give the full picture anymore. Seems like you choose "the easy way"
But when will we get VR for the Xbox one X as promised
I played almost all the games on my i5 and gtx 960 ti perfectly but now oculus updated so i have to upgrade my gpu.
low spec gamer is shaking a fist at you right now
the video I was waiting for since I was born! well propably not :'(
Linus Tech Tips has turned into some sort of Advertisement inception Ad inside an Ad inside an Ad
I REAAAALLY want to know what you call "max settings" in The Climb, because even my OC'd R5 1600 + GTX 1070 combo can only run most levels at 45fps with not-even-maxxed-out settings. I even saw the 45fps warning popup in your video (07:24). Stop lying ;)
For curiosity 1050ti with better CPU isn't enough?
Wow thanks Oculus now i can enjoy PS one graphics strapped to my face
Eum... Nvidia's VRworks isn't implemented in practicality any games right now
Just look at the potato masher vr video, running vr on a 1st gen i5 and a 760
Damn. I've got a plenty powerful enough CPU but only a GTX 960 and no money to upgrade...
Alright linus, we need to talk about the titles and thumbnails on the most recent videos (This one is less bad) They are pretty clickbaity. it's getting a bit out of hand
oculus LUL
Liked for having Wolf3D and Doom in the background :P
quite wrong ,gtx 960 is a pretty damn good graphic card yet you cant vr on it , you need modern GPU to play vr
Imagine when VR evolves into NerveGear like in Sword Art Online and you just need lay on bed and say link start to full dive inside a game to play it.
Now i am checking WMR with i5 (1150 socket) and older HD7870 videocard. This videocard was in old times strong videocard. The first WMR tests went pretty good on automatic settings, but need test more VR games to see limits of old HD7870. I come back later with results. Another PC with i5-2500 CPU (that is old 1155 socket) and GTX1060, is also pretty interesting low budget pc. That is because socket 1155 CPUs are much cheaper than socket 1150 cpus. Think about it.
Try and play project cars 2 ????????????
This is terrible research... Lowspecgamer did a proper budget build. Also my i5, RX480 8gb, 16gb ram is three years old, cost me 850 back then and runs vr great!!
Still have my windows 10 free because they offered "sign in with your outlook account". It's been 3+ years with free windows :)
my HTC Vive is actually really portable because i run it off a I7/1060 Laptop and cant say I am disappointed .
I love my VR systems (vive and oculus go and gear vr) but they all leave what i call "warpaint" in my face... it also hurts after a while. Even though I am a total VR fan... it is clear that we are dealing with an incredibly immature tech here with more flaws than features.
I have a phenom ii x 6 @ 4.2 GHz and a r9 290 works pretty well but would recommend a ryzen 3
So 1300 inlcuding the headset
Yeah it's called going outside.
Headsets are still pricey for what is still a niche thing in the grand scheme of things.
4770k 4.0 GHz r9 390 still get 5800+ in VRMark. the Free version is somehow locked on the Vive Settings, and i still average 126 frames. Now, considering i'll be playing Racing Games with an Oculus Dk2, i will be golden. Lower framerate requirements, lower resolution, not that good but 1000 times better than a regular monitor or tv for Sim Racing. It's a dated Pc but it gets the job done, and would still cost less than a current gen. Thank you for talking about VR, this technology really needs a bump. People are forgetting about it, Game companies have little interest in implementing VR on their games if they don't get sponsored.. (Codemasters Dirt Series and F1 Series)
Could my twin son game in VR on his laptop? Lenovo z50, AMD FX7500, 8GB RAM and AMD R7-M260DX 2GB graphics? He wants a oculus for Xmas but I don’t know if his machine can hack it. It can run most modern “Flat Games” well.
Was disapointed on this when i saw budget i thought you was going to go older gen products to see whats the best you can get out of older tech
Until VR has good games and the headset is light enough to not really "feel" it, ill never care about VR
VR is still mostly a joke. Not because VR is inherently bad, but because all these big companies clearly rushed in with garbage products trying to create a fad. We don't need VR that runs on every PC, we just need GOOD VR! Limiting the entire ecosystem for the sake of compatibility with machines that will have been long forgotten in a few short years is the most gross mistake I've ever seen from such a large group of people. Selling a $600 headset with what is equivalent to 720p 90hz displays was an absolute insult to gamers, dropping the price to $400 barely makes any difference, they're still trying to sell a piece of garbage for $400. The industry is moving on, I might get an Acer OJO 500 just for kicks but it's still disgusting that these devices are all limited to 90hz. THIS IS PC GAMING! LET US CHANGE THE REFRESH RATE! I will not be happy with VR until we have a headset with full 4K 120hz per eye, and even that should have been the entry point for the industry. "GOOD VR" would be 5K 240hz (again, 5120x2880 Per Eye, and 240hz Per Eye, with the option of alternating frames to get a doubled framerate of 480hz).
399$ on a budget... HMMMMMMM
By the way, Oculus rift 2 was canceled and developers are fired.
Hey Linus I've noticed in all your videos you reach down and interact with some type of device during your video's usually its in your pocket. Could you maybe explain that?
Well, I have a WMR lenovo explorer with a GTX 1050 2GB (overclocked it myself) and an I3-7100. Very surprised by the performance. Been playing job sim, beat saber, superhot vr, space pirates, gorn, the lab, ... All at a stable 90FPS.
Yes you can! Set your budget on the ground > Put on VR headset > Start playing > Stand on the budget > congrats, you are now gaming on a budget.
I mean I really still don’t want to spend 400$ on it
No
This is stupid, why would he do this video? Oh right its a sponsor...
Forget vr biggest vaste of money ever there no good games unless your into paying for unfinished rushed indy games that are way overpriced.
I only see on one eye, so 2D it is.
I felt pro until he used a gtx 1060 as budget hahahha
You can do vr with a ryzen3 1200 and a 1050 and it still works well
Budget VR = smartphone and a couple lenses. XD
Or just buy a ps4
WHYYY for 72.50$ you could buy an HDD 1TB (35/40$) and 120GB SSD (26$)!! Btw, nice video, as always. <3
I used to have an Oculus Go, however, I had to get rid of it due to the fact that yes I could wear my glasses while using it but after less than 5 minutes of using it my eyes would have a burning like sensation. I did later figure out this was due to my eyesight so I really spent £200 on a device I used for about a month and then took a loss of £50 when selling it. Just remember if you are going to invest in something like this have a go with it or if you have a friend who has one go and try theirs out. Also, gaming with one controller is honestly shite.
u mean gtx 1080ti u why the fucked would u use the gtx 980 ti ,
The lighting in the set was just perf
YOU HAD BEAT SABER RIGHT THERE AND YOU DID NOT PLAY IT!!!!! I HELD YOU IN HIGH REGARD LINUS! but now......
Thanks for showing off VR linus! You guys are helping it become more main stream!
So... don't even try it with my fx 8320e and gtx 770
I was able to run Pavlov and Beat Saber on a 2013 Alienware laptop, it had a GTX 765M (equal to a GT 1030 GDDR5) and an i7 4700MQ.
Dude my friend used a broken iphone as a screen and some razer hydra controllers from 2012 and a laptop with a 920M in it and got it to work in the middle of class and joined me in VRChat hes got the most ghetto setup in the world
Commercials as always with Africans. Occulus Aid for Africa: virtual food. I am wishing them success with their intended audience.
what a surprise, the 1060 which is also the lowest NVIDIA card with a "VR ready" sticker, can play VR..... you guys could've made this much more interesting
hahaha vessel shirt
resolutionscaling to 80% and a 1050ti, rx 570 or gtx 970 is all you need. I wouldn't recommend it though.
ASUS P8Z68 - I5 2500K @ 4.9GHZ - EVGA GTX 780 OC'd - 16gb vanilla RAM - 120gb Samsung SSD + 1TB Hdd - Corsair cooler - seasonic 750w focus gold - USB 3.0 PCI card - HP WMR headset running through active HDMI to DP converter for 90FPS. All bought 2nd hand except PSU and built myself, running all major Racing sims with a Logitech G920 no problem......Total cost under £400 for PC and £150 for wheel, pedals and shifter...…...If you do your research and use patience it's totally possible.
But how about a nice gtx970?
I even run with WMR headset on old i7 laptop with even more old GTX940M. Oh wait, can you run it? It can run, thanks to resolution slider to make it even lower to 900 pixels. Of course 900 is way too low, but WMR headset displays stayed on 1440 pixels so there are no big pixels. It's just more softer image and lower sharpness, but still same SDE. If you wear very old 900x900 headset, you can see pixels clearly. It just scale up the picture. I did even Beat Saber with GTX940M with adjusted resolution on ~950x950. The Labs is more heavy than Beat Saber, so at 900x900 i have slight better gameplay. But real budget is WMR. (200 Euro / 200 dollar around) because Oculus is still double in price. Oculus is not budget VR. Long time ago, Oculus is cheaper than Vive, before WMR came on market. That is why many users have Oculus / Vive. You should examine again, but with WMR headset. (and there is newer Samsung headset with new low-SDE amoled displays - which is also WMR headset).
something about VR ? Nice.
RGB NONSENSE ???
You guys should take another look at Windows Mixed Reality. It’s improved a lot since your initial video. For less than half the price of a Rift you can get 90% of the experience. I was expecting this video to mention WMR but then I saw it was sponsored by Oculus lol
VR HEADSETs are still very expensive
try VRChat? :D
Yeah google cardboard you can... Look at houses
Oculus Rift is a joke.
Wait why the fuck did windows jump up %40
You really need to do more budget VR gaming videos. You can get a brand new Lenovo explorer for half the price. $200
Let’s be honest, If you’ve shelled out a fortune to play VR, HTC Vive is gonna be your first choice.
i9 9900k and rtx 2080ti is all you need
vives turn Vive vive vive vive
Vr is so lit and I’m so excited for Oculus Quest
My main PC has a AMD A10 5800K 8 gb of ddr4 ram a R7 250 2Gb with a 1900 x 1080 screen it can run VR fine with Windows Mixed Reality hardware so you can have a weak ass PC as mine and can have VR just fine
So I guess my older gaming laptop with a i7 and gtx 860 2gb isn't going to vr. Sad but true. But rdr2 will fill that void for awhile.
Can the linus team do Star Trek bridge crew , why only a gtx 980 , why not a 2080ti upgrade for your vr setup.
Dam I only have an i3 6100
I got my pc near the end of last year and made sure it would be ready for vr because it’s something I’ve been very interested in. I built my pc for $500 with an i3 7100 I got on sale and a used gtx 970 for $150 right before mining really made them shoot up in price. I bought a wmr headset, the dell visor, for $150 on eBay, new in box, and I couldn’t be happier. The i3 and 970 handle vr amazingly, not just at bare minimal performance and settings. It’s a very comfortable experience, and I’m quite prone to motion sickness. I tried google cardboard and got nauseous immediately from all of the stuttering. A full vr setup can be easily achieved for $650 or less if you’re willing to be patient and search around. $900 is definitely not the true minimum.
Linus is the man i watch you every vid my sisser aan my brother also watch your tech tips you are learning me thinks every vid i followed you with 4 acc : every one who sees my comment / sub to me for luck in your life
Yes, it's called PSVR
i use a Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop i5675 (replaced the cut down rx560D) ryzen 5 1400 overclocked to 3.9ghz at 1.375v 8gbs of 2400mhz ddr4 ram gigabyte gtx 960 2gb 1tb 7200rpm system drive 1tb 7200 rpm steam drive 500gb 5400 old gaming drive for 20GBs of page filing for when vrchat uses up a lot of ram
Still waiting for the prices of the oculus rift (+ controls) to drop , here in Uruguay they are selling for almost 900 USD , so.... no today xD, interesting video in fact, already have a 1060 6gb and a 7th gen core i 7 , so... will test it with the superposition!
399? I'd rather buy a Ps4 Pro then :P
Thx for covering a similar rig to mine i have a gtx 1050ti and an fx 6300
Okay so you test One graphics card doesn't work you test another that's about double the price and then you call it good and that's your minimum spec why not test multiple graphics cards why not test older graphics cards on the used Market to show what kind of budget system you could run you also tested an 8th gen quad-core what about the second third and fourth gen I3 I5 is a people could have there's so much more you could have done with this video that you chose not to do
Could my computer handle vr well. Specs: 4gb ddr4 ram Intel core i5 Gtx 1060 (I think)
Bare minimum... So sad. You should've at least done dual 2080ti s with a 9900k
Interesting...last week steamVR implements built-in framewarp-alike mechanism (interpolating 2 frames onto the in-between frame) and now Oculus sponsors their headset video xD But tbh, oculus is insanely good for the price atm
CPU - AMD Ryzen R5 2600 - $160 Board - MSI B350 Tomohawk - $75 HS/F - Wraith Cooler (included with the CPU) RAM - G.SKILL AEGIS DDR4 2666 - $60 GPU - MSI Armor RX 580 8G OC - $225 HDD - Toshiba P300 7200 RPM - $85 PSU - EVGA 500W BQ 80+ Bronze - $40 Case - Fractal Design Focus G - $50 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total - $695 (w/o the OS) This $695 rig blows that rig in the video ($770 w/o the OS) out of the water for VR, gaming and general purpose computing. My OS was an upgrade from Windows 7, so I don't know the newer SKU's, but ever since microsoft started following apple, they doubled down on the service model by giving away their operating system for free to everyone. The downside is just a watermark/logo on the lower right side corner of the screen saying "Activate Windows". It just stays there forever, even if you don't activate. There are NO performance related issues whatsoever (in ANY tasks, mainly gaming, VR or general) on having an unactivated license. There are some enterprise features that are restricted if I remember correctly which are related to local networking, but nothing major. If you still want to purchase a Windows 10 license, head over to reddit's r/microsoftsoftwareswap and get it for around $40. No need for this $140 daylight robbery of a physical SKU. Before you ask, no, these are NOT illegal grey market keys generated through credit card fraud, like G2A and Kinguin. They're for UG students, but these retailers (some of them OEM's) are selling them online.
eeeeeh. What about Ryzen APU's..
Short answer: Oculus Quest Wireless No pc 6dof Controllers Anywhere 50+ games on launch 399$ Release: next spring
An i5 4670k and a R9 280x will give you the same performance costing only $100 each.
Real life Brendon Small from Home Movies all grown up
Why not an AMD 220GE instead of the i3?
Casually hold 1400 dollar ASUS 2080 ti that isnt available in NA lololz
i wouldnt trust linus to change the batteries to my remote
what about older CPUs, like the most infamous i5-2500k or i7-2600k? with for example an 1060 or 580?
ERm, Linus, are you stoopid? People's eyes can only see in 30fps, none of this matters you idoiot
A gtx 970 and r9 390 has been the minimum for years for vr. Having a 1060 puts it above minimum specs
I'm honestly not sure why y'all accepted this sponsorship deal. Oculus is owned by Facebook. Facebook is complicit in genocide. Their money should not be good anywhere.
“Superman Falls Sometimes”
I have Oculus Rift and my PC : Intel Core i7-6700k GTX 1060 3gb 16gb ram and I always play on a low setting for the VR games
980Ti?
What? A few hours ago i was searching for cheap vr and performances with 1050ti!!
During the testing you guys used 16GB of RAM, but when showing the price you guys only had 2 X 4GB of RAM, a bit sketchy.
The guy in the backround is bothering me he keeps looking and looking away and touching his pc even though he isn't using it
Try the PS move service, it works really well for me for under $100 (excluding a gear VR and compatible Samsung phone). Edit: For the setup, not the PC.
Not a fair test!! RGB adds 25 FPS everyone knows that
Hey bean, you can get win 10 pro for 14 us dollars on scdkey.com
Go AMD. It offers pretty much the same performance, but cheaper. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Victor70537/saved/#view=WzwCbv
My oculus is 8 months old .. main power wire is dodgy and one ear doesn’t work ... good fun but not reliable
you can go even cheaper by using the PSVR for steam games. Plus PSVR you can wear spectacles, with Oculus you can't unless they changed it recently.
400 bucks not including a computer isnt budget. Not a tight one at least.
VR ready but, I'm not. ??$$
Okay, as 'tech giants' in the online video world, you have a responsibility as of now... Why is there not a piece of tech available to alleviate the 'itchy balls' teleprompter problem??? Seems like there's a relatively easy solution, surely. Ask in a video, and I'll bet you spark some sort of small wave that creates a decent product to help the controls work far more seemlessly...
what a bummer, for me oculus costs 449 eur
Acer i3-8100, 8GB @ newegg for $399. Add EVGA GTX 1060 for $250 (after MIR). $650 for VR Gaming Rig.
I feel like VRChat should be tested when testing VR
"Where's your team spirit?!" "At home..." Fair, I guess...
Where's the R3 2200G? Low Spec Gamer played Superhot VR on it! On the APU graphics itself!
This was very disssapointing. For people ~~like my dad~~ with good enough PCs, but not a headset, made me think this video was about getting a cheap headset, but was just pc. my disappointment iss 10000%
When I saw the title I thought they were actually going to see how low they could go but this was disappointing
Everyone need to try VR. If u have place u can go and try...try it. you dont have to buy it now but u need to know what it´s capable of.
Have no idea about others, but I would enjoy headset that projects nice curved screen into eyes much more than immersive vr stuff and break something in my room by accident lol.
yay VR
Song at 7:50?
Shit channel, shit person, read your fucking comments and already sisband your company and kill yourself you fucking jackass.
Vrchat 45fps with 1070... Sad
You can buy windows on ebay for as low as 5$
Honestly, if it's just for games, I think a cheaper SSD would be MUCH better than a 1 TB HDD. For the price you listed of ~$70, why not a 480 GB SSD? I think half the space is definitely worth the speedy boot times and game load times. I know the standard used to be a big HDD and updating to an SSD for the boot drive later on, but after my own recent conversion I feel like starting with an SSD then getting a HDD later on when you need space for crap like school/work files or uh... "Personal documents" (aka porn) would work out better for most gamers. Anyone else agree?
linus and Budget in the same video is this heaven ?
This is joke, this is true budget vr test. https://youtu.be/gIc3oUByAbk And there is og ps4 + psvr and is cheaper then pc itself.
WAIT, LINUS USES A 980ti? NOT A 2080ti? HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN sorry for caps!
well thats good to know that vr is becoming cheaper to actually obtain
Okay linus.. uhm. I have an i5 4670 and a GTX 760, and i run VR quite well on my machine, although i am looking to upgrade to a 1060 sometime, but for now. My 760 and 4670 is really good for the price Btw i am using the oculus rift and getting solid 90 fps in most games
Linus:"Where's your team spirit?' Ivan: "At home." Fucking legend
Just get a vive
Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom 2, Unreal Tournament and Total Annihilation. Whoever works at that station deserves a raise
When Linus says your name. Haha
I have a Ryzen 7 and an RX 480, I'm noticing in Budget Cuts, loading screens and even Steam VR home, my controllers and sometimes my headset will kind of jerk back and forth while I'm moving. Is that hardware? Would upgrading my gpu fix that? I dont think its the tracking because it doesn't always happen for every game or VR application.
Upcoming reviews of pimax 8k and 5k? An updated opinion for 2nd gen vr? That'd be awesome exposure since pre orders are open right now! Awesome work as always!
VR capable GPU runs VR, who knew? lol
Linus has access to RTX 2080ti and uses a 980ti in his vr rig at home! What??!? Why??
Please do a Part II with actual games
I got i5 4460 3.2ghz 16gb ddr3 1600mhz nvidia gtx 745 2gb vram. Still can play vr with avg of 30 to 50 fps wen i lower the quality down
You're not shilling for Apple today?
You lost me at i3 8100 xD I run on an i5 3470/1050ti, and my friend on an i5 2400/1050ti. Get outta here with your "low" end cpu hahaha, that thing is far from a min spec cpu. Really disappointed y'all didn't even test the 1050ti. There are plenty of channels and vids out there showing real 1050ti vr footage, and that it is very playable. You basically showed everyone how recommended specs run. Great job.
well 400 dollars is still expensive
yeah the climb is just a measly tech demo even though it features varied levels, innovative mechanics, and interesting gameplay
What about the 1060 3gb
If you have a headset and an iPhone, there’s an app called Duet Display that can be used for some VR stuff. It uses a cable to extend the desktop to the iPhone lag-free. This works with anything that does split-eye VR. Think Dolphin emulator or VR movies. Works really, really well.
VR is just a gimmick IMO, it’s more for casual gamers...
Just buy a mixed reality headset for a couple hundred cheaper
Lol just boy the virtual boy
Imagine a VR game where you're playing as someone who is playing a VR game where they're playing someone who is playing a VR game.
I'm not anti-VR, and I like the production quality of this video. However, Oculus VR is still hopelessly expensive for anyone budget orientated, because even that basic system cost $8-900 (new). Then you have to almost double that for a decent Oculus Rift setup (headset, controllers, & cameras). And all to play what? A few free games, a few tech demos, and some AAA flagships that work better outside of VR? No thank you. Oculus/Facebook, if you're watching: You'd get a much better ROI if instead of trying to convince people that VR is cheap enough to even consider, you'd actually sponsor AAA, exclusive VR titles. Then people would actually want to spend money on an expensive system in the first place. This video is putting the cart before the horse, IMO. I say this as someone who's actually used the Oculus Rift.
i play vr with a 1050ti i5 7500 8gb ddr4 2x4 ram and a HP mixed really headset, The gpu was 150, Cpu and mobo were 200, ram was 90 and the headset was 160 lol
4:47 Superposition says 16Gb. 4:54 System has 8Gb of RAM!
If you really want to see VR on a budget then go and watch the Low Spec Gamers video
Vr on a budget with a 1060. At least try some older hardware and dont do things that say on the box "VR Ready".
They should do something with VR for Carpenters, Handy Man Dry walking etc would really make work project easy
What about the virtual boy?
Nice to see some vr content here. More people need to try this amazing way to play games. Starter to play vr games 3 years ago and 2D gaming is almost dead for me. VR is so much better
I have a Pentium g4560 and a 1050ti...... I definitely need to upgrade for vr
I was running my HTC Vive on a Phenom II X4 955 BE with a 750 ti. I had to turn the game settings all the way down while overclocking to the absolute max. But it worked and was fun and immersive. I've since updated my computer but it was still super fun on my old system which was way under what you guys are calling minimum.
Throws away monitor, uses VR with multiple Virtual Monitors instead! So, it's VirtualMonitors in VirtualReality on a VirtualMachine... mind blown...
I was personally actually fine running on a laptop with a GTX 780M!
f* gaming! Will VR porn run on 1050Ti ?
Are you sure it render at 90fps without RGB RAM?
Hey, how much for that signed Total Annihilation poster?
I get nausea watching it. The jitter is awful.
I thought that vr headset is budget edition or something
So I'm more than fine with a 6700k and a 1070ti? Good to know
I have an Acer nitro 5 I am ready for all and nothing
so you didn't even bother to test the lower end spec to give people your actual experience of what its like on a low wend machine? Whats the difference in experience between true 90 and a locked ASW 45? how annoying are the artefacts? Can you push the specs even lower than the min recommended 1050ti and if you do what sort of titles are you limited to? What about a second hand machine? i5 4460 and gtx 970 for $400 on ebay get you similar results? These are just the questions i thought up in 30 seconds! Pretty low effort video overall!!
The killer VR creation app is DREAMS on the ps4 !!!!
Am i the only one who wanted them to try VR on the 1050ti?
with windows mixed reality yes just need a strong enough pc fuck oculus and htc vive buy a cheap dell visor and customize it
Linus, do you really use a gtx 980ti at home? Why don't you use a gtx 1080ti or a titan V or a RTX 2080ti?
Mmmm you should test and amd system that would be helpful like say a Ryzen 5 1400 with a 1060
I have a Gtx 960 and I play all the major vr titles full ultra and 90 FPS haha
What would you recommend for pocophone to watch VR porn?
Bottom line, it's still tied with Facebook. Hard pass.
Linus's definition of "budget" is not the same as mine rip
VR is great for simracing, maybe do a review on that some day?
I used a GTX 770 4gb for Vr and it was playable in games like War thunder or Pavlov VR
I go outside for RR reality. Real Reality.
If youre using a nvidia card why dont you just use geforce experience and use the nvidia fps counter?
i think the newer quad core i3's are lots good enough for gaming these days as long as you don't plan on streaming
Raytracing x VR
Fuck you. I’m unsubscribing.
The whole "Facebook owns Oculus" thing has made me stay away from their products in favor of the HTC Vive, but it is really cool to see all the new VR stuff they've been doing.
But the RGB is what makes it so fast
Who pays 140$ for Windows 10, when you get a key for 15$ like everywhere
Aww, I was hoping it was an Oculus Quest review.
Just before this video I got a "Cybershoes" commercial, the tech seems interesting why don't you guys try to get a pair and try them?
Great video
i thought spiderman climb and superman fly...seems i was wrong
Occulus Quest?
How about a game like DCS World in VR, not these micro-VR games.
He games at home on a 980ti ?? somehow I don't believe that !
Not even close to SAO ??
Really linus? Really? 1991 called they want their paddle controllers back. You know really sucks? 2018 VR with stick controls/paddles, Hell even 90's VR had gloves. I feel that all the VR companies are just spinning their wheels just to make money. I mean 2018 we should have fully optimised Dual graphics cards (one for each eye), no screen door, 200 degrees field of view, Haptic gloves and suits and fully wifi aka no cables, and a kinda cyberith device, all for the price of $399 or £399. Not to mention the Trash games out there, this is why VR will not be bought by me until this is all fixed and is bundled together. Occulus /Vive / Sony / Pimax - Up your LAME ASS attempt at VR ... seriously. (Ohh and while your at it make the devices a global price not just screwing EU over and over and over again).
SLI on vr???
I wonder how much time it took to make the video while playing. I suppose not that much. But when the gear came off Linus had a red forehead and cheeks. So i'm guessing that VR is not such a good choice if you game for hours and hours and hours, i mean at least 12 hours a day.
I was hoping that my 850m laptop could run vr lol, guess I´ll keep watching Vr games on YouTube
any idea why i keep getting dropped frames and constant controlor lag when im gaming in vr? ive got a gtx 1080 and and i7 6700k
for some reason my dog loves watching linus videos...
When he said fast forward 2016 I remembered 21 Savage - no heart
The LowSpecGamer did this already! With even lower specs.
niggas wit one eye should get it half off
I am 14 and I want to get into making computers but I have no money or any way of getting money do you know any way I could start
7.1 M subscribers ... Well done team
Jesus.... Another advert, it never ends!
900+ $ without the VR Headset -> 1.2-1.4 k with it
owo i know work Great on AMD ryan 7 with 1060 because friends own one n play a lot smoother n later he got 2080 turn out was pieces of crap doesnt work well so he sent back for return his money n he bought other 1060 work goods i was supries he still playing with it but he doesnt tell nobody but me
https://youtu.be/S4TBPL7-iRk
Paid ads, as usual
It depends on the game. Of course a 1050 TI can't do Fallout 4 VR on high settings with supersampling on but most VR games/apps run just fine at least on default/medium settings.
VR or AR? you decide 1 like - VR 1 reply - AR
Do VR gaming booths in your LAN cafe already !
Should’ve covered oculus quest
Define budget!!!
Boi, the minimum was always a 1060, nothing improved from what I can tell
will a gtx 1070 ti and an i5 6700k work well for a lot of vr games?
2 uploads in a day. W0W 0-)_(-0
Really needed to highlight the Ram, Lone Echo runs like balls with only 8gb
I dont recall Sony Glasstron ever being considered VR. I do recall a Creative Labs VR headset a tech show in the mid to late 90s. It was massive, but Duke Nukem was intersting on it.
Haha, suck it losers. I'm getting an HTC Vive for Xmas! ???? (no offense)
"budget" 900+$
and what about a normal gtx 1050 (non TI) ? i wanted to buy an VR system to play beatsaber and wanna know, if its good enough.
But what about the vive? i am really curious, cause i am considering buying one to go with my razer blade (1060 6GB)
i game fine on an oculus with an r9 380 though i dont get motion sick unless im in a car for a few hours
"Budget" i guess that we have diferent ideas for what budget means
Well im running vr with a gtx 950m and its no problem). Seriously i can give you proof
Wow what a suprise. You used the minimum spec for VR and you managed to run VR. Amazing.
Finally a new VR video!
7:52
I have an GTX 1050 Ti and an Ryzen 7 1700 (I render a little more stuff). Will an Oculus Rift work for like RecRoom?
"If you already have Windows, "OR WHATEVER"". Nice dodging of pirate software suggestion. GG WP
Samsung Odyssey + here!! It may even be discounted blackfriday as they did last year!!
It gives me a headache because I'm blind. Be I need a bigger face shield, Braille laser's
Where's the RX570 and RX580? Two cards and one processor is not a thorough test at all.
The Radeon RX 580 cost less then a gtx 1060 and has more power.
Yep, that is about accurate. Although I think the RX580 8GB is better value here. You don't need the fastest stuff for VR. My Rift runs on a Ryzen 1600X and a GTX 980 4GB. Friends of mine play on Haswell chips with an R9 390X(Fine), R9 290x (Fine) or R9 270X (about minimum). Basically the "intermediate frame" stuff works really well. You don't need 90FPS all the time (although it is nice). You'll know when it becomes TOO slow though, because everything starts to shake when you move :P If you have a decent gaming rig of a couple of years old, it will probably run fine. If not? You can always do what Linus said, and buy a modest new rig ;)
but could a 1050 run it?
Would my overclocked first-gen i3 run this? :D
7:36 More like Spiderman, not Superman.
Scrapyard wars except the PC needs to run VR.
trash and overpriced cpu as always, you should get i5 3570k or 2570k.. or older ryzen
I keep hearing how great vr is for racing SIM's. Being able to actually focus on the apex of a turn, or your braking markers really helps from all accounts. Hopefully upgrading to a 1070ti or 1080 or 2070 depending on how the pricing trends play out over the next couple months.
I5-8400 and 1060 6gb should be fine right? (I hope)
Like your tshirt.
My old PC managed to get a higher score than that. FX-8300 with a RX 480 got a score of 4972
So hey I can run minimum vr sweet
No, thanks Mark Zuckerberg.
i wish i had a good pc like yours for gaming
Just buy the Google cardboard version for $15
Low spec gamer does vr on a smaller budget and doesn't require sensors too
I just got a Rift and i'm playing on a 750 Ti :p
I run vr on a 6 year old gtx 670.... with ryzen 5
I've always wanted to get into VR gaming, but my MMOs have kept me from devoting myself to a whole leap in play-style. This video might've just convinced me to go for it anyway.
Yay, an ad.
VR gloves or I'm not even going to consider.
*sponsored by Facebook
I shaved my car today
ok seriously with a inexpensive VR for your mobile phone a bit of software on the phone's side and on the computer side one can have a "good" not great not wonderful but "good" experience. Sadly the software in question is a bit unstable at times but still consider the cost of a high quality VR and gaming rig this works good enough. and yes it does work via wifi "Agian little lag but still not bad considering all i have strapped to my face is a piece of plastic and a phone. also you will never read this sadly.
The Oculus article by Verge. Well at least they didn't try to assemble the thing.
Did you use a 1060 3g or 6g
You could honestly do just fine with a Pentium G4560 and up. A GTX 1050 Ti and higher is also good as well. Consider the Lenovo Windows Mixed Reality headset as well.
Wow I didn't realize just how low the minimum specs were. I always thought my PC wouldn't be enough, I'm tempted to get a VR set now...
I find it funny that Occulus is sponsoring this video when they have officially canned their plans for the next generation of Occulus headets. Basically all of their talented designers have left at this point and Facebook has royally mismanaged the company. Not to mention their blatantly anticonsuner practices including their Occulus exclusives it really just seems like they want to push out the last of their headset stock so they can pivot away from VR.
When I hear Linus say modest, I thought 2700X+1080Ti because normal for them is 9900K 2080Ti and extreme for them is X user one PC projects.
Breaking News Tim Crook has 2 day meltdown: the dropoff in Apple's internet phone sells, must be, sharp if Tim Crook is hitting the full panic button in October. Yesterday went in on Bloomberg, today Facebook who doesn't even make phones so real cheap shot and Google. It's funny too watch. Apple already third choice for phone choice behind Huawei in 2nd and Sammy in first, in global market share. Crook must be down too selling one phone a day after that Bloomberg article of embedded spyware on the circuitboards. At least, that's what he is acting like, the bottom has fallen out of sales. If he is having a 2 day meltdown.
Alright ladies and gentlemen, it's time to start asking if it can run the climb!
No one buys oculus they all buy vibe and you know that
Just buy a Windows Mixed Reality headset for $150 on clearance untilreal next gen headset comes out with better resolution.
I knew the whole video when I saw Sponsered by oculus rift
Yes i actually just did... its called nolo vr
Il planning to buy a lenovo explorer or so And i have a low spec for vr ( even though its good for normal gaming) Will i be able to run games more easily than with a rift or vive?
I use a 750 2gb edition to run vr, how about that?
I love that your bare minimum is leaps and bounds ahead of the system I play vr games in.
yeah 900+ + 400 that makes 1300 for vr not cheap at all
but can it run the climb?
Why don't you buy windows from Kinguin?
This is virtually impressive. ;)
Oculus Quest ???
What about AMD?
https://youtu.be/L0HVsTxD2Zs
You should have done it with Rx 570
What is the game towards the end where the Ferris wheel turns into a mech spider?
@lowspec gamer, vr with AMD ryzen 2200g
finally a tech youtuber who adds the windows OS price on their budget
I thought you would have a 1080ti
RGB probably accounts for 90% of the system's performance.. Once my friend upgraded his althon 64 system with RGB lighting and it beat my 1080ti intel i7 8th gen system that has no RGB performance enhancers in timespy.
wtf in my country the cheapest oculus rift package is 450 EUROS, why in america its just 399 USD ? thats like a 100 Euros cheaper then in my country...
I hope one day I can get vr I've got a powerful enough rig but the headset and stuff is expensive
Get a Samsung Odyssey. $400, higher resolution than a Vive or Rift, no lighthouses, and no supporting Facebook if you bought a Rift.
Hey linus you are late to this, TheLowspecGamer has done a video on this 2 months ago
Meanwhile LSG: $160 headset + Ryzen 2200G.
i got my pc and wmr for around $950 all together with a 1060 3gb and ryzen 5 1600 its a pretty great machine for the price and I have never had an issue running anything sometimes it is a little slow to load but I have a 4tb hdd instead of an ssd so that could be a factor
"Look at me. I'm like Superman." Ah yes. Superman. Famous for his wall crawling abilities.
CPU/GPU/System specs is NOT the issue but the price of VR headset and the game support definitely is , You can't justify buying a shity 1060 200-250$ and turn around and by a 400$ VR headset, What type of bullshit is that Linus? Even if the VR headset was 200$, the "i3 1060" demographics will never buy that bullshit when they can put that money into a better GPU, higher refresh rate monitor, bigger SSD...etc..etc that will make their every day gaming/productivity experience much better than a VR headset you get tired of after a while and you will 100% mostly use it for porn and 360 videos/demos. Also if you're the type of person who is willing to spend 400$ on VR headset I'm pretty sure you're already running an i5+1070/1070ti tier system. VR will never ever be a thing with these prices for the average gamer who buys value parts.
Nope sorry Linus... I'm not into ads for Facebook :/ I stick to my Vive thank you very much... I'd rather you bring more of the "nerdgasm" stuff that you actually seem to enjoy :D hearing you talk about server rigs and cool network switches not only broadens my horizon but is also very entertaining!
I actually thought about getting a VR thing myself today. But im not that interested in these special VR games but i just wanna play my normal games with a keyboard/controller using the VR thing like a screen. Is that even possible?!
I wouldn't play on an oculus because of the Facebook acquisition, I would like to ditch WhatsApp too but that's kinda hard if I want to be social.
I need that boar vessel
1050 ti is good enough in real world performance. That's what I'm using and every game I've thrown at it runs surprisingly well, I'll put a small notice saying that my most demanding VR game is Doom VFR but even that works very well with no issues that I can perceive.
Where low spec gamer? He would been great for this video
Should you even game in VR? Just useless gimmick.
What monitor is that in the background behind the window?
so... get a 1060? we knew that already
I'll look into VR when it's viable wireless at a non insane price.
fallout 4 vr is like the crysis of vr
k
Cheap Windows mixed reality + Used GTX 10603gb = Best bang for the buck (atleast where I leave)
Thanks but is 90 FPS really necessary because from my perspective, that's far from budget.
Build a PC like this at your own risk. You won't be able to play AAA games.
VR is so bad we need at least 800ppi to get a good quality these VR headsets are expensive and it's not even worth it the best way to watch VR porns is getting a phone with crazy PPI like xperia xz2 premium
Answer: No, you can't.
Try firewatch  people with VR
Okay, so the video is sponsored by oculus rift, while yesterday news emerged that facebook canceled works on Oculus Rift 2. Is this last try to sell the OR 1 while they still can, or are they trying to reanimate the project that is slowly dying?
So my i7 8086k i got for free and a gtx titan 6gb i got like 3-4 years ago for $240 CAD would work then?
VR in its current guise is a yawnfest.
$900 "budget" the short answer is get a psvr
"If you already have windows, or whatever" by which you mean, "If you already have windows or you're just going to use a pirated version anyway".
Oculus rift is $650 in Europe, yeah not gonna happen buddy!
Depends on your budget, the pimax4k is a great HMD for seated VR.
I just got Tomb Raider and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice that have VR modes. This weekend will be lit!
Im trying to buy a VR gaming computer and this helps a lot. Thanks Linus ????
Humble brag at 5:15 ??
sponsored by Oculus Rift Ewwwwwwwwww, nvm. At least you were honest about it.
Man I really hate rgb lighting
The moment you actually have i3-8100 and 1060 6GB at home, lol. That sounds like VR is possible thing to consider now, yay!
Asynchronous Spacewarp Asynchronous Spacewarp Asynchronous SPACEWARP!!!
Oculus rift = sick motion ??
Linus ONLY using a 980 ti for vr i'm disguised
Who else wanted Linus to fall down in 7:22?
Eat my plump juicy boogers tseries or pewdiepie
Yeah but anybody that's actually tried it knows it's "nintendo power glove" gimmicky and not very good both hardware and software wise. I mean the concept is great but falls lightyears short of what it should deliver in order to have an experience that doesn't feel completely unpolished and in some cases utter unplayable. In the end if you want reality try leaving your computer at home and experience what real life has to offer instead.
6:50 I thought this was still in vr
Where are ryzen and radeon cards, because a 2400g an rx 580 with 8 gb ram would cost in total 370€ and you would get even better performence.
I got my Oculus Rift with touch controllers and 2 sensors for $399. That's the price of a nice PC monitor. I think that price point is reasonable for such a premium experience. I've had a blast with it for over a year now. Go get one folks!
Last time I came this early she left...
But Linus, everyone knows RGB adds 10% performance to any rig!
Body is vessel for holy spirit. Please do not stick probes to Your head. Even bible say do not be lazy in old testament.
400 POUNDS
Do a 690
I have all the surface level hardware requirements met (quad core 3.4 ghz cpu, 8 gb ram, 6gb gtx 1060[final christmas gift]) but I'm running on a amd 3+ cpu/motherboard that is missing an instruction set to play any vr. SO CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY (thank god I did) I was going to upgrade to an amd4+ socket with an 8 core 4.2 ghz cpu, but that with ram plus the vr set (windows mixed reality; ~$180) would cost somewhere in the range of $600. Looks like I won't join the future anytime soon, but hopefully I can get good enough at sculpting it. Oh and thank god you guys are doing some more budget oriented stuff.
Is the screen resolution/ quality any different in vive and rift
Interesting timing with the Rift 2 being cancelled.
But the Oculus is still expensive I can just buy Acer windows mixed reality headset...
cough LowSpecGamer cough
John carmac doom
Thanks guys as someone with a baby round the corner this did actually help
Virtual Boy
FullDive when?
But can it run climb?
so if benchmakr tool, witch is ment to mesur if you pc can do things, says it can do thing, doesnt mean it can do things, why did you benchmark it? becuase you just said it means nothing.
Can any non-shill non-fanboy tell me how the RX 480 8GB honestly performs in 2018 in VR? I'm having a hard time finding any reliable information. I have an overclocked Ryzen 7 1700 as well.
VR is a trash toy and always will be.
like Johnny Mnemonic)
Linus, the guy who has a titan V and a bunch of quadro cards and doesnt know what to do with it games on VR with a gtx 980ti. WTF? xD
Tis is everything except low end... You should have tested it with older cards like GTX960 and 760 etc... Would be way more interresting then this bullshit
Tfw you run an i3-7100 dual core and a gtx 1050 So close
Arctika 1, vrchat, vtolvr, h3vr, and gorn will not appreciate that cpu.
Yes just go R3 1200 with GTX 1050 ti / RX 570 and 8gb
why no Rizen 3 and Rx 580?
What happened to 4k content?
No shit Linus :D GTX 1060 and RX 480 were promoted as cheap VR.
AMD VR build please?
I'm not into VR anyway so yeah screw it
3 PS eye cameras, 3 move controller's one for head tracking, A phone and a good cardboard vr headset. 50$ max
You can do just about anything with a $10,000 budget...
I use my iPhone 7 and steam and a cheap google cardboard and steam vr and my phone work together with google cardboard I’ve played sibnautica in vr
It's good you're promoting VR, bad that you are promoting Oculus, their business practices are slimy as hell and only serve to hurt the industry. Steam and the Vive are working to make the industry open and inclusive to benefit everyone (including Rift users).
If a VR headset is over 50 it's overpriced.
My issue with VR isn't my PC, I upgraded to a top liner a few months ago. My issue is with the tech. I want to buy the Oculus bundle but it's £400. I don't wanna buy an Oculus and in a few months find out that a new and much better one is available. That's my issue with new(ish) and constantly developing technology. I bought the nVidia 3D vision thing when that came out then they released a better version a few months later. Even when I was a kid I got a Gameboy Advance SP for Christmas one year and like a week later the Nintendo DS was announced. I feel like with my luck I'll buy an Oculus Rift and the next day Oculus will announce the Rift 2 or something.
i have an i5 6600k and a 1060 6gb works like a dream for me. i might not play with the oculus for a month or 2 but every time I play it i think wow. and if your going to play super-hot vr be ready to sweat.
If you get motion sick easy, anything less than a 1080 leads to motion sickness though
Windows mixed reality is the only way to go.
Linus I was a fan Now I’m a huge fan.
FLAT MODE
Lol, i have a i3 8100 system with 128+2000gb rom and 8gb ram for €500 ( =550$)
This is the first time i see linus without a liter of oil in his hair.
End of this year around xmas quite a few vr sets will enter the market at price of 199 dollars.
"Where is yout team spirit" - wears a vessel shirt
You can get windows 10 pro from ebay for like 5$. Why do you have it listed like 125$?
ya know walmart has the lenovo mixed reality headset for $170 brand new right?
I don't like that this is sponsored by oculus. There are some great cheap VR headsets like Microsoft mixed reality things. They help with the budget.
My low spec vr is a used hp windows mixed reality and a 1050 with a amd fx 8300
BTW you can get windows in Amazon for 5-10$
is this targeted advertising
i love you doing vr stuff
Whats a good budget vr headset?
It's not the spec of the PC that keeps me away from VR. I got that covered, it's the cost of the VR kit that makes it expensive. Also, it's not like there are any must-have VR games out there to play. Why spend $400 buck on what is little more than a toy. Something that will without compelling games surely spend most of its life gathering dust.
What about vr on amd cards?? those cards are kind of made more for vr then everything else ??
Oh, this is awkward. Facebook recently canned the Rift 2 ...
* mild shock * RGB NONESENSE????
My rigs an I7 16gb ddr4 with a 1050 ti mini and it does vr just fine. :D
I was curious about using a GTX 1060 Max-Q to see if that would be “minimum”
Pentium G3258 @ 4.4ghz and a 1050Ti? No? damn :(
Linus please make a pc build video to play any AAA titles in 1080p res in 60fps... In this era of 4k gaming playing at 1080p res is the only option for budget gamers to have a descent gaming experience... Thank you in advance...
friends help me through... in core i5 what graphics card will give smooth results . and also with low budget. lolxx
Will you redo this video without it being a commercial? You know, try a Windows Mixed Reality headset or two maybe?
No you cant , If you wanna Play the best porn Simulation in vr ( virt a Mate created by meshed VR ) you gonna need a 3080 ti !
Oculus Rift + Touch Bundle = EUR 449.00 (511.30 USD) + EUR700 for 1080ti + a 4K monitor.. NO!
i got the core 13 8100k with a 1060 so i should be better than the first test XD
Ever heard of PSVR? Lol
The VR headsets are still too expensive...
Nvidia: gtx 1060 VR Ready Linus: wooow, do you see that? 1060 is vr ready!
how bout no
Considering getting a vive. Can someone tell me honestly if shelling out $400 is worth it?
Wow! Now you only have to give your pinky finger for a headset! Who needs them anyways...
Hey bro can you hook me up with a SICK gaming pc because I’m gaming on a hp pavilion 23 ??
I play vr on an i5 680 and an gtx 970. I know it is an crazy combination, but it were just old parts laying around. It costs almost 200€ for this Build. And every Game runs smoothly. Just a few cant hande Bots cause of the CPU limitations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huT6fp7nzwA REAL budget VR on AMD APU
When is Amazon going to create a vr program to shop in? So we can see perspective what they look like.
My friend has a vr pc and he has a ryzen 5 1200 and a rx580 8gb for a system price of $672
>VR on a budget >900$ PC
SRSLY. Going over Oculus again when Lenovo and Samsung headsets are BETTER for the price, AND not mentioning that steam HAS ASW re-projection now so ALL steamVR headsets can "run on modest machines" now. God the quality of these videos is going down hill.
$400 is still $200 too much
Linus adds in Windows 10 liscense price, yet they don't have it themselves
Budget VR means a Window Mixed Realityheadset, not the stupid and outdated Rift or the underpowered Quest.
It's dead jim
You guys should look at PSVR since its the cheapest entry VR (not counting the phone VR headsets). You can get it all for under $400. Personally I used it and it was enjoyable.
Are you using the Oculus quest?
Hmmm, define budget
Please review beast grip dof adapter
Not even playing BeatSaber... noobs
"budget" doesn't include a $450 headset (yes, it's "$399", but you need to buy a third sensor for another $50) when there are actual budget headsets in the $180-$220 range like the Lenovo and Asus MR headsets that are perfectly functional.
Ha cool my post went into video! posted about VR on my Xeon cpu
Current balance: $30.91, should be enough right?
wow the lowest end gpu with "vr ready" on the box is the lowest end gpu you should use for vr
so let me get this straight... he has a warehouse that has a SHELF FULL OF 1080/ 1080TI'S and he vr games on a 980TI?!?!! was that an error or is this just a really old video that was never properly uploaded?
Linus Tech Tips: GX 980 TI VR Me: MacBook Air with 8gb ram, and i5 processor and only Intel HD GRAPHICS 6000 and a 256gb ssd Me: Lags to 5fps
BUTT
Using my old i7 2600k and a 1070Ti just for VR stuff. Works a treat.
All I have is 4.65$CAD and half a hot dog I'll hope It can do
Was this a GTX 1060 3gb or 6gb
This is the real BUDGET-VR , I made a VR System Based on the Raspberry PI, that let's you play (non VR) FPS games with a tracked headset! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8R5RfQb1k&t=27s
Would you not be better with a PS4 and Playstation VR if you are looking to do VR on a budget
Miss the old contents, new contents becoming kind of crap
2 BUY VR U HAVE 2 HAVE MONEY FFS.........
-Makes a budget video -Holds RTX graphics card -hmmmm
i3-8100 with GTX 1060 3GB represant here! :D Still, I wouldn't buy $500 oculus that is worth 50% of my current PC, I would probably upgrade some component first.
I was expecting a more low spec system, not something we already knew bcould run vr decently
you can still do vr on a 3rd gen i5
I have an- i3 8100 msi gtx 1050 2gb oc z370p d3 gigabyte mobo Would it be worth it to step up into the 1060 6gb for vr and flat gaming. Or should i do the cpu first ?
I play vr with a 1050ti and it works fine, just not on max settings.
Pff 1060. I run my Oculus on a 760ti and an fx6300 T.T and it works just fine lol
But can it run lone echo
Without watching the video I can already answer: Yes of course, as long as gaming on VR is a possibility for an amount of money. Any amount of money can be a budget. If I "only" wanna spend $5000 on a PC then that's my budget, for which I can definetly build a PC + VR headset + games. Now if I only had a small loan of a million dollars....
Plz review oculus quest when it releases
Just go watch the low spec gamer play vr on vega 8
Why isn't this video in 4K???
So many sponsored videos. You defiantly have a rift. Why sponsored? Money surely isn't that tight?!??! Can I even trust you anymore?!?
I'm gonna build a system for VR next year :D
yea this is budget pc
Nope, because 1 dolar is 5,7 Turkish Lira. Sad ??
What if, all I want is the 3D gaming and I don't care much about hand controllers and head tracking. Basically VR headset as monitor and keyboard and mouse for controls?
Is it locked behind window 10? There still isn’t a killer VR game yet that is meant for VR and still fun game. Only game I’ve wanted to try in VR was subnautica which struggle to run on my i7 3770k 3.5 GHz, 16 GB, with GTX 1080TI, ssd At times fps drops below 25 fps the deeper you go. Love the game. But still runs like shit.
glass jar full on moneys..don't drop it.
Couldn't you have gone deeper? OCULUS has many tools and programs to further lower the graphics and increase the performance.
i3 4130 and 1070. Call me dumb but my pc dirt cheap and runs it all
400th comment
You can get Windows 10 Pro for $9.99 from a Bonanza seller. I just finished a $3500 build (monitor/accessories included) and still didn't see the need in spending $100+ on Windows
Aaand still no good VR games. Skyrim VR is best for me just becouse it have good graphics and good framerate on my gtx1070. Cant say same about fallout4 VR.
You didn't quite went into the low spec gamer territory
Pimax vr pre order went live today. Oculus price dropped. Coincidence? Probably.
Hey Linus you should make a video about custom bios
360p club hands up ??
yeah get gearvr on ur phone its the same shit
Linus in the end of 2018 rift or vive? My pc is already far ahead of spec
yes its called ps4
No
How far would I come with, and how long will it be "good" the next years:? Cpu: Ryzen 7 2700x GPU: Asus 1080 Ti RAM: G.Skill 16GB RAM (probably 32 some time)
Wow, you discovered that 1050 Ti and a 1060 6gb are usable for VR, even though a weaker 960 has been specified as a minimum for VR for years now. Great job....
Is this real https://www.tech-bazaar.com/product/lenovo-ideacentre-gaming-pc-700-24ish-intel-core-i5-6400-2-7ghz-8gb-ram-2tb-hdd-gt-930-all-in-one-pc/
i was litterally waiting for this video i was planing to buy a laptop and was wondering if it could run vr nice job thumbs up
But wasnt the 1060 always VR Capable ?
When you said the specs you can run it on might surprise you, I expected you to go for something weaker than what has been deemed the minimum specs for VR since oculus/vive came out (which was a quad core and a GTX 970, which is equivilant to a GTX 1060)

Linus, I'm running VR on an i5 3570K with a 1050Ti, works just fine. So you Can go even cheaper if you have to. I liked the video thx.
Who pays 140 bugs for a windows key?
I mean if my i3-3250 (!) can handle a HD 7950 (!) - in flat, mind you, obviously ?? - why was it suprising to you guys that an i3-8100 and a 1060 works good enough in VR? ?? And why aren’t people giving potentials for cheaper CPUs so that they can save money for RAM or Graphics Cards, but this is just in my opinion. ?????
When will VR porn come?
Google Cardboard and Pornhub total $15 its all good
get a windows mixed reality Dell Visor and a gtx 960, and an i5 bam
Lenovo WMR is only 100 on BHphoto and order some controllers on amazon for about 30 dollars ez
Hm turns out I could run VR with rx580. Would never have thought.
Hold up, on your spec sheet you listed the stock cooler Linus, but the pc clearly has a corsair water cooler on it.
Me: Magic conch, can this person on a budget game in vr ? Magic conch: no.
not first
I have i3 8100 and a 1060 3gb, and i3 8100 performs faster than i5 7th gen
omg i literally have an i3 and an nvidia GTX1060 8gb of ram in my pc
Doesn’t matter if they cut the price,i still can’t afford it??. I also can’t afford a system upgrade,getting a new mb,cpu and ram(i’m still on ddr3). Anyone looking for a kidney by any chance?
I have over 500 hrs in VR and its amazing! I do Beat Saber #1 Ranked in Puerto Rico Full Body VR Chat And my headsets are the Lenovo Explorer WMR And the Samsung Odyssey WMR And ask me any doubts you may have about VR and Windows Mixed Reality they are better than linus makes them look.
I’m running an oculus with 3 sensors and touch with a ryzen 3 1200, 4gb ddr4, and a gtx 1050 ti.
Do you know a non indie VR game?
(2010) parents said don’t look at the screen too close or your lose your eye sight. (2016) parents buy be for their kids....
Sponsored by occulous. Yeahhhh I'd rather fucking NOT
What if your PC gets 30 frames while paying minecraft (at max)
what is the case we see in the video. look great. I want it
I have a rift for £350 and a PC for £400 (bought used, several years ago) all depends if you call £750 budget or not...
If you're really looking for cheap, last gen Ryzen 7 is fantastic for VR. I have one paired with a GTX 1070, Great experience
I game on a 8100 and a 1060 6gb and works great! Never thought that it could do VR so well
VR isn't worth it.
i mean, the only vr headset i have confidence in is the new oculus quest headset, and its the one im willing to put money into
Using a $900 system with a quad core i3 and a 1060 for VR.... I'm "SHOCKED" that it works........... If you'd showed me VR on a <$400 PC using older hardware I might have been a little impressed.
Of course you can. Didn't specify the size of the budget though.
vessel
Of course you can game in VR on a budget. It all depends on what that budget is tho! But its possible! For a smart tech guy, you sure ask stupid questions lol!!! :P
"budget"
I play fallout 4 vr on a 1050 ti and it is a great experience
1050ti isnt what I would describe as budget or barebones. Sure its not high-tier, but I also wouldnt call it average. The thing you need to remember is thats its not just the average price of the graphics card, its the fact that most people arent building their computer today. The average person may well have built their PC years ago and really shelled out on it then, which means by now its out of date despite costing around the same price as a higher tier system today. I think the genuine solution to VR on a budget will be quest
I have a Ryzen 1800X and an RX 480OC 8gb. How well do you think I'll run?
Can my dual core pentium run it?
im watching this on my oculus rift on the oculus home. im using a 1050ti and Im having an amazing time IN Skyrim VR.
i'm early. nice.
You have an interesting definition of "On a Budget".
Vr is cancer makes my stomach sick...
Ryzen 5 2600? come on, always Intel and Nvidia in this channel....meh
New into please!!d
100% what I searched for. Uploaded exactly when I needed it. Wow, that's not a coincidence anymore :D (happened quite often last month)
Didn't try a more butget 3G 160 ti :(
Robo Recall is unfortunately not free if you want to save $80 and buy used. I made that mistake. Spent most of the money I saved on the games that would have been included. Derp.
What about something like a 780? Approx like a 1060
There are much better options for True budget VR :)
I don't get it, Hardware Unboxed released an "Ultimate Bang for Your Buck 1440p Gaming System Build" that is 970$ with Ryzen 5 2600 and 1070ti, and this one with i3 8100 and 1060 is 910$? Something is not right...
Games for VR is still a little expensive, take that in mind too
4:53 Shopping list, just FYI
cough cough grey market keys for 13 euro , bought 2 so far both worked
I use a WMR headset at 60 hz due to nvidia optimus. Its pretty alright.
YUP
google got you covered with their high tech cardboard thingy
Would be fun to see step down tests. Play on worse and worse rigs until motion sickness is unbearable
My pc really low spec, i got a gt 710 1gb card, 4gb ram and a core i5 2,8 ghz
Virtual reality + 1030. Check Low Spec Gaming to learn how ;)
I saw this on LowSpecGamer, so the answer is yes.
Linus is a good boy. He wears his wrist straps.
my laptop can't even play 1080p vidson youtube. I always watch in 720p Smash like if ur too poor like me
why i was thinking that i was going to watch rift/vive headset alternatives (not the crappy mobile headsets with no games available) and not that what i have in my system is ok for vr?
no u
Oclus go would be way cheaper?
Oculus has joined the chat
Go onto low spec gamer
I have a 1060 paired with a Pentium G5600 on a MSI Z370 Gaming Pro Carbon??. I have the VR ready stamp on all benchmarks and I can run games very well in VR
Lenovo Explorer here, if i had to make a list from best to worse the Oculus is like 5th after the Dell WMR
Just what i needed to decide if i should buy a headset
So the 1050 ti would be able to run vr? Thats pretty neat
vive is so far beyond superior
We've shown that you can do oculus gaming on an older cheaper card, the 780, which is very similar to a 1060 but they can be found near $110 these days.
pretty deceptive on the i5-1060 combo, the "total price" doesn't include an oculus
God, why does has really decreased in quality, 1060 is VR ready, everyone knows that, we're here to see is it can run on something like a 1050ti, but no.
I am interested in VR for a racing sim rig.
Why no amd. No love for the red team. Smh capitalists
has multiple 1080ti in office... uses a 980ti at home
It's great to see the improvements in VR technology... ...and I'm still not going to buy it.
Please stop using "budget" as meaning "with spending as good as little as possible"
Doesn't all VR still have screen door effect?
(¡__¡) At last can experience VR Great oculus go ahead and make vr more and more affordable
Good!
I can do this using my phone and the Intel he graphics for stream some games as a vr (with medium graphics)
"Hey Ivan, i'm opening your start menu what're you gonna do about it?" "I can touch you... inappropriately."
I love my $200 Lenovo Explorer.
I've got a 1060 and i5 7th gen(i think?) Will this be able to run skyrim VR? (16GB ram if it matters)
linux your depth of stuff is relatively a Non-budget... Did you knew you could achieve the same performance using amd phenom x6 ( cpu +mobo total100$) and gtx1070 ..
M8 I have a gtx 1050ti and a ryzen 5 1500x and I play vr just fine.
the ad...? Oh I forgot the whole video is an ad
It would be dope if playstation and xbox had a blue tooth system that hooks up to you phone so when u play split screen u get a screen and audio to yourself
Regardless of whether you could buy a cheap VR setup there's still only a handful of games worth playing and the rest are nothing more than glorified tech demos. By the time decent gaming experiences made specifically for VR come out, you'd have to shell out again for new hardware if not for the headset, definitely for new PC parts. And that's without adding in floor space or the likelihood that games will cause VR sickness. VR is not worth the money until it reaches Holodeck levels.
?
I built a pc purely on parts I found at yards sales for under 150$ US AMD FX 6200, 16GB RAM, 1GB MSI OC GRAPHICS CARD, ASUS MOTHERBOARD, COOLER MASTER PC CASE, 13 FANS IN PC, OH an I almost forgot a OCULUS RIFT DK1 VR HEADSET SO YES YOU CAN GAME IN VR ON A BUDGET LINUS.??
This feels.. not that useful to me. Is there really anyone out there building a PC specifically for these sort of small and gimmicky VR games? In my experience, they're fun for a few minutes, but none of them are something I'd invest real time and money into. To me, the appeal of VR is for much more demanding, simulator style games like elite dangerous and project cars. If I was going to spend $1k+ on a PC and headset, those are the types of games I'd want to target.
" If you already have windows or whatever"- just say the word, Linus.
Wooo, Oculus Quest! :D
Was that a verge pc cameo?
I moved my VR setup off my main pc (7700k and 1080ti) to a spare pc I have in a larger room, and it is running okay (not great). I have an i5 2500k overclocked paired up with a gtx 1070. I do notice some of the larger titles do not run anywhere as smooth as they did on my main rig set up, but it is passable. I am definitely thinking it is time to upgrade the ol' workhorse in that spare that is the 2500k, but man, its just been through so much over the years I do not want to let it go.
Pretty funny video considering the co-founder of Oculus Rift left and they cancelled the Rift 2 so they can make low quality/price toy VR systems. https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/279364-oculus-rift-2-canceled-co-founder-leaves-facebook
Wow. Those prices. So low! 72 USD for a 1TB SSD? Wow....
Not sure, but I think it's called google cardboard
This is a much better sponsored video. Doesn't feel like a commercial, like some other LTT sponsored videos.
Where's the "showcase" in the title?
What matters more, cpu or gru when it comes to vr?
Looks like a paid commercial for Rift
0:27 But If someone (I don't know who) buys a msi dragon I think it's no problem??
Eyyy
Oculus Rift the best
Can you use a titan x to play vr on
1060 3g or 6g
Or... you can get a Intel NIC and slap an external GPU on it! (like i did with the NUC Skull Canyon and the Aorus Gaming Box 1070)
video plays better if you put the speed at 1.25
I just bought a new laptop with a 1060 max Q and a 7700HQ. Then this would be enough to use vr? ( I do have 32GB ram and so)
if you you want buget vr get a windows mixed reality
At least look into Windows Mixed Reality to VR on a budget.
I got a gtx 1050 ti i5 8400 combo and no money or space for a headset
Ahem Oculus quest ahemm
who's exited for the oculus quest
If i had the space i would have probably taken the plunge on VR. The computational requirement is currently not an issue but the amount of space all but counts me out on that.
I would get a AMD rx580 instead of a GTX 1060. Because it's cheaper (at least here in Germany it's 209€ for a 8GB version. Don't buy a 4GB version, it's not worth that 20 bucks saving by far) and has a bit more power. And of course you get more VRAM
Uploaded 16min ago and 8.9k views. Wtf bro
Notification Train CHOO CHOO!
do you really want to wear a GIMP mask!????
all the more reasons to buy used 10xx mining cards
Last night I dreamed you bro ????????
I'm thinking HTC will have to respond to this price drop which is good. I might have to finally buy one.
I smell an opportunity with scrapyard wars and VR.
Linus: "Where is your team spirit?" Ivan: "At home.."
I use VR on an AsRock 990FX w/an 8150 CPU & 2 R9 290's.
Yet another great video from tech dad!!
Foreshadowing for VR scrapyard wars?
I'm reminded of Thing from Addams Family...and yeah old dudes like me don't VR at any price because of motion sickness.
Oh man not premier
My answer: Yeah, just buy a PS4 and PS VR. It might not be the best but it's not that expensive and it's easy.
Really it's AWESOME!!!!????
I think this was a old video, never posted. Oculus has the oculus Quest coming out for $400 and it doesn't need a pc
5:33 BABY ITS TRIPLE
Sure! But can you budget in VR? Hmmmmm?
You guys gotta do these budget builds with used parts. I built my system with slightly better specs than your PC. For $600. That means that for $1000, you can get the headset AND system for $100 more than your pc ONLY.
I have bought a rift and love it
WOOHOO 205th!
Video is 9:33 not 10:00 Respect+
Eyy another VR video
Someone please check out my youtube video please leave a comment and subscribe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jpfoffhBPE
Linus could've dropped the price even further
VR for a budget? LowSpecGamer? Where are you?
But the gtx 1060 is vr ready so it isnt so impressive
Thanks for covering VR Linus tech Media!! Even if sponsored ?? VR needs mainstream!
I feel like the eye tracking is going to scan ur eye retina and scan your room to see into your personal space
collab about this with LowSpecGamer hes the master at this
Ahh the climb, I've literally woke up sore because of that game.
Could be just me, but the price isn't even the biggest/only problem I have with "VR being the next big thing". Imo VR is just a toy like the whole Camera or Movement controlls a couple of years ago. Quite frankly I don't wanna constantly sit or stand around with a fucking VR headset on my head while gaming, as a fun thing to play around with, sure. "Future of gaming" hell no.
I have my oculus rift panels overclocked to 110Hz. It is so much better that way
can it run gorn???
Also: Windows Mixed Reality machines can be found for around $200! Dont watch linus's review, he got a crap sample but in general they perform up to the standard of a Vive, and better than an oculus.
something something flat is justice
So i can't run VR with my GTX 660?
Ugh, I was hoping for an interesting video like lowspecgamer's vid with a cheap mr headsets and ryzen apu. Shame it had to be ruined by sponsorship. :c
NO NO NO NO THE OLD INTRO REEE
I'd rather buy myself a real genuent equipment instead of wasting money on something that I know I'll regret... This is not content I subsribed for, you can do better guys.
Linus, can you do a wireless VR video next?
Yeap, of course. $200 VR kit on AliExpress. ;) Do you know Oculus Rift and HTC Vive used Samsung displays? ;) Or try Smartphone + Trinus or other apps like this.
Linus the best
I've been wondering about this!!! Thanks again for another informative video :-)
I play VR on a 1060 6gb and an 8th gen i3 and I have never had any problems running games.
He is sooooooooooo hot and sexy
Got a vive. Dont know what games go get
wow the dislike in here is much better than the I phone review
I appreciate if you help me reach 20 subscribers
Yeah, go play Pokemon Go. It's literally free lol. AR is VR for poor people.
Quadcore + GTX 1060.... Oh geee.... I did not see that coming....
VIVE > oculus
A 1060 is not what I'd consider budget
Wait before the video starts can it run On a gtx660ti
Ty linus
1th
Next up on LTT:- Can you call 911 with two cups and a string?! Stay tuned.
I'm wathcing this video so early that I have to watch it in peasant 1080p
The answer is no Linus, no you can't.
and Oculus also drop its Founder because of facebook sorry I AM NOT SOLD
I have 3 exams today.
Nice and early
No
Hey...
get a windows mixed reality lenovo for low spec computer. A basic spec would be a gtx960 on FX8350. Edit GTX 760 SC can run it but limited lower framerate
GANG
please review asus tuf
5:01 or whatever.. :DD
I did my bachelor's about this topic. In half of the games RX 550 is even enough. :P
Lenovo' "mixed reality" headset is 100 bucks for just the headset
VR / 3D its something in the pass i stay with 2d thank you no headdick no empty wallet and no need for new hardware in my pc.
NO
No, still no
do you have to have 2 separate gpu to run 4k and 1080p
No
What version of the 1060 did you use. The 3gb 6gb or the ddr5x version
u have f*ck load of new gpus and u use a 980ti. nice xd
Sup
Yeah you can. It's called Google Cardboard.
linus fake tech tips
VR is still alive?
I bought a 5dollar vr 1year ago and its still is resting at the same place bcoz after 2-3days you will realise it not the real vr this thing is peace of shit btw still i can say that 5dollar vr is good for watching movies and for 360° vr porn.
Notification squad babe!
it's sad I can't use a VR headset. My eyes are so bad they aren't close enough to the screen to see them and not be blurred. VR seems really cool
I thought a mixed reality vr company would sponsor this video
Still mad cause ur last vid
Just here for the hardware porn. And Linus and his crew.
Why would you WANT to game in VR? /end thread.
My VR machine is a I7 2600, 8GB of ram, RX480 or GTX1060 (1060 for mixed reality).
VR....VENOM
Short answer. If you want a decent experience.... Hell No. It's still like $1200 to start at the bare minimum specs.
I have my phone and cardboard headset for VRPorn,com. I’m good
I like budgeting on a VR
Pimax just announced their controller and base station bundle - $300 for two SteamVR 2.0 base stations and two tracked controllers. I think that plus some WMR HMD will be the go-to VR bundle in the future (once Pimax is actually shipping on demand).
100$ cut is way to less! Make it 200$ and we can start talking about THINKING to get VR!
Just buy a cardboard box and lenses. There you go! Very cheap VR for your phone!
How are there more likes and dislikes than there are views.
Hey Linus! You've got Techquickie Competition! Is austin gonna beat you??!!! Well *This Is* exactly what we're wondering :p

Please Linus can you help me with a editing pc i love editing very much pleasee
Got my attention really quick lol
Dear Linus, I bet you’re thinking, why is this random kid writing a letter in the comment section of my video? To answer that question, if you did ask yourself that, I wanted to ask you what would you suggest for a good gaming desktop and monitor, I haven’t ever bought or owned a gaming pc so I’m not sure what exactly to get for my first desktop. Yet I do need to stay inside of a price zone, somewhere between $700 to $1300, yet I do make YouTube videos and I do stream sometimes, so I will need a good pc to run this as well as at least 10 games. I don’t know if it would be better to build a computer or just to buy a pre-built model. Love the videos keep up the good work. Sincerely, Uni YouTube
too many sponsored vids now days....
Not first
Still unhappy about Linus bending over for the apple fanboys in the forum.

After 20 minutes od watching, I still don't know anything about picture quality. - The most important feature!
Why are there no images screenshares of what the experience is like? WTF? Other channels do this.
i find the oculus go extremely uncomfortable. it digs into my checkbones. also, 'space' travel is not real. the surface of the earth is a flat plane covered by an impenetrable dome. the sun, moon, and stars are very small and actually inside the dome. below its surface the earth extends to untold depths. outside of the dome is not 'space' but water
Thank you for bringing the news regarding standalone vr sets. can you also do a review of the Vive Focus?
So at the moment the Go is the better deal!
Here's an honest review: Very few apps support 6DOF. Although it's nominal effort by the developers, it's still effort which means they have to pay for it. They have to spend money on development time to create a new build to support 6DOF. Then you have the Daydream platform which has perhaps only 1/4 of the number of applications available in it's store. The quality of the apps (graphics, complexity) feels a generations behind GearVR and if you look at Oculus Go exclusive titles like Thumper, it feels a few generations behind. With the Lenovo Mirage the customer is paying an extra $200 (over the Go) for poorer quality experiences with the novelty of 6DOF for a few dozen apps that happen to support it. As a product the Lenovo VR has been a failure, while Go sales have slowed down, it has a strong launch and has been a success. I'm not trying to beat up Daydream or the Lenovo Mirage, but customers deserve honesty before they drop $400 on a product that has so far failed in the market. Developers have been given no incentive to update their apps or create new apps specific with 6DOF in mind (why the hell would they, with only one horribly selling product on the market to support it). Perhaps Google's WorldSense technology does have a future and we will see a revised Daydream viewer to support it (that would be nice), but an Oculus Go
End of the day, what it comes down to is, which one is better for porn? lol
Two questions: settings or app allowing audio EQ? And is local streaming via URL possible?
Copying Oculus Go
It might just be my OCD, but shouldn't the little houses on the Space Invaders t-shirt have at least some damage?
Please tell me if I am missing something. this vr headset is 400$ I'm on oculous rift page and they are selling rift for same price. why would anyone choose the Mirage solo over a rift? Now don't get me wrong. I'm still learning about vr after trying it at best buy for the first time. I'm actually curious; I only tried the oculous rift and go. But from what I understand unlike the oculous go that is 200 witch actually has an acceptable reason for such downfalls; being that its made for a budget. while this standalone comes with most of the downsides and also one or two benefits but seems to pale in comparison to the rift. why would I put out similar price to an oculous rift when I can get the go and have a similar experience that is actually cheaper?
Great video. I made my decision. It is oculus Go
I wish you guys would update your review. There is so much you guys have missed and some of your info is incorrect. :)
Oculus Go seems like best deal for watching movies
What's the IPD on this thing? My google fu failed me.
I can't believe you're Oculus shills. I used to trust this channel for VR reviews. But now? Ehhh fuck it. 6dof? This is by far the beast non-tethered headset by leaps and bounds. No shit software support will catch up. You gushed and sucked the Oculus Go's dick for minutes, and the tone of this review is nothing but negative Nancy despite being a clearly superior headset. If you don't back 6dof, then get fucked. $200 price tag be damned.
Best mobile headset that exists right now.
Would be nice to see review of Htc Vive Focus from tested.
What is the best android VR for gaming???
I have an Oculus Go and a PSVR but I'm debating. The Google apps store is the deal breaker. Go is great for media and PSVR is great for games. The Lenovo option is enticing...
We need voice commands in VR: computer, thea, earl gray, hot
Great reviews guys !
Hmm.... getting there... still not there yet. Maybe a Mirage 2 it'd fix these things and the software would be there?
This thing ought to also be a 3D camera right out of the box. They have a lot of nerve saying you have to buy a separate $300 camera.
14:55 your wrong you do get points for accuracy .
Vr are expensive toys meanwhile iphones are >$1000
9:38 no not whatever , thata a big deal these headsets are made for this reason to lay down and relax in vr
Still miss the time Norm never left the initial room in Dreadhalls lol.
That lenovo head weight distribution piece looks very similar to ps vr
why does VR suck so badly now?, with oculus having their own store and google with their own "store". Everybody wants to be like America Online back in the days. Also, android, google and microsoft "stores"; why does everything suck so badly? We're surrounded by retards.
so stupid to have something in the back of the head; you can't lie down. Can't trust Lenovo to do anything right. They've failed at absolutely everything they've done since they acquired or became Think from IBM.
$400? How about 600 Euro here in the Netherlands? (05 15 2018) Same for the Oculus Go 32 GB, not $200 (say 180 Euros) but 250 Euros We are clearly being ripped off in the EU, I guess that ppl in the US just won't pay that much for this stuff (US economy is on its ass) Imo, that still is no reason to charge us 25 to 33 percent more in the EU
I know next to nothing about VR. I do know that I'm not a huge fan of the control methods from what I've seen. Can Skyrim VR be played at the desk using a mouse and keyboard? The headset just for looking around and WASD for moving, the mouse for aiming etc.
I'm never putting a Zuckerberg on my face – ever.
You actually do get points based on where you hit a box in Beat Saber. You can get up to 10 additional points for striking a box through the center. Additionally, you are scored by how forcefully you strike the box. A perfect strike is 110 points. 10 for a center hit and 1 to 100 for force os hit.
Hey guys, great video! I had a quick question. I shoot 360 photos and videos with a gear 360 camera. Can you view these photos on the Mirage Solo? Thank you! vgv
After literally ZERO mention of the word "Daydream" at "Google I/O 2018", isn't "DaydreamVR" dead ...? lol
hmm 75hz all the time
Theres no point in limiting yourself to a 3dof "final consumer version" of a of a fast changing technology like VR now that there are 6dof headsets available. Developers will be on Daydream now that the technology is ahead. Its not just about who has the biggest audience if it were that then they would be making mobile games instead of VR. What this amounts to is you're gonna see cool stuff start to come out for Daydream and for Oculus Go you're gonna see, well...stuff.
I've been watching this video on and off all day, I'm only 7 minutes through... Mobile VR is boring.
Best VR headset but very few apps. They should build a huge appstore.
Pico Neo CV
Here's my hot take comparing the Lenovo Mirage Solo to the Oculus Go. I stuck the Lenovo Mirage Solo on my face for a few hours yesterday. What a hunk of JUNK! My reasons the Oculus Go is the best Standalone VR solution: Oculus has a browser. Lenovo doesn't. No web, no go! (Update! Google has confirmed Chrome is coming to the device. Early launch to take the wind out of Oculus Go's release anyone?) Oculus works in the dark. Lenovo has cameras for tracking. Turning off the lights sends the screen sailing to a random location. Oculus has built in audio and a headphone jack. Lenovo is headphones only. Oculus has social software options for meeting up with friends, playing games and watching media. Lenovo has the YouTube app. (An Exclusive!) There wasn't a Hangouts app in the play store. Basics are missing! And finally, price. I got the $249 64GB Oculus Go. I paid a sale price of $350 for the Lenovo. The normal price is $399 It all adds up to a Lenovo (Google Daydream) Failboat! I'll be sending mine back to Amazon.
I'll wait for the software to develop to 6dof!! I mean. . .isn't that really what VR is supposed to be? Otherwise - it's just 1/2VR! I would definitely drop $400 is the apps were true 6dof.
Released straight into obsolescence because the Daydream platform is the kiss of death.
Great unbiased review
I freaking love beat saber lmao, tried it on my vive yesterday!
Great! I can play ETS the way I want to!
This type of VR is the future. Once they have 6dof controllers, cheaper price and room scale games like Pavlov ported over - people will really start buying this. I love my vive but being tethered can be a pain. Imagine being able to chuck this in your back pack and going to the park with your friends and playing roomscale Pavlov in a huge field! Yes you would look a bit weird but dam it’d be fun.
The nicest feature is 6 DOF and you play standing in one place... Bravo!!! :P
I can't wait until Oculus Santa Cruz is out. That device looks promising.
No speakers on the lenovo mirage solo kind of really sucks, you have to wear headphones to hear anything, that really kind of defeats the purpose of a portable vr headsets, almost made a mistake in buying it, got the oculus go instead
I think they should allow gear vr controls and gaming plug and play just by choosing which controller type stating which controller is needed for game type would boost sales for companies and make it all cost effective for people buying and making gear vr and Google happy which makes people happy.
11:20 Longer battery life. That's good.
VR Boxer lets you import any music, it does beat import Calulating. And you can choose nany different thing,bebvitonments themes etc. I did boxing to Olivia Newton John's 'MAGIC' HEHE.. ABBA next then AQUA! Hehehe
VR sickness is 100% due to low intelligence...Mind over virtual matter! I can go all day doing 360 rotating spinning rollercoaster in VR and be just fine. Really stupid people can't tolerate it at all...
I'm enjoying my Oculus go! It's a very good travel headset it's fun easy to use! I am still thinking on the ( Mirage) you I'm a come back to it in a couple of months and see what's going on with it! spending my money in the future I'm very interested in oculus santa cruz! Will be released by the end of the year or middle of next year?
You had mentioned web browsing was a pretty disappointing experience with the Go. Is it the same situation with the Mirage?
You can walk as far as you like and you can turn off the safety protocols via a checked box in the settings 8.50 into this video shows a guy doing just that https://youtu.be/VhjZxLPmM9s at 9.49 he shows the settings.
Bottom line only way vr Will truly be 100% complete is when they create motion track bands for your arms legs and torso or basically a entire vr suit you have to wear
This seems like an awkward in between in terms of price and content. Funny enough, you can buy one of the Windows Mixer Reality headsets for pretty much the same price, and experience probably just as much VR content on an "average" gaming computer. Granted, it requires a capable computer, but you get so much more from it. We'll see what Gen2 of these standalone headsets bring. But still a good first step.
How much Mobile Radiation goes to your HEAD?
beat saber actually does give you more points for cutting the cubes symmetrically so accuracy is scored
You can turn off the graphical fadeout. It's called "Enable safety graphics" under Developer Options. Turn it off, and you can fully walk around in that Blade Runner game (as demonstrated on the Lon.tv youtube channel).
So it can do proper 6 dimensions tracking but it's still basically a phone VR? At that price, what the hell is being accomplished besides a bad impulse buy? Even if you don't have a PC that can run a Vive or a Rift, you could always go for one of those Mixed Reality Headsets. They're cheaper as is, and you don't need an expensive PC to run them either, most modern PCs could run it just fine (so long as you have something that isn't just meant to browse the internet and create word files).
I wish they oculus or Lenovo can play job simulator and other pc comparable
I hope they make a new dual controller for the GO like on the rift. Or make the rift ones work with the GO. So we can play more games and also introduce better Bluetooth control for headphones and keyboards.
they have better lenses right?
If you gret a 6DOF all in one with 6DOF all in one controllers, then i think you will have a product.
RPO anyone?
this stuff is useless dust collecting garbage
Its amazing! I Will buy one when i finish buying my GPU and Pc parts
Well, this explains why Oculus suddenly stealth-released the Go...
This looks better than the oculus go, but I already bought a bunch of stuff for the gear vr and if it transfers to the Go then that's what I need to get. I'd hate to have to rebuy my stuff.
Try the 300USD subpac m2 with some of your VR games. I heared its very immersive. Especially for audiophiles like Jeremy.
Amazon treasure truck has this for $50 off today in LA, still can't really justify the cost though. I'm sure porn would be great with it.
With LIV you also look amazing!
This video is 20 minutes long because you repeat yourselves at least three times on every unique idea or subject you bring up. Learn to condense your thoughts.
@Tested - Does either headsets thermal throttle like on mobile VR and have to let your mobile cool down? Does the Solo have quick charging? Can the Solo be charged while using? (Unlike the Oculus Go - They advise not to do that).
someone need to tell that asian guy he looks stupid with that hair cut, you are going bald we know
ever since this new "revolution" is still shit, no quality content, lagging like an old vr headset from the 90's. woaah a new front button!... this segment is growing horribly slowly, compared to 10 years, such as mobile phones. And the idea is older than mobiles. and now we really have to be happy that there are new colors in a game?
Worth $200.
OMG guys... You can turn the fade to black off! How did you miss that! Lon.TV to the rescue! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhjZxLPmM9s
At the VRLA Keynote yesterday, a Lenovo rep kept HAMMERING 6DoF like it was a deal breaker if you didn't have it. He never mentioned the controller being 3DoF or the bubble of activity keeping you from moving. I'm also shocked you guys didn't speak to the Google Apps they are keeping from the Go. No YouTube, No Google Earth. I'd like to hear how these are on the Google supported system. That's burying a lead!
Why no mention of Vive Focus?
Add in the AR parts, two hand controller as an accessory, and Chromecast receiving, and we have a winner! Ready to pay for my VR gym membership.
How does position tracking work in the dark?
I heard you can turn the safety option off the Mirage) - screen goes black when you walk too far ??
Like it's so tough to stick your phone into the gear VR. You guys are disappointing. Even though I do like the Oculus go!
All I can hear is 6dof vs. 3dof while people forget that costumers thinks in platforms not in hardware specs, so the pure hardware capabilities worth nothing on the market without proper software support. Daydream is a mobile phone platform so developers won't make content only for mirage solo, means there won't be too much content in the future that supports 6dof. Also if the initial price is high - regardless the device's price/performance ratio -, less people will buy it and there will be less content supporting it. If there's not enough content, a later price drop will not increase the sales since there won't be any reason for customers to buy the hardware. This is the "chicken and egg" problem they are talking about in the video. Oculus made the Go 3dof for a reason: to reduce the initial price and be compatible with the existing gearVR content so there are hundreds of software available right at the start. I think this is why mirage solo will have marginal share on the VR market: it can be a superior hardware for the price if it fails as a VR platform.
Hey guys, I've been working on a WebVR conversion for our simulation software at work. It works great with the Oculus Rift. Do these stand-alone VR headsets fully support WebVR 1.1? With the 6DoF? Is there a (free) app for browsing WebVR websites? Are you guys aware of WebVR and it's development?
Will you be reviewing the HTC Focus?
Here we go! Just bought one of each.
It would be nice if we had a Mirage Solo comparison with Vive Focus
nahhh ima pass on this one, $600 in Australia for a basic vr experience...Nope
U can disable the safety zone and walk there is a video upload today this device is better than oculus
what is the intro song????????????
So, it's Audioshield?
Great to see the mobile VR progressing well. Still happy with my vive but can't wait for the next gen.
FYI points aren't based on how hard you hit for Beat Saber, it's how wide your swing is. So basically swing with your whole arm not your wrist.
Seems blindingly obvious that a chaperone feature should be included as a basic safety feature.
So sad how Google isnt advancing VR in a meaningful way. Oculus has simply a better package, as of now that is. Cant wait for Santa Cruz or anything similar 6dof from any company who knows how to utilize it ...
Why didn't you try the Blade Runner exclusive game that comes with this headset? I'm pretty sure it takes full advantage of the 6DoF tracking.
new intro please!
$400. Positional tracking and no way to know if you're gonna fall out the window and die? ??
Not including speakers is a good thing because others won't hear the moaning. You can just use your ear buds.
Lol just throw a beat saber review in there will yOu
Awesome channel guys!!
Or since these are just phones use phones for VR. Phones are upgraded every year or two so it will constantly get better. For IOS you already know what the spec will be. You just need a standard. Daydream is a good standard expand it to iOS and market it and they can get an edge.
I almost didn't notice that they posted this video about Beat Saber on 5/4/2018.
7:55 Yup, the Lenovo one still doesn't have a trigger, just like the daydream, so they have learned NOTHING. Idk, that might be a deal breaker for me. It's one damn button but the one damn button I NEED. Btw what's the built-in storage capacity? How high can the external capacity be? How long to charge the headset with type-c? Can a bluetooth controller(for games) be linked to this? Does it have bluetooth? Please, a little less geeking out about the 6 point tracking and more about what the hardware can do. Thank you.
400$ is not bad actually. A phone + gear VR with a decent framerate can cast waaayy more than that and you would have a worse experience than with the Lenovo Mirage. The Gear VR doesn't support 6DOF in any way. It's NOT a bad price!
I wish more people would mention Windows Mixed Reality when talking about games. I mean if you look on steam on the Beat Saber page, it says it supports Vive, Rift AND WMRs. Esp when the Video talking about it is talking about these new low cost headsets when WMR's can be had for $200 AND have a higher resolution screen than a Vive or Rift.
So I both both of these are kinda useless. If I want to play 360 videos then the $10 walmart VR headset that works with your phone(any phone) can do that just fine. If I want to play a game than 6dof and tracked controllers are mandatory for enjoyable VR. If you want to play games and only have 200-400 than a Xbox or PS4 is a better decision.
Awesome??, two Projections episodes in one week! Keep the VR news coming guys!
Will we have Samsung Oddysey review?
Missed a comparison of screens in practice?
They sort of give points for accuracy, you get more points if you slice the box in two perfect halves. Doesn’t matter the angle.
So did Lenovo put a "We'll black list your ass if you talk shit about our screen, lenses and battery life" condition on that review unit and it was so bad that you just decided to leave it out all together? Or did you guys just forget to talk about that stuff?
Nice review. I'd love to see a review of the mirage camera and how the vr180 photos look (on mirage solo vs Oculus GO vs Daydream)
I don't have a HUGE desire for a standalone VR headset but at $200 the Oculus Go is just cheap enough for me to think about giving up positional tracking to watch pre-downloaded Netflix shows/movies on a 10hr flight. Will the missing DoF be too much of a barrier for me as an HTC Vive user? I guess my best bet is to hope I can try both out at a Best Buy or something.....
Still doesn't look like you'll be able to play games that are comparable to the ones on Rift/Vive/PSVR with the Solo's controller only allowing 3DOF.
Grams? Hello....? We live in America here...
Still waiting for VR to git gud.
Awesome. Different is better and Lenovo the best
watching and commenting in my oculus go ??
Wonderful.
It's been how many years with VR headsets and they're still this expensive.... it'll live on as a novely or priviledged device unless they bring the prive down to its expected price
Have Lenovo or Google commented about how many apps they expect to update to 6DOF? This review was an eye opener for me and I might go for the go
$400 and no speakers and gimped software
I picked up beat saber and it's fantastic. I can't wait to get off work so I can hop back in.
Classical music would be great for that game. Stand there like Mozard.
Hope you guys share some of your thoughts on the new oculus halv dome prototype
there's no way you can lean back with the mirage but the pressure on you face is not there. if i was in a bed i would choose to go.
$400! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA aAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA rift is better
Could you theoretically go outside in a huge football field and walk around in VR with this?
just love vr.
now this is what im willing to pay double the price of the window mr based headset . instead of the oculus one. tho i will wait for more content to come out .
Damn son, this absolutely kills the Go! Pretty much every problem that the Go has is solved by this thing.
The rigid strap makes it hard to travel with despite being more comfortable
I'm guessing the FOV is the same as the Go and other headsets since it wasn't mentioned, but what about the lenses? Are they Fresnel? Does the device have any god rays? Any SDE/brightness differences between this and Go? I feel like you guys glossed over the most important things - the display and optics!
For the cost go with Windows Mixed Reality Headset or oculus Rift. Especially if you have a PC that can run it. Get best of both in Experiences and VR Games.
I just returned my Oculus go. it has the problem as any VR headset I have tried. the screen gets blurry on the edges. it's clear only when you look at the screen dead straight center. it sucks I got all excited ??
Boycott Projections until VR praying mantis makes the intro reel!!!
To everyone interested in BeatSaber, also take a look at McOsu which is free on steam! It uses the beatmap library of the f2p game osu!, with thousands of community hand-crafted maps and you hit circles which fly towards you. Loads of fun, TRY IT!
400 dollars?! That’s BS! Sure it’s a good headset, but the full psvr package only costs 350 if you have a PS4 and even that package comes with a game, higher quality tracking mechanics, and a bigger game library. Not worth the buy whatsoever, especially if you already have a good pc or a PS4.
well u can walk around with the focus..... all this needs to get that is an update
I really don't see VR working yet with today's tech. Doesn't seem fun to get nausea or to be restricted to a certain space or movement speed. I wanna go all out, not halfway out keeping in mind the furniture around you. Until then, imma wait instead of buying these things.
Once 3dof dies and we all have tracked controllers, all of VR will be unified under one control scheme.. There's nothing in the way of us playing something like Rec Room across all platforms. That's important for VR to be adopted. Common games for all platforms.
Going for go
What is the battery capacity of such a headset?
You guys going to do a video on the OnePlus 6 when it comes out this month?
Reviews can be concise you know, these are more overviews than reviews imo
The Oculus Go has some light leak in the nose area. What kind of light leak does this headset have? Additionally, how much light is needed for the 6DoF to work? I tend to enjoy VR more when I'm in dim to no lighting to prevent any chance of light leak. I worry these front cameras need a good amount of light to properly work.
How long before I get heat throttling issues like current daydream phone VR
Hey Tested, could I ask how Lenovo Mirage Solo's 5.5-inch LCD display compares to the fast-switch LCD inside Oculus Go in terms of brightness and SDE?
I'm glad this works off of Daydream, because I already bought the Go and it's nice to know if I buy this I have the different set of content.
This is awesome!
Can we expect a Lenovo Mirage Solo Revisited Review in a month or two? Give devs time to build and accommodate the 6DoF. Daydream missed the boat by not having titles ready to go at launch.
Any word on the lens quality compared to Go?
Norm and Jeremy, as always your VR news game is on point. Love your channel.
I think $400 is too expensive for this type of product. Either get a go and enjoy mobile vr or buy a rift for $350 and enjoy full scale vr.
Looks like a bootleg PSVR
How do the battery lives fair against each other?
Will just get the Go.
3DOF controllers are only interesting in the absence of a standalone headset with 6DOF controllers. This headset and the Vive Focus are going to have their lunch eaten by Oculus Santa Cruz in 2019.
what about tracked controllers??
Any idea of UK release date?
What they need to fix in VR is the price. They should make phones compatable
Honestly I see little point in these type of VR devices. They contain essentially the same components as a smartphone, so it makes more sense to use your existing, already VR capable phone.
Nobody cares if you're first post.

32gb after full update you only get 18gb-20gb left not that bad. I can at least keep depending on the size of the game about 25. 64gb after full update you get 55gb left. Got the 64gb for more gave saver
Its not all-in-one if you need a phone.
So it doesn't work on it's own, it requires a mobile device?
Hey Frank if only it had the latest version of the steam link beta app. I own the original steam link box and to put into perspective that is only useful for streaming from a high tier desktop. But I have successfully streamed my whole 80 games steam library from my budget laptop to my mid range/tier smartphone with no lag. Because if you didn't know it wireless streams from the hardware of the laptop/desktop, to any Android device that is version 6.0 or newer for example: any smartphone, tablet or TV stick that is run Android 6.0 or newer.
i think your monitors are upside down... noob. you should put 1 on the bottom and 2 on the top... shovel slinging spoon head
The thing that would maybe put me off is that colour shift /tint. That stuff can be really annoying.
I want this for Netflix. It would be awesome even for camping if you don't have a iridium just to watch a movie on the odd occasion if you can save movies to it like you can with Netflix on your phone.
Can anyone tell me what that wierd type of black and white Rubik's cube is at 3:03 is please. Thanks in advance.
Is this the exact same thing as the Samsung VR? I mean like software wise because when you showed the store and games it was the EXACT same as the Samsung VR.
64 Gb to save adult movies is not enough space. Average storage space for those kind of content is 2 Terabytes.
the oculus go is amazing . end off
Can I use it for porn?
Pr0n!!!!!
Does this replace ps4???
Love your bunny ears
An amazing device! Everyone should own one!
pOrn video links
6:00 you ad to mention you can put porn in it.the only reason this shit is on the market enyway
6:45
Looks like they shoved something like the Xiaomi hardware in there. Not a diss - my Redmi 5 Plus is a FANTASTIC replacement for my Galaxy Note 5. Pleased to see hardware costs coming down, while quality is getting up there!
I wish I had it but it’s so expensive !
I am human
Porn lol
I got a question so when you go into Netflix does it put you in a theater? Or how does the theater work cause that’s the feature I want soo bad
i liked the part when you took off the Go and then smoothed your flat hair .........
so pretty much.....you'll never ever use this but a few times, especially if you've got real vr systems
Can you use apps on ur phones
I have the chromatic abration problem with my glasses because I have such a strong prescription
hey frank p, great video quality, you got a great camera!
2:10 Is that Xiomi logo?
Why aren't they building these to run off computers? What I mean is, why can't they just build a display which can interact with the game, but not need to be hefty itself to run the game? Why can't they just build a display so that we can play any game we want and be able to have realistic experience?
1:27 I feel like my life just flashed before my eyes
i dont know but something about his face but it makes me want to fuck my uncle
Now that I know I can watch porn, can you also read books on it? I mean, like pdf files?
If the is no external sensors then WHY IT COSTS 200$
But can you hook it up to your PC and play your Steam games and such on it?
Would you say the 32 gbs...I mean 23 would be enough generally? Not sure if I want to shell out an extra $50 + tax for 64 gbs (or 55)
trust me u need those headphones for research
All I care about is if I can play the same games
Do you need a good phone to play the games? Because I only have an iPhone 5s
Does anyone know if(or how) I can use Google Earth with Oculus go?
For the battery level u could use a powerbank
Compare it to the Lenovo mirage solo which has 6 degrees of freedom.
im watching this on my oculus go the browser is bigger than expected.
Does the oculus go work with the game “Job Simulator”? Plz answer i need to know :)
Atleast the oculus rift has 2 controllers!! thats the only reason i wont get the go
Hi. Have you tried it on FSX, and does it work properly? Sincerely Flemming.
wa that the xaomi, logo, was this made by oculus in contibtuion wiht xaomi?
is this for the pc or for the phone
You never confirmed or denied the existence of VR porn.
This looks pretty cool
6:45 err what reason ?
take alot of money and include one remote also same as gear vr
Oculus go to the pols
READ THE PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS AGREEMENT! Nope nope nope!
Cool review man, one of the best I've seen so far. I think social VR is going to be the next big thing, not necessarily games, but socialising and watching movies with friends who may be on the other side of the world.
Is it PC be or just VR ? If it's just VR then good but not then I m no longer interested??
Well done.
why not just get a HP Windows mixed reality headset? same price, but you get the 6 degrees of freedom and twin controllers, aswell as access to all HTC, RIFT and Microsoft VR games
Does it have Job Sim?
so this is basically a dk1?
It’s a good 360 video player, but I wish things like these would stop being advertised as VR because they’re not. Even the “games” are just interactive 360 experiences. It’s giving VR a bad or name. I’ve had so many people say to me “I’ll never buy VR, $500 for 360 video is just stupid. “ thinking that the vive and rift are like this and those other things you stick your phone into.
There’s a Xiaomi logo on it?
Ready player one vibes
"use this for appropriate content but come on, we're all human" xd #vrporn
For those that dont know oculus is the company not the product so the go and the rift are obviously different as they are two different products
Great review man !
Your logo looks like jack frags.
Will my old Samsung Gear VR games (from Oculus store) still play on Oculus GO? Probably obvious that it should, but I wanted to double check.
basically my google cardboard just a rip off one LOL
I'll just stick to the Oculus rift
i hope they make a go + in the future
ok. Out of interest, what phone have you got?
You're so wrong about the Go providing higher resolution than the Rift! The Go has a single display so it's basically 1280 x 720 per eye whereas the Rift is 2160 x 1200 per eye because it has 2 screens and both of the screens are 2160 x 1200. So the resolution on the Rift is almost twice as good as the screen on the Go.
I don't know who created Oculus Go, but I try to figure out how we get them to have Oculus Go to the Polls
why did he compare a pc headset to a phone one the best games is on pc, fuck the phone vr its not realy vr
you have pretty eyelashes
Why does it show two screens?
2 hr battery life is a killer, come on Oculus.
Wow... didn't know Oculus Go was made by Xiaomi. That's dope
Can u connect it to a pc
I am trying so hard to find a vr headset to let me play vrchat. THIS IS SO HARD TO DO! ALL I WANT TO DO IS JUST PLAY GAMES ON A VR HEADSET BUT THIS GETS SO COMPLICATED ABOUT PC'S AND JUNK! ALL I NEED IS JUST SOME SIMPLE ANSWERS LIKE DOES IT NEED A PHONE, CAN I PLAY GAMES ON IT, CAN I DO MULTIPLAYER WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SOME OTHERS. THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!
Wait what 2as that mi logo ?
Do you see the pixels?
If you own a Samsung Gear VR and made purchases on the Oculus Store, can those same purchases be used on the Oculus Go?
Dude, I like your glasses. What make and model are they?
What’s up with franks and vr?
I tried it. 5min later I put it away and will not touch again. if you want VR experience, go for tethered headsets.
I’m really interested to get this for cinema movie watching experience !!! Will this work with Movies Anywhere ??? That’s where I keep my movies !! Also if this is a portable device , how does it connect to the internet when you are on the go ??? Thank you !!
Not available in Canada!
Is this thing out yet
I have that
Great overview of the Oculus Go! What has been your favorite app to use it with so far?
Amazing Colors. your eyes are so green!
I'm an independent developer and will say apart from the obvious lag this setup is exactly what is needed to turn the oculus go into a viable AR device please post how you achieved this and whether it would be possible using any android or ios phone good experiment that developers like me are looking for could the image be made to be all that is visible for instance the only image you see without the virtual space cuz if so then this is how we can bring AR to the oculus go...
is it wireless
1. Does it have Bluetooth to pair Wireless Headphones? 2. Do Apps have to remain on the phone, or alps stored on the Go? 3. How do you adjust Focus? 4. How is the Screen Door effect, if any? Thank you.
Does it have higher resolution than the Gear Vr?
The only reason I'm buying this is for porn
Phone VR sucks.
Does it over heat like when you use the Gear Vr?
This is a excellent device, I develop for one at my work and I think it's a great media consumption device but definitely not made for games. The 2 main reasons are the controller and the only 4 DOF tracking. I feel like Oculus developed this as a 'gateway drug' you buy this for £200, discover you love it but want more so you spend £400 on the bigger better brother the rift
It is not vr if it is not stereoscopic.
I've had my Go for about a month now, and I agree with everything you've said! The biggest cons for me are the frame rate and the colour shift. The frame rate isn't a big deal if the game is mostly stationary or has slow movements, but it makes me a little uncomfortable when I have to shift my head quickly. And the colour shift is annoying, not enough to make me stop using the device, but I think about it when I first put it on. Great review!!
gear vr is the best sex toy
Who here is just here to buy one for VR chat
1:28 be careful with those errors, you may make someone have a seizure
Wait 2:05 Xiao Mi?!!!? The logo is there but,why?!?!
NOLO is a great third-part add-on you should check out (I have it for my Gear VR and hope to use it on this if I decide I get one). When it comes out, can you do a vs review of this against the Vive Focus?
One of the more solid reviews I’ve seen on this device. Subscribed.
hEaDpHoNe JaCk
This is not for gamers. Most of the games are utter garbage. This is not true VR????????
I could've sworn he said that they put out a thing that said you have to be 13 to watch porn.
Wait 3 days for paycheck to get 32gb or wait 2 weeks and 3 days for the 64gb...... ugh ugh
Daydream>Oculus Go
Yeah you can porn on it I'm happy that's a buy for me
Oculus Dick
I've got an Oculus Go. It is good for 2 things. VR porn, and lightweight/gimmick games. In fact, it is great for those two things. If you want complicated and top rated VR gaming, then this won't work.
I'm tired of using my phone as the OS. It would always get hot after 15 or 20 minutes. Depending on what I play
Let's be real about what's going to make the Go a big winner this year by drawing a simple comparison: Gifts. Christmas gifts. $200 for the Go and the wide array of stuff adults and kids can do on a functional, portable, absurdly easy to use, self-contained VR headset. vs $200 for a 3DS, or $300 for a Switch. None of which is really going to blow your jaded 12 year old nephew's socks off in 2018, and your Aunt Maggie sure isn't going to use it. For the money, the gift of VR is the better choice.
2 hours battery life? I don't need 2 hours.
Is there any way to record the gameplay?
I got contacts recently and omg its amazing using the oculus with contacts instead of glasses
If this is for watching things and browsing the internet you could just buy Virtual Desktop for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and even Windows Mixed Reality.
VR IS SOOOOOO OVERRATED.
I want one!
Ive been trying to figure out, is the controller 6DOF or 3DOF?
I want this. :3
He made sure he said what else you can use it for! Good review!
So this allows you to watch videos and nothing else? and on a worse resolution than a monitor, so you may aswell just sit back down at your PC and watch whatever it is that you are gonna watch.
Just get a windows mixed reality headset. Some, like the hp one, are pretty cheap.
How is the accessibility for visually impaired and totally blind gamers? Do you think you can close your eyes and use it?
terrible transition from the oculus to the remote
It's an overpriced samsung vr

Why I saw mi logo on the oculus side? 2:05
Can we use it like to play vr steam games i guess not
3:28 Doesn’t the rift have more pixels per eye?
I'm looking for something like this, but it needs to be a better experience in gaming. This looks nice but I would like to play the Oculus Rift games.
It always annoyed me when people compare pc vr to mobile vr. It like comparing call of duty to angry birds
It's Random Frank Sellout
Love how he’s the only youtuber that mentions vr porn while review
No one is addressing the lack of a viewing adjustment wheel as in the Samsung Gear VR. Please explain how you focus your view.
It's made by xiaomi?
Really interesting man, thanks for the great review! :)
Would this work with RiftCat VRidge or Trinus VR? If so could it potentially replace a full Oculus Rift?
Oculus Go takes 45 minutes to fully charge with the included 2 amps usb wall plug (included in the American version only).
Frank can the Oculus Go run regular Android apps? I am wondering if it can run my DJI Go app for Mavic Pro
This is what I call trash just buy a pc and a real headset just say in much better for ur money it's 200$ more for the other one which in my opinion is better for your money
If only it had oculus touch controllers with it.
So are you limited to the oculus apps and games?
Xiami collab with Occulus? :O
Hey man.do a monitor give away
Eyy could you do a review of the Rakk kimat xt2 mechanical keyboard? It's a cheap but well made mechanical keyboard from the philippines. Thnksss!!
Can you do the review on ligitech G910
can you watch vids on full screen there? instead of having theater background
can you install other apps like DJI GO4 APK android apps to us it to vr drone flights
Is it just me, or does it seem like when you're inside browsing for games, movies, songs and whatnot, the house reminds me of "When A Stranger Calls"...that isn't just me, right?
Does this headset have its own processor or does it use your phone? Just wondering since I have an older phone. Thanks
Can you watch Netflix over 4g or only wifi?
Facebook yuck?????????????? I wish this was made my Samsung and was pure Android/mobile VR os. Because i hate Facebook/octopus
just pay 50 bucks more and you can get a proper VR experience with window vr.. and play all steam games.. this is trash and has 6 degrees of freedom
If you used the headset straight out of the box your head must be very tiny. ??
Rainbow LED lights makes things...even more gay
Oculus Go for 3d porn
For the app do you need the oculus go or cam you use a different headset
What are your top ten vr porn sites? ??
if you substract the money for the sensors and the controllers, the rift headset costs not twice as much.
Is there a way to hook up a console to it? Since you can use it as a person movie theater basically couldn't u be able to play consles on it if ur tired of useing a 32 inch?
Its essentially Gear vr without the phone.
asdf
#VRporn
What was that smartwatch?
3:40 nice try but it didnt quite match
any chance u will try the 6dof daydream headset by Lenovo .....with 6dof it's capable of a real vr experience
Your shots are Awesome i love your videos. I hope you will rech the 1 million soon. (Im subscriber since you have 150k :) )
Do lenovo mirage solo please! Thanks for your vids!
How about the upcoming Android Steam Link to play games :D?
nice Video! But were can iI find your wallpapers?
what watch are you? :D
#RIFTMASTERRACE
Can you charge while using? I do not get why you need more space on that is it for storing game data or is it pretty much to keep your private images/videos on the device?
So could this VR headset be plugged into a computer to be used with a driving sim?
That demonstration of color shift at 9:48. The little touches make a difference.
What app was that gun game you were playing?
Where is your mom?
porn
What side do you watch when the video is in vr COMMENT L FOR LEFT COMMENT R FOR RIGHT
Why is there a Xiaomi logo at 2.12
So one thing I could see this being used with is for air travel or just long distance travel in general, just being able to get away from everything else, I'm going to Italy in a month and I feel like this would make that plane ride a lot more bareable.
why it has xiaomi logo there....and and xiaomi is the king of light in price
LOVE YPUR COOL VIDS!!
If i already have a Galaxy S8, Should I Get a Samsung Gear VR or an Oculus Go?
2 hours battery life is plenty.. You only need max 20 mins..
Can you use an Xbox controller (I kinda want to play Minecraft in VR), and how many games/apps can be stored on those 23 GB?
Hmmm I wonder what "Aproppriate" content... vr porn my dudes hell yeah
7:20 $5 smartphone? SIGN ME UP
I would use this to watch movies on a plane
“ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE*
Nah, i have the 2017 Gear VR)
he said it just when I was thinking it :D
all of the vr`s are either overpriced for pc, (mine isn`t vr compatible) or u have to put your phone in (i already have one which is made from cardboard that I got for free) unless the oculus go , so probably gonna pick that up.
Mfw 200 dollar vr porn device
Wait wait wait... The rift has 90hz OLED?!? I heard that OLED was limited to 60hz...
I use the Gear VR with my S7 mostly to watch movies. Is the Oculus Go a worthwhile upgrade? Is the picture quality much better?
That intro was incredible when you were wearing it. x3
That's one expensive google cardboard
Comparing a VR headset powered by a computer to on powered by a smart phone . lol come on people
Soo basically a samsung vr?
Its basically a useless toy in my opinion.. better go with the "real" oculus.. u can always buy a 5£ phone headset, not 200£ oculus
"You're thinking it, i'm thinking it" WHOA HEY THERE
So there are apps where i can watch 3D movies? or is it locked down in that sense
Great for media consumption, but I DO NOT recommend trying to game on 60hz fps for long sessions. It's quite nauseating. Anyone who's experienced frame drop to 60fps on Rift or Vive can tell you how puke-inducing it can get. 60hz is great for gaming on a screen, but for VR it's very easy to get motion sickness.
randomfrankp = quality
For proper VR porn, make sure you buy two controllers
Just get an Htc VIVE (Where the controller doesnt look like a d*ld*
Thanks for the tip about the glasses spacer. I’ve been annoyed about the light coming through the nose hole but now I’m using the spacer(even though I don’t wear glasses) and the light is gone.
Can u use it even if its charging? Can u display ur iPhone content like a Apple TV/ Chrome cast ?
"You're thinking it, I'm thinking it."
A 200 dollar vr headset! Wow For your phone.(You can get the same experience with a 50 one)
I wanna use this while I’m flying, I’m sure I’ll look weird on a plane with this on though.
?????? you really intro’d with a $200 blindfold
Great Review !
Great for gaming ????
How does it connect to phone Bluetooth wifi
Go oculus GO!!!!!
earth death in vr
You’re edit skills are on point??. Love the stuff, keep it up.
I kind of think this is something you buy and use for a month and than put it in the drawer after that. Not enough content and the tech is still not as advanced as we want it to be. Great review though! You covered all the points!
Wait am I missing out on VR porn?? I thought it was more a porn-adict thing but alright, if I must, I'm gonna break out my gearVR and give it a go Oculus GO is basically a glorified GearVR with no cell phone needed.. Although battery life will probably be a little worse than gearVR as that relies on the phones battery, I guess it more depends on what content your watching..
Made by xiaomi?
Approve of g13 logitech keyboard thank you!
wow Great Price Performance!
Nope, Thought the "Go" meant like a vr type overlay of the real world so I could do Mario bros Go or Donkey Kong Go.
Love the intro ?? keep doing what your doing
1 week later lol
I would rather have google cardboard
That intro tho
2:06 why is there a xioami logo?
uhhh did i see a dbrand grip??? mine just came today. sadly my samsung s7 edge fell down and broke... it is half usable some thing can be seen but some are just black and it really slows me down and restricts me and i don´t even have he money to buy a new one or repair it... but the case seems to be awesome
6:45 oh yeah, lets go frank!
“They even say to use appropriate content, but we’re human” LMAO ??????
2:06 Why is there a xaomi logo?
notification squad all the way! love your vids frank!
i bet he watched porn already lol

Great vid frank.. luv the content.. keep it up.. thanks for helping me decide... Sense idk what i should buy
Siick
You are literally the best at reviewing technological items! I have bought so many things after watching your in-detail reviews on items.
This is awesome! fav youtuber
Cool VR!!!
Notifsquad! Can't wait to watch the video
No one cares .st
Great product!
I freaked out when I saw him at the beginning
Hi
Second
1
First
Like before the video
5th
I can't buy gear RV for my kid but his iPhone that problem. that why.
PLEASE CAN I KNOW IF THIS PRODUCT CAN WORK WITH SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE EDGE
Samsung should come up with an improved S-Pen which, when used together with the phone's camera, acts like a pointing device in the VR user interfaces just like what the mouse does in the two dimensional displays. And strapping Gear VR on your face then slowly pulling out the V-Pen (I want to call the improved S-Pen a V-Pen, as in Virtual Pen ;)) will have out of this world level coolness.
Will temper glass on my note 4 effect the picture quality?thanks
and also tip of advice take your oculus off first  when talking ok or make a narration while in the video because your talking like an idiot really no offense...
Great for making you look like you have tourettes and autism in public. :p
This or Google Cardboard?
good
December 1st $200
So is there any way to connect your PC to it? If not, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it. If its an oculus subsitute, I would pay well over $100
runescape anyone?
Looks like Stevie Wonder had something to do with those VR. Epic stuff for sure,.
Would you be able to watch movies etc? Or like youtube?
Something many people don't understand is innovation. Yes there will a lot of shitty tech coming out in the years to come, but if we don't try to push ourselves, and actually make shit, we wont get anywhere. We can't just think that something good is gonna come out without any bad's or mediocre. we need to let new tech ideas involve over time. (Please keep in mind when you read my comment, that English is not my first language.)
And how hard is it to put "two" independent focus adjustment dials for each eye instead of just one? Lots of people interested in this kind of tech wears prescription glasses and most of their eyes have different diopters.
They can develop a device which you can then wear as a belt and it's engineered such a way that it acts like the receiver of Razer Hydra controllers . The device can be connected to the Gear VR and provides positional tracking just the way Hydra does. Maybe Samsung will come up with a new Gear smart watch which when used with Gear VR provides positional tracking. Or the camera on the back of the Note 4 can be utilised to be used for positional tracking. If the Gear VR comes out without positional tracking capabilities I'll pass and wait for the next version.
I have a request for add the new feature on Gear VR. Can you support the PC games on the Gear VR by using Remote Desktop Application or create the Gear VR Desktop Game Center Application for PC? It will be the great idea for PC gamers.
OASIS!!!
cool
That is awesome, can't wait to try it out.
take that apple!!!
Does anyone know if it'll work for the Note Edge?
could i use the edge with the gear VR?
Will this work with the Note edge?
I'd like to hear about opinions of the product, not just the same old derivative info. :(
If they made one for galaxy s5 I would buy it :(
they should combine it with google maps street view
Google did this with cardboard :P
"uh... i'm gonna die."
Very cool concept. I like how they are using the phone to power the VR; this allows you to get a better VR rig every time you get a new phone (every 2 years). I think VR would have a way better adoption rate if everyone wasn't worried about wasting money on VR when next years model will blow away 1st gen equipment... It would be cool if maybe Google made a standard VR headset (something nicer then Google Cardboard) and then said all future Nexus devices will work on it. My guess is you would have to leave size of the phone the same to accomplish this.
google cardboard anyone?
Only note 4...what about edge?
I love how people criticize this without even trying it first...  shows how narrow minded people are
I'll use google cardboard.
Do you think it would be available for Galaxy S5?
lmao how's this different from google's cardboard VR?
I'm pumped about this. Just waiting to here how much the Note 4 + headset bundle will be. Games of course are going to be awesome with this, but I'm also looking forward to watching movies on Netflix where it feels like I am watching it in a movie theater.
hate it or love it ,id use this just for a awesome quad HD MASSIVE display for movies , u seen the cinema/theatre demos on the rift ,imagine this but in 1440p and for less than a QHD projector
the only problem i have with gear VR is that...i want the EDGE
The downside has to be that you cant play any media from external sources.
Trust me, you really don't look like a moron wearing those. Really, Stevie Wonder doesn't come to mind at all.
How about actually SHOWING the gameplay and the LATENCY, which is very important, nobody is interested in your head movement
hands free for porrn
Its a great bit of kit and I will probably get one, but I am not going to use it in public. It makes you look like a cross between someone doing a bad Ray Charles impersonation and ... Rain Man.
So will this be an alternative to the Rift?  It'd be a great selling point if it was compatible with PC games.  It has a higher resolution as well (provided Rift is 1920x1080).
you look very special in that review.
oohhh i'm gonna die xD
looks very cool. I'l have to try something like that for my self, before i'm convinced . or at least read a ton of reviews
So.. it's just a shell for the phone?
So he's reading us the instructions while he's wearing it himself, what a USEFUL video.
This would be cool if you could do video chat with people on the other side of the world, so it will seem like your standing next to them.
Carmack does not get on public stage often, most people don't realize the significance of that, or even who  he is.
Sub 20ms latency, is Carmack a fucking wizard?
Wow. This is a really good advertisement for using VR headsets in private.
This is freaking amazing!!!!!!
Is it out already ? I'm talking about note4
I'm tired of watching old dudes wearing this thing, how about some footage from the actual games?
If you cant connect it to a pc or a console then it is usless.....
THANKS FOR THE GAMEPLAY
NOW YOU CAN LAG AND CRASH. SWINESUNG ALWAYS RIPPING OFF EVERYONE PATHETIC SHEEP COMPANY.
Does anyone know if, when released, this will work with the note 3?
That looks soo cool
With the technology that We have these days, come on verge, you guys should slip a mini camera in there so we can somewhat understand what this is all about. Otherwise people will just dismiss it like it never existed
The #future awaits. Thanks #samsung
The idea is cool, but who would use a phone as a VR set in real life?
Looks fun!
He looks mentally challenged in this video.
A joypad would be handy...or keyboard + mouse for FPS games
Great review on the Gear VR I think this will push me to get the Note 4 over the Note Edge. I read some where that the Note 4 might get the octa-core cpu? Has anyone hear about this?
Don't tell me what to do!
is it actually any good? what is the quality like?
This reminds me the VIRTUAL BOY from Sega, I mean. Nintendo
R.I.P. Oculus.
people are saying stupid things about the product without even using it... dumb ass
So this has cool potential but will most likely fail. I was really exited when I first saw it but becoming a bit disappointing. If they can incorporate some thing like the Samsung Remote PC app and let a computer do the heavy work this might actually be kinda cool.
Can it use the Note Edge?
When they incorporate the phone's camera and use this for augmented reality we'll be getting somewhere.
This is hilarious.
This would make you motion sick like crazy!
Samsung is really terrible. It is the most terrible smartphone i know. Mine always going OFF/restart/hanging!!! It really makes me nervous to the extent that i want to throw it on the trash.
I have no plans on getting a different phone just to have this watered down VR set.
Oculus rift is better
So @Samsung Mobile , what you say you have here is just an insanely expensive model of Google Cardboard. Wow.
Everyone is jumping into VR fad. Sony with Morpheus, and now Samsung with Gear.
What the heck would you use this for lol.. not very innovative; in my opinion lol
Everyone thinks I look pretty cool wearing the all new Gear Vr... in my virtual reality.
They should Develope a VR OS Interface for the Phone, where u can watch around and look at the app u wanna start ect.
Wait so how would you play a game with the headset when you can't access the display ?
Now that Samsung are backing them, Oculus is virtually invincible.
800th like
SWORD ART ONLINE YOUR COMING OUT SOONER THEN I EXPECTED
Gaming in Holo Deck? Or, porn in 360 degrees? Whatever... I am going to get it!
Not into it, the Oculus Rift is great as an independent controller, but for this, well, I don't want a future where people have their phones attached to their face like Wall-e
I was hoping for a HDMI/USB to Port PC games over but it would kinda of defeat the purpose in a sense. If this VR can actually show/play content in 2550x1660 Super Amoled between 60-90hz with near zero motion blur I will buy this. What I want to know is when u get a notification how it display on the VR without distorting your augmented reality ? Samsung Needs to include an SDK or something that will allow 3 party companies to let Gamers use controllers such as PS or Shield to go with its VR games. Im glad that They teamed with OC otherwise the Hardware would be a piece of junk.
Reminds me of that Nintendo product...
Shut up and take my money!
I dont know if this will fail or not but I'm leaning towards the its gonna fail side at the very least I dont see it going mainstream its but it might come down to price and if it has the apps to back up the device or devices since you also need a note 4
Is everyone missing the point?  Wireless VR, portable.  Its pretty ingenious actually, innovative in that they partnered with oculus and came up with a mobile platform.  Anyone that has used Oculus will agree, with headphones and maybe a leap motion, the wires add up.
Hahah he looks a bit retarded while playing with the device
Perfect for the /r/thefappening - NSFW kiss my ass!!!
I don't like samsung This is Oculus rift and they copy cat ... Sony and Apple better than Samsung
lol 1:19
Shamesung is stealing ideas from google..
0:35 Moves head like Stevie Wonder.
what about porn ?
Optic Blast
Its realllll
DAMN IT I'll buy the gen that is this + video input....................waaaaaaaaaaaaaait u can do it if the phone is sending sensors data to the pc and using splashtop ......or if the nvidia shield kind of streaming stuff ever get to phones ..................................and u can use the oculous software stuff on your pc and than stream the pc screen to the phone.................and in the future the phones just need to have the leapmotion built in and the cameras r on a swivel so they can face the back or the front
Game developer doesn't want to worry about supporting all kinds of Bluetooth controllers and the consumer doesn't want to buy a separate controller.  This headset will need a dedicated hand controller if it were to be successful.
everyone are act and say the exact way when ibm refuse to endorse some developer who invent the mouse, or the people who laugh at the idea of flying vehicle when wrights brother made the first airplane for the first time. have a bit appreciation please!
But can it be used as a substitute for the oculus rift compatible pc games? If not it's currently a waste of money. Nearly all android phone apps are designed for use by the average handset. It would cost probably more than the rift itself and you'd be limited to only a few decent choices while the rest are gimmicks that just display the abilities it has. I think all of samsungs releases have generally come off as disappointments, but if they manage to continue building on it and getting other groups involved it may succeed in the future.
Cool idea, but kinda useless for general public.
From my understanding, the Gear VR will only work with it's own Oculus Store. So any games, movies or apps will work directly from the phone. Why couldn't they just put a HDMI and USB port on the goggles to play PC games on it, such a shame :(.
Oculus uses a note 3 screen (dk2) Soo no different It will be more expensive plus u need a note 4
what is the point ? rili useless piece of shit...
Fancy google cardboard
I hope in the future you can attach a headset and watch films like in your own cinema that would be great!
I'd prefer the free Google Cardboard!
So it's basically a premium version of google cardboard? No thanks.
Now Samsung, is officially in a league of its own. This is awesome
It is nothing without software and Samsung sucks at making software
Would only use in flight mode, I guess everyone has forgotten about phones held to your head and brain tumors
Would only use in flight mode, I guess everyone has forgotten about phones held to your head and brain tumors
Hey, if I want to watch movies, how can I connect the audio jack?? Or, I have to use the Bluetooth headsets??
Someone will input these into armor and become ironman...Jarvis...status report.
From my understanding it's google cardboard, but made of plastic.
If you've tried the Rift dev kit 2, you would be excited about a portable experience even 3/4 as good. Very swift, robust thinking here by Samsung I must admit.
looks like he is legitimately having fun
Sword Art Online anyone?
Sword Art Online anyone?
I can see neck aches everywhere
Samsung marketing about Galaxy gadgets reminds me Nintendo with it's NES in late 1980s: lots and lots of additional gadgets for their main products releasing faster than people understand what the hell is that
Google Cardboard + Samsung + Oculus - Google = Samsung Gear VR
I wouldnt game with it, thats what Rift is for. But watching a movie in a big VR cinema while lying on a couch? That could be really cool. Cant be that expensive.
Could you notice the screen door effect ? on this 1440p screen
With a good headset this would be perfect to watch 3D movies on :)
Nice
Neat! :D Looks pretty sweet anyway. Even without positional tracking, it's probably a good idea, to kick off lower-end VR on smart phones. And this stuff will get better with time. What I'm more interested in, is that since Samsung partnered with Oculus to make this, I wonder if this sorta hints at the design-shape/look that the Rift consumer model might have.
What a joke...
Wireless but no positional tracking :(
Lol dude looks spastic
Wow
No mention of a windows mixed reality headset? They are cheap, and very easy to setup. Plus full vive support.
What no pimax on your list ? Did you even do your homework before you made this video ?
mükemmel
K the vive pro was a big letdown and RIP off should not be on this list
I'd argue that the Rift is much better than the Vive. Not to mention the daydream being trash compared to the Go. Also the WMR. I doubt this guy has even tried any of these headsets
those are 3 years old headsets . wtf
Negative vote here. Not a single word about WMR. This video feels so sponsored by HTC. In other reviews, Samsung Odyssey beats Vive Pro in overall and in price. Vive Pro made some mistakes, has same lens from Vive and poor earphones. And some people even asked why it's blue and plastics... most headsets are black or dark gray color. That is more neutral and nicer. You missed too much VR changes in the world! Big fail for May 2018 video...
Why are freakin mobile headsets in a list with pc headsets?
This video is BS
do you need the samsung VR to use on a note 8, or can you use Google dream or any other?
i might either buy oculus with touch or the original vive
Listen uo people the oculus rift is very good you just need a good pc and set it up on steam vr
Im buyng the oculus in march 18
Its pretty sad that the Vive Pro priced at $1,400 for the basic setup is the best there is at the moment. Yea the field of view is nice but the headset is VERY heavy. Ok its not really that heavy but it sticks most of the weight so far from your face that it has a lot of leverage and causes extreme neck stain after very little time using it. Worse while the resolution may be the best on the market right now its still not very good. Technically the resolution is great. The problem is that while they do pack in a lot of pixels the magnification is such that you clearly see the gaps between each pixel. Imagine looking at a wall full of televisions which are all setup to display one giant picture. It might look great from a distance but the closer you get the more you see the boarders of each television. This is called the "screendoor effect" as it is similar to looking at something through a screen door. Many promoting the products claim that the screendoor effect is very noticeable at first but soon your mind automatically begins to ignore it and just see the picture. This is not true at all. If anything after a month with the HTC vive the screendoor affect was far more annoying than it was at first. In my opinion the screendoor effect needs to be reduced by at least 300% before most users will be satisfied with these types of headsets. If you are considering getting your first VR headset and $1,400 seems like a sizable investment then I highly recommend you wait a couple of years.
Fuk u
I'm using Samsung oculus, VR headset with s7 edge. Not good experiences. Not good resolution. Eyes strain. Dont use VR that needs cell phone to attach with it. Try to purchase a VR headset that has its own display screen in it with 4K resolution. I'm moving from cell.phone headset to orignal screen headset. Please let me Know, if anyone experienced.
Do you know if the “oculus Go” is any good?
Navidia?
What about the oasis?
Hey guys i Always wanted a VR Headset but cant aford it do u think if i open up a go fund me campain so i can buy a vr Headset People would give me Money? sorry for my bad spelling
Product which one your choice
where the the cardboard VR
I have 210 dollars hears about Vr headset does chores
Where is the Samsung Odessey MR headset? Its dominating nowadays!
Some problems i for example have with the vive is the blurryness. When your in for example steamVRhome and look straight forward and then take a controller in front of your sight, it looks pretty good, but when you raise the controller it will be disgusting blurrness, that maybe is the cause of the Spiral design on the lenses with i have no idea why HTC went with that design, they could have simply ignored those. It could also be becuase that i sometimes have bad sight or that i dident calbritrade the lens distance between my eyes. I really want the best of the best vr experience, wich accessories should i have, is glasses recomanded though i can't fit them too well but i maybe can, what could be the cheapest price for the nividia geforce gtx 970 or higher, Do i have to clean my lenses well, though i think i am doing it correct. I could really apriciate some suggestions to a video or something else that i can discover more about. Thx
why isn't pimax vr in the list?
The original Vive, PSVR and the Oculus Go will be mine...oh yes...they will be mine lmao!
PAID BY "Vive Pro"
Lmaooooooooo. ..ya ok. ..this is weak and NOT authentic
Why tf is daydream on this list?
Anything on the Pimax 8k?
What no oculus go what are u on ????
Not sure I trust your list since you didn't put the Samsung Oddesy in there anywhere!
Love Technology!
Where is the Lenovo Explorer Windows Mixed Reality? The Samsung Oddesey ? The Dell Visor? The Oculus Go? dude this video is outdated.
Liked before watching because your content is always amazing
i love the amount of people who do a double take to see what hes doing talking to a camera alone

Hey furious Pete
you should have done this on the Iphone 7 you put a headphone jack in.

if you have spacing issue would it be easier if you use styrofoam rather than foam to push the connector? because styrofoam is more rigid but not enough to break stuff if the thickness is right?

You know, you could put pressure on Apple by install Android phone features on iPhone. Just to show to Apple that is never been engineering problem but management bullshit and we can fire them.
memag gile betul teknologi china
So is this wireless charging module only for Apple? Or is it possible to also use it for android phones?
Build ur own iPhone 7, add headphone jack, and add wireless charging
Podia ter legenda em todos os vídeos pois gostei muito do conteúdos!!!!
I see the benefits of learning how to do pretty much anything, and I praise your efforts. What I can't see, is, relative to the efforts of hacking the device, the difference between putting down a phone on a mat as opposed to inserting it in a plug. How about removable storage? removable battery? a better camera? that would be the iPhone everyone is dreaming of! Anyways... that was just me being me, keep it up, whatever the way, as long as you are having fun.
do i need to solder this to my logic board?
Next Challenge: Put super super amoled screen something that neither the iphone Xs has

Your Videos are awesome
Love the iron man with the glowing eyes.
Time for apple to go to china for engineering not cheap labour.
U look like a slimmed down Furious Pete, and u sound like him too. ????
Nice video. This video is not just about the wireless charging but the creativity behind the people and how the markets and the surrounding ecosystem. A wild wild EAST out there! Love the statement in one of your video - "the future is already here but just not evenly distributed!". Keep it up.
I cant even find screen replacement for iphone 5s and do it myself... But in China, they already has, not just each iphone part, but also a wireless charging pad for iphone.... ??
It's a 1A charger?
Oh look, the "iDealer" is back!!
Have you tried the camera?
Install audio jack in it also
You should have put it in your custom phone
what is the laptop that you're using
The thing about “wireless charging” is the way it is now it’s not actually wireless. The phone essentially has to make contact with the charging plate to work. Not only that but wireless charging actually costs more energy because some of the energy dissipates before it is absorbed by the receiver. This is true with the Tesla wireless charging as well. I’ve seen another video stating that the average car would via as much as the electricity in the average 3 bedroom house to fuel per month. The cost is one thing but all that energy loss is definitely not a good thing. That energy could easily be used for something else. If more people actually utilized this technology it would put massive unnecessary strain on the country’s electrical infrastructure. I’m just saying sure this tech is neat but it only exists because people are do dang lazy to simply plug in the phone.
love how you're able to just set aside the problems you find for the next day instead of banging your head throughout the night trying to solve it immediately. I would kms to solve it now rather than waiting, which would probably result in less productivity.
@strange part , Scotty you should think of producing your phone brand whit all freedom possible to modify .
What game are they playing at 18:36? It looks interesting.

Dude just buy a damn Galaxy. Every stupid mod you do already exists on the old ass Galaxy phones. Gave up on iPhones when the aux was removed, I have Bluetooth but I also love the plug. iPhone used the excuse to remove it to add battery life but you already proved the gap was filled with a plastic part

Hello sir, can you show how to do this on redmi note 3?
?????????~??
wow apple products dont have this ? sorry but androind phones have this for years ... really for years
Don't understand, why i need to buy iPhone for some $, buy wireless charger kit for $70 and do it myself, when i can just buy another phone with this function and many others, that not exist in iPhone. iPhone is not good choise for thos, who need all of this stuff.
I've been watching your videos scotty from the beginning and I'm hooked. I'm a slightly older geek but love your videos and the way you present them.keep up the good work and keep those videos coming.makes me want to go to the markets now even more than ever when I do eventually visit.
You need to make a video if possible, how to replace home button with Touch ID if it breaks or you break one while swapping it, and if it is possible to reprogram it to the motherboard you want to use it with
next put this in the one with a headphone jack
Iphone 7 with a headphone jack and wireless charging please :D
Next challenge: iPhone 7 camera on iPhone 6S or iPad
Apple was going to release this next year :/
Anyone else get to the part where the wireless charging worked and saw that you weren’t even half way through the video ????????
Can you please tell me the market's name and place Please
24:00 and you know why this is possible there? Because they dont give a fuck about copyright or Apple's restrictions. Do you need anymore evidence of why copyrights RESTRICTS creativity and engineering innovation than this?
Something I use a lot are IR blasters on smartphones but they are slowly disappearing. Can we see an IR blaster perhaps in an IPhone!
it's sad that in indonesia . i can't get the parts so i can't try this. :((
I got to say from watching your videos this is going to be my second. These sort of videos give me inspiration to further more take on more challenges like soldering iPhone logic boards and other electronics
is there any overheating during the charge?
SUGGESTION: Use a solder shield, I know you will have to improvise one. Then use this electrically conductive glue to coat to each land thinly ( https://www.ebay.com/p/Repair-UltraFire-Flashlight-Conductive-Glue-No-Heat-Solder-Soldering-18ml/1300453321?iid=302627500938&chn=ps ( https://www.ebay.com/p/Repair-UltraFire-Flashlight-Conductive-Glue-No-Heat-Solder-Soldering-18ml/1300453321?iid=302627500938&chn=ps ). You will still use the foam tape so that the glue will cure under tension.
I can find my comment
good
Some extreme Apple fanboy tried to tell me that Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 to increase the size of the battery, among other reasons. Yet here you are, taking a iPhone 7, putting the headphone jack back, and even adding wireless charging. Apple fanboys can make some insane excuses for that company sometimes.
??????????
Hey Scotty! Why don't you start selling personalized phones???? I would buy a personalized phone from you!

You are getting better on Chinese!
APPLE CEO AND APPLE SECURITY IS LOOKIN FOR YOU! YOU ARE WANTED!
??? ??? ??? ???
i think there is a more reliable method , you should have tried , before installing the flex cable of the wireless charger , the connection points that is going to be touching on the main board should have beed cleaned , because there is always some residue on the solder that is on the mainbaord , and it will prevent the wireless charger connectors from connecting properly , or maybe you can just solder the whole thing its just 4 connections points , as i saw from your video , it needs some skills and fine tip solder , your microscope will definetally be a good help , if you did this at the begining , it could have been easier
apple should hire this man
how much is an iphone 7 over there that u just buy these things xd?
so geek
SP are my initials!!

do the same with the Galaxy S6 oh wait....
Can you add wireless charging to an iPhone 6 and a Galaxy S6 next? Like, take it a generation back? It would be really cool to see this feature on an older Samsung... oh wait...
What is that wireless charger at 36:30, can anyone help me?
you have a lot of wrinkles on your face cuz you make so many facial expressions lol.
If you ever sell a kit for the 7 plus let me know. Thanks! Very awesome add on! This is something I was hoping someone would do!
You should get some people , and get in the smartphone business .
Do you have wangweis we chat ?
samsung users can install this in 5 seconds
maybe use rubber instead of foam, rubber will keep constant compression over time.....
I am not sure if I missed this in your video but does that result in the phone loosing its water resistance rating?
Try putting a glass back on a 7
Once more on an iPhonexs, you will be cooked.
You'd think the foam would go on the connector before you slap the flex board and top connector on. This way the foam puts some spring on the flex board portion, so that there is a range of tightness on the closed connector that results in contact. With the foam outside the connector, it has to press it all the way down for good contact with the flex board.

Finally noticed some of the utility of the phone surgery tray - the matrix of depressions for screws and such - though might be nice to have broader, curved ones. The tool areas to encourage finding them quickly are handy. Thanks for another repair video and for taking us through the process - never give up when you know it can be done, learn how to adapt.

You should combine headphine jack and wireless charging
Well done!!! I really admire you enthusiasm and the motivation to do something. I can clearly see in your videos that when you are upto something it really makes you unsettled until you finally do it. For next why dont you add 512GB storage to you modified iphone 7. It will not only enhance the storage but will give you higher scores in performance benchmarks as well. Just for the record 512gb will only be working for iphone 7 and 7 plus.

The best word to describe what you're doing is "mod" (short for modify). Not "hack". Modding is when you physically alter something to achieve a function or goal that would otherwise not be possible in it's original form. A "hack" is when you intentionally cheat an existing system without altering it to achieve a desired result that is otherwise not "supposed" to occur. So his product is a Mod, not a Hack.

Hello, I have an idea for you, if you Know Redmi Note 5, a lot of people like this smartphone, but practically the only problem of this smartphone is that it doesn`t have a USB type C conector, so why not to change the micro USB conector to a USB type C conector??

the outcome i got from this video is: takes ages to a considered "smart" western guy do a job that average chine guy does everyday
Liquid cooling in iPhone!! Especially the plus models
i like this videos but most of them just show people things that they will buy assembled.... because you have rather two options 1- you live in a place where there is someone to sell it done to you (probably just china) 2-you will never try it on your phone
Next challenge!!: Add a 120hz refresh rate display to any iPhone
he sounds like a typical sassy white girl during the 0:20 HAHA
You should get some sound absorbers so your voice doesn't echo so much around in your room.
I would wanna see it on a iPhone 4 ????
Hi Scotty I learnt a lot about the manufacturing know-how that the Chinese workers have to make an iPhone but I'm really curious to know if it is easy in China to create your own android phone or laptop ground up. Like is money all it takes to just throw in all the parts and make a good android phone?
Batery upgrade
If u live in China how do you get access to YOUTUBE? Or do u live in Taiwan?
Dude that was insane ‘ iPhone 7 on a whole crazy level. Much respect man

If you are affordable, could I ask something? My favorite iphone is 3GS, but it doesn't have any front camera. could you install the carmera in front of 3GS? If it's impossible, I'm gonna be okay. :)
Can you make reasonably priced good performance hackentosh?

Im sorry but the other guy did his job wtf, now its boring ????????????
you're an absolute unit if you think the whole apple android windows conversation is interesting at all, everything has it's place now, and because of that i tend to use all platforms. apple for convenience and workflow, android to test and develop apps, windows as a graphic workhorse. don't be one sided, be all sided. everything has a use

Yeke is a genius tho

How about running 2 iphone boards as a single op device like those dual socket motherboards.
Modders are always better than developers themselves whether if its a game or a phone or anything... ??
I absolutely love how the guy from the shop just casually opened up his phone to check out if wireless works, China is amazing ??
Is it possible to have led notification lights in any of the iphones like samsung or other brands have.

Good work getting on to the BBC! When i saw it, i was like... "I know that guy!!" Its weird the connection you feel you have with people on YouTube. Well done man.
you guys are genius !!!!
Scott just curious if you would be attempting to add a w1 chip to airpod clones. That would be quite a cool project
Convert lightning port to USB type c or micro, that would be interesting!!
All Designers to be employed in apple are in china
What’s the translator app you used with the guy who sold you the iPhone?
that is not hacking its called modding
You can really touch the techniques by your hands when visiting China, amazing video.
now that combined with the headphone jack... would be the ultimate iphone7
If possible.. Start doing some software and hardware modification.. By installing android on an iPhone x.. Replace the internals with pre-installed android rom.. It would be amazing :D
The classic YouTuber would split a video like that in multiple parts, but you don't and I REALLY appreciate that. They are like short documentaries.
The look the guy gives you at 2:48
thanks for the video! I like the way you edit your videos
I like how he adds his own commercial breaks in the video
Nice Job! Can someone give me the ID of the intro music pls, we can also hear at 5:25 I already try all the musics in the description but I can't find it...
why not try solder it
that look of 12 min 8 sec. LOL
I see in your video loctide 460 glue with a small needle. I'm looking for such a small needle, but I don't found this in the internet.
Does it fit to iPhone 6s/6s plus?
Pro Tip: Pass your local Apple store on the way to buy your Samsung

Just saw the interview with the BBC reporter. U r a legend man. Keep the videos coming they are never boring and inspirational. Proving that if u put your mind to difficult challenges they can be solved. Well done.
30:10 Feels like there is tension now. he he!
Can we order stuff from Yeke?
Well done on getting to 2nd most watched on BBC news
Would you be able to pay them to do it for you? I would be too worried about messing it up.
Sir you’re a legend sir
Congratulations on getting on BBC News UK for the iPhone headphone Jack.
Were can I get the glass conversion kit to got your the iPhone 7 but for a 6s ? Please lol someone link
Thank you for recording and showing your failures! It's awesome to see your perseverance! Looking forward to more of your can-do attitude and more videos with Strange Parts.
If you could micro solder those pads to the corresponding pins on the charger port connector pins it wouldn’t move and stop charging. Great idea though!
Your videos are awesome man keep up the good work. ???
This guy is like a more tech savy m13
FEEDBACK: Given the detail in the modification and what I understand about how the connection itself is made, I'm surprised that there isn't a pre-cut foam border that adheres to the top of the ribbon cable for the wireless charging module. If it were made of a dense enough foam at an appropriate height, it would fit around the female connector on the logic board to help with setting up alignment and, most importantly, KEEPING alignment while providing even distribution of force on the cable that wouldn't require distortion of the male connector itself to cause potential damage or eventual loss of connection.
I've seen this on Ebay for about a year or so now, it comes with housings with a glass back already installed
Maybe next step - Stereo speakers?
Did you check if the touch ID on the new phone works
Why is your mouth open for every thumbnail, makes me feel some type of way.

Amazing job. Im amazed about your enthusiasm, inquisitiveness and perseverance making all this stuff. Keep going and most important do not leave video making behind. Its exciting what are you doing. Greetings from Latvia! P.S. whats the audio name at 5:25 - 6:36 :)
Upgrade 4 4s LTE support
What app do you use to translate?
apple, holding tech back 20 years or more.

I love how he's such a smiling person. Even if i wasn't interrested by the content, i'd watch his videos just for his positive attitude :)
??!
next challenge: OLED Displaymod
China is going through a golden age. Can you imagine being a smart young man in China with access to cheap tooling components and intellectual property with barley any red tape! The US is a nanny State compared to them.
I love the modding and changing of a product you own
Man, you make me wanna fly to Shenzen to explore that market.. it's glorious
Finger scanner behind screen?
Ur a tech genius man.
That men it's a fucking Genius and he doesn't even know it
can't stand your face mate
This DIY spirit is worthy of praise, but I have used the iPhone 8 for almost a year and never used wireless charging. Because the current wireless charging is too slow.
apple could learn something here xD
Gotta be honest I kinda want to buy an Iphone just so I can learn and try to mod it like this... this is so amazing!
12:58 wtf 10:43 AM 8/28/2018
With all these modifications your doing, I'm surprised you haven't started your own phone company?
Next challenge: put together all your projects and create an iphone 7 with 128gb, 3.5mm jack, led logo and wireless charging!
Nice video! But what is that for Amp meter 33:40 ? That seems very complicated to install. My Motorola Nexus 6 have a broken MicroUSB connector but lucky enough it have wireless charging. I have been looking after a repair shop here in Malmö, Sweden that can fix it but no luck :/
Next challenge ad a 1080 ti to and a core i7
yeke's kung fu is greater than your ninja moves, it seems. ha ha ha!

Question : do you live in (i’m guessing) China?
The thing I really love about Scotty: He genuinely sounds excited to make videos. None of that "OH MY GOD GUYS" rubbish. Legitimate excitement. The key to YouTube. 00:30
All this work when you could have just said siri add wireless charging to my iPhone.
Another amazing and entertaining video. So much brain power in this video. When biohacking becomes a thing, I know you'll be first ??
Scotty install USB-C With Fast charging !
Where do you get your lightning connector wireless charging pad?
i wouldn't be surprised if this channel was secretly paid by the chinese tourism board or something like that, theres always lots of stuff showing off china
00:00 Have to speak like Yoda to get the most accurate translation.
You like technology but you don't have a Samsung..
Damn Those B-Rolls!
How about the headphone jack and the wireless charging in a iphone 7???
In China we call these ?????? (Huaqiangbei sorcery)
Maybe you can ask yeke to integrate the design into the ribbon cable or presoldered onto the ribbon cable, so that when we add that to our phone we just replace the whole ribbon cable wireless thing, which I think will not require that much technique to install. This is just my suggestion, hope it helps.
Add a SD card slot to any iPhone :)
8:46 "Lightning jack" 12:06 AM (yep) 8/28/2018
5:25 Why did I watch a minute and then second (70 seconds) long time-lapse montage of an iPhone being disassembled again?... 11:47 PM 8/27/2018
You should've worn a pair of rubber gloves.
This camera makes your head look really really big
WHAT THE HELL !!!! WHY ARE THEY MOVING SO FAST WITH TECHS!!! USA YOU ARE BEHIND !!!!
That guy responded: "Wow! Cool" Unless he is also an English speaker, how did he do that?
Ingenius. Scary to think of what Yeke could do with an engineering degree!
you actually the coolest!!!!!!!
I was replacing my wifes iphone screen when the phone started to get extremely hot, i managed to dc the screen from The battery when I noticed that a scree from the screen had pierced the battery. I was so worried it would blow up I ended up just chucking it in the bin. advice dont mess with electronics with batteries!
Chinese people are so cool ????????????
MORE FOREST, LESS BUSHES
How does it compare to a non wireless charging phone after an EMP?
These gentlemen are very clever. Apple should hire them.... :)
Incredible how comfortable the shop keepers are taking apart these phones and putting them back together. Very cool
You should make THE ultimate iPhone 7, headphone jack+wireless charging.
Please tell me the name of the song
Next chapter. A bigger battery capacity

iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charger
Could you try and add the iPhone 7 home button to the iPhone 6s? I like the feel but don’t want to pay for the upgrade. Thanks!
I love this video. Such a neat little project, and I love the way you edit. I’ve done a few repairs on my own iPhones over the years but nothing on this level. I have some fun working on my 15-year-old BMW, fitting subtle features that appear “stock” to the naked eye but make it a little more bespoke and personal to me. Kinda similar I guess. Keep up the great work!
Put Android on iPhone
next challenge getting outta china before they abduct any 1 thats not chinese for concentration camps

?????????
it is just so much fun and super interesting to watch you videos
20:55 what is the boiling water over the Buddah?? what does that do?
With my Samsung Galaxy s5 neo i only need to buy a different back plate. Actual smartphones are becoming every year more ... "stupid" for the use of basic functions (Apple Iphones in first places).
4:38 I wonder why he was pointing his phone away... 11:36 AM 8/27/2018
Get a plug in wireless pad that fits into your connector port and blam sorted ??

i‘ve made my own iphone6s wireless charging !Thank you! ???????iphone6s???????!???!
make IPhone with 2 sim cards
you should have used etched translucent glass.. it might look really awesome..
Seems like microsoldering the flex to the actual connector might be the most reliable way for those equipped to do it. Might give it a shot!
This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.
?????!
That's nice ??????????
I know that you wanna do these upgrades to the iPhone because of views and because its fun, I agree. but have you heard of Android Phones?
Wireless charging is garbage and inefficient anyway. People should just buy a decent charging cable, they'll save money and their phones will charge faster.
Next challenge: Install MicroSD Slot, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Wrong Way. for me personally I would love to see someone mod a way to add widgets to an iPhone home screen.
M O R E F O A M T A P E!!!!! But seriously great video, keep up the great work :)

honestly, being able to communicate with other people with different languages with a good working translator in your pocket, thats pretty amazing these days.
funny thing is my Galaxy s6 from 2015 has wireless charging. also nfc, a 1440p screen with 575ppi, Android 7, a heartbeat sensor, and fast charging, an octa core processor, 3gb of ram, a 3.5mm Jack and is factory gsm unlocked. yet this iPhone is no where near it. apple needs to step up their game
Try installing the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone X. It's hard to get it working both software and hardware wise, but I'm confident you can do it.
next is, do it all you did to your current iphone project to 1st gen iphone. see if they still have it...
and next chalenge intaling fingerprint on under screen...
can u instaling dual camera, on your iphone?
you know there are usb pads that have a pass through right they plug into the charging port and stick onto the phone like a sticker and if they have a pass though they allow the standard cord to be plugged in also
he is so HOT
how many phones do you have, if I may ask?
Excuse me!!! I have a question? You have iPhone 6s Wireless Charging Kit? Thanks
is it safe to use?
Thanks for sharing this man! Always looking forward for your videos.
Finally...??
iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging... And bright apple logo, That would be sick !!
hello since a long time I have been following your channel and the truth I congratulate you for your achievements and you have inspired not to give up thanks
What a nice video,You are an inspiration !
Can someone tell me what app he used at the begging of the video to translate via voice ?? Thanks !!
An Engineery Student Over here, Greetings From El Salvador!! I like your vids man xD
This is a Cyberpunk dystopian world just embrace it
Next up: Remove the wireless charging from iPhone 8
could you hot air rework it so to just predominantly attach the wireless charger to that socket?
13:36 what's the music?
i want one for 6
great videos! worth the waiting
The red and black is pretty slick looking.
next project : install ios on an android phone
This guy is the perfect mix between Tavarish and Cody's Lab
Your dedication and persistance is just unbelievable. The help and pacience that Yeke has given to you is awsome.
What translator do you use?
Lol I got a wireless charger commercial ??????
Get you a samsung note 9 ,stupid iphone phones makes you crazy
this mufugga lookin like 2000s justin timberlake been on a fastfood benge
Next challenge: wireless charging, light up logo, headphone jack and usb type c on an iphone 7
I generally don't like or have any interest what so ever in apple products, but the head first diy approach you have in these add-ons, mids, and hacks on these products is amazing.Those Shen Zehn markets are definitely something I would like to see some day .
What about a double sided connector? So you don't have that pressure problem. One connector on the top, and one at the bottom of the wireless flex-print. But eventually the metal plate doesn't fit anymore...
Would the connector method work to add headphone jack?
What would be soooooo cool is if you made an iPhone X but without the notch, I'd rather have no Face ID and no notch!
Now make an iPhone 7 with wireless charging AND a headphone jack AND USB-C AND an OLED screen :D
Initial guess is that the pcb paths or connection tabs can not/ are not made thick enough to easily carry a full charging current.
Please do a iPhone 4 with Wireless charging
Dont need to attach a wireless adapter when you have one already on a samsung
Might not be a bad idea to send a kit to Louis Rossmann and see how well he fares at installing it. He is definitely experienced and would be a good measure of the difficulty.
I made my phone wireless for 1,50 euro
I want to see dual sim iphone but i think that might be impossible . because of software as well .....!
Is't possible to install the camera of an iPhone 7 P on a normal iPhone 7?
I would to see you make a normal iphone 7 into a completely waterproof iphone (ip68)
But they actually have that now on the iPhone 8 and 10
What's that green sign on all of the steps of the stairs say?
Very interesting video I’m so glad it popped up in my recommendation makes me want to start modifying my iPhone but I’ll probably wait until I can afford another iPhone just Incase I screw up ??
or you know just buy a driod because their not 4 years behind in phone tech like apple
Hey here is an idea: You have heard of the apple watch, now on this watch is what they call a "secret" port, it is not secret any more because a lot of people know about it. I also saw iBus tools online, what can you actually do with this port? Might be interesting to find out if it has some sort of backdoor option.
This guy makes iPhone feel like cheap smartphones only it's not. Great video as always.
Love the content you're putting up, always great editing & I love that you even have some b-roll! Also you're not far from 1M 0_0
Why not Bootcamp?
That's one hell of bloody iPhone ????
i love what you do and all of that, but sometimes things can get pricey. How can i do something similar to what you do, have lots of room of doing whatever i want and most importantly being cheap enough so that if you fail or break something you wont lose $100?
Challange : put a laser beam near led flash light.
Really cool vid as always ! I wish i lived in china so i could go to those markets and just buy random stuff and frankenstein my phone and other stuff ;) Keep up the great work and great vids! Edit: i just bought a htc one m9... i know i'm late in the game, but it has infrared beam on the top to use as a remote... Is that something you can do on an iphone? I've seen those infrared jack (3.5mm) plugs that can turn your "average" phone into a remote. You can get them for iphones also. Iphone with 3.5 jack, wireless charging, and infrared? hehehe
Or get an android... just sayin. Seriously though I enjoy watching your vids.
iPhone 6s please! i need it badly.
The video stabilisation on this makes me sick
39 minutes... Completely worth it, so hard to see such quality content here on YT! What I most like is that you don't simply show what you did but also the effort you put into making that work, and that's amazing :D
For someone who has lived in China for a while, your Chinese sucks!
Why not tin the pads on the charger? And worst case, couldn't you just precisely heat the flex with an SMT soldering iron and eliminate the pressure fit issue altogether? Just my two cents.
is that 5w wireless charge or 10w?
Watching this, i was thinking, why bother installing wireless charging on such old phones? then i noticed ONLY the latest iPhones have wireless charging, while my Samsung Galaxy S6 had wireless charging back in 2015! Apple really is late to the game on some stuff... Good video however!
Scotty: Okay. So, Uhm, I'm here with Chinese Guy: Yea Scotty: And you have seen my videos before? Chinese Guy: Yea Scotty: So, you only speak a little bit of english? Chinese Guy: Yea
Apple will invent this technology on their next flagship
I cringed when you cut your finger....
Strange parts is a sell out he makes ads about how asia has everything
I wish you worked for Apple. Our phones would have all the cool shit androids do if that was the case.
Meanwhile at the Apple HQ: Guys!!.... He is at it again!!
There is only one thing left... user-replaceable 3rd-party battery, will need new back design and a sturdy redesign of the cavity where the battery lives... will also need a warehouse full of batteries coz I would guess demand would be huge (especially after "performance-gate")
It's not a proper electronics project until you slice or burn yourself somehow.
That guy is great! and cute
That guy was on spot! Thanks for all the time you put into the videos
Wow tried this and broke my iPhone X... thanks d bag
IPad the next time
Awsome! Next, you should try: make Airpods using Earpods. No one done this before.
Can you get a PS4 Pro in there?
Uh that’s a iPhone six not seven it’s rose gold ???????
My iphone 6s Plus mic doesnt work on video calls (fb messenger, imo etc)....it works normally on regular calls....any idea anyone how to solve this issue
So many spudgers
Awesome project! Well done!!
This is so cool! You have to replace an iPhone screen into an OLED display for the next video. Goodluck!
Yeke is very nice. If someone was on Yeke place, he may not be willing to share every details with you.
Please please: Install Custom Android Rom on iPhone!
Please please: Install Custom Android Rom on iPhone!
Next Challenge: Add 5000mah battery into an iphone.
5:25 Music? Anyone??
Next project make a iphone with graphics card
from a chinese person... whenever they whip out a calculator they are just typing bs trying to look the part and charging you extra
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO DID IT PROPERLY! None of that external charging pad that plugs into the lighting port BS.
Watching you is better than watching movies, thank you for this adventure.
AWESOME as always.
Love it please sell a 6s version
Does this guy live in China
Awesome work, I'm pretty impressed especially Head phone jack(3.5) install video.
Next challenge: coffee iPhone
WHERE IS YOUR TV ? :D :D
whats the point of the iPhone 7 headphone jack if you can not charge and listen music with headphones at the same time so can you make both work at the same time
Its weird how the apple company didnt banned your channel
epic
NEXT CHALLENGE PUT NFC ON A PHONE
The stabilization is fucked up; buy a gimbal Scotty.
Would have loved to see this done to a IPhone 4 ????
That is awesome man inprsove
uh just buy an iPhone 8 or above and get wireless charging lol
This one of the best video so far.
You took this phone apart and then rebuilt it from scratch. You have the patience of an old Chinese man. I cannot believe that you have also the patience to wait until you're rested again
32:51 D E M O N E T I Z E D
another great video..keep posting..and God bless you..
Iris Scanner in Iphone 7
???????? ?H??G??G ?? ??Ð?????? (??????G) ??Ð ???? 5G ?? ???? ? ???? ?? ??Ð?????? (??????G) H?? ???? H???? ??? ???? ß? ?? 5-10 ???. ?H?? ???? ß????? ??? ?????Ð.
Please do a battery upgrade on an iPhone
I just buy a $15 magnetic case + wireless charging pad for my iphone 7. Problem solved
Question really is how much will you ask for if we send you are phones to do it with parts or pay for parts
Wow
some one is going to get rich
?????
Why not solder the wireless charging cable to the flex connector?
What app was used so you could speak to each other?
When your an Apple fan boy but the features is not enough.
Did you check if your e-compass still works after the rework? my experience in doing that with an external flex plugged on a Note4 was that the solenoid was perturbating the hall effect sensor and the e-compass so the phone was locked like the flip cover was on and the e-compass was just lost.
He did impossible things
It's back packer in china and In Philippines we call that buy and sell, ??
Next challenge: Buy micro-soldering tools and stop pushing stuff in with your fingers!
Yea.
Can you do the same for the Pixel 2XL
Ever heard of the palm pre? You could prob buy just the wireless charging back cover and steal the internals from that
???
You're awesome. What you do here it's so inspiring. The interview was really good. I believe all this effort is really worth it. Congrats!
hey, bro, you should take a bath & change your clothes if you want your work done quickly because by bathing & changing your clothes the body becomes clean and the mind becomes fresh..Lol.Good Job very inspiration not because you rarely bathe & don't change clothes but Make wireless charging to iphone...hahahahha
Ok I will subscribe because it looks like you have some interesting content but I am not a fan of the iPhone maybe you could tackle some other phones.
This channel has gotten me bitten by the tech bug. I want to start modding and working on my own tech now.
I'd enjoy older iphones honestly. Like the 4 or 5.
Ha I like you make a video about to change on iPhone 6s or 7 plus lightning port to type c and increase the RAM to the max 4 GB or 8 GB Ram and increased the storage max 512 GB
hi bro
16:09 What kind of precision screwdrivers are those? They look more comfortable than the ifixit driver.
@Strange Parts can you try putting iPhone 7 battery in iPhone 6s
70 dollars -.- lol
Pls more ads
You rock Scotty!
Great video - Really like the look of the screwdrivers you are using too
PLEASE DO THIS WITH AN IPHONE 4
Been so long since you posted I thought maybe the Chinese caught and ate you.
Wish i was patience as you are
This is awesome, but at the same time I'd never attempt it. Hope the target audience for these do well with it though, I've owned 3 wireless capable phones and they are mad cool :)
I dont even like iOS devices but your videos are always very interesting
Haha all the people in the background when he's vlogging look confused
Next Try to Install 2080 Ti . For more smooth graphics .
Just buy a better phone iDiot
I love these long videos,keep up the good work
make things easy... design a charge port that has wireless charging module pre soldered onto it no issues with lining up things and can use the line from cable without having to use legs on fpc connector Simple
NFC possibility?
Please do a video on your perfect jailbroken iPhone.
Install Android on it!
U deserve ALOT more subscribers!
Your videos just keep getting better and better! ??
Yeke is a cool dude tbh
Maybe try putting the wireless charging on the back on the lighting port? Like where the pins come into the phone connect it there instead of the flex cable jack or make a lighting port with the wireless charging already installed, or make a flex cable and have the wireless charging connected to it so you dont have to worry about aligning it properly
22:29 is that Dj Sona ?
Dang that chick was hella rough with those Flex cables they very fragile
What tools do you use because you do a lot of iPhone stuff and you always have good tools
Your videos are always edited hella good !! They always look hella smooth
is amazing
Say anything 'bout the Chinese, the fact is, they are tech junkies, blows Japan out of the waters. Japan is slipping behind...
Why u don't try to turn an iPhone 7 into iPhone x
Try to put it into a iphone 8 back housing
That was my main concern. How reliable a pressure fit mechanical conenction would hold up over time. A few drops and bumps could easily sever the connection between native flex and aftermarket flex. What would make this hack more robust would be soldered connections. However, the DIY difficulty factor increases an order of magnitude greater than that of a simple press fit connection.
I don’t know why people dislike video! Can any of the 250 people explain to me?
Can you please make different facial expression on next video preview?
This video is so cool I got goosebumps watching it. Yeke's a genius
add another sim card in iPhone 7
there will be blood
I worked at asus for a few years all my chinese friends gave me shit about my big hands , im guessing people give him a bit of shit too lol, never really had any issues but it was always funny
how about 2x battery ? put 2battery on your phone with new THICC coustom case
Dual cam in iphone 6 pls
With how how much it would cost to get a plane ticket to China to get wireless charging I could just get a new phone with it
What an intelligent humble young man. I have been to China on business so many times. Yeke sort of reminds me of the smart and hard-working people that I met during that time. They've got great potential in many ways and they do deserve more resources.
You make awesome vids!
It would be cool if he did an iPhone 6S with the headphone jack and change the lighting cable with usb c then add wireless charging
I absolutely love these videos. Not only do you get to see the tech parts, but you also get a look into the Chinese culture.
New apartment? Since kinda clean
I hope videos like these keep that arrogant asshat Phil Schiller up at night.
this looks terrifying
Awesome video as always, love to see those clever Chinese people. Would love to see more videos, maybe build your own 3d printer from parts from the market kept up the good work and cant wait to see what you do next..
a melody beginning in 5:25 ?please
i love your bag. can you tell me brandname ?
Update 2 camera iphone 6s
Can you put a DSLR camera on an iPhone ?
china number one!
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Next: Adding in-display fingerprint scanner
Next up: How we added Face ID to an iPhone - in China
What does the strange parts logo represent? It looks like the Bluetooth logo.
We need a video on how to get the Apple Pencil to work with an iPad Air 2. I shouldn’t have to upgrade when I already own both just because Apple wants money. Have I not give them ENOUGH!
change camera
Please ask your friend to try and design one for the oneplus 6
You are using Gimbal while vlogging??
No risk of changing the antenna RF field with a non-metallic backside? I am thinking of the SAR value and the certification for that.
kirim ke indonesia,,,saya mau satu yang seperti itu... ??
Name of music
this guy is so canadian
dude stop popping on my recommendation list .... I hate iphone, it's a stupid company with stupid OS and rips consumer's cash. good for this guy who manages to fuck around apple's brainwash but we non apple user are way ahead of monkeys just learning to walk.
Next challenge - add infra red to control home appliances
my social anxiety gets worse and worse the more I watch you walking with a selfie stick in China, all those people turning their heads around
Can you it be done to an iphone 6s?
You look like Chris Pratt man, xD
next challenge: Frontal fash
Great video! How about adding all the modifications you have done until now plus a few future ones into one single device as a "final" challenge? ;)
Greetings from Norway!
You are a programmer right Did you try to create Custom frameware for iPhone it will be Awesome like LineageOS for android
I always wonder what if you put a iphone 6s screen into a iphone 6 will it support the 3d touch?
Should of do that on the one that you add headphone jack
You are a genius
The Chinese, the ultimate in Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
I life in the netherlands and i am a begginer in slodering and rebbaling stuf so my question is Where can i find icloud blocked motherboards for learning greatings from riccardo
You can also buy a kidney or a liver in China
You have a lot of money, why not just buy an iPhone X? These DIY thing is for the poor!
Start @ 37 min
Hey there As I see that the cable just touched together without welding So if you drop your phone much times.Will it still connect together tightly?
why is the title saying "we" added wireless... who is we?
I understand nothing at all but , have no idea why still watchin this vid.
Can you make your own galaxy s8 phone
Omg ur amazing
That seems like an induction coil type issue. Try plugging in a really short cable and see what happens. i.e cut it really short. Then cut the cable off completely and test again just with the plug. That should help tell you whether its the plug or the cable length that is effecting charging.
Very cool, but can you make an iPhone with a Snapdragon 845? :D
Put a headphone jack in it
I love it, you are creating awesome videos each time!
Every time Strange Parts makes a video about an Iphone - Apple cringes. Between the headphone jack and this - this really shows how much they slack. It's one thing for the OneMinus 6 to be a sad, little toy that has nothing going for it, it could make the phone less useful, more expensive and yet save on wireless charging... But it's a totally different when you shit costs 800$+.
Never liked the Iphone bud still i love your videos
I want to see if you can add a notch to iPhone 7 and battery capacity
wow this is so cool....
Next replace the LCD panel with AMOLED planel
Next challenge: Add flexing audio and touch ICs to a samsung!
Add a damm back button like android phones please
Here is a challenge... user replaceable batteries.
When you think you've added enough pve foam, add more foam. Great work man. Keep up the learning.
Amazing, Good Sir... Which app is used for live translation Chinese to English in interview
Ive watched a buzzillion screen protectors being installed and cant do it. Needs asian fingers! ~ Im naming it the REDBACK SPIDER
In China tea in Australia beer ??
I love your passion for this.
Louis Rossmann anybody?!
How about charging efficency?
Just wanted to say thank you so much for making these videos. They show a really cool perspective on China that I honestly find inspiring. It’s almost like how Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown want really entirely about the food, it was about using food as a gateway to learning more about different cultures. I also really enjoy how honest and humble you seem, and how respectful you are to everyone you interact with.
Make the ultimate iphone 7!
Please add an usb c
i bet someday apple will pay a significant amount of money someday to hire you !!!!
Next challenge: adding a headphone jack to the wireless charging iphone 7
Next challenge is dual Sim card in a iPhone if it's possible
I think you put too many promotions on that video
Next video you should add an spen like product to the iPhone and have it slide in.
He went the Wong way
You're a really respectful guy. It makes the whole experience a lot more interesting to watch. I'm subscribing right now.
Your video was very educational and informative. However you make me appreciate my Note 8, with all the functionality you've had to add to your iphone, you still fall far short on the features you can get on a Note 8. You will always have the last laugh however because you have nearly 900k subs, that certainly pays off in the end.
wow,it's really cool things! Respect
You translate your message and show off the translated message to the Chinese guy and his response was "wow... cool..." the Chinese guy has translator built in his throat... wow... cool... jk :))
Some excellent music choices
This video is another interesting by adding wireless charger in iphone wow
your debuging skill is really impressing
Never understood wireless charging. Why use it if you have the pad to put it on. It's the same way stationary like a cable.
Another amazing video! ???? Love your content mate, it's relaxing to watch.
A sd card reader would be cool I feel that is the one thing iphones are missing
Just buy an Android phone = 1000000x easier
I think it would awesome to make one for an iphone 5c because it already has a plastic body.
This was so much more than I was expecting!! such a great video thank you :):)
Haung Wei (sorry for misspelling your name bro!) is super nice man!
2013: niggas I built my own PC 2019: Built my own Iphone
Good job!
i put wireless charging in my DS. thats how cool i am
id love to meet you, i litterally love your smile it makes me really happy! gettin them positive vibes when you smile and i love your vid and u just recived a new sub because u deserve it, #gettingTo1000000subs
It still amazes me how professional these guys are sometimes. The fact that they're picking apart iPhones, and even using their own for testing, just shows how much of a second nature this job is for them.
This man is motivating me to go to china ??
I don't know how to do DIY iphone wireless charger.
Yeah
Try Charge with Some Case.
It's just an IPhone, leave it, forget it, go forward, let's improve, dare to live... seriously, you are much more than this. Millions will hate me for this comment, they also will improve, just a little bit later. I am patient.
Love these videos!
Next challenge , Install 2 camaras in a iPhone 7
why don't you try learning chinese finally?
very good ..... now i wonder what will happen if we ditched the whole idea of forming the back of the phone from glass nor aluminium either and bulid it from copper what will happen ... this will give us a unibody and hard one two ... also don't forgot the wireless charging capability
bruh you want 70 dollars for that kit wtf
I'm so happy that you had upload a new video!
Nicely done!
u r amazing duuude <3
Relying on solder pads touching a flex PCB isn't super smart, it's super flaky when it comes to long term reliability.
Another great video, thanks for sharing your efforts and the local scene. I love seeing the locals and the local markets, streets.
Hello Strange Parts, I love you sooo muchh <3 I am yours biggest fan, Greetings from Czech Republic
i love this and really want to do it, will the kit work on an iPhone 6s?
R u Magneto ? ... by #ambedkartist
Another classic Strange Parts video! Love your style as as well as the cultural aspects you always include!
Do you have the link of the QR code - the video you watched?
Lets do this tomorrow ... Goes to the market? That's a fun way to pass time I guess! :-P
I bet it would be nearly impossible, but my mind keeps imagining an iPhone 7 with wireless charging, a backlit Strange Parts logo and a headphone jack.
very nice editing during the building/taking apart of phones!!
This is over-rated, only a wireless pad was added to the USB connection. So this ain't magic. Such 'hacks' was always existing. He just added the glass back. From chinese standards this is pretty ordinary stuff.
Really loving these videos - thanks! I'm not even an Apple fan (more an Android user myself) but these things are fascinating, and I love the approach you take, showing us your struggles each step of the way. Keep up the good work :)
icloud lock removal if possible
wtf is with the random cut to buda being burned by hot water
How to talk to people in China if they do not know English: I just talk Chinese
Would the SE ever get this?
apple needs to hire Scotty already...
Apple, take notes.
I'd definitely be interested in a 6s (or 6s plus) version of this kit. Hopefully your store does well and you can expand soon!
We were supposed to have instant translation to have face to face conversation like nothing was in between.. Instead we have some electronic voice activated dictionary.. Future sucks..
This might sound crazy, but if possible can u make an expandable memory slot like samsung had ?
awesome!
Chinese people seem amazing.
i am vietnamese . B?i vì tôi ko nói t?t ti?ng anh nhung r?t thích xem video c?a anh . Anh có th? ch? type c cho iphone du?c không ???
Can it working with ip 5s?
You can buy this wireless charging flex cable off Aliexpress and it is relatively cheap
Oh boy I am in Shenzhen my self I have watch all your videos from Miami Florida and took the adventure to here
I thought that that guy was Mike Chen. Rotfl
hey, can you do project on android phone, like building it from scratch
?D?o?r?a? ?t?h?e? ?e?x?p?l?o?r?e?r?
Next vid: face id
you should make your own smart phone bro.. and I will buy it for sure.. hehheee..
next project: install stock android
I have never had to watch/skip so many ads on a video before, it made watching this so painful! :-(
You.are.awesome.
Apple is CRAP.... Buy a real phone, with wireless installed from new, ANDROID! ??
Totaling inspiring dude!!!! I dig it all because i a;ways wanted to do stuff like u do. Keep it upllll Following 4 lifel Thanks for sharing...
?????
Apple's managers should see this video and give resignations
So, how much is a refurbished iPhone X? And, can you buy refurbished gaming laptops?
How do you post on YouTube in China? Or do you go back to ur country to post?
waterproof iphone 6 or iphone 7
all these days you spend on that will NEVER compensate the hundrets and thousends of times you would spend by just connecting the normal charging cable.
Great videos, you make me want to visit Shenzhen again. I walked around the markets 10 years ago when I lived in Hong Kong.
Dam I would like the mod that makes my phone a disco @ 22:29
I can also buy an iphone 8 red that can do the same things, but everyone is free to do what he wants.
I think it is important to add Vietnamese subtitles to each of your videos because Vietnamese people watch his videos a lot
You have to get USB-C working on an iPhone.
IPhones are trash
I hope you may try to assemble samsung phone especially the s and note series
What is that translator
my iphone has wireless charging :/
Apple should offer him a job
the notch need to die
If they make that in Apple, it would be called as the "iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED Strange Parts edition".
Next challenge: replace ios with android!
Not not note
My YouTube channel
To note ti i am sorry but it corrects the words automatically
Con i react ti your YouTube video i ment.
Con i react to YouTube YouTube video to post it in mine?
I would love to be able to add that feature to my new iPhone 5S build but I guess it's a phone too old to be even supported by these kind of things, anyway, thanks for the great video!
Try installing a 1400p screen onto an iPhone.
Combine all the different iPhone mods on to one, ultimate iPhone.
What!? No audio jack? I'm disappointed in you Scotty :(
can we get this for android phones with usb-c?
Next u should install USB C
Collab with Zack from JerryRig and do something on an Android Phone?
Waiting for a long time for your video.
Yes another one
It gave me chills and I’m smiling almost 30mins total! This is by far your most amazing video! It really is amazing to look at DIYers exchanging their techniques and project. And that custom glass back with your logo is dope??????
OMG, I'm so glad I found this video!! FANTASTIC!
"I really want to do that" wait I've got an iPhone X ...
definitely no DIY for me, I admire your perseverance!
Wow, really great video/project. I wonder if it's possible to make a iPhone SE 2 with the same size as the SE, but with a iPhone X screen or updated specs like the iPhone 8 or X in China.
Amazing video... apple should view this. And apple should decrease the price.
You seem really nice and funny I love your vids keep it up don’t let anyone ruin your career
impressive
I have a plan of buying iphone 8 plus 256gb from China in the month of Oct... (BTW i am from India) after i saw this video that no one has ever done...I have an insteresting question... is it Possible to add a wireless Charging kit to an iphone 6s....just like u did on iphone 7 and 7 plus... If yes then i would really want it on iphone 6s 128gb... i really want it in iphone 6s cause it still have a Headphone jack and can record 4k Video that is why i still love Iphone 6s..
Scotty, do you realize that you are basically turning the iPhone into an Android phone?
Why don't you speak Chinese ? You've been there for a long time it seems, that's the least you can do when living in another country and not your native one (it's difficult blabla I know don't care, its work thats it). Still enjoyed your video
You upped your game! Video editing and phone hacking! Nice job!!! Love your work! You should learn more chinese, to better get involved in the community!
Is it possible to install a bigger screen on an older phone like the iPhone 5s?
Be careful, the Chinese government has proof you bought a phone off the books.
Try making the iPhone 7 all screen front and back!
Aaaah a new 40 minute strange parts video
usb c iPhone
Hi ! Great video !! Which translater did you use please ? Thanks and keep it up !
WHAT'S UP WITH ALL THE COMMERCIALS!!!! YOU HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, WHY NOW!!!!
All these people looking at the camera like: Is that guy crazy?
Fake the first and Second guys are the same
Long time no see. I have to say that your disassembling and recording skills have been increased so much. Keep making good stuffs bro!
Hello,can you post your video on bilibili?Your channel on bilibili hasn't been updated for a long time.??You know, most of us can't directly access YouTube in China.Thank you.??
U didnt screw the bottom screws so that might not put enough pressure?
Just saved myself loads of money just swapping my iPhone 7 housing with an iPhone 8y looking one, idk if I wanna take apart my phone again just yet though but this is cool ;d
14:53 for all the shit we (United States) give China for ripping off patents and reproducing at low-cost, expensive technology, they seriously know what they're doing. Man broke out his personal phone to test out a component. Guy knows his shit!
As awesome as this is, I got a weird sense of a coming cyberpunk dystopia at the end...
13:29 I literally said out loud "WELP." LOVE these videos! Big loves from the ol' US.
Pixel 2 headphone jack would be an interesting video
How well does it charge through a case?
"time to take this thing apart"......and completely blow me away. super slick skills brotha. much love and respect.
Is this available for 6s if so can I have a link
you can see the alignment that piggy backs on the connector needs to be "really" accurate!! mis-align it you "screw up" your phone ! NOT FOR NOOBS... p.s. (I'm sure he could do it in one go, but he 'acts' as a noob for you guys! ;D)
Love your videos...
Anyone think that the white home button on black screen would look better? Also, he wouldn't have to replace the logic board
Quality content. 39 minutes is pretty long for a youtube vid but you showed me how you love what you do and its one of the reasons why I glued in watching the whole vid. Really interesting and very educational. Keep up the good work.
Upgrading the memory on an android or samsung phone (without a SD card). Specially a 8gb or 16gb phone for example or even an old 2gb phone/upgrade. That would be cool to see too.
@9:07 LOL fanboy mode
I have i will made my own iphone i like you
Honestly just get yourself a Samsung and you can plug your earphones in while you're cordless charging!
Cool project! What kind of camera rig are you using? Everyone on the streets is looking at you like you're a white guy in China. :)
I always in joy watching your videos..
Man after the video of the headphone jack, I said what’s next with this guys, and you’ve managed to always come up with something amazing, I really love your job and ideas. Btw i recommend you as a next project to add Face ID to an iPhone 7 plus or 8 Plus. Please I’d love to see that. I mean Face ID with the TrueDepth Camera and the dots projector, everything taken from the iPhone X.
sick video as always. keep it up dude.
It's cool if you know how to do it if you don't then you just have to buy a device that already has it
can u show the location plz,im going to Hua Qiangbei right now
What good is this if you can't do it or you can't find someone that can do it it's called this buying a brand new iPhone 8 or whatever device you want Samsung LG that has wireless charging this is too complex to do
Would you be able to do this for me put the wireless charger on or do you want anybody that could do it I would had no way to do it it be too hard to do let me know respond to my comment if you can do it or I can send it out
No Beijing Bikinis in the b-roll, not the real china. Lmao. love the video, keep em coming. What I really love is how a rando chinese guy figured out how to make a wireless charge kit for iphones. I don't know if he copied it or adapted it or figured it out himself, no matter what, damn ingenious.
this is amazing wow
??. ?????. ?? ???, ?? ????? ?????.
Wow. Your videos are so chill. Love them. Would buy kit if I had iPhone but I am android user. Editing was great. Love how chill interview was with tea and everything. Was wondering when those red shelfs that were behind you are now? What is that blue thing you used to disassemble iPhone it looks cool? If there is another channel with same theme I would love to subscribe to them too.
Great video as always! Side question, are you moving? I see your tv and items from the corner nook are gone
????????
The Chinese man that sold you the phone seems really humble, not sure why lol
Would love to see this for an iPad!
Hay you should do a collaboration with Naomi Wu. She is a maker that lives, I think, in the same Chinese city as you do.
I exchanged home button of 2 iPhone 6 and ended up with both of them not working. When put them back on their original phone it started to work. Can any one help me sort this issue. The same happens to the camera,earpiece etc. Pls help.
Really exciting video. So enjoyable
Try converting lightning to usb charging.
These videos could be like 3 days long and I'm still watching him put something on his iPhone and ive never even owed an iPhone
That's so easy in China, a lot of stuff about wireless charging in taobao
23:20 In Brazil we call it "Gambiarra"
Next challenge... Order the Mophie Charge Force case for $50
try to upgrade them to A11 Bionic and put iPhone 8 camera on it
?????
amazing... slowly becoming a fan :) . Can you also make a video on how to make a wireless charger
Where place i can buy refurbished iphone working with cheaper price dude pm mee pless i want to buy
Who else noticed the world cup in the background in the interview
Less feet
Excellent videos as always. Love the effort that goes into your videos.
I have a 7 but I'm moving to a note 9 so sadly I shall skip for now
Indeed, everything is possible in China.
What I got from this video, just pay the Chinese guy to do it correctly the first time.
You should buy the enclosure to make the 7 look like an 8 with a glass back
This is so sick! It’d be awesome to do a phone build with as many of these upgrades as possible! Take a 7plus Do the 512gb memory, wireless charging, and a few extras, including the cool custom glass back and maybe change up the colours a bit. Green would look cool
Hi how about use iphone x screen to iphone 7. It really interesting.
Great new video!
So if you come to visit the U.S. do you feel like Apples Covert Goons ar following you??????
Pretty pointless since iphones have wireless charging already........
These videos are always awesome
??
next thing is to install a micro usb connector lol. I'm joking, install wireless charging on an iphone 4 or 4s then try to add an led kit for the apple logo on it so it lights up. Also i subscribed!
Scotty, your story line and the way this video is put together is getting better and better! I felt like i was watching a documentary on a tv network! Thanks for this amazing content.
I hope this works out for you.. and that Apple isn't going to be a jerk about this. We won the battle to repair our phones.. but I have no idea about modifications.
I would say those "MADE IN CHINA" are actually pretty well-made for its price.
I suggest you to try to make a non waterproof phone waterproof
Next: iPhoneX without notch.
why not invent a case that had this built in , and you just plug it into current usb
Is it possible to change the cpu to that from a new iPhone?
That editing when taking apart the iPhone 7 wow.. big step up in quality 10/10
Would it be possible to do this a on a OnePlus 6, the phone already has a glass back, but no wireless charging.
Next Challenge: Install Microwave + dishwasher
Hi, great video again again! I wonder if it is possible to fix the iPhone 7 home button, when it is broken?
This guy exploits Apple like it's a fun challenge for him, what a legend he is. So far he has added a headphone jack and wireless charging. I really hope he goes in for a USB C connection, if that's possible!!
Useless. Iphone already has it
Headphone Jack - check! Wireless Charging - check! Next challenge suggestion: notch removal I've been blown away by your technical (and not to mention people) skills! If you can remove the notch, it will be the crème de la crème! Since you're a programmer too, maybe you can come up with a hardware and software hack?
Try to make The iPhone That i want and it must have A headphone jack USB type C Face ID Wireless charging
MicroSD slot next.
It would be more reliable if the would sell the charge flex with the wireless module already solderd in.
CR7 minute 5
How samsung did it 5 years ago
WongWei or another, i'm gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha WongWei!
Try to wipe clean iOS and install android into iphone. I wonder if hardware could support it.
Awesome video!
lol just buy one of those external pad and hook it up via lighting xD (just a joke chill)
Great video, love that you are very open and honest about the pros and cons of this. Very interested in one for my 7plus if that ever happens.
Nice video
I like, that you can do a break, if something won’t work out - When I’m working on my old cameras, I’m often not able to do that and I’m stuck to my 100 year olds forever :) - great video again!!! Keep them coming!
I don't understand how modification kits like the wireless charger are profitable. I know people in the US aren't buying many, if any. I'd guess the same for Europe and Canada, and South America and Africa. So are Chinese really buying these kits themselves and taking the time to install them I enough numbers to provide a market?
Customize an iPhone X please
is there a website for buying parts to build your own smart phone?
by throwing that shit in the garbage and buying a super duper amazing samsung
You are insane!! JUST BUY AN ANDROID!! lol but I'm inspired by your mods, great vids
All that work for wireless charging...
I wish there was a go fund me for the kid to open a shop I'd support it and i know a lot of people would...
Change the touch id colour in the next video
Adding expandable memory would be a great thing to add to an iPhone also. Expandable memory, headphone jack, wireless charging, all the things Apple should be doing. I love Apple but they are getting stale.
do you have any solutions on how to fix a iphone 7 that has a boot loop and wont update or restore?
Shame it’s not Apple innovating and making the iPhone better, still lets see what they bring this September. I still don’t think they will wow me though. The only thing they always seem to improve for sure is the price.
Plz do this for an Huawei P20 Pro, its an amazing phone thats only held back by missing that feature, also has a plastic back on default, and because of the camera sticking out you could even get away with making it a little bit thicker with a new shape back to accommodate for that without making it really feel any bigger, ie: you could use like 80% the back for the charging pad rather then only half of it.
my samsung s3 has wireless charging, old shit
Yeh
Add fast charging to your iPhone 7
Cool
I wonder how many have sold so far
Because this is news related to Chinese science and technology culture. For the YouTube mobile client without automatic translation, I hope to add Chinese subtitles, no matter whether it is traditional Chinese or simplified Chinese. Of course, if you can introduce a stable, high-speed, reliable VPN or SS/SSR network provider that offers 180 RMB or less for viewers from China, it’s great. In this way, I/We can watch the Youtube web version that supports automatic translation under the strict network supervision and review of the People's Republic of China, instead of modifying the DNS and Hosts, which is difficult and even failing. Thank you very muck.
Basically: MOAR FOAM
On ios you can download testM app. It lets you to test iphones practicly automaticly.
very cool video
Great video again! Is there a way to get hold of the schematics? I'm really curious.
Nice edit! Very easy to watch!
Very good video !!! you just make them with iphones ? when you will try with android ?
Iphone x
You always have these good transitions using street food but you never buy the foood in video
Does anyone know the name of the songs specially the one when he is disassembling the iPhone 7, thanks
I think u should release video in part as many of us doesn't have that much time plus it will give u the excitment of viwers
Nice!
Woaahhh talk about patience...great vid
I liked the social interaction with the people. Usually a hacker is using social engineering on people. But you work very well with others. I love watching and learning from you.
so he put a jack he built a phone he should put usb type c and just for fun put android to
Haha flashbacks to any project: carefully bending a thing *THWACK*
Scottie, I love you dude but please, get a 4K camera "upgrade"... this isn't 2010 anymore. Thanks buddy.
its not really wireless charging really more cordless toothbrush technology induction lol
37:15 Is it from Yeke or You? You made it unclear because you said you bought 100 to sell to us.
I thought to myself why does he keep working only with Apple phones. Second later I realized all other phones already have these features built in Facepalm
Headphone jack kit PLEASE! Honestly, I think even if it was $100-$150 in parts costs alone to make something that didn't require so much modding as we law in the video you did on it, I think people would pay for it, because unlike wireless charging, or probably soon USB type - C support, which you can get by just spending more money on a newer iPhone, a headphone jack is likely something you'll never be able to get on a phone faster than the iPhone 6S which at this point is 3 years old...
I'm a software guy... and having a great time watching your videos. Plus Shenzhen is like Disneyland for Geeks for me
If Apple can't do it, then you won't be able to... After watching the video... ... ...
You are working harder than pewdiepie and rice gum combined. Credit to this guy
Answer bought an iPhone X and you have that
You make something beautiful! Thank you!
strange parts aka smart ppl. amazing achievement!
Hi, i'm wondering that is it possible for you to remake/restock the headphone jack circuit board for iphone 7
STOP BOTHER THIS POOR IPHONES OR I’ll CALL GREENPEACE WWF OR I DONT’KNOW.... IRONMAN!! P.S. you are awesome.
Translators of nowadays... WOW! I can bet in the future, learning a language is going to be more of a 'commodity' and not a necessity. :D
@ strange parts iphone sd slot!!!!
You could make a fortune selling custom modified iPhones... until Apple sue you for making counterfeit phones using legit parts.
i wan't you to make ultimate i phone 7
Wireless charging Iphone with a headphone jack light up logo annd you have to custom solder it all ??
Etch the glass with your design.
Collab with Zack from JerryRigEverything...plz
Wish u could give me dat custom made iPhone 7 with wireless charging to me... It will be my first iPhone??????
you should have shown that its charging more and more on the last minute rather than talking and talking. its like the journey got to a bad end because of your talk. This is a tip btw to improve your video
conan!
instered of placing the flexpcb below connector, make a pcb for charging port which has additional connection of connecting wireless charge on top of that.
I love your filming style!! When you show how you trade and all! And the music! It‘s really beautiful how you make this DIY videos in an artistic masterpiece!
Where can one purchase a work mat like that?
Man, can you do other phones too
This is really very clever how he has managed to make contact with the connectors! Thanks for the interview, i would like to see you meet more innvoators like yourself there in china! Those videos make me feel inspired!!
What can be done with an older smartphone? For say an IPhone 4? Would it be possible to make a "sleeper smartphone"? or even a two-screened Iphone? (one screen on each side
for how much did you buy that iphone 7 ?
Definitely amazing channel! Thanks for new video ??
Next chanllenge adding Apple pencil inside the Apple IPhone
Feel that I jinxed you when you were using that metal sheet to separate the glass, I was thinking "he's gonna cut himself". Next second, "ouch!"
Everythingapple pro...??????new project
collab with jerry rig everything
Combine headphone Jack and wireless charger
An idea: Soldering the wireless charger flex to the bottom connector flex instead of pressure contact. You'll need to redesign the wireless charger flex with contacts on both sides so you can solder it (microsoldering).
next video : in china we removed notch on iPhone x and installed android 8.0 (Oreo) on iPhone x ????
I love how you put little bits of b-roll between the main parts of the video! Makes the video even more enjoyable
Next chalenge youse iPhone x
Genial, excelente conteúdo e qualidade de produção no vídeo
you can already get aftermarket bottom flex cables, very cheap, why not make a bottom flex cable that has the wireless charging as part of the same flex?
Holy shit..this is so damn cool
I have become a fan of your videos. I come back from office and check out your videos. I am also an electronics engineer, although I do not do DIY stuffs. But watch you turn these phones into something totally different, is really satisfying. Kind of clears all the commotion going in the head. Please continue doing such stuff and keep us engaged. Thank you so much Sir.
888k subscribers! That's like damn auspicious in Chinese belief. En route to 1mil subs, well done Scotty!
is it me or anyone else also think that the reassembling of iphone was so satisfying.. or it was pure editing magic, ??
Next challenge: make an open source phone that we can 3d print
Just wondered if a slim layer of foam around the connector on the logic board to hold the wireless charging flex up against the charging dock connector flex plug would give a better connection without over stressing the plug onto the logic board, maybe even a custom cutout rectangular foam for this purpose ?
153 Apple developers disliked this video.
Great video , i can't see any advantage of wifi charging if you've got to still have the charger plugged in to a plug socket .
wouldn't the iphone 5c be the perfect phone for this kind of a hack?
I'm getting a black t-shirt that just says, "I void warranties..."
nice to meet you. I live in South Korea. I already see your third video. Your actions allow everyone to be addicted and challenged. When I wanted to give up sometime, I was impressed by the video that fitted your stereo jack. So I think it is a fight against time rather than giving up. So I really appreciate it. I wonder what the next video will be and I have another expectation. Once again I appreciate your respect for your actions and inspire countless geeks. PS I'm not good at English and I use Google Translator
This is awesome. Keep it up, Scotty!
Build ur own phone with custom android os
How do u feel about the restaurant in ur part of town using recycled sewage?
why not stack paper pieces rather than squeezy foam
You’ve mastered quality & quantity on the YouTube platform - every video an adventure and a triumph of perseverance over adversity. It wouldn’t surprise me if you managed to build an iPhone SE with a notch and FaceID if Apple doesn’t. Those guys from Shenzhen are just so ingenious!
David fighting A LOT OF goliaths , well done sr!
Love from India
INSTALL ANOTHER OS TO IT
The editing is getting much better
Install wireless changer on ip5s
Install wireless changer on ip5s
Can you please make an update video in the future like a few months ahead about the reliability of the wireless charging?
Next change :upgrade the capacity of the iPhone you know the low battery problem is so annoying ??
i wonder if you would install face id next time
Linus was not respectful to you. Shame on him, you are the guy!
I don't understand anything. BUT IT'S SO FUCKING COOL
Well because of trumps import tax you'll now need to go to china
Scotty, can you share a link to the Tool Brothers stuff if they're selling internationally? Also, which tools you'd recommend.
I'm not an apple fan, but Your videos only gets better. Amazing work!
you deserve way more suscribers, this is awesome
Try to add an OLED display to an iPhone in your next project/challenge!
Stop
I’d like to get a wireless receiver so I can try to put it on my 7 Plus..
I have to say I moved away from iPhone years ago and been a loyal Samsung user since. But I really enjoy watching the videos you do on hacking the iPhone and making your own mods to them. It's awesome to see the collaboration you have with the people you meet in China. Everyone seems so open to work with you and have some amazing ideas and hacks themselves. So many crazy talented people, including yourself. Thanks for what you do and inspiration you give people.
love the video keep it up
Yeah how about installing USB-C Instead of a Lightning jack
And you got yourself an iphone 8.
That's great I've now got a use for laser cutter I bought for thousands years ago on a whim. You have a lot of patience and trust that it would work.
16:34 do not plug out your cable like that your gonna break it plug it out on the plastic part
is a genius :0
will there be a chance whereby you will venture into andriod phone mod?
Why dont you try building an android phone It should be easier
Its amazing how popular this has become starting from adding the jack back. etc its so cool to see what you can actually do
Put "Old IPhones" in the title instead and maybe it will get more views?
First video: How to disassemble iphone This video: How to disassemble iphone like pro
????????????(Chinese???)
Hey I'm loving all the iPhone enthusiasm, but to be truly honest I don't use one and haven't for a while. I'm using a Huawei here in the U.S and I think it be cool to see you build other devices particularly Android devices and judging by your audience so would they!! Thanks man keep it up
Wow, are you really getting 1 Amp of charging current from the wireless charging module? That's impressive- i had assumed it would only do ~100 - 200mA trickle charging.
so pointless
can anyone share more details about yekke how to contact him
i watched all your videos. it's really inspire me . and i also works on HuaQiangBei , hopes could meet u someday..
august 22 is my birthday u made the phone at my birthday what a coincidence
Thank you for showing the failures and troubleshooting!
Since the iPhone X doesnt have a fingerprint scanner, turn the apple logo on the back into a scanner. That has always been my idea, apple logo fingerprint scanner on the back
You are awesome!!!!!
??????????????????(???????)??????YouTube?????,??????????!
Man start producing your own phones in large quantity
This is great Scotty! Finally, a wireless charging iphone! Awesome! here's another challenge for you Scotty, Oppo has released a mobile phone where you can fully charge you phone for 5 minutes. As I check out their website, it seems that their charger is giving an output of 4 amps instead of 1 amp. I don't know if its only with their charger and battery or needs another add on logic board for it.... and I want to see this also on your Iphone. :)
This Caucasian man is humble and secretly good at what he does. He listens carefully before opening his mouth. In this aspect he has very Chinese values and I really respect him
Your editor does a great job.
I want one for my PH-1
China: this is communist country pls stop making capitalist videos Strange parts: How we added wireless charging...
?????? ^?^,,,
add lightning port to iPhone 4s
Buy a samsung note 9.. Video Challenge ends in 2 minutes
I would be all over this if I didn't have an iPhone X...! I can't get enough of watching your videos and how you go through everything so methodically. You then show us your failures/upsets, but also the victories and explanations about what you did wrong. It's a different culture and an awesome area of the world that most of us will never have the pleasure of being in and you make us feel like we are there coming along for the shopping trips... Just as an aside - you should add more blueprint photos to your shop of other things so I can own a sweeeeet piece of Strange Parts to put on my wall! :)
hjust sayin. See thru back with rgb...
Scotty I think you'd make way more AdSense revenue if you split videos like this up into multiple parts! Would also be good as a viewer, 40-min videos are tough to watch all in 1 sitting and then you forget to pick it up again later. This is just a minor note though. Video is great, editing is great. I always love when new Strange Parts comes out :D
Great video, it's incredible what's available out there.
Are they guys playing DDR...dance dance revolutions at 34:13
?????? ???????
he sell that module for 7 dollar ? dang
Your works are good. But however, what you did is like turning an iPhone 7 into an iPhone 8
Honestly these videos have motivated me to want to go back to china and visit this crazy country one more time. Love the videos
Your channel fucking blew up bro. GOOD JOB MAN. That had work definitely paid off. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THESE FOR US THAT REALLY LOVE THE VIDEOS.
In India we call it Jugaad ??
I’ve heard explanations, but why is the accessibility button so popular in China? One reason I’ve heard is there is a fear the button can wear out. It was turned on in this video which features an iPhone 7 which doesn’t have a mechanical button.
The video quality is getting better and better!
Literally turning into an android phone
it is possibe to more "DIY" part in one device? ex: adding a wireless charging, led blink when music turn on and, a headphone jack on one device??
not goner end well like the dreaded apple logo light mod from back in the day for the 4s or 4 cool idea but they need a better design then just foam
this method just looks smart, but connection is not reliable, someone needs to improve it obviously.
Try make the custom Android phone...??
Grand master Scotty
If you could sell it for iPhone 6 or iPhone 6sPlus i'll buy a few and test them out. Maybe I'm able to combinate this with a glowing Logo... Could you try to make a glowing powerbutton wich only lights up when the screen is turned off? That's too complicated for me... Don't know how i could do this...
240p squad!
Why so much problematic. Why cant it be just plug and play. I do not understand the problem, was that the design of wireless coil pcb or connector. Please explain.
Hi could i ask for 1 ip with modding by you?
why go through all this trouble? the adapter looked to only make contact with like 4 or so of the mounting legs of the connector, you could just solder those few connections to it joining those parts before normally connecting them. in fact that should be done anyways! given its for power/charging that light pressure point problem could become high resistance and cause a variety of issues or heating. its neat but it should be soldiered.
Im in my mind , hell yeah that's cool , me in real life changed iPhone 6s+ to Samsung s8+
"Ye"
Could you not just use one of those really cheap wireless receivers that stay on the outside of the case, so it doesn't matter if the case is metal, and plugs into the charging port. Although I suppose it does block the port.
You can get a magnetic charger for that device then it's technically plugged in but it's not. That could work and a challenge with USB C is one I'd like to see
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
!
No need to do all this, just buy an android device like a samsung or an lg flagship with all features you want
Firstly you should ground your self while installing this module. Human body can be easily charged with static electricity. That’s event cause serious damage to the electronics devices.
Hi Im your biggest fans in China I very very hope u release you video to China video web. and Translate to Chinese. like LTT in http://bilibili.com Have their channel https://space.bilibili.com/12434430/#/ My english no good hope u can read it
What translation app are you using
I wish youtube will stop pushing your videos on my recommended feed. not interested.
what iphone are you using now? iphone x?
i wish I could get mod on my oneplus 6 by using sort of the way you modded on your iphone cause the op6 was released w glass back of the phone w/o the wireless function
Oh man! You meet some brilliant minds out there. Most of the 'hacks' and 'DIY' minds are influcenced by the western minds so the rest of the world us just follows but the great firewall makes these guys more original maybe? Any case this is great.
Congratulations you got an iPhone 8
Yeke is a Chinese god.
He is popular just because of apple..what a brand apple is .damn
Install notification led on iPhone Next project .
or buy an iPhone 8)))
How can you sure that wireless charging from those parts will be safe? it must be programmed in the motherboard ( for charging and safety purpose ) remember how samsung galaxy note 7 started exploded just because there were issue with the program that didn't pass the signal to the motherboard that phone is charged and charging signal from the wall should be block in order to avoid overcharged.
You have a lot of patience.
awesome video
Your work is Awesome sir
Love your videos <3
EEV, GreatScott, Strange Parts, Louis Rossman must do a cross over
For some reason i wan't to see you build an iphone x
Well this 39 minutes video went like a magic , thanks man
Man, whats your main job? Are you a programmer?
song name 5:25
Algorithm
Srange Parts is the proof that Apple makes inferior phones by design. I'm sure that there are tons of clever people working at Apple which can do what Strange Parts does, Apple only choses to make the phones inferior to make more money. Do not support companies like this, buy other brands.
Toooo many ads!
Hey Scott I live in shenzhen and I speak decent english and perfect chinese, I am also into tech (phone laptop camera etc), let me know if you need help looking for strange parts or a free human flesh translator, i think i will be able to help :)
that guy sells himself so short, what he does is nothing short of talented!
Is there not an aliexpress link for just the circuit and not the whole package like on his site?
Here's a thought, why don't you make an i-phone 11 in your own case with 1 tb memory, IP10 guts and everything you want into your own style case, mega battery the works rather than using old and making it later.
Your great man. I'm your fan from India Kerala
He made that in a tiny shop. Imagine what he can make out of rocket parts in a cave.
Can you please do a USB-C installement iphone 7 version
Those 133 dislike are apple employee who dosen't like what strange parts do. ??
How about Apple's newest a11 bionic chip & iOS 12 update in an iPhone 3g ?
I love the people in the background XD Good job scotty! Keep going man, love your videos! Always!
You've got great skills, well done. :-)
Step 1: Throw it out the window Step 2: Buy a Galaxy Note 9 Step 3: Use wireless charging
I hope you get to sell those kits, down really know if many people are willing to risk their iphone over this
Quick question it's probably silly but how do u remember how to put every single tiny piece back when u took them all out in the beginning? What if you put them in wrong
Hi your link dont work! it should be this one, thanks google https://store.strangeparts.com/products/iphone-7-wireless-charging-kit
anyone know what the song is at 5:25?
That LED Light mod is really chinese aesthetic
thats no good. you turned the iphone into an android.
9:16
Just buy an iphone 8
That little piece of rubber you pulled out from under the battery is supposed to be pulled upwards to pull the battery out
Oh so that black dude from tokyo drift was a backpacker huh
Hello! This this open source? I think you can IMPROVE reliability by creating a new design which include not just this hack but also usb connector and everything related to this on 1 flex cable and place motherbord connector onto it. It will be more easily to install just by replacing standard usb flex by new desig and also more reliable.
China is a amazing place.. Me and a friend is gonna visit just because of your videos !
Started a company that build custom iPhone. ?? maybe that's the only way I'll use an iPhone.
Hahaha DIY =) complete kit for wireless charging nice!! You should test some extra stuff like listening to music with a jack adapter and charging at the same time. But this is truly awesome. Apple probably won't like this
Srange Parts ! how much did the iphone 7 cost ?
Now, do it on your Strange Parts iPhone.
Dude why dont u add face id in iphone 7 ??
What have you not done? Honestly like next a rocketship out of an iPhone
Could you make I phone 6s to case I phone 8
Can someone tell me: iPhone 7 boot up without the home button? Or ir stuck on apple logo? Thanks.
next challenge : Transform an apple phone into a samsung one
22:18 lol
Nice job mate.......
iPhone X without a notch? XD
You can only do that with plastic backcovers
With all those upgrades you're gonna turn your IPhone into an Android
Since it is just sandwiched, just shaking the phone hard would disconnect the pins. Better if you could solder the power pins themselves.
Thought when you changed the dock you would lose the Touch ID
Buy a iphone 7 16gb version.. upgrade to 128gb storage + wireless charge... thats superb...
Please make an Android with i phone......!!!!
You're awesome, keep doing awesome stuff!
Please include the prices too..
When you usually see at 40min video on YouTube you never click it because it’s usually boring and far to long, but when it’s strange parts the longer the better because the whole video is a learning experience for everyone involved. Keep up the content love watch your videos scotty. Bring on more DIY projects!!
Do you live in China ? Or hk ?
I would love if you could modify my s9 but you I know you cant but I really love your videos
Next project, design and build your own phone with all these tinkerers from the market. Imagine what these guys could accomplish.
This reminds me of the good ole Nokia days in the early 2000's where you could totally customize your phones and add new features in!
There is an app on the AppStore called testm which tests everything
Is it me or Scotty trying to prove wrong the Asian guy's design
Is the headphone jack still in it now?
Chinese guy sneaking into those dms
It is always great journey of ups & downs in your videos and I love that.
next challenge: Windows Xp on a IPhone
Any chance to make iphone 8 1tb ?
how about wireless charging and 3.5mm jack on the same Iphone??
Just buy a iPhone 8 lol
Thumbs up for the video editing!
you have some good skills. i couldn't be bothered or the talent to do this ,so i choose a company with phones that still have headphone jack and wireless charging, I dont like apple cause they will make their phones obsolete by changing things so they wont work with previous generations
That's why don't be a isheep n do not buy icrap . I mean after paying flagship price for n iPhone still being missing out on flagship features makes no sense...
Ive been wireless charging my iPhone 6s since I got it, using a wireless charging receiver (look it up) the only disadvantage is that it takes the lithning port, which you can plug out if you want to though, but its a great thing for less then 15 bucks
well done iphone guy..
I love how big the phone modifications market is! Who would have thought that this was huge!
You need another camera man.....am available for employment and I have lots of ideas too??
THIS IS AWESOME!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
Apple is just being lazy
Yet another amazing Strange Parts video Scotty. Brilliant idea and design Yeke, I hope you sells a thousand kits. ??????Strange Parts??Scotty?????????Yeke,???????????? http://strangeparts.com/wireless
Scotty you never fail to amaze me and lots other viewers with what you do. I enjoy your fascinstion with your work and really appreciate the passion you put in every video you upload. Salute to you and the people behind strangeparts
can u make the iphone have usb c?
Can u install dual camera like iPhone X ,it will be cool
Basically an iPhone 7 in an iPhone 8 body am I right?
Scott did you change your camera? Video quality is so much better! If you could do tutorials (like idiot proof step by step videos) that would be awesome, especially for engineers in training or has in engineers like myself wishing to go back into the field as a hobby :)
Next challenge install an s-pen and type c port please
Great.. Amazing.. waaoo.. My question is how much does that wireless charging coil costs?
Yyyyeeeeessssss!!!!! Wireless charging for older iPhones
Hey, i think you have to use other stuff instead of the foamtape. Maybe some plastic-retention, that doesn‘t shrink over the time.
Funny how the world cup was in the backround in the TV on one part...and that ended nearly 2 months ago.
Call me cynical but it seems to me that after it is all said and done if you want wireless charging it'd be cheaper and less hassle to sell your iPhone 6-7 on eBay or Craigslist and use those funds to buy an iPhone 8 or X.
bro will you make a video of best iphone x clones in china....
Just wanted to say wow, never seen this channel before and didn't think I'd sit through the entire video but you proved me wrong. Amazing journey, having done some DIY's myself I know the pain of putting it back together and having it break a few hours later. Awesome seeing you persevere, awesome seeing you work through the issues, and awesome seeing tinkerers and modders like you and Yeke doing what you do
Such a great video .. (I own a one plus device) but I appreciate these videos and I believe the colabs are great. Also I love the interview portion of the video however the subtitles went a little fast. If you could slow them down a little bit that would be great. Thank you for this video.
What an awesome video Scotty! Btw, what's the song that starts on 5:25 ?
please combine your custom iphone that you've made earlier like, putting earphone jack, custom casing and glowing logo, adding the storage and this wireless charging module. it would be cool in my mind!
hey i was wondering is it possible to get the ironman flashing led back and the the one in which the light was sync with the music and that light was from both the back logo and the speaker holes....
Wow you already near 1 mil subscribers. You and Jerryrigeverything channel are on the opposite. You build phone, Jerry disamble it. It will be fun if you two have collaboration together.
I can say with almost 100% certainty that this guy is still a virgin.
awesome its too complicated to call it as DIY
And with your iPhone 7 headphone jack mod on this, you can now have the wireless charging iPhone 7 with a headphone jack
What about another phone my radmi 3s prime is this work?
How about cpu and ram upgrade since you already did rom upgrade
I REALLY want you to put USB C in an iPhone next.
Adaptation, Improvisation. But your weakness is not you technique..
nice improvement for iphone 7,
amazing. broooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. but it was too long. hahahaha
Electronic components are getting closer everyday to organic.
While wireless charging is cool to try out it is not all that efficient at delivering power and heat from it tends to cause accelerated battery degradation. I have owned 2 phones that support wireless charging and it is next to useless in a real charging scenario. It charges so slow that you would have to leave it on all night so if you have to do that you are better off just plugging in any way.
You are the friendliest youtuber!!! And your journey is my inspiration... KEEP DEBUGGING LIFE ! ! ! ????
I was looking for a video like this THANK YOU SO MUCH!
How did u fix the scratch on the back ?
i hope you survive china
damn this video make me want to travel to Shenzhen...
Like This sir > Awesome ... good job
Awesome !! Toi bad my phone is a 6s ;)
We said to try it on One Plus 6.
The information and scenes covered in 8 minutes of the video is absolutely insane. You can learn so much just from 8 mins of this 40 minute video
Could just solder the pins (like even a slight bit) on the wireless charging ribbon to the battery flex cable then plug it in, should work, it's just an issue with the wireless charging cable not touching the flex cables pins right
which part of the china i can get it? i i wanted to order it from SG.
Body of iPhone se but big for iPhone 7 to see how it would look? Or is that just me?
Cool strange parts ??
Im sorry man, but nothing is more impressive then adding the 3.5mm jack in an iPhone 7 ??
Great video. Appreciate the time and effort you put into this to make it happen. Clearly this isn't said and done within a day, truly enjoy your videos. Thank you!
It's kinda interesting to see someone with a tremendous amount of knowledge like Yeke working on a hardware market, what level of formation this dude have? I mean, I'm finishing my electrical engineering graduation an I'm not even close to design something like that. He should be hired by some major tech company, or at least start selling this products internationally. Amazing video as always, China is truly wonderful.
Whats the song playing when u take apart the phone at around 6 mins?
Why brought you to china originally? What do you do for work now in china that keeps you there; other than youtube?
Next project suggestion >> You can try to replace the iPhone Lightning Connector for a Type-C Connector :), Great idea to save money and don't buy Apple OEM Lightning Cables Crap ever again. Anyways, good luck in any future adventure :)
Good story. But the product is not. No one will buy such a thing. Too much work to install and very unstable.
"Local man add an feature a billion dollars company struggle to implement."
IMO if you know you would not take it off later, you could just solder the connector onto the board. This would eliminate the mounting pressure problem.
Is there any bigger battery with custom iphone 7 back shell on chinese market? I’d like to have iphone 7 with bigger battery, not bulky battery case :)
I truly admire your perseverance and dedication - keep up the great work!!!
make one for iphone se please......
Just buy an Android.
How i can buy iphones from Wang Wei or other china seller for cheap?
great
do me a favor and come back when your over 45, and post a comment on your current eyesight.. ;)
Next time build an iPhone with a headphone jack and wireless charging
I'm always been a huge fan of u...i never miss your video. Great effort.. i am also trying the same but not getting all the parts..??
The second most electronic device people seem to have in China, CALCULATOR......
I would love to know where (online) I can get THAT USB meter that you used. I don't know if there is room in the phone for this, but if there is wouldn't it be more reliable and easier to install if there was a daughter board with connectors that could bridge the stock connector, the wireless charging connector (add a proper connector to it) and the iPhone?
We should get your friend’s info so we can buy him some iPhones and help him get the money for his shop!
Who will do a Chinese subtitle?
This seems so complicated. I would rather just work and save money to buy an iPhone 8...
First off love these videos. Got me back into modding. Makes me want to try seeing if I can put a wireless charger on a psp 3000. 5v 2amp input is doable just where to connect the qi wireless unit. And will it still let me plug in the ac adapter.
Any time frame on when it will be available for iPhone 7plus?
This brings up the idea, Can you wirelessly change an iPad?
There is one like it but sticks on the back of any iphone and connects through the lightning port
nice of you to take us through all the struggles
Why exactly did you take apart the whole display? Ie top speaker flex back aluminum plate etc.. you didn't need to do that unless u broke the display taking it off.
Nice
I would chuck a little solder on those gold contacts on the cable to give it more to contact with the dock pins.
Can you please make a video on adding volume button to AirPods?
nice project ! ! ! Awesome video again and amazing skills.. you are so genius.. i hope your next project will doing something with the iPhone X.
Honestly, NONE of this is necessary if you just buy a $5.00 EXTERNAL lightning port adapter for QI Wireless charging. These just plug-in to the lightning port of your iPhone and stick to the back of your iPhone (under your case). NO voiding of warranties (if still applicable) and NO disassembly of your iPhone. These can be bought almost anywhere online these days. What's the point of this video, just to say you can do it... Internally??? Not worth the time, effort or risk!
It seems that every time I come to the Strange Parts channel, I never leave dissapointed. Very awesome video! Look forward to more content in the future!
I would gladly buy one if you can get it for iPhone 6.
4:58 When he said “Hey Siri its me.” My phone literally went off??
China is awesome
If you had a website with these modded iPhones I would ssooooo buy one ??
why all these things is possible to do in china (Shenzhen)
WOW! Everything possible in China, especially in Shenzhen. Does it work with iphone se?
Just an FYI Scotty, you can buy colored stickers that go over the touch ID sensor. Fingerprint still works too, works even a little better. Changed my rose gold 6s to a fully black front that way.
as an ee this is amazing. It's also scary that their culture is so competent and ours (usa) isn't. I'd love to be in that culture
You are more innovative than Apple itself
iPhone 7 with Edge screen?
another awesome project, i love it!
Just wondering, did Yeke ever mention how he fixed your phone? I'm kind of curious to know if it was an issue with the installation, the wireless charger, or something else.
we need more weekly videos even if their short.
8:40 Wouldn't adding some more solder to the connector legs make better contact, giving it a little more hight?
??“?”???????????
Awesome video!!!!
this is dope! plz post the 6s
Hey, this might be a dumb question but i was wondering what the mat that you use to take the iphones apart is called?
i wish i have just regular iphone
Man can you make wireless charging for oppo f1s?
How can I get wireless charger for Honor 8 lit?
Stubby Clapp
Amazing as always mate. I love being inspired by your videos and seeing the great work done at the markets that allow people to customize their phones. Keep up the exceptional work.
god dammit man.. i didn't watch yet but i already did hit the like button!! please, make more videos "touring" around China.
Feeling proud to get my idea working love u brother Its me who sent u all that emails(Siyam)
Dude, wich camera do you use?
WOW
I'm an android user yet I still watch everyone of Strange parts videos
Nowhere else on youtube will you find someone who puts this much work into a video, and can manage to make a 40 minute long video entertaining. Really impressive work!!!!
what app were you using to translate ?
iStrangePart Phone
You should have been a surgeon with that precision and delicate work!
China is damn! Seems like one can get each and every tini tiny part of mobile phones there.
Inspyring! Now add a headphone jack!
Wow, another great experiment video! I hope this wireless receiver will available for any Android phone
I don’t know if you know this but Chinese smart phones don’t have play store or google play store services and downloading them still doesn’t work. I’ve tried a couple of things from the internet but nothing worked. I’ve tried on Samsung and huawei. Probably you can find someone in huaqiangbei or you could do it yourself. I live in Chengdu. ??
Are there any for the plus
is Iphone 7+ has more place to work with?
Apple is screaming right now. They are now worried it will make the iPhone 7 outsell the iPhone X due to the price and wireless charging modding.
You should swap the Lightning Jack with USB type C.
Always trying something new ??????
I know it sounds crazy but ive always wanted to know if you could take the iphone 5 or 5s take that and add a bigger screen like a mod almost im pretty sure i couldnt even work but it would be cool. Love the vids scotty
Always good to see you upload Scotty!!
I am probably not going to do the wireless charging, but I indeed want that the Strange Parts logo back. Maybe you can consider sell phone cases or stickers, I believe they are not hard to make in Shen Zhen. I would definitely buy them.
but the question is wierless is not the fastest
I love watching all your vids. I will say however, you are a sucker for frustration.
I love the fact that you show that you can upgrade parts in a phone like you would a desktop, it just may be more difficult.
Dude! Love the assembly music! B-roll of phone assembly
I need an iPhone 6s Plus one... THANKZ!
Does anyone else get that Blade Runner feel? Like when is he going to meet the guy who makes snakes and owls and stuff? I love it!
Love it, but holy jump cut batman lol off to ebay to buy parts
What did you used to do for a living (or still do for a living) before you were making these great videos. At one point I remember you saying you’re not specialized in a certain area as you worked mostly on some other area. I believe you were making ur own iPhone or upgrading the memory 800%.
just buy iphone 8
what do the steps say on 2:32?
As always this place keeps surprising me ?? The work you're doing is absolutely amazing and big respect for that. Good luck in discovering even more amazing stuff on a market. This city really looks like a place I could have fun every day ??
you know they sell things on Amazon that plugs in the lightning port and then you can put the phone in a case and you can wireless charge, much easier.
You should make the iPhone completely waterproof
plz korean sub!!!
if i could afford it i'd pay starange parts to build me a 32gb droid phone from parts found in those markets but alas living on SSD doesn't give a person much "disposable" income :(
If every nationality can work together then the human race can fix every problem! Unfortunately, politicians and the media don't allow for this.
Can you try turning normal apple earphones to wireless airpods?
Pointless
Even though I'm no longer an Apple fan, I still found the inner workings so interesting. I love your videos. You have a knack for explaining complex technical terms in a way that's easy to understand for us some folks.
Adding wireless/Qi charging= easy. Adding RFID/NFC capabilities along with Qi charging= incredible. The title doesn't explain what you're doing. The title makes what you're doing seem less impressive. Wireless charging is just hooking up a coil to the battery. Adding the RFID/NFC is the special part.
scotty thanks to you i was able to repair two iphone screens...not hardcore like you yet though lol
Has anyone tried this with iPhone SE
Wireless charging will really come in handy when they finally manage to remove all of the ports from phones. To waste such technology on mere electric toothbrushes...
Should have chosen an iPhone 4 because it already has a glass back, or a 5c
China is the best place for hackers.
I love these videos??
you truly inspire me. i want to do what you do but i dont know where i should start hehe
I want 1
Wow apple should hire you :)
Love the backpacker marketer insight. So great and human. More details and interviews like this please!
Love your videos. Enjoy very much seeing China. ?,????????
Woww...Iwireless????????
Scotty how about a tour of your home in China?
I believe these videos prove to serve an ulterior purpose. Whether you realize it or not, Scotty, these videos show me, as a consumer of technology that not only is America's technological prowess lacking, it also shows how other companies, even companies founded on American soil are taking advantage of everyone by not providing the latest and greatest to their end-users, even though it could damn well had been engineered with certain advancements in technology in mind. To show the inside of such devices, to do these things companies disapprove the average consumer of doing which ruins their deceptive magic. As somebody who has been concentrating strictly on Apple devices, had you encountered any legal trouble by Apple as of late? I wouldn't think Apple would take such things laying down, as they certainly go after mom-and-pop shops who specialize in Apple repair, let alone one who tinkers with such things on YouTube. I'm curious if you've been hounded by Apple the same way others in the tech and repair space had been.
16:51 i legit checked my phone
Yay! U r back!
This was awesome! Always so interesting and entertaining to watch, can't wait for the ultimate modded iphone video, should be amazing :D
Your great iam watching all of your video....
Great interviews and cinematography. Wondering if foam is the correct coarse of action to take if the foam gets compressed at an odd angle then it won't have the right pressure. So that seems more like the issue. As other comments have stated and I really think the design is great but the right pressure is needed it seems. Silicon or rubber or even plastic does seem like a good course of action but some experimentation with the right size and shape would be needed. Maybe like a full rectangle piece of silicon with the middle hollowed out so it just goes around the whole foam pad that already ships with the iphone... Basically like these shapes: [ Would have added cost ofcourse but the goal is to make this plug and play as the dismantling and rebuilding takes long enough as it is for people like us that aren't going to be pros at dismantling these things. Soldering would make this more permanent but we are trying for the plug and play style I am sure.
where's the custom back with laser etched design and backlight?
Do you sell these phones? I would love to buy one of your creations.
i loved your videos! the name "strange parts" is just fit your videos. all about strange parts. I have a question, can you put iPhone 7 plus' dual camera to the iPhone 7? it would be so cool
what app you used to translate?
the kit is still available as of 9pm eastern time 22aug2018
i hate apple products but these videos are amazing. i now really want to go to shenzhen and just explore the markets.
Respect is so a good thing and you good at it, appreciate it. Like the talk with the designer. However the edits are different, not to want you see struggeling all the of time but it make sense to show effort, to give some idea how many time it takes to solve a problem. Your video's are mostly different, not as 'sleek' like others and that makes an import difference, that's the charme of your video's. Don't try to hide details because it seems not imortant to you or you think it is not important to others (or boring). Try to keep it informative like you did before. The short shots in between of country life is a great addition.
if it were 50, id buy it ,but 70 is so close to 100 to me for some reason, and for that price you should just buy a 5 dollar qi adapter, and put a case on it (which most do to their iPhones anyway) on top of that I know how much you guys probably manufacture these for. there are many documentaries in which describe how easy , simple , and cheap it is to make and produce things in China. i honestly think 40-50 dollars would be a great price. the housing is cool tho.
Hey is it possible to replace a 30 pin on an iPhone 4s with a lightning charger?
Amazing! ??
Are you going to be attending the Beijing conference where they release new products and toys? PLEASE DO, because I? want to meet you there!
Your old customized backboard for Strange Parts is pertty cool :)
Man, I love tech community. It trascends cultures and languages. Great video ??
When you think about it, he is basically just making an iPhone 8
You should make the ultimate iPhone 7 with wireless charging and a headphone jack,that would be quite cool
you have awesome videos man keep doing what you're doing
I know that this video only came out today, but I am a bit surprised that the kit is not sold out yet. I'm sure it is close, I bet it will be out by tomorrow like last time her some something
Anoyher very high quality video, thankyou!
I just use a MagQi with the connection to the lightning connector hanging out so I can disconnect it to plug in Apple Car Play. I've been doing that for over a year. No need to open the phone, I just put it under the case. :) Still, love you vids and the tear downs! Impressive!
i love your videos. continue it man
Its always amazing to see the passion and effort you make sharing this with the world, keep doing great as you've been doing ;) greetings from México!!!
Uhm, I would have used a solid material little piece instead of foam. I think that might solve the issue.
Is the language they speak hard to learn?
FLEX TAPE
See if you make an iPhone with USB-C
Your camera skills have improved so much, I love this video so much :)
Pretty cool how you communicated so effectivily with your Chinese fan. I'm glad he didn't take anything you said the Wong Wei.
So can u put A11 chip on iphone 6?
I love watching your videos. Very intereresting. And these chinese people, some proper brains over there. But my question, why didn't you just get iPhone 8? :D just joking, great video. I have an iPhone 7 too, loved to watch it.
I would love to see this on iPhone 4 mostly because the back is already glass and doesn't already have wireless charging. And cause it's an old iPhone
i don't think its really that hard, since you just have to put one of those adapters in the phone
but the thing is, all the new iphones have wireless charing anyway, but still cool I guess.
Yall out here preaching about how iphones are better but this mans videos have mostly been adding features androids have that iphones dont/didnt for a long time
Someone is going to sell this as an iPhone 8
"A CHINESE GUY"
Why everyone says metal back is not good for wireless charging while all metals are conductive in various levels?
Now add a USB Type-C instead of the Lightning connector :).
The only thing I noticed in this video. 34:27, is that knock-off Pump it Up? Those panels are unlike anything I have ever seen.
The interview with Yeke was amazing. Thanks for taking the time to edit it all together so smoothly. Please keep featuring DIYers from around the markets.
Love your videos. I've been repairing phone for over 4 years now, and love learning more from your vids. So thank you. They are both entertaining, and educational. I look forward to your future ideas. Also, just watching this video gave me a headache. I won't be trying this anytime soon, but I hope there are some brave "patient" souls out there who successfully complete this upgrade.
Foam tape doesnt work? WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY FLEX TAPE
Hi, can you customize an iPhone X ? Like what you did in this iphone ?
very very cool!!!
I have that exact same blue silicone soldering/parts mat!
WTF...nearly a 40 minute video of excellence. Great video work, and an excellent project....I loved every minute.
I love watching your videos so much. Even if they take a long time to make, id gladly wait for them
Do you think this wireless charging mod would work in a phone that also has your headphone jack mod?
I find it sad that the Chinese market chose the most locked phone in the market to make a lot of diying for it. I look forward to an android DIYing video.
Why does the introduction video have the same audio as the pornhub videos?!...
This channel is the only channel that I don't mind a 40 min long video
This is fucking epic man!!!!
awesome video! grat project! and hey! where do you get your music from?
I wish I could be there and try that on my custom iPhone's!!!
Great video my man! I always look forward to seeing them in my notification tab
can i get only the red cover with your logo on it, please??
apple gonna sue this channel down hahaha screw you apple charging so much for simple tech
Are you still in Shenzhen? maybe we could meet up..lol
excellent video, is there anything more you can do to the phone?? seems like you've done it all! If you plan on doing a different phone, Android would be great!
You are a savage and a legend. I love you bro. Best electronic projects i have ever seen.
Have you thought about building a Samsung Galaxy S5 to S7 Phone?
Is it just me or does anyone else want to know where the selves or part went.
Can’t wait for the next video.. amazing.. how about a dual sim iPhone for your next video. !!!
Handsdown,Scotty is the best vlogger and technician on youtube.Props to you Mate.
Handsdown,Scotty is the best vlogger and technician on youtube.Props to you Mate.
Brilliant, as always
what a jigsaw an iphone is
Would you be willing to do any Android phones like Samsung? Would love to see some of the things that you could do with those. Or is there just not the market for that where you are?
That first phone dismantling segment was really cool and well recorded. Just shows how intricate the making of our everyday smartphone is.
I literally want to walk into an apple store with this phone, ask them does it wireless charge, wait for them to say no, then test it and have it actually work ??
You should've used an iPhone 8 body and put the iPhone 7 internals
quit it with the creepy face thumbnails
Woohoo finally a new vid
Definitely want to see the proper guide before i buy it :P
I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S4. All the newer ones have it built in. Guess Apple can't afford to put in a wireless charger so they can sell replacement cords and worn out sockets. My G4 I just pulled off the back. Maybe you can boost the memory for the new Samsung 512GB microSD chips out.
Just plug the beggar in. Seems way too much faff to me and surely now the iPhone 7 water resistance has just gone clean out the window. Yes, it’s an interesting object lesson but there’s no way I’m butchering my iPhone 7 anytime soon.
iPhone ex ???????? its pronounced iPhone ten.....
Just a few thoughts. First you are awesome and you do things I couldn’t imagine myself tackling. Second when people bust Apple’s chops because it takes them a long time to bring new features to market they need to think about the reliability they bring to the table. Yes they lag behind Samsung and Huawei but they want to make sure their products work correctly and I respect that. For what it’s worth while I do own all Apple products I really respect Samsung and I love their products as well.
Efficiency of the wireless chargers are in general 50% so when you see the draw of 1 amps it is actually charging about 500 ma
I live in hk and I would like to go to his store to buy it, can you please tell me where is his booth, nice video I love all of your videos
How much cost the microscope you use
Wonder if he could do this to the OnePlus 6 lots of people thought with the glass back it could do with wireless charging.
Dude you are AMAZING !
Did you change camera? The image quality is better today... ^^
i knew you would cut yourself 10 secs before it happened. always move blades away from body parts, but i guess this advice comes a little late....
If you got an iphonr 7 with the storage bump, headphone jack and wireless charging it would be the ultimate iPhone 7
Awesome vid I wish I could get one for my 7+
You can buy a Qi sticker on Amazon that plugs into the data port to get wireless charging. No need to take apart the device.
I think Apple is searching for your phone number.
In this video: buy an iphone x. lol
Maybe you should sie flexible plastic and print the part in 3D printer instead od foam
Awesome love it
thumbs waaay up !
Hahahaha it won’t be an iphone anymore
Your not a hardware tech. Not even close!!! How long are you working on these 1 or 2 hours a day?
Can we get some iPhone six. I was considering buying an I phone seven just for this. Little out of my budget.
Easier just get a wireless charging case- lol.
So we can use Samsung fast wireless charging for the iPhone?
This will probably get lost in the comments somewhere and I’m sure it’s been asked before... but is there any possible way to mod the iPhone to show a notification light like on Samsung so users don’t have to unlock their phone to see if there’s a notification? Like at night waking up and looking across the room I can see my girlfriends phone blinking blue in the dark but I have to physically touch my phone to see if I have a notification. Is it possible? Or would you have to mod the firm/software to make it happen?
Waiting for Strange Mods Shop
While I quite enjoy your videos, after all this work just for some basic phone functionality I don't understand why anyone would willingly purchase or use an iPhone.
Can you add an NFC ? Writer and reader?
Hi love your vids!!! Could you please put the price of the parts that you use in your projects so we could compare them?
Ooooooo, you cursed. (For the first time)
Well done !!!
My friend, you just proved that the iPhone 8 is useless. Awesome video!!!
great videos, such a great vibe!
Where exactly can i find Yeke? Which Adresse/market booth? Thank you for this nice video!
Life tips from strange parts... I think this is a project for tomorrow... I’ve been saying that my whole life ??
I don't understand why apple did not do the same thing as aluminium is more durable than glass , having a cut out makes sense. I have always wondered if they could have used another material other than glass. In your headphone series you used a special circuit board, why is that not used more in circuit boards in phones ?
you're the guy that built an iPhone from scratch right? how was I not subbed to you before?
Budget iPhone 8 basically.
Now you are a pro iphone destroyer????
now the final act please, wireless charging with headphone jack on the 7! :D
hack the newer phones, add new hardward features like your doing to the old phones, then sell the phones, scale, hire people, turn it into a new thing!
Awesome video Scotty! Just love how you capture the all the problems encountered. Do you know how to get iphone7 working logic boards outside of China? Keep up the good work!
Hi Scotty, i think this idea can be improved a lot with a little modification to the main board connector. The issue you now encounter is due to very small tolerance in the connector for what I can see. If you could shave off the thickness of the added flex cable off the socket, this might even snap into place without added foam. For what I can see, the main board connector makes contact from the side, giving you maybe just enough room for some sanding or shaving off. Keep up the great videos!
man i love your screw drivers all of them send me a link or where to buy them
Almost million subscribers. Keep it up man. I loved your videos. ?? ?? ??
6s please!!!
Won't it interfere when using apple pay? Great video as always. Now put a fingerprint scanner on an iphone x ??
You should work for Apple your videos are awesome
What is the cost of a refurbished iPhone 7?.. Great video!!??
I really love your patience and calmness when things seem to not be going your way. I also think your grin and charisma make welcoming you super easy.
I love how open and honest you are to us, the viewers. showing the real struggle which comes with this mod. I'm sure other people, doing a project with the goal of selling stuff, would probably cut a way a lot of the footage showing how difficult it was to install the thing they want to sell. But not you, which is what I really appreciate. Good job!
4:40 THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS
A small question that i got is, how did Yeke(?) found out about all the pins that he needed at the connector? Did they just test all thr 28 pins (or how many there are) or did they got the scematics somehow from apple?
0:12 "MORE FOREST, LESS BUSHES" lmao
"I'm here with Wong Wei" "ye" "and you've seen my videos" "ye" "you only speak a little bit of english..." "ye" "okay..."
It would be great if you make a shorter videos
Why was the guy waterboarding the little Buddha?
Great video and nice job yeke ????. Honestly I'm good with my port charging
What an absolutely fantastic video! So humble in your approach to everything. It's such a breath of fresh air and a pleasure to watch your content.
In between random video shots are absolutely beautiful.
Can you make a magnetic charger?
You should do this with an iPhone 3GS or 5c they both already have plastic backs.
Is it possible to move the Touch ID to the back?
Another great video...
After watching one of these I always feel that any project is possible... I then try something and am brought back to reality but still so inspiring! I am currently trying to mod an old macbook pros touch pad and keyboard connector to work via usb for a raspberry pi in the casing. (My way of trying to reuse a totalled seawater damaged macbook) and always have one of your videos in the background to keep me persistent and humble in the face of project adversity just like you.
iphone 7 w/ headphonejACK and wireless charging and jailbroken? = best iphone ever.
when will you sell your own merch like shirts and like tech and stuff?
Love the videos you remind me of jailbreaking. you modifying apple's products will surely influence others to begin doing these things themself and truly spark the new wave of creativity and rebels to Apple's totalitarian reign over their products and bring back the freedom of owning what you bought instead of being controlled what you do with it.
You're an inspiration. Your future will be bright
YOU NEED TO ADD THIS TO THE IPHONE 4S !!! so its like the iphone X
70 bucks hahahah im sure you bought it for 1 bucks hhhhhhhh
Upgrades the iPhone 6s or iPhone 7(with headphonejack)with it so your iPhone 6s/iphone 7 (with headphonejack)will be the king of all iphone and also how about some NFC
Hi
Have you tried duck tape it seems to solve everything ??
stop shaming apple xD
Genius !
Love your videos. When you first went viral, to your video with Linus, every video you put out is inspiring and shows what happens when you learn from your mistakes and don't lose sight of your goal. Thank you for everything that you do to provide this content and I would love learn more from you personally about your mindset and what helps you push forward. I think a lot of people want to know what it takes to be so positive like you.
Is it possible to have a type C connector on an iPhone instead of lightning?
Do something with android phones please!
Above all you're a great storyteller. Entertaining to the last end.
Make iphone 7 bezel less :/
How old is Scotty? He looks hot.
How come you always look to the left when you talk? Do you have tourettes or a twitch or something? No disrespect meant, I'm just curious as I watch all of your videos and just noticed it.
this is your best video to date
This guy just basically turned his iPhone 7 in to a product red iPhone 8 just add the a 11 chip
did I hear right? "ni ha" - "don't sayin 'ni ha'!"? 13:45
Pretty amazing video.. always wait for your uploads! They never fail to amaze me!
I need for iphone 7 plus ...
Someone told me that in china there is no middle class. Then why the fuck since the starting of your channel im seeing middle class chinese people in your videos?
Awesome video. I really love this kind of DIY stuff. Thats why i will go to Shenzhen i November to the market and shop some cool stuff. Where can I/we find Yeke if we are in Shenzhen. Like if he is near the Huaqiangbei in witch building, floor and stall number?
I’m a big fan of your videos, thank you for the interesting content.
That looks like an expensive hobby you got there.... nice work.
Only your channel am I happy to watch 5 adds on I enjoy every minute of your videos
Love your videos. Deserved the growth!
oooo sweeet new strange parts video !!!!!!
Yee
I have problem with my iPhone 6, connector doesn’t work if I don’t plug the headphones it is really weird and annoying I used it about a month and it started working normally for a week then it fucked up again I don’t know what to do
You're the Bob Ross of this generation. I can never ever get bored watching you and hear you speak. I wish you could post daily. Keep up the great work!
Nice structure of the video strange parts this is a awesome video
That moment when you think that is just putting a flex cable under the connector easy job , but...No it is not that easy . Even Scotty struggled doint it ,great video by the way keep doing these cool projects ,many thanks
In the past it was said Made in China stands for bad quality. For me today Made in China means a kind of quality of its own.
so this channel transformed into an apple fanboy place?
Very nice video! Although I prefer multiple shorter episodes instead of one very long one. I'd say about 15 minutes max. That also gives you more channel views ;) Anyway, great video, keep up the good work!
Again a great video to watch. Maybe just an idea for improving the product... Perhaps sell a battery with the wireless charging pad (including a single 'connector', without the need of a passthrough) already integrated in each other. The product might be a bit more expensive (as a battery must also be included), but is less prone to error as you just have an 'original' connector to connect, as the passthrough seems to be the culprit.
I love your Videos. Wish you could make 2 videos. One shorter video and one Longer video(which you normally do). I sometimes don't end up watching your entire videos and wish I could see the just of your projects in a scaled down,shorter video.
convert the phone to use a type c usb port instead!
Please share the schematics that he gave you
33:36 its actually an ammeter Sorry for being annoying
Does it have a headphone jack though
Hey Scott! I love watching your videos and I was wondering if you could show us your apartment in a video, it would be very interesting to see. Thankss
I'd love to see you do something interesting with a Samsung phone, but I'm not sure what that would be. I've been repairing Samsung phones for three years now and they are so very differently put together compared to the Iphone. I have a feeling that the Samsung products doesn't have the same kind of after market mods as the Iphone does though.
Do a collaboration with JerryRigEverything
and Strange Parts is at it again!! A BIG THUMBS TO THIS GUY!!!
100k views day 1. Wow!
I was waiting for some time for a new video, this actually was worth the wait... looking forward for the new one :)
Love you did it but if iPhones Apple products in store explode and they make addons to mess with bord battery charging ports and PCB... must be on the back on your mind if it explodes.
My Siri got activated
please add Turkish language as subtitles.
What about replacing lightning with usb-c?
3:33 I bet “yeah” is the only English he knows ??????
I got a Samsung ad lol
Great! I'd enjoy one for an iPhone 6
I tend to agree to most of the comments below - brilliant job, great video, was very interestion to watch! Just one question: was there any way to put the wireless charger receiver underneath the Apple logo so that there was no need in a big hole on the back and the glass and all that? Like, when you was making your glowing logo instead of the Apple logo you cut your logo on the back of a case. Could it be possible to cut an Apple/Strange Parts logo and place the reciever behing it so that the metal back was intact? Just a thought and maybe an idea for a new project and video. ;-)
How you added ads to this video in china
can you make your own note 9? plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Dude you are the inspiration that I can overpass my limits. I am starting to program in Arduino. Good job men.
Great video my friend !
Wireless Charging is the future. Also, this is how I Like Wireless Charging! (Since Samsung Already Have one)
You missed an opportunity to put "GONE WRONG (Blood)" in the title
Next we need the iPhone 7 512gb version with wireless charging and a headphone jack
Thank you for another great video. The assembly sequence editing was great! Now that you have a store selling kits will you have some other items for sale like strange parts stickers, t-shirts, or other kits?
Strange Parts: I want to build a thing China: okay call two weeks later China: as a random coincidence we have built a thing that is magically exactly like the thing you wanted to build. Come next door to your apartment, also a random coincidence, and we will show you how to install it.
Scotty your perseverance is awesome, watching you fail again and again was hard but the way you handle it is so humbling. Thank you for having a crazy adventure and letting us join in on the fun. P.S. never give up on your crazy crazy ideas :).
I really like his videos. I personally don't have skills to do these things, but I am happy to see others doing such amazing projects.
Damn that’s expensive
Does anything actually ever go right the first time?
Next project: Quick Charge?????????
You should start vlogging man you are awesome!!!
Build a Special Phone with Special Specifications like no other phone at this moment.
Well done. To be honest i Love Phones and i have to admit that i would'nt do that by Myself. Too Scared of breaking anything.... or just screw up by Losing the screws.... Greetings From Germany!
wow so not worth the hassle. Thanks for showing that though :-)
Hey man! Love your videos!! Would be hard to make a Pixel 2 with more RAM and a bigger battery and solve the problem that Google seems to not be able to? I see you working with iPhones all the time, so here is a new challenge haha. Keep it up!!!
The only Youtuber that I can watch a 40 minute video straight and still be interested! Love your vids man please keep them up!!
Anyone who wants a 6s kit reply to my comment to let him know.
I think the real issue is that you went out for dinner and came back and the phone was STILL charging. I'll stick with my OnePlus 5T wired Dash charging, in the time you went out and ate, the phone would have been fully charged.
I want a "pimp my iphone" series
how many screws did you loose
Awesome edit by auram and you!
Can you do a video on upgrading the ram on on iphone
That's why I like electronic so much. Didn't exist ... And Someone created. This is fantastic. Congratulations for sharing that.
Yo have yo make a iPhone with Jack wirelles charging logo lightning
I love these projects so so much. Also I feel like your Chinese has improved so good job on that :D And keep the Shenzhen street shots, makes me a bit nostalgic, but always great to see some shots of one of the best cities on this planet.
Why couldn't Apple have given us wireless charging years ago. Just one connector and a bit of foam. Simple.
They should sell it so the wireless charger pad is soldered to a battery so all you need is to buy a battery with it already soldered in. So no need to take in and out the logic board or having to lineup the connector
Can you make a video explaining how you got to this point , you said you were a software engineer (the job I wanna go for) but u do all this kl stuff. Great videos
would you consider making Strange Parts logos the same size as on your phone so that I could put one on my pixel 2xl? I think that would be cool. Thanks for all of your content, really enjoy what you are doing.
Wait. Can you add wireless charging to an iPhone 4S
Wow cool xD
Your editing gets better with every video. Jealous.
Maybe you can change an Iphone from Lightning to USB C
I would love to see a 512 gigabyte iPhone 7 with the headphone jack and wireless charging
How do you access youtube from China? Why do people in China look so strange at a guy who films himself on the street? I thought they were a bit more advanced...
Or just get a samsung, it had it since the samsung galaxy s6....
Now the ultimate wirless charging, headphone jacked, 512 gigs iPhone is possible!! You should totally do it!!
20:59 THAT BATH DO :v
Great Video! Really enjoying to watch you doing this amazing stuff and showing the processes and people behind this modifications! Sorry for bad english skills, greetings from germany! ??
If on IPhones were written "Designed in China, assembled in California" it could be much smarter :D
The Amazing man does it again. Although one thing I would like to know is this, do you think this will cause the battery to degrade and spoil quickly like in a case where a person buys or uses a bad charger for their phone?
You're absolutely amazing
I was just going to sleep at 1.45am and this pops up. Stay strong eyes its only 39.14 mins more.
Scotty, question for you, where do we find that mat that you were using?
Will it work with AirPower wen it comes out
6x Ads? Is that necessary? Maybe 4? ??
Why does the iphone look so tiny in your hand ??you must have big hands
How much did you have to pay for the first iphone?
The real star in these videos is Apple. It shows how beautifully designed and engineered the iPhone really is. Truly a work of art.
What to say , great video keep up you adventures !!
You need to make it have a back light too for the logo AND have it so that it blinks like at 22:26
Are you moving??
At 32:45 what mat is that you are using also you have inspired me to brle like you
I haven't the slightest clue as to what you're doing in most of your videos, but boy is it entertaining!
Can u do that for one plus 6?
I want that phone! I love the color!
Your storage needs more video.
Do you know what microscope camera your using? It's really good quality picture, I've bought two cameras and the quality isn't good at all. Thanks
I'm just waiting for a non-apple project. A premium smartphone is a premium smartphone, you should be able to do this stuff to anything. There may not be as many ready made 3rd party parts, but that's what the channels all about right?
Your videos are very inspiring
Next upgrade, a coffee maker.....
just get a samsung
You sir, are an inspiration.
Can you do it on an iPhone 4 because it already has a glass back?
20:58 You are not doing it right
How to trick people into thinking you have an iPhone 8
i realy enjoyed this video series so much!!! please keep it up!!! greetings from berlin, germany!!!
This is a really fun idea. If I was rich and didn't have exams to worry about, I'd be all over this. It'd be fun to get an update later on how it went with the experiment. How fast it sold out and stuff~
How much is he getting from the 70 bucks?
I am wondering if you could put the bad of the wireless charger below a dbrand venyl thinking
Do u have any for 7 plus?
Can you setup everything and sell the phone
Does anyone have link for this kit on AliExpress?
Just buy an android already!
Awesome video ever want to visit Pakistan ???? lahore just saying ??
This video is so beautiful.
Try to put force touch on iphone 6
Have respect for Made in China products.
I absolutely love your channel. The quality and originality of each video more than compensates for the quantity. If only we had markets like these in the states!! Keep up the great work, hope to see another video soon.
What about ip rating on an older iPhone, you know like the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5...
Hi, well done. Very good work. I like your channel, but 70$ for the kit? I`m sorry, not for the “adventure” of maybe killing an iPhone7. To expensive.
Cool editing. You could of used the conversion kits and made it look like an Iphone 8 which has a glass back. Would of made it easier
bruh these chinese are crazy. The connecter situation is just brilliant:)
Watching this on a charching up iphone lets me look if i damaged the cable everytime i hear this sound.
Your videos are absolutely incredible
Scotty and his bloody red phone :)
Lightning to USB-C conversion ?
amazing video
Next episode: How We Added Self Deployed Airbags to an iPhone - in China
Hi Scotty. How about looking into fitting something like that to the Apple mac mouse so it wont have to use that stupid charging port on the bottom of the mouse ... ;)
U should Collab with Jerry rids everything
What about making a back plate with no hole of lighting connector and make an iPhone with wireless charging only
Can i buy your modification iphone? so great upgrade..
Remove the notch next on some phone with it. That area doesn't need touch functionality but you can take it as a bonus challenge if you want ;)
The thing I love about your videos is that you show you messing up. That is what doing any of this is like. A lot of trial and error.
I like your videos and ideas, now how about taking the inside of an iPhone ( maybe the logic board only ) and put it inside a different phone, for example a Samsung or Huawei phone that has a wireless charger, a headphone jack, dual sims and usb c connector, basically an IOS in an android phone! I think this well be the ultimate project.
Just put a glass back on it and put a wireless charger in it bam you're done
This so amazing keep up the good work scotty.
??????? ???????? ?????
maybe it is better to weld in some way, than to depend on the pressure
Love your vids. So interesting!
Great video as always, I just love you enthusiasm when throwing yourself into a new project! Shenzhen truly must be heaven for anyone into electronics hacking and tinkering!
I absolutely HATE Apple, but I find your videos very interesting.
I think iFixit could be a great sponsor if you want any. They have sponsored YT channels in the past so there is a possibility.
This video gave me chills, honestly I enjoyed it so much! I love how you are so humble and respectful to the people you come into contact with. I also love the fact of all the modding and different ideas. I love seeing a project come together, also love the scenes where the video cuts to different things going on around the city! Please keep up with what you're doing! It's absolutely fascinating! Thank you!
Apple will go nuts, if they watch this??
I’ve been asking for you to do this for months. I don’t know if u did this from my comments, but thanks for this worth the wait
buddy can i send you my huawei mate7 to modify it lol
Could you make an ultimate iphone 7? Led apple, led speakers, wireless charging, headphone jack
U r a amazing guy tht i ever saw u on youtube compared to other
Well excellent, thanks for great video. Love your videos . Can not believe how clean the streets are .
Couldn't the pressure on connector issue be fixed with swapping sponge for rubber? like hard rubber mat cut to right thickness.
Talk to Gamers Nexus They sell anti static matts -> they sell usefull produkts to their fans like you maybe they can tell oyu about shippping and stuff :P
Put a new ram chip in ur custom phone
Hey sorry I’m a repair technician and repair a shit ton of iPhones and noticed one thing you did that isn’t really recommended, on an iPhone 7 screen, always put the plate on before the camera/proximity flex and the home button, I’ve seen people damage the screens and the home buttons by putting the place on afterwards , just a tip??
Great video but always love all your videos
can you start modding android phones too?
I'm commenting since minute 7, your patience and will is to congratulate man , I would've left it open lol ??
This guy just keeps blowing my mind. Amazing.
Only speaks a little bit of English and can only say "yeh" lmao idk why I thought that was so funny. GG tho man this video was awesome!
the conversation was beautiful
Awesome video again and amazing skills :) Your video editing is impressive. From what I understood some is doing this work for you, correct? So a question come to mind. When you are filming your work at your own desk, who is filming? I am talking about the B-roll of the assembly... Thanks for what you do. I think it is in the likes of Rich the guy who rebuilds Tesla cars. No large corporation is protected from the ingenuity of its clients.
It's a sheer resistance issue - the plugged cable with it's connectors have the right resistance to allow the phone recognizing a charge "happening".... though it actually is charging. It has to do with the software and how it's written - certain perimeters need to be served to make the phone displaying the info "phone charging"...
6:36 "thats about it for today" i was thinking 'no already'
What happend to your voice man
As a person who loves tech. These videos are the most entertaining things in the world
Holy heck! This is fantastic, I am inspired by your channel.
the most important thing has the jack?
Try to put dual camera
Now put a headphone jack in it
I don't usually comment videos, but this was an impressive project. Really liked interview part too, gave some depth! Good job!
Been subbed since 40k. And ur close to 1mil! Woah!!
Add wireless charging to a iPhone 4
Knowing you got a Chinese fan base you gotta at least try and get Chinese captions now
Absolutely brilliant!
yea
Just get a android
Will it also work for an iPhone 7 plus?
I suggest a leaf spring from ss steel springs instead of compressible tapes
Wrong way?
Mod a iPhone X
USB type c in a iPhone?!
Love your content! It's so awesome to be able to peer into such a completely different world that I myself would never have lived in or known about without this channel! Keep it up :D
Bro..love you..and what you make...the small dissapointment is your videos are half a day...so I have to watch multiple time..could you make it like a part1/2... One video every 3-4days..just a sugestion..I love you
That connection is very dodgy, I thought this as soon as I saw it, I think it will be problematic unfortunately. Lesson learned don't buy apple, great video.
Real nice just wouldnt it have been easier to use the 7 that you put the headphone jack into? Anyway real nice as always keep it up
Basically an iPhone 8 now lol
You deserve more subscribers then 900k subs
I follow your channel for quite some time now and i really love all your video's its amazing to see what you do and to have a look at the chinese market...i have a question, what is your experience with the Nintendo Switch? Because as you may know it doesn't have bluetooth and I was wondering if it is possible to build it in?
i would love to see a video of you upgrading the storage on a iphone 8 plus just because it is so new and i think there are gigantic options for the amount of storage
What is STRANGE PARTS ? JUST A YOUTUBE CHANNEL ? NAH IT'S AN ADVENTURE ??
i totally love these videos xD
Yeke should have his own YouTube. Damn he's clever.
any kits for a iphone 6?
Subscribed Your video is amazing Keep up the good work ????????
TBH, your videos are getting boring, every video has the same pattern. Bring some change.
Awesome work
Hey Scott! Could you create a dongle which does converts lighting to 3.5" audio jack? Essentially a lighting female to 3.5" male dongle so I can connect we can connect iPhone earphones into a regular audio source.
Great video again and good job Yeke really smart. Today i swithed for the first time a LCD from a galaxy j3. Not that hard for some people but it was the first time i swithed a LCD screen. I bought it online from China. So i like to fix phones but i am just a rookie. I only did a screen swap for a s4 and fixed a few s4 phones by swapping some elements. Now i orded another j3 LCD and hope to fixe more phones. I am a crypto currencie miner and i mine a currency called Electroneum with the phones i buy and fix. A lot of fun. Thanks for this video and can not wait for the next video. :P:P
I am currently at like 12:30 and he's almost finished, why is the video still so long? :D
Great project, but you could do same thing with cheap Qi receiver, just plug cable in charging port and stick receiver to back of the phone, much simpler than all this surgery
Satisfying edits
ARTILLERY ONLY!!!!!!!
Please can you give this phone to me with strange part logo Thanks for yak.nice technology.
do more factory tours please
Steve Jobs wants to know ur location
Really good efforts. Very impressed.
Now make a PERFECT IPhone that Apple has never been able to make: a IPhone with both Wireless Charging and 3.5mm jack.
Is it possible to do this with an iPhone 5?
iPhone 7 +
Nice but can you make it on huawei? Cuz i want to try it too
3:33 "ye"
Hey , amazing video , i have been watching you and waiting for you to make more cool projects , can you send me a private message or an email because i think i can give you a hint to make this very stable. and i you agree i am willing to risk my only iphone that have, take care and god bless you
Are u going to fix that white front on black case ?
What a brilliant young man. I would be interested in a 6s kit in the future if possible. Thank you for the great video btw!
These techy Chinese market-type shops must feel like candy-land for techy savy enthusiast like this dude.
I want to see an iPhone 10 with the headphone jack...
Can u do a q&a about yourself?
Incredible journey, What a impressive upgrade. I have one concern and i thing your struggle is base on that. The connection of the wireless power board rely only on flat cable contact touching the connector soldering. Soldering is not consistent in thickness and shape. This connection is far from being perfect and is prone to, miss connection and oxidation. Clever trick, but reliability??? Keep your good work.
Amazing job!!!!!!!!!
Cool project, and very interesting as usual :) Any plans for hacking an apple watch?
GOOD VID
Nice project ??
awesome video....wireless charging for android
Hello, hello, can you please jointly design the schematic of the automatic disconnection circuit? I want to know if you can, thank you.
Wish i can do in india
I added a pad to an acer liquid Z320, worked for a while then battery seemed dead would not charge. LSS a 1 penny cap shorted out in phone power filter killing the phone, batt etc.........
Respect
Very few YouTube channels will make you get off the computer and do something productive! And this is one of them!
Love your work! it's awesome!
How about designing and make a mass produce phone. better features anything else in the market. Call it SP01. :)
Is there any way you could install a screen like you have it on the iPhone X on an older iPhone ?
I actually enjoyed the ads haha
Nice informative video, like that you also your mistakes/failures. That's part of learning how it works ;-)
When r u gonna come back to dubai
These kind of mods are hard I did similar mod to PSP to add Video out and PS2 controller plug in used same kind of pressure contact method. your headphone jack used ribbon cable much more reliable but not possible in some situations. don't take it personally I reopened and tried my PSP mod kit many times back in 2009/2010.
Awwww man, I really would like to try this project for myself, I already have the tools and have worked on many iPad's in my time, but never an iPhone, if you still have a kit for sale by the time I can afford to buy a used iPhone 7 to try it on, you'll have a customer in me. It's so good to see this not only being produced, but being sold around the world in such a way that anyone can buy one regardless of where they are geographically situated. Good on both of you guys for the design and for having the will to sell this further afield.
I remember when I was trying to wire up an eternal power source for my iPhone 2 with a bunch of AA batteries. All I wanted to hear was that damn happy charging chime. So fleeting.
There no YouTube in China if it’s there we can gain more knowledge
Scotty's alive! Haven't heard from you in a while, was starting to get concerned!
4Real, i LOVE YOU, your videos are awesome and its good to see what is possible at home (with correct hardware and knowledge)
Get infinity display or 18/9 or 19/9 display on older iPhone
6s Pleeeaaaseee :D
Today you made my day!!!!!!
you should be sponsored by ifixit
DIY my ass...das majik
China man China ????
thank u for talking to the creator. its really interesting
You’re the best
Next video headphone jack iphone X
great video man...im commenting halfway through the video and i just had a crazy idea:- HOW ABOUT YOU TWIN-SIM AN Iphone??!!
Engineer question: how do you deal with magnetic shielding to avoid induction heating of other elements in the phone, or is it not an issue? I started a similar project on a ZTE and scrapped it because of crazy overheating issues whenever it was on the coil.
Next is Bezel Less IPhone 7
Why not make an iPhone X with a headphone charger & glowing apple logo Also iPhone 7 with wireless connection, headphone jack & glowing apple logo Strange parts Thanks
What an amazing job Scotty.. congrats!... Is a pleasure see you videos... Chinese engineers are in other level...
sure is cheaper the the 900 euros i pay 4 mine
I would love to see an Iphone SE version
u are in china..why u dont buy a p20 pro?
Can you please help us I am look to buy some products to sell in the UK as I am starting A wholesale business can you please help how to do this when buying from China
I think you should try to put a iPhone 10 screen on a iPhone 7
Woudln't soldering the cutout to connector solve the issue? But I used the external Qi charger patch on my SE below a plastic cover, but heating up is a bit of concern. How does this kit, heat up the battery?
now build the ultimate iPhone 7 with headphone jack + wireless charging + 512gb storage ?
Your video are so long but it's so interesting that the time passes away really loved your work can't wait to try it out
Dude iphones are for children do something more impressive
Grate job Ecco..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you pls make an ipone with usb type c?
Awesome Video Keep it up :) :)
I honestly live for these uploads.
Ah, I can smell the baked Apples from here! ;^) Seriously, THIS IS NOT A NEWBIE PROJECT! I'd suggest some step-up projects before tackling this. I think a laptop upgrade would be a great start. Start with the very basics: Upgrade the RAM and exchange the HD for an SSD. Make sure it works, then take it completely apart, every last screw and clip, then reassemble it. This will get you familiar with compact electronics, but on a scale that doesn't need a microscope. Next, get a cheap used phone with a cracked screen and replace the screen and battery. The main thing here is to get used to working at a tiny scale. Like, no caffeine, OK? Then, take it completely apart, all the way down, and put it back together. Don't start until after a full list of recommended tools for this kit has been posted. If you have none of the needed tools, plan to spend more on tools and parts than the cost of this kit! There is nothing worse than stopping a project in the middle to wait for tools to arrive (that's when teeny-tiny parts evaporate away). Don't be afraid to go cheap if you don't think you'll be doing much more of this. For example, my banana-sized hot air gun cost $8 on sale at Harbor Freight, and my "microscope" is wearing two pair of cheap +2.0 reading glasses at once (which works amazingly well). The Ikea JANSJÖ LED lamp is a decent work-light, so get two!
Nise due
I bet if there’s enough time and resources, this guy can do anything with his limitless tenacity. Inspiring.
Can you collab with jerry rig everything
Another great Video from you
Wow man you engineering the shit out of this things. Apple should hire you but i dont know that would be good for your creativity...
Super BGM Very nice!!!
Brilliant proyect as always, greetings from mexico city :)
Alrighty now i have a question for you this might be challenging and might not so here it is: Can you make an iphone 7-8 waterproof again if u have disassembled it before ?
Is that guys name really Wong Wey? I wouldn't ask him for directions.
100 units is like nothing for those chinese vendors. I think he is only polite.
3:44 PORTUGAL na TV crl!!!!
This guy is amazing one day scotty will make his iphone fly too :D
58 Apple Employe thumbs down
please make a video about modifying iphone 5s
Man I didn't even remember your voice!
1amp to 1.5 amp true small strip that touches the soldered feet of connector is quite n hack that will come to bite you eventually ... just saying.. keep flame proof mat close by when you go to sleep and nothing fabrics close by so you dont die while sleeping on house fire.. It will work for while , but dont expect it to last long as oxygen starts to corrode the contact points when it heats up and cools down and moisture starts to form on connector area..
Is there one for oneplus 6 ?
You're video is stir up my curiosity!! I want to watch more video:)
This is just amazing. Fantastic video Scotty! I really enjoy your creativity for contents. I dont even own an iphone and watched this through. Try expanding your horizon with videos for other devices too like samsung, one plus, HTC, etc. Good luck in Shenzhen!
1:56 Am I the only one who thought he is going to say Dremel?
So, will you make some iphone X mods? Is there something special in China for X's? Thank you for videos.
Awesome video as per usual, just one question. @ 5:35 you didn't disconnect the battery first. Any reason for this? I always disconnect power before I start work on any device. Thank Stranger Parts
Now get that iPhone 7 with the Strange Parts logo, glass back and wireless charging, and put a headphone jack in it! That's gonna be like a Strange Parts special limited edition iPhone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging.
Well done bro!!! Was waiting for your video!
A kit that wouldn’t look out of place on a production line is not DIY. Kudos to all of you.
here's a suggestion for a project related to this one, try adding nfc to a phone that hasn't got nfc.
Every time I see these videos I'm always distracted by the concept of recording people, recording factories, recording businesses. I wonder if the approval/rejection rate of "can I record here/you?" is higher/lower/same in Shenzhen vs. anywhere in the U.S., Canada, Europe, etc.
Make airpods
I think it would be good to invest in a gimball or something because the software stabilization is a bit disturbing
28:15 maybe the iPhone detect a chip in the cable and allows the charging. The wireless charger doesn't have any apple chip and it just ignores it
You should combined it with the iPhone 7 with the headphone jack!
no skip ads
dudee, love that process let's appreciate yeke for his idea awesome
China
Not to brag, but couldn't you just buy an iPhone 8 and put a different back glass on it? Just saying, it really does look like the Product RED iPhone 8 (nonetheless great video and great experiment!!!)
The blinking light mod is pretty sick lol.
Scotty these are the videos I love from you! There so great and this is what separates you from everyone else x
Wow that’s amazing
Making iPhones better than apple
What part of china is this? I don't remember
dying for this in the red in iphone 7plus
God! I love your videos.
China is wayyyyyy ahead ....
Hi Scotty I know I am 3hours late,but still great video keep up the good work Scotty what will be a reasonable price for an iPhone 6s Plus I would like to do some of your mods on it
I don't know why wasting your time On apple
Your videos are always a good adventure! Even for us Samsung users!
Next challenge: Install USB C!!
It’s not the same quality and you have to be specific in where you place your phone
By far the most interesting channel on youtube. Keep up the good work scotty!
i wonder if you could install a speaker upgrade thats more music focused , we have lost audio quality in recent years due to wanting slimmer phones i remember at its peak of mp3 / music phones with like the sony Ericsson walkman phones they had decent volume and quality with a some what decent bass but everything sounds a bit tin like these days. was just wondering if out in china they might have speakers that small that a good that are not being put into phones for some reason . just a thought ! :) great vid as always (or if not do a vid /series of doing as many upgrades to 1 phone as possible) :)
this guy can shut down apple if he wanted to
This is superb Scotty!
I mean if I had that china marketplace I'n my reach, a iPhone is the last phone I would buy.
Well done amazing video/+idea can you do like a part whare you tall us the prices pls
Try to add solar charger
1amp is too slow.
Wouldn't you need the glass backplate to install this?
800th COMMENT GREAT JOB
This is like Tesla trying to tutor Edison. Quite literally, when you take their motives into account.
you're lit bro.
me patiently waiting for a give away
Actually, this kind of wireless charger attachment is very common on Alibaba or other online shopping website, and u can buy it under 5 dollars.
Dude this was sick!!!!
Uhhmm can anyone enlighten me, if apple will soon catch after them? Coz i wanna make the same stuff but in Canada..
I loved your videos man keep going ????
Always wait to watch your videos
Another awesome video. Always happy when new videos come out from you.
In the next episode of Strange Parts: "How to add a bigger battery to an iPhone"
I love your channel you are so calm uaaa support from italy ????
Hey why dont you try to put together the headphone jack iphone 7 you made and 512 gig storage and this wireless charging pad in one phone and make the ultimate iphone
I love watching and learning your channel and even sharing a few long distance laughs. I do have a question... have you ever considered doing anything with androids?
Hey Scotty, Mike Boyd (somebody you might be aware of on YouTube) mentioned in passing he should try and make his own phone in his latest video. It'd be awesome if you guys could collab on something, might be worth trying to contact him! Love your videos Scotty, always excited to see a new post from you!
Finally new vid "!!! why so late !!
Another awesome video. Greetings from Chile!
Amazing video ! Thanks to your videos I’m now saving up cash and hopefully next year I will be walking around in same market -that’s my goal ! As I’m repairing phones on daily basis I very often was thinking about these kind of “extras” mainly just experimenting with parts swapping like Samsung wireless charger connected to lightening port iPhone 6 as you mentioned- soldering it inside to it (yes I manage to get it charging but with screen down - only issue was that it didn’t last long and you could see “something under screen ) as alu body won’t let signal pass ) .. anyway great videos man ! Keep it up !
Apple has to hire this guy for real he's doing what Apple hasn't or isn't
Very awesome video, i like how it is edited and all those shoots with people in the streets, good luck in the future.
Need plastic shims not soft foam
Another awesome video, thank you Scotty!!!!
I think you should make a video about upgrading/adding a new camera to an iPhone.
Wonder if you could take that glass back off an iPhone 8, and replace it with something more robust that could still be charged wirelessly. Even if it's just a cut out window over the charging plate covered in thick plastic. I dunno. hahaha
This video paves the road to 1M ASAP
I really love your videos, it's really great to see what is possible
Dear Apple,Hire That guy who designed PCB unconditionally.
@0:09 Okay, what about the software implementation? Does it work because of the internal connectors?
You are the only youtuber that i can actually watch the whole video without skipping! Keep up the good content!
You are new "Jonathan Ive"... ????????
Another super interesting video, Thanks.
Apple should hire people like these who keep taking things back to iphones.
First day first show....
cool video again! I love the videos, when they have a duration of >30 minutes. Sit back, grab some food and watch :D Maybe some more videos like 'Inside the RFID Stickers from a Chinese Cashier-less Store' would be cool :) thanks!
everything can be happen in China
Holy adds. sets of 2 adds back to back whyyy YouTube this will be your downfall
Best vid untill now, you really getting the hang of it!
Well done dude, yet another awesome video. That jaka dude is a genius!!! Give him a high five from me next time you see him
If the main difficulty is making a good connection around the pcb plug, why not design it to attach by reflow soldering? There is already solder on the plug and a little extra on the wireless ribbon with some user applied flux might make a reliable connection once soldred. If the ribbon were made with Mylar you could solder it directly with an iron. Alternativly, it looks like you were applying foam tape on top of the plug to press the wireless charging ribbon against the pcb? Why not make a thin foam backing for the wireless charging ribbon that gets compressed under the plug when the shield is screwed down?
Hello can you make more Headphone Jack Circuit Board
Waiting for the next video
Excellent video. Thank you. Your subscriber from Russia:)
You have a small link problem in this line: "Music (all tracks licensed through http://strangeparts. com/artlist ): "
Congratulation! Your iPhone is very very smart. It's very very cool your project and your iPhone is approaching an iPhone X! Congratulations on your project for iPhone 6 and for the commitment that you used to learn all this for only one project you've never touched ... Thank you for the commitment you have used...
I always love watching these vids keep it up man !
Why this is not on trending..!
Amazing video!! Been following your videos for a little while and really appreciate the effort you put to bring to us these very interesting contents. Will be in Shenzhen in a couple of weeks to buy a phone, could be nice to get some tips from you. Wish you loads of success!!
Add gddr5 ram in a phone
These videos always inspire we to mess around with my phone
Sir I want it.....
This is absolutely amazing!
I love your videos! I get every time very impressed by your work. Keep on the awesome work!!
Why don't you solder both flex at connectors ?? . Awesome video as always ?????? ,keep coming like these cool hacks .
this is what i call quality content
headphone jack and wireless charging both in an iPhone 7? :v
Everyone and everything in this video was awesome!
Here before it gets viral ?
Shame on you apple
Love the idea. You thinking on working with Android phones?
Hey Scotty, you're in China, but you're posting to YouTube, how do you get around the great Chinese Firewall?
Can't wait to tear down the phone I don't even own yet. Bought my kit and will have fun with my local repair guy, who will surely be begging for more.
Man you are Mr. Incredible!
Are you crazy man
Shenzhen is really a magical place imo
Why don't you put USB C in iPhone That's a great challenge Keep up
finally a video
??????…??
are you going to have a 7plus kit?
You are Genius.
Apple needs to employ this guy
Looks painful
*makes the iPhone 6 screen into a iPhone x
I just wondered why don't you use iPhone 8 shell instead
Oh my god i was waiting die this :0
Great, you incompetently installed a kit someone else designed, and now you're trying to sell it.
I’m a 16 years old boy... and i’m really interested about all your videos and project because you never give up and this take you to have all you want... I think you really good at this thing and I really love this thing in fact I’m doing high school of Electronic and I love Computer Technology... In future I hope to begin an Electronic Engineer and be good in this thing like you... DON’T GIVE UP, you are my example of life for this, really respect you :) P.S Sorry for my English... I’m not still good enough
Would it be possible to put a usb -c input in an iphone? faster charging and more universal?
Great video as Always! I think a really challenging and fun project would be to try and make a phone with all your changes into a single phone, so like adding the headphone jack, expanding the storage, adding wireless charging, and maybe even the light up strange parts logo with the laser etched back case. I think that would be amazing to try and get working even if you fail to get it working it would be awesome to watch anyway!
That restaurant looks good
Please add headphone jack to this iPhone!! ??
I would like something like this for the iPhone 5S.
Scotty u don't reply to our comments. Please make sure u do next time
Damm so now you can have a wireless charging, glass back and 800% storage iPhone 7. Let's call it the 7SP
Only at 26:41 but since it connects to the flex cable parts a "spring spunge" under the cable pressing it upwards would be more logical than pressing it down, there are a bit of air up and down there. Or add solder to the 4 pins on the wireless charger so they get a bit higher. Maybe you guys say that but just had to get this of my chest. Continue watching now :D
Such a unique channel man keep it up!!!
Is there anyway to flash iOS on to the android phone...in previous video while doing expansion of memory of iPhone you copied total code using one kit.in the same way you copy code from iPhone.... customise according to android phone hardware and dump in android phone....
May i have that phone hehe
How can u upload a video on YouTube if u live I China????? Isn't there censorship for yt in there?
When the video ends faster than you'd like- and then you realize it's almost 40 minutes long. Good job man
Seeing translate work that good in a situation like that is pretty cool.
Awesome man. Really informative as well! Keep up the good work
Wow, What a cool video and cool little piece he made! Thanks for making the video
China has like a 105-108 IQ average. I'm not surprised that they're so industrious and creative.
I’ve been thinking about modding my iPhone. I don’t want to have to lose my rose gold though...
You are now my favorite youtuber. I have also come to a conclusion that traveling alone is okay. I love the dedication and fun you put in every video. ????
I love you brother do you love me.
To show my support to your new video I watched all 6 ads that appeared in the video, and 2 of them were Nokia 6.1 Plus.
Interesting stove and water on a meeting table!!!
Chinese market is Awesome...
Amazing! I learn a lot from this video.
I was hoping he would do something like this, I love these videos
I bet these people already figured out a way to remove notches from phones.
I wanted you to try this for a pretty long time
hey dan reynolds
Many people say China is shit they don't know anything......but they doesn't know the people of China is really intelligent. People who says this kind of thing they aren't good themselves....
To be honest I got my matte black iPhone 7 converted into a gold iPhone 8. I haven’t seen any other person in Houston do this. Its basically a gold iPhone 8 with a black screen & home button, if that makes sense. So if I was to get the wireless pad I wouldn’t have to cut anything I’m assuming if my back is already glass.
I have literally commented on one of his videos saying that his next project would be about adding wireless charging to an iphone
Man you never fail to impress with your innovation and hardwork!! Good work.
Beyond the enthusiasm! The 1st video with over ten million views make me doubt this channel will only be the one hit wonder and can't make it to even 100k sub But I was wrong! Good content and good fanbase, all you do is so amazing.
how about a link where we can buy just the internal wireless charging board assembly for our own DIY?
Why dont you get a 90' hdmi connector for the microscope
Can you change lighting to USB type-C?
why do you only do iphones can you mod a p20 pro plz
"DIY" "DIY" "DIY" "DIY" "DIY"
Amazing ??
Where is the best place to buy used/ refurbished iPhone 7 in general thanks if you see this
First
Next video: how to add 3d face scanning.
Is it possible to make dual sim port for iphone 6/7/7p/6p
This is just like the glowing apple logo kit and it would be amazing if this guys could integrate this two mods into one cable refine it and sell it like a replacement back on eBay like the glowing logo sells
@blackgeek
Great video again! You should do the same thing for the OnePlus 6. The 64GB model already has a glass back and i would definitely try this at home!
if the connector is pressed against the solder joints wouldn't it be easier to apply some heat and actually solder the connector to the board? maybe redesign the flexpcb/cable to contain another connector to maintain easy swapping of the charging module. I dunno how feasible that is but I think if that's possible it'd be a lot sturdier.
@blackgeek
I have learned from u a lot patience and hard work.becouse of u hard u got follow.great video sir.??????????.
How about change that screen to an OLED always on display.
is there a DIY way of adding waterproofing back onto a phone once you recked the gasket?
This video is soo fake !! The Chinese guy was using a calculator ???
Typical Apple, you need a cable Adapter for wireless charging...lol
Please do a giveaway of that scratch back glass your signature on it
What is the blue mat @32.41?
Could you do anything other than iphone stuff? I know it's whats been most successful for you but there's so little to work with there.
Does it buzz when using headphones via lightning cable? Just curious
Man that guy is genius Both of you can can do things that we can't ever imagine
I like you d’ont give up easy
why dont you use a jewler monocle to look at parts in the store in more detail?
Great video thanks.. I can feel how much of stress you had it failed.. How energetic you feel when you succeed cz am a tech ??
Really love the new video style
I wanted to watch but had to stop 1 minute in. Fisheye lens and shakey camera made me motion sick and nauseous. Either or in the future please.
Wow so gorgeous with the new pent
You can use an app called test m and it will give you a full report of the phone and shows your what works and what doesn’t
You are an inspiration to engineers like us...great job.
8:50 reminds me of Louis Rossmann's style of videos
Yeke, you a a goddamn genius
Charge time? :D
Hi, I did it. I already bought it and installed it on my iPhone 6s. AND it WORKED, but I don’t know why after I put everything back and everything did worked but it makes the 3d touch on some area of the screen hard to press (iPhone6s) because of the wireless charging receiving module is a little bit thicker than the other parts of the iPhone, it’s thicker than the logic board and battery beside it. but just I said before, it just a little bit thicker. but still, it affects the 3d touch of the screen. So I spent around 2 hours to make it as thin as possible, I pushed it to make it as thick or as tall as the logic board and the battery beside it. so it don’t affects the screen. But I still didn’t make it. At last I contacted the store, they said they want to contacted the company. And then the day after they replied me that the company can’t make it thinner, they also said that the original LCD won’t have this problem. So i tried to install again, I pushed until the maximum and i suddenly broke one part of the module, so i uninstalled it. Maybe I should buy another one to tested it out. I also bought for the iPhone 7, this one is more more hard to do than the iPhone 6s... I put foam on it, put three foam that is thicker than the one that the store gave me because i lost it. I put back everything, didn’t work. Put some pressure, it works sometime. I arranged the position of the module again and again. still didn’t works...... gave up, just put everything back with the module still hooked up. And I found ANOTHER PROBLEMS, the speaker (not the earpiece) didn’t work and the taptic engine is very weird. And then gave up hahahhahaha, uninstalled it. BUT STILL IT’S A BRILLIANT IDEA. I hope somebody will helped me to make it works ??????
Please build a iPhone 7 with wireless charging AND a headphone jack
actually divide the video in parts as it will be easier for us and and it will generate more rewinue and u can do more projects and more frequently
Oh man I ve been following you since day 1, you are teh reaon why I am coming to China this month! but I still have some worries can you please help me out here or wechat me @hmoumine
He's back...cinema mode on
Wow, google translate in China. Every time I went back home on vacation, the damn Gmail wouldn't even work, it used to a few years back even after google quit Chinese market. When I needed to search in other languages, I had to use Bing or buy a VPN somewhere because Baidu somehow always try to give me Chinese results that magically contain some of the foreign keywords even German.
Hey, I'm really interested in this but I'm not really happy with the way the red glass backplate looks. Is it possible to use a iphone 8 plus backplate?
Do you have a collaboration with JerryRigEverytihng? Maybe that would be awesome! Thumbs up!
These videos are so inspirational!!! Thank you Scotty!!!
i bet this guy sells the phones that are robbed in my neighborhood
what do you use for your triwing screwdriver? I cant for the life of me find one that I can get to work
Love the videos all the way from India. Would be great if you have something nice for android phones, like adding RAM as that's the major issue with android phones (old ones)
6 ads..... 6.
So you made an iphone 8
New project idea: water resistant/proof iphone/Android.
Niggardly stop apple go to Android now
I am a Malaysian who know English and Chinese I hope that next time Scott can just record your own or any other people while he saying chinese so it will be great for me or any others people who know both language Keep on dude, you are the reason why i always hope to go Shenzhen
Well I get that it's not easy but I don't get why apple didn't do it until iphone x. I would probably buy an iphone with a headphone jack and wireless charging.(cant stand the notch and the lack of fingerprint sensor though in iphone x)And I am a hardcore samsung user. Damn you apple. You have so much potential but no vision. (Sorry for the rant)
I want one for a 6s
iPads Next!
If you could put a charging coil in your custom phone that would be aweseome
I would have loved to see the illuminated logo show up in the strange parts logo on the wireless charging phone too
I feel very honored to provide iPhone for this project. I love your Videos I will always keep an eye on your work. ???????????????????????b????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?? ????der~ ????
Man your videos never disappoint!
Most informative and best videos !! Keep on the good work scooty !! Much love from India ????
nice and keep it coming i love to do stuff that is not done on routine basis
add USB-C to iphone vote up if you want to see USB-C on iphone !!
Nice !!!!
Sell the 7 Plus kit please!
Much love from Indonesia,,,, ??
lots of love from India we like Ur work one request groom Ur self very well, good work
32:51
Awesome! A lot of other people have commented this but for the next video can you change the lightning port into a USB-C port?
Awesome work man
Scotty, consider doing video card modifications as well! This is the market I'm in, and not iPhones. With the new nvidia cards just releasing perhaps a good opportunity! Adding a custom cooler or custom VRMs for example
this really is amazing!
When everything works...but in minute 17 * insert meme *
Love the conversation with the designer, definitely the most interesting part of the video.
Love every video that you post, it's very interesting and awesome to see. Keep on the good work okay
Great video but maybe change the title to adding wireless charging to an OLD iPhone? Then it would make more sense. Idk just a suggestion. Great video as always! ??
10:47 trying to use a lightningcable with a Anker wireless charger, I saw that ??
Change the charging port to usb type c pleaseee ??
Only utube video that I watch for 40 min
It's always nice to see you fiddle around until you get it done. Appreciate your efforts to verify that it's repeatable! Keep being amazing :D
I watch your videos it awesome
Finly new video
I keep looking at your videos and all the stuff you do to make the perfect iPhone, but it already exists, it's called a Samsung. You could just buy it instead
Weird idea: Is it possible to change the lightning connector to something else ? (USB-C, Micro-USB or something more exotic)
I'm sort of an apple hater. But what you are doing is totally awesome. I've seen your previous projects : making an iphone from pieces, the custom back, the led logo, the 512GB storage version. Keep up the good work.
Just buy iPhone 8
Im guessing at this point you can probably disassemble an iphone with your eyes closed and one hand tied behind your back! Awesome job. Great video.
i love ur videos even tho i dont understand anything
VIDEO WAS AWESOME "RED AND WHITE IT IS SO COOL COMBINATION" AMAZING #INDIANsqad
Just have the iPhone 6S, but this makes me to want to buy the iPhone 7 to test this kit! Great video as always!
I forget that this video is 40mins long. You make videos where it’s hard to stop watching. XD keep it up. Also why not make a cut out in the Apple logo? For the wireless charging. Like layer the coils in a compact style.
He is really good I think even an apple care support guy cannot do this, that is the power of self-learning.
You're amazing man l really love to watch your videos but how do you use YouTube in China I think it's not working there??
is that part can work on others phones? that's a cool part.
He is really good I think even an apple care support guy cannot do this, that is the power of self-learning.
you are a good person, it's nice to listen to you)
9:12 I suspect installation would be easier, and more reliable if the bottom flex to the Lightning Jack etc was taped to wireless charging flex around the edges. Then install the mainboard, and plug the combined connector in.
Started watching it had 19k views, ended watching 40 minutes later and it has 40k views. AWESOME! Super video btw!
That’s is great Job ??
Just casually disassembling iphones in a market stand...
YAAAY!!! I was sooo looking forward to a new of your building videos! Thanks!
Awesome!!!
You’re videos are just unnecessarily long and exhausting out. Why don’t you get to the point
Had a pretty depressed day. Your video lit my day up a little. Thanks. :)
MOAR LONG VIDS
How do you upload to YouTube from china?
Amazing work "beam me up Scotty"!
Happy to see u back after a long time... Salute to ur work????????
I love your Videos
Couldn’t you have put all of the parts in an iPhone 8 chassis? That way the receiver would be behind the glass instead of it just dangling out of the housing
Damn to think Yeke missed out on a video showing how he created this. Would have been trending on Youtube for sure. Poor guy did all the hard work and Strange Parts gets all the views.
Scottie PLZ keep making videos. I honestly jump forward when i see you have posted new videos. You deserve so much more recognition for what you are doing. Thank you man.
Bloody Ham Fisted Gweilo Interesting and entertaining Scotty Keep it up Cheers
9:09 i have the same HDMI cable haha ur great keep going
INSTALL THE LIGHTS ON THE BACK AND THE SPEAKER PLEASE I WANT TO BUY IT
can you put ceramic back for iPhone x and USB? c
This video is going viral. 37k views in one hour
I admire how you work. Again after again you are trying to make sure everything works fine. I went to Gunazhou and shenzen. I will go again for my work and i hope we will meet even coincidentally :)
Love it !!! Thanks for your videos !!
Do an apple watch! :)
Scotty, I hope this doesn't come off wrong but it's kinda great when something fails in one of your crazy projects. It turns into a much better learning experience and consequently a much more interesting video than if everything had worked flawlessly. Now to put a headphone jack back in your wireless charging iPhone!
China is my DREAM COUNTRY! I hate it when people attach low quality things to China. Those guys are geniuses!
Pirate
Any chance of this getting a version for the Iphone SE?
2k likes and 10 dislikes looks like Scotty has a captivated audience
Go crazy and just make your own android phone. That way you're not bound to iOS and hardware limitations. You're in hardware heaven. There is an appeal to making apple stuff do what it isn't meant to do to flip the bird to apple... But I think you could do something crazier.
I am genuinely impressed by the quality and content of your videos. Keep up the amazing work! Love your new edit style with music and culture! (please add some chinese music too if you have the chance!)
Love your vids!
Liked b4 watching ????
You need some glasses!!
2 weeks later: How We Built The Iron Man Suit in China.
This is my favorite channel on YouTube.
????????You can get everything you want in Shenzhen.
wow, 14 of em have already been sold
Why is Furious Pete a tech guy now??
Niceone, keep it comming ;-)
Awesome work, does he planned do this also for an iPad mini? (probabbly not, but I've had to ask)
?????
Off-Topic Question: Can you transplant an iPhone 6s logic board and Touch ID into a larger iPhone 6 Plus? Has anyone tried that yet? My biggest worry (aside from making it fit) is the large screen may not be recognized.
Awesome Video!!! About time you did a new video, I was having Strange Parts Withdraws!!!!! ??
I'd purchase if it was available for iPhone 7+ and perhaps if we could customize the color and design of the shell, this is a great business idea!
YOU ARE THE KING!!!
Realy enjoyed The video!! Keep it going. Cheers from Finland
i know nothing about “hacking phone” but when i look at your video, thats look amazing! and i never bored to see your video ?? keep up the good work bro your fans from indonesia
Now slap a big heatpipe on that rear case
I HAVE AN IPHONE X SO.., I DONT NEED TO DO THAT BUT , THANKS FOR THIS EFFORT IN ALL OF US AND THE BIIIG WORK DOING ALL THIS. YOU ARE PRETTY AWESOME, ANS YAKA TOO FOR DESING THAT WOW.
Many people say that this will ruin your battery very fast? :/
Amazing mod
If you r visiting India,please do visit Bangalore (indias city for tech lovers)....I'm sure you will love it there and maybe you can try some projects there
Ask him to put the kits on Ali Express or ebay. I’d buy them for every model
I just checked out your online store and it's amazing. I'm just wondering how I can build my own online store
That notification is the highlight of my day
what app are you useing to translate in the start of the vid?
Hey is there a way to install a front flash in an iPhone?can u please work on that

How much did you buy the iPhone 7 for?
Hello Scotty! I am at Shenzhen now. I am interested to put it into my iphone. Which part of huaqiangbei is that shop located? Haha
this video makes me wanna live in china
Where can I buy this for my iPhone X? oh wait...
Nice to see you using a mod that is an actual product, is your earphone jack in the market already? are there "knockoffs" already?
Hey... We would like to see some ANDROID HARDWARE MODS too, please. BTW, love your hardware mods videos
Man why do these people always turn back and look so strangely at you
Oh, My, Gosh, The man, the legend!! The Myth! He's back at it again! Superb video! I thoroughly enjoy all your videos and I'm always looking forward for your next project! Greetings from Mexico!
You should make a strange parts iphone + wireless charging + headphone Jack + light behind the strangeparts logo
Seperti belajar dikelas, caramu membuka mata saya agar tidak menyerah dalam proses kesuksesan. Thanks strange part, to blow my mind know. Nice job man. And i appreciate. I dont care bout the long videos. Cause in your videos, its the education. Once again thanks man.
is there something like this in hong kong?
What about the water proofing after you open the case?
Again another fantastic video. Thank you for your effort.
first of all i love your channel you make good work can you please make a video changing the charger port to USB-C
great work,but why you teardown the screen?
Vídeo top como sempre né. ;)
You should start carrying a Jewelers eye Loupe. Get a necklace version so it's always with you. So when you get your chip thingies you can expect them properly
Now add FACE ID in this...????????
Watch your finger. ??????????
After seeing your videos I wanna visit shenzen and mess around with electronics!
Awesome job!
Superb Videos! Amazing content! Love the videos!
Never clicked on a video so fast...
An iphone that do not have it??????? The single iphone that have one is iphone x .
..and an ace adventure it was! Thanks Scotty!
i think if you reflow the solder pads and thiking them little bit would be better
Thumbs up for your attempt at speaking Mandarin ??
What Iphone you use personality ? If iphone 7 or 8 why you don't buy for youself Iphone X ?
Your production quality is on a whole new level. Congrats!
39 minute video. Gotta get the popcorn ready!
really really nice video
Now I want to make a completely transparent IPhone... Not sure if it is possible but i wanna try it.
Your video editing is awesome
Yeke is cute.
you make good iphone humiliation videos, I like it. With the sky high price, iphone never gave enough features it should
Just buy a iPhone 8+ ??????????
What is the name of the backpacker... Maybe I bought some phones from him
that was great video and i love the long videos
The side bit about "backpackers" was super interesting! Thanks to the fan, and good luck getting your shop!
I so have to buy this even though I'm not a iPhone user and you make me want to visit China!! Damn the people there are so cool.
hey what is the app u use for translating
Appreciate all your vids @Strange Parts!!!
Man keep up the great job. I myself have to left hands when it comes to electronics but watching you work is somewhat mesmerizing. Love the longer format too :)
Again with the iPhone.
Damn I need that for my 6 and 7
Wow
Make a iPhone SE with a glass back, more RAM/Storage and maybe a better processor. Please.
I don't know shit about hardware modification... but seeing you do this is satisfying AF. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
it's just nice to know that some features can actually be ubtained ... good job and thank You for the video  ????
gif that man a cookie !!
Fire ?? ?? ?? ??
you are such a nerd ! In a great way!!! love it! Hope you get to sell the 100 pieces! And Yeke open his shop !
Maybe you should add an USB-C port to an iPhone. This would be one I would love to adapt and have some real world usage out of it.
I want to build iphone 7 red and black with wireless charging ????
you can only put wireless charging on glass back, right?
I hade the same pression issues with a apple light at the back,it was working after several experiments but now my front camera its black ????
Maybe instead of relying on a friction fit which seems to be the weakest part of the install , solder it in directly ... By adding some solder to the wireless charging pads some flux on the connector , then sandwich the two together and heating the wireless charger fled from the back with your iron till the solder melts and it adheres I realise this is like the 400th comment on your video but here is hoping you see it
How much time do you required to take apart that iphone.. Just curoius. Love your project and all the cool stuffs.... ??????????
Please visit India again and do some projects.
Watched the whole video.....these things are so complicated but u made it..well done
just when I was thinking about how you will top of the previous video you come with this........?????????? love your work man....big fan........
Best if you have 8 or more gd ram please do a video for that
Your iPhone is the iPhone that people would really like
Put a fingerprint reader on an iPhone X. This could be a stretch or way to costly but would make for a very interesting watch. Btw Love the channel.
Is it even possible to make an iphone w a snapdragon processor?
When I watch Strange Parts videos, I do not skip the ads. :D Amazing video as always ????
Can you make face ID at iphone 7
Raspberry Pi 3 Project!!!!! (please)
Please add an IR blaster in Iphone.
Can you add wireless charger to my iPhone 6
UNFORTUNATELY Wireless Charging is Slow and very inefficient
40 mins long. I know what I'm watching tonight. Just ignore me while I leave this tab open until then :p
German shop: "I opened and on the first day already five customers came." Chinese shop: "I opened and on the first day I had 450 orders from 60 different countries"
Iphone 7 with headphone jack and wireless charging ????
hardworking pays off??????
Why metal back and wireless charging doesn’t exist?
Another great effort but time to start messing with real phones
Just love you bro!
Awesome, your vids always cheer me up. So glad you've uploaded again. Hope you're well? ??
Since you installed glass back Couldn’t you remove the camera ring that sticks out and make it flash with glass back
Need a StrangeParts and JerryRigsEverything collab.
Add wireless charging in Nokia 3310.
Strange parts: Adds wireless charging to an iphone -> Me: Struggles to install replacement battery. +1
wireless charging on iphone, got to watch this
Yeke should be working for a big smartphone company... Someone hire the genius..
brilliant af
I'm not an Apple fan but love this DIY's (Heikè) you do Scotty, Nice to see the Struggles too.. Great B-roll!
name of the translator app do u use?
im surprised that apple hasnt hired you already
???????
I love these documentary kind of videos, keep up the modding scotty ! Much respect.
If you read all comment please like.. I Watch all your video from start to end..
I am gonna give u one idea hope that its work and that would be your next project...its that buy same two iphone one icloud unlocked other locked tear it down transfer the unlocked hdd into locked one and locked hdd into unlock one and restore that both the iphone will be working
Love you ?? The best tech channel
What happened to your stuff in your flat?
Now go to apple service centre and ask them...'why the wireless chargn not workn on my iphone 7?'
Wow! This is an amazing idea! For all kinds of debugging purposes in almost any device these days! One could use this flex-between technique to breakout and probe all pins! Simple and really cool
how do you upload videos from China where all google apps in the region are banned????? including youtube?????
Now combine the jack 3.5mm with the wireless charging
Im gonna go to china for dog festival one day
I love Shenzhen
before it goes to trending ??
Just watching, still not finished. Two thoughts come up, wireless will work with plastic also, it doesn’t need to be glass. And translator Pro slowed you to pair with the other persons phone, you talk in yours, and the other phone received the translation. It’s a well thought out great app. I think it uses Bluetooth, so I believe it’s cross platform also so a cross andriod and apple will work. Ok, now to finish watching the video.
Thank god you are alive
Now, add a faster charging battery to the iPhone while designing your phone so that the battery is exchangeable
Great Vid Scotty, keep up the good work
just buy an 8 or X
Thunderbolt 3?
love your videos but hate your thumbnails
Apple doesn't want to include wireless charging and a headphone jack in their iPhones? Pff, just do it yourself!
Dam! Apple should hire him! Btw I watch all the ads to support you like 4-5 mins long in total ??
Love your videos
The cinematography ??????
No giveaway projects
Lol he triggered Siri on my phone when he said “hi Siri it’s me”
Add USB 3.1 to OnePlus 6
Dude Can you upgrade the back camera of your iPhone to 41 megapixel camera.
This was such a cool insight.
Which translation app do you use?
These vids are amazing!
Cool.
Dude is one of the guys that are chill and fun to hang out with
youtubers get it so easy when i do screen replacements or battery replacements there always 1 damn screw or the pull tabs on the battery rip:(
now do something with android phones pls!
i love the long video thanks for sharing ??
Also, i think one negative side to your iphone mods is that IF the phone is dropped there would be a high chance of it breaking your mods. But I appreciate your vids, theyre very educational and pleasing to watch.
I would love to see a phone with all your current mods: - Aux Jack - Charge Kit - Modded case with backlight - 64GB/128GB upgrade etc... keep the amazing videos coming!
I think the cable activate the chip in cable for charging
This is one of the best You Tube channels
“Yeah”
why do you only do iphones?
Yo dude why didn't you use ur original 512gb iPhone 7
Great work?? ,it would be awesome if there is face I'd unlock on the strange parts phone
Nice vid bro !!!
Lmao 7 ads, I'm not going to watch this on mobile
How many times you assemble and disassemble your iPhone?
can you add fingerprint on iphone logo in iphone x
Soooo many ads
Great video, love iPhones
Great video as always. Im not an iphone fan but i am a huge tech fan and find all of this stuff so interesting. I'd love to go to China one day. It looks amazing. I'd have a field day.
Genius level: 9999999 Adding another limb to iPhone and calling it just a DIY. Awesome.
You're getting closer and closer to building and manufacturing your own phone one day. Looking forward to buying the " Strange Phone 1 "
????????
This is one of the best "Technical" channel on youtube . you are simply best .
But but how about 7+?? And I don’t want your logo i want costume logo?? You know what would be wonderful: A kit of wireless charging+Custom glowing logo of 7 plus in red plz put this in store????????
Hope you're mapping out a place on your wall for that golden play button you'll be receiving soon enough. Congratulations in advance Scotty! Well done! Roll on diamond play button!
Your really don't mind the price ?if you search on chinese eBay taobao
o(???)d good
this is so badass. and i don't even use iPhones.
These are some really good videos
Awesome video. You need to put this in the headphone jack phone. Ultimate iPhone.
I appreciate the long videos than the short ones. Love the edits as well! Keep up the good work Scotty and the team behind him!
This is fun adventure.
Your videos really make me raise my views of Chinese tech
I have a Xiaomi Mi Note 3, you think it is possible to put wireless charging pad in this?
That is so cool dude love your videos
A translator haha
i like how you hand the money to wongway :) (definately not the way it is spelt)
I was planning to do this on oneplus you guys think its possible???
In love with the vids
apple will get his ass soon or later
Loved the editing on this episode. All your videos are brilliant. ??
Shenzhen looks like a nice city
Scotty, you have supreme sneaky camera skills :)
You should try upgrading the memory of a Nintendo switch. You could use that flash memory reader you bought for the iPhone and get the new chip from one of your failed iPhone experaments.
Bro I have some bad news... I think you may have voided the guarantee on that iPhone 7....
It's like you have a magic!!!
This is another I usually never comment comment, but dude, your videos are amazing.
I should've bought iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 case
I don't think there's ever been a time where I haven't dropped everything I was doing to watch one of these videos.
Yeke, bring us the headphone jack \0/
why not do it on an iphone 4 or 4s? it already has an glass back ;D
Here before 15,000 views
Standard wireless charge pad with pass through port or extension cord for usb micro, c, and lightning?
amazing
Your content is amazing
When dad uploads ??
This should go to trending
the power draw is just for the charger there is a big loss in the air so the charger is drawing 1 A but the actuelle phone is charging at a much lower current !!!
I have a very different question. Could the microscope cameras work to take photos and videos normally with a normal objetive adapted?
You never give up, do you?
YEAH
just my two pennys to tour assembly and testing methods: you cannot really expect die charging to work reliably when you dont test it with the phone fully snapped back together, as the connection is a pressfit and relies on the pressure applied by the screen when fully assembled.
please make a netflix documentary
Always excited to watch ur video?? nice work .. keep it up??????
I can't afford a I Phone
who said that Steve jobs is dead?? huh?? this is him....
HACK MOAR ANDROID PLZ Do any of your friends in Shenzhen hack Android stuff? Maybe you could do a collab with them?
Didn’t think I’d wake up to this!
Always full of ideas ?? Keep it up Scotty (and Strange Parts crew of course)! ??
Glad to see another vid! Missed you! Love the vids, channel & your cinema photography. Pretty great. Can't wait for more vids. Cheers, A
Now add USB-C to a iPhone!
I think Apple really hates you
Nice Scotty again! Everytime I see one of your videos I can't wait to be able to move to Shenzen.
Apple really need you guys
Which app u use to translate from English to Chinese
Would you consider building an android phone like you did with the iphone?
The quality of your videos had improved so much!
Nice music
These things already exist ...u can buy them in 6 to 10 bugs on ebay...but they are super unreliable.....you make 39 min long video on this.....???????? What happens to your NFC tag project you told us in last video...I was super excited to watch it...but now I am....??????????
Brilliant B roll footage and editing, I’d hate to see your timeline. Any chance you could post a link to the blue work mat you used in the later part of the video ?
Bro I support you soo much keep up the good work. You are better than everyone
You do some awesome work, man, I only wish you did Samsung phones too,... Seeing as the apple is a slowly dying product, lol
You know how to make someone's day! Keep up the work dude!
This guy is a beast Wonderful work bro !
Is this even an "iPhone" anymore? (X)Doubt. Again great video :D
Wondering if it on my oneplus 6 ??
it would be awesome if they can do it on iphone se
That's so cool and the shots of the city are filling the video beautiful
This is like a TV show
Son glad to see the strange parts posted a new video notification
Im from Portugal and there is Cristiano Ronaldo on TV at 4:41 xD
It's funny how many things you've changed in the markets while being there.
Absolutely love these videos! Great job! Keep it up! ??????
we want fingerprint scanner on iphone X??????????
I would actually buy only if there is your custom case on it??
my contry is called DIY
It would have been more useful if you had done this to a phone that isn't a useless garbage apple product
Another easier type of this thing works with a lighting cable plugs directly into the charging port of the phone and all you need to do is just stick that thing on the back of your phone.Moreover,it sells on taobao for 40 yuan,which are 6.5 US dollars.But the obvious shortage is that when you need to use headphone via the transfer,you must unplug that cable in the charging port.
Interesting one!!!!!!!????????????
Before 10k views ??????????
What do you think about dual speaker in to your phone?
I love your channel Scotty! Very entertaining. I find myself hanging on for the whole video. You do great work Scotty (even though I'm a strict Android guy). I appreciate your great respect for Chinese culture too. I look forward to your next project. Lots of love from Canada! ??
you are truely amazing and inspiring sir !
I love your videos man
Can you buy different color housings?
I need this on my 6S+, already have the led light mod.
You are the happiest guy alive, and never get frustrated when things don't go well at first! I love it.
this channel.. its my favorite on youtube, you are so sympathetic and with a great personality, you make me want to buy a iphone just so I have the same as you, and i am a heavy pc masterace person.
Cool cool
FINALLY THANKS MAN
24:00 i think hardware mods are easier than software mods also can u maybe look for some strange ps4,Xbone parts u can show or other interesting hardware
Thanks God. He's alive!
Next time, please build an USB-C Port into your iPhone 6s! Greetings from Germany ????!
Dude you should work on Apple company
I love it! :D
Gorgeous project! Love the others too! Also could you do an iPhone with a fully transparent glass back? I feel like this would look awesome. ??
Wow, Shenzhen is indeed a magical place.
Cool
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
How many years would it take for a DIY iPhone X?
Great video, like always
God you're so positive,enthusiastic and you are always smiling..you inspire me a lot..??????
Wow cool!

Great video, Scotty. Nice editing too
I love your videos I wish I could go to Shenzhen
What if i would charge by cable and wirelessly at the same time.
good video
Request, Case cutout to work with existing glowing logos, and iPhone 6 version link! My iPhone 6 has a glowing Apple Logo, and Lights to the music, this was the only other thing I wanted!
Absolute best youtuber on the planet. You rock!!
3:45 ye ye ye

Make a touch screen Nokia brick
To be Frank, it looks alot like the samsung ones. Very impressive honestly. Smart move.
Very cool, would love to do this to my Iphone 6s :)

Could you do this on the iPhone SE?
again again and again, you're great man, iPhone enginer must be watching you now ??
Yo scottie how is life in china? & nice video :D
Wireless charging is the best way to charge phones
Patience yong one! Lol. Like the WTF
wow damn never clicked on a vid so fast cooll love your vids
Wow that is genius. Who ever thought of that is amazing.
Scotty, you should do a face reveal.
Bro you should try out some other display to iphone like 18:9 Panel to the i phone it will be awesome with iPhone x gesture means the ios of iPhone x????????????????
I always wanted to add wireless charging to any Android
I'm really glad to be subscribed to you. Thank you so much!
Your videos are always so informative and relaxing.
1 year too late :)
I love how you take iPhones to higher levels.
Ah yes some good content to watch after work ??
The idea itself is so cool. How much further can it be customized i wonder?
How Do you even do this??? xD
Wow this seems awesome!!!
How will this mod affect reception??? iPhones use the back metal case as part of its antenna system.
Comment nr. 108 ! Nice :)
Cooool! I want to wirelessly charge my iphone 6s ??
We love you
Your Chinese is improving :)
102 Ali from iraq?
The camera and composure of your videos are pure art
How nice he is!!!
If he can do it how come Apple can't? Well apart from money but this thing is turning into like THE ultimate Iphone!
Dear Strange parts, can u customs ip6 for me with my design? I love to buy it.??????
Not even half way through the video and I already love it
You can sell the all part of iPhone it can help me and all please do it we have to do it please let you do it
Perfect timing, just as food got ready! Watch Strange Parts and have good food, best evening ever! :D
O.k..now What about Android ( Linux) not iphone ( ios)
I love how you had added little bits of Chinese culture in between the technical Parts ... brilliant video
Couple more of these crazy videos and you'll have something sorta close to a Samsung from 5 years ago!
YES FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
early
Finally new video!
I hate talking about money, but I just wonder how much does these projects cost. How much does the "recycled" phone cost?
Let's go SE))
The shots you take of Shenzhen are Gorgeous!!! Makes me wanna go there one day.
niceeeeeeeee!
A new video from Strange Parts, I click 'like' then watch.
YES, another video from Strange Parts. Love this guy
Here before this video gets taken down by Apple and the SJWs
What if you have a jet black iPhone 7 do you then need to get a custom back to get this to work with the wireless charging?
That's so crazy that you guys are using google translate speak to talk to one another. That just seems so futuristic to me for some reason. Great video again!
I watched you video with Linus. Your negotiation skills were lacking bro. You can always get a better price. If your going to live over there, maybe it’s time to speak the language. I used to live in Shanghai for two years and studied and spoke as much as I could. Either way,I enjoy your videos. Do a street food video. They don’t all have to be tech videos. Just a thought.
We learn every time u upload
Can you add wireless charging to a normal Android phone
I think it would be easier to put it on the 4S because it has glass back right?
Here before this video goes viral
This is good! Keep it up.
W??W
i dont own an iphone or can afford it neither do I have any experience with electronics development. I do some web development. But I still love to watch your videos being in Pakistan china seems to be so close but feels so far.
How about changing the lightning port to USB Type C port
Strange Parts is one of the greatest YouTubers out there.
Crazy idea, add an analog controller and shoulder buttons to Iphone- basically turning an Iphone into a gameboy.
Yess finally a new video to start the day
Keep the videos coming.
Finally
you should get backtrack 5 for android and learn how to hack wifi
I bet on 1.5M views within next 48h :)
Early on a viral video
saludos amigo
Please assemble iphone x!!!
I'm a simple gal, I see a new Strange Part vid, I click it
yea
Sir for how long u have been living in China ???
"its 2020, we're going to add a stove and a dishwasher to my Iphone... in China."
Wow
For me it more and more feels like you should get a Samsung S8 instead of all that work... cheaper/wireless charging/aux ;- )
40 minute video to add wireless charging? lol wtf it's easy af
Scotty, try upgrading an early 2000s apple mp3.
Woah! Does this support Fast Wireless Charging or just the standard Chi wireless like the iPhone X?
Those people staring at you at the start ????????
What did you just do
I just write something for likes.
How We Mao-de a Super Communist iPhone ? - in China
??another like
Oooh, almost 40 minutes???? Can't wait to watch it when I'm out of class
Now change the charger port to USB-C
Strange parts is back!

Hi
Does the heat pipe have some water in it?
Hi, What temperature do you use the heat-gun at?
I cringed when you scratched the metal
Can I get 1
I watch most of his teardown's because of the satosfying sound of pull tabs but unfortunately there's no pull tabs here so meh ima pass
5:19 OR you could just disable Bixby and never have to damage or remove anything Edit: btw that was the power button you were contemplating murder on, definitely don't damage that.
Nokia has had that variable aperture mechanism on their camera phones since 2001 or so! I was able to hear it click as it switches aperture! and you can definitely see it
plz any b0dy tell me s9 best or s9plus 0
Hi friend
S9 plus durability test
vibrator
5:12 That's not the Bixby button because that's there under the volume buttons (on the other side of the phone) :D
You can put back camera and will work, but don't have any focus
watches video on S9 plus
U just destroyed my dream phone ?????? Thats it i am gonna unsub!
Realme 2 pro test pls
You can toggle off the Bixby
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" - Zack 2018
I will trade you a brand new iPhone 6 for the Galaxy S9 that you tore down
Glad you're doing those vids, I can get good RMA with them lmao
Who is watching this on galaxy s9 or s9plus?
Watching this on Samsung Galaxy S9 lol
5:12 u wrong :v, thats the power button, bixby is on the other side. Are u sure you want to murder it?
Where can i get this double sided tape?
i love how u roast apple in the most gentle way possible
My camera is getting replaced. Will my water resistance change?
This is an amazing, a very informative video. I learned a lot of what's inside my S9 (plus). Didn't know the mechanism behind the variable aperture and the the flash that is now with diffuser, until I watched this video.
Does the camera have a 10 bit sensor like the LG v30?
No lithum polymer same old cheap litium ion battery
Aaa q hijo de puta eres!!!
I'm tread down my s9 is better Samsung is better company than others
it would be nice to reassign the bixby button to turn on the light instead.
Uhm.... you made a very stupid mistake Jerry! The button you called the Bixby button is in fact the power button! ?????? Bixby is on the other side under the volume button??????
1:20 mini go pro
When you reinstall all back , is the phone still ip68? Everything is sealed again?
Crazy apple disses????
Hi Jerry ! Hope this message finds you in good health. I am very much fan of your videos and i always watch your videos before buying anything. I am planning to buy POCO F1, hopefully you will give us a cracking video soon which will help me to take decision Thanks Ziaur Rahman Bangladesh
yeah....i want to desconnect Bixby cable......
Nice video, can the lens be changed...from a 12 mp to a 16 mp?
Man i still got the iphone 2g
Ð?t m? th?ng phá ho?i
Who else is watching with s9
You l see that in iphone on 2020 hahah ????
please do a S9+
My s9 keeps pausing the video
So does the s9 not have that water cooling thing anymore?
I have the purple s9
Sony camera. Not Samsung..
"Apples are 2 years behind so you'll be able to see this in 2020 in an iphone"... ??
Jerry bro it's very nice to see your video. I need a help bro! Today I accidentally inserted the ejector pin in the bottom mic hole and pressed gently to pop up the sim tray.Soon I realised that it is the wrong action.I checked the mic sensitivity and it works fine! But am bit confusion about the water resistance bro!Does this action causes any fall in water resistance? Please respond to this comment bro, heavily tensed ??
hello jerry , pls could you do a durability test on the xiaomi mi 8
Apple removed the headphone jack and said it's for the future. *includes dongle for headphone jacks
Where can I buy the S9 plus battery
Just pop a little piece of kapton tape on the contacts and bye bye bixby, and its completely reversible. ;)
Trash phone tho
Give it to me please to teardown and look I am an electronic enthusiast like you
Kerren.. ??
Thank you for sharing the video. That was educational.
i learned that glass is glass
It's like my heart teardown.
5:13 Dude that is not the bixby botton?????? if you disable it your phone won't wake up
4:19 hahahahahah
Nlw only they put the heat sink ??
WOW that is a lot of work to replace the battery. I hope it maintains a charge for the next 5 years considering how much they charge for a new phone.
95% battery capacity retention after 2 years? That's funny with wired charging and just ludicrous if using wireless charging.
Where does Samsung claim the 5% capacity loss of the battery?
??????????????
"Apple are about 2 years behind so you'll see this in 2020" Don't forget when they do add this feature that they invented it. Not to mention it's a brand new feature that justifies the phone costing 1/3 more than any other on the market.
?????, ????? ?? ??????? ????????!????? ?????????? ??!
5:12 that is the home button!! :o
Lol at 6:43 it said 9 o'clock as this is the s9
Wasn't the "Bixby" button you were talking about the power button? I'm using my s9 right now and the volume was on the other side and the Bixby button is right underneath it. I don't know, I'm probably wrong.
5:24 dont lie to us
I wanted to ask about the purpose of the hole beside the SIM card lock (the one on the top right corner), because I accidentally inserted the pin in it instead of the the SIM card slot.
These are the best apple roasts he's done
Try the lenovo tab 3 10 business. Durability Testm
Officially the best looking clear phone
love my s9+ is just amazing
So you send out old broken phones parts ?
He is roasting apple????..every 2- 3 minutes..i can't stop laughing????
Too many apple potshots
Test your phone
Love your videos and hate modern phones the sam time! Making a non removable battery just to make the phone "water resistant" & not water proof is not a justifiable reason reason for me! They should made if real water proof and add over 7kmah battery if they will make in non removable.
plese give me this phone 8093345873
Now send it to me. For further tear down ??
Its just sad to see how a person saves months of money to buy phone like these they just buy couple of these just to break them.
We're still waiting for the vibration motor video!
Let's just say I dropped my phone outside in the rain for like 20 mins maybe and my phone did not get destroyed hope my water damage thing did not change??????????
No Flash diffuser is a deal breaker for me
Am i the only one that noticed that he actually showed the power button instead of the Bixby button?
Yaampun, buat gw aja
676 Apple fans :D !
baldy
/l l /_ l __l
Jerry wreck everything
I think this is not samsung s9 phone
le li 90000 ke phone ki
Wt duspin is this?
please give away
Watching on my S8+,nothing impressive except the camera and the Cpu
He still loves Nokia more than Samsung ?????
Jery can you please do a warning when you make the scratches sound on your mobiles because i get goosbumps when i hear scratch sounds
Where is the different type of phone vibrators video? I've been waiting for that video for so long now.
???? ??
"Apple's usually two years behind so we will be seeing this on an iPhone at around 2020" Lol
It's not murder its just removing Bixby's larynx.
I've had my Galaxy S7 since it came out, and I've had my Galaxy s4 since it came out. Both of the batteries work amazingly, and I have never had to replace them.
I wish it can switch to any aperture.
Samsung should start using better haptik motors like the one found in Pixel.
Watching this with my s9??????
using that razor blade to pop the camera off made me squint and feel naked not wearing protective eyeware. good video +1
BUNU bana gönderirmisin lütfen
Wait where can I get the clear backing for phones?????
Why the camera failed?
I don't know how my S9+ camera cover glass broke, but can you help to find the best product that would replace the glass cover without effecting the water resistance of cellphone...??!!
HI IM A FAN I HAVE A S9+ AND I DONT HAVE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT THE BIXBY BUTTONAFTER A FEW WEEKS
You look like a monster but you are funny ??
Good excellent
watching it on s9 is painful for me.
dbrand is a scam... it doesn't do anything to protect your device from fall damage and try taking that s*** off after a year... it's a nightmare lol...
Does anybody else cringe when he scratches the phone ??
Apples 2 years behind. XD
Two jabs at Apple in one video means you lost my subscription... it’s not necessary and you are clearly showing your bias.
Damn. Do you have to make a jab at Apple in EVERY video?
I want that phone.. Even without cameraa
The black camo skin in slippery I do not suggest buying it!
Will you give me any teardown phone ?
"bixby's little home" is on the other side, that was the power button :))))
Stupid!!!!
2020
Camo skin for your phone, work too well, you never find it again
Very honest .
when samsung saw this video how you disassembly and assembly back may be he will be tears drop ????
Is this his job or does he do something else and this because he buys pretty much every phone
I've had my s9 not even a month and the speaker is blown and bixby constantly crashes.. and of course my wife didn't get the insurance when she got it...
That fucking SSKSKSKRREAATTCHCHCHCH sound. Eugh.
I've had the S9+ for less than a week and I think my charge port is already broken. Tried multiple charges and multiple outlets, doesn't communicate with the computer. Tried to turn it off then turn it back on but it wouldn't turn back on except a blue light was on when the phone was off. Doing the volume / power button did turn it back on. I upgraded from HTC 10 so I don't have a wireless charger to test on yet. Thankfully I can take it back. Other people are having the same problem, what would cause this? The rubber tab on the otterbox does seem to put a lot of pressure on the cable plug, that's my best guess.
I'm tempted to do this just to disconnect the Bixby button??
$18 for a piece of paper with glue? No thank you xD
"I'm not suggesting murder, butt it's possible"??
The way he scratches things stresses me the fuck out... but then his soothing voice calms me down again... ;x
Give away this phone after test or salr
I watched this video on my s9+ ,my phone cringed the whole video
Gluing in the battery is just evil.
i'm one of the unlucky person who bought an s9 that have the dreaded "dead zone" problem, and samsung said they wont replace it. they can only repair it for free :-(
What about clear glass???
HI SIR IMA 9 YEAR OLD KID AND WHAT IS YOUR DAILY DRIVER MINE IS THE S9+ MIDNIGHT BLACK
And now sell as "slightly used"
Suggesting murder ????
Can someone buy me an s9 plus
Tod diya kutte ????????
Apple is TRIGGERED!!!!
Takle le pass jyada paise hai
Hey Jerry, can you do a Xiaomi Redmi 4X durability test n teardown. (Repairs included)... Much appreciated.
Am confused.. so all of the parts are attached to the screen? Iphone are attached to the back glass. If I remember correctly, in your most durable phone of 2017 or whatever you said that iphone are the least repairable but in my opinion. People most breaks the front glass not the black glass but whatever what am saying is that am confused to how replacing the s9 screen differ from replacing the iphone back glass?
nice
Teardown Galaxy S9+... I see you all videos alltime.
Someone buy me an S9... I'll suck yo dick!
Lets see how long it takes Samsung to copy FaceID
Roasted apple lmao
He makes the teardowns look so easy
i remember the nokia n82 and i think n8 have something like that in the camera.. i hope you explain the different if there is a different
stil waiting for that ''vibration motors'' video Zack
I think it is 1.7 not 1.5
nice video bro...
Every flagship teardown hurts my poor heart.
Jerry You amazing man. So interesting to these phones getting tear down. I can go and on watching them.
Why does The s9 only have 3000mAh but The s7 edge 3600?
Who is watching this in an s9 or s9+ device ?
what are magnets
Wow, I am amazed! I’m subscribing to this channel
Dude variable apature was in my Nokia n8 back 2011??????
Wow is that a Nintendo Switch colored dbrand skin at the end? Damn that's sexy.
Beast!
Can you change s8 camera to s9 camera
Could you please send me one of your s8 or s9 for me for exploring the internals I don't have enough money to buy one I am a electronic enthusiastic person if you send me it will be a great gift for me
Amazing!!!
Awesome.
I love that lego engineering, smartphones are so impressive to look at.
Can you teel me please the double sided tape where can i find or if you you have a link to share... Please. And how many mm must be the tape? Thanks....??
Can you do teardown for xiaomi blackshark.. I was kind wondering what was behind the back cover..pleasee??
Watching it on my s8 plus...!!
when ull do of nokia 8 sirroco
still cant get enough of the teardown with the variable aperture on the lens :"(
Thumbs up for Samsung
I'd like to see Samsung be as dedicated to Android updates as Google is with the Pixel phones. Technically it's Google's fault for handing copies of the keys to too many phone makers and not regulating them.
great video, king of random brought me here thanks Nate
fuck. technology is amazing.
I wanna see you do a tear down of a robot.
Tear down king.. awesome:)...loved it... still hurts to see the beautiful phone being ripped...
Some one pls tell me how can i know that the phone is repaired or not planning to buy somewhere cheap.
"Apple's is usually 2 years behind you prolly see this on 2020" ??????
Enough!!!! Stop with the D-Brand shit. D-Brand SUCKS!!
Just wondering, does anyone know the manufacturer or part no's for the little lego connectors he he mentions? They look incredible!
best youtubers ever, thanks
Best Teardown video till now....AWESOME
I am like what the hell man I saw you tear down a iPhone x with tears( only for the phone) and now this one... So you got so much money huh.... Donate to someone who deserve but they didn't get.... Spend it on someone's education dude
the selfie camera looks like a mini go pro!
now your phone blind
Bro you mollested the poor s9
This was hard to watch!!!
Whats that lense next to the front facing camera?
APPLE IS 3 YEARS AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION!! STOP PROVIDING WRONG INFORMATION DUMB????
Hi sir you are a genius in dismantling the phone????
@jerryRigEverything Dear Jerry!! Since i am no mechanic, just like your tearing down and ripping cells phones. "Bro" Your voice is very soothing i fall asleep while listening to you last night. why don't you starts singing lullaby not kidding LOL just kidding :D
Put the camera back in place without lenses and you will see magic already did it with S7esge and S8.
But a diffuser makes the light less powerful
Hey Jerry can you do a tear down video of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo please
The microSD slot can actually take 2tb.. All microSD slots on high end phones take this much since the LG G3.. But still no 2tb card though??
?????????????????? ????
funny how u base all the tech around iphone comparison, can u imagine apple doing that? oh apple has no need as samsung is just another android with half an iphone processor
the phone is a8
DUDE wear a Gloves. It will look professional
is 95% battery retention after 2 years also for Note 8 or just s9/+ ?
Your a dick, always bagging on Apple!!
You are a doctor for these phones man ! ... nice surgery doc !
Samsung also claimed that Note´s battery won´t explode you know?
Your head looks like a white chocolate cadburys creme egg
Please give me a s9
Can you put ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 and Redmi note 5 pro under test.
Samsung por fuera y por dentro es feo !!! Su tarjeta más fea
MURDER BIXBY!
make video on xiomi blackshark teardown video
Can we please agree to not say those cable unclip like little Lego? Lego is inseparable lol
"Vibrator explanation video"....yes please
I have a serious question. If you replaced the camera in a phone with a higher quality one (say replace an 8mp camera with a 12mp) would the phone take higher quality photos, or would they still be the same default quality?
Hi there! I wated to take the sim card out and accidentally placed the needle in the upper microphone, not the one near the mouth. I didn't press it too hard. Is there any chanses to brake somethin there? The phone is a samsung galaxy s9+. Thanks!
Really, nobody going to mention "vibrator explanation video"?
...If it had the same selfie cam as last year (and I saw that video), then why didn't Samsung go and enable the OIS? Strange... That means to date, the HTC 10 (which I have and will probably keep until it finally dies) is still the only phone in existence with this particular feature, which is very helpful with selfie videos...Not even its successor, the U11 has it... Getting back to the Samsung, maybe selfie OIS will be something that will appear on the upcoming Note 9, or next year's "10" iterations of the S or N-Series devices... Even HTC is considering bringing that feature back for the U12... Here's hoping, anyway...
No wonder Samsung used such a small battery. They have the mother board spread out all over the place. I saw that Huawei concentrated most of them it the upper part of the phone so they can use a much bigger battery like the Mate 10 Pro.
Apple ist usually 2 years behind????????... Nice video????
Jerry rig ....your voice is mind blowing really superb
Jerry you worth it ????
Do the s9 plus +
Pls give me s9 plus plz
Hey jerry do you know which adhesive tape is best for water resistant or know the name of the special adhesive tape
I hate Bixby and I hate that you can't deactivate it or that you can decide which app to put on there
It is difficult to repair. The same is mate 10 pro. It is a real problem if the display is proken. Nevertheless I love Samsung
Would you make a video about Samsung A8 2018. I would like to buy one but Im not quite sure.
Do huawei p20 durability test please!
What about NOKIA 2018 New Flagships..
Hello @JerryRigEverything Great video ! I was wondering if it would be possible to use the camera outside of the phone with a long cord of sorts. What cord type would be needed to connect the camera to the motherboard if so? I have a severe physical disability but love doing photography. I did some decent work on an S3, but my body keeps getting weaker and phones keep getting heavier. I'm trying to think up small lightweight alternatives, and an S9+ cam on a stick seems like the best option on the market that I can find if it'd work still. Thanks!
Yeah, 2 years from now, we'll see Apple claim variable aperture is innovation by them.
Apple 2020: Now We are removing The Screen! Because that shit is so old school!!!!
waiiting xperia xz2
S8 or S9?
Did you check the front camera to see if it is using OIS ?
How much bigger is the S9 earpiece speaker than the S8?
Eh man why you had to scratch the surface. Gave me goosebumps.
Apple be like. O YES I LIKE THIS GUY, GIVE ME THE TECHNOLOGY.
Lets fire some really hot heat waves at the battery What a great idea
Cool camera
This man murder phones instead of giving it to me. ??..i will raise this issue in united nation phones rights commision.
I want that camouflage cover give the link
Very informative
Where can I bay display for S9?
try p20 lite
You Should definitely do a Moto X4 teardown/tests. Would love to see it.
Instead of tear down , you can also gift it to me ????
Apple will implement variable apertures in 2020??
Is that Galaxy S9 plus for your usage?? I mean why didn't you teardown that??
"Probably because it just doesn't exist anymore" ????
I dropped my s9 from about 3 feet, it had the sylicon case that came with it... could the fall have made any damage to the internals, or the camera?
Thank you @JerryRigEverything for the teardown! Always doing great work. Just a thought, is it possible you were looking at the power instead of the bixby button? Looks like bixby and volume keys are all in one flex cable. Sorry if I am wrong.
You deserve more subscribers so I cloned the button so that’s why you have 1mil subscribers TrUe StOrY........ maybe
I like your videos. Mr Jerry nicely done
Can u make a video about xperia xz2 pls?
Xperia xz2 bend test please i bought it feels realy solid heavy!
JerryRigEverything - What's directly perpendicular to the microphone holes? Looks like the waterproofing and mic are parallel to the holes... Curious because I accidentally stuck the sim tool down the top mic hole (great design, Samsung), it went straight thru til it hit what feels like the chassis.
In another words when phone start to give you problems get rid of it because every year gets harder and harder to fix them yourself..........
I can't wait until someone releases a phone with a fully variable aperture, from f/1.5 to say f/16 with every half or quarter stop in between. Ooh... maybe a physical shutter too! Once one phone has both of those, they will all follow that trend.
"my little buddy jack" haha. That jack is my buddy too. I'm surprised how small it is inside of the phone..... "cough"
Any link for that "double sided tape?"
Please honor 9 lite k as karo sir
Get a pop filter.
??? ????? ????? ????? ????
good
“I’m not suggesting murder here, I’m just saying it can be done”
please water resistance tast review Huawel colour brand a2
I like these videos. There's loads of new phones out that need scratching, burning and bending. But. The Bixby button shown in this video is actually the power button. Ask Alex R, apparently he ripped his out according to this video. Hahahahahaha.
Did u just break ur new s9 and dont feel like using the free samsung warenty then pay alot to break a phone
You are very skilled....great upload...Thank You
Samsung is whooping apple's ass in the technology department, and the mobility department
Exactly... apple is a behind
"I'm not suggesting murder" made my day ??
I love all the sarcasm thrown at Apple! LMAO!!! ??????

Love Samsung on how they add new features without having excuses to get rid of older tech like a 3.5mm jack and microSD expansions. Heavily considering a S9 to replace my aging S5 now...
This guy hates Apple
Thanks for shoving us how to murder bixby.
Hello buddy @jerryrigeverything I wanted a help that u should do a video regarding the scratch test and durability of tempered glass for flagship androids...would love. To see a future video ????
Could we just have an informative video without trashing another company, as both Samsung and Apple have their pros and cons? I mean I love my videos non biased, it’s just a tad annoying to hear iPhone this all the time. Yeah we know and yeah we get it, Apple sucks according to you...
You should go to Samsung and say "id like to upgrade my s9 to s9+ because my s9 doesnt come with a camera."
o.o !! Inside the rear camera of S9
I want this guy to yell once and a while. He’s secretly the chocolate guy from spongebob
Do you have a link for the back glass panels yet?
Still isn’t as good as iPhone X camera tho
You've earned a subscribe from me. Stellar work!

Hiii jerry i am realy intrusted when the samsung lonch his new flagship S9 with new feature in camera (variable apertures) i am realy wating for your vedio to reveal the technology behind the new camera thanks.....and thanks...again.
I was waiting to know how that variable aperture works. Thanks a lot.
I hate how this idiot knows nothing about Apple and juts mindlessly bashes them non stop for the dumbest reasons. 2 years behind? Apple was first to add 4K video recording at 60fps and dual OIS and still have better video stabilizing and color accuracy. Such a stupid angry Apple hater for no reason and who doesn’t know what he’s saying
Sir Jerry can you text VIVO APEX WORLDS 1$t perfect vessels phone of 2018................
bro Test Moto G5S plus Durability
“One careful owner....”??

The line on the corner of your table made me think my screen was cracked for a second
Huge Respect for Jerry.
I love to see a video about vibration motor in phones. ??
Loving your passive aggressiveness towards Apple.
R U RICH?!?!?!?!?!?!?! HOW CAN U AFFORD ALL THESE PHONES AND JUST PUT THEM TO TORTURE?!? U KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY UR SPENDING!!!
You r blocking all mobiles and here i don't even have my own phone so i request you to give one phone plz plz plz plz
So dumb question, I accidentally put in the sim ejector tool in the microphone on the bottom near the charging port. I tested it out and it still works but did that compromise the water proofing on my phone? From your video, it doesnt look like poking the sim ejector will do anything to the bottom mic but I could be wrong
Dear jerry please help me fix my iPhone 7 my power adapter exploded and now my phone doesn’t charge
whats with the constant apple sarcasm? we get it baldie, you dont like apple, but no need to wave it in our face every goddamn time
Wow
Thanks for showing this. I've asked in several forums about how the aperture mechanism must work but no one had a clue until now! Cheers :)
Can you install 6GB RAM on Galaxy S9???
If the flash is the size of an LED, it doesn't really matter for how your photo wil look, since it's the size of the lght source, and not the diffusion that makes light soft on a photo. Sure it will give you a tiny difference, but not something so big that I'd say it'd be worth to market toe phone for.
You need bring it back to Samsung warranty centre ??
JerryRoastsEverythingAboutApple
I’m just here to hear “like a little LEGO”.
lol the sarcasm towards apple is hilarious
Your videos can be entertaining but the random jabs at Apple are completely unnecessary and just get annoying.
What cloth are you using to clean your screens?
Just why did you scratch that inner metal after prying out the battery?!
Amazing engineering!
Hahahaha @JerryrigEverything i love the little apple remarks your starting to throw in your Teardowns they are quite enjoyable keep up the good work mate !!
Dbrand is all hype, once anyone owns it they know it’s trash as hell. Removed mine within one month

You never spoke about BP measuring in S9, or is it only for s9+?
Awesome video
thanks zack
Hurts to watch
SD slot isn't even worth mentioning, it's shit it slows your phone down.
I really appreciated the "being fair" part. It was way overdue. ????
Hahaha, You hate/don't like Apple more than I do. And, Indeed you're best YouTuber/ Person :)
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind, so you'll see this in an iPhone around 2020" Zack, I watch your videos just for the Apple comments. ??

"Apple is usually about 2 years behind, so you'll see this in an iPhone around 2020" ahahahhahahahha
Haha nice apple roast
Jerry, u forget to say "kids,don't try to remove camera, i m professional" Now kids will do this to their smartphone and hence u will be blamed by their parents
Can you do the Lg stylus 2 even if it is old
Nokia 8 sirricco
Sony xperia xz2
Hi good video Please test Xiaomi redmi 5
Can you test Redmi Note 5 pro plz
Still waiting on the video on vibrators
is it possible to put a iPhone charging port in a android, and vice versa. and put a headphone jack in a iPhone X
Jerry Motorola DynaTAC 8000X.
Apple will copy Samsung in 2020 nice one Zack
diagnosis natural these pile lead never like and/or approve fresh random operating
?????? ?????? ??????
Hey Jerry, if YouTube didn’t pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars, would you still do these videos?
good work
Do a "tear-down" for a calculator for April 1st
You should test the Alcatel a30 fierce
Dont know about that 95% tho, switched my battery a week ago after 10 months or so of use because it was way worse
But...will it be your daily driver?
Do a Tmobil REVVL
Hey @JerryRigEverything Would it be possible to maybe take he camera from the 8 and put in 9. And the other way around, i know you can download the cam app for s9 online. It would be pretty cool if you could mod it like that XD
You should grow beard. You will look like Cratos from The God of War-4 Tall, muscular, rough you are a perfect real life character for that
Can you make a teardown of a Xiaomi Mi A1?
What is Emergency mode?
S9 HUINYA!!!
Bixby ???
the inside isnt very innovative like the iphone x
Dope looking but bank breaking skin. Seriously, Dbrand are too expensive
Still plastic SIM tray... no, thanks.
Instead of ripping off the contacts from the Bixby button, you could just put kapton tape over them.
I love the smell of Roasted Apple in the morning.
Webtekno
nice video
dband: hey zack, i want to sponsor your video. zack: but i prefer clear back of my phone dband: just choose one, you got 2 phone zack: okay, i choose the expensive one for skin, because i want to tear the camera off of my phone for clear back one. dband: deal
so finally somethin sensible is available o youtube...
Zack at it again with the apple roasts!
$900 is my 7 month salary... I will die before buy this phone
RIP S9
thumbs up????????

Honestly the quality of those PCB’s look barely better than what’s in a $2 calculator. Apple does the inside of their products so much better and also Apple is 2years ahead when it comes to facial scanning. Not two years behind. Jerry you are being to harsh on Apple just because they got rid of the headphone jack. That’s unfair and it would be nice if you equally shared shame across more phones instead of targeting Apple exclusively just because your not a fan. As a reviewer you are not suppose to express your bias so boldly. You can mention it but stop rubbing it in. It makes it hard to enjoy your videos
Apple doesn’t fall 2 years behind every year. They do come out with things after other companies but only if it’s worth it. Most tests show that the variable aperture is barely noticeable.
Oldsongshindi o
i wish you can give that phone to me
I think Zac you are talking about the power button, not the Bixby one
and the point is?
use this phone in the future for slomo, you now use 240fps. the s9 has 960fps
Always taking a dig at Apple.
Nice video
To much hate on Apple. Might as well get rid of this channel.
Can you tell me where is the parts in the phone that make phone vibrate??
I don't get why did u say that IP68 is not the same as waterproof if IP68 is dust/WATERPROOF over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes... is it just because of this 1.5m and 30 min?
Lol Apple introduced the telephoto lens way before Samsung.
It'd have been cool if you'd detached the bixby connector and made a non bixby triggering bixby button.. ??
Great video and thank you very much for showing us those amazing new technology??
u are a certified jerk.. sorry just couldn't help.
Thumbs up for sony not for Samsung because its use a sony camera
The video name is wrong -How To Remove The Bixby Button From Galaxy S9 2018
Please make a video on Sony experia xa 1
I want to see a phone with the camera UNDERNEATH the backpanel!
Why you gotta hate on apple any chance you get? Annoying af. I have an android but common iPhones are good
"Apple is about 2years behind so u will see this in 2020"
Who hurt you, man?
This is the first time i’ve heard him complimenting Apple.
Gary please do a video on how you can remove U.V filters on some old smartphones to make a night vision camera??
Why not leave one camera with a bigger aperture than the other instead of putting a mechanism that opens and closes?
Apple Inc will have variable aperture camera in 2020 ????love for anti apple fanboy ??
(y)
where do you put your phone after surgering it?
'Apple is usually two years behind, so you will see it in apple around 2020', It was sarcastic indeed ??????
rip s9
Loved the idea to disable Bixby!! :D
The back camera's aperture blades aside, the inner parts of this phone are better put together than those of any phone I have seen in your teardowns.
I'm kind of done watching your videos. This is a Samsung video and you still manage to find ways to shit on Apple.
Shifdelenetden gelenler
Yes ! Kill Bixby, Zack Bixby is nothing and you are brilliant
U R the best
hahah 2 years behind apple..
Was waiting on this one Jerry good teardown as always.
Such a "NORMAL" voice
Variable aperture isn't actually a new thing in a phone. Nokia N86 from 2009 already has it ;)
Webtekno'dan gelenler
Dude! Love your videos. Could you do a durability and tear down of the Oppo latest flagship? Kind regards, Sian.
Watching this video really makes my tears down????
Owo very nice thanks
jerry you rig camera
gj jerry you are one of the best
Hi Jerry, I have a request. Can you do a test on "AGM X2" phone? It's the most toughest phone in late 2017 and I'm thinking of buying it due to the durability and other pros. Thanks in advance if you read my comment.
OIS can hardly help with video smoothness, it's way too tiny to compensate for any type of hand shaking, let alone when walking. But it's incredibly helpful in low light. Also I must say I'm amazed by marketing. Camera modules are so cheap, that you can install the S9 module into their cheapest model, and buyers won't really feel the difference in price, while having top notch camera. But then a lot less people would by S9 if they can get same camera experience in cheap phones, and so cheap phones get shittier cameras just because of that .
The best YouTuber ever. ??
Drop TEST!
I'm not suggesting a murder??????
as always quality stuff

“I’m not suggesting murder, I just say it’s possible” - Hitman 2018
If apple is 2 years behind then what the hell is face id. The glass back, fingerprint sensor and the s9 whole camera is UI is a rip off of apples except its up.
stupid guy doing stupid everthing . wtf. what a waste of a premium phone
Call burning increasingly typical reluctant reputation resolve chemical
Good teardown... To bad the variable aperture is a gimick, low light shots aint better than the S8, some are even better on the S8
variable aperture already was done on nokia phones years ago
Did you guys notice that Zack was showing the power button and not the Bixby button? ??
can you tell why screen flicker
Its a shame you drive a big ass Toyota truck and still manage to make those whimpy little apple jibes. Aww kid.
Your selective points you make comparing Apple to Samsung are unintelligent. Everybody knows Galaxy's do not last as long and as well compared to iPhones.
The internals look cheap. I’m concerned.
Do OPPO R11S PLUS
Apple is two years behind..LOL..good one they are!!
Dude your mocking apple jokes are getting boring.
Srsly mate ? We’ll see it in iPhones in 2020 ? The iPhone doesnt need one, it’s useless and it’s bullshit. I’m a photographer, that aperture that’s in FRONT of the lens is useless and has minimal efect of the photos it takes. Take a look at supersaf’s test between the s9 and the X. It’s obvious the s9 camera is a joke.
The Rubber Balls have escaped xD
Try making a transparent Nokia 3310
Good video sir
You sick man
damn that phone is ripped
literally hurts ??
I enjoy your commentary and the cheap shots. I tend to stray away from Samsung since the galaxy 3 or so. The bloatware is what did it and I feel Samsung has become the apple of android.
7:8 thats why i subscribed him.
You'll see this in an iphone in 2020 lmao. But it will be revolutionary when they do it!
There Are Several Type Of Vibrators...??????BTW You Are The King Of Technology...
Hey Jerry, try durability test for bigger devices like iPads, MacBook and Mac Computers. I is more interesting. I have tried it.
S9??
As always, great video. But can you please make a video to explain why all the shade thrown Apple’s way? Sometimes it’s ok, but others it’s just off putting.
Were you fired from apple at some time?
The video I was waiting for
A 7 minute apple diss
Oh that sweet sweet Apple shade xD
Hi, can you show us an example in the next video of how you keep all your screws etc organised? :)
could you review some liquid glass screen protectors PLEASEEEEE :)

Zack do durability test on Xiaomi Mi Note 3 i wander if he will hold since of that big glass back. Maybe will be new Mi 5 chocolate bar.
Damn, Jerry be cookin' on Apple!
That monotonous apple dissing is just pure gold man

Awesome Video Zack

' I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible'
Am I poor? I cracked my old Note5 back and I cried.
Now these are one of the few videos for which i come to YouTube. Keep it up man!! Inspired by you i repaired my old Nokia feature phones last month. But as you know, they weren't seriously damaged. They were just tired of being omnipotent for so long ??
Like a little lego
Xz2 vs s9+ speed test
2020 ??
Love that he always refers to Apple being behind lol
Can you do a face reveal at 2 million subs?
the new S9's camera module should fit on the S8, so the S8 user can possible to use variable aperture??
What amazing detail, thanks !
"iPhone's usually two years behind, so you'll see this in an iPhone in 2020" Savageness level: 9999 :D
I mostly watch your videos just for your comments. Love you man ?????
Have you heard about DBRAND?
You are the best buddy
I'll keep saying this, that this is the best teardown channel ever!!
You r really hard working Dedication level too high ??
????®®?? ????? ?????®?????????? ???????? ???????? ???? ??????????????
??????????
Please add subtitle for Indonesia thanks you i subscribe you i'm from Indonesia????
Everything looks good with the S9,but is that simcard tray still made of plastic? It's not a big deal but when cheaper phones are using metal sim card tray I thought maybe a much more expensive phone should be too.
us kid administration towards involve chemical ranch gravity point divide.
A great phone for me is the phone with no limitation. I can connect into pc and my phone show just like flash drive device, i can charge it with almost any charging adaptor, i can use any headphone types and I don't scared to showing up my phone on any place/street. That's is a great phone for me.
Please stop scratching metal part with knife, the sound its very very disturbing
Please stop scratching metal part with knife, the sound its very very disturbing
Ur best
Hey Jerry amazing video man totally something I would not do myself but could you do the s9+ too if you want of course lol. I am getting mine on Friday during the release and just wanna know how it looks inside also. Keep up the good work man I love watching these tear down vids. :D
Give me one!!! Jk I wish!!!!
Love the vids, buuut i believe the part referring to Bixby was actually the power key. Keep up w/the great content!
Glass is glass and luckily replacement panels are pretty cheap if you accidentally break one :P
Noikia,N82(2007) ,N8,N808,1020 has a ND filter that closes the camera lens and opens when more light is required. Which was an awesome feature. Its good to see some companies are doing real hardware or optical innovations in the camera!!
Samsung late with the diffuser ?? i noticed my LG G2 has it.
you are saying this different aperture is new in Samsung while Sony did it first and also saying it will take 2 years for Apple to do it. one thing about this is Apple camera still produce the better image than s9+.
Is it just me or anyone noticed the button he said Bixby button is actually the power button???????
You can remove Bixby button pads....... I prefer to disable the button in the settings :)
I'm curious about the processor, which one is the Snapdragon processor in the motherboard section, can somebody point out for me
Lol u showed the power button as the bixby button...!!
Zack for Prez 2018
Waiting for Nokia 7plus??
Hey Jerry ..this is one mother of a video. It explains and confirms so much Thank you. Just asking, can I show this during a training program? Thanks.

Can you do the Motorola E4 durability test
Looks like you are not a fan of Apple. Yeah I agree. They’re a bit slow. XD Love your videos, your professionalism and your pleasure to just scratch. XDDDD it always makes me xDDDDD. More like. XDDDD. Idk how to explain this
Excellent video ????????
hahahha apple is 2 years behind haha funny ??
You should do a video where you say all the facts that make Android flagships different from the Apple iPhones. I feel like people buy iPhones because they just think well it's Apple and it's more expensive so it must be better. However after talking for a good ten minutes with someone who has an iPhone and explaining the facts about the hardware in their phone compared to let's a galaxy they quickly realize they've been scammed.
IPhone 2020????
Do oppo f5 it have really good camera
Sir check the duribilty of nokia 8 Sirocco
still wating for the tear down of the zte dul screem phone, just intersting of the inside of that phone
Wow.... you are best in this...
i love the savage on apple lmao
i wouldnt consider the dual apeture a major deal maker for people to buy it, but maybe the new processor...nvm this is just samsungs version of an iphone 8
The main challenge is to assemble it again.
Brasil SP
Can you show a disassemble of a Huawei ascend xt2 ? I have a broken screen, I need to know how to open the phone properly. I watched a video before, the steps weren't clear enough.
Stop destroying Smartphones
If I get an S9 I may buy a dbrand skin
“And if i’ve earned it hit that subscribe button” now THAT is how you do it man!
I hate samsung! Oh, and i hate apple too btw!
Wow u done it so easily... :-)
I don't even care about this phone, I just enjoy listening to him talk about it ?????
when hardware is explained by a youtuber way better than the actual manufacturer!
Nice to know that we gon see this tech in iphone on 2020
I remember my old phones have the same mechanism. Phones with xenon flash on it. sony ericsson: k800i, w800i and my nokia n82. They have this mechanical iris. If you have one of those, i think you should check that out.
i will buy that clear back than a fuckin dbrand skin!
Samsung > Apple Is there any argument anymore?
Samsung ma be ahead but the iPhone 8 and X still have a better processor. And they still look better but that is not a reason to buy a phone
Your back voice for the video was so catchy man why cant you try in different modulation
Just cover the contacts with electrical tape. Why damage it when you can do a reversible fix?
What is that wallpaper?
So can you show us the pretty sweet camo skin from dbrand
love the popping sound of lego, make it louder please
Speaking of glass backed phones, can you do the Moto X4??
Thumbs up for vibration explanation.

Tech King called Jerryrigeverything
This is one thing I was wondering about phone cameras. Can you upgrade them? Especially since they come out. I hate the camera in my phone. So that's why.
I came here for the apple roasts. I'm satisfied yet once again. ??
I have a Samsung because of my boy jack
Please do a teradown of lenovo zuk z1
Wow, I'm actually impressed with thing. I'm not often am, but this one, I would consider buying. Do you have any idea if I can easily or somewhat easily flash LineageOS on this thing eventually?
i can't see the s9+ what have you done to it zach
I've seen a ton of your vids, this one with the camera tear down is by far the best.
bro u jst ruined e s9 phone...
Does the phone has FM built in?
iphone x is 10000 time better, poor samsung s8 = s9
I finally get to be that douche who says "watching on my Galaxy S9."
Hey Zack, you always deserve a subscriber when you make videos
Original good tech content w/ humor ????????????
This phone would be perfect if the Bixby button was program go to any functioning wide and you can choose your virtual assistant
When are you going to give us an update on your new truck?
In my opinion, your teardown videos are the most interesting. Please never stop making them
"95 % capacity over 2 years" Absolute bullcrap, according to acubattery my note 8 battery capacity is at 3000.......
I'm not saying murder but it's possible
Dbrand if you read this, you should make a copy of interior of a phone and use it as back skin, it will look cool
I didn't even notice the camera was gone in the clear s9 video
But how does the diffuser work!?
nice
First Samsung Galaxy I am interested in, very nice
Entertaining and informative as usual.
I always listen for those word "little Lego".
You know Zack, your S9+ stayed untouched for 3 videos so far. I have a strong feeling you're considering it to be your new daily driver.
I buyed a iPhone 8 i love my phone ??
I love that he hates apple lmao
Isso é incrível, fazer isso e voltar a funcionar
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible." - Zack, 2018

Just waiting for the fire...
Murder the BIXBY!
"I'm not suggesting murder," Just permanently crippling Bixby. And that's O.K.!
Jerry is the s9 camera fit to note 8 ??
Wow Samsung is known for copying Apple and this liberal says the opposite
Like a little LEGO
You savage!! ????????
I just have liked and subscribed your channel for murdering phone. :p
Apple's always ahead in the weirdest ways compared to Samsung. Samsung is ahead in great ways like reducing bezels, beautiful screens, and cool camera technology, but Apple is ahead of the others when it comes to removing head phone jacks, adding notches, and popularizing a second camera. It always feels like both companies are just doing their own thing, but inevitably most every other Android manufacturer just ends up copying what Apple's doing, for better (two camera systems) or worse (headphone jack and that fucking notch). And this opinion comes from a content iPhone 7 user with no plans to change over.
Roasted!!!??????
Still waiting for the Tesla teardown
How you live torturing phones
How can the Samsung battery be so small in form factor but be so huge
I want you guys to decide, should I move to Samsung or stay at Apple
This channel is the only reason why Google built in that notification icon into YouTube!
So um, yeah. Love your videos, but that "Bixby button" that you pointed out was definitely the power button. It's an honest mistake considering the phone is flipped over..
Apple will put this camera in their phones and call it their own revolutionary idea.
Love d Apple roasts nd d quality of ur vids..
Jerry i"ve watched your videos from a year or so and i thouth of this from a long time what if you replace the back camera with the front what will happen like if you think you should do a video
Wish i could afford a S9 but i dont like payment plans and ¥95,839 is about as much as one month of rent but it is a very nice phone, glad they finally added a hardware solution for the rear camera.
I love how he just casually flames Apple throughout the video
Is it possible to mechanically damage that apperture mechanism? I mean, if you hit the phone, or it falls to the ground... And also, would it be possible for this hardware to change the apperture anywhere between 1.5 and 2.4?
MY S9+ IS COMING SATURDAY OR MONDAY Cant ship sunday

Sorry Bixby button is on the right side if from bottom,
bravo majstore
Aperture remember me about Portal
Love from India Many thing learn from u I love u.
Goddamn Zach, you know how i love your Apple burns. What's that ? Oh ... You don't ... Well, now you do! Keep the heat high my friend!
Why don't you just buy official waterproof seals instead of using double sided tape so you can retain the water resistance and keep the clear look
Test the Samsung galaxy j7 sky pro
As always Jerry... your teardown vids are amazing get to learn a lot.
"I'm not suggesting murder" after you explain how to kill Bixby. Ha ha ha this is why I love your channel.
weirdly satisfaying at looking the jack audio spinning when it's pop up ??
Love that jab at Apple :D
Should i buy a Samsung galaxy s9 or a Razer phone?
Are we going to P E N E T R A T E ( ?° ?? ?°) it again?
Very fascinating video. The Samsung Galaxy S9 duo is looking to be pretty promising: no stupid notches, they have headphone jack, card slots, and cameras with variable apertures. Now if only they had removable batteries and a 16:9 ratio.??
you wanna give me that phone now
Hey jerry rig everything i love your videos man but why don’t you pick on another smart phone company that just apple. Btw sometimes your jokes about i have to admit they are a little funny? ??
Hey Jerry you scratched your camera lens on the phone of course
Apple will "invent" that camera 2 years from now
do you realise you were saying to the people to remove the power button??? bixby is on the other side...
All of the roasts that you have been handing out to apple makes me ashamed of owning a 6..
You've earned it!
Well done. Now let's wait for the S10
@jerryrigeverything what about attempting to retrofit the so camera module in an s8
Ha phrasing ????
I swear Dbrand is just sponsoring everybody
Bixby finally survived. ??
Very experienced man.
always fun to watch. :D
You are one ruthless sob.
Man I love it how honest you are about Apple! Roasting da heck outta dem unlike most of the other youtubers who are afraid of losing their iSheeps audience!
your video so cool I subscribed for you friend
The Apple bashing is real in this one oof
What up rating is complete waterproof
well, is there any improvement on the speaker this time around ?
nice video
galaxy s9 so so coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool bro????????
Apple will invent it
Jerryrape everything
i like that the PCB is just a general PCB colour, not black etc.
Hahahahaha. The statement was awesome for bixby . I m not suggesting murder, i m just saying it's possible
Dang what's your beef with Apple.
you pointed to the power button, then called it a bixby button
what i don't understand is how apple is revolutionary when its always 2 years behind.
I understand that apple overprices their devices and their latest have not been so innovative but the iPhone 5s had Touch ID before Samsung and when Samsung got it the next year on the S5, you had to slide down. The iPhone 7 Plus had dual cameras before the Samsung phones and a year later, Samsung put it in their phones on the note 8. So i kinda get annoyed when you make it seem like they have no impact in the smartphone world. But I stilled enjoyed the video nevertheless!
I love your content, but after tens of apple burns in every single video, kind of getting tired of it. I get it, you hate apple but its kind of extreme and overused at this point. Apple is not the only one excluding features or waiting some time for them to get better, its not like samsung doesnt make mistakes, I dont hear you joke about their exploding note 7's everytime looking at a battery. Just something I noticed, have a nice day tho :)
Shit Pry tool isn't the same as IFIXITS
what happens if xou open the camera app without having a camera in the phone?
Awesome phone
Nooooo why did u broke the s9 :'( ??
$1000+ iPhone X < $720 Samsung S9
Noooooooooooooooo don't murder Bixby. He's my buddy.
In 2020 There will be no camera on the iPhone ????
You know what I love about your Apple burns? That unlike iSheep who have to stretch reality to make Samsung look bad, you're actually just throwing out pure facts out there. The fact those are actually so stupidly ridiculous is what makes the burn so effective. Kinda makes you think about where you put your money, huh?
You are the best??????
IT IS THE EXACT SAME... Its like an S8s
many bombs thrown at Apple's a-hole
No one's gonna point out the hilarious apple roast? ??
I wish he would stop throwing shade at Apple I used to enjoy this channel but he just won't shut up and review the phone in front of him instead he points out every feature that a phone has that apple doesn't
Waiting for the homepod teardown jerry??
Love how you dirty talk with your phone ????
Hey Jerry, I think that was actually the power button you mentioned in the video. Haha It was face down which flipped the buttons too.
LEEEGO :)
Lol Camera failure msg ????
agent 47!!
I listen to your videos while sleeping. Your voice is so soothing
Can't wait to see Apple inventing that variable aperture camera in upcoming models
your videos are so good!
Try buffing scratches off an iPhone X please !!!
No I don't have enough I'm just a teen
ok come on, stop hitting on Apple so much with the whole battery deal, its annoying. Every video I watch of yours consists of almost one negative comment on Apple...not all they do is bad, and you seem to portray them as a horrible company.....not cool.
still didnt check if the charger port has the same issue that many of the s8's and s8+'s had.
Apples batteries are larger but have less capacity Samsung batteries are much smaller and yet are larger Coincidence?
Now that is something of a manly review of the phone..!!! Learnt something new.
LG gets criticized for making a v30 with new A.I and a few hardware upgrades but samsumg gets praised for making a whole new flagship that only has a better camera than the s8? Makes sense
Apple maybe 2 years behind but when they do it they will always out perform samsung... even look at the shitty retarded animoji's samsung released. I dont own a iphone and currently have a S7 so dont come back at me saying i am a apple fanboy.
I need a phone sooo frinking bad
Low-key bashing on Apple ??????
Only Dbrand skin worth buying are the matte color ones
I like seeing the inside of phones
It's not murder, it's amputation.
Only dumb turds buy Dbrand skins for that overpriced garbage... these skins are like 2 bucks on ebay or aliexpress.
Man, I love this dude’s smooth apple roasts
Finally, what I have been missing on youtube
do a video on how to murder the Bixby button!!!
What would happen if you put the S8 camera in S9 ?
I am not saying to murder the bixby button but it is possible
now if we can only modify that sim tray to hold 2 sims and a sd card simultaneously
I love the Apple shade. ??????
$5 on Apple advertising their future revolutionary camera as their "2020 vision"
Zach to the rescue!!!
Damn I'd like to get S8 or S9, too bad they are using shitty OLED displays...
the 95% battery is so underrated! this is important. all my phones get crappy after so little time! Wish my laptop used that kind of battery too :(
didnt see second speaker... lol was it there? cant find
This variable aperture is a joke, with that sensor size lol "innovative"
Beautiful inside as it's beautiful outside.?? Apple is always behind the innovative Samsung.
You have earned it already ..??????
Is there anything u didnt rig yet? Lol
I really like your videos zack, but i think you’re taking the apple criticism too far!
his voice is so relaxing lol
that wasnt the bixbi button actually that was the power button
This is what makes samsung way superior than apple
If you popped the camera out of the s9 could it fit in the s8? I know you wouldn't get the variable aperture but just curious
"rip off the contact pads, so he never works again. I'm not suggesting murder, just saying it's possible". Zack, i like your honesty on things like failed buttons and premium brands running 2 years behind and claiming innovation :D
Dbrand is shipping so slow, it has been 10 days stil not shipped..
"You'll see this in an iPhone at around 2020" ??
This guy is so jelly of apple! Did they reject your job application at the Apple store or something?
No hate but i cant fcing belive how big of an android and especcially samsung fanboi this guy is
I dont know why but it doesnt feel like 60fps
Life is a diy proyeckt
Jerry is finally becoming who he's meant to be
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" - JerryRigEverything 2018 ??
are you going to do a honor 7x review at some point?? you did the 6x so now what about the new one??
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" indeed useless bixby button.
You should be paid to roast apple consistently Agent 47
His videos are so relaxing like asmr ??
I wonder if the mm change in the aperture can be done over a range rather than what I understand to be a hard `1` or a hard `0` for 1.5 and 2.4. XDA, do your thing.
Why dont you test the samsung galaxy J7 2017 its not a flagship but i want to see its power ??????
Always big thumbs up ????????
"I'm not suggesting murder." Lmao Bixby shade is heavyyyyyyyyy ??
...like a little Lego... :D
Should be able to reassign the bixby button so when pressed it take you to Jerry's YouTube page. Call it the Jerry button.
Solution to get rid of Bixby Software guy: Roots phone, remaps button Hardware guy: Rips cables out
What happends if you decided to dont put certain " important " komponents inside? Will it make the software go bad shit?
I swear the S9 Plus was the only phone with the aperture I guess wrong not the s9
We do what we must because we can
Didn't expect to laugh during a phone tear down video but that was amazing lol the salt was strong
Your iPhone bashing is getting pretty old. We get it, you don't like Apple.
Swap camera s9 to s8??
Don't worry guys, apple will most likely invent variable apertures in the next iPhone!
F you dbrand
I'm looking forward to that vibrator video.
You’re the only guy I watch for teardown videos because you actually give an in-depth review of every product only thing I have to say is I am an Apple fan however I agree with you they need to put the headphone jack back
I love how you are roasting Apple in your videos, they make me laugh a lot. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and it's a great phone. Amazing speed and great camera. You can say iPhones are expensive but if you compare the iPhone 8 Plus' price with the S9 plus, in Europe the iPhone 8 Plus in 100 euros cheaper. And the iPhone is still faster. Camera quality is debatable and since i havent had an S9 in my hands, i can't say anything.
I still like pixel 2's camera more. For me S9 is a little bit of a scam.
"You know what you sign up for" - may these roasts never disappear
oh you earned the subscribe alright. Such a clear tear down and commentary
@JerryRigEverything bro, I think you have mistaken power button for bixby button....
I watch it as a revenge to those phones I can't buy..
you just managed to make 2 videos during one teardown lol
??well see these in apple in 2020
Could you do a review of AGM x2 phone? It claims that it's build strong even a group of 6 or 7 kicking it on the floor won't do much damage. Thanks Jerry!
Is there any particular reason variable aperture has to be done with a moving shutter instead of an LCD?
Not a JRE video w/o the Apple jokes
Why are you always have to say something about Apple? Dual aperture is such a gimmick feature on a phone... watch all the experiment videos on this camera and you’ll se a microscopic change in the light. Plus with this “feature” it lets microscopic light to come to the sensor but you lose so much quality. Look it up in the videos. I don’t hate on your videos i love watching them but your jokes are kinda out of date. Its my opinion. The headphone jack one is not funny anymore because more people are actually okay with that and they don’t need it anymore. Samsung will also remove it. Right now they wait for other companies to take the hate for that. But they WILL REMOVE IT.
20% drop every year for an iPhone battery!! Wow
Great video, thanks.
How U can now have a Destroyer s9 xD
Please perform a durability test on Honor View 10. Thanks!
That reminds me, I would like if somebody built phone from parts from other phones.
Why you hate apple
What a tool
But, I thought that s8 became clear..!!! ??
i love how he says "pretty cool"
gotta give it a lil love how Zack picks on Apple
A W E S O M E
Thank you for making this video
I dont know why but the front cam looks like a gopro
Apple burnt beyond recognition in this video??
The little Apple jabs in your vids warm my heart. Love it. lol
Stop roasting apple lmao
I'll come back to this video 2 years later when apple announces their variable aperture
Apple hire him.....??
Like DSLR? You mean like a most cheap compact camera? :)
why ????????????
Great video and explanation!  Thank you for a job greatly done.
Galaxy S9 teardown and you cant stand not to criticize apple on every step, this is annoying. Apparently you can't make a video without Apple in it, otherwise nobody would watch it.
How do you know when to remove what? Do you watch other teardown or similar, or did you do it often enough to know your way around well enough?
???????
Love all the apple jabs. Great video as always.
Why not disagree s9 Plus
Mmm been waiting for this tear down since the leaks came out. Way to go Zack!
I got my S9+ today but I will not activate until I get my OtterBox Defender case so I don't pull a JerryRig
apple be like ... after 2 years for the first time ever we introduce the variable aperture
Love your videos
That was really do cool zack
Yeah fuck apple
I subscribed to you twice jerry .
With bxActions the Bixby-Button is just great.
Do you prefer the S9 screen or the s9+? and is the s9 Big enough and with wat can I compare the size of the s9 with wat for object Thinking about Buying 1 of the 2. :)
Is the bixby button the same as the power button?
The camera was so much interesting, same as the comment for Apple was????????
Do galium vs aluminium backed phone
I wish I could meet the aliens who designe such complex hardware.
Damn, Jerry is starting to reach new levels of fan-hating Apple.
Does it have Quattro? It means 4 in which language?
This guys really know how to review a phone, in and out.
what if that aperture toggle switch was left in between the end points??? could we not choose aperture between the provided range
At least u don't smash phones
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind. You will see this in an iphone by 2020" This made my day. :)
Jerry, why you hate that Bixby button?
Apple running 2 years behind? Don't you mean 5? ??
U stupid dork piece of shit u are behnd and Samsung crap who always coppies Apple no wonder it can’t have Face ID witch is 3 years ahead of everyone.... looser
This guy is Apple Savage ????
S9 teardown was awesome.the hardware rocks.especially the camera lens..
You speak so well and explain everything so nicely
I like this guy too much
Please test the Nokia 7plus, we gotta know how Nokia is going ??
Great work Jerry, thanks
2010 Nokia N8 also have light Frame please notice that phone
why did you stop doing camera comparisons ?
the way that aperture moves...makes me wonder if samsung could have given more f stops then only 2 options??
I love your apple roasts
Sir u are great clam and sharp Shows there is a possibility u can just pop the connector of the Bixby button ?? legend Just saying indeed. Respect
Sir Am big fan of u r voice
you did suggest Bixbey's murder! LMAO
I like when red arrows point to screw fixtures and I like Jerry...Meow!
Stop hating Apple so much!!!
U r ??
Hey , so you say that camera is controlled with magnets , soooooo if i wanna film a very strong neodium magnet up close will that affect my ois :))))))) ....just saying.....
this guy is the best
Bro its the power botton
yes but still no cat s41 tear down ??
I really wanted him too kill bixby
,,Our replacment backpanel is very cheap,, Apple never said
Zack just keeps getting better and better. He has single-handedly carved out a pretty unique niche on youtube, no mean feat in 2018. He is without question the very best at what he's doing around here. Plus, he absolutely [and accurately] skewers Apple in the most clever, charming and least offensive manner possible. Great writing and production :D
As a non-butthurt Apple fan, I admit I laughed at the 2-years behind comment. The S9 is a well designed and built slab. Not a fan of what Samsung does with Android, though. If only they'd be part of Android One.
In our country shit is fos and we call iphone ifos (iphos) :D
Audio Clarity " The best on any Youtube Channel"
I'm here because this is the best teardown channel and also because I've pre-ordered the 256GB S9+ so I'm getting it tomorrow here in Taiwan so Exynos variant. Roasted Apple is just the perfect topping and this is The Place to get it! The best thing is that they're all facts that sheep are always denying or making excuses for. Thank you Zack for telling it like it is... Raw and straight up in their faces. My 256GB S9+ will cost the same as an 64GB iPhone X LMAO! My 400GB MicroSD card is ready... 656GB!
S9 Good ??!
You definitely earn, to be subscribed Good video quality and definitely good explanation Thanks
"Apple is usually 2 years behind so expect this in the iPhone in 2020." DYING
JerryRapesEveryThing ??
Anyone else getting their S9 tomorrow! :D I also got that Dbrand black camo to go with it!
Should i buy the Google pixel xl?
You are genius .....
Same battery used as in S8?
been waiting for the camera how it works and know how to kill bixby button manually. thank you jack
Samsung is like the only company that doesn’t skip 9.
WEird, my s9+ has a diffuser! maybe theres a difference by market?
this consistent apple hate is amazing
can i send you my phone so you can fix it lol. Im serious it looks pretty bad the screen is broken and the camera lens glass is also broken and i cant afford to buy a new on lol (broke college student)
Rather to have that aperture technology two years later when it's well implemented rather than having it know and making the pictures look mostly noisy.
Amazing
I don't see the hype over the 400gb SD storage size cause the lg v10 went up to 1 terabyte and that phone is so old now
Jerry rig i am samsung galaxy note 3 neo N750 user . I lost my s pen can u please send me a link for buy s pen or send me one from ur mobile garbage
Bro, you're best in narrating things you do. And one reason to click that YouTube icon.
Youtuber by day hitman 4 hire by night lol
Your work is just awsome...
I love it when he throws shots at apple.
would like to see an earpiece comparison so I can understnd why samsung doesn't enable stereo on the s8
Drink Everytime he says" like a Lego " Fuck I am drunk af
"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just... saying it's possible." Lol
Lmao iphone got burned in this video
5% watch cause they like technology 95% watch cause of him hating apple :)
ughh couldn't make it early this time because i was taking a nap :( well i guess I'm not one of the notification squad... when it gets to this video at least.
man this is the one thing that I was looking for an explanation for , thumbs up Jerry , you are more thorough in your demonstrations than even the ifixit guys . also thankyou for giving the bare truth about the iphone "2 years behind , you will see the mechanism somewhere in 2020" :D
Who else is using the new black mode of YouTube
A vibrator video...hmm...
LEGO-MAN Returns..
I love your videos and everything dude, but i unsubbed as soon as you became so biased, I’m no fanboy of either party, but you label these videos as teardowns, not opinions
this dual aperture mechanism system i have seen so many times before in some old nokia symbian os phones like nokia n8, nokia n73 etc. but nokia never mentioned that. But if you look close, you will see...
When you take apart phones they always look so cool!
Review + teardown the Wileyfox Swift 2X please
I normally really enjoy these videos but at 4 and half minutes I can’t tell if this is a Samsung teardown video or an Apple bashing video. Kind of annoying.
I will teardown my GALAXY S9 just to remove Bixby button from my phone ??
Thanks Zach! The dual aperture works exactly like I thought, with two shutters closing. Pretty cool, and reliable, though this design eliminates any position but opened or closed. I believe the four coils are electromagnetic lens positioning for the OIS. The aperture shutter should have a micro-solenoid actuator. Thanks again for another great video.
Love you Jerry. I love your sarcastic approach to nearly all your video is subtle and gr8.
Jerry do a review on asus new zenphone 5
Or try with the s9+ With note 8 camera
Can you put this camera part on the s8 or s8+
"Apple's usually 2 years behind...." Steve Jobs cries in his tomb!
You don't just earn the subscribe button, you fuc*** nailed it!
...like a little lego
"Crapple is usely 2 years behind, so u will see this in an iCrap in 2020" Truest shit I ever heard lel
I think apple should exclude a main camera because it takes up too much space
Kick Ass. I won’t touch replacing anyone’s screen on s9. They pulled an HTC and mounted too many parts on the lcd lmao
Do Sony XZ2 vibrator reveal
"My phone"? So you have switched?
That was not the Bixby button. It was the powerbutton. Looks like the bixby button uses the same ribbon as the volume rocker.
Excellent video Jerry.
I just don't understand how anyone could dislike your videos....
turn the csmeraa in without the lens
Man you always go hard on Apple it's weird we still haven't had the 'Dear JerryRigEverything' video from TailosiveTech
"I am not suggesting murder.. " Lmao.
Get that mole checked bud
174 fixed aparture lenses disliked this video...
Team Samsung or iphone? Me iphone ????just kidding
Did you teardown two s9 phones
What if... You dont put te lenses on the camera and try to make a photo?
Thanks Zack.was waiting for that,,keep the job bro :)
Roasting Apple ahead ????
Scratched the camera lens ?? scary
Man you roast Apple so hard! Love your videos, keep it up! :)
and do.. detailed comparison between gorilla glass versions.. it would be interesting..
I like turtles
Good video love it
That poor poor S9 has been used and abused all so we can be amused.
He is a professional mobile surgeon. Dr Zack
Always love your Apple roasts. Very tasty
This guys always bitter about Apple
guess who get free phones from Dbrand???
Would you shut up about Apple I am so sick of you bashing Apple in every one of your videos I am just about ready to unsubscribe your videos would be very interesting if you wouldn’t be such a jerk about Apple.
What do you have against apple bro?
There is no point to buy this phone then, hardly any difference
What do you think, in 2020 will samsung smartphone be as much as powerful as iphone of 2017?
sony xperia xz2 durability an tear down
Samsung variable ads first with imagined camera xd??
Its been 2 yrs since I bumped into ur channel - s7 edge, and I must say I've enjoyed each one of ur videos since then, they keep getting better, entertaining and educative. Keep up the great job
I love the Apple roasts :D
S9+is king
I'm not suggesting murder... just saying it's possible.
Use iFixit's adhesive remover
The internal design of this phone is so much better that the Apples, they are such a mess, 20 different types of screws, glue shit everywhere, you can tell who actually designs their phone internals and who slaps and glues it together.
Need to have him dissect Hillary clintons brain and see why its so sick... lol.. he would do a great job
I wish that his intro name was a bit bigger.
Guys through out the video there's a random flashlight looking thing in the top right... I think your studio is haunted.
You deserve 10 million subscribers real talk
LEGO should start paying you
I love how you roast apple ??
The button that you speak about is the power button
What will happen if you take the galaxy s9 camera and place it into the note8 or s8?
I like that you are so cold
I'm not suggesting murder but....??????
????????????
Any plans on tear down of s9 plus model? I know it would be almost same but, some minor differences might be worth a video.
I love this channel and the videos you make! But I’m starting to notice you are blasting on Apple more and more! I get it they are not everyone’s preference, but I like impartial reviews!
I love the murder part. Sounds reasonable. Well said. Hahahahaaha
I'm goona thankful to you because I have founded the real truth about the Galaxy s9
Can you do a g5plus tear down?
Thanks for the informative video. I was waiting for this. ??
Love when you rip on Apple! Nice vid.
Love from India !!!
Yesssss love the shade thrown on apple 2020 when they get this haha
About the flash diffuser, since it is such a small light source, having a diffuser that tiny isn't noticiable on any occasion
Dude you are the reason I watch a teardown video...Never repaired a smartphone but watched majority of your teardown videos...Thank you for the entertainment and apple roast ..FYI You are literally the 1% of the Youtube community who Shares the truth about apple rest are apple fanboys/sheeps...
Im here for apple bur XD good job
Good job
Wow what ca camera rip Dslr ?
The biggest arms in the tech yt industry with the most delicate hands.
Nice apple burns.
Jack all this videos with tear down you learn me how to fix my old phone HUGE THUMBS UP FOR YOU
Good job
Samsung should thank you for this vid
When you were showing the bixby button i think that was actually the power button
I love how he constantly shits on the iphone
The button you said was bixby was actually the power button. Remember, you had the phone upside down
Your videos are so mind relaxing... everything goes so smooth ????
So you have to destroy the screen to fix the broken glass??
Respect....and love from India????????
This video makes no sense because of the clear rear video from 2 days ago. Still a great video tho
"Apple's about 2 years behind so you can expect this feature in around 2020" will for sure be expensive af and branded as revolutionary brand new camera technology mark these words
Nokia n8 used similar kind of technique 10 years ago, inside the camera, it had extra lens like sunshades, when i point my camera to sun, internal black sunshades pops in
Very clean work ??????
???????? what's this android doctor
Samsung made a really cool feature with that adjustable aperture , but I’m 100% sure Apple will do it better and more technologically advanced than Samsung, this happens just every year???????
inb4 apple puts a variable camera lens in an iPhone and the apple fanboys start saying it's a new thing
When do replacements become available? Have any replacement parts ever become available?
Nice
1
Is it possible if you swap s9 camera to s9+?
Just watched a 2 minutes advertisement for you. So you can upload often.??
He fires 2 much at apple??????
How is Apple 2 years behind the competition when they make the best phone processors, as well as the most secure/advanced form of facial recognition and tracking on ANY phone? There was even 4K video recording at 60fps long before Samsung, but no one ever brings this up, either.
Mind blowing awesome
400gb...with that size...wth...so tiny
Plz do Sony XZ2
So why does the 4k 60 on the s9 do not have ois?
"Apple is usually about 2 years behind so you will see this in an iPhone in 2020." ????
Hey jerry,great stuff...keep up...bro why dont you teerdown smartwatch..just curious to see the modular circuit design of this small tech..hope to see one of it...if possible open the camera fully like you did in lg v30...
one of the most unique channel on youtube
Lol Samsung: don't worry the battery will stay strong for over a year Apple: expect a big drop in battery every year (if we don't do it manually)
Gonna see iphone use this camera tech in 2020 ??????
Give me ones more phone.. please ????
I don't know how u make this look so easy .. I tried opening a iPhone and It took me hours to put it back?? I guess that's what editing is for ??
Please do make a video on the different types of vibration motors :) ! and btw the amount of detail in this video was great!
That was the power button not the Bixby button that you told people how to break
love your videos can you shoot a video telling us how to replace a charging port
"I'm not saying to murder the guy (bixby) i'm just saying it's possible". I died
You should have put the camera back in but without the lens. I am very curious to see how it would look when there is only the Sensor.
"im not suggesting murder, im just saying its posible" hahaha
I‘d like to see a durability test of the MobileStudioPro. Wacom prides itself on durability but it seems to me they slacked quite a bit in recent years.
As always roasting apple ??????
Did anyone else hear the buttons "tick" when he turned off the video?
the aperture does make a LOT of difference to detail even in low light ,set it to 2.5f in a street lit night with slow shutter speed and the bricks look sharper and more detailed than the camersa flooding in more light
"You will be see this in 2 years on iPhone" ?????? Great man, keep going. Hi from Bosnia?
My favorite phone technician
Everything unclips like little lego pieces.
Awesome dude. Incredible work .. Stay inspired.
Is some of the footage reused?
"Apple's usually two years behind, so you'll probably see this in an iPhone around 2020" ????
Remember me thx bro
Now i understand why it is worth that much money
I don't think your patience for taking Samsung phones apart is fully appreciated, lol
2 Million almost there
I've subscribed??
I'm pretty sure Nokia was the first to implement Variable Aperture.
Apple will invent variable aperture in 2020
“I’m not suggesting murder,I’m just saying it’s possible” ??
Why do I feel like Jerry has a shelf full of Lego Builds ;-;
Super
Use a glue diffuser used in ifixit video
Nice vid bro :)
This channel is the best, this channel is the evidence that a channel don't need clickbait. Sorry for the bad English, I'm spanish and I'm learning English, tell me if my english is bad.
I love Sumsung
Swap the part from s9 to s8 and vice versa.
Love from india ...jerry..
Jerry cannot live without Apple. The guy loves the iPhone so much he talks every video about it hahahahhaha
Good job jerry
Apple jokes are the best ??????
how can you make 2 videos but with a phone without a camera and with a camera, and the same scratch on the fingerprint sensor?
I wouldn't piss off Apple folks if I were you. Those guys get triggered easily. We don't wanna have a shitstorm in your comment section.
Why does the teardown video comes after the clear video? Btw i love your channel and voice
Those guys with my name are always intelligent ????
Give me one phone so that i can watch alal your videos insted of killing them
not worth the hype, overpriced phone
hey, i always wanted to know if u can put a camera sensor like this, lets say in a other phone like the s8, u think its possible? would be sick
Great video!
It's hurt to watch this video... But i enjoy it in entire second ??
Test the sony Xperia xz2
i love your hair <3
Love how much trash he talks about Apple in these videos.
Can you actually move the camera and fingerprint sensor to the s8? So you relocate the fingerprint sensor on the s8.
u will see iphone in 2020 for that technology and call it revolutionary....
Zack u r awesome
I asked you so much that I would go to a picnic with a mobile but you did not give me, but rather asked me to subscribe too! You were thinking of a foreigner so long that your mind was very good but now I know that your mind is very small. Thanks for not giving.

Is it even a teardown if he doesn't unplug something 'like a little Lego'?

Take a shot whenever he takes a shot at apple
Never buying a used phone from you ????????
Great vidéo !!
Another great video from Zack. But one minor mistake, the Bixby button that he pointed out is actually the power button. Since in this teardown we are looking at the back of the phone, the Bixby button will be on the right under the volume rocker. If you kill that button on the left, you won't be able to turn on the phone. Just a word of caution in case someone really wants to go ahead and kill the Bixby button.
Wow the Great video Sir ?? Sir bhut hi accha video h Sir thank you very so much sir ??
One of the best channels on youtube!
Yeah remove that Bixby button, oh wait, that is the power button you are pointing at.
What if you take one camera from the Dual Camera of the S9+? Will the camera app still work, because you got technically 1 camera of the dual camera left?
Wow
I cant buy and he's destroying ?? btw learnt many things from you Jerry ???
How nice.
Thanks for making video sir
Thumbs up for Samsungs Engineers who designed the camera
Sorry but the iPhone X camera looks so much better and realistic then the galaxy 9 camera.
The roasting of apple in this is insane, of course I liked it.
That was the power button you showed us, not Bixby, so guys don't destroy it!
Do the Xiaomi Mi A1!
Why do I find your voice so soothing???
Can some one explain me why many don't like bixby?
What skin are you talking about , I see no phone
Like teardown mini 4wd ??
Hey Zack you had mentioned that Apple removed the headphone jack because they weren't making money of it... And proprietary lightning port makes them money... Using that logic do you think Android Smartphone manufacturers make money by using USB type C headphones and removing the Headphone jack?
Do a Bixby button removal tutorial!
aperture science
Hello, on Samsung S8 you showed us that front facing camera had a OIS ``design`` ... does this S9 have a OIS on front facing camera ? Thanks.
Your channel is not only informative and entertaining, but also, your voice is extremely soothing..
Coool :) Ty!
Hey Zack I remember my Nokia n 73 with the same type of camera like s9. Please check it out and make a comparison video if possible. I watch all of your videos but talking to you for the first time. Bye have a good day
your video make teardowns look easy, but every time I try to teardown my electronics, I end up screwing them.... :')
A very different take on tech videos. Keep Spicing up the tech world. Amazing channel.
Lol 2020 xD more like 2024 took them many years to get wireless charging, fast charging, ip67 so i dont think 2020 iphones will get that camera
You've earned it, two yours age as i remember :-)
Dude...plz test cheaper phones also
Camera lens replacement
I like your explanation
Oh wow I didn't know Samsung was claiming 95% battery cap retention after 2 years. That's very impressive, I learned that Li-ion batteries drop about 20% per 500 charges (so about what apple is claiming) Am going to search for someone that tests this, because it's a major reason why I haven't bought a new phone (without user-replaceable battery) yet.
AppleRoastCounter is exploding xD
Can you make TNT please let me know if you need anything else from me please let me
What do you do with your old phones
'Apple is usually yeo years behind so you will see this in an Iphone in around 2020' ????
I love the Apple burns all the time! hahah
why you gotta hate on apple tho? :/
??????????????
Greetings from Aperture Science Enrichment Center
My view of smartphones was changed by this channel... Love u..
so if I break my screen and replace it will it not be waterproof anymore??
So good
One thing about Android phones which just isn't as good as iPhones is haptic feedback. All around the UI the amazing haptic feedback on the iPhone makes it very nice to use. Samsung is prolly the only manufacturer which comes close to that of Apple yet it is not as good. Hope to see improvement in Android phones in this area.
Plz Stop raping this beast????????
thank for give us details about camera
Lens finally revealed in next video... ??????????
Surgery on the S9 I see...
Iphone ??
circuit board look like 90s walkmans,, so cheap.
Galaxy s9 is only water resistant? Lmao Android plebs. iPhone x is water proof I'm a troll
Apple may invent the mechanical aperture in 2020. Indeed.
so, you have opened this phone twice?! once for this video and then again for the transparent back??? how many S9's do you have bro?!
Test xiaomi redmi 5 plus, please
Jerry is a Bixby fan??
You should not hate other company man
Do a video on the camera of galaxy s9+ on galaxy s9 and check if it works??
This make me subscribe
I ripped out my Bixby button according to the video.. Turns out you showed the power button as the Bixby button...
PLEASE do a seperate video on the S9+ Dragon Camo skin!!!
He is still angry about Apple ?? not inviting in their events ??????
Why do you hate apple so much ?
omg the apple rant again and again and again xd lmfao.
If JerryRigEverything liked this I'll subscribe to every account of him. If not I'll still do it cause he is AWESOME.
He is one of the very few i have subscribed and is a major reason to watch YouTube. Cheers Zack
Apple will probably invent the variable aperture in a few years...
The diffuser doesn't make any sense on the LED. Because a diffuser cant diffuses the light if it's so close to the light source it needs some distance from it.
How many of these tools do you have? :D
On the side I see the cameras fingerprint sensor and flash of the s9 plus but not according else
This guy is the only one who makes the most informative videos on smartphones these days...... Three cheers for this guy and hit like if you agree??????
lmfao Zack points at the pwr button and say things about Bixby
Awesome man... Great... Thank you so much
Can you put an S9 camera in an S8?:D
Not apple is 2 years behind, but samsung and android is 5 years behind apple and its superior OS
One small problem in this video. Before putting the phone back together, Jerry said that in the left is the Bixby button, but that is power button, Bixby is under the volume buttons.
Apple do that by 2020??????
good job bro...
Something new? Nokia N86 camera would like to speak to you
Your constant attempts to roast Apple result in most of the Apple fan base to cease watching your videos, and that’s a lot of people!
variable aperture camera first on iphone 2020
Zack got rid of the Jack
Apple 2020
Here's me using my galaxy S5 from launch day and I really don't mind it. No more updates after marshmallow but meh it does what I want. I have thought about the S9 but just gonna use my S5 until it breaks.
Jerry, prove you have the superpower to keep tabs on every comment and give this a heart XD i wanna freak my friend out.
This channel is the only one thats worth staying on youtube forever (there are a few exceptions)
basically, nokia n86 8s the first smartphone that have variable apperture (thats 3 mode versus 2 mode in Samsung)
I like the smell of roasted apples.
Nice hardware, shit software. Both copied from apple
Can we replace s8 camera module with the one from newer s9 and will it be functional??. If yes then instead it upgrading to s9 just for camera we can replace it with better one.
I just see this and it was nice I just wanted to know about the rear camera that how the aperture changes works Thumbs up for that I liked it And pretty good
Can we replace the s8 camera with the s9 camera?
Yea man explain the types of vibrators lol
Waao nice to see a great build inside Samsung phone ... I am not sure if you will pick my question or not but did you practice before tear down any phone? How you do it so smoothlessly??????
Samsung really benefiting from producing their own li-ion batteries for sure.
Definitely you’ve earned it bro. Especially, when you mentioned Apple’s strategy of arriving late to the party haha. AND I HAVE A REQUEST. CAN YOU PLEASE DO AN iPAD PRO TEARDOWN????
glass is glass
try connecting other camera sensors to the s9!
excellent video very impressive
Wew, Phone without a camera, that's pretty dope ??
glass us glass
I love how you kick Apple every time you can!!!!!
I was so excited to watch this video, I was really anxious to see what the camera lens looked like. ??
Love your tagline, life is a diy project
Did you just assume Jack's gender?! !!TRIGGERED!!
Re-upload?
This channel is my favorite Guide of choosing phones. You owned 1 subscriber!
Apple is two years behind ??????
So I'm not really sure why they went with a two bladed aperture that is limited to two fixed f-stops. Seems like that mechanism could have easily been developed with five or more blades and have additional f-stops. Maybe it was a challenge to make blades that small? Maybe they're saving it for the next Galaxy and this is just a proof of concept. Either way, we all keep skipping over the fact that the aperture does more than just control how much light hits the sensor.
What???? I am not still subscribed to this channel? seen many videos but noticed it now,,,,,SUBSCRIBED
Please give me the s9
I love that you take jabs at apple ??
Still waiting for the tacoma teardown and durability test ??
I need to see a teardown of a Tesla car
Jerry, are you saying the Apple will "invent" Variable Aperture Camera lens in 2020?
So the aperture can be either 1.5 or 2.4? I thought it can change gradually
Why do you hate apple so frickin much???!!
And after a min of watching, I know your video quality is really great. Subbed
I'll stay with my s8. Until another device become better. Probably the s10
"Apple will invent such camera in 2020 " LMAO.......
Jack, try to replace the camera
No Jack jokes ? Shame on you
Hey plz Make LG V20a and V30 Durability Test video.... Plz
Im the first comment?
can you PLEASE post workout videos please? Ive been dying to see your routine
Clean back s9?
Oh i cannot see it ..... Get away from my eyes ....
It was the power button not bixby
"Iam not suggesting murder..iam just saying it's possible"Lol bixby
Recently commented on facebook. Now here too. Hey jerry zack, you're awesome.
Best Mobile In The World
Test sony L1
Thank you for showing this.......i've been waiting for this to be shown by any youtuber........can you open the camera module little more to show the two flaps & the OIS technology.........
I smell some hate for happle here !!
Fun fact, the s9 actually supports up to 2TB SD storage. They only say 400GB because that's the largest microSD size currently in the market and they don't want to confuse anyone.
So how is the iPhone X 2 years behind any Android flagship right now? Save for the 458ppi screen (still competes with the 500-530 of 2K phones) it literally plays toe to toe with all Android flagships. There used to be a time when if you want good hardware, you'd have to go Android, but that's not the case anymore. I can understand the Apple hate as most people can't afford them:), but let's try and be objective
Aloy.testh irukka
The pry tool
"Glass is glass & glass can break"
I love the way Zac gives Apple a bite of their own "innovative" pie :D
Change your channel name to 'Jerrythesurgeon'..
the most stupid idea in the world. the stupidest way to ruin a beautiful phone
You should do a project where you build a smartphone from other smartphone spare parts
The apple shade is real... lmao, you'll see this in an Iphone in 2020
Giving smasung credit for a Sony camera :D
OPEN THE MOTOROLA MOTO G5 (btw the vibrate motor is very powerful and I would like to see how that works)
I'm liking the new features on the S9
Jerry Anna thopu dammute appu
i think you should succumb to the circles to show to screws
i love how you tear down everything and give us an inside look of these high tech phones
2020: we present you with the fist iphone with variable apperture
Best youtuber ever
You've earned it! Subscribed!
I like that he does what he does well and doesn't change too much. Keep it up!
Camera comparaison s7 vs s9???
Most intelligent YouTuber out there ??
Well now someone's going to murder Bixby!!!(I am) B-)B-)
Can u make a video on samsung galaxy j7 prime please!!!!!
Magnets how they work
Thanks Jerry... The most awaited test ??
Amazing video as always. Keep it up Jerry!!!!
Superb video..you had nicely described aperture mechanisms visually
XZ2 NEXT PLEASE!
worker at samsung: omg is that how it works?
Samsung is the king of innovation......but still some manufacturers use words like innovative marvellous ground-breaking blah blah.....??
You are showing the power button!! But calling it a BIXBY button ??
So many Apple haters. So many ignorant where Samsung would be without Apple.
I was waiting for.. this video ????
Is it possible to use camera from s9 to s7edge?
I've never been this early. Whoo!
Samsung can take down this video ..bixby is their child ????
Can you go back to the ZTE Axon M and do a teardown? Would like to see how the cables are ran between the 2 screens.
>Variable aperture in phone cameras >Something new Hahahaha! Wait, you're serious? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Nokia already did phone with VA camera back in 2009! It was N86 8MP! You can Google it if you want. Samsung is 9 years late to the party!
Looking forward to the Vibrator comparison.
This was really interesting. I liked how you tore down the camera too and explained how it worked. I wonder if it becomes possible in the future to have more than two apertures in phones?
Man! So many Indian viewers here
Can we replace s8 camera with s9 camera ??
Lol Apple will be 2 years behind I have an iPhone X but man this guy lol keep it up bro
Hi ..I m from India. .i love your tear down video
Been waiting for this video >.< It's nice knowing what my phone looks like inside, thank you sir!
Asian?
Can you put s9+ cameras on note 8? Will it work?
"If I've earned it hit the subscribe button..." If not hit the bixby button?
It would be nice if Samsung decides to make a "variable" aperture that really means variable like f2.4 all the way up to f1.5 instead of two apertures only
cooooooooooool
Hei!!
No captions=dislike
great work keeps it up bro... can u make the "Two aperture" system to "Truly variable aperture" system like anything we can use between 1.5 & 2.4 like incremental changes in aperture not stuck with only two aperture.
This guy's channel is one of reasons i like youtube.
wow ! this is awesome man ????
You are great
First the back of s9 was in black colour and in the end it turned clear
Imagine if he turned on the rear camera and it worked - showed the table and everything, even though he removed it.
6 : 09 I guess if have to be nice Apple has been defusing their flashes on their iPhones for a quite a while now ??????
Only hating on Apple, not mentioning that S9 is practically S8 with better camera and cheap copy of Animoji. And btw. Samsung is going to discover notch in few years, so don’t worry. ????
Glass is Glass & Glass Can Break.
super ??
What do you do with the s9 plus?
You are awesome
It's Like your a robot knowing how to disassemble the phone and it only just came out!!!
Awesome as always!
Lego Style Connector
5 : 28 I'm not suggesting murder I'm just saying it's possible ??????
Jack from unboxtherapy
is that the same phone on which you did clear back mod...... you must have done this video before modding that.or is this na new one ... ????????
Guzel parcalasin hll
the apple jokes never seems to end :D :D
BC saalle Samsung Ka baap hai iPhone
As usual Zack is the best!!!
Jerry that wasn't the Bixby button, that was the turn on and off button, thank God u didn't killed it
U must be sponsored by Lego??!!
He is a god of phone destoyer
apple is going to "invent" this in two years...
Pain in comments . Tech slayer :D
You are genius
I like how you burn apple all the time
"Apple is always behind" REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
super
LEGO STYLE!!
Amazing to see the variable aperture working from inside ...Great teardown??
I love how he bashes apple in like every video xD
My phone show charging over usb whenever i plugged it with wall charger ?? help me I m using original charger and i try other chargers too ... My handset is moto g5 plus
Hell yea we want a vibrator explanation video ?? Would be great if you'd do a vibrator teardown as well ??
I got a s9 ad
I am curious how will the image look only with the image sensor.
Unclip it like a little LEGO
Best vids
It was a very quick video, we are not professionals like you. Please slow down a little bit. Thank you
THANK YOU FOR TEARING DOWN YOUR EXPENSIVE S9 AND SHOWING US Aperature!??????
Thousand dollar phone doesn't have variable aperture,but a $720 phone does. I N N O V A T I O N
zack just casually roasting apple xd
Best vibrater is taptic engine
Where is the Vacuum Cleaner Teardown?
Can u put front cam in rear with some glue
More wisecracking against Apple?? you're videos are literally the best.. You're the same person as me. Keep going :) your videos are amazing.
like a little lego
My guy about to do a vibrator video. ?????? Great vid as always!
I wish you would have reinstalled the camera to show us how badly you damaged it
??????????
Ahh that 60 fps video <3
Awesome!
did he say little lego ....mehn
"Glass is glass, and glass can break" The best quote of 2018!!!
So detail, thats why you're my fav
*Apple cries in corner*
Im not suggesting murder... Im just saying its possible.
SAVAGE SAVAGE SAVAGE ! Apple and bixby part cracks me up.
Which video did he make first ? This or the transparent S9. Or is this another phone?
like a little LEGO
Nice nice nice
Apple roasting puns are the best ????
Superb camera
Why are there so many Indians here using bold letters?
Hey im getting unsubscribed (by youtube) from other channels including your. its no problem but i want you to know some people may get unsubscribed
Has there been a teardown in which he hasn't mentioned Legos?
Bixby, fuck u!
Hats off to Jerry ????
Apple must be burning right know with those jokes ?? I love your videos man!
Wanted s9 plus teardown but u r probably using it
Jerry how do u feel when u make 900 Euro phones suffer? Is it satisfying?
So... my Note8 don't have Diffuser on the LED flash.... ??????
Oh my god stop bringing Apple to every video and stop comparing to other phone why do you rant in every video ???????
plz test samsung a8 2018
Waiting for this
Wish you will use a single unite for all of those crazy stuff to save money though Zack is Jery Dig Everything
Apple is usually 2 yrs behind ????????
95% battery retention claim from Samsung - PLEASE...and you believe that shit? Show me one Galaxy S7 with decent battery usage, bought from release. total bulshit and you believe it...
Ah yes. The fresh Apple roast. ??
Will you do a PlayStation controller cleared project? Or something like that? I don’t even know if it’s possible
Apple designs their batteries to retain 80% of their capacity.
Never seen a pry tool get bent.
If you are completing the tear down operation you can assemble the mobile as it is and it can work properly or not. ??????
What happened to the clear one?
He must be an Android,IOS surgeon
very amazing video sir. i have watched this in 4k 60 fps
Iphone is literally 2 years behind.Yay Samsung??
Apple will have these features around 2020. Lol
Was waiting for this video only...
Jerry also tears up Apple during his tear down videos. Love that satire ??
Apple 2020 two year behind
Gotta love those subtle jokes in a serious tone of a soothing voice. Interesting vid especially the variable aperture part of the camera.
Waiting for the video on vibrators ??
This video was just a roast of Apple
No scratching or burning in a teardown video ??????
Didn't he turn it transparent? Exposed
That variable aperture reminds me of R2D2 for some reason
Why do you always hate on apple
Did you film this before the clear build?
Dbrand doesnt't have skins for the Huawei honor 9??... I really wanted one
Hey zack do you think its worth the price????
A little part of me died watching him touch the lens with his tweseers.
This phone is soo nice wonder why ??????
Super
I love the rips on Apple. Keep up the good work
great video!!
Hiii
glass is glass and just like a little lego makes me smile all the time
OUR LITTLE BUDDY JACK..????????
I noticed that this video was recorded before the clear s9 video
Samsung is brilliant
"apple is tow years behind" , burning apple is a must XD
just put some tape on Bixby button contact pad????
*Oooo Pretty Pictures Camera Revealed
Haha know what you sign up for.....????get that Isheep
That's the power button! ??

U have a good skills
Nice video.. Keep the good work up.. ????

"I'm not suggesting murder, I'm just saying it's possible" lmao
Your voice is so soothing
That Dbrand camouflage skin is really nice. Imma get one for my S7.
One of the best vids watched today
Samsung takes a while to clip up a new phone... but Mr Jerry takes no time to open it up!!
Well this was so soothing to watch. Your videos are like meditation for the viewer!
I feel like i watched this Video 3 Days ago...?
zack you make no sense. research stuff before you ditch apple. i have an iphne 6s plus that was bought in 2015 and still has 93%battery retention. and i have checked that. apple did the 90% battery retention in 2015.
Jerry is awesome
I will see you around
Apple usually 2 years behind lol
"I'm not suggesting murder I'm just saying it's possible" ????????
LOL HAHAHAHA "IPHONE 2020"
How long do you usually tear down a phone?
10 188th
Best YouTube er ......
Its really satisfying me
Please, can you durability test some of the cheaper but good chinese brand phones like Xiami, Elephone, Doogee, Ulephone etc. It also makes sense on the financial side since you don't have to buy expensive phones
Apple roast lol
How long do you usually tear down a phone?
Your video are really good & you are great. Love from India ????
Finally video is up.... yayyy!!
Awesome man !
That's alot of inners

Hey there Jerry nice hairstyle

Could you review screen protectors?
Apple will invent such camera in 2020
Hay you torn down a non clear s9 and reassembled a totally clear s9??????????????????????????????????????????

What width cell phone tape is needed?
The first and last part of last part of the video is from S9 clear mod video!!...Good job!! He saves lot of time in editing!!!??
JerryRigEverything It's official, after listening to and analysing that monotone but hilarious wise cracking humor for the um-teenth time I'm convinced that Zack was built by Dbrand Robots.
Teardown video's are so damn interesting!!
Fantasy
Why post three videos of the same phone...!! Even the last one was a near full teardown.!
What if you plug that camera without lens in S9 and then open the camera app. I want to see what will happen's then.
Solid quality content for someone who wants learn how some tech works on the inside :)
hehehe??
15 mins late why ???? What’s inside would be proud
Hi
"this is the same hardware you would find in a professional DSLR camera" Yeah ut waaaaay miniaturized and not as effective. Having this feature in a phone is a gimmick.
If Jerry reads the comments he’ll pin this ?? Enjoyed the vid btw !
i want it... please give me s9
Please make an S8 or S9 giveaway. Like if you agree
nice...

Yo
Ohh yeah sure apple is always 2 years behind... right. Just like the touch ID and dual camera’s
Jerry Hate apple. U said Apple is 2 years behind in innovation. Who brings potrait mode first in camera. Obiously Apple. Samsung also copied this
I'm not suggesting murdering, I'm just saying it's possible
Ohoo
As ur Chanel mention RigEverything, Sir u did really good wit details...kip it up.

Apple is usually 2 years slow! Laughed so hard on that joke ????
It's all in the details! This video and that phone has plenty of them. I'm loving the variable aperture camera!
Your video and a cup of coffee is all that i need everyday
Dude!!!!! That was awesome. .. You are just famtastic at what you do. And joking as well. ??
Funny how the EXACT variable Aperture lens was already in a Samsung device in December 2017, last year. Made a video about it too.
Fan from India
yeah
U should do a custom skin below the glass !!!!!! Making it one of a kind !!!
I have a question. I am just curious what the image from the camera would be with the lens removed. Could you test that Jerry? You already removed it.
Deja vu
14th liker :D
:)
Also, could you do a teardown and durability test of the Huawei honor 8 Pro? Like if you want Zack to do this!
Damn..... Wish i could make it first....i fail everytime

Would you want a tiny second phone that shares your phone number?
looks awesome now they need to make a magnetic forearm holder, so much better than a smart watch ;)
why would you need the special Verizon app to get messages on both phones if both phones use the same phone number? That should just work with any text messaging app by default no?
Why not just get a small phone from the beginning. Duh!!!!!
For those of you that don't know Android has been doing face ID for years way before Apple it ever thought about doing it
The idea behind this is great, and I’ve been waiting for an option to use a smaller phone when I don’t want to carry my massive iPhone 8 Plus around. But honestly, how is this any better than getting a cheap, small smartphone and moving my SIM card to it for the same reasons? This is way overpriced for a phone, and you have to pay an extra $10 a month. Doesn’t make much sense
im getting this and the google three for christmas ?? i
Is this a phone for ants!!!?
Wheres the volume buttons?
We heard you like phones so we made a phone for your phone so you can phone will you phone
Unnecessary.
What a stupid idea lol
Nice gift for my unborn baby!! ??
Can we play pubg in it?
So basically, it’s useless.
It's a shame that Verizon has a seemingly monopoly on that Palm Phone. In my opinion, the smartphone market is in desperate need for a smartphone of that size. I would totally pick one up and ditch my too big smartphone for one of those.....
This is so hilarious and so so stupid
Man creates phone. Man shrinks phone. Man grows phone. Man makes small accessory phone because phone is too big.
Meh. Why? I don't know who this is for. If you have a phone, you have a phone. If you want a smaller (and not to mention more capable one) buy a smaller sized flagship that's not watered down. Then you don't have 2 phones to keep up with or an extra $10 tacked on your bill.
My first smartphone was a palm was cool with the keyboard that hid when you closed it The first to use wireless charging
Isn’t that what a smart watch is for Checking messages making phone calls without taking your phone out And it’s the most convenient with it being on your wrist If you had this why not just use you phone? Lol
Why would anyone do that
I want a watch holder case for this. Great video as always btw. We are big big fans of Bohn(d)
What's the point
I would buy it if it could be a main phone
I actually think this is cool, BUT price and limited carrier support is a problem...
No thanks.. I'll just hang on to my se ??
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones....
A really nice mp4 player.
I honestly would love this for work. I work in construction and even the beefiest phone cases with a tempered glass couldn't save my note 9 screen from getting cracked, this would be a great alternative so I can still listen to my music while having a smaller form factor to carry while on the jobsite
This is a good idea! If your going out to dinner, church etc and you don't want to carry a big phone is would be ideal.
a small phone for ur bigger phone. Wtf is wrong with this world. If u want a small phone just buy a small phone
Sooo life mode is basically your standard flight mode with a different name? :D
What a waste of time and money
Is there any launcher that makes stock Android look like this phone's Android?
I think if you want a smaller phone, the iPhone SE is available on a number of sites. Probably get a refurbished one for less than 1/2 the cost of this ridiculous device.
small is always bigger.........
No keyboard? Fail
No!!!! Lol a phone for your phone
Foolishness. What the people really need is a left hand phone for when you are holding your main phone in your right and and your left hand has no phone in it. Also foot phones should be a thing.
Or...it's an crazy idea, but hear me out.... You take your actual phone out and check your notifications ??
As someone who works in a cellphone store. This thing would absolutely kill it as a stand alone device. I constantly get older customers who want as small of a phone as possible but trying to sell this thing to higher end tech users as a connected device is an awful sales plan.
The palm pilot is trying to make a comeback...
Pancakes...
All I hear is a extra $10 a month
I want to use this as a stand alone phone, kinda bull that I can't
"My phones to big." is the ultimate first-world-problem.
What was the point of this video? Turn on life mode, the battery will probably last a while, but we didn't test it. Take a photo, it'll probably look ok, but we didn't look at it on a big screen. C'mon man...
So it’s the answer to the Apple Watch ??
$350? What an amazing joke. Who would want this over a Moto G6, Essential Phone, literally any non-flagship?
I have a babushka phone. When it rings and I just want to answer the call, I disassemble the babushka to the smallest phone and insert it into my ear cavity.
Stupidest idea i ever seen
I'd rather have a compact phone like that but have it be standalone. Seriously not interested in it being secondary, that's a waste of money.
I'll probably buy one. The reason is that I work a lot and having something with an extra battery with phone features would be a good thing. Chargers and cables can fail and they might not die conveniently. Also, when you want to go to the gym and not potentially lose or damage your $1000+ cellphone.
Google Assistant thought you said "And you can do boy stuff". ??
This is why Im interested in the apple watch 4
Lol. Reminds me of my first android phone. SONY XPERIA X10 MINI PRO.
I figured out a good use for it... say you want to keep in touch with your young child but dont want to give them a full powered phone. Can you use it like that?
Why would anyone buy this
What is a weekend phone and why are you advertising this?
Nah, this ain't it Palm. Come back with a physical keyboard, a reasonable size display compared to todays phablet shitfest, load it with the best features webOS had over android and give us a real alternative again.
I sorta guess this would be good for a young child. But I'm having a hard time seeing who would buy this.
An excuse to charge me an extra $10/mo? Sign me up!
It looks a little too much like an iPhone X
Excellent add on phone
why?? lol
And this is why Palm collapsed...
I used to listen to your palm podcast when the Pre came out it was a fun phone. I had a few of the old treo series and loved them.
A phone for when I'm out getting shitfaced
So... a smart watch but less convenient? ?????
I honestly can’t imagine using this thing. By that point just have a small, basic phone that’s a glorified Bluetooth headset that you can use while your real phone is in your backpack. The last thing anyone needs is to decide which phone they’re going to use on which day
The dumbest thing I’ve ever seen
Zoolander phone ??
Im dying to see Xzibit/Pimp my Ride memes of this...
I bet it could do good overseas if they brought the price down
I like thes one
a phone for your phone...I have an old Nokia that it is great when I go out at night for emergency calls and that is great!
It would be more useful if they just released it as a small phone for people who don't want a gigantic smartphone.
This is basically a smartwatch in the case of phone. I mean... it's not bad idea!
Once upon a time this was a normal sized screen, actually bigger then some with slider keyboards
That thing is cute actually and yes, I want my Life Mode to be always on!
They should've just made this a full fledged phone and stuck a keyboard with it and make it a palm pre phone
If this an android phone why is there the Apple Music icon on the screen?
palm phone se
Or you can just not look at your normal phone. Do we really have so little self control?
I could see this be a good phone the following: Jogging, going to the gym, going to the beach, and also going to an evening event where you'll be wearing sleek clothing and don't want your phablet bulging out of your pocket. Of course if you're out in nice clothes you'll probably want the high quality camera on your regular phone close by. I think people who exercise a lot and who also have some disposable income will be very interested in one of these.
Next! Cant even finish the review
This would be excellent for 50-100. Not for 350.
I want it as my only phone.
Would love to use this as an mp3! I might get it ?? it would also elongate my phones life since I wont have to bluetooth everything (I hope) I can probably sync my watch to this thing instead too
Would love to use this as an mp3! I might get it ?? it would also elongate my phones life since I wont have to bluetooth everything (I hope) I can probably sync my watch to this thing instead too
Well, it's an interesting idea if not anything else.
This is literally going backwards, this is what smart watches have been doing for some time and it makes way more sense and still people don’t want to spend the additional $10 a month
I love it ??
So this is what Stephen Curry invested for? Hmmm
Mad thinking behind This one... IF im going to the beach or to the Mountains i dont want to carry with me something that costs 350 bucks... I want something disposable. Id be better off talking my actuall Phone that was cheaper and much better than this
Can I please have the number of the dealer of the guy who came up with the idea for this ?
Should've been stand alone. The fact you MUST pair it with another phone totally misses the mark.
This is pretty stupid. Kind of what I expect from the verge these days.
If I needed this I'd just get a smartwatch
Should of been geared towards kids
This is just a waste of R&D and materials lol.
"A certain age"? Dieter being the Palm Guy is brought up like EVERY WEEK on the Vergecast.
Cute ??
This is the best palm could come up with, does this company want to fail?
I want small phones. I hate the big phones they push now. I dont need it to be able to edit video or game. Who does that? It's a nightmare and frustrating on a phone. I would totally get this phone but I can't swallow the price and having two phones, Ridiculous...
Give me an unlocked version for $200-$300 and I will buy it right now. This is exactly what Ive been wanting. I just wont switch carriers for it.
Lame
When i clicked on this video I thought “I would most likely use this” but after finishing it I can’t help but think.. what??
I want one. Do they export it?
Honestly this seems like a good phone for your kids when they go on field trips or staying at a friends house. When I’m older and having kids if this is still a concept in motion I wouldn’t mind having it for my kids when they’re old enough
Wow....this is stupid. Why not just get a smartwatch? The price on this is $350. You can get a Smartwatch with LTE for that price. You aren't REQUIRED to pay that $10/month if you keep your phone with you. If you don't want to carry around a big phone, why buy a big phone in the first place? I use an Apple watch and without taking my phone out of my pocket, I can do a lot of things. I can send/receive messages and phone calls, see my calendar, play music, use Siri, get directions, etc...Not to mention, i don't have to carry it in my pocket...I can wear it, therefore I get the added benefits of health monitoring and fitness tracking. I understand that I still need my phone with me (since I didn't opt for the LTE model) but it's available to use without your phone. With this, even though you don't have a large phone in your pocket, you STILL have a phone in your pocket.....
Sure, sell it for $50, with no network and just a wifi and parental controls built in I'd get one for a older child. It's pointless.
What a stupid idea
Let me get this straight, ur selling me the same thing I already carry but it does alot less for a similar price....
1:22 it'll let you do boys stuff
I’d be the first person to buy a 2018 pixie or pre. This is not that.
It actually looks really cool. If they made a bigger version. Say a 4.7 inch screen. That would probably be my next phone.
I miss palm. Pre was my first legit smartphone.
Why can't this whole concept just be an app on your device that just limits usage & improves battery life via airplane mode? & the number is already on it? Or get a smartwatch. It solves a problem that doesn't exist.
Where can i buy it from? Please tell me.
Was thinking about picking one of these up for fun but if I have to use Verizon's messaging app I'm out..
Some please put that in the garbage bin.
What's its price
Where do we can buy it
about ten years ago this screen size is the norm.
Looks similar to Samsung Champ
Failed. Big time.
Where can you buy this?! I want it!
Recently downsized to a xperia xz2 compact. Refused to go smaller than that. I must say it's refreshing to be able to use a phone in one hand again.
Darn. I was just wanting a smaller phone.
They should've priced this at $200 or less, but no more. As for Number sharing, $10 monthly? Was $5 really not enough? More importantly, why does Verizon feel the need to make that as a Service???
This is so cute, but I think it’s too expensive.
What is "weekender phone stuff"?
I´m love!! I want it!!! Great Video!
Wow, takes me back to my first android phone, live with Walkman.
I'm sorry to say this but my iPhone SE 128GB is much bettuh.
That is so stupid, why would anyone buy that
I feel uncomfortable looking at the size and lagginess of the phone.
Most pointless thing ever.
anyone remember how big of a flop the Microsoft kin phones where I bet this will be the same
Looks like a small phone, I-pod.
Do you know how stupid you would look trying to explain to someone that you are paying extra per month for a smaller phone to avoid your larger, better phone? Why just why?
Meh, I thought it was neat. Might be good to hand down to a kid with that extra plan..?
Great! Now if we can only get a big phone to go along with the small phone
If the term "weekend phone" is in your vocabulary, you probably also have brunch with people you don't like and do yoga every Wednesday.
This thing is awesome! You all are missing the point! Imagine you're wanting to go on a run or to the gym or working outdoors and don't want a huge phone in your pocket and still want the ability to make and receive calls AND take a pic of something pretty or a selfie while doing those things. You can't with a watch cuz there's no camera and texts stuck on a watch. Enter the Palm niche. You can hardly feel this thing in your pocket and the texting on it is actually pretty easy. It's so small and light it's very freeing. Go out on the town and take all the pics you want, but without having to stuff a huge phone in your skinny Jean's or your bra. Lol Theres definitely many people who would love this product.
I kind of get the idea, I would actually use this as my only phone to see what it's like. But the battery is just too small. With an 1500 mAh battery this would have had a chance...800 mAh is just too little for a full Android at this time. It will probably not even last a day fully connected.
this is horrible. if you want a small phone buy one.
Can it be used as a standalone phone? Because for those who just want a regular smartphone this looks amazing but if it's required to pair it with a plus phone or phablet to make it work that's just stupid lol.
It's really amazing, just like Unihertz Atom rugged smartphone which i have now. This kind of tiny phone is really suitable as a second phone when go outside.
Can you use this with iphone ?
HOW IS THIS A PHONE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ON IT?
I worked for Palm ?? I ??’d my job and the Palm Treo!
so nice
me too !!! I'm a Palm guy !
What I am really thinking, Dieter, is how bad this review was. It's almost as if you didn't even use the phone for 5 minutes. Wow.
What? Why? It seems that one of the leading smart watches with LTE essentially serves the same purpose while also being stylish - possibly iconic - wearables.
I want this to be a stand alone device. I'm done with mega screens.
Soooooo, an Apple Watch?
I would buy it for work. I'm a bike messenger and all I need is a tiny phone for Google maps, Gmail, walkie talkie app and Spotify.. but it should work fast, otherwise it's pointless. Anyways, too bad it's not an own product. 10$ isn't worth it.
$100 i'll buy it
Face ID? Pfffffff- FacePalm
Port a Pixel camera app to it & get HDR+
This is more or less what Apple want me to do with my Apple watch and my AirPods. And works very nice!!!
I have an iPhone X and I want a little phone. I had a (well, I still do but it has no sim) Siemens S56 which is .75”x4”x1.75”. No, it isn’t smart (although it tried to be: it had email) but it was easy to carry in my pocket and the audio quality was surprisingly good. Enough about old stuff. I like this new form factor but I’d like to see it as a standalone phone. I’m a bit too entrenched in the iOS ecosystem to switch to Android but the idea of a small, standalone phone would be intriguing.
No sim-card slot meeh
My only question is. Why?
"this thing addresses problem that don't exist" - gilfoyle (silicon valley) i mean now we need a phone for a phone ??
I would love the international SIM version...
3:47 this type of launcher looks great for me...how can i find it or similar of this?
It's got the HW of a fully functional phone, but tnx to Verizon you cannot use it as a phone... nice
This is just a cash grab by TCL. All they accquired from HP was the brand. RIP WebOS, Pre3
Its tiny but not full screen ??????? I think it would be better if full screen.
Besides the processor battery and screen that phone has better specs than my current one!
Android? Never mind.
Apple already solved this problem with the Apple Watch.
Still better than my phone
this is perfect for cheating on test
thats the coolest freakin idea someone as PALM could come up with...mannn got me excited
i need this phone, but not in that price point.
$350?? Better buy standalone Android-Operated smart watch
So it’s like a less convenient Apple Watch with fewer features. Interesting...
whats next. smart Pagers/beepers? because that what i thought when i saw this.
Damnit 34gb it's better then my old phone that is big
i could play fortnite on this thing
the stephen curry phone
This has more ram than my iPhone 8...
Get a watch band for this
I am ready to buy this phone or similar size phone if it has standalone connectivity. Phones are becoming too big to use as a phone. Calling feature of a mobile phone is become 1% of the total functionality of a phone.
We need another iPhone SE but with a 4K oled display and all the other flagship essentials.
So it's a smartwatch...
would make a lot more sense if it was not a "side" phone and if it was cheaper
I think if this gets popular enough, custom roms will come out for it and it will become a little phone on its own.
Still has better specs than the phone im using right now
I'd give this a $50 all 10s
?? pixel 3 turned red!! After watching this side phone I mean side notch
Where's my palm treo!? That thing was super fancy, not this one
This would be great at 50-100 dollars. I would buy it if it worked as a kids use this-to-call-me-to-pick-me-up phone. Like a smart walkie talkie, beeper with GPS thingy for quick coordination and emergencies. Idk but I like it even though it completely useless.
Stop trying to make Palm happen
Gameboy emu masterpiece?
I would want this as my primary phone if it could stand alone. As a physically active person, I don't like hauling around a giant smartphone when I'm playing tennis, golf or riding motorcycle. But this could easily fit in my jeans or shorts without cargo pockets.
Did you say it sells for $350, lol thats more than 2X the price of my main phone!!
No, I don’t want a second smaller smartphone. I want my main phone to be 1 or 2 inches smaller. If this Palm was a real phone, with those specs, they would have my money by now.
I love that UI
Now I gotta buy my phone a phone smh ???????
I'll just buy a notch for that price.
Dang! I was wishing it wasn’t Android but a Palm OS.
Can it be my running phone? Load up Strava and lets run.
Id rather take my sim card out and put it in another phone rather than pay $10 a month fot that bs service. Also id rather buy a cheap android phone than pay $350 for that bs
Weekender phone with all the distracting features of any other smartphone? So basically this phone will give your a headache over the weekend looking at the toy screen. This phone doesn’t make any sense! AT ALL!
$350 for this phone? I can get a decent Samsung phone on eBay at that price
They overegineered this so hard. It would have been PERFECT if they cut out the whole verizon/dual phone thing and just gave us a kind of "ultrabook" tiny smart phone.
I hope this product fails so hard they name an economic phenomenon after it. If they sold it as a normal phone I can stick my normal SIM card into, I'd run out and buy one today. If it's locked into a "secondary only" role and you have to own one of those giant phablet meathook abortions along with it, I hope they don't sell a single one.
I'd happily bin my existing chonker of a phone if I could get this form factor as a standalone offering. Seriously.
Personally, i also like smartphone devices between 5-5.5 inches. For me its easy to use and one hand friendly, but now every company is lunching massive screen size smartphone, company should bring back the smartphone sizes of 4.5 to 5 inches screen....
If it use at least Snapdragon 450, maybe I will buy it.
My mobile but as the same spec but it is 6 inch.
Man I'd rather get my old HTC Aria and make that work lol
This is possibly the most pointless stupidity I've seen in a long time. You either want to use your phone or you don't.
Tbh I would gladly use something like this as my only phone.
I’ll just buy Light Phone
I dig it
Palm Phone Hands on Hah.
Yhe berge
COME TO SPRINT ;-; Its so cute :(
Over-priced for a secondary phone which we may use maybe two days in a month.
If this phone was $50 it would sell like hot cakes and be better then having a smartwatch in my opinion but $350 if rather purchase Galaxy s4 on eBay for $90.
Pretty sure this product will fail
I love the size of it.. I don't use any phone after iphone 5 because they're getting bigger n bigger .. a smart device should be small compact and functional that's it..
I feel like this would be good for kids.
Big Drawback is 800mAh battery at this price point
4G LTE?
OMG I'M IN LOVE!
It looks cute, but it's not a full function android phone. I am keeping my iPhone SE.
Why would you even want a smart phone? My computer can do all that and more with a real keyboard and bigger screen, and with a 70Mbs Internet connection.
But does it run fortnite
I'm using a $20 android phone that's bigger and better than this just no seriously just no throw this idea into the garbage
Why can't we just get a new compact phone? Like 4.5 inches or something?
I don’t get it a mini phone for your phone ? Who wants that...
I think we really just need to use our phones less.
This is the stupidest product I've seen in years
Does it also come with a smaller Palm smart watch for when I don’t want to drag my regular size smart watch around?
If the Palm Pre and Apple Watch has a kid... would of been nice in 2011
I didn't see anything on it, so I'm sorry if I missed it. Is this capable of Wi-Fi hot spotting? This will make this fantastic for those of us on Google Fi!
I despise the "neutrality" of this review. Sometimes you have to be brave, be honest and call it like you see it: this product is superfluous. Do not buy this product. Do some consumers prefer a small(er) phone? Yes. Do any consumers (other than the wealthy ones) want to buy a secondary phone for $15/month + $10/month (in transmission charges), that is much weaker and less functional than their "main" phone? NO. A product review should not just be a dull description of the capabilities of a product, but also an opinion about whether or not a consumer should purchase it. If the latter is lacking, that leads me to believe the reviewer is not doing his/her due diligence and is really just a shill for whatever company wants its product "reviewed".
The only reason I can think of that explains why this product exists is so that Verizon can get more customers to pay an additional $10/month. I'm sure the $350 price will drop a lot, fast - but the main thing is to get more subscribers paying more, and that will still happen
I think it's better as a primary phone if you just need something light that is able to run all the mainstream apps. Not everyone needs a huge phone and right now this seems like an awesome option.
i want this sooo bad
The more I think about it the less sense it makes. Maybe if it was geared towards kids or older people. Why wouldn't I want to use my full sized full feature phone? It really isn't that much bigger or bulkier.
I'd gladly use it as my main phone. I always carry a tablet anyway, so my big phone is for the most part redundant.
hey can u plz give it to me if u don't need that plzzzzzzz???? That's Amazing??
Can we play PUBG on this phone?
I have a s9 plus and s6 which looks tiny comparing to s9 +....
I would love to see an iPhone SE 2... same size as the old one with an iPhone X styled Screen and improved camera. This would be the perfect size and phone for many people...
3:54 “You can obviously move stuff around” fails to move icon then segways into whatever the long press actually triggers ???????
Wouldn't be such an bad idea if it wasn't for a) monthly 10$ b) verizon lockin c) 350$ . A person can just say screw it and goto att or gsm provider and just swap sims on their phones.
If you need a tiny little phone to accompany your "big" phone then you have literally bought the wrong phone.
Bring back the Graffiti input to call itself Palm. May be suitable for its tiny screen!
I would "main" that
I'd love to have this launcher
?? ... ???????
wtffff is this
The question is "why?"
i cant believe how stupid this is
Really pissed off that there are no options for people who like smaller compact android smartphones instead of huge tablets in the name of phones... i mean why cant any brand amongst hundreds of dem dint release any 4'7" to 5" smartphones?? jus dont undrstand... Its clearly evident from this video that not evryone likes phablets as it is...! why not leave an option and u know let uuuus, the customers choose which ones to buy rather dan monopolising the android market as such???!
Obviously needs a second generation. For $10 a month, it is really not worth it for almost anyone. I think it would be cool to see something like this totally 100% optimized for calls and messaging (not just SMS but also facebook and Whatsapp) as a minimal communication device.
This is the reason I use a 4.7” iPhone instead of the big ones. I use my phone for texting and responding to other types of messages and doing urgent things when I have no other devices around. It’s small, fits well in my pocket, and kind of discourages heavy use. I use an iPad or laptop for media consumption.
If they sell more than 1 of these, I would be really disappointed in humanity.
Wtf
$350 well, i would go an and buy an iphone SE
What should we do with such a device? It’s rather small! As you said.
where could be found
then the palm phone will become as big as a regular smartphone so they will release a palm palm phone for the palm phone of your phone .........
I miss small phone, but not this small, iPhone 5s is perfect size to me
What’s the point of this?
Does it support SD card?
Good idea but for that price, bad idea. If it was like £50 I'd buy it. At £350, no way, I can buy a cheap phone I don't care about for that price.
My first phone was Palm Treo 750
I love this thing
gimmick. china has such phones since 10 years
Those specs are way OTT. Should be virtually just phone and text and about 300 dollars cheaper.
It’s a good idea .. it looks very cute and if you want to get off your addiction of mobile
I can't see why or how this would be successful. It's like a big smart watch?? Except it's not a watch..... A watch is on your wrist.....this is just a small phone.... A small phone that's less capable of the phone that you already have. ???????
Palm has really gone downhill! I used to love my pink Palm Centro.
still a better display than pixel 3
There is immense scope for this product if they sold it unlocked and as a totally separate phone,would like to see this trend pick up and hopefully some other brands make it
Ridiculous haha
Just a smart watch in a small phone body
What's the point it's still an android phone. Why not just get a old sony Ericsson as a second phone?
This is a cool idea
can someone tell me why this mini phone needs 3gb ram same like an iphone X
I'll be down to have this as an unlocked device. I'd be down to put a $25 plan with 2GBs and unlimited everything else and just run it on the weekends. If work wonders for me if it was like that.
I mean. I would love to own a device this size again... That's right, phones used to be this size, and didn't require two hands. I want that back. I would say buy this as a second phone, but a main phone.
??????
that's already irrelevant in this generation.
Useless
I was expecting a non-smart phone which could provide longer battery life than your regular phone. I don't have this but I'm already sick of it.
This should have been a phone on its own for $100
Such a small phone
love the size
I'm definitely buying for traveling, I wouldn't want to get mi Pixel 2 XL stolen, I'll rather let the palm.
If you still want a smartphone that is small and efficient, Go for an iPhone SE, Its a shame Apple decided to drop it. There are tons of people out there who hate carrying huge phones.
Hahahaha...
Quiete expensive tho..??
This guy only review Google and apple products. The rest of junks gave to coworkers
When it is going to available in India???
Too bad you can't put a SIM card in it and use it by itself.
Cool concept, terrible execution.
Great phone, but too pricey.
Gonna Get this for my gf so she'll stop nosing thru my phone while I'm asleep.
looks like a beginners smart phone
Why?! The idea is silly imo...
Use the $10 a month to get insurance on your $1000 phone and enjoy your expensive phone
I still have my iPod touch
It only works with android but they had to copy the iPhone design. LOL
Bump the screen up to 4' and sell it for $200-$250, I would have been sold. But 350 for what is essentially a accessory device to use with my already expensive phone...... yeah no thanks. Sorry Palm, but you missed a very unique chance to become the leader of small yet efficient budget phones.
It's so cute
this looks awful
A bigger version of Apple Watch.
This is just idiotic. ?????
Can we place a call...???
i think if i wanted a different phone for this i'd go for maybe a used oneplus x or lg g6. both are cheaper. oneplus x is not as big as a standard 2018 flagship, not too small either. lg g6 looks modern and has good water resistance, and a good camera. you could download some apps to make these phones more distraction free. doing that and having your phone in your backpack while going out of the house should be enough, and you don't have to use verizon, do a connected device plan, or pay as much for any of it. the phone design is cute though
Life mode = flight mode
There is no reason to get a separate small phone
The most pointless gadget I've ever seen.
Nope
When this tiny phone is more powerful than your own phone.
I'd want a palm phone to accompany my tablet/laptop, not my phone.
Yeah better off buying a wearable
Gang Gang
Worst idea I have seen, good luck
Very cute. If it was stand-alone and $100 cheaper it would sell like hot cakes. The ultimate backpacking phone!
Who makes this? TCL?
I don't get the "get a smartwatch" argument of some of you. The use cases are different and as far as I remember, smartwatches are mostly meant to be used along with your phone (when you don't wanna take it out of your pocket) and they tend to be kinda expensive as well. Even of this Palm does poorly on the market for its pricing I can see new phones with a cheaper price doing the same thing in the future.
Fecking pointless
I've been thinking about having an iPod Classic sized phone for the last month or two. Where it's small, just use it as a phone, messages, maps/GPS and podcasts. That's really what I want and need. And something small like this might be perfect. Though battery life might be here and there when actually using it (podcasts and navigation would likely drain it well)
If it were usable on other carriers I would consider it. Palm is limiting this product by making it exclusive to Verizon Wireless. The pricing is high too.
If HP has anything to do w/ it then I don't want it
I actually want this phone to be a prank phone but omg it looks good. I might just get it if the price is right
An Apple Watch series 4 or even 3 would probably be better since this is for quick messages and music
Man, just use your normal phone less, why do you have to pay to use a phone less...
YES, PLEASE MORE SMALL SMARTPHONES!!!
You should change the title to the most pointless piece of technology ever.
It's funny to think that was the screen size of the first iPhone lol! We've come a long way in terms if screen real estate anyways.
I still want a Qwerty phone. :[
This phone is convoluted and pointless should have just kept Palm dead.
This is stupid. LMAO
Yo dawg I heard you like phones so I got you a phone you can use while you're not using your phone!
Uh- Verge? You folks have been posting a lot of flashy but incredibly stupid videos lately. Are you OK?
I wish they make more of these kinds of phone.
If you're going to spend $350 on a small phone so you don't have to carry your main phone around, this is just a pointless device. At $350, this will fail miserably.
Waste of time and money...Just get a smartwatch why would you need a worthless mini phone?
Apart from the fact that the pocophone starts at 300, this palm phone is useless IMO
If it was a phone on itself and if it had a headphone jack, I would have bought it. But not like this. This product will fail miserably.
For $350 you could buy the flagship killer itself PoCO F1 by Xiaomi and still have $50 bucks to spare . What a Ripp off !!!
It needs a bigger battery and an unlocked bootloader.
Hey look its smart watch its much bigger and expensive now ????
I would get it if it had physical buttons. There is no reason to get this otherwise.
Having to link this with an existing phone is what's going to ruin it. If it were a stand-alone device with slightly better specs, it would sell.
Low phone + high price ??
Haha, my smartphone is cheaper than this Palm phone. My sim plan is like $3 a month.
It's 3.3"! The Galaxy pocket was 2.8" and I never thought it was small back then
2:08 This phone is better than my phone (Motorola Moto E 4th Gen)
Palm phone because it's small, not because of the company. Why would I need a phone for a phone. Smartwatch is different in regards to it replacing something we already wear for added function. But if I have a phone, why would I carry a 2nd phone to tell me my 1st phone has a notification?? Doesn't make sense.....
Id use this as my daily. I dont use 90% of the features on my s9.
y tho
I really like this
Wow???????
Stupid idea
Im sorry, but thats complete garbage. 50 dollars would be appropriate.
Dead on arrival
My question is CAN THIS THING RUN POKEMON GO
shall I consider it as vintage or modern?.. ??
A shot for everytime you say "you know"
...but why? I wish you'd addressed WHY they made this. What market they're targeting. Emerging markets?
This phone is smaller than the notch on iPhone x lol
This looks cute, but lbr, this is the 2018 version of the Microsoft Kiln.
will it play pubg?????
Lmfaooo Android done took the straps off a smart watch made the screen bigger and put it on the market lol what is going in the world right now???
Imagine playing pubg mobile on that screen
Is this a joke? A phone for my phone...
so basically a bigger apple watch
Give me a holster to make it a watch and I will be interested
It's one of the dumbest ideas I've ever seen.
WHY
Walmart prepaid, boost Mobile, trap phone, $50 tops!
1:22 I love doing boy stuff.
I love this product??.Can anyone tell me how can i buy that?
The smarter move would be to bring a slightly bigger palm pre with the same specs as a s8+ and color option. For 450 and bam sold out
Who the hell color graded your video ? Its terrible
Weekender phone? Oh shut up
make it the main phone and we are talking something good.
trash, just get s9
Why can't I just have a phone that size? It was possible in the 90's...
I'm glad I still have my iPhone SE from 2016 running iOS 12 perfectly fine. 4" is a really nice size for a smartphone if you're not into watching a lot of stuff and gaming. Make small phones great again, plz!
But Why ?
So we can play PUBG in it
Does it launched in India??
I’d rather just get an Apple or Android watch that’s basically what this is minus the straps and extra bezel space.
@verge how to get this palm phone
looks cool, that's palm for you ...??
This is idiotic.
Palm companion phone, kind of is a extention ( with screen n camera etc) of Sony BT headset, which could be used as a handset too (SBH54).
I loved webos. Thanks for making precentral. I used that site quite a bit.
I would want it standalone as my main phone, I have a lte tablet for everything else
Samsung j6+ comes out with sd425 This tiny phone has sd 435 Shame shame samsung ????????
I wasn't expecting it would hve SND 435 as its CPU. It's a proper smartphone in a small form factor! But yeah the price and the fact that it's Verizon exclusive are the major turn off.
Instead...go for iPhone 5s
350$ for this little kid? What's special in this!?
Needs to be under $100 with a decent camera. People with large phones that want to go out for the evening or to a shady area could get use from this. At $350 a smart watch with LTE is a better option. Ex. Travel to a festival or another country for carnival. You want to have a cheaper phone that can more easily be hidden. Ex. Going out at night with slim fit clothes. You only need to text a little, make a rare call, Uber or Lyft, use a map program. If you loose a $50 phone it’s not so bad. Ex. You’re distracted by your smartphones plethora of apps. Semi-disconnect some days to focus.
i think its a good phone for a childrens
From which store did u get this phone from??
It does less than a smart watch because it doesn't have a heart rate monitor for fitness. For that price just get a smart watch.
Wow
A phone for your phone 2018
Who cares about this device? If you need a small display phone, either buy Nokia 3315 or Nokia banana phone.
The way he's trying to talk to viewers about this product is like somebody selling a bridge from The Onion, if they had a satirical ad space.
what about going back to wired ones. this phone business is getting out of hand
Apple watch even better that this phone
I'd buy this in luxury true gold finish
My prediction: It'll stop production within a year.
This is the dumbest idea I've seen in months
OMG small phones again YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and this is why the NOKIA 3310 is victorious! face palm*
This is the dumbest thing ever...Plus it doesn't even have WebOs that us Palm users used to love
So... its just a small phone?
This is so sad. Alexa, GET Off THE PHONE!!
At that price might as well get a smart watch
long live palm
Just a wierd attempt at a modern day iPod nano.
Lmao!!!! Is this really a thing? How stoned were the people who thought to do this?
A phone for a phone? L.O.L ????
The little beast
I’ve been looking for a concept like this for ages
I rather just use an Apple Watch or buy an iPhone SE as my second phone.
What is this.. A phone for ants ?!!!
What a stupid device
Where to buy
would make great little burner phones, but not at the 350 price point..Also would be nice little phone for you Tweens, when you don't want them to have something elaborate.
So it's a big smartwatch (like an Apple Watch LTE) with a camera that you have to put in your pocket.
Why can't they use their brains to make something mankind actually needs. Everything they come up with is just to make money.
Where can I get the palm phone????
I like the concept. The price is going to kill it though, too high. Also, make it with the option of either having it mirror your number from your existing "too big to be a phone phone" or actually just have it be a standalone small smartphone. I personally love the idea of having a well thought out small phone that can run modern apps.
Can I just get that launcher. Would look cool on a big phone I think
Flop and redundant idea which will fail miserably ??
For $350 just get a Pocophone F1 also holy damn it still has more RAM than most phones
Is this guy available in India??
It is very beautiful though, i could use this next to an iPad or even laptop as a standalone phone
hmm i think i'll make a car that fits in your car when you dont want to drive your car but it's much smaller like a clown car and sell it for 50 grand. Makes sense after watching this.
Great idea, just wayy too overpriced, should be like $90
Why do they even bother trying to make these stupid stuff?
Seriously? Might as well bring back flip phones while you're at it
Am I the only one who want to have this phone?
Recoveryourlife! An intelligent phone never never could steal your life, is smaller than people think! This PALM is perfect.
Let us make our fine bigger, even more bigger so we can have amazing experience on fone. Oh no! Our fone is too big. Let us make a smaller done that connects to your big fone. ????
So it's a smartwatch?
“navigate to the nearest Starbucks”
Why wouldn’t you just buy a smaller size smart phone. Keeping 2 phones isn’t the answer.
phoneception
Why would you even want this at that price when you can just get a smart watch that is smaller and is easier to carry!
Just LOL
Phone needed more battery capacity
Dual SIM Dual PHONE LOL
This is a joke.. right?
I think i like this
This is another perfect example of how stupid us humans are.
It's cute tho
Has better specs that my phone lol
Developers of the this phone working harder than hmd-Nokia
i rather buy an iphone se or a 5s
If you want a tiny back up phone or "weekender" buy a LG Sunrise
or you could get a smart watch
Where to buy it??????
You didn't gave the links????????????????????????????????
I'm minimalist thats smartphone enough for me btw smartphone seized our lives..It's a good chance to stop
Nice phone , can I purchase it
is there any competitor to this phone? im kinda interested in this form factor
This will fall harder than the Steam Machines... I dare you to deny it
Waiting for its upcoming models to become bigger and bigger and then watching them launch a small-smaller phone for the assistant phone of your main phone..
But..... why?
It says PLAM on the back, who's PLAM???
So people are really going to spend 300+ on this plus 10 dollars a month for this nonsense lol.
My phone has been asking me for a phone! This is perfect!
It is designed to be abolished !??
Id use it as a standalone for sure, but the premise they're selling us is absolute bullshit.
Seems too small for watching YT... ??
Where we can buy this ?
Cute Phone??
Fixing a problem that never existed, donate those 10 bucks
Love it
This just made me laugh , well you all know why.
It somehow has more ram and a higher processing power than my current phone
This what the iphone x se should look like lmao
Big smart watch it is :D
i prefer nokia 3310
How can I get this in India ?
why not make a 4"- 4.5" high-end android smartphone ? 120mm in length smartphone is "easytocarry" enough
Haha nice JOKE
OMG!!! Cool!! I want ??????
The funny thing is. If I buy that tiny phone, it would be better than my bigger one.
The makers of this have not heard of smart watches?!
I’m gonna start investing my money towards leaving this planet. I don’t know where we are heading but all seems pointless from here on.
$350 lmao, my nice 5.5" SD 650 Redmi Note 3 has been chugging along for 3 years at $200, can even play heavy games like PUBG decently. What a joke of a phone. Shouldn't be a dollar over $100, and that's being generous.
I really like it but I just can't think of a use case for me
IPOD IN DISGUISE
New additional failure to Palm
I dont trust the verge anymore
Nice design. I would be interested in using it as my daily driver, not as an accessory, because I don't want a large Phablet (I use the now discontinued iPhone SE). In a phone I would like - a phone (and messenger, e.g. Threema, no other social media) - a good music player - a very good camera - internet communication for directions and transport I don't need anything else. I really would like an iPhone SE with a full, bezelless screen and no home button.
Tweezers
Thailand pleassssse i waiting for you baby
I really would like some programmable buttons on the sides. on any smartphone.
It's VERIZON?! jeez no thanks
Wtf
Soooo it's androids dumber version of an Apple Watch ???
Or you can buy the iPhone SE.
Does it have to share your phone number? If not it could be good for teens
why they dint use notch?
I want thissss
I thought it was a cute phone that I'd consider for my daughter until you said it was $350. I wouldn't pay no more than $200
This would make so much more sense marketed as just a regular phone. This "second smaller phone" thing is just... silly. But there are definitely people who might consider downsizing and using this as their only phone.
Good comedy material
I recommend the Unihertz Jelly Pro, which is cheaper and also very tiny.
What about headphone jack????? I would love to have music on this
if it was proper phone i would have bought it.
Price is too high they could just go with 1gb ram 4gb rom to cut out some money around 30-50€
I miss my Palm devices still, and my Windows phones. Not sure this gimmick is worth it though.
Stupid idea. You are better off with an LTE smart watch if you want to leave your phone at home.
Review
It's just a bigger smart watch
If you didn't use a Palm Pilot, you're not the Palm guy. ??
Looks good
.....and I want one!
The phone for when your PDA needs a PDA, that's so Elitist. You can't see it but I'm smiling here. You can't "blame" Apple but, this is so Apple. Create a problem and charge addition to solve it. My big phone consumes too much so I buy a little phone for a companion. Reverse tablet. If you've got that type of money there are kids in schools that can use a workable tablet for schoolwork, just saying. My pet needs a pet. I'm laughing with you not at you.
2018 has been a sad year for phones
I want it!!!
This is one of those ideas alright
Its cool but i make it bezelless and im sold
Useless phone of the year...
What the .....?
Why not just get a simple phone, so you don't have to buy a expensive phone to then get a simple phone?
Just get Apple Watch. Does the same and more
Superb ????????
3gb ram?!
Honestly, this is garbage. I would just buy one of the new Nokias instead. Much more responsive for what they need to do due to the lack of cruft that takes up power, bigger batteries, and the physical keypad is better for typing if you have very little room.
Hey buddy Give me away this phone I am poor ?? I have no money for buy that phone
Way too many custom controls. I don't want to learn an entire new way of controlling my phone when I would be using it for the occasional use.
Hahaha is this an April fool's joke?? What's the point of this haha
just buy a smaller screen sized phone.
A phone for people who hate phones !
Palm best feature was WEBos I stll Have 3 Palm pre’s lol
...So, it's a phone for when you don't want to use your phone?
What is the point of this??????
Its really cool. Its like a full function smart watch. Amazing thing for an outdoor workout or when you go to a bar and don’t want to lose your main phone.
It's BS..it serve more purpose than it is supposed to be...and it cost more money than it should be.
At this point much better XZ2 Compact
But... Why?
Really thought that on Thumbnail it is Small iPhone
That phone's actually better than the one I have right now.... sniff sniff
just 3 question 1 will there be a GSM version 2 Can it work as a stand alone phone 3 how long does the battery last 4 who much would it cost as a standalone that four questions
Bro I want thi mobile , plz this is my dream phone ?
I dont like the concept of this product as it seems excessive, but im glad Palm is back
it's a phone for your phone....that makes sense
Useless until Apple comes along next year calling it "the revolutionary iThing". I seriously don't see the process in which they thought of this thing. Was it like "how do we make people believe that they have a problem that doesn't exist"? It really doesn't make any sense and I REALLY hope this doesn't become a thing.
Waste of money
phone for child.
Pointless.
Can we play pubg on it
Can we play pubg on it
I KINDA WANT IT for running n backup phones and stuff its pretty cute too
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww throw it in fire plz
I would want that as my main phone, but i think the mediocre camera kills it
That's small, but I can see it's fast, ??...
Let me have it
iPhone Xs mini?
Seems like a good festival phone to me. Too bad you can't just buy one.
It's better my phone, spec-wise Like, what
2:22 - TFW that's all you do on your phone anyways.
It's so cute it's for people who has a weakness for cute things
I will stick to my iPhone SE any day.
from where would i buy this phone.. and the price
Sounds about right for shithole countries like mine where getting your phone stolen is extremely common. You give them this tiny thing and hope they don't kill you
I want this phone
Lol this seems pointless. If u dnt want big phone just buy a smaller one in the first place.
2019-i want small phone cuz my phone became a tablet
Get a galaxy watch
if it was a standalone phone it'd be great for loads of people
I like the idea. But even if I had Verizon, no regular sms messaging is a deal breaker. BTW - I also lament the failure of WebOS and for that matter BB10. To this day, I still sometimes swap my sim card over to my BB Classic.
Yeah this phone is trash
What the heck is this sheet?
So a not smart SmartWatch XXL? It's like using a Kettcar when I don't want to use my big car!
You lost me at Android phone. Even tho I have one now (Oneplus 6), it'll be my last. No more smartphones for me. I'm over it all.
I mean, this costs as much as a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro(if not more) and the Xiaomi does everything you'd expect from a phone, and more(considering the price).
Why it isnt priced accordingly to its specs.
This is honestly the most pointless piece of tech I've EVER seen. Rediculous.
Srsly?
what a iphone / ? watch mock up.. damn.
It would be better if this device runs android go.
That's just silly. For less than the price of that you can get an iPhone SE. You can ignore that one, too. But you get better battery life, a reasonably sized screen, a stronger chipset and probably a better camera plus more software updates. Got one and I like it. Why on earth would you buy that thing, for the IP68 rating?
I wish it was bigger!
Phone is very good if price is less than 67$ or 5000?. I liked small screen size and pocket friendly phones but this cost too much. For that price i would like to buy Xiaomi Poco f1 powered by snapdragon 845 with 6gb/64GB Variant @ 285$
Lol everybody hating on this but when Apple makes the SE then they say that's so good
???
It's a good device IF IT IS A PHONE! What's point of having a separate phone to not use your phone?
Can i play pubg on this? ??
Aw man i wish I could buy it for $100. It would be the perfect digital, wall mounted switch for a smart home. With the google assistant on it and support for android apps, just need an elegant way to charge it and mount it and this would be so dope!
It's a money grab from Verizon, it's useless.
so its just a big smartwatch?
Yea buy a smaller phone for your big phone... WTF.
They lost me at $10 extra/month
the screen should be bezeless, n the cam like find x
Another way to make money, pathetic. Just make smaller flagship phones.
Love the looks and the size, Trying to find a new modern upgrade that doesn't go over 5" is a knightmare, Now if only it had a better battery life.
Huge RIPOFF of the original PalmOS and WebOS ffs
A phone to use your phone. I have lost faith in humanity.
4:55 you are wrong, my smart watch can run any android app too. It's got google play store.
Why not just use a wearable
This is my dream. I love tiny phones. I use a tablet otherwise for everything else.
ausam amazing gadget i wana buy but not available in Pakistan i try online buying web but none are offering it so hope soon it will come to Pakistan then ill buy it, its a smart phone batter then iphone x
isn't that why they created the watch?
You can always buy a small cheap phone and save hundreds of dollars LoL.
Just make an actual phone please
buy a small phone jeeezus
It’s trying to be an Apple Watch with LTE but it can’t compete.
It would be better if it was a 4 inch bezeless phone..
For 350$?? Very ueseless
This is nothing new /: and it has never cought on
I would have been satisfied if it could be used as a primary phone, You know for the needy people like me...
cool idea but come on man you really think anyone's gonna spend more than $150 for a phone that is meant to do less? you can get a lot of full sized phones for the same price.
what a stupid idea,.. so now we must buy a phone, if we dont want to use a phone.. LOL seriously people??
Its specs are better than my Samsung
This is nice i cant use bigger phone than 4.7 inch because of my disease i hope Samsung or another brand continue to produce small phones too.
Make small phones popular again
Life mode is Airplane mode with new icon and text
3.5" to 4" to 4.7" to 5" to 5.5" to 6" to 3.5" so on and so on common make up your mind manufacturers
Pointless, Useless
I mean WTF , First you spend 1000+ $ on a big phone like S9+ \ Pixel and then you buy a phone to cover it up just because u don’t want to carry the bigger phone .. Seriously if that’s the case why on the earth did I buy the first phone ? Palm you should name it as Facepalm ?????????????????????
Oh gosh, I don't normally comment but seriously!!!!!!!!??????!!!!!??????????!!!!!!????????????????????????? We buy 1000 dollar phones so we can get another tiny one, that is so much worse than the main phone????????????? Why?!?!?!?!?!?!???? I just can't even!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also the UI is so Apple watch... My gosh!!!!!!! I honestly don't know why I'm so outraged over sth so stupid but OMG seriously?!!???????!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!!!?!?!?!
I don't want second companion phone bcz of today's phones are too huge, I need 4.7-5.7 inches bezel-less phone.
This is perfect for when you're in a third world country where you're get easily robbed, then you can leave your main phone at a hotel and go around with this one.
I like the launcher, thats about ut
Dieter you look like Star Fox ??
Useless product But it would be better if it could be used on its own
Some making huge 6-7 inches phones and some making smaller 3-4 inches phones but no one making perfect size phones bcz of market selling strategy. I wanted 4.7 - to 5.7 inches completely bezel-less no chin phones.
Will it work with all carriers.
Why would I need one? I don’t ge it. I’d rather buy a cheaper nokia banana phone with LTE if I want a secondary phone.
I keep thinking- which is that watch he is wearing.
Stupid idea. Why buy and take a subscription for a mini phone, when you already bought a 800/1000 dollar phone. Like you buy the “big” phone because you like the looks, feels, software and now you have a second phone just to not use your main phone.... stupid idea as I said
It's cute..
Interesting but...................
But the point is.. can it run PUBG?
This should be the main primary phone and not secondary !
They market this as an extension/accessory of your phone but has a capability to completely disconnect from anything. So what’s the purpose of this garbage again?
Just get a smart watch
Who's gonna game on that?
Palm phone > Pixel 3
fail
better buy sony flagship compact models
Create a problem, sell a solution!!
I’m sure this is some money laundering behind this
Would be so handy to take to work but not available in the UK ??
i hold two phones, damn they should sell this , would be mine main driver ,can always hotspot to a bigger screen phone
I wish they'd bring back small phones. Would love to see an iPhone SE 2.
What s the launcher called???
I think this thing is great! That "Life" feature would literally work perfectly for my needs. If I wanna go biking or snowboarding I'm not gonna hear my phone go off while I'm concentrated on not crashing; may as well have my phone be "off" and not risk breaking a $1000 device. I want one
Actually this is a good concept for when your other phone is unreliable
Thanx but no i dont have money to spend
I would love to go back to a fully featured smart phone that was small like that. I also like the interface/launcher as well. Turns out, after spending hundreds of dollars on my phone, I only end up using text, email, instagram, sometimes map and occasional calling. Nearly everything else the phone can do, I don't use.
The smart watch is supposed to do all that.
Put your hand up if you want a bigger flagship version of this?
Great one
toy
Basically you can use this phone to cheat your exam ?? that's it
Do "boy" stuff lmaoooo
The palm centro was my favorite pre smart phone phone. <3 I had the raspberry color in the soft plastic version.?? I dont think I'd get this though. Lol...
Rather buy a iPhone SE and save couple dollars.
Pointless lol
It's a good phone.....but..way expensive. 350$ If the price is cut to half....then it may rock.
Where can i get this one
It's better than my phone
Since when are smartphones no longer mobile phones?
awesome! I hope small simple phones make a comeback!
It's basically is an android iPod
Why didnt you test it on a big screen??? What that would take 3 minutes extra? Smh
Finally, a phone that is the right size! I hoping it is 3.3" size! Should have Snapdragon 845 with 6GB RAM instead!
you can do boy stuff...
why not just carry your phone?
I love what you did with the volume 2:50 nice move you got a subscriber ??
Wow what a pointless concept ... weekender phone and leave my main phone at home ?
Total bullshit
Haha same processor and ram as the moto g6. Motorola you listening?
This might be good as a bicycle computer.
who thought this was a good idea
It would be cool as a stand alone
Has a smart phone become like a car now... where you have your daily driver, then a weekend car...
so it's basically a smart watch but bigger and can't be worn on wrist
Did anyone ever think he has a weird name when watching The series?
Yes..it would be worth $10 a month. I am an Iphone user and honestly I cant stand this big phone trend. The iphone 8 is the biggest I want to go..I really do not like putting that thing in my pocket. I did have the SE but sold it...I thought Apple was going to do an SE 3...I wish I kept it! I told my wife I was thinking about going back to a flip phone, just for the size and convenience, but realized I do to much on my phone. We both decided to upgrade to the Apple Watch 4 with cellular...just to not have to lug around our phones...but that wont happen until Christmas. But yes, I miss the smaller phones.
Dumbest idea ever.
Wait... what? ?? Welcome to 2018!
Sell it as standalone for no more than $100 and I'll buy it rn
Wonderful....Wow...Please do a giveaway
This guy says "you know" a lot.
Do you guys know any launcher like this? I kinda like that bubble app-drawer.
No Notch ? thats sed
this phone very nice.. hope they have the 5"" screen...
This is hilarious. Wow!
So what is it? A phone? A phone for your phone? Wannabe smart watch? Dual display for your phone? Lmao
This is stupid
iwatch interface
The camera needs to be good
How much? $150?
Did he say $350!!! you got be kidding me For what? must be stupid as hell to buy that thing and then spend $10 a month on top.. if you want to throw away your money like that hit me up @JGtechBlog youtube hasn't been payin well lately
I like it so much I want it
This might be the dumbest product I’ve ever seen... a phone for a phone? Stop and let that sink in... WTF!
When it will available in India
5:15 Hey guys buy this phone and you get to ignore it completely ??
If only you could slap it on your wrist...
Meaning flight mode ????
I sense it will probably flop. When people go away for a weekend, at least one feature they want from their smartphone, that I can think of right out the pocket, is the camera. Doubt people will give that up for a bit of space in their pocket. And not as compact/practical as a watch.
$350? Gtfoh with that noise.
Looks nice!
Verge to the moon!
a side phone. most pointless device ever invented
I cant wait to subscribe to see a non phone with phone pricing review
STOOPID
Could you play pubg mobile on it?
Pay more to use your phone less and avoid all the phone features your real phone has. I see a homerun
I'd rather HTC bring back the m7 form factor with updated specs, waterproof it, and make it bezelless.
Seems a little contradictory. Pay more money each month to use the primary device you paid so much money for less often.
This is the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen IN MY LIFE!! AAAAHHHHH
but this is all I need
in 2010 this could be considered an android PHONE.
WHEN YOU WANT TO CATCH YOUR SPOUSE CREEPIN U ADD THIS PHONE TO THERE PHONE. THINK ABOUT IT PEOPLE.
Love to see all the possible use case scenarios people can come up with for this.
ehhhhh, I think I'd rather go for one of the compact Sonys.
I like it!! if iphone they release palm phone i will buy!
WebOS was the best back in its day and very underrated! It always makes me smile when Dieter brings it up.
Nice launcher ! Apple watch like interface
I'd rather get a Pocophone F1 for $50 less
Starting 4:07PM with 64% and ending at 4:47PM with 47%...Not sure how long this phone is gonna last...17% drop in 40 mins is a massive battery deal. Skipping PALM - Better remain in shelves.
A second phone for your phone....I don't get it. I guess some people out there just have too much money!
Will be $50 in 6 months. No point being exclusive on Verizon. This would make an awesome tethering mobile hotspot for other devices as long as it's connected to a wireless charger.
Future iPhone
Why
All of my nope.
Plz tell the model no of this ph.
I like the idea, I'd be sold if the camera was high end and the battery lasted over two days.
This is 100% a doomed product.
they just had to have the vertical camera setup huh!
Cyberpunk 2077 looking real good
<3
"Life mode" really palm- android already have aeroplane mode
If this could be some remote/monitor systems for my main phone. It would be perfect
I thought smartwatches were a phone for your phone?, if people buy this they will essentially have 3 phones, their main phone, companion smart watch and secondary mini phone. People keep buying the same thing over and over again.
it's aim towards students. if you know you know??
Got a perfect sized Essential phone for 250. This is 350 to manage your monstrous 800-1000 dollar phone. No thanks Verizon,you're already doing a fantastic job of ripping people off.
This device will fail at that $350 price point... I look forward to seeing them for sold by the truckload for $50 on Ebay next summer.
while this is a little too small, i would hope this would be a baby step (heh) to smaller phones being an option again. i'm tired of big phones! we need options for flagship specs in iPhone 5 sized android devices, perfect for one handed use. or maybe i'm just getting old and every phone cramps my hand
I can’t believe these companies are trying to promote a product you should use less all while charging the same as some flagships lol.
You know,
Super bro
Scam
I dig the UI
Sounds good....... doesn't work
Like a kids' phone
Do you ever use your phone for gps in the car. But u want to text or browse Facebook while driving without interrupting gps. Palm phone
$350!? just get an iPhone se
Aw man the Palm Pre is my favorite phone of all time
This is a phone for people whom are looking to cheat on their partners to have private conversations. ??
When you’re such a rich conspicuous consumer that your phone has a phone.
Worst idea ever
Is this compatible with Fortnite Mobile?
I would totally use it as my music player device.
This would be a good snowboarding phone where I don't want to carry my bulky big phone with me and also don't want to risk catching an edge and breaking my $850 big phone
It looks a bit like the LG Arena KM900.
When one phone wasn't enough..... Such a poopoo idea!
Clearly made for prison use
I want one just to use it as a mp3 player
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones... so we gave your phone a phone so you can phone home when you’re away from your home phone
1:44 why do every time you make a video, you have to mention iphone? Do you really expect people to ask face id on their side phone? People who buy this phone already now what they getting.
My weekend phone Is my weekday phone Mindblown
Whatsapp? Sim card slot? Can it be used in other countries?
When they want it to be tiny little one then why they have so big bezels in top and bottom. They could have cut off those bezels to make it real tiny or given extra screen by going bezeless and having same size. Just a thought. About Palm, there are they? I love Palm and I miss it really much. They deserve to be back in the market and rule it. Haven't heard of them.
You didn't say one thing about how it plays sound. Is there a mini jack hole for earbuds? Does it do bluetooth to earbuds?
I'd get something like this for going out to shows or places I don't want to have to carry a purse. But I also would rather just throw in my Sim or have a real cheap pay as you go plan for it.
I want in iPhone this size!
Honestly? I've been using a Galaxy S4 and Palm Centro side by side for about a year now on T-Mobile. I know it sounds silly but I'd rather keep the Palm Centro on the ground as there's no point taking a phone skydiving.
So it’s not a competition to the iPhone but competitive to phones like the light phone and the seimpo
So... spending more money because you don't wanna use your high-end phone? Get a smaller phone then lol
for $450 you will get iPhone 7. $350 for this phone is a lot.
This is attractive to me as a device to bring on bike rides, hikes or runs. I can use it for Strava, navigation and for contacting people in case of emergency without bringing my big primary device. Maybe the camera is even okay enough for an Instagram story or two along the ride. That 800mah battery would be an issue/dealbreaker though since I can't just turn on life mode as I would like to have it connected to GPS.
I would so get this phone if it were stand alone, with a volume rocker and more battery and possibly a better processor but really that's an afterthought. I don't use half the features on my phone something less cumbersome would really be great
Hahahahhaa dumbest thing I've ever seen lol.. just why.. lol
Doesn't seem that practical. The appeal of smart watch is its small size and easily strap onto your arm. But again I won't invest in a smartwatch either.
Completely & utterly pointless.
I need that launcher, please someone give the link to download it
Not needed, can get a (cheat but decent) 4k tv for that price.
Does it have a headphone jack?
Why though?
This little thing is soooooooo cute !
It is better than one of those crowdfunding minimalist phones
you know its a waste of money you know
This phone is so "first world problems" haha
I need
This is beyond stupid. Face in Palm.
Completely stupid
If this ran AOSP and had a headphone jack, I would be extremely interested.
Why though?
This is stupid. So you buy another phone for your phone so you don’t have to take or use your main phone. What’s the point. You can’t use with iMessage and you need a app to get android text. I’m sry but this stupid they should have just brought back the palm pre I had that phone and thought it was a good for for the time. But this is just silly.
any NFC for Google pay? then I can leave my wallet as well?
@Stephencurry
The Verge OMEGALUL
It's a secondary phone with the specs of a flagship from 3 years ago. This should be sold for $100 off contract without Android, with a sixth as much ram and just enough heft for basic web browsing. Then I'd buy it
So its just a small phone without proper security. Why??
?????
Google should make an Android Watch like that! 1:58
So they're basically reintroducing an iPod touch for android now? Lol.
What the hell is a weekend phone?
What a stupid idea. Who would pay 350$ to avoid using their 1000$ phone? And it's doesn't even have volume buttons? What a waste
You can sell these as kid phones
Plam comming to India
How long until we see a big Apple Watch? I mean Invicta dive watch big.
stupiod
Does it come with a pager?
This phone is cool but direct calls & messages needs to be allowed without pairing
Dear God....they just want the extra $10 a month.
Fail
Forget weekender, this could become much popular as a weekday or all day phone.
Just why would anyone buy this?
Lost interest the moment you said Verizon
Why would I spend $1000 for a phone and then use this. On top of that pay another $350... I feel it’s cheaper to buy a car then a phone. ??
Garbage
Lol thought this was cute but at most $100
$350 + $120 a year for the shared number + $$$ for actual phone... no thank you. It would be cool if it had the features of a good bicycle computer (GPS, daylight visible screen, long battery life, waterproof) so I could take it on a bike ride and still have a phone, but it's not that.
There is a market for small phones. I know people stucked in phones from more than 3 years ago because the size. I think not that small but maybe between 4.5 or 5 inch bezel less phone it could be a thing for a lot of people. It's ridiculous how even 5 inch became "a small phone"
What if you just buy an iPhone 4s as a backup phone ?
1:21 1:22 you can do boys stuff? What's boys stuff? ?????? And also this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard
What the hell this thing has more ram and a better processor than my current phone
This thing will help make sure that Palm stays out of business.
Who in marketing and what manager gave this a thumbs up? Short timers.
Dear phone manufacturers, if you're reading: people want a decent iphone SE android alternative, ideally privacy-focused and bloatware-free as well. This Palm phone is just a crippled compromise but I applaud Palm for bringing back the small form factor.
Captain 2 phones here.. LG G7 ThinQ and iPhone SE ??
looks great. Palm may be on to something here
So COOOL. MOREEE WE NEEE MORE SMALL PHONES!!
I’d love this as a flip phone
I just want a phone that encourages me to use it less. One of these as a stand alone device would be great.
3GB RAM? Ohh just like the cute lil iPhoneX thing
I need that thing my phone got stole because I couldnt hide it bacause its too big now I can carry that phone without it being stole
This would be a really great phone for a kid. Just think abt it. The size, the simplified UI and functions. The price of course! U surely dont want to spend a fortune on a phone that a kid would probably end up breaking it.
lame $350 or $10/mo. I can get a Regular PrePay smart phone for that price as a back up. If you're realy into tiny phones then, no; still no
People who are saying this is a ripoff aren't taking into consideration that people who bought phones like note 9 are gonna buy this. Look I'm sorry your parents let you trap with pocophone but that's not everyone's situation.
So ridiculous
Wish it was a standalone phone for like $150
um... i thought that's what apple water is for...
What watch are you wearing?
So here is my take on it as an investor: If this was a product for doctors to communicate among themselves, or atheletes to communicate within their team or something along those lines. This would be a great product. But this is not for your average consumer. They have steph curry as an investor and to market this. This is how much athletes are not in touch with reality. They think people will buy their 150$ shoes therefore you will spend another 200 to "get away from your phone". Why dont I just go buy a used up iphone from craiglist? Why this? This is my issue with tv stars and atheletes promoting things to average consumer and ripping them off.
Useless, you can get a secondary phone for cheaper.
Nokia 3310 is best for a spare phone..
They overlooked one thing... When the weekend comes around that's when I go hard on my phone. Camera, navigation, videos, basically everything I need a fast phone for. Only time I would need something like this is maybe going to the beach. Shame they used Palms name on this.
So first gen iPhone running android. Got it. ???????
Im really confused. Whats the purpose?
An 800 mah battery.... God damn that's awful.
JUST DONT BUY A BIG PHONE
Is that a giant apple watch?
i can see this being used for a kid if you are a parent and dont want to spend money on something super expensive. And by kid I mean maybe like 11-12 years of age. But as a single person why would you need a smaller phone if you already have a smart phone thats most likely better. Idk what to think about the palm phone..
800maH battery; I'm not interested anymore
Pointless device. It will tank.
PALM DAD HAS RETURNED
It reminds me of a modern day pager.
Would be good for a child just for 10 bucks a month
3.3" thats just 0.2" less than the original ABSOLUTELY BARBARIC ORIGINAL IPHONE ! SO HUGE! (2008)
So a pet for my phone?
This is how Palm goes their comback....muhahaha
$350 = GARBAGE! $40-$60 = SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY...
I think the light phone 2 has a better concept, e-ink display on a smart phone could catch on.
A waste of space
Why not a 4.5" phone with specs like this and a bigger battery? The iPhone 5S and SE are the last of their kind of small flagship-grade smartphones with minimal compromises. I guess I'll just get an Xperia XA2.
A cool little device, killed at birth by its own marketing stupidity. A phone for a phone? This is everything that is wrong with modern smartphone users and the entire industry. I would totally use an unlocked version of something like that as a daily device, since most of the time I have a tablet or a laptop on me. If you need a phone for your phone, you probably need help, too.
It doesn’t have to cost thousands...
Shout out to someone to make something crazy out of this concept
A better way to use it would be 1 sim in your laptop and another in this. So phone calls and other stuff can be done in this, while productivity and media consumption can be done in laptop, which many people do anyway if they are in a situation to carry it around always.
“Weekender phone”??? This makes no sense. Why not just take your regular phone with you if want YouTube and other apps? This idea wasn’t thought out...
This would be good if it can coordinate with main phone via bluetooth, much like how smartwatch works, in case if we don't want connected numbers plan or some short. Like he said, this is kind of like a big smartwatch rather than a tiny phone.
$350 to downgrade to a worse phone? I’m good.
Well the iPhone SE just fits into my pockets. And I will keep looking for devices not bigger than that. But I just prefer the bitten fruit... ??
So apple watch?
Can it do Android Auto? I’d get it just to connect and hide it behind the dashboard.
It's useless, what's the problem with your "normal phone" being bigger, why would you waste 350$ for that, your actual phone would become useless too
Nice key chain. Lol
Stupid idea. Good luck startup from san francisco.
This is so frustrating, because I want a phone exactly like this. Standalone. I don't really want any of the latest phones. When I leave the apartment I want tools to get me places and contact people and that's it. I'm intrigued by light phone 2 but it's never gonna have a decent maps alternative.
If it was $100 it'd be good for running or riding a bike. That's about it.
Can you please put this out without a plan and unlocked...
3.3" is only .2" smaller than the iPhone 4S
play pubg on it
If the screen was completely bezelless it might have been a neat little replacement for the iPhone SE. As it is this looks more like a novelty toy then anything else.
Anyway to get that launcher? I kind of like it.
Is this a new company that is launching the palm brand or is it HP That's doing this? Cause I remember HP was the last known owner of the palm brand
it's the next ipod, but android edition
sick this thing has a newer android version than my G7 thinq
So it's a $350 iPhone 4?
who even needs 3gb of ram on that tiny phone?
This is what I’ve always wanted for cycling! Just need a tiny light phone that can make emergency calls and WhatsApp msg’s.
I need to pee
Better design than most phones.
that would be a dream if Apple brought it out ??
Lmao palm alive again
That’s... the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.
This would have been great if it was cheaper Because the only way I see myself using a phone like this is if I’m going somewhere not safe and I’m afraid to get mugged or something If you still don’t know what I’m trying to say Imagine that your are traveling to a country/state that isn’t as safe as your country/state You will obviously take your main phone with you but when you get there and you want to go out and you don’t want to risk taking your main phone with you but you still need a phone for communication and basic stuff Then a phone like this is great but that’s only if it was cheaper
so it's an Android wear (watch) phone.
You know, you got a xz2 compact with snapdragon 845, 64gb rom, 4gb rom...a relatively compact phone with 2018 flagship specs, for almost the same price, if you want a compact phone.
So this is an Apple Watch for android users
$350? Haha hahaha
It should be able to run pubg mobile lol
Wait what... 3gb ram for a "weekend phone"? My main phone has 3gb ram
Thumbs up if you would buy one of these (if it could actually be a real smartphone that just worked)
Now imagine that.......on a watch
Where can you buy it?
God damn it this is already a failure.
My last palm phone was a treo 650 back in 2004/5 so thanks for remind me those great palm phones and pdas , great times
Just make a normal sized phone which is not giant, like 4.4 inches with a decent camera!
The only good thing about that phone is the launcher.
Small phones are awesome.
This would be a great idea if it was cheaper and less feature packed. I mean, the only reason for this would be to be your "thieves phone". Leave your big, expensive phone home when going out walking and take your tiny with basic features phones for calls and maybe check emails sometimes etc. But it has too many things in. Even 3gb of ram is too much for this purpose.
Good phone for little kids? 25$ extra a month? Sounds like it to me
A phone for a phone? This is one of the stupidest ideas I've ever seen??
So why does it have the itunes app downloaded? Thats apple only
You don't want to carry around your computer, get a laptop. You don't want to carry around your laptop, get a tablet. You don't want to carry around your tablet, get large screen phone. You don't want to carry around your large screen phone... Get this one.
Palm? It says PA lM It’s different
It reminds me of an Archos 29 3" tablet but that was a tenth the price
I WANT THE LAUNCHER ON MY NORMAL PHONE
Hardware - iPhone X knock off, software UI - Apple Watch knock off, great
The pocophone is $300
So this a device that's between my phone and my smartwatch? Ugh.
???? WTF!
I get the case for this phone. Because it's what I like with iPhone5S. It is small and feels comfortable on my hands.
If you came here to know about it's battery, it's 800m.Yes, delete your life's 5 min and go somewhere else.
Pretty pointless imo ??
More like of a pimp phone rather than your backup smart phone.
So it's an oversized smartwatch? :-/
Is not for me..
I can already see the failure of this so called phone. Without sim and high price tag who will want a second phone.
It is not secured as Face ID on the iPhone.. Correct!
Watching this makes me wonder the notch of pixel 3 XL.
If this were a $100 budget phone I could use with any carrier, sure. But they had to kneecap it.
Or you could just buy a high end android smartwatch with lte connectivity that has built in mic and speakers.
maybe its a smart battery pack for when your phone dies...you can just turn this on as a backup
Sounded like his name was ??eter ??one
I would lose that thing in a few days.
When you are a brand like The Verge and you can't even transfer a picture to a big screen to see if it is a good camera. Shame on you!
This made me want a revamped iPhone SE
Stop telling me that I know; I don't, which is why I'm here! Ya know? :p
Basically a iPhone 5s lol
I really like this phone I think it will be good for older people that don’t want to pay to much but just want to keep in touch with family and friends
so its DLC...
Its more powerful hran my nokia 6
Damn was he depressed in his review
Lame Idea. This is just an attempt to grab more money from customers.
This is going to be a mistake. The display size should've been 4-4.5 inches. It makes no sense that it's a carrier exclusive and has to be connected to a main device for the price.
This is bullshit
Pretty useless
What a useless POS
What is the Lauschers Name? I like the Style .
I dont need my phone to have more friends than me.
What a waste of money and natural resources.. ???????
want a tiny phone? buy yourself a SONY XPERIA RAY for 50$ ^_^
Small screen, but turns off cellular easily. So no good for calling kids or grandparents who you are likely to give this phone to. Have to buy with a plan. So no good as a backup phone. Did i hear that right 800mAh battery. You really have to switch it off.
It would be so cool to have a phone this size, but bezel-less
New business model: If you can't make a good phone, don't!
No. You should see my charging table now.
Assuming media apps aren't too cramped on that screen, I'd probably be using it as a remote control for Chromecast more than anything else
I get it because it fits in the Palm of your hand...
All good until "Verizon exclusive" and "$350." Unlocked and below $200, I'm all over it.
It's cute
Sigh, I remember old days of me sitting on the bus, my pre, and web os. Swiping from card to card. Also the honey comb styling reminds me of the apple watch
Verizon getting greedy, bad enough it's a exclusive and it's $350, but having to pay $10 a month is a deal breaker. Making a phone is exclusive is a bad idea especially if your phone ain't that good.
This is a great idea....at $100. It's a total non-starter at $350.
This would actually be perfect for me since I cycle often and id like to have a phone vs a computer to be able to get GPS or calls.
ios has this kinda thing going on for years. it's called iphone se.
?? ??? ????? ????? ,????????? ??????????, ??? ??????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?? 50 ???????,?????? ?? ?????.............
The AppleWatch for android... just bigger... and without bands... and less features... Still the best Android AppleWatch competitor
I never clicked a video so fast before like this!
This is it bois, we have come full circle.
Does it have Bluetooth?
Basically.... it’s a phone....
A parasitic phone. Stupid
"you're going to have to use Verizon's..." You can stop right there. I hate it.
If this is for 60 dollars then it's fine
Imagine playing PUBG on it..lol
But why ?
Why???
"life mode" basicly just airplane mode?
This says a whole lot on the state of Android wear watches that this thing is a market viable product. Ridiculous.
It's better to add extra $350 to you budget and buy a extra premium smartphone.??
Paaaaaaalm!! I miss webOS ??
Will be on sale within 6 months....
Stephen Curry brought me here.
I'm using an iPhone SE to go along with my big android.
For people that hate phones... and mostly want to use their computer.. It's actually great. Whatsapp, SMS and Phone and the rest on a real computer.. Why not?
What’s the point?
No it's not
Stop saying you know
Why? Just use your phone or the smart watch you probably already have
10 years too late.
I would buy it if it was sold separately and for a bit less.
Dislike to the phone in 2018... Like to your video
So palm /life mode is airplane mode.
If this cost $50 and I didn't have to pay $10 every month, then maybe I would consider buying at as a phone to use at home, to avoid work related distractions, but for $350 I can just get another fully functioning phone.
You really have to appreciate the effort they put into the custom Android skin. Its designed to do exactly what they set out and seems very intuitive. Not sure I'd want to use it myself but I kind of love it as a device.
U know.....U know...U know
So basically an Apple Watch being a smartphone, if that makes any sense.
Soon people will have a phone for a phone for a phone for a phone.or a smart watch for a smart watch
Modern smartphones have become so big we now need a second, small smartphone ???????
Stick a strap on it and market it as an oversized smartwatch, and it might have a market. I knew someone who did this once with a smallish smartphone. He was a geek, of course, and didn't care much for style. But there's your market, if there is one at all.
Either get a smartwatch or just buy an iphone se. Buying an iphone se also gives an andriod user the experience of iphone for a low cost and since it's small, it's not bothersome. Win=win
Again the verge not knowing what they are doing. Just stop doing tech, leave it to the professionals
Ughh really that's not a palm phone just because it has the palm name on a piece of plastic don't make it a palm just like blackberry using Android
Sd 435 3gbRam 32Rom. Pretty much sounds like Samsung's mid range devices.
If it was standalone, camera was better and bezelless, i'd be sold. They can minimise the functionality alot more.
Damn! I wish I could get this unlocked on T-Mobile.
But can it run crysis? ??
Thats good for toddlers
I bought a phone for my phone now I need a phone for my phone phone? any ideas?
I’d be surprised seeing this take off.
What a stupid idea. Why would anyone but this
This is a best! 3G ram!?! My phone is only 2 and it's big phone!
As a primary phone it would make more sense!
Does this phone laugh in India ???????
Cute. The Palm too.
This is cool.
Perfect for my 2 year old ??
Useless
Don't really see the use of this and they are making the same mistake again partnering so heavily with a telco nevermind
What’s the point of this phone? I can just use my regular phone. With that price point I could get another regular phone that’s much more powerful than this phone. So it basically boils down to a novelty item. It’s pointless especially with smart watches being the much smaller portable phones.
so basically what my apple watch does with out all the health stuff on top of it and an extra thing to carry? i dont get who the audience is for 350
Deiter Bohn reminds me of Andrew Ilnyckyj from buzzfeed
I rather have a burn phone than this pos.
This is stupid
2:07 You know when you need a new phone when your current phone has less ram and internal storage than this tiny thing ??
How the heck do u come up with an idea to use a phone that needs to connect to another phone. This is nuts!!
I might be use that for going to the gym (if I can use it without a contract?)
What were they thinking ? ... More ways to waste cash
If sharing a number with a second phone isn't exclusive to this phone why not just buy a cheap Verizon prepaid phone and share your number with that... save yourself about $300.
The Ui looks slick but can’t you just buy one of those tiny android phones and swap your SIM card
Love that idea soooooo much!!!!!!!
Apple Watch Please.
As he was using it it was LAG Central...This is going to die faster than the dinosaurs did.
if only this thing cheap, it can be an alternative music player
In Russia we usually say - Eto pizdez!
can Google pls make a step down model from the pixel with the same camera but Al lower tier snapdragon and a 4 inch screen.
is there a phone without anything on it
but why?
Feels like this is supposed to compete with Apple Watch. ??
is there a phone without anything on it
Really, a second phone - not thanks. I am not even into smart watches.
Life mode? You mean airplane mode ???
What was that sidekick device for either HTC or Moto... where you clip it on and it unlocks your phone when you slide your phone out of your pocket? This reminds me of that level of usefulness.
Have you tried webos20090606 yet?
I can buy a poco F1 for around $285!!
they should have used at least 1500mah battery......
For when the computer in your pocket is too big…
Don't understand who this is for.
i appreciate the intent, but if you want to minimize cell-phone usage, why not create an android/iPhone flagship in the form of the deceased iPhone 5/SE to be used as a primary device...? ??
sick people, sick idea. Nothing else.
Cell phones are such a racket, I am ready to go back to a basic flip phone, at first glance I thought that is what is was
Why the hell can't it just be your main phone? Having two phones with the same number is for hipster yuppies with more money than sense lol. "Weekender phone" gimme a break
iWatch size
Would have been great if it was unlocked and standalone, SMH It's has so much potential and yes it's such a waste of money.
If you want a smaller phone the Apple iPhone SE is a full function phone at half the cost of this, I don't see a market for this at that price
So basically a drinking phone :D
This was the form factor we needed, not those TV’s disguised as phones. The huge price is a huge turnoff though.
My smartwatch runs normal Android and it costs a fraction of that thing... Also, what's wrong with calling it airplane mode?
This would be a more preferable alternative to Apple Watch for a smart phone. It's a very good idea and I would really love to see more similar products perhaps from different producers as well.
This thing would sell a lot more if it was just a normal phone instead of an accessory.
I was interested about it. And then I heard 350... Why not Nokia 1
A weekend phone with a poor camera? dont think anybody would use it like that. If this was something you could buy as a stand alone item would be a great kids first phone, its small and just enough. otherwise I just don't see the apeal in things like this =\
Is this what the phone industry has gotten to? I'm sorry, AM I THE CRAZY ONE HERE?! Welcome to 2018 folks. You buy a phone for a phone.
So let me get this straight, the proposition is to spend 10 dollars a month so I don't have to use the phone they want me to spend 800-1000 dollars on?
But why. Who would want this?
This would make an excellent little audio player if it had a headphone jack and a decent dac.
I love it but not the price tag for it. I can use it like a holiday phone whilst leaving my main at hotel.
It's cute I want one
this phone + pixel 3 camera + Snapdragon 660 + 4gb ram + oled ??
Nah.
That thing lags! Just buy discounted flagship or midrange of the last year for $300 and you sorted.
A giant Smartwatch without straps
The market for this seems smaller than the phone itself. Unless mainstream smartphones are too big for you to be able to carry, this tiny phone seems pointless.
Actually snapdragon 435 is very powerful for such a small device which would be used as secondary device !!! Only problem that battery should have been at least 1500 mah !!
Why not just use a smart watch with cellular?
It has more RAM than my everyday 3 years old tablet :)
OR you can find a much better spec'd (but still just as small) iPhone SE on Swappa for a fraction of the price. ??
Can we have just 1 fking medium size phone instead of a small phone with a big phone Make a phone with 5 inch display , with thin bezels or 4.5 inch with thick bezels instead of this stupid thing
it costs more than the pocophone f1
no thx
pointless... it's like having 2 finger print sensor on the same side of a unit..
$100 is the max price this phone deserves.
Basically just DLC for a phone
I want it.
Hopefully it has a Phillips-head screwdriver
Phoneception
That's definitely not what I was thinking.
Good grief. If you must have a weekender, get a cheap android phone,swap out the sim. Turn on airplane mode to save battery and control incomings. This just seems like another piece of kit that's going to end up in the back of your drawer in 6 months.
why did anyone think this would be a good idea? weekender phone? people use their phone more on the weekend than on weekday. and now I have to remember to charge another device? heck no. All this is, is a Palm phone with android OS.
$350?? I'm ready for $99
I think an apple watch would be a better buy, compared to this palm mobile as it has some health oriented features ( not available in my phone) and the rest of the thing's done by this palm phone can already be done by my phone, and iam not that lazy, to not to carry my phone with me. Just my thoughts about this product is its unnecessary ( its the same thoughts that i had for apple watch series 0, but i think even series 0 is more justifiable as on the fact that its a watch and not a mobile phone )
iPhone 2G + iPhone X + Apple Watch = Palm Phone.. ?? ?? ??
Nice joke. It's a joke and only a joke.
i will buy make it cheaper 125-130 dollars or something
Lol I like how its supposed to be a tiny phone so you can use it with one hand and he still uses it with 2 hands like its a 6 inch phone
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. "Weekender phone". HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Yeah... This is just plain bullshit.
Buy an iphone 5s, hahah
So people buy bigger phones because that’s the thing now a days! Bigger better? But they make this little phone to go alongside your big phone because in case you don’t want to take your bigger phone with you? ?? Just remembered a song from back in the day! “ Milk the cow” the best way we know how! Smh ?????
Yo dawg, I heard you like phones, so we made a phone, for your phone, to help you cut down on your phone use!
I used to used Palm phones. They were great. They sure have fallen and this is a stupid idea.
3.3' and we call it funny. iPhone used to be 3.5'
1:22 "and you can do boy stuff"
2:25 tiny midget phone has no headphone jack. So how do I listen to music then. You said I could listen to music. Even the Obama TracFone has a headphone jack
But can it run pubg
But what if I want to leave the smaller phone home? Do I get an even smaller phone? What if I want to leave that one too? Lmao
Get a cheap Nokia
No just no
I'm searching 5 inch screen phone but not a single company making it now a days don't know why
People gonna start complaining the screen isn’t big enough.
xhibit: We gave you a phone with your phone so you can have another phone??
Replaces the tiny useless Apple Watch
Waste of time...
This reminds me of my HTC Aria from like 2010 or whatever
The tiny phone has better specs tham my curremt phone lol
I guess android people could use this but as a iPhone user... No thanks, just use a Apple Watch instead. It does minimal of what a full iPhone could do
Why?
Snap835 that thing is over powered for sure
They should sell the software instead of that phone. What say?
I miss writing in Graffiti.
I don't see a use case for it but I definitely want that launcher
Life mode is just airplane mode wtf haha
This is interesting to me, if I didn’t have my cellular Apple Watch even more so. It would be really freeing to have something so simple, again, assuming I didn’t have my beautiful cellular Apple Watch
A phone for yur child
Still a much better looking phone than Pixel 3. LUL
Subcribe my channel
Is this created by the same palm that designed the palm treo and pilot?
Rather turning the life mode on, I just don’t buy it, and ignore it forever.
Just stop
I was thinking about getting a smaller phone to lighten my pockets on the weekends but this ain't it I'm just gonna hunt down a small android or an older iphone and keep swapping sims
That's the same specs as my Lenovo k6 Note
Is it ip67 or 68?
That looks beautiful
Liked the concept !!
Isn’t this like an Apple Watch that isn’t a watch?
That is better than light phone 2
$350 dollars for a phone for your phone? Android taking the Apple route I see...
Why would anyone want this
whats the point...
And I thought my Xperia Z5 Compact's display is too small...
Need a 4 inch phone like this one with gigantic specs like sd 660 or more and 4 gigz of ram an d battery that lasts a full day
For your homies in the pen
If you don't get this Tic-tack looking phone out of my face. Im not even going to call it a phone any more. This looks like a toy, something you'd loose in-between the couch cushions and never see it again untill like 5 years later.
Yeup :-)
I actually like it alot. It's funny you compared it now to a watch because I initially felt the same. I would definitely buy one. Unfortunately AT&T most likely won't have it. I had an iWatch series 3 and it was ok, but I felt like aside from the heart rate monitor and texts messages it was pointless for me. The price didnt even out for me. This little thing however I like because it can do alot m or then a watch. For me and the job I have, it's perfect. I don't want any to carry around my note 9 all day at work, especially when I'm only checking texts, emails, calls and maybe a little Twitter. So this for the time I'm at work, will fit very nice. Then I can enjoy my note 9 fully once I ok punch out.
Next thing: Finger phone for your Palm phone for your Main phone
$350 gets me a real flagship phone
Honestly I rather buy an android watch or an apple watch because honestly I always take my phone with me
for $100 i'd buy, maybe $150
Please make a video on a phone for this phone. Tanks
This idea only works if it would be 50$ or something
I like the design, but not the idea
$350 to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Capitalism at work
Pointless.
A rip off phone.. on a rip off fraudulent Verizon network. Nice............
I just bought a similar sized waterproof phone for $10. $350 seems a bit steep. ??
I absolutely loved Palm, but with WebOs, not android.... Bring back WebOs ??
So I can get a phone for my phone. nice!
Why tho? I already have a phone.
What is this for?
Steady, old lad, a smakl phond to replace your big phone? You need to take time off work, have a rest, relax. These machines are getting to you
Can this run fortnite mobile? I mean it has enough ram and storage and runs android 8.0 soo.....
$350 ? No thanks I'd pick the iPhone SE anyday.
Still better looking phone than Pixel 3 XL.
I remember when smartphones were that tiny. Good times..??
Facepalm ??????
or just get a cheap Huawei phone???
350$ ? What a rip off !!??
So it’s a Apple Watch competitor?
So, an android iPod?
It's useless specially when apple watch exists !! Like Robin is to batman , apple watch is to iPhone !! .. They should have just made a stand alone smaller phone instead for those who wanna be less tech savvy !!
Stop encouraging this bullshit. Soon, everyone is going to have one of these that they want to sell you. Instead, let’s get phone manufacturers back building reasonably sized devices.
No notch?
Please, please, please, sell this to me with Android one and Project Fi compatibility... Please.
ah look another redundant device flooded in the tech market that will die as soon as it hits launch day.
Lol the app Launcher looks like Apple Watch's. That's interesting tho to try, can someone extract the Launcher as an APK and let us try it on any phone?
headphone jack?
Android iPod nano
Just bring your normal phone! Where are you going!? The favela of Brazil!?
It's fast
350 for a snapdragon 435?!? I got a 180 dollar phone with a snapdragon 626
Pure stupid…
Just buy an iPhone SE.
If this was unlocked it'd be an instant purchase. Instead its covered in Verizon cancer and restrictions. What a sham.
finally somebody else.., I was on Palm heavy back in the day and they made the operating system like forever ago that everybody is just adopting now Palm OS is the freaking man.....
i like the mobile. can we use it as primary phone.
Phones have gotten so big that we need a tiny companion phone now, lol. As a standalone phone, I could see a market for this. But as an "add on" phone for $10 a month extra to my phone bill, I can't see myself ever getting this. When I'm out with this, many times I'm going to wish I had my larger phone to take nicer photos or type an email comfortably. I could only imagine carrying this around for exercising.
Can someone give a decent specs 4 inch andriod phone at reasonable price
is it able to run nova launcher??
Just use your phone normal phone. If your main phone is too big for you get a smaller phone and buy a tablet later
God how I miss small phones.
What's sad is that it is more powerful than my phone.... I'm not even joking :(
A giant Apple Watch??
That is so cute I want it now
Garbage
I can see this being useful as a back-up phone or if you want to go camping and have a phone you won't worry about losing or being distracted by. I'd get it.
I use my number share for my frontier lol
I want a fully-specced flagship that size.
Why would you need a phone for your phone if you have a phone. If you don’t like big phones you don’t have to buy one in the first place. This is pointless and cute.
They should name it "face palm"
Though title..
I would’ve bought this in a heartbeat if it was an actual phone
Y tho
Amazing phone
The Android skin is so well made
Seems to small. I don't think this is what people wanted when they said they want a small phone...
This is totally bs
You know
wouldn't it be better just to buy a $20 prepaid phone and use as a mini tablet with better features?
Nooo Nooooo! We are not going there
his name is so random
Nice, nice till you look at the price.
Like it because it’s small
10 dollars a month!? AliExpress is filled with phones like this. Just get a subscription with a second simcard and buy a used phone.
I brought a Pre due to precentral all those years ago. Still have a mint condition Pre plus which still works albeit with very little function now, so it stays in it's box for nostalgia value.
Or... bare with me... you could just use your phone
is it coming to India?
3GB Ram, wow i could play Fortnite on that
These would be great if they came in a pair. Multiple, low-frills (shared) phones to leave around is an idea I can get behind. $350 for a single unit is absolutely nuts.
You know, I know, everyone knows.
Wow a phone that can play fortnite on HD
Doa
Yo dog, I heard you like Smartphones, so I got you a smartphone to pair with your smartphone so you can smartphone without your smartphone.
The verge and electronics. Name a better combination. Kappa.
I don't get it. It's cute and I like the design of it, but the concept of a mini phone to supplement your main phone makes no sense to me. Who is this for?
Should l use my Sony Ericsson x10 mini again... as it’s more like a palm phone than the palm phone??
Seems like a waste of resources. $350?? Whats the purpose of this phone?? Now you need to carry 2 phones.
Wish it had a larger display ratio for the front and was thicker to have a much bigger battery. I know the snapdragon 435 and with 3gb/32 that's plenty of power for that thing.
I think the tide is turning again back to small phones. excited.
I want one! So tired of phones getting bigger and bigger and harder to hold.
Nice phone if it is like 100$ I would have bought that man
Can You change background on it???
It's a smartwatch for your hand..... Honestly, I really wish someone would make a tiny, durable standalone device about this size.
Having to use VZ Messages is a dealbreaker. I'm actually happy in the Messages/Chat RMS future. Don't take me back to OEM bloatware.
What a pointless idea. Shouldn't cost that much either
I dont get it. I guess its just a cheap android phone?
If this could have It's own phone number it would be a great first phone
a weekend phone...just buy an iphone se and your golden m8.
Oh...no...
When your phone is a chocolate
should've just launched another Pre TBH to capture some nostalgia. This is nonsense.
And the award for the worlds most stupid idea goes to................ PALM
It's only the name. I loved Palm and Web OS. Web OS was centuries ahead of any operation system right now like synch, messaging and multitasking. Palm died long ago and sometimes you have to left the dead behind, sadly.
I don't know why i realy love this phone.. Small and handy..
This is a good alternative to iPhone SE in terms of size, but they need to make improvements and well I am not on Verizon so they need to sell this thing unlocked.
We all feel your pain Dieter ???
Should be $150
$30 will be a slamdunk
now run pubg!
*My other phone's a Pixel 2
So its just a tiny phone with a watch interface
Wear os on a phone
It's kinda ridiculous IMO ????
I would buy this as an iPod replacement ???? oh wow
Smaller than the pixel 3 xl notch
If it was 30M water resistant Dust resistant fire resistant shock resistant It would be nice for your expensive phone( i dont know its price)
What a stupid product. I can believe this is what palm came up with and when it flops they’re gonna wonder what happened and why they’re not relevant. It’s such a shame too, because this thing is actually really cute and the os is really aesthetically pleasing like we’re used to from palm. It’s a waste of talent.
I remember the Palm pre
So let me get this straight. It's a phone for your phone, so you don't have to use your phone and if you want you can turn of your phones-phone phone mode off so your don't have you use your phones-phone? very confusing.
This little thing has far better specs than my smart phone.??????
Phones have been becoming bigger and bigger for the last 10 years. Now they're going backwards.
THIS is why palm died in the first place, LOL What genius with amnesia came up with this
What is this? A phone for aunts?
Im still not sure what the point of this is, who is this for?
This is the most pointless product lol
Wish you could buy it for around £30 outright just as a new iPod like phone
That's a phone, with purpose of communication and no addiction.
I just miss good small phones.. I simply hate huge screens..
This is the dumbest invention ever
Banter
Looks nice. M Missing the PalmOS though.
This should be a launcher.
Now this phone going to go bigger day by day then we need a third phone in 1922....
I would've loved to get this if only it was a true standalone device.
Ram and storage is even bigger than my phone. :'))
A phone for your phone?
Weekend phone? What sort of bourgeoisie need is this? 800mah battery? No. Not worth 25 a month.
Like this!!!
$350? Heh, it's a nice idea for april's fool's day. Otherwise, it's a bad joke. You can literally see the lag, and the lack of responsiveness.
$350? Verizon exclusive? ??
worst product of 2018
A stupid idea . As the kids nowadays say : Epic Fail .
Someone was high to come up with this idea. A phone for a phone that is stupid
??
Can You Give It As Giveaway For Me??
Imagine if Palm did this with iOS? $$$$
Omg that is exactly what i imagine to have for a long time, since manufacturera started to make freaking huge screen smartphones So sad that it's only for Verzion, I'm wishing this from overseas
Is there a SIM card holder?
Wow I like that app drawer ??
At 2999 Rupees This would sell a ton in India, especially with a jio integration
Love it
It must be available with Sim card feature supporting other carriers too.
this reminds me of when palm was trying to make that DOA foleo.
A monumental waste of money
Still better than SAMSUNG J6+ spec wise
A tiny iPhone X
Wish it was all screen in this size. I would buy it without thinking if it was about $150.
This is so weird lol
the specs on this are better then my moto g4...
Cool idea but the screen is way to small
This is a solution looking for a problem
Can I have that launcher
Is it running PUBG???????
So it's a phone?
Dieter is soo happy
price????
I sell phone for living and I think the phone is not a bad idea but the price is too high. I rather get the iPhone 5se. That's the reason why most of the cellphones company are losing the customers because the stupid price . Really you want to come back to business with this stupid price . I will see some people buying the phone but it will be a lost for the company
I think there could be a market for this phone. But at $350, it kills any chance of selling. If it was maybe $100-$150, it could work. Perfect phone for those that need to carry two phones for work/business. Or as a throw-away for when you don't want to bring your main $800+ phone to concerts, parties, hiking, etc. I'm glad they're treating it as a Connected Devices versus a full-fledged phone. Then it would have even less of a chance of being worth anything.
Loved it. I need it
I would use that launcher.
How much Price
What on earth is the point of this? Just buy a smaller cheap Android phone and swap the SIM back and forth tbh
I prefer the Light Phone 2
$350? I think that's a bit much, maybe $150 or even $200. It's cute and stuff but I don't think it's worth that much
What about a smart watch
Is it available in india
I would love this with full screen
So, could it be used (with a few exceptions) like an Apple Watch?
Video is best
I don't understand the phone for your phone thing but if this starts a craze of companies making standalone mini phones, I'll be all over that.
Cute Phone, thank you Dieter! =D
Where I can get the launcher?
Is it bad that, this phone is better than my normal sized phone?
Bezel less iPhone 4
so stupid, get a qwert slide out keyboard android phone instead
That single button will be a nightmare to use.. I have an Elephone S8 (worst phone I've ever owned) and say your on a web page, and want to get to the home screen, i have to bring down the notification shade and then double tap it to go home. Otherwise when you exit, it will also make you go back through the web page. Super annoying
Finally a small phone in 2018 with good specs
If this runs any Android app, you can use pulse sms and access your sms on a web browser across platforms
Looks interesting.. but very niche . I would rather have one 5inch phone and be done with it.
Yo dawg We heard you like phones...
suddenly minimal phones are becoming popular and few companies are asking for ridiculous price for these devices . china needs to step in to tap this market segment to lower the price
It already seems laggy, I would rather buy Nokia 3310
What a good replacement for iPhone SE, guys if apple camcled iPhone SE 2 u can try this instead.
You know..
This seems pretty pointless to me.
I see Fleksy there
trash
I wonder why BlackBerry is the only phone manufacturer with the physical keyboard. I am really bored when I have to do a lot of stuff on my phone ??
$350 kidding me
Have a sim slot in it and you have a perfect phone.
Wow so the biggest feature of this phone (life mode), basically turns it into... Not a phone... 350 dollars... Fantastic.
It looks like a mini iClone X! What was Palm thinking, especially at $350! ???????????
The world damn sure is changing lol very interesting tho
Palm Phone: Money tu burn!
Hold up so this thing costs more than a galaxy s7 nowadays, and is less capable than a galaxy s2? what a ripoff
A cute but useless device. Maybe if you're gonna give your 3 year old a phone? Why does it even have a camera on the back? Why would you want to use the camera on that little thing? ???? It reminds me of the last iPod nano. The way apps look on it and the UI looks similar to me.
I’d use this as my actual phone
Missed the ball on this completely. Sell it as a stand alone, I would want something like that. But as an ad on phone?? That's just stupid (and a rip off).
It's actually nice!
Wow! What an amazing usp it saves 30 seconds a week which you would spend on putting your sim card in and out the cheap, old beater phone you bought for pennies on the dollar
This seems like a great phone to bring out on town when you want to be social, but still need those basic phones features. Also.. its tiny, will easily fit inside your pocket without ruining your look (for those that care about that).
I'd rather buy a Series 4 with LTE
Apple watch you can hold up
Can someone please make this software into a launcher for regular Android devices?? I would totally use it. Love some of the features on this device
Id love a small phone like that with powerful specs, not an alternative or second phone :/
It looks really nice does it have a headphone jack?
Wow this one is even more of a come back than Nokia or Blackberry, now thats what I call creativity at it's best! Good job PALM!! Y'all have done a good job!
So basically a terrible iPhone 3gs with Android
If it were a separate phone I'd buy one for my dad. He doesn't like big phones. But as an add on, tough sell.
I like this. I would get one and just keep in my car just Incase I need it.
It looks like an iPod for Android.
I will look forward to the pixel mini phone
I would LOVVVEE a phone that size.
Give this phone a nice plastic construction, a sim card tray and remove the front camera and sell it for $50-$100 and you have a nice secondary phone which you could take along with you on hikes, camps and such where you wouldn't want to risk your precious premium phone.
not usefull in any manner.
It doesn't really make much sense. I can't think of ways a supplementary phone might be more useful than a phone and a watch. A better supplementary watch might have been much better since we don't really need all the functionality of a full phone most of the time and it'd save us bringing, or at least taking out the phone as often. + leaving the phone at home for workouts would be a lot better.
just bring back palm pre 3 or plus then put an android.
Next up: unbox therapy “I’m switching to the palm phone”
That phone is faster than my phone
Why doesn't it have web os?
My watch can do that why would i need that
Wish it was a real phone...??
Honestly it's a nice gadget, I would have made a hand band to stick it to the wrist and make it a kind of hybrid smartwatch-smartphone though.
literally no one will buy this
Lol...no matter how hard he tried this device doesn't make sense. I've never heard anyone say they want a "weekend phone". Then he says it's meant not to be used that much...so then why buy it? Name one person you know who wants to add $10 to their smartphone bill. It's a smartwatch that you carry and that's just a bad idea.
Cutest phone of 2018.
Such a cute little device. ??
1993: there'll be flying car in 2018 2018: android phone for phone
The front is a8 2018 and back is iPhone x
But can you store in the Pixel 3 XL notch?
NO
If it had its own number this would be a good pre-teen phone.
I want this phone ??
Ideal phone for daily commute or for those who have small hands basically. I dig it
Neat idea, terrible pricing
Reminds me of the light phone 2
This is now stupidity at it's best. So you buy a smaller phone to not walk around w/ your larger phone? Folks need to reassess their lives.
Would be interested if it was stand alone.
it looks decent and professional at same time.... but price is just a rip off
This is a pretty good phone being sold for stupid reasons. A phone for a phone? Just silly
wow this is amazing... simple and professional... i would use it for work only... but it is interesting.????
Give this thing a headphone jack, sell it individually and it'll replace my iPhone 5S.
Seems useless
Good for the 3rd world market. Not worth the investment.
But.. why?
Why would anyone want this?
Nice...& cool...
Dieter bohn
So it's a text message phone that doesn't do text messages right.
Unbelievably useless
so its a galaxy watch in a candybar form factor with no wrist strap.
Whyyyyy??????
Lol what a worthless phone ??
Just another kind of toy...
",ya know"
This is why I bought (and use) a iPhone SE. I wanted a small but powerful phone. Please Apple...release an updated 5 inch iPhone!
jees buy a nokia 3310
More expensive than something like... The Pocofone.
Isn't it just watch sold as a small phone?
here's a question,why didn't Dieter ask a question today??
Web OS ?
1:21 heheheh, you can do boy stuff :)
Omg the spec is powerful than my phone ??
I really like that menu style, kinda suits it, wonder if it would work on a big phone, wish google would roll out some beta version of android with that option
Should be priced at no more than $100-125
So basically it’s an Apple Watch series 3
Does it has whatsapp
He is wearing a nice shirt BTW
So in 10 months, it would cost as much as a standard Apple device. Hmmm.
Please, don't begin to put emojis into your thumbnails!
This may make no sense for some people
Maybe i need this than the smartwatch,but the price make me to think again do i need this.. and will this phone work in my country??
Am I the only interested in this being my main phone? LOL. Maybe not THIS necessarily but I am very interested in trying a tiny phone again. Just much less distracting. If I really wanna get deep into media at home I have my tablet.
Not interested in the phone's phone at all but the UI looks really good. Hope someone comes up with a Launcher that resembles this!
I like the idea on home button, tap one for back twice for home and hold it for task manager. Anyone could tell me pls what else beside this phone that has that feature ? Or maybe a custom rom.
If this was it's own phone and had a headphone jack this would be my dream phone
Dieter! You used the Centro. That's amazing. That was my first smartphone. I didn't even have a data plan with it. I loved that phone to death. It was bulletproof as well. Ironic I say that because it got shot and no longer works lol
Yo dawg, we heard you like phones. So we made a phone for your phone.
This device is quite possibly the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.
Caveat is one of the most overused words in tech YouTube...smh
$350?? You might as well buy another phone for that price...
350, WTF I'd rather buy PocoF1
Maybe it's only a reminder that WebOs is the father of the mainstream UI nowadays...And PALM proved that they can crate better UI on a small screen...that's it. Not a buy definitely.
Why?
how to buy in india?
Shut Up And Take My Money!!!!
This is nice, but is it actually smaller than the iPhone 4?
A phone for when you don't want a phone. It's a phone for your phone. It's a phone to show you why you love your other phone. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a phone!
If this was $100 I would consider it. But over $300!? What a joke.
Where do I buy from?
This is totally unnecessary.
If it wasn't a Verizon exclusive I'd consider it as like an iPod Touch kind of scenario.
Awesome video ????????????
okay, but after this I want even smaller phone for my phone for my phone
Hey Palm, 2008 called... I bet they want it back, but you were on Life Mode.
$350? They've lost their minds. $99-$149 would be the accurate price.
Really pointless phone.
I can't imagine that anyone needs (or wants) this.
It's a sad day when in a age of phones getting so big, and they do so much, we now have to buy a cellphone for our $1,000$+ phones... Sigh
Yo dawg, i heard you liked palm phones....
$350?!?!?!?! plus $10 monthly?!??!?!?!Give me iPhone SE please.
Why?
I'd put my money on the Light phone 2 instead.
atleast it looks better than pixel 3 xl
Anyone rich enough here to buy me a budget gpu?
Hey Verge! Which cameras do you guys use to film these reviews? Thank you
For $350 you can get a Nokia 7.1 with much better specs. I guess this is going after a niche but it's priced way too high
3.3 inch so this is almost the same size as the iphone 2g screen XD
Did he just say that it costs $350 lololol
I like the interface
Stop trying to bring back discontinued tech, Diets...
I don't understand how someone besides fans of the brand itself would spend 350$ to get a phone with specs like this. It'll be way more worth it getting a Xiaomi phone or any other budget phone which would have much better specs.
But how do we know you are not a giant?
this phone is not for sale outright
It should be without any bezels and minimum screen size of 4.5-5 inches, internals irrelevant, it needs to be at least as big as iPhone 4, not smaller...
Idiotic phone.
It's cute but so expensive and useless.
why would I buy another phone to leave my phone behind? And if I leave behind my phone, why would I buy that phone in the first place? Doesn't make sense.
Bring cheap Android smartwatch, thats way better
I wish they made it just a little bit bigger so i could use it as a full time phone, like a successor to the iPhone SE.
Really 350
sounds like something we should all switch to in order to start being off our phones more.
This is basically a smart watch
what a stupid concoction. You could just get a tiny phone or a smartwatch
Dieter is the only one that will even ponder this purchase
I want this now
10 bucks a month? For what?? My contract includes up to nine SIM cards at no extra cost with one number, so I'd rather just buy another phone, let's say a cheap Nokia 3 and put another SIM in there. Hangouts can run on multiple devices with the same account.
Dieter getting into his own element. I'm overjoyed rn.
Can it run pubg??
So it's a phone I can carry more easily than the phone I carry every day and have no problem carrying?
Well that phone is going to compete with other wearables. It’s going to be hard to win over portentoso customers because wearables make more sense then a phone for a phone you already have.
This is weird. It has too much stuff to be a “disconnected life” phone, so it ends up being a too combobulated , slow ACTUAL phone rather than something like the Light Phone 2.
That looks like a pretty good basic phone! Can you use it without a different phone? My grandparents would probably like it.
Looks like it run like an Android phone from 2009 haha
So what's the difference between that life mode and airplane mode?
Very very cute I liked it Hope it would be available
What a world
BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > BIG > MEDIUM > SMALL > *the trend phone's size revolution
"We'll have a cure for cancer in the future" 2018 ....
This will fail horribly. Dead on arrival.
Palm should remain dead
Headphone jack???
This could've easily run on Android Go instead of standard Android. It would've cost much cheaper
3.3 inches? My first Android phone was 3.2 inches. I don't think it was this small! Lol
No use. phone for phone, what's next car for car........??????
Really, is this product absolutely necessary? Personally don't see a point to this concept, the whole idea of a mobile phone is that you could take it with you and the product began getting smaller and thinner and then we got the smartphone and they averaged 3.5-4". Then technology began advancing with phones becoming smarter and not just being used to phone others but instead to browse the web, play games, watch Netflix, go on social media, use maps etc. The whole idea of having a bigger screen compensating the need for something bigger and I don't think there are any real flaws with a slightly bigger display. Currently many flagship phones and budget phones offer a larger display phone and a smaller display phone and if you don''t want to lug around a massive display everyone then it only makes sense to buy a smaller display phone. Having another device really complicates things and I mean most phones now-a-days will fit in your pocket or in a small bag.
Uhhhh no.
Palm pre ftw
Inception. Phone for your phone.
It can be fitted in Pixel 3XL notch
At least it doesn’t have a notch
This made me miss my moto defy ????
This is the dumbest thing ever. Why would anyone in their right mind would pay 350 for this?
good for the senior citizens, they do complain about size.
I like the launcher can I get it on my pixel 2 xl?
Son of iPhone X & Google Pixel
but will it play fortnite?!!
If this were a 100 dollars it would be a good
I really like this and I wanna buy it.
Ok, but why don't i wanna bring my regular phone places? What makes this in any way a better option than a smartwatch? Who is this for? What purpose does it serve? So many questions about how this even got made...
I've always liked plams.
Small phones are severely underrated. You will never know how awesome it is unless you try it yourself. It minimizes your screen time / chat time while getting the job done. People unfortunately compare their price to other cheaper flagships and forget the main features of these phones; to make you more comfortable and more productive. I would easily pay 500$ for this rather than a one plus 6 for that reason.
What a cute and worthless little thing.
Why ?
This is what I want from the iwatch. The confidence to leave my phone for days.
That would make a great TV remote... but the price?
This could actually be successful. There are lots of people that want a small smartphones to just google something on the go or call someone. The market is full of gigantic phones; small phones have become a really rare thing
This is just plain stupid, trying to do something which a smart watch is supposed to do.
If google would just put out a primary pixel phone this size with a good camera, I'd be ALL OVER IT, PLEASE. Why does my phone need to be so big??
so no headphone jack.. sigh!..
Erm I fail to see the utility myself but you do you
omg if this is available overseas, unlocked, for that size, I will definitely buy it!
Play pubg
Before 50k
Why would anyone want this
it's depressing to see these has-beens trying hard to come back into the ring
UI looks good??
Practically useless
History Repeats Itself . . Hence, Proved!
Completely useless.
I can't believe that we have 3GB of RAM in a tiny phone.
Why would anyone spend almost a thousand on a. Phone to not use it, and use a crappy version instead
STILL LOOKS BETTER THAN THE PIXEL
I think that if it was waterproof and maybe a little durable (some sort of shock absorbent back/sides) i think this would make a very good 'outdoors' phone, which you could take with you when you go out hiking or something.
Straight up copied apple’s music logo
This phone make more sense than pixel 3xl notch and iphone xs mas price
It's so cute. The hardware and especially the software seem to be very polished as well. I want that launcher.
We will eventually make Phone for phone for phone for phone for phone
This could be really, really great. I'd love a phone where I could do everything necessary - calls, texts, pay bills. Too bad there are so many restrictions on it; price included.
If the screen were 4.0" I would seriously consider getting one of these as my main phone.
The perfect weekend phone is iPhone se, its just sad that apple no longer sells it.
I'd buy for $150
Would probably still get addicted to it regardless????
iPhone SE is $199
If i knew this day would come, i would have bought a tablet and one of those phones which used to be regular sized. Next thing you know, you could be using another phone for your phone which you bought for your original phone. lol
If a famous company,just one or a couple of companies created this sort of small and compact phone,make it much bezel-less,largen the battera and the megapixel of the front camera and make it cheap,then I WOULD buy it. NO JOKE........
This thing is painfully slow.
Is this the new Apple Watch Max I keep hearing about?
Can you put your real SIM in there?
Oooor just get a full Android smartwatch? You know, the ones with normal Android, which can download any app, include a sim tray and sometimes a microsd tray, and are overall a much better product than this is!
Or, you know, just get a better phone like the iPhone SE. Palm is definitely dead after seeing this.
I wonder who came up with this useless idea? A pocophone is the same price I’d rather get a pocofone beside my iPhone. I don’t need two phones but if I did why would I pay that much for such an underpowered device if I wanted a phone to just make calls I would get one of these super old phones that don’t even run apps. I see no point in browsing or watching YouTube on this super small screen, maybe music makes some sense. I don’t usually have a need to point out the flaws of stuff I’m not interested in but this thing is just one big, or rather small??, mistake.
A phone for your phone. What's next? A laptop for your laptop?
This is the saddest thing in tech I have seen in a very long time.
I'm more interested with the launcher. I think it's cool
Waste of money
Goodluck finding it when you turn that palm mode on?????????? Bcoz that thing is going to disappear within seconds??????
I'm a bit disappointed about the review, that seems a better phone than shown, it deserve more credit in my opinion
Ok not exactly a powerhouse but ironically packs more ram than my iphone ....
But.. but.. does it has? a headphone jack?
Hashtag joke! ??????
Tailored to make developers crazy again about the minimum size of phone screens. ?? Android in general deal with size layout so well, automatically, but to an optimal experience the dev need to do some fine tunning. For a long time we don't need be worried about very small screens, but with this damn thing, the good time is probably over...
can i use it as main phone
where is this world heading...
A phone for a phone...why?
This is actually quite nice looking device! ??
Who wants tiny phone nowadays? Gone were the days of nokia 8210.
It is an android phone, cannot use android messages, but can sync iMessage! ??
3 GB ram? Wtf man??
I like it's UI.. And that long press with the option of that particular app.. like apple 3d touch is cool.. I would buy it if it can a carry a sim card
Hands on?! More like palms on I’ll leave
Android Auto works?
Maybe its just me but maybe get rid of the camera and put more battery in? SInce its a compliment to your actual phone just go all the way and make it just for calling and music.
Whyyyyyy, it doesnt make any sense. Either use it as a main or dont buy it. If u want to buy a cheap phone for when youre out and about, get a pocophone, its cheaper and it has a way bigger battery.
Sd435? No nfc, No face/touch id, no ip67 rating, no headphone jck. No buy!!
Pointless. We have smartwatches as backup
Buy iPhone se
I love small phones........enjoyed typing one handed back in the old days.........but this is overpriced and too small.......it should have been 4 inches and priced $200.
Where can i get one?
Companies making fool of people by making big phones, notch, no headphone jack, etc. etc....why not make a 4.5 inch to 5 inch screen phone...and it will be a allrounder.. No need of all extra stuff like this Palm Phone..
I have a super small cheap android phone from company called lava. I just put my sim in that phone when I want to switch to smaller phone.
Still better than my phone
Convient how I am watching on the biggest iOS device u can get!!??????????
I can see this being good for when you go to work and need less distractions from your primary phone or when you go on vacation.. I don't think it's a niche device over all.. Time will. Tell..
They should make a phone like this but bezel less like samsung or lg or other phone manufacture with taller display, and without notch.
This isn't a phone. It's an inconvenient smart watch. Why can't anyone just make a fully featured small Android phone?
Thats a cute phone!
You know!
Not for me
350$? I thought it would be max 150$
...if it had a headphone jack and you could get a case with a belt clip it would be the perfect running/workout phone...it would have replaced my aging ipod nano...
I. Need. Something. Like. This.
Why do people use weekend phones!?
It looks just like a mini iPhone 6s
No thanks.. Should have release this back in 2007 then I'll buy it
Leave my phone behind. Dear God no
its just new new new but nothing in this phone invited me towards it neither the size. Even for the small phone peoples this thing is not practical better call it a spy phone
It’s so cute and awesome ?? I want one! ??
maybe for children connected to the parents phone .
But why?
Hmmm...get this or get the Pocofone F1 for $25 more? Pocofone has snapdragon 845, 8GB ram, and 4000mah battery, and is currently listed on Amazon for $374.49. I know they both have different use cases but that price is not competitive at all.
Soon we'll see the Palm Plus, with a 5 inch screen and... wait a minute...
A phone for phone? P H O N E C E P T I O N
Does every company have to copy iPhone's designs?
Mobile phones were made so that we wouldn't have to carry bulky landlines with us. They evolved so that we wouldn't have to carry a camera, a music player and a plethora of other things with us. And now we're pondering the use of a small device so that we wouldn't have to carry our mobile phone with us?! I am sorry but Palm can stay dead!
So it's basically the most useless thing ever??? I mean think about it, it's a smaller more convenient phone to carry as supposed to an LTE enabled smartwatch, so it is supposed to serve the same purpose. But it's still a phone in your pocket, it's still flopping around in your pocket when you're running, so something strapped to your wrist would be a million times better as a short term phone replacement
Well at least there's no notch ..
Wow keren cuyyyy
I read palm I clicked ??
the question is ...Why?
can it be used as a primary device?
Just get an LTE smartwatch you'll probably lose that thing.
I could see something LIKE this as a great vacation phone rather than weekend phone. However, my criteria would be to have banging cameras, decent storage, and water proofing. This way no matter what I am doing, no one suspects my tiny phone but I can get amazing photos and not carry around a bulky big phone that may attract attention
More worth than te pixel 3
So, you pay over a thousand bucks for a phone and then you go on and shell out for a little 'housemaid' to help your $1000 stay and look pretty at home, while this little helper does the heavy lifting that the more expensive phone was meant to do from the start! This is just going to end up as another "status" symbol.
you know?
That looks cute ??
What for?
that phone is better than mine except the resolution
Would be cool if it implemented a more bezzeless design.
This was incredibly underwhelming
Another failing product, well done ??
We really need a small phone like that
350$ bucks ? It's dead cheap XD .. NICE ONE
this thing has no purpose... unless you use it as a primary phone. if it was cheaper, i think it would make a great phone for going to concerts bars, or anywhere pickpocketing is more of a reality and you wont be ruined if it was swiped. Get yourself a nokia 2 or a ZTE for like... Under $100
So, you have carry around a small phone instead of a big phone and you can do with it something between a smartphone and smartwatch. Why not buying a smartwatch instead? Much more convenient.
I think this would be great for kids in middle school.
I need that launcher tho ??
I'm using your last name for the rest of the year.
Has basically the same specs as my E5 Plus, but it costs more? Something like this should be cheap.
this... was a waste of everyones time.
Can it run PUBG
My phone wantsa friend! I found one! 350$ nope!
Two things are infinite, universe and human stupidity and I am not sure about former
If they can make this in to a watch, that would be awesome
2018 - where our phones are too big that we need a more 'portable' phone
Just buy iphone 4.Problem solved.
I love the design and the Launcher
But WHY ?
NO THANKS
You can get the Pocophone for this price...
So palm mode is really airplane mode... for the price your better off getting actual...real full featured low end/mid range phone for less then what this costs if you need a basic no frills weekend phone... this device is gonna last as long as those Microsoft Kin phones back in the day..which surprisingly were also offered by Verizon..for two months before it was killed off!
Better than Pixel 3's Notch
its better than my phone T_T
Great and awesome video.....??
From the front, it looks like a miniature moto E.
Shut up and take my money!
INCEPTION??
i dont know
does it run pubg
350 for a phone meant to be ignored?
More like $25 a month cuz you said it’s $10 for the plan and $15 for the phone
Back to 2009 3.3inch screen is huge.
first, multiple cameras on the phones and now multiple phones to carry around? what's next?
WTF ??...... Watch for your phone Phone for your phone What next??
I hope it will be cheaper in the future. I really like this.
$350? Funny joke Verizon...
I like it
So our phones are getting so big that companies think we want to spend a bunch of extra money on a phone baby for our phones.... Wtf is going on with phone manufacturers
When palm phone specs are better than your phone.
Why don't you just buy a compact phone from Sony
Be useful if you're out running and don't wanna have to cart your big 6.5" phone around with you
Damn its better than my galaxy tab a
I'm waiting for an android phone that is around the same size as the older iphones (4/5/se) with an oled display and current flagship specs. I haven't been impressed by the sony compacts yet, and i hope the rumored galaxy s10 lineup can offer something along those lines. I reckon the android market is ripe for a small flagship.
But can you play pubg on it
the first iPhone had a 3.5 inch screen, so it's not much off
I really want to buy that phone really bad!
Demn the mini phone has actually more power than my phone.....
Not interested in this phone but think carriers should drop the additional monthly charge for wearables.
I love how the launcher look! It's clean and refreshing (although it looks like Apple Watch OS) but I think Stock Android should be something like this in the future. Just my two cents.
Blown out apple watch ? ??
More expensive than a Pocophone F1. Hilarious.
Congratulations Palm! You've invented a reprocess!!!. For $300 you get to recharge another redundant contraption.
I actually want that phone – as a standalone. I hate how big phones have gotten and if you want to spend less than for an (old) iPhone but still want some quality, chances are your phone's screen is over 5". But actually I just need that palm phone, but without anything else.
It looks like an Obama phone
Why? Who asked for this?
Looks a little like the apple watch OS
Why would anyone use this over their normal phone?
I can't believe this device makes sense at any price.
Soooo disappointed! they really missed the point. No one needs another smart phone to use with your smartphone, we already have other wearables for that like smartwatches. A lot of people would have paid for a decent android iphone SE alternative. Huge missed opportunity, so sad.
This will be dead and forgotten about in no time... Won't even get off the ground... Absolute nonsense lol
i'd rather get an iPod touch.
absolutely ridiculous price
Ouuu I want that seriously
Nice! It's more like a upgraded pager for your main phone. I like it!
WTF is this? early 2000s?
do you have Amazon link ?????
The launcher is dope
Comeback? Or failed?
2:22 CNET is the first thing they search on YouTube before their own channel!!!!
Bruh u can buy a SD 845 at $300 as well as Kirin 970??
Or.. maybe get a dual SIM phone instead?
Not worth the money cuz u can get best phones at $200-$300.. like pocophone,Honor play
Just make normal sized phones, I want a phone not a tablet.
What a waste of money, trash!
This is the extra battery for the Samsung Extinct all over again
Better to buy Iphone SE
If Steve jobs market this it would've been the next big thing
i love it i want it
What's the point of getting a big phone when you buy another phone so you don't have to use your big phone?
So no gestures? Wasn't that the reason to get a palm?
So much for Apple insight and imagination...
Can we now have a proper phone with a small screen?
what are your thoughts on the Lite Phone?
Smartwatch phone ?
Does this phone require another phone??? ????????
I want that launcher
I want this beauty ??
I wouldn't mind having that smaller phone for convenience (alongside my larger phone). Sometimes I'm just stepping out for a while, or going to pick up the kids from school, and the most I do is text, (downloaded) music, and (downloaded) YouTube videos. Size wise I would just use Google assistant for everything...composing text, calendar, etc. I loved my Palm Pre and wish it had a Web OS skin, but oh well...you can't get everything. I hope it has a smart locator feature built in because my wife would lose that day one. LOL!
galaxy pocket neo....
Instead of making a secondary device, why don't companies focus on making a compact phone(no compromises) like the Xperia compact series or the iPhone SE.
Why not buy a pocophone instead?
Why? What's the deal?
Web OS so ahead of its time
I don't get the point of this phone.
Where can I buy this device?
This seems like a great option as a first phone for someone's kid, like the 8-14 range maybe, when kids might not be so hot on "kid friendly" designed phones, but you don't want to give them some expensive thing.
I would rather buy Nokia 3310(2018)
That’s y they got the smart watch
The new iphone 4s! Lol
Pocofone has a great competition in the same price range :3
It’s basically like this: the GPS Apple Watch goes along with the iPhone, so the Palm Phone goes along with any Android
They need to make a sliding side keyboard. A on screen keyboard is too small.
Gimme that launcher on my phone tho
Says it's a palm phone but the guy still uses 2 hands.....Lmao and also who's this phone for MY BABY! The owner now has to worry about 2 phones (charging and handling), btw 800milamp wow, that's too much. Now that i think about it , maybe this phone was for trollin or for memes.
lol ?? a phone for my phone ?? OMG ?????? I thought that’s what smart watches are for.
why i need 2 phones? why i need to leave my main phone at home? ??
Smartphone maker should mimic that amazing 1 button navigation
Anyone else read it as PLAM?
This is the future of the phone... Once the phones become too big people will again prefer the smaller ones...
Why is this phome faster than my 5T...
This 'phone' basically indicates that there's a problem with phone's today
Of course Verizon has to ruin everything
Personally I would rather buy an S7/S8 for the same price used - and just use that?
Oh, I was just thinking about a small phone for second sim card that I have and this is kind of ideal... And also a good phone for runner
You kind of fumbled your way through that review. Trying to show one thing and end up showing another...
Can I get it in India??? Fan of small formfactor phones
First buy a smartphone, then a small smartphone as a substitute phone.??????
Google of course.
I'm better off with large screens mobo
this phone is smaller than pixel 3xl notch
What if I need a phone for this phone
I just want a 5 inches flagship
I don't buying this
After buying a new iPhone, I kind of yearn for this type of "simplicity".........
I would actually want one since I can take this little device out without getting worried it might get snatched. Hopefully other companies follow suit though I doubt it.
Pointless.
Imagine playing pubg on it
I really hope to see on market sub 5" display...again
But why does it exist ?!
or you could just get an iPhone SE? haha
Why don't all the big phone companies make a 5 inch phone like the iPhone 5s and make it bezzelless? I would buy one straight away. I don't know why everyone wants a big 20 inch phone in both of their hands. Does not make sense to me
Faster than iPhone 8...??
Can't wait to do boy stuff.
No notch! Horray!!!
P L A M
Of course i love holding on my big phone. Those who dont there always smaller phones and the android watches. This gadget wont sell
whats next....echo for my echo?
10$ for a "second sim" a month? Why do carriers think it's ok to charge extra for a e-sim? I really wanna know if someone would ever pay 10$ extra a month just to be able to use this maybe once or twice a month maybe?
Maybe it can act as my backup phone or a mp3 player ????
Seriously, why do you need a phone for a phone. This phone has no customers. I'd love to have a small phone which is more convenient than my big one
Waste of money, impractical unless you need a work phone. For the average consumer, you have a phone already. Just use it. This is gonna be a flop.It's a really stupid idea.
I’ve been waiting for this for seven years!!!
Garbage phone
I think I like the idea... as a stand-alone phone.
So smartphones too large in 2018 then we back again to 2007 when we just want a phone smaller?
What a time to be alive
Just get a smart watch or Apple Watch
iPhone user: get a se
I think this is gona be iphone in android aystem
This is insane.
It's so Cuteeeeeeee
palm phone + duct tape = boom, smartwatch
Who would want such a thing? You buy a flagship phone to use it everyday. If you antes this might as well use a feature phone.
I'd buy it if it was available as a standalone phone where I can put a 2nd SIM card.
id like a "pizza for your pizza" ??
i like this phone
I though his name was dinnerbone lol
Interesting little thingy. It was simpler to have smaller phones in the past, but I don't think it makes much sense to have two phones just so you can have a weekend phone. The best weekend phone is no phone :)
how cute
28 nm soc @ 800mha battery??
It doesn't have a headphone jack?
I want this screen on another tiny smartphone - Atom.
So basically an Apple Watch
Ugly as @!
Can we get in India?
Hi , how much does it cost? thanks
looks actually cute
$350? Yeah...a companion phone for that price...no thanks
That’s not a palm phone sorry.
So Palm has released the original iPhone 11 years later? Isn't this basically what a smartwatch does?
350?! Why not get iPhone SE
You can also pick one of their colourful wrist strap to turn it to a smart watch. Jk
Tungsten for Life ????
Is this a 2018 device?
OH OHHHH THE GOOD OLD ANDROID !!!!!!!, ARE YOU KIDDING ME !!!!!, ITS A SMART PHONE WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!
This is so cute. I love this thing lol. I wish I could instead just pop my SIM card into this thing instead of $10 extra
It is run pubg game
Nope
Would've been much better if the web OS made a comeback! ?? That launcher brings back honeycomb memories. Lol ?? I like their launcher. This is a fail. SMH
Does it have a headphone jack?
Love this guy. Does great precise reviews
Don't see much application of it ..I mean ..if want a small phone in your hand ?..get a small phone
1:21 BOY STUFF
How's that different from airplane mode?
Totally pointless. I don't think people will buy it.
Hey when is this official?
I am at a certain age and I have no idea who you are.
Lol my phone still snapdragon 425 ??
I want this. I didn't know I wanted this, but I want this.
WTF...a phone for a phone ??
Well, basically it's a big wearable, right?
So it's technically just a oversized smartwatch without the wrist strap? Um.... Yeah, I'll pass.
Try not to sound so excited, Dieter
At least it doesn’t have a notch
Isn’t a smart watch a better option for that functionality? For example smart watch will always come with you and you don’t need to put it in pocket, so the probability is better.
Lagcity!
Didn't HTC try to do something like this a few years ago? A smart watch with the dual number system would make more sense.
Well I love it Better than Pixel 3 xl or I phone Xs max??
This is the cousin of the flip phone
435 is good enough!
Not first
But who was Phone Phone?
2nd lol
So now we're back in 2007?
Lol
BUT CAN YOU DO THIS?
0of
useless shit.
200k folds before it starts to degrade isn't really too much. Phone would last like a month
Am I the only one who has a problem on how bulky it looks?
Useless gimmick.
How does case will work
Please no
Just another way to part a fool and his money
The ratio is weird
Why?
Still risky!
i have the perfect slogan for this phone for samsung "The new Infinity Flex. Cool Technology, That No one asked for."
it looks like it's useless, people have Tablets and have phones, so......why would i buy this big thing? so i can have a tablet and a Phone wich a lot of people already have.....
But when it’s folded, it’s too thick
The Chinese phone is irrelevant. Wanna know why Chinese phone don't make it to the west? Cause they're garbage and westerners know it
LMAO! The hell is that thing? Samsung fell off for real. This has to be the worst phone design I've ever seen. Why is it so thick, its like a brick.
I currently use the Huawei honor note 8 6.6 inch screen, which means I'd have to downsize or always have it unfolded.... I went back to my old Samsung galaxy note 4 for a few minutes and it just felt tiny ...... As much as I love this concept I'm just not feeling it yet....keep going Samsung and I'm looking forward to various sizes the future is looking good
eewwww its so chunky...
useless and bulky
0:40 that little bluescreen
To all people immediately hating: Do you even know the NAME of this conference?--"Samsung Developer Conference". It is primarily for the "investors" and "developers". They need investor confidence, developer support and at the same time media hype to boost interest and eventually demand and sales. It is still in its prototype stages.
when folded, it reminds me of Nokia x10
the new Nokia looks nice
It looks like crap look how dark the rooms are they’re shown off in. Those are gonna be some bad colours
Apple probably can make one beautiful Foldable phone, but that phone looks ewww...
why would you want a foldable one though its cool but whats the point
Nintendo DS
Why though?
Dont see why people are doubting this. A tablet size screen that can be folded into a smartphone to fit your pocket. Pretty useful in my opinion.
I mean, do we need it? No. Is it cool? Yes. What are some uses for it? It eliminates barrier of phones being too small and too big and instead blends them together. Now you have a full on display to see things better.
I mean, do we need it? No. Is it cool? Yes. What are some uses for it? It eliminates barrier of phones being too small and too big and instead blends them together. Now you have a full on display to see things better.
who give a shit if it's a foldable phone man at least make the battery last longer they have got the technology but doe want to do it
200,000folds before it degrades? There'll be a lot of people here in the states that'll be buying a new one in three months, given how many times people check their phones in one day.
I’m switching back to Samsung now, I’m fucking sick of my iPhone X
Of course they had to come out with something as keep increasing screen size of phones will make them no portable at all. So if the folds will eventually damage the screen in future, then people will start taking their tablet and small phone separately with them again as a lot used to do before.
After blue balling us for so long, finally (and surprisingly) Samsung announces their foldable phone out of nowhere. I don't know if it'll be successful or not, but glad they didn't just give up on it all together.
This really shows that people are still in love with tablets and missing their bigger screen size.
Lots of haters in the comments. This is the first phone that’s making me want to finally upgrade from my iPhone 6s lol
But it wont stand much longer than non foldable phone...there will be a frequent replace of its part than todays battery problem!!
Fuck wallpaper presentation
Yet another distraction.
Damn. Now thats the S M A L L E S T F L E X E R O F T H E C E N T U R Y.
iFlex by Apple The first to bend ??
This is pure planned obsolescence. Display WILL wear out as clockwork, you will HAVE to buy a new one every year.
Imagine the cost to replace the glass/display
I like it !!!!÷
I WILL DROP APPLES ASS IN A HEARTBEAT FOR THIS SHIT. THIS IS THE COOLEST SHIT. SORRY APPLE. MUSK WAS RIGHT. YOU DIDNT THINK OF THIS FIRST AND WELL IM SWITCHING NOW. I NEED A FOLDABLE FONNNNNNNE
Isn’t this going to canabilize their tablets?
Pointless, just something to hype people up about!!
Samsung wasn't first, Royole wasn't first, it was Apple and the iphone 6... lol
Now i can literally flex on the haters
iPhone 6 2.0
what kind of tempered glass screen protector will there be for this? The Galaxy s8 and S9 tempered glass sucks, nothing stays on.
That lag though
The iPhone 6 is the first foldable phone....
About Royole beating Samsung to the punch for the first foldable smartphone, they didn't do a very good job if anyone's wondering. The screen suffers from major lag issues, apps take a while to open, and the phone sometimes can't tell when it's being held horizontally or vertically. It seems to be a really rushed product.
how many days does 200,000 folds equate to?
Ladies and Gentlemen, The iFlex by Apple Inc. ??
Market it as a foldable tablet instead.
The Chinese one isn't worth mentioning. Any moron out side of Asia that buys it will regret it. It'll last five minutes. cheap shit. Hope Sony brings flex phone out :)
Nice useless tech
Every phone is foldable. Most of them are foldable only once.
https://worldwidetechie.com/samsungs-foldable-smartphone/ Here is the Details about the Samsung's Infinity flex Display used in the Foldable Smartphone
#bendgate
Interesting
Let the guinea pig's try this out first before I spend any of my money on new technology like this, it needs time to be perfected.
It's a prototype
And i thought it was really that bricky.
wow
All this new technology, and noone has the courtesy to have brighter lighting fml
meh
I'm not feelin it
So..... A modern flip phone??
Anyone else thinks this phone is ugly? I mean it's cool that the technology exists but is anyone asking for a huge ugly phone?
Looks like an old Nokia phone
There is a demand for foldable phones???
wow really very techiniacist
Not officiall
Odd Flex, but ok...
Flip phones are coming back!!!! ??
That's so cool! How do you get the vids from? Like your vids so much
Samsung will takeover iphone soon
How is that case though?
99.99% of the viewer = yeah like hell I have money 00.01% of the viewer = hell yeah another collection
Best phone ever.
Were can I get the phone the WEBSITE AND THE Accessories everything that came with it What's the website please
I'm gonna buy the phone and the game vice thing. Just gotta finish saving
Can you attach the fan accessory with the case on?
Makes me bananas wher can I order this ??????????????????
Music at the starting pls
I just saw it today and must say I was like woooooow from what dimension is this?!?!?! It has a price of 1000euro but hey,it's a smartphone worth having,all those features...damn,that's just sick!!! Heheehe,by the way,great video and awesome review of a great device!!! Maybe this is the next smartphone on my list :D
How much does everything in total cost with all of the gadgets
Idk what to get asus rog or IPhone xs max
That side mounted port should be on every phone, especially if they don't have the 3.5 mm jack.
How did u get it??!?!!
A bit too small. I'm getting an error reading, 'abnormalities in charging port.' Battery is getting increasingly worse. It really dies fast once it reaches 50% mark. I had one error when it wanted to do a hard reset of my phone for some reason. It decided not to for some reason. The screen is causing me problems when playing. About 20% of the time it doesn't register my thumb input when trying to shoot the bad guys. Losing many more games than I should be. Sometimes it registers my thumb input when I'm confident I'm not touching.. Just very close. Beautiful screen. No extra crap apps come with it so that's nice. Feels ok in the hand, just a bit small. Wish it had some hard rubber on the edges to assist in holding it.Will be returning it...
How much cost that pandel
Little bit over priced!
It’s an amazing phone but the android market needs more high end games!

Very nice sir. Really nice to see you getting more and more popular!!
Where can you buy this
Geez how much does the phone only costs ? and then the whole combo package cost ?
Can i have a gaming phone???
Satisfied
can anyone link me the background song plz ?
Left out the main part dude. How much does all of that cost!!?
3 docks? Hmm...
Best phone ever. ?? How do I get one.
I love this phone a lot. My only complaint is the Snapdragon 845 chip. It will be outdated in about 3 more months with the Snapdragon 855. If this phone had the Snapdragon 855 chip inside then I would be sold 100%.
Bonkers ??
ASUS should make a macbook style lapdock. Insert the phone like a game cartridge. Tabdock as well.
I just need that suitcase. It just looks cool
Where can i buy this?
IT'S A GOOD PHONE,BUT THE PRICE IS RIDICULOUS! Yeah,in my country its RIDICULOUS!
Do you guys not have phones?
Asus beat razer
But the question is - Can you play Subway Surf, Temple Run and Minecraft on it?
asus just declared a war with himself!
Better reviews than mkbhd and inbox therapy ???? killing it bro ?? especially that outro track adding the cherry on top ??
what is the track name sir ?
Holy mother of GOD????????
Outro song ?
Rog?
Also the gamevice is probably the only accessory i'll get
Wow ??
Give me a one phone??????
#nutted
What you didn't mention is how god awful expensive the accessories are
Very very very few people would buy all this as a set.. Majority of people won't not buy it at all! What a waste of technology..
What's your user name in pubg
This is the best unboxing I've ever seen
Very good phone
Can you donate me one?
I can't believe it took them forever to relase the ROG phone Not to mention the S10 is most likely going to come at February
Gaben has left the chat
Will this phone be able to play Pokemon Go?
ROG = Ridiculously Overpriced Garbage
One of the best ever seen!!!
The only downside is that it's not running Windows 10 lol
Giveaway
But is it ip68
Damn good mobile
ah ROG phone, this is sick, guess I know which phone to get next, thanks Arun for makin this
The best unboxing..
Over kill!
Damn it how i envy you right now ??????
Nav gestures are better than software buttons
When you are high on weed and James bond is the last movie you watched.This is what you end up designing
???????
Can you please watch my video https://youtu.be/ik3929p4JsU
does this phone support wireless charging?
The best unboxing video ever seen??
Okay I remember vapour god deal, for this I will write the phantom story
The accent. ??????
this phone is sucks
in all honesty.. best phone of 2018 in my opinion. I think it was extremely well done now all we need is timely OS updates and you have the perfect phone.
does these products you can get without getting the phone
And I had thought that the ROG GT51 was too much...
What's the name of the song that he uses at the end that was awesome.....
It's a superb phone..
Where are the good games for these awesome gaming smartphones? Dig the video, but I find gaming smartphones to be ...kinda pointless if all we get is what's in the play store. Save money, buy a switch, get real games without all these crappy iAP's, coins... sprinkles and sh*t to keep us buying crap. Also having a switch, you don't feel compelled to upgrade your phone $$$ EVERY YEAR to keep up. and keep your phone as a phone.
Me : Now What is next
Thumbnail Stuff On 2:38 Thanks Me later
Can I just get this plssss!
Please do entire separate video on each product
Great video
7:05 perfect timing
Killer
Price= An arm & a leg
The product is really fierce and wonderful I want one :(

THIS PHONE WAS MADE FOR ALL OF THE OPRESSED GAMERS, GAMERS RISE UP

Please make more best android apps video!

Nice unboxing Aaron

PlzzZ give it to me.????
When is the give away?
Overclocked processor definitely show improved performance in benchmarks
How is the camera
Amazing video
better than the ipad pro and razr phone
Asus nailed the 2018
Wow, talk about commitment! The Razr phone looks like a sad little toy compared to this.
Maybe it is easier to bring along my Xbox to game with ...
Damn...imagine the same things for an iPhone... No don't
try samsung j6 on budget
that kit was insane
I think it looks awesome and the gaming controller and the case would really be the only thing I would use out of all of that.
Thanks that u made a vid about this phone...THIS IS THE BEST PHONE FOR GAMERS....My aim is to buy one of these??
And of course battery comparison mrwhosetheboss style
Camera test of it
great video
Just need a 7nm chip in this phone then the performance will be great in battery and gaming both !!
How much does it even cost???
I don't know why but it's the first time i feel like you haven't done justice to a product.
Wow how you gonna use all of that?????
I like the Asus ROG Phone.
i was hesitant to view this video because I've already watched so many rog phone videos .. But was satisfied at the end. great work arun.
I really think is to much for a phone..
You should make a new Hindi or Punjabi channel as you r An NRI
How lucky when you get all that for free
Nice movie
Really this is Ridiculous ??
What's the song at the end?
The truth about the OnePlus 6t video wanted!! ????
It is one of the best phones
i really hope theres no other "sequel" or "series" of this phone coming up in near futute. simply bcs i hope the team just keep improving and maintaining the performance whatsoever on this device I mean.. Look at those packaging!! kudos dedication!
This is one of those videos you feel suuuuuper satisfied after watching even if you're not a techie. It must have been a beautiful experience altogether for you. Now it makes me want to get my hands on one very soon!!!??
Nintendo 3ds, anyone
I wish I would get this for my birthday
Price?
Absolute beast of a phone
Okay, the phone looks lit, but how is it as an actual phone? Good reception? How is the camera, etc.?
i hope you can make camera review asus rogue phone and xiaomi latest black shark.
I have the rog phone I want the suitcase lol
I love your videos man, I actually get exited when I see you posted. Keep it up!
Would you mind tell us does it count as an emulator when using the Dock station for PUBG Mobile ? people say Pubg might lock this out ? is it true ?
a massive contender for the most underrated smartphone of 2018
IT IS MY FAV SMART PHONE can you tell me bro whats the whole price of that phone with its accessories
I guess you could say...he’s the Bob Boss of unboxings :P
Is it even modularity because honestly idk what to call it, but sure as hell Asus has taken it over the top with this baby
So how much is it? That's important info.
I just liked the video before it started... You're always gonna bring us some bomb stuff everytime you upload a video.
Music : Fine Day by Keanu Silva
Camera review plz
Wow! this is bigger than I thought
Think i must become a youtuber....
Mr who I've been subbed sceince 20,000 and ur content is 1 of the best keep up the good work
really ridiculous
I want that ??
Omg ????????????????
Great video as always
THIS THING IS NUTS
Oh God!, u are so hot. I am here just for ur thighs. I have a huge crush on u
Papasito ????????????????????????????
The very best and most informative ROG PHONE video on the web yet!! Kudos... this phone is in my top 3! 1.Samsung note 9 2.Asus Rog Phone 3.Honor note 10
PAPASITO MMMM BAREFOOT SEXY WOW ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I like it
Arrrr ohhhh geee not rog
Wait....if I buy the phone, will I get a suitcase full of accessories?
You are doing a great job! I find my self unsubscribing from most of the MURICA gadget tubers due to your sincerity and trustworthiness.
Best edit ever in unboxing
mail that phone to my house! I can like, subscribe, donate, give birth..
Superb man?
I’m loving it although I’ve bought an iPhone 8 Plus... This one I gotta have it... Peace out!
You seem to get the coolest things...
lets asking the important questions first how you got 1,200 $ :D
The phone simply wow and the accessories are amazing. But thinking whether this phone comes to India or not.
You are quite comfortable with your feet all out on your knee in the thumbnail lol ??.
ROG phone Feels Loser because of Razer Phone 2 and xiaomi Black shark melo 2 that is 10 gb ram and 845 Sd
Dude don't ever wear shorts again, or you're gonna be mrwhosthewolfman
This is a gaming phone. NO!! This is an ULTIMATE GAMING PHONE! ??????????
Lucky guy
The design is so great with a lot of personality.
I love the way the suitcase comes into the video :D
Love it, they actually gave Android users a headphone jack, not 1 but 2 charging ports, many, many features... great phone overall, I did not quite catch the storage size and the availability of an SD card for storage expansion, probably 128GB storage and a yes for the SD Card, but no sure, could you tell me? It will also be great to know the price.
I want to implore you for making this unboxing video not silent and boring at the beginning. You kept dialogue going throughout the video and kept us engage quite well. Great unboxing video, especially for how much you unboxed yet the video is still short.
I don't no ??
NAME OF THE LAST SONG PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE
Watching the video from my ROG
Yes! So ridiculous that it has horrible ping in online gaming. Doesn't give more time on gaming than the Oneplus 6. I have both rog phone and Oneplus 6. And in online gaming performance, Oneplus beats rog phone! If you want great screen on the cost of ping, then rog phone is the best. But if you want great gaming experience with low ping, then go for the Oneplus! If reviewer have these 2 phones, then try to play arena of Valor on both. Then you will see that rog has horrible wifi and lte antenna.
You have great videos. Can i have the bag of ROG?
Needs 1440p
XoXo <3
Amazing . Give me the phone please
Every time he says "rog" instead of R-O-G, I die a little inside
????
It's not ROCK phone it is R O G. P. S what's the outro song?
Man, can you, please, tell me or maybe do a video about the Google Pixel XL, and if is worth it, considering that it's almost 2019? It will be a massive help for my decision.
You kinda sound like a robot in this video (Not Trying to he rude)
when you go and Google it's price welp gonna be a while till I get this phone
Do a camera test of the Asus ROG phone vs the Razor Phone 2 vs the Xiaomi Black Shark Helo
Amazing! Plz make full review of the phn
Does the suitcase come with the phone? Or do you have to buy it separately?
Awesome and outrageous phone I really like asus phone even without other accessories
I'm buying it. I have a little bit of a Linux fetish and that 8Gb RAM and 3 USB ports is looking pretty nice.
Looks fantastic. How are the camera's
Bulge galore!
"when acer sent me a email..." but the ROG is asus right??
"Simple pleasures" of suitcase full of free stuffs!
Sick phone, but I just want that suitcase.
You explain everything i need to know
Great review Arun!
Great review Arun!
Amazing job Asus... that's really impressive
Most amazing video of all time
Insane ??
Definitely wanting to get one.
Way too much for mobile gaming
How much is that phone
Man I wish I had that
This Asus ROG phone looks more appealing then the Razer 2 #IMHO!
GIVE IT TO ME!!!I NEED ONE!!!
You get all of this for the price of a cheap iPhone??
The phone is bad ass.
Really cool and all... But WHY? Playing a game on a tiny phone screen is the equivalent to watching a movie on a laptop.. or phone... Just not meant to be with 38" monitors and 65" TV's being common.
Dang they went all out with this phone??
Those legs are RIDICULOUS
So much packaging ??
This is such an amazing mobile to get and it's also my dream ??
I'm now surprisingly interested in this phone
Why is it so ridiculous.I don't understand ,can you Explain......????
is this phone built for human being ?
Just wow
Still awesome start on the amazing video
He said acer once??
Love You Baby ??????????
?
Well that's a great unboxing
there a link on how much it is and to buy?!
But can it run crysis ?
Very cool concept with an excellent phone but just like the Red Hydrogen these overpriced accessories are almost useless..
Can't wait to play snake at 60fps on it.
He's so well spoken
Will there be a full review?
I ?? ROG Phone
love this phone but how much does it cost
Woah I really want that asus rog phone and I would be satisfied if I had it??
sexy legs
Price please
How much?
ASUS ROG vs Mate 20 X
Pretty dope
It's really a cool phone
oh man the twinview is so cool
Overkill.
Do you need 2 phones for the dual screens?
That was awesome so glad I watched this wish I had some cash to buy this and open it in front of friends just to watch them go green with envy
I want one.....with ALL of these accessories!! Great video Arun.
What's the full cost for all that stuff?
Gaming phones are a scam.
Red dead 2 ??
I'm only here to hear his accent xD ??
Great video man ?? keep up the good work ????
I have an iPhone XS so I’m good. A very simple phone, that shit looks complicated
What a phone! ?? I wanna have it.
Hey what about a speed test between pixel3,note9 &6t..
Man I must say you have a gifted voice .. literally by hearing your voice I feel like buying the phone ;) Keep up the good work ;)
I'll be very simple It's amazing but Android games don't deserve such product
Overpriced for what you get snapdragon 855 next year
Cool video man
Pretty Cool phone!
looks like the future. I want all but unfortunately couldn't afford all.
Background music is lit ????
I believed it was ridiculous just by looking at the thumbnail,but after watching the video i must say,ASUS knew the best person for the job,whostheboss killed it!
i love your voice, i have no interest in this phone but just like hearing you talk
If you smell....... What the ROG is cooking!
Could u jst tell me whr to buy it
I want this set
The quality of videos you make are getting to a whole new level, Hope that you become the best some day, in the world of reviewers. ??
Would you fuck me? I would fuck me. I would fuck me SOO hard!
I need this phone before I die!!
I literally watch all your videos and always wait till to end for that good music.
So cool
great quality but man please reduce the cuts.. it's becoming tiring and less intuitive.
Stop pronouncing the name wrong.
This Asus package is off the hook I'm getting one cuz
I'm loving the design of the smartphone
THIS WAS A BOSS VIDEO
Damn??????????
Is made out of panda?
It's a mammoth phone. Not for me. Just a little over the top.
WHAT?! This is amazing. I can't believe it. Going to Asus website ASAP. Thanks for the video. Just insane!
What the hell is ROG? It's R O G (Republic of Gamers) The way he said it....... ??
What a soft voice and music! Really peaceful video. I felt really good after watching it!
It would be great if you could make a detailed video of all the accessories with pros and cons
MAN I WANT THAT
It's not ROG IT'S R O G
I absolutely love it! That said, if I refuse to pay 1k+ for a Max there's no way on earth I'm buying it, plus all the accessories.
Looks like they went all out this time
What is that outro song at the end?
Background music name please
Love this video man!! Keep it up.
Gaming setups are nothing without good games, hopefully mobile game developers step it up a notch after this phone ????
Just "Wow" is the only word that comes out when I see or hear about this beast with beauty. Truly appreciated
when are u planning a Meetup in INDIA
THE NAME OF THE OUTRO SONG, PLS, ANYONE?
Great video as always... But I am not sure why I cringed every time you said Rog Maybe I am used to R.O.G. Other products from Asus uses R.O.G. and not Rog
Unit?
The best unboxing of this phone. Congrats!
Why dont people say the same shit about IPhone?
Give a full review
Rog phone is R.O.G dont continue the word

I am jealous because I'm not that rich.. ???? Impossible type dream for me ????
Impressive
Phone made by Aliens ??, RIDICULOUS!
Just send it to me????
Is the cooooooooooolest??
Those accessories are really simmilar to the switch
Asus has done a great job!
Hey, what happened to the OnePlus 6t review ? I've been waiting for your opinion. I love your content.
ASUS is cleanly making a commitment to gaming and user experience. I applaud them for that :-)
time has come to call mobile phone players are "GAMERS". Nice...
This actually looks good. Lol
So now you can be a hardcore casual gamer I guess?
Your voice is heart touching !!??????
But can it run flappy bird?
Bro how much the phone is
More ports than the Macbook
This video was amazing. Loved the shots and the cinematography. The phone with all of those accessories is definitely for those who truly love mobile gaming to the fullest. Keep up the excellent work.
anyone else feels weird when arun said ROG instead of R O G?
Shut up and take my money
Imagine the suitcase got stolen ????????
??
Damn, ASUS aren't messing around when they make a gaming phone.
Cool Video Mate. Keep it going...
Fantastic dude
Loved this video... Did not know ASUS was so serious about this phone!
please tell the epidemic sound name please tell anyone
Well titled video. I’m not sure who this is all for but it was cool!

The AI Robert is back love your voice bro ???? Love from India ?
Dam, TBH. I am salty I didn't wait for this. I was going to wait for it, then the Razer Phone 2 beat them to release, and I pulled the trigger. Can't believe the phone is only 100 bucks more.
This phone has everything I need But I don't have anything to buy it
I guess it's the best assus rog phone unboxing on YouTube.
This phone is unbelievable. It's Terminator 2 look is for me a five star. I don't need air light device. I like sturdiness and durability.
Best ever gaming phone
Guessing 3000 $ for all of that
This is redicules in a VERY GOOD WAY
Wow, this looks like a gamer's dream! Great job Asus. And great review Mrwhosetheboss. So satisfying :)
Late.
Hey Arun. Nice video. Can you please do a camera test between ASUS ROG PHONE , BLACK SHARK 2 AND RAZER PHONE 2
Lol, samsung dock got just so dead by ASUS! Kudos to ASUS!
Its R. O. G not rog????
But Can it run Crysis 3...?
Nice video looking foword to you future video
I should be building a gaming pc, so why on Earth am I watching this super tempting gaming phone review?
I'm an iPhone user and this and Oppo Find X are the only phones that would make me consider switching to Android.
and that's why i love Asus
it is amazing
I don't think this time ur video has done justice to the Asus gadgets
Gymshark once again :o
release date????
When is apple coming out with their gaming phone? ??
I would rather buy a PS4
Oh my god very nice
Well to game on a tiny screen this games that suck ass id rather buy me a PS4 for way less
Wow
Good video.... 18:9 please
Didn't expected a video today??but was happy to see that,that Asus phone is so ridiculous?? those accessories are little confusing which one to use??too many of em,any way that's a Beast??.And @mrwhosetheboss the last two videos had an amazing and variety starting/intro of U??
Damn!
Really it's incredible for such a gaming phone
Free fire wallpaper lol??
Ending song please,
How much is this total?

Phone for gamers rocking a 10nm Snapdragon 845 which can’t even manage to beat last years A11 chip by Apple OMEGALUL
this is better than my gaming pc
How have you got the nicest voice in the world
You should wear more shorts so we could see your sexy legs
Amazing stuff by Asus

Press O to start
super satisifying!!!
????? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? 3310 ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ???? ??? ????? ???? ??????.....?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ???? ??? ???? ??
Finally a phone that looks different than the 100 other phones which launched this year.
What is the background music?
This is just ?????????? and is better than any other Gaming smartphones out there!
1:26 im so tilted of that dirty screen lol. Anyway good video my dude.
Ur voice bro ??
By hearing that sigh, pretty much sure that you are not going to use that phone. Give to me, I will treat her as my girlfriend.
I like your style.
Anyone heard in the UK that Xiaomi are retailing the MiA2 and Mi8 Lite for £1?!?! Like if you want one of them for such a low price
That phone is amazing
I see u trying some ASMR by krincling the papers like that ... I SEE THAT MR WHOSE YOUR BOOUSS
I need this but don't know why
This is perfect for my temple run.
It's R-O-G not rog
meanwhile iphone barely has 1 port :D
Loved the start..!!??try doing it more often ????
Imagine casually getting emails from huge companies asking to send you their latest phones
I think I'm okay with the honor play ????
I need a new phone to play pubg 'cause it lags so much on my redmi 3s prime but this ROG phone is overkill but I'll take it anyways. And the video was very satisfying as always. Quick and informative no mumbo jumbo. ??
i want all of that
Brooo i am very big fan of you ????????????????????????
Sexy to a whole new level. U and the phone alike.
This seems slightly overkill, ill just go for ASUS Zenfone 5z, which no popular tech youtuber has review ????
This phone is overkill
Can we have an camera Samples... Because I am planning to but this phone Thanks
How much does it cost?
Note..it's a 30 watt charger
Rog phone is something I don't think is necessary the note 9 is way better in my opinion as it has the same 845 processor. I understand the cooling and controls but I don't think gaming phones as extreme as the rog phone is necessary. The razer phone 2 does it just right by not going too extreme.
Awesome unboxing ????
Please subcribe his channel its just awesome??????
Lol what's with the shorts in the thumbnail it looks like you wore your pajamas and shot that photo before going to sleep ??
lamo i got the razer phone add
Not to mention it has 0.1response rate
Give ..me.plzzz???? ??????
Good for gaming
uk release date and who is doing contracts?
This phone is way better than that Samsung foldable phone imo. I’m an Apple user/fanboy/sheep and this phone looks amazing.
Pretty sure its pronounced R-O-G not rawg, but good video.
I think that this is what the razer phone shouldve been, instead of just a flat squared black chunk with a usb c port
By a huge margin, the best presentation of a phone. Would be amazing if every buyer would recieve that.

True Dope Tech??
Squeeze? I've seen that before.
Hi sir
Wow amazing Rog phone n assoeries wow amazing I wish I have all of it
This phone is dope I just love asus. ?? damnn
PRICE ??
Ridiculoussssssssss ????????????
Does pubg mobile sponsor you Cause u always use pubg mobile to check or display gaming footage
Too bad the Snapdragon 855 comes out in a few months.... this phone is already pretty much outdated...
Overall, best unboxing on ROG phone and its accessories, didn't even know that the peripherals are inside a suitcase ON WHEELS. How I wish to get that. OwO
Still anyone who is complaining about companies still need to pay more attantion to gaming phone..??
Its a 30 watt charger, but still a great video keep it up
Dream phone but I can't afford it
Seeing them supporting a phone like this is what will make people want this phone tho. Literally the polar opposite of the RED phone.
You can't be this hot. Damn bro
This is real innovation.
Are the ancessories free or you had bought them separetly?
Ok you pro gamers this is the phone for you
Super beast gamming phone.
This is very weird, im getting Austin Evans's ultimate setup kinda thing in this video..everything is so over the top :D
Can play GTA 5 with it!?
I want that phone!
As overkill as it is, it's still cheaper than the note 9 or iPhone Xs Edit: Of course the price will be much higher if you plan on getting any of the accessories
Never wanted a suitcase more. Now THAT is a beautiful suitcase with AWESOME accecories????
I love it!! I wishSamsung did this with their note 9 or the upcoming note 10, it would be insane having so many gadgets.
Best video of Phone unboxing ??
Love the video
Do you play free fire?
Completely satisfying video...??
rubbish
"Looks like you have to have 2 of them" but they are 2 ??????
Mate 20 X
wow that's a lot. massive unboxing. more power sir
Him vs zack from jerry rig should compete for the next google assistant voice!
... When Asus goes nuts... ??
plz help me...note 9 or Asus ROG...? plz ????
We are getting trash like this and wondering why Diablo Immortal exists.
Too bad the mobile game industry is still a joke. For now I'm only using my game pc and PlayStation 4
Guess who all are watching this Ya those who can't afford it ...
Nice mobile
2.9 GHz? Holy shit it still amazes me how fast technology moves I think the i5 8300h in my nitro 5 laptop is only 2.3 GHz base clock! Crazy world we are living in.
Bro you are awesome
i would love to have that luggage. even if its still empty i could use that for my laptop and shirts
Wow fuck this guy
The music you used in this video is amazing!
wow
Huawei p20 and mate 20 Pro are better
Crazy! Asus gone mad with this! Wow!
Dude, you need to up your thumbnail game.
Behemoth of a package... THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
I will buy that phone for sure.... If they give that suitcase filled with those modules ??
Bro plz reply what is ur background music plz bro and happy Diwali
Asus is just not building a gaming phone, it's creating a gaming ecosystem. This is why it stands out in the gaming phone segment.
Superb yrr
HOLY SHIZZZZ <3 JUST LOOKING AT IT MAKES YOU ORGASM. MAKES ME WANT TO BUY ONE RT
Asus nailed it
I shouldn't have watched this, now I'm jealous.
Yeah you can chuck loads of crappy addons with the phone but let's not forget the main purpose of the video is to promote the ROG phone which is a bag of shit and looks ugly as hell.....
Banned for pubg... that's practically cheating
I'm sorry but I still cannot understand who games THAT intensely on their phones that they would rather not have a good camera or an actual good looking software but have this "bonkers" of a phone! I never understood who gaming phones are for... not ONE person I've seen games this intensely on their phone to justify the 200+ weight that comes with it! Or the extreme price tag.
Awesome
I'm not a gamer, and at first I thought this was ridiculous ... but it looks amazing and I do want it. I don't know what use I would give it though
Can it fold tho?
??on?? #asusROG #arun . best unboxing ever. ??
Completely nailed it
Why i am watching these????
THAT PANT ??
This is insane
Why doesnt google hire your voice? I would have used bixby if it had your voice :)
Background Sound....?? Source??
Tv name plz
How much is it?
Arun please! It is pronounced as Asus R-O-G phone. (I paused the video to type this comment so if you get to know about it later in the video then sorry)
A serious gaming phone ever
Ill be choosing the mate 20x. Bigger screen(7.2inch) bigger battery(5,000Mah) and a faster K980. And its cheaper with camera specs of mate 20 pro.:)
I just love gaming on phone but don't wanna go with rog phone but like the mate 20 pro bec camera is my main concern... Hope to see mate 20 pro gaming performance
The most satisifiying thing i have ever seen
Wow
Please one give me
I like Asus brand
Nice, no one needs tht many docks tho lol
This is whole new level
Arun please come to India for collaboration.......
This gamer focused design that I hate on laptops looks great on a phone. Asus definitely made the best gaming phone. I wish Sony would enter the game and make an Xperia Playsation Pro. Only the fact that it plays PS and Vita games would put all the other gaming phones to shame. Except... If Valve makes a Steam Phone that plays PC games. Now that would be incredible
What a hell of a gears.
This video deserved likes. Asus ROG phone is so dope ??. Thank you sir for the video. Fall in love with asus.
ROG phone vs Mate 20X speed test ?
Such a confusing device . ROG did not dine its product well ...... How many gamers will be willing to play on a small screen when you can just plug it on the big screen ?? ... Mobile ... Defeats the purpose
Apple cant do that????
TBH I doubt anybody would buy all those accessories. It's like all of them are made for Asian gamers.
The accessories were epic! Asus did a great job
How you guys get the free phone
Bro your voice is so damn amazing Really it's cool ??
much better than mate20
This is insane ??
Do you get to keep that stuff ? Even the suit case was pretty freaking cool I want one
But they forgot a VR headset
That looks absolutely awesome, it’s a gamers dream, Not something I’d go for unless I had lots of money to waste, Asus make great gaming stuff
Best Unboxing ever
Outro song?
How much does it cost in total ????????
ROG> Razer Phone 2
You are my hero
ABSOLUTE UNIT
Phone & video both are great.
that's the wildest ROG Phone review I ever seen. Carry on Arun You're the best
Can I run temple run on it???????
I'm in love with it lol I love to see a company put this kind of effort forward.
This is the only phone which I liked a lot by its looks ! Beastly and Unique phone.. If the front display was more attractive and more in resolution I would have thought of purchasing it !
Can’t handle this . Who needs this . People are not mad to spend so much after just gaming ! Are they earning more than bill gates or Jeff bezoz by gaming
Don't see the point of a gaming phone.. Most games are meh.. Unless they start dropping AAA titles then.... Well... ??
Had to slam the box down. Ahh the life of a Big popular youtuber.. If the product breaks..... Oh well there is more where that comes from.
Cool
Damn those speakers are quite juicy
50 iPhone sheep disliked this video. It shows how blah their rehashed phone is.
Keep on growing
This is a lot....????
#BossStyle
#LikeaBoss
I hope the next rog phone still keeping the same look as the 1st one..so we need to buy and upgrade the phone only..and all the accessories still can be used on the new device..instead of upgrade the entire set..this can be promising mobile gaming rig..
Just imagine my OnePlus 6 runs pretty cool enough without extra cooling ??
Asus????????
Yeah his voice is still chill.. ?????
Jab money ho to sab ridiculous hi lagta hai
A wonderful package!
Why can't gaming phones look normal? This looks like it came out of aliens ass. It looks like it's meant for a 12 year old's cool factor.
Plz give package link
R. O. G. Not ROG
How much did it cost? With all accessories.
Id buy it
so jealous. such a phenomenal unboxing
Just buy console or PC tho if u gonna that much money on this stuff
Just over the top stuff
While im here watching random new flagship/gaming phone using my samsung j1 :'c Ps: i have a job and im pretty much into new phones but my salary was not enough to buy a new one. Ps:yes im saving money but that was for the mother of my incoming child :) Pss:up this maybe someone will give me even a rusted old phone but can run pubg lol ??
Thanks for the detailed review of ROG full package!
wish i had money to get one
But you did cushion the fall of the smaller box with that mattress ??
Your videos are addictive #mrwhosetheboss
I bought this phone not because I wanted to play games on it. I bought it because of all the cool features it has and felt it is the most advanced smartphone on the market.
Makes sense!
Superb
#WOW
Niche or not gamer phones seems to have their share in market as even Samsung rumoured to make one.i think we'll be seeing more of them. And the fact that phone games make ridiculous profits all of game companies want a piece of it. Future gaming - phone gaming
Asus making great forgetting background
Amazing vedio bro....
i actually can how i would use every accesory shown but it just makes no sense to pay for it , probably cost around 5000 usd for everything
Pls compare rog phone vs razer phone 2 vs black shark helo??
The best phone I have ever seen in my life.m with all type of accessories. It's a beast. I would really luv to buy this phone. I
ROG Gaming review pannuga
Grateful Unboxing bro.
I'm speechless.
That's a gaming phone ??
How an iPad Pro 12.9 inchs cant even fits a headphone jack while Asus ROG Phone has 2! FREAKING TWO HEADPHONE JACK!
just WOW!
I will buy this after 29 years when my budget matches its price.
Am i the only one not skipping the outro music , it's so awesome
Let me know ur background music... Wow what a unboxing yaaaa it's cooler than air-conditioning
I jealous. Seriously... Those accessories are amazing..
Love your videos & your outro
The question is How much?
I have the phone it's awesome I want to get a couple of the accessories I just can't afford it.
Did he really sigh at the end of the video
Hi, i m a small blogger and I write about tech and gadgets. Can I embed ur video with my review of Asus Rog phone? My contacts: manasmdg3@gmail.com admin@nextdeskguy.com
To be honest nothing on the whole god damn appstore is worth to be played on this. No AAA quality exclusive titles, every thing is either a shitty clone or a PC port and riddled with stupid ass microtransactions. PUBG Mobile? more like Asian Cheating Grounds Mobile....
3ds+switch+samsung dex
Asus is great as brand, but i don't still understand these gaming phones.. Just nah
Still couldn't beat Mate 20 pro which is not even a gaming phone (Antutu)
The only thing I hate about these videos is the factthat he is almost kissing a microphone when he talks and adds so much base to his voice and when there is a room talk with microphone right on your ears its so unnatural...
Well i would say its just AWESOME
........And then we have iPhone Xs Max with out a fast charger or lightning to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter....... The world we live is really wierd!!!!!??
I've always liked Asus phones. This is a whole new level though.
After a long time the massive unboxing on Boss style
Arun you are as cool as the ROG phone is
I have never seen gaming phones as more than a marketing joke but this video makes me think otherwise. Asus's efforts are evident from all the different accessories they have prepared for different scenarios. I personally wouldnt ever have thought to ever consider using a non samsung apple lg phone but this phone has caught my interest. Awesome video from start to finish.
I got my rog phone november 7th and it's totally awesome! best phone I've ever had.
Gimmick trash, and you unbox fuckboys eat it up.
Dude it's "R.O.G" not rog
is this an out of season april fools joke? who needs a gaming phone like this? what games require specs anywhere near this? if you say emulators then why are you not supporting those companies and buying their systems instead of overpaying for a phone?
That really is a beast!!
Awesome!
bro please give me the phone..i wanted to review it bro plsss
Too much dop Tech bro
I like the idea of using it as a computer on a big screen like the Samsung Dex. I really think that's where the industry should move too.
who wears a hoodie over a boxer at home???
i thought you almost dropped it at the beginning
hey buddy howu dooin???????
what's that outro music?
Gaming on phones doesn't exist. Just remember the applause last time Blizzard introduced mobile game. 95% are cash grabs.
Awesome video man. I saw other videos on the rouge phone. It's definitely a sick piece of tech. I liked the accessories you showed off as well. It shows that Asus really took the time to make a solid device not just for gamers but other techies as well.
For that price you can get a budget phone, laptop, and a gaming pc!
the unbox therapy done right??
If phones can start playing dota2, then I will buy a gaming phone, untill then camera, screen and design are what I'm looking for.
Dont tell me this phone comes with all this accessories ?
Awesome
What are some good mobile games that actually make it worth it to buy a device like this? Just curious
Twinview is awesome! I love this phone! #RepublicofGamers
?? ???????, ?????? ! ????????
Yeah, it's the rock phone. CAUSE IT'S ROCKS.
Soundtrack at the end of the video please?
It's Really Ridiculous...????????????
you need to stop doing that pouting shit with ur lips on thumbnail u bencho
Man but that amount of stuff is overkill like what the....
Damn. Why it looks like the phone and all the accessories are at least $3000.... It looks awesome but not at this price points... Not for mobile gaming. I can buy a kick-ass laptop for that or better yet, build a banging pc and a console.
Ridiculous commenting here
Cool!
7:11 don't forget the 3.5 Jack
I love this bit 7:04
You shouldnt say roge . Pronounce the letters like ROG
If I buy rog phone ...will I get the second box as well with the phone??
Osm arun
lucky you... or do you have to...do you???
@7:04 ..??
Man did you pay for all those items ???
I like the first dock but it misses VGA and card reader....... Do you know any cheap USB C desktop mobile dock with RJ45, card reader, VGA, HDMI, Two or more standard USB 3.0 and one USB C charging port? If so please share the link.
This is great looking phone, and it may be quite Expensive as like IPhone.
That moment when this guy makes a waayyyy better unboxing video than unbox therapy has made for the last couple months if not even longer
Can you give me plz
Rog ??
hello boss giveaway me one this phone to play the game PUBG
Can we buy the phone case separately?
Can you do the Razer Phone 2 later?
Wow, this was epic, well done. I feel this hasn't been covered enough by reviewers
this is so extra
And you didn't say anything about the battery size
In need to know where to get both the suitcase and phone pls
Watching in my Rog phone.??
The thumbnail tho??
I want this just to say I have it
Bang! I'm saying about the video and content presented in a soothing way. Would you kindly tell the price of that phone including the accessories (the suitcase)... Waiting for your answer
How much is this Asus phone? Are all these accessories easily available.
It's a beast of a phone specs wise, I think the only drawback could be the camera.
Now there are two ways to play pubg free on pc: one is you use the Rog phone to connect to the pc while the second is to use MSI app center to connect to an msi pc
I wish Rog phone has AI assistant with Arun's voice
Never thought that ASUS would give this much of importance for phone accessories. Great video to understand what is going around the mobile tech world.
Cool accessories, hope Samsung does something like this to make their phones more 'gaming' with accessories like this in the future... especially since they're trying to push it with the debut of the Note9 and Fortnite.
I got the new Razer for my son who's a big gamer and has the Razer laptop. We returned the phone. Unacceptably hot when the cpu and fps is cranked up. Definitely getting him this. This is a real gamers phone. Will definitely get him the dock with the additional screen too. This will destroy Razer sales. It's a real winner! ??????
wtf
1300$
-No notch -Has a headphone jack
In simple words. Awesome ??????
Mrwhosetheboss on tv 0:06 ??
Lew's gonna love that. Hah!
Great vid mate
That john wick wallpaper please
Ah mate, fancy just sending me that stuff? It's everything I've ever wanted in a phone!
Wow! It's so amazing phone.. I love it....
Your thumbnails are RIDICULOUS fucking annoying
Am I the only one around here who thinks gaming on a touchscreen is horrible for most genres of games? I just want physical controls... 90hz+ is nice to have but please get your priorities straight. Make great games and smooth controls first.
Just a question when you buy the rog phone thus those other things go with it for free?
Bro send me down the rog to janipur, jammu ,jammu and kashmir ,india plz
That's loud
Please do a battery comparison.
Quality content from the boss as usual. ????
Can't afford them
Does rog support 5g and when will it launch in India . I want it to be future proof for 5g network . PLEASE TELL
There is no such a fuckin gaming phone. Its only a gimmick . Gaming pc is still the way to go.
Damn im poor
they forgot to supply a VR headset in the luggage
Bruh, i dont wanna be awkward but can you at least get some pants
Camera comparison? Rog vs black shark vs razer?
This phone is great but what is the cost
Asus has really worked a lot.
Wow talk about an early Christmas present!
Are You Rich Or Are You Kidding me ????????
The real question is “why is he using a VSS???” ???????? @ 5:54 and 6:30
Should have given a VR headset along.
This is some out of the world, non essential, overkill product and i LOVE it. Sorry Razer and Xiaomi but this is the best gaming phone in the market right now.
Iteqd buy a $5000 pc or a gaming laptop saving a lot of money
The black is everywhere,there is awesome man ??????
This video is super satisfying!
Price ? 200k ??
Do the batery test with and without the twinthing
Niche... are you serious!.... OK yes it is a bit niches... but If I had the cash... nothing else would get a look in... Always been an Asus fan, now a ROG fan, and this has got to be the best phone and accessory package EVER.
Another animal....
Nice...& cool...
I can hardly afford the ROG phone and the boss gets everything for free, I presume. Lol. Costs 1.6K SGD in Singapore..... I can get a decent laptop for that money.
AWWWWESOME ?? OPENING THE SUITCASE. ALWAYS LIKED YOUR VIDEO BEFORE WATCHING...?????? ASUS ROG SMARTPHONE ??
They went overboard is just an understatement of the century ??????????????????
THIS IS A NEW KIND OF VIDEO...LIKE....THE WAY U STARTED
So, ASUS was able to put 2 USB ports and a headphone jack in the phone. Now im just feeling cheated by other companies. ??
How much for all the stuff ?
Thumbnail was far more ridiculous!
Dream phone..
Asus went all in.
No it is not... Still watching...
I wish I could like this video a thousand times
Asus brings phones to next level.
How was the camera on asus rog phone
most redicleous phone
I think this is only for gamer
This is game of thrones.. From season 1 to season 9..??????
Seeing your leg hair isn't something I thought I would want to see
Excellent video, Arun! So many accessories! Really digging the design of the phone!
??????
Can someone tell me how many kidneys i need for this whole bundle
Mahn, this was one of the best video. RoG phone, does not have Corning Gorilla Glass 6, while it has a 30W charger.
I enjoyed the video. sooooo where do I get one? ..........Winner chicken dinner!
On the Top Screen, i will Watch Mia khalifa getting pounded. On the bottom screen,i will watch how to stop Masterb***
Best gaming phone
That photo tho hairy af have some hygiene for god sakes
Jesus Christ that's a massive overkill of a product. Why would anyone buy that?
Last one
Whoa...! the phone is...priced to it's worth...!
Unboxing in shorts BOSSSTYLE
it’s kinda overkill in my opinion lol just buy a ps4 or switch
Mrwhosetheboss, You need to change your ending soundtrack asap, its just... terrible. I mean that "la lalalala, e e a a a a...". Its extremely annoying.
Price ???
can you do a giveaway of it
Scrolling through the comments, I DID see you offered a slightly wordier Opinion. You should have been equally succinct within your review. Many of the commenters may miss your latter comments. JaneLee ^_^ ???? 11/9/18 7:53 AM
Aaron you forgot the little fan that comes with it!
If only I had money...
looks cool!
Arun is the best PUBG player
But can it run Minecraft?
Wow super box..
What mobile game it can't handle???
Real question though, why would anyone buy this when they can get a really good gaming PC for the same price?

Best Subiltitles' Image..
That thumbnail made me lose No Nut November (no homo tho)
These are all the future of a gaming smartphone!!! Wow!
My most fave mrwhosetheboss intro. ??
I can feel that my kidneu cant afford that.
Why did Asus send their Asus Rog phone in a suitcase that's actually hilarious????????????
We've seen the 845 being put into the first laptops and since it is strong enough for that, smartphones are entering the field of portable computer. Rog is treating its phone as if it can be something like the Nintendo switch. I actually believe that smartphones have a chance of replacing consoles, and if none of the console companies get aboard the ship now they might not be able to get into the mobile gaming market. Remember how the switch also overclocks as soon as you hit the dock? Well, the rog phone gives me an impression it is working towards being a switch, but from the smartphone side rather than the console side. The docks etc. Are a little overkill now, sure, but imagine what the future might hold.
I adore these live wallpapers, I wish more phones would have wallpapers like this
That lot would probably costs hundreds, if not a thousands!! ???? Great! But probably well out of the reach of average gamers, price wise
That thumbnail is so lit
That was some serious unboxing I've seen till date ,,,
Please give link for that blue phone wallpaper at start with the guy shooting
oh i love the phone not the price..??
Too much investment for a single gaming device.
Mobile gaming: Asus>rest. Enough said.
Hearing you say "absolute unit" in that silky smooth voice is something I didn't know I wanted
So nobody is going to comment about how this man is saying ROG?
That was badass!
I can't afford that coz im poor :(
I liked just for those hairy legs???????? No homo guys...??
Nothing better than coming home from Sixth Form and watching your videos ??
You're the hardest working YouTuber, greatly appreciate your amazing work, thanks
The best gaming phone on earth
You > UboxTherapy
Nice toes
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooobrother!
now you can Diablo immortal like a switch!
Now dis is a beast
Dam I wish I could afford that phone because I love gaming but I don't have the money
That's so insane. A gaming phone plus all the goodies. Does buying the phone means you get all the accessories for free? JK! I knowwww, imagine how much quid I need to spend in order to own the entire set. Just WOW!
What happened to the 18:9 Aspect ratio videos? Why did you shift to 16:9?
best smartphone unboxing till date that i have seen
uwu
This is the perfect gaming smartphone, too many accesories that you must use.
Whoa. I want this phone!!????????
Holy moly
You're smashing it bro, that phone is on my radar.
I wish i had this??
link of that sweetshirts plz ?
But can it run Honkai Impact 3 at max settings on a 4K TV and is the control/display latency good enough that you can perfectly time dodges in that game.
Whats the title of your background dance atbthe end of your vlog?
Now thats too cool..but im wondering how much is it?xD
Asus really loves you mrwhosetheboss ??
If I gamed I'd rather her than the Razor 2. The options available!
4:51 the speaker was soo loud and clear that I thought you were actually speaking ontop of the speaker audio lol
Hey Hey Hey ! Working out huh? Gymshark!
Woao
Awesome just love this
Do youtubers get all this stuff for free ??
A headphone jack. Fuck yeah :p
Hi
How many insane guys r really buying that phone??? Xiiii
007 James Bond vibe here. I'm absolutely geeking out about this over-the-top product presentation and accoutrements. I want it only because it's a suite of devices that look bada^^. More than functional applications, it is a work of art. I'd display the whole line, just for the cool factor.
Hi early squad
Holy shit that thing looks beatiful
Amazing video as usual. Keep it up, Arun.
Take my kidney....
Build Quality of Asus?? Just like your Videos ?? Give me some likes??
Ridiculous for sure
Great
Something i would wish for this Christmas
A magnificent masterpiece!

Real gamers don't play on phones
Holy ficking shit!!!
NOFITICATION SKUAD WHER YU AT!?
1.design of phone 2.squeeze to enter X-mode 3.secondary screen ??????????????????????????
That is one kick-ass phone I mean I am into tech and have been since 87, but this is simply wild. How does the rest of the phone stack up to the others like camera or battery and so on?
Notification squad!!
jus wow!
Can us customers find that amazing suitcase to buy too?
Pubg lovers hit like ??
Android combined with the power of mobile GPUs, increase Ram, and cost of phones these days. This is what I imagine phones should be or taking us IMO. Add Windows support with mouse and keyboard. Sprinkle a PSN or Xbox Network like Gaming Experience. And go yourself the future.
GIVEAWAY THAT PLEASE??????????
ROG??nice review. Not just one box it two on this week??i truly happy to see ROG. Mrwhosetheboss got all the accessories for the phone. Btw keep it up Mrwhosetheboss??i truly love your video??
I love it...not ridiculous at all....some of us don't fancy all those camera comparisons and would rather have a gaming phone!!!! ACtually I haven't watched smartphone comparisons for quite a while. It always comes back to the camera and frankly I don't care about daytime, night time shots, noise(whatever the hell that may be)....but this is different. And a chunky phone which you can really hold.
Thats suitcase though! And nothing to about the four speaker combination power ( dope). I think all the gaming phone manufacturing company should follow this and include this amount of accessory for their gaming lineup smartphones. This turn turn a mobile gaming experience into more fun. Loved the video. I wish mkbhd also have made this kind of video ??
how much is this phone anyways?
Did you say ACER at 0:24 ??
Please give us a separate full review of the phone
Insane????
Better than IPhone XR
I see my next phone ??
I love the ROCK phone...
Best unboxing ever
ROG Phone...????????
Damn that's some pure raw power ????

That's my sort of thing....great unboxing

The hardware is soooo good , but the game gallery is so poor on mobile phones , so is a pass for me .
Best YouTube Channel Yet..????

First! I dunno what to say cuz I'm so early... Umm... I'm the "FIRSTER" guys! I had that role for the first time! I know there's no prize but... It's an achievement lol #NotificationSquad
Hey ...
What the fuck is with the rainbow led lighting? Its on everything... why? Has everyone lost their minds? Its ugly as fuck. Its garish... to the level of being rediculous.
Looks like Ian from Alvin and the chipmunks and the guy dressed as a chicken from toy story
So how is the build still lasting? Did the wobble ever get corrected?
will the ram series you used here but 2133 be able to go with a ryzen 7 2700x ?
I watched a couple of your earlier first start-up and Windows 10 install videos. At no time did I hear you talk about setting the date and time. I noticed that in two cases the time was set correctly for you, but Windows always defaults to Pacific Time Zone. Who knows where a board fabricated in Malaysia would be set.
Paul, I know you know there is no such thing as high end when talking PC parts. only mass produced Chinese over priced shit. especially with nvidia. the whole price to performance thing is a serious sham. by the time we get to 2020.... well... you get it. no pc case I have seen is worth more than 80 bucks. I've seen a lot of cases. some designs are better and cooler than others, but quality? non existant! utter garbage. brittle plastic, cheap glass, super thin and weak sheet metal with zero integrity. over priced doo doo.
Cooler Master at it again. ** that garbage case.
Eeeakh, what the case? Save yourself from hassle and get Obsidian or DIY Vanguard ??
1:31 the label says Ryzen 7 but it's Ryzen 5
I feel like this is amateur build from a guy that knows his shit... Not impressed at all. You're better than this Paul...
yes but can this play Diablo Immortal? ;)
What is that mat he is using in his top down shots?
Isn’t intel better for gaming?
just buy the fractal design r6...and thank me later
That case....straight basura!
Fucking ads
I watched that fucking video.
I looks like a bad airflow case
Can you provide evidence that the Ripjaw V actually runs at 3200Mhz with the R5 2600x and the MSI B450 Tomahawk or B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC? I just couldn't find reliable information on the compatibility with Ryzen 2x00... (And the list that MSI gives is too buggy and confusing??)
The 1000 dollar version of this build which cuts on the RGB cooler . etc wouldn't be the same. The RGB adds roughly a 30-40% FPS boost....
1:27 Why is there a ryzen 7 sticker when its a ryzen 5?
Mine is better but.. This one is great
This is the same exact build I just made minus the mobo and case. It's beastly
It’s no nut november, please you’re making it hard for me :(
1st build -- Swing and a miss 2nd build -- Two Strikes First build. 1. your CPU cooler should never cost more than your MOBO. In the first build either spend the money on a better MOBO -- or stick with stock if your truly trying to save money. With that board no amount of cooling will increase performance over the stock cooler. The reason is the OC is VRM limited on that board, not thermal limited from the cooler. 2. 1070ti -- can be had for same price or less, and offers better performance. I am as much a fan of AMD as anyone, but with the 10 series so deeply discounted right now Vega has no place in the market at $400+ 3. 480gb is super low capacity for 2018 for an entire system. But even assuming you absolutely want to get that low, your better off with 860 EVO -- it is $1 more, but significantly better performance. But getting the $145 dollars 1tb 860 evo would be more practical. Or get a 240gb SSD and a 1tb HDD for about $85 combined. $7 dollars more, but with a practical storage capacity while maintaining an SSD boot drive with room for 2 favorite games. 4. The case as everyone said is awful. The h500 case is the absolute best performance budget case on the market, and no one building a budget PC should even consider anything else, you got that right in your second build. Second build. 1. Get the 2600x it comes with a better cooler, and is vastly superior in performance. The money you save buying it and sticking with the stock cooler is already made up by not getting an aftermarket cooler. Too loud for you? You can under clock the processor to the same performance level of the 2600 and it will be whisper silent, even more so than the aftermarket cooler on a 2600. 2. No on the 240gb SSD -- Unless your spending $37 WD 1tb HDD to go with it. 240 is just too low. Even an old PS4 comes with a 500gb capacity, and they don't sell them with less than 1tb these days. 3. once again 1070ti better value until the stock runs out. 4. Never cheap out on the PSU -- and with the 2600x you should be getting the 650GQ from the last build anyway. It is cheap, but not rock bottom level. Buying a bronze rated PSU in 2018 is crazy. ----------- I get you chose the vega 56 because budget monitors don't have gsync. But Freesync 1 on budget monitors is barely better than v-sync and in some situations worse. Free sync 2 is almost as good as g-sync but usually is on newer models that cost more, and is outside the budget of the budget gamer. Even then... 8% GPU performance hit, for free sync... Ill take 8% better performance.
How is that red dragon vega card not a knockoff of MSI ?
wth i can buy a rx 580 or gtx 1060 with that case
hi Pauls hardware, I am using an old dell xps 13 and i really want to stream Fortnite and when playing i get like 30> fps. and i was wondering if i could have any of your old pc builds of the month. Kind regards Ethan/ Dragongmaing101
is the g skill ripjaw v for msi boards only or any brand will do?
I see what happened there 0:41
A paul's hardware a day keeps the depresso away :D
the idea of this design is nice but it need a couple of years to be perfect.
SL600M is overpriced trash... horrible cooling, cheap materials, not great to build in. There are MUCH better options out there.
1:27 why is there a ryzen 7 sticker?
that case would be nice if it was not built like a piece of shit
when you have a gamming laptop now but you still mess around with it like it is a desk top. ie delided and liquid metal and over hauling the cooling solution and yes it needs it it is a 7700k
Can you do a black and white ,warter cooled gamming pc between $1500, I will love that.
The foldable dust filter is indeed convenient. If it is full of dust, you just fold it, so the dust does not fly around your room on the way to your sink.
For 1250 you could of had a build with a 1070ti and a 2700x
that case is complete crap
Hi Paul just curious if all of this equipment would be compatible with the ryzen 7 2600x?
Waiting for that i7 8700k $750-1200 build..
Aorus b450m build pls pls pls pls
Great video I'm getting everything for my pc tomorrow on the 10th!!!!
That case is janky, return it; it’s ugly.
Releasing a build like this in November ?
if you want to save $40-50 by going with the 240L insted of the 240r
Paul Im glad to see you used the brace in the back (AKA IO shield ) and your using a great break for PSU LOL I had to do it !!!
If you're building a whole system this month you would have to be a fool not to wait a couple more weeks...
Can MasterAir G100M and Team Delta R RGB on 2 and 4 ram slot pair together on motherboard B450M mortar or pro4, without any height / room issues?
Hello Paul I hope everything its going well. Are u planning on making a B Friday build. Thank you kindly for your time.
Hey, can you run some benchmarks on this build vs the Intel build!? Thanks!
Paul it seems you forgot building PCs! You need to check how Verge does it.... XD Nice video as always man!
That case is a glorified pile of scrap metal. Good video though!
That case is super ugly
That Case looks like a fucking nightmare
Someone wanna give me $1300? Btw this much money and 2600x?
Ryzen vs intel which one is better for gaming?
Is an x470 motherboard even worth it?
Does anyone one here know to download Microsoft update 1803 without freeze ups? Microsoft has taken over my computer 3 times and they can't download 1803 either. They said I had a hardware issue and need a new computer. Is a new computer all I can do? Microsoft sometimes is a joke.
Think you could show a FULL newbie build? Ex: components you need, how to match to have things that work (ex: ram for ryzen. Can only use so much MHz, needs to be compatible to ryzen. Ryzen works better with higher speed,Intel, not as much, etc), how to update your drives, why, how to install Windows and on which memmory ( sad, m.2 etc) complete top to bottom. Etc I see full builds everywhere but not too to bottom. Thank you
1 month ago I built my PC with vega 56 Red Dragon, r5 1600 and 16gb RAM for 900 euro
I kinda like the layout of that case, it's not something you see, but for $200 they could include another vertical GPU mount, because they added one, but it's very close to the side panel, which totally negates the fans positioned at the bottom, while if you can put your graphics card a couple inch back from that, you'd have a ton of air going through and reaching also the CPU, which is otherwise blocked by the horizontal GPU
The pin connectors are placed in such an unaesthetic place on GPU's. When will they update this? xD
Thank God for AMD pricing and the AM4 platform!! It's a beautiful thing when U don't have to buy a new motherboard to upgrade your CPU....
I don't know why all youtubers add funny fantasy fans and cabinets, those lighting are of no use, i will avoid the fancy stuff and update the Ryzen 5 to 7 for that waste of money.
You should build a pc that looks like a gaming pc but actually isn't a gaming pc.
What is wrong with them people who design and make this case in this video? My case is H500 and is bloody brilliant.
Hello sir can you tell me a good budget mother board for AMD 2400G
Dust filter at bottom is probably folded for easier shipping and packing of replacement parts.
When is black friday again?
I got a better idea... Ask your cousin for their unwanted computer (that is good and not yet old) for free Because thats what i did
Not finished watching yet but wanted to comment....why is there a Ryzen 7 sticker in a Ryzen 5 Processor? can see at about 1:29 in video
Worse channel.
Why do people like putting the radiator on top? It doesnt make sense to me. Heat will rise and the radiator takes the heat. No bueno
Wow the Vega card is still a terrible choice at that price...
one big dislike for the case
Garbage case
You can honestly build something with a 2700x and a 1080ti in it provided you're willing to buy refurbs/used. Which actually makes a ton of sense considering 1080tis at most have seen maybe a years worth of use and are already going used for around $550 thanks to the 2080s rolling out.
This garbage case is 200$? are you kidding me? Go with the R6 <.>
Why did your 2600x come with a ryzen 7 sticker?
Does anyone know how to get the rgb cooler to slowly change color like his is doing at 15:29 ? Mine never does that
"AN" before words that start with a vowel or have a vowel sound, actually.
Am I only here that notice the amd sticker is ryzen 7 not 5?
The GPU looks sweet.
Still, use Blu-ray drives in My HTPC's. So it's an old-school Corsair case for My next build.
Why did he put thermal paste when the AIO has paste? Just curious.
Hi Paul, could you say something about compatibilty when it comes to the B450 Tomahawk and the Ripjaw 3200 RAM? Afaik it's not on MSI's list for the board so i switched to the x-flare myself, but that's 70-80 bucks more. thx, awesome video as always ;-)
the intake filter likely folds so it will clear the wall if its set near the wall maybe?
I like the concept of the layout of the case but boy that build quality :( collermaster really dropped the ball
the slightest movement shakes the pc way too much, looking at that graphic card going up and down yikes.
Remind me not to get that case
Can you do a $500 build next? with used parts
can you do the bios please
I'm really disappointed in that case after watching this video. Also not gonna lie that build is kinda lame. Sorry Paul.
What a waste of money. I would go with dual socket 1366 motherboard and two Xeon 6/12 overclocked to 4.2Ghz and shit load of cheap DDR3 running in triple channel. This build would allow you to get Nvidia 1080 card rather than that pile of crap Radeon. You reviewers are not thinking this at all. At any price point Intel has better offering. And $200 for that pile of crap case is also waste of money. There are better cases for just $50. People do not listen to review like this and the reason not is because videos are like this are nothing more than commercial for the companies they got parts from and not to actually give you any good advice. No hard feelings.
that case looks like trash. some serious quality/materials compromises
Joe-saving your ass again,Paul! ;-)
Ryzen 5 2600X with this cheap ram will work? GeIL EVO POTENZA 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 2400
RTX is on for that RAM while on the table. My eyes are bugging out! EDIT: When rebuilding my system after 6mo cleaning (Ryzen 1700x, ASRock X370 Taichi, ASUS ROG Strix 1070ti) I was watching that "things you'll need video" and immediately needed 2 fan extensions for cable management. WATCH THE VIDEO PRIOR TO ORDERING AND BUILDING!!! IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE!
2018 and CM have this kind of case? wtf!
I like the way the top mesh lets the tea in.
Cab be built for less.
any motherboard besides tomahawk?
I bought a used ryzen 1500x system for 300 dollar.
That case is alot nicer than I thought, but alas, it still lacks space for a 5.25 4K dvd drive. :/
CM H500 still the best case imo.
Is good ryzen with water cooling?
I’m having a problem with all of my games stuttering and dropping a ton of frames. It’s starting to make my games unplayable. I’m running a r3 1200 and a 1060 3gb. Any suggestions?
I wish this case would allow you to rotate the motherboard 90 degrees so that the GPU could hang from the top like some older Silverstone cases. In it's standard configuration, the GPU would block airflow to the CPU making using an air cooler not a great option.
WTF WAS THAT AT 0:42 0:43. THAT RAM IS POSESSED
Not liking this case , to many hickups
What an odd/garbage case. I'm happy with my Corsair 570x. It's also $80 cheaper.
lol what an ugly case on top of it all being bad
bottom fans haven't rgb?
Remember the times when parts was so affordable you could just build with the fastest? Come to think of it I can't remember those times in the last 40 years, lol..
This is my opinion but that PC Case looks like it's designed based on a house Chimney due to the intake from the bottom to outtake at top. Not saying it's a bad case, just underwhelming.
A little upset that he doesn't go with the parts he advertises.
the case is a jokee broski boom
Is amd graphics any better than GeForce for the price and what are the pros and cons?
That is about the worst case layout I have seen!!
Definitely impressed by your review on the case, but the case did not impress me at all. Thanks, much appreciated .
that case sucks... you can not turn off the psu without disassembly
I like this case, it looks sleek, and it innovates, but the price and absence of a relay power switch are just criminal. Vertically mounting the GPU to optimize airflow towards the CPU is a must.
so you have to open the side panel every time to switch the psu on :thinking: or just leave the psu on for eternity otherwise
You mentioned you were going to change settings for the count latency of the ram from 14 to something else...? can I ask why?
Watching PC builds is my zen
Bad case...
I was waiting Intel Platform ??
Hi Paul , I would sell my Soul for a PC
that case looks really nice but it has a look about it thats going to look super "dated" in years to come
Im trying NOT to fail not nut november
if all tempered glass cases will always have an option to get them with solid side panels instead that TG it would be a thing..... not everyone is in RGB TEMPERED GLASS TRAIN, some people are still classy
nice build, the case isn't for me but not too bad. The logo on the video card looks like the poop emoji in red when you're 5' - 6' away. You're welcome ??
Guess how soon before that case sells for $80???? I think it will be right after Christmas. ??????
What an ugly graphics card!
that case is ugly
CoolerMaster at it again...2 drunk R&D designers trying to come up with a unique case and "F's" it up once again
I don t like this case !
It kind of reminds me a of a borg alcove for some reason.
Here in Germany a the Sapphire Pulse RX Vega 56 is available for 349€ It’s cheaper than the cheapest GTX 1070
Why are they still putting USB 2.0 ports on the front of cases? 3.0's are backward compatible, right?
Semi modular*
this is a 15min showcase on why NOT to buy that case , great build, absolutely awful case..
So I just basically watched a 15 min case review.
Why is no one using the x470 platform?
Why i am watching this.. I dont even have a PC ??
you should make a song... Build of tha month
Why is there an airplane on the Tomahawk box? Why not an axe?
Bottom dust filter is hinged because it'll be easier to remove it if you have your computer's back against a wall. By folding it you don't have to move your case that much.
I keep noticing builds that use super powerful equipment. Have you ever considered making a build as efficient as possible? Best power conversion / least heat loss, highest frequency / Watt, etc?
very nice build, the case looks nice even though they made some poor design choices
A shoe box may have been a better option for the case, rather than that thing.
mmm that PSU is at an odd place.
Make a cheapest streaming pc... Please
whats up fucker! love ya man
I'm now highly impressed with my case lol
The build starts at 8:43
This whole build is not... very nice, to be honest. The case is questionable, and so is the graphics card. The whole thing is... meh.
Nice build, shame about the case. That's a poor location for the PSU, why would you need to open a case just to switch it on also the air flow to the PSU looks restricted.
I think that case is uniquely dogshit
1:28 - Props to the included "Ryzen 7" sticker for the Ryzen 5 2600X
I would think a 2700 would be better for future proofing for games, as things will be getting more demanding next year and the extra cores will be better utilized. Im looking at you Battlefield 5
I don't like how the psu does not vent directly out of the case .
Hi Paul love the channel. These build vids are great and loving the no holds barred review of the case along the way. Have you thought about a little bit more info on the features of motherboards that go in these builds. Some newer viewers might not know what a USB3 type C header even looks like pointing a bit of the stuff out. Not Gamers Nexus levels of detail but the cliff notes an enthusiast buyer might want to know?
The last product show you and Kyle went to along with Jay and Steve and a few others showed a quick connect AIO that EVGA was working on but yet I see nothing on their site about it . I wonder what happened to it . I liked the idea of a non-leaking quick connection that can be added to .
2g and 3g network works.
I wonder how the AIO Will perform, considering it sits directly at the air exhaust where all the heat will have accumulated because of the upward cooling solution. It can't take air in because that would mean getting too much positive pressure inside of your case; and when it exhausts air than all the hot air from the graphics card and the rest of the components would just heat up the water inside the radiator. I'm pretty curious.
truly, this case is disgusting.
Paul I LOVE your videos, but can I make a small suggestion to your editor? Please don't up-cut every single space of air in your dialog while you are on camera as it's gets to be jarring. We don't mind a few extra words from you because, well, you're awesome!
3G network works.
I am not getting this channel contents in the youtube RECOMMENDED tab (homepage) , instead on the Up next tab while watching other tech videos or such. wonder why.
I'm a simple guy - I see a Paul's Hardware video, I click on it.
“If you can build in this CM case you can build in any case... with ease” Holy freaking crap the layout in this thing is like a puzzle! Definitely wouldn’t recommend this to first time builders lol.
Seems like glass sides are getting very popular but what is the cases rf shield rating with these glass panels and the cases that are mostly plastic?
NO FAP NOVEMEBER
can you please do a hackintosh build to compete vs mac mini please
1:26 why do you have a ryzen 7 series sticker with ryzen 5 processor??
Actually, actually, actually, little, actually, little, little, actually. Amazing job at the old talking a d using English, Paul. Actually amazing.
Why is there no 90 degree adapter to plug in video cards so the wires are not sticking straight out the side?
Is it good to buy on amazon? Or is there any cheaper stores?
Hey Paul, would you recommend to use the storeMI? :D
It's like 70% of the video is about that case and 30% about the build. Don't like the case anyway.
I need to upgrade my pc
That pcb on the gpu is cool. I’d be interested in seeing thermals on it. I wish manufacturers would extend a small portion of the pcb to the back for the power cables. It looks weird in the middle of the shroud imo. Or maybe a 90 degree connector.
That case seemed like a letdown. Maybe next time you try to do a full tower build go back to a nice corsair 760t black those things are beastly though you might need a couple of extensions for some of the plugs:P
Although the case quality isn't that great, I think the design of it is really interesting. It kind of reminds me of Porsche Design. What would be pretty cool is if you did a Porsche themed PC.
I think silver-stone has it nailed when it comes to cases with the intake at the bottom such as the ft03
Im still waiting for my cool master ml360 aio...is it good?
Do yourself a favor and buy a Fractal Design Meshify C, do not buy this case. It looks awful and appears to also be awful.
That case with a aluminium side panel instead of the glas one would look sick.
please do under $1000 intel pc.
What do u do with all these PCs u build? Do u keep them?sell them? Or give them away to subs
What is Black Friday?
Really want a Vega GPU but I know I will have to step down to an RX 580.
I am glad that Paul says so himself: a $65-85 aircooler and a $80 case (like the Fractal S) would make a lot more sense for this build. Just because there is no value added by that AIO or by such an expensive case (no added performance) so spend that money on your hardware instead.
At last something away from Intel. I don't understand why 9900 is so good it 70% more expensive and only 25% faster
Is the tomahawk b450 really good?. I mean a lot people recommended that
Unique layout, unique design. Paul's professional way of saying "shitty"
That case is horrible and the video card is probably worse than reference.
I personally love cooler master products.I have a cooler master masterbox MB500.It's a straight forward case.This case your using may be akward at first but i personally would love to build one of those just for the learning experience :D
That case sucks! Well i guess its ok if you want to cook your hardware.
Any thoughts about the AMD Horizon event?
I bought that same red dragon vega 56 a few days ago also but for $330 with 3 free games
The case may have been damaged in manufacturers storage, and placed in a new box (after an inspection that didn't catch the reshaped leg) prior to shipping.
damn vega 56 here in my country still cost more than 1070
Well done paul you built a PC :p
I built something similar but with a 1070 and Phanteks P300 case for 850$. No fancy cooler
nice build paul but i have to say that case is a horrible big thing
Yup shit case, $49 MAYBE ,but I wouldn't use it even at that price.
This video kinda making me wanna nut ngl
Does anyone know about how much I would be able to sell this PC for from Alienware it is a aura r7 it is about one year old Intel® Core™ i7 8700 (6-Core, 12MB Cache, up to 4.6GHz with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology) NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080 with 8GB GDDR5X 16GB Dual Channel DDR4 at 2666MHz; up to 64GB 128GB M.2 SATA SSD (Boot) + 2TB 7200RPM SATA HDD Alienware™ 850 Watt Multi-GPU Approved Power Supply with High Performance Liquid Cooling Killer 1535 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi Wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1
I'm gonna go with the blower Vega 56. I'd like the Red Dragon, but it's price has gone up since Gamer's Nexus did his video comparing it to a 2070
Hey hey now... you pulled fast one... 2600x is not r7. Why you have r5 sticker?
PowerColor has a limited 1 year warranty i would never buy one...
This case would be way better if were around $79.
PSA time: I was using G.Skill Ripjaws V RAM in my R5 1600X system, and started having serious issues with programs corrupting/not starting/not operating as intended. G.Skill has several variants of the Ripjaws V RAM, some made with SK Hynix chips, some with Samsung chips; mine were SK Hynix, which is DEFINITELY not on the verified RAM list. I haven't tried any sticks with Samsung chips, but Samsung B Die is supposedly better for Ryzen performance.
That case is HUGE, maybe I'm too used to my Meshify C
Did anyone else notice at 1:25 there is a ryzen 7 sticker in the 2600x box
that's a beautiful AIO from coolermaster, Man I actually like the look of that more then the Kraken X62
This computer should definitely be run on the floor.
Thanks for being transparent with us with those affiliate links. Some other channels will not even mention it in their description. I really appreciate that and I'm definately going to buy one of those items!
Hey Paul, the folding bottom dust filter is so you can get it out if the PC case us close to a wall. It's very hard to get it out without moving the whole thing otherwise. By letting it fold in half, you only need half the clearance to remove it.
I can't even afford a $1000 gaming pc sadly
No wonder the case is $200 it has 500 parts in it. There’s good overbuilt and bad overbuilt and I’d say this is in the latter category. The updraft ventilation is neat but I’d like to see it executed better.
cool give me Rx580 please #Paul's #Hardware
Why not use a 1070ti is even a little cheaper than the Vega 56
A cheaper case and better card might have been the way to go??
that case is weird. just buy a R6 and call it a day. its got everything and isnt weird.
Northwards?? Its called "upwards"...… Plus seeing all these builds from utubers in crappy cases is vary disappointing. Not one of them have built in a actually nice case like say the inwin 909....
I’m trying to build a gaming pc between 1000-1500$ CAD and I’m using pcpartpicker but I would like some tips and advice from people who have built pcs and parts that I should get!
I watched "that f'ing video" already!
Lol Paul you used the same motherboard as me lol I got mine this past Tuesday XD
1:29 I'm triggered by the incorrect sticker
Would love to see some of that RGB SSDs you can get on those side mounts
Wait, he said his Lian Li case failed in the front glass panel. Is he talking about the O11 dynamic? I was planning to build on that next week. But not if the glass panels are gonna fall off.
No need to bend the rear stand back into place, just put a similar colored furniture foot-like cloth spacer under it, it's in the back so nobody will notice it anyways
id hate to buy a sick case like that and have it defective.
Try to mount the radiator in the bottom of the case, to se if you get better temperatures on CPU.
Can anyone help me with a question please. I have a SSD with Win 10 on it , can I use that in my new build and I wouldn’t have to purchase a new OS key ?? Would that work. Or do I have to fomate the ssd and purchase a new OS all together ??
such a gamers nexus shill...
Man, Vega 56 seems to have shot back up in price lately, was $329 on Newegg for the Red Devil version from either last weekend or the week before last,
Vega. Not even once.
Frank on honest review as always, you are my go to tech guy. Thanks Paul
Air cooler like a wraith? Edit: terminator case
@5:02 Really? :-/ Human beings have robots roaming on Mars. We can observe a galaxy which is ~13.4 billion years old (about 400 million years after the Universe came into being). Meanwhile, the folks over at Cooler Master haven't quite figured out how to put feet on the bottom of a computer case. Yeah, that case to floor interface, it's really a monumental challenge.
Hey Paul, I really like these builds but you haven't done a single intel build at the lower level in months. I am in the middle of trying to build an intel computer at the 1200$ level, so maybe you could do something along those lines? Thanks for the great videos nonetheless!
This case was reviewed by HardwareCanucks and I found this case to be way too over-priced for what it is. It should be $80. The feet looks wiggly for no reason at all, of which is probably to make them look "cooler." But, for the sake of rigidity/stability to the case!?! For $180, the Silverstone FT05 is a better case in every aspect by like 10 miles. And, that case was made like 4-5 years ago. So, rotating the motherboard might be patented which is why Cooler Master can't do it here and have incorporated a half-ass chimney/stacked airflow design. But, when it came to designing the feet, which are essential for stacked airflow cases (having room below for fans to breath), they went all wiggly on it and did it not because of any patents because it can't be patented. The FT05 case just has a simple design that works. Also, the classic Mac Pro case (cheesegrater one) was unveiled in 2003 and shares similar looking "feet" without the "wiggly aspect. And, those work fine without it looking "wiggly." This is what you get with bottom-of-the-line cases intended to "look" a certain way (making it look a certain way is "free") but asking for a premium for making it look "cool." And, you see this in every aspect of PC components, which has been a trend since mid-2000's (if I am correct) that doesn't seem to have an end in sight.
i watched that fucking video
I'm trying to build a rig for my 20th birthday that is coming up this December and I'm conflicted on which rx580 to buy. Does anyone have any recommendations?
I got the Red Dragon Vega 56 and its a nice card and very impressed so far.
0:42 Watch the ram
Wow that case is stupid. Everything else is great. lol
basically, dont buy this case...
Surely better to spend that cooler money on.... beer. Actually a NVMe drive.
I'd change the Aio and use the saved money for a 2700 (non x) and use the nice stock rgb cooler it has. But all preferences.
Where’s your allen wrench and your swiss army knife which hopefully has a phillips head screwdriver?
wait... the PSU mounts in the front of the case?
Thank God. I video that doesn't have anything at all to do with the election.
9:10 haha wrong orientation :P
Hey Paul, do you have Asus Prime Z270-A and i7-9700K? Because Asus CPU page says that i7-9700K is supported - https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/PRIME-Z270-A/HelpDesk_CPU/ . Is it a true or mistake by Asus? Can you test it?
The last two months have been all RTX and i9's, now we can't even get a mid range build in a mid range case.
Honestly that case looks absolutely horrendous and on top of that the internal configuration seems like a nightmare!
I would never ever spend $200 for that case.. Horrible design. Unique maybe but it looks like it's going to be a pain in the ass building in that chassis. Also that gpu.. my god. Ugly.
Paul I’m in Australia ???? and I want to build my little brother a pc for under $1500. His friends all have the best of the best of everything. In your opinion can I build a DECENT gaming pc for that?
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JG2192/saved/wDByXL Hey Paul could you please give me any advice on this build that I am planning to make I would sure appreciate it. I live in the United States and I have a budget of $1600 also this will be mainly for gaming as of now but in the future I plan on going into game design. I also would like to add that this will be my very first build so any help you could give me will again be most appreciated. Thank you for your help.
Paul.... I Luv ya, but this case gave me a headache. Thanx for taking one major one for the team, because I'm sure none of us will be buying this case.... I hope you drank afterwards..
Wouldn't this be a good example of when to mount a GPU vertically?
Not a fan of the case. I am glad Cooler Master are trying something different but think they cut corners with it and should have made it slightly cheaper though it was a very good attempt. 200 dollars is way too much money for a case. Obviously this is for enthusiasts.
Vega in a 1k$ build ?! LUL. Over here (Eastern EU) the cheapest vega 56 is about 800$, compared to ~300$ for the rx580 (all taxes included... US is kinda funny showing prices that don't include taxes...) The weird part is that a vega 64 is roughly the same price as a vega 56 (830$ vs 790$) - both Sapphire NITRO+ versions
I'm highly disappointed in the case used. Costly and built like crap. Coolermaster laid an egg with the case used. Complex and strange placements make it a POA to use
heads up kids, if you listen closely just beore the 6 minute mark you'll hear the proper use of the word "cringe". it's like a unicorn.
simple question. when i put my hand on the bottom side of my gpu i can feel the air moving downwards. with the case pushing the air up, wouldn't that cause dead or what ever its called? that stops air flow and maybe cooling issues?
What are all of your opinions on Radeon card+freesync monitor vs nvidia card+gsync monitor?
I wonder how much longer it will be until GPUs get so powerful that they'll have to expand the PCIE to enable more data transfer.
If Paul doesn't have one million subs by January 1st, I will rip the wings off of 25 butterflies.
What a dumb case. None of the design decisions make any sense.
12:32 Paulius Heimlich hardware watch your language.
EGG CELL LENT
I need a new pc I would love to have it.
Jeez cooler master used to be so great. Sad.
Why is the psu so weird
Im gonna be building this computer for 850 euros
Have you made a $2000-$2200 AMD Build?
With all the promotion Radeon seem to get these days, i feel like their end is near...And that is unfortunate.
200$ case still has ketchup and mustard front panel connectors
I have been looking at that case online, The bottom cooling kinda interested me. Be looking for Video PT 2
A PC named 'Weebles'? (.."Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.")
That Ram tho....
@Paul: Could you compare the price of similar computers including the monitors? (for example: vega 56/64 card + freesync monitor vs. rtx2070 + g-sync monitor)
For the price of that case I would expect a lot more from it. I've seen much better cases at a cheaper price plus that case is as ugly as sin.
I'm a simple man, I see Paul's new video, I drop everything else I'm doing to watch it.
am i the only one who thinks the case is ugly?
Excellent build. Question, @4:15 ..."change the timings on FlareX"..., why? Isn't CL14 the best for 3200MHz? Enlighten me Sir.
Since air is being drawn from the bottom of the case and exhausted out of the top, how much of that initial intake is immediately being blocked/impeded by that huge obstruction / gpu?
This is the build of a person that doesn't know much about computers.
Such a nice and powerful build for only 1000$!!! Only possible cause of AMD...I guess...
Nice 1 Paul
RX Vega 56 Red Dragon or Gtx 1070 ti / Gtx 1080? Currently they are priced the same in my region.
That case is awesome. But I wonder, when case manufacturers will learn to put a backup switch to the rear of their cases, if the PSU is hidden inside...
very nice I plan to get that card this winter screw the rtx cards! Lol
the case seems like an expensive inconvenience
Are more pc cases doing away with cd trays ?
Don't like that case Paul...there's much better in that price range.
3:20 That power connector placement is horrible.
Thanks for doing build videos like this one. It's nice to see content creators use a more modest budget, and I look forward to watching the performance comparison video.
They don't sell B450 TOMAHAWK in my country (Sweden). What's your opinion on MSI B350M MORTAR?
Buildzoid would disagree with the Mobo choice, according to him the only good B3/450 MB is the B450 Gaming Carbon as everything else only has 4 phases for the cpu. Anyway Ryzen does fine on 4, it is just not remarkable
just dont know about that case it's nice , but i think i would take a pass on it even at half the price, just not crazy about the whole layout and the power supply being up in the front.
While the case seems nice, there are a few things that I don't particularly like but the only one not mentioned by Gamers Nexus was that the power supply should be able to have the fan facing the interior of the case instead of facing the closed off front panel. Power Supplies need to breathe too...
this case looks cheap and ugly as fuck. What idiot would consider it in the first place?
Another failed retarded case...
Good work! keep it up!
I like the build, great video.
Nice video as always Paul. I have to say though that i do not like that coolermaster case, too weird a layout for my taste
Paul! I'm planning a 2950x build and I need help! There's confusion around compatible memory and the enermax tr4 v2 aio coolers. What's the fastest memory available, and in what configuration? Has enermax fixed the problem(s) with the tr4 aios? Is air cooling the 2950x a viable option?
Case looks terrible. And seems building in it is terrible too.
https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/b/CqXPxr could you please give me some tips on this, what could I do to improve it for a similar price range? Used for gaming and possibly streaming in 1080p monitor is 144hz 1ms
IPHONE X GIVEAWAY https://youtu.be/gJh7C-s3Bzo
Paul, I watched that f***ing video. I swear.
great price!... until i remember I'm canadian and its nowhere near that here..lol
X470 or a B450?
You can see through half of that Vega 56...
Build me a wife please!
Cool!!!!
Thanks for the great video, Paul!
If anyone is interetsed in another PC build, i would really appreciate if you could check out my new tech channel and drop a sub. I would really appreciate some support and i hope you enjoy my content (more on the way!) Thanks everyone!
''you can save money by going with an aircooler maybe''??? WHAT, what about using the included cooler ?? ryzen doesnt even oc that good and the included cooler is more then enough.
That gaming PC look nice
Do an itx bould
The RAM looks like it's photoshopped in at the beginning of the video
Well, heres hoping for more budget (<$750ish) in 2019.. 2018 seems to be the year of holy price jumps, Batman. Everything seems SO much more expensive, for the small improvements we’re actually getting :/
This is beyond science
Jesus, that GPU is the size of a skateboard haha
This is awesome
That case box is as big as a house
Luks gud

do you have time to talk about building workstation PC for 3d animation?
Spend 5k on a pc with two 980ti’s....
the only sound i heard during the fan noise test was only my own fans
Fuck is sexy
Watching this in 2017 and by today's standards your PC is slow lol the new Core i9 processors can get you up to 8k gaming now lol crazy stuff imagine in 5 years time how advanced PCs will be again
fast forward to 2017 and a basic mid range gaming pc is better than this ! Gots ta loves the pc gamingz :D
4K Roblox?
This pc is 5x the cost of mine....... my god....
nu esti pasionat de nimic , esti un pusti arogant care crede ca a descoperit roata din/pe banii parintilor ...
Pc case?
whats the name of that computer case?
it is funny how 980ti s on sli got similar fps with one 1080. a few years down the line we will treat the 1080ti like it is a decent gpu lol
Are you using pepto bismol to cool your pc?
Salut . Observ ca esti pasionat de hackintosh. Putem discuta pe tema aceasta ? eventual prin mai sau chiar prin telefon. Merci
You know the drill But do you know the screwdriver?
Lol how now just one 1080ti or even 1080 performs like this
I know i'm, uh, late, but why does Metro have a lower minimum frame rate at 1080p then at 4k?
2:37 That's my case in the background!
the performance is not as good as my 4x 1080 sli
Oh wait...this was made in 2015...before the i7-7770k and Quadro...
What I would change is if you got a i7-7770k and a Quadro with 24 Gigs of VRAM. You only need one montior.
case?
was wonderinf what led strip you used?
how did you make the graphs?
This ni??????a has a $5k pc. I'm dreaming for a $500 budget gaming pc :/

Fridged 36 degree Celsius?
what is the`case?
its just to much
I just wonder how he got an idle of 19C that's 65 degrees Fahrenheit! Living in in California that means he must be running the Air Conditioning non stop.
that is not very good I can make a 3000 dollar pc better he put way to much on a gpu that sucks and you could buy one gpu that is better for the same as the both of those
I am the only one who noticed the audiojungle mark on the beginning of the audio? :D Spends 5000 dollar on a pc and dont have 10 dollar for a sound clip... Well done... :D
Can someone please tell me the name of the case he has?
TACOOOOOOOSSS!!!
Hi Kyle, I have almost exact same pc rig (except the CPU, and RAM) and I wanted to ask you are you still using this rig for your daily usage? If yes, have you had any problems with it (USB 3.0 issues, BIOS and etc.) Thanx for answering and good luck!
Can it run Minecraft at above 60 FPS though?
Can it run minecraft at 30fps ?
Can it run minecraft at 30fps ?

Lol as he let us listen to background noise a train passed my house ??????
This is the machine from my dreams. Literally. I have a shitty budget build with an i3 processor, 4gb of RAM running a GTX 950. I actually just had a dream last night that I came home from school, sat down at my computer. And something seemed different about it. I was running this EXACT build, but all the flashy colors were blue. Along with the glass being tinted blue. I had an 18 button MMO mouse with a flashy mechanical keyboard. And I got a new monitor that does 1440p. I also got a Playstation 4 plugged into the same monitor and simply needed to turn on to play it. Life was good. Until I woke up. Then I looked over to my left... and there it was... shitty i3 950 4gb RAM. Full specs: GPU: MSI GTX 950 2gb MEMORY: 4gb of RAM CPU: Intel(r) Core i3 520 Storage: 1tb hard drive + 100gb SSD FPS: Due to lack of ram and cheap i3 processor, I bottleneck the performance of the 950, badly. So I generally, on games like The Witcher 3 and Battlefield 1, get around 40 FPS on the middle-low settings.
Negative air pressure?
why only 16gb or ram
that expensive cpu bottleneck tho
bending?
You should've picked a better case but other than that pretty good.
i know when dat "hotline" bling
i only get 11 to 16 fps on pay day 2 on 720p not even 1080p and you guys want 100+ fps on 4 k craaazy
oh man that watercooling makes me wet
I guess you can say he has hotline bling.
Thanks for this series, I'm just now getting interested in building a water cooled system and this was a great reference for what to expect.
Best looking case is c21 versa RGB with strix gpu inside and water)
ayy, uploaded on my birthday!
2x Titan Xp are better
Time for a revamp
Yo I'm making a 800$ pc build. It this a good pc for gaming? https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Oasis_Angel/saved/Lr9P6h
I like how in the intro hes wearing a linus tech tips t-shirt lol
Whats the pc case? its not in the part list
Win
whats the case plz reply
Personally i would upgrade to a 7700k but thats just me.
Tacos???
can it play chess at 15 fps?
why not a titan x pascal
But can it run Minesweeper?
Can i have it plz
tacos ;)
I can buy a better computer for cheaper.
yeah msaa is very taxing
its bad that you have a 19ºC idle temperature as moisture will build up on the die
Tacos.
Very nice rig!! Congrats on the build. Very nice indeed
But... why. My $550 pc can run any game very smoothly.
I FUCKING LOVE THAT GAME.
I wish i have that huhuhu in the future ill have that????
whats the case name
cpu botleneck? mmhhmhhh
what case is he using?
I can't hear your PC's sound over how loud mine is...
TACOS
Can someone tell me what Res/Pump he is using?
max temps on package 98°C? O.o 2:00
It's better the fractal r5 or the s for watercooling?
is it ironic that i could not hear his fan noise over the sound of my own computers fan noise.
1440p is not the same thing as 2k
Excellent Video! If you have time could you please check out my vid as well?
But... is it vr ready
i cant tell if its my laptop or the 5000$ pc did i mention the hard drive
Wait can it run candy crush ?
How come I don't see the Zotac GTX 1080 AMP Extreme on any builds? They are currently(as of December 13th 2016) the most powerful(correct me if I'm wrong) GTX 1080 on the market and maybe the most powerful gaming graphics card on the market.
You know that SLI bridge is a bottleneck. I upgraded to better SLI bridge and saw a noticeable improvement. 10-20%
But can it run roblox at 10 FPS????
but can it run minesweeper at 5 fps ?
do you have a degree or certification or anything like that for pc building?
when you did the sounds of your pc all i could hear were the roars from mine...
lol can't hear your computer in the video over mine.
ahhhhhhh why did you use plastic brackets in your cooling?!
Try This Parts https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dLXCFd This is my Build Now Can Run Any AAA Games in Very High to Ultra on 1080p 1440p and 4K No Issues Shipping: $15.61 Total: $5156.18

Separate bat poster svznxgy extra alien diamond heavily
6:11 Yeah! Tacos!
you have too much money
my pc is loud lik ae jet engine.
But can it run pong?
at such budget I would have went for Intel i7 6800k or 6850x and titan x
He swearing Linus tech tips short
THESE ARE THE BEST RATED PERFORMANCE GAMING LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS http://www.originpc.com/?aid=3069
couldnt hear the PC mine was too loud.....
Tacos?
What case is that
was the mic on when the system was underload. My hp pavilion was louder
What case did he use?
jeeeeezzass, I'm jealous :<
That's still nothing.
does anyone know the pomp/res he's using i cant find it in the parts lists. i know he mentioned it in the first one but still cant find the exact one. If anyone could give me a link that would be great.
1:11 I thought there was 32gb of DDR4 ram?
dont you think 16 ps4s will do a little better job?
What chassis is that?
but can it run arma 3? lol
I bet I can run minecraft
bet you got the bequiet fans
la consentida #samsung
i think 1440p is the sweet spot for gaming you get the high frame rate with great visuals the leap from 1080p to 1440p is pretty noticeable but if i look from 1440p to 4k its not nearly as noticeable
7 minutes is a bit much for an ad
whats the thing that is like an sli bridge but is used for wtercooling.PLS HELP
Question why didn't you go for 2 1080's?
what the point of custom water cooling if CPU still gets almost 100c?
Cool pc dude but can it run Crysis
sorry guys stop trying to act just get to the point......
But can it run Stick Rpg at 10 fps?
those temperatures are kind of high... i have, on a corsair cooler (h100i gtx), a 5820k @ 4.3GHz and it idles at 28-32 C, regular gaming load at 40-45 C and full stress test peak of 60 C after many hours. my single 980ti hybrid from evga runs at identical temps in similar situations to the cpu, though the 980ti is at its stock overclock, sometimes cooler than the cpu since it is stock. i have a second 980ti hybrid shipped om its way but i know it will the same temps, after all these all have closed loops. maybe that loop you have is not enough for an overclocked 5960x and two 980ti's. Your system is a little quieter though. but i also have a lot more fans.
probably can't run crysis 1
Can I play minesweep on it ?
Those benchmarks are a fucking lie, even 1080's in 2x sli get an average of arround 60fps in most 4k games and he's not even using that good of cards in his system and is claiming bullshit results.
am I the only one who always thought 4k was 1440p??
They don't call it "4K" because of the pixels. They call it "4K" because that's how much money you shell out to get a PC that can run it.
wait so can this run minecraft?
Does he have trues?
What case is this? Sweet build by the way!
would this pc run arma 3 and gta v on high +60fps cause im moving from console to pc: -intel core i5-6600k 3.5gh -cooler master cpu cooler -16gb ripjaw ram -msi geforce 970 or 1060 (not sure which one) -650w 80+ gold power supply
Im gonna build this machine, so that i can run minsweeper at 2.6 fps
I watched this video just to know which computer case he used and he didn't mentioned it even once.. ??.. Anybody else??
That dude in the start is in loads of tech videos for some reason. Like jayztwocents, that guy was there
Will minecraft work?
hey does anyone know what the name of the case is?
who's got the money for this?!?!? you have to be rich spend all of your savings lol but who really wants spend all of that?
0:19 wtf is that behind ?
Is that a LinusTechTips shirt that that guy had?
Why do people bother with HDD's with such a budget ,just use SSD's?
Awesome
Tacos?
what case is this?
I ate tacos for dinner
But can it run hotline miami...?
i have a 500$ pc that can run pretty much every game at ultra lol dont see the point of a 5k pc
you should of been able to get atleast +400 on the memory :P
why do people use water t water cool use coolant car or motorbike coolant
I dislike water cooling because the water pipes could breaks at any moment
You need better specs... This machine will barely run minecraft at 15fps
The 6950X is $1700!!!
I like dat colour
Awesome looking, and performing, pc!
Dumbass budget Looks for me actually bootz videq"when
Will it play LOL and CGSO & DOD ?
slam 2 gtx 1080s in sli in that build
I couldn't hear the sound test over my loud PC...
But can it play minesweeper?
Literally just picked up a GTX 960 for $140, best deal of my lifeeee
Your PC is colorful like bling I know when that Hotline Bling!
Do company sell pc made like that?
2:00 wow, my NH-D14 air cooler gets better temps... :0
ohh its my pc case :D
lol that guy from the start of the vid had a linus tech tips shirt
Pink liquid!!! I was wondering if you have build this PC for someone else.
is it capable of running minesweeper?
looks like the color scheme is based on the game hotline miami.
already slow, just 9 months later you need 1080s son.
tacosss

Tacos.

I'm jealous
One more year until I build my overkill PC.
Sure... Taaacos
i liked the SOUND at idle and load! ITS SO RHYTHMIC
amazing setup !
can i have this pc? thx...
change the gpus with 2x gtx 1080s
I'm planning on doing a magneto-esk color theme on my build for a red mobo and memory was going to do 4 purple fans but was debating on doing 2 red 2 purple one of each as top exhaust and one of each as front intake. can't decide if I want to just go straight pruple and get a red led strip to highlight or mix match the colors and I'm losing my mind haha. I've tried looking for purple and red fan configuration but found nothing, I'm jot sure if the red will drown out the purple or vice versa, what do yall think?? would love some input x]
idiot test watch dogs then see the results I guarantee you will not be happy with the results
Why use liquid cooling?
Dude I think you uploaded this in the wrong website. This belongs on PornHub. Look at the curves,the pink color, that body! Kreygasm
i wish people making these awesome videos about watercooling would tell us how many of each fitting they used. i making almost the exact same system and have no idea what fittings to buy.
All i heard was my amd stock cooling fan spinning at 5000 rpm
u probably didn't see those extra frames on 4k.
you can get a 4k gaming pc for only $1500 now
but can it run minesweeper?
Burritos?
Witcher 3?
But can you run PONG?
What case is that
Kyle Hansen. Your list for epic nano PC on amazon is very well built and i'm thinking of ordering the whole list to make myself one! No sarcasm... obviously
hahaha im just noticing this now, but you don't have back fan :p
Did your wife see the expenses check yet?
Can it run club penguin at 10 fps ?
A high price pc and you run shitty FPS at 4k, not worth it.
That awkward moment when you watch this and your pc only has i5 650 and a gtx 470
My intel hd 3000 is 3000 times better than your build
I didn't know your second name was Hansen Kyle Hansen ??????
I'm curious. Is Fractal Design really good? I just bought the Design S case as my first part for building a PC (starting from scratch). Next up is the motherboard but I'm looking for good a good company that I can trust and stick with that doesn't over price the SH*T out of it's products.
lol get rekt'd by a 1080
Now time to replace the gpu to the 1080
You here about all these PCs and I just make do with my MacBook Pro
I literally have everything this computer had except the 980 gtx (Mine is 970), and the ssd (I have 128 ssd + 2 TB HDD 7200). And o bought mine for $1,000 lol...
;) Look at this guy asking me about tacos ;) I like tacos
Is that the shirt from linus tech tips?
I want it....
does it bling
I can dream
Upgrade to 32 gb ram
Glass tubing???
wuts the case
can it run hotline miami on low settings at 5 fps
what mobo is kyle using?
Ti*
I run 2 gtx 750 to in sli and I get nice frame rates
when kyle showed hotline's acoustics i could hear my computer's fans running while i had the headphones on XD
The question is: will it run minecraft?
Overall nice looking case. But I got to say: Dem 90 degree bends on the tubes are amazing.
what is that amazing case it is sitting in?
I feel he went weak on ram. should have gone for 32 gb
I really like your channel and I was wondering what pcs do you use on a daily basis, and what do you do with the ones that aren't in use? Do you keep them in display like ironman with his suits?
You used to call me on the cellphoneeee
"frigid 36 celcius" you do realize that's like 80 - 90 Fahrenheit right
DOEST IT RUN CLUB PENGUIN?
Did he say 16 gigs of ddr4?
What case is this
what is the brand of the your computer case? (Sorry I' m Turkish)
Ok I'm officially jelly. Lol. Nice build dude. Very sick.
I'm torn on what to do. I desperately need to upgrade my i7-3960x. I see you rocking the i7-5960x, but with broadwell coming out soon I don't know if I should wait for the deca core or go with this. I have seen a lot of good things from the 5960x but would broadwell be worth waiting for?
Enyo Essence on property
rose? bah
good to see my pc can handle 30 fps sometimes when lucky and usually around 20 fps... pfff
And here I am playing skyrim on lowest settings at 20 fps
can this run minesweeper????
replace your 980Tis with 1080s. alot better and no need to replace Ur psu. that is so convenient
My PC: Intel Core i7 4790k MSI GTX 960 4GB Asus Z97-A Motherboard 16GB Crucial DDR3 1866MHz Be Quiet! Dark Rock 3 Cooler 5TB Seagate Barracuda Hard drive Samsung 850 Evo 250GB Ssd Corsair CX600W power supply All packed in a White NZXT Noctis 450
What Reservoir is that?
yesssss tacos!
That is a lot of money for a computer. You could pay about only $1200 and get a computer that can run most games.
UPDATE THIS WITH GTX 1080s ASAP PLEASE. Thank you.
at 2:44 i can't hear something cause my computer sounds so much Dx lol
You own so my Titan x's and I'm sure go have a Titan z or 2... Why use and 980 ti SLI when you have the better gpu's??
Running twin 7950s, manages 4k alright. Latest amd beta drivers have them running together much more smoothly. It used to run ok with the exception of the odd update that didn't agree with xfire. GTAV runs quite well at 4k but naturally with old cards it requires fiddling. Nice to see software support for a card thats close to 4 years old now.
Can someone please tell me the name of the pump and reservoir combo? My son needs it for his upcoming water cooled build, in the Define S.
Gotta love him sitting there in an LTT shirt...
Seriously can't find this pump/res combo. I ended up getting alphacool's all-in-one lighttower and an alphacool pump, but 1, they don't have enough room to stack because you can't mount the res vertically, and 2 I'm pretty sure they left out the plug that blocks the huge hole on the side where you would mount a pump. I'm about ready to ditch the pump/res that I have, but can't find this combo anywhere. HALP PLS!!!
But it look's like a box? why pink? where is cool looking PC Gaming design???
Can it run minesweeper?
I hate how no matter what you get, there is always something to make it look bad. But i guess that is the way it is.
Is it possible I can run half life 1 at 10fps
Why PINK!
What is the name of the pump and reservoir combo?
60 fps gaming is so 2012, 144 hz is the future.
"CPU bottlenecking", what cpu do you have? i7 5960x..............
I have seen some water cooling pc's EXPENSIVE AS FUCK
would 2 960s in sli run games in 4K?
spill a glass of coke on it, "there goes my bank account
What is the case?
TACOS!!!!!!!
if you want swag gameplays check my channel out and subscribe
But will it run Crysis?
Dude you don't need a so expensive PC you can get a PC that runs every game on 60 fps for a 1000 bucks
what is the case?
Mmmmmmm Tacos
can this run minecraft? I might ask for this for christmas if it can
Can someone recommend a simple desk for dual monitors?
I bought all the parts for this build to play Minecraft.. Overkill? I think not!
MUST BE NICE!!!!!!!!!!!!
retro ?
Just wondering can I play Minecraft on high settings? And what monitor is best for playing Minecraft and club penguin? All advice is helpful :)
During the acoustics test, I only heard my loud ass H100i GTX lmao
what's that difference between custom water cooling and the ready made cooling kits like the ones that corsair provides for cooling CPUs and GPUs.
My PC would score ~200 on 3DMark Firestrike on 720p.......
Only two 980 tis in SLI? What a fockin' scrub. But in all seriousness, how the hell is this build so quiet? My room's ceiling fan is noisier 3:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS COMPUTER TALK ;_;
whats Cable?
I'm fairly new to PC gaming and I just bought a desktop with these specs: Processor & Memory: Intel® Core i7-6700 Processor 3.4GHz 16GB DDR4 2133MHz RAM Drives: 1TB 7200RPM SATA3 Hard Drive DVD-RW (Writes to DVD/CD) Operating System: Microsoft® Windows 10 (64-bit) Graphics & Video: 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 Graphics Communications: 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Audio: Integrated High Definition 7.1 Channel Audio Processing Keyboard & Mouse: USB Keyboard USB Mouse Expandability (Total Slots): 2x 5.25" External 1x 3.5" External 3x 3.5" Internal 2X 2.5" Internal 1x PCI-E x16 1x PCI-E x1 2x DIMM 288-pin Ports & Slots: 1x PS/2 Style 4x USB 3.0 4x USB 2.0 1x LAN Port 3x Audio Jacks Additional Information: Power Supply: 600W Dimensions : 19.9” x 8.2” x 18.5” Do you recommend upgrading anything?
Tacos
Wait, isn't bottle necking at this top end PC level due to the poor software utilisation of the hardware? I have heard some games run shit on 4k even if you have 4x titans in SLI. - none of the games he tested if any for that matter are designed with 4k in mind. Probably has something to do with '3d effects' scaling differently relative to the increase in resolution too.
How come his define r5 has a much larger window than the usual window?
Water cooling is a damn waste of money ! Just pick up a Noctua NH-D15
All I heard during the audio sample was my computer fan and cpu whizzing...
Do you sellf this? LOL
My rig: GPU: GTX 970 FTW CPU: Intel Core i5 6600k (Overclocked to 4.5GHz) Motherboard: Asus Z170-A RAM: 8GB Kingston HyperX Fury DDR4 2133MHz Case: NZXT Phantom 240 CPU Cooler: Cooler Master TX3 EVO
what case it that?
what graphiccard do you think is needed to play on a 21/9 1440p monitor? right now i have a 144hz 1080 normal 16/9 monitor, but i really want one the Ultrawide monitors, so do thing i need a 980ti or two of those to play on it? i have a 980, so not a big deal for one 980ti, but two?...
Lol in 2369 we use organic matter to compute data. None of this ancient quantum computing or watercooled nonsense. And I'm here to tell you that we could have done it thousands of years ago too :/ Hell you could do it right now if you wanted to, all you need is a baking tray, horse urine, a dead rat and a box of lemons.
this is why ppl think pc gaming cost to much to get into. why would you need to spend 5000 on a computer. my $600 rig is amazing and is the strongest rig that anyone I know owns.
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Hodgie1231/saved/f8DG3C I was wondering if this is a good build for playing fallout 4,rainbow six siege,and bo3.
im happy to see that he didn't pick titan x 980 TI FTW!!!!!!!!
Yes to tacos, but even that won't make me cozy up to the Pepto-pink theme of this system. That said, the color is the only thing I don't love about this system. Design, components, everything, it looks really good, everything but the pepto... I also say that 4K is overrated, especially compared to 3440x1440 gaming on 34" curves. I know their prices are ridiculous, but so is the experience of gaming on that sweet mother of a monitor.
78 fps playable ahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahah i barely get 40fps in minecraft
what case is that?
If you have enough money to get a £5k PC, you could have got a better case xD
$5000 is 5K not 4K !!!
shes kinda really ugly for $5000
the start is how advertisement should be done!!!!!
Great vid bro plus 1 sub ... seriously nice hotline!great qualiy video!
Damn that hotline make me blink!
Whats the pump res combo model?
tacos? lol
So does this build do email!
I couldnt tell how quiet your PC was, because mine was being really loud... I hate california in the summer.
what case is that
It's fine.
can this play runescape 800x600 60fps max settings?
Now my GT 650M is insecure of itself :(.
WHATS THE POINT WHEN THEY BUILD GAMES ON XBOX/PS . all games still look like shit
Will that run Minecraft? or Terraria?
taco, taco
imyou have the best videos in computer entertainment you would probably tie with austin evans and linus and one question what degree do you have ??
does the define S window panel fit on an R5?
What has been your experience with the motherboard sabertooth so far? It is better than the "ASUS X99-PRO" or "ASUS RAMPAGE V EXTREME"?
Man, I'm addicted to your videos.
It's ok intel celeron 1.5ghz you can run lowest settings in 5ps in my heart
Can anyone recommend a good optical drive? I'm looking for a decent blu-ray player
TACOS
Lol I have a i5 3.50gHz
All i heard was my jet (HDD)
I am planning on getting a gaming rig, can anyone tell me if this will be fine? CPU:i5 6600k; GPU:Gigabyte G1 GTX980Ti; CPU Cooler:Cooler master 212 Evo; Motherboard:Gigabyte GA H110-A;  PSU:Aprevia ATX 700W; RAM:G.Skill 16GB(2x8) 2133 MHz DDR4; Case:Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ITX
`tacos
You have a problem with sequence of tubing. I don't know how is your sequence is? But as I see you feed CPU with a hot water because water that come out from GPU is hot. thats why you have 98 degree at 4.4GHz of CPU. So what you should to do change sequence Reservoir-> Radiator -> GPU --> Radiator --> CPU --> Reservoir I like color that you choose it is very nice and you choose very good hardware finally good job.
I wanna kill myself my graphics card is amd radeon 5450....
Whats the pump/res combo? Thanks :D
But can it run Club Penguin?
someone tell me please the pc case model
Tacos
A LinusTechTips shirt?
Im drooling all aver the place because im in my note 3
The guy at the beginning had a linus t shirt
MSI GTX 970 Gaming, 4GB GDDR5 or Gigabyte GTX 970 Gaming, 4GB GDDR5 wich is better???????
can you make one in $3000
LOL! This PC is way too expensive. I am building a machine using GTX 980 Ti 2-way SLI and really it's only 2720$ for a watercooled version
What are the advantages of playing at 4K?
"Run Minecraft and Roblox on it" - Some 10 year old probably
I overclocked my MSI GTX 980 Gaming 4G to +190 on the Core Clock and +550 on the Memory Clock with the stock MSI cooler. Never goes above 75 Celsius. Is this a good overclock? (fan speed on 55%)
A gép gyönyöru lett, és az eredmények?! Nem semmi. Szép munka!
A gép gyönyöru lett, és az eredmények?! Nem semmi. Szép munka!
i couldn't hear your computer over the sound of my computer
Dude was tryna Netflix and chill lowkey
IT'S SO BEAUTIFULLL
What case is he using ?
It's pink.
GTA V 80 fps with 2 980 ti? My ass!!! 50-70 Average maxed out!
At first I thought it was overkill due to the fact PCs way less could max out games then I looked at the part list and realized why .... The water cooling and the kind of storage he used .
Chuck Norris plays Crysis 4 at 8k 144fps with the integrated graphics of an intel 8080 8-bit CPU. One might ask, "Where is the integrated GPU on that 80s processor?" to which I reply, "Chuck Norris found it."
tacos
Tacos lol
Thats a gay computer.
Ill take jays 3 titans for 1000$ more
As crazy as it seems, I can't help but thinking that building crazy PC's is still a very affordable hobby. For $4000 you can pretty much get the fastest PC around. Yet a decent college degree cost $20000 per SEMESTER. All of a sudden, buying a gaming PC, let alone a console, seems like candy.
I vote tacos
its funny how his videos get more views than subscribers on his channel each time
no avg fps. nice.
Lol. GT640 masterrace you fucking pigeons.
Can it run minesweeper at 4k ultra settings?
is gt730 is good for playing dota2 guys? does it have a high fps?
I like LinusTechTips better XD [just joking]
I heard my fathers desktop over that really loud pc
i have a 4k pc and i have 235fps on gta 5 ultra
It plays hotline bling a max
Can this computer run Minecraft at far rendering distance
LTT  T-shirt
Yes tacos
just want to ask, how do u earn that much money
What's with the LinusTechTips shirt that that guy was wearing in the beginning
My car is not worth $5,000 and I depend on it everyday...fuck i'm poor.
Could you show the price list?
Pascal should get us over 60fps@4k for most games... Volta will make 4k the new 1080p and bring us closer to 8k gaming...
wouldn't Just cause 3 be more demanding ?
lol for the sound test all I could hear was my own computer
A question...where would the money go on a $5000 build that was focused only on 1080p gaming?
what's the case called?
0:49 dat arm jiggle do
MAD TINGGGG
Just curious on what brand those dual monitors are and which 4k monitor you are using if neither of those 2 are 4k. Another great video as always. Really enjoy your channel
what kind of case is that?
PInk??? Ok then......¯\(?)/¯
What about CS:GO?
Hawt.
What Case Is That?
Would I be able to have a setup like this (including the water cooling) in an NZXT H440.
can u give me the aftermath of dota 2 ?
Imma just say this real quick.. I FREAKIN LOVE THIS CHANNEL! (mic drop)
Damn nice
Tacos?????
are you gay?
how do you get that ES chip?
Awesome Video Awesome Build
4K: AMD Radeon something x2 8 GB VDDR5 RAM each, and cooling and skylake cpu. Nothing else.
while watching the sound test using my headphones, my own pc was way louder
TACOOOOOOS
Yeah yeah, but it can run Hotline Miami? LOL
I vote yes for tacos
idk what it is about this guy but he makes me laugh every video he seems like a very chill person. thats all i have to say
I want it.
if anyone is wondering, i think the case is a NZXT S340
dude did u actually pay 5000? or r u just assuming the cost. thats a ridiculous price for the performance boost you're getting. im running an r9 390x on an i7 4790 with 32gb of cas 8 ddr3 1600 a cpl ssd's and a 3tb bare drive and get close to the performance you get. and i probably payed about 650, 700 max to build it. i get probably like a 10 frame difference from your rig. and thats with aa on and ultra settings. just sayin.
Real men don't feel the need to use pink coolant.
The fact that a $5000 PC can't even manage to surmount the FPS dips in GTAV really says something about the quality of the port.
Hello, wat for Fitting do you use for the PETG. you wrote only the Flex tube fittings down i dont think so they working for the PETG aswell.. iam searching this fittings but can not find.
LTT SHIRT!!!
Thumbs up, because tacos.
can I have it please?
5960k bottlenecking ur gpus?!?! holy crap
Intel sucks ass.
ummm... tacos! wait what???
Tattoo ,
can it run dayz though?
To pink uaghhhhh so ugly
No buy intel for gaming buy amd is very best for gaming. Amd is very best processor on time very fast very speed very power full buy now you best cpu just do it !
My dad can get CPUs for free so what is better for gaming 6700k or 5960xeveryone says differently
what's the best gpu for $200
4:12 you misspelled tessellation.
Rofl he has gauges.
you earned my subscription through tacos lmao
Damn beastly PC.
Awesome build but red/black would've given a better look pink seems a bit too bright
What case is that?
but can it run minesweeper
Its so pretty, i wanted a pink n black color scheme to but I had to get an rog board soooooo.....I cry, sick bends
5k pc? And mine was 2k and has better parts than yours ?
tacos
But will it play minesweeper at 240p lowest settings?
are you can smells it my 9400gt is geting toast
.
0:49 jiggle those wings
can anyone tell me the parts that he is used in the watercooled system ? all of them
$5,000..............
i thought i was doing good with my new 970, and my custom built $1300 computer...
The script and actor playing at the beginning ad reminds me one of those cheap porn movies
bling
Im suprised nobody commented to the Taco? Tacos? Yes please!
WHAT CASE IS THAT?
damn if that pc was green themed i would fall in love with it
what case is that?
KYle could you please list the amount of each fitting
I prefer to be ignorant and play everything at 1080p, what you dont know .. you dont miss.
GTA 5 is an amazing PC port
can this run minecraft at 144p 3 fps ?
guys i have one question on the game debate i checked for the cs:go for my specs and it says i can play on ultra at 30 fps wtf and when i had cs:go on med i had 30 fps with dropping of 3 to 4 ans specs are down motherboard:ASUS A58M-K gpu inetagetd:r5 7400k cpu is:AMD A6 X2 7400K black edition wich i have no clue what that means and memroy 4gb wich 2.97 is free now please help me guys
I built a 12000$ gaming pc..... Where I got the money? I got a small loan of a million dollars...
id rather buy a motorcycle with 5000 much more fun than a overpriced computer for browsing porn and facebook
Where does he get his money? Just his job?
the ltt shirt tho
Can anybody tell me the perfect build that can run csgo and tf2 at least 60 fps on mid-high settings?
But if you run two titan Z in SLI, and two 5960x it should easily crush crysis 3 right? RIGHT?
oh crap i just realized i wasnt subscribed. all this time ive been watching your videos because they were just showing up in my recommendation tab. let me go subscribe right quick
What case is that?
The benchmarks were pretty surprising to me. Even with 1 980ti and an i7 4790k with no overclocking, I was getting similar framerates in 1080p in Metro Last Light. But with 2x SSAA...
pascal cards will bring 4k to the forefront.
totally unnecessary to have to spend $5000 .if u have the money go for it.. you can still do perfectly fine with a less expensive pc
Gonna guess it was based off of Hotline Miami??
its a pretty cool pc but 1 quistion of all the colours you could pick why pink?
did anyone else sing hotline bling when he said "hotline"?
That pink is absurd lol, yuck. I don't know how this thing is $5,000 as the pc build in my about section of my profile came out to around $1,400 and runs games very well at 1080p. If you are a 4k snob then yeah that's a major point to make for this build, but I'm not. Was a cool video if not entirely unnecessary and unrealistic. Always neat to see expensive pc builds as someone who loves gaming rigs and pc gaming.
Does anyone know what tower case he has on this build
IMHO, definitely chimichangas!!
why did the console gamer cross the road? to render the building on the other side.
Is there space for a 120mm radiator at the back with this setup?
fps 120over and laptop spoil?
Hey Kyle how is the overclocking on the Sabertooth board? you should post an overclocking guide !!! Oh and what is your opinion on the oc tuner function in the sabertooth board

So I might be building a computer here soon. Is Windows 8 compatible with most games people play? (mainly focused on csgo) plus i been shopping around literally all of the computers have windows 8 or 10 so i might just go to the pc shop and have them help me build one
If you like games an like to watch other ppl play please view n follow my Twitch i do a bunch of steam give aways an more to all my viewers add me http://www.twitch.tv/reeeebzz im on an streaming daily an play a bunch of games Thank you!
This is the first time my 690 has felt underpowered.
Powered by Pepto-bismol?
I wanna go and cry in a corner. I don't even have a 500$ Gaming Pc, if you could even say that it would be a gaming one. :( My laptop sucks.
Yes tacos!
A single NVIDIA PASCAL will be enough for 4k AND that day is coming soon AND the 980ti SLI will be forgotten
TACOS!
TACO!
the only thing i could hear in the sound test was my own pc lmao
Yay, Tacos!
ps4 way better
I have got the asus R9 270 2gb, I am gonna buy the msi gtx 970 4gb, Is that good enough for playing games with high settings 40+ fps?
lol I couldn't hear your pc noise over my pc
Welfare intensifies
why is there a huge drop from average to minimum fps on gta v?
where do you get the costom cables from i wanna get some
that is the box model???
tacos
#overkill
if you spent 5k it should be hotline 5k??
Whats the name of the pc case
Ok know what? Everybody here listen we are trying to make pc's better to handle games right? Why don't we just make the games handle the pc's better? Taaaadaaaa
Great pc! One problem though, who the ** has 5,000 dollars!
#HotlineBling
every good PC who can get any game on 4k with 60 avg fps that is ok for me. For me ppl should not spend to much money just to have PC who cost like this one 5k LOL
dang, i cant even my antivirus without it slowing down (i dont even have a good enough video card and or graphics card to run minecraft) (pc model is the dell optiplex 360)
I've been wanting to get 2 monitors and a gaming desktop, but I'm 14 and a girl, so my dad thinks it's so horribly wrong that I love gaming =.= he's into building stuff though, so maybe if I ask him to help me build a desk top.. he would be alittle more ok with it x.x I really want to build one v.v
can it run CS:GO at 60 fps..... :D
Computer Specifications -PROCESSOR AMD Phenom II X6 1055T -MOTHERBOARD ASUS M4A89GTD -MEMORY 4GB (2x2GB) G.SKILL+2GB CORSAIR DDR3 -CASE BLACK COOLER MASTER -POWER SUPPLY COOLER MASTER 500W -GRAPHIC CARD GTX 560TI 1GB GDDR5 -Hard DRIVE WD 500GB SATA -OPTICAL DRIVE DVD-CD/RW -PCI WIFI INTERNET im a pc noob could this run b03 and gta v if so at what setting and fps
seriously, no one comments on the fact that it's pink?!!!!!
Yeah my monitor is the Asus PG278Q. Definitely worth it wow.
My pc on minecraft makes 30fps so bad OMG
what GPU waterblock is that?
does it bling tho?
@FlameHead490 yeah at 720p. And when we say "it can tun at ultra" means it never goes below 60Fps
@khalid alhussein yes. I think the hotlne mght win.
@Backyzoo its because most of those games can only use 4cores. So in that case. A i7 4790K or 6700K would have been better
Holy shit
A 5960X is bottlenecked by 980 Ti SLI??? I'd think a processor of that tier wouldn't even come close to ever being bottle necked...
Can anyone recommend me a 1080p monitor for a budget of £100 - £120 please (with a hdmi port)? <3
Hey can u make me a amazing gaming ps pls and hit me up and we can talk
skunk works vs hotline! anyone want that?
Hotline Bling
And then a Car enter Your house And destroy It,although It saved your life (It really happened to someone)
You should build another PC and name it Bling. Then you can put the two PCs next to each other so it would be Hotline Bling.
6:37 is that a camera lens?
YES! I got the same case
Hey, It looks like you used acrylic tubing but the fittings you linked are for soft tubing. Is that correct?
Paid 700$ for parts, runs games at ultra just fine
Gay color, gay earnings, gay hipster glasses, gay voice, this planet lost a real type of MAN..... But damn bro goooooood PC!!
a pc for drake...hotline bling
heh I just built a pc with 4 980ti's :|
lol and i still have a gtx 645... ;-; help me
I like tacos.
I KNOW WHEN THAT HOTLINE BLING!
5000$ for a PC... damn... i'm jelly....
yeah, but can it run minesweeper?
Your mannerisms are extremely annoying. I couldn't finish the video.
BRO I COULD HEAR MY PC OVER YOUR PC
liquid cooling costs more than air cooling?
it can only mean one thing
What is the case?
taco plz ?
what gtx 980ti on brasil is r$ 5000 on usa is 1250$
1:43
LOL! I love A Christmas Carol!
I wish you would have shown some in game gameplay
why pink?
The pink pipes look whack, but otherwise that's some piece of work!
but can it run minesweeper?
You like the hotline miami too? Sneak a litlte herb in some night and play that game... Itll rape your mind.
That thing is insane!!
LOL i was trying to listen to the idle sounds and all i could hear was my computer
LOL what a peasant, my boy JayzTwoCents has 3 Titan X's and a 5960x even more overclocked.
Next gen should be promising for 1440, with AMD's new memory and Nvida always has something cooking up. Two generations and I think everyone will be on 1440-4k within 5 years.
tacos?
What case is that again?
When Pascal GPUs come out they will shit on the 980ti. Sorry mate you wasted money on these gpus.
PINK! PINK! i like it!
dude why 16gb of ram with a 5960x! 64gb would have been nice!
How does one get sponsored for building rigs like this? I've built myself a similar rig with a CaseLabs SMA8 case, spent around $7,000 which I paid for completely with my own money, no sponsored parts. Sponsored parts would allow me to continue to modify and improve this system (upgrading the GTX980 classifieds to Titan X's would be superb).
you used to call me on my.... oh never mind
Why didn't you benchmark Minecraft?!?
Update: landfill
i feel like it won't be able to handle the newer games at 4k.. like ass creed syndicate and such.
what is that pump?
"Hotline" bling ?
Your idle temp are clearly wrong, it is not possible for your CPU temps to be running cooler than the rooms ambient temperature. So unless your house is sitting at 53 degree F then your temp readings are wrong. Your CPU temps were probably more accurately sitting around 20-24 Celsius (room temp)
ewww pink awful
That's the best looking pc I've EVER seen
Everything is nice... but dat pink doe...
A geek's porn
http://pcpartpicker.com/p/zhjRrH
Hello everyone, I am building a PC for the first time and I need some advice on it, is it good, bad, what can I improve and what do you recommend: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/zhjRrH
yes... tacos
i7 5960x ... cpu bottlenecking... how did i get here?
use nvidia titan x and GTX 980TI
Anyone know where i can get those led's lined along the side panel from?
Galaxy http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/XBdqCJ Galaxy V2 http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/yxjGpg These are 2 builds I made on pc part picker. They are my first builds and was wondering if their any good or if their complete crap, idk what's good and what's bad so any constructive criticism will be helpful thanks.
In the sound test, the only thing I heard was the sound of my HP Pavilion Slimline :)
Fractal gang?
That is beautiful.
He predicted hotline bling
Add more leds, doesn't have enough bling
4K is quite affordable already... My single R9 290 runs Dirt Rally on high settings at 4K.
@Awesomesauce Network Congrats to this nice project. Maybe I missed it somehow but is this the regular window panel or did you make it yourself? What PSU did you use? Thanks and keep on rockin'
Looks freakkking amazing....
that awkward moment when the only thing i could hear at 2:30 was my own computer sounding like a fighter jet taking off
Im sorta new to the building scene and this is what i have come up with... Case: NZXT H440 HDD: WD Red 2TB GPU: GTX 970 Power Supply: Corsair RM750X RAM: Hyper X Fury White 16GB DDR3 Motherboard: MSI Z97A CPU: Intel i7-4790 Quad Core Cooling: Corsair Hydro Series H105 Liquid CPU Cooler Is This a good rig? Can it handle The Witcher 3 maxed out or Skyrim with graphics mods at 60+ FPS?
Yeah. Tacos.
dude just wait till like spring 2016.. this pc will be obsolete via whatever the next gpu that comes out, it will have more power than this whole pc... hope you were sponsored.
"DYES" = Failure waiting to happen....
Only thing I heard from the fans were mine.
4K is still 2-3 years away from being affordable.
taco for sure.
Tacos.
What case is he using in this video? I looked in the description and clicked on the parts list but the case wasn't listed...
how does one upgrade there custom water pc ?

Amusing channel
I would by another car...
I just spent $5000 on this PC and tried Minecraft. It was horrendous, about 10 pixels every screen, sometimes even less. Disappointed.
Am I too late for the giveaway?
But the question is...can it run minesweeper?
i know when that "Hotline" bling, that can only mean one thing....
Drake: "I know when that hotline bling" Kyle: "My hotline doesn't bling I makes no bling no noise so shut the fu*k up drake"
Hitman runs faster on 1440p than 1080pHow does that work? :L
If I ran fire strike on my computer it would implode
great pc man
I know when that hotline bling
Definitely tacos
Can this run Mario Bros at low setting?
TACOS!!

I KNOW WHEN THAT HOTLINE BLING!!!!
hotline bling
Cen i pley maincraft on dis?
I couldn't hear it over my laptop.
And i know when that hotline bling That can only mean one thing
The Kool Aid man really threw me off.
For $5,000 this thing should do better than "incredibly pleased with results." For that kind of cash you should be saying something like "Holy Sh!t I can't believe how amazing this is!"
What do you do for work
Can it run minecraft at the lowest settings
wallaper link?
hot line bling
But can it run minesweeper?
When Pascal comes out next year two of those cards in SLI should take care of Crysis 3 as well as Metro 2033 at 4K.
my pc is mfuing' better. YESSSSS
ROG Swift PG27AQ or ROG Swift PG279Q please.
Where is the DVD-ROM DRIVE?
Pink color scheme?? That's just a little odd for a guy.
at this point, i am down for a ps4, wii u and new guitar. $5000 is overkill
makes a 5k pc goes with pink
meh my pc better
good luck maintaing that liquid Rig!
Tacos? :D
Hotline bling...
But does your Hotline bling? That could only mean one thing....
my pc runs crysis 3 at 1,000 fps at 5k.
My 5930k also feels some bottlenecking from the 2x 980Ti's :(. even bottlenecking on the 5960X is just rediculous lol... Custom watercooling for me is more of a hobby and keeping all my components cool and the overall system whisper quiet is just another bonus it provides :D.
Does it bling?
Drake would be so proud
That Hotline is really Blinging
damn that computer the hotline got some bling and that can only mean one thing
and i know when that HOTLINE BLING!
Man I really wanna see a 4k sli titan or 980 ti build with an even higher end processor than the 5960x

And i will not be able to play even tf2 on my pc. I have no graphic card/s and i have intel pentium 4 :(((( im 14 years old. I will never ever even get new graphic card Ps: my father is computer tech guy
Tacos.
What Pump and Res Combo is that?
When listening for the Fans, i heard my brother Fap in his room. across the floor. through 2 doors. he either has a big problem or this pc doesnt even have any fans.
I don't think, people would spend so much on a pc. Most of them wouldn't!
You should go triple 980ti's
Taco.
as the price of 4k monitors drop over the next 2 years 4k gaming will become much more popular
hey guys, is the corsair rm750i enough for a 2 way sli 980 ti ?
hotline bling
my poor 660 gtx - still doing well though :D wonder if an upgrade is really needed??
When he says grab so popcorn and you actually have popcorn :3
I imagine this rig would load my Heroes of might and magic 3 WOG XXL random map real fast!
The noise I heard during sound test was my 960 (STRIX) If you wanted to know
get you buy me a new 650w c corsair psu. couse i have no money and need one realy bad :D it was worth a shot right/ :D
tacos!!
Why is it pink?
I know when that Hotline bling!!!!!!
I thought that was jayztwocents who broke into your house at the beginning of the video
4 Titan X's and spend the rest of the $1,000 on cpu
Damn. Hotline Bling.
My PC is waaaayyyy slower than it was when I first got it 6 years ago (playing the same games and doing all the same things) what's caused it to slow up? How can I gain some speed back?
can you please send me 1 of those computer <3 its my dream computer instead of titans make it 980ti <3
awesomesauce honestly thats my favorite PC on earth not only the specs that's perfect for me its the black/pink/grey color combination it's my favorite colors mostly black and pink :D
Lolz.. Fractal Josh wearing a WAN show shirt in the Fractal commercial at the beginning...
You used to call me in my "hotline" bling...
i have some money to spend and i am doing the same thing , i mean everything the same apart from the colorous, i am only afraid of fucking up the bend with the tubs
hotline? as in Hotline Miami?
+johann
does this have any mechanical drives?
should get 4 256gb SSD's and run them in raid, your SSD speed may be the bottle neck too
i bet my life i can get the same performace for 1k less or even more you just dumb asf
the ender dragon is a pc gamer.
Can this run minecraft at perhaps 25fps?
1440p 144hz is the best gaming.. Sure, there's 4k 60hz gaming, but it gets a little choppy and I'd prefer a higher refresh rate..  I'm sure once 4k screens hit 120-144hz and the gtx 1280 ti comes along, 4k will be there(at a very flashy price point)
OMG awesomesauce i love that pc black and pink is the stufff dood.
what about 720p?
Why did you choose Haswell-E over a Skylake??
Case?
Such a badass PC. Really digging the colors a lot. Wish I would've seen this before I started my build. I went with the typical red/black color scheme with a hint of gold lol
+Awesomesauce Network Can you give a count on the fittings you used? Some of them are actually quite hard to decipher based on your video work.
all I can afford in this video are those nachos :'D
Turnips
Hey is this a good build?? Would it get to hot? Do I need a cooler? And any other advice would be awesome, it's my first build so i don't know to much. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/QG6tGX
SELLOUT
I can't wait for 4k movies.
is that case the fractal define S?
everything I have ever owned doesn't even account for fraction of the price of that...that thing
How much out of the $5K is allocated for the custom watercooling? b/c the 2x980TI is about $1k each here in Canada. Do you think it would perform similar with an AIO ?
Checkout and subscribe to my channel. Thanks
Checkout and subscribe to my channel. Thanks.
My mate mixed universal indicator, indigo carmine and something else (I'm not too sure) and his water cooling is rainbow. Actually
That thing is pure sex.
Can it run csgo? xDDDDD
why do we people keep looking at stuff that we will never afford?
dude i just heared my own pc when you were showing the noise levels
2017 will be the year of the 4k. It's just gonna take another 2 years for people to upgrade their setups for 4k.
i didnt saw how many gtx 980ti were there? 2 or 3 ?
I own this Fractal Design case. One of the most elegant and beautiful (and though-out) towers out there.
How you get those power cables to be so clean inside case?! Do you use some holds?
i think i just came xD
still too much $ for the dawm 4k. I will stick with my 2k config. for the moment which is more than fine, and upgrade to full 4k in a year or so...
Which led strips did you get?
Hotline blinggggg
People buy a car for 5000$ :O
how much fps do you get in CSGO? hahaha
Tacos? Tacos.
This PC can run Ark and Battlefield 4? Motherboard – MSI Socket AM3+/AMD 760G/DDR3  Graphic Card – Club 3D R9 270  Processor – AMD FX-6300 6-Core Processor Black Edition  RAM – Crucial 8GB Single DDR3  Hard Disk – Seagate 1TB Desktop HDD SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache  CD Drive – Samsung SATA 1.5 Gb-s Optical Drive  Power Supply –EVGA 500W
okay i need to get this straight... 1440p,60hz and 4ms or 144hz and 1ms at 1080p
I love my 750ti it's been giving solid fps at great settings for over a year now!;)
How are you able to overclock your memory with the new drivers? I have 2 GTX 980s in SLI, but for some reason, neither MSI Afterburner nor EVGA PrecisionX can overclock the memory. I click apply, and the number reverts to zero. This happens on both 355.82 and 355.98.

what is the case name?
That PC used to call me on my cell phone
Why do I watch videos of things i could never have....
+ Awesomesauce Network how are your fans configured? From my angle view I can only see 3 fans on top of the case all exhausting airflow, wouldn't that create a negative air pressure and be detrimental for your built causing dust to be taken in from everywhere you don't want compensating the negative air pressure?
The backplate u used for 980 Ti is from Titan X?
what leds did you use?
s this build good? If not please tell me what to change Intel Core i5-4460 with Cooler - MSI B85M-P33-V3 Motherboard - 8GB 1600Mhz hyperX Fury DDR3 (1x8GB) - Geforce GTX960 GPU 2GB GDDR5 - Seagate 1TB 7200RPM - Enermax Fulmo. Q - 2x 120mm - with 500W Enermax NAXN Power Supply Show less
why no hotline miami benchmark?
Most all of these best video games could get better to incredible benchmarks if they optimized them better, but they're in kahoots with the video card makers, they get a kickback, this is just like viruses with the anti-virus companies! Did you know they sell your information? Here's just one, http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/19/avg-privacy-policy-update/ These anti-virus companies not only sell your information, they create a ton of viruses, consider it job security! Microsoft should be able to fix its own software and it can, but this would put third party software vendors out of business so Microsoft allows them to do it for the kickback and this is only a couple things, it's truly never ending
of course it's worth it. Who needs cooling, it looks sexy af
But can it run Minecraft..?
cool. I'm working on my first water cooled PC as well. It's called the imperius
Which Reservoir is that ?
19ºC? Were you on the freezer?
I wish I could start building and repairing computers as a job right away, but the only problem I have with it is still needing to go to school. I love working with computers and always manage to miraculously solve a problem if I put my mind to it strongly enough (which I do), but even in this small little town few people ever actually try to repair their computers let alone their cars that they drive around. With a car, after regular maintenance they only fix it if it breaks, or toss it and look for another if it's been too banged up by then. With a computer, though, they don't even try to actually fix it often times. They just keep using it until it quits, and then they take it directly to Sarcan and buy a new one. I saved one of these Sarcan machines that was being tossed, and I am typing on it right now...this Dell Latitude D530 looked brand new and even had a CD/DVD burner and everything. I asked them if they were going to toss it and they said yes. I asked to look at it and he let me...the computer was just lacking a hard drive. I paid him $20 for it, and now so many years down the road it's rocking an 80 GB SSD and EASILY keeping with $300, sometimes $400 laptops. The total cost of this machine was $120 including the used SSD I replaced the hard drive with.

Does anyone know what kind of case Kyle used? The window panel looks sick.
Do you sell pc ?
ITS SO PRETTY!
What pc case is that
For people that are saying custom water cooled PC's are not worth it, let me point a few things out to you. Yes it is very expensive BUT! I don't hear a leaf blower next to me when I game (Sometimes 2 leaf blowers in Sync) Very Pleasing to the eye Water pumps which Can be turned all the way down and be silent PWN. (Unable to get this on AIO's) The ability to set your fan curves on practically the lowest RPM possible, even Idling fans of you have enough Radiator for passive cooling Highly Over-clockable CPU and GPU and still remain stable A feeling that you have accomplished something which not many people can do (master race) The ability to add more components to your loop if Radiator space suffices. I was running air for years till I discovered water cooling in 2006. I will never go back.
I love every computer tech channel makes there own pcs!
that's overpriced
!TACCOS
Why not benchmark witcher 3?....
But can it run minecraft at 240p???
am i the only one that noticed the cpu is an engineering sample? why use an ES cpu?
I self would use a i5 4690k and a gtx 970 just to play GTA V and Battlefield 4 at 1080p or 1440p at ultra settings... but still a nice video
waste of money. spend 1500$ and save the rest.
Awesome build i like the pink too
+1 if you noticed the linus tech tips shirt
c?u hình oc và gaming th?
Shoulda called it the Pepto Bismol machine
what is the case?
If build mostly for gaming (no video rendering) that coice of CPU is retarded. No Game can make use of so many cores, The 6700k would have been much cheaper and probably would have bottlenecked you less due to its much higher speed. (and still have 8 threads for the average Prosumer production)
this is so awesomme
I still don't see the bennefit from custom water loops, A closed loop h100 or whatever for about 400 dollars less and maybe a 5degree difference seems more reasonable. If u got the money tho u good.
and you still a noob at gaming seems legit
+Awesomesauce Network , At 4:39 , 1080, 1440, 4K are the monitor resolutions?
What's the case ???
I just got a computer that I build for 500$. Max settings on WAW 60fps without even going into overclock
Nah don't show any game play, that would be ridiculous!
Nah don't show any game play, that would be ridiculous!
sorry but the venturi fans are loud ! ive had 3 of them in my system for my main coolstream pe 360 rad ! fuckin loud and vibrating ! changed the fans for my old af 120 from corsair and more quiet no vibration and better cooling !
There's no mention of the pump res combo. Ek right?
Will a i5 4690 be enough to handle the awesomeness of 1 989 ti in my new pc ?
very nice setup! i also have a FD Define S case, the PC is wc-ed too and my 4690K is at 4.7GHz with 1.37v and the max temp, after 2 hrs of Mad Max, hit 73 Celsius. is this ok? compared to you, my temp is pretty high. thank you
What is the outro song?
390x or 980?
Arma 3
My dream build http://pcpartpicker.com/p/JP9sNG My current build (Note, I didn't pay the price listed, that's just what it would cost today. I paid about half of that.) http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2gpDRB
"bottlenecking" a 5960x? wat
wow! Cool!!
Water remains the same temp throughout the entire loop... The top card is warmer because it is the work horse compared to it's sli linked companion below. Facts.
It would be sad if someone built this and only played games at 1080p. :( I know there are some who would.
Great... now I want tacos
hitman absolution lmfao... thats a 2012 example... please use games from 2013 and up preferably 2015 and up seeing how this needs to run smooth 4k with games coming up, and not 3 year old games

Hey Awesomesauce i was wondering,are you intrested on trading my Yu-gi-oh super duper original version and a couple of pokemon cards for this?If you dont like those i have an old gameboy wich worths billions now,I mean i give you tresure here mate so think about it
can you pleas check your Facebook
Beautiful build and badass performance!!
damn the build looks cool despite having pink stuff in it
What if I just use fans instead of water cooling is that fine
Since games are really bad at utilizing multiple cores, a highly overclocked i7-6700k may give you better results, with its better single core performance.
where is the build log for this?
Your temps are quite high. More rad space required. But the hard line loop looks great!
Why do you have 3.0Ghz processor in a 5,000 dollar gaming pc ( my computer has 4.2ghz Overclocked and i bought it for £319)
hey its me ur brother
why did you use airflow fans on those radiators?
#TACOS!
"a whole degree colder than Ebenezer Scrooge" lmfao xD
is this quad 980 ti or two cards
when i first started pc gaming, i was all for the best low cost builds. now its just big dick syndrome
What's it's FPS with minecraft?
Love how he puts much more effort in promoting his sponsors by doing a short.
This is so gayming..
its, its beautiful :o
i couldnt hear your computer over my computer
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE POWER BUTTON ISNT PURPLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I just got back from the store , I could have had homemade TACOS tonight! What a great job you did; especially if it's your first hardline build. I hate pink, but that takes absolutely nothing away from your attention to detail and great execution here. Serious props. Awesome saucy job, Kyle.
Hey I'm a noob in computer how does water cooler work ?
My Xbox has better specs then this and only cost 350. What a waste of 5 grand
My Xbox has better specs then this and only cost 350. What a waste of 5 grand
very nice video on 980ti sli, I can only dream of having such a system
Can this PC run Minecraft?
I got question to you, what are you thinking about i5-4690k + G1 Sniper z97 + GTX 960. Am i going to play all the new games in at least 60 FPS in FHD?
4K gaming is the most retarded shit ever
I just want to say: What a sexy pc!
5000 with 60 year old hard drive tech ?  LOL
The  benefits come from the 980 Ti  ... not from the water cooling.  And your premise that water cooling is expensive is also wrong.  The answer to your question is your machine would have been better without the water and a modern hard drive because a digital drive makes a big difference and the water almost none.  Don't believe me ?  Disconnect it and you will see the fps is still above the hertz of the 4K screen.  Any fps over the hertz of the screen = 0
i didnt no my pc was so lound till i was tryn to hear yours
Can it run Minecraft?
I couldn't hear the sound test over my computers fans :P
This video has "4k likes" atm. lol
Awesome videos love your builds !!
Hey, should i get the r9 390 8gb vram or gtx 970 4gb vram. Please no fanboyism here. http://pcpartpicker.com/p/DZM9mG
0:19
woo purple pc's are the best
damn, being a youtuber makes you enough money for a 5000 dollar PC, pay mortgage for your nice looking suburb house, and a beautiful wife?! geeze i need to switch my job...
All I can think of is Vice City when looking at this, gorgeous.
What case is that?
fuck man i still have to play my games a 480p
dat moment when a 5960x is bottlenecking your GPUs,LOL.
YES YES YES YES YES!! That's all I can say. :p
thank you for using degrees Celsius and not °F
tacos
Tacos indeed
One mistake tho, 1080p = 2k. But such a "hot" rig :)
Meanwhile I'm enjoying my HD 4670 running old games at 720p 30fps low settings.
I love tacos
gtx 950 will be awesome of those kids on budgets or regular home PC's
can you guys please sub to my channel
The CPU is a beast but couldn't handle 2 980ti's ? Is this even real ?
http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/V4Ys4D very Good build
Awesome looking build - nice work!
Brilliant machine love it ! And hats off for the build :) If you have the money and the enthusiasm, It's a great hobby. But if you are doing it just to try get the best out of games and getting skint about it, That's where people are going wrong because the actual difference in gaming performance between a 5000 bux liquid cooled X99 system and a fan cooled z97 system (with the highest cpu for each) Is never worth hitting the breadline for lol
Water cooling is justified by the cool factor alone........the performance is just icing on the cake!
Still cant buy the node 202
great midrange gaming pc i5 http://www.ebay.com/itm/Gaming-Computer-Gtx-660-t-i-i5-2400k-8gb-ram-1tb-hdd-Windows-8-/111764287995?hash=item1a05abb1fb
IDLE: hears his own computer LOAD: hears his own computer
I'm going with tacos.
Loll why the hell would you spend 5000 dollars on a gaming pc just get a console which is cheap and it's easier cause of the controller
nice system but you should get more ram since youre video editing
Tacos!
holy shit what a tank pc
Hi kyle, I checked your amazon and list and i couldnt find the case you were using. Im probably super dumb but is it the fractal design r5?
I think he got the name hotline from drakes song hotline bling
You want us to leave our thots in the comments?
I want to have sex with your computer, its so fucking beautiful.
Hey everyone. I'm just getting into PC gaming and have a question. Are the specs listed below adequate to play games like Arma 3 and Rust on at least medium settings. Eventually I plan on upgrading graphics card and power supply. Thanks in advance! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intel® Core i7-4790 Processor 3.6GHz 16GB DDR3 RAM 1TB 7200RPM SATA3 Hard Drive Microsoft® Windows 10 (64-bit) 1GB NVIDIA GeForce GT 720 Graphics Integrated High Definition 7.1 Channel Audio Processing Power Supply: 350W
They are actually 5k benchmarks. Lel
They are actually 5k benchmarks. Lel
They are actually 5k benchmarks. Lel
Well my graphics card idles at under 30 degrees celsius and i have the stock cooler on it.
I say.... Tacos
Tacos?
Yes, Tacos.
TACOS
Stylistically, I really like it. Some of these games though, they must be pushing systems really hard, those FPS numbers were a li'l bit on the low side considering the hardware investment. Let's hope DX12 or Vulcan sort this out for us and you should have a real monster when those come online.
Tacos. Definitely tacos.
Ummm...why does it state above that the Fractal Design giveaway closes Sept. 10th, but when I follow the link the contest is ended and someone won already (it's Sept 6th as of this comment)?
Right so I just went on pc part picker and i did everything I needed to do like cpu,motherboard,ram and etc, I chose the graphics card listed and wanted to know if there is anything better I could choose, here is the link http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/ ,thanks in advance, you can change the cards if you edit the build.
That pink look is so sick!
That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! ROFL
hotline bling
Does it run HL3?
I can't belive that the 5960x, especially OCed, could ever bottleneck in GAMES...HOW??
I like to know where you can buy those venturi fans so I can get some, can't find them for sale anywhere?.
Fuck 4k. That shit's gay.
ASUS Motherboard? Lawl.
4K is garbage gimmick BS, only way you can benefit from 4k is if you're 1 foot from the screen or have an 80 inch tv!!!!!!!!!! Plus PC games are garbage now days. They either suck or are bad console ports.
What case is this I'm planing on building a water cooled pc :D soon
dislike, ugly build and pretty standard really. 5960x with 980ti in SLI, pffft.
a frickin 500$ ssd xD
This system look great, even if i'm not into pink/purple. Anyways you can always change the color of the liquid anytime. I don't think 4k will be available for most people under 1-1.5k $ before a few years. But its getting there! Now, i only have an Asus 770OC and i'm might need to upgrade when VR headsets hit the selves. But im sure not going to put 5k on a computer haha! Money is hard to get by in Quebec.
+1 for Tacos
The real question is can it run Minecraft ?
5+ grand to play video games!!!!! Madness.
So it says the giveaway closes on Sept. 10th, but it has already ended......
so you spend 5k on a gay pc that only gets 54 fps in cysis while my 2.5k rig runs crysis 3 at 7680x1080p at a constant 60fps. Fail sauce.
I can hear the prodigy at the back.
Tacos
The giveaway definitely closed prior to the 10th, or at least that is what the linked page says.
Hey what is your keyboard? Can you link me to it
Moded skyrim benchmark or I have No idea how powerful the system is!
Lol u should have custom mod your case' make it even cooler
Why does it say in the description that the contest closes the 10th, but the link says it has ended already?
Damn.. that's one quiet PC! Nice Job.
My laptop idle's at 90 degrees Celsius... yes I meant Celsius ;_; and your computer doesn't hit that at max...
How can anyone sit and listen to this nerd hipster douchebag talk.
tacos?
I mean I'm down for tacos if you are.
I can barely hear anything over my own PC.
im to late ;~;
mmm tacos.
...TACOS!!!
Tacos. Ofc tacos
Tacos rule!
burrito bowls
Damn max temps of the i7 hitted 98 degrees. Nice knowing that a watercooled cpu can get that hot.
That shit is nothing. My i3 and hd 4400 graphics gets 30 fps in csgo at low settings.
this might be a dump question, but wount he get condensation on his parst at sub room temp temps?
I know when that hotline bling
This is my dream PC.
Tacos sound good...... I'm gonna go get some now.
FINALLY! BENCHMARKS!
Hey guys. i am joining the pc mustard race and i wanted to ask u waht u think of this build http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/7prs4D
why no 240p benchmarks? afraid your pc wont run at 240p resolution?
Lmao tacos
Tacos.
Why so cheap?!
It's going to be another year or two before there is a single card solution to 4k/60fps gaming that is also affordable for all the capitalist peasants.
meawhile.. I have lag in cs:go
Hardtube is for hipsters and dudebros.
So, the competition says it is open until 9/10/15 but when you click on the link in your description it says the competition is now over....its currently 9/5/15.
The LTT T-Shirt
Hi Kyle, seems to me something is off with your temps - idle below 20°C. I thought you re living in California and not Antartica or did your AC cool down the room to chilly 10-15°C?
Congratulations on your beautiful build mate, it will serve you well! The force is strong in this one!
outro song? pls
You don't need 8 cores for a gaming pc
Ewwww everything is in series
HELP ! my old motherboard died and i cant boot off my new motherboard i put in ! how would i fix this ? i dont want to reinstall windows as i have spent alot on applcations that i can only download once (steam)
10 seconds on the givaway
All i heard when listening to the sound test was my load ass pc :(
4 way sli with 980 ti
nicest build ive seen
Tacos?
"Tacos?" IM DYING
U KNO WHEN DAT HOTLINE BLING ??
How do you feel about Maxwell architecture running like shit on DX12/(and presumably) Vulkan? You figure by the time DX12/Vulkan is relevant it'll be time to spend 5k again?
WOOWW....
Tacos
+AwesomesauceNetwork so i have a question, i was wondering what recording software you use for the benchmarking and also if you tutorials and if so, if you could do a tutorial on how to set up and use the recording software that you use. i am trying to start a youtube channel so i would appreciate some tips :)
I think giveaway ends in 6 hours, but he mistakenly took it in as days.
I've got a 5000$+(canadian) 4k gaming pc myself. it's quite an incredible experience! specs - 4790k 4.8 corsair h50 aio z97 asus maximus vii hero 16GB 1886 corsair dominator platinum 2 way SLI evga titanX Hybrids (can oc to 1502mhz) coolermaster 1000w (2) 240GB HyperX SSD raid 0 config 2 TB HDD Coolermaster HafX case acer 28 inch 4k Gsync monitor
Yes Tacos.
can you do the master case pro 5
$5k computer and no g-sync??? NCIX has a decent sale right now for $670 swift. You couldn't pry mine away from me and I just run it off a single 780 on water.
Kyle, you should make a bobble head Kyle to sell. Reason, your head moves around like a bobble head in your videos.
those are some toasty cpu cores.
that pc looks SICK IM CURRENTLY HAVING A NERD BONER!
WItcher 3?
can someone explain to me how a 5960x bottlenecks, this is the second video i'v seen with that being said and it scares me, i need explanation q-q
New intro?
Nice PC, well Built
tacos? no. no tacs. Turnips.
I just realized that I have the same desktop background as you! xD
i only heard my pc blowin at 2:55
14°C on the CPU?!?!?! How is that even possible? My i 7 4770 (non k) runs about 35°C in idel with my corsair h100i. I know aio Watercooling units arent nearly as good as custom loops but 14°C?!?
1-800-hotline bling
Josh should be in all your vids. Rebranding time! AwesomejosH NetworK ! See what I did there ? huh? Huh?
I heard my PC over yours in the sound test ;~;
lol all heard was my a/c
You lucky bitch. Much jealous, many money
i just cant understand why it takes youtube ppl days, weeks and months to do a build, when a mong like me can do it in a few hours haha
Me WantTaco's.... . Going to wait until pascal or Greenland to see that 4k is doable without dual gpu's #PcMasterRace, 900p/1080p console peasants.
That PC is sick the only one thing that sorta sucks is the case. (personnel preference I guess)
A $5000 PC is an indulgence I'd love to invest it :P
Yep that thing is a BEAST! looks "Awesome" too! ......aaand Tacos!
Could you do the benchmarks Jayztwocents did to see how they compare?
Hnnnngh so beautiful
I wish i had the money for custom WC :/
What kind of tubing did you end up using? acrylic or petg?
awesome
Another awesome build Sir! I can say with my hand on my heart that you are one of the only people on youtube whom I would trust to build me a system if I could not do it.
liked it for the pink lol
mhhh... Tacos
I heard something, I know it.
It's bootiful
I could only push my 980 ti to 1430 MHz :/ Jelly in ma belly
Tacos, for sure.
Crysis 3, the bane of every GPU made before 2018 lol.
Yes, this machine is 4K Battle ready!!!
crysis 3 is a very nice game
Tacos? I say yes.
I lost my shit when the kool-aid man came bustin through
wow its done! congrats!
no witcher 3, disapointed D:
Definitely tacos.
My GPU cries when she saw this
4K beast!!!! Super jealous man, I want to experience 4K at those frames wow. Awesome build man
I wouldn't be surprised if Josh did that on the regular.
Reference to Hotline Miami's pinkish artstyle ?
impressive!
When you tested the sound of this pc i was actually hearing mine lol xD
More than 80° on the CPU? Wow
you look very manly in those earrings.
Do the GPU cooling blocks reduce the card height to a single slot?
I kinda laugh every time i see a "4k rig". I get it you want quality but the cost is nowhere near the benefit. (well i'm sure if you are pulling in 6 figures it would be easier) It's tech we just won't be ready for for the next 4 years.
Wtf that shirt doesn't look blue. I want one.
A 5960X, 8-Core, 16 Threads Beast of a CPU on 4,4 GHz is the bottleneck .... I don't wanna live in this world anymore !!
i actually hear my computer through headphones which is in idle ... while yours was in load aaaand with my headphones bumped to 100% Q.Q
tacos
best computer you can buy today
Welcome to the 301+ clu ... oh ... shit. Youtube. What have you done.
whaaat?? LOL
when you have a parallel terminal your GPUs should always have same temp, since they share the same intake water.
Why not a Giveway of Hotline? It's a joke, please don't kill me !
i liked this vid because of tacos
"its so beautiful"
0:48 you're welcome...
should have used AMD GPU
Tacos :)
no witcher 3? but regardless would've did well
what was the ambient temperature when you tested the pc
+Awesomesauce Network Hey Kyle, next time you watercool multiple cards see if there is a way to make a parallel water thingimagig intead of using series. That way both cards get much needed fresh coolant.
I still think it looks like it's cooled by Pepto Bismol.
So much head bob kyle. Love it
Where are the harddrives?
TACOS!
2 cheap
But why...
TBH I liked "Pink Panther" better :)
That pink is such a good pink
TACOS!!!!! :D
Giveaway? yeah right
Excellent ad (y)
first
The tubing remind me of windows xp screen saver
Try running firestrike ultra on a GT 640. I got 0 FPS while running it.
you should run the coolant to the top card first, as SLI is only used in gaming, in rendering it would leave you using the hot card, and the cool card doing nothing
YES tacos pls
Kyle I don't mean to sound rude but i dislike your outro, you sound like that fruit cake Phillip De Franco dork..
Can I play minecraft with this build, I'm looking into building something like this but with 4 Titan X's in SLI instead of 2 980 Ti's
awsome build, awsome benchmarks, awesome sauce :D
D: is so purple I WANT PURPLE ON MY PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Forget 4k; high refresh rate 1440p is where it's at.
Great vid Kyle, the editing skills are getting better all the time. Also i could watch a half hour commercial with Josh in it, but then again im a Fractal Fanboi
Use it in good health!
Yes I would love some tacos.
What was your ambient temp?
I would like to see some newer benchmarks. Witcher 3 and MGS 5. No one cares about crysis 3 anymore, well not for the gameplay anyway. 4k Ultra Battlefield 4 above 60 fps makes me feel warm and fuzzy as well. Its a damn good looking game.
TACOS
nice
IT'S THE PINK PANTHER!!!!~
What is the outro music?
This is an awesome build
Beautiful system, love the colour scheme :)
You could throw all these specs at me and i'd still be thinking "damn.. that pink is fucking sexy"
CPU bottleneck, you know what that means, reverse the loop so the cpu is first in it, and overclock it some more. Also 2k is 1080p, 1440p would be 2.5k
Kyle, you are running a parallel terminal, both cards will get the same inlet water temp. If it was serial then the coolant would be heated by the lower card first. Upper card being hotter is probably just usage difference or just slight difference in thermal efficiency or maybe thermal paste application. Nice build though bro. Looks really nice and great performance. Good job.
I'm really crossing my fingers that I win the contest! I NEED to win so badly! School started and my PC does not have to horsepower I need for all my 3D modelling projected, video editing, and my gaming hobbies!
It will always be the pink panther!
I love your channel and the videos! They are just awesome and so much fun to watch! Keep up your amazing work <3
tacos
My fans in my PC which is under and at the other side of the wooden desk is LOUDER than your PC o.0
Why do people keep calling 2560x1440p , " 2k"? 2k is 1920x1080p. Why? Simple. 2k is most commonly an abbreviation for 2000. 1920 is a HELL of a lot closer to 2000..than 2560. The terms " 2k" and " 4k " in gaming terms refer to the horizontal pixel count. Although it's technically NOT correct for someone to call 3840x2160p, " 4k", it is much more acceptable. 2560x1440p = 2.5k This is common sense.
tacos plz
How about some Witcher 3 benchmarks? I would think that would be an excellent test for Hotline.
Hotline. I like it, glad you didn't go with "Pink Panther" like 90% of the comments wanted you to
Tacos? Yes. Always. It looks great, glad it runs well. As for 4K, I think the bigger deal is getting variable refresh rate tech ubiquitous, much like how progressive scan is standard now. HBM 2 should help the illusive consistent 4K@100Hz+. I'm rather curious as to what in or about the setup is bottlenecking: core/thread count, SLI implementation, the Haswell microarchitecture, or something completely different.
Why are those minimums so low? Also I can buy my car twice for the price of your PC. Nice.
Tacos for sure.
I want a gaming pic so bad but I'm young so I can't pay for that wonder when I can buy one I can't build one idk how
its ok my little evga 750ti you run at ultra in my hart... actualy at very high 60 fps, close enough...
tacos?
you dun good, son
Core 0 was at 55 degrees F?? What was your room temp???
tacos yes
lmao all these new fractal ads are hilarious. GG to whoever is coming up with these ideas! XD
#PinkPantherIsBetter
yes tacos, approved :p
Financially and functionally, water cooling is completely fucking stupid. So are Ferrari's. That doesn't make either any less awesome. Nice work, Kyle! Congrats on reaching a point in your career where rewarding yourself by building a true tech lovers system like this is possible. : )
Does anyone know if the asus strix gtx 980ti have a water block yet?
This build is awesome. Nuff said...
Miami
dam that's nice i built a pc too tho and i'm happy about the price/performance of it! https://pcpartpicker.com/b/6hpbt6
I agree with tacos. Tacos are good. Tacos are life.
pink panther was a better name imo
winter is coming
and in a year has to replace everything
What you guys think about this build? http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VH9QWZ
At what point does a custom water cooling system ever warrant the cost? I build them because they look bad ass, thermals and cost come second to me when we get into this price range.
Allways talking about 3k,5k "MOSNTER PC".... And e with a Intel Q6600, Asus Gt610 and 3Gb DDR2 ;( Life Sucks
I'll take an Intel i taco and a quad sli burritos
Tacos!
hell yeah tacos
Badass PC!!
That intro ?? great vid
When does the Node 202 go on sale? I want to soooo bad but i cant find it anywhere :(
Question: if i wanted an awesome purple liquid cooling setup for my SLI 980ti's as well, what would be the easiest way to do it for someone who has no experience with liquid cooling? I've heard that soft tubing is easier than hard tubing but other than that, i do not know where to start.
Tacos and Chill?
did you just include the value of your PC in your title? so very unprofessional and expected from a newb youtuber. also...you didn't buy it all, so it just ads to the cheesiness of this video. unsubscribed.
taco
tacos
Skylake-e? the wait is on
+Awesomesauce Network Hey love the videos keep on doing what your doing, do you take fan mail?
No 720p medium settings. need some console representation. xbox one vs ps4 vs hotline 3 way showdown of performance and wallet size... xD
The real question is, can it run minesweeper
any chance of a comparison with Skunkworks (J2C) and Arctic Panther (PH)?
Where'd you get that table at 2:36 (my gf loves it haha!)?
which is more demanding crysis 3 or the witcher 3....
Fajitas!
mmmm tacos.  BTW, love the Machine. Awesome job.
Oh, this is the epileptic dude.
+Awesomesauce Network You wear grey cpu shirt in video, but sell blue one in store. What gives bby gurl?
fire.
Pink Panther was a better name.
LOL you should have been like i could hardly hear the fans over my spinning SSD's....i'm not dumb it would have been funny because of course they dont spin
Is it safe when my i7- 4790k @ 4.6ghz hits 100 degrees Celsius under stress? It's water cooled by the Corsair h55 quiet edition.
Would you say you spend more time building pcs than playing games ?
Y pink?!.... Y ?
Are you gonna use your 750 SSD in here?
When I get a job I am going to make one of these!
Did you really just include the price of your rig in the title? See ya
tacos
I call horseshit on the sound test, if you have HDD's you'll hear them, no fucking way your PC is THAT quiet.
Cat tail spotted 0:17
$5k -.-
My headphones have a noise treshold so high they didn't even turn on
Was he looking to Netflix and Chill?
Wait what? At idle you had min of 12C? Does that mean your room temp is 10C????
Why no Withcer3 benchmarks ?
Why were there no 480p benchmarks?
TACOS
200 fps.. not big deal
What are you going to do about dust falling into the top? That's one reason I never opened the top of my Define.
All i could hear was my pc xD
Can it play Minesweeper at medium settings?
Why use Zotac why not EVGA,MSI or asus
I'm jealous :(
Hmmmm i have a fx 6300 with a h60 in it and the idle is 17c hottest it got in game was 35c wierd i thought intel is cooler and plus u have a custom water cooler and i have a tiny rad lol
Such a cool pc, congrats dude!
You should've called it the rape machine cause that's what happened to those benchmarks !!
Tacos?... Tacos
:D
I could go for some tacos...
This system looks amazing but I would switch the blue LED on the front of the case for a pink one to fit the colour scheme
Tacos? TACOS!!!
I just hope you don't paint something grey thats already grey again
would you please tel me the name of EK sli water block
That sli bridge though. What happen there Kyle ?
That system is freaking EPIC Kyle. So jelly. Great job and video! :)
But can it play solitare?
The only difference between this and my computer, is my cpu is only a 5930k, and my case is and Enthoo Luxe. If only had thought of going Team Pink instead of the usual, Red/Black w/ white LEDs.
sexy as f
How were you getting cpu temps below ambient temperature? I'm assuming your room isn't below 15 degrees Celsius but I suppose it could be.
The answer to taco's is never not have taco's.
WHY DO YOU ONLY MAKE BLACK SHIRTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yeah but does it run crysis 3 in 4k @ 60fps? XD
Cpu bottlenack? I think its the ram, because 8x(16x) 4,4 ghz, is very a high clock, but the ram I think is on stock speed and has "just 16gb" which is for 4k not very much. I have the same setup, but only 1x 980 ti. I installed 32gb and the fps go up. Dont now the exact result I´m not at home, where the pc and the scores are...
5960x bottlenecks?
Still think dropping 5k on a pc that can't handle 4k with ease is a waste in my pov.... I rather just build a computer for 1440p and save some money for next gen cpu/gpu. Again it's just my ''POV''
The intro ads remind me that I can't buy a Node 202.
Why do you put ads of products that aren't on sale? Sure maybe a week before release to try to build hype but we've been waiting WEEKS for the node 202. GIVE IT TO US NOW JOSH!
yes, tacos
+awesomesaucenetwork
that is the best fractal design commercial have seen
Hey I'm new to the pc thing and I was wondering if the new driver is compatible with all gtx 960 and for windows 10

The only noise I heard during the sound test was my 9800GT D:
I'd say you're ready for 4K now, but the water cooling question: For performance? No. But who builds a custom water cooling for the performance? It's for enthusiasm :) But the quiet is nice though :P
He called it hotline because of the Drake song
Fractal Josh lol.
When you realize the only noise you hear during the sound test is your PC... while wearing headphones lol
:10 cat, :20, cat gone
Tacos!
its a damning indictment when people actually spend 1500€+ on a pc just for playing games, I am also often. feeling bad that I have spent 1100€ on my PC, considering an xbox1 costs 350€ and can make a smart TV out of a normal one, but the controller on consoles are shit for FPS, thats why I stayed on the pc side
Arent those gpus in parallel with that manifold?
Air cooled 980 ti go over 1500mhz
Still not over how beautiful that pc is
Whilst you're using all of this fancy nancy components, i'm stuck using a GTX 750 ti because of my awful budget pls send me good hardware ;-;
Lovely color scheme with black.
23 like a pro ????????
The colors remind me of GTA Vice City for some reasons.
Couldn't care less about 4k. At this point it's still an early adoption gimmick for turbonerds judging by the international availability of 4k Freesync/G-Sync monitors and their prices, let alone additional hardware to drive them. 1440p is more than enough for me for the next few years.
Looks Güd
TACOS!
Bench stuff in 5k and bench minecraft!
Why didnt you benchmark any newer games?
First ! :D Great build
netflix and chill with fractal josh
Awesome pc build! Quick question, my psu broke and I'm looking for a reliable one any recommendations?
Just curious, in this 5k build, why only 16gb of ram. I feel like you would see 32 or even 64 in builds this expensive. Anyways great video
Nice pc bro
Dang that's a nice pc! And great video by the way. :)
tfw your PC is more expensive than my car.
My day just got so much better because you uploaded. Thank you :^)
Nice Video!
Push through top is quieter than push through front. Evga 280 clc in R5
Hah! Your so thin here loool
How come literally nobody mentions intake top radiator mount. I have my fans pulling through my top mounted radiator...
But i think there is an important difference between front-mounted to top mounted as in your other video.
you know most games have chat?
awesome video learned a lot today thanks .Especially since i am going to dipping my toes into water cooling my next build AIO mind you but still water cooling none the less and now i know how to place fans and Radiators now thank you Jay !!
Radiators are only for aio?
skit made me want to kill myself
Thanks for the lecture, professor TwoCents.
He was at B the whole time tho lol
you miss 2 wierd things: pull-pull and push-push :)
Nice vid thanks Jay! Or should I say thank you algorithm for correctly labeling my comment as positive sentiment... that isn't spam... which would make it ham.
Jay drives a 350, this man becomes sexier by the minute
Thicc Radiator
need help at B
"push vs pull doesn't matter", except when you're pulling cool air from the room through one radiator, and pushing hot air from inside the case through the other... Not clicking anymore videos by this dude, the annoying talking was bad enough, like just get to the point! This is just stupid, though.
Suck or Blow, that is the question...
Am I able to just have one fan pushing air thru the radiator or do I have to have two fans on the radiator?
Im gonna wear my socks to bed tonight.
Front and top are both pulling with me Everthing is watercooled They suck all the hot air out And dust stays away from pc and radiator
you earned that sub with the intro.. +1
Hi from 2018
This is why you use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet. It's BRAVO.
Man this guy was a savage back then
Hi. The only problem is that for pull mode the cooling fan will be heated by the hot air from inside the box ;), and in time....
VIDEO STARTS AT 0:2:08...save yourself the sappy intro!
can i still use front pull fans radiotors as i already have 3case fans in front? im using a segotep lux3 case
Can someone help me out? I'm building my first pc tomorrow and I want to go with a front mounted 360 rad but should I have the fans pushing or pulling? I was thinking pushing so I could see the 3 rgb fans from the front of my case (front tempered glass) but idk if I should have them pull I'm confused all advice is greatly appreciated
You could just flip the fans and covert from push to pull or vice versa. Then you can still keep the radiator where it’s at to meet your aesthetic needs.
Thanks man. For a minute there I was thinking that I put my fans incorrectly in my new build ??
so how to mount 120 radiator in back
I'm a newer subscriber to this channel, so many of your videos I've watched very out of date and out of order. I know this is a way older video. Have you done something comparing Push/Push with rads vs. Pull/Pull? As i have seen from Linus, which makes sense is that the pull config makes clearing out dust much easier than having to take the fan off the rad to clear out dust, but does this make a difference other than temps due to built up dust, and does it make cleaning much easier?
what is up with yo Mug????=???????
Nice videos, been on your channel a lot recently. I'm planning my first build, and I'm doing all my homework prior to submitting my orders. I was wondering, on a front mounted radiator would it be beneficial to push air out with the top fan and pull air in with the bottom fan? I'm basing this off the idea that hot air rises and the coolest air intake would be at the lowest point. I'm using the Fractal design nano s case, so the front is vented with a dust filter in between, and I plan on leaving the top side of case vented with a dust filter.
4:25 Fan configuration in case
waaht? waaht?
I guess the only time you might get a difference between push and pull is if either the fans don't seal completely against the radiator so you either get air leakage with push instead of it going through the radiator in pull where its pulling air from the case rather than through the rad. you also might get different air flow characteristics with cases that try to cater for all possible fan configurations and therefore have huge holes around the size being used as these often end up just circulating air inside the case especially with cases that have resistive inlets for the air like the NZXT base 630 So personally I use a sheet of thin acoustic foam which I spray glue to the case to block up the extra holes around the fans so that the ONLY way air can get through those fans is through holes the exact same size as the fans as its a nice cheap way to control air flow paths in cases that cater for a huge variety of cooling choices with 2 or 3 fans of different diameters if that makes sense
But he was wearing a headset
How can he decide to pull or push air just twisting the fans? Are they made for two way installation? The arctic cooling case fan F12 PWM PST CO is able to do it but im confused. Can you just change the pull push just by changing the fan side?
so pull/pull doesn't improve cooling really but adds a lot of noise and uses a bunch of space?
Great breakdown, very helpful
PS never push, push your fans.
Loving the add in the beginning
THICC
Boom knowledge bomb
Creepy grin intro ??????????????
I think this is pretty miss leading. You ever do that thing in high school where you try to suck water up a really tall straw and you can't do it. Or wonder why well pumps are located at the bottom of wells and not just at the top. It's physics you can never actually pull something. You're pushing the air creating a vacuum and then the atmosphere pushes air through the radiator to resolve the vacuum in between the radiator and the fans. It may not make a huge difference in these really low pressure computer fans but it is always better to push if at all possible.
Came here looking for the answer at 5:06. Thank you :D
Just realized Jay shaved his hairline back in this video... Weird.
Isn’t pushing the hot radiator air into the case bad? I thought you always wanted air from the coolers to be pushed out.
I had push/push for my FX 9590 Radiator. Always make sure your fans are facing the correct direction.
You can't push air, because it compresses. You can, however, pull air.
What about push and pull both a normal rpm on 30mm
High static pressure fans..?? Well Jay... an Axial fan is really not a High static pressure fan. Axials are not Pressure efficient by nature. But with a stronger fan motor, it will be better suited to work though the pressure load/drop that a radiator has. So these are normally fast and noisy if used as Case fans. As opposite. A low RPM/Silent and weak-motered 1000RPM "case" fan, will fight a loosing battle, if placed on a radiator For maximizing the airflow through the radiator. Use strong motor fans and No gaps between fan housing and radiator. (Seal any gaps on the side)
HAHA LOVE THE ARNOLD! GET TO THA CHOPPA!
So just to clarify. I can mount my radiator in the front and have the fans mounted on the back to have the fans exposed for while pulling air? This won’t affect performance? Because on PC Part Picker, the builds I see that have front mounted radiators have the fan then the radiator. Which results in the fans being covered by the radiator. I want the fans to be exposed in the front while pulling air but literally every build I see, people do the opposite by mounting the fans onto the case then mounting the rad on the fans for pull configuration.
god i love how sassy you are hahah
I FRICKING LOVE THIS INTRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JAYZ YOUR AWESOME
You two are dorks. In a good way
I've got push pull on my h100 v2 :)
damn son that skyline is richness
Jayz you just made an oreo with that push pull config. Your. either brilliant or lucky but anyways +1like just for it
Would a Push & Pull FAN configuration on the AIO provide more static pressure = better cooling?
I wanted to know how case temp is affected by pulling air inside through radiator, not what the words mean :(
Nostalgic
Here's a question. I have 8 fans in my water cooling rig with 3 of them at 120mm mounted on my radiator using a push config. Should they run at 12v or 7v when connected.
i hope you have a new barber now.... love your videos dude
Can I put 2 fans without a radiator
I'm gonna call you johnna hill because this video is old and you're like 150 pounds look great! :)
Urgh, how can you run a glossy monitor...
I need help at B ... lol
8:10 A TON OF THICCCCCCCCCNESS!
Interesting..i have a lian li pc 08 case and i want to instal a 360 radiator on the front and a 240 radiator on the top..what configuration do you recommend me to use for each radiators? How radiator use to push and how to pull? Thanks for help me with my buid
My case has slot for 120mm fans, it I got 140mm... don’t know what to do...
Cheers Jay
"Something appears to have changed." I run pull on my front mounted AIO in my A10-7870k SFF build for maintenance and appearance. I can easily reach the fans from the inside if I need to take them down for any reason at all, and I can reach the rad from the outside for cleaning. Plus you can't see the branding on the side of the rad, but you can see the fans, from the view window. If I take the front cover off, the rad's right there, giving the system a neat industrial look. My build can run in partial passive mode, using only my single case fan to keep it cool (35c) at desktop and light loads, but peeking into the side of the case lets me see if the fans are running or if one has stopped for some reason. (I had to take one offline for repairs.) .... Guys, why are you staring at me like that?
5:32 Allah the radiator
ok, so now if you install one fan in push and the other in pull on a 240-280 rad would temp deviate from if you just do both push, pull, or push/pull?
I have a noobish question, I have a 6 fan configuration on three 120mm radiators that when finished, will provide solid positive pressure into my build. Right now I only have two radiators in and before I install the third, I wanna find the best way to provide power to those fans considering I only have 2 fan ports on my motherboard. I saw you can use a molex adapter with multiple three pin splits, but is that wise to that? Will it effect my motherboard running 3 more fans off of one 3 pin fan Port?
every fucking video you got has 30s advert on it, why ? you wanna get rich quick or something ? please stop this, its a real put off
Great video. Thank you.
You are boring
hand+skin = flapping
didn't mention one thing... should the rad fan blow hot air out, or suck cool air in? Regardless of push and/or pull setup, you still have that option, hot air out, or cold air in?
You did a perfect job of explaining the concepts. I was really confused about push and pull configuration.
In my experience, using the push method lowered my idle CPU temps from 40c to 27c.
Jay, your videos are SOOOOOOO appreciated. I have no problem at all following along with your logic. Don't ever stop making videos dude. Seriously.
A more detailed airflow with smoke would be appreciated, thanks in Advance
What about stacking the rads in a push pull configuration would you get the same airflow? Not that I’m running that more less just curious
Okay, so I understand the concept of push-pull better now but it makes me wonder how much temp difference are we looking at in a push-pull configuration if the fans are A.) high static pressure fans, and B.) running full speed.
#teampull
that ad at the beginning was hilarious haha
I stand on pull side more.. like in car.. fan is behind radiator, pulling air trough.. vacuum on fan side and fresh air coming in directly trough radiator first.. pushing air kind of creating resistance and high pressure area between fan and radiator.
What if you have a push-push (or pull-pull) config, so fan-fan-rad instead of fan-rad-fan like in push-pull? Does it improve the rad cooling/airflow inside the case in any way?
whats the reccomended rpm for radiator fans when the radiator is on the top of the case pushing air out of the case? My current fans only run at 1500rpm
Jay what the fuck? You're saying that without fans rads will do nothing, but in the earlier vid where you talked about radiator basics, you said - and it's almost a quote - that rads have plenty of cooling capacity by themselves and even without fans they can offer better cooling than air cooling. So which one is actually the truth?
Gotta love the condescending attitude
Hello Jay, could you help out? Running a nzxt CPU cooler and a gigabyte water force in a phanteks pro m case. seems like mounting the CPU on the front would be fine with a push pull and then just mounting the gpu radiator in the back? Then moving the fans that came with the case to top and have them pull. Would you change that in any way?
I understand that push or pull won't really make a difference, and push and pull only helps if your fans don't create a static pressure, but surely it matters if you are forcing the air(thus heat) into your case as opposed to out.
I prefer pull ONLY because it keeps the radiator exposed so it's easier to clean the dust off of it.
using a 240mm radiator thats 30mm thick, could i have a single 120mm fan between the case and the radiator and then 2 120s on the inside of the case? i have one extra fan and im trying to put it to use.
@JayzTwoCents FYI there are fan splitter cables that allow the PWM line to go to up to 5 fans while the power for said fans can be handled separately by a MOLEX connector from the PSU. This is helpful if you are running many fans or extremely high powered fans and don't want to burn put the fan headers on your motherboard. (Most motherboards can only handle 1 amp of power total as you said in your video.)
you never finished this build. I want to c this build!!!
I'm still going with the push-pull config, i don't think thickness will be much of an issue with a Full-Tower ATX case.
i had a radiator without fan for a while... two months, yes its my first pc build
So if I'm building in an S340, should I have two SP120 fans in the front, and two AF120s exhausting in the back and top?
this whole push pull thing gives me a headache... I think i'll just stick with air cooling and figure out how to promote positive pressure instead of water cooling.. (nothing against people who water cool, I just think it's not for me)
could you do a push push?
What is the reference for your forehead line ?
you could make a simple U shaped tube with water with one end inside the case to show airflow inside the case
surprised no one is using aluminum.
thanks for this video. I am just starting a build and fans are more confusing than the build itself. ??
noctis 450 perfect case for push pull config on top
Wearing headphones but still can't hear because of how loud the fans are... I feel bad for the neighbors. LOL ;-)
awesome intro lol
You got my like just for the stupid intro :-)
In the beginning, the way he talks and his hairs make him look like the younger version of the giant from Twin Peaks :D
Oh my god that first scene tho xD Thumbs up for that! xD
I'm digging this back up from the dead. Jay, I've read some people saying that having a static pressure as push and an airflow fan as pull will give better results than using all static pressure. You ever try this?
Umm you made an Oreo Sandwich bro , no one makes more on screen innuendo's with PC hardware than you Jay!
(allah the radiator) 5:31
I like how you integrate your ads, making a fun skit out of them.
how to setup 2 radiators? so one radiator for the cpu and the other one is for what? where do you mount it on?
But how can you put it in the bottom?? do Radiator fans not need vents??
You are the most creative advertising Youtuber I've seen so far...
I assume that putting a 2 push fans in the roof of the case is actually smarter, because the pull fans are pulling a cold air, which gets warm because it flows through the pc. hot air is floating up (just like hot balloon flies bacause of hot air floating) so putting them up in the case is avtually smarter and not just an aesthetic choice, i guess...
I have a captain 240ex mounted on the top of my case I want to mount rgb fans on it and I cant decide if its better to put the fans above the radiator and if I should have them push the air through the radiator into the case or have them pull the air through the radiator out of the case
im glad i have finally found a guy what could explain this properly. Im a novice in liquid cooling because i always used standard air cooling. I have bought the Kraken X62 for my new rig but need help how to install it. Thanks Jay
Perfect explanation, the best I have seen so far. Thanks!
do radiator fan gaskets make a difference?
i was gonna use 4 120mm corsair rgb fans for my radiator. i hear rgb fans are normally bad for this?
Dude, you NEED to do all the Arnie-voices in every movie he ever made :D
Okay but if I run push pull on a h100 V2 and still keep the rpms high. Will i Acheive lower temps then the push configuration I have now?
i thought linus tech tips covered this and concluded anything more than 2 fans is just wasting $...
why do you want to bring the heat inside the case when youre trying to get heat out???? Duh
This helped
really hot where you live? how much hot is it?
On the radiator up top, don't the fans basically exhaust the hot air from inside the case into the radiator? just curious :D
what case is that ?
Hi, I just got the mastercase maker 5 case and like to replace the fans with the noctua 2000rpm (black one). Do you think it's a good idea ? or if the noctua is compatible with the case.
But what if I wanted to stick my cock in a radiator? Would a push configuration work better than pulling?
I'll save you all some time. The BEST fans for watercooling are the corsair SP120 or AF140 depending on which size you need. They offer the best static pressure and fan speed (1200+) but they are noisy as hell. I have 24 of them in my case so I should know. Just buy a pair of noise cancelling headphonea and your all good.
What is your favorite high static pressure fan for radiators? I have a kraken x62
Linus did a video, showing that a pull helps less dust on the radiator, plus easier to clean.
Can I use a dueal pull config? (on one radiator)
Do a demo.
Wanna see the 3 intake 5 exhaust fan video with smoke. Please. BTW Love the vidz keep it up and gratz on 1 million subs.
Basically, Pull= intake Push= exhaust i always go with pull for pulling in cool air from outside the case, keeps the CPU a little cooler
on my define r5 the push side is hidden so push/pull isn't that bad with a front radiator.
Come with me if you want to live
Linus Tech Tips won to you by... let's say... 3 years?
The advertisement is just LOL
what case is that
If I have 3x120mm fans and 3 more for a 360mm radiator pulling air in the case and only one 120mm pushing air out, is the air pressure too positive, or is it fine depending on how many vents my case has?
Would it not be worth mentioning that with pull you get better airflow inside the case than with push? When I changed from Pull to Push my CPU went from +47 under load to as high as +60C. Same game, same settings, same starting environmental variables. The ambient temperature also went up quite a lot inside the case, and the airflow was completely ruined. With pull I had a streamlined airflow from front to back. With push I had multiple vortexes in the front and normal exhaust in the back. I even tried push/pull, just regular pull still works better.
how can you hear the jet engine fans if you're on headphones???
what is the best Watercooling Case for 280$?
Very interresting, thanks !
Logan? Jay you sounds like Schwarzenegger
Why does it seem to you that everybody is stupid?
what cooler u recommend for an i7-7700K?
why do you need a radioator in a pc case ? i live in the hottest city in brazil, and i'm puzzled by this
I've heard pull is better, simply from a dust standpoint; when you go to clean the dust it mostly be on the side without the fans, not sandwiched in-between the fans and radiator.
just my two cents. cleaning and keeping a radiator with a push / pull or just push is a real pain. what are your thoughts on stacking in the pull configuration?
You looked fucking psychotic when he opened the door lol. You could be the killer in a horror movie. Lol
racist xD
i learn something every time i watch a show of your's .
good video
I see that you're only using SP fans, and not AF fans? nor in front. And is it good idea to use AF fans in front? thanks.
Pull is best if your not using push/pull. Push builds way too much dust in the radiator and thus hinders cooling. In push/pull you will want to adjust your fan speed to compensate for fan resistance against one another rpm wise . Keep your pulll slightly faster.. Problem really is in the design of the radiators.
Jay. I have a question I need your help with. I just got a EKWB EK-XLC Predator 240 1.1 for my pc. I also got the add-on fan kit for it for push/pull from EKWB. Right now, I can't lift my pc to find out on my own due to a left ankle complex fracture, dislocation, 5 metal plates and screws holding it all in place. My case is a NZXT Phantom 820 and my motherboard is a Asus Maximus VIII Hero. Can I run push/pull in it with the Predator 240? Reason I ask is the Predator 240 is setup different from my current Arctic Liquid Freezer 240 where the top 2 fans fit on the top outer part of the case, where as with the Predator 240 all 4 fans and the radiator will be in the case above the motherboard. I really wanted the Predator 240 for being able to change the fluid when needed and expand it to a video card downthe road. I won't be able to lift my pc for at least 2 more month's to figure this out on my own. Right now I'm just getting all my upgrade parts I want, so they're ready to go when I can lift and work inside my pc again. I'm down to my last 2 upgrades, as both my ssd's won't fit all my games. I have 2 Samsung 850 EVO 1.0TB ssd's left to get. I'm going with them, as I can't afford the Samsung 9**'s for the size I need and one is going to be m.2 and I'd need some adaptor from Asus to use the newer u.2 or whatever format, as my board just has the first m.2 slots used.
wtf is that intro, i died laughing for some reason.
Quick question Jayz, if I have a R9 295x2, which has a 120mm radiator, everyone has been talking about push, pull & push + pull. what if I want to pull + pull configuration which will be same hight as push pull? will the cooling be different?
is the h80i v2 good enough for the i7 7700k to overclock and where would i mount it on corsair spec 03 case
Lol, I like how telephones don't exist in the intro ad. ;D
shouldn't you try and keep positive pressure inside your rig to keep some dust out
I dont even watercool but it seems pretty straight forward to me. Push the air out of the case rather than into the case. Unless you can do both.
I'm not looking at this for computers since it BARELY matters but with car radiators I assume a small difference would be much more important since I live in Florida but I can't find any videos on the topic regarding cars
Surely if you use radiator fans to suck air into the case you are blowing hot air onto key components, surely it's better to use radiator fans as exhausts, and fit clear fans as intakes, ensuring hot air leaves quickly and is replaced with cool air.
you said that positive pressure should be created but then you said you usually choose push config, doesn't push mean create negative pressure?
I always go pull on radiator for reason of cleaning push alot of dust gets on the radiator pull gets hardly any but like the video said hardly any difference
liked for the fan ad.
jay why should using push or pull setup effect the aesthetics ?! can't we just flip over the fan in order to changing push to pull (or vice versa)instead of moving the fan to the other side of radiator? that way with the fans inside the rads we can do either push or pull on every location just by flipping over the fans...
Can i put a normal fan in front, pushing, the radiator then a high static pressure fans pulling?
i died at the intro... thanks for the vid... my fans were all over the place... fast build, no planing :-O lols
Ok, so weird question. I plan on getting the 460x case and really didn't want to change out the front fans, as it is a nice aesthetic. I also didn't want to top mount my radiator for three reasons, first being that you cant use high profile ram if you top mount it, as the case isn't tall enough, secondly the magnetic filter on the top of the case restricts flow a lot more than the normal filter in the front, lastly, I saw a couple of videos explaining that pulling fresh air from the front of the case has about a 10 degree difference, so I want to front mount it. Unfortunately the front fans only push at 1400 rpm, while the h100i v2 fans push or pull at 2450 rpm. Is this going to cause significant problems if I went with a push/pull configuration using different rpm fans? I checked a few forums that dint have very concrete answers, also I couldn't find anything on youtube. It would be greatly appreciated if anyone had an answer.
It is sad how many of you are idiots where he has to explain things in such childish terms for you twats to understand.
Jay likes his case to be all fung shui
just skip to 4:20 those 4:20 costed me some brain cells
3:50 instead of moving the the fan to the other side of the radiator you should have focused on explaining which side of the fan makes it push configuration and which side makes it pull configuration that would make it easier for many beginners to understand.
So the temps were literally higher in front mounted position but aren't going to immediately hurt the computer. Got it. Duh.
keep up the great work as always. alwsys learning from ur videos.
on a 240mm radiator. with both of the fans on the same side, can you do one fan pushing and the other fan pulling? for a neutral air pressure balance
Wouldn't adding a radiator to the top of your case cause hot air to run through it and in turn cause the system to run hotter?
With proper static fans, do you 'really' need push/pull? Seems like with the proper fans, PULL is good enough.
Schwarzenegger style yes
I need help reducing dust on my case I have Deepcool Captain 240 EX and a Phanteks Eclipse p400 All the fans are occupied Top and back are all exhaust (All 3 fans are now PWM) Front Rads are Intake (Deepcool Captain PWM fans waterblock is not PWM) I have setup fan speeds on my Asus B85M-Pro Front are 40 - 100 percent fan curve Exhaust fans are DC mode since their not PWM (0 RPM when below 45c, 50% when 45 and up) Is this fine? I need some suggestions.
Pull makes less noise.
and this is why you use the Military alphabet to not have that problem ;)
right on the money man!
that intro tho XDDDD
omg look at his poor arm xD so much wasted skin xD
I thought that pushpull was for 2 fan radiators, and there were only 2 fans both opisutly flipped
I'm very new to pc building and before you explained push pull I assumed that you'd actually have both fans on the same side of the radiator but with different orientations. As opposed to opposite sides of the radiator but with the same orientation. One point that I feel the big boy pc builders such as JayzTwoCents/Bitwit to name a couple here on youtube are not touching on (or me simply failing to find a relevant video) is whether to use radiator fans as exhausts or intakes. Don't confuse this with push/pull configurations explained in this video; for example a fan can be used to push air into the radiator and out of the case acting as an exhaust (such as the top radiator in this clip) but it can also be used to push air into the radiator and into the case acting as an intake (as opposed to pulling from the radiator and into the case which is what the fans on the front radiator are doing in this clip). The same logic applies to pull-intake/pull-exhaust/push-pull-intake/push-pull-exhaust configurations. My concern with the exhaust/intake business is the effect of the radiator on other components in the case. In an exhaust configuration you'd be attempting to cool the liquid in the radiator with whatever air you have in your case, if that air is already too hot due to a component other than what the radiator is trying to cool, then you're just adding fuel to the fire. In an intake configuration the cold air entering the case will be heated by the radiator, causing ALL your components, INCLUDING the one you're trying to cool to be exposed to the hot air produced by the component you're trying to cool. For those reasons I feel an external radiator would be the most effective. I understand that the inefficiency component of a radiator is what doesn't allow this to happen. TLDR neither exhaust nor intake configurations make enough sense to me. PLZ help explain JayZ
Yes, please! A how-to on case air flow using smoke and radiators would be most enlightening!
if we run fans at full speed at all the time by connecting them to psu then the performance won't be affected right? as the heat can exit through the fins of the radiater

I would argue that a push configuration is better for the longevity of the fans in the long term because the air going through the fan is always colder than if it was pulling warm air out. This might extend the life of the fan before it fails.
Are there companies out there that will make custom radiators? like if I wanted a hexagon/honeycomb fin pattern could that be done somewhere?
I liked the video... for the sponsor...
This was a really good and well made video
Why is you using airflow fans for the radiator, not static pressure one?
Please please get something other than xxr's. if you have then yay! Good video though, never knew push/pull was about the same performance wise.
Tek syndicate is dead.
what case is that
Well that advertisement was golden.
from your setup your heating the air MORE buy pulling air across the front radiators into the case. wouldnt it be better to get cool air into the case and then push or pull it OUT of the case ?! (but not through a radiator)
what keyboard is that?
Jay, you lost more weight? Looking good! #nohomo
A note, the PWM standard allow the control of LOTS of fans per header, so if you use a cable or breakout box that draws power from something like a Molex or SATA, but passes through a PWM signal you could run as many fans as you like off a single header (and indeed this can be a neat looking way to do things for cable management). The tachometer line is optional, and in theory shouldn't matter since all fans that comply with the standard will not over RPM even at 100% duty cycle (indeed this is the effective running state when the PWM line is not connected), although I have found some cheap fans may "tick" or otherwise adversely behave at the lower duty cycles despite the standard calling for all fans to work at the minimum, so if different fans are used I'd recommend connecting it to the slowest. The downside of doing this is you have less zones in which you can control speed independently, but using 1 header per watercooling loop is generally fine, as its cooling the same fluid, although 2 may be useful if minium RPM is a binding constraint (thus turn half the fans off at low load).
your buddy is great in every video I have seen him in
thank you,!!! greetings from Brazil !!
Your videos are always informative, even for someone who's been building pcs for awhile.
When front mounting a rad does it matter if the barbs/inlet outlet are on the bottom or top?
nice intro
best intro ever
Hey i'm planning on getting a Corsair Obsidian 750D and use a Corsair H110i for CPU cooling. What configuration do you suggest? I was planning on using it as a push - exhaust fan (2x140)
Old video I know but I wanna throw something into the equation for people who are lazy, like me for example. Pulling fans tend to collect less dust because they pull it out through the radiator and putting it straight outta the case instead of pushing it against the radiator and making it stick there. Also thank you Jay for making a video that I can copy and paste over and over again when I´m getting asked these kind of questions.
takes a shot everytime he says THICC ;D
Thank you Jay!!!...I'm so glad I found your channel, you've taught me so much and I can't wait to get started on my PC build.
does this apply the same if you were to just be using an AIO cpu cooler?
Video starts at 2:08
do you need radiators?
radiator for WHAT??
So what is the purpose of having a radiator on the front intake? The way I understand it, the intake is pulling in cooler ambient air that doesnt need the radiator to dissipate heat. What am I missing here?
Great video. It helped me a lot! Thank you. I have just finished my Corsair C70 Military build! So i went for 2 Noctua F12's on the front pulling air into the PC through the storage compartment (super quiet fans running at 1500rpm - it sucks in my 420 smoke!). 2 AF 140's on the top pushing air out of the case, running @ around 1000RPM each (again, very quiet fans and move a lot of air). On the rear I have my MSI Dragon 120mm Radiator with a Corsair SP120 pushing air through the rad and out the back of the case. It's worth mentioning my MSI Dragon Liquid Cooler is 18 months old (from a prev build) and still going strong. Obviously it's a good one, it's made by Asetek!! The pump is running at top speed (silent 1590RPM) and the SP120 @ around 2000RPM (super quiet). FX-8350 (stock speed 4.0Ghz) i am getting Idle temps of 18c-23c depending on weather and I haven't seen it go above 44c under full load (I play GTA V at 2k 60fps for hours on end!). So thanks again for making a great video, and hope my comment can help some folks out.
mad car
Master of watercooling, can you help me? I just got a H90 from a friend. The problem is that I have an Haf 922 and the only places for an 140 fun is the bottom or the front, it would be a huge mistake if I let it on the bottom? would the air stay on the pump?
Oh come on... what about push - push or pull - pull? Good info and all... but to make it complete, I would have addressed making sure not to make your fans work against each other. Breaking it down so much means there will be those doing this for the first time and could make that mistake.
Hello- I'm waiting for some parts for a new build to arrive and am wondering everyone's opinion regarding fan configuration for my rig. Case: Corsair 400C CPU Cooling: Corsair H100i V2 GPU: EVGA 1080 Hybrid (shown in vid above) I plan to do a push/pull config for my cpu & gpu radiator's and because of the smaller overhead vs motherboard/ram height I would place both radiators in the front of the case as intake. As a side note I plan to remove the mechanical hd bay as I am doing a SSD only build. So I guess what I want to know is what do you think, and what would you do?
That fan commercial cracks me up every time I see it
This was one of the most useful video's I've found for water cooling, I have decided for my Case labs Mercury S8 case to do a 280 mm push pull on the front but really quiet fans, this is my overall goal. Thanks again for the great video Jay
whats the best method for the dust? pull or push?
Thanks.  lengthily but informative.  thanks.  I'm going to pull off the cpu and push the air out the back trying to balance.  Thanks again.  Sorry I couldn't watch the entire thing.  Time constraint.
10:42 aproxx. if have a case that has a bump(a small curvuature on whe the place that is for the fan what can you do with it) ant want to install a 2 fun water coling system push pull like the nepton 120 xl what can i do? please help
So i have my fans on the outside pushing air through my radiator, into the case, and then i have a 140mm fan in the front of my case pushing air to the 120mm fan on the back of my case which is pulling air out of the case... Does this sound like a good setup? Or should I have the fans on the inside of the case, pushing the air through the radiator, outside of the case?
lol , great vid
There actually is a difference between pushing and pulling through a resistance. But it is probably negligible in this context. We did some testing on this in college for designing a wind tunnel. Basically, if you are pushing air through a radiator, the air is turbulent as it goes through. This means the turbulent air has to straighten out and loses more energy in the process. However, when you are pulling air THROUGH a radiator, the air is starting from rest, so can be pulled in any direction it needs to, and the flow would be laminar. This is also another good reason to pull air through filters, rather than push. Besides protecting the fan from dust, it is easier to pull through a filter than to push through it. At least in close range.
ok, I've got Corsair Carbide 600Q case, with Corsair H115i cooler mounted to the floor with fans as pull just because its easier to clean when it gets dirty (it wont that much thanks to filters), then I was thinking "ok the radiator is going to limit the flow so i need to improve it and somewhat force it" so the 3 fans that came with case are working as exhaust, two at front one at back to force more chaos air circulation. good way of thinking?
My case has two intake 120mm fans, two 120mm on top, one 120mm on the back and another 120mm on the botton. I'll buy an Corsair H80i GT. I'd like to install the radiator on the upper spot on the front. Push and pull taking the air from outside to inside the case. Is that ok? Case is and Raidmax Viper GX.
what kind of car is that?
I've had all my Radiators in a pull method for a couple reasons. 1st would be due to clearance size from a specific and having the fans to close to cabling or motherboard. 2nd Since I live in Cali and it's a dust bowl these days, I've noticed the fans do not clog up with dirt/dust as if they were underneath the Radiator. but it's all about preference and fan case fan configurations. Great Vid!
Let's say he does the 11 fan method lol... Would that be quieter since they're not running super hard or...
can you try push push and pull pull just for shits and giggles?
would noctua fans be good for radiators?
your triceps scare me
Setup. Set up. Same thing, right?
do ek Radiators come with Fans?
I got an 38mm radiator (Arctic Liquid Freezer 240) and would really like to remove my 2 fans on top of my Zalman Z11 case, currently pushing out through the radiator to the very top of my case, over the radiator and pull air out like this. Would that make sense? And should I rather use my Corsair Fans with high static pressure or normal airflow fans to pull out the air? Thanks a lot for help. (and sorry for my english:D)
Haha adds like these are good.
????? ????
I love the ads you make.
The ad was awesome haha
Oo TT <3
I didn't quite understand, if i use push-pull setup will it make a better cooling for a radiator, under same conditions as with push or pull setup?
Wouldn't having a pull on the front just pump the warm air from the front radiator back onto the components?
IMO always install in pull if possible. Easier to clean.
whats the big deal about push pull, no need to study that right? I push cold air to the radiator or the heatsink of aircooling solutions and I pull warm air away from the rediator or rtl the aircooling block. but I guess thats the reason why I only recommend to mound the pull fans out of the case. the warm air then gets where its supposed to be, out of the computer into the room. otherways warm air gets blown into the case, no good deal, gnomsayn..
Saw that mint 350, subbed.
yesss yesss do a video explaining it with smoke!!
Hi :) What is the white case in the back called?
What do I do if I have no vents for a fan on the top of my case???
Jay,I'm sure that this is a stupid question, but have you ever heard of anybody using "mercury" as a liquid in a closed loop?  I saw a black and mostly silver build that looked like that was what they did.  It's on the EK website.  I'm guessing no, but I wanted to get your opinion.
+JayzTwoCents you will receive this a lot, but I cannot seem to find a definitive explanation. I am running an i7-6700k & gtx 1080 and doing a custom loop. I am aiming for an ultra quiet setup that is also capable of taking care of the heat when pushed. I am therefore looking at two 480mm 45mm or 60mm thick radiators to maximise my heat dissipation area, whilst maintaining an rpm as low as possible - from off, to 500-750rpm and then higher as needed. the trouble I'm having is rpm vs dB vs push/pull vs push & pull. doing push & pull increases the noise fan at the same rpm by about 3dB from what I've read, but what I can't tell is if i would save more than 3dB by maintaining a sub 750rpm speed for longer whilst achieving the same or lower temps. e.g. if i target 70° on the GPU, it could take say 1250rpm on just push, but 650rpm on push pull for the same result, which ought to be quieter. before I go buying 16 fans though, would be good to get your input if possible because no tests and data I've read/watched so far seem to cover this area of watercooling.
Could you use a radiator for intake, and would it make a difference?
Really quick please, im about to install mine. If im mounting my fan/radiator of the back of my tower. Starting from the back, it goes casing, fan, radiator, fan. MY QUESTION IS... what position does my radiator tubes (that hold the water) have to be? I am replacing the fan and forgot to look before i took it out. Does it matter if the tubes are on the top, side, bottom? i dont know how the water flows through these things. please please help. thank u sir
Thanks, great information. I built a custom loop a few years ago, and I just started a new build with Corsair's H115i AiO because I wanted to keep it simpler. Essentially, I'm hearing you say that there is marginal difference between push configs vs pull configs when it comes to temp. I always thought pull was more effective than push using fans with high static pressure. Do you think I'd benefit from push-pull on their rad if I've got the room? Would it be overkill? Thanks for the vid. Edit: Should mention that I picked up two Noctua NF-A14 3000RPM to replace Corsair's fans. I was going to use all four unless I don't have the space or it isn't necessary for the rad's fin density.
???????? ????? ? ???? ?????? ?
Normaly i dont realy like ad but if i watch ur videos its just funny ^^
How can you tell the top/bottom of the radiator? Im looking to do a push config and it wont heat my other parts because im putting it at the front, where air filters and stuff are (corsair 400c)
for 980ti sli im wanting a 480mm x 80mm rad but what configuration would be best suitable for quiet but affective running
That Fairlady Z
Watched for 1m 30, talks about "something new", his friend not hearing him on game chat and his new t-shirt from his sponsor... be nice, if he actually talked about fans, am off to find a more useful video.
really like your simple and easy to get explanations. helps beginners like myself a lot. thank you.
what case is that?
does this only apply to water cooling radiators? how about cpu air cooler?
Great channel jay! It would be great for you to do a video about positive pressure, maybe you could also give some tips about keeping computers dust free? I have heard the positive pressure helps out a lot
A pull configuration on the front could raise the air temperature on the inside, am I right?
Aesthetically it may look weird but why not attach the rad(s) on the outside of the case (more holes)? I'm guessing you shouldn't mount your rads upside down (inside or outside) because the pump would need to work harder against gravity? What's better mounting the pump to push or pull, also before, after or farthest away from the reservoir (between reservoir and rad)?
How do push/pull configurations screw together?
Easily the most informative video about fan configurations. Thanks!
Thanks a lot. this vid explained what i needed to know.
Or turn up the volume in the headphones...
This made more sense than anything I've seen or read to date. My installation is rather simple.... an H1001 v2 for cpu cooling only, in a simply cavernous Fractal design R5.
When, or rather, if, you do make shirts PLEASE let us know...I would happily wear it to next LAN!! Love your videos, Arial
Itd be nice if you stated numbers\refed benches for why one thing is better than another, otherwise its hard to know if its true or not
Speaking of temperature is way etter. Why not speaking with data in your hand? I can see only video of somebody talking, talking, and talking .-. no real answer to the youtube title; that case would have benn good for every kind of test..
I did as much research as I could on what 140mm fans to buy and I bought the fractal venturi fans yesterday on ebay, it was very comforting to see them on the intro of this video lol. Thankyou.
Running fan commercial promos, pushing tek syndicate apparel before actually getting into the title of the video? Wow.
Believe it or not theres a method thats not widely known, and thats Pull Pull, both fans pulling heat away from the radiator in 2 directions, it works very well ive tried it. Better still if the rad is mounted at the front you get the best of both worlds heat from the rad is getting pushed out the front and the other fan(s) are pushing air in the case at the same time also you get no dust build up in the fins... If you are using only 2 fans on a 2x120 rad, i highly recommend fitting the rad at the top pushing out, as heat rises.
dat product advertisement i have 12 fab running at 4000 rpm with just a scresw only with open case and it didn't annoy me with little cheap mobile heatphone
Does SP fan go in bottom of radiator and AF fan go on top (outside) for push/pull configuration..???
Anyone know what radiators jay is using cause I need some white ones for my build
I dont see the point of utilizing a Push-Pull configuration anywhere. Its either you push or just pull. Doing a push-pull configuration only wastes space and unnecessary power. Modern vehicles use only the Pull configuration on radiators and condensers because putting another fan for pushing is useless because the same volume of air will pass through the radiator fins regardless. Now, since the same volume of air will pass through the fins, a front mounted radiator will benefit more on a "PULL" configuration, just like on modern cars. Why? Because the fan will directly blow air inside the case, without the radiator fins causing turbulence like in "PUSH" configuration.
I believe pulling in air from the outside will be cooler air, in the pc you have many pc parts making heat, and therefore using that heat to cool your cpu would not be optimal.
Making my first build and this was so helpful! Thanks!
Hey Jay, love you vids. I'm changing cases over to a Fractal R5 (windowed) where I should be able to remove the 5.25 bays and the middle HDD cage, and adding a Corsair H80i GT (so I can make a build outa my old stuff). What do you think is the best setup for this? I was thinking push/pull on the front but I would like the be able to see the rad through the window and don't think I'll be able to like this, however, I'd also like to keep it as sound-proof as possible. What's your thoughts on where I should place the rad and fans? Thanks man.
i think i have a problem, my monitor goes turns off and then back on briefly, out of nowhere sometimes and a lot when load a game up. I can't tell whether its my graphics card (r9 290x tri. 77c under load) or my psu (corsair Rm 750). All of my graphics drivers are updated. I have no idea what it could be but it's really annoying, especially when im watching something or playing games. Any ideas?
That's why you say BRAVO, Jay :D
sp or af fans for push and pull???????
Allah! the radiator, The One that must not be seen...
hello, I first want to introduce my self my YouTube name is garlicbread45 real name is Eric. I just added case fans to my rig. but I would love to hear your thoughts about it am running 5 fans 2 exhaust one is pushing the hot air out on top and second is pushing hot air out the back one blowing cool air in (front of rig) and then I have push and pull for my 120mm radiator. so your thoughts should I just one a push or pull on my radiator and use the other fan as pushing cool air in or use it to pushing hot air out? also I love your vidoes and of course I would like to see any guide vidoes you have or thinking of keep up the great vidoes!!!
plz don't speek like a russian i have bad memories from dota 2 XD
I have waaaay too many liked videos. Eh screw it. I'LL DO IT FOR JAY!!!!!
I actually tried to configure my Nepton 240M in pull. Only to realize I could no longer put my top dust filter back on, because the screws are too high profile. Also installing in pull is much harder, especially with the rubber gasket that comes with the cooler.
Educational ^_^
#INeedHelpAtB
It's a helpful video mr. Jay! Thank you. ?
Another nice informative video Jay. Just a small slight, less rant = more information. Thanks again.
with push/pull surely the fact you are doubling the amount of fans on the rad makes running them at a slower speed redundant in terms of acoustic performance?
Sorry, shrinking too fast? Explain how pls.
I have positive pressure below the gpu and neg pressure above it. gives the gpu plenty of fresh air to the intake and actively takes exhausted air away. it means the overall case pressure is neg so dust is an issue. but my sapphire 390 doesn't go over 65 which is good for an air cooled 390 running in a case with 1 intake fan
you need Datsun 240z!
I imagined myself doing a car's radiator and fans to a pc while watching this video LOL!!!
that intro haha :P
Good info...Tnx! 44c here in the summer, also, a country environment... much dust ! No way to escape it. I think a low, under case intake will pick up dust that naturally falls, and plug a filter quickly. Better to have intake on the front, or back? Maybe a large filter on back where it is not visible ? Exhaust at front where pilot may get the full effect of what is going on inside the case ? :-) ..just thinkin... rc
What about the direction of the fan? Does it matte which side the fan is facing? Like face the side with the sticker this way or that way?
350z or 370z? whoah
Does the radiator heat affect the overall Case temperature or is it negligible because of the fan taking air out?
Such info
I don't care about How my CPU looks or how loud it is as long as it performs better.. PUSH/PULL configuration for the win!! :D
Nice video. Does anybody know if there is something you can buy to raise fans? About the same thickness of a radiator that will make the fans visible through the side window?
+JayzTwoCents what is the case on video 1:10 it is mini white color under microphone
That ad at the front /facepalm I know it's funny. xD
what case is that?
pupupupul pushpullpushhpul
I would do pull for exhaust fans rather than push, the different in air pressure is negligible but by putting it in pull any dust build up will be on the exposed side of the radiator rather than between the fans and radiator.. and therefore easier to clean
I prefer a push push, or pull pull design.
JayzTwoBingoWings
@jayztwocentz I was thinking if you are using 2 SP fans please do let me know.. I was thinking something you can test, I'm really curious about this, since SP fans are good for pushing the air to the radiator and sp is for pulling the air, can you make a video of the following: (please do) 2 SP fans at the bottom of the rad pushing the air 2 AF fans at the top of the rad pulling the air 1. Set up A would be both fans are spinning on the same rpm 2. Set up B would be SP fans are spinning faster than AF fans (since my theory is SP fans works properly on blockage) 3. Set up C would be AF fans are spinning faster than SP fans (for better pulling Please do try I am really a fan on your videos, I've been watching it building my own PC
Great video Jay. I just bought a H110i GT and I think I'll go with a Push config in the top of my corsair carbide air 540 case.
eh 69 dislikes
8:13 an ice cream sandwich
lmao, coconut monkey...we need more of him on the show lol
Interesting I have a 140mm radiator triton and the v21 core so I use push because i cannot get the door back on , I am considering removing it soon and replacing with a swift tech h140x
i do notice a different in noise though. i have a 295x2 rad that is an exhaust. i recently changed it from push (fan on inside of rad) to a pull (fan outside of rad, closer to case grill) and it seemed louder
That opening was fucking hilarious lol.
git~
I don't get the need for complex fan controllers and/or multiple splitters with multi-fan configurations.  Buy good quality high RPM PWM fans, mine are 3000RPM Corsair SP series, connect all the PWM control and one RPM monitor to the MB header, then provide power to the fans direct from the PSU, which is simple enough with a modular PSU.  With 9 fans, 6 of which are running push/pull on a 360mm Alphcool Monsta cooling an IvyBridge CPU and X-Fire 7970s, the fans run at 750-800RPM with the system at idle and are (effectively) inaudible.  During stress testing the fans run at 1200-1400RPM which is audible but not intrusive.  Neither the CPU or the GPU has ever been over 43C.  As an aside, the pump, an EK DDC, is on the same PWM control system.  Disconnecting the PWM control from the MB allows the fans (and pump) to run at full RPM but doesn't assist cooling.  The fans are properly gasketed to the radiator and the gaps between the fans are sealed to ensure the airflow goes through the radiator instead of out between the gaps between the (rather badly designed) frames of the SP fans.  Yes, it means custom cabling, but if you are doing that anyway, it's just as tidy and easy (or easier) to do it this way as any other.
So pretty much, a push/pull with 2 fans at 800rpm is the same as a push with a fan at 1600rpm?
I understand what you are explaining, but what I am not sure of is which way your fans are blowing on the rads? Are you sucking air in with the front and blowing out through the top? The reason why I am asking is I have a water cooler on the way (Sedion 120v) going into my Cooler Master 130 Elite. And I'm trying to figure out if I should be pushing air from inside the case, through the rad to the outside or if I should be pulling air from outside, through the rad, to inside the case. I've never run a water cooler before, so I am unsure how much heat will be generated from the rad considering I have no other fans extracting air from the case. My Antec 620w High Current Gamer has the fan on the top, sucking air into the case from the top and blowing it immediately out the back. So unless I turn the PS around, all I have is passive vents to release air blowing into the case. Is that enough? Would you suggest a push/pull on the rad with the fan currently in the case along with the fan that will come with the cooler? This is my setup... Give me your thoughts on how you would install your PSU and your water cooler, if it were system. Cooler Master Elite 130 (side 80mm fan not installed at the moment) AMD X4 860k Antec 620w high current gamer ASRock FM2A88X-ITX+ 2x 8gb GSkill Ripjaws X Series PC1600 PowerColor R9 270 2g 1s 128gb Intel SSD (mounted under 3.5"bay) 1x 2TB WD Blue HDD (mounted on vertical side bracket) 1x 250gb Samsung EVO 850 (will be mounted on bottom of case beside MB) 1x LG DVD writer (obviously in the 3.5" bay)
I'm really curious as to what would happen if you use push/push or pull/pull. xD
people, dont use push!!! your radiator will be stuffed with dust in about a year. pull doesnt do that...
You always have the best water cooling vids my man - each component with it's own recommendations and basic guide
If you want to have the air flow through the case, or push out of the case, do you have to position your fans in any way? I don't know why but I've read somewhere that the blades positioning determines this.
The commercial was great xD
that face at 0:48 is scary
Great video! I would love to see a smoke video.
Best video on youtube of this topic. Forget Forums, Google image searches, articles. Just watch this Thanks to Jayz!
A good comment from your fellow tech reviewer, Linus Sebastian, he recommends Pull rather than Push as it is then better for the dust management (less build-up, more easy to clean). Also, same comment as I said on other video, the direction of the airflow has only very little impact, front to top or top to front, both OK.
What is the best configuration to mount the fans to cool down a AMD FX-9590 with a Corsair H100i GTX CPU cooler and MSI (2) R9 390X in crossfire inside a Corsair 900D case.
do you NEED the radiators in betwenn? isnt it enough to run the fans the way that they come when you buy the case? like, isnt this a configuration for just custom water cooling? (sorry, for the stupid question... im still a newbie)
Another interesting perspective would be to look at an automotive application in which fans typically will be mounted behind the radiator in a pull configuration. I imagine manufacturers do this because many times you have an AC condenser in front of your rad and when stopped the most effective volume to which you can exhaust your heat would be behind the rad and in front of the engine. Of course in that scenario you're also dealing with much more powerful fans that will draw usually a minimum of 30 amps on their own.
LOL THAT INTRO HAHA
INTAKE OR EXHAUST FOR CPU COOLING RADIATOR...SOME1 JUST TELL ME
you could improve the airflow if you look at the "Bernoulli's principle". Unfortunately, computer case are not designed large enough to fit it you needed space for one or two 200 or better still 240 mm fan´s in a narrowing tube, where at the narrowest point a 120 mm radiator is plugged in In addition you need for each fan a cone for the airflow not to swirl, that no noise is generated,visually similar to a wind tunnel. Unfortunately, I find no suitable image to show what I mean. p.s. I despair at times, to the translator aids. and just because I do not know all the words
Does anyone know what the small white case is?
That intro thou, reminds me of someone
Thank you sooo much. It made it so much easier to understand the process. I tried other videos but this one really helped me understand the process. Thank you.
I plug my fans in pull-pull. Because push-pull is mainstream. ????????
Hey Jay, Random time; What chair is that youre sitting on? Looks comfortable.
Hey +JayzTwoCents what do yu recommend me for a h100i GTX push? or pull?
Hey Jay. I think doing a smoke or something visual with air flow to prove your point about your predictions on air flow, Is necessary. Down right necessary to show us that your experience is true. We are show me people. I'd like to see you make a good prediction like that in this video and visually prove it.
Anyone know what that case is? Thanks
Hehe this video was funny maked me smile ^^, only first minute tho.
I do like pull generally simply because over the years I have noticed that dust accumulates much less at the radiator than in push configurations every time I've done it. Anyways, Great Video! Much agreed on the Cooling Differences! :)
Nice lecture... I plan on at some point going from an AIO to a custom build.. Very informative.. Thank you!
Push set ups will make it much harder to clean, gathering dust, and reducing cooling performance. That goes for push/pull as well obviously.
ok, so if the fan is in top of the case then the radiator, will itbe ok for the fan to be pull? so the fans is sucking hot air from inside the case though the radiator to the outside, will this be ok?
"I need help at bee" ROFL - best comm ever.
Should I balance the ammount of intake / exhaust fans? With my case that'd be 2 intake on the front and 1 on the bottom then 2 exhaust on top and 1 on the back. I'm just not so sure about the bottom fan, Will it really intake that much air being on the bottom?
So, you always want the front fans to pull or push air INTO the case and the other fans in the case to exhaust the air OUT?  Am I right on this?  If you added a radiator to the bottom of the case, would you exhaust or intake?
1:29 I really like that voice XD
Hey @JayzTwoCents Unfortunately I don't get to watch your videos often, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how far you've come on your weight loss and fitness. Ride safe, bro.
we need to see this
hey @JayzTwoCents will you be getting the inwin 909 case?
I am really interested in what is that white case Jay has in this video. I'm kinda bored by my old black semi-plastic mid tower and looking to buy a nice, white, full metal case with simple, yet stylish design(for that I mean no fancy stuff like glowing fans and neon lights all over the place).  Desires are: No PSU, no 9000 fans(3 or 4 places for fans is enough, 2 at the top, one in the back and another in the front), no 9000 drive bays, a bay for DVD R/RW, few USB ports, compatibility with MicroATX and ATX motherboards.  I know this isn't exactly a place to post this, but maybe somebody knows such a case which will not cost hundreds of dollars, but will fit my desires?
Liked just for the intro. Just perfect!
more videos about airflow and ideal positions for fans with setting up fan curves ohh and smoke and explosions (optional) :) cool video i like all the watercooling content you make :)
Love your videos! just wanted to say, your weight loss has been nothing short of incredible and I'm really happy for you =)
Havent watched your videos in a while, ur looking great man, dat weight loss
Most confusing video title 2k15 xD
Love the Tek Syndicate intro xD
dust on pull config in the top of the case is better to clean
i totally get this but wanna see a smoke demostration :v
Yes, please do a visual example of what talked about in this video. I would like to make my own computer and knowing little to nothing, seeing a visual example will be really helpful. Thank you! C:
what keyboard is that with the W A S D in orange? (can you post a amazon link to it?)
that should be nice to see how the fan work and proper placement and the different.
can you do the inscent test?
Anyone know coconut monkeys headset in the commercial?
Please keep up with the information density!
Nice car Jay, damn
On the topic of fans etc. I find it so strange that some brands actually decide to put arrows on their fans to indicated the fans rotational direction and airflow. What kind of people posses the capacity to operate a computer and not figure out the fans rotation and airflow direction. I am truly appalled. However as to Push vs Pull, I use always use pull. Simply because it makes cleaning the radiators from dust easier. Having the radiator fins unobstructed by fans means that you can simply run it over with your vacuum cleaner hose.
Hey,love your videos have a question... in a Push/pull setup,what is the best  "ST/AF","AF/ST" or is better use same fans?or doesnt have any diference?
2:30 What beginning? I have been building PCs for decades, and don't know anything about building water cool PC. So where to start?
Hey @JayzTwoCents You're thinner every week. Watching your older videos and the new ones, it's like going from Barnacules to Linus.
This is going to be a long comment. So in your setup you had the two rads I believe the front was pull and the top was push. Now because of the heat being produced in the computer case, might it be possible for the rad on the top to get a slight decrease in performance do to it pushing the hot air through the rad. I thought of this and would really like an answer. Thank you. And keep up the great view!
@JayzTwo Cents I'd really like to see the demo with smoke or incense. Not just out of curiosity for the airflow on your builds but I'd like the reference as I adjust my fan configuration.
@JayzTwoCents  Yes plz make a in depth video about exhaust/intake with smoke etc. Ty
What about a rad sandwich? Would one get better performance with say 2x 30 mm thick rads in a push / pull - push configuration vs 1x 60 mm thick rad?
great video! very informative, i would like to see the smoke video to show airflow, that wud be really cool !
More videos about airpressure within the case and air cooling would be cool!
DAMN jay you've lost a lot of weight ;)
more water cooling info love these videos.
Hey Jay what did you do with that Ultrawide monitor you reviewed?
Pull still has the advantage that Dust doesnt accumulate as much between the fan and the rad.
Nice fucking car!
what headset was your friend using
Alright, I seem to understand this Push, Pull and Push / Pull , but in a push set up, do you install the fans backwards?
Would love to see more on the airflow, maybe using some smoke to show the flow?
spoiler alert: push / pull, doesnt matter. do as you like.
Get the oneplus TWO invite here: https://oneplus.net/ca_en/invites?kolid=2AXW02
The intro was funny.
I found this very helpful, thanks :)
What's changed?
+1 for smoke video! I'd love to see it!
great video...actually learned alot.
Good stuff
Lost a lot of weight Jay! :)
Looking good Jay. I hope you continue to stay underweight and live healthy. Also, the video was really informative for my upcoming water cooler
+Jayztwocents Final Fantasy 7 called and they want their logo back.  :)
Jay should make ads, that one was super funny xD
What case is that?
Hey wow, you actually put some thought into your ads, unlike Linus who seems to hate everybody sending him free shit.
>can't hear what your saying with headphones directly on your ears >CAN hear the doorbell ring perfectly, no problem wat
Hey! JayzTheW0rld!
Holy shit a nearly quarter of an hour lecture of you just sitting and talking? Where are the numbers that back up your assertion that these are basically all equal? I believe you, but the format needs a change of scenery and some objective comparisons, rather than a dry call to authority.
Love your videos. Knowledge is power. Keep it up
http://pcpartpicker.com/user/raptorjesus713/saved/qyrscf hey guys im a pc noob but i decided i wanted to build myself a custom pc with the help of some of my friends. tell me if all this is good or bad or overkill etc thanks so much
Very informative. Thanks Jay!
has jay ever reviewed the cougar fans? they always seem to have good reviews has he done a top 5 or 10 120mm fan video?
Thank you for this video this helps me out a lot.
I'm about ready to do my setup but I don't know if I want to spend $ on waterblocks for my 2 780ti. Thinking of selling them and getting a single 980ti and watercooling that. Hmm
i've been thinking about a setup and would like your thoughts. next year i'm building a water cooled setup with the coolermaster stacker. putting my rads in a lower case away from my hardware. i have some TEC (peltiers) laying around and was thinking about sealing the case with my hardware then using the peltiers to cool the inside of that case. i know it won't help much in overclocking but just an idea
I thought push&pull configurations adds resistance to the rad, that's why I never used pus&pull. This might be the reason why some big CPU radiators sometimes have 2, even 3 fans.  Also, there are some low RPM low-profile fans that are half the thickness of a normal fan. So using 2 of those low-profile fans seems the same (in terms of thickness) as using one normal fan, but with the advantage of having both push&pull configuration, so basically, no compromises.
The intro made me crack up
What jay ment was dont let shity headsets ruin the experience lol
Please don't recommend people to use rads as exhaust. This recycles air that's already run through a radiator and heated. rear exhaust fan + psu exhaust is plenty
Can someone please give me the name of the case he is using?
when he said push/pull fans i started bleeding out of my ears
Looking forward to the static pressure video.Thanks
Will there not be a lot more dust clogging in push than in pull?
You're the man!
thanx jay i was gonna change my fans trying to drop temps but now i know it doesnt matter and i have good flow  keep up these kinds of vids
Main decider for me between push and pull is some fans (like the AP15's I have) make more noise when you have obstructions near the intake.. so they make a more tonal noise above say 1600rpm or so when in pull compared to push.
I have a question about push/pull and mixing fans.   I got the Corsair H105 for my old I7-950 about a month ago and have it setup to exhaust out the top as push/pull.  Here's the thing with it.  All the fans are very loud, especially the stock H105 fans.  So I set it up as 2x Corsair SP120 fans, pushing air at 80% fan speed, and the two stock H105 fans as pulling running at 60% to cut noise down.  Does this setup potentially cause any problems with air flow?  As for performance it seems to be good, but every little bit will help in these hot California summers.
go for the smoke test Jay btw, nice vids, keep it comming
would like to ask about fans such as NF-F12 PWM fans. They seem to be designed more for push? does it actually matter?
So, would a radiator be benificial to use even if air cooling? That's what he made it sound like to me.
as ever, i'll be content with using Pull for any Radiator. because it's almost like cheating with how easy it is to clean your Radiators then. a single wipe with a damp Paper Towel and you're done. it's too easy!
that commercial though
where can i find the radiator you are using? i want full white radiatorsbut i have only find black and white
I want an opinion on what cpu cooler I should get. Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler - $25.98 NZXT Kraken X61 106.1 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler - $125.89 Corsair H100i 77.0 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler - $94.99 i have an Intel i7 4790k
Please do a video about the airflow of skunkworks with the smoke and everything! I am really interested in that kind of stuff and I'm always looking forward to perfect the airflow in my case! :D
nice vid!
you have turned skinnier!

Hello
but what about push push and pull pull, where the directions of 2 fans are either facing each other or away from each other. if it cancels out, wouldn't it start a cooling vortex that also rains cookies?
When I was building my loop, it was recommended that I run pull since push can result in dust build up between the fans and rad which require removing the fans to clean while pull does not.
Sometimes i get bored with the subject, sometimes i dislike what @JayzTwoCents is talking about, sometimes i just don't care what his video is about. But you gotta love the guy's production/video quality
Holy shit jay you lost a lot of weight! Congratz!!! :)
what if it was push push or pull pull ? xD
How should i control fan rpm's via software? I have 3 extra EK furious vardars (3000 rpm version) and it sounds like a jet taking off.
Dude, you look healthy now.  I saw some of your earlier vids and you are wayyyyy skinnier.  You work out bro?
Thanks for the video jay! I've recently just found your channel and I find your videos to be much more personal with the viewer compared to some other tech youtubers. I have an NZXT H440 case and This video explained a crap ton of how I wanted to have my fans and why I should have them! Just a quick question though. In skunk works you have 3 intake 5 exhaust at the top like you were saying, but what RPM's do you have your intake and exhaust fans set at?
I'd be interested to see the effects of radiators on airflow!
i agree with you on most accounts here, although there are exceptions to the rule. for example there are tests that point towards fans with low static pressure performs better in push than pull, you also have fans like the eloops that have noise issues when set in pull if the  distance to the radiator is to low
Nice job explaining the various configurations. I've been saying I'll water cool my next machine for about 10 years but end up air cooling each time. I found everything you said here to make perfect sense and it should be easy to understand for anyone looking to get into water cooling (like I STILL am). Thanks Jay.
I'n thinking about building a small gaming rig. It's been a while since  I build a computer and this video help me a lot. Can someone tell me the name of the small white case showcased on this video?
Do a series like "Jay's school" because that's what this video felt like...
Cool with Tek Syndicate
You sound like the giant from Twin Peaks
I would assume pull would heat up the fan motor a bit more but that's all.
Excellent video with a simple explanation that even a dimwit like me can understand.
my actual confusion is whether or not you make the radiator fans as exhaust or intake if it is mounted on top. Some people say if you make the fans as exhaust hot air will blow through the radiator and make the cpu temp go higher, on the other hand making it an intake will make airflow on the case all wrong as heat rises. So which one is better?
Man that front splitter and canards to really well with the 350z
Good to have you Jay on youtube to answer this "simple" questions about quantity of fans, static pressure and all that stuff.
I would not use any combination involving (push or pull) with a radiator as an intake tho, that would just heat up your case and other components. Anything with a radiator needs to be an exhaust if yea ask me.
Lovin' the new intro. Nice and minimalist!
Air Pressure video would be awesome!
Good vid...good explanation of thermal cooling.  I would love to see the demo of Positive pressure systems...using smoke would be a benefit.
like the new intro (y)
Is Push pull not a debate of noise ? Because in my wood case, which isn't watercooled, when my pull/intake fan is in the case it's vey noisy. But when it's out of the case, like the push/extractor fan, it's less noisy... Someone agree ?
I am just trying to learn about about computer building and don't quite understand why you would have  a radiator on the exhaust side, aren't you just passing warm air through the cooling fins rather than cold?
Liked your old intro better.
lol
I'd love to see a video about case pressure with smoke!
Wow, check out that weight loss. You look great Jay! Keep up the good work!
LOL that intro tho
I think doing some examples of postive case pressure would be awsome jay.
@JayzTwoCents please talk about optimal cases (non Case Labs xD) for water cooling. The most roomy,  radiator capable, etc etc ones. Thnx for ur amazing vids
Hell yeah I'd love to see some testing with smoke or vapor to see what happens under different pressure situations (pos or neg) Keep up the good work Jay!!
One item I have never heard addressed is if the heat coming off the radiator affects the performance or lifespan of a fan.  If a fan is in a pull position then it is getting a fair amount of heat and with the many different types of fan motors out there does the heat really affect the fans and how much?  Also with the resistance the fans encounter pushing/pulling air does that affect the lifespan?
I thought that was an ad placement for a better mic. Lol
Oh god Jay, Logan's gonna sue your ass. lol :)
Jay, I want to see you build a new version of your old "ghetto water coolers" Your the man on water cooling. Apparently you did this in the past.  A  "Water Festivus" for the rest of us ! :)
MY IDEA! THE INCENSE WAS MY IDEA!!!!
What about push/push and pull/pull?! Only 3/5ths of a review...
I'm new to radiations and liquid cooling and very much appreciate the explanation about pull vs push. I understand about positive pressure but I can't seem to understand why would you want to pull hot air from the front radiator into the case and use that hot air to cool the top radiator ? Would it be better for that case to have front airflow fans, push or pull radiator on top as exausht for GPU and single rad exhaust on the back? I very much appreciate the feedback. Love the channel!
Hi Jay (or whoever is reading this),. I would like someone's opinion on whether to get an Intel or AMD based processor. (BEFORE you respond and fanboy about anything, please be sure you are unbiased), as well as options to get cheaper, equal performance hardware :D Here are the two setups:  __Intel based:__ (http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/GGY7bv) $1857 Intel i7-4790k 4.0GHz (4 core) Swiftech H220-X liquid CPU cooler Asus SABERTOOTH z97 MK.2 ATX motherboard G.Skill Ripjaws X Series DDR3-1600 ram 240GB OCZ 100 (SSD)  Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200rpm HDD Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 4GB WINDFORCE 3X NZXT H440 case (silent) EVGA SuperNOVA GS 550W 80+ Gold Windows 10 __AMD based:__ (http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/Fd6xvK) $1717 AMD FX9590 4.7-5.0 GHz (8 core) Swiftech H220-X liquid CPU cooler Asus M5A99FX PRO R2.0 ATX motherboard G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR3-1866 ram 240GB OCZ 100 (SSD)  Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200rpm HDD Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 4GB WINDFORCE 3X NZXT H440 case (silent) EVGA SuperNOVA GS 550W 80+ Gold Windows 10 THANKS :)
Love the TekSyndicate intro
Will high airflow intake fans against high static pressure exhaust fans create negative pressure?
Shirts are nice, same guy makes Paul and Kyles shirts. As far as push vs pull goes, i use push on my H101i on my 750D case . for one thing it looked better, another thing is that even though i have a 4770k @ 4.4 it NEVER goes over 51c under heavy load, however the ambient temp in the room is usually 25-26 c. One thing you did not mention about pull only, it actually heats up the fans, think about it, the motor will get hotter.  another nice vid Jay, #moreNick
Can you do a video on DX12 or i7 benefits in the future? :)
This was very helpful, thank you for this.  I'm looking to switch to liquid cooling in my Corsair 250D, but wasn't sure where to start.  Looking forward to further discussion on this topic.
wow Jay you lost so much weight already, good job!
Wow , good arnold impression
I see what you did there!
yep jay do the smoke thing always wanted to know how to check for positive over negative
Love the new intro Jay
Im sure he couldnt hear you with his headphones on because his fans were too loud, retard wow.
Which is best for a 240mm rad? Front intake or top exhaust? Not sure top exhaust will be a good idea since it'll take hot air from the case through the rad. On the other hand front intake will blow the hot air from the rad back to the case. Not sure also a good idea for the gpu. Little bit confused.
That "promo video" or what you call it.. The one with the B and the fans, that was fun to watch compared to your normal "here is a product i get sponsored with" you know what i mean (Not complaining or anything, just saying do more "sketch" "promo videos" :) )
That intro ad XD
Hei Jay. I would really like to see a vid about how to PLAN and MAKE a complete custom water loop. How do I know where I need to cut and bend hard tubing? How can I cut hard tubing without any special tools? How do I make a good drain system? What else do I need to keep in mind? I would really appreciate it if you could make something about this topic. Keep up the good content :)
Jay!!!! Omg???? i drive a 350z too!!!!!
Jayz the best
As usual, very well presented. Yes, we would like more!
Jay, before I can continue watching your video I have to say I'm so jealous of your car.
Smoke them please!
While there is no difference between push and pull in terms of cooling, there is a difference in the amount of effort it will take to clean the dust that accumulates.  With pull, the dust will get caught on the fins of the radiator away from the fan and be easy to wipe off with a cloth but while in push the dust will again get caught on the fins but it will be between the fan and radiator so in order to clean it you would have to remove the fans.  This is just one other thing to think about when making the decision between push and pull.
Hi JayZ, nice video. I have Define R5 case, and i'm wondering since i want to put Nepton 280L water cooling in it, is front position good to put it, and which setup should i use, push or pull? Your advice will be very helpful.
I lolled when i saw the ad at the start...great job!! This way advertising is the best way to do it
dat advertisement xD
video with fire would ROCK!
Wait, did jay lose some weight? That shirt makes Him look lighter than usual
Do the demonstration ! :O
Please to the case pressure with smoke!!!
hahahahahahaha that ad was the best one yet xD
Hey Jay, good video as usual, love your work, keep it up. Btw, you're a bit wrong, you say push is equal to pull, it depends on the fan also. I'm not totaly sure but confident about what i'm gonna write. I have read that nb-eloop were designed to be used in push configuration, pull will cause a abnormal noise and a degradation of the performance and the lifetime of the fan. For other brands, like the ek vardar and fractal venturi it's said they have been design to work both with pull or push config so they are fine in both situation.  Still a great video and a well explained tutorial for watercooling rookies ! :)
all that skin tho >.<
Experiments with smoke for positive/negative pressure??? Bring it on Jay!!! Stuff like this is rare and I would shurely enjoy a video about it!!! Thumbs up if you other watercooling freaks agree and demand the same!!! :)
HE NEEDS HELP AT B
Jay, would an i5 4790k and MSI GTX 970 be enough for games like CS:GO and battlefield 4?
He looks like a confused alien.
Hey Jay, any thoughts on a video for whether or not you should upgrade to Windows 10?
I would like to see more on positive and negative airflow using the fans.
btw, first time i mounted the push-pull on the h100i, i fuck*d up the side of the fans so i basically had a pull-pull config, makin it a mess of a turbolence in the radiator...on my 3570k@ 4.2ghz it meant +10° compared to the correct config. so almost 50° in idle(very hot summertime) vs almost 40° in idle(similar weather conditions.) ;)
hello ! I have a question:can I Crossfire a radeon 5850 HD with a r9 390 ?
DAT SPONSOR SPOT! LOL! GREAT VIDEO JAY!
PLEASE HELP! Great video as allways. Love your vids. I was wondering if you might be able to help me with my system. I don`t know if you are reading comments, if not i would appreciate it if anyone else here could come with some ideas. I have AMD Phenom 2 x4 965 BE cpu in Asus Crosshair 4 Formula mobo and when i try to install 16gig 1600 mhz it wont boot up even when using the memOK button on my mobo. The weird thing is when i install 1x4 of these rams it boots up and everything is ok. But when i put in another module i get this: 8gig installed,4gig usable. So my pc reserves 4gig to hardware reserve. Any idea guys?
If you have the 240 rad blowing into the pc wont that bring excess heat inside?
little question gus : do you think my system will have a balanced airflow? in intake, i have : 2 hi speed ones and one hi pressure but with a rad on it in outtake i have : 1 hi speed fan and 2 normal fans wath do you guys think?
my two cents..on a HAF XB (bulkier case ever)with a H100i, i got 2 pairs of 120 noctua fan in push pull outside to the inside. It works best for my setup.
heard you talking about the 350z on the techtalk...now that i see it i understand why you are so proud, its stunning beautiful..and its way more radical looking than the 370, the shapes are cleaner, more pure. love it.
I understood everything that you explained Jay but as a water cooling noob, why would you pull the front radiators hot air into your system over your motherboard and graphics card as opposed to pushing it out the front and use the bottom & rear as intakes ? Great stuff as always...
You forgot something important Jay! In pull configuration, removing dust is WAY easier. In push you have to remove the fan to clean the radiator wich is a hazzle. In pull you can just take a strip of packing tape and stick it on the radiator, then when you pull it off it's covered in dust.
Yes please do examples for positive pressure etc.. Excellent idea to use smoke/incense.
Jay you are the man. The smoke and stuff to see how the fans work would be awesome.
Yes please, more videos on cooling/airflow!
Like the water cooling educational vids.
Great vid jay I would like to see an airflow vid on the define S both watercolled and air cooled to see what is the best setup for it
Smoke demonstration would be awesome
Thanks Jay.....explained very well
Hey JayZ, nice video man, again. I need your opinion. I have Define R5 case, and i want to put Cooler Master Nepton 280L water cooling in front, and, can you tell me is that good position, or should i put it on top and what setup to have, push or pull. Thanks.
can u do a video of what sli or crossfire actually does
I kept thinking you were saying "allah" at 5:32, took me a few replays to realise you probably meant the French "a la" lol
A smoke visualizer for air flow would be a pretty helpful Video please :)
Awesome job on the weight loss! What a difference from last year to now :)
You drive a 350z on xxr D:
I have a 300 cfm intake on my side panel am i doing it right ? :D
Maybe could you do a video on the fan control software you use?
Jays this was a very Good video man :) Very informative :) All tho i have not done a custom loop my self lol Don't even know where to buy the fittings or anything
dat arm flab
Did Linus not do a video a while back saying to only do pull because push can trap dust in the radiator?
That intro though.
The only difference is how long is your fan gonna last. The fan that is pulling hot air trough itself is gonna have heat on the bearings and last that much shorter. Small difference but K.
Yes , we would like Jayz to show more example how air flow to turn down the temperature. THANKS.
omg you drive a 350z?!?! Can You make a Video about it? :)
Thanks for this video but how you control speed of fan with program or controller??
loved that intro..made me laugh
What headphones/headset is that
Why would you blow hot air into the case from the front radiator. The top radiator gets hotter in that case ..
The tek?
0:47 made my day :D
No difference? What about dust build up?
If that Nissan is yours then please make a video about it :D, oh god it was so sexy~
dat 350z tho <3
Your looking really well @JayzTwoCents those bike ride's must be doing the trick ;-)
I run a i7-4771 at 3.5Ghz with a Corsair h100i with noctuas sp fans in pull at about 250RPM at idle and get about 35°C. Under extended gaming it goes to 52°C max. Then the fans are somewhere at 600-800
Much like anything that has constant 'resistance' in its name (electronics, plumbing, hvac)...push and pull don't matter. One thing I want to see is comparison of push+pull to pushpush or pullpull (same fans, same resistance, should be same result).
One thing Jay failed to mention or at least I didn't hear him say it, correct me if I'm wrong, is that when you use a push configuration dust is much more prone to get trapped on the rad between the fan and the rad. This is why I choose to use pull 99% of the time. Unless like in your case you go for aesthetics, in which case you'd rather put in work so it looks better.
in my H440 i have a kraken X41 with a thick rad with 2 corsair high static pressure fans in push pull i actually saw a big increase in cooling. the thickness wasnt an issue because the rad is mounted in the front and it cant be seen through th window. i didnt have a clearance issue either, as far as the acoustics it is dead silent. i actually got scared when i turned it on and heard nothing (i had a really loud pc before i upgraded) and my fridge in the kitchen is the only thing i can hear when i dont have my ceiling fan on
What headset model is the triton?
smoke!!!
The Teksyndicate beginning was really interesting!
Excellent vid, so much info condensed! Also you're looking thinner by the day!
Hey @JayzTwoCents, where is the GTX 980 vs AMD R9 390X?
That flabby arm skin reminds me of Click.
I love those fractal ads :'D
love the ad! :D
Love your nissan!!
Oh you got a new chair :P Is there a review comming on that, too?
TeiSyndiCents
great video thanx, lerned a lot!
Here is a question. You have the two front fans on pull on those radiators. Wouldn't that be pulling hot air into the case?  I am sure you will say that you have more than enough exhaust fans to make up for it, but are the aesthetics really worth it? Also, and maybe I missed a video somewhere, why do you need four radiators? Sorry. five radiators. I ask these questions in all sincerity. I love your videos. (Forgive me if this was said before. There are a lot of comments down there and I don't have time to go through them all.)
Instructions unclear, dick got stuck in Cpu Socket
nice car
Hey Jay, what's happening at caselabs? Only cases in black now ??
Just as I was wonder what way to have my fans on my rad you make this video... how convenient!
Sooo, push-pull is the best cooling configuration, if you have plenty of space?
That intro was perfect
Jay i love you and your channel! Im just trying to make your life a bit better but i may be stepping out of my zone by saying this and im sorry if it offends you in any way. Anyways, you seem respond alot to the negative comments and i think you would be more pleased or happier, not to say youre not either of those but you replying to the mean comments is literally only making them happy and giving them what they wanted. I understand trying to put people in their place when they are rude but that just simply doesnt work on the internet, youtube especially. Im 99.99% sure you already know this but theres always that small chance with everything. :)
Nize Nizzan 350Z JayZ =)
I heard push configuration was the best, so I went with a push-push configuration, yet my temperatures reach up to 80C, can someone help?
Aren't those fans attached to that radiator in the front of the case blowing in hot air? Wouldn't that reduce cooling inside your case? Then the top radiator fans blowing hot air to cool the radiator on top?
It's funny because Americans don't understand the metric system.
Like for the ad at the beginning :D
u look good jay, and nice car & video
TL:DW; it doesn't matter^^
i want tea, no i don't see any trouble at b, no i said i want tea!, yes i pay my fees drives over to my friend i want tea, ooooohhh.... that's what you were saying, yes, so can i have some tea now? Oh sorry, i don't drink tea. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
@JayzTwoCents is that actually your 370z? Holy shit that is nice
I understand you. I love your channel keep up the good work
The parity between (single) push vs. (single) pull has been well documented in a few different places.  If folks won't believe simple hard data, no point debating them. I would however be interested to see some temp./air-flow ratios compared on push-pull stacks vs. one-side-only fans -- i.e. examples of exactly HOW MUCH rpms can be cut down by adding a second set of fans on 30mm and 45mm radiators.  (I sort of assume anything thicker than 45mm rads need either push/pull by default, or REALLY high rpm/pressure fans, which defeats the purpose of water-cooling, i.e. too noisy).  I think the key to this question is fin density differences between different rads.  (And of course any aluminum-fin radiators need higher fin-density and/or MUCH higher fan speeds to keep up with good copper-fin rads.) Also, a visual smoke-flow demo on Skunkworks, would be really cool to demonstrate the flow-balance issues (incl. differing rpm settings) you were describing.
Hahaha thats awesome that intro lol
Hey thanks for the video, but i would like it if you did do a video on the positive and negative presure. I have NZXT switch 810 case and I am running a 240 rad with push pull config for intake. And also I hve a 360 rad in push pull config on top for exhuast. Is it better to have more fans for intake or exhuast? Can you do a video to show which is better. Keep up the great work....
Love the intro. Nice car btw.
1, ur awsome! 2, Sweet video! 3, your car is freaking awsome!
What are some good 140mm air flow fans?
You copied their music. Now convert to linux. Or else.
ok having the top as exhaust = running already hot air though your radiator?? ps Want pressure vids!
is 120mm radiator enough to cool quad core cpu?
dayum jay, what car was that?
nice z cameo
Great intro and one of the best commercials i have ever seen. also great how to.
may I say from my experience and from web there is little difference/ advantage between pull vs pull. Basically if you use pull configuration, you will gather dust on the other side of fans, what is easier to clean than having push configuration and you gather dust between fans and radiator and then having to take them down to clean dust. But it's only little advantage, I still use push/pull config on both loops :) great video.
Honestly, the only way you should set up your fans is pulling air through the rad. Let me explain- when you have air pushing through the rad, any dust will get caught between the fins and the fan/radiator. How do you clean the properly? You need to take off the fans. Yea. If you just do pull, the dust settles on the opposite side of the radiator where you can get a hoover or compressed air and clean it easily. I would always go with Jayz recommendation but in this case it's just not practical. The temperature difference is not much anyway and it saves you a LOT of hassle. My current setup with water-cooling will have a positive air pressure, 4 fans on a bottom rad pulling, 4 fans on a top rad also pulling and two intake fans. All filtered to limit the dust in the case. As I said and so did Jay, push or pull make almost no difference so... go with pull to save time.
Damn that car is sexy, is it yours jay?
Ooooor, you air cool the whole rig and have it dead silence and cheaper. Just sayin'...
You own a 350z?! nice. Twin turbo model? whats done too it?
Wouldn't the best option be to have both rads as intake? Then you wouldn't be exposing the second rad to the firsts rads heat. Also you have the PSU fan that will be exhausting air as well so you'll still have even more exhausts even if you add the 3rd rad to the bottom.
I wil l admit the only way I do mine is pull. It cme down to cleaning. It's so mm ice easier to clean the dust out in a pull configuration then a push. Personal preference and h ok neatly I tested all way and no found no difference in temperatures.
Nice video. Note that the temperature of the air pulled through the radiator matters, so the one mounted on the front provides maximum cooing on the radiator but can heat up the ambient temperature inside the case. For balance cooling, mounting it on top where the hottest air are expelled is what I prefer.
1:18 insert dick joke
when i heard the music i knew it in a heart beat and than yelled" TekSyndicate" am i the only one that did that?
vlog for your Nissan please
how did you lose weight so quickly? what has been your process please let me know
I have one fan pushing and one pulling through my 240mm rad, swag
I'm building a PC this summer and as the collection of my parts come close to complete, I was wondering how I should set up my fans on an NZXT H440 with a 240mm radiator. A video on getting neutral or positive air pressure with radiators would be awesome.
Smoke and incense please! ^_^
h???e???l?l??o¯ ?ca??n? y?o?u ?r?ea??d? t??h?i??´s???
losing weight like a boss
Hey jay, so I have a question... I totally understand the push pull with rads. I personally run SLI titanX Hybrids. They each have a 120MM rad/120mm fan attached. When installing them, I put them on the top of my case as a push config.. I was going to put them on the front of the case as a pull but I thought that because the rad is meant to expel the heat, that using a pull config would just be bringing a ton of extra heat into my case. But I see that youre using a pull config on the front of this build... Wont pulling the heat in to the case through the rad increase the ambient temperature inside the case and therefor heat up the compnents more?
Oh and good job on the weight loss. You really dropped it off fast. Seems like yesterday you were a fluffy man :P
Triton AX720 Pros. Old models? I loved that headset. Triton's were my first headset.
what case is that?? the little white one??
What is the better config in my Enthoo Luxe? The Enthoo Luxe has dust filters at the top, bottom and front. If I would switch the rear to intake, I would buy an aftermarket 140mm dust-filter. People seem to favor the top as exhaust due to two reasons: - Most of the dust build-up is at the top, if the top is configured as intake it will pull the dust into the case. - Hot air physically rises, when the top is set as exhaust its performance will profit from this. // 1 // Top: 3x eLoop Fans in Push on top of a 360mm Radiator, Intake. Rear: 1x 140mm Fan, Exhaust. Front: 3x 120mm Fan, Intake (two at the front grill, one attached to the hdd cages). OR // 2 // Top: 3x eLoop Fans in Pull on top of a 360mm Radiator, Exhaust. Rear: 1x 140mm Fan, Intake. Front: 3x 120mm Fan, Intake (two at the front grill, one attached to the hdd cages). I've currently got it configured like in Option 1, but I'm still waiting for my 980 Ti G1 Gaming (since 2 weeks) which is why I can't really test the system.
hey jay, can i use air flow fans if i only do pull config?
That intro where you drive to his house. Lol! That made my day! I need help at B!
That intro was great. Great vid as always!
Name (that i already said last video) TOXIC SNOW!!!! Plz hit the like so jay will see And plz mention my name :cool deeeeee kind
would be great to see the examples of positive pressure... :)
Nice car @JayzTwoCents
You get a thumbs up just for the sketch comedy bit. :D
Concise. Thanks for mentioning the use of incense as a flow guide; I never thought about that.
i LOVE the intro... i like it much better than the old one. it feels retro and just. good like
What case is that? I currently have an InWin 901 and want to upgrade...
"Push-pool"
Damn Jay, you are looking great!
that car :(
Would totally love to see some case airflow pressure videos. I usually have to do a monthly cleaning in my case to ckean up a lot of built up dust. Could just be my pkace is messy, but doubtful. Could be negative airflow, dunno. Would be nice to find out.
def loved this. i would find more airflow stuff interesting. still havent nailed that knowledge down on my builds. I'd also like to learn more about RAM. specifically when OC'ing, andthe meaning of all the specs in RAM cards. (i still dont understand timing numbers)
Hey jaystwocents I'm trying to buy a 200$ graphics card Sapphire Radeon R9 270X Video Card - 4GB GDDR5, PCI-Express 3.0 (x16), Overclocked - 11217-04-20G but I might need a new processor because it's only dual core do you think it is needed to upgrade from dual to an quad or 8 core I only have 320$ by the way please help if u don't read this that would suck but it's highly possible so if you do thank you and please help!
Typical american to call things something as push-pull. Im just thinking Who would make a push-push or pull-pull configuration? Okay, so why not call it a radiator with two fans on?
thx for the info it was great
Holy crap you got thin, Nice one dude :)
Nice Z :)
more please!
Only 40 secs in and love the effort put behind this video. Awesome job !
jay, no homo, but DAMN YOU SLIMMED DOWN...looking back at the video from project redmist's build vlog the change is just night and day!..
Dose anyone know where to get fan screws for a corsair aio
I am probably getting a new pc soon and was thinking of water cooling it so these videos are going to help. I don't know if you know a joe Rafferty or how ever you spell his name but he is helping me with some of the parts.
umm, this video rocked.
Yay 370Z!
How can you still hear the fans while wearing headphones? Lol, still a good skit tho
Am I the only one who thought the push pull config looked like an oreo?
2 of my favourite youtubers in a video. :) wish you were on the tek more often. also great video. will you ever continue this as a series? like howtobasicwatercool ?
Please do the demo with smoke! that's going to be really useful, I just put my H60 on a Push Pull configuration, and the amount of noise that my system gain is crazy. Going back to push configuration.
dat fairlady tho D:
Been waiting for you to do a video on this very topic for quite awhile. Thanks Jay!
I think the smoke example would be pretty cool and informative.
Maybe im strange but i kept getting distracted by the arm jiggle...
@JayzTwoCents 0:42 350Z Teaser!
please go back to your music bro
You drive a sick ass 350Z...I'm so jelly
god damn, you're looking very healthy man, grats
Would it be better go to SP Push and AF Pull?
Thanks for this video! I finally got a clear answer on push vs. pull. Thanks @JayzTwoCents !
Dat fan commercial, tho! :)
Lol, best intro yet.
Sorry, I am rather new to this whole thing. I know that this is not really something to worry about, but could you do something on case lighting? LED fans don't quite cut it.
350z Dawm !
Im getting a computer a week from now but i wanna water cool it and not spend so much money (OC my FX-6300) Is there any brand that comes with every part you need? Radiator, pump, tubing, etc. I dont wanna spend more then $100. A little over $100 is fine but not to crazy. :-)
Yay for Zweihänder! Better link for the music: https://zweihander.bandcamp.com/
I'd love a video on calculating how much resistance a radiator is going to do!
you would want your fans away from the vents so push will have them behind the radiator this will help cut down on noise a bit :) , but JayzTwoCents is 100% correct push / pull has no effect on cooling :) . I like sealing my fans with hot glow to make sure there is no air leak
Push cooling = pull cooling.  I GET IT. It's been said a million times. That argument should be over by now, as stated. The experiments have been repeated over and over, and we need to move on. In particular, we need to talk about a couple other things. First, I often hear that pull is better because it's easier to clean the dust off the rad without a fan covering the dusty side. And then there's noise, another prime consideration in building. Does putting the fans behind the rad in the case reduce noise significantly? The merits of these arguments should be discussed rather than rehashing old debates.
YESS!!! omg that intro got me LMFAO!!! i love the tek! ugh yesss 10/10 intro!!!!
right arm is flabby enough. very distracting.
i dont use a fans on my systems radiators, i use a small child with a banana leaf
Ok so I need some help. I have a pc case that has two fans on the side panel of the case and one of those fans will not give me clearance on my cpu cooler. Should I take off that fan or get a low profile cpu and leave the fan on as an extra intake fan?
Hi @JayzTwoCents I need your help about some issues, if you or somebody can help me I'll be grateful. First of all, I'm sorry for my english, I'm from Argentina and english it's hard for me sometimes, so I hope you can understand me. My 'porblem' is about the NZXT Phantom 820 because as you may know that case got a fan on the top (a big one) and I want to buy a H100i (for my processor) and some people said me "you can't do that 'cause the pull/push system will fail" So is that right or can I do that build without troubles?  And my other question is: the fans of the radiator (H100i) gonna push out the heat of inside the case and the heat of the processor or just the heat of the processor? Thank you very much for any advice, and I'll be glad to read any helpful comment.  *btw I got to say, I love your work in this chanel, I'd learn a lot of things, and I can say "I know what I want to build" Thanks!
So you are pulling cool air through a hot radiator, heating it up, then pushing that heated air through another hot radiator thinking you're going to cool it (the radiator, not the air) down? I don't have green blood or pointy ears, but I think that sounds illogical. Am I missing something?
Man these new product plugs are so good hahaha
Would love to see an updated positive/negative case pressure. I'm currently running 2 140's unrestricted as intake and 2 140's in pull on a rad and one very slow 120mm on the back as exhaust. I don't really know if I'm getting positive pressure.
@JayzTwoCents do talk about the 3 intake 5 exhaut fan with resistance! :D
Nice ride you have there. I'm so freaking jealous! I only have a Honda CRV.
use the smoke
First? Hopefully not to be molested
nice car
I'm really glad that Jay, Jerry, Paul, the Tek Syndicate guys and the LTT guys are all friends. They're all the main reason I keep coming back to YouTube. I would love to have more watercooling tutorials in the future, as I may eventually decide to get into it. I don't really overclock though. I haven't really had a reason/the money to. Also, I really like Logan's music over your moderately/fast paced biking videos, just like you had at the end. You may have to borrow some more music from him for when you do more biking videos. EDIT: Jesus, I forgot about Kyle. I'M SO SORRY KYLE! :)
So flow. Many air. Very learned.
Do the video, and the information is not too much.
but jay you forgot push/push and pull/pull
when i opened this video i wasn't looking at my screen, so i totally thought i was watching the tek
love this vid!!!! very informative jay..
That moment when you are early, but you can't think of a dirty joke to make....
I did similar testing, push and pull were within margin of error, push/pull showed a few degree difference with quite a bit more noise. Push or pull with a fan shroud was by far the quietest setup and came in-between  the performance of just push, pull and push/pull. I ended up going with a pull setup with a fan shroud
i would always recommand having the rad directly on the case, as it is heavier. doesnt really matter but better safe than sorry, and its probably helping the vibration from the fans ^^
If you swapped the push and pull in the white one, itll be ALOT easier to clean out the rads from dust :)
Would love to see a visual demonstration of pressure/flow. And thanks for another great video.
Can you make a video to explain about negative and positive pressure? I will appreciate greatly because I get confused with it. Nice video :)
My case is having 2x 120mm IN and 3 Fans out (2x 140mm + 1x120mm). My frontal intake is being done by the Corsair H100i cpu cooler rad with double 120mm. The reason for mounting them + the radiator (Duhh) on the front is just because those fans at max RPM are loud as crap. So i am using a Fan controller (like jay) by software. I am using the one called SpeedFan, and does the job outstandingly good!
I got my fan pushing air through the radiator as exhaust.   This is optimal for the airflow in my case!
Damn Jay! Your looking great! Also, nice 370z! Sick car!
Does Jay drive a 370z? I didn't know he was into imports and modified cars.
why not do a push push or a pull pull?
These ads are s funny
That tan line tho... trolololol
Good advice.  Nice job with the summary!
How old are you?
nice ride...
The promo at the beginning was funny.
you forgot/denied 1 topic.... dust!
Hey Jay, I'm wanting to do a Logitech Blue themed build, so far I know I'm going to use the NZXT H440 in blue, but I don't really know of many light blue themed mobo's or RAM. I'm thinking of throwing in a couple of water cooled 980ti's using the little mod you showed on an EVGA probridge to keep everything blue and black. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated
Would love to see how to accomplish positive pressure with more exhaust than intake fans
at 4:48 it looks like your top mounted fans are on backwards, creating a pull configuration not a push configuration. .-.
This video helps me and my folks at B.
jay you look like a starving african kid, go stuff your face with ice cream
Your wathercooling videos are amazing Jay !! Keep it going :D
nice car Jay
I commented on one of your videos but you no respond to me ;~;
That intro dude... I wish you do for others. sigh
To borrow a phrase from Jerry, mobo fan headers are for poor people :)  Aquaero is worth every penny if running more than 3 fans in a system.
jizz man... i was looking at some of your old watercooling video and i didn't realize it but you've shrink like crazy. nice job
Thank you Jay!  I agree that we need more of these educational videos, so please keep them coming!
The Techsyndicate logo looks like FFVII...
This is a good video. I would like to see a smoke video on the difference.
God that commercial................ Please. Stop.
Wow that 350z looks great!
Smoke video
Can the CPU fan connecter on the motherboard handle 6 fans? using a 1-6 fan splitter
is it just me or does jay sometimes sound/act kind of douchy in his videos and his comments....I understand it might just be your personality, but just relax a little man. Criticism and people not understanding something is okay...
I just finished watching the video from barnacule's channel from when he was at your house a year ago. And now i see this. Jay has lost so much weight!
This was confusing, my 2 favorite tech channels. QUICK reproduce this prototype !
Really appreciate how in depth you went in this video. Hope to see an air flow video that is just as informative.
@JayzTwoCents Hey M8 I had a question I bought a couple of Cougar Vortex PWM fans and I wanted to mount them horizontally someone told me not to do that because they are hydrodynamic bearings I dunno what to do help?
I have 2 fans in front of my case pulling air in and 2 on top pushing out through a closed loop rad. then one pushing out the exhaust vent. My rig tends to get a little hotter than id like when running some games on ultra. Probobly going to add 2 more fans in front with more pull and 2 on side pushing out
i like to use the push,push config, cause im soo l33t
and dual push?  is it necessary? esp with the case of the corsair 80i's?
it was great info and not to much.or hard to fallow. good job
How would build work with two radiators as exhaust? How would intake work? Can it be done that it works that both rads are same setup?
Link for the open air case video?
Best push/pull fans video on youtube! Helped me a lot about my next build man, tha ks a lot! I'm about to do a white theme build in a matx case amd will use EXACTELY the same radiators that you used in this video (PERFORMANCE PCS painted radiators).
Jay, turn on V-Sync for your intro.
I prefer pull, easier to clean.
Yeah, please do a video on case air flow. I'm still racking my brain trying to figure out how to do positive airflow in a few cases where there just aren't enough intake fans to match the exhaust fans, but every exhaust fan has a radiator.
linus also has a pretty solid video on this, involving dust as well
I've noticed since you quitted your last job, your eyes are much less irritated. Must feel good not having to be ALL day in front of a screen! :)
Smoke machine :D
Very good video ! I like these how to's / let me explain type videos .
@5:31 allah the radiator?
Push or pull is the same, but what about HP fans in Push VS AF in Pull. If you go in Pull inside the case, maybe AF fans are better than HP fans
Great vid Jay, learning loads from your channel before do my first water cooled build. Love those commercials you're doing with CoconutMonkey. Humour and info always a good mix.
smoke test would be great
LMAO!....that Tek Syndicate intro. Great stuff Jay, keep up the good work.
Wow. Dat NissanZtwoCents... I know this is a tech channel but man I'd love to see a video of that car!
Can I do a push / pull exhausting through the front of the case? Or would that create a large amount of negative pressure? I'm using an NZXT S340 with 1 exhaust out the back and one intake from the top.
What car do you drive?!
You should do the thing with the smoke.. it'll be really cool and it's really good example
do a setup with these parts pls http://pcpartpicker.com/p/BqMr8d
at first i was like oh snap jayztwocents making a gamer online series, sweet! then it turned into a commercial... my day is now ruined!!
that's got to be the best advert I have ever seen xD
Top quality as always. Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us ??
did you guys know he was raped in prison? by 20 black guys lol #gangbang
This was a really great informative video. It all made perfect sense :-)
Isn't a pull setup more practical since you don't have to remove the fans to clean the radiator?
adding a pull config on my 480 rad dropped 14c on my GPU.. i definately go with PUSH PULL i do have a double thick 60mm RAD though.
Hey jay I wanted to ask, you said there is no difference between push or pull, but is there a difference between using the the radiator fans as intake fans or exhaust fans? For example will i get better cooling performance from my CPU water cooler if it is taking in cool air from the front or would i get better cooling performance if the CPU cooler used the air in the case to pass through the radiator or would there not be a difference. I assume it would get better performance using cooler air but I just wanted to make sure. Thank you
JAYYYY I LOVED THE INTRO
learn more about radiators and fans today. hope you tackle a full cleaning of the loop someday or might have missed it..
What software do you use to control fan speeds?
Sweet Z car Jay!
What about dust accumilation in a radiator?
It is better to have more fresh cool air coming in than more exhaust fans. My current setup has 2x140mm intake, 2x120mm in take, and 3x140mm exhaust.
If you have pwm fans you have splitters that take the pwm signal from the motherboard and power from molex (i love those splitters!!)!!!!
that your 350z?
Wow Jay! You're looking great! You can definitely see your face thinning! Keep up the great work!
I'd like to see the DIY wind tunnel testing
You should just do a full series of water cooling guides/tips so we can reference which ever video corresponds to the part of the computer we are wanted to set up for a loop if that makes sense lol. Anyways I love these kinds of videos because I'm saving up for a build and I'll have some knowledge before even picking out the parts, and you should also include your personal preferences when it comes to trusted brands parts etc. since someone like me, who has only knowledge for other people experience, knows little about the little details you learn from actually going through this whole process.
i thought u were supposed to use fractal fans
fuck off with the tek mono songs... have your own style ffs
Perfect, I've literally got a new cooler being delivered in a few hours haha
I have a question. Is there a big difference if I have my PC on carpet versus having it on a desk? Do I risk shorting out any components because the PC is on carpet?
You should talk about how using airflow fans seems to be efficient enough for push setups only rather than static favoured fans. I personally use cougar airflow fans for my rads on a push only configuration. Its seems to cool perfectly fine.
i want to push my pull so my postif presure doesnt give negatif reaction
Jay, the intro and intro music is awesome
But Jay, what about push/push configurations, or pull/pull? :P
If I get a phanteks enthroo luxe, I have 2 120mm pulling air through the front then have a rad up top 420mm with 3 fans visible and 3 in the fan compartment I will have a very negative air pressure, but will it matter? Just wondering as trying to find a solution and not getting anywhere I just want it to look aesthetically pleasing!
Can you go over fittings and types of fittings.
that 350z
Best commercial ever
Please do more videos like this, please!! :)    Love coming here to learn.  :)
Jay, could you do something like this but on a case with restricted airflow like the NZXT H series? How much that would impact on the cooling performance and that kind of stuff? :P
Normally, I don't like ads. But you make them really entertaining! I actually thought they were part of the video. And I found a way to make push/pull look good. On my case (Corsair 780T) there's enough room to put fans on the top below the fan filter, but above the inside of the case (if that makes sense). The same for the front of the case. So, I have Noctua NF-F12 industrials on push pull for my 2 360mm radiators.
Your new car looks great man, good choice!
I'd love to see the air pressures with smoke!
You didn't reply to my tweet. :(
"push pull,i don't know if you understand this one is hard" you killed me xD
First comment
Instead of putting the fans on the opposite side of my 240mm radiator, I just flipped them over to a pull config on the same side, leaving my radiator in between the case and fans. That way, when the day comes that I have to clean my rad, the majority of the dust will be on top of the radiator and not in between my fans and rad, so basically I can clean it without removing my fans... My config is a 230mm on the front, intake. A 230mm on the side, intake. Two 120mm fans intake through my radiator, and a 140mm exhaust fan on the rear, keeping plenty of positive pressure.
please do the smoke thing
I would love to see a GPU reference card used in a case with smoke.
jay why are u loosing so much weight? and what speed do you recommend for fans.
Loving the intros.
It amazes me that you even have to make this video. It all seems like common sense but nice video anyways.
Damn Jay, no homo but your looking lean man.
It's also good to note that when using multiple rads, you probably want all the rads going the same direction.  Example:  you don't want one rad in taking from outside and the other in taking from the inside.  The result would be: the heat from one rad going into the other rad.  It's best to have all the rads venting out or in, but all the same.  Additionally, as Jay mentioned near the end of the video, you want to have a little bit of air pressure in the flow.  Example:  All the case fans intake air which is then all vented out radiators.  Additionally, it's probably best to have the rads vent out rather than in, so the other components get fresh air, rather than warm air from the rads.
Damn that Z looked nice.
You, Paul, and Kyle have the ad game on lock. lol
Yes more fan videos. With and without radiators at the front and at the top and vice versa. Thanks! 301 club signing out!
LOL when I started the video, I was confused on when did I click on a TEK SYNDICATE video. I swore it said Jays Two Cents at the bottom!?!?!
Oh mah gawd, dat 350.
I'm a FAN of that new ad... No? Alright I'll go cry in the corner of shame ;-;
Useful video thanks Jay!
Hi !!
i can't stop staring at the loose skin on your right arm
Linus did this already. If I recall, the only consistant difference he found was having an SP fan on push and an AF fan on pull but it's not worth the thickness considering the temp drop. Also.... I'm sorry Jay.  I'm not trying to be mean, but I have to ask.  Can you fly yet?
Hahahahaahhahaha this fucking intro hahahahahahahaha oh my god haaha so so so so good jay your freaking awesome!!!
Great video! Thanks for clarifying when push-pull is useful. The only other information on the topic that I'd heard was that specialized high SP fans essentially removed the need to do push-pull. I'd definitely like to see smoke/incense demonstrations on Skunk Works in a future video.
The intro with tek syndicates music and play on their intro graphics made me lol it actually fits very well. Maybe you should see if Logan could design some of your own intro music in that style. As someone else said that music fits very well with most tech channels here on YouTube. Good video jay, also digging the ads
Dat commercial at the beginning doe.
Yes, please cover case pressure
PLEASE DO THOSE DEMONSTRATIONS WITH sKUNKWORKS AIRFLOW!!
Is Jay part of the syndicate now? :D
kek syndicate
NEW INTRO LOVE IT IM AT BBBBBBBBBBBBBB
can you do a video on overclocking for beginners ?
@JayzTwoCents  I really like this type of videos always learning something new, keep on going in this direction please :D
I would love to see more on the Skunkworks airflow balancing. It's a question I've been meaning to ask as I'm planning my own SMA8 build and I want to understand better the balancing issues I'm having in my planning and how I can consider solving them, and Skunkworks would be a great example.
Creative just creative, like the ad xD
I usually go with pull, I'd rather look at the radiator than the fan.
the only difference from a practical standpoint that (at least in my experience) I feel is important is Dust collection. Now this is nothing to do about positive/negative pressure and mainly about Rads in cases that have little to no dust filters. Running PULL set-ups makes clean up easier with a vacuum while PUSH configs I found i need to remove the fans before I can get a good clean up going with the vac.  To put in a different perspective I found that dust accumulates more between Rad/Fans in a PUSH vs PULL. again this was from my experience and your's may vary. Just sharing shit I had to deal with.
@JayzTwoCents YES PLEASE make the Pos Airflow Demo
would a single 360mm rad be adequate for a stock amd 8320 and a gtx 970?
I'm a big "fan" of these videos :D
Let's please see some mod videos. Like acrylic polishing, cable sleeving (all types), acrylic bending (sheets not tubing), painting heatsinks, custom acrylic panels for windows and motherboard trays, and just things like that. You don't really see those types of videos and people don't try it as they don't know where to start.
When you painted your mobo heatsinks did you see a temp difference if so by how much. I'm looking to paint my mobo chip set heatsinks and am not sure if it will hurt my temps to the point of poor oc and temps.
thanks Jay, this was helpful.
LMAO coconut at the end.
I really like the ads in the begining. it makes them interesting and makes me not want to just skip over it like I do for most channels. Keep up the great work on everything man!
very informative. Thanks Jay
Where's jay? I only see a skinny Guy. Keep up the very very good work!
Alright, that was actually pretty good. GG.
I just started building computers a couple of months ago and I get the concept of case pressure and fan orientation, but I'm not too sure when enough is enough. I have 6 intake fans(2 on a radiator) and one exhaust. I'm starting to think that I should flip my radiator over to make it an exhaust and push the radiator heat out of my case.
I like these being broken down but a visual can create more ah hah moments.
Personally feel push pull and just the direction of airflow is sometimes over blow. And the difference is not big. I personal run all intake pull for easy rad cleaning and one rear exhaust.
HAHahah
I've got a perfect idea. Jay and Jerry 2016 Jerry can be the vice president :) or, for a first you can have co-presidents instead of a vice
Jay what about the heat that the front rad dumps inside the case and the top RAD picks up.
Jayz Schwarzenegger is that you? Nice car btw, keep up the good work ;)
how about a video on how to sleeve psu cables?
You could have said Bravo, but hay what do i know (not a lot)
Great info.. I have learned a lot about computer components because of your videos.   I want to do a custom water cooled pc when I build my gaming pc within the next year so any more videos would help me with that and I enjoy watching!!!
Why so many radiators for Single CPU/GPU? I can see each 240mm running just cpu and the other for just gpu,but what will the third 120mm radiator accomplish?
jay where is my r9 380 review i just bought the card!
Definitely digging this video. I feel like this was the perfect amount of information for someone wanting to know basics about what the difference in configs is... And so what if it went a smidgen too quickly... It's a video, go back and re-listen if you missed something x-)
Now make a tutorial of how to become rich enough to do a custom water loop.
I'm enjoying my 16 radiator fans and 5 airflow fans. Great video again.
That 350z jay holy shit
I love these arguments because usually no one knows what they hell they are talking about. Good job, Jay. At least you are putting forth an effort to combat the stupid on this debate. Please do a video about dust and radiators.
I though the promotion would have been get better headset/headphone
Thats one nice 370, now you just need twin turbo and amuze bodykit T_T
Well done and thx!
Yes please, NCIX did this already, but I would also like to see your version. You are a good teacher .
Damn bro ya lost a lot of wait!
positive air preassure video pls :D
I just want to see the smoke demonstration
I don't understand this very well but wouldn't it be really bad to bring the hot air from the radiator into the case? I thought the point of water cooling was to cut out heat in the case and remove it directly. PS I have only used air cooling systems.
Do another video this one was great m8 r8 8/8
awesome ad Jay!
Logan will hit you with a copyright strike for using his music, won't he?
dat car do <3_<3
Nice car! And keep up the good work!
That 350z is clean! I like it very much, congrats for the build!
Ey Jay, So what would you recommand? Fans with high RPM to run them at a low speed or buy fans with a low rpm that will run on that RPM. Thx for the vid man!
That will great to see! Demo demo!!
Can you example more on the positive air pressure inside the case please?
Hey @JayzTwoCents, what if i have a push/pull config with different fans, for example, a good SP one pushing the air, and a good AF one pulling the air, does this affect the flow or anything similar?
Didn't know what Tek Syndicate was, So I went over to their website from the link, saw an article talking about PC gaming sales going on currently. I now own Titanfall.
I'm looking to do a simple AIO 120mm CoolerMaster in my small fractal Design core 1,000 case, and the only place I have for the cooler is front, and the back only has a 92mm exhaust fan, so should I go with just a pull, or a push pull as I'll have the space sense it's open long as the cables, and water cooling tubes will reach. my AMD APU which I'm trying to get down into the 30's for little money as I can get away with.
I personally did not like the intro, but the video itself was great.
IS THAT A NISSAN?!? I want it * o *
I personally prefer pull, this is because it is much easier to clean the dust off and that I like to see the sexy black radiator fins. Also I have all my rads as exhausts (280 and 120) as I like to draw all the hot air that is created by radiators away from the rest of my components and since I prefer pull due to aesthetics and ease of maintaining the beauty the only place for me to mount a radiator is as exhaust.
I use their music in my videos too, love it
Next thing you will see is that syndicateproject will join TekSyndicate :P
What about push-push and pull-pull?
MOAR!!!! PLZ
living the 370z life damn....:D
Whats headphones are you using?
man i had to pause the video just to say that you are looking great...i've only been subbed since January, and the change is ridiculous. keep it up bro :)
The theme music made me feel like I was watching Tek syndicate
enjoyed this vid, might not be cool as some of the latest stuff, however go back to your old ones and they where very educational. good job.
Was that video about design or efficiency?
yea jay, do the smoke for skunkworks pleeez
The pull method is easier to clean the radiator often.
I am possibly going to be doing a new PC build in a few months, the room the pc is going to be in is small with a lot of sunlight. I will also be using it up to 12 hours a day... would you recognmend water cooling even if I am not going to overclock anything? I live in the UK, so it's not the hottest place.
This ad at the beginning was awesome :D
Interesting point to take on board about the reduce flow ensuring positive pressure good vid
Wtf? Jay looks like a new person
I still dont get it, explain again?
Ahaha he deleted the guy that was first. Ahaha
THAT INTRO AHAHAHAHHAHA
Good video!  Very nice to see someone simply explain that the difference is negligible between the two and it is more about aesthetics.  I see you point about the number of fans, but I'm wondering how can you best check the pressure in your case?   I have 7 intake fans and 4 outake fans.  The difference is that the four intake on the bottom are going through an 80mm radiator while the 4 outake are going through a 30mm radiator.  The fans for the outtake spin faster than the intake as well.  Without a specific way to measure I was assuming this was positive air pressure within the case but I'm now wondering if i should amp up the fans on the larger radiator. SO what is an easy way to check whether you have negative or positive air pressure within a case?
Really like your videos Jay, but the commercials at the beginning are getting worse and worse...
Can u build me a pc if always wanted to build one but my family is on poor side just asking don't take offence
anyone have the corsair c70? im thinking of getting a static pressure fan to put in front and move one of the existing fans on top
Under 301 club
Jay, you look amazing! I just built my first system (below), much inspired by you. I am hoping to make a watercooled system in the future with both cpu and gpu in one or separate loops. Hopefully in a smaller case than my current full tower for college (ie easy transportation). Intel i7 5820K (no OC yet) Zotac 970 AMP! Extreme Core Asus X-99 A USB 3.1
good intro lol
Hey man, I love your channel, You post great content, do you mind giving me some feedback on my build before I but it? http://pcpartpicker.com/p/bm6LNG Im looking to add led fans, sleeved led kit as well as an sli config on the future, is this power supply good enough or would i need something better?
Like the ad, but...headphones :/
Niice Car... ;D
HOLY CHIZZLE-SWIZ YOU LOOKING SKINNY JAY! NICE WORK!
Nice car jayz
lol That Tek intro, the Fractal intro is nice too :D
Technically the radiator can cool with no airflow as the fins will still radiate thermal energy - but it transfer nearly as much heat as it would if air was flowing over the surface of the rad.
"Oh my god, finely" my reackshion before I even watched the vidoe XD
Wow talk about a great intro! Funny, creative, and entertaining! This was a very interesting topic, I never knew fan/airflow directions had so much effect on the cooling. Great video!
Under 301 club
Dang Jay, you are looking hella good! Keep up the good work man!
SWAG= Secretly We Are Gay
hahahhaha loving the intro!
i coulda swore that was a headphone ad.
ok i LOVED that intro
Jay350zTwoCents Now we know what the z is for.
hy
I did wanna go sleeping, but you have to upload a video, why jay? Wy u do dis?
I liked the video because of 350Z, uh i mean because of the stuff you talked about in the video... yeeeaah
Thanks Jay, this is something I've wanted to know for ages! central pahk

I have a $4,000,000 industrial ammonia refrigeration rack system cooling my coolant for my desktop, also have a huge 100ft cooling tower cooling the water for the ammonia plant condenser. My computer would run at about 1000 degrees C (molten) without the cooling system so it needs it.
I fell for it
can anyone tell me what monitor he uses
i am still triggerd about your red case! i think it would look better with a white case becasue your mobo is white
I want 69 comments no more and no less
hey guys zzzzz austin
bro i get 350 fps with an i7 and a 1070ti
But, it's nice that the benchmark test uses all those cores, but are there actually games that do? In earnest that is.
Did he change the Motherboard or just kept the Z370 Prime?
Play Fortnite !
I have 2 old pcs. I plan on making them sleepers.
Can it run fortnite

Is it worth more than a toyota corolla? Woops wrong channel
cool gaming pc austin do you like it and still have it did it work good
@austin, they arent both skylake cores.....theyre coffee lake. ;-)
So, minesweeper?
Fastest in what? Where? so you have 2080ti and 9900k and 4k monitor and there are nothing faster then others cpu-s unless you don't want to downsize on 1080p but you will get shitty pixelated graphic !! 9900k are only hottest and most overpriced cpu while anything else
Linus sneak diss
STOP!!! MINE DOESNT EVEN HAVE A FUCKING 1 TI GRAPHICS CARD!!!
give me it please <3 :)
I need :'c
... Fastest?
I want 1000 likes no more and no less

Still rocking an i7 7700k with a 1070
Is it able to run cool math games
is it faster than the flash?
Title should have read "The most expensive and overpriced gaming PC/oven I've ever built"
can it run minecraft 20+ fps?
subbed to both
But can it run Runescape?
thats faster then my everyday crappy computer
What monitor is that?
Let's start a story there once was a man called Austin Evans
Fuck you 14nm hello 12nm
Pretty weak CB score compared to 1920X which is much cheaper now and can do 2800-2900cb points when overclocked.
Does anyone feel like Evans is just burning money at this point? The 1080ti has been benched similar to a 2080ti, and the I9 has been proven to have marginal benefits from the I7. I mean I guess if you got the money.....
SUCKS... if you do it do it correctly man
I got two 2080ti's with a 7940x oc to 5ghz. Custom water loop.
man i wish i had that
Speaking of upgrades, youve upgraded your looks, bu its time to upgrade those glasses
The specification is too much high for Minecraft
And here I am with a radeon R7.....
But can it run Minecraft?
I love his lg monitor
dave lee is mad
Mans throwing shade at linus....??
But can it run, CLUB PENGUIN?
"But this is [cpu] a little bit more expensive"...
no mention of heat...this bad boy IS HOT...i'd avoid it (Been a tech for 22 years)
Heyy Austin, Have you used the same Asus Z370-A motherboard or some different??
* Builds crazy expensive computer * * Plays fortnite *
high performance... when the x299 platform is still out.
never clicked a video so fast
Dave can it run pong tho
How are your temps. I have a similar rig (8700k instead of 8086k) and want to know how it is doing re temps.
I9 sucks
Im building a gaming pc with the following components... Amd ryzen 2600x Asus rog x470 f Corsair 8gb 3000mhz ddr4 Samsung evo 860 500gigs ssd Wd blue 2 tb Asus rog strix rx570 Corsair vs550 psu Corsair spec 3 cabinet What u think about this config? Should i change any parts above mentioned for a superior performance?? Pls pls assist.....
But can it run RTX 2080ti?

Austin is a fortnite noob
Real games and Fortnite do NOT belong in the same scentence.
Builds a COMPLETELY OVERKILL PC but still a No-Skin FFS AUSTIN
I have a GTX 1080 i7 8700k 16GB of ram so how long could my pc play games at max settings 100-200 fps? Currently runs gtav max settings capped at 240.
HEY GUYS ITS AUSTIN HERE ?? ?? LOL
Who else doesn’t know what he’s on about but just wants a cool pc
Should've done SLI
I want someone to make a pointlessly powerful pc that can run any game at 300+ fps

Is it me or does he really look and sound like Andy from The Office?
maybe
Did you keep the Z370 board? I am considering this chip but afraid that Z370 is not enough for overclocking, as I've heard.
Waiting for thid since thr new i9 and rtx
It can hold up to half the memory of Austin’s forehead Note: I’m not hating on Austin he is one of my favourite youtubers.
I want him to say. Hey Austin, this is guys ????

Famous igtv star Austin Evans debuts his first ever computer video on the new streaming service: "YouTube"
I feel your pain! The day I was going to upload my video, YouTube died and then it came back and then my Internet died.
Lol Linus
This video, Austin's paycheck, apartment, etc are all brought to you by Intel
LOL! Austin is calling out everyone!
What LG monitor is that?
Bad Boys II reference = instant like
Shiny forehead!
Wait the iPhone 9 those not exist Man why are you saying i9
Hey Austin this is guys
While I have i5-6200U Intel HD 520 8 GB RAM single channel 1TB hard drive
His house is going to burn down again with that i9
WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE USE SHITTY ZERO AIRFLOW CASES.
"The fastest xxxxx ever" is such a dumb way to describe technology. Obviously the newer technology is going to be faster. It's not like you're gonna build a PC with intent for it to be fast, but then not make it faster than your previous build.
Don't know what's going on. But, still watching coz love Austin.
u just said -pubg not the nicest looking ?
Wait seriously no more hyper-threading on Intel chips? Why is that? Surely that makes Ryzen chips even more better value?
I saw a 5 gigahertz gaming PC for 750$ dollars
Is that henley the essential one from Cotton On?
Pc cost?
Who remembers when the best parts on the market could only get 4k 10 fps
But is the cpu rgb
Imagine a little more clock for The CPU and another 2080Ti and both over clocked
Now Intel started to sponsor channels and give them free i9 9900K just to convince people to get it! it's not worth it, The Ryzen 2700x is much better
First minete he speeking spanish
dave roasted
what is the monitor in the video
Out of everything he could have tested, he tested fortnite and pubg... He could have used so many other games
Hi
HEY GUYS it's AUSTIN
Here i am watching with 2002 build pc
can it run the pornhub search bar?
Will it blend?
Austin can I have a free pc?
Austin looked disappointed to see the i9’s multi-threaded score being too high.
Anyone else thought this was a speed build?
Am selling my dog.....anyone?? ??

Hi Austin, this is guys
Everytime I see GeForce RTX, I always think: GeForcer TX. Is somebody else always thinking that?
Please do a benchmark of CRYSIS 1 and CRYSIS 3 with ultra settings and MSAA X8.
6:23 Austin builds a very expensive pc, then is suprised that its fast??. Btw love your vids
why do i not notification of such good ideos?
Calling out Linus like that NOT COOL! But it looks like you jinxed yourself there...
The z370 cant handle well with the 9900k
That is one fancy tv
please austin mame a gudie on how you fixed the internet issue on that pc
Hey Austin can I get some love from Malaysia
can it run paint??
Half the video was about benchmarks
G I V E A W A Y T I M E
Le hands on le raptor
Friggen price You'll "Pay" for this Mr. Price! ok i'll just leave.
I wish i could afford something like that....??????
So you're telling me, FORTNITE looks good while PUBG doesn't? Well done! LOL
Hey! I've been building for quite some time a computer for the first time, so I have an Asus prime z370-A motherboard I bought a few months ago, however, I haven't bought a cpu because I've been waiting for the i7 9700k. The problem is, I've seen some comments that you need to update the motherboard's bios before being able to use 9th gen processors, is that true? That would be such a bummer since I don't have an older gen cpu just so I could update the bios, as I said before, is my first time building a computer. Any help, would be appreciated!
But is it faster than my fapping speed?
Anyone else spend 8 minutes of their lives not understand almost anything in the video?
For some reason I thought he was gonna build a PC as fast as he could.
Can I play super Mario in it ??????
That tricep????
I just looked at roboraptor the whole time
Austin Evains help me i went to play PUBG on my Xbox but I didn’t gold membership please give me gift card
Can it run crysis
Id stick to my 1070 for now... I'm satisfied with the frames I get + I like playing on low graphics anyway
you look like Malcom from Malcolm in the middle in that new profile pic
oof that dig at linus was deep
Can it run command prompt? I’m curious if it can or if I need two Xeon platinum 8180 cpus 128gb ram and 4x quadro rtx 6000. This would be a way better option as it’s significantly cheaper
I am at 0:02 in the video and I have a feeling that the main benchmark will be Fortnight
Lol this pc sucks it can't even play minesweeper at 1 fps, at 1p
Hey cake this is frosting
which motherboard you use...
Fix ya internet with a sponsor
His forehead shiny af
but can it run crysis
But the I-9 9900 is not a gaming CPU per se. It's a productivity CPU. This is therefore not a gaming system.
what are those numbers at 5:32 ?
Video end at 6:38
watching this on a $200 laptop
But can it run austin....guys ?
Hey Austin your pc specification videos are insane but when you test out games its so lackluster, no hate but i think you need to do more on the testing games aspect.
0:20 Really Austin Get yeeted ??????????
Gets a beast system but only test it on fortnite and PUBG ??
This is pointless, consider i7 and 1080ti yesterday still better hardware.... Oh wait Nvidia will slowdown 1080ti.
Just make a whole video testing a bunch of games
Is it faster than a tortoise?
Nah, I'll build my PC the Verge style. ??
Which keyboard this is ?????
Why would you ever put pubg on that computer lol
Ummm, so I just realized, I was watching some, let’s just say, questionable material, and just realized that Austin’s girlfriend is a porn star. ??
But can it run paint? Didn’t think so
ugh why would anyone waste so much money. just get an xbox one X already
A PC is not a PC if it can't run despacito 2
Bit in the starting it said no benchmarks.... Arghhhh!!!! Viewbaited again...
hey guys this is gaming pc, and this, is the fastest Austin ive ever built
Just play better and more demanding games next...... You're wasting this build by only playing trendy games.
fortnite at 70fps? thats it?
Like for Linus burn.
Why don't you use CS:GO anymore?
why is austin so bad at fortnite
¿can run the nes emulator?
Hey Austin can u buy me a gaming PC and build it and ship it to me with the mouse and keyboard and Everything?
anyone know what keyboard he is using?
ya know i had a PlayStation ad before this xP
Did you use the same motherboard?
HEY GUYS this is Austin
I wish I had the disposable income for this
I have no idea what the fuck his talking about! I need to get back into computing
but can it run minesweeper
Still have that 8086 in my system, it's straight fire man - Really can not recommend this processor more if anyone edits often.
Still slow for the processor memory mboard and graphics are not fiber optics! Just saying.
So if i do all of that computer jiberish i can play minecraft at full speed great :)
so is there even an i3? is it i5=i3, i7=i5 and i9=i7
Wtf was all that computer mumbo jumbo?
Dude u legit logics brother
PLEASE PLEASE STOP SAYING "HEY GUYS THIS IS AUSTIN" - YOU LOOK STUPID. YOU LOOK RETARDED

Hey guys this is autistic!
I hope we some 3DMark Fire Strike scores next time.
That end tho
Well, I just have intel core duo :(.
What can I say, PUBG is more poorly optimised than I think
that new profile pic tho
Can u give me that on chirtmas...
Pc vids are back
Fortnite? PUBG? You should test with Call of Duty Black Ops IIII.
7:16 as noted, Austin knows NOTHING about the game. "80 fps is playable" for noobs.
That is somewhat overkill.
So fucknite is the new way to test these beast machines? ?? test that machine with a real game such as witcher 3, gta v, destiny, etc. not this cartoon-wannabe looking piece of shit of a game
Hooooooooly
Can it run Crysis ???
HT doesn't make a difference.. Do you even PC..? 9900K Encoding gets a HT boost. Many usage cases it increases performance up to 25-35% in encoding, and can save 4core machines from 100% in games, It stops dropped GPU usage when your 4thread limited. Not All things,.. but to say it doesn't make a difference makes YOU look stupid and you should know better.
Do mate 20 pro
God damnit 0:21
How much would this cost?
But.......can it run Atari Breakout????
I i have a budget of 800 dollars should i get an acer nitro 5 laptop or a cyberpowerpc or what do you gus recomend send help please it has to ve prebuilt
Gotta wear tight shirts to flex those tiny ass biceps!

I am still using my second-hand laptop Dell Latitude E6330 w/ cpu core i5-3320m, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd+320gb hdd and intel graphic 4000??
Still on the pre-roll ad but I bet it only runs crisis at 1080p 30fps
Great, now you're machine is 12% faster at double the price point
Austin isn't perfect but he's a simple man and I can respect that.
Y’all want to donate your old pc parts to me lmao
Hopefully you'll only need one power supply ??
A little bit more expensive? HAHAHA
Was it worth it though? Heeeeeeeeell naw
Don’t buy the cpu or gpu. They’re both a terrible deal.
Hell...I play PUBG on my i3,8gb,1050 machine .. ????
Welldone, finally it can run minecraft without lag
So now intel made metal foundries for pc.... No thanks. I don't want to see my motherboard in flames.
Laughs in Core 2 Duo

Austin, YOU DONE MESSED UP WITH THE BR FOOTAGE! DAVE WILL NOT BE PLEASED!
Putting the 2 ads in the beginning was a great idea
6:43 Dave!!!!!
100 Mb but keeps turning off... or like me 100 KILOBYTES but never turns off
Yo Dogg but can it run bombsweeper
5 GHz is a turbo-boost on single core only - so if you have a single threaded application that needs a lot of CPU - you will get the 5GHz. If you have multithreaded application that loads all of your cores at the same time (like Cinebench does) it will boost only to the all-core turbo speed which is 4.7GHz for 9900k. And even more - if you start loading your floating point unit, then turbo frequency gets even lower.
hey guys dezz Austin
Hyper-threading™ Hyper-threading™ Hyper-threading™ intel has you by the fucking chain. Please say SMT.
this computer is worth more than my house
Wow didn’t even play blackout
yeah sure you are using an i9 9900k whit a z370 chip set mothearboard and dont understand why it isnt boosting bacuas you need z390 chip set foor al the new functions from the new i9900k

You know its fast when you can play fortnite
I love the bit were he said “Dave’s favourite footage” like if you know what I’m talking about
Available for 100000000000003793$
You should have played Call of Duty's Blackout mode I think that would have looked rather cool and you should have actually played a full game of it.
Ok, we can all admit, Linus is better with technology, but those he make cringe video's like Austin? No, that's why we all watch Austin! Because of how cringe his how to waste videos are! Keep up the cringe Austin.
I wish I had an awesome gaming PC, No I wish I had a gaming PC.
But does it minesweeper???
It doesn’t look that fast to me.
Ryzen threadripper ...better choise
please donate this pc to me for gaming/streaming/productivity :D
prreeeettttyyy weeelll speeecceedd system??
Like OMG, you didn't use a CPU guide, extra thermal paste, tweezers and a swiss army knife that MAYBE had a Philips screwdriver? So unprofessional.
OOF for linus
My Internet went down watching this video... Coincidence? I think not!
1:24 yo know, he knows quite a bit more than you about those things... (Not saying that YOU don’t know anything , I do like your channel, but still... yeah...)
dat sexy monitor name?...
ummm hypert-threading DEFINITELY matters.. it helps in so many was.. many of the tech youtubers agree they should of made them less cores and added hyperthreading.. because the hyper threading will do more than an extra 2 cores will do
what do u mean, my omen 15 can run fortnite on epic settings on no less than 120 fps
Can it run minecraft
Hey Austin This Is Guys
so you are going to overclock this
Can it run mine Craft?
All epic 60 FPS with 2080? I get 110 FPS with a 1060 3 gb
any chance i could win this pc? lol
How much is the price?
Nice advertorial dipshit. Next time put some Intel watermarks on your video so it's even more obvious.
I built my fastest PC like $5000 in 2018. How does it hold up in 2036
What’s the monitor he’s unsung is the 27 lg or the 32 lg
for some reason, whenever Austin is happy, I’m happy.
You should have used the i9-7980XE
20,000 Gaming Pc Plays Fortnite
nah go ltt and go dual xeon 32 and a quadro
Yeaaaaaas i have a new BEAST pc watches this video my pc sucks
but can it run crysis 3
Ok let me sell my soul and house for this pc
wait this is new? I only just noticed...
Its not saying much ive seen scrapyard wars
But can it run minecraft?
0:21 motherfucker
Hi Austin this is guys. I'm so original.
This dude really just dissed Linus. Awaiting a diss-track war between 2 tech-heads.
I dont know why i watched this, i didnt understand anything austin said lol
Only a single 2080 ti? I have just ordered one with 2 and a custom watercooling loop with an i9
Honestly its a rtx 1080ti founders edition and you only get 80avg fps at 4k. I kinda expected alot more
A like a day will convince austin to go to the gym
I'll take that 8086 off your hands if you're not using it XD
The Lenovo Ideapad 33os core i7, 2TB Hard drive, 24GB Memory, 16GB Optane, and 8GB RAM. Would it be worth buying for $649?
Builds a powerful pc---- plays fortnite
2003 - Pentium 4 overclock - 5GHz 2018 - Intel Core i9 cinebench test + cpuZ - 5GHz woahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoah
Why. Is. The. Case. Read
HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THE FATHER OF TECH AWESOMENESS LINUS WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS
STOP CROUCH WALKING!
My pc is only 400x slower xd
That i9 box looks like a engram from destiny. You expect something good but you end up disappointed lol
Austin Evans, can you revive the Electron Build?! >:D
but can it run Minecraft
Lets get some SLI up in this shizzal!
makes "the fastest gaming PC", plays Fortnite and PUBG smh
Can u plz send me a gaming pc for bid plzzzzzZzzzZzzzzzZZ
Cool man
“ryzen has been around for a few years” nigga tf u mean ryzen has been around for a few years they just released ryzen in like q1/q2 2017 NIGGA
Seeing as 8 cores is pointless for gaming right now
How much it cost????????
PLEASE STOP USING FORTNITE AND PUBG FOR BENCHMARKING
Ducan get amd instead of intel core
Hey Austin, this is guys
but can it run ROBLOX ?????
What
U mess with linus, i mess with your pc
I need some serious power to play cool math games
This is more a Linus thing to do than anything else
Still slower then my iPhone 1
6:43 He actually watched that stupid video
shintel lol
I wish I had the money to build that
Not as powerful as the PS4 Pro
Cool
NOICE
What was that intro song? The bass and trumpet caught my attention! I am in need for new jams. HELP!
Linus: “Haha, cute”
?? daddy wants
Okay, Austin. I should warn you. The chips get hot. Steve over at Hardware Unboxed overclocked the i9 to 5.1ghz and it got to a 100 degrees even on a 240mm aio and a nhd15. He needed a 360mm open loop to get it slightly below 100 degrees and it still hit 98C. There is no gains in overclocking the i9 (barely 1-5%) and its not worth hitting 98C. Don't do that. You'll probably set something on fire. On second thought, make sure to get like close shots during the livestream. We wanna see the burning.
So many shots fired in this one video lol
Dislike for fortnite
my kidneys are expensive
nice
Does anyone know what case this is, its??
My friend has GTX 2080 OC and Clocked at 5.3hz it’s insane runs literally all games at 4k60.
You can get the Ryzen 7 2700X for $275 cheaper. And have the same core and threads. Or even 12 core Ryzens are cheaper then Intel.
This is so cool i wish i had like austin
But can it run IOS??
1 like = extra heart ?
But AMD is better for productivity
But can it run Crisis
Lmao my pc is significantly better
Awesome !
PUBG running exactly like Fortnite but "uhhhhhh pubg is not optimizedddddddddd" ??????
Wow. Fortnite and PUBG. Do you actually have other games than Fortnite, PUBG and Rocket League?
Why would you build such a sweet system in an NZXT? I'm puking right now...
I am so tired of people benchmarking fortnite on a 'powerful' system just because the game is trending, why not do say far cry 5 since its still an open world
Every Austin Evans pc build video is flop
Your forehead is so shinny
But does it have a bott... Wait, wrong comment
BETTER THAN NASA SUPERCOMPUTER I GUESS...
I like your hair
Honestly i didnt understand most of the video XD
Test csgo in this configuration
Watching this after the Surface Pro Laptop review....that thing just looks so bloody amazing. Just needs a few ports.
I hate the fortnite
But can it run ROBLOX?
Hey guys, this is sponsored XD
Austin Evans is it possible to donate this amazing pc to me?
no austin, its never too late to test call of duty blackout :)
Pubg graphics are really good I don't know what you're talking about, yes when you parachute it doesn't render the whole huge map because that would make your game crash but please name one battle royal game that has better graphics.
But can it run Crysis?
1:30 6 grapichs cards
Please try passmark performance test 9
Please try blender and asus realbench
Hey Austin, I just want to let you know that your comment section is hilarious. It's one of my highlights of the day because I have nothing going on in my lyfe.
Please try microsoft solitaire
Damn Austin straight up calling out the homie linus
"now ryzen has been around for a few years"... are you sure austin
Please try fritz chess benchmark
Give me computer
You did just 2 games. Please make minecraft and universe benchmark and more
Are you kidding me? Fortnite?
Throwing shade on @linustechtips 1:22
Which keyboard are you using??
Wtf? The 8086k did a little less than 1400 on cinebench in the multi score? There is something wrong going on there, my MSI gf63 laptop with a i7 8750h did 1223 in the cinebench multi score and it's a fucking laptop of 1000 euro's. What the heck?
The RGB is not Synchronise, this is bad
Thanks for showing off your wealth
Really? Fortnite gameplay test? WTF...
Eyyyy
In building my pc whats better to use amd ryzen 3 2200g or the intel pentium gold g5400?
Why you always test fortnite it can run on every potato But i appreciate you tezt pubg too cuz that can't run on every pc
shade throwing at linus, i like it
And Im still here trying to play games without a gpu and with overheat issues.
Can I have it?
Wow just give away it to me please I am poor(with pubg and fortnite installed)please with the monitor
Title edit --Why does this gaming pc exist in 2018?
Name of the monitor pls? Anyone?
ITS COFFELAKE NOT SKYLAKE YOU UNCULTURED SWINE
Name of the monitor pls? Anyone?
In America, Austin builds the fastest gaming pc. In Soviet Russia, gaming pc builds the fastest Austin
Here I am sitting with my and a9 and Radeon r5
Lets send Austin some money so he can afford a better internet :D
now build a gaming PC as fast as possible
Is this a video
I'm assuming you have Spectrum
Which keyboard do you use in the video ? :)
He must be running AT&T
I understood nothing you said during the entire video
What monitor is that? 4K 80fps?
following LInus trend)
Ok Austin, I get Fortnite and Pubg are popular, but the run smoothly even on a 1k pc, come on.
Fortnite is not even graphically hard to run. So tired of seeing it benchmarked
The fastest the speadyest and the best
This is pure love ??
And then there's me i5 7300HQ and a GTX1050 (2GB)
Bro you gotta run like modded skyrim with crazy graphics mods to test what it can take
For gods sake Austin, pee first and then shoot the video. You’re hopping around everywhere
The Meaning of Austin : A US Tin / just a tin from US
they're both skylake cores not wrong there
damn....his forehead is shinier than my future T_T
Why not just get an Intel Xeon?
Let's make a petition to stop Austin from testing Fortnite on every computer.
I literally dont know anything he is talking about
How much is this? 5K? 7K?
Founders edition
Dibs on your old parts
Why you always wearing the same shirt
Hey Austin, would you suggest the h700i for a fresh build?
Heya Austin! Pleasure seeing you yesterday, I was the dork snapping a pic from the hall with you in the background in front of the arcade. Funny last time I saw you we were at some retro LA Arcade place. Keep up the good work!
Hey it’s, guys Austin!
how well does blender 2.8 run on this?
When I first read the title I thought you had built the PC really quickly lmao You should do it though, as fast as you can
Austin i have a video idea for you. Make one about how careful or lack of you need to be when building a gaming PC. Do some things like apply too much thermal paste, bend a few wires and notches to see if it still works which could maybe put some people at ease of building their first gaming PC.
Love that muscle ??
Oh no you got me 4:54
Thx for this video now I can imagine having this
The cable management in there looks like ass
Pour Linus
Austin throwing shots at Linus
Hey Austin I need some subscribers..
Cool, but can it run minesweeper at 60 fps huh? I dont think so.
Subscribe for more in my channel ????
Lies I'm from the future and my 99 zcore system with built in BTX 5990TI and 86tb ram is so much better than this piece of shit. Plus you still run Windows lol why not Google Skynet OS 6.
But can it run minecraft ?
Hey gaming pc this is guys this is the Austin we built just a few weeks ago Which has since seen some slight upgrades
nice
1:23 shots fired at linus
That pc setup is looking Gorgeous What is the total cost of building this pc
By the way the 9700k is. It worth it
1:30 Did I just heard from Austin that it is worth it?
Yes, It can run crysis
Live benchmarking? This channel is becoming more like LTT everyday.
Ok so, I didn't understand anything Everything was out of my mind ??????
Nice baby hands

Buys A Expensive PC plays with a default skin....

Hey Austin this is guys ????
Fortnite, The go-to game for tech reviewing channels
I see RTX in the thumbnail, I click. Simple as that.
I see RTX in the thumbnail, I click. Simple as that.
Meanwhile i got a core that's trash combined with a gtx 460 XD
Why has the de-facto design trend among gaming computers become red-and-black? Back in 2011 we used to get Alienware computers or Razer products, for instance, with all kinds of color popping up from them. I do believe some manufacturers such as MSI haven't given in to this trend, but still. Now it's mostly that: red-and-black. As if everybody loved this combination. -_-
Hello sir ji
This dude has a punchable face. Greasy looking ass fool
But can it run minecraft in low settings at 30fps??
Testing a computer with Fortnite is like doing a Facebook benchmark on the Razor phone

Shots fired at Linus

"I actually spended 10 dollars for nothing?"-Austin having a setup that it's more expensive than my fucking house
why is everybody bashing Dave? You know he is right, right?
What do you think of the RTX launch, Austin? 8:01 "Aw, this is bad, this is bad, this is bad." That's what I thought.
Seems like a good pc, but can it run office 2007?
Sponsored By Intel
this processor probably will cost less than $70 in ten years
Is the fastest gaming PC I've ever built worth it?
Hey Guys this is fastest!
But can it run minesweeper at -6000 FPS?
i want it.

You know, as someone whose first computer ran at 4mhz, it just blows my mind that I'm watching videos about 5ghz processors.
Guys a guy made the fastest NEW PSVITA it's called "PSWITCH:THE NEW PSVITA" I have no idea about this guy but i think it's pretty good!!!
I just came for Austin. The rest is just gibberish for me
I always wondered Wth do you do w/ this
Hi
Haha the mini hands are STILL in the videos XD
I have a PS4 but I’m also contemplating getting a PC. My budget is 2.5-3k any suggestions?
Hi
Nice Build! Also the case the i9 came in is looking fire!??????
You are people are so blessed sometimes I just spent over $700 gaming PC at Best Buy and I could barely run Call of Duty Black Ops 4 and I was dying for this game can afford a new graphics card bills are way too high
Cinebench is multi threaded not single.. xD oop nevermind your running single core xD
You are rich, we get it.
Hey guysss the is "AUUUSTIN"

This pc gets you a victory royale before you touch the mouse!
Hey Austin! This is guys! Thanks for showing some more EBIC Fortnite gameplay on this PC. Linus couldn't show me negligible performance improvement on an overkill PC in his videos, so that sucks.
But can it run crysis ?
Hey Austin This Is Guys Never Gets Old Right
Hello

Hey Austin, I’m looking for a laptop that I’ll probably only use for writing! I used to write a lot on my iPad but it’d be nice to have a laptop to write and then be able to print. And I kinda was thinking a MacBook so I can easily transfer things from my iPad to the MacBook, not fused if that works? But I really just need something that can use google docs over Microsoft word, primarily cuz using the iPad with Microsoft word is annoying and doesnt work without being a member. And I’m not gonna throw more money out for that. But if you have any ideas that’d be great! Thanks
Squat
But can it run Donkey Kong on Ultra settings?
:-) :-) :-)
He upgraded his 8086 to a "Core i9"? What is this Austin even talking about, the obvious upgrade from an 8086 is a 286.
But can it run Austin Evans at 60 FPS?
Hey, Austin listen, man, I love your videos. You're really good, I learn a lot but dude you gotta change the titles. To be completely honest from 2017 your titles have not been good Sometimes because of the titles I might miss a video or won't care much about it. Just keep the titles plain and simple.

ey
Small update: The Silent Base 801 does indeed have feet.....they were just buried under styrofoam at the bottom of the box. Sorry for the confusion!
At 10:00 you talk about the plastic fan mounts, where can I get them?
it would be great to see a follow up video of you adding a GPU aio liquid cooler to this!
Dosen't look like that power supply gets any airflow.
???????, ?????!
how to actually clean those little air pockets on the side if dust gets in?
cinematic crazy
1000 rpm on SilentWings? Still pretty loud, compared to my system. Also, why not use a custom fan curve on the GPU?
The Duke is such a sexy card <3
my sort of rig
I have the same bedsheets and nightstand. Yay IKEA
Bequiet's block/pump and hoses are ugly af though. Wouldn't buy that AIO for a clear side panel case unless it brought Chiller-like performance lol :D
"please turn up your volume and put on headphones" silent humming of pc "PRETTY DAMN QUIET!!"
nice case... bud i dont like the upside down installation from the motherboard..
Zowie mouse... respectable.
well you should replace the sound pads with high quality Asphalt absorbers from the car industry also no glass on the side and put a noise barrier inside like Sonozorb B (effective & non flammable) Also place it on a "acoustic module system(not blocking airflow)" like u use it in open offices to reduce sound transmission to other workplaces :) that is then really quiet :) i Did it and can not hear if it is running.
Just out of curiosity, why is it whenever I go to the links for the items to your videos, most of the time, they dont have them in stock, or are insanely high or insanely mental pricing? Example, the Silent loop 360, $172, kinda high, but $48 to ship it... or what about the Dark Power power supply, $656, only one of them, and its from somewhere with only a 65% positive rating... who in the hell is going to pay $600+ for a power supply from a very low rating...
I don't see the parts in the description ?
1200 Watt psu..talking about overkill.
How much did u spend for that pc?
you should have a tutorial on how to set this up. I was thinking of building my first PC and I really wanted my PC to run extremely powerful and extremely quiet. your video is exactly what I was looking for, so if you can help me how exactly to set this up, I would be grateful
This guy always start a video with saying "hello good people" this is so nice man. I've never saw any content creator that welcomes viewers like that. Awesome detail, thx for being nice dude!
Hi Dimitri! Thanks for another great video. Could you share what resources you use for music? I like the music you've chosen for your build montage a lot.
Finished a silence focuses build for on audio engineer last weekend. Guess the loudest part: -Yes, it indeed is the coil whining 200€ fucking BeQuiet PSU. What a fucking joke!
what is that plastic peg for installation guys ?
HC does an LTT build.
I really do not like those orange accents. Stealth looks are so much sexier.
Quiet please!
what's the background music at 13:30?
Little side note, my PC was louder watching this video than the actual video was. I turned the volume up so your voice was pretty much at shouting volume and I could still barely hear your fans over mine. My air circulation system is off right now as I'm writing this and I never noticed how loud this PC actually is until now. And I have the "Silent" series fans from Thermaltake...
Awesome video! I've been trying to decide on my next case for the last six months, I've been looking at anything from the Thermaltake Core V21 to the Phanteks P350X, but this has made up my mind. BeQuiet build here I come!
Great editing, really informative. I'm subscribed! Only critisism I'd give is when you're doing the sound comparison please make some kind of visual que before you speak! Damn near blew my eardrums back into my skull.
Great video! I enjoyed it. I have a question, as I am looking for new fans, I am about to built a new build in Evolve X case, but I want new fans for it. Which is your recommended RGB fans? Sexy ones that isn't "too" loud. Keep up the great work!
Why didn't you install the case feet? I own this case and I know that it does have them.
Quality editing :) great job on this video!
Nice video, I have always been interested in having a pretty quiet PC as I usually have mine in my living room and it is obviously annoying to have a loud PC.
can gigabyte h97-gaming 3 with i5 4460 run without gpu?
"Quietest build!!!"... Goes with an AIO and 7200rpm HDDs... What the F...
150$ is a lot for the case, especially that case.
The question is: will there be an all 140mm fan 2018 case that doesn't choke your hardware (and doesn't look like it's from the SciFi 80s @ Cooler Master)
nice. im running my 9900k at 5.2 ghz on all cores.
Headphone users turn up your volume "SO THIS IS LOAD VOLUME" fml
I had to turn up the volume on this video because of the noise of my PC
Also....a Asrock mobo? Pure crap. Asus are far superior.
Dimitry you’re CANADIAN. So act like it and say Z PROPERLY. Zee is WRONG Zed is CORRECT
quietest without NOCTUA doesn't exist .
PSU doesn't have 0-RPM mode ? this is just an ad.
I have a 570x with a strix 1080 at the bottom pci e slot which gives it 2cm for airflow and I don't think its loud...
If you want it to be even quieter, use closed side panel with noise dampener, put the PC under your desk. I'm thinking of a wall mounted PC case so I can hang it behind my table to block the maximum amount of noise while also removing the big box from the way. Any better ideas? I want max silence, don't plan to showcase the PC itself.
i like to target 60c on cpu :)
So? Did you bump the fans up since the case is pretty awesome? I would. A couple more decibels higher would give you excellent cooling performance. Just under 80c temps still feels a little toasty for me.
The Ultimate Terrible Launch PC Build Get it ? :v
Shit already accidentally turned it off
Turn your volume up, get your headphones. PrEtTy DaMn QuIeT
I love be quiet!
This is a dramatically quiet machine... it's fantastic, but for me personally, if I owned that machine it would eat me up inside to leave that bit of performance on the table with the 9900k... I would want to max out my boost pushing it at high as I could with whatever configuration i could come up with for overclocking it. to maintain the silence, and perhaps increase it some, I might tinker with the idea of moving to a full custom loop with front and top mounted radiators and get the gpu in on the liquid cooling action as well so you can overclock the lot while still maintaining ridiculously low volume.
my GOD dat production/editing.
I have always liked your reviews of cases Dmitry. This is another one of those greats! Your story telling at the beginning of the video is also a welcome for someone like me. Those little intros really add a flair to your videos reviews. Thank you, for all the work you do.
I bought and built my new pc in this same case and I had difficulty with the rubber mounts staying on, and getting my mb screws in for my Asus z370a prime. Also one of the tabs on the vent broke clean off with little force when trying to take it off. Other than that the two fans it comes with plus my Asus 1070 strix make for a quite and cool machine. Also I have a question for anyone out there than can answer. What are the best cable accessories “cable mods” I should buy. I’m looking to do a cleaner cable management job for my rig and wonder what company would be the best to order these from.
You missed the chance for a pun. You should have ended with "Remember, Be Quiet!"
11:08 that's some incredible Hz
I got a haircut this weekend too!!
OMG this Setup is so cool but so expensive.. can just dream about it!
I love quiet PC builds. This video was awesome!
I have my radiator with 2 noctua NF A12x25 and 3 Corsair LL for the rest of my case (it's a nzxt Manta), quiet as F.
I'd be interested in seeing if you flipped the rear fan to intake cool air if your now positive pressure would improve the aio rad cooling and thus lower the cpu temp.
It this wasn't clearly sponsored by BeQuiet you could make it more quiet with a noctua NH-D15 for the CPU and an AIO solution for the GPU where it goes full passive on idle (like the Gigabyte 980 ti waterforce). The temps that you are getting are way off the charts IMHO (too hot). Edgy video, not for real enthusiasts.
I love how quickly things have switched between Intel and AMD. Just a couple years ago, Intel ran cool as a cucumber and AMD would be oven hot. Now Intel is nuclear hot and AMD is cool as a cucumber.
Whats his accent if anybody knows
Masterpiece!
This case is one of the WORST case to build on..along side the darkbase 900 pro rev 2..have to move around multiple parts every time you have to change/add things.
When the new 9980xe comes put it will dominate any thread ripper
My computer isnt quiet but its not loud enough to be annoying. While gaming Cpu temps of my i5 8400 went to high 40's low 50's Gpu1(rx 580 8gb) went to about low 60's and Gpu2 (game doesnt support 2 graphics cards) went to mid 30's
Wtf is that hairstyle...shit go back to the "before haircut Dmitry"
Great video, I just put together a quite PC with a 9700k and noctua u14 cooler on that same z390 taichi. My wife said she doesn't like my system being so quiet because now I can hear her fart when she is watching TV in the other room.
Thank you!!
i want to "BeQuiet" plis
Nice Video, but I would prefer the dark rock pro 4 instead of the aio.
But then my wallet would start screaming and yeah i dont want that.
WOW.... 1 million already huh ? CONGRATZ LADS. That's impressive.
Yooo Dmitry,whats your Bnet? Lets grind D2 together. Lol
No rgb = Silent Pc
honestly i love my jet engine XD no need of silence if you use a potent headset :|
Shut up!
Damn
Demtri please review the tachi ultimate!!!
My DB Pro 900 system makes the exact same sound....
The loudest parts of my Pc were power supply and hard drive, changing both lowered the noise substantionally.
The 801 case without a window is it even quieter or is the no difference??
????
I doubt that Be quiet was the first to use noise dampening material in a computer case . Antec came out with the P183 in 2009 that had noise dampening material, Be Quiet introduced its first midi case in 2014.
open the window, i wanna know how quiet it is after collecting dust
Youtubers keep shilling that overpriced Intel oven and the EXTREMELY overpriced 2080 series.
Canuck Power
I swapped my stock h110 fans for 2 noctua nf-a14 and the exhaustfan to a noctua nf-s12a chromax my cpu dropped 5 degrees in idle and the pc is way quieter.
my bluetooth speaker wouldn't turn on for the first minute of this video. turns out I didn't miss anything
Want it even more silent from where you are sitting? Place it in a different room. . .
You forgot to measure the sound levels of your wife (which I assume would be around 110 dB).
Is it my phone speakers or you sound low-key robotic?
Running at 75 degrees under a 360 aio?! That thing runs damn hot
Meanwhile my gigabyte 2080ti is loud as shit cause the cooler and fans are garbage
scruffy hair is better!
the price make me screaaaaam...
so what would be the difference between Noctua and Be Quiet,if there's any?
What brand is the sweater you were wearing???
Remove plant before watering.
mine runs at 29.7dba :)(idle~medium load) at one meter , integrated amplifier transformer buzz is louder than my pc at one meter (1080ti, 4670k @ 4.4ghz, 2x140mm, 4x120mm all running 300~400rpm during idle) all air cooled
so watercooling the gpu would be even better ?
loud in my books, gotta get a custom loop if you want to be cool and quiet. GPU fans are the worst offenders in my books.
Just moved my Ryzen 1700X system over from a Define S case to a Dark Base 700 and besides looking better it's actually a little quieter gaming under load (when the 1080Ti spins up). Both cases were near-silent at idle.
going to need to OC the bedroom for more oomph~ ;)
My pc is just like that and it’s silent
Fractal Define R6 any day!
Why is the amazon link German? Lol
Well done be quiet!
to hott for me unless im trying to warm my house
So Dimitri, where are you from? Because you're accent is amazingly interesting. I can't place it.
mine is quieter than this one and i still think it is too loud LOL
Says silent uses clc with a pump, srsly...
7:51 Music?
An easy way to have a silent PC is having your CPU delidded and then run it at stock or a light OC.
Ayyyy slick haircut
Stress the system with a 3D rendering, everything at 100% (CPU+GPU+IGPU). Premiere was not pushing it at max.
they need to ditch the orange.
I've owned 2 be quiet PSU's, and they both died about 6 months after the 3 year warranty expired. Get those long PSU warranties people!!!
I want to build a PC, knowing which software I’ll be using, with specific hardware, kind of “optimization”. Where do I start?
nice hair
Did they fix the Silent Loop pump making horrible noise after 2 month ? People considering it should check buyer feedback and video youtube showcasing the issue.
Please review the sound blaster x ae5.
They way you open your videos is always amazing. Nice work my dude. :3
I'm in Canada and I can't find any of those Be Quiet stuff on any of the local retailers. :(
Gorgeous video * . *
To really have the quietest and best performance, you need Noctua fans.
Can you use a radiator in front of this case and still install HDDs or you have to remove all the cages to install the radiator?
Damn dude taichi is big dick energy.
I've got three Silent Wings 3 (2x 140mm + 1x 120mm) and a beQuiet Shadow Rock Slim. My PC is sitting right beneath me on the desk and I can't hear anything. GPU is the MSI Gaming X 1060 6GB and case is the NZXT H500.
Mr steal his hat got stole his hat.
Would have run a lot more Cool and Quiet if you would have made it a Ryzen build.
What if the next video is not sponsored by bquiet and you put to good use those 6 noctua fans you have hiding there somewhere to see if the system is quieter and/or cooler?
Shintel
For silence you need a water cooled GPU. Maybe an EVGA Hybrid with its AIO and aftermarket fans would work better when the hybrid is available.
U need noiseblocker fans man
I actually lowered my volume right as he was saying "Let's tone it down" lol. Coincidence? I think not
PRETTY DAMN QUITE!!
Quiet at 4.7ghz is easy to achieve with other cases too. That defeats the point. We want quiet WITH performance. 5ghz quiet case. CMON !!!!!
The solution is to use a Ryzen cpu, or at least, not a lower power intel chip. Reducing the need to cool, means fewer, slower fans, and 1 less pump because watercooling isn't essential anymore. Also, Rubber HDD mounts, or SSHD's (they have 5400rpm disks instead of 7200) Or just pure SDD's Make those fixes and you won't even need a restrictive case for sub ambient noise. If you must watercool, absolutely add the GPU to the loop, as the GPU has louder fans than you can buy for cases and radiators.
Just noticed, non of your videos are 60FPS.
I want that sweatshirt
Any build like this is extremely silent when you compare it to the screams of agony coming from your bank account xD
30db is loud AF, its silent because you live in a loud environment, in my room its 25db , put a 30ish db PC i guaranteed you can instantly spot it , sub 25db is real silent pc
Why does the i9 get really hot
dont get the point of "quite pc" pcs are already quite XD even with my cheap ass shitty "Vivo smart case" which came damaged and bent, the pc is a foot away from me and i BARELY can hear it
without the stands can't breath from the bottom
Sorry but the case have stands but you didn't instaled
i couldn't hear the noise comparison because my pc was too loud.
You should use asus rtx2080ti with its quiet bios preset is the quietest all rtx2080ti.
I had a dream that my power supply was shooting fire ?? so I jumped up ( at midnight) and turned my pc on ....everything was ok
Silent pc with an aio. Press X to doubt
U literally cant say quiet after youve said i9 9900K.... Its extremely hot so it needs strong and loudy cooling.
That's an ugly case!
water cooling on a silent build ?? WTF !!!
Based solely on your goal, I would send those fans you last installed back as it didn't make a difference in quietness...wasted money. Appreciate this video and your videos...I always learn something new.
I need a good gaming headset without a mic
Fuckboi hair.
that gpu sag tho :(
why not just passively cool it all?
I can still easily hear the fans and the changing frequency when you shut it off and the fans slowly stop spinning but it is reasonably quiet for such a powerhungry system. Some good advice which I missed in this video: you can also lower the power draw strongly while loosing little performance by lowering the voltage and to some extend the clock frequency, depending on the hardware and what you use it for.
Nice video. Now I want to make a new build. I built a silent PC 3 years ago. It was so silent I failed to notice it was on sometimes. And even under load I could clearly hear the fans but it was still a nice sound. Now after 3 years my MSI graphic cards fans are starting to get old. One of the fans has a rattling noise. It's subtle but I have very good hearing so I notice it quite often. So bye bye ultimate silence. Same story with my new Asus Zenbook UX331UAL I just bought. I wanted an ultrabook for my studies, which usually have great portability and battery life. Unfortunately the CPU fan, which is the only moving part in this laptop is probably a little faulty cause it also has some rattling noise. Of course the fan is so thin you can't expect too much but I didn't think a new fan would make some rattling noise. It was very noticable at the beginning but ist a little bit better now. Still even with Quiet Fan Mode ON the fan turns sometimes at very low rpm and when I am in a very silent room and I put my ear closer to the laptop I can hear it. Which is very annoying. I am such a silence freak I am even considering to return this laptop and buy one which has no fans :/
Pc pornography in a nutchshell
Hey Dmitry - I would love to see a video where you guys strap a couple of silent wings onto a GPU heatsink, as a replacement for the stock fans - I'm considering doing this myself as well.
That case isn't supposed to sit flush on the desk or carpet, it actually comes with rail type feet that lift it a bit up and give it a wider stance for stability.
Just drop tdp to 135W and you can use air coolers easily. All core 5GHz draws under 90W in games. Stop scaring people into bying 250€ motherboards and 150-200€ coolers, when you can oc as high with 150€ motherboard and 50€ air cooler if you just play games and dont want to run avx @5GHz.
Nice transition with the hair.
cant exactly say why, but it dont feel comfortable with 75° cpu temps. especialy not when the case is next to me on the desk. i can feel the heat coming off of my case after 2 hours of gaming and that borthers me more then fan noise
Nice video but where do you placed the casefeet? You have to attach them after unpacking the case. They are stored in the styrofoam in a additional location.
didnt the bigg guy from linus test aitflow restriction is a myth. unles you put it full of cloth
Got everything watercooled with a 360 on top and a 240 at the front, all ek Vardar except for 1 noctua fan at the front. The Vardar fans start spinning at 60° on the CPU so until I game there is almost no noise, I can only hear it when I hold my ear directly next to the front.
No USB type C, not on my wishlist. I really like the be quiet design and colors etc but R6 still top of my list.
Why are you promoting this ENERMAX garbage AIO? Just look at the reviews on Amazon and other sites. I bought their fans too because I liked the looks, now I'm sending them back because they are loud as hell.
stop putting that little dumb plant on every rig.
I would buy be quiet itx case... Something that has same look and quality like this but small like qbx kaze...
I understand sponsorship by Be quiet, but thats not a way to build a silent PC at all! No glass for silence, and no AIOs, you should have gone with Dark Rock Pro 4 that is even quieter than NHD15, and both being quieter than any AIO pump as well as on par with performance. For the rear you should have swapped the stock fan with a Silent Wings 3 120mm HS PWM and move the rear stock fan to the front. Optionally one more 120mm fan to the front. And if you want to go really "extreme" you could dress the psu shroud with be quiet's noise dampening mat that has a huge effect when GPUs ramp up their fans. Then create custom fan curves for the fans with the rear being tied to both GPU/CPU to rump up to whatever its hotter. The 2 lower front fans to the GPU and the 1 higher fan on the front to be tied to the CPU. Imho that way not only you would end up using more products from your sponsor, but also a 2 part video probably for hardware build and software tuning/temp monitoring.
I was surprised when I heard the results about being so quiet.
So many haters in the commentz! PAID VIDEO PAID VIDEO ! So Dimitry praised them,and will use them for his build,but they are utter garbage,and loud,just to get a little $$$? Why you guys watch Hardware Canucks then if they're such lying greedy scumbags?
That's the next upgrade for my system, switching the RGB SP120 Corsairs for bequiet! fans. Loosing the RGB goodness but they are SOOOOOOOO loud, it's not even funny
Custom loooop
Why didnt you USE the bequiet cpucooler... you know, the one with a fan
Why not the Gaming X Trio, it has much better overclocking capabilities
Wouldn't be so warm with 2700X.
I need a new case and the 801 Window is the one I need ????
hmm. what is diffference (prefomance) is between be quiet 801 and Fractal Design R6? vs. video?
Sponsored by be quite...... Plugs in enermax promo ??.
The Shadow Wings have 9 smaller blades and the Silent Wings 2 and 3 each have 7 bigger ones. Does that mean that the Shadow Wings is better suited for airflow and are best used as exhaust fans while the Silet Wings are better suited for intake and pushing air through the CPU cooler and harddrive cage because they can build a higher static pressure?
Great video my dude!
I Got a fucking titanic 2 ad xD
Define R4, Noctua fans, NH-U14S, 30% fan speed on GPU. Inaudible.
AIO and silence... Not exactly, eh
I'll leave you guys with a tip. When you use identical fans they create a harmonic noise, which adds to each other. If you mix and match quiet fans from different manufacturers with different blade designs, and change up the fan speed RPM, you can create a noise DEADENING effect by killing the harmonizing effect caused by similar fans/speeds. I used this effect to make a dead silent (for my ears) build with a non-silent case and non-silent fans. By taking advantage of slow and quiet spinning fans, all from different manufacturers, and intentionally changing up their speeds, using a mix of active and active/passive cooling you can put an aggressive overclock and keep your system dead silent.
How about a silent fanless 9600 build with 1070ti?
I'm so used to my PS4 getting so loud that my PC with only two stock fans sound miraculous.
very quiet wow good
Man Whew that was quiet and sexy... great video... fun
I think it's time for me to go from Jet engin to Tesla. Bad exemples ik. I need me those fans :)
Someone call Linus.
Please dont say to turn up the volume and put on headphones then talk at normal volume! OUCH
Thats not quiet , sounds like AC
nice work and i see you downloaded RTX, cool
I bought a silent base 600 literally three days ago to build my rig into it (600 because I still use optical drives). It's not silent (my components aren't extremely quiet), but I'm still very happy with it. On idle, under my desk, the noise is barely noticeable, and when I crank up the fans to play some games, it does get a bit louder, but still quieter than my PC in my old case on idle, and definitely nothing you would call loud. Temperatures are good too, even with just the two case fans. I'll probably add more in time, but it's doing really well even like this. Recommended!
OK HALF THE VID IS ABOUT THE CASE JUST BUILD IT
We want silent at optimum performance not just silent at low speeds
Those plastic pegs are pain if you want to take out and clean the fans!
do you think it's silence? Yes but hot inside because intel inside
wow that Asrock board actualy looks great
Let's make a commercial What a shit video
I don’t like the pop off side panel with that button. I actually prefer the look with the screws on the side like of that on the Dark Base Pro 900.
be quiet!!
just dont use any fans, fans=noise, ez clap
noctuas are still better
I may have to check out their cases, etc.
How does the GPU with that beefy cooler does not have any sag? I'm surprised.
Finally a building without RGB !!! Very nice without the RGB hell!
kinda not quiet..
If u use this case than nobody would say "Be quiet" So Be Quiet was the first company to use sound dampening material on cases. Interesting. That's how u totally justify brand name????
6 minutes talking about the case!!
The quality is amazing, I can't believe you are shooting this on GH5! Probably one of those F1.4 glasses...
In my case I have a total of 18 fans (including fans on the Gfx card(2) and mobo(2)). 5x filtered Intake 140mm Noctua NF-P14 (idle <600rpm load<780rpm) & 1x filtered intake 120mm Noctua NF-P12 (constant <750rpm) and through the Corsair H150i PRO AIO is 3x PUSH exhaust 120mm Noctua NF-F12(2k) (idle <570rpm load<630rpm) and 3x PULL 120mm Corsair ML series (constant <750rpm), custom fitted 40mm fan for the mobo Vcore heatsink(constant <2220rpm), 2x fans on MSI GTX970 (idle <696rpm load<1800rpm), 2x mobo fans (constant rpm ~2601rpm & ~3000rpm), PSU Fan Corsair HX850i (idle <0rpm load<780rpm) now the dB @ idle the room is too noisy to be able to get an actual reading but it is <29dB@1m (with pc off room doesn't get quieter) at load it is <34dB@1m with CPU temp @load is 36c under TJMax and GPU max is 72c@load. People can't believe that 18 fans can be so quiet and the rig runs perfectly cooled. Positive air pressure FTW (if filtered correctly).
"The only whine you'll hear from this PC is the one coming from your wallet"
HardwareCanucks can just build an even quieter PC without side glass panels lol
BeQuiet! liked this video.
this pc is a like a girl/man who's so hot and you're gonna happy with for the rest of your life
When you tell us to turn up the volume and put on headphones, but then talk loudly. Trollololol
Built my quietest PC spending $0... *Imagination*
I made my quietest PC spending $0... *Imagination*
Silent but deadly...??
Intel has made underclocking mainstream. This is progress?
hey you! be quiet! (pun totally intended)
That's a very impressive result . I've got a quiet system with an r7 1800x (with a noctua nh-d15 2 fan 140) and a 2080ti FE. My system is 35 db on light load 42 db in heavy load (heavy games 2080 ti at 75% fan speed) and 45db at full load (measures at 2 cm from the case side glass pannel) I used phanteks fans (2x140) for input and deepcool fans (1x140 +2x120) for output and two small 60 fans in input right near the gpu (with ball bearings). At the end with my mobo fans calibration i've obtained a preatty solid neutral airflow in a quiet system with good performance for value ... well there are some ecceptions ... you know a 2080 ti is not the best performance for value gpu at moment but... whatever. Just a little curiosity . How much noisy is the cpu cooler ? Liquid coolers usually are not too much quiet ... But this is a bequiet one and bequiet can do the magic trick !
This guy is such a be quiet fangay
awesome case...but it doesn't offer much under the budget line.. btw nice build dimitri ...
do you know how quiet my laptop is? it has no fans...
Come on dimitri, you can’t say put on headphones and turn up the volume and then start talking.
... PRETTY DAMN QUIET
i honestly think with a meshify or similar airflow case, you might get better temps and sound, your gpu wouldnt be as starved of cold air, therefore not needing to have a high fan curve, and the cpu with the AIO wouldnt be hot boxing itself due to the terrible top panel design on the silentbase 801, just my 2 cents
This is a really nice video...especially for people not interested in custom loops and RGB...aesthetic, clean and quiet. :)
Perfect. My planned build, awesome to see it with my eyes. Great job as always, now I'm not scared of thermals with a silent system..
Your face-to-head ratio is low.
Cant beat my custom WC build who runs at lowest RPM fans at any load with good temps and good overclock on cpu and gpu. Only noise is a bit of coil whine of my ass provided by nvidea
Does the case come with the plant pot?
mini itx be quite case??
That hair is lookin pretty dapper!
silent pc isn't a thing for me since its quite noisy around my house
What’s up Dmitry good people here
QUIETEST i think you just invented that word for the video :D
Mine is more quite
What if you swapped out the bq fans for the Noctua A12's?
honestly hope the cooling methods of CPU/GPUs will be innovated by a clever person soon. It's just counter intuitive that the hot air spewed out by your GPU ends up going up through the top radiator if you have your top mounted radiator on exhaust. Conversely if you have a front mounted radiator with intake that would have pre-warmed air reaching your GPU. Maybe a case with a separate radiator chamber where the air passes from outside through the rad and back outside? I know the case jayztwocents uses for his skunkwork's pc has a bottom radiator chamber, but there's no mid tower or even full tower PC cases with this implemented.
I couldn't hear it at 13:15 cause my computers too loud.
Why not compare the noise levels with other desktop builds?
1200 watt RiP my bill
Hardware can you please donate me a Gaming pc any would be good i really enjoy watching gaming videos and i would really like to experience gaming i dont have a gaming or a console please i cant afford a gaming pc and i can get money cause i am still 13 please
Good job for load noise. Idle, my pc is silent, gaming ummm just no lol.
can i get an id on that hoodie it's fresh
Man that subscribe picture at the bottom right corner always pops up at the best time
If only they didn't have orange on their stuff. I hate orange.
dark rock pro 3 is more silent than silent loop 360 with noisy pump...
10 fans PSU has 1 fan and GPU has 3 fans. ??
How much did u spend on this? ??
If you want a REALLY silent system you have to use custom loop components but this is still a very nice gaming pc and probably silent enough for the vast majority of people. I personally prefer custom loops but I get why most people wouldn't build one because of the price and a (small) risk of damaging your components.
Silent loop 360 is not worth it, I went through 3 of them in one year, after 4-5 months they all started to make a loud grinding sound.
13:13 Jesus Christ mate, a warning would have been nice and less painful to my ears.
Here is a bit of info.. The BIGGER the fan the less noise..   Tested this back in 2010..   Small fans are the worst.. Anything under a 140mm fan isn't an option. Do a custom water loop with external water box..  PC = (3) 200 mm fans and one 230mm, water box has cards and CPU on loop. Don't even have to worry about fan RPMs.. I don't get anywhere near the temps on the rig in this video.
Dig the haircut and the build!
Does it come in all white
Nice Haircut ^_^
The pump of your be quiet CLC will fail sooner or later ;)
Metallic gear case review?
I know you said everything was at stock speeds, but did you undervolt the CPU/GPU? I'm a fan (pun intended) of keeping hardware at stock speeds and lowering the voltage for improved efficiency, temps, and fan noise. I undervolt almost every computer I have. Most CPU/GPUs have extra stock voltage for safety and overclocking headroom, but at stock speeds you don't need it, and you can get much lower results with some tweaking.
I just got the 601 and it's better than my 900 little baffled by that
Biggest problem for building a silent pc is pump noise and coil whine. I've tried doing a small noiseless itx build. But the waterpump is a pity, the coil whine and the fact that blower cards is often most suitable in small cases, but nobody makes silent blower cards...
3:42 there is a gap but you took off the side mounted feet closing the gap
yOu WoUlD'Ve HaD bEtTeR tEmPs AnD lOwEr DeCiBeLs WiTh NoCtUa!
Why does dimitry have the best b rolls
Love me some be quiet! Just got the Dark Power Pro 11, and together with 6 be quiet! fans in my system, it's so nicely quiet<3
????????? ? ????? ????? ?? ??????? ???????????! ?? ?? ? ?????????... ?, ? ?? ????? ?? ????????? ????, ??????
Sexy
I like Be Quiet!'s products, but their company name and their logo are absolutely cringe-worthy. I only use their products when my case has no windows and their logo is hidden from view. So I certainly wouldn't ever use a case with the logo emblazoned on the front.
It is nice, quiet and high end PC
You make the best you tube videos man
I told my mom i wanted to build a PC and she told me BE QUIET! I said ok.??
I’ve put that in every one of my comments for months
Please take a look at the new arctis 2019 and the rival 650 from SteelSeries
I remember the old days where once you turn on a PC, it was noisy like a car engine. Hearing the drives spin up, and the fans starting. We came a long way since then
No fans can beat the new noctua fans in silence
top tier stuff as always
I have the AIO from Enermax and I can't recommended it. I got it with air inside, its louder than my whole system and the leds on the pump and the fans are flickering on every mode and almost every colour. Only in blue they are not flickering. The only good thing is that the temps are nice.
5930k at 4.5GHz (1.28v) cooled with an NZXT x62, GPU is a 1080Ti FTW3 Hybrid. Loudest thing in my box is the pump on the EVGA hybrid cooler =P That's just a nice gentle hum. All noctua fans at ~800RPM unless temps break 80C, which is rare. I have an older video of it on my channel with a slightly different setup.
Magnificent editing Dimitri!
Guess you never built an HD Plex
even the RGB is quiet
Cummmm
Liquid cooling the GPU would reduce noise and temps.
Did you get a haircut mid-video? :D
If only that "beautiful glass" panel was solid black, instead of windowed. Nothing like being distracted by the internal lights of a PC, especially one like this that would double as a HTPC. You get a silent case, but one that's high in visual pollution.
Horrible airflow design.
Very cool video!
killer any audio pc in a studio needs to be quiet as possible....
PRETTY DAMN QUIET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dammit Dmitri, I had my speakers at 50 percent LOL
The Damn Quiet Award!
Mr reach himself created a fabulous beast Im 15 btw and im watching tech channels like these that i feel like 20 and 30 year old people watch.
I've been liking these new Be Quiet cases but none of them have come to Canada yet :/
Why not just turn the System Volume down...
Wouldn't you achieve the same silence results with a custom watercooler? Price wise I think that would be the same since be quiet is not cheap...
only way to go silent is with a full custom water loop and ek vardar 1850 rpm fans. My Core P5 is 100% silent with maxed fan speeds. ??
My tower is relatively the exact same as this besides the CPU cooler. I have a delidded 8700k with a Dark Rock Pro cooler. I was thinking about using BeQuiet's water cooler, but it had more moving parts, the fans + pump, instead of the Dark Rock Pro, which is just a heatsink with fans. I love it as you can't tell the system is powered on, unless you search for some type of LED or looking at the monitor.
why the duke ? the trio is quieter
should't you place the radiator at the front so you can avoid negative pressure??
Another great video. Awesome editing, narrative and information. Cooling a hot CPU without noise is certainly a nice challenge.
I guess if the accent color was not orange, they would sell much more...
0:05 Wow! A $300 DAC
I've been intrigued by Be Quiet's (technically "be quiet!") silence-focused pc gear for a while. I've been looking at building a powerful, yet quiet system, and this is the very purpose of this company's existence, so you would think they excel at this. They're a German company with an English name, yet their AIO cooler isn't available in the US for some reason on their site (some forums said legal reasons, but who knows). It's now available on Amazon (legal loophole?), so I just might pull the trigger and build an all Be Quiet system (case, fans, AIO cooler, power supply).
6 fans at 1000rpm? That is noisy. Silent fans run below 200rpm. They wong't even register with that meter of yours.
very nice, i like this silent experiments
Whats interesting is that my OG Xbox One-s fan is preatty quiet still after 4 years of use... but the coil vine and the hard drive is so loud that you cant hear the fan at all. I cant even sleep if the xbox is turned off and not totally unplugged :(
6 fans... pffft I have 18 fans on my Mercury S8 all fans controlled by my Aquaero 6 and all fans run at 300RPM. And I guarantee it’s quieter than this.
No USB C in front? WTF???
honestly, your hair was better before
You guys really are an inspiration. Wish to start my own tech channel. All of the luck and prosperity to you guys!
Actually creating a positive pressure inside the case - more intake fans than outtake - makes it also quieter, maybe you should try this!! :)
Canucks ASMR channel coming soon...
I really like silent Pcs but this is jut a 15 min ad
What about the streacom db7
A Suggestion: When you tell the audience to turn on Sound on a high Level and use headphones.... DON'T TALK. Also indicate when the Sound test is over. Like use 3,2,1, and 3,2,1 blackscreens for Start and end
2:35 are those case feet optional accessories? You should have ended the video with "Be Quiet my friends." ;)
Try out an Arctic Accelero Xtreme III for your gpu, at least it supports rtx 2080, so it might also support 2080ti
I was actually looking at doing a whole new setup with Ryzen and this exact be quiet case as i really love orange colours and even though black and red is my favorate for a setup, i think this would just look even more stylish. Plus i play a lot of competitive games so the silence would be amazing. I need to watch more of the video but this case already makes me tingle in anticipation.
Would be great to test it with air cooling like Dark Rock Pro. Many people don't like watercooling.
Quietest? How about the FANLESS build you did? Shoulda named this vid the quietest pc we build with sponsored parts.
You have a really good Taste. I Love it
when bae says I’m ready 0:11
Why not the NF-A12x25?
@HardwareCanucks Please note at 9min07sec that in your SPL meter, you are using the F (fast) curve, used for impact noises. Please change to S(slow) to have a correct SPL reading.
my wallet will screaming like a baby mandrake :(
That editing...
What TKL keyboard is that?
this case without a window would be nice. i don´t like windows on my pc case
cablemod 24pin but no cablemod 2x8pin pcie ;-;
That is far from the best parts to achieve a quiet pc and I highly doubt it's the quietest you have ever built. I understand you have bills to pay but shilling for BeQuiet does not pass on to your viewers accurate information. Noctua fans have a better sound to performance ratios. A custom loop with a watercooled gpu is always quieter. There are better case options...etc.
Are bequiet! fans quieter than Noctua?
Everyone uses headphones anyways. This build is only useful for falling asleep while watching videos. ....like this one
I feel like one of the Aorus motherboards would have matched the black and orange look of the case more
Been a while since I've watched one of your videos and just saw that you have 1 million subs. Congrats!
Hate when the AIO tubing runs across your RGB ram...ruins the athsetics.
I literally just installed two noctua fans into my system and its unbelievable how quite my PC now is. Before it sounded like a airplane and now it's just a relief for my ears and concentration
Should call it Silent Scope Build... providing that Konami doesn't sue lol
calling 1000 rpm fans silent is bs...
ditch the 9900k for a ryzen or TR and you are going to run faster and cooler
it's so silent
Very good integration of the 801 name as the time in the beginning.
Mabe, you would have better cpu temperatures if you put the 360 rad at the front so that it is sucking fresh air and not the hot air that is coming from the gpu. But still a nice system??????. +rep
Silent, but deadly for your wallet.
Honestly the loudest part of your pc is not even the fans on idle running, It's the Hard drives that are spinning at 7200 RPM in a enclosure that is tightly mountain on a cheap aluminum panel that vibrates and loudens the noise I fixed this by simply putting them vertical in the bay with Soft plastic wrap on the sids of the bay which dramaticly lowered the sound and thus the vibrations
Was the load test only CPU stress?
That hair sketch was 300 IQ! :D
your system would be much more silent with a passively cooled gpu, e.g. on a palit kalmx card. also, the current Asrock boards tend to run more power through the 9900K. it is quite possible they run much cooler on other boards and thus asking less performance of the cooling system
I am buying this case for my i9 9900k and 2080 build. :3
at 13:21 i heard a fan ticking before everything spun down dont know what it was but might want to check for a bad fan or i could be wrong and it could be the pump for the aio i have never been near an aio or have owned one so ill leave up to you guys to figure it out
00:35 that reveal tho
GPU coil whine?
sponsorship aside, consider air flow and air pressure, which fan do you think is quieter, noctua A12x25 PWM or bequiet silent wings 3?
When you build the quietest PC, but a coil whine completely destroys it... XD
SHUT UP!
don't like those Be quiet cases.. Fractal Design is much nicer lol
Add another 140mm to the front and call it a day!
Nice & quiet!
i dont think its fair for people to display adverts with these guys they make even fingerprints and ddust on stuff look good
nice hair :D
I wish I can build my own pc but I’m stuck with a prebuilt that my dad has decided what I should get. Also it’s a brand people hate most and I wish it wasn’t that brand so I don’t get hate from owning one already. :(
If I could go back
Which air cooler can you recommend for 9900k?
Undervolt the CPU
In my computer with (VERY) cheap fans that came with the case (that was overprices compared to USA prices), the loudest thing is my GPU. It is so loud that I don't even see the point of investing in case fans. :| P.S. Is it possible (if i get good case fans) to impact the temps so big that the GPU gets quieter? The GPU is RX580 Nitro+
It would have been quieter and faster if you did a custom loop with 2 360mm rad's or something
Where do you connect all the AIO fans?
Rip air pressure for this build
everything is good, but gpu fans are not quiet. Remove stock fans and put be quiet fans. Perfection ??
I do count 10 fans -> 3 AIO 3 case 3 GPU and 1 Psu. Otherwise that's a pretty interesting build. Would love to see a noctua version of this.
I recently bought some 140mm Pure Wings 2 fans... even 1 of those on low is noisier than 3 Nanoxia deep silence fans at full speed.
PC Porn at its finest ??
I've changes the stock cooler on my GPU to a Morpheus II with 2x 140mm Noiseblocker eloop (liked the colour) and liquid metal. The fans never go faster than 500rpm (it is set to 0% fan speed in msi afterburn, but the fans don’t have a zero-fan speed mode) and GPU gets a max 55 C. So, maybe you could switch the cooler for an overall quieter experience.
i have a cheaper way and thats dont buy a 9900k
MOAR BLACK PC BUILDS!
Great setup
It's quiet riot!
Very good vid
Dark power pro 11 is too beautiful to put it in that shroud.
Gz for mil
Old hair was better
Just an ad
wow, this is truly awesome, it is what I will stive for when I get the budget.
Great looking system, not so flashy and in your face, as the typical gaming PC. :) Silent Wings 3 has become my absolute favorite fans over the last few years. I'm running them in my main system as well, and i just gotta say, after i moved away from exotic cooling, and started using the be quiet fans, the joy of using that system is so much higher. Quiet is just more pleasant. :) Though, i do miss the looks that water cooling offers.
7:52 start the build
3:45 What kind of awful person would but this then put it on carpet?
Its not a silent PC at all if you have an AIO. Pumps are loud.
im useing 6 140mm silent wings 3 fans and an darkrockpro 3, and even at full load. its a litle humming like noise but not that loud. im happy with it :)
You say the quietest tower, but I see no custom water cooling. My tower is quieter than that.
what about the fractal r5? they advertised it at 21.2 dB....
Looks nice besides the quiet. But Intel should know better...I mean I get real tired of having to delid CPUs even now with the 9900k soldered sTIM. Shame on intel. I for one do not consider 80c acceptable at load. I wonder how this would do with a full custom loop?
Really good color and composition through out all video. I'd say its a neat video
I got stock Intel fan. I dont care, i am not gonna hear it over the game sound
Link to the music?
Speaking of sound, will you guys ever review the sound blaster x ae5, or compare it to external dacs, given that you are one of the few larger tech channels that review audio gear?
Liar! you had build the Fanless Streacom's DB4 before. This is not the quietest. That build also had an external gpu.
liqfusion: (h?) ttp:// [..]
Why not try some Corsair ML fans? How would they compare.
Every video has dislikes. But why
The loudest part in my system is my 3 TB hardrive (which I acutally need) (at idle)
Those are very quiet fanes
its almost 2019 how come no1 fix the gpu sagging yet?
Should have used a FE 1080Ti and a intel stock cooler for your silent build, I have heard a lot of things about there sound levels...
Sexy haircut!
How loud is the pump compared to a fan? Maybe one can get the noise even more down by using a Noctua NH-D15...
Can i has?
Sick intro!
Has any ever told you that you look like chris pratt and your new hair cut adds upto that
happy with my FD R6 :)
Furst? No, twenty thurd ;_;
what are the temps like ?
My wallet hears it.
13:13 RIP headphone users who turned up the volume
AMD system will be color match with the case
This video is sponsored by BeQuiet & Enermax.
Paid videos ??
I watched this video on mute... with noise-canceling headphones.
silent for youtubers, very loud for viewers :D
Top 20 comment bruh
custom water loop would make it really silent. you guys should do water cooling you never dable in custom loops
Hey I currently have a 1050 ti and need something a bit more powerful can u help me either OC it or get me a better gpu.
The silent loop series is trash. The AIO will die anytime soon.
Be quiet! Personally i would call it... shhhh... ...ut the f up!!!
Nice build

I only bought a $8.00 battery charger. Fits any where. Just saying.

That "designer" at 4:50 looked high off his fucking rocker
im pretty sure a computer, isnt a computer accessory
I miss the MagSafe and I need the MagSafe for latest MacBook Pro 2018. Please suggest the best converter!!
The Mobicase looks interesting, however, the $200 price tag is a turn off and deal breaker. The tiny tower has a big price of $80 for something you can remedy for free or with cheaper products. Also, enormous focus on Mac products, which is a shame. The Moose bag is promising, however, at $130, its overpriced and I got a chuckle at the way you can "lock" the bag around a pole when all it would take is a pair of scissors to cut the strap and get away with the bag and the contents. The CHUWI Hi10 Plus is useful, but the limiting factor is the storage at only 64Gb which is basically used up by both operating systems leaving a mere 20Gb for real storage. The price of it though is a good deal.
Just sit on a small chair or get a taller table for the first one ._.
The moose is my good
I'm sorry did they just use a portable keyboard on a laptop in that laptop bag ad?
The mobi case looks really good wtf!
tiny tower is awesome
macbook accessories
videp is useless this gadgets is only for mac
En serio 6 interrupciones comerciales? cada 120 segundos un puto comercial? Vayanse a la ve...jiga !!
Only macbook shit
plzz make a video how to connect dvd player with laptop and also explan how to install the os for laptop with the help of dvd player
I like Moose design and zendure
Way too much commercial break. Dislike and click not interest to prevent it pop out from my video list.
what the hell its monetized heavily
I love the durability of Mac products. but the newest products can just go in the trash.. I'll stick to Linux on PC
I'm sure there's tech behind it, but I don't trust magnets near my PCs, no matter how secure they might be lol
I find it sad that dongles are some of the must haves.. T^T That's right... now, we no longer need to just have only a laptop perfectly working for all our needs.. but, we instead have a laptop where we need to buy more parts to take up more space so we can use everything we need...
I loved #5 until I found out it was $130
Can vistar be used for asus
I was soo excited to get the moose bag but noticed a 130 dollar price tag

At the first, how the fuck do you type with the original laptop keyboard? You need to buy a wireless keyboard, cause with wired keyboards, it looks really ugly. Come on

Simply awsome
the working station bag is going to burn out your macbook... there is no air circulation!
I understand that some people need to charge their devices, but what is the point of bringing you tablet and phone with you everywhere. Also, why the hell do the dongles never have Ethernet -_-
Look at those macbook users... Feeling so sad for them apple put them in alot of trouble what to do with that beautiful design of macbook when u have to carry tons of useless cables/adapters ?? ?? ?? Well dell xps15 guy is here

Eight ads to monetize a twelve minute commercial compilation? Why not interrupt your viewers every minute?
Hi
Moose vs Mobicase?
Gooooooood ????
LOW EFFORT FUCK.
The only thing that interests me is the first one. 2&4: I'm not stupid enough to buy a mac 3&5: Nice idea, but for most people, it will quickly become just another bag. Most people don't spend enough time keeping their bags organized, a lot of bags actually have a lot of features that we common users never use. Besides, you should use backpacks with chest strap, because side carries will bend your spine. Mobi case gets a + for the posture thing... but isn't it ironic that it's a side carry when they are talking about posture? Most people don't shift from shoulder to shoulder every 3-5 min like they should... Get a clue, make backpacks. 6: lol, how dah faq is that even a new thing? They are EVERYWHERE. And many are better quality too. And no, tablet can never be all that a REAL laptop can be. Because you can't fit a 1060 or better in it. 7: Excessive. most I've ever used is 2 ports, I doubt most people would need more than 3. Besides, most laptop now come with a charge port that can charge when not on, could just use that. I've a charger with 2 ports, and then 2 attached short cable on the side, one with micro-usb, the other... with whatever the apple shit is. That, IMO, is more than sufficent, and also more convenient as you wont need to break out the cables half the time.
im literally buying that tiny tower right now

After I watched this video, I got the Mobicase. Lemme just tell you ITS AMAZING. Five stars 10/10! I totally recommend it.

Personally, I love my Corsair Strafe.
@gameranx I have chosen keyboards 9 and 8 which one would you prefer?
The under 50 dollar list doesn't even include any mechanical keyboard.. and there are quite a few of them at the price point.. seems like the under 50 list is quite irrelevant (at least for me)....*change my mind*
Why do people focus so much on lights lmao
"UNDER $50" XD
Will the ornata wrist test fit the huntsman
He said its under $50 and some are over $100.
I got the K95 platinum and its not very good (That is my personal opinion) Because I don't like the klickyness Not enough of it and there isn't a nice taktile bump which I love. If you are checking this keyboard out then go to a store and try it out please.
G513 is the best
No ajazz ak33 or motospeed ck61 <3 bang for bucks
Damm I have a Razer Ornata Chroma R.I.P
I just bought a logitech g910
A razer ornata
Well, I was looking for a new keyboard, and I bought one right before I checked out this video to see if it even made the list and since it's sitting at #1, I think I made the right choice.
Great video and breakdown, but this is such garbage. There is no difference between these and regular keyboards save the back-lighting and possibly mechanical keys. What is it exactly that makes these "gaming" keyboards? What a joke of marketing proportions! I'm looking for a decently priced Merc Stealth still, and even though the shithead reviewers of the day crapped all over the extra game pad on the left, it is the best thing I've had for gaming since I bought it years ago. There is a reason a brand new one is selling for $650 bucks and used are going for like $180-$190 because those that have used it KNOW that it is the best thing out there. On top of that it is a TRUE gaming keyboard if only for the extra design which was intended for GAMERS! Let these products die, they aren't gaming keyboards, they are keyboards with flair, they do NOTHING to increase your gaming. Sorry had to vent, oh one last thing, screw Steelseries for canceling the production of the Merc and Merc Stealth, and screw them even more for ignoring the many people requesting they put this great gaming keyboard back into production. Thumbs up for the video sir!
Lol Synapse "if you can get that to work" Big fax right there
I completely disagree! I think the Corsair K70 should be replaced with the K95 Platinum, and that the Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2 should be be high on the list, not not on it at all
My Logitech g810 is super loud and I stream which that gets annoying any TKL keyboards anyone knows of that’s quiet but is mechanical
I Bought Fantech K612 Yesterday...Wroks Fine??
Huntsman is $200
Using the corsair k55 and very happy about it for the low prive of €50.
but... but wheres the redragon kumara k552
Redragon should be ine of the cheapest and the best
WTF? No Logitech G510?
unbox theraphy voice
I have found my own keyboard by your list. Thank you so much!
redragon mitra
I like how the keyboard in the thumbnail is $200
I'm okay with spending a lot of money on a keyboard. The keyboard i use in my gaming setup is a corsair k95 rgb platinum with cherry mx brown switches
what's up with mine :cougar x3 attack ;) The best
I have the k55 it's nice if you like membrane keyboards
Yeah, roccat Vulcan still is objectivity better in my opinion too all of these.
death stalker is literally god tier
Under 50 dollars (thumbnail is of huntsman elite which cost 200 dollars)
Errr... Not having the Redragon Kumara K55x in the best budget options section is a huge oversight; it's hand's down the best value option on the market and has been for a few years.
This list is a joke
am i the only one who thinks that the raze deathstalker looks like shit ?
Should have included roccat vulcan 120 aimo. Its an exceptional keyboard
Nobody ever reviews Bloody. I love their products and the software is pretty ok.
Msi vigor gk80
Sigh, when did gamers = rgb? It's so stupid to look for keyboards now and only seeing rainbow pictures.
Where are the Roccat??? comon
I think my phone is broken, i didnt see a Corsair Strafe in there
Why is the razed huntsman elite on the thumbnail when it’s a £200+ keyboard, and the title is keyboards under £50.
How about red dragon kumara rgb. Almost $25
??Huntsman elite??
HYPER X NUMBER 1
Who else got a tick-tok ad
Under 50 to 120
I really liked the Razer huntsman elite a lot more
I'd rather get the Razer black widow v2 or the new razer blackwidow elite over the huntsman elite because if I'm going to be honest the black widow flagship is still better subjectively (in my opinion)
Ew membranes! You can find a solid $30-60 mechanical keyboard. Maybe even cheaper if you keep an eye out for deals on reddit namely r/buildapcsales and r/MechanicalKeyboards.
i’m using corsair k95
A big NO about wasting crazy amounts of money, nobody is rich, so we go for cheap but good quality stuffs.
Logitech G213
Tbh I wouldn't get those membrane keyboard on Amazon u can get some pretty good mechanical keyboard for 25$ or more
I I Personally have the Razer ornata Chroma and I like the keyboard Because It's just Simple you have the customizable rgbs and a Realy comfortable wrist rest
WHAT YOU MEAN BY UNDER 50 DOLLARS I SAW ONE FOR OVER 100
Where is my Corsair K95 Platinum RGB?
THESE ARE NOT UNDER 50 ;-;
Why do gaming keyboards feel the need to move the F1-F12 keys, it makes using them in gaming almost impossible. For example for Fortnite I have a Razer keyboard and use F4 to build roofs but because F1-F12 isn't directly above the numbers it's really inconsistent
I have the corsair k55 and it's fantastic
Please do cheaper thhiiiings
Click bait ????
i Got a a keyboard its a old crappy HP keyboard its for bussiness i ikke 5 to 10 DOLLARS
What happened to 50$ to 100$ keyboards? ;-)
When you see your k55 keyboard and u smile in approval
"under 50€" lmfao corsaire k70 150€
I was expecting keyboards UNDER the 50 dollar price tag. After reading the title for the 3rd time I still don't get it. ''(UNDER $50 + PREMIUM)''
using an old G105 had it for years, its starting to play up now (too much button bashing lol)....oh and Kids... kids + keyboard = stuffed keyboard. but am looking at upgrading to the G513 or to something similar
For me the number one is still the Steelseries m750!
Cooler master ck550
Were the h e c c is the Corsair k96 rgb platinum
I have the logitech g213 and my mouse is the logitech g203
I saw the logitech G100 Laser (different to the one in the video) for 10$ on amazon by logitech
Weird to watch a video involving the AZIO keyboard I have, which is the L70 verision (I got it for free in a purchase of a computer years ago). I've had it for about 3 years. Things to note, the coating on the key caps wear off QUICKLY. I had several letters unidentifiable after a month - 2 months of use. Over all it's been a pretty solid keyboard. Occasionally my 'O' button stops working but it always resolves itself. The volume knob adjuster just register quick rotations so you have to turn it a bit slow. Additionally it only lights up in blue, not other colors.
I use the Aukey mechanical keyboard at work. I have my own office so it doesn't distract the agents in there cubicles. I recommend it as its a well built keyboard that can be had bettween 50-60 dollars. At home, I use a Razer Ornata keyboard which is awesome if you want hybird type switches. They are also not loud and the RBG speaks for itself (Razer). I bought it for 100 dollars.
a l w a y s g o m e c h a n i c a l but, d o n ' t g e t a n o v e r r a t e d g a m i n g k e y b o a r d
You do know there's actual cheap mechanical keyboards that's the same price with like the K55, G100
Where the hell are the cheap mechanical keyboards? Like the outemu and gateron switch keyboards? What the hell?
There you have it folks, all the companies that spend more money on marketing than the quality of their keyboards.
can anyone recommend a keyboard with cherry mx blues? Thx
Big enter is what keyboard need! Ouh and i can not w8 when they will start making wireless keyboards, it is 2018 already
I have the Razer Blackwidow X Chroma TKL with razer's green switches (which are basically cherry mx blues)
K95 PLAT
did anyone use Ducky?? made in taiwan
Little thiccer
WHERE IS THE REDRAGON KUMARA K552? 26 BUCKS AND MECHANICAL
Has it been years ? cause the prices are high asf
I use a $50 mechanical keyboard now. Love it so far. Its 61keys solid RGB waterproof, with Gateron switches are audibly and tactilely satisfying to press; now I like them more than my cherry browns right now, although I really liked those too. The tactile bump is quite a bit more pronounced than on the Browns and it is quite satisfying. If you have similar budgets, you can search Instago on Amazon, can't get better for the price.
you should do a 100 or less keyboard video, there are a lot of nice ones that are sub 100 but over 50
This list is all wrong. Don't get me wrong, some of them offer an alright value for what you're paying, but you don't have to stick to the "gaming" brand keyboards to get the best bang for your buck experience. Skipping over the GMMK was a travesty, and "for a couple hundred dollars" as you mentioned, you can get the Massdrop CTRL, which is outright the best you can get for $200 shipped without getting into the DIY realm.
im using a steel series apex 150 and steel series rival 110
I use bad exibel for like 20$
I really expect a not „Made in China“ keyboard. I know people don’t care that it made in China but i have high standard on quality control. In fact, chinese made stuff can kill some people because of the fault! Ranging from toy recall to elevator and escalator malfunction.
weird video, showing well priced items... then expensive ones , why not just stick to "under 50" and do a separate premium video.
Using a 45 dollar AULA Mechanical keyboard with blue switches, i adore it, just wish it had a numberpad.
I’m using the Razer BlackWidow Ultimate
we are halfway in on 2018 and you do this dude its a half year left
HyperX Alloy Elite RGB <3
The keycaps font of the last keyboard looks amateurish hmm
I use the steelseries Apex M70 TKL with virtual numpad software that i downloaded that pops up when you press F9
get a motospeedck101, tkl mechanical keyboard for $50
Disappointed that the g413 was not on this list
where's the blackwidow ultimate classic?
I got the K55 and it was a good keyboard BUT the lights stopped working a few days later. I like the keyboard but the lights didn't work well.
What about the k95 platinum
I got the Razer Huntsman Elite
Vortex series vx 10 full Cherry mx switch red,blue,brown Rgb Only IDR 630.000 or US 40-50
What about Corsair K95 RGB Platinum?
Ck104 motospeed?
Sooooo... your saying you can find a $200 keyboard that for less than $50?
It was if he said a keyboard who is 49.99 =)))
I wouldn't use a flat keyboard if you paid me to. I use the 'Microsoft Ergonomic 4000" for all my needs,  and the "Logitech G-700 Gaming Mouse" for all my needs. By the way "WASD" keys are the worst keys in the world for gaming, the best keys are "ASDF." Use F for Forward, A for Reverse, S for Sidestep left, and D for Side Step Right. It might take a couple of days to get use to these keys but once you do you'll never go back.
PUTS IN TITLE BEST KEYBOARD UNDER 50 DOLLAR SEES THUMBNAIL RAZER HUNTSMAN ELITE lollll
K95 Platinum or K70 Mk2?
Bloody 820r best keyboard for 60$
why not Eyooso 8100
i love keyboards
G100 combo is really good for Fortnite lol
Wtf under 50$
Corsair K55 Isn't that good of a keyboard. $50 for a non mechanical keyboard is terrible. Better spent on a budget mech keyboard.
I want a mechanical keyboard with a wrist wrest and back light for gaming at night for under 100-150, any recommendations?
I would suggest Ac Gam 109R keyboard, is cheap mechanical keyboard with nice rgb led feature, and is around 50bucks, cheap and worth it in my opinion!
What about logitech k120
Yeet
Logitech G213 Prodigy here, over a year now, and I love it. IDGAF if people think mechanical is better, I prefer my G213!
Nice, not even all of them are under 50$ as in the title. good job
I was about to get the Corsair on amazon. But then I realized all its functions are useless and got a 20 dollar keyboard instead.
The razer huntsman and razer strafe seriously deserve the top 3 spots with the k70 mk.2 althought the prices are something you can't avoid too much, the build quality and the way it was made is by far better than Logitechs Keyboards
Mm.. Motospeed k70 is cheap and not bad.. I recomend.. Xddd
Where th is g213 prodigy
I'm using the razer black widow tournament edition. Non RGB but a super solid ten keyless board
Romer G switches seem to be quite weak in my experiences
i would not recoment the k55. Its keys scratch easily and its rgb is really dull. You wish you got a solid mechanical keyboard without rgb as rgb is not worth its cost if its boring and dull
Bruh it’s not a gaming keyboard if it’s not mechanical, there’s no point in buying a membrane keyboard claiming to be for gaming when u can just buy a normal membrane keyboard for $20 cheaper, we want to see cheap mechanical keyboards, not membranes
Where is Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2 switches green yellow orange ?
Razer optical keyboard? No mention of Bloody?
Under $50: unless you really like membrane, just order a Tecware Phantom or a Redragon mechanical keyboard.
corsair head set GG
totally recommend the razer blackwidow v2
lol i hated that rosewill. The switches are just membrane and that is just a disappointment
I'm actually using the k55 and I love it
Do you guys actually purchase every single keyboard and test them out, or do you research online? Honest caution from pure curiosity
It feels like you didnt spend any time with those keyboards. Just a video for monetization...
Steelseries are gold now. M800 would’ve been the best keyboard I’ve ever used if it was metal like this one.
I had the K70 and decided to go back to Logitech and got the G910. I like the extra buttons and the software more than Corsair's.
the first place shld be k95
Rakk Kimat XT.2 all the way
Personally I still use a corsair K95 vengeance, this is mainly for the 18 macros it has. I use a shitload of macros in games to do shit for me. Like buy binds for cs:go, much used functions in blender, or even just on the desktop. Overall I think it's a pretty solid keyboard.
Are the wrist rests detachable
Buy the Hyper X Alloy FPS! 80 bucks mechanical 10 Keyless with the choice of Blue, Red, and Brown cherry mx switches. <3
Just buy Tecware Phantom
1:00 what is this 1990 that keyboard looks like crap lol u can get better rgb ones for cheaper
Guys tecware phantom is a really good keyboard usinh it right now
Razer deathsalker is cheap. goes to the link sees 72 bucks. Welll then
I have an AcGam AG-109R , it's mechanical, it has rgb and it costs around 50 dollars on AliExpress, I also recommend Motospeed or Redragon keyboards instead of any keyboard on this list.
You forgot all the Ducky keyboards
why would a rainbow keyboard would sell under $50 Powerfull Keyboards its under $1000 duh
Hi to ask you if you know a keyboard to be middle profiles keys to be with RGB lights and to have USB port? If you know please help my to find one.
U should check the red dragon keyboards dude
Personally, I'm using a Corsair k70 Rapidfire RGB I got it for dirt cheap too since the box was damaged, and my friend who I was with at the time had an employee discount from where we got it from. Instead of paying the usual £165, I only paid £41.25 Aside from that? It's a really nice build. I love this keyboard, it's served me well for the last year
I love the Logitech g910 Orion spark (correct me if i misspelled orion)
I just need a keyboard where the keys are really hard to break.
I use a Logitech G213 which is around £50. It has RGB backlighting with the most customisation I've seen for its price. You can also download game profiles to make the keyboard react to discord, fortnite, overwatch etc. The only downside is that it comes with a wrist rest which you can't detach, and the backlighting can be hard to see if you have your curtains open.
Corsair k65
a custom 60% with lubed and filmed 65gram zealios in a custom cut brass backplate a dz60 pcb in a acrylic 5degree case with a set of enjoypbt black on white keycaps
When your keyboard is smaller then all these shown and is almost more then twice the price of the most expensive one
I'm trying to make a new Razer setup
Razer blackwidow chroma v2
What about the $51-99 range
THE DEATHSTALKER, THE FUCKING DEATHSTALKER. BRO THE ORNATA CHROMA IS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER
Every macro-programmable gaming keyboard I've ever owned has on rare occasions caused my computer to go absolutely schizo, e.g. the keyboard I'm using at the moment, my Corsair K70 RGB, has on at least four occasions caused Windows 10 to lock itself into in Alt+Tab mode so that all open program windows cycle on screen indefinitely at dizzying speed. Unplugging the USB has no effect, nor pressing Esc repeatedly, nor Alt+Shift+Delete, nor Alt+Tab - no amount of keystroke combinations to try and get the damned computer out of this Alt+Tab loop work. The only thing I can do when this happens is a hard reboot, which is really great when I've got an urgent typing job on, which is inevitably when it happens! I've had similar problems with my Razer keyboard.
CLACKITY CLACKITY
I'm currently on a k68 board and I'm loving it. I spend a lot of time working on my computer, and my thought was if i'm gonna spend 100$ on a keyboard I want it to at least withstand a possible accident. Thank you Corsair!
I have the k55 rib keyboard by Corsair
If i spend over a 100.00 on a fricken keyboard it better cook me dinner wipe my chin and go to bed with me....
K552 a great TKL KB If you want a full get the K551 They're built like a tank all metal built double shot injection keycaps outemu blue switches and water resistant
I'm using a Razer Blackwidow Chroma Overwatch Edition and I'm very happy with it. Works like brand new, even after a year.
Where is k95? Where is Blackwidow v2? These are A lot times better than No5 and No4
DUE NUMBER 1 IS 169 DOLARS
There are mechanical keyboard below 50$...Mechanical keyboards are just so much better than their membrane counterpart!
where is the black web Mechanical gaming keyboard 50$ and blue switches and rgb with modes
Do you guys know that there are other brands out there? I would rather have a redragon 30$ Mechanical Keyboard than a Corsair/Razer Membrane keyboard with tacky RBG lights.....
I'm actually in the market for mouse and keyboards
Razor huntsman elite vs Logitech G810?? Which one should I pick?
Where is the Corsair K95 Platinum?
Corsair k95 platinum bro
if you want a wireless gaming keyboard, i highly recommend the Corsair K63 its an amazing keyboard
I recommend the asus Cerberus
I love logitech quality i have a g513 with romer g tactile really responsive for gaming i recommend it :D
Ajazz ak33 was like $45 for me and it’s a mechanical RGB kb..
Let’s be real. Who tf would buy membrane keyboards for 50 bucks??
All the Razer Deathstalker images are photoshopped. It does NOT have an angled wrist rest, the complete keyboard is one single straigth piece. I know, because I'm typing on one right now :P
Im using the Corsair Strafe keyboard with MX Silent keys
What about hp Oman mechanical keyboard
No asus love sad
I have a membrane keyboard extra 20 fps on any game ;)
what about keyboards that are between $50 and $100? ;(
Dont buy the cprsair k55 rgb, its a peice of junk, the key caps can and will get jammed down and you cant pull them up. All in all its a peice of junk
I like the RedDragon kumara k552.
K70 mk2 or k95 rgb platinum (Both MX Browns)? Can't decide :(
suggest me a low budget entry level keyboard
Upgraded my BlackWidow Ultimate to a K95 Platinum and right out of the box 3 lights on the bar at the top were dead, returned it and got a Huntsman Elite
The hyper x alloy elite is 110
Haven’t watched the whole video yet, but I’d like to say a very good keyboard is the Bloody B930. It’s ten keyless and has faster actuations than mechanical keyboards (lightstrike). You can find it on Amazon for $139. It also comes with preset rgb lighting options, and switchable key caps
11 days later and the Razer Deathstalker is already $80.00.
The Corsair k70 is 170 dollars. NOICE!!
Currently using k70 mk2. Well worth it.
I found a rayzer chroma v2 for only $100 refurbished. Works well
red dragon's keyboard is great too
Does anybody know any blue loud mechanical keyboards under 60$?
A4-Tech Bloody Mech Keyboard were earlier for having laser or optical keys.
Im using a Logitech g413 silver
I’m using a coolermaster Masterkeys S with cherry brown switches. I really like this keyboard. Well built, sturdy, TKL so it’s portable, detachable cable, and individually lit RGB keys. Honestly can’t ask for much more. Also it’s around $100 Canadian dollars so it has a really good price too
Wheres the redragon?
Honestly the huntsman is underrated it should be number 1 or 2 it’s seriously the best or one of the best out there right now
Specifically for gamers: Please don't use the stand up feet in the front as it causes a lot of strain within your wrist. The flat form is the best way to use.
My friends were pissed when I bought the Corsair k70 mk2
Logitech 213
YOU arereally funny gameranx, the razer huntsman elite does cost a lot more than just 50$, it costs 199$ you stupid
If rosewill makes the k51 mechanical so many people would buy it
were is the k95 platinum
What is this bs? There are tons of better mechanical keyboards for the same price.
I’ve been using the Azio MGK1-RGB-BLU. Love it! Got got it for a steal ($86) on Amazon. Love this keyboard!
The Hyper X keyboard seems like a ripoff of the corsair k70. Hyper X has always been about that or being gimmicky. People hate on Razr but at least they try to be original. Personally I'm all Corsair, Steelseries and Logitech when it comes to peripherals. Except for audio; that's when I get products from audio experts like Senheiser, audio technica, AKG, even Sony and Bose, etc.
I've got a k63 wireless
I'd honestly recommend the Gigabyte K83, it's 40 bucks and it comes with legit Cherry Mx Switches, no backlightining but for that price you can't complain
What about the $45 steel series apex? It has RGB, low profile caps and an enlarged space bar. You should have checked it out.
whats the background music
Logitech G810 Orion Spectrum or Logitech G Pro?
I am using the razer blackwidow chroma v2 with razer green switch
No redragon kumara k552?
gaming =/= rgb
Corsair worth the money.
I have 2x of the Yama Red Dragon keyboards that i bought and use after i switched to a memmechanical for the first time. I liked the feedback from the key presses. I got one for the house at the same time as the memmechanical and after gaming on it I irdered another and took it to work ... it lives on my desk and everyone is jelly of it when they see it. I am IT and have my own office , not sure how it would fly with pounding away (im heavy handed) in an office filled with others. But for all day work tge feedback and feel are so much better than a $9 dell or hp stock keyboard that is in the box
Tecware Phantom RGB.
A razer keyboard without RGB??? Huh??
You should start promoting the under $50 mechanical keyboards instead of just all membrane/memchanical
Razor Black Widow. Everything you need and lots you don't.
#4...saves on desk space. lol. GET A BIGGER DESK.
I have Razer Cynosa Pro
4:02 is keyboards over $100
every mainstream gaming keyboard brand sucks... ducky is one of the best
my number one razer blackwidow chroma v2 with razer yellow switch
No mechanical keyboard under 50 bucks. At least throw in some cherry knock offs like redragon
Huntsman elite is the best keyboard Razer all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is the corsair k55 mechanical?
Awesome Review on Keyboard. Did you see the latest TOP 5 Best Gaming Mouse Collection of Google:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1sXdvdO-Ms , And i was surprised to find ASUS there. Keep up the awesome work.
Velocifire vm01 works great with something to stand it up in the back (I use a piece of aluminum U-channel and aquatic door insulation held on with command strips) and a grafiti fat wrist rest.
The razed huntsman elite is like 200
I bought the k95 rgb platinum for 130 on Amazon prime day. Probably one of the best deals I’ve gotten
No red dragon mechanicals or magicforce 68??
"It works through razer synapse if you can get that to work." Had me cracking up man could not get that workin when I bought some Razer wireless headphones, so I switched to Astro's and haven't had a problem since.
I got a james donkey 619 off of aliexpress for 40$. First mechanical and its extremely pleasant to type on. Got it with red gaterons. If anyones looking for a cheap good options look into it.
I'd recommend the NUBWO NK70. a fully customizable RGB mechanical keyboard with replaceable keycaps and switches and macro support all for 45$ (depends on where you bought it) comes with either Outemu reds or blues and spare switches i swear this is not sponsored
Just got the Corsair Strafe RGB with Cherry MX Silent keys. Best and most expensive keyboard i have ever owned. Upgraded from the K55 btw.
Thumbnail is a 280$ keyboard
Im using huntsman elite. I wanted that coz of the dial. I will be using it on AutoCAD
Cherry mx is trash
Man you’re the best ????????
what about redragon k552.. its really good keyboard. i have it for 2 years and its fucking amazing
lol
gigaware k26?
that memory foam doesn't have a lot of memory
Best gamepad & headphones under 50$
ALL IS ASKED FOR IS WHITE KEYBOARD!!!!! IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?!
1. Ducky 1. Varmilo 1. Filco 1. Leopold
Do mice next.
I have a Logitech g910 ,keycaps peeling off and pressing key sometime double letters and not writing at all
We still need nintendo gaming keyboard
Tecware Phantom RGB is pretty decent too for its price
Do you have one for mice?
is there coming a video on monitors soon?
There's no point doing a top ten if u dont even have the keybaords at hand, otherwise ur just reading off the manufactuer's website.
FOR GAMING, HYPERX ALL THE WAY
steel series apex 100 nice responsive keyboard has been slammed on the floor many times and held up well only like a 30 dollar keyboard very happy with the purchase
aircraft grade aluminum so you can throw it from outer space
No redragon?
"under $50"
Where is ASUS Clymore?
i'm rocking a full corsair RGB setup, with the corsair K70 RGB MKII, m65 pro RGB mouse, MM800 RGB mouse pad, VOID pro wireless RGB headset, and a Carbide SPEC-OMEGA RGB case... ;)
Sucks G710s are gone from Logitech's official website.
do under 10 bucks im broke lmao
I'm curious how CoolerMaster's Masterkey series of keyboards didn't make this list.
im using ROG Claymore, got G910, BW TE V2, BW Ultimate, and definitly i can say im really surprised with Claymore. yea its too expensive but it worth for me
No Glorious PC Gaming Race keyboard? Costs half the price of most of these and you can get switches other than Cherry, that's a real winner!
No K95 Platinum? Literally the king of all keyboards
What about the razer chroma v2?
All I want is my computer to be backlit with gaming mode option/button (so that pesky windows key doesn't mess up my gaming). Other then that I don't really care. I like my keyboard to be simple/plain (as plain as it can be with also being backlit). Just like my mouse..Idc about a bunch of programmable buttons. All I want is the left/right click and a scroll wheel in the center (top-towards the front of the mouse)...thats it.
Who else just said “screw it” and bought all of them
Got the G613 my self since its wireless :) dont RGB and such
Ergodox derived designs (Ergodox EZ, Infinity Ergodox, Redox, Iris, etc), Vortex Gear keyboards (RAC3, P0K3R, ViBE, etc), Leopold keyboards, iKBD (especially the MF series), Ducky keyboards, and so many others that you guys did not mention ARE A LOT BETTER than these "toys".
I had a Corsair K70 MK1, not the newer MKII you have in the video. It’s almost like I’m not sure if the following was something that was not a problem in the beginning, but started happening after the passage of time... but I ended up hating that keyboard because there were a number of keys that would take my keystroke as a double keystroke. In other words, the letter would come out twice even though I only typed it once. At the end it was happening so much, I was starting to loose my cool. Just try typing in passwords with that issue/problem, and not get ticked off, I dare ya. Lol I went out and got a Razer Huntsman Elite, and now I’m lovin’ life! The feel of typing is excellent and the sound is perfect, for me. With my old Corsair K70 there would be times that I would wonder... is it me, is there something that I’m doing wrong? Well, with the new Razer Huntsman Elite, no more unwanted double keystrokes! It wasn’t me, I was not doing anything wrong. I am so glad to be rid of that old K70 MK1 double keystroke piece of junk.
The azio levatrons keys are pretty shit. Very stiff and not fun while gaming
The Razor Black Widow TE Chroma V2 w/ Green Switches is 2nd to none IMO. At $140.00 it's not exactly cheap but it's less expensive than some presented in this Video. Also, for "bargain" keyboards why not Red Dragon? Talk about bang for the buck yet they somehow don't make the list...
Pls do one with headsets
The most important feature in a gaming keyboard is that it glows. Mine makes me feel like I'm driving a spaceship lol
10less mechanical or gtfo
Razer ornata
I really want a Razer Huntsman but I don't know whether to get the Elite or the normal one, I only care about the wrist rest and for an extra $70aud I don't think it's worth it, I might be able to live without it
I like the higher end keyboards but it doesn't make sense to buy them until they are on sale most of them are just overpriced and go on sale very often.
Will we get a vid for headsets
Corsair K63 Wireless, combined with Corsair Dark Core wireless mouse. FTW. I have the Keyboard modded for wireless QI charging and have integrated a QI charger in my desk underneath the full size mouse mat. 100% wireless desktop!
Can you guys do one on mouses? I do have one for a while now but still.
I really hate tiny keys
I don’t even play play on pc what am I doing here?
just buy a mechanical keyboard from aliexpress under 50 usd
razer black widow ultimate stealth 2016 edition
G213
Bought saitek cyborg v5 in 2011 and to this day it hasn't broken down a bit. It has red backlighting as well
I use a razor Ortega chroma
A few days before watching this i bought the blackwidow v2
Ha! Already had number one! XD yay!
what about the k95 rgb platinum man its the best from the corsair line up
I have that Azio keyboard.... It's a pretty decent keyboard that is indeed quite cheap.... I do recommend it for cheaper builds....
I know a brand that isn't anywhere near as expensive called Redragon. They make all kinds of keyboard/PC Accessories. I LOVE this brand! I have an Okay headset (its pretty cheap but it gets the job done for on the go gaming) by them. I also have three mice (one for Xbox one. for my pc. and one just for on the go use that is wireless) and i love them all. I also have a 2 keyboards by them. One is a flatter one with color change in LEDs and the other is the mechanical type without the Num. pad It is LED lit but its only colored in red. Go check them out. they aren't very expensive and their product is well made!
This is a super good mouse and keyboard combo. It's called HAVIT Rainbow Backlit Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo and it's for less than $30 USD. Good reaction time keyboard feel. It's RGB and mechanical. The mouse also has led lights in it and changes colour every couple of seconds or so, also and two side buttons. It is a extremely good keyboard and mouse combo that I do recommend buying.
K95 Platinum master race!! Got it for 120 usd 1 year ago. Got lucky, but it usually goes for 149.99-169.99 i hardly ever see it go for 200 anymore.
A4 tech bloody already did the laser keys years ago. They call them lightstrike
wish there was a uk version of this
The deathstalker is hands down the worst keyboard I've used imo, I prefer using a cheap Logitech k120... Nothing against razer, currently using a blackwidow 2013 and it has never failed me.
It's my Friday, can I have my slice of Pizza early?
You should probably mention which one is mechanical and which one isn't considering that is a pretty big factor when deciding on gaming keyboards.
If you want a chunky boy look at the Turtle Beach Impact 100. £13 And it's the sturdiest and heaviest keyboard I've ever owned. It's made to last, pretty responsive, and great quality. It does not disappoint.
On the Corsair K50 and have been for pretty much 2 years. Good keyboard especially for the price.
Hey I recently bought this mechanical keyboard, mouse, headset, and mousepad combo for 50 usd from redragon and it’s awesome, I thought I would add it to the comments because it wasn’t added in the vid. Also the keyboard itself is only $30 and it has blue switches but I think they’re clones although they do feel really nice and they’re very clicky
Anybody want a keyboard
All these are samples are straight rectangles. I've been waiting for a wave styled ergo lit up keyboard, like the one Microsoft makes, love it but it's only missing the lights.
I still rock Logitech G15, yeah one I got a decade ago. And it still fully works. Though I am kind of thinking to retire it due to age, even though I can't complain. Though I definitely am not spending over 100EUR on it and I am looking into mechanical keyboard, but for like 50-100EUR category. Just not loud one. Because I really don't want to wake up all neighbors at 3am, if for some reason key hitting starts to intensify. :-D And I like them to not be loud either.
Where's Redragon?
i just got the corsair k70 mk2 in blues for college probably the most comfortable keyboard i have owned i 100% reccomend it
Thanks for the tip on the Corsair K55! Wanted an affordable upgrade for my stock lenova keyboard. Any tips on a mousepad, or is that even a thing to look around for?
It's also good to note that if you want longevity out of your keys go for double shot or dual injected key caps. That way years down the line you won't wear down the paint and have a huge transparent blob on your keys.
I really wish every tech channel would cover something besides corsair and the other overhyped boards. They are nice, but I really want to see some mainstream attention on the real enthusiast boards. Like the TADA68, KBD75, TINA, etc. Please, look at some sites like kbdfans or reddit /r/mechanicalkeyboards.
I have a strafe rgb and it’s amazing, the rgb is really really good and the mechanical keys are perfect for a gaming board.
I use a redragon vara rgb and i got it at half price for 55 bucks and it normally (at least in my country) used to be 100 dollars(and a bit) and it’s a really great mechanical keyboard and i haven’t had any problems with it.
I use the Logitech G810.
Asus ROG Claymore, 1 of the best mechanical keyboards I have ever used, A joy to use.
The M750 looks sooooooo good. Just wish my wallet looked just as good....
everybody’s dropping pc tips at the perfect time when i’m building a pc
Can you please do best headsets <3
Using a redragon yama keyboard
What about ajazz ak33. It's 40$, mechanical, rgb, tenkeyless. Also has macro software
That over a hundred dollars keyboards are not really worth it. All they advertise is the fact that keyboard with RGB is "premium". I tried most of the keyboards in the over a hundred lineup and they feel "cheap" in quality. They dont even put PBT keycaps just to show the RGB goodness of their keyboards. I would much prefer to use ikbc mf87 than those. You'll get the best in terms of price and quality.
Redragon Indrah RGB here. Not bad for under under $50, considering it's my first mechanical keyboard since the '80s...
Why no 60% fully programmable keyboards like the vortex pok3r? Apparently gamers need to do some very important accounting with numpad and sacrifice mouse space on the desk.. I don't use my poker for gaming though because I got the cherry mx blue switches on it. I have a Razer orbweaver for gaming, it allows my thumb to do way more than space bar, save even more desk space for the mouse, and super comfortable in the hand. This video is just bs. Stick to those before you buy this game videos, and some gaming news. Don't recommend people what to buy if you know nothing about premium keyboards, and apparently not even budget keyboards didn't even recommend red dragon
I own the K55, couple things I don't really like are the wrist rest; it's not the most comfortable rest and the top part of the keyboard attracts dust like nothing else. Other than that, it's a great keyboard
bruh. have you even checked out /r/MechanicalKeyboards?
I am using G105 atm. It's simple and good.
Can you do a video on good mice under $50?
srsly u make the video 10 hours after i buy mine .. and its not even in the list :(
i need a keyboard to my laptop because the disk is placed where my hand is while im playing, thanks guys for this list
F*ck me, i wanted to buy a mechanical keyboard for 50€ to 100€, Im used to this kinda of luck i guess...
I'm sorry but I don't think you got the Rosewell keyboard because i have one and its not good at all you got key wobble the software sucks for it and the key replacements are shit too they ones that came with mine i had to take a file to so it would even fit. The one I found that's cheap and works great is the 60% Razer RGB 2016 tournament edition you can find it one sell for 50 to 80 bucks. The software is great you can change any key into a macro key.
Love my BlackWidow Chroma V2 with orange switches. One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. No issues so far.
How about MOTOSPEED CK104 RGB mechanical keyboard under 50$
Great video. Does any manufacturer make specific keyboards and mice (and game controllers) for us all too often forgotten left-handers?
A video bout gaming monitors would be interesting imo
logitech k120 FTW! :D
None of the under-50’s were mechanical
Logitech g810
These are some good keyboards
If you want a budget mechanical keyboard that has Cherry Mx Reds, get the Gigabyte Force K83 for 40$
Why the K70 and not the K95?
Rocking the Corsair Strafe/silent switches for the last few years.....time for something new.
this is why I play on console
What about GPro
Corsair logo reminds me of the pirate bay logo
i use 10$ keyboard, but i wating till Bloody will be avaliable on EU market (that keyboard with numerpad on the left side of keyboard! )
I have the HyperX alloy Elite and its a god keyboard. I have cherry MX red and the thick key caps feel amazing. Definitely would recommend it.
The video was good, I would like each keyboard to be mentioned if mechanical or not, I'm looking to upgrade from my old Logitech G15 (maybe do a mechanical non RGB for under £100 vrs mechanical RGB under £100)
I recently got the corsair k70 original after my keyboard that came with my computer started to wear out and buttons stopped working. Honestly a great keyboard which I got for less then $100 because of the M2 coming out. Loving it because it feels to complete my setup
Corsair k70 mk2 SILVER AND WHITE ofc, so smooth and crispyyyyy
The best keyboard under $50 has to be the Redragon K552 RGB, it has blue switches though they aren't Cherry, good RGB lighting, and great performance!
#10 Logitech G100s combo $56.26 #9 Rosewill RGB $34.99 #8 Corsair K55 RGB $48.25 #7 Razer Deathstalker Essential $26.58 #6 Azio Levetron L70 (Couldn´t find it at Amazon, so it took the price from Walmart) $25.50 #5 HyperX Alloy Elite $109.99 #4 SteelSeries Apex M750 TKL $119.99 #3 Razer Huntsman Elite $199.99 (At Razer Shop) #2 Logitech G513 $ 149.99 (At Logitech Store) #1 Corsair K70 Mk.2 $139.99
Membrane is an auto no for me when it comes to keyboards.
Went from Razer Greens to Topre in a Leopold FC980. Loving it.
picked up a corsair strafe RGB silent mech for £20 of a guy that spilt coke all over it, a treatment of isoprophyl later and its good as new... total bargain.
TVS gold 30$ comes with cherry MX blue i must tell it's a good keyboard
hyper x huntsman and k95 platinum are still the best, id say best is huntsman elite and the k95 still holds up second and beats k70 mk 2 than hyper x is the third best surprisingly.
NATEC Genesis THOR 300 TKL under 50$$ and very nice
I hate rgb
Razer huntsman elite should be 1st
keyboard really was the least noticeable upgrade for me. Even the mousepad was a bigger one lol
I upgraded to a Razer Ornata from a Razer Deathstalker just last week. I recommend both! Further explanation down below. The Deathstalker lasted me two years, and even when I bought it, it was used by one of my friends! The only reason I ended up having to retire it last week was because, after so much use and travel, the membrane on the W key got a minor crack in it that resulted in a sticky W key, and two or three keys had trouble functioning. But, once again, that was after two years of my own use, and a few more from a friend of mine. I would highly recommend it! Great, sturdy, reliable, cheap keyboard! As for the Razer Ornata, it's fucking phenomenal. It has an EXTREMELY comfortable cushioned wrist rest that is attached via a magnet, provides mechanical-style feedback to your fingers while still keeping the noise levels down, has a low key profile that's easy to adapt to if you're coming from a completely flat keyboard like the Deathstalker, and perhaps best of all, it has RGB! (which can be set to a solid color, dimmed, or completely turned off if you aren't into that!) Fantastic keyboard, especially considering the price of just under a hundred bucks. My RGB setup for the Ornata is a standard "Fire" effect that makes the keys look like rocks floating in a pool of lava. However, I also added a custom Reactivity effect on top of that, which makes my keys glow white when I press on them. It looks like you're pressing those little rocks further into the pool of lava and making them turn white hot. Extremely cool aesthetic. Razer never ceases to amaze with their RGB.
Still in love with Razer Blackwidow X Chroma
really, no G613?
red dragon kamara great choice with diffrent rgb or red variants for only around 30 dollars
a keyboard is not that important I think there is not a big difference between keyboards , a good mouse is far more important
pretty good list I'm happy! Out of my keyboards I look for a couple things. I'm currently using the Logitech G910 which I get a lot of people were not a fan of. I love it to death and hearing some of the things that Logitech said about this board coming up to its release felt like they made it just for me. for example they tried a kinda different thing with their key caps and the response was mostly "oh that's cool but you went to far cool guys". so they changed up the keys a bit to fit that response before release. for me personally I found that I love the key caps but almost wish they went further so it feels like their original plan was to make it for me (most high end logitech gaming products feel like they were made specifically for my preferences from keyboards to mice and headphones). Anyway I love this keyboard and I really like logitech's own mechanical switches however I wish they had a clicky version of their switch but since they don't I do prefer Cherry MX blues for when I do a lot of typing.
I absolutely LOVE how none of the cheaper mechanical keyboards aren't on this list. It truly shows that those AREN'T good gaming keyboards and they aren't ACTUALLY better than these keyboards... Come on gameranx, do your research and recommend MECHANICAL keyboards for this price point. There are a lot out there so there's no reason to recommend shitty membrane keyboards at 50$
Gaming mouse video today????
Overpriced, not worth buying crap...
A week late for me gameranx
GAMDIAS P1 HERMES is godlike if ur poor like me :D
Why does every pc needs ugly and flashy colors everywere ?
I am using the Asus cerberus keyboard
"thats programmable with razer synapse if you get that to work" - very relatable
If only you did links for UK subs!
All of these “budget” keyboards are because they are cheap, but because they are too expensive for what they are (except for maybe the Logitech mouse and keyboard combo), and all those over $100 keyboards are WAY over $100. There’s LOTS of keyboards that are a WAY better value than the ones you chose.
Love my black widow chroma v2, it comes with a awesome memory foam, magnetic wrist wrest
Nice video, but what about the Corsair K95 platinum?
The HyperX Alloy Elite is an extremely good keyboard. I bought it for around $55 and I have been having it for 2 years. So good!
I see several comments talking about several keyboards that they thought deserved to be on this list but the video was not meant to find the cheapest quality keyboards but highlighting a price range of around $50 to +$100
My main keyboard now is Sades Lucent, it's priced around $40, TKL, and have Kailh Blue switches, it's pretty good. If you need the full layout, go for Sades Excalibur
Make a video for headsets
Couldn't live without my Corsair K70 RGB Rapidfire. Cherry MX speed caps are the ducks nuts.
Dope keyboards but check out the roccat brand
Who y’all steal content from this time? ??
can you do mouse too?
Ffs just tell me what switches the boards have.
reddragon kumara is the best mecha gaming keyboard under $50. go with mecha if you're a gamer even if you're on a budget
Where is MS Thunder pro????
I like a chunky keyboard.
I have a Ducky One which replaced a Ducky Shine 2. Although the keyswitches (cherryMX red) were fine, the LEDs started dying and I need backlighting.
I have a Yamaha P45.
I am planning on buying a gaming keyboard sometime soon because I am kinda getting into some gaming with my PC, and I have to use a controller because my Logitech MK270 does not work well for gaming. Oh well! I like that keyboard though. I am planning on getting a Razor keyboard with RGB.
I got a Corsair K70 lux as I don't care much for rgb.
Right on time, was looking for some gaming mouse and keyboard. Ty so much.
I'm using the HyperX Alloy Elite FPS (Cherry MX Red). I really recommend this keyboard, it is well built and all around amazing quality, i got it for around 80$, so it's also not expensive.
no thanks im good nothing can beat my logitech K120 :)
Man i still love my Steelseries Apex 100, i think i'll pass
get ck101 for 40quid its small,rgb and blue or red switches
Does someone have a recomendation for a quiet gaming keyboard? UwU
Bought the Razer Ornata Chroma two days ago after my Logitech G413 broke. I love it so far, the mecha-membrane switches feel better than the Romer-G switches on logitech mechanical keyboards in my opinion, the chroma effects are pretty dope and it comes with a nice wrist rest
I like my Roccat Ryos MK, best kb I ever used.
And no mention of Red Dragon Mechanical (amazon) keyboard!?
I am using Logitech G710 that I got in a bundle with Logitech mouse, mouse mat and cup for £100!
Could you make a Top10 mechanical or stealth keyboards under 50$? I kinda want to change mine.
did they actually test these boards
Kumara redragon for like 35 bucks. Best board for ur bucj
I’m a razer boy and the new one looks cool (I’m using a BW chroma v2 rn)
What is the background music in the end? (Deus Ex?)
I still using my old white 18 years keyboard that I bought in year 2000. Seriously, W,A,S,D are still there and I'm still killing boses and pvp with it today. PS2 keyboard not USB.
TIP FOR KEYBOARD USERS never put your keyboard high with the little stands it is not good for your wrist use your keyboard flat that is better for your hands
this is great hey i need to know a good mouse for games that have a lot of key bindings
i still use my logitec G15 :)works like a charm
I fell in love with the Logitec keyboard
where is the razer ornata on the list
arrow keys arn't gaming keys
Why is it only logitech can make an rgb keyboard without light bleed?
blackwidow v2 FTW
Top 10.....all of that membrane though....why??? *Shivers*
the thing is if you go just a little bit over 50€ / $ you get noname Mechanical Keyboards with Cherry MX Switches at 70€ they even have a numbpad. Yes they a Noname but they have the same switches so it barley makes a Diffrence.
G413 for typing and K70 for gaming, so far so good
1:50 I use the Corsair K55 and after all my slams I can safety say its pretty durable all I've lost is some keys that are irrelevant and the LEDS But yeah its a strong motherfucker
Just want to point out one thing with regards to two different manufacturers. Corsair requires you to ship any fault back to their factory (or vendor if you're lucky enough to have somewhere close that will accept corsair RMA's) This could run you far more than the cost of the part you are replacing. Logitech's customer support is atrocious. I am currently at 2 weeks after my RMA was approved on a logitech G903. It took an entire month to get to that stage, There is no end in sight for this, as even their customer support is admitting that their RMA process is broken at the moment (I'm Australian, so again, like corsair, your mileage may vary) Logitech build quality? well you get what you pay for, at the low end. At the high end however, the build quality does not seem to approve above the $30 offerings, they still feel cheap, made of poor plastic components that feel like they'll break if they get hit with harsh language.
I'm using Razer Black Widow X Chroma, and I really like it
I have a corsair k65 lux rgb with cherry mx red switches.
I thought this was a bullet Barry video
Can I expect a similar list for mouses? (Mice?)
@Rakk Keyboards
Idk why but i havent seen anyone talk bout this keyboard, its by rottay, a lowkey brand but their keyboard RGB Mechanical Keyboard, Rottay RGB... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753ZMXXW?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf is prob my favorite, and the best thing it comes under 50$ i have used 100$+ keyboards (blue switches) but this one feels better, like i dont get how this isnt more money, build quality is great, all its keys are programmable, and has so many different rgb modes, i have no idea why u wouldnt get this unless you dont like cherry mx blues
Azio is only for amazon prime users
I use logitech G103, i personally recommend it as it is cheap and has quick access keys on the left too.
above all can you pour a cup of water on keyboard or submerge it into water and still working fine? if not then its useless. i know a keyboard that can and its dirt cheap
razer product breaks within months...
I have and highly reccomend the logitech g6710+ blue mechanical gaming keyboard
I won a K95 Corsair platinum in a giveaway somehow. : )
Literally don't buy a gaming keyboard that isn't mechanical. Seriously, (Unless you're a bit adventorous).
Razer a name brand ? :D I had 2 products that failed me, my friends also had 2-3 failed products from Razer. So Razer will never see my money again.
Next time could you please mention which key switches they have?
I love my razer blackwidow X Chroma. Bought it around last Xmas.
What's Doorable? Don't you mean Durable?
Come on where 95k corsair ???
RIP keyboards from 50.01$ to 99.99$.
Do these work on ps4 pro or no (the one that come with mouse)
can any 1 recommend some gaming mice
Next time u make these videos please translate the currency because NOT EVERYONE LIVES IN AMERICA
You should check out the Glorious PC Race GYMMK (Gimmick) Keyboards. Solderless Switch replacement compatible with all Cherry MX compatible 3 pin switches like Cherry, Gateron, etc. .
Got a red dragon indrah white. Chunky boys make a noise?? My bro sold it to me for $11,30
I have a $10 logitech keyboard called the k120 that i’ve been using for 2 years. Works perfectly fine but maybe if i got a nicer keyboard i’d notice how bad it is.
The sixth one is also over 100$
Is it really worth paying $200 for a keyboard?
I have a Genius scorpion k5 for 15 bucks used
I have the #1 on the list.
The alienware keyboard is cool too
no topre.... psh
Gameranx is awesome
I just got a second hand razer black widow chroma, and i absolutely love it
Just wondering, I have a turtle beach 50X headset. Does that have a decent mic for streaming.
you try any of the patriot viper series? I've had 2 of their mechanical keyboards and loved them
Lol this sucks, I bought a Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2 in June, and by the time it arrived the Huntsman was released :/
WHERES REDRAGON MECH KEYBAORDS U SPONSORED SHITS!
Im surprised i didnt see drevo
Disappointed there wasn't an Anne Pro or any Pok3r MKBs. I switched from a corsair to a Pok3r and it's been the best decision of my life.
Deathstalker is getting shit, at least mine. Buttons start to feel like i need to push them hard like rocks, sometimes you need to push them to the very end for them to register (Shift key mostly) and stuff like bread particles easily get catched everywhere
How did you forget the Corsair RGB strafe?
wireless mechanical all the way for me
I have a Logitech G610 with CherryMX Red switches. If you don't need RGB and you're okay with the offset light on each key it's a pretty okay Keyboard. http://a.co/2Sg9z07
That red spot on the intro hand might need to get that checked!
k55 is great ?? love the macro keys.
Cougar is never on this list, they are diamonds in the rough, except the Cougar 700k, that one is just disappointing. I was expected to see the Cougar Ultimus, but this being Gameranx you'll never see any keyboards that are not the typical brands
Just got My PC and Im using a Razer RGB keyboard! :)
I stand by my redragon k555 indrah. It has multimedia keys, 5 recordable g keys, full rgb lighting, a metal frame, and most importantly blue mechanical switches. Redragon may not be the flashiest brand, but not a single one of your budget boards had all of those features for around $50.
I got a Cooler Master Gaming Devastator 3 keyboard and mouse combo
I feel sorry for anyone who uses a membrane keyboard to game. I bought my mechanical keyboard at 44.99 on amazon, have had for over a year and it's still amazing.
Vortex for life
Trust GXT 280 , multimedia keys , programmable keys , illuminated (3 colors) years old now still works perfectly , aaand its only 35 dollars.
What about the roccat vulcan?
Any Wireless/wired combo gaming keyboard recommendation ?
Where is logi g413 thats a great kb under 100 usd
The Razer Huntsman absolutely missed the point of having optical switches, if it was $100 cheaper it would have made sense. For a keyboard that costs $200 with laser tech they could have implemented an analog button function just like the Wooting One. Not to mention that it has to use 2 USB ports in order to get the full potential. What a waste.
I have a razor deathstalker But it’s backlit green
Logitech G Pro tkl
Logitech g810 is the best keyboard for me ??
I'm currently using the Logitech G213 but I'm thinking about switching to the Logitech G Pro because I want a TKL keyboard. Any other TKL's y'all (anyone) would recommend?
I’m using a $40 blackweb rgb keyboard

If i can pick up the k95 rgb platinum for just 10 bucks more than the k70 mk2 should i doit?
K70 Lux RGB ??
logitech has started to get really shit. i got a proteus g502 gaming mouse. it's worse than an imitation for 25 bucks. it's a startup called klim and all their products have been absolutely amazing for the price.
Brand names doesnt make it a good keyboard...
Im using a Viper V760 I just picked up with Kailh Brown switches and I love it. Only $69.99.
I have personally used the Razer Deathstalker since it has come out. I don't have to worry much about stuff getting inside of my keyboard, and it's a pretty solid build. There has been many accidents involving beverages through this thing and it still survives. I've used this keyboard so much that my "wasd" area is starting to fade. It's definitely a nice transitional keyboard if you are going from a laptop to a desktop as well.
i recommend checking out gamdias hermes ultimate keyboard and hermes essential keyboard both keyboards have mechanical switches and are really good for left handed gamers and have 3 extra macro buttons below the spacebar and also 3 extra macro buttons below right control key for the left handed gamers using arrow keys these buttons are easy access for the thumb for right handed and left handed gamers the pricing of both keyboards is $100 and $110 but i got my hermes essential keyboard for $60 during a sale on gamdias website anyhow anyone in the market looking for a gaming keyboard i believe these 2 are at least worth a look especially for the left handed gamer ??
Could you guys do a video for best keyboard and mouse combo for ps4?! I haven't played PC since my younger years, but I always loved the combo for any kind of shooting game.
But, what about the software? Honestly, I have never used the 18 extra G-keys on my old Corsair K95 keyboard because Corsair's software is just absolute garbage. I tried the K55 recently as just a cheap board for the little guy to play with, and the software game remains equally as pathetic. Roccat's Swarm software for their mice and keyboards is also pretty damn horrid. When you purchase a $100+ USD keyboard or mouse, you might expect that the software would actually work, right? I don't know how many times I've re-downloaded that stupid .exe file and re-installed that software. You mention Razer's Synapse briefly in the video. Honestly, I haven't had any major issues with it in roughly 5 years of gaming with my Razer Orbweaver. It seems to do pretty well for the most part, although there are some things I would change or add. It could also be that I'm not running the most recent version with their modern hardware. Not sure what the issue is there. I've also never had any major issues with Logitech's software. Admittedly, I haven't owned a Logitech keyboard in over a decade, so I can't speak to those devices. But I have owned MANY of their mice over the years and have always appreciated that Logitech's software is not only intuitive but actually works! Now, if only they made a mouse that fit all my needs. Logitech just needs to buy out Roccat and steal their Nyth design, throw in an awesome optical sensor instead of that garbage laser one, make it wireless without it being a brick, and slap that software on top of it. They also need to bring back a more ergonomic (adjustable to hand size) and modernized G13 with mechanical switches. Build a Logitech Nyth MMO gaming mouse and a modern G13 gaming keypad, and I will throw my wallet at you. Side note: Yes, I have tried the G600 MMO mouse, and although I loved the idea of the 3rd mouse click as a "G-shift" modifier key, the mouse itself was just so uncomfortable to use for me. I have medium to small hands, and although the G600 is not a large mouse (it's actually quite small), it is wide and heavy enough to cause problems. Lifting the mouse requires pinching with your weakest finger in combination with a thumb that has no place to rest. This constantly resulted with many annoying accidental presses on the side buttons. It was enough of a struggle that it interrupted my workflow, so I had to find an alternative. I'm currently using the Roccat Nyth, which works okay, I guess, at least when the Swarm software actually works.
Please do mice next!
I have the Mk1 K70 that I bought a couple years ago and I will never go back to anything else, this is the best damn keyboard I've ever used. And it's so easily to clean which is a huge plus for heavy gaming. Once it finally kicks the bucket in several years I'll be getting whatever the newest model K70 is cause it's just amazing.
Razor huntsman elite is the best
K63 wireless keyboard paired with the lap board and darkcore mouse for some couch gaming
Cooler master devestator
I am using a Tesoro Durandal, it has Cherry Mx reds. it's the basic version without leds or wrist rest.
I use the logatrc g910
I want the cooler master ck620
the g910 is good
I run a Corsair K55 at work and I love it. Honestly thinking about moving to the K70 for personal use.
I have tje k70 rapidfire
Was just looking for a new one. This vid is right on time
Can someone buy me a headset my old one broke the day after I booted up my pc for the first time
Logitech G513 owners anyone?
RGB ROG Horus
Personally I only use Logitech so I use a Logitech G-Pro keyboard which is TKL and it's a sturdy board that had last me a while
Getting the redragon yama next week, extremely good value, check it out
Not exactly new, but I love my K95 RGB Platinum.
There are so much better MECHANICAL keyboards for under 50 than the crap being peddled here
A nice option if you are looking for a nice cheap keyboard is the ACGAM AG-109R, nice construction with metal, mechanical, full RGB, just 50$
why did you guys have to post this video the day i get my first keyboard in the mail..... lol the k68 i got is still awesome so far
the k55 is great. although it's not mechanical, it gets the job done and if you dont have money for a streak deck, the macro keys are a god sent
I'm currently using a Redragon K556 mechanical keyboard. I got it for ~$60. Not the fanciest mechanical keyboard out there, but pretty good for the price being an actual mechanical keyboard and having per-key RGB lighting under $100
Do NOT buy the deathstalker! It's such a crappy keyboard. I had one and my spacebar started sticking down and ended up not working at the end. Not good. Logitech G710+ is what I use now, lasting more than 2 years and still going strong.
I have the Azio levetron L70 it’s pretty good the only problem is that I don’t use the volume wheel that’s all
I can vouch for the K55. I’ve been using it over a year and it is an awesome keyboard. I picked mine up for $30 from Microcenter and I absolutely love it!
Pretty convenient video considering im getting a gaming PC in a month
Prff. Don't listen to these idiots you can find good off brand Chinese mechanical keyboards for like $30.
No red dragon mechanical keyboards those are great
3rd world sucks!
this is exactly what I needed. Thank you

Is eagletec mechanical keyboard solid?
I used Razer BlackWidow Chroma then after it broke I downgraded my keyboard to AVF brand Silentdeath Gaming Freak GK3. I play a lot using my keyboard and i'm also a part time writer. So far never regret the downgrade.
That Azio keyboard actually looks pretty damn sharp.
Gamranx should do one for monitors and include the prices in the video
Minecraft-cito
I was wondering, do any of these RGB ones have programmable lighting to light up ONLY the keys that are assigned to a command/effect? I play so many different keyboard configurations in different games that I need a board that lets me peripherally see what is active and what is not. Especially when switching from one game type to another. My biggest preference is Logitech (never had a breakdown from them since 1995-ish).
Why do people prefer the number pad on gaming keyboards?
I just can't stand the basic rectangle shape. I like mine with a little bit of a curve. Just feels better and places the keys in more more comfortable position due to my extremely long fingers.
For the price, and performance, I'm very happy with my k55.
I got a Corsair Strafe red for 40 dollars refurbished from amazon. Note that it is not RGB, but for the price, it is an amazing mechanical keyboard. I suggest checking it out if you don't care about RGB or not breaking the bank. It is an amazing looking keyboard with WASD interchangable caps for better grip and a very bright backlight with effects in Corsair's iCue software. Check out this review: REVIEW: https://youtu.be/4tcdRnheaQc and the keyboard on amazon: AMAZON: https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-STRAFE-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B079F4L27F/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1533090915&sr=8-2&keywords=corsair+strafe+red&dpID=51x0naNzILL&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch NOTE: in the video it displays a price of 110 dollars, it is the same keyboard and you can get it new for 70 dollars. I highly suggest buying it refurbished though.
ads are getting dumber
I'm disappointed, you could have at least mentioned the Redragon k552. it costs $40-50 dollars and is fully RGB and has mechanical keys. even though it's a tenkeyless it's still a great option for getting a budget mechanical keyboard.
I have a K95 plat and it was hard choosing a keyboard because the market for them all genuinely all pretty good once you hit around the $150 price tag. Can’t go wrong with anything from my experience above $150. However, different keyboards for different things, keep in mind if that when buying.
Logitech has good accessories so I'm sticking with em. Gonna match my mouse
Cool keyboards!
The Hcman gaming keyboard its 29.99, Its mechanical and has RGB lighting
Honestly, I hate having lights coming from my case, my mouse, and my keyboard. I like the only thing to light up to be my monitor when I'm gaming.
I like keyboards
Razer black widow chroma v2 with green switches?
DAMN!!!! that name, "Deathstalker"
What about the Kinesis Freestyle Edge? It is the ONLY true split-ergonomic mechanical gaming keyboard on the market, nobody else makes ergonomic gaming keyboards. Nobody! It has probably the most impressive macro programmability features of any gaming keyboard period and is RGB. Kinesis isn't as well known as Razor or Logitech, they've been making keyboards for years for business and this is their first gaming keyboard and they bat a home run on their first try. More people need to be talking about this keyboard!
i needed this video
I just want to hear the sound they make when you press a key
im using the Logitech G610 White LED version, Cherry MX Red, got it at Best Buy for $100
no redragon pretty good shit i do say so myself
My personal thoughts are to never buy from razer, I recently purchased the Ornata Chroma for 100 Dollars the switches sucked they space bar was sticky Their app synapse was laggy and unreliable I could if gotten a lot better for even 50Dollars
You should’ve mentioned the Redragon kumara k552. It’s like 45$ with rgb and blue switches (not cherry) I love it
$10 Walmart keyboard and done.... Not fucking hookers yet with keyboards... so no point to spend a lot on them...
Got a blackwidow X for 7bucks, best deal ever
Clicky clacky type of sound is my jam
Can you make a top 10 keyboards for beginners will be highly appreciated
I have the azio and it’s a pretty decent keyboard and it handles well
Usisng the G.SKILL RIPJAWS KM780 RGB Cherry MX Red Very good keyboard, no problem with it. If I change, going with Corsair or gonna stick with G.Skill. Pretty impress with the quality of their keyboard. Or going with ROG. I love the Style of their ROG GK2000 Horus Mechanical Gaming Keyboard
Filco
If your product has "RGB" in the name or is at all capable of RGB lighting, It's definitely not for me. I have enough flashing lights in my life.
I never am looking for gaming accessories. . . I have no need to be here. . . but I always watch these for some reason.
10 keyless keyboards are like jeans with holes. The less you get the more it costs.
Why isn't the Redragon K552 mechanical keyboard on here for $30.00,it's the one i'm using too.
You fellas forgot one: the Corsair K95 Platinum.
gaming laptops please
ehh i got the razer keyboard blackwidow.. really good!!!
Been using the old poker 2 keyboard for some years now

Do a "Commenter Edition" follow up video. I'd love to hear what other people would recommend.
I have a Xplore Clash one i dont know if they have it in every country got mine for like 40 Euro has rgb Mechanical keys and multi media keys
Aula Reaper it's fast and collision free, besides has cool rgb lightning and is cheap you guys should defenitely check it out.
i need a low profile gaming keyboard with rgb. anu suggestion?
where is the red dragon kumara keyboard. this video is bullcrap.
Personally, I can say that the Logitech g100 mouse is very good, rosewill products... I will no longer EVER buy due to terrible quality, the Razer deathstalker essential is a solid keyboard only major drawback it doesn't have anti-ghosting like it claims (registering multiple key inputs at one time). Happy shopping!
I love razer!
I like quiet keyboards but everyone else doesn’t like why?
and I'm just sitting here using a MS Digital Media Pro keyboard from ~10 years ago...
What about that small mechanical, water resistant, keyboard? (Forgot the name of it)
Do one for Headphones
That Razer keyboard is NOT the cheapest Razer anything you can buy. This Razer mouse and keyboard pad is $20 so ha
Yes yes, very fancy. BUT....are they compatible with Windows 98?
Im loving my new G.skill km780 RGB with the cherry mx brown keys. it's my first mechanical keyboard and I have not been disappointed in the least. the software still needs a bit of work, but overall it's a great experience.
What about: Redragon K552 KUMARA $30 GK-FORCE K83 RED $40 KG010 by EagleTec $39 DREVO Calibur $62 MasterKeys Lite L $44 Any of these options are better than the first 5 mentioned in the video. Except the Drevo, which is over $50 but under $100.
EagleTec has a pretty nice mechanical keyboard it's $49.99 on amazon!
Huh, that first one is door-able?
This was cool. Do one for mice please.

I use a razer ornata keyboard. I got it because I bought a deathadder and I wanted something to go along with it which isn’t over expensive but isn’t just regular membrane switches
I have the Corsair K70 Mk.2! Woo!
I loved this video. ESPECIALLY that you did two different price ranges. I just recently built a gaming computer. Since I've done it on a budget though, part by part over time, I had the accessories as least important. So seeing a list of varying price points is fantastic. If you could do a Monitor and a Mouse video, that would finish the set and very much appreciated.
Can you guys do like gaming headphones headphones under $150 bc im really stuck and don’t know what to buy bc I really want quality but also don’t want to pay an arm and a leg
Azio Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (MGK1) Is very good :O fore 54.99
didn't realize you guys even did PC...given your content.
I have the Blackwidow Ultimate with Razer's orange switches and I DEFINITELY recommend this to buyers who are looking for a semi-expensive gaming keyboard. But I also want to say that I am looking at the Logitech G810 Orion, and I think that should have been put on there as well
You can get Mechanical keyboard for 50 dollars.
I use a razor adder. It's simple but it works
I use the Logitecg G810. If something happens to it, I will buy a logitech G810
The Azio Levetron L70 is def not under $50 dollars.. its more like $100 dollars
Ugghhhhh i want hat razer huntsman elite so badlyyyyy
Can I get recommendations on pre built PCs I’m trying to get into pc gaming Rn looking at a iron side pc
Can you guys make a Before you buy No mans sky next
how many times did he say low key, low profile, no frills
This needs more low profile keyboards for people like me who hate mechanical keyboards...
I recommend the Logitech G413 if you like the G513 but you don't want to spend as much. It's basically the same without wristpad and RGB lighting. Also the Romer G switch are fantastic. It costed me 82 € which is basically a steal
Literally bought the K55 yesterday. Stoked I made the right choice
i like how anything that has RGB lights means it's gaming related
Been using my Corsair K70 for years, and still works perfectly. ;P
All I need for my keyboard is rgb light, number pad, and volume dial.
coolermaster? nah? k
I just want foam wrist rests that are extended closer to me from good companies. these "Good" wrist are most of the time plastic and make me wonder whos dead wrists they used to test it. Im eyeballing that Razer one, it LOOKS soft. I imagine a wrist rest to be like a pillow for the hands, not a rock. Corsair >->
Thank you guys so much! I’m looking into getting my pc setup this weekend and I’ve been researching what keyboard I would like best. Definitely putting some of these into consideration. Super helpful video??
Razer blackwidow v2
Ahem..... razer black widow chroma V2
I have been using the Corsair K65 TKL for a while, it was on sale for one day on Newegg at $60 and has Cherry Red switches. Other than that, not much else to say: good feel, media keys, its compact, and its very simple. The keys don't light up, let alone being RGB, but they are really solid. Even if I do upgrade to a better keyboard, I will keep it around for travel use to LANs or something else like that. Sadly, it's not in production anymore, any used units I see on Amazon are ridiculously expensive, so get something else, but this keyboard ROCKS.
Holy moly, I was just thinking about buying a new keyboard and you uploaded a video on it.
If your really looking for a good mechanical keyboard I would highly suggest the Tekkery RGB keyboard for only $28. It has multiple light effects and have very tactile blue switches. Best keyboard for the value.
lol, this video just made me buy a Razer Blackwidow Chroma V1, It was on deal at Amazon.
"non name brands" I have heard of ALL of the mentioned brands. Also I KNOW that ALL of the mentioned brands besides Rosewill (they are more well known for their computer cases and computer power supplies) and Kingston (they bought Hyper x like in 2016 or something I think and they are more well known for their RAM and external storage products such as memory cards and USB sticks) are VERY popular amongst the mechanical keyboard community as the 2 latter brands are newer to market as far as I know and ALL those brands products have appeared on channels like LinusTechTips and besides Rosewill and Kingston I know that the other brands have appeared on Unbox Therapy
I got a keyboard for ¢25 at a thrift store along with a HV-MS735 mouse for $1 which goes to wow you don’t need to spend a ton of money on accessories
i have the corsair k55 rbg Keyboard and i hate macro keys i had to pull off the (G5 and G6) keys
this is sketchy
Up next 10 best gaming keyboard under $1
Also recommend Vortex Pok3r Keyboards. Welcome to the Pok3r club ;). Vortex Pok3r Limited Edition RGB with Cherry MX Browns here. White/Silver one.
I need a new mouse. My g102 prodigy died in 2 months only. So disappointed. Any recommendations?
hyperx fps pro
I use the SteelSeries Apex 100. Not super expensive, I payed $30, but it is good for me. It is also blue backlit. You guys covered something similar before. Nice keyboard. You can also program the keys for your games.
I bought the Corsair K95 Platinum for a 149.99 when it was on sale at amazon, best damn keyboard I've ever owned. I tested a lot of different ones at the local Microcenter.
I'm currently using the Steel Series APEX 100. It's a 30$ Keyboard that is extremely well built. I haven't had the ink on the keys wear off on me yet, as compared to my last keyboard, the keys wore off after a solid week of use, and it was around 50$ or 60$.
Ajazz AK33 is also a great mechanical RGB keyboard under $50
I thought for sure I'd see the Realforce RGB Keyboard on the list. It's the Rolls Royce of keyboards. Sure it's not one of those fancy popular brands, but it honestly beats them all
I am using Razer huntsman elite
I just bought a keyboard to replace my broken one and then you upload this. w h y ?
I'm incredibly happy of my DREVO Tyrfing 87-TKL. It's absolutely fantastic bang-for-the buck.
I got a blackweb mechanical keyboard with blue switches and 7 mode rgb lighting for 50
I have a corsair strafe I want a 10 keyless board tho
I have the K70 RGB MK.2 SE with speed switches and I must say this is by far my favorite one.
Razor Black Widow Ultimate. If it dies I get the exact same model again if possible.
I'm thinking about getting the Anne Pro
As an owner of The Rosewill RGB I highly recommend, amazing lights, enough modes to satisfy with adjustments on lighting and movement and to top it off this is the first time a wrist wrest felt right. The only downside would be that over all it is small, good for desk space but noticeably short key distance. (not recommended for large hands but you get used to it) oh yea and the keys are 10/10 has that nice snap/click but at times slow registry.
Just order the Corsair Lux K70 rgb...got it for $80. Thanks slickdeals!!
Pretty “low key” heh
Does anyone know a Keyboard that is White and is Mechanical? I'm trying to match my theme (a white and orange theme) and any Switches (except Razer green or orange, cherry red, black, white). If you know one, please reply. Thanks :D
just me skipp the first 5
I have owned a k55 RGB for a year and its really good. I've smashed it countless of times and it still works. with me stuff always breaks after a month
just buy a mechanical keyboard for 5usd instead of this shit sponsored commercial
K55 baby i'm shook i felt so popular! (xd i'm dieing inside)
I got that Razer deathstalker third owner got it by buying a friend McDonald's
I was 1k liker xD
cool
I prefer the Logitech G413 priced at $90 very simple keyboard with Romer G switches, but it is very reliable
Nah, just buy obins anee pro that's best keyboard for the price
Omg i was just looking for a new keyboard!!! Thank you so much??????
I have a RII keyboard and i like it. Another is a crytech...ye ye main.
Razer black widow x is really good
wanted cheap mechanical tkl keyboard
The best keyboard is called intous pro
anyone who has the giant keyboard key? (razor hunterman elite)
Can we have a giveaway
My chat headset is Hyper X; I know what I'm adding to the basket right now! Thanks so much for taking the time to find these neat keyboards!
the only razor thing i can afford is my mousepad lol
I thought we may see the Drevo Blademaster on here somewhere. All good though
I wasn't aware of the "mechanical key" craze until recently and think they're pretty overhyped from a standpoint of someone who isn't a super duper hardcore gamer who wants miliseconds of latency shaved off, and the ability to customize eeeevery single key like a drugged out EDM party. I'm content with a more low profile membrane keyboard with basic solid color backlighting.
you should do mice next!
I was just gonna buy a keyboard, what great timing!
3rd party controllers and gadgets are always pretty cool
No Magicforce 68? List is just bad
What about the k95 platinum, you should had at least mentioned while you were talking about the k70 m.2.
I don't really even know why I'm watching this, I'm way out of my league. To myself, a very casual gamer, a keyboard is a keyboard, but they look cool at least. :P Thanks Gameranx for enlightening me today.
I hope the keyboard in the thumbnail is under $50, please don't be click bait.
im gonna buy a new keyboard sooo should i buy Razer Ornata Chroma Razer Blackwidow X Chroma or a Razer Blackwidow Chroma
I recommend the Logitech G213 keyboard, nice sound, looks good and can get it Around £50 or £60. Very good keyboard
I have the Razer Chroma Blackwidow V2 with Razer green switches. I paid £150 for it and am very happy with it.
Literally just about to buy a keyboard. Thanks!
theres no such thing as a "good" keyboard either it works or it doesn't.
2:51 low key lol
If you are looking for cheap boards under $50 and still want the name brand, check out Cooler master. I have used a lot of their boards due to affordability and they are very solid. Worth a look
Can we get monitors and mice next, i really gotta upgrade
I have the HyperX ceeboart
Surprised you didn’t put Redragon in here
Literally just bought a keyboard yesterday. I'm kinda irritated that this wasn't uploaded yesterday. Could've gotten a better deal.
Reddragon makes a $60 mechanical keyboard. Spend the extra $10 people and thank me later
Hey, I’m tryna switch from Xbox to Pc gaming, what a full setup under 1000
what about the razer ornata chroma? yes it isn't a mechanical keyboard, but from my experience its really nice
am rocking the corsair K70 1.0
buy an RGB keyboard from china its not bad and it costs around 30 bucks
No redragon keyboards in a budget keyboard list?! Blasphemy!
I'm still using my Razer Black Widow tournament edition from 2013 and see no reason to get a new one unless it stops working. Maybe I will eventually, and keep my old one as a spare. I got a Deathadder mouse at the same time, the left button quit working a few years ago but it was warrantied and they gave me a chroma for free.
I need the numb pads because I use them instead of arrow keys
Corsair k70- I feel like it's underpriced
Dorable. Durable
Now do one on mice :D Unless you already have and I missed it...
Do a monitor one!!
Thanks dad
razer deathstalker is so bad and so expensive
PC PEASANTS
Used a Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard, it is an old model, extremely comfly,, just bought a Razer Tartarus, Using an old Logitech mouse that has proven reliable beyond expectations.
Im using the Corsair K95 Platinum and it's the best keyboard I've ever laid my hands on. Bit expensive though but I have a feeling this is the last keyboard I'll buy for many years.
Razer Ornata is cheep(I got one for 1900NTD,about 60USD,without chroma),good looking,and have a great wrist rest
I know their is a keyboard with around 9 function keys. Its razer I believe and has 3 x 3 rows.
1. aren't there mechanical keyboards under 50$? I imagine mechanical switches are superior to membrane and hence would be priority. Rgb ligths whatsnot, all frills adding aesthethics, not gaming experience itself. 2. Why section for mechanical keyboards have to go over 100$? There are lots of decent mechanical keyboards between 50-100$ this list is missing.
If you were going to put the huntsman elite, I think you should have put the k95 platinum instead because it's a similar price range and debatably a better keyboard (this is in disregard to any order of the list btw)
There's a very nice keyboard you missed. It's the Redragon K552 Kumara. It's actually great for the price. I was able to pick it up for $30
It would be better to get a pc first, nah i will buy them all, they look nice
Lol
I use a kinbas rainbow led keyboard for my gaming ( PS4 )and an Ares Multi-color keyboard for creating stuff on the Unreal Engine 4 and Blender. They both have the breathing effect tho.
Why don't they list the prices
AZIO MGK1-RGB-BLU MGK1 RGB Gaming Keyboard, Still going strong after two years of heavy gaming. Highly recommended
The 100$+ keyboard seems good for long term,but I would check some youtubers opinions on PC accessories. An example of that is rocket jump ninja , or his website =).
Love the video today
so not a single mechanical keyboard under 50? meeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh
Witch one would be best for esports
Hey can someone give me some advice in order to choose what keyboard to buy? I'm deciding between Razor Blackwidow Expert 2014 and HyperX Alloy FPS (brown switches). I really like the Razor one but the red backlight on alloy is so nice. Did maybe someone used any of this for a lttle bit longer so he can tell me any experiences (or maybe even both).
my mechanical keyboard was 22€ from china and still going good after 2years
i have to say, i've been using the nr.1 little brother for about 4 years now and its still rly good and never had any problems so my next will be the k70 mk.2
dont buy anything under number 5, they are all poopy membrane keyboards overpriced because of rgb. if you dont care about rgb just buy a corsair k66 or gigabyte k83, those have cherry mechanical switches and cost the same as those membranes with rgb.
I’m using a black widow chroma v2 with green switch’s
Next time you do one of these videos can you do one where you recommend the best type of Gaming consoles and PCs
You dont know how much i needed this.
Corsair Strafe RGB with MX Browns. Love it.
I can agree, the k70 is nice. I use the original version of the k70 and I love it. I pair that with a Logitech g502 spectrum mouse. Great combo
I replaced my Razer gaming PC keyboard with a top of the line Corsair K95 and I liked it so much, I bought a cheaper Corsair K66 for the office. Oddly, I like the K66 more.
I yelped when you put the k70 mk.2 as #1 because I love it so much! I’m buying mine next week!
SteelSeries bois
RAZER Huntsman is a shitty placebo.
PERFECT TIMING!!! I just got a new pc and I’m looking into getting a good mechanical keyboard, thanks for the info!
can someone pls help. I played on a macbook air for about 1 1/2 years and i wanna find a similar keyboard for my pc as the keyboard that is used in the macbook air. Does anyone know any good ones? max prize i would say is around $100
so many membranes, why ? :P
Really makes me want a new keyboard; got a blackwidow here and didn't even know wrist rests were a thing for a while now...
Membrane keyboards for gaming? ??
What about crosair k95 RGB Platinum ?? If you ask me its better then k70 MK2 ????
im kind of upset that you guys didnt mention the steelseries apex 100 its a nice cheap keyboard with blue backlighting, its not mechanical but its a really good keyboard ive been using it for a couple months now and for $30 its not half bad
Got a Corsair K70 RGB over two years ago, got it for under £100 because the shelf label was wrong - score. Would've been like £150 or so otherwise.
Heey, just got myself the K55 not too long ago. Love it, such a good deal. Although the macros being on the left is a little off putting. I can't even express how many times I've hit 'G1' instead of 'ESC' :p
Fucking thank you. I was looking for a good keyboard to buy.
Using the Filco Majestouch Ninja with Cherry Brown switches. I love this keyboard and I bought it for £140 here in UK a few years back. In hindsight I could maybe have gotten a TKL variant..
G901 and G502 best combo ever Logitech fanboy
I hate the new sound YouTube put for when you like a comment
I use the deathfire ex mouse/keyboard combo. It came with a "hybrid" keyboard and the mouse comes with 2 extra buttons and have a dpi switch for 51 dollars (at least in chile)
Hell yeah I needed this some much
imma go for that k55
Next up? Keypads followed by mouse pads, then headsets, then microphones, then controllers (Xbox variants and PS variants), then speakers, then webcams, and then finally....mice XD
Does anyone know a good tkl keyboard around 100-120
Logitech G15. Best keyboard ever. I actually bought 3 used ones on eBay this year to have spare parts. No new keyboard got 18 G keys and those are so useful in MMOs. Build quality is great, too. Wish Logitech would ship a new version with mech switches.
If the Hyper X Alloy had RGB 10 keyless then it be the best keyboard.
Oh yeah yeah
no redragon for under 50?
Rocking a custom-built KBD75 75% keyboard with gmk screw in stabilizers, custom Royal hako switches with 70 gram 24k gold Sprit Springs, LGBT carbon dye sub keycaps. And I made the whole keyboard hotswap wolf with holtite sockets. Total keyboard cost ~$320 USD
I actually just bought the Redragon K555 INDRAH for $56.99. Absolutely love it.
HyperX alloy elite
4:01 TO GO TO PREMIUM, YR WELCOME.
I'm currently utilising roccat sova membrane as I game in bed. I love the look of the new roccat keyboard using Titan switches but I'm not sure I'm willing to join clack and clang master race
Like the k90 plat tbh
The HyperX is probably the most well rounded choice. The durability of that keyboard is second to none.
Great video.
I was thinking of replacing my shitty keyboard then i get a notifcation about this video ????
i have a Redragon K552 KUMARA red LED Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, and mouse.
I bought my razer blackwidow stealth edition for 30$ p r o f i t
I really need a keyboard
Thank you Gameranx I needed a new keyboard without costing so much
My keyboard is a cheap A4Tech. Been using them for over 15 years ??
Where is the guy who put prices
100 people are first
I was expecting the redragon mechanical keyboard
I love my Anne Pro 60% - Brown Gateron switches - PBT DSA Dolch Keycaps
wow seriously bad vid. what's up with this channel i feel like your the least qualified channel to be doing a top 10 keyboard video. like is this sponserd or something? these keyboards are really bad deals. why are there no cheap mechanical quality keyboards like: Eagle Z-888 or Mottospeed CK888 or Mottospeed CK108. those keyboards are in my opinion a way better deal. better top 10 vids: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXwQQZGE1U https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSKLwOPGw0I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6vM0YslQHU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4ACgvXyqok
Wrist rests are a game changer
Do one about headsets
any mechanical keyboards under 50?
Oh yeah yeah
there are many mechanical keyboards (non mx switches) with rgb under $35.
Redragon K552 is probably the best under 50 keyboard. Mechanical and backlit
My favorite is the razer ornata chroma. Expensive but comfortable
Funny how razer has to use light switches for anyone to even take notice. A4 tech bloody has been using those light switches for years
I dislike it when people ONLY focus on big brand keyboards like Corsair Razor SteelSeries like they're the be all end all. Look into small production stuff too!
Why am I watching this? I have a K70 LUX lol
Are you kidding me? I was literally just researching keyboards for my new rig when i saw this in my sub feed. What a coincidence! Thanks for the info too.
Give me dat heart
I just became a pc gamer
Well this video was just what I needed after spending all my money on Blackwidow chroma v2
corsair 95k Plat
I have a Corsair K95 Platinum with Cherry MX speeds
Cooler master has the best mouse and keyboard combo
Ive got a logitech g910, and I have to say, its by far the best keyboard I have ever used
A good idea for a video could be top 10 updated games. (But they should be full priced AAA)
These are some of the worst keyboards you can buy... Why didn't you reccomend mechanic keyboard that's 50 dollars? Yes they do have mechanical keyboard under 50
I use the razer blackwidow chroma v2 yellow switch(mechanical) and I love her so much
I reccomend redragon k552 or k561. It has outemu blue switches which really feel like cherry blues. Doesnt bend at all, built like a tank. Also RGB!
Now some gaming mice?
Got Logitech Pro, really good one! Although sometimes not wearing headphones you might hear springs do their sounds but, nothing disturbing.
Great choices, thanks for another good video!
10 Lewdest Video Games Commentators!!!
RGB overlord!
Still using a IBM keyboard from 98 haha
uh, the Azio Levetron is $93 on amazon.
alloy fps
i feel like the razer chroma is a little to much of an overkill. RGB everywhere including the wrist rest. The corsair its just simple and much better looking.
Have radical day Gameranx and Gameranx Viewers.
it would have helped if they show the price of the keyboard
GREAT VID! <33
I don’t think I can relate or appreciate a channel more than Gameranx. Thank you team

Come on, P Pop isn't that hard to reduce or negate.
Hey Mr narrator..you are simply the best
the 80s called, they want their pink cube back Edit: You actually sound like kermit
Sections are far too long.
...Tac lighter is cool - but - no versitility. Could you thaw a frozen lock? Use it as a light source? Even light a pipe? Too limited. Combine it in the handle of a survival knife.
make sure you tell us its "your phone, your charger your etc." every time
There is likely "sonic measurement". How do you think the "tape measure" measures with the button? I highly doubt it measures with actual laser, but is done by sound. The laser is probably just a feature to make sure you are pointing it at a surface. From an engineering standpoint sonic measurement is much cheaper and easier to implement because sound travels slow and therefore it would be easier to measure the time it takes for the sound wave to return. Light, on the other hand would be very fast and would require an extremely high sensor sample rate.
I have one
You don’t wanna spend $1000 on a phone but you will waist $15 in a speaker the side of my thumb
You sound like Kermit the frog
does your puppy has a problem? why is jeeter licking a stuffed animal?
there's an ultrasonic sensor on the measure king... hence the "sound" marketing
Lil speaker with big sound... This reminds me of my girlfriend.
Did he really see them on tv
Sonic measurement is the way range finders works
Sonic Measurement its just how fast the laser travel and give you the measurement. Nice Gadgets I am like it.
Magnavision = Brazil.
The blisters can be open with a can opener instead.
It has a sonic measurement, the laser is visual only and does nothing, cover only the laser and test it
$15.00(USD) at walmart or similar stores RCA antenna with signal booster i found to be worth it(WXIN FOX 59 for the simpsons)
Somebody's wealthy.
sonic mesurement .... you know about the sonar right
Anyone else notice that the TacLighter is actually a miniature taser? Should have had the volume on and tested it on your forearm-that would be a seller!
That measure king looks legit
"as seen on tv products are all the rage"
For the Measure King you left out the most important factor - accuracy. One review I found on youtube showed that the laser (sonic actually) mode indicated 27 inches while a regular tape measure was at 24 inches, with equally bad or worse results at longer distances - based on that alone, this is a fail, though the cord mode seemed fairly accurate.
Shoot all the marketing genius
this guy sounds like a grown up kermit
But did you check the accuracy of that tape measure contraption?
Beck! You have great taste in music.
Indoor Antennas are NO good unless you have a rooftop antenna to boost reception... It was so much better during the analog days when channels were far more accessible...
No headphone jack.
I would have thought that a Sonic measurement is referring to sonar used for measuring against the wall as the laser is only a viewfinder on the wall to see what you pointing it
You sound like kermit the frog
The biggest gimmick I saw in this video was the dongle thing that Apple tricked users into buying.
Nice video Kip. I enjoyed it.
The Measure King uses ultrasonic (like when an expecting mother goes in to have an ultrasound scan of her growing baby). The laser is not the measure, it is a direction guide for the ultrasonic measurement.
China is smart.
The measure king does use sonic measurement. The laser is only there as a guide.
WHY DID YOU LIGHT THE STINKIN SETH CARD!?!???
Antennas are antennas. No little antenna like that will work great. If you actually want to get great reception with an antenna for local TV and not cable or dish you need to spend about 70 bucks and get one of those huge TV antennas that are directional and go on the roof or in the attic. That is how you make use of free broadcast Television. Any little antenna are all the same pretty much garbage.
Actually, the "measure king" probably does in fact use sound to measure. Most laser range finders use more than one laser to measure distance and they are not visible. Being that this one has a visible laser, it's probably just there for aiming purposes.
Hello Max Headroom.
one correction the tape measure works with sound not with laser, laser is just to point
ummm... my tape measure does NOT need batteries to work after indefinite time of un-use... bs hype !
If you still have the boom cube, can you test it against dropping your phone in a cambro pan? Maybe a few of them of different sizes, but I expect a deeper one to work better.
get a oneplus 6 its cheaper and better than iphone X
20 channels ain't so bad...cause if you don wanna spend cash on cable...well this is kinda cool !
It uses sonar to detect the distance from whatever your pointing at. the laser just tells you where your aiming
Sonic measurement probably refers to ultrasonic distance measurement, which fires ultrasound and measures the time it takes for it to bounce back.
WOW, forgot all about your channel and havent seen a video in years!
1$ stocking stuffer
"lets bust into this heavy duty packaging and pull out.." 0:35
What about flex tape and seal ?
Oh come now Kip, You mean there's absolutely NO way you could KipKay tinker with that antenna to get it to work better?
Why that look like an iphone3
Hot oil and gas all over the place.
dont get tangled that some harry arms
the measure king has a sonic feature. The laser only shows you where are you pointing at. Then it releases a high frequency clicking voice and measures the distance by the eco of the voice (Doppler effect) That is why it does not work in bigger distances and in noisy environment. It also can show wrong reading when you have an obstacle in between.
When you moved the antenna to the window, were the channels at least more clear?
That lighter ?? would make a great ???? weapon. ... kind of.
Who'd 've thought an antenna for Tv would be so useless in 2018?
Man I remember watching you since I was like 7 ??
Nice! You guys got some drum'n'bass playing as the intro! ;]
For a true test of the waterproof claim you should try to light the candle underwater.
Use magnavision on the Nintendo switch in table top mode
Ok YouTube I watched now please stop recommending it
God your like if my dad made YouTube videos ?? it's hilarious and your content is quality
Dude, you are so funny yet very educational, thumbs up :))
I have clear blue TV antenna . It works great. I get 20 clear as day. Even in Arizona I lived in the middle of nowhere i still received 20 channels
yup bet u wont heart my comment
Beck for life!!!
I wonder if the electric arc could stun if say, pressed to someone's skin or clothes?
This lighter looks really dangerous! I'm no expert but the open electrical arc would at least burn you if you touch it.
The Taclighter is great! As for the Measure King, my phone already measures distance with the camera.
sonic measurement is pretty common and worse then laser measurement, the tested device has no laser measurement, would not recoment it for exact measurements, the laser just helps to see at witch point you direct the device,
Smegmavision, made in Chiner?
Now we have products witch can have a claim on the package that says: As seen on youtube !
You really dont know the difference between water resistant and water proof
the easiest way to measure isnt with a tape measure, the IPhones do it now :P
Nice to know that you're still doing videos KipKay. Keep it up!
How about circumference not diameter.
The seaker in the intro is so good not the boomcube the one in the intro, was about 5 dollars and was fully worth it
It does have sonic measurement. Above the laser is a small speaker that chirps, it then times the receival of chimps and calculates distance. Sonic measuring has been around for ages.
You can change the world dude
Still glad you're around
Woah it’s been a minute since I watched a kipkay video
Water RESSISTENT not proof
The original King of Random!
The cube went boom in fortnite
He lives!!!!
Come on bro! A good TV signal it's worth the hassle of moving!
Any antenna can receive HD channels. And, any and all antennas are limited by a line of sight and distance. So, the claims are realistic. It's the reason cable TV is the only viable option in most suburbs where broadcast antennas are more than 35 mi away. But, if you're within range, antennas are the way to cut the cable tv bill.
I just got the measure king n i liked it. I was wondering what he was gonna say about it. It's a great tool
The news reporter at the end made this video somewhat worth it! ...not really but it was nice lol 9:42
sonic speed like how fast it shows you the ft
As seen on TV a teaser that light things too
Are we not gonna address that the tactical lighter looks like a Juul??
Wow this channel still exist! I remember watching this guy when I was young ?? he's awsome
Kermit?
"Must keep antenna within 35 miles of broadcasting towers" LOLOL
I could be wrong here, but the measure king does not use the laser for ranging, it uses sounds, it only uses the laser for aiming.
that extension cord looks like you pulled it out of a swamp
Props for BECK
"As seen on TV" usually describes worthless objects that are advertised in non-prime time hours.
The laser is just a guide for the ultrasonic measuring device.
Love the Stinkers... HAHA just so I know never to even try them.. thanks. thumbs up..
Just got my Measure King, it is awesome! I measured my dog and my wife's head now my family hates me; but I still love the Measure King!
Cool lighter
IT SEEMS THAT LOGIC STATES THE "SONIC MEASUREMENT" IS ACTUALLY LEGIT. IT SAYS "LASER GUIDE". THE LASER IS JUST A LIGHT SO YOU CAN AIM IT AT WHAT YOU WANT. IT'S NOT USING THE LASER TO MEASURE, IT IS USING SOUND WAVES TO MEASURE.
An I the only one who has experience with string lines? They stretch and break. Apparently we're just going to skip over this fact it's affects on the measure king or how the measure king compensates and still achieves accurate measurement.
I'm surprised you don't have an As Seen On TV "OPEN IT" plastic cutter. Best $14.99 I ever spent for opening those dang hard plastic wrappings. 8-)
"So that's a big thumbs up for the measure king....no idea if it actually measures accurately..."
You just made a huge mistake - measure king got sonic measure function and the laser is only a pointer. DID you check if all the measure functions work correctly? You just gave it a huge thumb up but you should get a thumb down for this video.
These Arc Lighters aren't special every other person had one in 2016/17
How can you give a big thumbs up to the Measure King without even checking if it measures accurately?
@ 6:40 ish when you say "there is no sonic measuring" - are you sure? if the laser if just a guide then it might not actually be the laser measuring.
The igniter has potential to be a taser, don’t you think? ??
Wow you're still on Youtube lol. I've been watching since your laser videos. Glad to have you back
Great job!
Hey doofus it does measure with sound (sonic).
Wow you guys are idiots, it is an ultrasound distance measurement, with a laser guide exactly as it says... A laser measurement would be better but more expensive.
Haha YES its been so long since I've watched your awesome videos! Keep it up man!!
hey look, after like 6 years I found your channel again, last time I watched you was when I was like 7
The boomcube is a furry eradicate all furries
Dude, the antenna one is just a duh moment. It was the same way with rabbit ears 35 years ago, it's just more finicky (and more dependent on what digital carriers are broadcasting over the air in your area) due to the much higher bandwidth requirements of digital.
Where is flex tape!
Who takes ?? anymore

Regarding the Measure King. The laser light is just a laser pointer so that you can see what you are measuring at the other end. The actual measurement is done using an ultrasonic transceiver in the hole above the laser emitter. There are actual laser range finders but they cost a bit more and are more accurate.
Am I high or does this guy sound like an older Kermit the frog
bought the tac lighter ,used it a few times and it worked ,one day went to use it and it didnt work a small spring had fell out and the pieces that do the spark and been wobbling all over the place ,had to repair it,,it works agian but cant fully push the top of the lighter up
I think having one of those HD TV antennae- but not specifically this brand - is good to have in case your provider signal goes down, for emergencies. Even pair it with some type of battery backup and efficient tv so you can check the news in case of power outage/cellphone signal loss.
Need to check accuracy on measure king
I feel like the magnifier has some potential outside of its intended purpose tbh. Maybe not out and about but definitely in a workshop or something. ??
thanks, that was great..
There is "ultrasonic sound" distance measurement. It works reasonable well if there are no obstacles and when you have surfaces which are good sound reflectors like walls. The Laser is just a "guide" where most of the sound energy will focus, it does not measure distances.
are you kidding an F-ing stun gun!!!!!!!!!!! O its a lighter ....and my brass knuckles is a belt buckle and this kitty cat EYE GOUGER is a key chain
yes there is sonic !!!! I have it right here ...read the directions carefully you point it and say eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
Why are you sending that cute lil chocolate ice cream emoji guy .for stinkers ....that's the one I send to all the cute girls that I like .... I know it might be pudding ..still sweet either way....
Was the measure king accurate?
Very helpful. Thanks :)
HD antenna using a coaxial cable ....didn't know you could get 1080p through the coax input of your TV.....??
that tape would be good if it had MM instead of CM
I sure am glad I unsubbed several years ago. This guy is still just as lazy and stupid.
I wonder why do all these cheap gadgets have packaging 10 times bigger than them selves.
do you not have a pop filter
well you're wrong about the sonic measurement, ever heard of sonar? and the laser says it is a guide, so your "laser measurement" was actually likely just a hypersonic ping (at a frequency that you can't hear) and then it just times the echo...
The tac lighter is literally a small arc taser
You measured the circumference of Tor Johnson's head, not the diameter :) :)
HD antennae... lmao I mean yeah it can pickup HD channels but, so could Anything you plug into that antennae slot, you could get similar results with a coat hanger LMAO
His IdK what Sonic measurement means therefore it doesn't exist is kinda Short sighted... It sounds like it uses the Ultrasound frequencies
The most important issue with any measuring device is the accuracy of the measurements. Thumbs down for just playing with the measuring tape and not confirming whether it is accurate or not.
The laser is just to guide the sonic measuring. since you can't see sound, ya gotta point the lazorz at it. Hope that cleared something up!
I thought the lighter was a vape pen
It looks like the laser just points at the object that you are measuring the distance to, but that is just a visual guide to point at where the ultrasonic waves are aimed for measurement.
theres no measurement by sound? Damn those engineers and scientists who made us believe that Sonar in submarines actually do that.
?????? ???????
it is kool that you make these kind of videos. but the comments that you make about these products and the sarcasm in your voice makes you sound like a hater, and very non professional. I mean some of these items may not be good for you or anyone at all but no one is forcing anyone to buy these products. I mean what it comes down to is there making money. even you had to pay for all the products that most of us wouldn't buy.
The laser does not do the measurment. It is just a pointer for an ultrasonic distance measurement. That measurment is not acurate as the sound can bounce off uneven surfaces and cause it to be useless. Also as there is no reference surface on that tape you get a distance, but where is it to on the body?
that extension cord looks like is about to go boom any moment
They mean ultrasonic
Only stinker here is your lame a$$ iphone. Get a real phone Pixel 2XL!!!
The antenna is good if you're on a boat and can actually point it to known broadcast towers. Works well for me.
the Measure King's sonic measurement is with the laser. The laser is to aim it, and it measures distance by how long it takes the sound waves to bounce off an object and come back, we have a similar device in my physics class.
Promoting chinese goods. PRC is proud of you and is granting you two free plastic toys.
Your intro music thing is pretty much like how it is made show
Wow! I grew up with you, didn't know you were active!
Great Video
Wow, if my window had scenery like that I wouldn't be watching tv.. Beautiful...
- yo bro sonic measurement is real and is cheaper, lasr is actualy a marketing buzz word and exist only on more expensive tools
You sure that Measure King has a laser, it’s infra red surely!
the laser points at the target to be measured and the measurement is made sonicly
Every digital antenna gets signal from towers at different distances. Mine picks up with 50 mile range. I have no problems.
Something I didn't see but expected, tactical sparked (forgive the pun I couldn't pass it by) by my own poor vision. That was that the screen magnatier used a prismatic sheet but didn't seem to make rainbows all over. I'm wondering if these so to call booksheet magnifiers would any better just the same. I think I might have one if so I will put it up.
Measure King IS sonic! The laser is used just as an alignment device.
You don't wanna spend "an arm and a leg" on a new iPhone!? What's wrong with you? lol
The tactical lighter is a stinker, bought on but after a month of use for cigarettes the thing started to fall apart and it arcs to random spots in the lighter and melts itself
How you give the Measure King a superrating, without testing the accuracy, I really like that device, but I still don't know if it works
Dolphins and bats can tell you about sonic measuring.
The sonic measurement is how it measures the distance of the object you point the laser at. The laser is just so you can see what the "sonic" echo sounder is pointed at.
This video reminds me of 2010
beck
It really is sonic. The cheapest way to measure distance. That laser is just there because...
B O O M cube
don't houses have antenna's?
Use a can opener on those packages instead of scissors I’ve heard it works better
The laser is just to know where you are pointing. The actual measurement is done with high frequency sonic and measures the return time.
Been so long since I’ve watched kipkay, still quality content and blowing up. Good stuff ????
Beck VEVO will be sending you a letter for that song lol
One, iPhone is thee worst cheaply made, overly priced, worst camera. Cracks easily. Anyone can afford s8+ or s9?? or note 8 or 9.. iPhone music is worst speaker.
Great song choice for the boom cube!
Why devices aren't using 18650 batteries has got me.
The tape measure is perhaps the most useful .. depending on how accurate it is and how well it's made that is
The measure king is in fact using sonic technology to measure the distance, the laser is merely a guide to line up the device.
Nice to see ur back
the piezo battery lighters are great for lighting candles that are deep inside the candle holder, where a standard size lighter won't reach. Before getting the piezo battery lighter, I had purchased numerous brands of the long neck butane lighters --- they were ALL junk. You would have to press the button over and over again to get it to light and they break after only a few uses.
I wouldn’t mind one of those lighters for camping and the measuring tapes
But what if its so bad, IT'S A SUPER STINKER!
does this guy realise that the laser is just a guide for the sonic measurement, its funny to me how he thinks that because he cant hear it that there is no sonic measurement just because has no clue how it works
I swear I have seen the same review on another channel
I had to stop this video almost instantly due tooooo the voice my god
Just because you are out of range is not the fault of the antenna! Did you get even one channel in clearly? Then it works. The tape measure is probably made so cheaply it will break on only a few uses, and is probable less accurate than most measures of higher quality.
Boy sounds like Kermit the frog????
Teen wolf?
for the boom vube you need to have you phone on charge for it to work better. oh wait you got an iphone :0 crack out the dongle
Aw man I remember those cards I collected those when I was a kid! The All Star Monster Baseball Team!
the fact it was BECK on the boom cube, is a yes
The tactical light is basically a taser
They are a POS!! I fell for it
there is no laser mode, it is sound mode, laser is just a guide.
6:13 Im starting to hear kermit in his voice
The measure king uses sound waves to have an approximation of the distance from the device to a surface, similar to how we use sonar to graph how deep a body of water is, it projects a sound, waits for the waves to go back, divide the time it took by two and there you have it, the laser is just a guide. Therefore the acoustics of the room may change the reading of the measurement, to which degree, I don't quite know.
That tac lighter is huge those kinds of lighters are everywhere and they are the size of a normal lighter smh
You didn't show the accuracy of the measure
the tape measure uses sound waves to measure, the laser is just a guide...
How accurate is the fancy tape measure. If it's off by an 1/8th or any amount, its worthless.
Glad that you’re back to posting, I remember watching your videos like 6 years ago and they were very enjoyable
It definitely uses sonic measurement. That's how all of the range finders work. They work pretty well too. The laser is just a guide as pointed out by a few others here.
The Measure King could never replace a tape measure for me. The cord mode is interesting, but lacks versatility of use. The sonic measurement and roller mode are both features that seem quite useful and ones that I'd like to see integrated into standard tape measures.
The sonic thing is how it measures. The laser is just a guide as it is clearly labeled "laser guide"
GREAT video Kip! Really enjoyed it! Later...
The measure king laser mode may in fact be a sonic mode with a laser depiction of the target point.
I had no idea Kip was still around!!! NICE!!
I strongly suspect that the "sonic" feature is actually working. It would be much cheaper to build an acoustic ranging device over an optical one. The laser is probably only an aiming aid.
The sonic is what does the measuring, the laser is what lets you see what you are pointing at.
you dont seem to have a lot of product knowledge and are misrepresenting the products because you dont understand them ,I got more information from the comments than from your video
Cara-bin-er?
Your phone is much louder than that Keeney coop thing and I love that track from beck by the way every last one of them were bringing horrible Mike literally the worst as seen on tv product of ever seen next to the shake Weight a course especially the lighter thing when you can just get a lighter and you don't even have to check it I'm more curious if I could shock someone with it I would be a multi tool you didn't really cool if you did a handful of a seen on tv products they're actually cool
The laser is just a guide for the sonic measurement. It doesn't really measure.
the measuring tape is not reliable at all and inaccurate.
hack the measure king
I thought this a BBQ...??
This guy sounds like ernie lol
iSheep ??
That hole above the laser is the sonic measurer that you mistaken as thinking was laser. The laser is for aiming only.
Please upgrade your camera and mic
If you lay your cellphone on a pkastic or paper bowl, where the corners are touching the sides if the inside of the bowl. This will deepen and project the sound toward thw USA eiling and thus fill the room. Try this. You already have the bowl...try it...pass it on
ultrasonic measurment exists (check parking sensors on cars).
boom cube might work better for movies then music.
Can you move to test the antenna properly please
into the trashcan it goes...
That magna vision lens makes an excellent fire starter in direct sunlight, It will even pop little pieces of sidewalk up from thermal shock!
The section above the lazer/Laser (Peephole no wot tit meenzz weadder it'z Speld wit door wittowt uzen ay essoor ayzeee) is the sonic actuator. Theater is only an alignment tool. The lazer/laser DOES NOT MEASURE ANYTHING do better research
your audio voice need to b modern..it seems like I am watching 19th century vedio
i.phone are for suckers super conned
Re. Measure King: It actually uses "sonic measurement" when you activate that laser. See, the laser is NOT actually doing the measurement; rather, the laser is simply being used as a visual pointer for YOU to see and target the object to which you are measuring distance. The Measure King device then fires an ultrasonic sound wave parallel to its little laser beam, and an electronic circuit times how long it takes for the ultrasonic sound wave to echo back. This is how it determines distance. Another name for this technology is "sonar". Sound familiar? (Excuse the bad pun!) With the sound being ultrasonic (frequency higher than 20 kHz), humans can't hear it, and the sound waves tend to have very little spread, making the targeted measurement fairly accurate. Hence the need for the laser pointer, so human eyeballs can help you precisely aim where the Measure King's sound waves are being directed. Long story short: The packaging is NOT lying or being misleading; you need to brush up on your physics before you criticize.
the fact that kipkay listens to beck...a man of quality
coax is not hd
IF YOU SPEED THIS UP X2 HE SOUNDS LIKE KERMIT
You're infact a garbage pail for destroying that garbage pail kid card.
Why would you destroy a garbage pail kids card?! Monster.
My dude I’ve been watching you since I was 14, I’m 23 now aha
Yeah those HD antennas are not worth it there was another version of it I tried I got nothing
You kinda sound like Kermit the frog ngl
Ay hey all
What case is that
Which iphone u're using in 2k18 ??
The head of Tor Johnson ...Wow....
It's the beast of Yucca Flats......LOL
sonic measurement is referring to the ultrasonic distance sensor. It's typically found in robots to determine the distance between it and the object next to it. You may know it better as SONAR.
He sounds like Kermit the frog trying to imitate a human being
Just saying since we're on the topic of as seen on TV, the tub shroom actually works, however, you need to clean it after (and sometimes during) every shower.
LOL That line at the end about moving or getting a longer cord made me laugh a bit more then it should =3
as a note on the measuring device: the "Sonic" measurement is how it measures distance, the laser is just to verify what you are pointing at and dosent measure anything so the "laser measurement" is the sonic measurement
this flimzy plastic piece of...... magnovision
You sound like Kermit
Consider getting a pop suppressor.
Thanks for taking the time to review those items, many people would appreciate that.
* uses tac lighter as a tazer *
Glad to see @kipkay posting again! ????
I missed you so much i thought you were gone!
I missed you so much I thought you we're gone.
There's no laser, it's sonic!
My eyes
My previous comment to this video has nothing to do with the validity of this video. The commented I had to leave was against Liberty Mutual. The previous comment that I made, made no sense due to censoring. Liberty Mutual is the worst insurance company you could ever use. Please do not uses this company, they will do everything they can to not pay. I have personal experience and if you do not believe me look up their reviews.
whats the id on that tune in the intro
This has nothing to do with a video that you're about to wyou that I'm gonna give you is on Liberty Mutual perion Liberty Mutual is the worst insurance company that you could ever buy. Buyers beware. They are just like any other insurance company and try not to pay out to any claim that is made. They take it to another level. They will literally hire other people and pay them money they try to keep you in limbo so getting something paid for.
Where has this dude been? He hasnt released a vid in like 5 years.
WC Field said, and I quote, " There is a sucker born every day ".
Better camera lighting and background please
The sonic measurement could be real... if you read it carefully the box states that the laser is just a laser guide. It makes a lot of sense if the gadget really uses sonic waves to measure the distance while the laser is just a guideline, targeting the object you are trying to measure... But Sonar measurement would be more accurate
The jokes on you, you bought all of it... and on me, I watched the video :D
The measure king is super inconsistent.
That Boom Cube thing would have been decent if it were bluetooth instead of using a 3.5 mm jack
were there any pop-filters as-seen-on-tv?
Well, bats and dolphins survive on sonic measurement, sonar too is a form of measuring distance through sound waves, you only need to know the speed of sound waves in the media you are using it in (for air we generally use a standard value of 340ms^-1 which refers to air at sea level under specific temperature and humidity), then you just need to measure the time it takes for the wave to be reflected and come back to the source s=(v*t)/2... Same as for the laser, except sound is extremely imprecise unless that thing also has a barometer, thermometer and hygrometer, plus a way to analyse the air composition as any minimal variation in the air will affect the speed of sound waves
Someone sends this man a properly sized screen protector
lol, needed a dongle for audio...
I'm glad your back kip I love your videos
It does not measure by laser. It measures by sonic. The laser is just for letting you know where you point the actual sonic measure device.
At 2:48 - extention cord dragged through swamp then set on fire before use here. ...glad it still works! Enjoyed the vid
Maybe the “sonic” part measures decibels???
How can a technology guy not understand they're using ultrasonics to measure the distance and the laser is just an alignment aid?
Measure king. Bet they meant the measurement was quick like Sonic.
Thank you for this video! A lot of scams out there and videos like this help people not to fall for them
lets spray water over this arc of electricity then hold it in our bare hands......seems legit. great advice :)
Gud vid bro
Measure King accuracy tests, anyone? I'd really love to see if it actually does measure up.
Mesure king is inaccurate
The tv thing does not work in the uk
Btw that style of lighter is super handy and awesome. however the one you bought looks terrible compared to the much cheaper versions. they make ones that are the same size of normal lighters with dual arcs for better lighting. they run you about $6. Side note they make a fairly loud and high pitch noise that is super irritating but you only have to put up with it for a few seconds
iPhone-were gonna remove the headphone jack just so we can sell you a sperate adapter
The measure king you and ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance the laser was just telling you where was pointing at they weren’t lying it was he using sonic technology to measure
The HD antenna thing is misleading because all antenna's will come in HD. The best one's you plug in the wall to amplify the signal.
Re: Measure King..... Just update that iPhone 8 to iOS 12, and use the handy measurement app. All snark aside, that lighter does look pretty cool.
Would have liked to see the measure king compared to a real tape measure for accuracy
wtf is a "Cara-Biner"? its actually pronounce [kar-uh-bee-ner].
Recommend watching this 1.25 or 1.5x the speed. He talks really slow otherwise.
Man i was here when i was in elementry school... 9 years ago. Im happy for you kipkay hahah, i remember those laser videos and such
Have I been saying tiny and carabiner wrong all this time? Geez, thanks. Edit: Memor? . . . Memor? Commence instant rage, pointing and shouting profanities at this guy while getting pulled out of the room by strangers.
Yeah try to ignite those lighter inside a pool ??
Hd antennas work great in the city btw.
I don’t know but his voice is annoying af
i highly recommend the flameless tactical lighter. i own one and its really useful not having to refill my lighters with lighter fluid. Also, it works as a self defense weapon since you can taze people
That is one grody extension cord.
Were u been?
No wonder there are micro plastic in almost all salt on the planet now..
I had one of them screens for my gameboy
The laser doesn't measure it just is a guide for the radar or sonic measure
So went you go to light your cigarettes and/or joints and you put it up to your face and are a little drunk too and you miss your cigarette and it touches your face will you then be tasing yourself ? Well if you get into a bar fight you can tase your enemy !!! Hey ! You live in Florida..Kool Love the sarcasm...
Magna vision looks good .
The antenna worked as advertised if the directions are followed!
Yeet
Kipkay is back?
TACLIGHTER from Bell + Howell seems to be the one only that worked? Rest garbage.
Did you say furry! Fuking triggered dude. Real nice.
Subscribed!
I thought he retired probably on a prolonged break. Bin watching you on n off for years good to see u back.
Your voice sounds like Kermit the Frog
Woah you went down hill
I'm a little surprised you picked pink with cheetah print for your boom cube
it uses the sonic measurement to measure the distance, The laser is just a guide for it.
So a taser
I remember Kipkay before all the fame... now, dog porn. sweet. lol
I didn't know kipkay still made videos. Good for you, kipkay.
I gave the tac lighter to my brother inlaw it was a zippo lighter type
my dad has one of those lighters but its way smaller
that looks like my dog betty
I love it Kipkay very nice upload so more video what want to see more
IPhone sux

8:30 name of the produk?
Mein Durchfall fließt wie ein Fluss!
Clear vision must be from the same people that made clear tv They look the same
The sonic measuring is referring to the ultrasonic waves that it creates to measure distance when you use the laser. The laser does nothing in terms of measuring and is only used as a guide.
Good video
circumference of the guys head was measured, not the diameter.
I swear kipkay has been making these videos for way too long
You get the same channels with a paper clip pushed into coax input I swear
This video was made by the makers of measure king
I think the measure thing's laser use for guiding the target
Your puppy is so prettyyyyyyy
I grew up off this channel.
Sonic measurement is the laser. I believe it uses sound to measure stuff. Someone had a video on this exact measuring tape and explained what it was.
nice waterfront home in Florida!
Very cool. Thanks for the test. Where can I get that ruler.
Sonic Measurement is the laser; the laser just guides you to show what you are pointing the sonar at.
Hey dude you must keep doing those videos they are amusing and you are going to straight to the point to explain the cap abilities of those devices I really enjoyed your video
Sonic Measurement is the laser; the laser just guides you to show what you are pointing the sonar at.
Hi
Exactly what YouTube has become. I’m out
You sound like Ernie off Sesame Street ??
You never checked the accuracy of the Measure King. I think we would all be interested in the outcome.
From building things with stuff you had laying around to reviewing as seen on ?? products what's next cooking with Kip?
I don't get the electric lighter. Instead of butange you have a battery which will last about the same time or less than the butane. Now if the lighter was solar where it charged from the sun and stored that in a little battery then we have something a little bit better.
the sonic measurement is the laser lol it works with the apparatus above it to calculate distance based on sound and reflection
Good call on the Beck ??
Kermit the frog reviews: AS SEEN ON TV PRODUCTS!!!
A bus is an automobile.
As seen on TV. Don't expect your tape measure to have a conversation with you, I'm no genius but a guess is its referring to ultrasonic sound waves the lazer will use to bounce off the wall.. The same way a flying bat may
Thank you ! Great job
What iphone is that
i could see the measure thing working fairly well for going around corners ONLY if your concerned about inches, but anything more precise i have serious doubts. i used digital tapes before and they are never accurate in details inside an inch . from what he showed while reviewing it, or more to the point, what he didnt show, i suspect they are just as sketchy.
Well.. the laser mode in the measuring device is using ultrasound waves (or ultrasonic) that you can't hear, same as sonar principle, and the laser is just for pointing. That's why it's called sonic measurement
Desables is a measurement of sound
Kip must've just got outa Prison. Kip's next Vid: How to Hack an Ankle Monitor
the electric lighter is actually a really cool device (I own one) BUT DO NOT TRY TO LIGHT A METAL SPARKLER STICK WITH IT OR YOU WILL BE REMINDED THAT IT IS AN ELECTRIC LIGHTER
Omg kipkay is still around?
compares a 15$ sound cube to a 1000$ phone
I definitely like the tape measure one.... But I but I wonder how accurate it would be.
Beck!
Tak lighter is a tazor sign me up
I guess this ultra sonic sensors I connect to my arduino are a complete lie :/
I see why you have so many followers! Thank you for a channel. That gives awesome information Ann no politics! THAN YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!
on the measure King (and other tape measures like it) I've heard the laser is just for show (to give you reference to where you're pointing at) that actually does put out a sound (that we can't hear) that bounces back and that's how it gets its measurement, kind of like a bat I guess
What a legend.
Que onda guero?
Not upgrading your phone isnt a bad. If I had to use a phone I would use my galaxy s three. If you are wondering I am writing this on my samsung tablet 2. I dont 5hink I will ever want to upgrade because it is such a good tablet.
did anybody explain kipkay about sonic measurement?
As far as that Boom Cube goes, you should take into account the fact that most people who would buy that $15 speaker are also the same people that will not have an $800 phone available. They probably have a budget phone and that cube probably sounds a lot better than their phone speaker.
the tape sonic mode just means lazer look at package on amazon to see
Comments are 90% it measures by soundwaves 5% why would you buy this 5% I bought that
I don't know why you gave the antenna a bad review.  Most people live within 35 miles of a broadcast tower.  Just because you don't isn't the products fault.  My experience with as seen on tv products tells me there are probably better quality antenna's a person can buy. These products usually don't work as advertised, are a piece of junk or work good for a little while but them stop working completely.  Bell and Howard's are the worst.
I like the tape
That how it's made intro hahahaha
Hmmm...boim cube? More like the stuff they were giving away a few years back in the serbian elections...and it was weak as hell...
3:40 sounds exactly like my headphones
I remember his Satellite Dish Hacks, Where he got over a hundred of digital channels!
So glad you're back kipkay. I have to ask man, where were you these past 8 months? I was afraid you were gone forever
The last time I watched kipkay was back in 2009.
' how come america company dont make it any AS SEEN ON TV
9:44 Signal seems pretty clear to me
"Sonic measurement" really uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance, like a bat. The laser is just for pinpointing the reference point. The measurement is NOT made by the laser.
Nice new intro, sir!
I just thought of a good insult. Just call somebody the name of a crappy as seen on tv product.
5:38 it's actually the circumference, not diameter.
Kipkay is back!
Having worked construction for years, and used a tape measure hundreds of thousands of times. I don’t think that measure king is really that useful. It’s of a tool that we like to call a “homeowners”. It’s not a real tool it’s kind of gimmicky and would be fine to a normal person that doesn’t do too much construction.
5:34 time to go for measure
3:13 it’s alive ??
Haven't seen you around for a while. Welcome back
6:58 perfect detonator
That measuring device very likely is sonic. I have used sonic level and measuring devices. Laser on it is only for the purpose of knowing the spot that you are measuring from.
“hard smoker COUGH household hacker COUGH”
Guess I’m dumb cuz I spent 1000
I cant believe how many people get suckered into buying a t.v. antenna every time it gets a new name. Yes its free t.v., the t.v. antenna has been arou d since the dawn of television it isn't new. Its even gotten my mother in law..... twice.... 2 different types.................twice
That extension cord screams fire hazard. And 1980/90s
I like the tape. Milwaukee makes a similar one, but has a magnetic tip. The one you reviewed probably costs a lot less, but most Chinese knockoffs are crap anyway. The ignighter looks like sometyhing to add to a bbq kit for lighting a charcoal grill.
you big skinky
The Measure King does use sonic measurement. The ultrasonic transducer is obvious. The laser simply indicates the target surface and has nothing to do with measurements. Are you sure that you have enough knowledge to be testing and rating these products?
The laser is just a pointer. It actually measures the distance with sound waves. Its actually how the first cameras with auto focus worked.
MagnaVision...I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.
Did you really need to explain how to charge something
good vid slow clap
I'm not allowed to watch t.v on Sunday morning anymore..
Boom cube is okay i have 3 of them
Please don't burn garbage pail kids!!!!
1:29 ??????
that is one amazing salesman's voice . probably an ex-salesman himself long time ago .
my man really forgot that ultrasound exists :(
the measure king, unless you're measuring a round object, the lazer function makes everything else redundant
The "Sonic" part of the MeasureKing IS how it measures. It sends out a ultrasonic signal (like a bat) and measures how long it takes to come back. The laser is so you know WHERE its measuring from! ;)
Lil speaker
Holy fuck it's kipkay! I forgot about your channel man!
i thought coax was as dead as my grandmother.
awesome video thanks !! i want the tape measure now . also, when you open ur blinds it looks like the Boca Raton inter-coastal . am i right ?
can you be my dad thanks
The lighter is garbage. The friggin idiots made it using plastic around the ignition source. Because nothin spells intelligent like designing a fire source out of cheap plastic!
Urrrrrrr backkkkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ?? ????????????????????????????????
Now this is the real kip kay
if you have ever used the measure king u would throw in the trash awsome wway to get sued by an employer as in it never measures the same distance twice
The measure king is an ultrasound mesuring device ..The laser is only there to point the direction of what is being measured ..
I watch a lot of Freakin' Reviews and Vivian Tries and this popped up on my main page as a recommended video. Hope that helps you see how some people get here!
Wall E would approve of that first one
Pipsqueek lol
Glad you’re back kipkay
ohmygod i remember watching your videos YEARS ago. Glad to see you back :)
This seems like a copy of household hackers seen on TV reviews
One of the OG's!!! I remember when I used to binge watch your videos when I was 10
READ the measure king package, it said LASER GUIDED, the laser is only to guide, the sensor above it, is actually doing the measuring which is done with sonic (radar)
He's back!!
M
I tried a few different types of antennas. You know which one worked best? The wire I bent into a squared off figure 8. One end inside the coaxial cable, the other end on the outside of the cable. But... If you have hills or mountains between your antenna and the broadcast transmitter, you're screwed. Otherwise stay with the wire i described. These other antennas you buy only stop working in a few days, if that long.
4:08 more like a boob cube.
Won’t spend $1000 on a phone, but burned Ipad’s and Iphone’s like it’s nothing
beck lmao
NOW THIS IS THE REAL KIP KAY!
He’s backkkkkkkk yessss
Magna vision I had decades ago on my Game boy.
1:10 lol
smart subjects.
If you look on the packaging is says laser guide and sonic measurement so the laser is to guide you and it measures with the sonic emitter and reciver.
There IS a sonic measurement, and is cheaper and very unreliable. The laser there is just a cheap one for pointing.
Your upload schedule and content has gotten so weird.
Wtf 1:29 hahahahhahahahahah
Stop copying ashens
the boom tube must be destroyed every single one of them and if possable the asshole that thought of it.
Glad I saw that the TV gadget is useless. Planning to buy it but changed my mind.
Hey ur still alive! :))
Lol, I had a boom cube a few years ago for a speaker less mp3 player
Its shows only a pic in lidl
What good is a lighter you have to charge when the power goes out.
Da fuck is with all this packaging these days??? Every time I'm walking by the ASOTV section at the store, there's 4 times more packaging than the product needs. Ya'll seen that old psa in school? "The wrapper, the wrapper, don't let the wrapper fool you, uh huh, uh huh." Shit's getting worse, no wonder there are islands of plastic floating in the Pacific.
Yo watup
The measurement is ultrasonic, that's why you don't hear.
This is the first real ressurgance of viewers I've seen on a video of yours in a long while. Ive been subbed for a few years and this is the only video ive seen in a while that's gotten close to half a million views
I though this guy was dead. But it's nice to see one of the OG's youtubers is back
Household hacker wanna be
Im early somehow. Thank you recommendations.
I remember back in days of Metacafe before coming to youtube when you were great. over the last, long while it has gone down the hole. I hope to see you get back to your old ways.
My guy Kipkay is still in this bitch doing views. I watched him when I was 9
would that tac lighter work as a tazer also probably give you a good burn
U should stop uploading
Last name Kipp yes boy
Haha a prison lighter
That speaker would be considered as a dollar store item lol, the quality is so bad and it just looks awful! The setup is bad and they didn't even try when designing it. If only I could I'd take it down from stores and slap the guy/gal who made it
At 6:19 the measure king uses ultrasonic measurement, not laser, the laser is just a reference for you to know what it's measuring. A true laser inferometer would be very expensive and bulky.
That magnifier certainly is a joke. I remember back in the late 70's they had one for your living room TV set. That was when big screen TV's were new technology and quite expensive. So they had this Fresnel lens you stuck in front of your 19" TV to give you a bigger screen. What a joke that was. But I figured that "tape" measure and spark lighter might be something that works.
how can i stretch this video to 10 minutes?.. oh i know! spend unnecessary time unboxing the product
hello about the antenna @9:00 do you think it can improve the reception of the channels i already see?
suggesting the cigar style electric lighter, pins on a side, for easier lighting.
Then get a android
3:48 Put your phone in a glass or metal cup. Plastic doesn't work as well because it absorbs.
I'd like the lighter if it was a Lil cheaper
Hello Read more
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
I bought the HD antenna and had to move the TV in the garden
i havent watched KipKay sense his laser flash light video yeeeaarrsss ago but man i knew that voice the second i heard it. Long time no see ??
You misjudged all these. They all suck pretty bad.
That’s not an iPhone 8
What's with the companies putting the apostrophe AFTER "lil"? It's not a liltle, it's a little. The apostrophe goes here - Li'l.
Teri phan ni
The thing you called laser measurement is just a guide to wrere is the sonic measurer pointing. It's right on the package.
UPLOAD MORE FREQUENTLY MANE
Thanks for the video Great job
I just can't believe Americans are still working in fractions, you did, when you were five years old and then the rest of the world grew up.
Your videos are too few in between
Yep, it is sonic. That presents some issues since a surface irregularity in-between the device and the object you wish to measure can result in false readings.
sonic measurement hahaha
that make a good taser
WHERE U BEEN FOR SO LONG TOTAL FORGET KIPKAY
Tac lighter is just a big V A P E looking T H I C C taser
Kipkay please buy a bland new clean extension cord with the money you make off this video
A Samsung galaxy is also an igniter
Forgot Kipkay existed
where the heck has this guy been for the last 6 years??
It measures by ultrasonic, the laser just gives you a point to aim at - packaging even says its a laser guide...
Nobody cares if you don’t have the latest iPhone. You sound like everyone else on YouTube cept lamer.
why does it look like you copied a channel
“Fool proof shop lifting packaging”? I think any kid w/ a straight-razor in palm can get to it :)
iPhones are stinkers
i’m either going to have to move or get a really long cable. best line
You should destroy all the stinker gadgets with a hammer or something.
Welcome back
Tor Johnson star of Plan 9 From Outer Space LOL
Dude, back off the microphone a little.
Dude the sonic measurement is being made when you point the laser. The laser is just for aim purposes; otherwise, you wouldn't know what the measure king was giving you a measure of.
#householdhackerdiditfirst :)
Please do more as seen on TV gadget testing. I trust your judgement
Why didn't you check the measure king with a real tape measure but I enjoyed the video
Samsung has dolby atmos so try the speaker with a s9 please I wanna see the difference with Dolby atmos
But you always have great content for years!!
You didn't check the Measure King for accuracy and my Bell and Howell Tac Lighter didn't work for long even though it was fully charged.
The laser isn't what measures...the laser aims the Sonic measurement.
ahhh remember the days of make magazine weekend projects... Good days
Lol funniest video yet
I could sit for hours watching your cute little pup licking that toy.
Care-a-beener
kipkay now reviewing stuff from 2005
B-Tech Household Hacker
7 months later
Extension cord has seen better days..... looks like its been chewed my a miniature dog ;O) agree about the iphone comment...sheeple will be sheeple tho..
Annoying voice I’d like to stick his thumb up his rear
Those hd antennas are a joke....all of them!
Household hacker imitation
This could be a good series. Make more of this in your future videos!
Sonic sound is sonar like technology. The laser is just a guide to see where u aiming at. Tape measure
Finally back after 7 months
this would be a cool series.
My misses has a box with pink bits and fur around it.
Beck, yess
People always say I don’t wanna spend $1000 on a phone but it’s not just a phone nowadays it’s everything now!!!!
Ive always wanted to make his laser lighter
This guy is like mythbuster and how its made combined
Kinda feel like he's copying house hold hacker
10101001
Is his cat still alive? I forgot everything about kipkay.
This guy made my childhood.
I kept hearing something that sounded like morse code from the music
Measuring tape actually does use sound that uses ultrasonic sounds that sends sound at a frequency we're not able to hear toward the object and then wait until it bounces back and using a calculation to tell from how long it took it to go all the way there and bounce back to tell you how far away what you're measuring is
It is sonic, the laser is just the guide. Seems to use the same basic idea as a Infrared Thermometer. Point the laser at what you want to analyze/measure.
The laser wont measure the length of impact, its the sonic measurement
I have a boom cube!
Any viewer, serious about their Clear Vision HD, would've moved within 35 miles radius of the broadcasting antenna, immediately!
This guy still exists? Wtf
It has Sonic measurement. It just uses the laser for a guide then uses the Sonic to got the measurement.
The measure king uses something called ultrasonic sound measurement, it uses sound to measure the distance, so the laser is just a guide, therefore the ultrasonic speaker is the real measurement device, the laser is only a guide to help the user.
Re: The Measure King. The package says "Sonic Measure" and "Laser Guide" . GUIDE! The laser shows you where the sonic measure is hitting.
I’ve been watching your channel for like 6 years way before I had a yt
Hey Kipkay, I love your DIY videos very very much in the past and right now, also I'm sorry to hear your cat tux, because she was a cute cat to your videos hopefully domino will be a troubleshooter like tux so keep up the good work kipkay, keep doing awesome DIY videos ??
I have two of those HD antennas they work great at my apt..
5:34 AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!! ??????????????
Da Booooommmeer!
Sonic Measurement means the Laser thing. The Laser is only a guide where you pointing at but it is measuring by Sonic.
Thank you for taking from your time to review the products!
I don't know why I'm so happy that Kipkay listens to Beck
its good to see you back !!!
Just a quick note the measure king is using ultra sonics to measure the distance the led/laser is just so that you can see what you are pointing at
9:43 who is that reporter
You're still making videos?
I want to keep my iphone 8 with me forever!
Where have you been ? Its good to see back
Missed you Kipkay. Hope you're doing well and you hack these to be better.
Actually the sonic is the laser measurement, the laser just a guide for you to know where the end of your measurement
Is this the house hold hacker?
Do you take apart iPhones?
Portable electric lighters have been around for two years or more.
It probably said sonic measurement because since it's cheap, it probably uses ultrasonic to measure instead of an actual laser. The laser is there just as a guide.
Finally someone makes sense of TV products! I dont buy anything from tv
Hi
Whooo He’s Back!
What was with this 7 month hiatus?
Nice vids, see you next year!
Welcome back Kip!
Let's gooo! He's back! ????
Kipkay posts a new video. WHAT YEAR IS IT!!!!
The Clear Vision HD is just a glorified TV antenna. You're just going to get local stations, and all TV stations are digital anyways.
Why the hell would an OTA antenna be anything new and exciting needing to be considered an as seen on tv product?
legit said “yo kipkay is alive?”
welcome back kip
HE IS BACK
7 months no posts, comes back like a king
It uses sonic sound to measure when the laser is on. The laser is just so you can see where you are actually pointing the device. It uses ultra sonic sound which most people can't hear.
flex tape?
Did you actually check the "Measure King" against a ruler or tape measure? I'm betting it's inaccurate.
Tyutfggyyhggghhgg Like if you agree
Nice view
I was here October 17
Manet the ment fast when they said sonic
Wow, this man is still alive?
Good to see you back KipKay
God Kipkay, its been so many years since I last saw your super chill video. Glad you're still here man.
Isn't the clear vision illegal?
Sonic measure uses sound wit the laser. The laser tells you exactly where the sound is reflecting from.
Kipkay is back baby!
Where have you been? Thanks for uploading! :D
he kipkay your back?
Why is this in my recommended
Bruh i used to wach u when i was 5 lol
FYI sonic measurement is the technology used for the laser measurement ! the laser is just a guide what makes it work is the ultrasonic
Wow what a video I can’t contain myself
KIPKAY= THE ORIGINAL HACKMASTER
Kip! Yeah! Seems like forever since we’ve seen your videos! Glad this was in my recommended list! I had to go and check your channel to make sure there wasn’t anything I maybe could have missed lately but nope, it’s just been a bit. Anyway, i tapped that bell icon thingy for good measure and a chance to see more of my favorite kipkay content! From seeing out your window, it looks like you might be dealing with hurricane weather. Hope all is good and safe in your world!
Who the hell is tor Johnson LOL
I believe the laser is just for easier pointing. The sonic transducer is doing it's thing perhaps. Do you hear any clicking noises from it while measuring with the laser method?
Glad to see you back
I think the boom cube, and similar small speakers, are meant for MP3 file holder devices that have to be plugged into something (even if they claim it’s for a smart phone).
“Planes, Trains, and Automobiles and Buses” was one of my favorite John Candy movies.
Did you test the accuracy of the measure king? Others have tested it and it failed. None of the measurements matched and were about 10% off a normal measuring tape.
Good video
Wow cool
I've been using OTA antennas for awhile the indoor type like the one you tested are hit or miss and have a lot of variables for them to work. Also it helps if you know where the towers are.
6:31 i think its one of those ultrasonic sensors. It actually measures distance through sound by producing high (i cant remember it was in a class lol) or low frequency sound and calculates on how long did it take for the sound to travel back to the sensor. Its usually used like a proximity sensor.
Nice Dongle
I remember watching your videos from over 5 years ago omg
I t is a sonic measure. The laser is just an aiming tool. it actually uses sound to measure...
HD antennas are great. And they have ones that get better range than 35 miles. You seem like a tech savvy guy, you should know that.
U sound like Kermit the frog
Is the measure king accurate? It may give you numbers but it's useless if the measurements aren't accurate.
Time travelling to 2005?
I miss Tux
HouseHoldHacker ripoff, anyone?
Everything about this video makes it seem like it was made in 2005
how does the tacktical lighter work underwater?????
Some of these look terrible.....who thinks of these ??
Amazing keep it up
On the tape measure king, it doesn’t measure using the laser. It measures using the sound, it sends out a sound we can’t head and waits for it to bounce back. The laser is just a guide to show you where exactly you’re measuring
Thought this was a household hacker vid xD
Great video, please do more.
pop filter missing? kinda sounds like it
this guy has to have a killer kermit impression
The measure King DOES have a sonic measurement mode. It is what you called the laser mode. The laser is simply a guide. It gets the distance using sonic waves. Light waves from the laser would be too hard to calculate on something like that.
You sound like Kermit the frog
Dear people who make things...it is spelled LI'L. It makes absolutely NO SENSE to put the apostrophe at the end!
Thanks for a CLEAR explanation for every product on your table even said how secure the product was and how hard it was to open. Also I like the fact that you cut out the charging time from your video
Man, your voice ———- sounds like Max Headroom!
Your back
Could use a flat head to open the packages. That is if you know how.
5:56 did you actually double check the measurements with an normal measuring tape?
Well this is by far WAAAAYYY better then the last video I think the last video was disliked so much he removed it
boom cube is fugly.
Ok you never centred the mobile on the product and then you put it right up against it, so ofc it wouldn't of magnified it. If your gonna criticise a product, least do it the right way. I never watched on from there. i won't be watching any more of your videos as you were not impartial at any point in what i watched.
I forgot about you,nice to see you back
Oh me early
Slipknot eyeless intro for his intro lol
Remember when kipkay used to make things on his channel?
Very funny ??????
Kipkay is coming back
The laser on the measure king is so you know where it's pointing. I think it uses ultrasonic sound to determine the actual distance though.
it’s been a while since i seen a kipkay video!
40%super 60% poops
3:50 hah a loud speaker wth no bass ,wth
you sound like kermit the frog
35 mile cable. Wow
Dislikes are from failed TV products
You're back again
Did anyone else see the measure king review by freakin reviews??? (James white)
He sounds sarcastic all the way through??
My boi kipkay is back, i'm so happy
I know nobody owns testing as seen on TV products can't be owned by anybody. But the title, wording, editing style, and thumbnail are all direct ripoffs of household hacker. Think you should at least give the man some credit if you're going to copy his videos
so... where were you?
They could be talking about ultrasonic for the measuring part
Wow your back
The king has returned
I've been wanting the measure king but I've seen reviews saying it is inaccurate. Did you test that?
I missed u
2:57 anyone else got ocd about the cord not being wrapped lok
That antenna works as well as the one I got from the dollar tree. Sadly I paid $30 for an RCA one at walmart and it works just the same as my cheap one.. Waste of money.
I'm more interested in your extension/power cord being burnt on top! Why would you use that in your video? Looks like you previously almost started a fire, some spark definitely came out! Maybe your next video can be "testing power cord" because heaven knows you need a new one ??
Well done video!
Anyone else think of only one thing to measure when he said round objects
??
5:35 WTF!?!?!? ????????
Song for boomcube??
I forgot this guy exsisted.
does this thing really work!
Oh hey there kipkay
It’s been a while but glad you’re back
There is sonic measurement on the Measure King - you showed it. The laser is just the aim for you to know the point to which the distance is being measured. Measurement itself is made with the ultrasonic device, which is shown on the box.
Welcome back kip!
just going to ignore the fact that he sounds like Kermit the frog
Is no one gonna question where Kipkay been for the past 7 months
So most of those had an easy pull off back on their plastic packaging also the zippo style of thoes arch lighters are at Ross for like 5 bucks
The tac lighter wasn't a surprise to me. Its just a taser with a much smaller voltage amount. Its not hard to replicate.
Intro song?
All of this stuff is the stuff you would find at the checkout
I believe the laser is just for visual purposes, it actually measures with Sonic frequency.
Welcome back good sir
Welcome back sir
Review Flex Tape.
Kipkay, where were you all this time? Also thank you for deleting that logo video. This is a better comeback.
The laser is just a guide for the users but the measure king uses sound waves that we can’t hear to measure how far away the object you’re pointing the laser.
KBDproductions?
Oh my god, He's alive!
Youtube OG
i honestly haven't found a over the air antennae that could beat my my DIY grey hoverman antennae that i have in my attic ...
Kipkay youtube isnt dropin
Finally!
He posted!!!
The TV antenna I have has an amplifier built in which actually improves the signal very much.
Welcome back
we can actually measure distances with ultrasonic
Where u been man
Man thought u does been a while
Household Hacker copycat
Boomcube sounds way better than my jbl totally guys I recommend all ya to buy it you won’t be disappointed:)
Only Kipkay would cover a high voltage arc with water and then use it.
Household Hacker By the way(
The shorter the cable, the faster the charge I believe
Do not use the lighter when wet i got electrocuted
sonic measurement is when a burst of sound is sent out and it determines the distance based off of the delay it takes to bounce off of a surface and return to the source AKA Echo location. And the laser is there so you can see where you're pointed.
It have (sound) ultrasonic measurement, laser is only to help You aiming. BTW: ultrasonic measurement are terrible for any object that are uneven and bounce sound wave so You should be straight to object You measure, any angle will affect measurement. I have quite expensive but right now obsolete Bosch ultrasonic measure device, and after couple trials of know distance... i just understand how unreliable it is and why they move toward laser.
Mongolian Chop Squad
Haha Dongle Haha Ok I'll stop
I haven't heard from kipkay in years!
You’re know what Kipkay? I’m genuinely glad you’re back. I’ve really missed you Man. I hope you’re doing well. I’ve followed you for a long time and you’re one of my favourite channels. Here’s to you ??
IPhone is trash
The "Sonic" refers to ultrasonic measurements, think echolocation. The Sonic emitter is located right above the laser which functions purely as a visual guide. As yet we don't have the technology in that form factor to determine distance at the speed of returning photons, but we can detect the return vibration of Sonic pulses.
Really thought it was household hacker
wow 7 months no vid lol
a much longer cable? hahaha, 35 miles coaxial cable xD
the last item was funny , either get a longer cable or move within 35 miles from the signal tower , WTF. ! ????
The sonic mesurement is the One with the laser, the light is only to point the target the time sound travel give the meter the mesurement
Measure King looks like something The King of Random would make.
.... that's literally house hold hacker...the thumbnail...and the starting and... just...-3-
oh wait you aren’t household hacker... i ain’t calling you out for copying whatever do whatever you want dude i support you
Whoa I haven’t seen a kipkay video since like 2011!
#Kipkay it's a sonic measure only.... Laser is for user's guidance.... To see where he is pointing it...
Is the measure king accurate ? You didn't say the only reason for a tape measure is to be accurate
sonic measurement just measures fast like sonic?
The thumbnail gave me the idea that you found a Termite zapper.
Do more
He's back! Ah memories.
$15! For that boom cube! Wow
You sound like kermit the frog
The laser is just a guide the big circle above it is the ultra sonic sensor which sends sonic waves to something or an object and it travels back and thats how it measures a distance the laser just helps by letting you know what your pointing at.
?? It's been a loooooong dayyyyy, without you my friend??
Heyyyy, welcome back!!!
YOUR BACK!!!!
Fun viewing. The boom cube use to come as an FM radio with clock for 8.95 worked well for a knock around where you just wanted to hear news ot noise and you didn't care if it got messed up.
Been here since the days of Tux.
this guy got 20 channels on his antennae and i struggle to barely get 10.
Yeah most these HDTV antennas stink....been through a few....
HE LIVES
He’s back...
Kipkays back!? :O
Measure king sorry but the iPhone got a new measure app
Kip Kay's finally back yay
must be in florida
lil speaker yuh
Why haven't you mad a video in a long time
Been a long time
Household Hacker?
the laser is really ultrasonic sensor. Good to have you back.
I’VE MISSED THIS CHANNEL
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS CHANNEL IN A FAT MINUTE
Wow.
That Magnavision device was in various Poundland stores in the UK a few years ago.
I FORGOT ABIUT THIS CHANNEL
Would have been nice to see the measurements using both tape measure and electronic to see if accurate
I love your voice! You low-key sound like Kermit the Frog.
Your house is situated in a gorgeous place
where is domino at
2:03 the boom cube is a stinker of you have an iPhone with no headphone jack??
jesus its been a while kipkay
On the measure King.. The Laser is just for a guide, the hole right about it emits a high pitched sound, and a small receiver picks that sound up
Oh wow you’re still alive.
i thought this was house hold hacker!!!
Does anyone else think he sounds like Kermit in some parts or is it just me?
Do a diy vape tutorial
6:29 the laser is just a guide for aiming the Ultra Sonic sensor. Hence the "Laser Guide" on the packaging. :/ So it's not missing any features
I miss when Kip used to do the Weekend Project videos for Make Magazine's channel.
Guaranteed the iPhone XS Max is way louder and better sounding than that cube thing.
Depending on where you are the antenna will be great or horrible
wait 15 dollars for the boom cube but it doesn't come pre-charged?
Youre literly copying everything houshold hacker does.
#bringbacktheoldkipkay
Anyone remember the metacafe days of kipkay?
Measure king does have sonic measure if I know right...it doesn't use laser to measure distance it just shows where it measures to...it uses sound still to measure
hey havent seen this guy in bit
Just get a 350€ phone to film in 4k. Could you test masturbation devices for men?
Hi Kay, how about the electronics behind this things?
You're black
dude your BACK if you pin this i will be sooo happy
Thank god we are glad you're okay
KIPKAY!!! Welcome back dude!
Wtf this guy is still alive
This guy is still around?
7 months break and no hi where have i been? lol
It's called 'sonic measure' since it uses ultrasonic sensor to measure distance (like hc-sr04, laser is just for the guide to point at target. This is common misconception with measuring devices using laser pointers as a guide. Even in those non-contact thermometers laser pointer below the actual sensor is just used to point at targets (they use ir sensor to measure actual temperature).
What ever happened to the diy tech side of YouTube I remember watching Kipkay 5 years ago and would get so exited because of lasers
@kipkay Good one. I mean your pun, (Busses- Bust). I need to get a life... Hahahahaha
I will say that something that wasn't tested but shown in the intro, the boomtouch speaker, the black round speaker shown on the tv in the intro, does work as advertised and is a very neat and effective cheap speaker. But, the volume is louder when using the audio reception amplification rather than the. 3.5mm headphone jack.
Stolen from household hacker? Testing seen on TV gadgets, ok. Trying to make the same funny comments, cringe
I love the 3in1 ruler but why dont you test the correct of it? Maybe the result not correct because it is digital and digital is not 100% correct as real ruler, should compare between real ruler and this gadget
I bought it for 1$ in India
Tested? Lol. You didn’t even compare the tape measurer with a normal one to make sure the readings are accurate hahahahaha, the lighter, you lit a candle lol, didn’t even test it with anything else, like a fire or a bbq etc
6:58 is that a juul?
It's ultrasonic
$15.00 for a boo cube. I bought an 808 thump for $13.00 and is way louder, and produces pretty good bass for the price.
We can use the fresnel lens to burn stuff with the sun!
You should know, that the "Sonic measurement" is the ultrasonic measurement. It doesn't have cool sound. Phew...
The lighter. I bought one after about 100 uses the tips wear out and stop arcing. So dont buy it.
My gf picked up a little blue tooth speaker the size of that boom cube except hers is a cylinder but about the same size. I expected it to be junk but it actually had great sound and last about 8 hours at full volume. Only down fall is you cant type while using the speaker. U have to pause the music or video then type. Idk if it's a feature. But it can be annoying but for 20 bucks it's a great little speaker
<3
Good to see ya
Good to see u after a looooooooonngg time
Switch over to an Android phone bluh. Don't settle for less with a sheep iPhone
This guy is to nasally
But if you move you will save $100s a year....
Wooooow, kipkay got sassy since his last video! Like seeing your personality come out in the videos. Seems like you genuinely enjoy it more
There is a measurement by sound,You can even buy some Arduino ultra sonic measurement sensors online
On the lighter, as one of the evil smokers out there, I was disappointed. It's really hard to get a cigarette to the arc to light it. It's great for burning other stuff though. Welcome back, was pleasantly surprised to see a Kip Kay video in my feed.
Finally
Long time no see my friend
Hey make more videos
9:43 check out those channels! ??
I believe (and could be wrong) the laser on the tape measure is just meant to aim it. The measurement is being taken with sound. So the sonic measurement claim may be valid.
Your content's underrated. I've been watching your stuff for about 5 or 7 years now and not only have you made cool things/taught me about soldering and stuff, but your videos are entertaining as all hell. More!
Magna vision we used to put things like that on our gameboys back in the 1990s didn't work any better then than now apparently
Measure king is the most redundant thing I had ever seen in my life... -here's 3 ways of doing the same thing... Especially the wheel and normal tape measurement, why? Why not just roll OR use it as a normal tape measure? Seems redundant... And that Taclighter, why not just get a normal arc lighter that is 1/5 of the size and does the exact same stuff? it's needlessly over-sized for no reason
What was the diameter of Tor's head?
The measure king is using sonic measurement. The laser is simply a guide for the tool. It pings a sound, detects when that sound bounces back to the tool, then measures the time and converts that to distance.
Yeeeeeeeeeeettboiiiiiiiiiiii
The tape measure is not accurate
OMG KIPKAY!! I haven’t seen a video from you in forever!!! I’m glad you’re ok!
@ 8:15 - "noooooooo!! Not stinking Steve" I remember my brother ripped my card because I told my mom he was playing donkey Kong when he ain't do his homework..
I would just like to clarify, no he's not copying household hacker he was doing this long before them but still there are hundreds of product review channels so please stop being so rude oh and It's great to have you back kip!
Omg Kipkay is still a thing!
Glad to see you posting again!
If you don't mind can you please make a video of what really happened to Tux the cat
You mean Circumference not Diameter.
the laser is just a visual guide for the sonic sensor above the laser
You should post more often
Copy cat
Been a subscriber ever since day one on kipkay. Love this YouTuber.
That's not a magnesium that's a ferro rod
youu aree backk yey
You still upload till this day thats cool
So you copying Household Hacker?
Did you check the accuracy of the measure device?
Great video! :]
Alright everyone will see you in 7 months again.
Check the accuracy of the measuring tool! I saw another video on it and it failed in all modes compared to a regular one, especially over some distance, even just 25 feet.
?? I have been subscribed for 9 years
Thanks for returning
We miss u! Come back!
09:42 best part of this video
Yooo what, this guy's still alive?!
You're alive!?!?
Thank you for the reviews on some of these As Seen On TV products, I'd questioned some of these products... would like to see you do more
The laser is for guiding the sonic measurement
He's not ??!
That news reporter was very hot though. @ 9:43
It's been a while
yeah now.. not previous post??
This channel has been around since 2006? I remember seeing you years ago. I feel like you should have at least 5 million subscribers.
Just stick your phone in a cup. And that measure King Is a tool that's made in China, plus my grandfather's measuring tape doesn't require batteries. I'd say no thank you.
You sounded like you were forced to make this video.
Oh you are alive. I still remember watching your laser videos and that cat when i was like 13 years old, i am almost 23 now Edit: fixed age.
You sound like Kermit the frog
Matthias did it 1st
I think that the "laser" mode in the measure king is an ultrasonic distance meter (like the parking sensor of a car) with a laser pointer for aiding the "aim"
You're definitley onto something here.
#householdhacker
Damn. I've been watching this channel since I was in middle school and I'm not too far from graduating college. Kip takes me way back ??
Yay! He's back
The measure king uses sonic not laser for the distance the laser is just a guide to see where its pointing at. to test this you could use a clear object like a window or something a laser guide would read past the window but the sonic would not
The problem is not you Kipkay, the problem is the internet has already done everything. There's just not much left to discover especially on YouTube. But the good news is, there's always the kittens playing piano. Meow meow. The unboxing was good it's nice to have this information. But you cannot test the antenna unless you were closer.
Brain, hand and eyes are the best portable gadgets in the world.
Hi dude
I subbed to your channel when I was a little kid for all the spying and fun projects you use to make but now you just do unboxings and stuff please do a diy or a neat project
Please just go back to Arduino videos....
Kip wtf happened to your videos I want more cheapy lighter laser burners not product reviews Edit: like so Kip can see!!!
Why ice cream smile ?
very cool Kipkay i love this video
The best product was the pair of scissors
The Sonic measurement did work. The laser is there so you know what the Sonic part is measuring up to.
Nice. Good to know.
Hey you stil life
Omg hes back
Thought you abandoned the Youtube platform. Where have you been? Thought you may of gotten a real job and not this Youtube stuff.
its likely the laser is just a pointer. the measurement is sonic, same as your cars. its much cheaper than measuring the laser. also others tried how accurate it was and it wasnt great
Ur backk
welcome back????
He's alive????????
Where you been?
Is this lowkey copying house hold hackers "as seen as TV" videos? Lol
Its been to long
Woot!!! Good stuff, keep it coming!
Woah hes back it's been so long
Mesure King is really cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10 ??????????
Is that ur face or a mask ?
Your alive!
Welcome back!
This video giving me 2007 vibes
On the measure king, the sonic read is what you referred to as laser. Yeh, it shoots out a laser to point with, but the distance is most likely done by ultrasonic pulses in the same way sonar works.
My phone is better then your phone
I immediately bought the measure king during your video ! Thanks !
U r coping house hold hacker
Finally something better
It been a long time. Welcome back
So, did you move? :)
Great! Nice to see that Kipkay is back!
How the hell are ya, Kip? Long time no see.
Lol that cube is pimpin
LOL APPLE PEASANT
ur back
boom cube speaker is so small and the fatal flaw was mono aural, single speaker in layman's terms.
How can you not upload for 20 years and the come back with a video half the "tech" channels are doing?
where have you been?
after a long time...
Finnnnnnnaalllyyy!!!! A video
very entertaining channel in youtube big thumbs up for me.
I didnt even know this channel still existed
cool
Reading glasses? I would use it with my phone to make text messages larger. That is what I do with two different magnifying glasses.
If you wana upgrade to a better phone buy a Samsung !
Nice
Who de fook is dat guy
entertaining. would buy the lighter though
It wasn't a laser measure. It uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance and the laser is just a guide so you know what your measuring
Better then your last one.
Happy to see u again.
Kipkay....i forgot you existed...
Wheel measurement feature on that tape measure was cool.
Do more of these kinds of videos
Great video kipkay! Been part of your audience for years!!
Could of at least tested how accurate the measurements measure King are giving.
really wonder why you dont just return back to DIY things...
Refreshing. I miss your videos.
Reminds me of Dr who electric screwdriver :)
You listen to beck?
kipkay lives !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just here to drop my dislike
It is ultrasonic. The laser is just for aiming.
Yay you got a dog
7:46It looks like a Vape pen
go back to how you were :/
Yeah those lighters work to a point. Some items are difficult to ignite if larger than the distance between the contacts. Work like a taser, & will burn & shock Ur skin.
Alive!!!!
...yeah, I'm thinkin kip's back
You should post more often
Lil' Speaker is my favorite rapper.
MEASURE KING HAS A LASER GUIDE, IT MEASURES WITH SONIC CLICKS... LEARN TO READ
Dam i forgot I was subscribed to this channel??
Oh shi
Hey look Down here ??
HE IS BACK like if u had the same reaction
Wow kipkay is still around, I've been watching him since I was 10
It is sonic, that's how they measure the distance without the cord or roller. The laser is just for you to see where are you pointing, the measurement is actually taken by sound. It emits one sound, and then counts how much time has passed when it reaches the device
should have tested the measure king against a tape measure. i saw a review on another channel of that and they did test it and it wasn't very accurate, off by several inches sometimes when they measured the same distance with a normal tape measure
ur alive?
From their look and build quality I assume these products were designed in 90s and made in China, their production cost is about couple dollars or less.
I have a speaker as small as that it's loud with ok bass and it has Bluetooth
2033 anyone?
You Made A New Video! How Exciting!!!
Oh, he doesn't know about measurement by sound?
I like this
Kipkay seems so rude in this video. Just the way he is talking doesn't seem fitting of his previous videos.
I was going to say that I hope you make all the money back through this video. But I suspect you purchased these so you could scavenge them for some cool future projects. Looking forward to those! welcome back!
it says right on the package, the laser is the guide for the sonar.
someone needs a pop filter on the mic.. so the boom cube will quit booming my sterio
What iPhone is that?
Uh... welcome back?
For $60-100, you set up a REAL antenna, outside ABOVE your home....and get around 50+ miles easy..With a booster...even better.
So glad to see you're back Kipkay
Nice dongle kip
Finally a real video.
I had totally forgotten about this channel
Love these kind of vids brother
Actually, the Measure King does use sonic for measurement. The laser is just for targetting.
I remember watching kipkay videos amost 10 years ago, it was some of my favorite channels back then
the tiny cube
when will there be more diy projects?
that laser is doing nothing more than give a rough idee where you are pointing. the measuring is done ultrasonic
Hi kipkay
Essentially a taser at lower voltage
Big fat stinker!
Oh wow it's kipkay...cool
The sonic mezurement iz the laser mezurement. The laser is just a laser pointer
Sonic sound measuring is a real thing thoe.
Magna vision would probably make a great fire starter. You should have tried it.
I did not think Kipkay would enjoy that genre of music! Mind blown LOL
Your back :D
whoa a kipkay video! btw i do think that measure king is using sonic measurement in the form of ultrasound. really cheap so why not? bit inaccurate mayby
That's the kipkay I was looking for! I'm glad your back.
you are back :D
Keep em coming kip Kay love the content
As seen on tv is all junk, don't believe what you see on tv. Its all about the money
I would rather strap my Flip4 to my Keychain than that little chinesium monstrosity of Money waste.
Why does it feel your videos are from a decade ago? ??
I can guarantee that the "Measure King" have "sonic measurement", it measures length with ultrasonic pulses (like bats do). It does NOT measure with the laser, the laser is only an aide to aim it to the surface you want to measure distance to. Depending on your hearing you should be able to either hear or at least record the chirps it makes when measuring.
I have a tesla lighter like that, just looking like a smaller zippo :) I love it, 6packs of ciggys for a 1 hour charge :)
I missed you Kipkay!!! I watched you soooo much as a kid :D And is till love your voice!
Been a long time no see, glad you're back.
That Tac-Lighter looks crazy handy. Seems like it should be mandatory in survival kits. :D
Omg, tacklighter lights by plasma, that's really cool!!
Damn, its been a minute kay, how are you?
Hey kipkay, when was the last time you washed your extension cords from all that dirt? :) LOL
You get a big fat stinker for lack of activity Kipstar!! ??
You have to finish your education... read about Doppler effect and radars. You could just search the Ebay and find a million arduino modules that measure distance using ultrasonic method. Don’t show yourself as a fool and don’t tell unsupported lies to your subscribers!!!
For the measure king tool when you mentioned sonic measurement I don't think it means it measures length but sound in decibels
That magnifier thing... should just use as a mini solar concentrator instead. Maybe boil water with it?
Who picked up some subtle dirty jokes
The measure king laser is just as a guide. It probably uses SODAR to get the distance
I though it was Household Hacker until the video start...
Lol I miss when you were relevant
And you put Taras Kul into the tags. What a scumbag
The lord had returned?
YAAAAY
????
Kipkay may I ask where you got the name for your dog? My guess is Derek Jeter. I'd get the magnavision and use it to burn stuff like in your solar death ray video you made. It's just a fresnel lens. I have a bunch of those little Boom cube speakers, one I carry on me and a few more are kicking around some taken apart for the amp or batteries. Would like to find more of these. I have the Measure king and I like it a lot. The so called sonic sound from the sonic measurer is real, I have a similar device by Ryobi and I CAN hear the noise it makes it's a soft clicking sound. I have a bunch of the Tac arc lighters, I plan to either make a bug zapper racket from hell or a lantern with the HV boost circuit in these lighters so that's why I bought a bunch of them. As always Kip thanks for the videos and inspiring me to do my own projects. And welcome back we missed you.
Kipkay, Please do everyone a favor and go back into hiding.....thanks.
Thank You for the stinker warnings !
I have 2/5 products that are similar. The TV antenna and the lighter.
Nice Household Hacker ripoff lol
I think the Measure King might actually have sonic measurement. It would seem the laser is just for targeting the area the sonic transducer is pointed toward. It's basically the same as a backup sensor on a car which would be much cheaper than trying to measure optically with the laser.
most of the OTA antennas are directional. This means you need to place them facing the direction of the signal to get the best result, Check the HD antenna websites for broadcaster locations in your area to get the proper angle. Even a few degrees can make a big difference.
Omg??
I'm disappointed you use a iPhone ??
So, KipKay is alive. Ahh the early days of YouTube..
Wait the boom tube is not bluetooth compatible?
That Measure king thingy. Sonic measurement is Cheaper, and so its more Common. The laser is there to trick some people into thinking that this is a better Laser Measuring System. It uses some sort of ultrasound (I think.)
The Freakin' Reviews Channel Compared the Measure King against real measuring tapes and found that it was very inaccurate and inconsistent. Just because the devise gives you a readout, doesn't make it accurate. You should go a little more in-depth before giving it the ole thumbs up there Kipkay. ??
These videos are so much more entertaining if you pretend Kermit the frog is talking.
The Daddy of youtube DIY is back!
How did this guy get 2.6m subs?
sonic because look up sonic proximity sensors and etc, there is a way to measure distance with sound, that's what sonar is for. Edit: happy to see you are back and doing videos.
The laser is the sonic measurement.... how else do you think it's measuring distance? With the laser? LOL
Great Video!
Oh my good Lord it's kip
My boy!
sonic cause the laser is just pointing but it's some ultrasonic sounds to measure no ?
Regarding the claim of sonic distance measurement, they mean ultrasonic. You used to do all the arduino kits, you know this KipKay. The laser is just for alignment.
Hey your back! I always dig the videos!
omg thought he passed away.
Nice
Awesome work!
Early grate work as always
Tried so hard to hit that 10 min xD
Early grate work as always
.
37th
I doubt kipkay will heart this comment and reply to it
33th
Hi kipkay
Did you take this from household hacker or did you so happen to have the same idea? Though household hacker might also have gotten it from someone else.
Hi , Where were you at????? Miss your vidsss
1:30 That face made me laugh
Hey kipkay, I've been watching you for 8 years, and the content never gets old
Kipkay inventions are the must be seen on TV
One of the original DIY on youtube
k-kipkay? could this be real? he's alive?
7th
I'm a utuber n a big fan
Notification Gang!
2nd!
Do one for halloween
EARLY BOI !!!
Never clicked so fast
See you next christmas
Yes you upload
long time no see!!
Hi
I hope you enjoyed this As Seen On TV TESTED video. If you liked it, let me know and I will make more! - Check out my series of Gizmos 'N Gags videos too. bit.ly/GizmosNGags Thanks for watching! ??
The Hue 2 ambient and Hue underglow kits are beautiful. Definitely glad I checked this channel out, wouldn’t have seen some of these products if I hadn’t.
Avoid those Audio Technia headphones, they are made cheap as fuck. I had them for like 2 weeks before the plastic pieces started to break, and I'm not rough on my headphones. If you want a quality headset go and buy a pair of HyperX Cloud II's
Gimme dat stream deck mini pweez I would really love it
Very blue setup and shirt lol
What game is he playing when he is talking about the light strip?
Hue2 looks great
Why do you pronounce GIF like that?
The Yeti Nano Is So Cool I Would Love That Lucky
The nano sounded ok, but for $100 bucks there are probably some better pics out there. I advise anyone interested head over to a channel like podcastage that do dedicated mic reviews. You'd be surprised how cheap it can be to nab a good sounding mic. However, they aren't always USB mics, which means you may need a day of some sort to get them hooked up to your PC.
Damn that mic is want I need
Can anyone tell me what his mouse is? I know its custom painted, but what is the model? The mouse on timestamp 4:36
The Yeti Nano Mic is absolutely beautiful. The compact size and incredible performance are exactly what most streamers or content creators want and need.
What is your monitor?
Love the mic prolly gonna get it good vid homie
I love the stream deck so muccccchhhhhh!
That blue yeti sounds almost like your mic that you use
I really like the stream deck! I'm a new streamer, and will be upgrading my PC soon, and this seems like it would make streaming a heck of a lot easier
Hello Frank how long have you been wareing glasses an also how do the open cup headphones feel with glasses cheers for the video ????
Totally the Omni Surround AMP/DAC. I've been a sucker for those things from the beginning. Just couldn't afford it.(yes I'm poor. Student live you know)
Idk how I missed this vid but I’m back for it ??
I love that Stream Deck mini. I could really use something like that. I'm planning on starting out here on the Youtubes myself and I love this channel because I keep seeing tech that I don't have that could already make my life easier
Wow that blue mic is a must have
What game is he playing?
5:25 that run and gun hurts my eyes lol You're better than that!
Is the ad700x good for small heads? Please notice mee
Hi, this channel I believe covered once a cellphone accessory that you would put on the back and it would stick on most flat surfaces, but my Google fu hasn’t helped me. Does anyone know what it’s called?
Useless shit really. Except the blue yeti and headphones.
Aaaaaaaaa the best product!!!!! #hue2ambient
Loved this channel bout a year ago. Glad to see it pop up back in my feed!
Really love the stream deck but it kinda expensive for editor Been using razer keypad but couldnt remember the key on it Streamdeck is a blast with those mini display really love them
Are there any products similar to the HUE out there? which will do the lighting that goes with getting the hit markers and such? that HUE 2 is getting really bad wrap online with your HDD
After just starting to learn audio production it’s cool to see a well known mic that is cardioid as well as omnidirectional. Pretty cool tech
could you use the sound blaster for console
I love the NZXT hue 2 Ambient, I feel it is kind of targeted to the specific usage which is quite concise.
Should I get the HyperX Cloud II or the Sennheiser GSP 300?
Hey Frank! Do you have a suggestion for a pair of over ear headphones that won't create pain due to glasses? I really want over ears, but all that I've tried squished my ears to much, and now I'm basically stuck with in ear.
Hue 2 ftw!!
Yo
Hey are you doing a giveaway this month, if so I would like the headphones. The reason I would like these because I want to try to get back into gaming and I only have a 17$ headset
Who else thought that the first part was a sponser
Those headphones look amazing! safe for ears too compared to the in-ears that I have now, look very comfortable and AT is known for great sound quality^^
got that omni surround amp, and its actually really good.
How do you live with yourself? Every one of your subscribers is broke because of you.
So cool!!
Hey Frank. My monitor only has one HDMI, and I have a PS4 and a Nintendo Switch. I don't like having to unplug HDMI from one to the other when i want to play one. Is there anything i could buy to fix this issue? I was thinking something i have both plugged into, and i could switch between the two. Thanks in advanced.
Can I use the stream deck with my PS4?
A smaller Yeti model??? Thank you for showing me this. I have been wanting to get the regular Yeti but I felt like it was way too big. As long as the nano has the same recording quality, I will probably pic that up when I have the extra cash.
Clint from LGR also reviewed these for anyone who could care
I love these types of videos because I’m constantly having issues finding gifts for people under a certain price point. It’s so hard finding gifts for guys (in my opinion). This makes my task 100x easier.
£35 for underglow lights? I just bought 5 meter led strip and molex connecter to do the underglow effect cost me £4 ????
Just realized I've been watching one of your videos a day, not on purpose. Fine, I'll subscribe.
Which mouse do you think is the best for a budget gamer?
omni amp is a big no go fyi, the quality is great but the mic will randomly disable and not pick up your voice... so you have to go into your input audio settings and re-enable to get it to start working... can be frustrating at times cause it will just happen out of no where and ill be talking to my friends not realizing my mic isnt working.
That backlight kit is not getting good reviews and has comments on the website they it thrashes the hard drive constantly and will not work when playing certain games tested or won't run at all on full screen mode.
My wallet hates this channel I bought every product on this list ffs I’ve also bought like every product on every other one of these videos ??
Does anyone knows if the "Omni Surround AMP/DAC" improves mic quality? Logitech has a very good DAC/AMP (headphone wise) but does a terrible job on the mic side.
I love that they downsized the yeti, makes it so much better than having a massive mic sitting in front of you.
I love your vids man. I would really like to get the stream deck. It would be a perfect gift. But the bleu mic would awesome as well. Keep it!
you shaved your hair :D
Ur beautiful if your reading this
hmmm...
Hey, was wondering what brand ur little white alarm clock is?
I would like to have the mic, because i game with friends and i need a better mic and i want to make some music, a good mic would be useful
0:53 Trust me, you don't want to be in the middle of the battlefield!
Don't buy the Yeti mic, buy blue snowball ice. It is just as good and much cheaper. Also sounds better imo.
Love the shirt lol
This guy looks like a Breton from the Elder Scrolls
Does it have a optical cable for the audio dac?
I’m definitely getting that yeti nano looks awesome
Yo I couldn’t tell which mic was mic when you tested your camera mic and the yeti
shit your eyes looks cool
i need that mic ??
question about those headphones for anyone who has them or knows about that style, would the "open back" help stop my ears from getting so hot? i know that sounds like a daft question, but i had to stop wearing my cloud x 2's as after just a few mins of playing it felt like my ears and the whole area the headphone sat on was boiling hot. Also it's so fucking annoying when i hear they're "only $75" so i think "oh that should be pretty cheap in £'s then" only to look at them on amazon uk and find they're not $75 converted to £, they're in fact £96
AD500X I really love your vids keep up the good work and i wanted it cause I don't have good headphones
So cool tech this month is just for pc users or what?
Bought the DAC after this video and has fixed the RealTek HD audio problems I've been having since creators update. My edifiers sound better than ever! Thanks Frank!
instead of stream deck mini, you can use an app called deckboard (app on your phone, old 1, since most of us got atleast 1 old smart phone we done use) and if you want it bigger, get a cheap android tabled to 30usd, and a stand, for cheaper.
The Audio-Technica are amazing!
You should try the Status Audio headphones
Christmas is to far away
Ive been using the AD500X for over a year now. Excellent sound quality and creates great sound presence with music.
This is perfect just I just started doing streaming
Congratulations Elgato. Seeing you sell a mini version made me buy the regular version. My hopes of them just selling too much and it getting over saturated went downhill fast lol.
Who else couldnt afford a single thing off of this list lol
I thought I’d shine some light on the Sound Blaster Omni. The microphones on there are more meant for making your current mic setup sound better. The Omni has a few mic features for focusing its sound, and reducing noise and it does help a lot. I sit right next to my AC and when it’s running you can’t even hear it when I’m talking on discord thanks to this feature.
Superlux HD681 are a better choice instead of the ATH AD500 for sound stage quality and treble balance. And much cheaper too
Do a monthly top PS4 tech under $100
Not enough spook 2/10
You should do a, perhaps one-off, alternative of this series called cool tech under a million dollars. Obviously not buying it but examining a few very, very expensive examples of really cool tech that could rival what you usually have in these videos.
Love the mic
I’m not the biggest fan of nzxt hue, I have some fans and the CAM software interferes with some other games causing it to crash, just a heads up. Maybe they’ve gotten better but it was a pain for me a few months ago. Can you make a video for some tv accessories? I was wondering if there’s any great gear for switching inputs to the tv that work well and look cool. Thanks!
I love those AD500X! I was actually looking to get a new pair off headphones, would be nice if i won
Then Soundblaster Omni is really good, Iv had mine for 4 years.
Just a PSA for the first 2 items... The headset has a bunch of static and it's cord is such a low quality.. and the blue yeti nano basically requires you to spend another $100 if you want to use it properly.. I suggest buying the YETICASTER from blues website.. A guy who bought the first 2 items after watching this video and is now refunding them
His eyes ;-; i want em
the sub-surface scattering is turned up to high.
Take a shot whenever he says open back
People need to stop buying these shitty dacs and usb/1/8th inch mics and just get an audio interface. It's so much better for around the same price. Get an xlr microphone like the big boys use and plug your headphones into the audio interface. Stop focusing on the gimmicky gamer focused DACs
THATS A SEXY BLUE SHURT MATE
About the Sound Blaster Omni card. I have been using it for a year and a half now. It replaced my previous sound card, Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro as the main drive, although I still use it for sound input for Discord, Skype and TS on my main mixer board when I am streaming or recording. But anyway, back on the Omni now. It is an amazing piece of tech and it is highly recommended. While I mainly use the RCA connections to send the signal to my mixer board, when I am traveling I use it to drive my AKG K 240 Mk2 and it drives it like a champ! I even tried some other studio monitors (can not remember the models) by Sennheiser and Audio Technica that a friend of mine owns, and it still could drive them with ease. On the plus is the RCA output in the back, the optical out in the back as well, and something that was not mentioned: it has a remote control that you can use to control the sound, but also using the arrows you an move your mouse cursor on your screen(s). You guys should try it, you won't regret it. ~Valk.
What shooting game was that?
What shooting game was that?
dOnT yOu MeAn SpOoKtObEr
Just purchased the 900x Excited to finally try them out!
What was that product that you reviewed a while ago where it's RGB lights you can put on the back that syncs with games not this one there was another one. Anyone help?
He said gif and not jif. Unsubscribe....
Why do you always end your sentences as if you're going to continue a run on? Just end your sentences with a period... You end them with commas.
That stream deck would be so convinient because it would ve so easy to manage all your stream settings etc... i wish i had money lol
hey wassup guys, its randomfrankp I have that stuck in my head
Sir Frank, can you send me the Audio Technica??? I want them to game with... Okay, thanks ????
What camera are you using?
So close to 1.000.000
I really want that NZXT Hue 2 Ambient glow thingy for my setup
He's hot ?? ?? ?? ?? ??
good video but i still think the mini stream deck is a joke the og stream deck gives you 15 buttons for 150 bucks its a way better deal
Hue2 is just a worse version of ambilight. Møre expensive too.
what would you recommend headphone wise: corsair hs50 or AD500X. I would be using them for a bit of music listening and gaming.
I would like to let anyone know who is looking to buy the Audio technica open back headphones they are amazing *But if you have a small head you may experience some discomfort by the headphone pad hanging somewhat on the top of your ear but this can be fixed by just having a hairband in between the two headpads @Pros Great sound stage Good bass Highs and lows are balance Comfortable Pads are easy to clean @Cons For long play sessions pads may get sweaty Noises in environment you will still hear Pads are prone to catch dandruff if you have a lot of dandruff If you have a cardiod mic or a mod mic audio may be picked up by the mic if audio is loud ***I have been using these headphones both the 700 and 1000X for 1 year now and love them very great for the price
I would love the headphones because I want to increase my gaming experience but dont have the money to do so
So tired of the tiktok ads ??
I LOVE the steam deck but haven't had the cash to upgrade my setup recently. The stream deck is awesome because I edit videos as a hobby as well as play some games that it would really help with.
Yeti nano mic was my fav
That Yeti nano is perfect for me as i have a small desk and my mic right now is some cheap £10 one. Shame I can’t afford it!
Streaming stuff really helps me, thx
Can you make a video on your pc?
The Hugh Too.
I had the same CPU cooler he has it leaked
Hey Random FP Been watching this channel for a while now and have to say the content is dope. Personally for me I love the hue2 and think it would take my pc setup to the next level. Peace.
Be very, and I can't stress this enough, WEARY when you hear reviewers/unboxers throw out the word "Audiophile" go to channels which specialize to that kind of gear or risk buying duds and end up costing you more money...
i have that amp and its shit on win10 some times i need to reintall it orr take usb kabel out 2 times before i here eny sound
Can you use the yeti as a mic for fortnite or not
that hue2 would be awesome, i think i might buy it on black friday
Omni Surround Amp/dac because I have always wanted something like this
What monitor is that?
Wel ok but What About Most Useful tech under price point because this it idk
I've been using the soundblaster omni for a few years. Best purchase I've made. Even used the decent built in mic for a while. But it works amazing as a DAC.
Cool PC tech under a 100 dollars
Good vid but idea stolen from LTT big time
His eyes are memerizing..
I hate you. So earnest and slow and deliberate. Tool
Does he use a green screen
I love thos AD500X. I've been eyeing them for a bit haha. Great video, Frank.
Btw the company is called creative, not sound blaster, sound blaster is the product line
i love the stream deck I think that would be a great addition to my twitch channel and really help make streaming go a lot smoother.
Hue2? I love that band!
I want that Hue 2 ive really needed some more colour for my setup lol
I love the stream deck because it has support for a lot ot things
Please turn the audio in the background up, its too quiet to hear unless i have the volume all the way up and it just sounds like two balloons rubbing together...
5:32 monitor please
OMG THAT MICROPHONE IS SO NICCCE
"Typically with open-back headphones you tend to lose a lot of the bass and some of the higher end frequencies just because audio is being dispersed outward" lolwut. Not sure if you understand how open-backs work there buddy. Frank, love your videos, but you need to listen to some more phones. I'll let you start from Audeze LCD-2's for what planar bass sounds like and AD-2000x's (big brother version of the AD500x you're showcased) for what clarity in higher frequencies sound like.
I'd have to say my favorite product in this video is a tie between the Yeti Nano mic and The NZXT Hue 2 lighting. Both are things I need for my setup! Once I'm no longer a broke college kid maybe I'll be able to upgrade to some good gear haha
Oh I'd really like the elgato mini! SO COOL!
Will all the episodes from now on be under $100 or back to $50?
Which were the winners for last month?
Damn, the blue yeti nano would go so well with my setup! Looks like a real good mic
do the ad500x work with glasses I have this problem with my headphones
What's the monitor where he's showcasing nzxt hue2
What is that monitor?
I'm loving the Omni Sound AMP/DAC. I have my setup in my bedroom and when it gets late it's annoying to have to exit out of full screen for a game and change audio to my headphones. I feel like this is a simple but nice solution.
Everytime I see one of these episodes it costs me money. This time, looks like it cost me a Yeti Nano...and yes, I'm blaming you randomfrankp. Lol.
Next episode cool tech under $900
Ad500x is my fav nice review btw
hey randomfrankp, I'm just wondering and these questions may be very personal, what's your occupation? What's your profession? How'd you climb all your way to get a great gaming rig? It's like I wanna be like you or at least near close as you. if you want your answer to be private here is my email: emman.cardano@gmail.com
8:15 Please dont bite your nails :(
What kind of desk do you have and where can I buy one of those?
Is it possible to turn optical audio into digital audio with that omni thing?
0:57 Does that mean if im talking to friends on discord while gaming using a desktop mic, are they gonna hear my Audio? (I do tend to turn my volume up pretty high)
Would really like to know where you got your desk
Openback headphones, great for everything except porn and that's a deal breaker for me
Buy a 400 dac/amp to hear some kid yell about how he banged your mom. Lol
Thank you I’m buying the mic and the open back head phones
I think that I like the mic the best because it’s a nice little mic for pretty darn cheep and I need a mic
Less than 30$ please
Im going to by all of the audio stuff
i was looking for a new mic and the yeti nano seems perfect
That color thing for in games is really cool, although nothing new. I've seen fan setups that blow air at you based on in game conditions. But hardly any games support it unfortunately. Far Cry is the only one I can think of.
Did he announce last months giveaway winners? Is it on Twitter?
the nano mic looks so cute
Audio is all of for me
I keep wondering, where did you get your desk?
What game is that? 5:39
I like under 100.
4:55 nice ghost cube there
mmmh probably going to buy the Omni Surround ^^
Hey Frank, gotta say this new camera is looking ??
When you use the Blue Yeti you sound great, but I ordered one and people tell me it sounds awful. Ive got the same position as you in the video and Ive tried both settings with no luck.
I would have to say that the yeti nano mic is probably my favorite product because it’s a pretty good desk microphone. It sounds pretty good and will fit in right with my setup ( which currently is pretty crappy). Plus I already bought a wireless headset that doesn’t have a mic so I could really use one of those.
Audio-Technica makes some insane products! Great video
I liked the omni surrond dac
What game is that??
What game was that he was playing when showing off the led on the back of pc
How big is your desk? I might try to make ut
I've been eyeing those AD500s hahaha. Good thing you just so happened to include them in your new list lol
I say my favorite is the stream deck mini. I wanna get one, but by being a smaller streamer idk if it’s worth the investment at this time.
I would like to give a little idea for saying the prices: Why not have a little thing somewhere on the screen, showing the prices for different currency's? Like the main 3 would be US, Canada and Australia, you obviously would mean under 100 in US, but it would help people to just have a quick glance on what they're interested and how much it would be for them.
For under $100 the yeti nano sounds amazing
I don't think that headset should be considered as a "cool tech"
I wonder if i can use the sound blaster on my ps4 or xbox.
wow that amp and dac looks sexy...i need one
make more animtion it will make the videos nicer to look
That amp and dac looks sweet! I've been looking for an amp for my desktop under $100 for a while now and that fits the bill nicely... besides the black and red color scheme. But other than that, it's pretty cool!
Frank: "it doesn't lose any functionality!" Yeti nano: doesn't have two other pattern settings and gain control
I am gonna say one thing first time in my whole life i have seen some doing a genuine review "cool tech UNDER $100" need to hats off
doesnt Tim use the AD500Xs?
The microphone looks so nice, i would really like to have one of those specially now that my old one died...
The Hue 2 would be great for my setup!
Frank ur mom gey
October just started how are you making this video rn?
Hey what’s that desktop background?
It makes you feeeeeellll like your spider man
Your monitors slanting to the left
Lookin fresh af with that shirt frank!
best £20 mic? usb
that Yeti Nano would cost 200$ in my country too bad
2:59 love it ??????????
Humm, this items are not for me
which game was he playing ??
Yeet
Can u do a under 25$ episode im fking broke
Those ADX 5000 headphones look so good. I use some cheap self proclaimed "gaming headphones" where the Adio quality is not good and the mic is only just acceptable.
Audio technica at2020 usb is the better microphone let’s be honest here ??
Stream deck mini still overpriced
Been sub'd for years and always loving the content you're putting out. One thing I'd like to see from tech YouTuber's when it comes to these "Tech under $XX" videos are product/profession themes. E.g., "Cool Tech for Streamers under $100", "Cool Tech for Music Production under $100", "Cool Tech for Designers under $100" or the like. While I love these videos, having more context and thus being able to view videos that are more relevant to a particular base of users might lead to better affiliate sales and more views.
Pretty cool seeing your channel grow over the past 4 years.
Go back to 50
Fabulous list of products, aside from the RGB thing... I'm beginning to hate RGB. But hey, it's Christmas, why not make your PC look like a Christmas Tree? Now, what's up with YouTube? For my next suggestions, I have "Never Talk To The Police" followed by "My New Massive Termite Farm"???? Anyone? I'm in the process of assembling 4 new PCs and have only looked at tech video on YouTube for the last week and a half, where do these suggestions come from? Anyway, fabulous products, and a fabulous channel, Cheers. PC: Assembling PCs is so easy, finding the right peripherals is the hard part. Why can't one single company just get peripherals right? How hard can it be?
nice video
I want all of those things in 100$
100 dollars for some christmas lights?
amazing vid as always ??
Man, I tried the AD700x's and...I really thought they were shit. like, super muddled sound. cant imagine the 500x is better
Lets sub to sub. Thanks!
Just buy a samson meteor mic if you're interrested in the yeti nano, the meteor mic is just as good with half the price. Just check some review of it and you'll understand
That mic is dope definitely getting it
Hey RandomfrankP! I really like the Mic because it’s really small and it some big boom arm that’s 200$
I thought I was early...
cool tech "under 100$" the mic is 99$ lmao
I can still hear the keyboard on the mic test on both setting without any redaction in keyboard noise.
Do 25$ ones
No I can't watch this video. All my money is bring saved for building my PC this gay ass laptop don't cut it
so close to a million subs!
Does anyone know where he got skins for his mouse?
I have the drevo gramr as my keyboard and I think you should review them
Cool shirt man
I tried the omni little amp had a decent amount of hiss so I returned it
Stream deck, I need some inspiration to start streaming
i like that they made the yeti smaller tbh i like that more than any others and also what is that lighting effect 7:55
Just bought the headphones and microphone! Now I have nothing left in my paypal.. really hope this is some good stuff!
That stream deck would be soooo cool!
Are the AD500X headphones the same as ATH adg1x without the mic?
For being 3 to 4 minutes a product, the reviews are surprisingly thorough, but sometimes the product is not done justice. That's okay tho
Damn that streamdeck is certainly something I need to get ????
The new desktop blue yeti mic is amazing!! Blue never seem to fail to surprise there audience. I want one!!??
4:10 the Best gadject
now I feel like im a dumbo that i plug my audio jack into the motherboard. The Amp would be so cool
Cool
Keep up the great work, better reason to save money, Sound Blaster will be my next purchase
That stream deck looks so handy. As a new streamer, I'm definitely considering getting one as I love the interaction with the viewers.
No imagination, minimum effort.
Really adding that headphones to my cart!
I have a question that if anyone can answer plz let me know. If I use a microphone that plugs in to a USB Port how can I use an AMP/DAC?
I'm a fan as well of openback headphones but what I need is that amp dac since I still use my motherboard onboard solution so I choose the Soundblaster this time. Still those are great stuff, runner up for me would be the ATH AD500X then the Hue 2 Ambient.
ad500x or dt990 pro?
Also why pay that much money on basically an rgb strip...connect a arduino with an esp8266 to it and you got the same thing for a fraction of the prtice plus total control... Rhe only maybe usefull thing in this video is the sound blaster controller...whitch you can easily replace withj a tablet with the unified remote full app on it
Audiotehnica right now is just shit with what it was...lets make some headphoines and pu a lot of bullshit text in in and everyone will love...its the same thing with gaming as it is with audiophile... you have to see the bullshit...and this one has a lot of bullshit for what price it has...
"Make sound 10 times better" 0x10 is still 0 What's the point????
Very interested in the Omni sound blaster. I listen to music on my pc all day and can use a boost above the stock sound card
I want the blue Yeetie
This channel has infinitely increased my Amazon wishlist size.
Numerous people have asked but no answers yet.....what FPS game was that being played?
Realy like the Yeti Nano, the hidden mic on my headset just don't cut it.
Who would buy a stream deck mini, it's like $15 or $16 per key, the normal one is about $10 per key
If you're looking for sound quality, DON'T go for the soundblaster amp. Get a proper audio interface.
Wish it wasn’t all gaming related
I love your channel but most of the stuff you recommend do not ship to my country. I like those audio technica headphones; I’m a bit of an audiophile so open back is just the way to go. It would be awesome to have one of those for my birthday.
5:38 do anyone know what is that game name please ?
Second I started watching this video I was like - he looks good in that shirt lol
I'd go with a Audio-Technica AT2020 as a streaming mic
The stream deck mini is my fav! It's functionality is so useful, not necessarily for just streamers but in general, it's like a quick task menu for easy access to all your favorite apps! Plus the gifs look cool just on the displays haha
Dude I’m in love with the yeti mic I’ve bean beading a mic for my gaming channel I’ve bean using a Walmart pair of ear buds that have a mic so a upgrade would be lit
When are you gonna do the next unpacked
Diggin' the shirt.
Kinda feel like ur getting younger every video ??
AD 500X is great, after using it for 2 years, these are my thoughts; 3D wings are too wide and they slide off your head if you have a thinner head or just simply not a huge head. You do lose bass, don't give it too much praise, but it's extremely detailed all round still which is great. They are super light and you don't feel them until they slide, then the weight is on your ears (to solve it just use a rubber band between the wings) and in games directional sound isn't great, it doesn't have virtual crap, but due to that it's not always accurate since it's just a natural sound. The cable is super long which is great and doesn't tangle super easily. The soundstage is great (obviously, it's open back) but it's very atmospheric in music and single player games. But for the price the headphones are amazing, I'll give them that, that's why I still use them.
I'm broke and still keep watching these videos
Loving the headphones! Love their design with no headband.
Omni surround looks awesomeeee. Just like your video??
Can you do one that’s 10$ with free shipping fam
Looking so damn good frank
If you give the stream deck mini away I want toen have it. I stream on stani games (SG)
About that amp/dac combo does it play stereo sound or is it only 5.1 also how would you switch between speakers/ headset Is there a button on it or just your windows audio switcher ?
Only frank can literally sell me headphones with his pitch 10 minutes after I buy HS60. Also what is better, these headphones at the start or the Corsair HS60?
I love these ssssoooooo mucccchhh
What happened to the give away
How does the AD500x compare to the SHP9500?
I love that stream deck. That’s an awesome idea. If you’re giving any away I love to get my hands on one. Thanks for these videos man! I always learn about new products through these vids
Thank you, keep going and uploading, love ya ??
Blue Yeti mini mic! I am starting to make custom music, and only have the built in mic for an input. It would be a great boost Luv ur channel! Can’t wait for another episode!
Love that Elgato Mini Streamdeck. I could see that helping with shortcuts in Photoshop and Illustrator.
336 TH XD
Where did you get that tabletop? That looks amazing.
I LOVE those headphones and would love to get them.but I'm broke. <3
Could you review the logitech g pro wireless?
damn for around $200 I could have a mic, headphone, and DAC.
I perfer the original cool tech under $50, as for the price point under $100, these gadgets are just everywhere and I do not need to watch it here.
My favorite products in this video are the Blue Yeti Nano Mic, and the Mini Stream Deck.
What happened to the Fiio E10-K
There needs to be an amp like that that works with PS4 in that price range, if there is one let me know! Good video
Dude those headphones are sick I have been searching for so long now thank you
Greate video
What do I do if I'm playing xbox and i have a separate mic to my head set but my adapter only has one hole?
why u raise the price again
The underglow is so badass!
NZXT HUE 2 Ambient Please
I really needed new headphones,you just saved me
This is perfect my birthday is coming up this month
Would you tell me where you got your desk? It's so nice
At first I saw $10...
My local Walmart sells the blue yeti for $115. The blue yeti nano is not a very good deal yet imo
U play csgo? What's ur rank?
Part2!!!
i need that sound blaster :P
Can you try to do this like 2 times a week?
Thank you ??
Doesn't Timthetatman use those Headphones?
Rarely nobody discourse obvot assist search beyond loud quality fortune belt.
ive always wanted a mic but dont have the money...the blue yeti nano looks pretty nice :)
Where did u get ur shirt from?
It's been so long since I saw this series I forgot it even exvisted
Nice video pleas make a video on an 2500 dollar setup and desk. PS. pleas subscribe
October. 2 was my birthday so can i get 3 likes please.
yo Frank i got the Astro a10s a couple months ago, but i noticed where the head strap that goes over my head, there is a slight bald spot i never had before. is there any quality lightweight headsets with a lot of padding? or is there any good earbuds for gaming? im like 98% sure the small bald spot is from the weight and lack of padding on the a10s that caused it.
I loved the estatic RGB kit and would love to own it t
Can some of these gadgets be used to make spooky memes for sPoOkToBeR?!
Vers nice Tech ????
oooo thinking about getting that HUE 2 from NZXT
??!??! Some of the best top tech under a certain $ that I have seen. Good job.
Nice, might go with one of these for my birthday today !
Your shirt matches your wallpaper.
140€ for those headphones in my country rip??
I love the microphone but as yousual it is to expensive but thx anyway Love the videos
I'm stilling using hyperx clouds after like 3 and half years ?? once these break I will invest into studio type headphones
What game was being played??
My favorite would probably be the Yeti Nano. Great price and sound quality! Might pick one up sometime soon (:
I wish you would... Do more instersting stuff not just headphones
Favourite product: The Creative Sound Blaster, because it supports Dolby Digital Live! This means it can convey 5.1 gaming audio via a single optical cable.
I need the sound blaster
Love your work man could I win the hue 2 ambient
dose anyone know his email
Random Frank Pee
What FPS game was he playing?
Can you plug in a usb mic into the Sound Blaster to improve the audio?
How hasn’t this channel reached 1 million subs yet???
I like this series because it focuses on a lower pricetag. Many tech youtuber present some ridiculously overpriced hardware that no normal person without 10 sponsors could afford. But I am broke 24/7 so I still can't afford the stuff you presented here.
223th
ima need you to floor this series more cuz i just got my job going im buying hella gadgets n tech stuff
I wouldn't use that sounblaster thing lol. Unless you have a really shitty motherboard, your built in sound is already pretty good. I feel the same way about soundcards lol. Like unless you're doing hard audio editing then you really don't need anything more than the stock sound
Finaly
Can u do a ath-ad 700x please
Favourite product has to be the stream deck mini. So practical and so useful for streaming. But i find around $100 to be a bit hard to justify personally
youre a legend. i was looking for a video like this and right when i startet searching you uploaded this haha
Can we still win the stuff cos if so im glaring at that Blue Yeti
3:05 WHO ELSE NOTICED THE BLACKWIDOW ELITE BABBYYYYY??????
Hmmmmmmm where's the notification squad ?
Can u use tht mic on a ps4?
Is there a closed back version of those headphones?
If I want to buy the amp for the headphones, what do I do if my motherboard doesn't have a optical port?
why are you dying your hair now?
There better be a lämp
Don't even have a pc why am I here Good content tho
I like the headphones the best because open backs really do improve your listening experience in gaming. Ha lol says me when all I have is headphones made for taking calls
Just get the big StreamDeck, the Mini One is badly priced.
I never use anything YOUTUBERS “RECOMMEND” ath m50x sucked cable rubbed my shoulder and they were so bad I gave them away
Something about you Frank, just makes me so happy.
best series on this planet.
game name?
What is your work place? I mean ur buying stuff that costs alot... How ?!
Is something different? Is there new lighting? Is there a new video layout? Its looks AWESOME :)))
Men those headphones cost almost 3 times more in Spain. Insane
A few months ago he showed off an amp/dac for under $50. So I want to know if this one is way better or a small difference. Does anyone know?
The ambient monitor lighting can also reflect what is being displayed on the monitor, really the best use of it imo
Rd to 1000000 LETS GOOOOO
When I play games I usually pull my headphones slightly off my ear. There is something about the way it sounds when I talk, I don't like. Would the open back help with that?
it's the same kind of products every time.
I wish i can afford these
awesome
Next video: cool tech under 1000$
What’s up guys it’s randfrankp
I've got a love hate realatinship with this channel. It's forever leaving me broke
Stop dying your hair and just be Natrual Red Head! Dude you're already married and we love your personality and content. You no longer need to be self conscious. Be Confident!
I feel like you should've added a Logitech G810 keyboard.
How does the soundblaster card compare to an asus z370 motherboard for example?
You Post, I Click. Simple.
I have the audio technica headphones, they are awesome. I’ve worn them for hours at a time with no discomfort
Are we with PCs now like we were in the 2000s with the cars form fast and furious? :)))))) Can't wait to see everyone hating rgb in a couple years :)))
Such an underated channel
I didn't notice a different between his microphone and the blue nano or whatever it is.
I want 4 price points a month 1) $25.00 (even if it’s just cable management & decor) 2) $50.00 3) $75.00 4)$100.00
This guy deserves more subscribers????..... Your videos are awesome Frank.... You will have 1 million subs in no time!!
You should review the Audeze Mobius Frank
Anyone know what game he was playing?
I have been using the SoundBlaster for years and I can say it is a damn miracle what it can do for PC audio.....I absolutely endorse it
Awesome video, but removing a 0 from $100 would make it even more awesome!
Great Video!
Oh there's the guy that wants to make me broke again! :D
may I know what type of blue mic?
can you use the Omni Surround amp/dac to get 7.1 surround?
Those is great but some of it I cannot afford so pls give me some products):
Is that headset 7.1 ?
frank is a csgo BEAST
More cool tech under $1 please!!!
In 1 year: Cool tech under 1000!
So tell us Frank, what’s your opinion on open back headphones?
Appreciate the keyboard test with the Mic. Hate when there is a mic review w/o taking keyboard noise into consideration.
Idea for top tech under $100 for November, the aukey km-g3, it's a budget rgb mechanical keyboard
what did you say wearing those headphones? They sounde so muffled and all i could hear was bass
AD500X headphones ??
cheap plastic on the headset so will break in a few months or weeks
The 1 not the 3 screens
Or it’s you
Nothing else just what’s that guy in the Ved pc?
Unlimited macros programmable LCD screens with moving pictures I'm going to buy also the creative labs sound blast
who's october??
I need every single item in this list, but only have money for like 2 items :(
What’s your PC and ?
Man that Yeti microphone sounds absolutely amazing. I really need something like that for my setup, the in built microphone with my headphones are so broken that any time I activate the mic in game it distorts all the voice audio really badly to the point where I have no idea what anyone is saying for about a minute.
I don’t have a microphone yet but what are the differences between that blue yeti and the one that’s about $30 more?
Hi
Thanks a lot for this. My birthday is coming up and I didn't know what I wanted. As always an awesome video!
U r not a random pee u r my pee ????
That's hella dope stuff and now I want to throw my wallet away for those headphones because it's audio Technica
I look forward to this video every month! Those headphones look great. Love open-back headphones.
The AD500X headset is amazing, over a year in with them and zero issues. Amazing sound and comfortable!
His set up has been a lie it's been a green screen the whole time gasp
Would'nt the mic on the sound blaster used for active noise cancellation?
Bro I love your freckles
"everyone around you will know what porn you are watching"
"under $100" $99.00 + $9.99 shipping.
I’d like the mini microphone. The microphone on my desk is the only bad thing I have.
Love you frank
where do you get this gifs form u Stream Deck Mini?
I would get the Nano, but having that thing in front of me when I'm on my PC isn't attractive to me. I feel like the Blue Yeti Snowball, where it clips to the monitor, is the one that would satisfies me!
huehuehuehue 2
1:27 Ya but they sure, do mess up your hair :D
3:00 I regret buying my yeti
every time I go to your channel I feel bad cause everything you show I can't buy it... ;( 1 like = 1 item
Frank crippin’ out here
5:28 ok ok stop right there! Crappy cheep arduino light strips? Well for 25$ you can get 2m of 60leds/m ws2812b strip and than apply ambilight mode via free software that will take colors from edge of your monitors amd extend them out.. Also you can program the arduino to do all of the same effects that you can customize with nzxt strip and it can even do that cs go thing if you gonna use provided sdk and than use serial communication between app that will monitor your health and arduino sketch that will change the lights.. It's literally same if not even better the difference is that nzxt is plug and play while arduino one requires a little bit of time and skills.. It's not crappy at all.. You can check my channel if your interested in abmbi light or auduo visualizer mode that takes 10min to setUp and costs 30$ (2m of strip + proper power supply + arduino) ..
Was that crackle at 3:45 from the mic or something you touched on the desk?
my mans got a clean shave...go all out for no shave november tho XD
"If you see anything you like, i'll send it to you for free.." Wishful thinking.. haha
Your color grading effected your eyes XD
Can someone link me good led tape under 15$ I'd appreciate
I totally need a DAC.. omg ... please frank .. pay this one forward!!!
Wonder if the sound blaster card will work on a ps4
Tech youtubers are practically artist with their camera work
No i wanted under 25
I would like the stream deck becuase ir could be as a school work hub
I want that stream deck

I would love those headphones, really wanne try an openback design
Wait I assumed this was an old vid because I’ve been binge watching this series all day
Really like that shirt. And it goes well with your desktop wallpaper. Was that intentional? ??
I really need a dac
Waddduuupppppppppppppp
I like your videos randomfrankp i appreciate it thanks for your vid I will continue support you in your videos.Thanks
Mystery tech unboxing please
Ad500x or Hyperx Cloud Alpha? I already have the Alpha but I'm considering if another headphone (under 200) would be much better for positional audio. (No mic required.)
No giveaway I guess... That amp/dac is hella nice tho
Nice shirt man !
Those headphones tho. ??
Audio Technica make some awesome products. I love the headphones they make and they are always a decent price
Would love to have an AD500X as my Headphones..
he is so handsome ;D
I was waiting for this!!
I really like those nzxt monitor rgb strips because they can sinc with your games or computer

Omg that stream deck mini would really help because the game i play alot, OSU, isnt windowed, and trying to swich between chrome, osu, downloads, and twich is an absolute p a i n to do, and the stream deck mini looks like a god sent gift.
That mic is defenitly my favorite product because my mic is the one of my headset and All my friends are complaining about it :(
Gf: I love you! Me: I love hue2 I will see myself out. Great episode
Am I the only one who thinks frank really looks like bob lee swagger from shooter??
Good over ear headphones for pc? Is the Akg worth it or any other recommendations?
He should test stuff that nobody buys like really low end tech
Anyone got UK links for these?
Does anyone know the name of the lamps in his living room (the ones standing on both sides)?
never been this early :d
I'm definitely pikin' that headphone up
USB mics are really not a good choice for streaming. Most people use a second PC for streaming and you can use USB mics with only one PC at a time. Just get a cheap slr mic and amp.
How do you keep your headphones safe
Been waiting for this. ??

Hacktuber, YOU ARE SO TALENTED AND CREATIVE! You have inspired me to try and share some of my ideas with people on my YouTube channel, thank you for all your videos and time you have put into them!
wasted 1 channel audio to make a Bluetooth speaker? i don't think that was good idea.. you should buy class D 5v simple amplifier.. put them 2 speaker are more better..
hahaha.. the last mystery box was no security.. cause people will try to on all at once 1st.. useless to put fake switch but it's do nothing..
should of used a better speaker that one sucks ass
where we get bluetooth module
the first one is fake all
?????????
Why would you need a 5 volt regulator when a USB port can maximally output 5v?? That makes no sense

Bluetooth is not connected up,sucessfully
Why we didn't use direct current
Not in detail....who'll tell about programming..ur dad?
You should make that last combination lock so that the other two switches aren't useless. the way you have it if someone presses on all the switches it still goes threw but if you were to put the other switches so that they would short the circuit and have a braker throw if they mess it up and keep it locked then you can keep it so that they cant just guess it.
are you a mad??? you are saying that check the link below but where is your link???
1st model is using $2 Bluetooth, but why don't buy cheap class D amplifier as well? both using 5V input..
very nice
this americanhacker!!!!
the security lock system is very bad idea.. easily i can switch all ON... you shuld use 2 line switchs and connect all switchs..

hi i dont understand why all the switches in the electromagnet lock? at first i thought it was to make it hard to unlock but then i seen you put 3 upside down and 3 the other way so someone can simply see choose the 3 that are the same way facing the same direction and its done you unlocked it hehe.
So by adding a microphone at time =5:44 sec. The mic pick up the music and converts it into impulses?? How that that work?

You can buy premade ones on amazon https://www.amazon.com/LaBrinx-Designs-Remote-Control-Portal/dp/B074NDLSSV/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1540455389&sr=8-2&keywords=portal+mirrors
Get a companion cube prop and cut it in half, glue each half to each side. Boom.
Looks so amazing ????
I WANT THIS, but im not rich, BUT I WANT THIS
I'm totally doing this! That was so cool!!!
Cool!
Awesome love from india
I love it. LED deck lights check here:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DL8QPQL
I love it
Really dope video and easy guide to create this look; what camera do you use?
Oh my gosh that is SOOOO TRIPPY!!!
????????????
But can i portal to orgrimmar ?
hey Matt Schaefer i noticed something how would LED LIGHTS look under Glass
you can also get some wild 3D picture effects if you know how to etch glass. etch part of a picture on front of regular mirror which is at the rear of the frame and on the inside of the two way mirror that is in front and on the front of the two way mirror and you will not believe the 3D effects it gives the picture unbelievable depth. Be safe
Dude check out infinity mirrors were you pair a two way mirror with a regular one and you put led lights in the frame between them so you get a similar effect in a more compact space Be safe.
1:43 when you realized the cake is a lie
marry me??
would it be possible to do this with screens instead of mirrors, and raspberry pi with cameras, so that the "portals" actually show from behind you, like in the game? (yes, the cameras and screens would need to be 4k or something for the proper effect...)
Thank u sir..i will definitely gonna try it????
it costs around 150 dollars any way you do it retard
Price really ain't that bad if you get small cheaper mirrors
Thats so sick
me at 3:30 : Pfft, those mirrors look so out of place and awful, there's no way it- LEDs turn on I spoKE TOO SOON I SPOKE TOO SOON
aekdb
very nice
That looks awesome and cool bravo to that both portal game mirror ideas
LOOKS LIKE REAL PORTALS WOW SO COOL
"So good" ??
Really annoying that if you look through them you see the pattern of orange blue orange blue, because in game you'd onl see one colour at a time because the other colour would be opposite.
COOL DUDE - BEST WISHES TO YOU
This would be great is I wasn't a broke high school student... Plus this build is more expensive then the actual, so it kinda ruins the DIY effect for me.. Buuuuuuuuut, it looks absolutely amazing, and you did a fantastic job!
Now that’s cool
Looks so real
I love it
OMG I want to do this ^_^
I'd fuck this builder boy
A-B
Wow
_ _
Probably coulda got cheaper mirrors somewhere else.
T H E P O R T A L G A M E
but you didn't even level the mounts
Ooh backlit mirrors. /s
They're not actually Portal Mirrors...read thay carefully
#portal
Where'd you get that hourglass on your desk?
That’s rockin
Your small speaker holders look cool, could you let us know where you got it
How to make your house more accessible to the unknown. Install portal mirrors perfectly symmetrical of eachother.
My dad had LED's like this!
(^?^)
$300.00 could also have bought a Masterbuilt Bluetooth Smoker; but this is probably better for your waistline...
i just realized, only vampires would feel the complete experience of the portal, no obstructions
What about building this and mixing it with the smart mirror concept. except use an HD camera and have the monitor behind the mirror show the HD cam feed in a different part in the house.
Actually it would be cheaper if you'd live in finland ( ?° ?? ?°)
i paid 5 dollars dorllars each glass so ya its cheaper
Super dope ????
DAISY!!!
but that sunset though!
lol..some damn expensive mirrors..! where I live, I can get'em for 8 bucks each
Yaaaaasssss!!!
Great! Now you can invest $3 for a couple of rgb extension cables and hide those ugly ir controllers.
Did you sub bot your channel cause damn.... 93k views and 518k subs...

I was just playing portal!!
hey i have that desk
Nice. First time I've seen an infinity mirror done that way. Although those mirrors seem a little pricey. loses usually has some cheap mirrors around $25.
No joke i'm gonna do this.
I will definitely take a huge mirror
Wow!
You almost sounded like Wheatley after a completed test when you saw the results
OMG this is freaking awesome!! You dude are my crush, you´r a genius
seen this done for a lot cheaper like around 100$ by using wood ovals and using a product called mirror in a can. check it out anyone thinking of doing this MUCH CHEAPER same effect
oh oh oh... There is no red portal, there is an orange portal :/ but good job anyway
The mounts came with the mirrors or did you but them separately?
portal 3
Its so clean, things up on this. Now I want to do this.
This is such a creative idea!!
You should flip the shotgun mic around when you are talking from behind the camera so your voice isn't muffled.
can someone just link me the online ones just going buy them but nice video dude!
Striped shirt on camera is trippy
Amazing DIY! Even though I'm glad that the 3rd mirror arrived in 1 piece, I was sort of anticipating/hoping for it to be broken... just to have a quick facepalm chuckle.
Wheres the cake
This is not DIY if it costs that much to make. DIY is supposed to be cheap.
woah 7:00 is trippy asfffffffff
Holy shit dude that's amazing, definitely doing it for my new room.
Bro what type of knife is that that's freaking awesome!!
the concepts for these are cool but real portal when looking in it you would see you back not your font, but portals dont exist yet so yeah still cool though, and can you touch you self in a portal by putting you leg out and trying to touch it with your hand?
i would only build it myself . if i saving money . lol . but cool anyway
( ?° ?? ?°) Heck yeahhhhhh
if i had this idea first i'd have a camera and oval displays so that way they'd transmit to the other display, making you be able to see yourself from behind, like a real portal mirror would
So Cool!
GLaDOS would be proud.
Damn ????
I sub because of this vid
Very nice...
wow, looks like you can jump right through xD
Cake anybody?
What song is that at 3:42? sounds great
SCHWEET.
New idea Have a screen the same shape of the mirrors and have a camera on top of each of them so the camera on the orange screen will project the image on the blue screen and vice versa so it will give it a more realistic effect
This deserves more views...
This is so sick!
Awesome work m8 , i think i gonna copy this :P . Greetings from Germany ;)

Dude that’s the coolest shit I’ve ever seen

What is the name of the intro music? I've heard it everywhere and I'm desperate to hear more
This channels dead imo. To me and my friends at least, his personality is just bland, and seems forced. There isnt much originality and he hasnt founs a series that he wants to keep going concistantly. I am not saying he cant get better, but at this point he's annoying me. Plus hes always late to the hype train when it comes to tech.
This looked amazing and I'm definitely gonna try it. The only question is how to possibly make it cheaper, in the classic spirit of DIY...
how did he do the intro design
good????
This is the first video I've watched in months, I'm so glad I came back!

Waste of money
Some damn expensive mirrors xD Where I live I can get 'em for like 40 bucks each
Bootyfull
Well done. You are now in possession of the Amazon Science Handheld Mirror Device. With it, you can order your own mirrors. These multi-lightwave reflectors have been proven to be completely safe. The box however, has not. Do not thrown the box against a wall. Do not hold the box over your head. Do not submerge the box in liquid, even partially. Most importantly, under no circumstances should you sh4ud#fs1do)ifhoo*oo..
K. Now do this with them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5qptMYOMCg
Looks sick!
DAMN, best video of the week!
It annoys me that the mirror isnt perfectly in the middle of the two speakers
I’m actually going to try this
Sick ??
Today is my birthday, can i get like on comment
Now your thinking with portals
It would be cool to see a diy smart mirror
Would make it, but i don't have two parrallel walls ! ??
This is sick, love this. You should do more DIY videos! I'm really enjoying these
Aaaaand now I have to include portal mirrors in my room.
its great
MS Tech I love your video. It truely inspires me. Please reply me
Fun video to watch :)

Pretty sweet man make me one and I’ll pay you for it
This looks so cool, good job man
THAT LOOKS INSANE!!!
It looks so cool
Really nice actually
Now time to jump into the portal to see what happens
Dope :o
Great video man! Loved it :D
dope af
I Didn't Know Mirrors Were So Expensive. ;-;
Legitimately awesome ??
not as sick as dbs episodes 109+110
I am definitely getting this for my room ??
That looks..... AMAZING!!!
If you would have taken the time to straighten up and organize your studio this would have been impressive. Peace, John in Idaho :)
Absolutely amazing. I'm finding tons of inspiration for my dorm from you.
Love your video's keep up the good work
That is fuken littt, I think I might do something like that when I get my own apartment lol
It actually looks so dope
Looks amazing! Nice job! Also congrats on 500k subs, you deserve it!
"You can see the orange glow from that mirror in this mirror..." Gee thanks for telling us how mirrors work..... Woulda been lost without you...
Dope
I figured that he wasn't smart enough to figure out teleportation
I’m loving your videos lately. Keep up the good work! Stay classy ( ?°?????° )
The project style videos are great :) pretty sure we all love them
Still don't get why it was that damned expensive
Sweg...I spit all over myself...
can you link me the cable management clips
TECH SAVAGES WHERE YOU AT?!?
man this is so dope!! daaaamn
I’ve seen butter
This is.. This is amazing
God damm, even the mirror effect makes it look like it's a real portal
Holy heck that is cool
Dang it worked out really well!!!
This looks awesome! Might try it!
Not something I’m into personally but good video non the less
This concept is awesome, but I’d love to see you build a magic smart mirror. Not the crappy ones with tablets, but a cool high end one with voice control etc.
You probably could have got mirrors for a much cheaper price. Just saying.
But when you look in the mirror you see your face not like it is in portal
Get some heat shrink tubing and customize the power cord length.
what if we had to oval shaped monitors and had a life feed from one to the other. make it a true portal.
Film your family's reaction to seeing this plz
Cool
I love this! It’s a great idea!
This is so cool.
that actually looks so dope
That's awesome. Nice job.
Portal 2 is my favorite game everr so obviously I loved it, if i had a little more space in my room I would make this for sure. Great video!
Wow!! This is really awesome! You should do more vids like this one!!! I'm from Brazil, and I think your videos are really great!!
I want to make this
If only it was like proper portals (I know that’s impossible without cameras and shiz nizz) lime you look throug one and see your back, as that’s what the other portal would see.
I LOVE this concept! I think I'll do this myself! [goes to go build some portal mirrors] Wait.... [realization intensifies] I almost forgot! I'm DIRT POOR!!
Dude, listen... NO ONE FUCKING CARES IF YOU FIRST!!
Your videos are a perfect example of what you can do when you think you can do it keep up the great vids thank you

The suspense was so real, who will die first? Kirby? You? The Kill Mii?
Never have I seen one person put so much time and effort into one thing only to hate the product so extremely
You’ve inspired me to make it even smaller. My girlfriend is already pissed at both me and you like if we went drinking and brought back home a Victoria’s Secret build board and i barley told her my plans. If she kills me when i finish it ill give you credit for my personal inferno of a creation im going to call the ikilmii The only question is, how high can i set the standards for the poor scrub that’s gonna beat me and how much will i surprise even you?
Sad sad creation that is cool af I wish I could do that that’s awsome
You’re the “thanks! I hate it!” Meme embodied
My question is how many altoids did you have to eat
This is what I call 'meme genius' Can make very awesome thing... But refuse to and make shit like this for the sake of fuck know what...
this video has the same energy as when Frankenstein created the monster
This is amazing!!! Like I'm just speechless ! Technology is so fun.
I feel the hate in your voice for that little box ??
This was so neat to watch, hopefully I can get as good with technology as good as you
I think this is so cool dude. Even if it isn't practical...it's really cool.

But can you charge and play at the same time?
but the 3ds is a Wii portable
Mass produce
This is basically the smallest wii form factor i ever saw.. even Nintendo wouldn't be able to do that xD (joking for thr Nintendo part but it's so impressive) !
how much would it be to buy one??? i want one so badly now lol
who hurt you
Can you make a tutorial on how to build this? This is amazing!
3 minutes of quality gaming
If you had an external power pack, how long do you think this could run for?
honestly i wish I had one and before you try to ask me why, i really think it doesn't look bad. I mean it could look better obviously bt in this state it actually looks good. I would really want a tutorial for this
Thanks I hate it
Could you do this, but with outputs for tv and controllers so it would hook up like a normal wii? Ps: I mean like, without the screen and buttons, so it would basically be a more portable console, but still a console.
Make it last for 10 hours and you got yourself a deal!
go commit dii
this man with be the end of the world
How long is the battery?
You know what fuck the switch this is the future,used mint cans that have shitty controlls
You should make more and sell them
Fit the Wii remote into tiny boxes, so you can be waving your fingers around at an altoids box and tell people you're playing Wii Sports
Stuff other things into an altoids tin
REeeEeEeEee
I wished you showed us wii sports
You've got to be kidding mii
How far can you go in F-Zero GX?

I don't know what impresses me more, that you dedicated a year to this basically just because, or that it actually works really well for what it is. Either way, super impressed!
a modern frankenstein
I wanna see pirate’s plundarr
Why not make it a big external power pack that attaches to the back in another Altoids tin? It would let it have a few more mints of gameplay...

Reminds me of when the iPod nano first came out and someone made a guide for how to replace the NAND with a 3.5’’ PATA hard drive. You could store considerably more songs and the battery could almost play maybe one and a half. http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Ipod_Nano_200gb_Instructions
Can it run DOOM?
Junk!
Now finish the curse and play Skyward Sword on it.
But can it run doom?
Has science gone too far?
Tmw your mom think you're eating mints But you're actually playing smash bros
Did you favorite every comment?
Oh if you have the ZL and Zr button
What's funny is that Kirby is low tier in melee.
I'm just commenting to get a heart.
You absolute madman.
I want to see skyward sword with some simulated motion controls. Or wii sports resort that would be very interesting and experimental (well of course anything from GC Wii is experimental on mobile)
Holy crap dude, you are a really legitimate God. "The battery takes a long time to charge and only lasts 10-15 minutes" obviously trash but it's amazing. I probably wouldn't even be able to take the inners out of my wii without screwing something up. BTW I have seen a couple of other projects that feature a portable GC or Wii, specifically BitBuilt and others on youtube. They totally blow my mind because I haven't taken any engineering courses but I'd love to get one! Of course we already have Dolphin though. The future of mobile gaming is dangerously good
I almost subscribed just on the introduction to this one video alone. Priceless.
I like how it didn’t die
You should do a speedrun on it.
Play Super Mario Galaxy. on it. You said it could run anything! :D
Truly a modern day Frankenstein, just in time for Halloween.
You show such a passionate hatred for your creation, and I like that.
I'll take twenty!
what the fuck
Your community sounds more loco than a tin of Altoids my friend
You could sell this, it just needs an actual case lol, and a better battery.
99.9% sure this voids the warranty lol Also, I wonder if Nintendo will recruit you guys to develop a miniature Wii handheld?
Next project you should make a Cinco Phone! But all kidding aside, this is a cool project. You set modest goals and met them admirably.
1:23 the discord notif threw me off so badly
The day we’ll be able to play dark souls on an Altair’s tin
This is something I would buy someone for Christmas.
That is amazing
Give me 10
The fact that you sound like you wanna die helps
On the next episode of " how did I manage myself to get to this video "
I would pay for this
I love that the only two videos on this YouTube channel are a mark of absolute ingenuity and perseverance, and then a dude shooting his friend with a foam rocket
kill mii end my miserii
can it run fortnite tho
I love how you kno that this is worst idea ever and spent a year doing it anyway lol
This is great! Regardless of the overheating or dying in ten minutes...the logistics shouldn't even be possible haha! Well done my man.
1 year?! 10 min battery?!
"am I allowed to john about my controller" yes, absolutely
this is one of the best things i have ever seen thank you for existing and making your abominations
Could you possibly plug in an extra battery? Or plug into wall?
You monster
FeelsBadMan discord ping 1:23 check my second moniter
Can you give me a full list of parts? Just in like text format? I really want to replicate this just because I think it’s cool!
can we see wii music
If the battery life was better and had nicer buttons I would absolutely love to have one of these. Being able to play Paper Mario TTYD on the go is a dream come true for me. Well done ??
This was no doubt worth it.
HOW
I'll take 20.
This is the most useless and terrible thing I'll ever seen. I'll buy 20
Do a ten minute speed run of a game, Zelda maybe? But first cover the buttons with something softer, that looks really painful.
Tony stark built it IN A CAVE!
But can it run Mintcraft?
doesnt the thing need cooling btw? i remember my wii had pretty strong small fans in it
I want to Kill Mii self
Youtube recommendations strikes again. Not that i'm complaining.
Play a Wii game on it! Please?
Please pay Mario Kart oh my God
so you made it into a slightly better wii u
I don’t even have words
How do you have so many subs lol you have 2 videos
“Made as just a joke” Runs Melee perfectly on a fucking Altoids tin
I legit was interested in the gameplay
The discord notification at 1:23 confused the fuck out of me lmao.
Can I waste my hard earned cash on this thing?
Now I'm curious.... if you can trim it to fit in an altoids tin, can you modify it to fit in a gameboy casing?
God has left the server
Imagine Seeing competitive Melee on this
The year is 20XX, everyone plays melee on altoids.
1:22 Discord goes off XD
I wanna see you play The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess
The fact that it runs Melee faster then my laptop,makes me closer to commiting skooter ankle
No jons even for that controller
1:22 ya got a discord notification
So are ya gonna start mass-producing these things or what?
r/madlads
Very nice.
It's so good it's surreal
Sometimes I wonder: "How the hell do people do this shit with altoids." FUCKIN ALTOIDS.
The L & R not being on the back or sides like the Volume buttons is a deal breaker. Its still awesome that you did this
the fact that you can do this made me realize how stubborn nintendo is for not putting these games on modern consoles.
I dont know how I got here, but Im confused yet intrigued at the same time.
Ok now this is epic, especially its working on a altoids can (Dont be disappointed in this because that runs better than the Dolphin emulator on android)
This is the most delicious game system I ever seen.
But can it run Crysis?
F
Your voice is relaxing
I think I’ll get one for my depressed friend
Holy Farnsworth!
How much to buy this off you. I like conversation starters
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Sweet build dude, that it works half as well as it does is a testament to your skill and dedication!
Whats next? Playing Skyrim on a cookie tin?
We spent so much time asking if we could, no one stopped to ask if we should. Has science gone too far?
But CAN it run doom
If you squint It looks like someone shot the can with a strong peashooter and cut holes in it
"Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?" ~Frankenstein's monster, Frankenstein (Mary Shelly)
The Wii U & Nintendo Switch are quaking. Nintendo? Snatched.
You had me at "called the 'kill mii'"
Imagine playing tony hawk on this
but can it run doom?
Woah
Are you okay?
I was tripping on the pacman mini game @ Wal-Mart this is jusy madness gr8 job bruv!
I never thought I’d see anything like this but I’m so happy I did, it’s awesome!
my mind is completely blown, you absolute madman
This is amazing.
Now try and make a portable Switch. Wait a second...
I love the Kill Mii Its so bad
Wow
Original Xbox in an Altoids Tin
This might be actually more comfortable to use than a N64 controller.
Please kill mii get the joke
You were so busy trying to see if you could that you never once thought about if you should
You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you didn’t stop to think if you should.
Maker contempt is the best kind of contempt. It's so much easier to gripe about the warts on something when you put them there.
"can it fit in an Altoids tin?" is the new "can it run Crysis?"
Imagine seeing a guy on the subway just take out an altoid tin and start playing it
"Kill Mii"
whats the music at 4:35?
yo my guy wtf u say its sucks but your awesome
>makes portable Wii >plays a modded version of Smash Bros. Melee, a GameCube game
TAKE MY MONEEEEEYYYYY
You should put a ps4 in a tic tac container
Where do I order one?
Looks awesome to me! I new Gameboy micro update design in play??
that mf discord sound made me go crazy trying to figure out why it sounded and no notifs from my brofags wtf man
1968:I bet we will have flying cars in the future 2018: playing smash in a can for holding mint
This doomaflotchie is GLORIOUS!
So, something that I would like to see is the same mod but built into a Wii U pad.
And now cancer will never be cured because people were working on projects like this...
play brawl on it...
It's good and all but why melee, should've done subspace on Brawl smh.
What a title.
When aliens finally come to earth, they will be proud that this exists.
The.
That discord notification at 1:22
My only question is... Is it for sale?
I can’t believe you did this, good fucking game, man.
if you favorite every comment is it really a favorite?
i saw you posted this on reddit weeks before, you said it was the worst thing ever, overheats and very bad battery. Seeing this in action is amazing but also silly, the fact that you took a year to finish this was crazy. All i can say is bravo and mad respect for playing melee on the kill mii.
Thanks, I hate it
Can a nintedndo switch fit inside an altoids tin?
But can it run CRISIS?!
We living in 2018 while this nibba living in 3049
...I kinda want one, I dont even like the Wii and I want one. Why must electronics in altoids tins be nifty and fun to play with?
"Someone had to do it" No...no they didn't....But I'm glad you did!
But can it run Doom?
The discord notification at 1:23 really made me look around to see who pinged me.
Illuminati: “stay where you are” Harvard: “yo you want a scholarship my nigga” Nintendo: “our lawyers will be in contact with you very soon”
I was waiting for this thing to slice you open the whole video.
Play summer olympics
Nintendo could team up with you to sell these things and make bank! ....but theyd rather send you a cease and desist letter.
I literally wanna buy something like this
quality looks great for the size
CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES.**THIS IS MY LAST WII-SORT
next is the Xbox One X in an Arizona Tea can
Yo this is pretty cool dude. Great work!
It's called the K I L L M I I Why hasn't Nintendo hired this man yet?
How would you play a game that requires motion controls?
"lasts 10-15 minutes but takes a few hours to charge" starting to have mad respect for the switch.
How heavy is it?
aNyOnE wAnNa PlAy WiI sPoRtS?
Such a good way to be introduced to this community. GG
So... you spent an entire year shoving a Wii into an Altoids tin as a joke and just because you could? Respect.
Lol fit the switch in that size
I’ve never seen such casual hate before ... i tip my hat to you sir
i'll pay ANYTHING for you to send me one of those fuckers right NOW!!!!!! PS which Korby game is that?
how much?
Let’s be honest here: soon everyone will have some sort of console into an altoid can.
I... want one
My god... You could do so much with so little (littlally)
Your voice is soothing
Do Luigi's mansion!
1:22 Dammit, you made me check my Discord
Bayonetta?
if i was smart this is something i would do
Part of me actually wants one of these.
BUT… Can it run Crysis?
I didn't think this was real, then I started watching the video. It's cute...and beyond anything I can do right at this moment, even tho you hate it lol.
mii_irl
Next can you make the pii pii?
I wonder, if you attach a link cable port to this and run a GBA game through a homebrew emulator (think trading with pokemon emerald for example), would it be possible to trade?
Bruh you realize you could just pull this out at any time and just start playing games
you're a god amongst men
This is some genius level stuff
this guy spent a year on a joke, thats dedication Edit: this is better than the switch. Proof? It has melee.
can it run doom?
To be honest, if Nintendo sold a fully working version of this with cartridges, I would buy it. Would it be theoretically possible to use gyroscopic sensors to turn the actual console into a wii mote?
This reminds me of my Sega game gear, amazing device lasted about 10 minutes with the batteries I stole from my TV remote and my rc car
This is fucking impressive.
There should be a speedrun category for using this
That moment when you realize most of the space of a wii was for the ports and the drive
theoretically, would it get hot enough to cause any hardware damage?
Dang I'd want to see skyward sword or maybe Metroid prime running on this thing
this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen I salute you, good sir
I'd say fuck the altoids tin, put the insides in a decent sized portable, get a gigantic battery for it (maybe something like 50w/hrs, and call it the best portable wii in the world, because it would be.
I hate melee
I would love to see someone play a 12+ hour RPG like Xenoblade in 10-minute bursts with this thing
"Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he's created?" Also I just have to see Metroid Prime Trilogy on this monstrosity
Wii Sports please
I can’t wait for “Nintendo Switch in Shoelace”, next time.
It's smaller than a Gameboy, you could market this for girls and call it....the Gameboy-girl ??????
You are a Good Damn beautiful genius. I salute you.
This is pretty neat, but can it run DOOM?
why is this garbage suggested to me
Can you kill me because I saw the Kill Mii?
Great job, dude(s)!
THIS IS IMPRESSIVE!!.......... ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................but why tho?.
I'll buy 12 please
This is beyond science
Dad: why is the FBI here?
give this to mii
Make the battery last longer. please
The real question is what would it cost to buy but in a better design? Such as in a GameCube controller?
2018, what a time to be alive Funny how we can't get Melee (or any gamecube game, for that matter) on the Switch, but here you are running it on an altoids can.
Nintendo should have done this with the Wii U. Mint case and all.
edit. me being a random potato warning i have a random thought lol I bet you could fit ur penis in their because its tiny like mine but im 12 so mine hasant poked out yet but i can finger my indent to cum pain in the a*s to clean including mycum
I definitely want to see Twilight Princess run on this thing.
I'm surprised it was possible...
This is fucking ugly, fucking retarded, and fucking amazing all at the same time. TAKE MY GODDAMN MONEY ALREADY.
Do you have any plans to make a switch portable?
This is insanely cool, yet insanely dumb. It is incredible to think about the possibilities this implies, though. With enough work, you could theoretically make a comfortable to use portable version of the Wii. Like a DS, but with more power. This is amazing.
i wanna see u play donkey kong jungle beat
He sure does like altoid
The nooses are a great touch
Why you say wii sports like it is crap? It is the best game ever i loved it!!
hi
Make a rumble pack for it
That's awesome work ! I feel like the top of the Altoids can should be all screen no built in controls with a kick stand to prop it up then just using the wiimote would be perfect lol
Throws money at screen WHY IS NOTHING HAPPENING
You: creates a Wii in a mint container Me: How do I work this oven?
Kill mii mor like kill me ex deeehehehehahhahahahah
A ps vita In a altoid tin would be weird but funny honestly
Damn, smash ultimate looks great
Pretty
But will it blend
Real question: can it run games meant for an accessory that came with it? (Like guitar hero o, or taiko no tatsujin)
You should port doom on skyrim to it, to complete the meme circle
A working wii in an altoids tin called the kill mii TIME WELL SPENT
People really just do whatever
looks brilliant, really cool!
tbh I’d love to see Mario kart on this thing if you have it or if you can
they just put anything in a can nowadays
fit it in a tic tac container
Genius
i for some reason want one
That's cool I want one I would like to see a wrestling game
Can i have the kill mii
Can i have it
Dude this is fucking hilarious. These programmers have the most dry humor and are killing it on YouTube. I swear he will reach 100k fast as fuck if he uploads more. Much love my dude
I could total see myself playing animal crossing city folk as if it’s new leaf
The two nooses is my favorite part
I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds - Oppenheimer
But can it run Crysis?
Is there a way I can buy one of these?
Wii in an altoid can?? Hold my beer.... *instructions unclear *penus stuck in altoid can
Me:*sees thumbnail* probably click bait Him:*I hate it* Me: based on how nonchalant he says this, im inclined to beleive him
Mario galaxy
How much for one?
I want that so bad tbh. Amazing job.
looks dangerous
C U R I O U S L Y S T R O N G
you sir, have earned my sub.
wow
Next up wii u
You've done better than the guys at smach z and you did it on a personal budget. Granted you are not building somthing from scratch but youve got a working device that isnt teathered to a pc.
I would love to see a wii u gamepad that is actually portable and plays all wii and gc games, you can Kill Mii and take my soul to see it happen!
Are you,, alright??
I want to see you play Wii Sports on it
But This is awesome I couldn't do this
I want to see Smash tournaments played on this
For the request, Rhythm Heaven Fever and/or Xenoblade Chronicles? :) Great job btw..... I've never seen someone hate something they made so much.
1:22 alright, who went and checked discord
WHAT
pff cant even wavedash
KIIIILLLL MEEEE
Not all heroes wear capes. (Great Video.)
play just dance on it
you’ve got the patience of god to have made something that despicable
Does someone notes, that there is no Super Smash Bros Melee tittle screen on this video?, is that possible?....is that a romhack?
Shut up and take my money!
get on it todd howard
i dont have any background in electrical engineering, pcb's and what not, but i am just blown away on how could you trim a factory made factory spec pcb with all those microchip thingies intact, can you do a seperate video comparing the internals of a normal unmodded wii to this glorious thing for us normal peeps :D , and again, i am just stumped and amazed you could fit a wii in that thing damn.
Now the question is: can it run doom?
thank you! it’s hideous!
I'm interested to know if there's any interference from the casing with other Bluetooth controllers. Great execution on kind of a shitty idea lol.
I love this new trend of hilarious super programmer's who hate their inventions showing up on youtube.
Would be cool to put a wii-u inside the touch screen controller.
Can I buy it!
No joke though, you could make a really awesome portable Wii with how much you were able to trim the board.
Dude stop talking trash on this creation, its beautiful
My god this it the most beautiful and hateful rage mod console. Is it possible you can do that on the GBC, GBA, NDS?
Now make a wii with only a napkin
It’s quite awesome what you did here with custom PCBs. Down the road I’d like to make my ultimate Melee portable in a similar gameboy-esque form factor. >>hope my batteries dont run dry >>picks floaties on dreamland Anyways the fan would work better if you move the intake to the opposite end of the device for maximum air flow. With proper cooling and batteries this device really would be worth a different title!
Thanks you, but no thank you. Would this thing be cooler/better in a Gameboy shell?
Let me buy it please
how many thousands of dollars can i buy this for
Kirby whooping that ass
The Tintendo Wii
Impressive yet so sad to think you hate it so much. I understand that such pain comes from dedicating so much time to what is just a handheld Wii.
Everyone say “Thank you friend Noah” for the custom circuitboard
Yo how much for it? I probably would buy this from you.
I personally would of called it the Wii Boy.
I’m not saying I’m hating but that’s a portable GameCube
Can u do a basic quide
Melee players would take this if it meant keeping the game relivant
cant wait to see your version 2
Man just thinking about playing harvest moon on such a tiny scale....
Curiously strong.
Now do PS4
Is that real
The Nintendo altoid portable wii
Lmao the captions called it a weed portable. ??
Ironically enough the fact that it takes a few hours to charge and gets you about 10-15 minutes of gameplay is perfect for me. It would be excellent for breaks at work and school. Excellent job on this curiously small portable.
Next: Pornhub in a jar
Do you sell things
Do you cell thing
Creo que esta mas potente que mi pc :v
That is the craziest thing I've seen in quite a while. Cant believe a wii can be made so compact.
you probably need a magnifying glass or something to play some wii games with how far you'll be with a wiimote
This thing is impressively awesome.
this is so fake
Very cool!
WHAAAAAAAAAAT
Stills no video of it actually running
So this is the leaked Nintendo Switch 2019 Patent...
kill mii now
Gtfo! Lmao!
No matter what it’s great how you turned a tin box into a Wii??.
Mario kart
This has better battery life then the Oculus Go LOL
I WANT IT SO BAD
Who wants to bet the 132 dislikes were Nintendo?
So when are you selling this !!?
Its called the kill me... it's the worst thing ever
Earbuds?
Dude! Your going places! This is awesome!??
'Hello everybody, today i'm going to show off my latest project. it's called the kill me."
the fact that you can fit a Wii in a fucking altoids tin inspires me to try and make my own Wii portable. You earned my subscribe for that riddiculous feat of engineering.
How much ??????
Theoretically, how much would you charge for a portable PS2? Because despite how absolutely haunted this is, it's also super commendable for being a "why the hell not" project that did get finished.
People say science has gone too far. I say science hasn't gone far enough.
amazing!!! great job.
1:23 discord notification bruh turn it down lmao
Do the Wii U.
This is incredible. I will say the Short life use of batteries is a flaw, but honestly this is cool. Imo maybe two years, Wii/GameCube emulation on phones is gonna be capable with 30 fps and minor frame drops. 4.5/5 Very creative..just needs better cooling.
Dude you could totally help design handheld consoles for a gaming company based on this. You would just need to make changes to the buttons lol
Great for speedruns
Bro your KillMii expired last month. 36 days ago from the making of this post to be exact. (37 if you're not West Coast)
1:22 @everyone
Builds portable Wii Plays Melee
Are u just randomly on?
NOW THATS TALENT
This is like my favorite "B" movies, so awful that they're great.
NOW DO A KILL SWITCH
plays xenoblade on altoids box
But Melee isn’t on the Wii?
Insane talent, deserves way more views!
What do I do to become this tech savvy?
Nintendo would call this the New Wii Mini
OK, I'm sickened but curious
There's Hope for this project Just write labels on the buttons Problem solved 100% working, garunteed or your money back
Where's my heart?
I now have the explosives I need to kill mii
Dude play Zelda twilight princess
Huh... why is the real wii so big then
Someone start making shirts that say "Kill Mii" in the Wii font, pls. All proceeds go to this poor man's therapy costs.
It’s pretty cool
Super Mario galaxy !!
When I was watching this I literally checked when it was made because it seems so crazy that i thought it was an April fools joke
Before there was a Switch.
Thanks I hate it.
as much as you hate this device. its still a feat. to make something this small, it takes skill.
Science run amok! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY-pUxKQMUE
this is dope
Play guitar hero 3 legends of rock
Can you add an hdmi port or something?
you madman!
Why tho
This had not gotten enough views. This is too fantastic.
Honestly, this should be at an arts exhibition
Id rather have this instead of the switch
What is your major? Pimp shit?
Can you play No More Heroes with this?
This is incredible WOW!
Do you think it'd be possible to make it horizontal like a GBA and have buttons on either side of the screen instead?
Engineers are always suicidal it comes with the knowledge we posses
Nds tin edition?
This altoids tin would be perfect for the next melty blood tournament.
Would love to see you play some Wii bowling on this
This is so god damn cool!
Can you make a tutorial?
Why ?
Macgyver would be proud.
This is super cool! I think a wii in dsixl shell would also be cool. That way you have more space for better buttons, battery, etc.
Oh my gosh no way!!! I bet you are crazy good at math, it must be so satisfying to know you can do something like this
You are the Victor Frankenstein of the video game hardware hacking scene
You should do this on a psp
Can you charge and play or would it get to hot or die lol?
Nintendo would like to know your location
you are an absolute madman, I thank you for your service sir
Bro have some pride in you work this thing is fucking impressive
beautifull work man :3 i suscribe
I have headphones on and the dog barking legit freaked me the hell out, due to the binaural audio. props on your absurd portable wii, though.
Excellent work
I'll take 10
damn.you really bout to do this to mii
Starts playing at 3:43
Sell it. Please.
I think that hardware deserves a 3d_Printed custom new home later. Great execution with the custom rewiring of vital components into such a small form factor. a rebuild could be called the "Revive Mii" lmao For something that's supposed to be a joke, it turned out to be something pretty cool.
Plz make me one with super smash Bros on it and a bunch of other games :'(
How about taking out the hardware fron the PSP than putting in this Wii hardware would it work or not
Love how he checks his phone when he gets a notification in the middle of filming
But does it wave dash? ??
Kind of embarrassing but I thought you was Kirby.
Does the can get hot?
plays GameCube game on Altoids tin Nintendo: you can play nes games on the switch for a low price of 4.99 a month
Could you make a video showing off skyward sword
what a nice name??
10 minutes....long charge, overheating problems in a metal tin ????????????
*3ds
Is this the Nintendo Wii Classic? Looks great!
This is the coolest shit I have ever seen and you hate it so much it hurts lol
Are... You... Ducking... Serious Dude...? You really did that... Wow. I... I just... You're so Casual about it... Like it's nothing... My man, you put the whole Wii shits inside of a FFFFFFFUCKING ALTOIDS TIN... A WII... IN A TIN... AND IT'S NOTHING TO YOU... I so wish i could be at so high of a tech wizz level, that i could just discount the sheer epicness of my amazing creation. I love how crude it is. Adds to the charm. I am not kidding when i say i would bust that out on the subway with full confidence.
if you were to sell it how much would you value it?
slow claps
Dude, whether you hate it or not, this is ridiculously amazing. Kudos
Woah... Now Melee is the freshest smash game!
"You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could do it, you didn’t stop to think if you should."
Play wii call of duty games.
Wait, so you took an actual Wii, gutted it, and crammed it all into an Altoids tin? Take my money lol
Great Project... you could possibly build the internals in a new housing that can store a bigger battery so that it is more practical.
Amazing! Im glad you blew up from this vid :)
It's called the kIll me.
I will buy this for $69,420 Where do I buy?????1?
Patent and sell it back to Nintendo those dumbfuccs would probably buy it.
butwhy.gif
Wow, dude, I'm a fan of that casual despise you have acquired for that creation of yours..... I would love to see you try to complete a Mario Galaxy 2 star with that 10 minute limitation. Anyway, loved it, you earned a sub.
Take a shot every time he says wii or we
Beautiful
Angry Discord Notification Sound
Why don’t you put right/left shoulders on the top ?
HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR?!?!
Metriod prime 3
I have a friend who seems to always have altoids with him, and he gives them out to people during school. I'd love to bring this thing to school just to one up him Lol
i hope someone eventually takes a 3ds/2ds XL case, and puts wii internals inside. i feel like itd be a good fit, but everybody thinks different so idk.
This but in a gameboy shell would be awesome omggg
I need one of these
Shank mods can you make me one please?
"That thing could run your heart for fifty lifetimes!" "Or something small for 15 minutes."
It looks awesome!
Hey, it's so cool to see something like this. I checked out your channel to watch your other videos, but I guess this is your first one. I look forward to seeing future projects. This is great production value for a first video too!
"Kill Mii 2," now with 2 more minutes of battery life! - My god man this looks so stressful to even showcase never mind actually plan and build... P.S: what did you do with all those mints?
JUST KILL MII ALREADY!
I mean, I would want one
What a monstrosity. I love it! XD
Pretty dope. Mission accomplished imo. BUT CAN IT FIT IN AN ALTOIDS TIN? YES ? Yes it can.
Better than "Diys mini Pc's"
Next up: making a portable computer. Oh wait....
Play call of duty world at war
Play metroid prime 3 on it
takes hours to charge......lasts 10 minutes.....this is hilarious! awesome job man!
Is this a cry for help?
1:05 Your Wii is past its expiration date.
Looks like shit
Shank Mods: Anything Wii can do, we can do better
So he spent a year on a joke?
To test out a wii mod, I played a gamecube game!
id use it if the battery lasted longer than 10 mins
Make Oculus Rift in a tic tac container
I wish I was that good to make a portable wii
Play fortnite on it
I WiSh SoMe OnE WoUlD KiLl Me
This is both stupid and Awesome. 5star for the effort. now I want one
I noticed that a lack of internal clock battery, was this just hidden behind the tape or done on purpose?
Me: Can't even win against pichu on a normal gamecube Shank: Annihilates a 20XX Kirby on a 2-inch screen using the worst controller possible k
But can your Kill Mii fit in a wii? . hmmmmm
You're insane.
Ah, this is... Ah.
I'm curious how you learned to do all this? Did you take software classes at school or did you somehow self teach yourself?
xd
I would totally buy this
Finally my yt recommendations don’t suck.
How can something be so dumb yet be so cool
Why tho
I know it's not pretty and you don't like it but that aside the whole thing is actually very impressive
my reaction- WOAH THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPRESSIVE WORK you- This sucks..
This is actually amazing and inb4 nintendo sues you
i love the name lol You're also incredibly talented.
If I didn’t see it I wouldn’t of believed it was true to make this it’s stupid but cool at the same time.
I almost feel like it would be cooler if you took out the screen, battery and controller, added a video out (maybe HDMI if that's possible?) And basically turn it into a super compact home console.
Dude I will buy 1 or 2 of these off of you message n lets see what we can work out
But, will it run Doom?
You are kidding right? You have to, that's just impossible, mi mind can't handle this :O
Now make a Wii into an Altoids tin
Are you an electrical engineer?
But can you multishine with it?
The Tinii
what kind cable you used for connecting nand flash memory to audio amp?the thinnest one... and how to get that custom circuit board?let me knw please...
Thumbs up for this, that is so cool. If you can do it for fun in an Altoids can, I imagine cellphones should be playing console games in only a few more years. At least Xbox 360 and Ps3 games..
"A creator that hates his own creation"
But can I run Skyrim?
I mean at least it smells minty fresh
ive seen everything life has to offer
Lol that's a crazy looking device. It almost looks like it was made in after effects haha awesome. Would love to see more gameplays. Homebrew would be impressive.
I request you play no more heroes on the Kill Mii.
very creative name i love it please send me one
7:58 yeah, not sure he means the game here
But can it fit in a Tic-Tac container?
looks like a dumb piece of shit
If you extended the box and added a dual 2600 watt through a small amp you could extend the battery life by at least 2 hours
Man has never come so far as you have...
But the real question is, can you make a smart phone a TV monitor, whip out a controller, and start playing it right there? I’d buy that right away. It may not be as fancy as an Altoids Wii, but it’s still pretty cool!
With headphones, it sounded like my dog was barking like crazy in the other room. She never barks like that though, so it worried me for a second. Then I paused the video and it stopped.
Fanatic
But can it run mind sweeper
Do it on a tic tac box next
Y’all don’t know how bad I wish I was this talented.
Dbz bt3 please
When the Wii couldn't get any smaller
This looks stupid I want 20 of those
If I was on a committee, you would earn a PhD in engineering for this. I this want so bad.
make the wii in a lunch box next
Shush up and take muh money
Love the 1, 2 Oatmeal instrumental on that map
Play rock band
No johns when your controls are minty fresh
Wow better than the switch
XD I wish I had a portable wii to play stuff like Super Mario Bros. Wii. Nice job.
Real torture play Monster Hunter Tri
Onna take a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to charge. I'm meaning onna take a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to charge.
Omg this is super cool
Asmr
Those buttons are smaller that the GameCube dpad. I’m amazed and horrified at the same time.
I would actually use this. No joke.
Why not make these and sell them on eBay? People would pay about 300$ for em
WiiToid™
But can it run doom?
this is kind of pointless since the switch came out you should have done it to a PS4 instead love the video by the way
Wavedashing on the subway
Yo, wanna play on my portable set up? Bust out the altoids!
This is extremely impressive! Great work!
That's so amazing!!! You should do a Nintendo Switch Portable too.
we got emulation boi
This is amazing??
Just got off with the C.H.I.E.F. and he told me this post is "It".
Are you selling it?
I wanna be smart !! ????
Dang. It’s crazy you can shrink a Wii to that size
here can i buy this peice of rubish
Still better than my potato pc.
Builds it I hate it
Now now... but can it fit in a small Altoids can¿
You should epoxy the tops of 12 gauge shotgun shells over your 3ds sticks. It would be like 10 minutes of russian roulette every time you played. ;)
Dude sounds like the "Hi, my name is Reggie" meme.
WOW ILY
Best. Wii. Ever.
I cant imagine playing wii sports on a screen that small... DO IT
You're truly a legend
Im mad now
Just subscribed!!!
You are blasted insane
Play mario galaxy or Zelda
It’s hideous kill it before it breeds lol thanks for pointing that out in the first few seconds keep on making cool stuff!
netplay?
You've basically created something as cool as a time machine and you're like "Eh, This thing kinda sucks"
wtf
Sponsored by Altoids
This is the worst thing ever. I love it.
you should put an hdmi port for a tv
Ok, this is actually creative
Dude this is great you should send this to Nintendo
I would take this but put it in the body of an old gameboy the one that doesn’t fold or an old psp
PLAY MARIO GALAXY
Um....
That's amazing! Great job!
128,128 views XD
But can it wavedash?
7:58 you and me both brother
This masterpiece was posted on my 19th birthday, Lol. Awesome job btw!
Nice work.
Is Anna see super Mario galaxy on this.
Kill Mii: "The only console that melts in your mouth... And your hands."
the question is WHY?
Ridiculously awesome!
Bravo sir
this burns my eyes and my occipital lobe
Wii Classic Edition!!!
This is seriously amazing
For those of you who thought this would be impossible well....... Al-Toid you so.... shoots himself
Congrats, I guess? With your tone, I'm not very sure.
Where are your hot points?
It’s consoles like the “Kill Mii” the make me happy to live in this world
You should play Black ops 1
I have some ideas for your cooling issue
RDR2 looks better
How did you cut the blue wire without it breaking. And is this battery custom or from the wii itself, how much volts does it input and outsputs. Edit: also can i copy this :D?
Kinda Frankenstein, it’s ugly but it’s alive! I think the negative part is the battery, looks good to me (sorry for my English)
You know I'm something of a scientist myself
Theres the spirit.
kill me
I'm so glad this showed up in my recommendations.
Awesome
I know how to make a sandwich
All we need now is to play super smash bros. Ultimate on a hand.
He must have had some inspiration from ant-man and the wasp
Now make portable Altoids in a Wii controller.
you and your friend were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should
Even the Altoids Tin can play with four Ice Climbers. Come on, Nintendo 3DS.
"it's made as a joke" took more than one year ggwp
A how much would u sell it for and B where can I get the materials to make it
What the hell. this guys the smartest man on earth!! i can see u going far nice job man??????????????????
This is horrific, yet amazing.
Play f zero gx lol
I want one.
I have the Snail Much W1. It would be a cool project to build one from scratch and you'd be one of the few people that could pull that off.
did you use a wii mini?
I'll take ten
Just amazing. I know how hard this was to do. Glad you didn't give up.
You have way too much time on your hands dude.. Pretty damn cool
what the fuck
Press start... "Welp, it was good in theory"
kill mii more like kill me. ????
How cool would this run as Wii mini classic? I imagine without the screen, controller and battery this would be a Raspberry Pi killer. The coolest portable console I've ever seen
Make another one in a portable black and white CRT and call it the WiiRT
I see, I see. So Wii-mini is confirmed.
What the actual lol. That's amazing! I was expecting some rasberry stuff in there. but Damn. I still want me a MintiPi.
instead of making this for joke purposes you should put this in a bigger handheld form factor case so that you can fit a bigger battery and screen, then sell it. i'd buy it
Introducing the 4ds
how much ??
this is actually pretty cool!!! i wish i had something like this that i could've snuck in school.
pls kill mii
Just wow. I am truly at a loss for words.
Fucking mad lad
This is nintendos stability update we all been waiting on
I have no words
K I L L M I I.
Wii can what's next wii portable chair
Next on Shank Mods: Altoids Tin in a Wii console
Honestly I thought this was a joke.
Make a switch in Altoids and call it Kill Mii deluxe
Why not upgrade the fan and make it to where it can be externally powered?
rip Shockslayer
Wow the wires are so clean!!!
I'll take two please!
That's a terrible title for your new console! It should be DOOT mii
Id buy it
the cancer that is killing modding.
Kill mii
I burst out laughing after hearing it's battery life. What a terrible thing you've made lol!
Fake. You can see the pixel tracking mess up when the display turned on. The audio isn't genuine.
Has science gone too far?
Eat your heart out Nintendo. Got 1 Uped by a Guy With a Altoids Tin!
You are insane And I love you for it Keep up the good work
My best phone can't even play PS1 games
How much is it? Where can I buy one?
Custom board? Not a Wii anymore. Sorry
So you can fit a wii inside an Altoids can but Nintendo after 8 years can’t make a 3ds that runs games of the same quality as the wii. Cool..
holy guacamole
this really makes u think how an xbox one X will eventually be able to run at that size
Impressive! Never would have thought that a Wii could be so small without sacrifcing functionality!
are you serious right now how can you not love this sign mii up
Make another one called "Kill Mii and yourself" and make terrible ads for it.
How much are you selling for? Trick question doesnt matter
This is the real question even science can't answer: When and where can I buy one?
You create and you hated. I loved.
a bit pathetic lol could you please try to put this into a PSP shell? god that would be awesome to see. Ive seen a raspberrypi and thought it was the coolest thing before. next to a hacked psp a hacked wii is the coolest thing for retro gaming. Would be aweome to see wii and gamecube games on it plus better n64 emulator on a wii, only thing is it wouldnt play psp iso's anymore lol. I mod psp systems physically too, if youre interested, cover the shipping cost and ill send a pretty good body and whatnot you may need to do it. I should have at least 1 of each generation. It say a 1000 to have more room internally to work with. But yeah, paid that with a 4.3in screen and we're in business (dont think i have a screen) but lmk dude!
This is the best worst thing I've ever seen. Kudos, dude. This thing is both rad and bad, so I shall declare it... Brad
around 1:22 did anyone else check their discord?
points for the creative name
Wow, just...wow. How much for it?
When your constantly traveling everywhere for Melee tournaments and cant play regularly outside of tourney but Smash Bros is life...
Wii sports wii fit
1:22 Discord
That looks soooo cool I swear I wish I had this when I was 14 at school !! Nice job
I just love how much hate your creation regardless its awesomess.
i fucking hate this
This guy should have more subscribers than me!
But... can it play Mario Kart Wii Online?
BONE APPLE TEETH
lmao not a single shield drop what a noob
The new optimal way to play melee on the go, how much does it cost?
Ill buy it for 999999
Pensé que esto era imposible un poco más de estética y queda genial
I'd say it's worth it.
1:23 who was messaging you on Discord?
What is this piece of shit I'll take twenty
Could this be done in a slightly larger but still portable size that has a better battery life/doesn't overheat?
That's cool and all, but where do the disks go in?
I'll take three.
At least you didn't choose fox
You should do something about that background noise, Your dog's barking is very distracting.
why does it sound like you're about to cry was it really that bad?
1:23 @everyone
This is actually amazing
Kill Me: Portable Gun in an Altoids Tin
Not all heroes wear capes... unless you are wearing a cape, in which case, they all do. Amazing job, this is one of the coolest projects I have ever seen regardless of how practical it is.
this is pathetic and useless i'll buy it
Ok but can you fit it in a tic tac box
Wii nano mini... hey, that's pretty good
try and put a bigger battery
I can see how much you love your creation by the name
I would buy this off of you.
This is cool
Madlad.
How do games with motion controls work? Or do they just... not.
I would give you like 2000$ and you hate it lol
Mod me daddy
How?
What is this unholy abomination you’ve brought into the world and where can I get one? P.S. since you asked; can you somehow map the controls to play games like Mario Galaxy on this thing? That would be interesting to see.
cool
So you spent a year of your time for a joke?
"Portable Wii" he is playing smash Bros for Gamecube
but can it fit inside a wii?
How can you fit a game in such a small screen?
well if it works in an altoid can, try a gameboy advance sp
Also i need one of these in a vita shell
Can I buy $600
Very Impressive and I thought I had something cool a few years back. Check it out if you want. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJOnPkTgk94
I promoted this bad boi, really great work here!
I call witchcraft
now we NEED Wii U
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
I'm sceptical of the authenticity of this monstrosity
Shank mods,I want you to play Mario Kart Wii on this Altoid Can Wii which for some reason you named it Kill Mii.
October 3, 2019 NASA Supercomputer in an Altoids Tin
kickstarter?
Why?
Do you think it can run wario Ware?
i wanna see skyward sword! it's a shit game, but it would be cool to see it on this!
Wow this is really cool
Competitive Super Smash Bros. Brawl on an Altoids tin.
Could you 3d print a case? Could you put a battery in the case? If I want to start doing things like this where should I start?
I can barely assemble Walmart furniture with instructions and we got this guy over here making a gaming system with an altoid can
Oh.....
Wow.
can I BUY one?
this is unholy
you have said the battery last 10 minutes abut a billion times
>trim the board Okay >Put in homebrew software Hmmm >Custom pcbs for controllers Uh >putting it in an Altoids tin Uhhhhh >10 minutes battery that takes an hour to charge AAAAA >manually relocating the Nand and resoldering all those surface mount points >AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA >IT TURNS ON AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
nice job for a joke, and is playable lol
I need one Kill me
If this isn't the single best name for anything ever, then I don't know what is.
I hate it so much that I love it! Edit: wOw 4 lIkEs mUm wiLl bE sO prOUd!
Sure, you are able to play the Wii, but your breath probably stinks now....
BUT WHY
Mind blown!??
This is still EPIC! <(^-^)>
the name is the Best part
This Wii expired Sep 2018 according to the casing.
3:00 thank me later
I don't know whether I should be impressed or sorry for you
This is too beautiful
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.
This feels so wrong, but oh so right. But mostly wrong.
You can use the mints to cool it down
youre a rockstar
XBONE in a pringle's tin when?
>its charge time can last up to a about 2 dozen times as long as its battery life Kill Mii didn't fit as nice as it does after hearing this desu
Welcome to iterative engineering, dude. Now you gotta make like 6 or 7 more of them until you feel mildly satisfied with it.
4:20 music pls?
Awesomeness
Despacito
Hey, that's pretty good!
You can make this a kit on sudomod and make hella cash
Someone tag sudomod, this is genius
Run Fortnite lol
Shank, you are amazing. I've never even built a RetroPi, and here you are making something that would cause Ben Heck to say "What the hell man?" Bravo!! :)
I don’t even know .......just have fun
Worst gameplay, best game :D
KILL ME PLZ
How much did it cost to build
This is epic
Awesome.
Veri gut
I used to connect my Wii to a DVD player and that was convenient but this? :P
Who'd think this could be done. I was honestly waiting on a raspberry to show up. By doing this your gonna have alot people doing this
The casual hatred you display for your creation is hilarious.
I love it so much it has earned a spot in my personal meme Playlist
Shank for President
Wii classic edition sorted!!
* makes portable wii, uses it to play gamecube games *
That wii is suffering. Release it from her misery, kill her... She doesn t deserve so much pain...
It even comes with it's own little noose awww that's cute.
So it fits in a gba shell..
Battery lasts ten to fifteen minutes. So just a little longer than the Game Gear!
"Hello everybody, today I'd like to show off my latest project, it's called The Kill Mii" shots himself This is America
Sucks that you had to get the lcd from adafruit. I have been looking for a 2in composite lcd for a bit. They are hard to find and adafruit is always out. Now after reading your post kinda worried to even order from them anyway.
I’ve never seen a creation with such associations with the gods...
When will shit like this be on the market for reasonable prices
but can it run Doom?
Hey I love it man! I had to feature you on my website. You aren't the only one spending a lot of time working on something you hate. I spent the last 2 years on vigeos.net and now it's just become a habit to post videos on there everyday to share with my friends. It's like a community I built for my inner friend circle. Just don't have the heart to shut it down, unlike your portable after 10 minutes haha!
"We were too busy asking if we could. But we never stopped to ask if we should" - Man attacked by Raptors
Awesome
Could you donate this console to me if you don't like it?
10 minutes of battery life playing melee? 10 minutes is all I need
This should be in a museum of cursed items
Next: PS4 in an Altoids can.
This is actually cool though,
Since you said it is possible to play Wii Sports in there, I really want to see you try. I can't imagine how hard would it be to play motion controlled games when the screen is ON your controller
What the fuck
Just a little bit of sunshine and brawl would be enough to prove it can run a wii game, but what you really need to do is run xenoblade on it to show its full power. I mean you did the devils work so now it falls on you to properly display it
So how is it reading the disc?
how long does the battery last?
1, 2 kill mii please
This would be beautiful as a handheld around the size of a Switch or PSP
sick
3:20 @.@ Pauses at 3:27 shit just got real YOU'RE A MAD MAN. YOU'RE AN ANIMAL
Insert mii theme here
Holy shit.
Now for the virtual boy in an altoids can
Jesus Christ how bored where you?
Android phone also is a portable wii console lol
We’re not here yet, shank. Just wait a little while.
No M E L E E H D ?
When an inventor gets bored ???? Also I want one
Me: I’m good at modding game consoles! I once took the casing of my teal GBC, and replaced it with an orange one! Shank: I took a Wii and put it in a mint tin. Me: cries
Thug life
I. Want. It.
Humanity has reached the peak of evolution
Now that you have it in that take it out put in a wiiU controller bigger battery better fan
I'm guessing Skyward Sword would be a pain because of wii motion plus, so can you try Twilight Princess?? I fucking love this thing and want to see more games on it
I clicked on this thinking it was some clickbait life hack video... I am impressed.
how do motion controls in games like mario kart work?
Now mod a Wii U game pad into an altoids can
It’s honestly an amazing creation tho
this is the peak of human evolution, its all downhill from here
How do people learn how to make these???
Just subbed.
Sir you got my subscription, awesome
I heard the ping.
can it run skyrim
You're a wizard shank
Play Link's Crossbow Training on it just kidding I don't want to kill you
This was the most hilarious thing I've seen in this damn month hahahahaha
Could you connect it to an external battery pack of some sort so it can hold a much longer charge?
i want to put a wii into a psp now danm you and your creativity
I have more sub's but I dont feel honored to now lol
In the far future we're probably going to get a ps4 or an xbox one in an altoid box
No Johns
I don't know whether I should be disappointed or impressed.
please play skyward sword
I lo-te you
Please kill mii
May I buy it
and this is THE WORST THING EVER I want one
Why? Why not?
I fucking want this
ive spent a whole year making this and i hate it and it’s called the Kill Mii
wait. this tiny thing is a fucking wii? black magic or something??
When I saw it I wanted to die, still impressive
i dont have any words
awesome as frick
I need a kill mii
The WiiBoy next generation best quality with great metal
What a fascinating name!
Uhh i think this guy is a time traveller
So is it real or not
I’m just wondering how your playing so good like wtf
“Took a year to make”also “I hate it” nice
This is so awesome
I thought this was just a joke, and that it wouldn't work what kind of dark magic is this
Who else checked their Discord at 1:20?
LOOOOL! this is amazing!! HAHAHAH!!
Friend:Dude i have this old wii that i don’t want you want it? Shank mods:Alright sure Friend:What are you going to do with it? shank dreams of ripping apart the wii and brutally shoves its guts into the tin
I thought it was Clickbait.
Dont eat the buttons, those arent Altoids
Congratulations, I didn't think anything could get worse than the Wii U
It’s wierd how this channel started as a meme in my meme playlist
Now make a xbox360 in a tuna can
Kill mii now
so if it fits on a altoids can it can fit on a GBA
So youre saying super mario galaxy portable is now a thing?
That voice gave me kaze emanuar vibes for some reason
where did you buy the screen?
You were so set on rather or not it can be done, you didn't stop to think rather..... It should be
Kill Mii well Mii’s are pretty much dead already
You better keep making videos lol
Can u do Xbox 360 or original xbox??????
1:23 you got a message bro
Is this DespaWiito 2?
We can rebuild it, we have the technology, but I don't want to spend alot of money.
No more heroes 2 would be an interesting game to see run on this system ??
Hello everybody! Today I'd like to show off my latest project! It's called the Kill Mii
The buttons are kinda creeping me out idk why!! ??????
its a Minitendo !
The best thing I can do with an altoids tin is store my weed in it... awesome job!
now nintendo will release a new mini console version called the "wii mini" after watching this
Gotta run em All!
Wow interesting proof of concept. I think it's charm is that it's so restraining. The 10min charge. The missing buttons. The overheating. Good job!
DONT EVER tell me a company can’t do something because of limitations ever again
My God with proper manufacturing Nintendo could actually make the Wii classic mini just for money's sake
could you add a small port that carries 12v directly to the system, bypassing the battery circuit, so you can play as long as you want plugged in? then you'd need to improve the cooling...
This is so sad! Alexa, play Spiderman 2: Pizza Theme.
so what cant even run on my dads PC can run full speed in a tin? ok then
Pay me $20 and I'll take it off of your hands.
can u make it good?
How much do you charge!!
This is wonderful, great job.
I want to see you try this again but record the process. I get my dick hard by some soldering. Or don't, because I don't want you to kill yourself from the pain, haha.
The kiil mii
Ew.
You probably got more enjoyment out of the mints in the can then the Wii in the can
why didn’t u make something that sucked less
It's like a little BMO
Couldn't stop laughing after finding out it has 10 mins of playtime
Intresting name
I realize it would defeat the purpose but what if you didn't include a controller or battery, and therefore had room for a slightly bigger (maybe 16:9) screen? You'd have to hook it up to an external power source and carry a controller with it at all times, but it would actually be a sort of viable option for playing Wii and GameCube games on the go (or at least without worrying about finding a TV), especially if you added a little kickstand.
Please play wii sports and bowl on it in a public area
This is really creative!! I want to make something like this.
Everyone is talking about the project, but I'm just amazed by the soundstage of his mic. I watched with headphones and kept checking to see if the game audio was coming from my phone speaker.
This cant be real, but I want it to be so bad
Now put it into an altoids mini
Play super mario odyssey and sans fight on it just to see how bad the controls can get
I'd like to see Mario Galaxy played on this! That'd be really cool!
Next we'll find the cure for cancer in one of this guy's Altoids tins.
Stop degrading this. This is awesome.
I subscribed to Gman a long time ago, I watched this video without even knowing you two knew each other
It just need some cooling and triggers
Just because you could, doesn't mean you should.
HOW? just how????
I Think its fake why are you playing such a game?
I am so impressed! Awesome job, dude!
Can't wait for the Kill Mii 2
*Mind thinks (Realizes) Hey I can play “Dream Works, Super Star Kartz”
Does your voice normally sound so furious? Also I subbed.
but can it run wii shop channel?
But can you fit in a Wii controller
KiLl MiI...
Nintendo wants to: know your location
I came here to see the portable wii, but I ended up paying more attention on how you were playing smash bros.
Uhhhhhhh What?
But the real question is can you play mario galaxy?
This proves how much of a spectacle the Switch really is. People complain about 3 hours battery life, but to have it exist and be functional is really something. Can't wait to see what comes next.
That's so cool that works like you hacked up a wii and frankenstein it in a steam punk way
"Lasts about 10 minutes" "Takes a few hours to charge"
I've always wanted to do projects like this but I don't have the knowledge to do so. I'd love to learn though
Phone ringing Legend society called, it's for you.
Now fit it in a tomagachi
Its called the kill me
imagine seeing someone on a train or buss with this thing
EVO 2018
You should make a battery pack with a couple 18650s in plain old holders and make it look like the old school rechargable battery pack for the original Gameboy. It'd be rechargable by way of swapping 18650 when they die. ;) There has to be a dollar store Tupperware container of like shape+size that could be painted to look the part.
This made me grin from ear to ear. Thanks for doing this
Game cube X wii X MINT
This is beautiful
Your god.
Don't know why you don't like it. It looks like it's in mint condition.
Is it running 20XX or vanilla Melee?
Why the fuck not
This has to be a world record or something, worlds smallest working wii
1:22 got me spooked I panic when I hear that noise because I can't tell if it's my discord or a random instance of discord in the video
10-15 minutes charges in 1-10 hours
Now all we need is a hologram using a tin can
You sir are a legend
This is the minty pi 2.0
Oh god, Tactile Switches
Creates portable Wii Shows it off by playing a Gamecube game
Wow!!!
Can you plug it in, and play it or will it still run down to fast.
This is definitely out-worldly amazing. Great job man! ^^
But maaaannnn, what you made is FREAKING awesome, an entire Wii in such a tiny box!!! Congratulations!!
Lol. Nicely done, this is awesome.
Shut up and take my wii points :P.
I hate this but I love it but at the same time I hate it
Interesting. Is the screen the native res of the wii?
But can it have Altoids in it
Next week on fun mods to do in prison
This is fucking aweful i love it
absolute mad lad holy shit
Did you use your teeth to cut the holes?
Hello everybody, today i'd like to show off my latest project, its called KILL ME.
Do you think God stays in heaven because he too, lives in fear of what he's created? Holy shit I just realized I was the 77,777 view. Holy shit.
But.. how are you supposed to start the game if you broke the start button?
Very awesome, but the red box is bad
Now make a mini version called the Kill Miini
Not bad honestly...
this is seriously lit, epic just epic I know it isnt the best , but its the smallest portable i have seen yet lol
hope is not lost. The only downside is the fan and the battery. Get an old 10" netbook, gut it and wire it up if possible. Would be sick.
I love the name, its how i feel every day of the week
1:20 I looked to my left... Where the fuck did that ping come from.
This is horrible. I need one.
This project, as I can agree, horrible, but its unique. I have never seen such a device that small.
The fact that you have Melee in there makes me really want to watch someone try to do tech with this horrid thing
I've never been more intrigued and repulsed at the same time. LOL nice work dude!
Kill Mii.. kill me... Im not funny
Why is this actually my favorite thing?
Thats amazing. Honestly
Two 3ds consoles were risked to make this peice of shit
Mario sports mix
Welcome to year 20wiiwii
Play Oot on it
5:24 Some one had to do it so I had decided to torture myself Ah well, atleast a good product came in the end
oh oh no
Oh god
Please kill mii
I wish I could play Mario Kart Wii on the go with the Wii Wheel controls ;w; (don't hate me for using Wii Wheel controls please)
You're doing God's work man keep it up
But can it shield drop consistently?
That Wii expired Sept 18
This actually cool that you did a great job and within 10 or 20 years you can create a Portable Wii U or a switch system too
May I ask, what the fuck?
I'd love to see Xenoblade Chronicles run in ths little monstrosity
I seriously thought you had more subscribers, this is pretty impressive as well, so I may as well help you get another subscriber. Edit: and by what I mean by how its impressive is fitting such a small console into an even smaller thing with some level of playability, now to wait for a nintendo switch inside of something the size of a cigarette pack.
I love it.
Hello everyone today i show you my latest creation, the kill mii pulls out a glock
Damn... this is awesome, I was expecting an emulator but this blew my mind. Good job!
Next: "Can we fit a NASA supercomputer into an altoids can?" A year later Shank: "This is the Exploda-Shuttle"
These exist their called nintendo ds their just a glorified version of this XD
Can you modify a fat PS2
I get it. I understand why you made it. I find it beautiful though.
holy fucking shit
The GameBoy Wii Made with technology and junk from the trunk. So great! It's battery is the life support and it yells Kill Mii.
Can wii put a wii in a 3ds?
Now fit an xbox one x or ps4 pro
I’ll take 20
I can personally identify with pouring way too much time into something that you end up hating
"It's got a noose here and here... cuz it's called the Kill Mii." ded
YOU DID IT
when your childhood console can fit in an Altoids tin, your officially old
Attempts to play Xenoblade on this I imagine the thing would just explode in your hands. .-.
Sometimes we spend a lot of time wondering if we could, but not if we should -Shank
Ya know. If you made the battery last up to about 2-4 hours max I'd pay 100-150$ for this.
Play Wii Party
Scientists: trying to find a cure for cancer. Internet people: stuffing game consoles inside of mint box.
?? ?? ?? This is dope but why put it in Altoids tin ik you talked about your community thing but whyyy
How much do you have to hate yourself to make this.
Loved it so much i clicked the large red button!
"It's called the kill mii"
Could you charge your portable Altoid wii while playing it?
Bro thats pretty ZUCC
Yet Nintendo cant get GameCube virtual console on switch
This is the most amazing thing I have ever seen, so glad youtube recommended this. Also that discord notification around the 1:25 mark had me so confused for a good 5 minutes
How much.
could you program it to use the left analog stick as the wiimote and right analog stick as the nunchuk
That's is so cool....I wish I was this smart to build something like that.
I want one just to have something to show my friends when they come over. Me: Wanna see something nifty? Friend: I guess...? Me: Grins like a maniac as I dig through my drawer Friend: oh no Me: Pulls out weird af altoids tin Friend: Ummmmm Me: It's a Wii Friend: ....
Xenoblade!
Play smash competitively with this
You're a genius, bro. Forget aesthetics. It's even cooler like this... like a Mad Max case from the apocalypse.
At some point we stopped saying should we but could we
That's an extremely big waste of time
Thanks Reddit!
You were so obsessed with if you could, you didn't stop to think if you should
I can imagine being in school with this and someone either awkwardly asking me why I'm fiddling with an altoid can or ask me for an altoid and have none to give while holding the can in my hands
I died at 0:04
Next stop: Wii U in an Altos tin w/ disc drive. Kill Mii Too
You're the maddest lad of all the mad lads.
kill me
You should have oriented the screen and controls the other way and it would have been far less uncomfortable to hold and use.
A homemade gameboy that plays console games, amazing.
Can you replace the infrared sensor with just a lighter and have the fire be the infrared? I think that would really add to the experience.
This is great I mean your utter hate of the device is just comical hello from another small creator I am hitting the sub button right now good job my friend
No johns
Convince a speedrunner to play super mario galaxy or something in one sitting, as in, he plays for 10 minutes and sleeps during the charging breaks
Damn bro you need more subs. This is outstanding.
Everyone: holys shit this is impressive I thought this was impossible Shank: this shit absolutely sucks
h0w MuCH
next year we will see a commercial for this
Wii U in an Altoids can video when?
Need for Speed Most Wanted
I wanna see a compilation of every Wii game ever released running on this thing. I don't care if it takes 10 years. I just want to see the world burn.
Is this it? The greatest shitpost of all time?
I remember when a Wii portable was a laptop
That is a very pretty trash can
"THE KILL MII"
Please show off wii sports on this console
Good job??
Oh GWAD PLEASE KILL MII IT FUCKING HURTS
Dude get some 3D printed designs that allows airflow and make something more comfortable
Huh, what else are you gonna put in an Altoids tin, a GameCube!? (oh, wait...)
Made by Nintentoid
I thought it was just a Raspberry Pi. That is very impressive
That name is freaking priceless
you do realize that no matter how horrible you may think it is, it is still amazing to peoplelike me who think that consoles are made using magic
"Altoids tins hold everything except mints." -Some guy I can't remember the name of
I'll kill you if you Kill Mii.
The Gameboy Wii?
shockslayer, the same guy who made the perfect crystal version?
Oh look it's game boy micros cousin
New name: KiiWii
Kill mii plz
How can I do a kill mii
I'll take a dozen
Why my pii pii hard
Pls... Kill mii Not sorry
kinda want one just to play project m and confuse the shit out of my friends edit:well maybe with better battery and buttorn that wont give me arthritis
This is so cool, now I wonder if this main board can fit into a N3DS XL and use the controller layout better
People need to stop fucking with altoids
Wow pretty impressive. I’d like to see Pikmin 2 on it
Just 700+ subscribers... how?
Can we see inside it?
nice
Still better than the new Google phone lol
discord bloop @1:22
Wow, just wow
I’m glad you put yourself through this just for our sick enjoyment
It doesn't even look fun. I love that you accomplished this, but I can't even watch you talking about it because, as you described, it is the worst thing ever.
Next time build it INSIDE a controller
Imagine someone hacking the Nintendo switch apart and sticking it inside of an Nvidia Shield portable case
There is currently no way to officially play gamecube games portable except for luigi's mansion (unless im wrong)
So you can do this, but Nintendo can't make a battery that lasts more than 6 hours?
Play xenoblade on it
I would buy this if it was for sale
Terrible, yet excellent... Please put a better battery or im unsubscribing
Asking the only question that matters here; Is it for sale?
Wow I love the Wii, this is cool!
Shank mod Truth or Dare Dare: Make a Wii U inside of an Altoids tin Truth: Tell me the truth of if you’re making a Wii U inside an Altoids Tin
TOTALLY NOT FAKE (not clickbait)
You just proved that we could’ve had Nintendo Micro Switches
Kill Mii: The console for Sadboys
Good name lmao
how to get rsi
Can you put a gc port on it so that you do not have to hold it?
Props to you for using Melee as an example. This is amazing.
Mario Kart Wii plz and thank you Yay now I'll need a return address or a coffin if you'll send that to me I can send whichever breaks first me or a Wii from hell (there's not much a difference)
3:43 imagine playing competitive melee with this
Thanks for offering us the ability to make it ourselves. Time to put it in a GameCube controller, so it's functional.
kinda scary to see melee on an altoids tin
The box says alto but his voice says kill mii
Wii stick? Lol
What the actual fuck. I love it
1:23 Checked discord because of this
You poor soul.
IT’S CALLED THE KILL ME
you can't store a wii in such a small space. it makes it bad.
This is amazing and horrible simultaneously.
This probably will hurt alot to play
Haha. The video was released on my birthday ??
How can you run melee on a wii?
Can you show us the sensor bar in action?
Imagine this in an altoids mini container??
LMFAO! Looks like you could cut your fingers playing it. I gotta look into this PortablizeMii tho, I have some spare Wiis to FFFF up!
It’s battery life rivals that of the Sega Game Gear
Whoever held the beer you gave him when you decided to spend all this time making this creation has dropped it and owes you a keg.
Wow, nice. I still hate it but, nice.
who else thought they got a discord message at 1:23
How much???
next up: wii in a bic lighter
Wii U gamepad Altoids tin
I'm leaving earth
Probably would've been better if you made a custom ergonomic case and used soft press buttons. :/ I really hate those tactile buttons
Wii? More like Why amirite
And people spend money on the Switch. Fools.
You are really mad scientist
Great
Is that my dog barking in the background?
Looks like we have discovered the perfect device for shovel-ware It dies before you can hate the games you play too much, saving you from the terribleness of the software thanks to the terribleness of the hardware A true beauty
Looks like something out of Fallout
I had a dream of a wii knock-off console which was an actual wii but inside of a single Wii Remote with a built-in teeny screen. This reminded me so much of that.
Now this is epic
Pretty cool as a project just to see how far these case mods can be pushed. Melee is my favorite game of all-time, too.
I heard the discord sound at 1:23 and was confused. :P On a more serious note, I think it would be interesting if you could load the ".iso file" equivalent of the home menu on there, just to complete the package. :D
Better fan + better controls + better battery = an amazing, sexy wii portable
How long can it last plugged into the charger?
This is actually a cool concept, sloppy, but cool. It would be great to just make the wii hardware inside of the tin, and be able to use it as a console rather than just the portable. It'd almost be like the SNES classic but tiny and a lot more powerful. You'd probably also be able to fit more and have it properly ventilated without the controls or screen in the way maybe. Now time to wait for someone else to suffer doing that
Ill buy that for 500$.
play through an entire game on that
You should build it into a wiimote.
how small can you compact a 3ds? can you fit one in a tic tac container?
1:23 anyone else think it was their discord going off
I think you may have voided your warranty
....Build guide when?
I see too much free space in there. I think it’s high time a new wii mainboard was developed, with components scavenged from a proper wii in a super dense layout. This altoids tin thing is fine and dandy, but the altoids mini tin is clearly the endgame here.
Real quickly though, can you make a Wii U on the go with out bringing a console with you? It’d be pretty cool.
“Portable Wii” plays Melee
This is awesome
Y tho
Amazing build. But if it takes a few hours to charge, it's not charging at 1C, that's not how C ratings work. You don't mention the battery capacity, but at that size I doubt its more than 500mah. Charging that at 500ma... for an hour, should fill it, and that is a 1C charge.
your dog barking in the background
When are going to get 1 million subs
I have GOT to see Mario Galaxy on that thing.
But can you do ten perfect had dashes in a row.
Are you okay?
You really can fit anything in an Altoids tin...
Man guys shoot some hoops with the boys on their day off. This guy builds a portable Nintendo Wii
i love how much i despise, yet wish i had this
KILL MII
Holy crap! I thought you were going to use a Raspberry Pi or something like that. Man, this is impressive. Good job.
Make the battery at least 2 hours
put a wii in a first gen psp
This is so cool
Turn on the captions 0:03 ?_?
I'd love to see it with video/audio out, as well as the capability to run off of wall power. Either way, this is absolutely remarkable.
if you're looking to get rid of it, i'll take it for you
What would be better is this idea but without the screen and buttons so you have a portable wii to connect to TVs
It's cool. Why no 3d printed case though?
the YouTube recommendation bot never disappoints
1:23 legit checked my discord when i heard that
My dream of putting a Wii into a GameCube is becoming a reality
shouldve just made a mintypi lol
I like the name xD
3ds in an altoids tin when
Im just confused, is everything alright at home? (Jk, this is really sick tbh)
I love how you can tell that the infrareds aren't working or that this is all faked up as if they were you'd see light on the camera. (Try it with a TV remote or the Wii sensor bar)
Play mkw online on it or riot
That's actually pretty amazing!
Amazing work!
can it play battletoads?
Show this to zero and tell him to play melee on this thing
He could still beat me in melee with that tiny ass screen
If it's possible, put the l/r buttons on the top. Also, one way you can extend the battery life is to have an external battery.
What an incredible waste of time. You could have totally just played fortnite.
I'm thinking about making a handheld pi or ps2 without a battery, just plug it in. I'm never on a train or somewhere I would need a battery
do you think god keeps us out of heaven because he, too, so hates what he has created
Shockslayer would be proud
lmao what
is it tournament legal tho?
Wow, I was honestly expecting a shitty Raspberry Pi like always
1:22 @everyone
Tutorial? Jk. I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be to make. It would be cool if someone did show how tho.
so are the mints the disks?
You know the rule: No Johns.
Play Tales of Symphonia on that. Best way to experience an RPG? obviously on an Altoids tin
Welp...
do you think in 2 or 5 years to look back at this and maybe improve the battery life and think of ways if everyone wanted this if there were a way to mass produce these then you'd get rich off this joke.
Lol 2025 called they want their aaaaaaawqw back
I saw a twitter post about this and I thought I was a joke, there wasn’t a way this could work. Well... I’m amazed
The feel when you want really one but the only thing you'll be fitting in an Altoids tin are your entire life savings. Thanks University.
this is amazing what the heck????
atleast the battery life is pretty good :))))
Altoads
Thank God for Raspberry Pi, because this is what we'd all have to do.
Could you put maybe some instructions in the description, i'd love to put a wii in an altoids tin. Not like a portable device that you have, just shrinking the box so i can plug up an altoids tin to my tv and play smash bros
I hate it :D
Amazing work.
Kill me
I saw you post it on Reddit just a few days ago and I’m astounded you had the patience to do this. I’d have to question the sanity behind it, but it’s interesting.
Oh man
I saw you post it on reddit.
1:22 Everyone watching this video checked there Discord, don't even lie.
Meleeeeeeeeee
Your move, Nintendo.
This is absolutely the dumbest and stupidest thing that I've seen and I love it. I want one. This has actually inspired me to create, so I'll brainstorm ideas. Man, holy crap, I probably have as many questions about the hardware as I do about your motives lol Keep doing things like these, this is the kind of nonsense that keeps me smiling.
Nintendo: "We don't support emulations of our consoles." Shank: "Ok." Tears apart Wii and puts it in an Altoids can
Why could you have been the new host of the been heck show?
When you give a promise that is nearly impossible
this hurts and makes me feel, really bad inside
you sound like broccolipoisoning
You should consider redoing this or rewiring the current board into a more realistic/comfortable Wii mini, perhaps model the controls over the classic controller or GCN controller.
I know this is irrelevant to this video, but the audio is great. I though the sound from the Kill Mii was coming from my phone despite me wearing headphones. You bamboozled me real good.
Can it run project M?
Grandma puts a sewing kit in a cookie container, Grandson puts a Wii in an Altoids tin. I love it, amazing work.
ShockSlayer? As in Pokemon Crystal Clear ShockSlayer??
I want you to make me another one for me
WHYYY
I commend you for your efforts!
"It's called the Kill Mii." Hey, I'll take seventeen.
Everyone thought about if they could, and not about if they should.
If you played it with it plugged into a charger could you continue to use it indefinitely with out killing the battery ,like a phone?
Play House of the Dead Overkill, House of the Dead 2 and 3 Reaturn, or some other light gun games. I'd love to see what happens.
But the Switch cant run N64 full speed yet ????
Dude, why? This is too funny.
Holy WHAT
As cool as it is, I’m not a fan of using custom OS’s for projects like these. That’s the main reason why I didn’t like other projects like these such as the Varia Cube or the DS-inside-a-Game-Boy-Advance. I guess I kind of consider it cheating.
"Its called the Kill Mii" a intro to out beat Zombieland Sega
Fake. I can see the aftereffects editing.
I love this
My favorite part is all the jagged edges around the screen
commentary is a bit lacking. saying the same things twice for example. can't you just use a better battery? why play Melee instead of Brawl?? didn't even show it running a Wii game. I think it would be a good idea to do another video showing a few Wii games, show how the motion controls still work.
what the hell, that looks amazing. not the worst thing ever by far.
Play Metroid Prime 3
Make one in a tic tac packet
people in school be like "Nibba why you pressing yo altoids"
the name is ironic
I'll buy it
How could I start learning about this stuff? I would like to be able to do things like this ??
Kill Mii
The biggest plus is that on such tiny screen the graphics look AMAZING
How come when you guys make portable Wiis and want to show off the Wii gams, you only show off the GameCube aspect of it and play GameCube games? Aren't there portable GameCubes that can be made as small as a Gameboy nowadays?
The message beep at 1:23 confused me so much.
The Wii runs at 6W? That doesn't sound right. Everywhere I've read says the Wii pulls around 15W at full load, and the Wii U pulls a little over 30. A typical high-end smartphone pulls 5-6W, and the Switch pulls 9W undocked. *e: spelling
That discord notification at 1:23 fooled me
What is this "community" you keep referencing?
Wouldn't even get passed the first cut scene in sunshine
Do wii sports
But can it run Crysis?
????????? ??????
Metroid Prime Trilogy. God save you trying to play Prime 2.
try playing fire emblem path of radiance or radiant dawn on this thing
BAN THIS SICK FILTH
Speed run Mario 1 before the battery dies
ily
Y I K E S
10 minutes of play time, several hours to charge. I love it.
You're a pioneer in a field not well known.
Sick, like melee
It's completely useless but I'll be damned if it's not the most impressive mod I've ever seen
play that wii sports sword fighting game on it
I didnt think inanimate objects could know death. But now I know they can crave it.
So when are you gonna run a long JRPG like Xenoblade or The Last Story? /shot
I’m surprised the start button broke off instead of the any a,b,x,y buttons lol
I'd say it's a nice proof of concept. With a better form factor, this could be something not as horrible.
In a dystopian future this could be the only portable gaming module on Earth.
Awesome! Thank you so much for sharing it with us, OP!
But can it play Despacito?
This upsets me deeply.
1:22 I checked my discord...
This thing is fucking awful. I'll give ya $10,000 for it.
It is.. the best thing in r/diWHY
I've never seen a man spend a year creating something of his own volition, and hate the outcome with such conviction
Why do you do this to yourself?
Genesis/SNES in Altoids mini?
For some reason, listening on my headphones, it sounds like this thing is right in front of me. Crazy.
The virgin Nintendo Switch vs. the CHAD Kill Mii
"Kill Mii" sounds like the name of homebrew made to stress test a Wii.
Wii Classic Edition prototype LEAKED!
I want to compliment your mix set up. Listening on good headphones on my phone I literally questioned if my phone was playing the game music but your voice was in ear. Fantastic audio.
I hate how this runs smoother than some modern full scale gaming consoles >:(
Absolutely top notch shit post, sir
Show us Wii Tennis on it. And, if it's possible with homebrew or virtual console , it would be hilarious to see a GameBoy game ran on this thing.
Try New Super Mario Bros.Wii or Mario Kart
I'm working on doing the omgwtf trim on an old spare wii I have. I'm thinking about trying to stuff it in a wavebird. Also: this is hecking neat, but also terrible. Thank you for doing this so no one else had to.
Came here from reddit, good job that's pretty neat lol.
Nice Video that is an amazing portable Wii!
the mixture of pure genuis and pure insanity
That Wii seems to be in mint condition to me.
Impressive that you were able to win with those controls
play wii sports resort
How is the Wii board that small??
KillMii... I'm going to need a really tall ladder...
I think I should make a Wii laptop
what a lovely name
That is crazy, I love it
This is so awesome dude!!! really good work <3
Thought I was slightly insane when I heard Discord go off at 1:22. Great portable though.
CEO“Make a handheld capable of running full console games” Programmers “I’m sorry sir that’s simply not possible” CEO “SHANK WAS ABLE TO BUILD THIS IN HIS HOUSE! WITH A BUNCH OF SCRAPS!”
You can convert some claw grips for phones and make it horizontal to get an even better load-out
Fit it in something the size of a calculator and u will be rich!!!
this doesn't look easy to use. Couldn't you play some 3D game like super mario galaxy? That would make it seem a lot more awesome than some 2D platform game. You probably didn't because it's hard to use these controls for 3D
One question: "Why?"
This is just a genius project.
This is so fucking stupid. I want one.
Did anybody else check for a Discord notification at 1:24?
Would like to see two people try and play a multiplayer game at once on it
Can you make a portable wii fit?
how just... whoa this is amazing also now that this is finaly done can u do some more videos
Tech Heresy. The inquisition will be at your door
What the fuck, this is so ridicu-- ?'?? ???? 10
thanks, i hate it
Can't wait to go to a tourney and hear "Alright, you're on setup number Altoid Tin"
100th comment
thanks, it's terrible! excellent work, I'm legitimately impressed!!
Dude we gotta get Steven to try this
Blue tin can master race
Tic tacs next
Minted
Your move Nintendo, Wii Classic Selection on Switch when?
Thanks for taking my request ;))
How did you learn to do all those I'm very Interested in doing this
tfw you create something so blessed and cursed at same time
This is a fucking nightmare... I love it!
I love how this guy can make a portable Wii yet Nintendo can’t even put a simple virtual console on the switch. Nice work
I'm here from reddit and Holy shit
We're really living in the future
Play Twilight Princess
I would love to see Skyward Sword on this thing
Idk if you read the comments but I'd like to know how much this cost to assemble. Its awesome
Amazing.
That's cool, but the real question : Can it play Doom ?
I despise you, but love you at the same time for creating this abomination...10/10 good video
"Alto: Curiously Strot"
A joke that took a year to get to the punchline. Bravo.
Yeah, I have a question... Just...... why??
I would've appreciated if the disc was halfway inserted in the tin and spun vigorously.
absolutely incredible, i'm losing my mind. i hate it so much. please play guitar hero wii on this.
Watch this actually get used at Melee tournaments now
Smh not even a cinnamon tin
That is amazing! I love that you actually did it!
Are altoid tin gamecube controls tournament legal?
Ok this is epic. Great job!
Thanks, I understand how Luddites feel now
title claims this is a portable wii but you’re playing a gamecube game smh 2/10
Play Smash Bros Brawl on it! Also show examples of using wireless controllers like you mentioned (Wii remote, nunchuck, Wii Pro controller?)
Introducing the New Nintendo Wii XS
Bonkers. Absolutely impractical and useless madness. Well done. Now take my money! ??
Try Mario Galaxy on it or Wii Party
can i buy it
I want it
The only true way to play melee.
"You were so preoccupied with wheather or not you could do this, that you didn't stop to think if you should."
sonic adventure 2, can we go beyond sonic memes with this jank-ass system
I didn't hate this until you played Melee on it. Unforgivable.
Is that the new Raspberry pi?!
This looks like a huge headache to make LMAO great job
Nice
Can it run crysis ?
9:00 "Am I allowed to john about my controller?" No, just learn the matchup. Kappa
Why ?
As long as it can play the Kung Fu Panda Wii game it'll be a worthy investment.
absolute mad lad
This is actually insane. Awesome.
You should make one, but use a Wii u game pad as the case, I think that'd be cool
does it get hot enough to cook an egg on
does it have DK bongo support?
It's... It's beautiful
Underviewd
Take this to a tournament
Nice.
This makes me want a GBA version, or even a GBC version... WiiBA anyone? WiiBC?
Can I just ask, are you ok man? You really sounded like you wanted to end yourself in the video. Granted you called the project the Kill Me so I suppose it speaks for itself.
Thanks I hate it
please play metroid prime trilogy
i love how much you hate this
This is the most ridiculous, yet most awesome thing I’ve ever seen. Good work!
This man almost lost to a level 1 Kirby
but the real question is: can it run doom
"Can it fit into an Altoids tin?" Yes. "But should you put it in an Altoids tin?" Absolutely not.
0:33 I thought there was a dog barking in my backyard at 2 in the morning
"Hey can I have a mint... oh wait"
This is amazing. Would you consider putting it up for auction?
This is a war crime
everything about this is iconic
Still better than a ps vita
I'll trade you a psp
I wonder if it's possible to add a better battery/fan. Portable compact Wii sounds fun.
ill take one in the tangerine tin please
here before this blows up
Glorious
"You're Batshit Insane" RADN, 2015
Here is the wireless charging pad I used: https://amzn.to/2K1ZdJU It has a longer range than most others I looked at.
he should be a narrator his voice just gives me that vibe
who gives this video a "Thumbs down"? Thanks so much for the awesome video!
I am really impressed with the tool , and fixtures you have for each and every job...from cutting, welding to holding and measuring... Lots of money invested ??
Sanki uzaya uydu yolladin amk
That was the coolest thing i have seen in forever!
Step 1: Go Portable Congratulations on your new desk!
this desk came out way better then i thought it "wood" XD
It takes a life time to master something but seconds to mess it up
Next build a desk with a hidden GUI that turns on when you open your house door and shows details like the weather, like the one way mirror effect that the GUI can go through but nothing else can be seen
Love the table top, that walnut wood is amazing.
Beautiful!!
I am not a welder but I welded at work and asked a pro if he had any tips for a greenhorn he said he moves the tip in small round loops moving from right to left it keeps the flow smooth and even
you had ~120k subs during that video, now 312k subs. Must be doing something right!
You should have tried putting a thin piece of a metal sheet the same length and width as the table surface and see if would allow the phone to charge anywhere on the table since metal is a good conductor then maybe the surface area or the wireless charger might extend.
Great video one tip to prevent tear out with circular saw use a Stanley knife to cut the wood along the length of the cut first
Same phone
that is super cool!
Well done!!!!
I don't understand a single thing he said but Woah
You should make your own company man??
awesome! well done
Get the end of the square tubes cut at 45° angles and weld them together, looks MUCH cleaner in the end
The charger idea is awesome! nice work
Wow man you nice tools they all brand new
Beautiful work, I've subscribed - been looking into building my own desk before. So this has given me some inspiration.
just amazing!!
SO I can put a wireless charger under almost any table and I get the same thing ??????
Great Job. Congrats
By 1:50 I was already amazed. I've never seen how boards are "made" before. Thanks!
amazing content. thank you
Awesome..... Love this video.
3:46 Epilepsy Warning.
This is my first time visiting your channel! And now I'm a subscriber!
Nice now I’m sub:)
very nice video man! It might be fun to make this for my garage :D
Awesome!
This video was recommended to me and I had to watch the process... immediately subscribed as soon as it ended. Solid finished setup! I have to say I am a bit jealous of your table.
Super amazing!! ???? Great work
Thanks !
can i put a hole in my ikea desk and do this
I would've put my channel logo instead of the bow tie to give it more of a custom feel
Amazing idea great work ??
Yes
A tip on welding the joints (if I'm suggesting bad advice, welder folks, call me on it). If you're just getting the hang of welding, don't use a constant feed of wire. Pulse it. Feed enough wire to create the pool diameter you want without melting through the metal, release the trigger long enough to shift your aim to the edge of your pool (at the 6'oclock position, or wherever your weld seam is going), and repeat. Weld, stop, shift, weld, stop, shift, weld, stop, shift. You'll get a consistent pattern that you won't have to grind away because of the ugly.
Good idea but you need some carpentry 101. Worst joint for a top is glue only. It will not last and will warp cuz u didn’t seal the wood underneath. Have no idea why u wouldn’t use kregg pocket hole screws since u have their rip cut. You also used wood floor poly and applied it with the worst and cheapest .50 cent sponge brush u can buy. this causes bubbles and air pockets and does not get into the wood. It smears it on the top. You also never put it on raw wood without at least a wood conditioner first. U never use those. Lambs wool applicator only for oil based. So many other rookie mistakes from tools to wood prep. And FYI, that’s a Ridgid laminate router. That why it doesn’t plunge.
Dope awesomely done ...
only welding tip i can give is to take a rotary tool and smooth out the beads for a solid and smooth flow of the material and then, of course, paint the frame. other than that this is absolutely amazing!
The 1K dislikes are iPhone users
Man that desk turned out really nice.
How much for the desk?
What router bit u used?
Quick question, how do you like the Rigid thicknesser?
Watch this, and i hope i can built it !! Great job man !
so you say that normal wood glue is enough to hold such heave wood together ?
First time on your channel, loved this video and desk!! Definitely going on my to do list.
Hey that’s awesome build me one lol I need a desk for my computer and keyboard
Lush. +1sub :)
earned a new subscriber!
awesome table top and love the charger idea but it needs some wooden legs or sides with a set of drawers, the metal frame just makes it a little too sterile for a home but fine for an office
?? ??
What was your total cost, figuring labor and everything?
Great work brother. I loved the, oh and dont weld your clamps to your work! Lol, priceless....
This thing is hot.
Can I just buy yours :p
I need a good desk.
awsome tutorisl and build
or just use a dock
very pretty desk! nice work
Nice :/
You are so nice and so awesome dude
This is absolutely stunning!!! Awesome job, awesome finish, awesome look. ??????
I bet this guy likes to make stuff.
this is too awesome! Thank you!
First time seeing your channel and I really liked your progression through this job. I wish I could do this myself, love DIY
Does everyone got those tools to make it ? Or shouldn't be the title written as '' How I '' instead of ''how to'' ?
d00000d you are nerdcore! awesome
Very entertaining and informative. When you tested the phone charger and it worked I hit that subscribe button so fast lol.
man it was funny when u said let me know if im doing something wrong, man u r pro ! u should open ur own company ! im the first customer !
Perfect desk. Then he covered it in plastic? Plastic? omg. :D
If you make another one put some kind of circular inlay where the charger is.
beautifully entertaining and the workshop is sick!!! I subscribed!
NEARLY 300K SUBS
You have a awesome steampunk mask! Very noice ??
Well there's something I'm never going to be able to do. Very cool though!
id love to have a custom desk but I suck at/ don't have the tools for this kinda stuff :/
Why not set in brackets for the wire and charge pad or a sliding board cover to hide it incase it malfunctions? Easier to take out instead of trying to rip it out
This desk looks really good. I'd love a L-shaped one
nice vdo I like it
This can be used for new innovations. They can have it implemented in coffee shops, pantrys, restaurants etc.
a true diy build taken to the next level . great job !!
I had no idea what you was doing or what you was talking about but this was very entertaining and now I’m wanna learn more and start building stuff. So much knowledge man! So impressed!
This is by far the best channel of all. amazing video thank you
It was awesome idea
Make sure to hold the compound miter saw blade down after a cut to avoid kickback
Make more, and sell them please. I would seriously buy one.
Bit of a broad question, but as someone with no experience or power tools at all, does anyone know some easier first builds or things I can try and just build? Or maybe some previous videos that would help, this guy seems very clear and direct (yes I’m new here haha)
Ask about your spray paint where can i buy it ... ?
Hey! I’m bored let me spend a few days to charge my phone! Or I can just put it in the charger ??
Dude that desk is gorgeous :o
How many others here are jealous of this guy? Great work sir. Love your shop.
6:21 - Great trick for those of us that don't (yet) have a plunge router!
Heck thats a gorgeous desk
That is sick!
Woah, for the welding, never weld directly on concrete, it could explode from the heat especially if you are doing more than a couple tacs
Hey big fan of u. Please make video on how to make standing adjustable computer desk please
Or you can just not do all that and charge your phone like normal human being ^^
So damn cool!
This is amazing
Great video man
?? nice desk
Awesome job
Rock star status!!!!!
Awesome job!
So much creativity!
Amazing idea and even better execution!!!
Only you need a Nasa machine
DAMN SEXY.. Question will the sealer keep the copper from oxidizing?
I love everything about this, especially the simplicity
I HOPE STARBUCKS HAS TABLE LIKE THIS TOO!!!!
coooool
Wow...I mean, just w.o.w :O
This is tight, but I would have made a large inlay for the wireless charger and used double-sided table to keep it in place. That way, when you inevitably get different sized wireless chargers, they can all fit in the inlay and be easily removed a la double-sided tape!
You can buy them the wireless charger coil itself :P duel coils even! Fast wireless charging :3
lol i was the 2,000,000 view
FEWTEL 4 life!!
Iam going to have to check that charger out. I have issues with my current one with just the "moment" case on the phone.
Wow that's something that I would love to have. First time on this channel n love that table.
That is a super fantastic desk.
Now that is called innovation
Uh way too much for me. But nice concept
20 watt fast charging pad would have been nice Stick a TEC module under the bowtie and you can chill and heat drinks on it
How I wish I was a man
Apple would steal this and sell it for $5000
what a beauty! I want to buy this table from you
A desk is cheaper than all that gear ??
Do I always need to plug the wireless charger?
I guess Im gonna do it on my cheap ikea desk
Okay so are you using a mig welder? Because it looks like you are and I think maybe trying your hand at arc welding might help improve technique because mig doesn’t penetrate as deeply as it could. So maybe try to try a hand at arc welding and practice laying it down where it penetrates deep enough to really weld together because if you can’t break it and pull it apart you know you are doing something right
If he put the copper above the wireless charger he would have gotten a stronger charging base for his phone .
dude, that was awesome
"get yourself a hubby like this" haha
Hello do you have any DIY videos on how to build a recording studio desk? If not, Can you do video on how to build a recording studio desk, and add all of the measurements that each board are cut? Please help me because I am on a budget right now , plus I am trying to buy me a couple Mac computers. Thanks Mr Robert!!!!
Smart idea man
Great build. Only thing I see that would be a problem for me is that the charger is placed right where the mouse tends to be. I would have placed it more in the back, or maybe to the left.
Very nice
I thought the whole desk was going to have wireless charging, as in, you could place the phone anywhere on the desk and it'll charge.
I thought the start was an ad
Suddenly got an urge for a workshop so I can just mess around doing man things all day
Bravo!!
Wish I had the tools and materials to make one of these for myself
Hello my friend I'm a carpenter and I really like the idea of a wireless charger built into the table. I would like to build this, but there is a small problem. 1.) what kind of wireless charger did you install here? Brand and Model? 2.) How did you determine how thick the plate may be between the charger and the phone? 3.) how thick is the gap now between charger and cellphone? 4.) Have you tested whether the mobile has previously charged faster with the charger than it now charges with the built-in charger?
Yall want to know what the only thing i like about ikea is?! Its how they perfectly wrap a rug up and put in wrapping and you get it home and your just waiting for that wrinkly ass carpet to come unfold partially and takes about 2 years to get flat!! But nooo it unflolds into a perfectly flat rug!!
woooooooooowwowwwwwwwww super cool
I need this table so bad...
F*cking amazing brilliant idea.
Hey, does it affect how fast it charges? It seems there’s a bit more gaps between the phone and the wireless charger and I’m wondering if affects that much.
Wow bro
Absolutely beautiful
if your getting a lot of popping in you weld it's probably because the vacuum is sucking your shielding gas.
so nice table! are you willing to produce and sell it? it has way better quality than others online
Great video, I would have used a ferromagnetic metal like mild steel instead of the copper bow-tie and place it inbetween the phone and the charger to increase the charging efficiency
Anyone know where you can buy walnut in these dimensions? Looked everywhere and people think I'm crazy lol
This was a great video. First time I have come across your channel and by the time I was half way through there was no doubt that I was going to subscribe. One of the things that made me like the video so much was your vulnerability when it came to your mistakes and being new at welding. Made me feel better about the silly mistakes I do during a build when I saw yours. Definitely made you relatable. So I’m now going to go binge watch all your vids lol. Thanks for making these
i thought this was cool, began thinking how i could get wireless charging in my desk. Then i remembered i have an iphone 7 :(
My uncles job is welding
I guess I’m one of the very few people in the comment section that actually has the tools to do this. My father is a construction worker and has a workshop in his garage.
What if the charger breaks
Thanks for the video, very well done sir
Fantastico, tus trabajos son fablosos.
what happens if the cable goes bad?
Hot gluing the charger in may be a good long term solution, but if it breaks down on you how do you get it out? ??
when mig welding make sure you use splater spray and two there are two types of mig wire flux core which i would use does not use oxgen to shild the gas like regular mig wire needs and three always keep a pair of mig welder pliers near by they come in handy at times three the clamps u use in the vids are use in my shop for setting every thing up and getting it squar and then tack weld they are not very good imo for full welding
Great Video! This is a DIY project for advanced builder.
Cool
Everything was made very great... but I didn't like how he glued the wireless charger to the table. I think it could be done better than that. in case if you want to replace the charger.
You should sell this
i just got out of prison and the halfway house. im trying to get back in the design mode and work from home. if you could help me get an awesome desk to start my venture again. i would be utmost grateful forever! ive been working hard at min wage to save enough to get my own place. i move November 7th
Awesome very cool job!!
you must have a hell of a lot of faith in your charger
Wow.
Me: Aww that's simple. Goes to Ikea picks up a linnmon desk and buys a wireless charger. Cuts a hole in the desk and places wireless charger inside. Places phone on charger. That was easy!
well done??????
Could've made the charger removable, in case you'd ever need to replace it. Still, awesome build.
with so many tools, you can make a rocket.
It would hav been cooler if you’d put that copper thingy as placement for the phone charger, but idk if it would hav interfered with the charger.
Woah! That is one cool idea!
Just subed to tyou. I love channels like this. You have a great voice and you give awesome descriptions to what you are doing.
Wow,great job????????
That was awesome.
This guy is a genius! :)
‘New’ HAHAHAHA ????
Nice job
This is my first time watching one of your videos and it will definitely not be the last! Great stuff man, keep it up!
GREAT video. Will Patreon when I can. Also, would love a list of your shop tools. Thank you!
Will this work with my Tesla?
Enjoyed watching the process, also that's an awesome end product.
Great Video man ,thumbs Up !
Fantastic workplace and what you re doing there, one suggestion is to interact with your video more :3 great work
I need this desk!
Pic axe flying of atk
this is AMAZING!!!!!
Best welding tip i can give u is learn stick weld before any type of welding. Ones your pro with stick welding you can weld with any machine they throw at you and it's easier for you then
Wow!
This video was so satisfying to watch.
Really liked this video
this is dope I like it!!! sub? ??
As a chinese, i have to say cool
Welding tip: please stay with your welder a few seconds after ending welding above the glowing metal. This makes better joins, because the hot metal is still reacting with the oxygene from the air. Because of this, your welder is always releasing some protective gas a few seconds after ending welding (as you can hear). Just wait until the sschhhhhh-sound disappears
What's great about this is if you don't have access to a wide variety of tools you could still buy a table from a store and just install the wireless charging pad. Great video!
Subbed! It is a beautiful thing to see the work people with talent can do. ??
easy tip for the welding part. only use the magnets for tacking. youd be surprised the difference not having them can make on a full bead, especially when welding right near them.
you should rename the title How to Build a Wireless Charging Desk...If You have a Full Shop
Dude, you've got mad skills -- Thanks for sharing !!
good video
Hey Brad! I have to say you did an amazing job and your finished table looks incredible! I can't wait to see more of your projects!
Imagine if Disney did this on the tables at their parks...complete magic. Great video!
Wireless charging bit starts at 6:16 Copper inlay starts at 7:42
You have a ton of tools man
that was amazing maaaan ...Subed right after watching this :D ...keep up the good work ;)
Very nice work and both simple and great idea! I will use this video as an inspiration for my new wood projects.
Hard working??????????????????????
??????? ???????? ???? ?????????. ??? ????? ?????? ? ???????. ???????
I would have made the charging socket removable to update to a better wireless charger or just in case it fails on you one day. It's gonna be a pain to unglue it and tear it out.
Nice work mate
Do you sell this amazing product??
Do you take on jobs from your subs ?
You are probably as awesome as your craftsmanship. Kudos bro :)
i NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED this.
Awesome
A great idea.
This desk is amazing and your inlay came our really awesome!
making your own stuff is always worth it to watch. Nice job you did there.
You should sell them! I’d definitely buy one off of you
nice
My dream is to have a workshop like this. First time seeing one of your videos. subscribed
I don't think I'll ever be able to this but it's awesome
Everything fine but putting hot clue over charger is messy and you can't reuse instead make campartment to hold charger in place.
Amazing
Supercombo gostou
VERY NICE.. It's also a first to see the polyethylene bring out the color like that. Hour Glass nice touch, too.
I would have sawed the copper into two triangles and placed one above where the phone goes and one bellow the phone with the arrows pointing towards the charger area.
Oh is so cool.
Geil
this is awesome, however, i would recommend a less permanent solution for mounting the wireless charger and the cable so you can replace either if need be
This dude deserves more subs and attention
First timer here, awesome video... subscribed of course!!!
06:11 thank me later
Nick Offerman would be proud of this video.
I wish I had a workshop like that, amazing
I still think it's more practical just to find a nice desk you like, and to buy the wireless charger separately, but this was a cool project.
I have a welding tip Don't set your house on fire
I made this too, it's amazing, thank you!
Who does not think that when he cut the wood. That it was satisfying sorry bad spelling
FTBT: Give me some welding tips to make me better me: uhhhhhhh. be better?
Awesome build, really well done. The only issue I could see with this is with the wireless charging aspect. Wireless charging isn't an "on/off switch" like plugging your phone is (where it either charges at full speed or it doesnt). Wireless chargers charge at varying rates depending on how far away it is from the phone. For example, your phone without a case directly on the charger might take 2 hours to charge. Phone directly on a charger with a case might take 2 1/2 hours to charge. Phone with a case through wood might take 4 hours or longer to charge. Just thought I'd point that out! But the idea is sound and the execution is beautiful.
For my future son ????
Awesome
I've always been a fan of woodwork, as my grandad was a carpenter. I unfortunately won't ever have the space to try this hobby myself but your videos help me get my fix haha :) Very cool idea and the result was amazing
Thats grt. but I would not opt for gluing the wireless charger as well as the cords. what if tomorrow they dont work and I need to send it for repair to the manufacturer or I need to replace. I cant replace the table everytime !!!. But its a great idea and will surely implement it in near future. Also million thanks for no ad breaks.
Very nice. Wireless charging is a misnomer because a wire runs from the charger to the power outlet – obviously. But with this method, the wire is hidden and there is no visible pad or station – I like it. Secondly, this can be done with most solid wood table tops, you don’t necessarily have to start from scratch. All you need is access to a router (I suppose it could even be done with chisels, although I wouldn’t trust myself to get a consistent depth). And the Anker charger is probably a good choice: well-known peripherals manufacturer with a solid reputation. I’d be a little bit worried about temperature – these chargers can get a bit hot. Perhaps a slightly bigger bay and a different method for keeping the charger in place? And I probably wouldn’t have bothered with the inlay: you know where to put the phone. But that’s a question of personal preference of course. Well done!
Awesome!! o/
Greate !
Problem is I don’t leave my phone in the same place long enough to charge ??
i have to say your head is full of awesome tricks.. good good good job man
awesome
Man people do love their glue huh... I hate it cause its messy, I refer to take some time and design a proper holder
It is amazing.
whats the overall dimensions of the desk?
This is my first time on your channel... You've done an amazing job, especially showing some of your mistakes along the way... It's a nice way to learn and a great way to show your subscribers that it's okay to make mistakes.... Peace! Greg W.
W0W!!--> 847 haters that probably cant make anything -.-.. I love how creative people can be.
wow who gives a thump down to this?
This is amazing.
this is a great idea for a table. Being different from you however, i would most definitely knock the phone off when using the mouse. Luckily for you the emblem you inserted into the table can work if you flip the table the other way round so that the charging part would be at the top left and not the bottom right.
Me: watches video Me 5 min later: goes on amazon and orders a regular wireless charger.
Very nice.
Walnut looks so good
How much would you say the desk top weighs?
Definitely gonna make this some time into the near future, *Saved into my projects to do playlist!*
I thought this take me WEEKS to help my dad make it but we only finished in 19 minutes!! Thank you now my phone has a cosy cottage and it will live there FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER HEHEHEHAHAHAH just thank you
This is awesome.
Pretty cool!
That was a beautiful video ??
I've had this idea ever since wireless charging phones became a thing. The only problem is that I have never owned a single phone with wireless charging!
As someone just starting out as well, where did you find all of your gear? I know it's not cheap stuff and how did you afford all of it at once? Or, did you get cheaper stuff to start out and then upgrade as you went?
awesome dude
If I'm not wrong if you don't align the phone to the charger almost perfectly it start overheating (which is bad for the battery ofcourse), i would recommend to sign the shape of the charger with some sticker or sign.
I'm a retired carpenter and this is the best youtube clip of wood work I have seen, for not talking any crap, doing anything stupid, or taking ten minutes to say what you could in one. HOORAY AND CONGRATULATIONS!!!! Well done young man.
Sub
Sud and like
Now. You can buy an iPhone Xs Max just to put it on your table and shoot a video.
So beautiful
amazing, dude
I love ur work man, love the table...I love you man..hope to have one of this in the future
Good job!!!
I love your videos
You need leg Protection
Where can I buy this
Honestly i want one X
Check out chuckE2009 for welding advice. He does a good job of in depth coverage. Table came out very nice. Thanks for the idea
You should always wear long pants when welding, the light can give you skin cancer
Wow
How much would you charge to tach me how to do this?
this was on my recommend glad i decided to stop and watch :), only issue i had was why did u glue the charger and cable !! could of used a switch pin or somthing so u could replace it in future if required:P but love the work
I wonder How much did you spend on all your power tools?
Cool vid
So awesome. Great job
"This desk came out better than I ever imagined it wood..." Punny haha
Corner clamps save lives!!
Lol this wireless charger would take so long to charge the phone.
Awesome work!!!! Great video
Ooooooh It was a bow tie? I thought it was the Black Widow thing. ??
Well, now I wanna get a phone that supports wireless charging. And a sh!tload of tools... And a workshop.
4:45 I'm also learning, but I welded the exact same material for a racing sim arcade, a table, and stools for said table. The welder who was helping me said that you don't need to keep going back and forth or side to side, just keep pushing the puddle, don't pull it along as much for this thin walled stuff.
HOW MUCH TO BUILD FOR ME?
Why only 1 charger?, I would have used multiple wireless chargers.
I am seeing something that I can never build
that's so cool , i like it!!!
Dude!! You got some serious hardware over there
after watching this, everyone suddenly wanted to build their own desk with wireless charger
I guess all that equipment used to make it, is really expensive
First thing i thought: Dang thats nice. But i bet my cat would love it even more since they push things off the table
Next episode:HOW I BUILT MY HOUSE
This gave me a boner
I'm a bit late but everytime u finish welding snip off that ball of metal at the end of the wire
Super awesome video!! I wouldn’t be able to do it but it was really cool to watch!
Nice!
amazing
That gold MacBook though....I need the deets lol
Hmmmm.... this is nifty.
i would buy one of those!
I was cunfused for a moment because of the copper X. But then I realized, you didn't glue the copper on top of the wireless charger but a few inches to the side of it xD Otherwise the charger wouldn't have worked, I guess
Does that charger work With the Samsung s6?
Amazing desk. Hope to see more of your work!
I'd bet you already know this but one of the best places on youtube to learn welding is weldingtipsandtricks , the guy on it is a great welder and teacher.
Just buy a 80$ gaming mousepad
that you get a signal doesn't mean its a useful signal... wireless charging has the same issues as cabled charging, as everybody knows that too long a cable will crumble your amp current massively, like cut it in 1/4.. the same with wireless when you put things into amongst the signals will take its toe... so you should have checked the charging quality... after all ex 1amp are great, but 0.25amp will make it close to useless and take forever.. and both will give the charge status signal... anyway nice craftsmanship.. impressive.
BEAUTIFUL work <3!
wow..... my mouse moved,clicked and subscribed on its own....sick job dude,love the color of it and the nice and simple metal frame. welldone!
if we place the cell phone any were is it charge?
Loved this video man..
Nu!
what device did you used to paint the primer
I came for wireless charging desk, but watching the woodworking and craftsmanship was awesome! subbed :)
That plug to his YouTube channel was so clean
First time to the channel. Subscribed! Execellent video!
D
Beware of ruining eyesight with welding
wat if the the wireless charger gets hot while changing ????
Are you a joiner
Don’t weld strait into that extractor at it can actually suck up the spark and keep the ember glowing this could hit previous dust in the extracted box or bag and could be severe I’m only 15 and had it happen to me
Subbed
Love the build! Your channel is top notch! Hope to meet you someday!
Let's turn this into a business. Want to mass produce these with me?
So its not wireless if u still have to use a usb port
That is one legit desk, love that built in charger. maby built in usb next?? O like a powerstrip?
SUBBBBBBEDDD
Love channels like this, subbed
I think it be cheaper to go to IKEA lol they sell desk nd tables with wireless charges
ABSOLUTELY beautiful my dude.
First time here and glad I watched it. My question is that can I buy that type of table from you? And how much would it be with tax and shipping? I would love to build it but I'm not trained in that area and rather not take the risk until I know how.
Damn, it's perfect idea
Can you tell ikea to sell that desk for RM 300 or other currency
Thx for that great idea, don't know how I got here but I am glad I did.
I want your desk ????
That is beautiful man! Absolutely beautiful
sUPER IDEA
Subscribed. Can u make this for me? How much would it cost
Love it
Beautiful desk. Maybe one idea; maybe use velcro to mount the charger and/or something that is not so permanent for routing the cable. Just in case the charger goes bad you can always replace it. Amazing job.
VERY VERY NICE
Wow nice man, the next table i make my self the for that idea.
Could you have used the copper bow tie as the marker to place the phone on? Charger wouldn't probably work right? But if it was just a plastic piece (3D print?) that it could serve as the actual place to put your phone on. Just thinking about it.
really good... i like it
i have no idea how i ended up here, but please make me one when i move out!!! this is amazing
Is anyone gonna do this
oh he sexy
good job bro, you have now a fan
build a pc in the table
awesome job and the indicator is awesome, so much room for ton of ideas :D
nice
can anyone sub to me?
This would be a cool concept to use with a wireless keyboard and mouse
Woah thats a beautiful desk nice work I am jealous
Awesome. I wonder if the wireless charger gets hot or charges slowly with the extra thickness of the wood
Amazing I gotta do this to
Hey yo how much for this table,I'm like wowww...if I had it right now would've been amazing ????????...by the way good job,you're good man..??
It’s requires loads of equipment’s N props and more importantly loads & loads of patience . I’m not up for it
Am I the only person who watches these types of videos knowing I'll never do this? ????
This is awesome! Creative, and it makes me want to take up wood working!! :) Thanks for this! :)
how did you finish the legs paint powdercoat etc?
Definitely doing this to my nightstand.
Hey you got yourself a new subscriber. This was fantastic!
Nice desk
Seeing that it's soooo hard, I rather wait until when apple releases a wireless charger ??????? I'm sorry Edit: there is already one smh again?? Edit 2: not apple
Great video man! Greetings from Costa Rica
Easier to pick one up from IKEA cheaper too !
Nice work
Fix This Build That, you have inspired me to utilize the wireless charging routing on multiple tables in my home! My issue is that I am not handy at all with building so if you could list the type or drill bits or any other tips and tricks for a newby, it would be greatly appreciated! Please and thank you!
Fix This Build That, I am planning on doing this to multiple tables in my home now.... what drill bits are you using? I am not that gifted with building so any added instructions or tips and tricks for a newbie would be greatly appreciated!! Please and thank you!
U really inspired me u got a new subscriber
Got my sub and like buddy. What do you do for a living, YouTube? I guess i mean to say is that super bad ass shop for content creation on this channel or is carpentry your day job, because if your a newbie and its all for youtube my hats off to ya bud. Ether way it's inspiring to see thanks.
That is GORGEOUS!
Well done! Looks great!
Cool????????????
This was tooo good
Hey man, what Notebook lies there on your desk?
The first time an ask to subscribe worked on me.
Watches video... Me: already has a new desk Also me: Makes new desk just to charge phone that doesnt support wireless charging Also me 2: buys new phone to go with wireless charging desk that'll replace current desk.
Awesome!
That’s hard to build all of that
This is actually cool as hell it looked amazing great job ??
What a great video
Thank you so much for the insparation. Also, cool desk
I felt you can sell this desk for like 1000.
Beautiful work
nice project mann.. well done!
This is something what we have to use in the future
Awesome project.
This desk looks awesome. I've bought a desk grommet style Qi charger years ago, but I've never gotten around to drill that hole for it, because I just can't imagine always having my phone on the same exact place laid flat. Which is to say I'm changing the layout of my desk "clutter" way too often to keep dedicated desk real estate free of anything permanently for charging purposes.
Im surprised you went all thru that process before testing that it works through that thickness of wood. Lmao Anyways good job.
Welding and grinding with shorts. You brave man!
Wow ,love this vid .. I know i cant build this one ,i dont know woodworks .. But i enjoy watching your video man .. Thank you love lots
Great idea.... looks great.... I'm a welder learning woodworking, you can really come up with some great stuff when you combine those 2 skills. I'm also a self taught blacksmith... 1 tip when squaring up when tacking, use the biggest square you've got. And also measure the diagonal. When tacking, 3 tack welds per joint, in a triangle pattern. That will make you tacking is really strong and less chance of your parts coming apart.
I loved nothing as much as the way you do things , cleanly and properly
Hello, I love the desk! What were the end dimensions for reference of everything? (Long, Deep, Tall of the Metal Tubing; H x W of the Walnut)
imagine if the charger didn't work from there lol video over. great video
great video this makes me feel productive
you remind me of seths bikes hacks
I don't have all of the tools for this, but how much would you sell and make one for me?
I'm new to this channel but great video
Lets be honest No one try this...
you need to do 1 smooth pass with your welding
Hey what was the final size of the table?
HolyMadness! ??????
bahhh.. I can take it or leave it.. seriously nothing great to see here.. just the usual run of the mill stuff !!!
I it just me or building videos are way more fun to watch then anything else
Next time, check out Belkin's in-desk wireless charger, especially made for people like you: https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-B2B180/
what are the dimensions of the wireless charger?
From where dis you get those magnets ?? Which you used during welding
Wow thats crazy
wow!!!!
#kind a crazy project, congratulations, beautyfull work :)
NICE ????
i would buy that desk!
Walnut woods looks amazing, I didn't think that
man what an awesome craftsmanship it is..what an idea...it is so amazing..
Brilliant. Love your work.
Now what happens when that charger breaks? You could have oped for an easier replace system there...
Amazing boss.
You should try to integrate the internals of he Logitech wireless charging mousepad into the desk so you can never run out of mouse battery
Practice welding
I like the idea but 3 recommendations: TIG welding, Adjustable height feet with no full box lower section, and just because it says it's charging doesn't mean it will charge very well. You should check the charging time. I recommend taking the charger out of it's plastic case so that it can shed some heat and you can get it closer to the surface. The adjustable feet should be mandatory for any hard floor surface. The TIG welding might seem difficult but trust me, when you get good, you get great where as MIG will limit you on projects. Nobody ever learned to TIG and then went to MIG except to mass produce. Great desk! My idea from years back was to use optical recognition, find the phone and then with an x-y stage under the desk, move the wireless charger to the correct coordinates. I never did it because my reward is in the feasibility, less in the doing. I'm a planner :)
Although I did the same thing for like $137.47 with a ready bought desk lol
UR GARAGE SO BIG!
Beautiful !
You are cooooooool
god i wish i had your tools drools
When you said "thanks a lot hope to see you around" I actually thought the video had ended and quickly scrolled up from the comments to make sure, for that split second I felt disappointed lmao. Safe to say I have subscribed, I like what you achieved
The magic charging desk
You just gained a subscriber, I cant believe its the first time I come across your videos. Awesome work!
what kind of wood is that?
Sure I have those equipment (wood cutting tool and welder) laying in my room. NOT! But it still an awesome video and great tips and idea. Love the wireless charging port idea even though I never use it.
You just got a subscriber
very wood excellent wireless battery iphone XS PLUS
que muy hermoso el escritorio, con cargador de carga inalambrica? gran idea, disculpa si me la copio, excelente video, saludos
zajebiste
very very kool!!! amazing what one can do when you have a brain!!
Great idea
Won't be using the desk when you're in hospital getting the tumors removed from your abdomen.
Thanx ! , you have inspired me to make 2 bedside tables for my wife and I built in with Qi charging. I used a charger with 3 colls for better results and it works great !! no more loose cables and free space on the bedside table. Thanx, gr Oscar
Great job!
Man, you did all so tidy, so accurate... And then u fokin glue the charger with a stick glue... Arrrghhh...
when you say subscribe i just subscribed .
Is the bow tie, itself, symmetrical?
First of all, amazing project. Second, it might not have been a good idea putting something of metal next to a magnetic field.
Very nice skills
Awesome video man!
Thats lit
I love you video, not just by your nature of work but the way you presented your video. It's very informative.
You're Awesome, thumbs up for you and your team.
This video wants me to make one of these lol
Instruction Unclear. The desk burned
This really gives me a few ideas for the project I'm going to be working on soon! I dont do tons of woodwork but I want to create my own desk. I love a deep desk (~33 Inches) and I cant find one that I want to buy, so I'm going to make my own! I dont know how I'm going to do it, but I want to add a large mousemat sunken into the desk, and now possibly a wireless charger. I am trying to think of how I will create the legs though, as I dont have the tools for metal legs, and would rather have wood legs aswell. If anyone has any tips, I would be very appreciative of them. I need to make this sturdy to withstand a bit of a beating without collapsing.
just found your channel subscribe!!!
when welding always try weld down, use gravity to let the blob run
Great work man...  Looks awesome!  Thanks for sharing!
Smart work dude...
That desk is beautiful, I was a little skeptical coming in to this video, but you blew me away. Amazing work!
sweet
Just started watching your videos. I like what I have seen so far. Any chance you could do a project like this one, but show the work WITHOUT the power planners and routers? I know it's more work, but not all of us have the tools and it would help to know what techniques we can use. Thanks! :-)
Great video love that desk
good idea
chisel and hammer is best
Amazing! Super job!
8-Bit guy will hate that mounting.
Nice
the copper inlay kinda wrecked the look
I like custom desk. Are you giving it away or selling?
Love it
are you using tip gel for your welder you just dip it in every once in a while keeps gun from balli g up with slag.
Make more videos. I see you from St. Petersburg, Russia.
"just finesse it"
That is a awesome looking desk. Love the video.
????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This is awesome man. Gives me so many ideas!
Beautiful Desk bud.
That copper inlay would make a great touch sensor for a lamp! (if it wasn't place next to the user's had area) If you are interested you should take a look at touch sensors at adafruit and sparkfun!
This was the fastest subscription I have ever made. I was literally 5 seconds into the video and I subscribed.
It will caught on fire
Talent
Your workstation so clean. No dust anymore
pretty awesome man
Awesome video! First one I see, can’t wait to see the others!
How thick is the wood between the wireless charger and the phone?
Bravo
em, the product of your sponsor isnt good, is it / the table looks super used already
Just a tip , in ur table u used the spint wood its the lighter part of the table it looks giid but its not good to use its mutch weaker then tje original wood the spint wood is on the outside of the tree the weekest part of it thats why bugs en insects made holes in it
It would had looked pretty good if painted it white. But cool video anyway.
This is soooo freaking cool
Beautiful brother! Love your shop too, wicked jealous!
That's pretty sick!
awesome! u inspired me! props!
You should do a wireless charger bed side table
You've made my mind invented table??
I just like your video. BUTTTT im so lazzzzyy I envy the crap out of you for that shop n brains hahahah Great futuristic content man
Great video man... thanks for sharing.
loved your project.
what phone do you have??
do you think we all have these Maschines...........NO we dont so pls just write how i made a .................
for myself, this is very difficult to do, requires special skills. but this video is very interesting to watch and finally I like this video. also provide a little inspiration.
He did all this just so he can charge his phone smh.
Fix This Build That  what cover do u use for your phone? Looks grt. Send me a link pls.
Size of table
wow this is amazing! keep up the amazing work!
I like how your mind thinks. Good idea with the charger, and I agree the metal bow tie accents the table great.
I'm definitely going to look into building this be use I'm always at my desk and my phone is always with me, it's just nice to have a fully charged phone sitting next to you when working on stuff
bro i love the looking of this desk
You should really smooth out the parts and edges of the metal you cut so you don’t cut yourself. It really hurts.
Been thinking about building my own table with the same feature! But since I don't have the more finer tools, I thought about making an overall "rough" look but with built in charger. You could easily sell that table for 1000€
I gave you a thumbs up for completing a great project, but I won't be buying another new phone any time soon just to get cordless charging. ;¬)
make more of this table i would buy one for 165 dollars
really great videos mate :)
Love the video do more like this ????
Niceee
y u glue the charger
Well, I like what I see. Hitting subscribe
Thumbs up if you re too lazy to do that!
You need to manage resources
this is perfection
this guy bring his hobby into the next level, lmao. good job!
Bro ...you impressed me
That was amazing.
awsome
You earned a new sub!
Now i want my own house and build my own workshop (even though i don't have the smallest idea how to build stuff). Great content, new subscriber ??
Thats awesome
Why I don't feel capable to do those things?
I don`t know why I end up watching this guy at midnight but i love it :D :D
I love these types of videos
I subscribed right after this video... just epic work
Just wanna let you know you got your voltage up a bit high on your wire welder and when you grind your welds you don't just want them smooth like you would with lumber but you actually want to blend them to your weld. Good job for a beginner though! also invest in a gas/oxy torch they're inexpensive and the practice is goodto have.
Awesome but I don't have time to do that never.
Amazing. Those 10mins flew by.
And all of a sudden I wanna make a desk
OMG! I would really like to have a table like that!!
love the desk would love one like that but with out the charger man its nice
Just like Gran Torino taught me "WD-40, vise grips, and some duct tape. Any man worth his salt can do half the household chores with just those three things.”
I know I'll never bother trying this things out, but still I watch so much of these kinds of videos.
Why didn't you make a perfect hockey puck sized hunk o walnut to fill that unsightly gap under the desk ? Kidding - very nice job.
I'm gonna have to do this! I'm remodeling my office and going to build a crazy one-of-a-kind 86" long desktop. I also want to do the "River look" epoxy top. Do you have a video on that?
one word............ SWEET
Not sure if ever tried the green tape, but I prefer that over the blue. Lastly, why decide to go for round qi charger over the rectangle ones, which I prefer....as they "fit phones" better. Regardless, not bad. & glad I ended up stumbling to this channel, as this first vid for me. L8R, A
Is this black walnut? Also, assuming your putting the crown up, right? What happens if you can't cuz of knots, or other defects, etc... Is it okay to put crown down! Awesome looking table & pretty cool of the qi charger built in! Cheers, A
You got in my good books.
Well done greeeat job
this is so clean!!!!!!
Awesome job, the table looks great! The only thing I would have done different is mount the charger without hot glue in case it goes bad, perhaps a small wood bracket that screws in place.
Nice job
do you take orders lol
I like your work i am adam
That's a good Qi charger; I have to take my hard case off my phone for it to charge. To have your phone charge through 1/8" of walnut plus your case is great.
What can I do to get me a man like this?
Nice And Great!!
god dam awsome
Samsung s8+
Makes me want to start woodworking and metalworking, cool vid.
I most go to the toolshop.
the new wireless charging? hasn't it been around for years?
Wow, what a craftsman.
Well done! Liked and subscribed!
So so awesome! Love the inlay!
amazing....Loved it
It's all fun and games till you cut off a finger cause you been drinking while building the table.
is this wireless charging work any phone?
A beginner eh ? You sure ?
Looks great! Nice job with the inlay. These are not a criticism, just ideas: You could try to hide the front piece of tubing by setting it a couple of inches inside of the front edge. I also think an inlay with more contrast would look cool - perhaps aluminum?
nice
I had this idea like 6 months ago. Unfortunately, I don't have the tools to make it.
Your "is this your first time on this channel" sounds a lot like Kati Morton
Gotta say you are an excellent craftsman. Not trying to hide your mistakes and ask for help learning how to improve. Thats a sure way to become a real master at your craft. Awesome job and beautiful desk.
Bro, curiosity is about to kill me. Please, what is the laptop you put at the top of the desk. Brand and model??
Does it charge in any area in the table?
you should get a bit for your router that has a bearing on it so that you can make a guide piece with the shape you want to route and just slide along the guide piece. I don't know what it's called in english but we use this all the time at the woodworking shop i work at.
You welded better than I did in high school.
Omg is working Thanks
Brad: thanks for another great video! Your work is amazing and I love how you’ve stretched out and tried something new! I look forward to you next build!
Very cool! ...and innovative. I aspire to be as creative as you in the future!
Great video - thanks for sharing
Love it mate good job!
There's companies out there working on wireless chargers right now that you just have to be within a few feet of them. This a great, the desk looks amazing.
I love your table but if wireless charger is more great, but thank you
dont get your face in the weld, dont breath in the smoke. you should learn tig.
what phone case do you have??
Great build, walnut is always a winner.
So cool man!
I once build something similar but put the cable into the leg to get it down to the floor without being visible. Since your legs are already hollow that shouldn't be a problem.
I would have put it a bit higher or in the middle
it's simple.
Awesome build
Take a shot every time he says "I" jk. you'll probably die
I made myself a table too, a friend of mine works in a carpenter's workshop and they had linoleum table leftovers, I got them for free (180x80mm). a normal one would be about 400$. I took an old frame from my grandmother, sanded it down and made a powder coating
Lets just ignore the fact that 99% of the people watching this don't have access to all these tools
What phone is that he has??
I love how this guy gives us the instruction in detail like we're actually going to do this ourselves
You have 10+ minutes video and you didn't add any ad break, as a youtuber i would say that's awesome :)
liked the idea, good job man, keep up the good work. SUBBED!
awesome!
you will make more money starting your own company Mr. McGyver instead of wasting time making videos. for sure.!.
Great video. Nice to see real men building stuff. Keep it up.
Just discovered your channel. I've never been into wood/metal work, but damn, I think I may have the beginnings of a new hobby. Fantastic video, you've got yourself a new subscriber!?
insane
that wireless charger idea was great.
Brad what a fantastic build, and congratulations on your induction into the WELDER league; that is one beautiful 210MP!! Bad lil mama jamma of multi-process power....can't wait to see you rock some TIG with her. I build a mixture of wood & metal projects, so it excites me to see you delve into the welding aspect of your projects.
damn, thats really cool
lol, just cover a wireless charger in camo tape, problem solved!
I have none of these tools
??????????!
everything was so perfect until he glue that charger....
I wish that you didn't hot glued the charger in as the wireless charger might broke off over time. @_@
Wouldn’t like to be paying you by the hour.. And yes the glue is strong enough to hold the join.. dowels , dominoes prevent splitting or warping in the top when climate changes.. And also why did you not use the cross cut fence on the saw to cut to length? Far better than your slide saw.. no chip out with a g5 blade or similar.. Nice product at the end tho
Wow
Awesome
Nice Commentary ??
I'm a little sad you didn't polish the inlay like it originally was, but still an awesome desk.
????????, ?????? ??????. ?? ?????? ???????? ??????? ?? ?????
Would the wireless charger have the same efficiency while charging the phone through the slim wood?
Hmm great idea for a meeting table for cliënts
I like the fact that your workshop is clean as heaven.
FLY charger on the DRONE over cloud go back in my room 4 all divces 100% wireless. It's Gonna B all time all weather GOT it?
All wireless charger is not 100% wireless
Great job sir.
I’m not even interested in this sort of building things but this is cool??
SO COOL GOOD JOB
Question: Are available for custom furniture sales? Cause I'd buy that table
cancer desk XD
Great work man !!! Subby subed !
7:25 is what turned me into a subscriber. :) looking forward to seeing more of your videos!
Nice Project ??
I just discovered your channel with this video. Your channel is amazing dude ;) :D
Amazing video! Not a handy guy here but I find it so interesting how you can build something so practical and modern. Would love to see more of these ideas ??
this was in a word awesome, love the wireless charging part. I got an old desk I like and I want to put in a flush mount plug usb combo. just need to get the hole saw and order the plug. You know how that goes.
Am i the only one who thought that you could set your phone down anywhere on the desk and it would charge?
Was that mig welding?
How thick can the table be for letting the charger charge through it?
Share norm ground qlkmrc gradually lovely die admire evident hope scientist study.
this is so impressive...
wow. This is so cool even though I had a different expectation when I clicked in. I thought you would make a table that phone can be wireless charged anywhere on the table!! Would that be possible?
This is so cool!
Respect
First time watcher, loved the video. Immediately subscribed. Happy building!
Probably the most creative thing I’ve seen on YouTube in awhile. Good job!
2-3 wireless charging pads would of been nice. Future proof it from the get go!
Hold my beer gotta go find a saw
Just wow
I think the copper looked better when it was shinny but good work can I have the desk I want it
wow this is great work!
Me: That doesnt look harddddd gets ikea table 20 hours later ME: AHAHHHH WHY ARE THE TABLE LEGS BACKWARDS
Don't weld directly on concrete like that, it will melt
This was really cool to see, Good work and good job on this!
This takes me back to this old house
Rlly appreciated the fact that u didn't ask to subscribe at the beginning of the vid
Lazy man's guide: Step 1: Buy a desk. Step 2: Drill into the bottom and fit your charger. Done.
first of all you have to buy all those tools
2x??
You're a beast dude.
pretty sure you are going to get some eddy currents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) in that copper --- sapping some of your charging capacity. Might not be enough to matter. One way to check is to do an amp draw test.
well done, the wood machines doing great
How to Make a Desk with Hidden Wireless Charging 1. Buy tools for 250.000€ 2. ... 3. get to ikea an buy a cheap desk
I don’t have a phone that uses wireless charging but this just looked so cool
Should we be looking away when your welding?
great job I love it
saw this yesterday, ignored it. But found it again today! Great job!
These has to be industry standards now
I want One
Subscribed and liked,... Gwenndolynn
Ok you probably heard this when you bought the welder but welding tip, i make small circles when i weld and the beads come out quite nice
Make sure you push your weld
Beautiful desk
subscribed, loved the pace the result and the lenght of the video, im starting to learn all kinds of crazyy stuff with epoxy besides woodworking, i wanna soon start with metalwork too, nice job
Are you Flip Rodriguez's brother? You look like him
This is the first time one of those "Don't Forget To Subscribe" plugs actually worked on me lol something about watching woodworking its satisfying haha
Saw this in my recommended and loved this video, you earned yourself a new sub ??
Omg I love this channel
Killed it brother!! Congrats on the mil!
Nice video, Thank you for sharing.
I said this before you did it, but don’t use metal clamps where your welding, I learned that the hard way
I subscribed!!
Is something I can purchase
Love the look, but I am not insane.
Not a big fan of combining metal with wood especially tables but you did a good job. Congrats.
sick!
Just subbed .. this is amazing. I just bought a house and have so many ideas :) this helps
Nice you have a drive and a very creative mind and you are the most productive youtuber
Aa if someone would do this.
Usually this is totally not my ballpark, but this looks incredible. Forwarded it to my brother in law cuz he goes bananas for this stuff . You sir got yourself a well deserved sub!
It destroyed my mind
First video I watched of yours and I was in awe, simple sleek design with a great modern look and functionality with the wireless charging is clever!. I bet a table like this would be well over $1,200 if sold online just because of that!. Beautiful piece and inspiring me to try my hand in some wood work.
More than the work I love your attitude.. hard to find such down to earth people today. Keep learning and keep up the great work!
Bro... what d :O in simple words AMAZING CREATIVITY.. SUPERB WORK... this is the perfect video i came across on youtube... keep it man.. u got a fan plus a subscriber :D
What is the wireless charger is broken How do you replace it?
Beautiful work!
Don’t know how I ended up on this video I was watching a video from my teacher sent me but this is a great video keep up the good work and nice job explaining everything in detail i am definitely going to subscribe
Such a clean work. I love it ??
You're not worried about the charger heating up with it being encased by wood?
Interesting, now get out of my recommended
Hey Can I buy that....It is Awesome Brother...subscribed.
when your welding mild steel don't put the fume extractor so close to the work because sometimes it can take the shielding gas away, also you don't really need a fume extractor for welding mild steel.
this is so cool!! i know close to nothing about wood work and i learned a lot just from one video :D
this guy seem like he has OCD
Or take any old wooden desk cut a small place in it for the wireless charger and a little path for the cord to be plugged in
This vid is from I like to build stuff with bob
Wow, now I suddenly have the urge to build one myself! The table looked incredible on its own, but the polyurethane really brought out its character. You just gained a new subscriber - also noticed you are also very close to me, I am in Dickson, Tennessee - just 30 miles west of you. Keep up the awesome content!!
Your smart????
Beautiful desk great skills
That's a great table man, I'm jealous lol
You're very talented bro. Keep it up!
IKEA taking notes!
well damn, this is a very nice professionally cut video with some great skills there, something that I would use to trust you with any projects I have in mind (if postage wasn't costing more than your hard work.... no offence but shipping really bites into the planning portion) You lay it out so that students can easily follow along at a pace that can keep it intereting, you even put it onto Youtube, so the students just write down timestamps and come back to it at a later time. Keep up with the hard work, I'm not someone that works with wood or metal but I can say that you're someone that I can learn from if I feel the urge to make something with my hands or use you to make something I want. I do love how you done the plug with sponsors and nudge with subscribing, it was seamless and it shows us that you will be happy to use them in a practical sense rather than just for the extra money. As I was typing I got a confusing delivery from Philips, 2 downlights (connected to outlet plug), T-shirt and a baseball cap.... one of the most unexpected and strange deliveries... but anyone that gives me clothes is a friend of mine, inside was a contractors book.... I have no licence therefore I can't play with anything beyond 48V DC I am very confused
Welding tip #1 don't look at it #2 weld the object not yourself
idk how this was recommended to me but damn dood, great video. Subbed!! love to see what else you do
i dont know anthing that your doing wrong but you awesome
That was pretty damn cool.
Amazing work! True artistry!
Why didn’t you put the bow tie underneath the position the phone goes in like horizontally? Love the channel!
all those tools, damn i dont even know the name of of them, so amazing job,
What if we don’t have $30k of tools and equipment
From what I remeber in welding class it's better to do a circle motion
I realized we were out of are depth the second he had planks in his hand
Would you make me one? I need a desk with wireless charging comparability! I could buy one online, but I’d love to support you! How much do you think it’d be?
Isn't it dangerous to have a hidden inductor in a table
Fantastic bro
Nice
is it bad that when he was about to weld i instinctively turned away?
i was worried you were gonna put the bowtie ontop of the wireless charger wich would have ruined EVERYTHING!
blood sweat and tears..........perfect????
Wow, awesome video man! You earned my subscription!
Subbed! That desk is stunning! Nicely done!
I just came to this channel the first time and I love this channel I subscribed and road to 200 K Subs
First time here, this was amazing! also you explained things where a complete noob who's never done anything handy like this. Can't wait to try it!
Or you could just glue the wireless charger under your desk
fire hazard?
that was satisfying
i wanna buy it
Awesome project, i really like the hidden charger feature as well as the materials you used.
Welding tip: Dont weld your clamp
i wasnt going to do this but I enjoyed the video
First timer, sold and subscribed. Cool skills and nice vid. A+ on the work. Keep going
You can get better at welding by not welding your clamps??
Subscribed and loved great work great tools great guy you are looking forward to more videos
Hello, i am a beginner. I would like a plainer and welder all that good stuff. For making stuff like shelfs and tables. What would be the best thing to invest in? Machinery wise
Even my carpenter doesnot have that much no. Of tools
im not a professional myself but your welding is not bad :)
That's so cool
you mentioned something about buying lumber online. What places would you recommend and trust?
Nice build
That’s so cool !!!!!!! I want one ??????
Thank you for sharing this DIY. You could have sold your idea to make alot of money but your didn't.
i need this, perhaps gonna try make one
I would take the Wireless Charger out of its plastic housing.
Love the desk! A suggestion i have is to velcro the wireless charger instead (and run a tape over the wire), so that it is easy to change if ever the charger spoils. Would love to have this in my future home!
Well golly, now I gots to build me that.
play minecraft
GET THIS GUY TO 200K SUBS!!
Hi @Fix This Build That. I think it would better if you build a bracket to hold the wireless charger instead of glue it. If one day the wireless charger malfunction you could replace it.
Wow, great work. I do some wood work my self too (hobby) but you are on whole different level. With that kind of tool's it pure pleasure.
This is amazing dude! Well done! ??
Genius!!
Thank you very much im going to make my desk like this too
I love it !!! ??????
Man, the table you made looks way better than the tables in the market..loved it!
Oh!? Is this your sideline Kevin Love while on vacation from NBA? nah!
Does it work with the iPhone X ?.
Wish I had your skills!
This video is like too too cool! Thanks youtube for recommending it.
Well but then you won't be able to carry your wireless charger with you anymore!
Great ????????????
You ever think about making those tables to sell? Besides the charger obviously but I'm.... less then good with my hands when it comes to building unless I'm cooking lol and I'd love one of these tables
ah its amazing!!?????? hey...can i work with you in this workshop?? pls.??????
Love when the sponsor fits perfect to your video. Its relevant. More like this and great job!
Your videos are awesome.......
Amazing
Nice keep making tutorials it helps
I hope someday you make desk for pc or make pc case from wood ??
your a handy dude, I will learn from you. thank you
This was an amazing process to watch and the ending was so satisfying you got my sub!
AllOfASudden
What if your wireless charging pad broke? How do you intend to fix it or replace it then?
Or, just duct tape your charger to the underside of your not-too-thick table? Duct tape fixes everything!
2:24 some nice little buttholes
doesn't the copper bow tie interfere with wireless charging which is based on copper wire electro magnets creating a magnetic field which charges a corresponding electro magnet in the back of your phone? I feel like that would interrupt much of the magnetic field and thus the efficiency of your wireless charging.
Your welds are fine for your project and over time you will improve on the beads themselves. Just be sure that when you weld your tacking first and then checking for square and not just laying down a bead.
I want to buy this desk so bad. Great work!
Sell this desk to me its sooo nice
Man that is a beautiful desk my guy. I used to do woodworking in High school but now I'm getting inspired and want to get back into it! If you haven't done a video yet on Infinity Tables I highly recommend that. I made a rudimentary one years ago, but I get the feeling that you could make an AMAZING one. Anyways awesome video and I look forward to seeing more cool projects.
I don't know too much on welding, but woodworking is a love of my life. If you ever want very circular circles with the router, cut the size hole you want with a hole saw in a scrap piece of wood, clean up the cut, and then use a pattern bit for your router. It has a bearing on the top that is designed to follow a pattern or template, which is useful for what you were doing here, or things like mortising hinges into doors. Freud Pattern Bit: https://www.woodcraft.com/products/freud-50-101-pattern-router-bit-top-bearing-1-2-d-1-1-4-cl-1-4-sh?gclid=CjwKCAjw8O7bBRB0EiwAfbrTh0Kj32OaHImPcJkTrmnW4FGI93C_tl3vRSjfmp7vGd6wowFkd2HFthoCnl0QAvD_BwE Either way awesome project and awesome thoughts about the wireless charger intergration!
I might suggest putting some smooth masonite strips on your tablesaw outfeed to reduce the kick up you are getting when ripping your long boards.
Wish i could buy this! :-)
Saw this in my recommended list, and its the first time youtube has actually put something entertaining for me to watch. 100% subbed bro, keep up the great content.
Can you make me one? lol ??
Woah.
Damn Dude you are amazing
You got a sub from me guy this was dope
It might “work” but the efficiency is probably horrible and wireless charging already takes twice as long to charge than it would with a cable connection.
this is actually really amazing and creative well done :)
wtf same phone same laptop same mouse
nice
con todas esas maquinas yo tambien lo hago
Idk but can you make a table for me??? I’m really interested. But if it’s ok with you or if it’s even possible can you try with the Apple air power that may or may not be coming out this September. Name your price and I’ll pay.
This was so satisfying to watch
The only way to get better with welding is to practice, so get some scrap for free or cheap and go to town trying different welds on different metals, and then if you mess up or it looks ugly it does not matter. The plus side you can recycle your metal and make some money back, or cal it art. lol
Absolutely beautiful table. This was so awesome to watch. Love how you incorporate your tech desires and your woodworking/metalworking skills.
thats what she said. 1:02
431 people dont have wireless charging phones i guess...
SO AMAZING!
First video I watched for some reason it recommended me this. Pure pleasure to see it from start to finish. Great work
It's really cool idea! LIKE!
Wow
It would have been alot better to use the "timeglass" shaped thing right over the wireless charger so you would know where to put your phone. I dont know if that might interupt with the power from the wireless charger to the phone.
That is sooooooo cool I love it so much
Love it. Always want to do something like that but have no space for all tools
Great job!!! Subscribed!!!!! :)
best diy that I'd ever seen ??
The woods stick strongly together because he uses flex glue
This is absolutely stunning! Literally a work of art, I would pay you a lot of money to make me a desk like that
Liked the video SUBBED
As a carpenter i know how tricky these things can get. AND BOY did u do a great job mate, Nice work :D
Awesome vid man, subscribed ????
I want wireless charger in my hand! Make a tutorial about that ;)
real quality content. rare things on Youtube tho. Keep up the great job.
sick idea. the metal inlay just finished it off so nicely
but remember not to put any metal inlay over the inductive charger, it wouldn't work anymore! just a tip
i would have bought that table if i were from states anyway you got a subscriber ..good work ..
SUB!!!
My mans not worried about splinters or nothing lmao
Looks soooo good! But you need to have all those amazing machines! :D
Nice dude!
i want to build something awesome too
Cool
welding tip don't lick it
I would have made the charger a lot simpler to exchange in and out. Just in case after a few years the charger shits out, you can easily get a new one. But then again, making a whole new table in 4 years is probably a turn on for you. Regardless, I subscribed and thought this video was insane. I'm 23 and am already nostalgic for my old high school wood shop. Your set up is just why I want a house someday. Love the channel, man!!
SUBBED
subbed great video great explanation!
You should make and sell. That is a cool desk! Gives me some ideas! Thanks Brad.
This is absolutely incredible work. Never watched a video like this, but I have always been interested in this stuff. Top notch vid!
I know I'm never going to build myself a table but I really enjoyed this video
I don't know a single thing of what you're on about. However, it was interesting, lmao. Good job.
I subbed before even watching
Well-Done
Awesome
First video I've seen from you and it was great. Subscribed!
Definitely subscribed! Love that idea ??
Good lord that is a beautiful desk!
I need one of those ! ??????
cool video. great table. 99% of diyers are not gonna have all these tools you are using.
cancer me
What you did was pretty cool. Great looking desk. As like a couple others that have commented this video was in a recommended list and I clicked on it. Definitely subscribing
with a mig gun you dont need to move in circles or anything. it does it for you
Dude
Cool ???
Awesome!! Liked and subscribed!!
Ikea wants to know your location.
Nice job...
Awesome!
I am so jealous. I wish I was this handy.
790,520 people out of the 790,524 people watching this wont be using this information or attempting to do any build similar to this
Im confused how a wirelss charger works if the phone isn't touching. Or am i dumb?
Gg.
That looks fantastic!!!
Sadly wireless charging is super inefficient and wastes lots of potential power :(
That was A1
it would of been pretty cool to use a wood inlay so the inlay marks the exact spot
New subscriber here. I'm enjoying to watch this video a desk with hidden wireless charging! Very cool idea! Congratulations, Fix This Build That!
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE TURNING A LAPTOP INTO A DESKTOP MMMMMM
SO WHAT IF I WANT TO CHARGE MY PHONE IN THE DINNING ROOM OR KITCHEN, NOT THAT I OWN ANY OF THOSE ROOMS., MY CURRENT HOUSE(ROOM) IS ALL IN 1. BUT, WHAT IF ?
Love the vid and the accent!
very nice i almost made it
What kind of phone do you have?
Yup, this is definitely awesome. Good job!
Well...there is quite alot of big machine to make it.. in my house only have drills and a saw Lmao.
Great work man. Keep it up ????
Very creative. Very well done brother. I am subscribing
so you are wearing a helmet to protect your eyes from the spark but decided to bombard our eyes with a light thats brighter than a thousand suns... dude, I am blind!
Great work! Looks clean.
What the....... Glam table mate. How much in total all your equipments are worth.
New sub here ! Nice stuff and clear explanation. Liked !
Set it down, literally
Great work!
Who watched this knowing damn well they’ll never build this? Edit: Dang, first time I got more than 1 like on YouTube, tanks y’all Edit Edit: Only 35 more likes to hit that 1 thousand likes milestone. I love all of you (:
Superb .. I need a furniture maker now ????
Absolutely gorgeous desk!
I feel like a way to hold the charger and not glue it would be a better bet cusz what if it stops working you know, ive had a wireless charger stop working so id not glue it and stay on the safe side
oh yeah it was workd
Next challenge put a gaming mat in there
Beautiful looks professional
This is un copyable , i dont have all that tools , even the glue
So cool. Love the ingenuity.
good work
This is beautiful omg ??
That`s cool idea man.
Beautiful Desk
Would definitely buy it or make it if I had the equipment
God, you make me want to go into carpentry now, lol
That's amazing, plus you have all the tools you needed as well.
New subscriber here. Love the channel and always like to see new ideas.
cool vid
Youtube unsubbed me from you, thats bs
Absolutely gorgeous desk! Great work!
I'm always skeptical when people put metal frames with woodwork, but it really brought this whole piece together. The metal frame and copper inlay bring a nice modern look to the wood!
sorry but i dont want to microwave my balls
There is a desk with that features here in our country in Oppo Store.
Amazing video and quality! Subscribed! Keep on the good work Brad
Is this desk for sale?
Wow, amazing
very nice work
I think it'd be easier to find the wireless charger by marking it with a clean outline or a symbol directly on top of it, but hey, I'm not a woodworker ?????
Upgrade your mouse.
I want also put a charger in my desktop But the charger that you usses seems a little bit cheap to me Can je plss help me with some tips with the right charger Btw im from the netherland So don't look at my grammer
5:20 ????????????come on dude
Amazing workd dude, really amazing!
Great video!
Impressive work. Will the surface of the part of the desk that holds the charger be fragile? It has a hole underneath it after all. Any chance that it collapses after you accidentally smashed or hit it really hard? It is not really possible to happen but I am really curious about it.
Nice video! And really nice table!!! Wish I was as handy as you!
You've gained a new subscriber!
amazing video~~ subscribed after 3 minutes into video
God bless YouTube recommended, I'm now into ants, circuitry and speedcubing.
i usely dont subscribe to new found channels but i like what you did here. You earned another sub. Great work!!
can you makke a video on every machine you have that is relevant on wood work ..and leave a advice on how to do wood works
You could just tape one under your desk
awesome!
you just earned yourself a new subscriber
This is so cool
you should try making a table with holes in it, but fill them with coloured epoxy so it looks niceer
Hey man you did a great job. Brilliant idea. ??
Hrrrr i ate you, you are to Talented, but i Love it !
I love it
This video is amazing!
Any chance you're willing to sell that table?
You know that having metal between the phone and the charger will result in you either loosing wireless charging all together or it being slower because the metal is a conductior
Or just put the charger on the table, just sayin
Awesome!
thickness of wood between phone and wireless charger?
nice! subscribed!
I want to build something like that too. Though with built in usb ports and i/o for a pc instead. great video and very informative. you got another subscriber!
5:45 The straight comes off while going through the table saw.
awesome build! but would the wood (and your case) slow down the wireless charging speed ?
That's some beautiful wood.
Who else felt this was really satisfying 8:30
Can I do this with like an ikea tabletop? Then again I’ll probably have to take it to my school’s shop... which probably won’t be allowed lmao
Why weld when you can use dUct TaPe
NICE!!
awesome
I'm very happy that the phone in the video was Samsung
That was pretty friggin nice.
That was awesome! That will be a cool computer table. Connecting Tech with woodwork and metalwork? Subbed and Liked!
Wow! ?? Love it! Subscription is on!
Badass and clever
Wow that's looks dope love it
This is probably a goofy question, but what phone is that?
new to your channel, was looking for ideas on building a desk. For your stand, what are the lengths of tubing?
Well done buddy, you are amazing man. You know how to work with wood and metal. You got my sub :) Keep up that great work.
"How to make" The first step: Use some weird ass machine
You could have added the laptop charger channel beneath the table as well , or how about putting a desktop inside the table itself.
Don’t cha just love watching videos of things you have no genuine interest in building or the technology needed to construct it?
I like the designs and the material that you make. I also like the hardware and the organization. Great man!
sir. that was awesome. well, you can't find a table that has wireless phone charger anywhere. I hope you'll made some table for PC gamers in the future.
omg! your tools must be worth more than my entire life savings
10:04 that pun
3:47 And.... I’m blind
OMG i had this exact same idea a couple months ago but i did not have the time to build my desk yet
Subbed. Great video.
Wow, I do some woodworking in my free time. Nice work dude! I hope to be as good as you one day!
While we're stuck in 2018, this man is in 2077
Once you have your tacks remove your magnetic squares (leave your clamps), because if you expose your magnets to enough heat they will demagnetize over time.
Haven’t watched the video so probably wrong but I’m guessing you hide the wireless charging tech in the table? Too obvious maybe? Lol
Can i buy it?
i'd pay you to have that custom desk delivered to my door, it's beautiful. Any way I can buy it from you?
I saw this video, like the only video i have seen with you, and i love you!! #keepupgoodwork
i would love to live in US for the big reason of the access to every tool!!!
Walnut is now my 2nd favorite. Love the look of it stained.
I loved it man. That wireless charging... I'm about to build my new desk, and I'm going for it. Thanks for the inspiration.
looks beautiful !
Well done man
awesome!!! if they were for sale i would buy one
Imagine this with a wireless charging qi PADS, like the huge mats.
But can it run crysis?
Superb Metal work and wood work !!!
I was expecting more of a hot Glue and duck tape scenario but this will do I guess.
wow.. this is awesome.. clicks the subscribe button
??????
U r awesome
Damn I need a new desk.
What laptop is that?
Well done! ????
This is awesome
Damn! That's soooo DOPE
What a sick workshop you have
Damn such a nice and awesome idea great job man :D
Can you please make me one !? ??
Wow. Very cool
jesus christ that inlay is perfect
Hi, nice video. the idea to put a wireless charger is something every furniture maker like ikea should do. But when i saw the metal part to mark the spot of the wireless charger, i was asking myself one thing. Why not using a piece of wood from another kind of wood ? using another wood can allow you to place the mark directly where the wireless charger is. It's more accurate to place a phone on a mark than placing a phone next to a mark. right ?
*Puts wireless charger under desk Puts phone on top of desk Fail
Is there a way to make appliances have the ability for wireless control, e.g. lights, fans?
subbed
That was awesome
Amazing.
Wish i could afford Tools to do stuff like this.... :(
I would've made more room for where the cord plugs in and staple the wire instead of hot glue just in case the wire stopped working. It just would be an easier fix if it did stop working. Other than that, nice video.
Cool, wish I was crafty! All I make are balls out of aluminium foil &crosses from popsicle sticks
Super neat desk, great build!
That looks awesome
Loved what I saw, just subscdibed
For welding always try to keep your arms/elbows against something for more precise welding and I like to drag the wire away from the weld as I make a long bead
very cool
can you make me one too Please
satisfaction
Dammit man, this is beautiful. Probably worth $1k at Kirkland’s
where can I get the ruler with clamps at 7:15
I need this, my phone basically lives on my table
Please don't show the welding part in the video, it may affect eyes of the viewers. If you still wanna do that, do that with some editing. Rest everything is awesome, keep it up.
AINT THERE A SINGLE PART IN THIS VIDEO WORTH DISLIKING
I subscribed and notifications on
Great. You can start over making a new table when your next wireless charger will have a different shape.
im getting a king of random vibe, anyone else?
Like I'm going to have the capability of building this, lol. Cool video bro
Is it for all phones?
wouldn't the charging speed slow down a bit as the pad is on the lower side of the table? ??
you look pretty precise and professional. worth a subscribe :)
All I can say with welding is u are doing very well just don't use plastic clamp with welding
Really love your project. Thats really creative..but i dont think glueing the wireless charger is a good idea just in case that the charger has a problem.
Wow
Mint this thing is perfect good job.
What a wonderful piece of furniture! Great job, I'd love to have such thing at home
You made a whole desk for a charger? THATS GENIUS!!!
Noice
Can you show us How to maken a Chair with Hidden Wireless Charging, so I can get Testicular cancer too on my other Ball ? thx
Nice Table !
this is how u get cancer
I don't understand how you have dislikes on your videos.
Would have been really cool if you integrated some led's and plug sockets into the desk had one cable running out to power everything
itsssss mind-boggling ??????????????
Make coolest study table
Nice video. I actually enjoyed watching it..
Touch key board inset and projected screen module inset - yet ' BRO?
That's going to take a long time and a lot of hard work, but it's worth it, it's great for parties
wont the copper affect the charging speed?
One small problem. Wireless chargers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The copper inlay would not be a good idea here. The eddy current induced in the copper inlay would waste energy by heating it up and slow down the charging process. Amazing project, otherwise!
Awesome work brothers really flawless
Wow! Nice job! This is pretty inspiring!
I am on a random video spree and can about this video and holy crap that was awesome! Good job and it looks amazing dude ! Definitely subscribing and now motivated to do woodwork one day ! Thank you !
Personally I wouldnt recommend grinding the weld away, you're removing alot of that filler material that helps keep the bound between the 2 metals strong. I'd use a wire wheel to clean or shine it, but not erase it completely.
Awesome
if only i could afford some cheap materials to make some wood materials!
Lol not worth it for me I have a nexus 5 with qi but im lazy (Yes, I know that this comment is horribly written.)
Dude.. Thanks for sharing with us all of your new innovations. I'm a tech freak who loves to create and use futuristic things. Your videos by the way..they're Inspiring mate.. Thanks Shon. Calgary AB
Grinder and paint for the welder I ain't
Already looks like a amazing channel so I subscribed
Nice job
Thats an cool idea damn
Eww android
Hi this was a cool idea
Nice!
When that charger gets outdated new desk or scrape that wire out hmm
I'd pay good money to get one of these made. I don't own any of these tools, nor do I have any interest in woodworking/welding, but damn is this nice. Nice work!
1:05 sat flat on my bitch
LOVED IT UGH
oomf i saw a video just like this but posted june 12. care to explain or
That is very cool dude.
Wow it really turned out beautiful man. I love the copper inlay as well
Grinding and paint makes me the welder I ain't
I thought the whole desk would charge the phone ?????????
Now all you need is a wireless charging Mouse
I love it but one question! All tha charge or energy passing through the wood can be a fire hazard???
Great job Brad! Really nice work! A little tip on welding I’ve picked up. Try to tack weld the pieces of metal first and then finish the weld. This is a video link from ILTMS that might come in handy. (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UCrDSdlszSU) This was his first time welding a full project and I felt that you might appreciate the tips. Great Job! Keep it up!
awww, thought you were going to run an electromagnet underneath the desk with the same electrical resonant frequency so that you could place the phone anywhere on the desk.
So if your going on vacation you need to take the table with you on the plane?
I'VE BEEN A CERTIFIED WELDER & FABRICATOR FOR SOME TIME NOW. HERE'S IS SOME VERY HELPFUL **WELDER INSIGHT** **45° miter each corner** Its a cleaner look and reducing the chance of someone INCLUDING *Children* of sticking their finger into the metal tubing and cutting their fingers. Mitering makes it waterproof from the inside. Plus, if you want a wireless desk... you can fish the wires through a mitered cut easier than a "T" jointed weld. And fasten a rubber "O" ring grommet around any exit hole for wiring... make it water tight (less chance of rusting on the inside) AND it'll also protect the power cords from rubbing on the steel tubing over time.
thats so clean and well made very nice job i deffenly subscribed!!
Me and a co-worker of mine had the same idea back in april
Can I buy this
Great video! Welding your clamps to your work is an astronaut problem, working in a vacuum there's nothing preventing two metal lattices from linking together on a molecular level, so if you leave metal tools against a metal spaceship for only a few minutes, they get "cold-fused" together.
First time seeing your videos, nice work with the table and wireless charger.
wow. nice video. Found your Channel and subscribed immediately ;) Great Content :) Hope to see more in the Future :) Greetings, Michelle from Germany ^^ ;)
I want something like this for my house. I don't have the time, or the skill to do it by myself. Where can I found a guy like this doing it for me, and how this would cost for a similar desk?
Welding tip. When you weld your things . Put only dot. Then put dot on opposite sides. And go all 4 corners. Then check if it's ok. Dots are strong enough to hold it all. But if needed, you still can move it slightly. Then flip all and repeat it all. Then you should have what you want.
I really like your straightforward way of recording and your candor. I am starting my own channel and helping my stepson with his channel. Thanks
Super idea
One welding tip from me would be to buy proper welding pants, gloves, helmet, and shoes. Because if you catch a weld on yourself, it's going to be a bad day for you.
Can you fix the bell button lol
Very cool!
Loving this idea so much! Great video! However, a suggestion from my end would be perhaps next time drill 3 medium depth holes and use 3 sized sticks to hold the wireless charger in place. That way it can completely eliminate the use of the hot glue. It also allows easy change in the event the charger were to be damaged or spoiled. As for the remaining length of wire, it can perhaps be held in place with some sort of latch? That side I'm not too sure of, but I was thinking along the line of damaged wireless charger that needs replacement and working with hot glue before it was a headache to remove them.
that was pretty bad ass
I love how you are so detailed and so humble. I wish that you prosper and your shop to be one of the biggest shops preferred with big projects
This is satisfying to watch
As a beginner welder, yours look great for being the 2nd time
I love it make me one please
When you weld always 'push' the weld, i.e. if you point the tip to the left move to the left, you get better penetration....
Never seen a man cuting wood with a gasmask LOL
Would you ever consider selling one of these desks?
I'm in love with this table!! It's gorgeous! Now for me to get my own house and then find someone who can make me one! Oh and update my phone so I can use a wireless charger. Lol Great job on this desk!!!
Sell this to ikea, i want to but it!
Desk-Pacito
the copper isnt shiny at the end :(
Perfect
Welding tips. Shorts hoodies and shirts with pockets are a no go in any welding shop, good way to start yourself on fire or get serious burns
maybe just me, but I think it would have been better to have the charger on the left hand size or at least the top while having the mouse on the right side
229 guys hate wireless charging
He need to stop using gloves. Be a real man and not use gloves
He need
I'm new to the channel...but you did an amazing job!!
What is to be done when the charger is spoiled?
I accidentally stumbled across this and I subbed immediately. Thanks for the great content
This will slow down your charging
it wood :)
????????
Glue and ducktape can fix anything
You glued the table?
Does it work with every phone?
How much just asking
Morons disliked this video
Do you sell desks like that and ship them to germany? I like this wooden masterpiece!
7:35 --> 2:51pm on your phone and 2:51pm on my Computer haha
10:03 Is that unstained part meant to be a wrist rest or something?
Bro nice job u did a really good job for your first time doing this stuff by yourself just subscribed keep it up bro!
Awesome Video and supernice table! good job
that's a great idea !!!!
beautiful!
Dope
Lov'd it, Sub'd it but i gotta ask...how come you haven't inserted 'copper tie' exactly above (on the charging spot) the usable area? It would have been even great conductor of signal too...
those equipments is nice
I'm surprised the copper insert didn't interfere with the charging?
Can i buy it? I can spend 200€ on it thats all i have
Why he censored the paint can? ?? Edit: Sponsorship
Welding tip. Once you start moving the weld forward go back into the puddle of the weld about 1/8th of an inch
Now that is future!
Very cool idea. Personally, I would have preferred a wood inlay (maybe a small lightning bolt) right over the charging spot. That way it would mark the exact spot for charging, and would be a LOT easier to sand down level with the surface of the table.
I love this desk!
respect that you didn't ask for likes and subs before the video started. you know you have interesting content so you know people would stay long enough for your "ad"
amazing i like it
The table turned out to be awesome, it's a pity that without the equipment itself this can not be done :(
am i the only one who find it so satisfying ??
Nice work and great idea for a project. Subscribing rn
subscribed!!!
Definitely the most beautiful desk I have ever seen
Sg
Alright I want that desk????
Welding tip #1 don’t wear shorts great vid tho
Airports should have these
Why dont you glue your charger underneath a normal table ?????
Makes me wish I could afford a house where I can have tools. Cheers to being poor
amazinng!!!
could the distance between the charing pad and the phone lower the charging speed dramatically?
Awesome channel man!
I will buy this off you.
Very nice build and just wondering if you can notice any difference in the way the wireless charger works? Ex slower charge or harder to position phon?¿?
who also thought he was gonna make the whole desk a wireless charger. where u can put ur phone anywhere on the desk and can charge it
great video!
They should sell that at ikea
Can i buy one of that table
Great looking desk, earned a sub forsure!
it's dope but a lot of effort :)
That tube looks a lot more like 1 1/4" x 1 1/4 x .120 (1/8th wall) not 1x1. Coming from a metal guy.
i don't have these tools.. is an axe and a swiss knife enough?
I don’t even know anything about woodwork and all, I saw this in my recommended randomly, but damn do I wanna get into woodwork now lmao
hermoso trabajo!!! simple y 100% funcional
Wait what is the copper for?
Gorgeous. Outstanding work.
That's so dope man
That was really awesome, man. Patience and elbow grease.
Put more wireless chargers in the desk so you can put your phone anywhere on the table , good job man , subscribed
Woow really beautiful. I would like to know how to build some stuff like that. When you apply the coat, the wood reveals its true beauty. Nice job
or you can just tape it under a table.
Also whatch how to buy a wireless charging phone??
Don't wear shorts while welding will get sunburnt!!!!

How to make a table
small tip if you first only tag the inner edges you can still correct the angles than tag the outsides to so you dont really have to clamp it down as hard or if something is to big it will come in hamdy some day.. you can also use a piece of copper and clamp it in with the part you are welding because it wont stick on copper ;)
Like hidden wireless charger
Aaand.. how are you going to charge the charger???
Your power tools ahhhh, I'm jealous
Nice Desk man! :)
dumb question how you gonna pull out the wireless charger incase it got broken since you hot glued it and the wire
Who actually built this?
what if the wireless charging deck becomes faulty? we have to disassemble everytime?
This is mad! Nice one
While welding you don't need to wiggle around like you did, that's what amateurs do. Just put a nice continuous bead down that symmetrically bonds both sides of the corner (If both materials are the same size) and has an acceptable thickness. The bead should look as flat as possible and not like a round object you just laid in the corner :)
Guy sounds like Chrisfix, awesome video man
Don’t burn ur hands
Wow you really deserve to have more subscribers then you do...Subscribed!
Great video (and great work too!). I always wanted to do the exact same thing. Too bad I don't own most of your equipments. Not to say a decent workshop.
Try welding in a mini circle and slightly moving down every time.
Deserved my like and subscribe
i dont even have a wireless charging phone but im still watching this
This is so cool
I would probably buy this if I saw it in a store amazing woodwork looks like a pro had made it. keep going, man
Wow just beautiful
2:00 brought them back to the b!tch or bench ???
nice job man
First time to this channel, but that desk is Bad ASS
Nice video.. love the way you explained everything and step by step... already hit the subscribed button halfway of this vid.
Just built my first desk last week. Similar top, but pine, and a floating installation in my office. I love the wireless charging addition and I’ll be doing that as soon as it arrives! Thanks again, this is an excellent video.
HA! GAAAAAYYYY
Can you make for me like this table I pay you how much you want???
wow
never subscribed faster before!!!
Oh, so all you need to do is make an entirely new desk? Easy enough.
An opinion of my own. Not saying your idea is bad. But maybe take some slightly different colored wood cut a circle 1/4" bigger than the charger and make it thin. Cut a shallow inset to place the circle in. So you can place your phone on to you know where to put it, every time no guessing.
????????????????
You are going to be an awesome YouTuber
Love that wood....great project and work mate!!
hai sir, i think, in the future, the table can use for wireless charging, for phone, maybe laptop even tv... we just use converter like harfware from phone to convert to tv, laptop.
Hey Fix This Build That I'm Starting high school in 3 weeks my courses are Construction And Mechanic Thank you For Making me Feel So Excited about building stuff watching u make this made me so hyped to go to high school hopefully i can build something just like that. <3
Instantly subscribed after watching this. Beautiful desk btw.
Anyone else thinking the phone charger/phone is positioned way to close to the edge? Nice table, I had the similar one and it's probably 20+ years old.
Awesome video
Perfect n perfectionist
Frame should have been 10-20 cm shorter than table surface for a more elegant look. A bullnosed fron edge would also look great
This is awesome
Taki this charger out of plastic, I think it would speed up charging
Dude you’re awesome ????
OMG!!!! this is the most incredible built I've ever seen. What an incredible process from start to tinish. dude you have mad skills......
Good job looks very nice. When your welding your future projects tac it together in a cross pattern such as like when your tightening your wheel onto your car, do the same with your weld beads. This helps keep it square and prevents major warping
9:35 what you came for
Really? This type of work is not for the avg Joe...
Too good nice thinking Hoping for more
Anyway,good job. but when the wireless charger needs to be fix or somehow, that will be a troublesome job
any concerns with the charger overheating the wood and being a fire hazard?
But can it do this folds table
Everything is good expect paint in yard please don't make nature dirty by paint..
Man I love that walnut. Cool idea hiding that charger too.
I saw a DIY perks video in which Matt created a laptop dock that he build into the wall. Cambining those two concepts woulod make this awesome desk even cooler. Heres the video I mentioned: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGX34631pdk
Awesome Video what project do you recommend for a beginner
it would be so funny if the finish you put on stopped the wireless charger working through the wood due to the extra thickness
Nicly done
Make sure you hit your slag off because it will screw you up
Congratulations must be disappointing, don't stay sad.
I love it ??
You should have put the charger directly centered under a natural knot so you could have a discrete identifier
New sub, Great job!!!
This video was slick enjoyed it
Couldn’t you put copper wires that ran through out the entire underside of the desk so virtually your phone can be charged
Really really cool stuff, I love it, subscribed!!! Can’t wait to see more
That was an awesome vid. Gained another sub. Really inspired me to build rather than buy, now
I don't quite understand why you positioned the bow tie copper on the side instead of exactly above the wireless charger
Beautiful
now what happens if something goes bad with the cable and you need to replace it
I also have wireless charger embedded like this in my wooden desk. And After 2 years I can say that it's pretty much useless. Because of wood the charging is slower AND the biggest problem is the alignment..You have to always align the phone with the exact spot and when you don't phone will charge slower(3hrs+) or won't even charge. This is gonna work only when there will be drilled exact spot for the phone. (I use original samsung wireless fast charger and Galaxy S8. Before I had Galaxy S6)
If you want to get a perfect square for your welding projects, just use the magnetic square to get a decent square with your pieces, then ONLY tack your pieces together. You only need a very light tack for this part. Then proceed to measure from corner to corner in all rectangle\square areas, bending and twisting the piece to get a perfect square. If your square is perfect, you will have the same length from corner to corner on all corners. You might already know this but I didn't see you doing this in the video so I thought I would share it anyways. :)
Table looks awesome and the cherry on top is definitely the wireless charger in bedded in it! Super cool
Great table and great video, a tip one of my welding teachers gave me in highscool and set me apart from my classmates is to never cheap out on welding, you can always remove excess material but a filmsy weld goes a long way to disaster
WHO COULD EVEN DISLIKE THIS VIDEO?
??????????
your not consistent enough with your welding
Nice project and excellent work! ??
i thought the bow tie was gonna mark the spot where you put the phone to charge
New subscriber! Love the creativity!
You wack a wireless thingy under something - done. Is this a riddle? I have my wifi router inside a cabinet so it's hidden wifi. Did I make something? Do I call it hidden wifi cabinet or, should I just call it a day...
i wanna build a baby
Absolutely stunning man good job, especially the welding, takes guts to try new stuff like that! I cant find a desk to fit in my apartment so i hope to do the same, you've given me a lot to think about, subscribed! :)
This is so F'n cool!
That coppee inlay was well made!
awesome build sir
I've been thinking of doing this for at least a year now. Glad to know it works.
Fantastic work!! I’ve been wanting to do something similar with my desk but not sure how to go about it but with your video I know exactly how to go about it 10/10 earns my sub & like
Very good explained. Ich give you a very big thumb up??
That's well cool
That desk is so cool
Nice
Holy motherfvcker, you are a GENIUS!!!
I know its a little bigger projekt but it would be nice if you would build a whole sideboard. Or maybe a media-shelf with doors or drawer. Nice vid I love the desk!
you cant have a chair underneath the desk....
With your welding method you should do small circles counterclockwise if your welding from left to right , helps filling in everything and theres no stronger and weaker part of bigger lengths of welds from going faster or slower
What a great project! Thank you for sharing!
awesome
Did This to a nightstand about 6 months ago
Well done!
I love the idea and design of walnut plus metal base but how much efficiency do you lose making it charge through the wood? Can I affectively charge the iPhone in an hour or two?
SUBSCRIBED!!!
This video is really well made subbed strait away great idea and presentation as well!
How long does it take to charge from 0 to 100?
if I could choose one skill to be good at it would be woodworking, fantastic work.
Dude your neat its neat great go
Table came out GREAT!! I'm new to your channel and wanted to say that it is very much apreciated to see someone upload videos vith such a clean shop. It seems like having a dusty and dirty shop makes you a better wood worker... Keep up the good work. Cheers from Spain!!
this is what i looking for thanks dude!
Very good build ! ????
for keeping things square rather than butting them together you could've cut each at 45 degree angle, it also helps if you've got something with a real load on it, but for a project like this it probably wouldn't have made much of a difference
Could you please share the name of the glue? I would have used colored epoxy to indicate the wireless charger position. :-).Thanks for the awesome video.
I certainly have not welded a clamp to my work, But I have made the mistake of using plastic clamps on a weld piece.
Dude that was an amazing idea and which worked very well ...
Next time you're at your welding supply/metal supply, pickup some welding tabs. Unless you like wasting time making your own tabs ;)
You messed up in the end.
It's my first time in your channel in you've done a great job also in video editing.
I need to weld now.
Great job Brad! The desk looks amazing.
When you are welding make sure to do tack welds it will help with you keep your angles and stop warping
Definitely subscribing Awesome video ??
Man this is fuckin ingenious. Subscribed and hit the bell! First guy I’ve ever seen out wireless charging INSIDE a project.
Subscribed because of this vid. Wow! I never knew there's a channel with this cool build videos. Keep it up!!
Damn, that's a sexy bench
I learned to weld recently (I am by no means a pro), But here are my basic tips for learning how to weld. - Heat is your friend, learn how to use it to your advantage. - When welding tube like that, angle the majority of your heat into the solid part, not the one with the cut-off end. This will help avoid warping of the metal. -Practice, It is a feel thing, you will get better over time. - Always remember that a grinder and paint will make you the welder you ain't. Good luck!
This video made me subscribe! You did a really good job and I love walnut.
Love the craftsmanship, just so happen to pass ur channel I’m glad I went back. Outside keep doing great work, peace and blessings ???
amazing!! good work
Do you have gas when you weld?
long story short. buy a desk and do 6:20 and beyond guys lol.
This looks amazing!
Very cool, very cool
The is a beautiful piece of work.
As hot as it may be, always cover all bare skin when welding. Both because of splatter and visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light/radiation, it's so intense that it damages skin and can cause to all sorts of nasty things so quickly.
Been really looking forward to this since watching on IG. The final product looks amazing. Quick question though. I've gotten lots of feedback from different people on doing inlays. When you want that really tight fit, a lot of folks have told me to turn the chisel around. They said putting the flat on the line with the bevel facing in forces the wood grain out & that turning it around forces the wood grain in & you get a tighter fit. Anybody have any thoughts on this? I haven't gotten around to trying it yet.
Beautiful. The bow tie really added a extra touch of character ????
that inlay is sweet. turned out really nice. if this tabletop was outdoors, would you ever consider swelling/contracting of the wood around the charger and inlay?
Nice video! One tip for welding if you hadn't figured it out yet. Only use the magnets for tack welding. If you keep them on when trying to join the parent metals the molten pool can be affected by the magnets, it'll be drawn towards them and your weld will be ruined.
You - are - AWSOME !
Great stuff. Love watching videos like this. Giving me plenty of ideas for the future.
I need this omg
That is awesome! Great job on your new desk! :)
So pretty!
I don't know anything about working with wood or metal, but this is sick man
copper looks too srtaight.The symbol lightning or battery would be better
hello, can you say what tree it is?
Wow..... amazing CTRL+C hahahhaha
Awesome video and an awesome build! I admire the work in this project! You have won a new subscriber! Looking forward to your next vid:)
Gorgeous work! Love your work space, looks neat and organized!
First Video I've seen from you. It's awesome. Nothing more to say????
Simply WOW!!! Subscribed! Man, I totally enjoyed this video! And you being so humble, made this video even more likable!! Thats some solid work out there mate! Keep it up!! <3
Why is the front edge (at 10:07) not painted?
Foony
Muito top! Projeto excelente!
That desk looks amazing, defiantly subbing
Very nice looking industrial desk
I've been itching to do a wireless charging table for ages now, i just dont have the materials, and decent wood at my place is quite expensive, perhaps i should give it a go. Subbing :)
How much would it cost for someone to make this for me???
That’s prett cool
?he tools make the masseur.......
What is your phone what brand
Nice Table
great video man
5:20 wtf lol
Your amazing, gretings from poland where we have only a few chanels like this
the smell of newly planed wood... so good...
Gosh u have a lot of fancy devices... I have only screwdrivers :P
awesome project.
What cool charging solution you built into the desk... super elegant idea there. Great job on the desk too, that walnut really looks good.
this is way badass!
Beautiful work my friend, love me some walnut.
In your welding, what method are you using for laying the bead? Half-moon, circles, back and forth? Play around with different techniques. My favorite is half-moon.
That’s awesome!! 1st video and just subscribed!!
did you just stain it or did you put another on top of it
Enjoyed seeing you work. Awesome shop & video. New subscriber.
May it be tailors for scraps of threads and clothing, painters with different media, aquascapers with plants and rocks, cooks with different recipes and techniques or even carpenters with old lumber. They all recycle something old and make it into something new.
Lovely idea and I appreciate how you talked through the process of building it, making it easy to understand. The walnut looked great and the copper inlay was a really interesting way to mark the position. The only thing I think I would have done differently would be how you secured the charger in place, glueing it in could make replacing the device a little annoying in future should it break, or there's a worthwhile upgrade.
absolutely love the concealed wireless charging idea, subscribed!
Amazing piece of art
Beautiful job mate...
D O P E
Dang that's nice!
Do schools offer schooling for this kind of work?
Amazing video, subscribed!
Are there any specific books you can recommend to learn more about woodworking
What phone case is that?
I have a perfectly good desk and this video was still interesting to watch! Great job =D
That was a schweeet project!, I enjoyed watching this , I also appreciate that you shared your mistakes!.. thanks ! Great content!!
Uh, wood expansion? It looks like the mounting brackets perpendicular to the wood grain also only have a round hole for the screw. Are you living in such a stable climate?
Amazing project
just came across your channel and subbed awesome work and that welder is really cool didn't know about it now i want one
I’m no expert, but I do believe the copper will take some of the energy , that was intended for your phone, from the wireless charger. I have no idea what effects this will have on how fast your phone charges but I felt it was something I should point out.
Dude. The concept is nice. But what I was thinking as you have glued the wire, what if the charger fails, what will you do? Is it possible to make a extra thin layer of wood and cover the wire! In this way if the charging cable or the charger get some issue, you will not have any problem in removing it. I am from IT. But I like to see the ideas. And this video is a great help. Wish you all the best for the next video.
Very nice Brad.
Im a welder by trade in Canada, and your welding seems pretty good. The hardest part of MIG welding is setting the machine, and since you have that 210mp it isn't too much of a problem since it does that close enough witch materiel thickness and wire. Only thing I would say is up the voltage for the interior corners of the frame to wet the metal in better and prevent cold lapping. Great project just subbed. ??
Next time build a metal bracket u shaped to hold the charging unit in place, for serviceing repairing or replacing when 4x speed charging comes out in a decade or so, cause that desk will last way longer than the charger.
Great content !
Great video... better than any TV show anywhere.
Don’t weld on concrete! Heat from the arc can cause water in the concrete to turn to steam and explode the concrete.
the desk looked amazing! nice work dude.
my #1 welding tip is to not use mig as a beginner. you will never learn to weld with that. and also welding square tubing is not really some beginner project, the radius corners are slightly more difficult to weld than just a simple fillet or buttweld. thicker material is generally speaking easier to stick together, just because you are not that likely to blow holes in it. in the end, welding is about practise, you need to do it for a really long time to get expirienced in doing it. its not like most woodworking stuff where you can clearly see whats going on and most of the time, you have enough wiggle room to work something out. thats not the case with welding, if you mess it up, its very very hard to correct, in fact most of the time its just not possible and you have to grind it off and do it again. long story short: dont use mig, weld as much as you can, get yourself some scrapmetal and try to just do straight beads on it... if you can do a straight bead of constant dimensions, think about fusing two pieces together. dont start at step 7 if you cant do steps 1-6
Awesome video! I think personally I would've used a wooden inlay directly over the wireless charger if it was possible. That would have been a more intuitive way to remember where the charger is.
Hey since you are new to welding I suggest, that you check out the correct sequence of welding to prevent distortion when welding a miter joint. You will see that you can weld a joint without even clamping it down and remain square. And to avoid working on the floor just use sawhorses and put some long steel tubing on each side and you got a perfect solution(space and cost saving)
if you making a weld, when you move to the richt carefuly move up and down (about max 3mm) to make a stronger bond.
Great job on your first inlay man...thanks for sharing
cool cool cool
Dude i have bean trying to make a desk and i found your video and i loved the walnut desk you made it looks amazing i think i will use walnut for mine ohhh and the finish.
I really liked the polished look of the copper bowtie. It would've been nice if you went ahead and re-polished the copper working with higher grit wet sand paper and moving to copper polish.
Guys any more welding tips. I’m interested.
WHAT FELL AT 9:54??
What an amazing idea man! Now I`m reorganizing my bedroom and the wireless charging desk it's great! Thanks!
Nice project, just one tip, I wouldn’t use your vacuum while welding There’s no real need for it, no mess like when dealing with wood But the downside is it may suck the gas in and away from the work area which is meant to be shielding your weld and stopping any flaws and imperfections in your welds
How much did the whole project cost?
Brad, that channel promo was so silky smooth I had to unsubscribe and resubscribe. I love your stuff my man; We have such similar tastes, hopefully one day I can bring my skill level and shop up to your level and work my way through your catalog.
My welding advice would be to take that welder back, save a pile of money and grab a run of the mill stick welder. It will be harder to learn but it didn't even look like you were using shielding gas, so there will be way more room to get better. You'll take more pride in your work and you''ll have more fun. If you're heart set on that machine I would pick up a tank of argon. With gas you wont need to get better. The welder will do all the work for you. That machine can also TIG. Give that a try. It's difficult but it's the preferred method by basically all in the field for a reason. I don't think that machine does AC though, so don't expect to be TIG welding aluminum.
Just subscribed and I’m building the desk tomorrow thx
Gorgeous. I love how clean and simple it looks, because it really highlights how solid and beautifully built it is. That copper inlay is the perfect finishing touch.
REalllyy clean
Awesome build! That hidden charger is so slick.
Wow, one of the few channels that has tech, simple, good looking products. Subbed and noti on??
Outstanding job on this desk. I have never tried welding and with the huge mess I have in my garage, (which doubles as my woodworking shop) I don't have room to add anything else. I"m luck can move around my garage as it is. I keep thinking of ways to make room, which never seems to come to fruition..
Great Job, My Respects.
great work...i do think a less permanent way to install the charger might have been more ideal...as tech tends to change or burn out pretty easily these days...
absolutely amazing job man...
everything is top notch and inspiring....nice and clean finish with the unique metal inlay.....only critisism is the hot glue for the charger...no way to repair the unit in case of problems
Hey man, using walnut, and mixing in tech... you got my subscription. Not to mention very nice work, informative and entertaining! Thanks for a cool project!
That was an amazing project you did. Might give it a crack myself. Thanks for the idea.
I would put the wire direkt into the wall! Look much better!
Brad awesome desk I really like how the cooper looks against the walnut. Can you tell me what sander you have and dust collection you have for it. Thanks
Beautiful wood! Great build!
I LOVE the table! It turned out awesome!
Brad!!!! This is amazing! I can't wait to do metal work again one day, I've only done it with "supervision" hehe. The charging idea is top notch. This is going on my to do list!! Amazing work bud
Looks great. Glad to see you expanding your arsenal.
Another great project!
Really Cool idea.. Great job
do you use flux core while welding or gas?
Wear jeans when welding
Great build! That Walnut looks awesome!
Great job Brad. I've been following your progress on IG for a while. It's nice to see how you did it all. Now i want this desk to shoot all my Youtube Tech reviews on! :)
I love the build Brad, really well done! Beautiful wood, great techniques, cool features – really a fun project. Also couldn't help but notice the camera angles and shots. They told the story well, and really highlighted what you were doing.
That looks awesome man! You might be able to remove the coil from the wireless charger. That way there is less material for the electromagnetic field to be absorbed by, and more energy going to the phone, which will make the charging more efficient.
I would be careful welding on concrete. It will heat up and start exploding. Yea, it doesnt feel good on exposed arms
Beautiful desk. I wish I'd have watched it sooner though. I built a lamp yesterday, and now today I learn that "I'm a goon" and I should've glued below my wire. Thanks for the education!
Looks great. I just got a phone with wireless charging so I really want to do a cool build like this.
Nice table design and great execution. Do you get much snipe with that Rigid planer? My little Wen snipes like crazy no matter how light of a pass I take or how I set up the in and outfeed wings.
Simple and well crafted. Looks good, man!
The inlay looks really nice, but for those who don't have a nice metal option to insert there, seems like a shape (X, circle, lightning bolt, whatever) with a different shade of finish would be a nice, easy solution.
Great video Brad! Looks awesome. Gotta make a wooden mallet so you can use that instead of a hammer and block!
This looks awesome Brad! Nice job. ??
That walnut is beautiful. I love the wireless charging too. definitely keeping that in mind for future projects. Great video
May want to take some of the screws out of one edge maybe the sides holding the top. Alternatively elongate the holes in the metal tab to allow for movement. Otherwise expansion and contraction may wreck your beautiful desk. Thanks for the video.
We've just found our channel today and we loved it! For sure it's gonna be a good source of information for us when we start building the interior of our shipping container house! ??
What are you going to do about wood movement with those screws going directly into the tabletop?
Wow. That’s awesome brad. I really like the design and hidden charging station.
As an iPhone user I have to know, how does this work? I’ve stuck objects between my phone and it’s wireless charger but it doesn’t charge.
Great and inspiring work, I'm gonna build one soon ????
Great job Brad. Love the desk.
Looks so great Brad!! Love that idea to use the inlay as an indicator for the charger
Cool table. What type of laptop is that? Just interested.
You just made me want to make a desk! Although I don't have the tools nor the skills to make the base! I suppose that I would just make that out of wood too. Oh yeah, and you got a new subscriber! Great job on the table and really nice video.
How do you know there are no bugs left in the wood?
Excellent video! You explain everything so clearly. Also not hiding the mistakes. Well done Brad!
Amazing as always Brad! (Fergs_wood_decor)
Great video, Brad. That top looks awesome! One question, what fume extractor are you using and does it work well? Okay, that was two questions.
felicitaciones x la idea y x el buen trabajo realizado. Gracias!.
Love the desk, Brad! I've been working on a desk lamp that includes a wireless charging pad, but I wasn't sure how practical it would be. This shows me that it is certainly doable! Looking forward to more videos.
Came out looking really nice Brad! I love the contrast between the copper and walnut and the wireless charging blows my mind - curious if it the distance from the phone affects the speed of charging?
This came out super nice. LOVE the walnut. Great work.
Great work Brad!
Awesome build buddy
Excellent build Brad and the Copper inlay shows up really well once the Finish went on. Barry (ENG)
The walnut is BEAUTIFUL! Thanks Brad.
The biggest thing I gathered from this video, is that I need a vacuum assistant, one with nice legs :). Just kidding Brad. Very cool project, that walnut, copper and steel combo is KILLER!
Looks great!
When welding a tube that creates essentially sealed ends, drill a small hole in the bottom to allow venting inside the tube.
Did you steal your kids sidewalk chalk to mark the boards? That's genius if you did! LOL!
Extreme beautiful table... congratulations for your job!
I didn't think the wireless will work due to wood thickness. I wonder what thickness will make it "not charging". The finishing was amazing, just beautiful.
Love this project! Beautiful desk!
Beautiful work!
Very creative imbedding the charger, I like it!  Another great video Brad
I’m a Seabee in the navy and I’m trying to get more into artisan carpentry and this page has saved my life. 11/10
Looks great Brad! Nice metal work!
Well done.
That Emerson tool AIO looks really useful. I wish I had one when I made my cabinet. If you get a genius affiliate link so I can buy in the UK I'd get it through you.
Awesome build Brad! I really like the wireless charging idea and how you used the bow tie as a reference feature. Well done. Keep it up!
you should have drilled a small hole under the inlay from behind to bleed out the excess epoxy,so that it would fit flush to the surface and eliminate the excess sanding.Just a small thought
Good luck with the move and hope all goes well!
Looks awesome! And I loved the circular saw dust collector! ????
Duuude... Congrats. Awesome! ??
Good ideal.??
I’m liking that wife dust collection mount for the circular saw, I need to get one of those ?? Turned out awesome man, really like this.
This video is so good, subscribed
Amazing and very clean work, my hat off to you. Blessings.
That is an awesome desk. Love the wireless charging and the bow tie came out great.
Great job. Love the idea of the built in charger.
that looks awesome
I've had embedded wireless charging on my radar ever since I think I saw Johnny Brooke talk about it a few months ago. That's a cool idea! That is a gorgeous table!
You are one of my inspirations my friend! This desk and that charging station are king
I am in process of using very similar construction to make tables for my wife's "hobby hut". When the video goes up you may want to watch, cause I will be showing a different corner joint for the metal, and an idea for fastening to the metal with potential wood movement in mind.
Always a challenge when you incorporate whatever is the "latest" technology idea into a project (ie wireless charging). Risk is that the technology changes - and is meaningless in a few years. I know! still have a beautiful hard maple desk that was made with a continuously fed dot matrix printer in mind (circa 1985). :-)
How do I give video more that one thumbs up??
Nice job.....another enjoyable video. Well done.
Great build.
This desk is awesome! Did you happen to build a second one simultaneously... ya know, for a friend?
Such a great build! I especially like the charging. Way to keep learning new skills!
Fantastic build!??
The best congratulations ???????? like like 10 mister
Awesome work Brad. Great design and style
Nice build Brad!
Just yesterday I was thinking on how to hide my wireless charger! Thanks for the inspiration!!
That came out amazing. Nice job Brad!
One of your best Brad!
Sleek looking desk Brad! ?? Phenomenal job! ????
Nice job Brad! The built in wireless charging is sweet, and so is the copper dutchman!
Check out weldingtipsandtricks channel
Beautiful table & I really like the hidden wireless charger. The copper bowtie is a nice touch. Only thing I'd do would be to polish bowtie up after sanding flush then epoxy.
Don't glue in the wire. Those thin (crap) wires will eventually stop working and will need to be replaced.
Judgement in, looks good. Love the Walnut top.
I was listening to the Made For Profit podcast episode in which you mentioned this desk (particularly the welding) while building cabinet doors for a customer's kitchen remodel project, so I was excited to receive the notification for this post after work. Man, you did an awesome job on every part of that desk. Welding and painting the frame. Milling and joining the top. The final finish. The wireless charging and bowtie accent. This all looks killer! I'm sure that you're going to love working at a piece of art that you designed and created.
That charging spot is crazy. I might try that on my desk that I built a few months ago. Thanks!
Beautiful! The copper butterfly key looks like it was meant to go there. Nice ????
Que buena idea, felicitaciones bro
Thank you! Your video has inspired me to expand my woodworking and dive into metalworking but that mig welder is a bit expensive for entry level. any other recommendations?
Welding can become easier if you use more of a wrist movement instead of an arm movement and doing a weld going down in a vertical position can produce better welds to ??. Hope that helps
Very nice! I like the hidden charger. Thanks for sharing.
Good work. The copper hourglass was a great addition!
Nice.
Whoever’s YouTube account that is, why are they not already subscribed to Crafted Workshop?
I like the fact that you don't pretend to be a perfect man and show us the little mistakes (must of people don't do it). Great idea I enjoy watching your work thanks for sharing!
The walnut and metal combo looks amazing and is an awesome build. Adding an inlay and hidden wireless charging? SO cool!!
Such an amazing table. Love the design and the finish
This guy is a God
Excellent job, I will copy you the idea Brad! Maby i will try with a plastic circle instead the silicone for have the option to remove the charger.
Dope Build! Been wanting to do something similar, but with a wider area for charging under the desk. Wireless charging isn't far enough along yet to along for like a 12' zone of charging versus a tiny little ring you have to be so precise on. Maybe in the future. Great work though. Love that metal inlay.
This is the first video I have seen about doing something like this, and I'm so glad to see a video about incorporating tech into the project! Nice touch on the copper marker
Love the copper/walnut combo. Killer!
Why would you need to hide this?!
So B.A. Brad! Love it!
love the wireless charging function :D great vid as always !
Looks great, a desk is on my list for my new home office and I like this one. I just need to learn how to weld now
As usual, I truly enjoyed your video. Love the charger and bowtie. I could see recessing one more of them (for the lady of the house - happy life - then there's the kids...) and maybe putting a recessed power strip on the back?
Great build Brad!
Brad this looks amazing! Congrats!
That charger trick would work great on end tables! Very nicely done, Brad!
awesome build Brad that charger idea was real smart. thanks for sharing.
Great looking desk! Really love the brass inlay, gives it just the right amount of character.
Very nice.
????
That’s very nice, great job. Love the creativity!
Great build! ?? The desk looks great!
Another great video Brad, keep them coming !!
Awesome work my friend
Really nice job. That walnut is gorgeous. And the finish going on... I enjoyed that.
Simple beauty, yet attractive and functional. Thank you!
Amazing work man!!
Impressive work, congratulations.
I dont know the distance you have from the phone to charger, but it should be as thin as possible. The closer you can get the charger to the phone, the stronger the charge current can get to the phone. So perhaps route the bottom to be at most 1/16" thick from the surface and place a 1/2" dia black plastic disc, sanded flush to surface to indicate the center of charger would give maximum charge current to phone. Magnetic radiation from charger follows the inverse square law, meaning each time you double the distance from charger to phone, you half the amount of charger current. Love your channel.
Just beautiful. absolutely astonishing.
Awesome build really cool idea
?????? nicely done!! been wanting to do that in my coffee table
Awesome looking table and love the bowtie!
Love the copper inlay. Great job
Loved this! I'll try something similar ????
That is a beautiful piece! Where do you buy your steel from?
This is so cool! Awesome video as always, Brad! ????????????
Jeez dude! Now I need to get a welder! Beautiful job!
Great project and great video too.
I love the desk and the hidden wireless charging. Excellent idea. Walnut looks so good, not very accessible for me though at the moment, but one day.
Awesome project Brad, love the way that walnut looks under that finish. Where do you source your wood from? I’m in Tennessee as well, Nashville area
Thank you, gonna fix my office room and want to make my own desk and gonna try something similar to this :) how did you figure out the distance beetween the charger and phone would be?
Awesome table Brad. Love that walnut too. I'm going to try that charger inlay on my next build.
I've wondered what you were going to make with those walnut boards since I first started watching your channel like a year ago :D
It turned out great!
First!! Sorry Brad I had to.....
WOW! that is a lot of bees!
camera man john's eyes at 8:57
Use a Geneva mechnism
Totly wasted the time
i have that t-shirt, i got it from kohls
Part 2?
It’s sad to see how much he lost
That's a crazy pattern generator though
VIDEO RUINED I HAD A TIC TOCK ADD
"Nya" is Japanese for Meow
That's a nice house he's in lol
I NEED THIS MOVIE
I'd like to see a part two with a "new and improved" iteration...
Hey, for version 2, I suggest you cut out garbage bag plastic to go over the disk. it will block out ALL light
Your bees show sounds like something from rick and morty
that can't beee in there 0:38
thats a lotta bees
Does he clean his house once in a while???? :p
You can get that cereal box paperboard from Costco they don't mind if you just pull out the sheet in between the toilet paper stacks and take it home Don't ask me how I know
Please tell me I can see that bee documentary in full somewhere
So Cool!  I have been promising myself to get into this N.B.T.V. hobby but so far no time.  I think I would go with a drum monitor instead of a disk for the bigger picture.  Hey dig the idea of the FLOWDAC a digital computer that computes with air , patent 3190554 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qgxsJp8MZk&t=699s  Move the slider to about 10:00 something and nice lady Fran explains all.   Patent 672256, 3013505 .
Imagine the minds that came up with this tech on their own from scratch! Crazy
bee-utiful
0:32 that's a lot of damage
10/10 would science fair again
You need a t shirt that says that’s a lot of bees
THATS A LOT OF BEEEEES

William Osman marking something that took normal humans years and here’s using plywood
Bro I could have just given you a TV
Did this man really use a laser to cut cardstock ?
beeeeees
Could someone explain me why there are bees in his tv?
i’m new to watching his stuff what’s with him and bees he adds stuff about bees in a lot of videos
Gg
I want a shirt that would be so cool
I kind of love William's earlier videos, like this one.. They're more focused than the newer stuff.
tHeREs A bEE?!!
Nintendo Labo
I want a full video of "Wow that's a lot of bees!", please make it happen.
is this where his bee obsession started?
My 8-year old after 1 minute of this: "I don't want to science." 
This video is smarter than the lasts ones.
where to cat shirt?
Maybe I got lucky but mine worked perfect on the first try
You kinda look like Aaron paul
Can we just watch more of the bees
okay, wrong video to say this on, but this man deserves more attention. he has great and entertaining ideas but it is limited by resources, especially after his house burnt down and he lives in a mobile home. He feels guilty about all the attention he's been given, but I want to see this man get funding and do awesome things. I think you deserve more attention, Will.
That's a Lot of Bees is my favorite show
Mystical hair shortening halfway through the vid
That's a lotta damage!
Pray for that crt
Happily watching William Osman videos instead of studying for my electronics exam coming up
I need this t-shirt in my life. Where do I get one?!?!
Pssst Osman, psst saa diyom Osbik
Is “Wow That’s a Lot of Bees!” from interdimensional cable perhaps?
I love it when he explains shit and I have no idea what's he is saying
Many beees
Part 2?
that bee thing looked like an ad from interdimensional cable
We need the full vision of wow that's a lot of bees
You’re like Jesse from Breaking Bad’s smart brother.
can i have some tattoos please ?
I would love to see a new iteration of this if you get the chance
Rip crt
Please do the version 2 already, I loved this.
Byeet
Spray paint?
wouldn't a ridged disk work better?
Just bee-utifull
dude your so talented you deserve more money and better stuff
Should have used spray paint you dingus haha
I watched 40 seconds of this at 4 am and I don't feel sleepy anymore...
Wait, theres a beeeeeee?????????? Actually where is part 2
I don't need all the extra information I just want to know if I can watch R rated movies on it?
I need the full “WOW! That’s a lot of bees!” Series to be put on Netflix right now.
make a machine that make pickles slice themselves
I came back to see tge house again
Nice
Maybe camera man John put those bees in the tv
A speedrunner could've bought that tv
My mom has the same cat shirt in the beginning
dude.. you took 4 days to paint the wheels black?? Did you hear about spraypaint? :DDD
We need this again, this was sick
Hay James
2:09 I'm Gloria Borger and you are watching PewNews
does it play melee though?
Version 2 pls? :3
5:14
Can you just release Wow that's a lot of bees as a standalone video lol
William, are you a MUSLIM? You and I share the same last name, but I've never known a white person with that last name. Not trying to sound racist at all, just interested.
He looks a lot like Aaron Paul
Can we talk about all of those bees tho?
R I P house
Do a v2 in 2018 now
Awesome. 3:16 why the Howtobasic.
I don't know if it existed then, but you could've used vantablack.
holy shit yes, love mechanical tvs
Haircut at 7:04
That poor crttv ;-;
That crt
I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED B EEEEE shirt
I've "discovered" your channel lately and have been watching your videos uploaded around the time your house burned down (sad face implied). I even subscribed... But then I saw this one and remembered I've seen and enjoyed it already. Why didn't I subscribe back then? Weird...
Rip CRT
I'm glad I subscribed to interdimensional cable.
Aww, that TV didn't get to burn down with your house. Damn bees!
Now he doesn't have anything YEET
Holy shit that's a lot of bees!
I know I'm a year late, but thanks Will's new neighbors!
"Maybe we shouldn't push it that hard." VWRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Coming back at ya with another one of them block rockin bees...
the image of William in the plastic is actually really cool and arty
Make a toilet that when you flush it, it just sprays it all back out, but is just for the those hot days, or if another bad fire happens it can be an extinguisher.
were there actually that many bees in there
It's been a year Osman! make a part 2!
You dumb bitch. Just because you dye something black doesn’t mean less light will go through it. How about painting the fucking disk in a metallic paint that actually WILL block light you dumb bitch. Dumb fucking bitch.
don't throw or break crt tvs beause if u break open the tube toxic mercury gas and chemicals will come out
The second he said "lets use a brushless motor" I knew it was a squirrel cage and he was gonna burn it out!
Toast cat shirt :D is mah favourite. My cat hates toast ??
FREEEEEE SHIT!!!
W O W T H A T S A L O T O F B E E S
I'm so happy even though knuckles could not find the way anywhere else than in our hearts (R.I.P knuckles 2013-2018)
Someone needs to hook this man up to justin roiland
B E E S
All the retro video gamers are crying over the loss of another CRT.... I LOVE IT!!!! It was a lot of bees.
Why would you break the tv it was bee powered that is normal the bees power the tv
It's always cool to learn your favorite YouTubers like the same stuff you do. I didn't know anybody else watches "That's A Lot of Bees", but it's really a quality show.
I didnt get any of this. Still enjoyed it tho
Making an old-timey tv with modern technology.
4:08
Wow I didn’t know he had inter-dimensional cable
I want more WOW! thats a lot of bees. Now pls
Meh..."WOW! That's A Lot Of Bees!" totally jumped the shark two seasons ago.
Did you go to Uni to do any of this or are you just risking everything?
The mechanical tv was too noisy, thats why it failed. Like yours.
Thanks to you, I thought I had bees in my parents tv and did the same thing you did. Except i couldnt lift the counsole tv over my head, so I put my foot through it. My dad threw me out. He wont talk to me now.
Still waiting on iteration 2
All your shirts are awesome
5:15 there was an accident.
maybee it's time for a Mk 2?
LAZER TIME! PEW PEW PEW PEW pew pew
How I watch William Osman Videos: William: The way this mechanical Television will work Me :I... William: ITS LAZER TIME Me: MUFUCKIN LAAZUUUUUUUURSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!
*Horrible splintery mess* "That looks good." <3
3:56 I have the same adapter!! I use it for my Helios 44-2. Super dank lens. Try it out if you get the chance!
Legend says that TV was defeated by william
The narrator of “Wow! That’s a Lot of Bees” sounds like Mr.Poopy Butthole.
Guys did you here they are making a remake of Wow That's A Lot Of Bees!
Should have just used some black plastic or painted it, hindsight is 20/20 though
This dude gets the Justin Roiland brand of humour.
Do part 2!
that intro makes me believe you live in some rick and morty universe
WOW! (That's a lot of bees...)
stick the sharpie up your pooper!
That was the day the CRTV television died
why didn't you just spay paint the disc ?
Was there ever a 2.0 version of this?
William is my spirit animal
Wouldn't synchronisation be easier if the camera disc and the TV disc were the same size?
I don't understand how any of this works
every melee player cries rn
please upload a full episode of thats a lot of bees
Everything in thats alot of bees sounds like it's from interdimensional cable
The curvature is off because of the disk diameter difference.
wow willy i love you im rluyy drunk tho
He never got to v2
I've watched this 9 times
1:00 what’s the song
Is that the Brea Dam?... In Fullerton?
I need to see bees, a lot of them, in EVERY EPISODE!!
“I gotta fart” fart
dick fart
you would be a great teacher, you could just show them some of your vids.
I hope your nice neighbours are okay since the fire!
WELCOME BACK TO, THAT'S A LOT OF BEES!
What in the fuck you’re a genious!
2:56 gulp
I feel bad about the fire mmmaaaannn
This is my favorite video on youtube.
the tv seen better days
gas springs on the hood for your laser cutter are mounted upside down :( (the cylinder body should be facing up, not piston rod up)
Is your house uhhhh beter dont know is that the right word uhh can you rebuild it or something
So black spray paint was less available than fountain ink reservoir?
its interesting how the popularity of the mechanical TV has resurged in the last couple of years. I guess there are others out there that are interested in the same thing at the same time
I just noticed there’s a freaking Aperture Science logo on his PC.
What is that bee thing from?
This was frustrating to watch
he's one of those dudes that play around a lot but are literal geniuses
Can you try melting a gallium by lazer
While I was watching the bee intro a bee went into my ear.
that first wheel looked like an orange
wait was there really bees
I don't know why but 0:37 gets me every time
0:37 Don't you just hate it when that happens
Can i get the full series of "WOW! That is a lot of bees"?P.S That os a lot of bees!!!
Its sad watching this
Why hello there, I have a new haircut ??????
Man I love your videos! They're keeping me sane right now
Me watching his videos: Wut? Umm... English please?
You should revisit this project
Can i watch porn on it
Your house will on forever on youtube
Does anybody else just want to clean his home?
Hollup he just threw a TV onto a gas line.
Glad you trashed that old CRT, one less thing to catch on fire.
Very sexy
You sound like a character on rick and morty during the bee show
Lol 2:52 ??
Dibs on this guy when the world goes to shit. Y'all will be in the stone age while I'm playing Doom on a mechanical TV...
maybe you will have better luck with a mirror...
Im actually in love with you. Wow.
Your bee voice sounds exactly like mr.meeseeks!!!
You should just buy a TV with less bees in it next time. XD Well done, by the way, sometimes a project might not yield a super satisfying conclusion, but at least you learned a lot, and got to practice lots of creative engineering. :)
Your just asking for a paper cut
"Hey where do you want me to put these knives?" Me: Just put it 'nyah'.
Get the parts from the Narrow-bandwidth Television Association club on line. or buy a MUTR televisor kit.easy to build.
WOAH NOE NOT THE BEEES NOT THE BEEES AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH O NOE MY EYEEES MY EYEEES
What channel do I find the Bee show?
i own that cat tee shirt
Rick and Morty who?
Lmao i thought it was me for a second but them im like dude this is like my second video here XD
You should do a wow that's alot of bees episode with Justin Roiland
"why is everything such a struggle" -William Osman 2017 that has to be my favourite quote of all time
7:20 reminds me of watching the Spice channel back in the 90’s.
Hellow pipel of eart build mi a rc UFO that can drive and fly
Make a robot that has a laser that ignites fireworks that looks like a cat
Anyone else not really understand what he is doing but still enjoy it
Your house is a mess! LOL
Will it would be a whole lot more simple if you bought a new tv
Is it retina?
RIP old tv april18 2017

Hi william do you now my name is wilhelm in german in english means william
Philo T. Farnsworth is turning in his grave
MAKE VERSION 2 YOU BITCH
make V2!
This might be the most entertaining channel on YouTube.
When the lady pops up, "Wow, that's a HUGE bee!"
Please do a working versio of this!
Great build! now put an (passive) IR sensor in place of the photo transistor and a UV sensor and... if you are really smart (and a lot more work) a WIFI antenna in the aperture. Then you can see your room lit up by radio waves. That is a challenge :-D
Say hi and thanks to that neighbor for me
When are we getting terrible TV 2.0?
Now that you have looked at mechanical things, you can now look at my nature videos! Everyone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I honestly subscribed just because of the intro
No joke, I had that tv at the beginning that he broke when I was like 9, btw I’m 12
Ahhh yes, my grandpapa told me of these tvs from the early 20th century that used microchips, wiring, and circuit boards
I gotta fart ??
were you to trying and show off to the ladies
This mofo just make a tv? Lol. Golden!!!
OH NO NOT THE BEES! NOT THE BEES! AUGHHHHH! AUGHHHHHHHHH!
This bee show should be on interdimensional tv
It's so crazy how back that this mechanical tv was the only way, and now we just have this super magical device that we watch videos from now.
Cgi
I want a shirt that’s says “Wow! That’s a LOT of Bees!”
crt lives matter
He is actually pretty smart
can i get a free t-shirt if i live in canada?
R u poor
Why does that “that’s a lot of bess” remind me of “ants in my eyes Johnson” from rick and morty ??
Ayo Will I'm looking at creating a movie length feature of "that's a lot of bees" contact me for info I need you to clear this for copyright etc (dw im messin, but please make that)
Man hurry up on mark 2
Where has this channel been all my life

Make a Babbage Engine out of different kinds of fruit
7:05 boom hair cut~~~~!!!!!!
Omg please finish it i was waiting for this one
You Should make a lightsaber
“Maybe we shouldn’t push it that hard” pushes it harder
try 3d printing parts with a 3d printer the laser is not the best option
Hey William can you revisit this project, I think it would be cool to see what you can do now.
wow where is the v2? :(
Black poster board would have been a good idea lol
in a world where black spraypaint doesn't exist...
“Bee orgy” - William Osman 2017
When is version two out!?!!
Wow those bees
This man is brilliant but has he never heard of paint??
you must be a gamer
Did the bees you freed make more shirts?
Wtf do you do with all this knowledge?
please what CAD software do you use? :)
Laser cut a wearable Nicholas Cage mask... With a lot of bees
Osman what do you do as a person besides making videos. You seem very smart so I'm wondering what you do as a career/what you studied in college or university.
Your partner must have amazing patience
I like your new neighbors.
The sad part is there isn't a lot of bees.
I wish this video had more cows
make a machine that does nothing useful at all!
love jour nyaaaah
I think the government bought William's filmmaker thing here, studied its mechanics, built a tape recorder from the same materials William used, and filmed all of their space recordings with it.
https://i.imgur.com/EeAV0R3.jpg
Whats the Original of "wow thats a Lot of Bees"??? I need to know
I like ur Vids senpai"3
"William Osman creates headphones" "William Osman creates a Disney Film" "William Osman lands on the moon"
Wait, how did you get those bees into the TV?
hia
U did better than ben heck
This is impossible for me to comprehend wtf
Interested to see how v2 pans out.
I am very stupid so I like smart people to do things for me
My beard has a beard crush on your beard.
WTF WHY DID YOU KILL A CRT WE NEED THOSE!!! Kill a shitty LCD screen instead ;_;
plz put download link for WOW! that is a lot of bees!
Use that 'holoclock' design to make a small monitor that plays tetris using THREE L.E.Ds (rgb)
WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF BEEEES
Awe cool !! I had no idea someone invented a mechanical television. Is that ever neat ! Dude , those bees coming outta your TV when you smashed it looked pretty real. Was it CG or did that actually happen ?
Solid works > inventor
This is really cool.
Yay for Williams's new neighbors! ??
DUDE I HAVE THAT SAME SHIRT
What's this!? A delightful family picnic strictly lacking in BEES!? More BEES should put a stop to this!!!
All of these parts look like hungry frog emojis.
This is amazing :D
0:37 totes real bees
You became my favourite channel within 2 hours of me finding you
You should totally do a better v2
He has a laser, about 3 computers, and wood and other supplies. Yet he doesn't have a TV
not quite like yours, could be the root problem though, try foil or mylar tape for light blocking https://youtu.be/RdYHljZi7ys
Make a second version
Look at that bee it hungry
That TV you broke had a considerable amount of lead in it. Hopefully you cleaned it up.
How does one even get that many bees in a tv????????
omg william u watch thats a lot of bees too ?!
This idea may have already been posted, but I don't know, also I am completely lost when it comes to this level of genius, but here goes nothing. Since the wheels are different sizes but are using the same motor, wouldn't that cause the larger disc to rotate a little slower? Since it has a larger surface area? In my eyes this could possibly fix the improper alignment issue, but probably not. Also if you're reading this William I love your content!!
I would like somebody to diy his studio and make it organized
fav yutuber
anyone notice the haircut he got?
You promised the toaster full of bees was the last bee joke!
MAKE IT SO THE LAZER MAKES LAZER SOUNDS!!!!!!!! THUMB UP!!!!!!!!!
Work on Gen 2!!!! :D
Is that an Aperture logo on the PC Tower?
I'm literally so in love with you.
WOW! THAT'S A LOT OF BEES
were those bees real?
We need the video wow that's a lot of bees
Thank god for the laser cutter because I don't think William is very good with scissors
Wow that's a lot of bees sounds like something from Rick and Morty
8:43 couldve just covered the holes and just drill new ones
Man William, your channel is an amazing combination of ridiculous nonsensical comedy and incredibly high-level engineering intelligence and skill. Carry on!
Wat?
HOW CAN YOU WORK IN THERE
What's your home screen on your computer??!
cool i got highlighted
Not sure if you're smart or a complete moron, I'm getting mixed feelings
you sir are comically brilliant
Why don't you try to make this out of wood or metal?
Wow, dude. Why do you have your own 2D CNC? Is that cheaper than a 3D one these days (a.k.a. 3D printer)?
?????? WOW Thati a lot of BEEs!!! ??????
Ok, i need to build lasers, and cutting tables now.
So, you can watch a 1000fps video on a mechanical TV in real time, as long as the disk spins fast enough? Sounds like the future to me.
Instead of having the camera focus light from the lens onto the sensor directly, you could have it focus onto a piece of transparent paper, with the light sensor behind it.
This guys work ethic...
Cuz sry paint doesnt exist
This is hilarious he is idioticly smart!
have you ever started a project thinking it would take a week and then two weeks later
i gotta fart ?? these videos are great
Am I really the only one who noticed that he got a haircut mid-video? Probably took him weeks to build this.
I subed
Fun fact: I have apiphobia! I had an anxiety attack 30 seconds into this video! Woo, fun times.
DO ANOTHER ITERATION SENPAIIIII
O H N O N O T T H E B E E S !
BUIOD A _IANO
ive always wanted to see a working mechanical TV
The "wow that's a lot of bees!" Skit seems entirely inspired by Justin roilands improv skits
What if will is filled with bees? Conspiracy!
Why does he....nya
Amazing videos??
Make a plane
You were going to make a tv, so why a camera? Wouldn't it be more legit if you only made the tv and a circuit that decodes a real tv signal so it could be shown on your mechanical tv?
Damn u cute doe
I have that same shirt
I'm confused why you didn't just use black spray paint.
i like bee humor
All the way to 0:45 I was laughing so hard ??
pssst... black acrylic paint
The bees make the video perfect
Who doesn't actually get a single thing? Just me? Ok...
2:56 nice butt ??????
It's like Justin Roiland and the director of The Office decided to re-boot Mythbusters.
You should try making a hurdy-gurdy.
This guy is a genius and equally hilarious?? Easy subscription
This is quickly becoming one of my favourite YouTube channels
Bee
build a projector
This is awesome, you should build rev 2!!!
No one's wondering why he lost a lot of hair during this vid??
Where can I buy a shirt :D
i dong understand... how does the light from the mechanical camera gets to the image
Good guy nieghbor
When is part 2
I really eager to clean up your room
XD
We have the same last name! Pretty cool
10/10 intro
i gotta fart
Subbed ????
3:50 looks like q screaming frog
a lot of bees
V2 !!!!!!!!!!!
"You need to pay me for shipping" XD
put your finger in the laser
I think the funniest part is he took so long to build this he got a haircut between build days lol
i would never watch that tv i need TECHNOLOGY
he's adorable
WOW THATS ALOT OF BEES
This channel is like a mix of codys lab and official duck studios xD
BEEESSSS
Make a laser cutter style contraption to make art (spray paint or brush or something)?
how do you not have more subs. you put humor creativity and "education" all together
I bet this things cost a fourtune when they were new.
I have a girlfriend who loves cats that's all you need to know
The editing on this channels videos is second to none.
That bees thing though. I love it. Please send me the link to the video so I can watch the full episode of "WOAH! THAT'S A LOT OF BEES!"
"I'll take a pound of bees." "THAT'S A LOT OF BEES!!"
I HAVE THAT SHIRT AND I WEAR IT TO BED EVERY NIGHT
Ya like jazz?
You showed those bees
Damn, clean your desk m8
yes
make a Stirling engine out of random shit
like is you dont really understand the tech-y part of these videos but still watch them anyways
I love your editing
Poor CRT.
MY GOD. IT'S FULL OF BEES
Make the worlds largest penis
That's how you end it? with a fail? lame. You should have just waited until you made a working one to release a video. Still, If you think about how a CRT tv works those are more amazing than these, in my opinion. To make a single beam move that fast and accurately using analog electronics is one hell of an amazing feat if you ask me.
VERSION 2!!!
whats up with the bees wtf
Wow That's a lot of Bees! Needs to be a feature length film
what is that Wow! THat's A Lot Of Bees from? I swear i have seen it before stumbling upon this channel today and its bugging me cuz I can't find anything about it lmao
Omg, my dad has that same shirt!!!
DI-WHY ONE WHEEL!
can you make guacamole with a paper shredder?
These videos both crack me up and intrigue me. Keep them up. Do you even have a cat?

I don't know if this will work but I made this gif for you https://my.mixtape.moe/bxcpkn.gif
you should make a working gun/cannon of sorts...idk tbh I'm very non creative lol but these videos are awesome, keep up the good work
#SaveTheBees
the part where the tv is just slidding made me spit out my drink
@William Osman how did you learn to do all this stuff? any book refs? ??
i feel like that was a rick and morty sketch
dam he's so fit
"mechanical". Has electronics. probably uses film. yeah. okay
As an executive producer on "Holy! That is a ton of Wasps!" and "Woah! That is a menagerie of Hornets!" I can officially support the claim that yes, that is a lot of bees.
"a ream of 200"
Give me that broken TV for parts
Rick how many bees are there? A lot of bees morty
Is that a normal flat screen monitor inside the old tube tv shell at the end bee part?
Do a second one
That hairCUT really threw me off.
You guys need to do some voice overs or something xD
I really like your videos will. You care about your videos and it shows. I hope you get millions of followers.
guy is lacking a simple saw, yet he have a FUCKING LASER
Why not just a projector in a box?
well mechanical tv easy . camera nope Germans used 35mm to project the image to mechanical tv transmitted to tube television.
I'm Mr Beeseeks look at Bees!
NOOOOOOOOOOO Not The Bees
i don't understand shit of all the explaining he does but i just love his videos, he just fucking created a tv himself lol well kinda,
Hey Will, what is the name of the bee video? Also make a windshield wipers frisbee thrower thing
The host of "Wow! That's a lot of Bees!" 's voice sounds like a Justin Roiland character
nyaw
That music is so distracting if you know who Rob Ferretti is (it's his outtro song).
wow that's a lot of bees. (wait a minute) breaks the tv and theres actually bees
NO THE POOR CRT AHHHH
As someone who owns that exact shirt, I have to ask; how many people have asked you " Hey is that you're cat?" I'm up to about 15 or so, and I wish I was lucky enough that, that was my precious kitty
Aluminum foil works great for blocking light.
those are only like at least 20 bees step up ur bee game

you deserve more subs and views i hope you have a good job and get alot of money
hm... which software are you using at @6:09? Looks like a hantek gui but i had a lot of problems with different versions...
+William Osman do you have any designs for your laser as really like the look of yours? would u be able to email dxf files for laser plates?
build a blender with a fidget spinner holding the blades
Those CRT tv's contain lead so be careful.
This dude would be the worst/funnest roommate
Its a complicated mirror
subscribing because your content is good. TO CLARIFY:it's because of the aperture computer case
kids In Africa could have ate that TV, oh wait it will arrive on a large barge along with a lot of other broken stuff.
Bees!
I'd watch "That's a Lot of Bees!"
IM SO EXITED IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THAT CAT SHIRT
yeah but do you have a bee tee?
The commitment of wearing the same shirt for two weeks is appreciated.
i once thought my project was going to take two to three weeks but now it's taking me over three months because i can't get a stupid motor to turn! I'm getting so frustrated because that's the only thing that isn't working.
yes but why the fuck would you break a display full of mercury in a water spillway

Wow thats alot of bees????????
not to be rude my friend told me that hes gay is that true
Well then I guess I'm not getting a tee shirt I live in canada
where do you get the cat shirts?
I have that same shirt
your smart and retarded at the same time
Can you please upload that "that's a lot of bees" video. It had me laughing my ass off ??
Nyaah
Saw this video, saw TV destruction. Instant sub.
How much acid do you consume before deciding which cat shirt to wear?
Keeps shirt the same for continuity, gets a haircut...
You probably shouldn't go pushing CRT TVs down ramps. If the tube breaks, it will implode with bomb-like force.
I really need a shirt pleeeeeeaseeeee

what song is this 2:24
can u test the power of your lazer cutter using a solor panel or a light meter?
Not the only way or the simplest way. It was far from simple. Those machines were complicated, noisy, and huge.
Make another episode for further tinkering with the tv.
i think if you skip making the camera and just use a digital image on a computer and have the brightness values of the pixels transmitted through the audio jack, and feed that into the LED intensity, you could get it working.?
You are what makes YouTube great!
why not black paint...
Please make 2.0

Your videos keep me up at night they are so interesting.
I don't live in the USA, So don't bother given me a T-shirt... Was kinda looking forward to seeing it work
That was amazing lol I love your videos
Question for @William Osman: What if, instead of flipping the viewer wheel, you made it spin in the other direction? I feel like that would work, and it would deal with the problem of the bending problem
sharpies aren't black enough, should be using something like a faber castell black ink pen.
William is my spirit animal
This guy diserves a lot of subscribers. You can tell he is putting a lot of work into his videos.
he has a small house
It's a shame they cancelled "Wow, That's A Lot of Bees!" Its spinoff "Huh, That's a Surprisingly Reasonable Amount of Bees." doesn't really capture the feel of the original.
Neooa
Do iteration two please!
I would watch "Wow That's A lot Of Bees!."
you should light uo your whole house with lightbulds powerd by computers fans (concept ac current) adding magnets on the fan blades and adding one to spin the oppisite disptrudting enough eletricy to the buld but the buld has to be a led type and figure the rest please.....and conect all the bulds so to one switch so you dont have to use your dc current free light ;) i suggest 10 fans and 10 lights maybe more sorry for my spelling lol fucken bees
What did that CRT TV ever do to you? You could have played Duck Hunt on that if you had an NES and light Zapper.

It's not mechanical if you use a motor and an electronic circuit board.
THE BEEEEEEEEEZ
I want a pilot episode of "WOW, That's a lot of bees"!
Do a V2 that ditches the camera and just uses a photo sensor to read the rotational speed and map a regular video signal onto it. Or translate a digital video. That way you can watch "wow that's a lot of bees" on it.
luv this channel
lazer cut too many bees
Nyaaah
my girlfriend would love your shirts
More people need to know about this channel
wow thats alot of cats peripd
oh cool thats a lot of cat t shirrr=rrr=rrrts
aww man
is this show on netflix?
Took me a minute to recognize you, Jesse Pinkman.
Children in Africa could have eaten that tv Yes I'll go kill myself
I want part 2 now

why I dind't discover this channel before? Well, better later than never, I suppose!
how does a tinkerer not have a can of black spray paint handy?
You look like Arron Paul...kinda (Jesse pinkman)
Philo Farnsworth and Charles Francis Jenkins made the tv perfectly with the technology of their time. now that we have advanced technology shouldn't it suppose to be better?

Love your videos cat
are your neighbors really nice? They seem really nice.

you're like the what used to be the king of random...
XDDDD bees
How bout orBEES?
Has anyone else been binge watching the episodes? No... just me
hahhahaah you're so fun!
will you make a part 2
at 105 the content cop theme is playing
Pls where is the "wow that's a lot of bees" video?? Really don't know why but must see a full vid of in tho

I wanna see the bees on a shirt
#dvsnsrock
That's a lot of n?u?t?s? bees!
i have that same shirt and this makes me happy
I hate to be that guy, but wouldn't it have been easier to buy black cardstock? Or is that a terrible idea to put in a laser cutter?
Hi
Oh man, I've been wanting to build a mechanical TV for ages!
I like your videos. Keep doing what the fuck you're doing! Thanks.
there was a bee hive IN YOUR TV?
ive never heard so many nyuhs in my life
I've been watching you for a few days now, but I'm confused you have some proper tools, like CAD systems, and a laser cutter, but you use the worst building materials, like cereal boxes and low grade plywood. Why not use better particle boards, or materials where we don't have to watch you break the material several times and remake it. If you are going to build complex objects using sophisticated tools, save us the frusteration of watching you cobble it together with garbage. Maybe thats the show gimmick, but a slight upgrade of your materials would really help.
Wtf is with the bees?
that poor crt, you could have used it to play melee
Kind of like a complex zoetrope.
Draco Malfoy, what are you doing out of character?
No but seriously, can we make a petition to netflix to turn "WOW THATS A LOT OF BEES!" into an actual fuckin show? Voiced by Will? Please?
please do version 2!
Rick and Marty is best oooooo and see if a laser can cut through gallium
IT'S LAZER TIMEEEE
episode where hair continuity doesn't matter. love it!
What's wrong with black mount board? ?? it's easy to get hold of!
Why dosent your channel have more subs? your channel is very good!
This is going to go, NYAA Nyaa~
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON TV!?!?!? GO OUTSIDE IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! AAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Do a hanglider for Redbulls Flutagg or start your own competition
The narrator for Wow! That's a lot of bees! sounds like a Justin Roiland character
Please make a V2 of this project soon, it's really cool.
when i see the glowing thing in the background of the laser it looks like you guys are smoking somthing like crack
where is the "wow that's alot of bees" thing from? any stand alone video for that???
He's surprisingly sexy
i dont understand how you could dislike someting like this ?
Can we have the real footage of the bees so we can make a 10hours version of it ?
how...how does this have such few views... this guy designed and built a mechanical tv from scratch...
many things going on
What's with all the bees?
0:42 THERE WERE BEES LIVING IN YOUR TV? HOW
please upload "WOW That's a lot of BEEs!!!" I want to watch it.
BEE careful Doc you don't wanna get STUNG by lightning
need this wow thats a lot of bees clip
You definitely should do another iteration!!!
I reallt want to watch "wow thats alot of bees" now
ever heard of black paint
3:16 this just turned into a HowToBasic video
I got re-notified of this. It must Bee Bee-cause it's awesome. Prolly.d
Dude we have like all of the same shirts
Do iteration 2. Improve design.
Just found your channel. Your videos are literally the best things I've ever seen.
if i was your neighbor i would of waited for you to figure out that your saw wouldn't work to cut that huge piece of wood.
We need that bee show on the TV.
i love bees
I want an episode of wow thats a lot of bees
I love that your neighbors are like heck no we need to help this poor engineer
Where can I find the Bee video? And gr8 video as always!
I have the same shirt!
Would the bending have anything to do with the delay between image seen and image presented? Changing with the positioning of the holes according the the roundness of the disk?
This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think that's NOT ENOUGH bees. Unrelated: Did you break off the chunk of solar panel yourself, and when you say the photoresister wasn't responsive in low light, do you mean you literally saw no response at all?
Check out my build... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-HaRZFvikA
will the next attempt have a sequel to "wow that's a lot of bees?"
test
It took me a few years to make a mechanical camera....my success ended up being using a photo multiplier tube ...not so much that but because i had to use one it led me to the reason my other direct light ones failed ......you need to enclose your camera in a light proof box do not let one photon from out side get in ....it will be noise that will wipe out whats coming from the lens ...have a look at the nbtv forum harry dalek ...on off topic ...there in construction builds is my project a stand alone camera ...its still in bits on my bench to many projects that take my time up ...but work it does
lol you always have cartons of bud light. How much bud light do you drink on a daily basis?
You're a genius.
What I took away from this video: MAN THAT'S A LOT OF BEES!
Who do I need to pay to get a 30 minute proper episode of "That's a lot of bees"? :O
when you cut matching interlacing pieces, how much clearance do you need to keep to ensure it slides together? is it just line for line?? i see your using solidworks, do you have to put your models in a drawing and then save out as a dxf to send to your laser? have i missed a video that answers all this....?? thanks!
goddamn that's an interesting project. that you got as far as you did is astounding. i can't wait for version 2!
Just had a thought that I'm sure you've already had: Would it work well at all to have used your friend Engelbert Humperdinck as the spinning platters? Or would the records have weighed too much to get them to spin at the speeds you'd need? I'd imagine that a solid black record would be better at blocking out light than paper dyed black. That is, unless vinyl doesn't like to be laser cut, I suppose. Also slight apologies for putting so many comments on your videos all the time. I just really like your style and I end up thinking about how one might improve upon the stuff you do pretty often.
William Osman: Bee Hunter.
you should give me the shirt for social akwardness
Holy shit this is such a cool project! Just found your channel via Cooking With Babbish (dude has god taste) and you got just a sub for life!
Catapult that launches itself?
Can you make windscreen wipers for glasses so I can see when I cycle in the rain?
make a puzzle
Can you laser engrave various candy?
I have the same name as you
Hey William! I just discovered your channel and have watched just about everything you've published at this point. Lovin' it, man; keep it up and you'll have a huge channel in no time. That said, I've seen you complain a couple times about the loudness of your air compressor. I have one just like it and it is louder than hell. The next one I get, and what I'd suggest to you as well, is one made by California Air Tools. I've used one at a friend's shop and it is just so much quieter. I have no affiliation with them, but I know good gear when I see it. Might make your laser cutting lifestyle a bit more bearable. Keep on kicking ass with these videos, man!
You should make a miniature microwave that is the size of a single microwave burrito.
Brilliant! I love it!
Hey bro can you "cut" an egg with the laser? It may get a bit messy though :p. It would be interesting to also cut a mushroom being they can't be burnt. :D
Wow that's really cool! I made one that still isn't working properly and it took me 5 years!
Aaaand now I've watched all the videos... :(
could you make something like a rose engine with a laser cutter?
Yet another amazing project! ("Not the bees!")
I subscribed the moment tethered was "wow! That is a lot of bees!" Was on the tv
Totally enjoyed your video and love the look of your mechanical TV setup. I personally have made a few mechanical disc TVs and a mechanical camera in my time, I can totally relate to a 1 week project turning into a few to several weeks, happens to me all the time lol. Anyhow I successfully made a mechanical camera/TV unit using a single LP record as a disc and I drilled 1.5 spirals of holes into the disc, the resolution was 32 lines NBTV standard, there's 48 holes in the disc and how it works is you have hole 1 on the camera side picking up the light and hole 17 displaying the light at the same time, then hole 2 pickup hole 18 receive, hole 3 pickup hole 19 receive and so on till you get to hole 32 pickup and hole 48 receive and then start over again, and so you can pickup and display pictures on the one disc. My mechanical camera/TV project can be seen here http://www.taswegian.com/NBTV/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1588 and my vlogs can be seen on my channel and here's a recording of my camera/TV displaying live pictures https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY9mwXC--ro . Anothering to mention too, make your holes much smaller as that will vastly improve the detail of your images, or alternatively use lens beads for your discs as the light will be pin pointed to the centre of the beads and be a sharp line rather than a soft thick line.
I love your content and I always wonder why you only upload every so often. Then I remember, duh, these projects take a hell of a lot of time. Good luck with version 2!
next you should build a bee
I have matte black spraypaint I've used to make pinhole cameras.... a little bit better than rit dye I think
Hello, I was wondering if you could visit my YouTube page and rate my two songs, I wanted you opinion because you my favorite YouTuber and I want to be like you.
Actually, this wasn't a bad attempt for a first iteration, it always looks easier than it really is, and your "discovery" that a camera is MUCH harder than the monitor is spot on. Nonetheless you showed the basic concepts of a mechanical TV really well. 1) the apertures are way too large for a true picture, for disks of this size they should be of the order of 1mm - you could go with something the size you have if you fill them with optical quality acrylic balls that act as lenses - which is faithful, to a degree, to the first television prototypes that used glass lenses. These "balls" are readily available in the US and quite cheap. The light source could then be just a single LED. 2) The easiest way to construct a camera/monitor system is to have the disks ate either end of an axle driven by a single motor. Alternatively, you can just continue the aperture spiral another half turn and have the camera the left side of the disk and the monitor on the right.
is this 'mechanical' TV the result of a mechanical engineering degree? is there some way of adding mechanical touch so that you could make a mechanical phone or tablet?
I feel like a cotton candy machine might be just complicated and stupid enough for you to be able to make...
I feel like "wow that's a lot of bees" belongs on Rick and morty
Will... can I call you Will? Will, I think you could solve your arc-length and alignment problems in software. Actually, I think you could even solve any brightness problems as well (caused by direct vs indirect light hitting your sensor). Now that I think of it, better software could even help you solve the "not randomly picking me for free stuff giveaways" problem. And don't listen to anyone that says you can't control a mechanical TV with digital circuitry. They're clearly just jealous of your hair dresser, objectively speaking.
How'd you learn all of this? It seems like you know a lot... but just not enough. :D
Tremendous work! Thanks for a great video
The way you say "here" like Eric Cartman always gets me
love the content. keep it up
Are you going to make a video on your laser cutter? I don't know if it would be cost efficient to build my own so I am wondering how many watts your laser is, and how much it costs. It looks like it has a hoge cutting space which seems like it would be very useful. Thanks!
Yeah he's sleeping now he's so cute!!!!
Pretty ok Sam throwing up though right now ??
Zoom jokes are best jokes, also nice t-shirt.
i want a tv full of bees if i do get one i won't "bee"live it
how's life William
Wow that mechanical tv is really bad! ps this is Caelan
Hay, William. You should solder some basic electronics kit with your laser. like this: https://youtu.be/KnyB9btlhS8
?????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????? ? ??? ??? ?????? :))
try to lazer cut a fidget spinner like if you agree
I'm so angry to youtube for not giving me notifications (it should) when you upload. But it's always nice to find out that there's a new vid that i haven't seen yet.
Could you laser cut / cook eggs and make 3D patterns depending on where and how much you heat the shells?
Can you please laser your hands
Hi Will, Your videos are the highlight of my life. thank you.
This is the comment that will be a winner of a giveaway (I'm sure the website will pick this )
CAN LASERS MAKE CAT FIGURES?
OH BEEhave
cool project! looove it!
could you make me a prosthetic finger tip? I'm not kidding. I live in Canada and I would pay for shipping (and materials). I can send you pics and measurements of my amputated finger.
You should try and design a remote control lawnmower. I'm not a very smart person so it's probably not easily do-able and that's okay
I want to see a wow that's a lot of bees tshirts.
Could you try 3d printing metal by melting metal powder with the laser cutter?
You're equal parts genius and moron. It's fantastic.
What are the chances of winning a "WOW! That's a lot of BEEs!" shirt? Asking for a friend
'This one goes h'mya' Cartman is the best.
Even though it didn't really work, the problems you ran into with curvature are actually a really neat way of visualizing how a lot of modern cameras capture an image. They generally draw the image field by field, one after the other. This is why there's lots of footage out there of airplane propellers appearing to curve, because the camera draws the image in those fields. In the first field a blade might be in the 12o'clock position, and in the next field it might be in the 3o'clock position. The end result is this eerie sort of curvature. Your issues are 100% related to synchronization. I'm sure you've seen footage of fast moving rotational objects, like helicopter blades or the tires on a car or bicycle. If you match the shutter rate and framerate with the rotations per second of the object, you will capture what appears to be an unmoving object. It's a really really really similar concept to the stroboscope. In fact it's basically the exact same thing. From what I've seen of functional mechanical TVs, they all seem to operate much much slower than what you've been running yours at. The images appear to be sub 10FPS, which in the context of rotational motion is an incredible difference in speed. That could also have contributed to the lack of proper synchronization. I'm sure you'll figure this out in the future if you ever decide to revisit it. Cool project.

I've got one for ya, something I've always wanted to do.. Bounce some micro/radiowaves off the moon.. How cool would that be?
Can you make more episodes of WOW That's a lot of bees?
Release "wow that's a lot of bees" on VHS
Try making a r/c airboat out of your neighbors trash
We went from Ham Vin Diesel to this?! That's quite the jump. Amazing video. Bravo!!
what about laser cutting mr.poopy butthole from rick and morty and use bacon as the material for a bust.
Please don't pick me for a giveaway:: I'm just happy i found this channel.
Finally you're back!!!!
the Wow! that's a lot of bees™ feels like it would be on a tv in Rick and Morty
"That's a lot of Bees" sounds like it comes from interdementional television. It's fantastic.
Way too many bees...
If you need to make cardboard black use spray paint. Works well.
Can you 3D-print metal with your laser?
0:33 really disturbed me
I demand a full 1-hour documentary of WOW! thats a lot of BEES!!!
Bad scientist, can't even make a mechanical tv smh
waste of 10 minutes, imho. (god knows how much time you wasted doing this.)
You're too intelligent for what you do. keep up
Ever think about becoming an evil scientist? I think a cat-themed lab coat would be baller
Nice bees.
I love this channel.
laser a tattoo on a raw bit of pork then your self
This video became by favorite at exactly 2:57 ????
beez are gay. wasps for da win!!!
I had an idea but since I'm too lazy to start I'm gonna suggest it to you: you know nixie tubes? i wanted to cheaply replicate the appearance of one with optic fiber digits lit in orange or thin sheets of acrylic with drawn digits and the lights below them...
i really hope you will try this again. It is a super interesting project
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
The editing is gold. Fuckin hilarious
I wish there was a way to invest in a YouTube channel... I would invest money in this channel cause I know it's gonna blow up
I left a banana in my trashcan. So now my room smells like banana. This is a good thing because: 1. It smells like banana. 2. I can catch a monkey to wear the shirt I win.
Your channel is criminally unsubscribed
Who knew so many BEES could be inside a TV?!
Another hysterical video William! Good call on not using brushless lol overkill for sure.
How did you get those bees in your TV
You should redo the glass but purify the sands
> have you ever had one of those project you thought was going to take a week, then two weeks later .... Are we the same person?
I'll give you one million bees for a T-shirt
Holy fuck that intro made me cry
make a conveyor belt that helps convey new ideas
So good I watched it twice. This channel is gold.
Bees
Pleeeezz
Ples give me shirt
Make some kind of instrument. You could probably get a pretty decent ukulele with the laser cutter and some veneer, or make some other weird instrument. Obviously you'd end the video by playing Wonderwall.
also cite of cameraman john is expired! it is not working
thats awsome. never fails only one who do nothing
Make a mechanical watch
We love watching your channel, it makes us happy that we can watch all the things we would never EVER try on the laser be so brilliantly presented by you! .... but totally going to make some shirts now.... with 50% more nipple coverage...
William Osman, please oh please make a laser cut Zelda BOTW Guardian Sword. You are uniquely qualified for such a project after your excellent Dr Strange contraption.
Make a functional spongebob watch!
Dang it, I wanted one of those shirts. They look AMAZING
how many bees is way too many bees?
Look at my grades, wow! That's a lot of B's! (They were d's. Don't tell my mom.)
try building a working flying drone???
Hi will I like your videos You should make a janky ukulele or acoustic guitar I'd play it
\Do you have a Patreon account? This might be the one channel I'd donate to!
Hi bud
lasercut a lasercutter
Will you build me my musical instrument? I've been asking for the past 5 videos :(
You've quickly became my favorite YouTuber ha
I fully appreciate the 1 second drone(?) shot at 9:31. Love your attention to detail.
William Osman....MeEt Me!! William Fournier. get it? same first name
WHEN R U GONNA MAKE AN ENCLOSURE FOR YOUR LASER CUTTER WILL
I Found the bees!
Would it have been easier to just print 2-3 disks and glue them together to block more light, or was weight of the disks a concern? Great video by the way, I'm sure you learned a ton on this one!
I was hoping to see the finished device working at least well enough to be able to make out a semblance of the recorded image. Could you improve the mechanical camera? I look forward to see a part 2 of this! As a side note, some years back I thought up a concept for a mechanical video camera - it would be made of a row of photosensors on a spinning disk. The TV would be a row of LEDs on a spinning disk. I never actually made it, because other things came up. It would be an interesting project, and I expect it would be pretty easy to make. If you'd like to try making it, I think it would also make for an interesting video :)
you deserve WAY more subs
Make a 3d clear acrylic model of you and/or a cat
I fucking loved that intro. Lol. You're hilarious.
"Wow That's a lot of bees" is my favorite show! I'm glad someone else appreciates it!
I swear I feel like William is making crazy things so if he makes something really badass he'll become a billionaire
I love you vids and comedy, and I also love your shirts
first off, are you a bulldog or a cougar, second off, can you try and make your own superconductors?
Give me a t-shirt you commie :) just kidding i love you :)
Best intro yet
I feel I'm just watching a man descend into madness
Project request: build a robot that cooks a meal and serves it up on a plate at the push of a button. As a minimum requirement, the meal must contain at least 5 different ingredients and John has to eat it.
A lot of bees huh.
That's a lot of bees! needs to be its own series.
Is "Wow that's a lot of bees" a real tv show? If so I really want to watch it. If not I really want to watch all the footage that you have.
Laser cut a laser
music in the back ground is annoying.
sharpen your laser
I gotta get me one of them tee shirts, like meow. Just go ahead and send me one. I'm not kitten. Do it.
dank
You promised no more bees. You lied to me :(
is wow that's a lot of bees on Netflix?
Hey William! You should build a mechanical music box or you should build a type writer.
Laser cut glass
YASSS WILLIAM
as an aspiring young engineer, your channel has quickly grown to become one of my favorites. Keep on making cool shit!
Build some electrostatic loud speakers next !
Could the laser cutter cut out a smaller laser cutter, which then gets to cut a smaller one and repeated until the laser cutter is too tiny to be able to cut a smaller cutter?
I would love to see a part two.
Will you beeee awesome and send me a shirt?!
Build a wooden Chainmail chest piece? not sure how it'd work, but you could totally put a cat on it. Your videos rock! always a pleasure
Great content
I have a lot of free time now, since I've watched all the videos on your channel. I'd like to attempt to make my own mechanical TV. However, I don't own a laser cutter. Do you think I use some poster board and kitchen scissors?
What channel is "That's a Lot of Bees!" on?
OMG!, it's full of.... BEES!! :)
Make a computer mouse in the shape of a cat
This is great
Why does the bees show seem like it belongs on rick and morty? ??
Were you sponsored by American Eagle, 2:57 lol
I had never heard of mechanical tv.. Thats fucking cool... Hope you do part 2
I still need my breakfast contraption.. Im hungry

Cameraman John have my babies!

You could write the next Rick and morty tv show episode
bees are everywhere
I really love this, you are one of my favorite youtubers.
your videos are the best, they are funny entertaining and also educational
Wow, That's a lot of Bees! THE SERIES!
Slay me
Respect for following through even though it was painful. It was very interesting to see you troubleshooting it.
What CAD software does he use?
I think the real reason you can't send the shirts abroad is because bees are technically livestock and that's hard to get through US customs.
William, how can I prove my love for you?
Bee is love bee is life
2:52 "I gotta fart" farts
Every time you upload a new video I am eating a burrito.
For the record: When William called me (7:52) I was in the bathroom.
What channel is "wow that's a lot of bees" on?! I MUST KNOW
Love the bee show!
Where can I actually find this bees show?
10:34 nice bee roll
I actually don't think that was a lot of bees. ¯\__(?)__/¯
You are actually pretty inteligente and creative, why are you not working on nasa?
throwing a CRT off of a ramp? did you know that you are suicidal?
can you release the "wow that's a lot of bees" on its own video?
Make a table then stand on it
I like me some bees
Please make a video of "WOW That's a lot of BEEs!!!"
Why not. Make the rotors out of wood or heck even metal. You might could find a local fab shop that if you supply the material and cad they'll just charge the table time.
Can you do a laser cut longboard??
can i have a copy of wow! thats a lot of bees!
That really is a lot of bees
i hope you took out the flyback transformer to make a arc speaker.
you're incredibly smart, what college did you go to ?
Make a helicopter attack bee made out of bologna (must be BAR-S brand)
Where can I find the video with the bees? :3
Got anymore o dem shirts?
That bee show reminds me of something that'd be on interdemensional Tv
you should cut a pizza
Im very disapointed that my amazing pun didnt get picked, i think this comment picker is broken. I demand a revote. Also could you build something that attempts to fly? Like maybe a mechanical flying thing, like, a bird, or like, a butterfly?
i want a tee shirt
Have you built a pinhole camera yet? Similar concept, way more low tech.
who else wants a full episode of WOW that's a lot of bees!
'WOW! That's a Lot of Bees!' Brought to you by Justin Roiland
Where do you get your cat shirts? Particularly the one in this video?
hi
How many rpm does your TV have? That's a sentence I never thought I'd ask.
Build a chair that you can't possibly sit on.
Badass, I am stoked that you did this. Looking forward to version 2.
Will you look like a grown up Morty from Rick and Morty
This is fantastic. Keep going!
That mini orgasm you get when a new video is posted.
The reason it isnt working is because theres no bees in it like the one you smashed. Thats the secret to any television.
hELLO William OSman, u Are a very handsome man. Thx u for your time.
Was that justin roiland in your tv?
I want this documentary :D please make it a full episode just of that xD
I don't like things... I liked all your things.
You should maybe get a 3D printer to go with the laser. Versatility never hurt anyone. :D
I love your vids they are always awesome I look forward too all your vids ^^/ ??
This is honestly one of my favorite channels.
someone pplleeeease link the bee video...
Dammit, I don't live in the US and A. But you could make a laser cut t-shirt out of wood or cardboard, get the draft online and I'll cut it myself!
Can you release the entire "Wow! Thats a lot of Bees" video?
Hey Will, since bees are such a mainstay joke on your channel you should laser cut a beekeeping hive to raise awareness for the dwindling honeybee population. You could even make a few and give them away to promote people across the country to help our bee population! More hives would certainly help keep the swarms out of your electronics....
I'M JUST HERE SO I DON'T GET FINED
WELCOME BACK TO WOW THATS A LOT OF BEES LMAOOO IM DYING
Can we get a full episode of WOW That's a Lot of Bee's?
I want to know what was going on in your neighbor's head when you said "I have a piece of wood that I can't lasser table saw"
can you get a laser hair cut? You may need to use a dummy, but then again you could just not use a baby
Really great intro! How much is it to send a tshirt to sweden? :D
nice thumbnail
Sooo you make a T-Bee? xD
try to laser cut a key
no way you're reading this
I want a t shirt or prize. I love these videos While that is a lot of bees, at least you're not Ants in my eyes Johnson.
too many bees.
YOU GET A BEE AND YOU GET A BEE
impressive. you should try making a pair of pants with the laser.
Consistently the only YouTube/maker that makes me laugh out loud every video. It's like watching Einstein do calculations on the back of a bud light box. And I learn a fuuuuuuuuuccccccton. Another awesome video man.
can someone send me some dc drill motors please.......
Way too many beeeeths
USE ALL OF THE MOTORS!!!!!!!
Can i get a tshirt?
Dude I want to give you money to make more delicious sauce. Where your patreon at?
WILIYAMASMAND
>when you film for weeks and get a haircut but keep wearing the same dirty cat shirt so you don't break continuity never change
hey. ur kool.
Your videos are always hilarious.
Laser cut foosball table!
I would kill for a t shirt, something small like an ant but it would definitely die
William is secretly a villain training killer bees and evil mind control shirts that will help him take over the world!
you should laser cut a treadmill
This channel is fantastic
Can your next project be a gas powered DVD player?
?????? t-shirts
TwentyThree
I'd watch that bee show.
It's easter , how about building something related to eggs ? Like an egg-catapult or something :) Or laser cutting egg shells ?
What's a cat?
"I gotta fart" - William Osman 2017
can you laser cut a film video camera?
Will, this is the best one yet!
A lot of bees
i don't know how you continuously smile while putting yourself through these stressful scenarios but it's charming and don't stop thanks
You got a haircut mid-episode?
I love watching your process, man DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN. Also; I think you have more cat shirts than I have TRON shirts and that's quite a feat.
You should have actually just taken some white spray paint for example.. White gloss is a very efficient light-reflector believe it or not. Would have blocked it all out with a coat or two.(just to cut some time, less trial and error maybe.. I mean any color would have done really.)
Wow! That's a lot of bees!
:3c
Can you reach out to 'Ze Royal Viking'? He's your twin.
episode where will is camera man and john does the thing.
un-bee-lievable
Hey, that's still pretty good!
Beees at the end sound like something from Rick and Morty
Starving children in Africa could have eaten that TV.
meow meow cat eats carrot
This was my favorite episode of "Man That's a Lot of Bees!" Have you seen the first season before they got popular? So many bees!
i would watch that show
good shit keep it up
Where can I watch Wow! That's a lot of bees?
You sir, are my favorite nerd on YouTube! You deserve waay more subs!
That's Way Too Many Bees!
Willy Oz Best Channel on YouTube #1
This could well be the coolest thing you've done thus far, I don't know how you keep surpassing yourself every video. I can't wait for the OsmaScope* 2.0, would it be possible to power the rotation with a bicycle and are colour mechanical TVs possible? *Other variants are OsmaTrope, OsmaStrobe, OsmaTube, wasn't really sure which sounded best, so have them all.
Did you actually put bees in the TV or did you edit them in?
Could you convert bee movie on your computer and play it ?
You should modify one of those cheap $20 stand-up fans, and put some sort of tracking device on it so that the fan will always turn to blow on you wherever you walk.
new video. Means that its gonna be a good day ?
What's your education?
Welcome back to! Wow that's a lot of bees! Bees are the greatest! ?? ?? ?? ??
I had to invest in a Dyson Supersonic hair dryer so I could watch TV and take naps in peace... Highly worth it! Oh and nice fart lol
But can you watch porn on it?
I love the editing
Colab with neighbors? Please!
Wow ! I'm getting scared of all those bees ... should I burn my tv too ? I guess I'll do it just in case ... Also are you related to Justin Roiland , his evil twin maybe ? Coz your voice improv sound way similar to the ones he did on Rick & Morty !
You've should have just bought two vinlys!
8:05 Yeah...no idea what any of this means. Still a fun video to watch! xD "too many bees!" hahaha!
You've done television of the past, now do television of the future - smell-a-vision.
I rather enjoyed "Wow that's a lot of BEEs" I think it should be syndicated.
I freaking love his dude.
Laser cut an animatronic bee!
HEY.........Willll.... Can you make something that spins really fast then drops onto the floor? Cuz it would spin... and role... and run over people... Well, K... BYE
I gotta say loved that show. To bad the newer season sucked, not enough bees
Hahahaha, cool projects!
This channel became one of my favourite channels almost instantly.
I give you a tip to help your next project COCAIN
Do you have a job orrrr?
Great video as always but I was wondering; how do you know about all of this subject matter? Keep up the great work!
Lol, "That's A Lot Of Bees" reminds me of Rick and Morty ????????

Woo solidworks
NOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE CRT
How do you feel about Ham Diesel being your most watched video? (not sarcasm)

did you know you can generate nbtv signals for the tv using a computer
This video was sponsored by bees
your videos are getting so damn good, im scared your youtube carreer has peaked already
binarySearch(Bee[] sortedBee, String targetBeeName){ int index = 0; int strtLen = sortedBee.length / 2; while (sortedBee[index].year!=target) { index = strtLen; if (sortedBee[index].name.compareTo(targetBeeName)==1) { strtLen = strtLen + strtLen / 2; } else if (sortedBee[index].name.compareTo(targetBeeName)==-1) { strtLen = strtLen - strtLen / 2; } else break; } System.out.println("Bee found at " + index); } It's a binary search bee also Comparable interface hahahahahaha I'm going to fail my cs exam
I somehow always end up watching your videos at work, and therefore always end up getting really weird looks when I chuckle uncontrollably.
cool
HAHAHAHA.. So you have an Inter-dimensional TV too huh? ??
wow thats a lot of bees
Next time use a black piece of cardboard to begin with :)
two weeks later...
Can you Laser cut some fireworks please :^)
just write some code for the arduino to generate the picture or a program for the pc and output it over the headphone jack
There were bees in a microwave at the end of another video now it's in TV , why was it in the microwave?
please post wow thats alot of bees
There is nothing more concerning than William Osman uttering the words: "this should hopefully work"
Did you at least enjoy the episode of "WOW, That's a lot of bees!" first before realizing you had a bee infestation? :3
"Wow, That's Alot of Bees" Sounds like a Rick and Morty show.
you're my favorite tube on youtube
Try to make glasses
Oh man... that's my favorite show. I just binged it on Netflix and chilled. This was a great video and should be shown in classrooms across 'Merica so that school children can understand how early TV's were built and a proper respect for bees! Nice job William, and I just want to let you know I'm never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you....
jep still the best
best intro ever
Actually not that terrible...
Thanks anyway
I live in the U.K. Ffs :(

Aww yesss... William Osman videos
You're quite unlucky when it comes to bees.
You should laser cut a beer pong table!
You promised me bees. I got bees. Thank you.
So far today's been pretty great. I saw a rocket launch with my own eyes, then William Osman brought back the bees joke. ?????? ??
How could you harm those bees will? Don't you know they are dying at an alarming rate?
Full "Wow That's a Lot of Bees!" episodes when?
Digital bees are the worst.
Laser cut some shoes.

I always look forward to your videos. This is really awesome!
I wouldn't mind watching that whole bee documentary, it sounds very informative.
Nice, i love this channel.

FREE THE BEES!
Probably the best bee documentary available on Earth.
Big fan of yours man! Keep up the great work!
Could you try laser cutting pizza into slices?
