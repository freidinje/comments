My GTX 960 at home will slightly outpace my GTX 1050 Ti SSC at the office, which is "VR ready" (according to my benchmark testing). That combined with my measly i7 4790 should actually be able to handle some VR applications, then, shouldn't it? Unless there's something special about the 10 series that allows the lower end cards to run VR...
get PSVR on black friday
”Sponsored by Oculus Rift” aaaaand I’m out
Remake this video after Oculus Quest. Lel
I bet I can make one for only 200#$
Why didn't you try overclocking the gtx 1050ti?
Honestly the most affordable VR systems use your phone. It just makes sense because you are already spending $600-900+ and payments distributed monthly. Not too mention 5G and cloud game streaming services... It’s also the biggest missed opportunity of the Razor phone and all the new “gaming” phones.
easiest way to VR: buy 5 euro vr glasses, download vr games on your phone and game!
I expected Linus to say no and the video end
6:18 meme review
Surprise! The VR-Ready card works in VR. Jesus wept.
I wonder what happen if linus user a Oculus Rift with a gtx 950
dat bad . coll stuf
i want it please
What the hell do you know about being on a budget???
i3 8100, and a 1060? That's the same setup I built for budget VR!!
Its called the oculus quest
Hello! Please Subscribe my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtIbYEDVcl_IlwGQ1oOkv6w/
i have whatever :) 5:00
I am glad you did the video. But I think it will be another 10 years of development till I do VR a waste of time and money at this time
Literally just decided I wanted to save up for a gpu for vr then look at my dashboard and THEY KNEW I WANTED TO BUILD A CHEAP RIG
Here in germany i buildet a 700(euro) vr pc and it runs flawlessly
MORE VR!
Great video Linus! But I would suggest getting one off of eBay for around $150(I'm thinking about getting one but I don't have a gaming PC nor the money).
"on a budget"
1060 6gb or 3gb?
The new oculus update is so shit.
Ps vr?
I have been seeing quite a few gtx 1070’s second hand for bellow £300 now, and from the pictures they arent mega dusty or anything, looking quite good actually so if you could get one of those you would be set
I have a GTX 960 :,(
Linus you explained that things had to be rendered twice, 1 for the left and 1 for the right side. what if you put 2 GPU's in? would it let the GPU's focus on 1 side each? i never paid much attention to the whole VR thing so my knowledge is like nil :p
in your list you said ASUS GTX 1060 but you showed a EVGA GTX 1060 what is it?
Been waiting for this
fx8350 with 16gb of DDR3 or hell, even 8gb of ram instead of 16 with a GTX 1060 3gb will run VR and pretty much any other game all day on high settings on a 500 dollar budget.
sooooooooo expensive maan maybe w8 for next price drop ????????
i vr gamed with an amd a10 5800k processor and a 970 windforce card with 8g of ram
Linus, did oculus also sponsor that toilet paper joke on Sony?
I'm able to play VR with a low I5 and a 960, I play Gorn and the lowest it gets to is 60 fps, a little lag in beatsaber though.
Can u test the vr minimum spec on something like dell optiplex 7010 machine? With i7 3770, 8gb ddr3 and nvdia gtx750 2gb gpu...
How about crysis in vr???
Your Vessel t-shirt lasted longer than the company.
399 USD? Laughs hysterically in European For Finland for exmple it's 449 EUR, which is 512.96 when converted to USD. Edit: fixed typo
Linus: Where's your team spirit Ivan: At Home
Now try this with the Pimax XD
I have a 2nd gen i5 and a 1050Ti , Where do i stand?
Disliking for misleading title, I expected cheap, functional alternatives to the Oculus or Vive
I had to return my oculus because of how bad the tracking was
and there is the oculus go which dose not need a pc and werks prity well in normal home play whith no touers and is arownd $399 usd.
Your obsession with sponsors at every freaking turn is getting nauseating. I'm unsubscribing
VR will really catch on once it has 2-3x the fov, 4-16x the resolution, and probably 2-3x the fps... and like half the price lol
Ryzen 3 2200g with RX 570 is the way to go for cheap VR rig. I would also grab a WMR headset for under $200. I know Linus hates WMR, but I have one amd it works just as good as a rift 95% of the time. I use a 2200g and an RX 580, but a 570 will work great for a bit cheaper.
I kinda wanted to dislike it but i ended up likening it instead cause it was interesting too (beside being a bit depressive considering is sponsored). I mean is like sponsored legit news, but news nonetheless. Obviously i expect all the things Linus said to be 100% real or it it would be a terrible shame. That said: VR is still too expansive. Normal people buys G4560 or stuff like that, not i3. They play on APU or 750Ti or 1050Ti when they live in first world. Come on. I hate VR for lots of other reason but being so damn expansive is like the top of the iceberg for me. And it is such an uninteresting technology for me. Like we had the need for more "screens" in our life. Just put a 360° screen on your head. Yeah, why not. I mean: gaming is ok, it is fun inside some limits but come on guys this is too much.
"rgb nonsense" it has finally been said. who the fuck cares about rgb, if it works i am playing a game - not looking at my distracting computer lighting...
Nice forehead mark.
Hello there...maybe a stupid question, but...is it 1060 3gb, or 1060 6gb? ....just wondering :)
Imagine getting banned on Fortnite with this for exploiting.
If the budget is Bill Gates's net worth, then yes.
Still too expensive.
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xMMTV6 https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZmxbGG 820 is my budget, and i like the small form factor look, just torn between which to get.
Sorry had to dislike this one today. Just don't like the fact Oculus is buying youtubers recently to advertise their stuff.
200 dollars is the real budget.
Your price calculation has only 8GB of RAM, yet the system specs on the page with the 1050Ti and the i3 lists 16GB of RAM (timecode 00:03:48). Since you're recommending a build based on $900 (timecode 00:04:55) does the additional 8GB make a difference?
Or you already pirated windows 10
Paid advertisement :(
building new PC apparently isn’t a budget way, especially need for new series graphic card. Please test with GTX 960 or GTX 860 instead. Current video is totally useless.
Bought my oculus in mint condition for 200 dollars. Upgraded my pc to a 4790k for 180 bucks and a RX Aurous 580 8GB for 160... I would say it’s quite possible
Heard nothing about the oculus quest...
Hey Linus I had QQ why aren’t download speeds accurate like I did the math on my rdr2 download and it should have only taken 15 minutes at 100 mb/s but it took way longer then that do you know why?
i have ryzen 5 1600 and gtx970 and hit #1 score on there for my cpu/gpu
now i know that my pc can run vr couze i have ryzen 7 and radeon red devil 8gb gpu
Linus, could you show your feet more please? even if they are VR feet, I don't mind. Maybe you could do a close up of your feet with some raw bacon on a paper plate next to the toes? thanks :)
I got an HP Windows Mixed Reality headset, it cost $200 and aside from the weird home screen, it's amazing. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are the best deal for PC VR stuff imho.
i3 8100/GTX 1060 SQUAD
"Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" Sponsored by "Oculus Rift"
I just want a VR machine to watch porn and play hentai games in it, lmao. Ok, ok. I'm only kind of kidding about that one. Obviously I'd do other things in it.
I just built a PC for VR and will be buying a rift soon. i5 8600K, GTX 1080, 16 GB of ram, and a 1TB SSD. When I get my Rift I hope it runs well.
Question who buys windows?
The main problem of VR is there are no good games for it yet so why buy it when there is nothing decent to play
Buy one of those old dell optiplex towers with an i5/i7, then buy a mini 1060, and finally buy a cheap WindowsMR headset. VR for less than $600. Thank me later.
*tries to vr on a 8y setup* well frick.
gtx 1060 is not modest
I've only used phone VR headsets before but so far my nose is too big to do it comfortably oof
This is a lie. The RGB gives you so much more performance, without it, you'd only hit 2 fps in minecraft.
Still waiting for IRL SAO
No
In what fantasy land of yours, is $1000 relative to "budget." Dude, you lost me man. Go sit on your thumb. Take your head out of your ass first, though.
Phuck facebook!
Gee linus I'm sure glad you're recommending the Intel i3 8100 over the Ryzen 1600X, you almost saved me from having 6 cores and 12 threads instead of 4 cores and 4 threads! With the same single core compute performance at the same price too! PHEW! that was close
You should have run Echo Arena ! That's a free game that needs a good system.
Howmuch time the spend to empty the toilet paper ?
I get it's sponsored and I'm sure Vive wouldn't allow this, but PSVR is a fantastic VR solution for someone on a budget. Used PS4s are dirt cheap these days (100-200 easy). The VR bundles are getting cheaper and cheaper too. For under $500, you could very easily get a full PSVR setup. I'm not saying it's the BEST VR, but it's certainly the best on a budget.
I have a ryzen 5 1600 and a 1050ti. Will it work?
Last week to back Cybershoes kickstarter For those that didn't know, this treadmill allows you to do everything other treadmills do, but they don't restrict you to not being able to run or make your walking unrealistic with a harness. the seat raises to a standing height of 85cm so it's not exactly seated.

The real question is can it run VRChat
Weird how this video is 2 days old and today the co-founder of Oculus quit as the Oculus 2 was binned by Facebook.. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-by-hp-desktop-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-1tb-hard-drive-brushed-aluminum/5759916.p?skuId=5759916 . Cheaper and better at $669.99 ..
Oculus should concentrate on Rift 2.0. Not that Oculus Go crap. Or both of course...
Sadly, the segway for sponsorships are becoming stupid now XD
Q: Where is your Team-Spirituality A: Home
As a VR developer (check out Oh Captain VR!) I just gotta echo what others are saying: the WMR headsets are great! They're low cost, plus they run 99% of SteamVR games plus Oculus games via ReVive. Additionally, up until recently, I developed on a Dell XPS 15 9560 with a GTX 1050 and everything ran flawlessly! (Now working on a 1060 pc)
Does a gtx 1050 mobile and i5-7300HQ work? Do you need an ssd?
Oculus Go?
When you where hitting 90 fps all you needed to do was get an RGB VR headset and you would instantly get another 15 fps.
allkeyshop has windows retail keys for 17$ works great for me i can even get them reset if i change my hardware to much. used same key for years
Running stock Asus TC-605 (i5 haswell gen) with added PSU, 16G RAM sticks and 1060, works fine with Vive for fallout, skyrim, Beat Saber and other games, room scale. The big con for me is the text in VR, in both Fallout (pip boy) and Elite Dangerous, the text is pretty hard to read.
I use a 1050 ti and an i5 2500k in my VR rig
Cheap...
i would pay to see linus play BeatSaber
why do we fall Linus?
You need to build a phone linus
"if you already have windows... OR WHATEVER" ;-) love you linus
i can play certain VR Games with a core i7 7700hq and a gtx 1050 4gb
Great video. VR is cheaper than ever and there are tons of great experiences. Next time you are trying a heavy load VR game, I recommend Lone Echo!
whenever i watch a vid of yours now just keep thinking apple fanboy
"relatively cheap budget" 900 euros isn't budget for me
Nice ?????? Done im'joined Please subback my canel guys Thank you:)
Can I get 10 likes?? Please btw I love linuses vids
windows 10 on kinguin: $20 1060 sc ebay: $200
Oculus (owned by Facebook) wants to ruin VR gaming with traditional console war tactics, namely exclusivity. Don't support Oculus.
i run my oculus on a EVGA gtx 760 4gb and it runs just fine, normally when others are losing frames im pretty good
I would like to point out that Linus tried it with an AIO cooler. i3s would thermal throttle after around 20 mins of VR gameplay and would cause unbearable stuttering. Just my experience before I upgraded my cpu.
My system has an i5 2320 and a gtx 1050ti and 8gb ddr3 and all the vr games I have tried including Skyrim vr run completely smoothly on medium to high graphics
If you weren't sponsored you would mention WMR. Which also has optimisation because it is integrated into windows
I was on a 4gb 1050ti and upgraded to a 6gb 1060. Most games ran fine on the 1050ti but the 1060 allowed me to bump the graphics up a bit.
the most important to run is all those MMD porns
But a GTX 960 probably won't be good enough, right?
Hey linus, try the gtx 1080ti and rtx 2080ti in sli
My 1060 is currently running on a Q8400... :/
And of course the i3 is basically a i5 7600
There are 777 dislikes....
Long story short, my current setup can technically play VR...
that vr headset is almost half the cost of that pc build. Might as well enjoy "2-d" and beef up the graphics and cpu with that extra $400
Fatshark FPV goggles have 2d/3d modes, HDMI and AV, and headtracker modules plug n play. then could use a cheap microcontroller to convert ppm signal from headtracker to mouse/joystick input for gaming.
"If you already have windows... or whatever" wink wink
What do you think about VR on an Acer Predator Helios 300
i cant
399 without controllers so yea not really 399..
Valve knuckles and locomotion is going to make a lot of people buy VR. That's what I'm waiting for anyway. VR just doesn't feel complete without finger tracking and foot locomotion IMO.
109 flat can equal 90 in VR? I know there had been some optimizations to stereo rendering, but I didn't know it was that good. Is that actually typical of most made-for-VR games? If so then some very impressive graphics should be possible on an svyusl high-end rig.
Why didnt you at least turn on vr with the 1050? Lame
I still can't afford the cheapest build there, and my current pc isn't up to spec, either...
I love the videos, Scribe chanel my like the yous!
linus games on a 980 ???
Here's a VR build that's on par or better in certain aspects but 19% cheaper. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/tPgbGG I believe the build would be better served with 16 GB's of ram and a hybrid storage drive for better-operating speeds. I also don't understand why Intel and Nvidia are necessary for this build unless Oculus specifically told them to use those companies. The GTX 1060 6 Gb is $60 bucks over MSRP, currently, an RX 580 4GB is going for $199 and the RX 570 is a good alternative going for $170. Even if this video is old, then I would opt for a 3GB 1060 instead of a 6GB to keep the price in check. if it were me I'd get a (non-retail) version of Windows 10 ( I'm sure Linus can't advocate for it in this video ) and get a RX 570 and overclock it, bringing a 33% price reduction from the build featured in this video. ( this is the build adjusted https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HrqmRJ )
Warthunder is a free to play game and realy awsome in vr.
I game on VR on a gtx 970 ... :)
i have a pentium
props for the Total annihilation retail PACK GANG GANG
try to do a $399 pc that can run the $399 vr headset
have u tried to oc the ram on the 1050ti??? i get decent performance bump with +700mhz on the ram and no core clock oc'ing , it goes up to 1898mhz on the core clock with ram oc'ing alone(stock cirka 1750mhz)
This technology will be massive and work around mid 2020s
that i3 is a i5 of the old days lol you are mixing things up mate. dont say just i3.. its better then my i5 6400.
>Can you Game in VR on a Budget? no you cant, not untill headsets are below 150 $, having a GPU capable of running games in VR never was the problem, not since polaris and pascal atleast
Says cost is the main issue with VR *Shows lower end PC w/ VR costing $1300 instead of going with PS VR and PS4 (~$500)
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home" BEST PART OF THE VIDEO.
RGB nonsense
Brao ne si normalen
He should be playing The Forest in VR scary and fun
>$399 >budget pick 1
It's only 399 ( ?° ?? ?°)
But can it run Linus Sebastian in vr at 60fps?
Vr will never be for me until they can get a 270 degree fov, cuz I hate being able to see the sides of the box at all times.
You didn't Fus Ro Dah in VR, just for that i made a script to create a youtube account and dislike this vid, 696 dislikes and counting :P
Seems like this would've been quite the opportunity to use some cheaper AMD hardware... like a 2200/2400G... and an RX570 or 580(which is cheaper than full size 1060s in North America)... and had a comparable performer at a, you know, cheaper price... for a VR budget rig... Jus sayin'...
80's 90's 00's - DON'T sit in front of the TV you will burn your eyes. 2018's here lets see if your eyes can catch on fire.
Was this basically an ad for oculus by Linus?
0:40 your reason to give this a thumbs down & not even bother watching. Seriously Linus.... nobody is going to take even YOU seriously if some of the first words out of you mouth is how you're being paid by someone with a stake in the subject matter. Those no need to even finish the video. I already know how it goes... it sucked way back when, then it got better but expensive, it's almost affordable now though, Oculus is cheaper than a Vive... hit the link for a kickback to me. Someone please reply if that's sums up the video. I'm not giving my that 10 minutes of my life.
Lack of AAA games is the issue. I want call of duty and GTA in vr etc. Gamers happily pay thousands on a gaming rig.
Looks like you need to check Linus' thermals since it was like he was overheating under load with this meager config
which 1060? The GDDR5 3GB model or GDDR5 5GB model, or GDDR5 6GB model, or GDDR5x 6GB model?
I7 1050ti ? Will it work
Can get a refurb HP Mixed Reality headset for like $160. Worked great on many games with Ryzen 3 2200 and RX580 until upgraded to Ryzen 7 later on.
5:59 “oh neat, you can interact with the desktop WOAHHHHH THATS TRIPPY”
imagine GTA in VR.........
This test was not accurate. We all know that RGB gives more FPS.
This video made me buy an oculus.
i have a 1060 gpu andi5 cpu do u think i wil be able to play vr?
Hey Linus this is a great video... I'm gonna wait for VR for a few year :) Totally unrelated - I've not seen a video on this - I hope you could point me to the right direction - is with my pc on and it loads all the familiar sounds and lights on my case etc everything g is spinning. But I've nothing on my screens. I use 2 monitors both dvi definitely not their issue as I bought one of them like 3 months ago. Please help I'm tearing my dreads out I can't go on my pc :-( Thanks in advance pls keep up the great work! Love from the UK x
Oh no, Linus has taken dirty FB money.
Nice watch. I wonder what kind it is ?? (Apple Watch)
How abt a Rift 2 CV2.
"Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" .. More like, "Can you play Oculus Rift on a low spec PC."
pff I have a x5460, DDR2 RAM (seriously) and a RX470, still I manage to play VR
Hey guys. In 2020 adobe flash is going to get removed. For those that don't know, adobe flash is what runs stuff like cool math
Nothing budget about the PC, GFX card or the Oculus. Looks like Mainstream (gaming) VR is still a few years away.
No, because I don't want to.
Stereo single pass is not a nvidia only tech linus.
I think my biggest issue about VR is NOT the budget (even though it is pricey) but the fact that you kind of need space to use it. I have about just enough space in my room for a bed, a desk and a chair, and not much more.
I'm confused, I thought the Oculus Rift was it's own console... does it REQUIRE a PC to use?
Well LMG is officially a platform for tech commercials. What happened to the real content about tech with an unbiased opinion from an experienced tech guy? At least 3 videos per week are 10 minute sponsor spots now. At least we still have honest channels like gamer's nexus to give us real reviews.
but how much is the VR gear?
I find the term "GPU manufacturers" kinda funny when you're talking about AMD and Nvidia. They don't actually make their own GPUs. Global Foundries and TSMC actually are the ones making your GPUs.
vr is for porn u nerd
But will it run iRacing?
we run 1060's and I5-6500k for HTC vive's and it works just fine
im gonna steal my grandfathers 20€ tommorow
Your writers are very out of touch with poor people. No one is saying they can’t afford a top-of-the-line gaming system for VR. The freaking headsets themselves are too expensive. Most people don’t have $400 to $500 to drop on frigging headset gear
I would love to hear your opinion on PSVR. I have one and love it. Out of all options it's by far the cheapest.
What do you mean you're not factoring in your RGB nonsense? It's been scientifically* proven that each RGB component results in 2 more FPS.
wait you got a 980 ti but you benchmark nearly every graphic card and CPU.
the virtal boy
I never brought a windows license, i always crack the windows, so it's think that it's original, but it's not and i always get my new update
How about trying the 970 or R9 290 instead of 1050 ti since the 970 and R9 290 is or was the minnimum spec
I hate the way Linus goes full fake scientist in sponsored videos.
my friend used to bring his vive over and his laptop (1050) it wasn’t the best great experience possible but it worked.
Lol flat mode. You mean 2d
THERE IS NO LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION!!
7:51 Linus what's that mark on your forehead... ?
I once tested "The Climb" in the Microsoft Store in San Francisco. As a Person who occasionally climbs in real life it good. It would be better if it wouldn't show you so much where to grab. There's basically always only one place to grab. And it really really misses the foot/leg movement. VR needs foot/leg tracking. It's so important
ya wanna talk budget? I run my oculus on an Oc'd AMD 6300 and a R9390...
FUCK WHY AM I GETTING TIK TOK ADS ON EVERY FUCKING VIDEO I WATCH? FUCK OFF TIK TOK WITH YOUR FUCKING CRINGY ASS SUBHUMAN GAY COMMERCIALS!
No.
400 still come on oculus
Please make video about turning down page file.
At 400 for the headset you've already went far away from the idea of on a budget. For real if 400 dollars for 1 piece of something that needs many pieces is in your budget money is not a concern.
Sponsored by Facebook*
7:51 Watch out for the guy behind,who's enjoying his life. Thumbs up for him.
You get plus 20fps just because the rgb...
I hove broken my pc
I have a GTX 1060 is it good enough?
Naaaa I will go with my LCD
Pffft, you call that budget VR? I think you need a lesson from lowspecgamer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIc3oUByAbk
#flatmode
The whole point of this video is kinda devalued because of the oculus sponsorship. If this was really “VR on a budget”, you would be using a WMR headset. Difference of 200+ dollars.
Great! Now all I need is an affordable VR headset!
My PC was VR Ready when I built it 2 years ago, all brand new parts from scratch. Prior to any upgrades I made since then and not including the cost of Windows. It was ~$650 dollars. So 909 dollars, or 770 without including windows, isn't exactly what I'd call bare minimum.
VR will only truly take off when someone releases an 'essential' game/piece of software for it. A massive, multiplayer dungeon crawler would be a good place to start.
Would it be possible to make a cheap gaming bundle with a 290 budget pounds
That expansive i3 instead of ryzen is confusing
the only actually interesting vr game (for me) out there is vrchat and thats actually not even a "game". WHERE ARE THE GAMES AT??
The answers no
i’m just going home is a great game to play
Anyone else waiting for him to take out his sonic screwdriver, revealing he´s been real life Doctor Who all the time?
It is great that you can build a vr pc for this cheap, BUT it is also possible to buy FULL BUILDS that are VR ready AND come with windows for $800. My brother did this and it is working just fine for him.
Can you wear this for 6-10 hours straight without it starting to hurt? No? Then it's not ready yet. Is the 'screen door effect' gone? No? Still not ready yet.
You guys want to do VR on a budget? I've got two words for you: NO HELMET! Use a screen and some controllers like the Wii! Sure it won't be as immersive, but it will still be VR!
Just buy a PS4 and PSVR it’s cheaper
Idea for a scrapyard wars: have a budget, and make it the requirement that you spend every dollar, exact change. So if your budget is $823, you must spend exactly $823 on the system. This would be challenging, but I feel like it would be easier than the last "no internet" challenge.
That pc is nearly identical to mine specs wise. I thought it was too low spec to run vr games, but maybe I will pick up an oculus after all if I see one at a reasonable price
Psstt.... This videos results don't surprise me in one slightest https://youtu.be/gIc3oUByAbk
That jagged thumbnail shop though
i P h o n e V i d e o
The Pc is not the problem. I got an amazing gaming PC, the problem is that i now dont have enough money for the 400$ headset.
I hope the Rift will be on Sale on Black Friday i definitly want one!
What if your budget is 1Billioon $?
5:10 skip the explanation and test a game.
How comes linus only has a 980 ti?
Scrapyard Wars VR Edition incoming
Ditch Oculus, it's from Facebook
1060 is budget?
Will refuse to buy anything lockulus until they open up their market to all headsets. I have had my Vive for 3 years and its been amazing and it will be Pimax next!
Well LiNus, that's great. How's it run with those NEW nVidia cards?
I am not a violent person but I can't be the only one that thought "he is going to punch Ivan in the head and I am going to laugh".
WHAT ABOUT GAMING LAN CENTER?
Any updates on 1060 gddr5x ??
see, this is videos we want. BUDGEEEET
what about 470,480, 570 or 580 GPUs?
I want more videos with Igor!
When you read sponsored by oculus and you already know the title is clickbait...
measely core i3!? some people have celeron! (like me)
VR is not ready. Unless of course you wanna play games through binoculars. FOV sucks on all VR headsets. You only see directly in front of you. It kills immersion Until they figure out how to use curved screens in VR sets I won't be buying another set.
Can a zotac 1050ti OC edition run game like h3vr smooth?
Minimum build - 1050. Out here running 970 mini ;-;
I got windows for 20 quid haha
I recently bought an i3 8100 with a rx 570 8gb, is that rig capable of vr? Doesn't matter if needs to be played with medium to low settings.
1050 ti and i3 8100? That's my PC. Perhaps VR will be doable somewhat
can my pc run vr? i5 6500, 8gb rx 480 and 8gb ram
You look like Voldemort on thumbnail.
The the topics on LTT lately have been boring af.
signs that the world is ending a GAMING phone that has no headphone jack. cough cough razer cough cough
Why not Ryzen 5 1400, you Principled LTT.
What do u think about upcoming Oculus Quest? seems like its has only 72hz instead of 90. Is it will cause motion sickness?
finally, the video that needed to be made last year. Want even cheaper and just as good vr? Ryzen 3, gtx 1050ti, a used 480 (even better) and 16gb ram and windows mixed reality. Plus they can optimize the os better, in the screenshot they showed they have some crap on that caused overhead - and running the frame analyzer causes issues too.
Spider-Man*
I would rather invest those 399 into better PC overall then be stuck with decent PC and decent VR.
How can you promote anything owned by facebook? Not a good look Linus.
Lowspecgamer video is better

He never mentioned the Nintendo Virtual boy
Well here's the thing, if you had a vr there wasn't any budget to begin with
8:58 You the man, man.
That frame buffer thing souds like good adishion to a gaming monitor
Join the Zucc army..
but RGB makes the system faster
Yes, you can but budget VR isn't much better than PSVR. You need a Vive Pro or higher and a 2080ti or higher if you want modern resolutions in all titles.
Can someone answer this question please: Gtx960 is "no go"? The rest of my pc is good (workstation machine).
Why couldn’t they make it use G-sync or Freesync?
Simple answer: yes. In 2025.
I'd like to know how Oculus classifies "optimizing" because ever since the new update I've noticed lag in games that previously were not laggy. Also, it uses way more cpu, ram, and gpu power than it did before. One of my mates can't even use his vr because of the update they did.
I used my HTC Vive with my i7/980ti rig and my i5/1060 rig and it ran great. I also used it on my i7/970m laptop and it also ran great on it as well.
Make him beat saber
on a budget 900$ smh
Sponsored by Oculus Rift Already two seconds in and I can already tell it's bullshit. this is just a nine minute ad.
Will Oculus work on my pc: Windows 7 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K CPU @ 4.00GHz 16 GB RAM NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 ??
The dude sitting there looks like JackSepticEye
Can i game in vr with a r9 390 sapphire and an intel 4460
I wonder how RX480 or GTX970 would do I have one of each not that I plan on buying vr headset anytime soon but wondering how they would do.
Ayy, so anybody wanna buy me an oculus? x)
666 dislikes! Devil
8:53 But RGB = More FPS
can the vr run with the 1050 ti?
Wierdley enough i have that exact same setup i3 and gtx 10 50 i still dont have a occulus yet bit i think im gonna get it soon
do you think 960m is still good?
I use a Ryzen 3 2200G on 3,9 Ghz and a RX 580 8GB and it works perfect
Step 1: Get Cheap Phone Vr Headset Step 2: Use Phone and Headset as the headset itself Step 2: Use wiimotes as Vr controllers Step 3: Strap notebook laptop to your back
No Beat Saber. Shame. Also is a 970m in a laptop enough, or is that cutting it too close?
where 4k video?
was hoping we'd see things like GTX970's being tested, GPU's originally stated as meeting VR specs.
whats better vive or rift?
how cheap can you go on CPU, Ram and Motherboard? i think a VR machine would be an awesome idea for scrapyard wars!!!
Uh Oculus Quest
If you dont have $$$ saved and rent paid off then everthing is a waste of time.
hey i have a video idea. Take a bunch of old bad nvidia graphics cards like the gt 730's or something, and then 4x sli them and see how strong they are!
I'm sorry. I don't think VR is getting anywhere. let's wait another 20-30 years
The most fun game currently for VR is hands down the DOOM 3 BFG: VR Edition Mod
You had me until you said "RGB nonsense"
BOYS 970 4gbs and a i5 3570k? you think it would work? 8 gigs ram too
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home."
pirate windows and save $129
Watching someone playing or 'doing' VR still looks stupid :-/
7:50 Ivan is greeting us :D
"In my opinion The Climb is rather a tech demo than an actual game". Welcome to anything made by CryTek!
please do collab with lowspecgamer
Linus pirate 6:22
I have been using on two Oculus rigs some ancient server CPUs (Xeon 5550 and Xeon 5540) and they both performed pretty neat with a 6GB 1060. Haven't tried them with the Vive, but my best guess is that they would have performed even better, because of Vive's tracking not being as crappy.
I have an i5 with 1060 GPU, this is really encouraging!
"Looking throw toilet paper tubes" should of used this excuse when i got pink eye from a truck stop baddie.
You should revisit budget VR but check out "Riftcat"
$900 is a cheap for an i3 and a 1060? woah. i got my i7 and 970 pc for $500 pfft current gen...
Is ChannelSuperFun dead forever?
980 ti !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so you didnt even test games with a 1050ti or 1050? just cause some synthetic benchmarks said its not good enough ? if THE CLIMB runs smooth with max settings then you clearly dont need a 1060 even... so a 1050ti or maybe even 1050 is going to work fine... thats what id expect you to test... how is it surprising thst a 1060 is working well for vr ? nvidia and.oculus and vive and game publishers have all recommended a 1060 for vr for 2 years now...
I'm using the rift everyday with iRacing, but since the last update I'm getting stutter on the tracking of the rift. Don't know if it's oculus fault or iRacing's fault, but I'm pissed off AF. AAAAnd, on top of all this BS, Intel delayed the delivery of the 9700K, so I can't get a new PC until february! Linus help us!
i3 8100 + 1050ti???? LINUS! Are you MAGE? I have that system right now! O_O (no joke)
Superman falls sometimes (c) This will stay with me forever.
You can see how hard linus is trying to not mention Vive.
$400 On a headset... No.
0:43 When Google, Oculus and The Verge sponsores a video??
Was 100% sure you were going to talk about Oculus Quest
oh god look at ur red face linus
Can you watch porn with this too ?
Yea but vr head sets are super over priced. For 600 Canadian dollars I can get a second pc instead.
Why is Linus such a sellout?
Can you run on budget? Linus: "Nah... lets bump GPU to GTX1060 and make video about that." Really, really lame...
yeah if you send me all the crap you dont want.
6:18 - who else creeped out thinking that something opened in their own computer?
You guys need to try DCS in VR...it’d be interesting to see how you guys get such a system intensive game to run.
Robo recall is only free if you get the oculus bundle with touch controllers
I ran my acer wmr headset off of a gtx 945 aspire v nitro laptop, could only run a couple of the least demanding vr titles, but hey, still got it to work!
if you keep hitting j on the keyboard at 0:00 it looks like linus is masturbating
If you really want to use VR on a budget machine you should have tested AMD graphics cards. I personally run my VR rig on AMD and "flat" gaming rig on nVidia.
three nainty nainn
I wanna see VR with raytrace
VR is awesome
watch people do this and play doom VR and fallout 4 VR or whatever......hint hint those games are basically rip offs ......because it's the same game with a patch......OOF
I just came here after watching 'upgrade' movie and linus t-shirt freaking me out.
But can I watch porn with it
I would have been interested to see you play a really physics heavy VR game with that setup. I follow Anton, the developer of Hotdogs, Horse Shoes, and Hand Grenades, on Twitter and pretty often see him talking about stuff like this. For example, some manufacturers were putting out premade computers with 1050 Ti cards in them and people would complain to him that his game didn't run well on it. Or now the steady flow of people wanting him to port the game to the cheaper oculus headsets, which simply isn't possible. But it's not the graphics, it's the physics. Even on my i7/980 Ti rig I can make the game choke by making a pile of spent 9mm shell casing when dual wielding mac 11s lol.
8:56 "This peasant seriously called it nonsense"
Or PSVR? That should’ve been mentioned
Any thoughts on the rift 2 headset being cancelled? I was hoping to see what next gen PC VR is going to look like before taking the plunge. HTC are just rehashing their vive without a new upgrade anytime soon.
I rock an fx-8350 and a 1050ti. It’s pretty much fine. The only game that has given me trouble at all is Fallout 4 VR.
A budget graphics card won't let you get max settings in every single game? No really? Who would have thought. Sarcasm aside great to see that a GTX 1060 can still preform well in VR. I am tempted to get a budget VR headset and give it a go if such things exist. How would the GTX 1060 3gb fair though compared to the 6gb variant?
You still need to sign away your soul to facebook though. Fuck the Rift.
Talks about budget VR... Shows nearly $1000 PC and calls it budget... never mind the headset and controllers plus all the other stuff needed...
The shitty-ness of this video. I can almost smell it through the screen...
2:39 - I don't want my face on YouTube ;)
The question is: "Can you Game in VR even if you have the Budget?" I mean is there anything that I ABSOLUTELY need to play right now? A killer app? I don't think so.
PS4 + PS4 Vr Headset ~= 600€
Buy pre-owned galaxy s6/7 and gear vr.
Iam a simple guy , i dont see WMR ( Windows Mixed Reality ) Or Beat Saber And I Hit Dislike
AdoredTV did it WAY WAY WAY better!!!
So the rig i have in my longe is built of left over pc parts it has a i5 2500k and a gtx780 8gb ddr3 and it runs vr in most games fine
What about an i5 with a GTX 1050ti?
IM GON TOUCH YOU inapropetly
Vomit Reality? No thanks! I will never be able to play in VR. Even word VR makes me motion sick. I remember very well how sick OR made me.
This is not news, every single gaming laptop that is considered vr ready has similar hardware.
You got me with the fake ending :))) !!
every frame needs to be rendered twice? and what about the extra screen on the monitor ???? forgot something ;)
For me, VR is for 3 Things , Racing Simulataors of all kinds, VRCHAT , a social VR Game where you can grope big anime titties, and Custom 3d Maid 2 , a 3d Hentai VR supported Game. Me Living in da vr 2d waifu sex simulator, da daa very good putin approves da
There's no hype around VR anymore since FB acquired Oculus, people are not buying headsets unless triple A titles are available, and developers don't develop games because there's no user base. catch 22
Linus stop dabbling in the low end when you have no expertise in it. Leave that to people like lowspecgamer. Or at least consult / collaborate with them.
Linus gaming on a 980ti really? I'm just surprised I mean it's Linus I thought his home pc would have 2080ti in 10 way sli with a 9900k overclocked to 30ghz being cooled by perma frost from fucking Antartica with 10tb of rgb ram but a 980ti look at you Linus slumming it using a normal setup
Wait why does he use a 980 TI specifically?
V r is so expensive in india
well people did pair a i5 with 1060... but that was before they upgraded the i3 to basically be an i5... Not sure why you are surprised by this.
I think the next scrap yard wars needs to be a VR gaming rig challenge...
"Vr on a budget? Awesome, can't wait to know more about cheap alternative to vr headset." video sponsored by occulus ah..... Guess I'll come back later when the sponsor allow him to talk about something else then the Facebook thing...
should have used a 2400g for the amd side
I've got a Samsung Gear vr A bunch of ps3 cameras Razer hydra Works great on my GTX 1060 FX 8300 8GB DDR 3
Hey, heres the millionth comment about windows mixed reality. By the way you should try WMR again
399? No thanks, I'd rather buy a chair ( ?° ?? ?°)
Can my gt210 run VR? With Intel pentium
Switching to a R3 2200G, Appropriate mobo, and an RX 580 (which you can find for about 240 vs the 310 of the 1060) and you would get performance along the same lines. Although with the price difference, unless you really are just trying to get in the door, I would recommend a R5 2600 with the money you saved from the gpu.
PS4 you can have for much less!
https://youtu.be/S4TBPL7-iRk The real lowspec VR feel.
We'd love to see you give Gorn a try! VR Gladiator Game that's still in early access: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1896033800492877/
I personally think VR is going the same way 3D TV’s and movies did..... It was a novelty at first but never really took off with the masses
I game in VR with a 970
Would the upcomming gtx 1060 "2" make up for a nearly perfekt experience tho?
I hate it when the sponsor of a video is directly linked to the content. How are we supposed to know where the ad ends and where the video starts. Occulus aren't the only VR company so this video is more "Minimum config for the occulus rift". Don't get me wrong, I am not commenting on the quality of the content or quality of the video, just the poor separation between ad and 'real' content. Have a nice day, Mathieu.
or just save 200 pound with a phone vridge/kinovr ps move +ps move service ps move camera and a phone with a phone vr headset then there you have a fully working vr experience or atleast somewhat working
$900 + $400 = $1300 And that's bare minimum specs too. VR simply put isn't going to become the method of gaming for the every man anytime soon.
This is an ad.
Lowspecgamer
Expect more Uganda red Knuckles to appear, now that it is affordable to more people.
Linus' home PC doesn't have the most high end vid card? Le gasp!
One day i'll upgrade, but right now I'm happy with my i7 3770K and GTX 970 for VR
i9 and 2080 ti vr?
VR is kinda dead at this point
Some Indi games won't even run on 1060 , are you really play Linus?
Cool, so I can hook up a $500 headset to a $500 PC and it’ll work.
sure, but what about the headset price?
Future video topic?? Maybe? https://github.com/stec-inc/EnhanceIO
Depends what you're playing. I made my mother a R5 1500 and gtx 1050 system and plugged in my oculus just to check. It ran most things fine. All the 'experiences', well-optimised games too. More demanding stuff... no, but then some games are just poorly optimised. I run it on my R7 1700/ 1080ti and some games (City Car Driving, I'm looking at you) are just stuttery as ** because they rely on CPU to render.
30fps i dont feel anything
Linus, I've been watching your videos for about 6 years and I have to say the content is superb. From the sketches, the jokes (good and so awful that they're good), the quality of your videos, the wit, the depth of knowledge, the social justice tech warrior objectiveness. You're brilliant. Genuinely considering moving to Canada one day haha
Totally out of context but what if a r7 2700x could oc to 5.0 ghz, how would it compare to intel hmm...
I use an fx8350 and 780 and rarely have issues with it?????
a 1050ti is budget now? people have been duped in to thinking £180 is cheap, it's not. It's low quality, compared to current tech but it's not cheap nor budget.
Can't you vr on the PlayStation or whatever?
vr8teen.net + allvrporn.com ???????????????? Virtual reality porn!
????? :3
love videos like these, awesome job guys
Can a ryzen 3 1200 at stock speeds, 3000 MHz 8gb ram and a RX 570 from Asus with 4 GB of vram give any playable results ? (I plan to build this system and now that vr is cheaper it would be nice to have that feature)
Who the heck would buy a vr with pennies
Ur sick.
Linus - measly little i 3 8 gen ME - cries inside
Oculus Quest is coming on 2019 where you won't need a PC anymore!
FINALLY i have been wondering if i could run VR for ages! Thanks!
R9 380 + i5 6400 is enough for vr, which is like a 1050 ti. I think linus should've tried the 1050ti
VRis bullshit
Come-on Linus! let's go 19:9
My recommendation is ram. Get 16gb of ram MINIMUM Especially with the rift. The rift home app uses like 2gb by default. And buy H3VR.
I really liked your “reasons to buy an iPhone” video, because even though those factors were outweighed in your use case, I found it helpful to have a lot of information that didn’t strictly apply to your needs. I think you should do a second video on present day VR featuring Vive and WMR and discuss what they bring to the table, even if they aren’t better options than Oculus in your opinion.
I always wondered why Linus keeps touching his phone in his pocket but is he advancing the script cue or something because he is doing it very regularly I've noticed
I built my rig as a vr machine, then found out I didn't like vr! Just couldn't get over the fact I had a 'thing' on my head! + I missed the crisp clarity of a 4k panel, vr is just so blurry most of the time, I once heard someone describe it as "its just like being there, only you've forgotten your glasses!"
i5 is overspec for a 1060.
Would've preferred an older PC like something like a 2500k 4GHz, 2x4GB of 1600MHz DDR3, and a GTX 780 or a R9 290
Am I the only person who finds the screen door effect a total immersion killer? Anyone have any tips on possible ways to minimise it? Hardware isn't an issue, my laptop has a 7700hq and gtx1070..
Guys I’m on a 1050Ti and i5 3470. Am I set or no?
I want the VR headset that was not more than $150. That what should be affordable for most people because later it will be has TAX and other thing make it higher prices.
909.93 not include the VR headset it self -_-
thanks for all the none benchmark you did on your hrc vive, vive pro , windows mixed reality headset and oculus with a RTX 2080TI ! pathetic influencer ( and you are doing this because it is sponsored by oculus...)
so if you already have windows or...whatever ??
Will you be testing the new oculus quest at some point?
0:42 lul the verge
VR is dead and so 2016
9:25
The advertising ends in the 9:31
How much ram do we need?
Holy shit Linus is getting old so quickly, check out those wrinkles on his forhead starting at 08:37 until the very end of the video ??
$900 for just the computer is considered budget?
or get a gear VR ( mine came free with my s7 )
So how does that rig handle non-VR gaming?
Ok, but what about second hand graphics card on ebay or craigslist. There must be cheaper cards out there that can be just as good as the 1060???
399.00 X 2 is headset and pewdiepie chair
I tried oculus on my 4790k/1080ti about a year ago and it was nauseating. I'll wait for an "Oculus 2" or something to try again
One question - who cares?
Why don't you go with i5 4590? It's only a little slower than i3 8100 but much cheaper, motherboard and ram would be cheaper too for the same performance
Linus, you said you game at home on a 980 Ti? WHY? Why not a 1080 Ti??
My Oculus has been EXTREMELY unstable recently. Half an hour of playing and i get complete USB failures up to my xbox gamepad glitching out. Support says basically that i have to check my everything and reinstall their software about 7 more times. How can you have John Carmack working with you and have such awful software at the same time?!
I run a i5 6600k with a gtx 1060 3gb mini 16 gb ram, IT runs ok...
so, an i7 6700+GTX970 would be a good experience?
My Problem with Oculus Rift are my glasses. I just can't use it. Although i have one
for a info guru you sure seam ... uninformed. vr is NOT io people want, its not matter of price. while its new and interesting exhaustion doesnt play so big role, but with time you use it less and less till you stop altogether. its a gimmick you loose interest in very fast. it rose and died, this time it should die for good
did you guys deepen linus’ voice in post? ????
you could try honey select vr ...
Anyone have any idea how a 970 would go?
Hey Mr Linus I need help my PC is as following h61m-s2pt PCIE V2 X16 board 2*2GB ddr3 ram and 500 gb HDD what GPU could I install to resurrect ?? my PC, I did a reserch and found that amd rx pro wx 4150 just has (.44) Bottel neck, ahh and ci 3 2100 processor please your help will make a nuclear (BIG) chang to my gaming exp and Thanks aloot Linus .????
1060 3GB DDR5 / 1060 6GB DDR5 / 1060 6GB DDR5X?
That system is pretty pricey for a budget... I don't know if I can call it a budget. (Although Walmart had a i5 8g ram 1tb and a 1060 GTX for $499 last year for black Friday) only issue was it had windows 10 installed on it.
Id actually want a VR headset for racing games, but I feel like theyre still developing so fast Id always buy a version thats outdated soon
DO A REVIEW ON OCLULUS QUEST
try a gtx 660
alright let me just go out there and shell out 400 bucks to play VRChat at 10fps
i was looking forward to this video... but damn that was disappointing, considering i ran 1440p vr headset on a r9 280x(almost half of a 1060) with no overclock. this video was really just useless, sorry Linus but its the truth.
Give us you thoughts on the Oculus Quest, please!
how is $400 dollars budget? https://www.newegg.com/global/uk-en/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAD6H6JW4292&cm_re=hp_mixed_reality-9SIAD6H6JW4292-Product this is about 300 and i play it on my 1050ti 16gbs of ram and an i7 3770
why didn't you try a real game with that setup?
Well that's not good. Their exchange rates are a bit off. Still £399. Even tho it's $399 ....
“Gamers in particular” Gamers truly are the most oppressed group.
honestly, each day I feel more regret of buying oculus rift.yea, I was hyped back then, and till now there are just a handful of games that worth playing. and the 480p-ish graphic is just not banging. I bought a gtx 1080 for it, for playing racing simulate type game, that card is just not enough. I can afford a 1080ti but I just dont want to spend that on a few games. like the rest of the vr game can run pretty smooth on a 1070 or 1060 I believe. Car Project 1 and 2 are friggin fantastic but the graphic gets extremely downgraded in VR. but it just feel real in VR and I got car sick pretty much everytime.
anyone know what sort of results you would get with a 6600k and a 1070ti
Hi Linus, Do you know if it exists an extension cable for the Rift with HDMI and USB female to a USB C thunderbolt 3 ? (And do you think it will Worth it?) Thank you a lot for your videos. I love VR !!
we have our phone already, just use that as display to cut down cost (probably majority of it). plus cloud server.
VR is still stupid
Linus... iron your shirt!!!
Go on vrchat and get laid in vr
Or you can buy Windows on eBay for 5$.
Know if you want to budget VR you need a 1050ti and a goddamn Windows mixed reality headset that's a cheap budget rig and it works great
Fun fact: Oculus co-founder left the team just recently after Facebook canceled the Rift 2. Good job, Facebook
Get an office PC with a decent cpu, put a GTX 1050 ti low profile gpu in, stream to Oculus go over fast wifi and your all set. Simples!
Vr sponsored by oculous yeeeeah right. I'm clicking off this commercial.
I have an i7-2700k paired with a gtx 1080ti... should i bite the bullet and see if i can VR?
can u guys do giveaway GPU’s... i really need one ????????
Low spec gamer did this way better. Don’t do a sponsored video because Oculus won’t let you run a budget system.
Cool. You've convinced me that I'll not be buying a VR rig in the near future. Thanks, Linus.
Soooo... my i7 and 1050ti, laptop. Could play vr?
I do always like your videos and always think your job is awesome... But I'm starting to think that your sponsors are in fact always Intel and Nvidia. Why can't you actually make a budget VR test with AMD? I mean, some of us want to see how good they work with liquid VR and a "less gaming" CPU.
how about running flat games in 3D using a vr headset?
I like how Ivan was looking at Linus "Damn Linus you look fly today"
‘Budget’
Play almost 2 years on 780gtx + i5 3570 now on 1070ti +i7 3770 All is good !!
I VR using I7 970 and AMD 480..... it's fine.
Honestly, if you were to buy the same (or extremely similar build) used, you could probably get away with approximately 500$CAD. You can find older i5 or i7 (4th gen) for really cheap and a used GTX 1060 3GB - 6GB can be found from 200$ to 300$CAD used.
How would anyone looking at this think a i5 6600 with a 1050ti handle vr
I like that splash screen color.
Im so mad, that i3 8100 is faster than my i5 4460
Off-topic : Linus knows style xD https://www.gq.com/story/socks-with-sandals-is-cool-now?mbid=nl_102418_daily&CNDID=31203936&utm_source=nl&utm_medium=email&utm_brand=gq&utm_mailing=gqm_details_news_newdb_ACTIVE_20181024%20(1)%20remainder&bxid=MTMzMTc2OTM2Nzk0S0&MD5=ba1c7c7dc07aa7c41e3026123265d1d5&SHA1=0a4b848febf323015c51df07ccc6cd51e7ef6411&spMailingID=14495537&spUserID=MTMzMTc2OTM2Nzk0S0&spJobID=1501907616&spReportId=MTUwMTkwNzYxNgS2 #linusstyletips
5:05 or whatever.. lmao.Also getting rid of the stock, Oculus?
You should have tried a few games on the 1050 ti before moving up. It would have been interesting to see if you found it playable.
#SPONSERED
Cool !
Linus will you bless me with a gpu please :^)?
If a GTX1060 can run VR The Climb, then why can't my RX480 8GB?
VR is dead, just like 3D, and soon HDR will go too..
For VR to truly work the VR manufacturers NEED to support their hardware with (awesome) GAMES. In this way, they will sell more hardware and so draw more outside developers into the VR fold... Better graphics would be nice too...and headsets...
"Budget" $399 JUST for the headset. Great commercial.
The answer to the title is "It depends on the budget stupid"
I've got a 970 and VR works pretty well for me most the time, some games work great with the settings maxed, others I have to lower the graphics options way down. Oddly Skyrim VR even works great after a little tweaking. I know it's not a PC device, but as far as VR on a budget goes, I'm surprised you didn't mention the Oculus Quest, considering this is a sponsored video. lol I can't wait for Quest, even tho I already have a Rift.
Linus is wrong! You need the RGB to run VR properly as it boosts performance by %50
Would my 1060 6GB and a Ryzen 5 1600 and 8GB RAM Run VR?
Who would by Windows at Microsoft? Getting it on gray market sites is so much cheaper. Even if they can kill your license, it was just 5 bucks so who cares
$399??? Any wise consumer would spend that on a Pewdiepie chair instead…
me like R.N. lel
8100 is more than enough for the 1060. Right?
This is what high end user might think which is budget, in reality its not really that budget oriented for some people as it is still a lot, there are other alternative which employ cheaper yet kind of quirky method to get vr running.
couldnt you have just said 2D..... not 'flat mode'.... lol
only $900 USD! AND THEN ANOTHER $400 FOR THE HEADSET!! DID SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A BUDGET?????
whats linus personal vr spec rig
Probably would have spent way less if he used a CPU that used DDR3. Also, buy used. My VR rig uses an i7 3770 and an RX 580. The CPU, motherboard, and RAM came from an old office computer I got for free. I bought the graphics card used on Ebay. Add in the PSU and USB 3.0 card I bought, and my system was about $300.
omg i think the verge broke all oculus rifts 0:42
GTX 970 and an FX 8350, with a windows MR headset. You can build the PC and get the headset for around 500 bucks, and it performs very well.
They had to wait to make this video until two full rolls of toilet paper had been used up.
Correct me if I’m wrong but wouldn’t it be rendered 3 times? Two on the headset and one on the screen?
Can you do Fallout 4 on PC in VR?
How about RX 580?
But can it run Digital Combat Simulator in VR?
Sorry, but a 10 series card isn't even close to low-end.
I have a pc with parts just like that with some exeptions but still its happy to hear it can run vr. 1x8gb DDR4 GTX 1060 6gb Windows 10 64bit And ryzen 5
I thought the rift was like 1k so I've never even thought about buying it, for 399 I might actually consider it considering I already have a top of the line pc
What's the point of this video?! This PC meets recommended specs for VR! If you want budget VR than try WMR with GTX 1050 (Ti). That would be interesting.
why is linus only using a 980ti at home? surely he could use a 1080ti from his office stores?
A 1050Ti is not low end, I do VR on a 970.
I have an i3 and 1060 in my current rig so that's good to know!
I just got my wireless adapter for my vive... SOO SIC! linus, get luke to do a vive minimalist vid
Im a VR developer and wrote a thesis and developed some tech to make VR games run on lower hardware. A lot can be done in the engine to make it more efficent. Im now making for the oculus go as part of their oculus start developer support, its INSANE. The go is my favourite headset then rift then vive. Vive is so clunky compared to rift, and controller on rift is superior imo. Coming from an unbaised developer.
I am surprised that it worked with Core i3. Normally we'd be discouraged from using anything lower than a Core i5. But here's the catch with this video - The fact that there are "low quality" and "maximum quality" settings on VR games and software, as well as the smoothing tech in current graphics cards, allow there to be a much more vast variety of possibilities with the configuration, with a possibility for a PC that's a lot cheaper than recommended specs - and even your test bench. 1060 is a good GPU for Oculus Rift, but that's only if you want recommended framerates and you've got the budget for that. You just talked about how Nvidia allows to "smooth-out" bad framerates in VR, or the tech that makes rendering faster by not rendering extra polygons/pixels on both sides, yet you've have never mentioned that in your tests... A real barebones stystem for VR would have a 770 or a 750Ti or something like that - as long as you don't use it for too long. There is obviously a chance of eye strain because of the low framerate, but at least it's better than a cheap ol' Google Cardboard viewer, or even an Oculus Go headset which, while it has it's own built-in OS, still doesn't have all the features that the Rift has.
Talking about budget VR gaming and not even mentioning Oculus Go.
But can it run Crysis?
Well im gonna test then if my setup is vr capable, good luck with a 1060 and an fx 6100
The only thing i want is VR Chat
Now you can play all of the mediocre crappy one-day VR games instead of AAA titles.
Forget this garbage. PS4 Pro and a Headset, camera 120 fps ,
its funny one of my buddys has a rift and he only uses a 1050ti and from what i'v seen while using it,the 1050ti seems to be able to push vr quite well(from the games i played anyways mainly job sim and hotdogs horse-shoes and hand-grenades the gun sim) though um pretty sure it's only running at 60fps and not 90 but,it didnt feel choppy and it didnt give me motion sickness
Duuude this is my pc... Core i3 8100 Gtx 1050ti 16gb Ram Wow this feels like watching a review for it
Vive is better than Oculus
In my head during the opening pitch: “Please be my hardware, this is LTT so ‘affordable’ is going to be a 1070 and an i7 8800k” 2:35 “Fucking hallelujah” 3:00 and on: “Ok I have to stick to watching the whole video before celebrating”
Make a video comparing this to PSVR.
This might have changed since the video was shot and edited, but right now can actually be significantly cheaper. I just recently picked up an RX 570 for $160 which is a far more powerful gpu than a 1050 ti while being half the price of a 1060 6g and still under the 500w power limit (though I found 600w EVGA PSUs to be around the same price anyway). If you take windows 10 out and cheap out a bit on the motherboard and ram, you can get that price down to under $600 for a VR ready machine (not including shipping or the cost to build).
My question is could I use a gtx 970 for VR with i5
1:44 huh i wonder if this could be a use for sli / crossfire .. one gpu reandering fore each eye
Ryzen 5 1600x, 1050ti, 16gb of ram, I play and stream VR consitently(mostly pavlov or VRChat and both cpu and gpu are overclocked as far as they can go) but works amazingly. I have windows MR and a Oculus(mostly use the windowsMR mostly because setup and tear down is a lot simpler)
The only way that the HTC is still better is the controllers
so in theory i should be fine with my I5 4690k and my 970 with 16g ram.
PSVR is another budget vr
Here I am playing csgo at 25 fps :(
0:50 linus gets help from the verge. can we just appreciate this.
8:34 linus is playing and in back he is working what a nice boss linus is
I Guess my AMD Phenom II X6 1055T and my Nvidia Geforce 750 Ti, cant run Minecraft VR...
linus has raccoon eyes
Ew sponsored by zuck
I play vr with a i3-8350k and a 1050ti and it runs great
This is probably the worst attempt at VR on a budget. Hell, the worst attempt of anything LTT "on a budget" since you guys go far and above what the minimum specs for VR actually are. FYI, Raw Data and FO4VR are the "Crysis of VR" What a massive waste of time this video is for both the audience and LTT
But will it run Fallout 4 VR?
Wouldn't the cheapest VR rig be a PlayStation with PSVR?
8:48 Ivan when Linus says RGB nonsense.??
Oculus is a pretty great deal
Would a i3 3.6ghz 4th gen and a evga 1050 ti sc work?
I’m VR gaming with an AMD Fx 6300 (OC’d to 4.0), and a GTX 1060. It’s pretty smooth on everything I’ve thrown at it so far.
i thought this is a tips to play VR with android phone + google cardboard
i3-8100 is my favorite chip. I love it, and I put it in my personal PC.
Hey Linus i have a windows 7 laptop and its poop cant run anything without blue screen so i bought a bunch of supplies to build a pc can u help me understand how to put it together it would mean a lot
no way my system can handle this specially with my vid card radeon hd6570
Linus shilling for money again. How come you don't even mention WMR? Oh yeah, sponsored by Oculus..what a joke. Edit: Also LowSpecGamer did a much better job
And... Where's the "budget" part of the video?
Do people really buy those windows keys. All I had to do is use command prompt to activate my windows. It was simple and just search it on YouTube for it. 140 bucks is too much lol
this or vive though?
I actually had no idea that VR had been optimized so well in the last year
"So if you already have windows or ... whatever." I have whatever ;)
why are all the recent videos not in 4k wtf
What happened with the 4k videos ?
obligatory "technically a million dollars can be a budget".
Sony PS4 VR console job done
What case is that ?
That climb thing is really upsetting, having dismembered hands! So the developer could not figure out how to model hands that are actually connected to your body??!!
Okay. So yes the GPU is a big part for single-player games. But for any multiplayer game the CPU is the most important part for VR. Reason being. Your CPU has to know every players movement. I kinda can't believe. You, LINUS! Did not mention this. An if you don't believe me. Lets see you play VRChat with the CPU you used for that rig. Once you enter a world with 20+players and stand in front of mirror, have fun with 11FPS. LMFAO
LTT is not the channel for "budget" stuff. since their term of budget stuff is out of touch.
One of the Windows Mixed Reality Headsets has been on sale for $150 for the HMD and controllers. It's a killer deal. Also, I've been using my Vive with my HTPC, which has an i7 2600 and 1050ti. That's an old CPU and lower end GPU. If you're upgrading the GPU of an older machine and getting the $150 HMD, you can be into VR for ~$300. That's so cheap compared to even a couple years ago.
I would almost bet the sim community buys more VR headsets than anyone. It would be cool to see how a lower spec PC handles sims.
Linus budget gaming vr set is 10k Canadian Dollars.
For the common viewer of THIS channel, I can see that VR is something they might go for. But I look at it from an overall market perspective, and even though those of us who know the details behind it understand that it might as well be a near-to separate system the "average consumer" sees it as a peripheral. To me until basically an Occulus Rift (not a GO, a straight up full featured Rift) or similar product sells for sub $200 it will not be a market changer. It is, from the eyes of the "average consumer" (not the enthusiast, or anything like that, I'm thinking like kid who got a console from mom and dad and mom and dad might pay for it) it is a peripheral and should be priced as such. Which is sub $200. Full featured VR at sub $200 is required for it to truly take off in the market. But that's my opinion.
I wish I had as much money as you Linus. I'd love to have a setup worth sharing.
“Superman falls sometimes”
I just wanna say that you brought 2 toilet paper rolls to make a bad joke
I’ll wait 5 years for VR to be at ready player one level.
No Crysis VR?
Owns one of the most famous, if not THE most famous tech review companies... VR games on a 980ti. I know it still does a great job, but still haha
You can play vr game below $10 but you need a smartphone which have gyroscope.
Could you guys try out an oculus rift on an Predator Helios 300?
The thing is, the GTX 1060 is roughly in line with the GTX 970, which was the Rift and Vive's original minimum spec. Not sure what the point of the video is. "Using a PC that is in line with the PC they say you need works" I guess.
Now that tech is good the y need good games for vr real games
How to get VR for free: go outside
Personally, I wouldn't say the money was the problem. The problem was the shit quality (pixelated) when you put it on. For me, it made games unplayable. I don't know how people said you don't notice em when they're all over. the screen in front of you..
I dont really think VR has rolled over yet. I remember 90's VR when I was a kid. 5 year old me in the 90's knew it was not realistic at all. I remember thinking to myself it was an awesome idea though and couldnt wait till they got it to look more realistic. That time has come. VR is badass now. As a person who grew up on Nes, Snes, Sega, PS, N64... etc. I knew VR was the next step even when I was a kid. I just knew Id have to wait until tech was good enough to make it a reality. The thing is VR is not affordable yet like a ps4 or Xbox One X. Gpu's are powerful enough but the prices are still a bit to much for normal gamers to just buy it like a console or laptop. I think Vr is getting advanced enough at this point where it will be mainstreem in the next 5 years. Headset makers are making affordable sets now and soon gpu tech will be powerful enough to run VR at an affordable price. While the high end cards will be able to power much crazier things like AI.
Is that what you call budget?
i just want to play vr chat and vr waifu games
I thought you were going to discuss Irebe (Oculus founder) leaving the company and Facebook shifting the focus towards self-powered headsets like the Oculus Go
Thats more money than i have
GTX 1060 3GB or 1060 6GB?? I have 3GB will it work?
Thank god the like/dislike ratio is back to normal
lol "flat mode"
This aint budget bro. Oculus DK2, 100 quid. Pc i got for my 13th birthday, 400 quid. Plays warthunder just fine brilliant experience and vr chat. Haven't done much else with it yet because i don't have controllers
the 1050ti would have done just fine if you actually tried, because spoiler alert, benchmarks as usual are bullshit, really the only games that don't run as well as you'd want are badly optimised games like fallout 4 vr source: i play VR games on the htc vive with a gtx 1050ti (the EVGA SC edition) and an amd fx-4300, and again, other then in games like fallout 4 vr which is badly optimised, i get a solid 90fps no issue, and the games run great
Okay, now we can run VR. But what for? VR chat?
But can you run with an 8350? ??
O N L Y $ 3 9 9 . 9 9
Oculus rift in my country costs 600 US dollars
Does Facebook still own the Oculus Rift?
That's a 1060, not a 1050TI.
I hear appt hear tech YouTubers saying things like ohh I only have a 1070 ti and I'm like your Linus tech tips shouldn't you have like 2 2080 ti's and an i9 9900k
ka-ching!
Huh, funny that John Carmack described the Sony Glass-tron as looking through cardboard. He probably didn't realise he'd be working for Oculus 15 years later. Nice Wolf3D and Doom posters on the window/wall
I would love to try Elite:Dangerous in VR. I already played nearly 500 hours on basic monitor but I can't afford any headset yet. Maybe some day in the future.
Linus's S's are painful... Why didn't you EQ them out? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I know when I think about cooling an i3 8100 I decide on a 240mm AIO.
PSVR (use it on PS4 & PC). Anyway, VR needs to go full wireless in order to grow the market to next level.
I’ll pay more for the htc headsets before I give mark f***erberg my money
Hi Ivan! My name is Ivan.??
lol linus the climb isnt the crisis of vr if anything deserves that title its robo recall since for max graphics you need a 1080ti or better
I think I missed it but was it a 3g or 6g 1060? I was trying to figure out if a 1060 6g laptop could do VR or if I absolutely have to have a 1070 in it
yes you can but this video isnt how you can pick up a windows mixed reality headset for 200 Canadian dollars and then any gpu around the gtx 1060
So VR still isn't affordable, in a giant surprise to noone.
Hi
I heard that my HD 7950 vapor-x oc edition with 3gb is better then the 1050ti with 4gb. So it is possible to run VR on this card?
Doesn't the i3 have 4 cores now with HT and the i5 does not have HT? Or did that change already for those models? If not, did it play any part on it? I think having the HT would be much better.
could you figure similar results with a vive?
I run a 770gtx. Help.
Still it's best to get good hardware that can run the games in VR as smooth as possible. I replaced my i7 2600 with a GTX 970 for a i7 7700k with a GTX 1080ti just because some games still would have some troubles in VR. One of them was Sunshine Arizona wich caused some flickering or framedrops when there where many zombies and it would make it harder to keep my balance while playing. I personally like to play mostly VR FPS games that support locomotion movement on both my Oculus and PSVR and smooth frame rates are a must in that case. And because of that experience I don't suffer at all from motion sickness anymore after upgrading on the PC, because I noticed that I didn't had any troubles playing with my PSVR on for several hours on the PS4 Pro and never had any motion sickness at all from the start. The only thing that could unbalance me now or making my virtual hands do stuff that is humanly impossible is if someone walks between me and one of my sensors, or if there is something in the background that interferes as simple as a light source in case of the PSVR. If you are wondering if VR could be something for you, then try it if possible before you invest at all. Sometimes I take one of my VR sets with me to a lanparty and for some reason people don't even dare to try it thinking that it's nothing more compared to 3D movies they watched in the cinema's. I got one guy to try (after telling me VR is not for him and never tried it before) and play Farpoint on the PSVR with the Aim controller and he was amazed and after that it was his best gaming experience ever. But in some cases I had some people try a game and they where like 'Nope'. But you will never know if you don't try, and you won't even come close to the experience when watching people play VR games on youtube, because you have to experience VR by yourself.
I seriously thought this was an Oculus Go update video....
No point in getting the Rift since Facebook doesn't care about the pc market and has canned future versions of the pc rift, as per Iribe.
I have a gaming laptop with a 1050ti and I really want to get an oculus rift
So, with a 1060 AMP edition and a i5 8400 would I be able to run most VR games smoothly? Cool, now I just need a Oculus
come on linus weres the code to buy and get a discount :)
Not factoring rgb? If you're not factoring rgb then how is the pc even "gaming"? You suck. Disliked
Man I was hoping for some 1050ti performance
you bought 8k camera, but the video is not even 4k :(
but can a GT 1030 play VR yes I know it kinda does in a janky way also I dont recommend the DDR4 variant but if you are too poor to be forced to buy the DDR4 I suggest get to look for 7XX class cards
What are the games?
VR is like communism. It looks good in paper but is useless in real life.
lowspecgamer is typing...
VR has always been goofy to me. It also seems like a gold rush than the way of the future. I think what customers really want is augmented reality which has promise
This just goes to show that the 8th gen i3 CPUs are far better gaming chips than they are given credit for. A friend's wife asked me to build a PC for him as a gift and he was somewhat worried when he found out that it only had an i3. He's been pleasantly surprised by the performance. Considering this was an upgrade from a 3rd gen i5, he's doing better!
I was really hoping I could run the rift on my crappy hp laptop with a 930m and and i7 5500u and 8gb of ram, my hopes are probably too high.
No!

could you try making a vr setup with your phone and for the controllers use something like PlayStation move
Did you happen to get to the Oculus Quest reveal? What is your opinion on it?
VR is like 3D,it`s a gimmick and nobody really wants it
"If you already have windows or whatever"
While I normally don't care if content is sponsored, this video is basically a summary of Oculus' specs page: https://support.oculus.com/170128916778795/ I would hope a company's own minimum and recommend specs would provide reasonable performance.
Now I want to see a craigslist VR build. LOL
can I use gtx 770 sli VR ?
vive also dropped price like 200 bucks. and added motion smoothing which helps a lot and you can also get wireless now btw.
Yes. Yes you can. Just check out LowSpecGamer and his video on budget VR that he did months ago.
$399 isn't cheap enough when 90% of people on Steam use dual or quad core cpus and GPU's that are less than $200.
I plan on getting VR next year. Hope my overclocked GTX 970 will be enough.
"Bare minimum system"=GTX1050. I wouldn't call that a bare minimum. Try a much lower end gaming computer.
What about AMD cards? :(
how about amd side i wonder for ppl who have a amd card what is the minimum card that should be used and the minimum recomended to play all games
Thanks for doing this, I already have a PC with a 1060 in it. I want to upgrade to a 1070, put the 1060 in another computer I have, give that to my brother for Christmas/ birthday (he turns 13), and get a VR headset for my Christmas/birthday (mines a month later but hey, VR is pretty expensive)
I accidentally just sycned supernova to the intro music. :) The more you know.
The funny thing is that I am going to build the exact same pc
Linus games on a 980Ti himself? You'd expect better with bins of Titan Vs lying around
Real price is $1300. Forgot to include the $400 headset cost.
MOAR VR plz
Wait Linus plays VR on a 980?!! UNFORGIVABLE!!
Hi!, back(To Ivan) 7:51
Too bad the Rift 2 was cancelled. RIP OCULUS
Pxrnhub released a lot of their videos in VR mode.
I would have liked to see you play test the i3 and 1050 instead of trusting synthetics
Would be awesome for playing race sims
damn, I just bought a 1050ti, sad to hear it's not good enough, but not surprised at the same time. I'd like to get an oculus down the road to play rock band VR.
I mean I've got a 600$ PC with a 980 and an i5-3330 and I can run all VR games with my HP Mixed Reality headset, and I would consider that 600$ PC to be pretty budget.
4:13 got one of those 8100s for the family PC and its actually quite beefy
Are thand controllers you are using for Robo Recall part of the Oculus Rift setup, or some third party input device?
VR is still a thing?
90fps is overrated 30 is buttery "smooth"
Does it feel more natural than it looks? I'm hoping it's better than the impression I get from watching other people's VR action... which do tend to induce motion sickess for me :-/
Coming soon: Getting Over It VR ...
Till wont run on my 6th gen Pentium!
Rift 2 please!
Yeah make a video about VR while being sponsored by Oculus Rift, talking about conflict of interest
Why is Linus using a 980 ti card at home... Conspiracy!
He says you need better hardware for Skyrim vr.... when lowspecgamer got it to run on a gt 1030 and integrated graphics (vega 11)
FAKE NEWS that rgb definitly gave you a huge boost.
Sponsored by Fascistbook... No thanks.
god VR is still a joke...
No 4K available for this video..
I run my htc vive with an rx 580 and a ryzen 7 1700 and works really good, if it helps someone.. :/
Does my 970 support all these features
Why do we need to game on VR? The application is vast for VR, especially for training simulation for certain job roles. The problem at the moment is the movement, we all know how they work. We also know how some small companies are working toward having the capability of running and staying stationary on a threadmill like platform. Doesn't have to be about gaming. This could be used to give someone who is physically disabled to see the world or educate students from home.
rip people who wants to sell their oculus for 100 cheaper XD
ngl, clicked onto this video very quick
What was that case? Looks good
7:25 and 7:41 - the top right corner says "LOW FPS". So, how is it working good then?
Plus if you come from console with this PC you enjoy all the other luxuries associated with PC gaming
you didn't even go min spec. you can play on a gtx 960!
Oculus Rift owner here! Crysis of VR is Elite: Dangerous, to be honest. It's insanely pleasing to see that 1060 is handling 90% of VR games (judging by the games and performance demonstrated) perfectly, though :) P.S:I also have a 980ti, and well... It is OK on 1.0 SS, but if you really want to have fun and clarity - you need 1.5 supersampling and boom, 980ti is not enough :C
I finaly caved and got a rift+humble 1060gtx gaming laptop glad i waited because there is a serious library now, even if this vr wave never goes mainstream whats availible right now is a no brainer for the asking price, and a serious breath of fresh air to gaming.
1050ti says it's above the minimum requirements doesn't test it in actual VR 1060 says it's definetly capable tests it and runs the "Crysis of VR" at max settings with no problems good testing linus :D
how about 8100 and a gtx 1060 3gb?
I'm assuming this largely remains true with SteamVR as well?
Someone is watching LowSpecGamer too much... hahaha~
I would consider it decent if the price was about $250-$299.
seems like vr would lend itsself well to mutable gpu rendering well since its two different images why can't they send off both eyes to differint cards?
6:22 4:20pm (?????)
750ti Dab
#FLATISNOTBAD
5:00 5$ eBay key fam ??
I would not put toilet paper tubes up to my eyes who knows what germs might be on them. I hope they are new and clean
140 bucks for windows 10 ??? So Microsoft forces people again to go Torrent ? ;-)
Really wish you'd have tested on the 1050ti with really low settings.
Don't build a PC you can buy a laptop with an i5 1060 for nearly that price...
just gonna wait for standalone to get better.
Altho I seen lowspecgamer take on this topic I wanna see how linus does it
Still waiting for the VR headsets to drop to a sane price before I go over :D But it's good to see the prices are coming down.
5:13 Wait, what? Linus actually still uses a GTX 980ti in a build at his house? This man literally has a shelf full of GPU's one and 2 generations newer, as well as AMD comparable performance models and he's still using a Maxwell card in a personal rig. That should speak loud and clear to anybody who is trying to build a budget gaming station for theirselves. You truly do not need the latest model cards and processors to have a great performing PC.
VR is Alive and Well
How about the oculus go? It's under $300.
Why not benchmark the 1050 Ti with a faster CPU to demonstrate your point? I'm curious what difference it would make.
I played beatsaber and onward with a gt 1030 and 4gb of ram yes its very possible and no motion sickness. I also have a htc vive
I think I’m the only one that has a gtx 780
I Tried this literally 2 days ago with a vive pro my buddy has, my rig is two gtx 780's and an fx8350 I was able to play doom on perfect frame rates, Everything ran stable on games such as beatsaber, skyrim, and 3 or 4 others. was pretty cool to see that they worked. my buddy was pretty impressed that it worked so well
90fps is BS, human eye can only see 8 fps
Didn't a Oculus founder fund a internet troll farm for Trump?
linus waving that rtx 2080 around in the beginning made me incredibly anxious
Its great what there doing but alas I prefer HTC over Oculus
;inus i dont get why no test this on more old hardware. i have a galaxy gtx 680 4gb edition on a n htpc running with a i5 2400 and 16gb of hyperx dd3 1600 and plays fallout 4 vr, the climb, sarento and project cars 2 flwalessly (not on super max out setting but close). and i have my main rig running a i7 8700k with 2x 1080 msi gaming x on sli and the diferance is nothing to complain about
what camera did you use for this video? I know it's not the same camera from the other videos.
did linus say he games on a 980 TI......
I love how nobody uses a vr and didn’t care but he still posted That’s linus Hahahahahhahahahah
It is sound cheaper in USD But when I convert it to my local currency, it is more expensive than 2 years ago... I mean.. my local currency is decreasing that much $900 is same as $1000 from last year. FML or in this case FMC
Love the disembodied hands. Shades of Dr Terror's House of Horrors!
“Flat Mode”, the way you always play it Linus..
Thanks for the tips for vr uhm here's something cheaper Viewmaster
can you use a gtx 970?
Corsair LPX DDR4 for 71 USD? Works only with Intel?
I swear the Vessel Shirt is being Worn for "Triggering People"
Buying the Oculus puts more money in the pockets of Lizard Zuckerberg.
7:51 hi to you too
I prefer James Jtechnology Journey
I understand this is sponsored by Oculus, but if we're taking about VR on a budget there's Playstation VR. Maybe you already have a PS4. Farpoint, Moss, Astro Bot, Firewall Zero Hour are some exclusives and it's getting better very quickly. I only mention it in case someone is interested in VR and PC VR is still expensive.
PSVR is good to go!

Ill just say it here because i am a huge outlier i got my pc for $400 has windows home a intel i5 gtx 1060 8gb of ram 3 usb 3.0 ports 2 usb 2.0 ports and what i think is a thunder bolt port from a walmart clearence sale
I have a oculus dk2 and my pc is a only a fx-8350 and a r9 280x and it runs assetto corsa and dirt rally fine and I brought the headset second hand for $210nzd (about 105usd)
Hey Linus I was wondering if you could do a video on the best CPU for VR, I have an 7 year old cpu and I'm using it to run VR I think it might be whats causing the frame drops. Thanks
Lol 1060 is not budget. I'd try a used 970 or R9 290.
Its more like the best way to kill your eyeballs - VR.
Makes video on how to be for cheap. Videos sponsored by oculus rift ?????
linus has never met lowspecgamer, I wish there is a collab between linus and lowspecgamer
I really like my windows mixed reality lenovo vr
Do a video on a "premium vr" experince. Like what would it look like on a quardos with NVlink? What does it take to get a high quality VR? Is it even possible? I'm taking High settings on a next gen HMD like maybe the pimax or vive pro.
Yes get really old vr headsets or get google cardboard
Oculus is a better sponsor than apple
An HP Windows Mixed Reality set can be had for around $180. Spend that savings over an Oculus on some pc parts
How would it perform on a q6600 with the 1060?
Knowing Linus I thought the budget pc would have a 1070ti and 8700k
flat mode? I like the sound of it ( ?° ?? ?°)
Well, I guess I don't have to find out if my system can handle VR. I'm running the same GPU as you do at home.
was that a 1060 3gig or 6
900 isnt really budget
These clickbait-y thumbnails is starting to get pretty out of hand..
A gtx 1050 works great for super hot and beatsaber.
copy of RGinHD and lowspecgamer
The 1060 and RX 480 were both advertised as 'VR Ready' on their respective releases. Of course you can use the 1060 for VR. Waste of a video.
A ps4 isn't that powerful, and it can run (a decent) VR
Can you guys do a video on how to run GTA 5 in VR.
who buys windows for 140 $ ?
send vive
I'd love toknow how much you'd need to overclock a 1050ti to get a palyable system?
Some graphic cards say that they are vr ready but they're not, you need at least a little bit more expensive pc setup than a entry pc setup
My pc has a ryzen 1200 @ 3.8GHz and a gtx 1050 ti. Could I pull off VR?
I don’t know why I’m watching this. My 8700k and 1070 aren’t exactly budget.
I bought VR waay ago, right now the prices for it are budget in my eyes :D
VR will not take off for gaming unless they can offer a consistent 'couch' experience. People don't wanna come home and play a game where they have to stand and move around. the controllers for VR schemes are really bad
Did linus jus say his home set up has a 980ti wtf?
A budget would be more like amd fx cpu or a g4500
"Where's your team spirit?" "At home" It really do be like that sometimes
I guess a 1060 is dirt cheap... Now that we've got RTX LUL
I was hoping this would be a video about all the cheap microsoft headsets from the likes of lenovo and hp Not another garbage advertisement video Linus is such a sellout, the ign of tech tubers
Can you do this again, but with team RED?
i have a gtx 1060, a core i5 possessor and 18 gigs of ram should that be vr ready?
The GTX 1060 6GB that I bought more than a year ago literally has VR Ready written on the box... So it's not like it was impossible to use it for VR before?
The $399 price drop rift is nothing new, and WMR headsets can be found for around $200.
as if you can enjoy RGB with that kinky mask on?
I thought they were actually going to talk about low budget alternatives to the Oculus Rift..... Would have made a much better video imho..... Edit: Or at least it would have been a great thing to add to the video!!! I mean come on LTT! You know you're talking about budget but you forget to consider the headset, controllers and other VR components cost about as much as the PC.... for shame.....
You could have tested with an rx 570...
I use my Note 9 with Gear VR. Good enough for me.
But can it play climb?
PERFECT video for me. Medium system, hopes for VR, often wondering when the sweet spot will be on price to quality for hardware and then what kind of bump I'd need so.....NICE!
Ever since I switched to Sim racing in VR, I've never been able to go back even if I wanted to!
Witch 1060? There's like a jungle of them now...
I don't want the VR spec to go down, I want the headset cost to go down. $120 MAXIMUM for VR porn.
I had an i3-7100 2C 4T 3.9 GHz and a R9 Fury. It ran most VR titles fine, however and surprisingly, Rec Room which has among the crappiest graphics of most VR games, told me that my CPU may not have enough threads to play properly, and it was right. Often during paintball or other activities it couldn't keep up with the player movements. Swapped to a 7700K, no more problems.
So "cheap" VR head set is an oculus, which is the price of a PS4. which you need a 980-1080 GPU (about the price of 2x PS4s) and a steam account filled with VR games. I sum this up as 4xPS4's which in my local RRP is about $2000 . An average second hand car 1990's would set you back about $2-3000 for comparison. Cheap certainly doesn't mean the same thing these days lol
Rift, Ryzen 5 1600x, 1050ti runs most titles without noticeable drops.
No one is asking this but was teh 1060 a 3gb or a 6gb? because i have a 3gb and Im desperately trying to find this information
If you have window.. Or.. Whatever ?? If you know what he mean ??
Honestly I love VR - every year I go to conventions and expos and have a blast. But I don't have it basically because it's still kinda Gen1... even if there's been several gens lol. I could atually get on board with the price if I knew more big games supported it, that it was gonna be a 5 year investment, etc. But it still feels like most of the games are gimmicky VR games you'd absolutely never pick up otherwise, and you kind of just expect there to be a next gen or new standard for VR just around the corner. I like it a lot -NOT FOR ALL GAMES, but for some - and I'm very interested. bit by bit it will keep getting cheaper and then I'll be in, especially if anyone comes up with a standard so you can pick and choose various different branded parts
1060 3GB or 6GB?
excellent video. very informative. thanks!
"The Climb is sort of the Crysis of VR". Good job Linus except, it's the CryEngine and Crytek (Same game engine developer and the same in-house content creation team.) lol Educate these masses Bro!! The CryEngine began its life in Farcry 1 by Ubisoft then Crytek had EA produce the Crysis games. Crytek didn't agree with EA on several things so the "Crysis" legacy ended. EA probably owns IP rights on the Crysis games so it would explain how Crytek was the driving force behind Crysis but was having money trouble. EA are a bunch of money grubbing A-holes! Who here hasn't noticed the trend of releasing titles in $150 "Delux, Platinum, Gold, Exclusive" Bullshite?! How is it that development for video games is cheaper and easier than ever and people are paying 3x the "$40-$60" range??!!
i have 1050 and a core i7 8700k
You forgot a great VR game: Beat Saber
Fallout 4 and Skyrim may not have been designed explicitly VR, but they are probably the best fps in VR.
It's boring to me, I've tried it. It will take way longer before I'll look at it again and until hardware and games evolve for it to much better experience.
Without watching the video.. Ryzen 5 1600, GTX 970, bought used PC and went from there. Spent maybe 600 for the PC and 400 for the rift. No problems other than the rift just really being a pain. Possibly just the cables they use are shit but I'll wait till next gen stuff
I built a similar budget system at about the same price. Ran great even with 8gb ram just couldn't open too many windows until I upgraded to 16gb.
It’s absolutely cool stuff to have but it’s still expensive. Likely there are headsets were you can put in your smartphone to experience 3D with supported apps, now if they will also come with accessoires & apps for different systems, we then can use our smartphones with a ps4 or win10 pc etc,,,, without forking out $ 350 dollars for an official ps4 or pc headset!!!!
I have played over 1000h of VR and I can tell you 90 fps is not "required to prevent motion sickness". Fallout 4 (which I have played over 200h in VR) sometimes runs at like 30 fps and I don't get motion sickness at all, even after like 8h straight. It is just a matter of getting your "VR legs". Back when I was using the Oculus Dev Kit 2, I used to get motion sickness after like 10 mins of free locomotion (using thumb sticks to walk) in games. My specs are i5 3750k, GTX 970, and 8gb of ram. Processor, motherboard and ram are all from 2012. I have over 100 VR games combined on my steam and Oculus libraries. Most less demanding VR games easily run at 90 FPS. Edit: Oh, I forgot to mention that I play everything with all VR comfort options turned off. I do still get motion sickness from flying sims and rollercoaster sims.
but no amd test? hmmmmmm
Who the heck has an I3 running an AIO
So my gtx 980 lives on in the new VR world? Yay!
why not just get like an evga sc15 at that price?
opens PcPartPicker Clicks on Guides Boom. Question answered.
And yet I still can't do VR on my 900$+ PC build because it's a tad outdated. ;P
My GTX 1060 6GB did say VR Ready...
I run an i5 6500 and 1050 ti with Windows Mixed Reality and I have not had any problem with motion sickness from lack of frames.
Can a laptop with a GTX1060 and a i7700HQ and a USB 3.1 port suffice? asking because laptops are not as powerful
I will not be impress until it works on the 69$ computer
jes all you need is a android smartphone with wifi ac or wired via usb to the the gaming rig, and the apk vridge and the windows app riftcat 2.0. and viola vr on a budget
S Y N T H E T I C frames
I am already getting VR for my godlike laptop from 2010 so I guess you can?
I totally thought Linus was going to talk about the Oculus Go or the Oculus Quest.
Beat Saber ??
Sponsor ship aside, what is better: Oculus rift or HTC vive?
Do you think running an i5 6400 and GTX 950 could do? Better cpu but worse gpu
1050ti? I only have a stock 760 2gb : / not as modest as I thought.
Facebook (or HTC) needs to fund game development for VR. That's how Nintendo got games for their consoles.
im sad... my computer is exactly ONE generation too old to run VR. (i5 7400, GTX 1050 2gb). Hey, at least im getting a new one soon! (Ryzen 7 2700x, GTX 1070ti 8gb)
Thanks for covering VR Linus tech Media! Even if sponsored ?? VR needs mainstream!
Uhh.. yeah.. I do VR at max setting with an Oculus Rift 3 sensor room scale on a first gen x58 980x system with 12GB ddr3 and a GTX 1060 6GB. Those items overclocked offer 4.02 Ghz on CPU, with a passmark of 10800 and a cinebench of 1000 (998)... the GTX 1060 is @ +212 and +700,...I don't know if I'm even using any of those helper features... I know I have the oculus Async and spacewarp off... but the nVidia one is news to me. That said... oh, Ram is at 1600 btw... but uh... that said, it all works fine... I don't get motion sick really, so if I dip from 90 per eye, I really don't even notice it or care. Though that said, most everything runs incredibly well even at max settings.. oh, and the system ranks in the top 87% on 3dmark... so yeah... doesn't take a lot, just takes some smarts ... a little bit o smarts... I wouldn't use a 1050 or an i3.... seems idiotic. But with some basic reason and logic you should be good with a pretty modest system, at least in regards to cost. And you can often find an x58 system for free, then piece together the fastest bits after the fact. ALSO, windows 10 STILL allows the use of windows 7, 8, and 8.1 keys to be used with it free of charge... and everyone has an old COA on an old system with a 7, 8, or 8.1 key... likely for pro versions... so if you are buying widows 10.. you the biggest idiot of them all. They give that shit away for free, on purpose.
We need haptic suits and 360 treadmills before I'll be willing to drop a grand on vr. Its just not a complete experience yet.
The rift is really well optimized when you tweak some things (running the rift on an amd fx 4100 overclocked to 4.2 Ghz (3.6 default) + Gigabyte G1 Gaming X1 Xtreme gtx 1070 8GB) (45 fps limited)
900 USD for an i3 + 1060 build? WTF? Even if that's in Canadian Rupees not FreedomBucks™ it's still way too much; you can get a build with the same performance for ~500USD + Windows.
lol yep still don't give a shit...
Hehehe... I still don’t have $400... But I can get everything else...? Tbh, I thought this video would give me a vr alternative, forgetting this isn’t low spec gamer XD
What's better than VR? VR with Ray-tracing... RTX On
thank you so much linus really i will get my first gaming pc in 2019 : Gigabyte arous gtx 1070 i5 8400 16gb 3000mhz ram and i thought it wasn't enought but now i am so happy thanks :)
Plus the price of the headset :/
Right after the +1000$ pimax 8k was out
can confirm that a 1050TI can run VR rather well (paired with a ryzen 5 1600, but that should not really change much) I do use a vive as well
no ad right before the review? What sorcery is it?
I wish he could build me a gaming pc i play on a computer with no graphics
What do you mean 1050ti is the most modest you can do? I wish I had a video card that strong.
I'm tired of people acting like you can't ever turn down settings on VR games. Any modern midrange PC is technically VR ready. Yes, it might look worse, but you'll still have high FPS. This is like the idea that any modern console game could be ported to the Xbox 360: there's no technical reason not to do so, only practical ones.
Linus: Drops RTX Card Me: Ohhh good god
I found this informative and interesting. Could probably dive a little deeper if possible? Probably explore how network (internet) latency affects immersion?
Linus I heard you needed friends so sent you a friend request ;)
Oof looks like I gotta upgrade from my trusty 1050 ti then
love the OG doom swag??
Is every video a sell out thing? I understand he has a lot of people to pay, but this is insane.
You can get Windows mixed reality really cheap. I got mine with controllers refurbished for 135
I'm still rocking my head tracking and it works just fine and if not better than rift in certain games.
can you please review fove VR - it has eye tracking and 2440p and its only 599... is it worth it? im about to shell out 1600 on vive pro and maybe another 1400 on eye tracking. thats another computer price.
i was only half hoping for linus to play vrchat..
hey Linus can i come to your warehouse?
if it went that will i say you can go even lower spec!!
Glad that my i5 and GTX 1070 will be enough
$140 for windows? Ahoy!
can my msi gs65 vr ready? if i buy a oculus would it run well?
I'm to lazy for VR. I wanna sit in my chair or on the couch while playing a game. If i'm supposed to sweat in my freetime, i'll go to the gym.
I just don't get VR, all that hassle and money to play vomit-inducing walking simulators.
Save some more money and get a Lenovo Explorer instead of a Rift. You get full room-scale VR without any external sensors, high resolution than the Rift, and it's only $180.
Isn't occulus still doing sketchy stuff with Facebook
for a new PC builder, I ran an AMD rx 570 and a ryzen 3 1200, and it was able to handle almost every game I threw at it...all except for The Institute in Fallout 4 VR, that was the only place in the only game that I experienced noticeable drops in FPS
The stated question of the video in the title doesn't get addressed properly and is better answered on other smaller channels. This is a ten minute video that's no more useful to watch than checking Facebook's minimum specs page. Your method for seeing if the system can run VR is to run it against a benchmark, which you acknowledge isn't necessarily an indicator of real world performance. Then playing for a bit and saying whether it 'felt' like it ran well or not, with no mention of what in game settings or measures you used to improve performance. There's nothing wrong with running sponsored videos but there's no reason this video couldn't have been more informative, with actual testing rather than purely marketing.
this is a big step for vr!
Nice vid linus
How much harder is it to run the htc vive??
Lol, people still use the word 'paradigm'? :D
980ti lol u tramp linus
????!!!!
Hey thats my system!!!
I played vr on a gtx 1050 ti. Im getting a 2070 this Friday tho
Should I get a htc vive or oculus rift
LOL I RUN VR ON MY RX460
Oculus mentions the GTX 970 as minimum and with some technology updates it might be possible to even use a gtx 960. Then linus shows how it's running on a 1060, which isn't just faster in general but also uses new VR technology...not sure what the point was.
I was hoping this was going to be about the headset prices not the pc...I’m fine on that end
Question for people who know about computers: I have a amd fx 8320 8 cores 3.8 hz processor 16 gb of ddr3 1866hz ram and a 600 wat 80+ psu. Could my system run a 1080 ti?
LowSpecGamer has already answered the question.
I get recommendations on videos like 'you can't see 4" and "you don't see more than 60hz". Can you make a video or two about that?
Im using i7 3770 with 16 gb and gtx 780 with my oculus its nice and all but i still want to upgrade cuz i cant play high demanding games
i wish linus had another channel like Linusgametips
the capture almost gives me motion sickness without VR, if the framerate isn't choppy, then surely the input could use a tad bit of smoothing
2018 and still beating the dead horse. Sucks to be Facebook who bought the bad apple for few billions and can't make the investments back lol And over 1000$ rig ain't even budget for most people.
Can I run vr on lower pc like core 2 duo ?
Mixed reality ...
*turns off rgb* *24 fps*
approaching nirvana is a throwback and a half
Cough cough, gearvr + psmove
Here's a "game" that I'd like you to try to run in VR with that setup. "DCS World". I can almost guarantee that you will have to lower the graphics settings to a point where the game is so ugly its not worth running in VR.
What about AMD GPUs... I mean the Radeon RX 570 is right between the GTX 1050ti and the GTX 1060??
VR games are like going back to 2000 and playing on a VGA monitor with terrible frame rates / resolution on rails. The day I see main stream games being played at 60+ fps at 4k+ ill buy a unit.
I would get VR but I don’t know if I could live without VR ray tracing.
For Boxing Day last year, I bought an Acer Nitro 5, that came WITH an Acer windows MR headset, and it was $1200 Canadian. That's about $920 US. Ran everything fine It was the one with the i7-8750 and the 1050ti
VR LUL
1080P?
Was going to question why Luke didn't do this video.... Then I saw it was sponsored by oculus ... Yeah I don't think they'd like a rant
i got 900$ if anyone knows a good gaming pc im looking at the HP-Omen right now
Wait This Video is only up to 1080p.........
I have a Lenovo Mixed Reality Headset. I got it at a Newegg sale for $200+ shipping. Hell of a steal. Paired with my 4790K PC with a 1060 is well worth it. I can even use it with my 1050 Lenovo Yoga laptop and my media center with a 4790 (non-K) and a AMD 380X. My Yoga struggles, but it can do simple VR. My 380X desktop (Dell) skips a few frames every now and then, but I won't replace the 380X any time soon, unless I replace my 1060, then I'll put the 1060 in there... More than likely, I'll give that PC to a family member in it's present state and build a new desk rig.
when Linus' bare bones PC is better than your PC
Wow that's quite surprising how well that rig handled VR. Props to the manufacturers and game devs for optimising VR so well so quickly. I'm picking up some cheap old parts to upgrade from my $200 trash can atm, and hadn't considered if they'd be VR capable, but going by this video they should work a treat (i7 4790k and GTX 1070Ti).
Aww no ryzen 3 2200g vr :(
Oculus Quest. Cant wait.
I'm good with stand-alone VR headsets. I have a Lenovo Mirage Solo (I preferred it's 6DoF and superior battery life to the Oculus Go which I didn't like very much).
Got my Windows MR Headset for 130$ I think that's all that needs to be said
ASW is shit - fact - no body utilises it and turns it off.
You should have overclocked the 1050 ti. It widens the gap a lot from min spec.
Why not just get a mixed reality headset for $150 on Amazon, that thing runs on a 1050
surface pro 3 i5-4300U 2core + 2 virtualized processors no dedicated graphics card? maybe?
urgh yet another sponsored vid, lots of those on your channel right now. Not good
What about a review of the new Samsung Oddysey VR Plus that got released recently to compare it against HTC Vive Pro? :) Nice video though!
Linus please can you do a video on how to make a android game
Turns out I have a vr ready pc at home and even my laptop fullfills the bare minimum specs .-. Now I only need a VR headset. Though looking at the news I'll wait at least for the next gen
PS VR?
Thank you sooo much for this one! how far can you psh this cpu to gpu ratio? any good estimations or tools out there? A ryzen5 2600 OC with a 2080TI?
I’m really not sure what the purpose of this video was, pretty much everyone that is interested in VR, knows that the GTX 1060 is the best budget gpu for VR. I mean I understand that the cpu can be more budget oriented but that doesn’t really warrant a whole video, and to put the cherry on top, I purchased a Windows Mixed Reality headset for 150 dollars!! And WMR has improved drastically since Linus last did a video on it. So really it seems like Linus might have just made this video for the sponsor, which I completely understand but hey, it is what it is
>399 dollars >on a budget
good to know. glad prices went down.
Ssoo, my geforce 710 wont work?
"Flat mode"
I own a rig with an AMD FX8350 and a GTX1060 6G, is it as good as the i3 rig or would the Fps drop and if so ist it possible to play VR with it?
But Linus. Flat is Justice. Especially at 1440p 144hz.
Oh, so you made this video "just for me" because of my previous complaints. Thank you :)
That framerate though
I'm sad that there hasn't been much word on what HTC is up to with the vive ;( Don't get me wrong VR is VR and any improvements is great, it's just that I'm a Vive owner that feels flooded with Oculus news
awesome video as I have been looking at VR a lot lately, but for sim racing - would these kind of specs correspond for that kind of use?
Tape a mac pro to your back and run VR with it.
Just the video I needed.
Will any quad core work?
For me the problem isn't getting hardware powerful enough to run VR. My current rig would have no problems. The problem is having the space to set VR up. You should do a video about setting up VR when your space is limited.
If you want VR for cheap, go to your local mall Your welcome...
More VR!
Cheap ass rgb led stripe with remote and controller 10$ from aliexpress.
i wanted to test my pc as ive been interested in vr for racing simulators i play and i was surprised by the results. USING: Intel Core i3-6100 dual core NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti windforce It managed to crank out 3982 on the orange room with an average of 86.81fps. which places it just above the minimum mark to run oculus vr i may get an oculus yet haha!
he sayed his home rig is a gtx980 ti please tell me that was a slip
Honestly just buy a windows mixed really headset. They run well and cost half the price of the Oculus with no real downside.
Still waiting for the NerveGear...
ayyy i have a gtx1060 amd ryzen 2700x 8 cores 16 threads(overboard cpu)
I highly doubt it but just hoping 1050 i3 will work Edit: I’m like 1 min into the video and I have a i3 7100 and a 1050 so it’s slightly lower than mininum
I followed this for 5 fucking mins and then the bloke says $1k fml
I run VR on a 1050 (mobile) and an i5 7700HQ.
Get r5 2600, much better value, but it's GPU bound anyway, and now 1070ti is the best value too.
I used a Dell Precision T3500 with a Xeon X5670 and 24 GB of RAM with a GTX 970 and it can play VR easily.
Buy your virtual boy now
But can it run minesweeper?
I really appreciate you covering some VR! I think VR is quite incredible, even at this early stage, and doing a VR-centric build was really cool.
For PC there's absolutely nothing to play in VR.
Nice doom poster
But can it be run on a Pentium g3258 anniversary edition?? ??
My budget 7.65€ what can i get?
thanks for crushing dreams oculus
The outro music is Sugar High (Approaching Nirvana)
I run my Vive on a laptop. I'm not kidding.
Everybody knows that putting a lot of RGB LEDS in your PC makes it 1x as fast.
Virtual reality! Cutting edge technology for games nobody wants to play more than 5 minutes. Awesome!
$200. Oculus go. No phone or laptop
"production manager" u guys are really felling your selves
pretty sure people knew that you could use a 1060 for VR....
If they can find a way to implement a physical system to prevent the user from running around and toppling things, then that's when the tech is actually feasible as a gaming machine. Right now it's pretty limited and is nothing more than a novelty toy.
Sony did the "frame guessing" for smoother framerate in psvr two years ago
Ivan's accent in 6:08 makes that soo much funnier
Try flight sim Aerofly fs 2.0 in vr mode,.... Awesome....
Linus looks like a crispy toast 7:46
VR is going mobile probably They couldn't make enough money with the PC headsets
300 ish euro for a VR headset is just too much in my opinion. I bought a 3d monitor when they were all the rage and while its fun for a couple of days/weeks the novelty quickly wears off and then (in the VR headset case) you'd be stuck with a pretty pricy paperweight.
The RX570 should be able to meet the spec then, would like to see a follow up/compare NVIDIA and AMDs VR tech.
Can it run on my I5, Intel inside 620, 8gb ram? ??
Gtx 960 + fx 6300 vr ready thoughts?
It's called Dave and Busters
The answer? Yes. I have a secondary VR rig comprised of a Q6600, 780 Ti, Oculus DK2 and PS Move Controllers. Cost me around £200 total. Works great at Low/Med settings.
a oculus in my country cost as much as my pc which is not a cheap one here(7700k, 1060 6gb). So no vr for me...
Back yard got this bro
I am running a very similar system at home with a ryzen 3 1200 instead of the i3. Now I know what to expect off VR. Thx Linus!!
So what we've learned: The minimum specs that oculus provides is a pretty good indicator of your PC's capability.
was hoping you Would atleast test out the 1050ti ingame
could somebody please tell me if an AMD Radeon r7370 4gb gddr5 is ok? got an I 7 and 16gb ram.
phlat mode
I uessed that he used a core i5-8400 cpu and an rx 580 gpu. Let's see what Linus really used to help play VR content.
VR is bulshit for years now, we don't care. instead get out and meet real people
I have an old system that I used to run the HTC Vive when it first came out. It had a slightly overclocked GTX 960 and a $60, 6 Core AMD FX Processor clocked at 3.5 GHz. It passed the SteamVR performance test and could run games like Onward on Low-Medium settings and games like Audioshield at Medium-High settings. Although I bet it dropped under 80FPS every once and a while, I never noticed any stuttering after I adjusted the in-game settings and never got motion sick. You could build a very similar computer to that one for roughly $400 (including windows 10) right now. I know newer games are going to be more demanding, but I also haven't tried it with Oculus's ways to "increase performance."
I play oculus on a 1050ti with an i3 7100, works fine for me, though at Christmas I'm going to upgrade to a 1070 as big games like marvel super powers run very poorly. (I'm also gonna get an i5 7500)
lol I also use a 980 ti for vr gaming
The tech that helps fill out frames on drops need to be constant in order to not suck when it kicks in, especially in racers. It's nice you can cut down the required specs but just too bad there's no Astro Bot or Firewall or Honor and Duty: D-Day (32 player WW2 battle royale).
But Can the RTX 2080 Ti and i9 can run vrchat at 91 FPS with 30 ppl (with unoptimized avatars)
didn't understand 80% of the things you said in this video but it was still good
You shoulda gone the windows mr route, I got mine with controllers new for $140
who tf pays 140$ for windows when you can get it for under 10$ from ebay
well on my oculus rig, it runs any game max with an i5 and a 1050ti. and probably cost way less than $900. maybe. i don't know it was a gift
will a 3gb 1060 be able to handle it tho? .... says that it should... but will it?
Umm..... OCULUS GO?!
you can make a bootable usb stick using the microsoft media creation app and you can activate windows for $5 using a key from ebay which you will receive in like 1-2hours the same day its not a scam i did it mutiple tiimes jus make sure you get the right key
I'm still waiting for Oculus drop the faith to $99, if it's happen, "auto buy" will be my first reaction...
"some of the RGB nonsense" what! Dislike.
A gtx 1060 is not budget. It's half the price of my entire system.
My rig is a Ryzen 5 2600 and a GTX 1070, great rig to play VR in :3
OR WEREVER....LIKE IM GONNA PAY 140 DOLLARS FOR A Windows I GET for free...i only support small devs
?? Youtube +??Comments +??Originality +?? This folder is empty
Honestly, if the title is "Can you Game in VR on a Budget?" you should check for other VR Solutions as well instead of only Oculus Sponsoring. Check VRRidge / RIftcat with Android. THAT is VR on a Budget (14$ + Initial Smartphone cost, I think) This is getting a common theme in the videos lately, you don´t give the full picture anymore. Seems like you choose "the easy way"
But when will we get VR for the Xbox one X as promised
I played almost all the games on my i5 and gtx 960 ti perfectly but now oculus updated so i have to upgrade my gpu.
low spec gamer is shaking a fist at you right now
the video I was waiting for since I was born! well propably not :'(
Linus Tech Tips has turned into some sort of Advertisement inception Ad inside an Ad inside an Ad
I REAAAALLY want to know what you call "max settings" in The Climb, because even my OC'd R5 1600 + GTX 1070 combo can only run most levels at 45fps with not-even-maxxed-out settings. I even saw the 45fps warning popup in your video (07:24). Stop lying ;)
For curiosity 1050ti with better CPU isn't enough?
Wow thanks Oculus now i can enjoy PS one graphics strapped to my face
Eum... Nvidia's VRworks isn't implemented in practicality any games right now
Just look at the potato masher vr video, running vr on a 1st gen i5 and a 760
Damn. I've got a plenty powerful enough CPU but only a GTX 960 and no money to upgrade...
Alright linus, we need to talk about the titles and thumbnails on the most recent videos (This one is less bad) They are pretty clickbaity. it's getting a bit out of hand
oculus LUL
Liked for having Wolf3D and Doom in the background :P
quite wrong ,gtx 960 is a pretty damn good graphic card yet you cant vr on it , you need modern GPU to play vr
Imagine when VR evolves into NerveGear like in Sword Art Online and you just need lay on bed and say link start to full dive inside a game to play it.
Now i am checking WMR with i5 (1150 socket) and older HD7870 videocard. This videocard was in old times strong videocard. The first WMR tests went pretty good on automatic settings, but need test more VR games to see limits of old HD7870. I come back later with results. Another PC with i5-2500 CPU (that is old 1155 socket) and GTX1060, is also pretty interesting low budget pc. That is because socket 1155 CPUs are much cheaper than socket 1150 cpus. Think about it.
Try and play project cars 2 ????????????
This is terrible research... Lowspecgamer did a proper budget build. Also my i5, RX480 8gb, 16gb ram is three years old, cost me 850 back then and runs vr great!!
Still have my windows 10 free because they offered "sign in with your outlook account". It's been 3+ years with free windows :)
my HTC Vive is actually really portable because i run it off a I7/1060 Laptop and cant say I am disappointed .
I love my VR systems (vive and oculus go and gear vr) but they all leave what i call "warpaint" in my face... it also hurts after a while. Even though I am a total VR fan... it is clear that we are dealing with an incredibly immature tech here with more flaws than features.
I have a phenom ii x 6 @ 4.2 GHz and a r9 290 works pretty well but would recommend a ryzen 3
So 1300 inlcuding the headset
Yeah it's called going outside.
Headsets are still pricey for what is still a niche thing in the grand scheme of things.
4770k 4.0 GHz r9 390 still get 5800+ in VRMark. the Free version is somehow locked on the Vive Settings, and i still average 126 frames. Now, considering i'll be playing Racing Games with an Oculus Dk2, i will be golden. Lower framerate requirements, lower resolution, not that good but 1000 times better than a regular monitor or tv for Sim Racing. It's a dated Pc but it gets the job done, and would still cost less than a current gen. Thank you for talking about VR, this technology really needs a bump. People are forgetting about it, Game companies have little interest in implementing VR on their games if they don't get sponsored.. (Codemasters Dirt Series and F1 Series)
Could my twin son game in VR on his laptop? Lenovo z50, AMD FX7500, 8GB RAM and AMD R7-M260DX 2GB graphics? He wants a oculus for Xmas but I don’t know if his machine can hack it. It can run most modern “Flat Games” well.
Was disapointed on this when i saw budget i thought you was going to go older gen products to see whats the best you can get out of older tech
Until VR has good games and the headset is light enough to not really "feel" it, ill never care about VR
VR is still mostly a joke. Not because VR is inherently bad, but because all these big companies clearly rushed in with garbage products trying to create a fad. We don't need VR that runs on every PC, we just need GOOD VR! Limiting the entire ecosystem for the sake of compatibility with machines that will have been long forgotten in a few short years is the most gross mistake I've ever seen from such a large group of people. Selling a $600 headset with what is equivalent to 720p 90hz displays was an absolute insult to gamers, dropping the price to $400 barely makes any difference, they're still trying to sell a piece of garbage for $400. The industry is moving on, I might get an Acer OJO 500 just for kicks but it's still disgusting that these devices are all limited to 90hz. THIS IS PC GAMING! LET US CHANGE THE REFRESH RATE! I will not be happy with VR until we have a headset with full 4K 120hz per eye, and even that should have been the entry point for the industry. "GOOD VR" would be 5K 240hz (again, 5120x2880 Per Eye, and 240hz Per Eye, with the option of alternating frames to get a doubled framerate of 480hz).
399$ on a budget... HMMMMMMM
By the way, Oculus rift 2 was canceled and developers are fired.
Hey Linus I've noticed in all your videos you reach down and interact with some type of device during your video's usually its in your pocket. Could you maybe explain that?
Well, I have a WMR lenovo explorer with a GTX 1050 2GB (overclocked it myself) and an I3-7100. Very surprised by the performance. Been playing job sim, beat saber, superhot vr, space pirates, gorn, the lab, ... All at a stable 90FPS.
Yes you can! Set your budget on the ground > Put on VR headset > Start playing > Stand on the budget > congrats, you are now gaming on a budget.
I mean I really still don’t want to spend 400$ on it
No
This is stupid, why would he do this video? Oh right its a sponsor...
Forget vr biggest vaste of money ever there no good games unless your into paying for unfinished rushed indy games that are way overpriced.
I only see on one eye, so 2D it is.
I felt pro until he used a gtx 1060 as budget hahahha
You can do vr with a ryzen3 1200 and a 1050 and it still works well
Budget VR = smartphone and a couple lenses. XD
Or just buy a ps4
WHYYY for 72.50$ you could buy an HDD 1TB (35/40$) and 120GB SSD (26$)!! Btw, nice video, as always. <3
I used to have an Oculus Go, however, I had to get rid of it due to the fact that yes I could wear my glasses while using it but after less than 5 minutes of using it my eyes would have a burning like sensation. I did later figure out this was due to my eyesight so I really spent £200 on a device I used for about a month and then took a loss of £50 when selling it. Just remember if you are going to invest in something like this have a go with it or if you have a friend who has one go and try theirs out. Also, gaming with one controller is honestly shite.
u mean gtx 1080ti u why the fucked would u use the gtx 980 ti ,
The lighting in the set was just perf
YOU HAD BEAT SABER RIGHT THERE AND YOU DID NOT PLAY IT!!!!! I HELD YOU IN HIGH REGARD LINUS! but now......
Thanks for showing off VR linus! You guys are helping it become more main stream!
So... don't even try it with my fx 8320e and gtx 770
I was able to run Pavlov and Beat Saber on a 2013 Alienware laptop, it had a GTX 765M (equal to a GT 1030 GDDR5) and an i7 4700MQ.
Dude my friend used a broken iphone as a screen and some razer hydra controllers from 2012 and a laptop with a 920M in it and got it to work in the middle of class and joined me in VRChat hes got the most ghetto setup in the world
Commercials as always with Africans. Occulus Aid for Africa: virtual food. I am wishing them success with their intended audience.
what a surprise, the 1060 which is also the lowest NVIDIA card with a "VR ready" sticker, can play VR..... you guys could've made this much more interesting
hahaha vessel shirt
resolutionscaling to 80% and a 1050ti, rx 570 or gtx 970 is all you need. I wouldn't recommend it though.
ASUS P8Z68 - I5 2500K @ 4.9GHZ - EVGA GTX 780 OC'd - 16gb vanilla RAM - 120gb Samsung SSD + 1TB Hdd - Corsair cooler - seasonic 750w focus gold - USB 3.0 PCI card - HP WMR headset running through active HDMI to DP converter for 90FPS. All bought 2nd hand except PSU and built myself, running all major Racing sims with a Logitech G920 no problem......Total cost under £400 for PC and £150 for wheel, pedals and shifter...…...If you do your research and use patience it's totally possible.
But how about a nice gtx970?
I even run with WMR headset on old i7 laptop with even more old GTX940M. Oh wait, can you run it? It can run, thanks to resolution slider to make it even lower to 900 pixels. Of course 900 is way too low, but WMR headset displays stayed on 1440 pixels so there are no big pixels. It's just more softer image and lower sharpness, but still same SDE. If you wear very old 900x900 headset, you can see pixels clearly. It just scale up the picture. I did even Beat Saber with GTX940M with adjusted resolution on ~950x950. The Labs is more heavy than Beat Saber, so at 900x900 i have slight better gameplay. But real budget is WMR. (200 Euro / 200 dollar around) because Oculus is still double in price. Oculus is not budget VR. Long time ago, Oculus is cheaper than Vive, before WMR came on market. That is why many users have Oculus / Vive. You should examine again, but with WMR headset. (and there is newer Samsung headset with new low-SDE amoled displays - which is also WMR headset).
something about VR ? Nice.
RGB NONSENSE ???
You guys should take another look at Windows Mixed Reality. It’s improved a lot since your initial video. For less than half the price of a Rift you can get 90% of the experience. I was expecting this video to mention WMR but then I saw it was sponsored by Oculus lol
VR HEADSETs are still very expensive
try VRChat? :D
Yeah google cardboard you can... Look at houses
Oculus Rift is a joke.
Wait why the fuck did windows jump up %40
You really need to do more budget VR gaming videos. You can get a brand new Lenovo explorer for half the price. $200
Let’s be honest, If you’ve shelled out a fortune to play VR, HTC Vive is gonna be your first choice.
i9 9900k and rtx 2080ti is all you need
vives turn Vive vive vive vive
Vr is so lit and I’m so excited for Oculus Quest
My main PC has a AMD A10 5800K 8 gb of ddr4 ram a R7 250 2Gb with a 1900 x 1080 screen it can run VR fine with Windows Mixed Reality hardware so you can have a weak ass PC as mine and can have VR just fine
So I guess my older gaming laptop with a i7 and gtx 860 2gb isn't going to vr. Sad but true. But rdr2 will fill that void for awhile.
Can the linus team do Star Trek bridge crew , why only a gtx 980 , why not a 2080ti upgrade for your vr setup.
Dam I only have an i3 6100
I got my pc near the end of last year and made sure it would be ready for vr because it’s something I’ve been very interested in. I built my pc for $500 with an i3 7100 I got on sale and a used gtx 970 for $150 right before mining really made them shoot up in price. I bought a wmr headset, the dell visor, for $150 on eBay, new in box, and I couldn’t be happier. The i3 and 970 handle vr amazingly, not just at bare minimal performance and settings. It’s a very comfortable experience, and I’m quite prone to motion sickness. I tried google cardboard and got nauseous immediately from all of the stuttering. A full vr setup can be easily achieved for $650 or less if you’re willing to be patient and search around. $900 is definitely not the true minimum.
Linus is the man i watch you every vid my sisser aan my brother also watch your tech tips you are learning me thinks every vid i followed you with 4 acc : every one who sees my comment / sub to me for luck in your life
Yes, it's called PSVR
i use a Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop i5675 (replaced the cut down rx560D) ryzen 5 1400 overclocked to 3.9ghz at 1.375v 8gbs of 2400mhz ddr4 ram gigabyte gtx 960 2gb 1tb 7200rpm system drive 1tb 7200 rpm steam drive 500gb 5400 old gaming drive for 20GBs of page filing for when vrchat uses up a lot of ram
Still waiting for the prices of the oculus rift (+ controls) to drop , here in Uruguay they are selling for almost 900 USD , so.... no today xD, interesting video in fact, already have a 1060 6gb and a 7th gen core i 7 , so... will test it with the superposition!
399? I'd rather buy a Ps4 Pro then :P
Thx for covering a similar rig to mine i have a gtx 1050ti and an fx 6300
Okay so you test One graphics card doesn't work you test another that's about double the price and then you call it good and that's your minimum spec why not test multiple graphics cards why not test older graphics cards on the used Market to show what kind of budget system you could run you also tested an 8th gen quad-core what about the second third and fourth gen I3 I5 is a people could have there's so much more you could have done with this video that you chose not to do
Could my computer handle vr well. Specs: 4gb ddr4 ram Intel core i5 Gtx 1060 (I think)
Bare minimum... So sad. You should've at least done dual 2080ti s with a 9900k
Interesting...last week steamVR implements built-in framewarp-alike mechanism (interpolating 2 frames onto the in-between frame) and now Oculus sponsors their headset video xD But tbh, oculus is insanely good for the price atm
CPU - AMD Ryzen R5 2600 - $160 Board - MSI B350 Tomohawk - $75 HS/F - Wraith Cooler (included with the CPU) RAM - G.SKILL AEGIS DDR4 2666 - $60 GPU - MSI Armor RX 580 8G OC - $225 HDD - Toshiba P300 7200 RPM - $85 PSU - EVGA 500W BQ 80+ Bronze - $40 Case - Fractal Design Focus G - $50 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total - $695 (w/o the OS) This $695 rig blows that rig in the video ($770 w/o the OS) out of the water for VR, gaming and general purpose computing. My OS was an upgrade from Windows 7, so I don't know the newer SKU's, but ever since microsoft started following apple, they doubled down on the service model by giving away their operating system for free to everyone. The downside is just a watermark/logo on the lower right side corner of the screen saying "Activate Windows". It just stays there forever, even if you don't activate. There are NO performance related issues whatsoever (in ANY tasks, mainly gaming, VR or general) on having an unactivated license. There are some enterprise features that are restricted if I remember correctly which are related to local networking, but nothing major. If you still want to purchase a Windows 10 license, head over to reddit's r/microsoftsoftwareswap and get it for around $40. No need for this $140 daylight robbery of a physical SKU. Before you ask, no, these are NOT illegal grey market keys generated through credit card fraud, like G2A and Kinguin. They're for UG students, but these retailers (some of them OEM's) are selling them online.
eeeeeh. What about Ryzen APU's..
Short answer: Oculus Quest Wireless No pc 6dof Controllers Anywhere 50+ games on launch 399$ Release: next spring
An i5 4670k and a R9 280x will give you the same performance costing only $100 each.
Real life Brendon Small from Home Movies all grown up
Why not an AMD 220GE instead of the i3?
Casually hold 1400 dollar ASUS 2080 ti that isnt available in NA lololz
i wouldnt trust linus to change the batteries to my remote
what about older CPUs, like the most infamous i5-2500k or i7-2600k? with for example an 1060 or 580?
ERm, Linus, are you stoopid? People's eyes can only see in 30fps, none of this matters you idoiot
A gtx 970 and r9 390 has been the minimum for years for vr. Having a 1060 puts it above minimum specs
I'm honestly not sure why y'all accepted this sponsorship deal. Oculus is owned by Facebook. Facebook is complicit in genocide. Their money should not be good anywhere.
“Superman Falls Sometimes”
I have Oculus Rift and my PC : Intel Core i7-6700k GTX 1060 3gb 16gb ram and I always play on a low setting for the VR games
980Ti?
What? A few hours ago i was searching for cheap vr and performances with 1050ti!!
During the testing you guys used 16GB of RAM, but when showing the price you guys only had 2 X 4GB of RAM, a bit sketchy.
The guy in the backround is bothering me he keeps looking and looking away and touching his pc even though he isn't using it
Try the PS move service, it works really well for me for under $100 (excluding a gear VR and compatible Samsung phone). Edit: For the setup, not the PC.
Not a fair test!! RGB adds 25 FPS everyone knows that
Hey bean, you can get win 10 pro for 14 us dollars on scdkey.com
Go AMD. It offers pretty much the same performance, but cheaper. https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Victor70537/saved/#view=WzwCbv
My oculus is 8 months old .. main power wire is dodgy and one ear doesn’t work ... good fun but not reliable
you can go even cheaper by using the PSVR for steam games. Plus PSVR you can wear spectacles, with Oculus you can't unless they changed it recently.
400 bucks not including a computer isnt budget. Not a tight one at least.
VR ready but, I'm not. ??$$
Okay, as 'tech giants' in the online video world, you have a responsibility as of now... Why is there not a piece of tech available to alleviate the 'itchy balls' teleprompter problem??? Seems like there's a relatively easy solution, surely. Ask in a video, and I'll bet you spark some sort of small wave that creates a decent product to help the controls work far more seemlessly...
what a bummer, for me oculus costs 449 eur
Acer i3-8100, 8GB @ newegg for $399. Add EVGA GTX 1060 for $250 (after MIR). $650 for VR Gaming Rig.
I feel like VRChat should be tested when testing VR
"Where's your team spirit?!" "At home..." Fair, I guess...
Where's the R3 2200G? Low Spec Gamer played Superhot VR on it! On the APU graphics itself!
This was very disssapointing. For people ~~like my dad~~ with good enough PCs, but not a headset, made me think this video was about getting a cheap headset, but was just pc. my disappointment iss 10000%
When I saw the title I thought they were actually going to see how low they could go but this was disappointing
Everyone need to try VR. If u have place u can go and try...try it. you dont have to buy it now but u need to know what it´s capable of.
Have no idea about others, but I would enjoy headset that projects nice curved screen into eyes much more than immersive vr stuff and break something in my room by accident lol.
yay VR
Song at 7:50?
Shit channel, shit person, read your fucking comments and already sisband your company and kill yourself you fucking jackass.
Vrchat 45fps with 1070... Sad
You can buy windows on ebay for as low as 5$
Honestly, if it's just for games, I think a cheaper SSD would be MUCH better than a 1 TB HDD. For the price you listed of ~$70, why not a 480 GB SSD? I think half the space is definitely worth the speedy boot times and game load times. I know the standard used to be a big HDD and updating to an SSD for the boot drive later on, but after my own recent conversion I feel like starting with an SSD then getting a HDD later on when you need space for crap like school/work files or uh... "Personal documents" (aka porn) would work out better for most gamers. Anyone else agree?
linus and Budget in the same video is this heaven ?
This is joke, this is true budget vr test. https://youtu.be/gIc3oUByAbk And there is og ps4 + psvr and is cheaper then pc itself.
WAIT, LINUS USES A 980ti? NOT A 2080ti? HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN sorry for caps!
well thats good to know that vr is becoming cheaper to actually obtain
Okay linus.. uhm. I have an i5 4670 and a GTX 760, and i run VR quite well on my machine, although i am looking to upgrade to a 1060 sometime, but for now. My 760 and 4670 is really good for the price Btw i am using the oculus rift and getting solid 90 fps in most games
Linus:"Where's your team spirit?' Ivan: "At home." Fucking legend
Just get a vive
Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom 2, Unreal Tournament and Total Annihilation. Whoever works at that station deserves a raise
When Linus says your name. Haha
I have a Ryzen 7 and an RX 480, I'm noticing in Budget Cuts, loading screens and even Steam VR home, my controllers and sometimes my headset will kind of jerk back and forth while I'm moving. Is that hardware? Would upgrading my gpu fix that? I dont think its the tracking because it doesn't always happen for every game or VR application.
Upcoming reviews of pimax 8k and 5k? An updated opinion for 2nd gen vr? That'd be awesome exposure since pre orders are open right now! Awesome work as always!
VR capable GPU runs VR, who knew? lol
Linus has access to RTX 2080ti and uses a 980ti in his vr rig at home! What??!? Why??
Please do a Part II with actual games
I got i5 4460 3.2ghz 16gb ddr3 1600mhz nvidia gtx 745 2gb vram. Still can play vr with avg of 30 to 50 fps wen i lower the quality down
You're not shilling for Apple today?
You lost me at i3 8100 xD I run on an i5 3470/1050ti, and my friend on an i5 2400/1050ti. Get outta here with your "low" end cpu hahaha, that thing is far from a min spec cpu. Really disappointed y'all didn't even test the 1050ti. There are plenty of channels and vids out there showing real 1050ti vr footage, and that it is very playable. You basically showed everyone how recommended specs run. Great job.
well 400 dollars is still expensive
yeah the climb is just a measly tech demo even though it features varied levels, innovative mechanics, and interesting gameplay
What about the 1060 3gb
If you have a headset and an iPhone, there’s an app called Duet Display that can be used for some VR stuff. It uses a cable to extend the desktop to the iPhone lag-free. This works with anything that does split-eye VR. Think Dolphin emulator or VR movies. Works really, really well.
VR is just a gimmick IMO, it’s more for casual gamers...
Just buy a mixed reality headset for a couple hundred cheaper
Lol just boy the virtual boy
Imagine a VR game where you're playing as someone who is playing a VR game where they're playing someone who is playing a VR game.
I'm not anti-VR, and I like the production quality of this video. However, Oculus VR is still hopelessly expensive for anyone budget orientated, because even that basic system cost $8-900 (new). Then you have to almost double that for a decent Oculus Rift setup (headset, controllers, & cameras). And all to play what? A few free games, a few tech demos, and some AAA flagships that work better outside of VR? No thank you. Oculus/Facebook, if you're watching: You'd get a much better ROI if instead of trying to convince people that VR is cheap enough to even consider, you'd actually sponsor AAA, exclusive VR titles. Then people would actually want to spend money on an expensive system in the first place. This video is putting the cart before the horse, IMO. I say this as someone who's actually used the Oculus Rift.
i play vr with a 1050ti i5 7500 8gb ddr4 2x4 ram and a HP mixed really headset, The gpu was 150, Cpu and mobo were 200, ram was 90 and the headset was 160 lol
4:47 Superposition says 16Gb. 4:54 System has 8Gb of RAM!
If you really want to see VR on a budget then go and watch the Low Spec Gamers video
Vr on a budget with a 1060. At least try some older hardware and dont do things that say on the box "VR Ready".
They should do something with VR for Carpenters, Handy Man Dry walking etc would really make work project easy
What about the virtual boy?
Nice to see some vr content here. More people need to try this amazing way to play games. Starter to play vr games 3 years ago and 2D gaming is almost dead for me. VR is so much better
I have a Pentium g4560 and a 1050ti...... I definitely need to upgrade for vr
I was running my HTC Vive on a Phenom II X4 955 BE with a 750 ti. I had to turn the game settings all the way down while overclocking to the absolute max. But it worked and was fun and immersive. I've since updated my computer but it was still super fun on my old system which was way under what you guys are calling minimum.
Throws away monitor, uses VR with multiple Virtual Monitors instead! So, it's VirtualMonitors in VirtualReality on a VirtualMachine... mind blown...
I was personally actually fine running on a laptop with a GTX 780M!
f* gaming! Will VR porn run on 1050Ti ?
Are you sure it render at 90fps without RGB RAM?
Hey, how much for that signed Total Annihilation poster?
I get nausea watching it. The jitter is awful.
I thought that vr headset is budget edition or something
So I'm more than fine with a 6700k and a 1070ti? Good to know
I have an Acer nitro 5 I am ready for all and nothing
so you didn't even bother to test the lower end spec to give people your actual experience of what its like on a low wend machine? Whats the difference in experience between true 90 and a locked ASW 45? how annoying are the artefacts? Can you push the specs even lower than the min recommended 1050ti and if you do what sort of titles are you limited to? What about a second hand machine? i5 4460 and gtx 970 for $400 on ebay get you similar results? These are just the questions i thought up in 30 seconds! Pretty low effort video overall!!
The killer VR creation app is DREAMS on the ps4 !!!!
Am i the only one who wanted them to try VR on the 1050ti?
with windows mixed reality yes just need a strong enough pc fuck oculus and htc vive buy a cheap dell visor and customize it
Linus, do you really use a gtx 980ti at home? Why don't you use a gtx 1080ti or a titan V or a RTX 2080ti?
Mmmm you should test and amd system that would be helpful like say a Ryzen 5 1400 with a 1060
I have a Gtx 960 and I play all the major vr titles full ultra and 90 FPS haha
What would you recommend for pocophone to watch VR porn?
Bottom line, it's still tied with Facebook. Hard pass.
Linus's definition of "budget" is not the same as mine rip
VR is great for simracing, maybe do a review on that some day?
I used a GTX 770 4gb for Vr and it was playable in games like War thunder or Pavlov VR
I go outside for RR reality. Real Reality.
If youre using a nvidia card why dont you just use geforce experience and use the nvidia fps counter?
i think the newer quad core i3's are lots good enough for gaming these days as long as you don't plan on streaming
Raytracing x VR
Fuck you. I’m unsubscribing.
The whole "Facebook owns Oculus" thing has made me stay away from their products in favor of the HTC Vive, but it is really cool to see all the new VR stuff they've been doing.
But the RGB is what makes it so fast
Who pays 140$ for Windows 10, when you get a key for 15$ like everywhere
Aww, I was hoping it was an Oculus Quest review.
Just before this video I got a "Cybershoes" commercial, the tech seems interesting why don't you guys try to get a pair and try them?
Great video
i thought spiderman climb and superman fly...seems i was wrong
Occulus Quest?
How about a game like DCS World in VR, not these micro-VR games.
He games at home on a 980ti ?? somehow I don't believe that !
Not even close to SAO ??
Really linus? Really? 1991 called they want their paddle controllers back. You know really sucks? 2018 VR with stick controls/paddles, Hell even 90's VR had gloves. I feel that all the VR companies are just spinning their wheels just to make money. I mean 2018 we should have fully optimised Dual graphics cards (one for each eye), no screen door, 200 degrees field of view, Haptic gloves and suits and fully wifi aka no cables, and a kinda cyberith device, all for the price of $399 or £399. Not to mention the Trash games out there, this is why VR will not be bought by me until this is all fixed and is bundled together. Occulus /Vive / Sony / Pimax - Up your LAME ASS attempt at VR ... seriously. (Ohh and while your at it make the devices a global price not just screwing EU over and over and over again).
SLI on vr???
I wonder how much time it took to make the video while playing. I suppose not that much. But when the gear came off Linus had a red forehead and cheeks. So i'm guessing that VR is not such a good choice if you game for hours and hours and hours, i mean at least 12 hours a day.
I was hoping that my 850m laptop could run vr lol, guess I´ll keep watching Vr games on YouTube
any idea why i keep getting dropped frames and constant controlor lag when im gaming in vr? ive got a gtx 1080 and and i7 6700k
for some reason my dog loves watching linus videos...
When he said fast forward 2016 I remembered 21 Savage - no heart
The LowSpecGamer did this already! With even lower specs.
niggas wit one eye should get it half off
I am 14 and I want to get into making computers but I have no money or any way of getting money do you know any way I could start
7.1 M subscribers ... Well done team
Jesus.... Another advert, it never ends!
900+ $ without the VR Headset -> 1.2-1.4 k with it
owo i know work Great on AMD ryan 7 with 1060 because friends own one n play a lot smoother n later he got 2080 turn out was pieces of crap doesnt work well so he sent back for return his money n he bought other 1060 work goods i was supries he still playing with it but he doesnt tell nobody but me
https://youtu.be/S4TBPL7-iRk
Paid ads, as usual
It depends on the game. Of course a 1050 TI can't do Fallout 4 VR on high settings with supersampling on but most VR games/apps run just fine at least on default/medium settings.
VR or AR? you decide 1 like - VR 1 reply - AR
Do VR gaming booths in your LAN cafe already !
Should’ve covered oculus quest
Define budget!!!
Boi, the minimum was always a 1060, nothing improved from what I can tell
will a gtx 1070 ti and an i5 6700k work well for a lot of vr games?
2 uploads in a day. W0W 0-)_(-0
Really needed to highlight the Ram, Lone Echo runs like balls with only 8gb
I dont recall Sony Glasstron ever being considered VR. I do recall a Creative Labs VR headset a tech show in the mid to late 90s. It was massive, but Duke Nukem was intersting on it.
Haha, suck it losers. I'm getting an HTC Vive for Xmas! ???? (no offense)
"budget" 900+$
and what about a normal gtx 1050 (non TI) ? i wanted to buy an VR system to play beatsaber and wanna know, if its good enough.
But what about the vive? i am really curious, cause i am considering buying one to go with my razer blade (1060 6GB)
i game fine on an oculus with an r9 380 though i dont get motion sick unless im in a car for a few hours
"Budget" i guess that we have diferent ideas for what budget means
Well im running vr with a gtx 950m and its no problem). Seriously i can give you proof
Wow what a suprise. You used the minimum spec for VR and you managed to run VR. Amazing.
Finally a new VR video!
7:52
I have an GTX 1050 Ti and an Ryzen 7 1700 (I render a little more stuff). Will an Oculus Rift work for like RecRoom?
"If you already have Windows, "OR WHATEVER"". Nice dodging of pirate software suggestion. GG WP
Samsung Odyssey + here!! It may even be discounted blackfriday as they did last year!!
It gives me a headache because I'm blind. Be I need a bigger face shield, Braille laser's
Where's the RX570 and RX580? Two cards and one processor is not a thorough test at all.
The Radeon RX 580 cost less then a gtx 1060 and has more power.
Yep, that is about accurate. Although I think the RX580 8GB is better value here. You don't need the fastest stuff for VR. My Rift runs on a Ryzen 1600X and a GTX 980 4GB. Friends of mine play on Haswell chips with an R9 390X(Fine), R9 290x (Fine) or R9 270X (about minimum). Basically the "intermediate frame" stuff works really well. You don't need 90FPS all the time (although it is nice). You'll know when it becomes TOO slow though, because everything starts to shake when you move :P If you have a decent gaming rig of a couple of years old, it will probably run fine. If not? You can always do what Linus said, and buy a modest new rig ;)
but could a 1050 run it?
Would my overclocked first-gen i3 run this? :D
7:36 More like Spiderman, not Superman.
Scrapyard wars except the PC needs to run VR.
trash and overpriced cpu as always, you should get i5 3570k or 2570k.. or older ryzen
I keep hearing how great vr is for racing SIM's. Being able to actually focus on the apex of a turn, or your braking markers really helps from all accounts. Hopefully upgrading to a 1070ti or 1080 or 2070 depending on how the pricing trends play out over the next couple months.
I5-8400 and 1060 6gb should be fine right? (I hope)
Like your tshirt.
My old PC managed to get a higher score than that. FX-8300 with a RX 480 got a score of 4972
So hey I can run minimum vr sweet
No, thanks Mark Zuckerberg.
i wish i had a good pc like yours for gaming
Just buy the Google cardboard version for $15
Low spec gamer does vr on a smaller budget and doesn't require sensors too
I just got a Rift and i'm playing on a 750 Ti :p
I run vr on a 6 year old gtx 670.... with ryzen 5
I've always wanted to get into VR gaming, but my MMOs have kept me from devoting myself to a whole leap in play-style. This video might've just convinced me to go for it anyway.
Yay, an ad.
VR gloves or I'm not even going to consider.
*sponsored by Facebook
I shaved my car today
ok seriously with a inexpensive VR for your mobile phone a bit of software on the phone's side and on the computer side one can have a "good" not great not wonderful but "good" experience. Sadly the software in question is a bit unstable at times but still consider the cost of a high quality VR and gaming rig this works good enough. and yes it does work via wifi "Agian little lag but still not bad considering all i have strapped to my face is a piece of plastic and a phone. also you will never read this sadly.
The Oculus article by Verge. Well at least they didn't try to assemble the thing.
Did you use a 1060 3g or 6g
You could honestly do just fine with a Pentium G4560 and up. A GTX 1050 Ti and higher is also good as well. Consider the Lenovo Windows Mixed Reality headset as well.
Wow I didn't realize just how low the minimum specs were. I always thought my PC wouldn't be enough, I'm tempted to get a VR set now...
I find it funny that Occulus is sponsoring this video when they have officially canned their plans for the next generation of Occulus headets. Basically all of their talented designers have left at this point and Facebook has royally mismanaged the company. Not to mention their blatantly anticonsuner practices including their Occulus exclusives it really just seems like they want to push out the last of their headset stock so they can pivot away from VR.
When I hear Linus say modest, I thought 2700X+1080Ti because normal for them is 9900K 2080Ti and extreme for them is X user one PC projects.
Breaking News Tim Crook has 2 day meltdown: the dropoff in Apple's internet phone sells, must be, sharp if Tim Crook is hitting the full panic button in October. Yesterday went in on Bloomberg, today Facebook who doesn't even make phones so real cheap shot and Google. It's funny too watch. Apple already third choice for phone choice behind Huawei in 2nd and Sammy in first, in global market share. Crook must be down too selling one phone a day after that Bloomberg article of embedded spyware on the circuitboards. At least, that's what he is acting like, the bottom has fallen out of sales. If he is having a 2 day meltdown.
Alright ladies and gentlemen, it's time to start asking if it can run the climb!
No one buys oculus they all buy vibe and you know that
Just buy a Windows Mixed Reality headset for $150 on clearance untilreal next gen headset comes out with better resolution.
I knew the whole video when I saw Sponsered by oculus rift
Yes i actually just did... its called nolo vr
Il planning to buy a lenovo explorer or so And i have a low spec for vr ( even though its good for normal gaming) Will i be able to run games more easily than with a rift or vive?
I use a 750 2gb edition to run vr, how about that?
I love that your bare minimum is leaps and bounds ahead of the system I play vr games in.
yeah 900+ + 400 that makes 1300 for vr not cheap at all
but can it run the climb?
Why don't you buy windows from Kinguin?
This is virtually impressive. ;)
Oculus Quest ???
What about AMD?
https://youtu.be/L0HVsTxD2Zs
You should have done it with Rx 570
What is the game towards the end where the Ferris wheel turns into a mech spider?
@lowspec gamer, vr with AMD ryzen 2200g
finally a tech youtuber who adds the windows OS price on their budget
I thought you would have a 1080ti
RGB probably accounts for 90% of the system's performance.. Once my friend upgraded his althon 64 system with RGB lighting and it beat my 1080ti intel i7 8th gen system that has no RGB performance enhancers in timespy.
wtf in my country the cheapest oculus rift package is 450 EUROS, why in america its just 399 USD ? thats like a 100 Euros cheaper then in my country...
I hope one day I can get vr I've got a powerful enough rig but the headset and stuff is expensive
Get a Samsung Odyssey. $400, higher resolution than a Vive or Rift, no lighthouses, and no supporting Facebook if you bought a Rift.
Hey linus you are late to this, TheLowspecGamer has done a video on this 2 months ago
Meanwhile LSG: $160 headset + Ryzen 2200G.
i got my pc and wmr for around $950 all together with a 1060 3gb and ryzen 5 1600 its a pretty great machine for the price and I have never had an issue running anything sometimes it is a little slow to load but I have a 4tb hdd instead of an ssd so that could be a factor
"Look at me. I'm like Superman." Ah yes. Superman. Famous for his wall crawling abilities.
CPU/GPU/System specs is NOT the issue but the price of VR headset and the game support definitely is , You can't justify buying a shity 1060 200-250$ and turn around and by a 400$ VR headset, What type of bullshit is that Linus? Even if the VR headset was 200$, the "i3 1060" demographics will never buy that bullshit when they can put that money into a better GPU, higher refresh rate monitor, bigger SSD...etc..etc that will make their every day gaming/productivity experience much better than a VR headset you get tired of after a while and you will 100% mostly use it for porn and 360 videos/demos. Also if you're the type of person who is willing to spend 400$ on VR headset I'm pretty sure you're already running an i5+1070/1070ti tier system. VR will never ever be a thing with these prices for the average gamer who buys value parts.
Nope sorry Linus... I'm not into ads for Facebook :/ I stick to my Vive thank you very much... I'd rather you bring more of the "nerdgasm" stuff that you actually seem to enjoy :D hearing you talk about server rigs and cool network switches not only broadens my horizon but is also very entertaining!
I actually thought about getting a VR thing myself today. But im not that interested in these special VR games but i just wanna play my normal games with a keyboard/controller using the VR thing like a screen. Is that even possible?!
I wouldn't play on an oculus because of the Facebook acquisition, I would like to ditch WhatsApp too but that's kinda hard if I want to be social.
I need that boar vessel
1050 ti is good enough in real world performance. That's what I'm using and every game I've thrown at it runs surprisingly well, I'll put a small notice saying that my most demanding VR game is Doom VFR but even that works very well with no issues that I can perceive.
Where low spec gamer? He would been great for this video
Should you even game in VR? Just useless gimmick.
What monitor is that in the background behind the window?
so... get a 1060? we knew that already
I'll look into VR when it's viable wireless at a non insane price.
fallout 4 vr is like the crysis of vr
k
Cheap Windows mixed reality + Used GTX 10603gb = Best bang for the buck (atleast where I leave)
Thanks but is 90 FPS really necessary because from my perspective, that's far from budget.
Build a PC like this at your own risk. You won't be able to play AAA games.
VR is so bad we need at least 800ppi to get a good quality these VR headsets are expensive and it's not even worth it the best way to watch VR porns is getting a phone with crazy PPI like xperia xz2 premium
Answer: No, you can't.
Try firewatch  people with VR
Okay, so the video is sponsored by oculus rift, while yesterday news emerged that facebook canceled works on Oculus Rift 2. Is this last try to sell the OR 1 while they still can, or are they trying to reanimate the project that is slowly dying?
So my i7 8086k i got for free and a gtx titan 6gb i got like 3-4 years ago for $240 CAD would work then?
VR in its current guise is a yawnfest.
$900 "budget" the short answer is get a psvr
"If you already have windows, or whatever" by which you mean, "If you already have windows or you're just going to use a pirated version anyway".
Oculus rift is $650 in Europe, yeah not gonna happen buddy!
Depends on your budget, the pimax4k is a great HMD for seated VR.
I just got Tomb Raider and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice that have VR modes. This weekend will be lit!
Im trying to buy a VR gaming computer and this helps a lot. Thanks Linus ????
Humble brag at 5:15 ??
sponsored by Oculus Rift Ewwwwwwwwww, nvm. At least you were honest about it.
Man I really hate rgb lighting
The moment you actually have i3-8100 and 1060 6GB at home, lol. That sounds like VR is possible thing to consider now, yay!
Asynchronous Spacewarp Asynchronous Spacewarp Asynchronous SPACEWARP!!!
Oculus rift = sick motion ??
Linus ONLY using a 980 ti for vr i'm disguised
Who else wanted Linus to fall down in 7:22?
Eat my plump juicy boogers tseries or pewdiepie
Yeah but anybody that's actually tried it knows it's "nintendo power glove" gimmicky and not very good both hardware and software wise. I mean the concept is great but falls lightyears short of what it should deliver in order to have an experience that doesn't feel completely unpolished and in some cases utter unplayable. In the end if you want reality try leaving your computer at home and experience what real life has to offer instead.
6:50 I thought this was still in vr
Where are ryzen and radeon cards, because a 2400g an rx 580 with 8 gb ram would cost in total 370€ and you would get even better performence.
I got my Oculus Rift with touch controllers and 2 sensors for $399. That's the price of a nice PC monitor. I think that price point is reasonable for such a premium experience. I've had a blast with it for over a year now. Go get one folks!
Last time I came this early she left...
But Linus, everyone knows RGB adds 10% performance to any rig!
Body is vessel for holy spirit. Please do not stick probes to Your head. Even bible say do not be lazy in old testament.
400 POUNDS
Do a 690
I have all the surface level hardware requirements met (quad core 3.4 ghz cpu, 8 gb ram, 6gb gtx 1060[final christmas gift]) but I'm running on a amd 3+ cpu/motherboard that is missing an instruction set to play any vr. SO CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY (thank god I did) I was going to upgrade to an amd4+ socket with an 8 core 4.2 ghz cpu, but that with ram plus the vr set (windows mixed reality; ~$180) would cost somewhere in the range of $600. Looks like I won't join the future anytime soon, but hopefully I can get good enough at sculpting it. Oh and thank god you guys are doing some more budget oriented stuff.
Is the screen resolution/ quality any different in vive and rift
Interesting timing with the Rift 2 being cancelled.
But the Oculus is still expensive I can just buy Acer windows mixed reality headset...
cough LowSpecGamer cough
John carmac doom
Thanks guys as someone with a baby round the corner this did actually help
Virtual Boy
FullDive when?
But can it run climb?
so if benchmakr tool, witch is ment to mesur if you pc can do things, says it can do thing, doesnt mean it can do things, why did you benchmark it? becuase you just said it means nothing.
Can any non-shill non-fanboy tell me how the RX 480 8GB honestly performs in 2018 in VR? I'm having a hard time finding any reliable information. I have an overclocked Ryzen 7 1700 as well.
VR is a trash toy and always will be.
like Johnny Mnemonic)
Linus, the guy who has a titan V and a bunch of quadro cards and doesnt know what to do with it games on VR with a gtx 980ti. WTF? xD
Tis is everything except low end... You should have tested it with older cards like GTX960 and 760 etc... Would be way more interresting then this bullshit
Tfw you run an i3-7100 dual core and a gtx 1050 So close
Arctika 1, vrchat, vtolvr, h3vr, and gorn will not appreciate that cpu.
Yes just go R3 1200 with GTX 1050 ti / RX 570 and 8gb
why no Rizen 3 and Rx 580?
What happened to 4k content?
No shit Linus :D GTX 1060 and RX 480 were promoted as cheap VR.
AMD VR build please?
I'm not into VR anyway so yeah screw it
3 PS eye cameras, 3 move controller's one for head tracking, A phone and a good cardboard vr headset. 50$ max
You can do just about anything with a $10,000 budget...
I use my iPhone 7 and steam and a cheap google cardboard and steam vr and my phone work together with google cardboard I’ve played sibnautica in vr
It's good you're promoting VR, bad that you are promoting Oculus, their business practices are slimy as hell and only serve to hurt the industry. Steam and the Vive are working to make the industry open and inclusive to benefit everyone (including Rift users).
If a VR headset is over 50 it's overpriced.
My issue with VR isn't my PC, I upgraded to a top liner a few months ago. My issue is with the tech. I want to buy the Oculus bundle but it's £400. I don't wanna buy an Oculus and in a few months find out that a new and much better one is available. That's my issue with new(ish) and constantly developing technology. I bought the nVidia 3D vision thing when that came out then they released a better version a few months later. Even when I was a kid I got a Gameboy Advance SP for Christmas one year and like a week later the Nintendo DS was announced. I feel like with my luck I'll buy an Oculus Rift and the next day Oculus will announce the Rift 2 or something.
i have an i5 6600k and a 1060 6gb works like a dream for me. i might not play with the oculus for a month or 2 but every time I play it i think wow. and if your going to play super-hot vr be ready to sweat.
If you get motion sick easy, anything less than a 1080 leads to motion sickness though
Windows mixed reality is the only way to go.
Linus I was a fan Now I’m a huge fan.
FLAT MODE
Lol, i have a i3 8100 system with 128+2000gb rom and 8gb ram for €500 ( =550$)
This is the first time i see linus without a liter of oil in his hair.
End of this year around xmas quite a few vr sets will enter the market at price of 199 dollars.
"Where is yout team spirit" - wears a vessel shirt
You can get windows 10 pro from ebay for like 5$. Why do you have it listed like 125$?
ya know walmart has the lenovo mixed reality headset for $170 brand new right?
I don't like that this is sponsored by oculus. There are some great cheap VR headsets like Microsoft mixed reality things. They help with the budget.
My low spec vr is a used hp windows mixed reality and a 1050 with a amd fx 8300
BTW you can get windows in Amazon for 5-10$
is this targeted advertising
i love you doing vr stuff
Whats a good budget vr headset?
It's not the spec of the PC that keeps me away from VR. I got that covered, it's the cost of the VR kit that makes it expensive. Also, it's not like there are any must-have VR games out there to play. Why spend $400 buck on what is little more than a toy. Something that will without compelling games surely spend most of its life gathering dust.
What about vr on amd cards?? those cards are kind of made more for vr then everything else ??
Oh, this is awkward. Facebook recently canned the Rift 2 ...
* mild shock * RGB NONESENSE????
My rigs an I7 16gb ddr4 with a 1050 ti mini and it does vr just fine. :D
I was curious about using a GTX 1060 Max-Q to see if that would be “minimum”
Pentium G3258 @ 4.4ghz and a 1050Ti? No? damn :(
Linus please make a pc build video to play any AAA titles in 1080p res in 60fps... In this era of 4k gaming playing at 1080p res is the only option for budget gamers to have a descent gaming experience... Thank you in advance...
friends help me through... in core i5 what graphics card will give smooth results . and also with low budget. lolxx
Will you redo this video without it being a commercial? You know, try a Windows Mixed Reality headset or two maybe?
No you cant , If you wanna Play the best porn Simulation in vr ( virt a Mate created by meshed VR ) you gonna need a 3080 ti !
Oculus Rift + Touch Bundle = EUR 449.00 (511.30 USD) + EUR700 for 1080ti + a 4K monitor.. NO!
i got the core 13 8100k with a 1060 so i should be better than the first test XD
Ever heard of PSVR? Lol
The VR headsets are still too expensive...
Nvidia: gtx 1060 VR Ready Linus: wooow, do you see that? 1060 is vr ready!
how bout no
Considering getting a vive. Can someone tell me honestly if shelling out $400 is worth it?
Wow! Now you only have to give your pinky finger for a headset! Who needs them anyways...
Hey bro can you hook me up with a SICK gaming pc because I’m gaming on a hp pavilion 23 ??
I play vr on an i5 680 and an gtx 970. I know it is an crazy combination, but it were just old parts laying around. It costs almost 200€ for this Build. And every Game runs smoothly. Just a few cant hande Bots cause of the CPU limitations.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huT6fp7nzwA REAL budget VR on AMD APU
When is Amazon going to create a vr program to shop in? So we can see perspective what they look like.
My friend has a vr pc and he has a ryzen 5 1200 and a rx580 8gb for a system price of $672
>VR on a budget >900$ PC
SRSLY. Going over Oculus again when Lenovo and Samsung headsets are BETTER for the price, AND not mentioning that steam HAS ASW re-projection now so ALL steamVR headsets can "run on modest machines" now. God the quality of these videos is going down hill.
$400 is still $200 too much
Linus adds in Windows 10 liscense price, yet they don't have it themselves
Budget VR means a Window Mixed Realityheadset, not the stupid and outdated Rift or the underpowered Quest.
It's dead jim
You guys should look at PSVR since its the cheapest entry VR (not counting the phone VR headsets). You can get it all for under $400. Personally I used it and it was enjoyable.
Are you using the Oculus quest?
Hmmm, define budget
Please review beast grip dof adapter
Not even playing BeatSaber... noobs
"budget" doesn't include a $450 headset (yes, it's "$399", but you need to buy a third sensor for another $50) when there are actual budget headsets in the $180-$220 range like the Lenovo and Asus MR headsets that are perfectly functional.
Ha cool my post went into video! posted about VR on my Xeon cpu
Current balance: $30.91, should be enough right?
wow the lowest end gpu with "vr ready" on the box is the lowest end gpu you should use for vr
so let me get this straight... he has a warehouse that has a SHELF FULL OF 1080/ 1080TI'S and he vr games on a 980TI?!?!! was that an error or is this just a really old video that was never properly uploaded?
Linus Tech Tips: GX 980 TI VR Me: MacBook Air with 8gb ram, and i5 processor and only Intel HD GRAPHICS 6000 and a 256gb ssd Me: Lags to 5fps
BUTT
Using my old i7 2600k and a 1070Ti just for VR stuff. Works a treat.
All I have is 4.65$CAD and half a hot dog I'll hope It can do
Was this a GTX 1060 3gb or 6gb
This is the real BUDGET-VR , I made a VR System Based on the Raspberry PI, that let's you play (non VR) FPS games with a tracked headset! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8R5RfQb1k&t=27s
Would you not be better with a PS4 and Playstation VR if you are looking to do VR on a budget
Miss the old contents, new contents becoming kind of crap
2 BUY VR U HAVE 2 HAVE MONEY FFS.........
-Makes a budget video -Holds RTX graphics card -hmmmm
i3-8100 with GTX 1060 3GB represant here! :D Still, I wouldn't buy $500 oculus that is worth 50% of my current PC, I would probably upgrade some component first.
I was expecting a more low spec system, not something we already knew bcould run vr decently
you can still do vr on a 3rd gen i5
I have an- i3 8100 msi gtx 1050 2gb oc z370p d3 gigabyte mobo Would it be worth it to step up into the 1060 6gb for vr and flat gaming. Or should i do the cpu first ?
I play vr with a 1050ti and it works fine, just not on max settings.
Pff 1060. I run my Oculus on a 760ti and an fx6300 T.T and it works just fine lol
But can it run lone echo
Without watching the video I can already answer: Yes of course, as long as gaming on VR is a possibility for an amount of money. Any amount of money can be a budget. If I "only" wanna spend $5000 on a PC then that's my budget, for which I can definetly build a PC + VR headset + games. Now if I only had a small loan of a million dollars....
Plz review oculus quest when it releases
Just go watch the low spec gamer play vr on vega 8
Why isn't this video in 4K???
So many sponsored videos. You defiantly have a rift. Why sponsored? Money surely isn't that tight?!??! Can I even trust you anymore?!?
I'm gonna build a system for VR next year :D
yea this is budget pc
Nope, because 1 dolar is 5,7 Turkish Lira. Sad ??
What if, all I want is the 3D gaming and I don't care much about hand controllers and head tracking. Basically VR headset as monitor and keyboard and mouse for controls?
Is it locked behind window 10? There still isn’t a killer VR game yet that is meant for VR and still fun game. Only game I’ve wanted to try in VR was subnautica which struggle to run on my i7 3770k 3.5 GHz, 16 GB, with GTX 1080TI, ssd At times fps drops below 25 fps the deeper you go. Love the game. But still runs like shit.
glass jar full on moneys..don't drop it.
Couldn't you have gone deeper? OCULUS has many tools and programs to further lower the graphics and increase the performance.
i3 4130 and 1070. Call me dumb but my pc dirt cheap and runs it all
400th comment
You can get Windows 10 Pro for $9.99 from a Bonanza seller. I just finished a $3500 build (monitor/accessories included) and still didn't see the need in spending $100+ on Windows
Aaand still no good VR games. Skyrim VR is best for me just becouse it have good graphics and good framerate on my gtx1070. Cant say same about fallout4 VR.
You didn't quite went into the low spec gamer territory
Pimax vr pre order went live today. Oculus price dropped. Coincidence? Probably.
Hey Linus you should make a video about custom bios
360p club hands up ??
yeah get gearvr on ur phone its the same shit
Linus in the end of 2018 rift or vive? My pc is already far ahead of spec
yes its called ps4
No
How far would I come with, and how long will it be "good" the next years:? Cpu: Ryzen 7 2700x GPU: Asus 1080 Ti RAM: G.Skill 16GB RAM (probably 32 some time)
Wow, you discovered that 1050 Ti and a 1060 6gb are usable for VR, even though a weaker 960 has been specified as a minimum for VR for years now. Great job....
Is this real https://www.tech-bazaar.com/product/lenovo-ideacentre-gaming-pc-700-24ish-intel-core-i5-6400-2-7ghz-8gb-ram-2tb-hdd-gt-930-all-in-one-pc/
i was litterally waiting for this video i was planing to buy a laptop and was wondering if it could run vr nice job thumbs up
But wasnt the 1060 always VR Capable ?
When you said the specs you can run it on might surprise you, I expected you to go for something weaker than what has been deemed the minimum specs for VR since oculus/vive came out (which was a quad core and a GTX 970, which is equivilant to a GTX 1060)

Linus, I'm running VR on an i5 3570K with a 1050Ti, works just fine. So you Can go even cheaper if you have to. I liked the video thx.
Who pays 140 bugs for a windows key?
I mean if my i3-3250 (!) can handle a HD 7950 (!) - in flat, mind you, obviously ?? - why was it suprising to you guys that an i3-8100 and a 1060 works good enough in VR? ?? And why aren’t people giving potentials for cheaper CPUs so that they can save money for RAM or Graphics Cards, but this is just in my opinion. ?????
When will VR porn come?
Google Cardboard and Pornhub total $15 its all good
get a windows mixed reality Dell Visor and a gtx 960, and an i5 bam
Lenovo WMR is only 100 on BHphoto and order some controllers on amazon for about 30 dollars ez
Hm turns out I could run VR with rx580. Would never have thought.
Hold up, on your spec sheet you listed the stock cooler Linus, but the pc clearly has a corsair water cooler on it.
Me: Magic conch, can this person on a budget game in vr ? Magic conch: no.
not first
I have i3 8100 and a 1060 3gb, and i3 8100 performs faster than i5 7th gen
omg i literally have an i3 and an nvidia GTX1060 8gb of ram in my pc
Doesn’t matter if they cut the price,i still can’t afford it??. I also can’t afford a system upgrade,getting a new mb,cpu and ram(i’m still on ddr3). Anyone looking for a kidney by any chance?
I have over 500 hrs in VR and its amazing! I do Beat Saber #1 Ranked in Puerto Rico Full Body VR Chat And my headsets are the Lenovo Explorer WMR And the Samsung Odyssey WMR And ask me any doubts you may have about VR and Windows Mixed Reality they are better than linus makes them look.
I’m running an oculus with 3 sensors and touch with a ryzen 3 1200, 4gb ddr4, and a gtx 1050 ti.
Do you know a non indie VR game?
(2010) parents said don’t look at the screen too close or your lose your eye sight. (2016) parents buy be for their kids....
Sponsored by occulous. Yeahhhh I'd rather fucking NOT
What if your PC gets 30 frames while paying minecraft (at max)
what is the case we see in the video. look great. I want it
I have a rift for £350 and a PC for £400 (bought used, several years ago) all depends if you call £750 budget or not...
If you're really looking for cheap, last gen Ryzen 7 is fantastic for VR. I have one paired with a GTX 1070, Great experience
I game on a 8100 and a 1060 6gb and works great! Never thought that it could do VR so well
VR isn't worth it.
i mean, the only vr headset i have confidence in is the new oculus quest headset, and its the one im willing to put money into
Using a $900 system with a quad core i3 and a 1060 for VR.... I'm "SHOCKED" that it works........... If you'd showed me VR on a <$400 PC using older hardware I might have been a little impressed.
Of course you can. Didn't specify the size of the budget though.
vessel
Of course you can game in VR on a budget. It all depends on what that budget is tho! But its possible! For a smart tech guy, you sure ask stupid questions lol!!! :P
"budget"
I play fallout 4 vr on a 1050 ti and it is a great experience
1050ti isnt what I would describe as budget or barebones. Sure its not high-tier, but I also wouldnt call it average. The thing you need to remember is thats its not just the average price of the graphics card, its the fact that most people arent building their computer today. The average person may well have built their PC years ago and really shelled out on it then, which means by now its out of date despite costing around the same price as a higher tier system today. I think the genuine solution to VR on a budget will be quest
I have a Ryzen 1800X and an RX 480OC 8gb. How well do you think I'll run?
Can my dual core pentium run it?
im watching this on my oculus rift on the oculus home. im using a 1050ti and Im having an amazing time IN Skyrim VR.
i'm early. nice.
You have an interesting definition of "On a Budget".
Vr is cancer makes my stomach sick...
Ryzen 5 2600? come on, always Intel and Nvidia in this channel....meh
New into please!!d
100% what I searched for. Uploaded exactly when I needed it. Wow, that's not a coincidence anymore :D (happened quite often last month)
Didn't try a more butget 3G 160 ti :(
Robo Recall is unfortunately not free if you want to save $80 and buy used. I made that mistake. Spent most of the money I saved on the games that would have been included. Derp.
What about something like a 780? Approx like a 1060
There are much better options for True budget VR :)
I don't get it, Hardware Unboxed released an "Ultimate Bang for Your Buck 1440p Gaming System Build" that is 970$ with Ryzen 5 2600 and 1070ti, and this one with i3 8100 and 1060 is 910$? Something is not right...
Games for VR is still a little expensive, take that in mind too
4:53 Shopping list, just FYI
cough cough grey market keys for 13 euro , bought 2 so far both worked
I use a WMR headset at 60 hz due to nvidia optimus. Its pretty alright.
YUP
google got you covered with their high tech cardboard thingy
Would be fun to see step down tests. Play on worse and worse rigs until motion sickness is unbearable
My pc really low spec, i got a gt 710 1gb card, 4gb ram and a core i5 2,8 ghz
Virtual reality + 1030. Check Low Spec Gaming to learn how ;)
I saw this on LowSpecGamer, so the answer is yes.
Linus is a good boy. He wears his wrist straps.
my laptop can't even play 1080p vidson youtube. I always watch in 720p Smash like if ur too poor like me
why i was thinking that i was going to watch rift/vive headset alternatives (not the crappy mobile headsets with no games available) and not that what i have in my system is ok for vr?
no u
Oclus go would be way cheaper?
Oculus has joined the chat
Go onto low spec gamer
I have a 1060 paired with a Pentium G5600 on a MSI Z370 Gaming Pro Carbon??. I have the VR ready stamp on all benchmarks and I can run games very well in VR
Lenovo Explorer here, if i had to make a list from best to worse the Oculus is like 5th after the Dell WMR
Just what i needed to decide if i should buy a headset
So the 1050 ti would be able to run vr? Thats pretty neat
vive is so far beyond superior
We've shown that you can do oculus gaming on an older cheaper card, the 780, which is very similar to a 1060 but they can be found near $110 these days.
pretty deceptive on the i5-1060 combo, the "total price" doesn't include an oculus
God, why does has really decreased in quality, 1060 is VR ready, everyone knows that, we're here to see is it can run on something like a 1050ti, but no.
I am interested in VR for a racing sim rig.
Why no amd. No love for the red team. Smh capitalists
has multiple 1080ti in office... uses a 980ti at home
It's great to see the improvements in VR technology... ...and I'm still not going to buy it.
Please stop using "budget" as meaning "with spending as good as little as possible"
Doesn't all VR still have screen door effect?
(¡__¡) At last can experience VR Great oculus go ahead and make vr more and more affordable
Good!
I can do this using my phone and the Intel he graphics for stream some games as a vr (with medium graphics)
"Hey Ivan, i'm opening your start menu what're you gonna do about it?" "I can touch you... inappropriately."
I love my $200 Lenovo Explorer.
I've got a 1060 and i5 7th gen(i think?) Will this be able to run skyrim VR? (16GB ram if it matters)
linux your depth of stuff is relatively a Non-budget... Did you knew you could achieve the same performance using amd phenom x6 ( cpu +mobo total100$) and gtx1070 ..
M8 I have a gtx 1050ti and a ryzen 5 1500x and I play vr just fine.
the ad...? Oh I forgot the whole video is an ad
It would be dope if playstation and xbox had a blue tooth system that hooks up to you phone so when u play split screen u get a screen and audio to yourself
Regardless of whether you could buy a cheap VR setup there's still only a handful of games worth playing and the rest are nothing more than glorified tech demos. By the time decent gaming experiences made specifically for VR come out, you'd have to shell out again for new hardware if not for the headset, definitely for new PC parts. And that's without adding in floor space or the likelihood that games will cause VR sickness. VR is not worth the money until it reaches Holodeck levels.
?
I built a pc purely on parts I found at yards sales for under 150$ US AMD FX 6200, 16GB RAM, 1GB MSI OC GRAPHICS CARD, ASUS MOTHERBOARD, COOLER MASTER PC CASE, 13 FANS IN PC, OH an I almost forgot a OCULUS RIFT DK1 VR HEADSET SO YES YOU CAN GAME IN VR ON A BUDGET LINUS.??
This feels.. not that useful to me. Is there really anyone out there building a PC specifically for these sort of small and gimmicky VR games? In my experience, they're fun for a few minutes, but none of them are something I'd invest real time and money into. To me, the appeal of VR is for much more demanding, simulator style games like elite dangerous and project cars. If I was going to spend $1k+ on a PC and headset, those are the types of games I'd want to target.
" If you already have windows or whatever"- just say the word, Linus.
Wooo, Oculus Quest! :D
Was that a verge pc cameo?
I moved my VR setup off my main pc (7700k and 1080ti) to a spare pc I have in a larger room, and it is running okay (not great). I have an i5 2500k overclocked paired up with a gtx 1070. I do notice some of the larger titles do not run anywhere as smooth as they did on my main rig set up, but it is passable. I am definitely thinking it is time to upgrade the ol' workhorse in that spare that is the 2500k, but man, its just been through so much over the years I do not want to let it go.
Pretty funny video considering the co-founder of Oculus Rift left and they cancelled the Rift 2 so they can make low quality/price toy VR systems. https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/279364-oculus-rift-2-canceled-co-founder-leaves-facebook
Wow. Those prices. So low! 72 USD for a 1TB SSD? Wow....
Not sure, but I think it's called google cardboard
This is a much better sponsored video. Doesn't feel like a commercial, like some other LTT sponsored videos.
Where's the "showcase" in the title?
What matters more, cpu or gru when it comes to vr?
Looks like a paid commercial for Rift
0:27 But If someone (I don't know who) buys a msi dragon I think it's no problem??
Eyyy
Oculus Rift the best
Can you use a titan x to play vr on
1060 3g or 6g
Or... you can get a Intel NIC and slap an external GPU on it! (like i did with the NUC Skull Canyon and the Aorus Gaming Box 1070)
video plays better if you put the speed at 1.25
I just bought a new laptop with a 1060 max Q and a 7700HQ. Then this would be enough to use vr? ( I do have 32GB ram and so)
if you you want buget vr get a windows mixed reality
At least look into Windows Mixed Reality to VR on a budget.
I got a gtx 1050 ti i5 8400 combo and no money or space for a headset
Ahem Oculus quest ahemm
who's exited for the oculus quest
If i had the space i would have probably taken the plunge on VR. The computational requirement is currently not an issue but the amount of space all but counts me out on that.
I would get a AMD rx580 instead of a GTX 1060. Because it's cheaper (at least here in Germany it's 209€ for a 8GB version. Don't buy a 4GB version, it's not worth that 20 bucks saving by far) and has a bit more power. And of course you get more VRAM
Uploaded 16min ago and 8.9k views. Wtf bro
Notification Train CHOO CHOO!
do you really want to wear a GIMP mask!????
all the more reasons to buy used 10xx mining cards
Last night I dreamed you bro ????????
I'm thinking HTC will have to respond to this price drop which is good. I might have to finally buy one.
I smell an opportunity with scrapyard wars and VR.
Linus: "Where is your team spirit?" Ivan: "At home.."
I use VR on an AsRock 990FX w/an 8150 CPU & 2 R9 290's.
Yet another great video from tech dad!!
Foreshadowing for VR scrapyard wars?
I'm reminded of Thing from Addams Family...and yeah old dudes like me don't VR at any price because of motion sickness.
Oh man not premier
My answer: Yeah, just buy a PS4 and PS VR. It might not be the best but it's not that expensive and it's easy.
Really it's AWESOME!!!!????
I think this was a old video, never posted. Oculus has the oculus Quest coming out for $400 and it doesn't need a pc
5:33 BABY ITS TRIPLE
Sure! But can you budget in VR? Hmmmmm?
You guys gotta do these budget builds with used parts. I built my system with slightly better specs than your PC. For $600. That means that for $1000, you can get the headset AND system for $100 more than your pc ONLY.
I have bought a rift and love it
WOOHOO 205th!
Video is 9:33 not 10:00 Respect+
Eyy another VR video
Someone please check out my youtube video please leave a comment and subscribe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jpfoffhBPE
Linus could've dropped the price even further
VR for a budget? LowSpecGamer? Where are you?
But the gtx 1060 is vr ready so it isnt so impressive
Thanks for covering VR Linus tech Media!! Even if sponsored ?? VR needs mainstream!
I feel like the eye tracking is going to scan ur eye retina and scan your room to see into your personal space
collab about this with LowSpecGamer hes the master at this
Ahh the climb, I've literally woke up sore because of that game.
Could be just me, but the price isn't even the biggest/only problem I have with "VR being the next big thing". Imo VR is just a toy like the whole Camera or Movement controlls a couple of years ago. Quite frankly I don't wanna constantly sit or stand around with a fucking VR headset on my head while gaming, as a fun thing to play around with, sure. "Future of gaming" hell no.
I have my oculus rift panels overclocked to 110Hz. It is so much better that way
can it run gorn???
Also: Windows Mixed Reality machines can be found for around $200! Dont watch linus's review, he got a crap sample but in general they perform up to the standard of a Vive, and better than an oculus.
something something flat is justice
So i can't run VR with my GTX 660?
Ugh, I was hoping for an interesting video like lowspecgamer's vid with a cheap mr headsets and ryzen apu. Shame it had to be ruined by sponsorship. :c
NO NO NO NO THE OLD INTRO REEE
I'd rather buy myself a real genuent equipment instead of wasting money on something that I know I'll regret... This is not content I subsribed for, you can do better guys.
Linus, can you do a wireless VR video next?
Yeap, of course. $200 VR kit on AliExpress. ;) Do you know Oculus Rift and HTC Vive used Samsung displays? ;) Or try Smartphone + Trinus or other apps like this.
Linus the best
I've been wondering about this!!! Thanks again for another informative video :-)
I play VR on a 1060 6gb and an 8th gen i3 and I have never had any problems running games.
He is sooooooooooo hot and sexy
Got a vive. Dont know what games go get
wow the dislike in here is much better than the I phone review
I appreciate if you help me reach 20 subscribers
Yeah, go play Pokemon Go. It's literally free lol. AR is VR for poor people.
Quadcore + GTX 1060.... Oh geee.... I did not see that coming....
VIVE > oculus
A 1060 is not what I'd consider budget
Wait before the video starts can it run On a gtx660ti
Ty linus
1th
Next up on LTT:- Can you call 911 with two cups and a string?! Stay tuned.
I'm wathcing this video so early that I have to watch it in peasant 1080p
The answer is no Linus, no you can't.
and Oculus also drop its Founder because of facebook sorry I AM NOT SOLD
I have 3 exams today.
Nice and early
No
Hey...
get a windows mixed reality lenovo for low spec computer. A basic spec would be a gtx960 on FX8350. Edit GTX 760 SC can run it but limited lower framerate
GANG
please review asus tuf
5:01 or whatever.. :DD
I did my bachelor's about this topic. In half of the games RX 550 is even enough. :P
Lenovo' "mixed reality" headset is 100 bucks for just the headset
VR / 3D its something in the pass i stay with 2d thank you no headdick no empty wallet and no need for new hardware in my pc.
NO
No, still no
do you have to have 2 separate gpu to run 4k and 1080p
No
What version of the 1060 did you use. The 3gb 6gb or the ddr5x version
u have f*ck load of new gpus and u use a 980ti. nice xd
Sup
Yeah you can. It's called Google Cardboard.
linus fake tech tips
VR is still alive?
I bought a 5dollar vr 1year ago and its still is resting at the same place bcoz after 2-3days you will realise it not the real vr this thing is peace of shit btw still i can say that 5dollar vr is good for watching movies and for 360° vr porn.
Notification squad babe!
it's sad I can't use a VR headset. My eyes are so bad they aren't close enough to the screen to see them and not be blurred. VR seems really cool
I thought a mixed reality vr company would sponsor this video
Still mad cause ur last vid
Just here for the hardware porn. And Linus and his crew.
Why would you WANT to game in VR? /end thread.
My VR machine is a I7 2600, 8GB of ram, RX480 or GTX1060 (1060 for mixed reality).
VR....VENOM
Short answer. If you want a decent experience.... Hell No. It's still like $1200 to start at the bare minimum specs.
I have my phone and cardboard headset for VRPorn,com. I’m good
I like budgeting on a VR
Pimax just announced their controller and base station bundle - $300 for two SteamVR 2.0 base stations and two tracked controllers. I think that plus some WMR HMD will be the go-to VR bundle in the future (once Pimax is actually shipping on demand).
100$ cut is way to less! Make it 200$ and we can start talking about THINKING to get VR!
Just buy a cardboard box and lenses. There you go! Very cheap VR for your phone!
How are there more likes and dislikes than there are views.
Hey Linus! You've got Techquickie Competition! Is austin gonna beat you??!!! Well *This Is* exactly what we're wondering :p

Please Linus can you help me with a editing pc i love editing very much pleasee
Got my attention really quick lol
Dear Linus, I bet you’re thinking, why is this random kid writing a letter in the comment section of my video? To answer that question, if you did ask yourself that, I wanted to ask you what would you suggest for a good gaming desktop and monitor, I haven’t ever bought or owned a gaming pc so I’m not sure what exactly to get for my first desktop. Yet I do need to stay inside of a price zone, somewhere between $700 to $1300, yet I do make YouTube videos and I do stream sometimes, so I will need a good pc to run this as well as at least 10 games. I don’t know if it would be better to build a computer or just to buy a pre-built model. Love the videos keep up the good work. Sincerely, Uni YouTube
too many sponsored vids now days....
Not first
Still unhappy about Linus bending over for the apple fanboys in the forum.
